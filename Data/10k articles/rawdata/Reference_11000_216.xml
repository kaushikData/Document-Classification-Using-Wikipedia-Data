'''''An Instinct for Dragons''''' is a book by [[University of Central Florida]] [[anthropologist]] David E. Jones, in which he seeks to explain the alleged universality of [[dragon]] images in the [[folklore]] of human societies. In the introduction, Jones conducts a survey of dragon myths from cultures around the world and argues that certain aspects of dragons or dragon-like mythical creatures are found very widely. He claims that even the [[Inuit]] have a reptilian dragon-like monster, even though (living in a frigid environment unsuited for cold-blooded animals) they had never seen an actual [[reptile]].

Jones then argues against the common [[hypothesis]] that dragon myths might be motivated by primitive discoveries of [[dinosaur]] [[fossil]]s (he argues that there are widespread traits of dragons in folklore which are not observable from fossils), and claims that the common traits of dragons seem to be an amalgam of the principal predators of our ancestral [[hominid]]s, which he names as the [[Bird of prey|raptor]]s, great cats (especially [[leopard]]s) and [[Pythonidae|python]]s.

The hypothesis to which Jones conforms is that over millions of years of [[evolution]], members of a species will evolve an [[instinct]]ive fear of their [[predator]]s, and he proposes ways in which these fearful images may be merged in artistic or cultural expression to create the dragon image and, perhaps, other kinds of hybrid monster.

Finally he suggests sociological reasons for why such images may be perceived differently at different stages of a culture to try to explain why  [[Chinese dragon]]s are considered basically good and representative of government, but the great majority (although not all) [[European dragon]]s are evil and often represent chaos.

==Reception==
Jones' theory was opposed in an article by Paul Jordan-Smith in the Spring 2002 issue of ''Western Folklore'' and by other authors. Jordan-Smith criticized the lack of evidence given to prove why dragon myths could not have been passed from culture to culture. He also notes that it cannot be demonstrated that the fears of ancestral hominids are coded into the human brain. He concludes his review by writing "One is tempted to say, as [[Dorothy Parker]] once did, that this is a book not to be tossed aside lightly but thrown violently. But no, it is not worth spending even that much energy on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Paul |last=Jordan-Smith |jstor=1500302 |title=Review: ''An Instinct for Dragons'' |journal=Western Folklore |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D. Ogden writes that Jones' ideas "might offer pause for thought given the universality of dragon-slaying narratives". He adds, though, that the compound cat, snake, raptor creature imagined by Jones is mostly the Western stereotype based on [[European dragon#Middle Ages|mediaeval imagery]], and that Jones has sought out similar images in a way that lacks [[Scholarly method|rigor]]. In particular, Ogden notes that the [[Dragons in Greek mythology|dragons of Graeco-Roman myth]] do not fit with Jones's prototype, typically lacking one or more of the hybrid components (with the exception of [[Typhon]], who, however, combines many more animals than Jones's three).&lt;ref name="drakon"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Drakon: Dragon Myth and Serpent Cult in the Greek and Roman Worlds |first=Daniel |last=Ogden |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2013 |pages=24–25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5147">The '''Annals of Clonmacnoise''' are an early 17th-century [[Early Modern English]] translation of a lost Irish chronicle, which covered events in Ireland from pre-history to [[AD]] 1408. The work is sometimes known as '''Mageoghagan’s Book''', after its translator [[Conall the Historian]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy ''Annals of Clonmacnoise'' (Dublin 1896).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation==

The Irish chronicle was translated into English, in the style of the Elizabethan period, in 1627 by [[Conall MacGeoghegan|Conall Mag Eochagáin]], of Lismoyny (Co. Westmeath), near [[Clara, County Offaly|Clara]], [[Co. Offaly]]. Mag Eochagáin dedicated this translation to his brother-in-law, Toirdhealbhach Mac Cochláin, whose family was among the last to uphold and practice native Irish Gaelic customs.

The translation was completed on April 20, 1627 in the Castle of Lemanaghan in County Offaly. The original manuscript of Mag Eochagáin's translation is lost, but there are several copies of it in both the [[Trinity College Library, Dublin|Library of Trinity College]] and in the [[British Museum]].

The original work was in [[Irish Gaelic]]. Mag Eochagáin more than once refers "to the ould Irish book out of which he wrote, to the old Irish book which he translates, out of which many leaves were lost or stolen.." Mag Eochagáin seems to have preserved the value of the original Gaelic phraseology and rendered it every justice as far as we can determine in the absence of the original manuscript.

==Provenance of the original chronicle==
[[File:Clonmacnoise 6.jpg|thumb|Ruins of Clonmacnoise ecclesiastical site.]]
The original manuscript or manuscripts of the Irish annals are lost, and the names of its compilers are unknown. These annals have usually gone by the name of the Annals of Clonmacnoise, because the work was thought to be based on materials gathered at the monastery of [[Clonmacnoise]], though there is some doubt about this. In the book itself there is nothing to show why it should be called by this name. However, the Annals do give special prominence to the history of the parts of the country on both sides of the River Shannon at Clonmacnoise and to the families inhabiting the areas of [[Uí Maine]] (Hy Many) surrounding them, namely O'Kellys, O'Rourkes, O'Molloys, O'Connors and McDermotts. In addition, the text bears close similarities to the so-called Clonmacnoise-group of annalistic texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Medieval Irish Annals|last=Mac Niocaill|first=Gearóid|publisher=Dublin Historical Association|year=1975|isbn=|location=Dublin|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal value of these Annals arises from the historical details given of these districts and families which are not found to the same extent elsewhere.

==Contents==
The Annals give the history of Ireland and the areas surrounding Clonmacnoise from the creation of man to the year 1408. Mag Eochagáin points out that several parts of the original work are missing as from 1182 to 1199 and again from 1290 to 1299. He states that the originals were destroyed not merely by the books being burnt by marauding Vikings but also by tailors cutting the leaves of the books and slicing them off in long pieces to make their measures.

==Edition==
The translation of the Annals was first published in Dublin in 1896 and again reprinted by Llanerch Publishers in 1993.  Scholars have repeatedly called for a new edition as Murphy’s edition has been deemed inadequate for modern scholarly purposes. Such scholars include Prof David Dumville who has bemoaned the ‘poor textual condition of the Annals of Clonmacnoise and the lack of adequate modern criticism of that text’.&lt;ref&gt;D. Dumville and K. Grabowski, ''Chronicles and Annals of Mediaeval Ireland and Wales'' (Boydell Press, 1984), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr Nollaig O Muraile has also expressed a wish that someone will undertake one of ‘those great desiderata in this particular field - namely new, up-to-date editions of the Annals of Tigernach, of Mageoghegan's Book’ (i.e. the Annals of Clonmacnoise).&lt;ref&gt;N. O Muraile, [http://www.fourcourtspress.ie/reviews.php?intProductID=703 Review of D. P. Mc Carthy's ''The Irish Annals: their Genesis, Evolution and History'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9491">The '''At-Large Advisory Committee''' ('''ALAC''') is an advisory committee to [[ICANN]], the organization that administers the Internet's [[Domain Name System]] and addressing system. According to [[ICANN]] Bylaw XI.4.a, "ALAC is the primary organizational home within ICANN for individual Internet users",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icann.org/en/about/governance/bylaws#XI&lt;/ref&gt; with a mandate to "consider and provide advice on the activities of ICANN, insofar as they relate to the interests of individual Internet users".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icann.org/en/about/governance/bylaws#XI&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and mission==

The ALAC is composed by fifteen members, three from each of the five geographic regions used by ICANN for geographical diversity requirements.

As a part of its mission, the ALAC reaches out for groups of individual Internet users all around the world - identified as ''At-Large Structures'' (ALSes) - and encourages them to apply for accreditation by ICANN. Once accredited, these groups can participate in the five ''Regional At-Large Organizations'' (RALOs), regional groupings that host discussions at a regional level. In turn, each RALO appoints two members of the ALAC (for a total of ten members out of fifteen). This builds an open, bottom-up mechanism to select the ALAC members. The remaining five members of the ALAC are appointed by ICANN's Nominating Committee.

The ALAC appoints one non-voting representative to the councils of the [[Generic Names Supporting Organization]] and to the [[Country Code Names Supporting Organization]], and liaisons to ICANN working groups and task forces. It also appoints five members (one per geographic region) of ICANN's Nominating Committee. It has some statutory authority, though limited, to influence ICANN's policy making activities. However, it usually shares its opinions through non-binding advisory statements sent to the ICANN Board.

Originally the ALAC appointed a liaison to the ICANN Board; however, that position was abolished in 2010 when an additional, fully voting position on the ICANN Board was designated to be selected by the At-Large community. The first person selected by this process, joining the ICANN Board in October 2012, was former ALAC member [[Sébastien Bachollet]]&lt;ref&gt;https://community.icann.org/display/DirCan/At-Large+Director+Candidate+2010+Workspace&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The ALAC was created in 2002, as one of the changes introduced in the so-called "ICANN 2.0" reform, with the purpose of providing a viable mechanism for participation by a significant number of active individual users of the Internet from around the world. Its structure was studied through the ''At-Large Advisory Committee Assistance Group'', which made a proposal that was then approved by the ICANN Board.

The first ALAC was appointed in January 2003. Since the Regional At-Large Organizations did not exist yet, the committee was marked as "interim" and the ten regional members were appointed by the ICANN Board instead. The initial membership included the former ICANN Chairman [[Esther Dyson]]. The initial Chairman was [[Vittorio Bertola]], and the first appointed liaison to the ICANN Board was [[Roberto Gaetano]], and [[Thomas Roessler]] to the GNSO, who in December 2004 left his position to [[Bret Fausett]]. In March 2006, Bertola left the Chairmanship to [[Annette Muehlberg]]; in December 2006, Bertola was appointed as the new Board liaison, [[Alan Greenberg (technologist)|Alan Greenberg]] as GNSO liaison, and [[Siavash Shahshahani]] as CCNSO liaison.

Initially, there was widespread concern that the ALAC would fail as a result of a perception of disenfranchisement common to many Internet rights groups - especially the North American ones - that followed the demise by ICANN of the original At Large election plan. However, the number of accredited At Large Structures grew slowly but steadily, reaching 100 in the first months of 2007. In December 2006, the first Regional At-Large Organization - the Latin American RALO was formally accredited by ICANN. Further RALOs for Europe, Africa and Asia-Pacific were expected to be accredited in the first half of 2007.

'''Barrett v IBC International Ltd''' [1995] 3 NZLR 160 is a cited case in [[New Zealand]]	 regarding the legal concept of certainty regarding [[contract]] formation.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=33-34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
For the sum of $2, Barrett gave IBC International an option to purchase their property within the following 180 days. However, the settlement date in the contract merely stated it "to be mutually agreed upon exercise of option".

When IBC subsequently tried to purchase the property under this option, Barrett said the option was unenforceable, given the date of settlement was not agreed to in the [[option contract]].

==Held==
The court held that as the date of settlement was uncertain, the option contract was not legally binding.

'''Bukhansansillajinheungwangsunsubi (Monument commemorating the border inspection Mt.Bukhansan by King Jinheung)''' is one of the monuments built in commemoration of the tours of King [[Jinheung of Silla]] (540-575) in Silla Era. The King visited this area after the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] was incorporated into [[silla]] territory. Originally, it was located at Bibong Peak on Mt.[[Bukhansan]], but now it is preserved at an exhibition hall in the [[National Museum of Korea]].
The monuments are made from polished stones and it stood on a natural rock in a two-story pedestal. Because upper parts of monuments are missing, the remaining monuments are 1.54 meter high and 0.69 meter width. There is an article, which has 12 lines and each line has 32 letters in Haeseoche (the square style of Chinese handwriting). The written contents contain why and how the King visited the area, and most of them are acclaiming King Jinheung's expansion of territory. Also the inscription included King’s achievements.

Its building date is not clear because the era name carved on the monument inscription is worn out. It is assumed that it might have been built between 22nd year (561) of King Jinheung and 29th year (568) of King Jinheung when he founded Hwangchoryeongbi Monument or later than it.
It is discovered and decoded in 16th year (1816) of King Sunjo in Joseon Era by [[Kim Jeonghui]] who was best calligraphers in Joseon dynasty. The historical fact that carved on the monuments are important material in studying the period of the Three States.

The '''Château d'Écouen''' is a historic [[château]] in the city of [[Écouen]], north of Paris, France, which today houses the '''Musée national de la Renaissance''' (National Museum of the Renaissance). 

The château was built between 1538 and 1550 by the architect [[Jean Bullant]] for [[Anne de Montmorency]], who was made ''[[Connétable de France]]'' in 1538. 

==History==

Anne de Montmorency had inherited the château in 1515, and his building campaigns were informed by his first-hand experience in overseeing royal works at [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] and [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]].&lt;ref&gt;See Brigitte Bedos Rezak, ''Anne De Montmorency: Seigneur de la Renaissance'', (Paris:Publisud) 1990, part III.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Jean Bullant]] is likely to have been the architect, for he was commissioned to design the Grand Constable's tomb, but it has also been suggested that [[Pierre Tâcheron]] had a hand in the château's design.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Ayers, ''The Architecture of Paris'', Fellbach: Edition Axel Menges, 2004, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[colossal order]] is rare in French architecture before Bullant; his characteristic use of it might be its first appearance in France here, on the pavilion on the court side.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalys Coope, "The Château of Montceaux-en-Brie", ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''22'''.1/2 (January - June 1959:71-87) p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Anne de Montmorency was a major patron of the arts in France, and a protector of  artists: his chapel was decorated with sculptures by [[Jean Goujon]], and [[Jean Bullant]], [[Barthélemy Prieur]], [[Bernard Palissy]]. Some of the [[Androuet du Cerceau]] family found protection and work at Écouen.&lt;ref&gt;Janet S. Byrne, "Monuments on Paper" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin''New Series, '''25'''.1 (Summer 1966, pp. 24-29) p 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Unhappily, no building accounts survive, so the precise sequence of the construction cannot be closely followed;&lt;ref&gt;A. Bertrand, ''Un château à Écouen'' (1974); [[John Cornforth]], "Château d'Écouen, Seine et Oise" ''[[Country Life Magazine]]'' 12 July 1984, pp 164-67.&lt;/ref&gt; panels of [[grisaille]] stained glass in the gallery of the west wing are dated 1542 and 1544,&lt;ref&gt;

Much of the glass from Écouen is now at the [[Musée Condé]], Chantilly. Michael Archer, "'Monmorency's&lt;!--"Monmorency" in the original--&gt; Sword' from Écouen" ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''129''' No. 1010 (May 1987, pp. 298-303) p 301.&lt;/ref&gt; and the east wing was paved in 1549-50. The building was frescoed and furnished during the 1550s, in the style of the [[School of Fontainebleau]].

Écouen was illustrated in engravings in [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]]'s ''Les Plus excellents bastiments de France'', 1576.

In 1787 the east (entrance) wing was demolished by the owner, the [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé]]. When he emigrated at the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], Château of Écouen fell to the State, as a "national property" ("''bien national''").

==Museum of the Renaissance==
[[File:Horloge du château d'Ecouen.JPG|thumb|"Clock of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]", Musée de la  Renaissance.]]
Following an idea of [[André Malraux]] the castle was thoroughly renovated by architects of the ''[[Monument Historique|Monuments Historiques]]'', after having served as a school for daughters of chevaliers of the [[Légion d'Honneur]], from 1807 to 1962,&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Rogers, ''Les demoiselles de la Légion d'honneur: Les maisons d'éducation de la Légion d'honneur au XIX siècle'' (Paris: Plon) 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to house the "Musée national de la Renaissance", comprising the [[French Renaissance|Renaissance]] objects of the collections of the [[Musée de Cluny]], in sympathetic surroundings. A series of small, highly focussed exhibitions have been staged at Écouen over the years since the museum fully opened in 1982.

The '''''Classic of Mountains and Seas''''' or '''''Shan Hai Jing''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shan Hai Jing|url=http://ctext.org/shan-hai-jing|website=Chinese Text Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly [[Wade-Giles|romanized]] as the '''''Shan-hai Ching''''', is a [[Chinese classic text]] and a compilation of mythic geography&lt;ref name="Flood Myths"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Mark Edward|title=The Flood Myths of Early China|date=2006|publisher=State University of New York|isbn=978-0-7914-6663-6|page=64|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6yCq-NEdKeUC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=%22Shan+Hai+Jing%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=t8kWVP2lIYbvaKLDgegK&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Shan%20Hai%20Jing%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |accessdate=February 8, 2012|title=China's Cosmopolitan Empire: the Tang dynasty, Vol. 4|author=Mark Edward Lewis|editor=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sq_J0Vkxor8C&amp;pg=PA202|edition=illustrated|volume=|series=|year=2009|location= |publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-03306-X|page=202|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and myth.

==Authorship==
The exact author(s) of the book and the time it was written are still undetermined. It was originally thought that mythical figures such as [[Yu the Great]] or [[Yi (husbandman)|Boyi]] wrote the book. However, the consensus among modern [[Sinology|Sinologists]] is that the book was not written at a single time by a single author, but rather by numerous people from the period of the [[Warring States period|Warring States]] to the beginning of the [[Han dynasty]].{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for "consensus among modern Sinologists" sentence|date=September 2014}}

The first known editor of the ''Classic'' was [[Liu Xiang (author)|Liu Xiang]] from the Western Han, who among other things cataloged the Han imperial library. Later, [[Guo Pu]], a scholar from the [[Jin dynasty (265-420)|Western Jin]], further annotated the work.

==Overview==
The book is not a narrative, as the "plot" involves detailed descriptions of locations in the cardinal directions of the ''Mountains'', ''Regions Beyond Seas'', ''Regions Within Seas'', and ''Wilderness''. The descriptions are usually of [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicines]], animals, and geological features. Many descriptions are very mundane, and an equal number are fanciful or strange. Each chapter follows roughly the same formula, and the whole book is repetitious in this way.

It contains many short myths, and most rarely exceed a paragraph. A famous ancient [[Chinese mythology|Chinese myth]] from this book is that of [[Yu the Great]], who spent years trying to control the [[Flood myth|deluge]]. The account of him is in the last chapter, chapter 18, in the 2nd to last paragraph (roughly verse 40). This account is a much more fanciful account than the depiction of him in the ''[[Classic of History]]''.

== Literature value ==
‘Shan Hai Jing’ is a book full of magical works. It has various kinds of contents. It has a rich knowledge of geography, mythology, folklore, history of science, religion, ethnology, medicine and other valuable information. Its academic value involves so many scientific areas. It largely and orderly records the features of natural geography and the content of human geographies, such as mountains, hydrology, animal, plant, mineral, national geography, economy, social culture. A lot of information can be explored if the reader searches deeply and carefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-WYYJ701.015.htm|title=中国神话的分类与『山海经』的文献价值--《文艺研究》1997年01期|website=www.cnki.com.cn|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geography ===
Some scholars believe that: "Shan Hai Jing" is China's first geography. "Shan Hai Jing" is not a purely geographical book, however, the geographical knowledge is in the top position. It orderly describes the geographical features by location, including nature geography and culture geography. First, "Shan Hai Jing" has a natural geographical description. This includes the record of many mountains, such as "the mountain of the court", "mountain of niuyang", "blue hill mountain", "Kei tail mountain" and so on, and each mountain is named according to the mountain landscape, these mountains also reflect the direction of the mountain; as well as an extremely rich hydrological record and rivers are mostly marked with the source. The beginning of the river can be in some foothills, and its injection is far away from this mountain. The narrator also noticed the full picture of the river streams. Despite the river routes were not recorded, but their approximate flow through region can be known through the route of tributaries to the mainstream such as Huanghe and Weishui. Secondly, it also recorded the human geography. For example, in the "sea" section, it records lots of regional social and cultural customs, economic development, scientific and technological achievements at that moment.&lt;ref&gt;http://iel.cass.cn/ztpd/shyj/shj/201106/t20110629_2762650.shtml 四面环海：《山海经·山 经》呈现的世界构想&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mythology ===
As a mythological literature, ‘Shan Hai Jing’ at least has three valuable facts:

1.  Different kinds of records of seven categories of ancient Chinese mythology.

2.  Left a reliable text in the relationship between the physical world and mythical world.

3.  The preservation of a vast number of primitive items with primitive cultural information, it contains the potential mythological value. 

It is inappropriate to classify Chinese mythology based on the principle of western mythology classification which is based on the presentation of human consciousness and spiritual growth process. It should classify based on the main contents, basic spirit, inner structure and important features which formed by above. ‘Shan Hai Jing’ does not have too many records about the mythology that is looking for the origins of content (the origins of world, tribes, and cultures), but it has many records of heroic mythology and tribal warfare and it reflects the basic feature of Chinese historical culture and the value orientation of cultural spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-WYYJ701.015.htm|title=中国神话的分类与『山海经』的文献价值--《文艺研究》1997年01期|website=www.cnki.com.cn|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===
‘Shan Hai Jing’ has rich and varied literary value and it can be explored from many aspects. Reader can discover, understand and interpret the literary value from the perspective of the influence of the traditional romantic creation literature, the expression of the original logic, the rich emotional experience in the humanistic care and the judgment of the pragmatism and all these can be understood by mythical thinking (ie, the original thinking). ‘Shan Hai Jing’ has a rich of mythology thinking, it has a huge and far-reaching impact in the tradition of the romantic literary. In-depth study of mythological thinking and reveal this impact is not only good for discovering the reasons for the creation of romantic literary, but it also helps clarify the development of various literary phenomena. 

There are at least three facts can explain how mythical thinking impacts the tradition of romantic literature:

1.  The impact of the rich intuitive imagination on the creation of romantic literature.

2.  The mythologies which contain abundant mythological thinking are always the creative material of romantic literature.

3.  The primitive concept of the life of mythical thinking profoundly impacts on the creation of romantic literary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.confucianism.com.cn/html/wenxue/13223802.html|title=中国国学网-- 试论《山海经》的神话思维对浪漫主义文学的影响（二）|website=www.confucianism.com.cn|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.confucianism.com.cn/html/wenxue/13223568.html|title=中国国学网-- 试论《山海经》的神话思维对浪漫主义文学的影响（一）|website=www.confucianism.com.cn|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
Lots of myths and legend in "Shan Hai Jing" are extremely rare materials for current religious studies. From these myths, not only present the activities of the wizard, but also the ancient nation's faith, worship and so on. There are a lot of magical animals recorded, these animals are mainly birds, animals, dragons, and snakes. They usually have some magical powers. These animals are probably the ancients' totem worship. According to "Classic of Regions Beyond the Seas: West", "Wuxian nation is north to Nvchou, the right-hand holds the green snake, and the red on the left". Snake may be the totem of Wuxian country. "Shan Hai Jing" is the critical material for ancient Chinese religious study.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.china.com.cn/aboutchina/txt/2009- 07/24/content_18194842.htm 探秘古书《山海经》的神奇世界&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Earlier Chinese scholars referred to it as a bestiary, but apparently assumed it was accurate. In fact the information in the book is mythological. It is not known why it was written or how it came to be viewed as an accurate geography book.

==Contents==
The ''Classic of Mountains and Rivers'' has 18 chapters (巻). Chapter 4 has 12 subsections (次一), 2 and 4 have four, and chapters 1 and 3 have three.

All 18 chapters can be classified into 4 categories: Classic of the Mountains (contents 5 chapters), Classic of the Seas (contents 8 chapters), Classic of the Great Wilderness (contents 4 chapters), and Classic of Regions Within the Seas (contents 1 chapter). It recorded more than 100 diplomatically related realms, 550 mountains and 300 rivers, along with the geographic and cultural information of the nearby realms. The Classic of Mountains and Seas also recorded up to 277 different animals. Scholars believe the records of animals in Classic of the Mountains are somewhat exaggerated due to the long history of people compiling them in different dynasties; yet they still have a certain degree of authority, because they were generally written by [[shaman|sorcerers]] and [[Fangshi]] based on the experiences they gained from their trips.

The ancient Chinese treated the ''Classic'' as a record of geography.&lt;ref&gt;《[[Confucius|孔子]] 家語·執轡篇》有「子夏曰：商聞《山書》曰：地東西為緯、南北為經 」一語，呂子方指出，「在《家語》成書時人們已承認《山海經》是一部地理書了 (Chinese scholar Zi Feng Lui pointed out, "during the era of Confucius, people already viewed the as a book of geography.")」（Zi Feng, Lui. (1997.) 讀〈山海經〉雜記. pg.5. ）&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Classic'' was classified under the category of geography in both [[Book of Sui]] and [[Wenxian Tongkao|Comprehensive Examination of Literature]] of [[Ma Duanlin|Duanlin Ma]]. It was also an important reference material of Chinese historians through the long history of China.

The ''Classic of Mountains and Seas'' is also the source and origin of the ancient [[Chinese mythology]]. Some of them are popular and well known in Asian culture, such as [[Kua Fu]], [[Nüwa]], [[Houyi]] and [[Yellow Emperor]]. There were up to 450 gods and deities mentioned in Classic and they used something called Jingmi (精米) or Jing (糈) which is similar to sorcery.

Chinese scholar Ming Hua Zhang claimed that the [[Zhulong (mythology)|Zhulong]], which was a mythical creature mentioned in Classic of the Great Wilderness: North, is symbolizing the [[Aurora|aurora (northern light)]].&lt;ref&gt;四川省社會科學院 (1986) 山海經新探 (pg 308-314) 成都市. 後收錄《學林漫錄》第8集&lt;/ref&gt; The Zhulong is (according to Classic) "red, with a human face and a snake body that is thousand mile long. It is the god of Zhong Mountain." He believes that this description matches with the characteristics of aurora.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12627">[[File:DOJ Cole Memo 2013.pdf|thumb|The Cole Memorandum was sent to all United States Attorneys and was formally titled "Guidance Regarding Marijuana Enforcement"]]
The '''Cole Memorandum''' was a [[United States Department of Justice]] memorandum issued August 29, 2013, by [[United States Deputy Attorney General]] [[James M. Cole]] during the [[presidency of Barack Obama]]. The memorandum, sent to all [[United States Attorneys]], governed federal prosecution of offenses related to [[marijuana]]. The memo stated that given its limited resources, the Justice Department would not enforce [[Controlled Substances Act|federal marijuana prohibition]] in states that "legalized marijuana in some form and ... implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of marijuana," except where a lack of federal enforcement would undermine federal priorities (such as preventing violence in marijuana cultivation and distribution, preventing [[Cannabis and impaired driving|cannabis impaired  driving]], and preventing marijuana revenues from going to gangs and cartels).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/3052013829132756857467.pdf Memorandum for All United States Attorneys: Guidance Regarding Federal Marijuana Enforcement], Office of the Deputy Attorney General (August 29, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Southall &amp; Jack Healy, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/30/us/politics/us-says-it-wont-sue-to-undo-state-marijuana-laws.html U.S. Won’t Sue to Reverse States' Legalization of Marijuana], ''New York Times'' (August 29, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cole Memorandum was rescinded by Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] in January 2018, during the [[presidency of Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=CNN|title=Sessions to nix Obama-era rules leaving states alone that legalize pot|author=Laura Jarrett|date=January 4, 2018|url=http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/04/politics/jeff-sessions-cole-memo/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT20180104&gt;{{citation|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Trump Administration Takes Step That Could Threaten Marijuana Legalization Movement|authors=Charlie Savage and Jack Healy|date=January 4, 2018|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/marijuana-legalization-justice-department-prosecutions.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issuance of the Cole Memorandum==
[[File:James M Cole.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[James M. Cole]]]]
On August 29, 2013, the Department of Justice published a memorandum authored by Cole which described a new set of priorities for federal prosecutors operating in states which had legalized the medical or other recreational use of marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cole memo|url=http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/sourcefiles/cole-DOJ-memo-aug-2013.pdf|website=medicalmarijuana.procon.org|publisher=ProCon|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Cole memo" followed a 2009 memorandum from Deputy Attorney General [[David W. Ogden]] directing U.S. Attorneys in the Western United States to "not focus federal resources in your States on individuals whose actions are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=United States Department of Justice|title=States of Nebraska and Oklahoma, plaintiffs v. State of Colorado - on motion for leave to file a bill of complaint brief for the United States as amicus curiae|authors=[[Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.]] et al.|date=December 16, 2015|url= https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/osg/briefs/2015/12/22/original_no._144_us_cvsg_br.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 memorandum represented a significant shift of government priorities away from strict enforcement of federal cannabis prohibition and toward a more hands-off approach in the case of "jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing marijuana in some form and that have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale and possession of marijuana." Indeed, Cole's memo went so far as to state that "a robust system may affirmatively address [federal] priorities by, for example, implementing effective measures to prevent diversion of marijuana outside the regulated system and to other states, prohibiting access to marijuana by minors, and replacing an illicit marijuana trade that funds criminal enterprises with a tightly regulated market in which revenues are tracked and accounted for." Since that date, although federal prosecutions have continued in some legalizing states (notably in the [[Kettle Falls Five]] case), the overall number of federal marijuana prosecutions in such states has declined.

==Review and rescission==
===2017 review===
[[File:DOJ Sessions memo 20180104.pdf|thumb|The single-page January 4, 2018 memorandum signed by Jeff Sessions rescinding the Cole Memo]]

States with legalized cannabis were concerned about the incoming [[Trump administration]]'s handling of the Cole Memo and their congressional representatives and governors saw Attorney General Jeff Sessions as adamantly opposed to its continuation.&lt;ref name=Isikoff/&gt;&lt;ref name=Labak/&gt; Anti-legalization groups like [[Smart Approaches to Marijuana]] requested a review or revocation of the memorandum.&lt;ref name=Mitchell2017/&gt; The federal government's position was vague, with the Deputy Attorney General [[Rod J. Rosenstein]] saying in mid-June "maybe there will be changes to it [the Cole Memorandum] in the future, but we're still operating under that policy".&lt;ref name=CNNwire/&gt;

Around June 2017, a Justice Department task force was convened to review the Cole Memo and other Obama-era decisions; it was headed by [[Michael Murray (attorney)|Michael Murray]], Counsel to Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein.&lt;ref name=Nelson2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nelson2017a/&gt; The committee's report was finalized June 27, 2017 and released to the public in August when it was found to have "no new policy recommendations", and recommended that the Trump Administration Attorney General "should evaluate whether to maintain, revise or rescind" the memo.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Huff, puff, pass? AG's pot fury not echoed by task force|publisher=Associated Press|author=Sadie Gurman|date=August 5, 2017|url=https://apnews.com/ad37624fcb8e485a8d57a013d48a227c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gurman2017b/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harris2017/&gt;

===2018 rescission===
The memorandum was rescinded by a one-page memo signed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on January 4, 2018.&lt;ref name=NYT20180104/&gt; Governors and United States Senators from several states including Alaska, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont and Washington immediately expressed displeasure at the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=The Cannabist|publisher=''[[The Denver Post]]''|title=“This is outrageous”: Politicians react vigorously to report that Sessions will rescind Cole memo|date=January 4, 2018|url=http://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/04/sessions-marijuana-cole-memo-politicians/95890/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Firewall appliances==
In general, a [[computer appliance]] is a computing device with a specific function and limited configuration ability, and a  [[software appliance]] is a set of [[software|computer programs]] that might be combined with just enough operating system (JeOS) for it to run optimally on industry standard [[computer hardware]] or in a virtual machine.

A firewall appliance is a combination of a [[Firewall (computing)|firewall software]] and an operating system that is purposely built to run a firewall system on a dedicated hardware or virtual machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Smith, Bob |author2=Hardin, John A |author3=Phillips, Graham |author4=Pierce, Bill | title=Linux Appliance Design: A Hands-On Guide to Building Linux Appliances | date= | publisher=No Starch Press | location= | isbn=1-59327-140-9 | pages=xvii | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVu0ax6C3uIC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=%22network+appliance%22+date:2003-2009&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=QE5mXmjxjbgmQtw11DsRYlnewnE#PPR17,M1  | accessdate=2008-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.networkworld.com/topics/sans.html SAN Data Center]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050502092915/http://www.networkworld.com/topics/sans.html |date=2005-05-02 }}''- Network World&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/routers/g/bldef_router.htm Routers]''- About.com&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
* embedded firewalls: very limited-capability programs running on a low-power CPU system,
* software-based firewall appliances: a system that can be run in independent hardware or in a virtualised environment as a [[virtual appliance]]
* hardware-based firewall appliances: a firewall appliance that runs on a hardware specifically built to install as a network device, providing enough network interfaces and CPU to serve a wide range of purposes. From protecting a small network (a few network ports and few megabits per second throughput) to protecting an enterprise-level network (tens of network ports and gigabits per second throughput).

The following table lists different firewall appliances.

==Non-Firewall extra features comparison==
Those features are not strictly firewall features, but are sometimes bundled with firewall software, or exist on the platform.

NOTE: Features are marked "yes" even if implemented as a separate module that comes with the platform on which firewall sits.

IDS: real-time firewall that logs/sniffs/blocks suspicious connections that are not part of rule-set.

VPN (Virtual Private Network) Types are: PPTP, L2TP, MPLS, IPsec, SSL/SSH.

Profile selection: The user can switch between sets of firewall settings, e.g. for use at work, at home, and on public connections.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26081">This article is a '''comparison of [[web server]] software.'''

The first web servers only supported static files, such as [[HTML]] (and images), but now they most commonly allow embedding of server side applications.

Some web application frameworks include simple HTTP servers.  For example [[Django (web framework)|the Django framework]] provides [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/#the-development-server runserver], and [[PHP]] has [http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php a built-in CLI SAPI server].  These are generally intended only for use during initial development.  A production server will require a more robust HTTP front-end such as one of the servers listed here.
&lt;!--

Please keep these in alphabetical order, and when adding (or removing) 
rows, please check all tables in the article.

==Overview==
&lt;!-- Do NOT add any items to this list that do not meet notability 
criteria, NO SPAM ALLOWED. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia and not a 
directory. We will remove it immediately! In each table, link 1st 
instance of terms, remove later WP:REPEATLINK(s). --&gt;

The '''Corpus Reformatorum''' ('''Corp. Ref., Cor. Ref., C.R., CR''') ( [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle (Saale)]], 1834 sqq.), is the general [[Latin]] title given to a large collection of [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] writings. This collection, which runs to 101 volumes, contains reprints of the collected works of [[John Calvin]], [[Philip Melanchthon]], and [[Huldrych Zwingli]], three of the leading Protestant reformers. Texts in the CR are written in either Latin, [[French language|French]] or [[German language|German]] (using [[Fraktur (typeface sub-classification)|''Fraktur'' typefaces]]).

A collection of sixteenth century Catholic writings, intended as a counterpart to the Corpus Reformatorum, was begun by Professor Joseph Greving  (1868–1919) of the [[University of Bonn]] in 1915. It was  announced that same year in the ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070817191347/http://egora.uni-muenster.de/fb2/thrv/aktuelles.shtml Theologische Revue]'' as a "Plan für ein Corpus Catholicorum" or "Plan for a [[Corpus Catholicorum (series)|Corpus Catholicorum]]" &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=0MVAkYQsKvsUdJtolEw&amp;id=q7MOAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22corpus+catholicorum%22&amp;dq=%22corpus+catholicorum%22&amp;pgis=1  The Fortnightly review], ed., Arthur Preuss, St. Louis, Missouri, Volume XXVI, No. 21, November 1, 1919, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Corpus Reformatorum was [[Foundation (charity)|founded]] through the efforts of German scholar and theologian [[Karl Gottlieb Bretschneider]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc02/htm/iv.v.cccx.htm Karl Gottlieb Bretschneider]. - Schaff-Herzog&lt;/ref&gt;  who began planning for it sometime after 1827. From 1834 until his death in 1848, Bretschneider also served as its primary editor.

'''''Defenders of the Faith: A Guidebook to Clerics and Paladins''''' is an optional rulebook for the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd edition|3rd edition]] of ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', and notable for its [[paperback|trade paperback]] format.

==Contents==
The guidebook provides supplemental information for characters belonging to the [[Cleric (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Cleric]] and [[Paladin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Paladin]] base classes. This book introduced Divine Feats, which are still used in version 3.5. This book also contained tips for creating and playing characters of the aforementioned class, as well as several prestige classes.

==Publication history==
The book was designed by [[Rich Redman]] and [[James Wyatt (game designer)|James Wyatt]], and was published in 2001 by [[Wizards of the Coast]].  Cover art was by [[Gerald Brom|Brom]], with interior art by [[Dennis Cramer]].

Although it was not updated to 3.5 Edition, most of the book's prestige classes were reintroduced in the 3.5 supplemental sourcebook ''[[Complete Divine]]''.

==Reception==
The reviewer from ''[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]'' found the advice on effectively playing clerics and paladins useful, even if it "rarely goes beyond the basics information", and found the section on special paladin mounts to be one of the most interesting areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=2289&lt;/ref&gt;

Defined in RFC 3401, RFC 3402, RFC 3403, RFC 3404, and RFC 3405.  The primary container used to hold DDDS information is the [[NAPTR record]].

From RFC 3401:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The '''Dynamic Delegation Discovery System''' is used to implement lazy binding of strings to data, in order to support dynamically configured delegation systems.  The DDDS functions by mapping some unique string to data stored within a DDDS Database by iteratively    applying string transformation rules until a terminal condition is reached.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

DDDS defines a mechanism for using [[Domain Name System|DNS]] as the database for arbitrary identifier schemes.

[[Telephone Number Mapping|ENUM]] (RFC 6116) is defined as a DDDS application to resolve phone numbers into data stored in [[Domain Name System|DNS]].

The '''Encyclopedia of Life''' ('''EOL''') is a free, online collaborative encyclopedia intended to document all of the 1.9 million [[Life|living]] [[species]] known to science. It is compiled from existing databases and from contributions by experts and non-experts throughout the world.&lt;ref name="EOL_Hist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/info/the_history_of_eol |title=EOL History |publisher=Eol.org |date=2012-02-28 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to build one "infinitely expandable" page for each species, including video, sound, images, graphics, as well as text.&lt;ref name="odling-smee2007"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070508/full/070508-7.html | title=Encyclopedia of Life launched | accessdate=2007-05-09 | last=Odling-Smee | first=Lucy | date=2007-05-09 | work=Nature | doi=10.1038/news070508-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Encyclopedia incorporates content from the [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]], which digitizes millions of pages of printed literature from the world's major natural history libraries. The project was initially backed by a US$50 million funding commitment, led by the [[MacArthur Foundation]] and the [[Sloan Foundation]], who provided US$20 million and US$5 million, respectively. The additional US$25 million came from five cornerstone institutions—the [[Field Museum]], [[Harvard University]], the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]], the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]], and the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The project was initially led by Jim Edwards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/info/22 |title=James Edwards - Encyclopedia of Life |publisher=Eol.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the development team by [[David J. Patterson|David Patterson]]. Today, participating institutions and individual donors continue to support EOL through financial contributions.

==Overview==
EOL went live on 26 February 2008 with 30,000 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/26/science/26ency.html |title=The Encyclopedia of Life, No Bookshelf Required | work=The New York Times |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2008-02-27 |first=Carl |last=Zimmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site immediately proved to be extremely popular, and temporarily had to revert to demonstration pages for two days when over 11 million views of it were requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | agency=Associated Press | title=Life Encyclopedia Debut Too Popular to Stay "Live" | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/02/080227-AP-encyclopedi.html  | work=National Geographic | date=February 27, 2008 | accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site relaunched on 5 September 2011 with a redesigned interface and tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/info/sept_5 |title=New Version of Encyclopedia of Life Now Available – Encyclopedia of Life |publisher=Eol.org |date=2011-09-05 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new version – referred to as EOLv2 – was developed in response to requests from the general public, citizen scientists, educators and professional biologists for a site that was more engaging, accessible and personal. EOLv2 is redesigned to enhance usability and encourage contributions and interactions among users. It is also internationalized with interfaces provided for [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] language speakers. On 16 January 2014, EOL launched TraitBank, a searchable, open digital repository for organism traits, measurements, interactions and other facts for all taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/content/traitbank-practical-semantics-organism-attribute-data |title=TraitBank: Practical semantics for organism attribute data |publisher=Semantic-web-journal.net |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative's Executive Committee includes senior officers from the Atlas of Living Australia, the [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]] consortium, the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], [[CONABIO]], [[Field Museum]], [[Harvard University]], the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] (Library of Alexandria), [[MacArthur Foundation]], [[Marine Biological Laboratory]], [[Missouri Botanical Garden]], [[Sloan Foundation]], and the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6638017.stm | title=Scientists compile 'book of life' | accessdate=2007-05-09 | date=2007-05-09 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/info/meet_the_team#executive |title=Meet the Team: Executive Committee |publisher=EOL |date=2012-02-28 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intention  ==
Information about many species is already available from a variety of sources, in particular about the [[megafauna]]. Gathering currently available data on all 1.9 million species will take about 10 years.&lt;ref name="rc1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/Science-Sante/2007/05/09/001-encyclopedie-vie.shtml?ref=rss | title=Encyclopédie de la vie: Une arche de Noé virtuelle! | date=9 May 2007 | work=Radio-Canada | accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011|09}}, EOL had information on more than 700,000 species available, along with more than 600,000 photos and millions of pages of scanned literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/info/sept_5 |title=New Version of the Encyclopedia of Life Now Available |publisher=Eol.org |date=2011-09-05 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative relies on indexing information compiled by other efforts, including the Sp2000 and [[Integrated Taxonomic Information System|ITIS]] [[Catalogue of Life]], [[Fishbase]] and the Assembling Tree of Life project of [[National Science Foundation|NSF]], AmphibiaWeb, Mushroom explorer, microscope, etc. The initial focus has been on living species but will later include extinct species. As the discovery of new species is expected to continue (currently at about 20,000 per year), the encyclopedia will continue to grow. As taxonomy finds new ways to include species discovered by molecular techniques, the rate of new additions will increase, particularly in respect to the microbial work of (eu)bacteria, archaebacteria and viruses.

EOL's goal is to serve as a resource for the general public, enthusiastic amateurs, educators, students and professional scientists from around the world.&lt;ref name="EOL_Hist"/&gt;

The Encyclopedia of Life has content partners around the world who share information through the EOL platform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/content_partners |title=EOL Content Partners |publisher=Eol.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Wikipedia and [[Flickr]].

By April 2011, over 500 people had been taken into custody and nearly 300 formally charged with membership of what prosecutors described as "the Ergenekon terrorist organization", which they claimed had been responsible for virtually every act of political violence—and controlled every militant group—in Turkey over the last 30 years.&lt;ref name=analyst&gt;Gareth Jenkins [http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/inside/turkey/2011/110404B.html THE FADING MASQUERADE: ERGENEKON AND THE POLITICS OF JUSTICE IN TURKEY] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427163058/http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/inside/turkey/2011/110404B.html |date=27 April 2012 }}, in Turkey Analyst, Vol. 4 No. 7 of 4 April 2011; accessed on 18 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
An organization named "Ergenekon" has been talked about since the [[Susurluk scandal]], which exposed a similar gang. However, it is said that Ergenekon has undergone serious changes since then. The first person to publicly talk about the organization was retired naval officer [[Erol Mütercimler]], who spoke of such an organization in 1997.&lt;ref name=mutercimler&gt;{{cite news

Mütercimler and others, however, draw a distinction between the Ergenekon of today and the original one, which they equate with the [[Counter-Guerrilla]]; [[Operation Gladio]]'s Turkish branch.&lt;ref name=can-bizim&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/Default.aspx?aType=YazarDetay&amp;ArticleID=891778&amp;AuthorID=75&amp;Date=10.07.2008|accessdate=2008-07-10|title=Bizim Ergenekon|department=Güncel

Another position is that while some of the suspects may be guilty of something, there is no organization to which they are all party, and that the only thing they have in common is opposition to the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]].&lt;ref name=berlinski&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/45872,features,ergenekon-turkeys-conspiracy-to-end-them-all-claire-berlinski

== Discovery ==
Although the investigation was officially launched in 2007, the existence of the organization was known beforehand. The files on Ergenekon were said to be discovered after a spy called [[#Tuncay Güney's testimony (2001)|Tuncay Güney]] was detained in March 2001 for petty fraud. Some say the crime was a ploy to set the investigation in motion. A police search of his house turned up the six sacks of evidence on which the indictment is based.

One month later, a columnist on good terms with the government, [[Fehmi Koru]], was the first to break the news,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/Default.aspx?aType=HaberDetay&amp;ArticleID=894697&amp;Date=18.07.2008&amp;Kategori=siyaset

The indictment also suggests questionable connections between Ergenekon and the outlawed [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) and the [[Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front]] (DHKP/C), raising some suspicions that Ergenekon might have played a role in inciting ethnic hatred between Turks and Kurds and increasing sectarian tensions between Sunnis and Alevis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starkibris.net/international/index.asp?haberID=1749 Shocking Ergenekon Indictment] Star International of 8 August 2008; accessed on 16 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gülen movement]]-affiliated ''[[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman]]'' newspaper quoted a senior intelligence officer, Bülent Orakoğlu, as having said that the PKK, Dev Sol, [[Hezbollah (Turkey)|Hezbollah]], and [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] are artificial organizations set up by the network, and that [[Abdullah Öcalan]] himself was an Ergenekon member.&lt;ref name=apo_ergenekon&gt;{{cite news

Gülen movement's possible involvement in Ergenekon plot has always been a debate of issue,&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt; which critics have characterized as "a pretext" by the government "to neutralize dissidents" in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagaptay.com/5593/ergenekon-behind-turkey-witch-hunt|title=Behind Turkey's Witch Hunt|first=Soner|last=Cagaptay|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, seven Turkish journalists were arrested, including [[Ahmet Şık]], who had been writing a book, "Imamin Ordusu" (''[[The Imam's Army]]''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/05/turkey-censorship-ahmet-sik-perrier Turkish authorities launch raids to censor book before publication] in the Guardian of 5 April 2011; accessed on 11 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; which alleges that the Gülen movement has infiltrated the country's security forces. As Şık was taken into police custody, he shouted, "Whoever touches it [the movement] gets burned!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |  url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/04/world/europe/04turkey.htmll?_r=1%20 | work=The New York Times | first=Şebnem | last=Arsu | title=7 More Journalists Detained in Turkey | date=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his arrest, drafts of the book were confiscated and its possession was banned. Şık has also been charged with being part of the alleged Ergenekon plot, despite being an investigator of the plot before his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;Details can be found in English on the site of [http://www.tuerkeiforum.net/enw/index.php/Ahmet_%C5%9E%C4%B1k:_The_Army_of_the_Imam the Democratic Turkey Forum]; accessed on 5 April 2001. In the footnotes to translated passages of the book you can find other works on the subject.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a reply, Abdullah Bozkurt, from the Gülen movement newspaper ''[[Today's Zaman]]'', accused Ahmet Şık of not being "an investigative journalist" conducting "independent research," but of hatching "a plot designed and put into action by the terrorist network itself."&lt;ref&gt;The alleged terrorist network is the [[Ergenekon (organization)|Ergenekon organization]], see [http://www.todayszaman.com/columnist-239479-ergenekon-gulen-and-media-freedom.html Article of 29 March 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201055315/http://www.todayszaman.com/columnist-239479-ergenekon-gulen-and-media-freedom.html |date=1 February 2016 }}; accessed on 5 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Gareth H. Jenkins]], a Senior Fellow of the [[Central Asia-Caucasus Institute &amp; Silk Road Studies Joint Center]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;From the outset, the pro-AKP media, particularly the newspapers and television channels run by the Gülen Movement such as ''Zaman'', ''Today's Zaman'' and Samanyolu TV, have vigorously supported the Ergenekon investigation. This has included the illegal publication of "evidence" collected by the investigators before it has been presented in court, misrepresentations and distortions of the content of the indictments and smear campaigns against both the accused and anyone who questions the conduct of the investigations.&lt;br /&gt;
There have long been allegations that not only the media coverage but also the Ergenekon investigation itself is being run by Gülen's supporters. In August 2010, Hanefi Avcı, a right-wing police chief who had once been sympathetic to the Gülen Movement, published a book in which he alleged that a network of Gülen's supporters in the police were manipulating judicial processes and fixing internal appointments and promotions. On September 28, 2010, two days before he was due to give a press conference to present documentary evidence to support his allegations, Avcı was arrested and charged with membership of an extremist leftist organization. He remains in jail. On March 14, 2011, Avcı was also formally charged with being a member of the alleged Ergenekon gang.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/inside/turkey/2011/110404B.html |title=Central Asia-Caucasus Institute and Silk Road Studies Program |publisher=Silkroadstudies.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427163058/http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/inside/turkey/2011/110404B.html |archivedate=27 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Gülen movement has also been implicated in what both Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] as well as the opposition [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) have said were illegal court decisions against members of the [[Turkish military]], including many during the Ergenekon investigation.&lt;ref name="NYtimes2-27-2014"&gt;{{cite news | title = Turkish Leader Disowns Trials That Helped Him Tame Military | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/27/world/europe/turkish-leader-disowns-trials-that-helped-him-tame-military.html?hpw&amp;rref=world | last = Arango | first = Tim | date = 26 February 2014 | accessdate = 27 February 2014 | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | quote = In 2005, years before the trials, a man affiliated with the Gulen movement approached Eric S.

[[File:Stories of beowulf grendel.jpg|thumb|An illustration of Grendel by J. R. Skelton from ''Stories of Beowulf''. Grendel is described as "Very terrible to look upon."]]
'''Grendel''' is a character in the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' (AD 700–1000). He is one of the poem's three [[antagonist]]s (along with [[Grendel's mother]] and the [[The Dragon (Beowulf)|dragon]]), all aligned in opposition against the protagonist [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]]. Grendel is feared by all but Beowulf. Grendel is described as descended from the lineage of the Biblical figure Cain, from Genesis 4 of the Bible. He is usually depicted as a [[monster]] or a [[giant]], although his status as a monster, giant, or other form of supernatural being is not clearly described in the poem and thus remains the subject of scholarly debate. 

In [[John Gardner (American writer)|John Gardner]]'s book [[Grendel (novel)|''Grendel'']] (1971),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=John|title=Grendel|date=1971|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=0-345-27509-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grendel has more human qualities and the book is narrated from his perspective.

[[File:Beowulf - mearc stapa.jpg|thumb|250px|Beowulf's author often uses various substitute phrases for Grendel's name like this one, the "mark-stepper," an inhabitant of the borderland.]]
Grendel is originally found in the poem ''Beowulf,'' which is contained in the ''[[Nowell Codex]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heaney|first1=Seamus|title=Beowulf|date=2012|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-91249-4|pages=41-108|edition=9th|ref=The Norton Anthology of English Literature Volume A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grendel, being cursed as the descendant of the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Cain]], is "harrowed" by the sounds of singing that come every night from the [[Mead hall|mead-hall]] of [[Heorot]] built by King Hrothgar, describing the "Almighty's" creation of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Heaney, 2012, lines 87, 92&lt;/ref&gt; He is unable to bear it anymore and attacks Heorot. Grendel continues to attack the Hall every night for twelve years, killing its inhabitants and making this magnificent mead-hall unusable. Beowulf hears of these attacks and leaves the [[Geats]] to destroy Grendel.  He is welcomed by King Hrothgar, who gives a banquet in celebration. Afterwards Beowulf and his warriors bed down in the mead hall to await the inevitable attack of the creature. Grendel stalks outside the building for a time, spying the warriors inside. He then makes a sudden attack, bursting the door with his fists and continuing through the entry. The first warrior Grendel finds is still asleep, so he seizes the man and devours him. Grendel grabs a second warrior, but is shocked when the warrior grabs back with fearsome strength. As Grendel attempts to disengage, the reader discovers that Beowulf is that second warrior.  He has chosen not to use a weapon because he heard Grendel fights without one; this choice is what wins him the battle, because Grendel has a charm that protects him from every weapon. A battle ensues, with Beowulf's warriors attempting to aid in the melee. Finally Beowulf tears off Grendel's arm, mortally wounding the creature. Grendel flees but dies in his marsh-den. There, Beowulf later engages in a fierce battle with [[Grendel's mother]], over whom he triumphs. Following her death, Beowulf finds Grendel's corpse and removes his head, which he keeps as a trophy. Beowulf then returns to the surface and to his men at the "ninth hour" (l. 1600, "nōn", about 3&amp;nbsp;pm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Jack |last=George |title= Beowulf: A Student Edition |page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returns to Heorot, where a grateful [[Hrothgar]] showers him with gifts.

==Scholarship==

===Tolkien===
In 1936, [[J. R. R. Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]'' discussed Grendel and the dragon in ''Beowulf''.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, J.R.R. "Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics." In Daniel Donoghue (ed.), ''Beowulf a Verse Translation''. Norton, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;103–130.
&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien argues that "the evil spirits took visible shape" in Grendel and the dragon; however, the author's concern is focused on Beowulf.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;119&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that while Grendel has Christian origins as the descendant of Cain, he "cannot be dissociated from the creatures of northern myth."&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;122&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues for the importance of Grendel's role in the poem as an "eminently suitable beginning" that sets the stage for Beowulf's fight with the dragon: "Triumph over the lesser and more nearly human is cancelled by defeat before the older and more elemental."&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;128.&lt;/ref&gt; This essay was the first work of scholarship in which [[Anglo-Saxon literature]] was seriously examined for its literary merits – not just scholarship about the origins of the English language, or what historical information could be gleaned from the text, as was popular in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Tolkien wrote his own translation of [[Beowulf]] entitled, [[Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary|''Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary together with Sellic Spell'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tolkien |first1=J. R. R. |last2=Tolkien |first2=Christpher|title=Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary: together with Sellic Spell|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1920 and 1926.

===Debate over description===
During the following decades, the exact description of Grendel became a source of debate for scholars. Indeed, because his exact appearance is never directly described in [[Old English]] by the original ''Beowulf'' poet, part of the debate revolves around what is known, namely his descent from the biblical [[Cain and Abel|Cain]] (who was the first murderer in the [[Bible]]). Grendel is referred to as a ''sceadugenga'' – ''shadow walker'', ''night goer'' – given that the monster was repeatedly described to be in the shroud of darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, ''Anglo-Saxon Poems'', p.&amp;nbsp;48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heyne, ''Beowulf'', p.&amp;nbsp;129; p.&amp;nbsp;228, s.v. "genga"; p.&amp;nbsp;298, s.v. "scadu-genga"&lt;/ref&gt;

====Debate over Grendel's nature====
Some scholars have linked Grendel's descent from Cain to the monsters and giants of ''the [[Cain tradition]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Williams|title = Cain and Beowulf: A Study in Secular Allegory|location = Toronto|publisher = [[University of Toronto Press]]|year = 1982|first = David|author-link = David Williams (medievalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seamus Heaney]], in his translation of ''Beowulf'', writes in lines 1351–1355 that Grendel is vaguely human in shape, though much larger:

:... the other, warped
:in the shape of a man, moves beyond the pale
:bigger than any man, an unnatural birth
:called Grendel by the country people
:in former days.&lt;ref&gt;Heaney, Seamus. ''Beowulf'' lines 1351–1355.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaney's translation of lines 1637–1639 also notes that Grendel's disembodied head is so large that it takes four men to transport it. Furthermore, in lines 983–989, when Grendel's torn arm is inspected, Heaney describes it as being covered in impenetrable scales and horny growths:

:Every nail, claw-scale and spur, every spike
:and welt on the hand of that heathen brute
:was like barbed steel. Everybody said
:there was no honed iron hard enough
:to pierce him through, no time proofed blade
:that could cut his brutal blood caked claw&lt;ref&gt;Heaney, Seamus. ''Beowulf'' lines 983–989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Bammesgerber looks closely at line 1266 where Grendel's ancestry is said to be the "misbegotten spirits"&lt;ref&gt;''Beowulf.'' Translated by Seamus Heaney. ''Norton Anthology of English Literature,'' 9th ed., vol. A, edited by Stephen 
Greenblatt, Norton, 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;41–108&lt;/ref&gt; that sprang from Cain after he was cursed. He argues that the words in Old English, ''geosceaftgasta,'' should be translated "the great former creation of spirits."&lt;ref&gt;Bammesberger, Alfred.  "Grendel’s Ancestry."  Notes &amp; Queries, vol. 55, is. 3, 1 September 2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;257–260. {{doi|10.1093/notesj/gjn112}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Peter Dickinson]] (1979) argued that seeing as the considered distinction between man and beast at the time the poem was written was simply man's [[bipedal]]ism, the given description of Grendel being man-like does not necessarily imply that Grendel is meant to be humanoid, going as far as stating that Grendel could easily have been a bipedal dragon.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, Peter. ''The Flight of Dragons'' ch.&amp;nbsp;10 "Beowulf". New English Library, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars such as Kuhn (1979) have questioned a monstrous description, stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are five disputed instances of [[wikt:aglæca|āglǣca]] [three of which are in ''Beowulf'', lines] 649, 1269, 1512 ... In the first ... the referent can be either Beowulf or Grendel. If the poet and his audience felt the word to have two meanings – ''monster'' and ''hero'' – the ambiguity would be troublesome; but if by āglǣca they understood a ''fighter'', the ambiguity would be of little consequence, for battle was destined for both Beowulf and Grendel and both were fierce fighters (216–217).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

O'Keefe has suggested that Grendel resembles a [[Berserker]], because of numerous associations that seem to point to this possibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/berserke.shtml Berserker]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sonya R. Jensen argues for an identification between Grendel and Agnar, son of Ingeld, and suggests that the tale of the first two monsters is actually the tale of Ingeld, as mentioned by Alcuin in the 790s. The tale of Agnar tells how he was cut in half by the warrior Bothvarr Bjarki (''Warlike little Bear''), and how he died ''with his lips separated into a smile''. One major parallel between Agnar and Grendel would thus be that the monster of the poem has a name perhaps composed of a combination of the words ''gren'' and ''daelan''. The poet may be stressing to his audience that Grendel "died laughing", or that he was ''gren-dael[ed]'' or "grin-divid[ed]", after having his arm torn off at the shoulder by Beowulf, whose name means ''bee-wolf'' or ''bear''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jensen|first=S R|title=Beowulf and the Monsters|year=1998|publisher=ARRC|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hameau de la Reine''' ({{IPA-fr|amo də la ʁɛn}}, ''The Queen's [[Hamlet (place)|Hamlet]]'') is a rustic retreat in the park of the [[Château de Versailles]] built for [[Marie Antoinette]] in 1783 near the [[Petit Trianon]] in [[Yvelines]], France. It served as a private meeting place for the Queen and her closest friends, a place of leisure. Designed by the Queen's favoured architect, [[Richard Mique]] with the help of the painter [[Hubert Robert]], it contained a meadowland with lakes and streams, a classical Temple of Love on an island with fragrant shrubs and flowers, an octagonal belvedere, with a neighbouring grotto and cascade. There are also various buildings in a rustic or vernacular style, inspired by Norman or Flemish design, situated around an irregular pond fed by a stream that turned a mill wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Picturesque Garden in Europe | author=Hunt, John Dixon | year=2002 | publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson | location=London | pages=130 | isbn=0-500-51085-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building scheme included a [[farmhouse]], (the farm was to produce milk and eggs for the queen), a [[dairy]], a [[dovecote]], a [[boudoir]], a [[barn]] that burned down during the French Revolution, a [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] and a tower in the form of a lighthouse. Each building is decorated with a garden, an orchard or a flower garden. The largest and most famous of these houses is the "Queen's House", connected to the Billiard house by a wooden gallery, at the center of the village. A working farm was close to the idyllic, fantasy-like setting of the Queen’s Hamlet.

The ''hameau'' is the best-known of a series of [[French landscape garden|rustic garden constructions built at the time]], notably the [[Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé|Prince of Condé]]'s [[Hameau de Chantilly]] (1774–1775) which was the inspiration for the Versailles hamlet.&lt;ref&gt;"Le Hameau" ["The Hamlet"]. Chateau de Versailles. N.p., n.d. Web. 3 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[model farm]]s, operating under principles espoused by the [[Physiocrats]], were fashionable among the French aristocracy at the time. One primary purpose of the ''hameau'' was to add to the ambiance of the ''Petit Trianon'', giving the illusion that it was deep in the countryside rather than within the confines of Versailles. The rooms at the ''hameau'' allowed for more intimacy than the grand salons at Versailles or at the ''Petit Trianon''.

Abandoned after the [[French Revolution]], it was renovated in the late 1990s and is open to the public.

== History and construction ==
Inspired by a wave of naturalism in art, architecture, and garden design, the Hameau de la Reine was constructed between 1782 and 1783. The garden surroundings of the Petit Trianon, of which the ''hameau de la Reine'' is an extension, began their transformation from formal pattern gardens. Under Louis XV it had been an arboretum and the new arrangements eliminated this famous botanical garden, replacing it with a more informal "natural" garden of winding paths, curving canals and lakes under the direction of Antoine Richard, gardener to the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;William Howard Adams, ''The French Garden 1500–1800''  (New York: Braziller) 1979, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Mique modified the landscape design to provide vistas of lawn to west and north of the Petit Trianon, encircled by belts of trees. Beyond the lake to the north, the ''hameau'' was sited like a garden stage set, initially inspired in its grouping and vernacular building by Dutch and Flemish genre paintings, philosophically influenced by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s cult of "nature", and reflecting exactly contemporary picturesque garden principles set forth by [[Claude-Henri Watelet]]&lt;ref&gt;Watelet's  ''Essai sur les Jardins'' also appeared in 1774. Watelet was a rich amateur who had studied briefly with [[Hubert Robert]], whose name is invariably invoked with the ''hameau'', with the landscape setting of the [[Château de Méréville|Méréville]] and other early garden essays in the ''genre pittoresque''.&lt;/ref&gt; and by ideas of the ''[[philosophes]]'', their "radical notions co-opted into innocent forms of pleasure and ingenious decoration" as William Adams has pointed out.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1979:121.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists played a more direct role in French [[picturesque]] than they probably had done in England,&lt;ref name="Hunt – Picturesque"&gt;{{cite book | pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; as can be seen by Hubert Robert's involvement.

=== Stylistic influence and prototypes ===
The stylistic design of the Hameau de la Reine was influenced by the hameau de Chantilly, a similarly rustic "village" with half-timbered façades and reed-thatched roofs.&lt;ref&gt;Van Der Kemp, Gérald. Versailles. Paris: Vendome, 1978. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A wave of naturalism and an affinity towards the "simple" life was sweeping across France in the 18th century. French aristocrats loved to act like shepherds and shepherdesses, while still enjoying the comforts of their social position. This idealism of the natural life came from the extremely influential works of Jean Jacques Rousseau, who emphasized Nature. The hamlet seemed completely rustic and natural from the outside, while the Rococo interior provided the desired comfort and luxury of the Queen and her friends.&lt;ref&gt;"The Petit Hameau." Marie Antoinette and the French Revolution. PBS, 2006. Web. 3 Mar. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction and architectural design ===
The Petit Trianon, originally built for Madame de Pompadour under the reign of Louis XV, was a private domain. Encircling the Petit Trianon was the Jardin Anglais (the English Garden), a wilder style of garden that arose in response to traditional French manicured gardens. The Hamlet is built in a hybrid architectural style. A combination of Norman, Flemish, and French styles came together to create the village full of sylvan charm. Typically Norman, the cottages have half-timbered façades and reed coverings. The brick, "sparrow-stepped" gables and the stained glass windows are distinctly Flemish. The roofs covered with dormer windows and the plaster-covered façades, though, were native to France.&lt;ref&gt;Lablaude, Pierre-André. The Gardens of Versailles. Paris: Scala, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The French architect [[Richard Mique]] designed and built the Hamlet with the garden in mind, and it is almost an extension of the Jardin Anglais. His buildings lend themselves to the surrounding landscape in their arrangement around a small lake, giving the illusion of a perfect and functioning village.

The barn, occasionally used as a ballroom, was destroyed during the French Revolution, while the rest of the houses survived the tumultuous period of French history.

=== Life at the Queen’s Hamlet ===
Courtiers at the Palace of Versailles constantly surrounded Marie Antoinette, leaving her in need of a refuge. She escaped the responsibilities and structure of court life to her private estate. The Hamlet was part of Marie Antoinette’s estate, and she enjoyed dressing as a young shepherdess or milkmaid and acting like a peasant, while surrounded by the comforts of a royal lifestyle. This unintentional mockery of the economically depressed French peasants helped build the resentment towards the monarchy among the French people, eventually leading to the French Revolution.

While still in power, Marie Antoinette enjoyed acting as a tableau vivant, as if she were part of a painting. She brought her idyllic, picturesque village to life by stocking the barn with animals, and bringing in "simple" people, such as milkmaids and herdsmen, to act like residents of the Hamlet. Marie Antoinette would stroll around her perfect world in simple peasants' garb with her children, part of an idealized Nature. Her closest friends joined her in her ornamental village, where they also enjoyed pretending to live a simple life. Their isolation at the Hameau caused suspicion among the French people. Already resentful of Marie Antoinette for her profligate spending in times of economic depression, the secrecy surrounding her life of amusement led to suspected hedonism and scandal.&lt;ref&gt;Pérouse de Montclos, Jean-Marie. ''Versailles''. Trans. John Goodman. Paris: Abbeville, 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It was rumored that Marie Antoinette had lovers, and they met at the Hameau, a surreal place that was completely her own. The extravagance and subtle mockery of peasant life did not help Marie Antoinette’s already suffering image.

In spite of its idyllic appearance, the hamlet was a real farm, fully managed by a farmer appointed by the Queen, with its vineyards, fields, orchards and vegetable gardens producing fruit and vegetables consumed at the royal table. Animals from Switzerland, according to the instructions of the Queen, were raised on the farm. For this reason the place was often called "the Swiss hamlet".

The Queen sought refuge in peasant life, milking cows or sheep, which were carefully maintained and cleaned by the servants. She preferred to wear simple clothing uncharacteristic to the frivolous fashion of the French Court while at the ''hameau'', and often dressed in a sun hat and informal muslin dress, a [[Polonaise (clothing)|Polonaise]] gown, or a ''Chemise à la Reine''. The ''chemise'', worn without [[Pannier (clothing)|panniers]] and with a high waistline, was first worn by women in warmer climates in the colonies and was popularised amongst the aristocracy through Marie Antoinette. The simplicity and high waistline of the garment would lay the foundations for [[1795–1820 in Western fashion|Regency/Empire fashion]] in the later decades during and after the Revolution. The Queen would often wear a straw [[Bergère hat]] and a [[fichu]] alongside a Polonaise gown; the term Polonaise referring to the dress of Polish shepherdesses who would hoist and drape their overskirts in two or three loops in order to keep their dress clean while farming. Marie Antoinette's wardrobe was generally imitative of the peasantry of the period.

Marie Antoinette used buckets of Sèvres porcelain specially decorated with her arms by the Manufacture Royale. The place was completely enclosed by fences and walls, and only intimates of the Queen were allowed to access it. During the Revolution, "a misogynistic, nationalistic and class-driven polemic swirled around the ''hameau'', which had previously seemed a harmless agglomeration of playhouses in which to act out a [[François Boucher|Boucher]] pastorale."&lt;ref&gt;Rosasco, in review of Lablaude 1995, in ''The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'' '''55'''.4  (December 1996, pp. 475-476) p 476.&lt;/ref&gt; The queen was accused by many of being frivolous, and found herself a target of innuendos, jealousy and gossip throughout her reign. Although for Marie Antoinette, the ''hameau'' was an escape from the regulated life of the Court at Versailles, in the eyes of French people, the queen seemed to be merely amusing herself.

== Cottages ==
Marie Antoinette’s Hamlet consisted of a variety of different cottages and buildings, all built around a small lake. Each building had a specific function, and each played its part in the daily life of the Hamlet. The twelve cottages constructed in the hamlet can be divided into two groups: five were reserved for use by the Queen; the other seven had a functional purpose and were used effectively for agriculture. Marie Antoinette had her own house, connected to the pool. Nearby was her boudoir. The mill and the dairy received frequent visits from the Queen.

=== Queen’s House and Billiard Room ===
''The Queen's house and billiard room'' is situated in the middle of the Hamlet, and it is the largest and most important building. Its construction is innovative: two rustic buildings are connected by a covered gallery that is curved in a half-moon shape. A spiral staircase offers access to the second floor on one end of the house. These buildings included the Queen’s private chambers, as well as her salons and her parlors. The upper level comprises the petit salon, also known as the "room of the nobles", an anteroom in the form of a "[[Chinoiserie#Interior decoration|Chinese cabinet]]" and the large living room with wood panelling hung with tapestries of Swiss style in embroidered wool. From the room's six windows, the Queen could easily control the work fields and activity of the hamlet. Access is via the staircase of the round tower. At the center of the room is a harpsichord which Marie Antoinette loved to play. On the ground floor, paved with single slabs of stone, the building includes a backgammon room and a dining room. The lyre-backed chairs in mahogany lined with green Morocco, were created by [[Georges Jacob]]. To the left, another building housing the billiard room is connected to the Queen's house by a wooden gallery decorated with trellises and twelve hundred St. Clement [[Faience#French and northern European faïence|faience]] pots, marked in the blue figures of the Queen. Upstairs, a small apartment which seems to have been inhabited by the architect Richard Mique, has five rooms including a library. Despite the rustic appearance of facades, the interior finish and furnishings are luxurious and have been created by the carpenter Georges Jacob and the [[ébéniste]] [[Jean-Henri Riesener]].

=== Boudoir ===
[[File:Boudoir au Hameau de la Reine (1).jpg|thumb|right|Boudoir]]
The ''[[Boudoir]]'', (4.6 x 5.2 metres) is the smallest structure, and it was nicknamed "the little house of the Queen." Marie Antoinette would retire here by herself, or else with one or two of her friends. The boudoir was altered slightly during the Second Empire, but its small construction has remained to this day.

=== Mill ===
[[File:Hameau de la Reine 16.jpg|thumb|right|Mill]]
''The Mill'', built and fitted from 1783 to 1788, was never used for grinding grain,  contrary to what is often argued. The wheel is driven by a stream derived from the Grand Lake and is only a decorative element. No mechanism or wheel were installed in the factory. The interior decoration was simple and neat. This structure is one of the most picturesque of the Hamlet. Each façade of the building is decorated slightly differently. This mill also served as a laundry.&lt;ref&gt;Arizzoli-Clémentel, Pierre. Views and Plans of the Petit Trianon. Paris: Alain de Gourcuff Éditeur, 1998. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marlborough Tower ===
[[File:033Hameau de la Reine.jpg|thumb|right|Marlborough Tower]]
This circular tower on the shores of the lake is mainly decorative. It was originally called "The Fishery Tower." It was created after a popular lullaby from the era. The basement is used for storage, but the top part of the tower has a fairytale-esque design.

=== Réchauffoir ===
[[File:Le réchauffoir du Hameau de la Reine - DSC 0356.jpg|thumb|right|The réchauffoir]]
The ''warming room'' is recessed at the rear of the Queen's house. It has a stone interior and included a large kitchen, a bakery, a fireplace and pantry, also linen and silverware.  It was used to prepare the dishes for dinners given by the Queen in the house or mill.

=== Dairy ===
[[File:Intérieur - Laiterie.jpg|thumb|Interior – Laiterie]]
There were originally two dairies: one in which the dairy products were made, and one in which the Queen would taste them. The Preparation Dairy was destroyed during the First Empire. Each were designed with sanitation in mind: the rooms are light colored marble, which gives the impression of cleanliness.

=== Farm ===
Valy Bussard, the farmer, came to the Hameau to run a functional farm. Decorated in a rustic style, ''the farm'' included three bedrooms, a kitchen, and a dining room. It was well stocked with animals and vegetable gardens, whose crops led to agricultural and culinary experimentation at Versailles.

=== Dovecote ===
[[File:Colombier et Maison du Garde au Hameau de la Reine.jpg|thumb|Dovecote and Guard house]]
''The dovecote and pigeon coops'' were near the lake. Roosters and hens of various species were brought from the west of France and settled in the aviary in 1785 for Marie Antoinette’s use.

=== Guardhouse ===
This building is situated on the edge of the field near the woods. Its original occupant was the Swiss guard, Jean Bersy, who lived there with his family. Because of the prominence of the occupants of the Hamlet, the guard was necessary for Marie Antoinette’s security.

=== Grange ===
[[File:Grange du hameau de la Reine.jpg|thumb|right|Grange]]
''The barn'' also served as a ballroom. It was badly damaged during the French Revolution and destroyed during the First Empire.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3204">'''Horatio Mosley Moule''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|oʊ|l}} (1832&amp;ndash;1873) was the fourth son of [[Anglican]] priest and inventor [[Henry Moule]], and is best remembered as a friend of [[Thomas Hardy]]. He was generally known as '''Horace''', to distinguish him from his Uncle Horatio, after whom he was named.

==Early life==
Moule was born on 30 May 1832 at [[Fordington, Dorset]], where his father was [[vicar]]. In 1851 he entered [[Trinity College, Oxford]], but left without a degree; in 1854 he entered [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], but did not get a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] until 1867 and an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id= ML854HM|name=Moule, Horace Mosley}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, win the [[John Hulse|Hulsean Prize]] in 1858.

==Career==
He spent a brief spell as an assistant master at [[Marlborough College]], and then became a government inspector of [[workhouse]]s.

==Personal life==
Moule appears to have suffered from [[Depression (clinical)|depression]] and [[alcoholism]], and his life and death were shaped by these character traits; one of his pupils recorded in his diary that Horace was 'a [[dipsomaniac]]-and that he was suffering from [[Delirium tremens|D.T]]'.

===Death===
On 21 September 1873, when deeply depressed and affected by alcohol, he ended a three-hour conversation at Queens' with his brother [[Charles Walter Moule|Charles]] and went to bed. Minutes later Charles, writing in an adjoining room, heard what he described as a "trickling" sound and went to investigate. He found Horace covered in blood but conscious and able to utter his last words "Easy to die. Love to my mother", having slashed his throat with the razor that he kept under his pillow for that very purpose. The inquest jury returned a verdict of [[suicide]] whilst temporarily insane, and he was buried at Fordington.

==Hardy==
Some of Hardy's poems were dedicated to Moule, and it has been suggested that several characters and scenes in his novels were inspired by him. Henry Knight in ''[[A Pair of Blue Eyes]]'' shares many of Moule's character traits.

'''Hotfrog''' is a commercial [[web directory]] providing websites categorized topically and regionally.  Hotfrog's head office is located in [[Sydney, Australia]] but maintains directories in 32 countries worldwide and is present in 15 languages.

==History and locations==
Hotfrog began in Sydney, Australia in 2006 and was originally built by [[Reed Business Information]] (RBI) within its Australian subsidiary.  In 2012 the Reed Business Information, who is now named Cirrus Media&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bandt.com.au/media/Reed-rebrands-as-Cirrus-and-flags-investment |title=Reed Business Information Australia is set to be rebranded as Cirrus Media, |year=2013 |publisher=B&amp;T}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with Australian subsidiary along with Hotfrog was acquired by Catalyst Private Equity.  In early 2015, it seemed the future of the Hotfrog business was unclear, with speculation it could be run down with the buyer shedding staffing and keeping overheads to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mumbrella.com.au/cirrus-media-selling-directories-business-hotfrog-revenues-halve-272427 |title=Cirrus Media selling directories business HotFrog as revenues plummet |year=2014 |publisher=Mumbrella}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2015, Hotfrog was sold to a company called Hotfrog Group for an undisclosed value.  This new group announced major expansions under their new management and plans to expand into new countries and categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/hotfrog-announces-major-expansion-under-new-management-409156.php |title=Hotfrog Announces Major Expansion Under New Management |year=2015 |publisher=24/7 PR}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2015, the company became a Premier [[Small and Medium Businesses|SMB]] Partner with Google across Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/07/prweb12827315.htm |title=Hotfrog Becomes a Google AdWords Premier SMB PArtner |year=2015 |publisher=PR Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its peak Hotfrog employed over 120 staff who built the platform, systems and technology to support revenue generation and its database.  The company has one of the largest online [[business directories]] in the World.  Hotfrog allows online search users the ability to find business products and services via the online business directory listings throughout the world.  Hotfrog was unique in the fact that it allowed companies to submit free press releases for brand exposure and was the first American directory with over 2 million companies listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/26673 |title=First American Folksonomy Business Directory with Over 2 Million Companies Listed |year=2007 |publisher=PR.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hotfrog has over 59 million business listings worldwide reaching 32 countries and 15 languages.  Many search engines view listings in "high quality directories" as a valued citation.&lt;ref&gt;Cutts, Matt (2007). [http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/how-to-report-paid-links/ How to Report Paid Links] As an update to the post, Cutts addresses directories in the Q&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt; Website owners report of submitting their sites to directories can increase their search engine listings.&lt;ref&gt;Sloan, Paul (May 2007) How to scale Mt. Google. Business 2.0: 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Google]]'s certainly encourages businesses to list themselves on directories such as Hotfrog to maintain a strong NAP (Name, Address, Phone Number) which will encourage their position in the local [[search engine technology|search results]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.realwire.com/releases/Businesses-Warned-To-Protect-Themselves-Against-Googles-Pigeon-Dropping |title=Businesses Warned To Protect Themselves Against Google's Pigeon Dropping |year=2014 |publisher=Realwire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/925-local-seo-factors.html |title=The 5 Local SEO Factors That Matter Most |year=2014 |publisher=Search Engine People}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/small-business/easy-steps-to-lift-your-net-profile/story-fn9evb64-1226486358900 |title=Easy ways to lift your net profile |year=2012 |publisher=News.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hotfrog offers listings for both [[non-commercial]] and [[commerce|commercial]] and sites, and places each site that meet their guidelines in its most relevant topic and location.

==Paid Listings==
Hotfrog allows site owners to purchase a Hotfrog Advantage listing. The paid listing feature allows companies to register their business and receive premium positions in the search results for a fixed fee.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3029">The '''International Standard Authority Data Number''' (ISADN) was a registry proposed by the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) to provide and maintain [[unique identifiers]] for entities described in [[Authority control|authority data]].  Having such a unique number would have the benefits of being language-independent and system-independent.&lt;ref name=tillett&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tillett|first1=Barbara B.|title=Numbers to Identify Entities (ISADNs–International Standard Authority Data Numbers)|journal=Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly|date=25 July 2007|volume=44|issue=3-4|pages=343–361|doi=10.1300/J104v44n03_12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francoise Bourdon was a major proponent of such a standard, proposing a structure for the ISADN and recommending that the number uniquely identify authority records, rather than their subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bourdon|first1=Francoise|title=International Cooperation in the field of Authority Data: an analytical study with recommendations|date=1993|publisher=K. G. Saur|pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1989 article by Delsey described the work on the IFLA Working Group on an International Authority System, spending a good portion of time on conceptualizing an international standard number "that will facilitate the linkage of variant authorities for the same identity."  Their discussion was very complex in its discussion of which agencies would actually assign such numbers.  For example, a national library might be tasked with assigning identifiers to authors within its country, but this would lead to duplicate identifiers for authority data that describe transnational people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delsey|first1=Tom|title=Authority Control in an International Context|journal=Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly|date=23 January 1989|volume=9|issue=3|pages=13–28|doi=10.1300/J104v09n03_02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was ultimately determined to be unfeasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tillett|first1=Barbara B.|title=A Review of the Feasibility of an International Standard Authority Data Number (ISADN)|url=http://www.ifla.org/files/assets/cataloguing/pubs/franar-numbering-paper.pdf|website=IFLA|accessdate=6 August 2016|date=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Barbara Tillett|Tillett]] suggested that the cluster identifiers used by the [[Virtual International Authority File]] might meet the needs expressed in the proposal.&lt;ref name=tillett /&gt;

The concept of an ISADN continues to be relevant to the information science community, as it could be a great help in the problem of measuring an individual author's research output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Habibzadeh|first1=Farrokh|last2=Yadollahie|first2=Mahboobeh|title=The problem of "Who"|journal=The International Information &amp; Library Review|date=June 2009|volume=41|issue=2|pages=61–62|doi=10.1016/j.iilr.2009.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as producing [[language|monolingual]] [[dictionary|dictionaries]], Langenscheidt also produces [[bilingual dictionaries]] and travel phrase-books.

Langenscheidt has language-to-language dictionaries in many languages, including: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Ancient Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese Language|Chinese]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]], and in varying sizes, ranging from small travel pocket dictionaries to large desk sized ones.

== History ==

The Langenscheidt Publishing Group was founded on 1 October 1856 by [[Gustav Langenscheidt]], in response to other publishers' refusal to publish self-study materials developed by him for learning [[French language|French]], which he subsequently published under the title ''Unterrichtsbriefe zur Erlernung der französischen Sprache'' ("Teaching letters for learning the French language"). These learning materials became very popular and were widely read, so today Langenscheidt can be considered the "Father of [[distance education]]". From 1867 Langenscheidt Publishing Group had its own [[printing press]].

From 1869 Langenscheidt worked with Karl Sachs and Césaire Villatte on the ''Encyklopädisches französisch-deutsches und deutsch-französisches Wörterbuch'' ("Encyclopedic French-German and German-French dictionary") and published it in 1880.  In 1874, Langenscheidt  was awarded the title of professor.

In 1891, in close collaboration with Eduard Muret and [[Daniel Sanders (lexicographer)|Daniel Sanders]], he started working on the English equivalent, the ''Encyklopädisches englisch-deutsches und deutsch-englisches Wörterbuch'' ("Encyclopedic English-German and German-English dictionary"). Langenscheidt did not live to see its publication; his son Carl, his successor, published it in 1901.

== Dictionary structure ==

The structure for most Langenscheidt dictionaries is the same.  Most pocket dictionaries include around 55,000 references designed for tourists or people studying beginning or intermediate [[foreign language]]s, while larger desk sized interlanguage dictionaries include around 220,000 references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German-Swedish dictionary|url=http://en.langenscheidt.com/german-swedish/|publisher=Langenscheidt|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the two languages' references conclude, grammatical assistance appears in the Appendix section, including helpful abbreviations, geographical regions, currency values, temperature conversions, and numerical values.

The society was founded in 1965 by Sir [[Geoffrey Elton]] and others, with the aim of publishing and distributing "photographic copies of unprinted lists and indexes kept in the [[Public Record Office]], London, and of other unprinted guides and aids to the use of public archives in the British Isles", so that historians working at a distance from London could find out what was available in advance of their visits. More recently, photocopied lists and indexes have been replaced by the online catalogue but the society continues to provide a service to historians by publishing augmented lists, calendars and texts of historical manuscripts both in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] and in other repositories, supplementing the online catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the List and Index Society|url=http://www.listandindexsociety.org.uk/about.html|publisher=List and Index Society|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Merriam-Webster, Inc.''', is an American company that publishes [[reference book]]s and is especially known for its [[dictionary|dictionaries]].

In 1828, [[George Merriam|George and Charles Merriam]] founded the company as '''G &amp; C Merriam Co.''' in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. In 1843, after [[Noah Webster]] died, the company bought the rights to ''[[Webster's Dictionary#Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language|An American Dictionary of the English Language]]'' from Webster's estate. All Merriam-Webster dictionaries trace their lineage to this source.

In 1964, [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]], acquired Merriam-Webster, Inc., as a subsidiary. The company adopted its current name in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Origins==

===Noah Webster===
In 1806, Webster published his first dictionary, [[s:A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language|''A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language'']]. In 1807 Webster started two decades of intensive work to expand his publication into a fully comprehensive dictionary, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language''. To help him trace the etymology of words, Webster learned 26 languages. Webster hoped to standardize American speech, since Americans in different parts of the country used somewhat different vocabularies and spelled, pronounced, and used words differently.

Webster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in 1825 in Paris, and at the [[University of Cambridge]]. His 1820s book contained 70,000 words, of which about 12,000 had never appeared in a dictionary before. As a [[spelling reform]]er, Webster believed that English spelling rules were unnecessarily complex, so his dictionary introduced [[American English]] spellings, replacing ''colour'' with ''color'', ''waggon'' with ''wagon'', and ''centre'' with ''center''. He also added American words, including ''[[skunk]]'' and ''[[Squash (plant)|squash]]'', that did not appear in British dictionaries. At the age of 70 in 1828, Webster published his dictionary; it sold poorly, with only 2,500 copies putting him in debt. However, in 1840, he published the second edition in two volumes with much greater success.


===Merriam as publisher===
{{Further|Webster's Dictionary}}

In 1843, after Webster's death, [[George Merriam]] and Charles Merriam secured publishing and revision rights to the 1840 edition of the dictionary. They published a revision in 1847, which did not change any of the main text but merely added new sections, and a second update with illustrations in 1859. In 1864, Merriam published a greatly expanded edition, which was the first version to change Webster's text, largely overhauling his work yet retaining many of his definitions and the title "''An American Dictionary''{{-"}}. This began a series of revisions that were described as being "unabridged" in content. In 1884 it contained 118,000 words, "3000 more than any other English dictionary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Webster's Unabridged|journal=The Week : a Canadian journal of politics, literature, science and arts|date=11 Feb 1884|volume=1|issue=10|page=160|url=https://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n81/mode/1up|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the edition of 1890, the dictionary was retitled ''Webster's International''. The vocabulary was vastly expanded in ''Webster's New International'' editions of 1909 and 1934, totaling over half a million words, with the 1934 edition retrospectively called ''Webster's Second International'' or simply "The Second Edition" of the New International.

[[File:Collegiate Dictionary.jpg|thumb|''Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary'', Eleventh Edition.]]

The ''Collegiate Dictionary'' was introduced in 1898 and the series is now in its eleventh edition. Following the publication of ''Webster's International'' in 1890, two ''Collegiate'' editions were issued as abridgments of each of their ''Unabridged'' editions. With the ninth edition (''Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary'' (WNNCD), published in 1983), the ''Collegiate'' adopted changes which distinguish it as a separate entity rather than merely an abridgment of the ''Third New International'' (the main text of which has remained virtually unrevised since 1961). Some proper names were returned to the word list, including names of [[Knights of the Round Table]]. The most notable change was the inclusion of the date of the first known citation of each word, to document its entry into the English language. The eleventh edition (published in 2003) includes more than 225,000 definitions, and more than 165,000 entries. A [[CD-ROM]] of the text is sometimes included. This dictionary is preferred as a source "for general matters of spelling" by the influential ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', which is followed by many book publishers and magazines in the United States. The ''Chicago Manual'' states that it "normally opts for" the first spelling listed.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', 15th edition, New York and London: University of Chicago Press, 2003, Chapter 7: "Spelling, Distinctive Treatment of Words, and Compounds", Section 7.1 "Introduction", p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

Merriam overhauled the dictionary again with the 1961 ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary|Webster's Third New International]]'' under the direction of [[Philip Babcock Gove|Philip B. Gove]], making changes that sparked public controversy. Many of these changes were in formatting, omitting needless [[punctuation]], or avoiding complete sentences when a phrase was sufficient. Others, more controversial, signaled a shift from [[linguistic prescriptivism]] and towards describing American English as it was used at that time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Definition of a Dictionary|url = http://www.slate.com/articles/life/culturebox/2015/01/merriam_webster_dictionary_what_should_an_online_dictionary_look_like.html|newspaper = Slate|date = 12 Jan 2015|access-date = 2015-07-12|issn = 1091-2339|first = Stefan|last = Fatsis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1940s, the company has added many specialized dictionaries, language aides, and other references to its repertoire.

The G. &amp; C. Merriam Company lost its right to exclusive use of the name "Webster" after a series of lawsuits placed that name in [[public domain]]. Its name was changed to "'''Merriam-Webster, Incorporated'''", with the publication of ''Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary'' in 1983. Previous publications had used "'''A Merriam-Webster Dictionary'''" as a subtitle for many years and will be found on older editions.

The company has been a subsidiary of [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] since 1964.

==Services==
In 1996, Merriam-Webster launched its first website, which provided free access to an online dictionary and [[thesaurus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | accessdate = October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merriam-Webster has also published dictionaries of [[synonyms]], [[Merriam Webster's Dictionary of English Usage|English usage]], [[geography]] (''[[Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary]]''), [[biography]], [[proper names]], [[medical terminology|medical terms]], [[sports]] terms, [[slang]], Spanish/English, and numerous others. Non-dictionary publications include ''Collegiate Thesaurus'', ''Secretarial Handbook'', ''Manual for Writers and Editors'', ''Collegiate Encyclopedia'', ''Encyclopedia of Literature'', and ''Encyclopedia of World Religions''.

On February 16, 2007, Merriam-Webster announced the launch of a mobile dictionary and [[thesaurus]] service developed with mobile search-and-information provider [[AskMeNow]]. Consumers use the service to access definitions, spelling and synonyms via [[text message]]. Services also include Merriam-Webster's ''Word of the Day''—and ''Open Dictionary'', a [[wiki]] service that provides subscribers the opportunity to create and submit their own new words and definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/AskMeNow-and-Merriam-Webster-Launch-Mobile-Dictionary-47324.shtml |title=AskMeNow and Merriam-Webster Launch Mobile Dictionary |last1=Trusca |first1=Sorin |date=February 16, 2007 |publisher=[[Softpedia]] |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pronunciation guides==
The Merriam-Webster company once used a unique set of [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic symbol]]s in their dictionaries—intended to help people from different parts of the United States learn how to pronounce words the same way as others who spoke with the same accent or dialect did. [[Unicode]] accommodated [[International Phonetic Association|IPA]] symbols, but did not specify room for Merriam-Webster phonetics. Hence, to enable computerized access to the pronunciation without having to rework all dictionaries to IPA notation, the online services of Merriam-Webster specify phonetics using a less-specific set of [[ASCII]] characters.

==Writing entries==
Merriam creates entries by finding uses of a particular word in print and recording them in a database of ''citations''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Editors at Merriam spend about an hour a day looking at print sources, from books and newspapers to less formal publications, like advertisements and product packaging, to study the uses of individual words and choose things that should be preserved in the citation file. Merriam-Webster's citation file contains more than 16 million entries documenting individual uses of words. Millions of these citations are recorded on [[Index card|3-by-5 cards]] in their paper citation files. The earliest entries in the paper citation files date back to the late 19th century. Since 2009, all new entries are recorded in an electronic database.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Morgan le Fay''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔr|ɡ|ən|_|l|ə|_|ˈ|f|eɪ}}, meaning "Morgan the Fairy"), alternatively known as '''Morgana''', '''Morganna''', '''Morgain''', '''Morgaine''', '''Morgane''', '''Morgen''', '''Morgne''', and '''Morgue''' among other names and spellings, is a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|enchantress]] in the [[King Arthur|Arthurian legend]]. Early appearances of Morgan do not elaborate her character beyond her role as a goddess, a [[fairy|fay]], or a sorceress, generally benevolent and related to [[King Arthur]] as his magical savior and protector. Her prominence increased over time, as did her moral ambivalence, and in some texts there is an evolutionary transformation of her to an [[antagonist]], particularly as portrayed in cyclical prose such as the [[Lancelot-Grail]] and the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]]. A significant aspect in many of Morgan's [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and later iterations is the unpredictable duality of her nature, with potential for both good and evil.

Her character may have been rooted in [[Welsh mythology]] as well as other earlier myths and historical figures. The earliest account, by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in ''[[Vita Merlini]],'' refers to Morgan in conjunction with the Isle of Apples ([[Avalon]]), which is where Arthur was carried after being fatally wounded in the [[Battle of Camlann]]. There, and in the early [[chivalric romance]]s by [[Chrétien de Troyes]] and others, her chief role is that of a great healer. It is Chrétien who establishes her as Arthur's supernatural elder sister.

In the [[Robert de Boron]]-derived French prose versions and the works based on them, including among them [[Thomas Malory]]'s influential ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', she is usually established as the youngest daughter of Arthur's mother, [[Igraine]], and her first husband, [[Gorlois]]. Arthur, son of Igraine and [[Uther Pendragon|Uther]], is Morgan's half-brother; [[Mordred]]'s mother [[Morgause]] is one of Morgan's sisters. Morgan unhappily marries [[Urien]] with whom she has a son, [[Ywain]]. She becomes an apprentice of [[Merlin]], and a vindictive adversary of some knights of the [[Round Table]], all the while harboring a special hatred for Arthur's wife [[Guinevere]]. In this tradition, she is also sexually active and even predatory, taking numerous lovers that may include Merlin and [[Accolon]], with an unrequited love for [[Lancelot]]. In some variants, including the popular retelling by Malory, Morgan is the greatest enemy of Arthur, scheming to usurp his throne, indirectly becoming an instrument of his death; however, she eventually reconciles with Arthur, and retains her original role of taking him on his final journey to Avalon.

Many other medieval and [[Renaissance]] works feature continuations of her evolutionary tale from the aftermath of Camlann as she becomes the immortal queen of Avalon in both Arthurian and non-Arthurian stories, sometimes alongside Arthur. After a period of being largely absent from modern culture, Morgan's character again rose to prominence in the 20th and 21st centuries, [[Morgan le Fay in modern culture|appearing in a wide variety of roles and portrayals]].

==Etymology and origins==
[[File:Fata morgana, Statua presso la Fonte, Giambologna, 1574 ca.png|thumb|left|upright|''Fata Morgana'' (Italian "Morgana the Fairy") by [[Giambologna]] (c. 1574)]]

The earliest spelling of the name (found in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Vita Merlini]]'', written c. 1150) is ''Morgen'', which is likely derived from [[Old Welsh]] or [[Old Breton]] ''Morgen'', meaning "Sea-born" (from [[Common Brittonic]] ''*Mori-genā'', the masculine form of which, ''*Mori-genos'', survived in [[Middle Welsh]] as ''Moryen'' or ''Morien''; a cognate form in [[Old Irish]] is ''[[Lí Ban|Muirgen]]'', the name of a Christian shapeshifting female saint who was associated with the sea). The name is not to be confused with the unrelated [[Modern Welsh]] masculine name [[Morgan (given name)|Morgan]] (spelled ''Morcant'' in the Old Welsh period).&lt;ref&gt;Lot, Ferdinand, "Morgue la Fée et Morgan-Tud", in: ''Romania ''28 (1899), pp. 321–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koch, John, ''Celtic Culture'', ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 16; 458; 537; 702; 1602&lt;/ref&gt; As her epithet "le Fay" (invented in 15th century by [[Thomas Malory]]&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://othes.univie.ac.at/1206/1/2008-09-24_9760190.pdf|title=Different Faces of Morgan le Fay: The Changing Image of the Sorceress in Arthurian Literature|last=Dalecky|first=Elke|publisher=University of Vienna|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the earlier French ''la fée'', "the [[fairy]]") and some traits indicate, the figure of Morgan appears to have been a remnant of [[supernatural]] females from [[Celtic mythology]], and her main name could be connected to the myths of [[Morgen (mythological creature)|Morgens]] (also known as Mari-Morgans or just Morgans),&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; the Welsh and Breton fairy [[List of water deities|water spirits]]. While many later works make her specifically human, she retains her magical powers,&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Katharine (1978). "Morgan le Fay".

Geoffrey's description of Morgen and her sisters in the ''Vita Merlini'' closely resembles the story of the nine [[Gauls|Gaulish]] priestesses of the isle of Sena (now [[Île de Sein]]) called ''Gallisenae'' (or ''Gallizenae''), as described by the geographer [[Pomponius Mela]] during the 1st century, strongly suggesting that Pomponius' ''Description of the World'' (''De situ orbis'') was one of Geoffrey's prime sources of inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Curley, Michael J., ''Geoffrey of Monmouth'', Cengage Gale, 1994, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koch, John, ''Celtic Culture'', ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofeneder, Andreas, ''Die Religion der Kelten in den antiken literarischen Zeugnissen: Von Cicero bis Florus'', Austrian Academy of Sciences Press, 2008, p. 273ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faral, Edmond, ''La légende arthurienne, études et documents: Des origines à Geoffroy de Monmouth'', H.

Morgan first appears by name in ''[[Vita Merlini]]'', written by Norman-Welsh cleric [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]. Purportedly an account of the life of [[Merlin]], it elaborates some episodes from Geoffrey's more famous earlier work, ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (1136). In ''Historia'', Geoffrey relates how King Arthur, seriously wounded by [[Mordred]] at the [[Battle of Camlann]], is taken off to the blessed Isle of Apple Trees (Latin ''Insula Pomorum''), [[Avalon]], to be healed; Avalon (''Ynys Afallach'' in the Welsh versions of ''Historia'') is also mentioned as the place where Arthur's sword [[Excalibur]] was forged. (Geoffrey's Arthur does have a sister, whose name here is Anna, but the possibility of her being a predecessor to Morgan is unknown.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;) In ''Vita Merlini'', Geoffrey describes this island in more detail and names ''Morgen'' as the chief of the [[nine sorceresses|nine magical queen sisters]] who dwell there, ruling in their own right. Morgen agrees to take Arthur, delivered to her by [[Taliesin]] to have him revived, but says it might take a long time. She and her sisters are capable of [[shapeshifting]] and flying ("like [[Daedalus]], on strange wings"&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, ''Shapeshifter'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; and (at least seemingly&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;) use their powers only for good.&lt;ref&gt;Larrington, ''King Arthur's Enchantresses'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Morgen is also said to be a learned [[mathematician]]&lt;ref name=ww&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://fau.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/fau%3A31314/datastream/OBJ/view/Which_witch___Morgan_Le_Fay_as_shape-shifter_and_English_perceptions_of_magic_reflected_in_Arthurian_legend.pdf|title=Which Witch?: Morgan le Fay as Shape-Shifter and English Perceptions of Magic Reflected in Arthurian Legend|last=Oliver|first=Cheyenne|publisher=Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to have taught [[astronomy]]&lt;ref name=sec&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1032&amp;context=utk_graddiss|title=Morgan le Fay as Other in English Medieval and Modern Texts|last=Capps|first=Sandra Elaine|publisher=University of Tennessee, Knoxville|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to her fellow [[nymph]] (''nymphae'')&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; sisters, whose names are Moronoe, Mazoe, Gliten, Glitonea, Gliton, Tyronoe, Thiten and Thiton.&lt;ref&gt;[[Algernon Herbert]] (1836).

According to a theory postulated by [[Roger Sherman Loomis|R. S. Loomis]], Geoffrey was not the original inventor of Morgan's character, which had already existed in hypothetical unrecorded stories of her as Arthur's fairy savior or even also his [[fairy godmother]] (her earliest shared supernatural ability being able to traverse on or under water) as being told by wandering storytellers (as credited by Gerald of Wales) that would influence various authors writing independently from each other, especially since ''Vita Merlini'' was a little known text that only survived in one manuscript.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Geoffrey's description of Morgen is notably very similar to that of [[Medea]] in [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]]'s epic poem ''[[Roman de Troie]]'' (c. 1155–1160), a story of the ancient [[Trojan War]] in which Morgan herself makes an unexplained appearance in this second known text featuring her.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loomis|first=Roger S.|date=1945|title=Morgain La Fee and the Celtic Goddesses|journal=Speculum|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=183–203|doi=10.2307/2854594|jstor=2854594}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Morgan the fairy (''Orva la fée'', likely a corruption of a spelling such as ''*Morgua''{{ref|a}} in the original-text),&lt;ref name="Schöning, Udo 1991, p. 209"&gt;Schöning, Udo, ''Thebenroman - Eneasroman - Trojaroman: Studien zur Rezeption der Antike in der französischen Literatur des 12. Jahrhunderts'', Walter de Gruyter, 1991, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; there she loves [[Hector]] and gifts him a wonderful horse but then pursues him with hate after he rejects her. The abrupt way in which she is used suggests Benoît did expect his aristocratic audience to have been familiar with her character.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In ''[[Jaufre]]'', an [[Occitan language]] Arthurian romance dated c. 1180, Morgan apparently appears, without being named (other than naming herself as the Fairy of Gibel), as the lady of an underground kingdom who takes the protagonist knight Jaufre through a fountain to gift him her magic ring of protection.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In the romance poem ''[[Lanzelet]]'', written by the end of the 12th century by [[Ulrich von Zatzikhoven]], the infant [[Lancelot]] is spirited away by a water fairy (''merfeine'' in [[Old High German]]) and raised in her paradise island country of Meidelant ("Land of Maidens"); his water [[Fairy Queen|fairy queen]] might be also related to Geoffrey's Morgen of Avalon.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In [[Layamon]]'s [[Middle English]] poem [[Layamon's Brut|''The Chronicle of Britain'']] (c. 1215), Arthur was taken to Avalon by two women to be healed there by its most beautiful [[elf]]en (''aluen'') queen named Argante or Argane;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ct" /&gt; it is possible her name had been originally ''Margan(te)'' before it was changed in manuscript transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Faedo, ''Avalon Revisited'', p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12th-century French poet [[Chrétien de Troyes]] already mentions her in his first romance, ''[[Erec and Enide]]'', completed around 1170. In it, a love of Morgan (Morgue) is Guinguemar, the Lord of the Isle of Avalon and a nephew of King Arthur, a derivative of the legendary [[Bretons|Breton]] hero Guingamor.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Pérez, ''The Myth of Morgan la Fey'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guingamor|Guingamor's own tale]] by [[Marie de France]] links him to the beautiful magical entity known only as the "fairy mistress",&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, ''The Myth of Morgan la Fey'', p. 73–75.&lt;/ref&gt; who was later identified by [[Thomas Chestre]]'s ''[[Sir Launfal]]'' as ''Dame Tryamour'', the daughter of the King of the [[Celtic Otherworld]] who shares many characteristics with Chrétien's Morgan.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, ''Shapeshifter'', p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/9674272|title=Animal Encounters: Contacts and Concepts in Medieval Britain|author=Figg|first=Kristen|last2=Crane|first2=Susan|date=|website=Academia.edu|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted that even Chrétien' earliest mention of Morgan already shows an enmity between her and Queen [[Guinevere]], and although Morgan is represented only in a benign role by Chrétien, she resides in a mysterious place known as the Vale Perilous (which some later authors would say she has created as a place of punishment for unfaithful knights).&lt;ref name="roch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larrington, ''King Arthur's Enchantresses'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; She is later mentioned in the same poem when Arthur provides the wounded hero [[Erec]] with a healing balm made by his sister Morgan. This episode affirms her early role as a healer, in addition to being one of the first instances of Morgan presented as Arthur's sister; healing is Morgan's chief ability, but Chrétien also hints at her potential to harm.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, ''Shapeshifter'', p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Chrétien again refers to Morgan as a great healer in his later romance ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]'', in an episode in which the Lady of Norison restores the maddened hero to his senses with a magical potion provided by Morgan the Wise (''Morgue la sage'').&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; While Modron is the mother of [[Owain mab Urien]] in Welsh literature, and Morgan would be assigned this role in later French literature, this first continental association between Sir [[Ywain]] and Morgan does not imply they are son and mother; she is first mentioned as Ywain's mother in the early 13th-century [[Breton lai]] ''[[Tyolet]]''.&lt;ref name="ct" /&gt;

The [[Middle Welsh]] Arthurian tale ''[[Three Welsh Romances|Geraint son of Erbin]]'', either based on Chrétien's ''Erec and Enide'' or derived from a common source, mentions King Arthur's chief physician named Morgan Tud. It is believed that this character, though considered a male in ''Gereint'', may be derived from Morgan le Fay, though this has been a matter of debate among Arthurian scholars since the 19th century (the epithet Tud may be a [[Welsh language|Welsh]] or [[Breton language|Breton]] cognate or borrowing of [[Old Irish]] ''tuath'', "north, left", "sinister, wicked", also "fairy (fay), elf").&lt;ref&gt;Paton, Lucy Allen.

''Arthurian Tradition and Chretien de Troyes'', Columbia University Press, 1949, p. 488.&lt;/ref&gt; There, Morgan is called to treat [[Edern ap Nudd]], Knight of the Sparrowhawk, following the latter's defeat at the hands of his adversary [[Geraint]], and is later called on by Arthur to treat Geraint himself. In [[Erec (poem)|his version]] of ''Erec'', the 12th-century German knight and poet [[Hartmann von Aue]] describes Arthur's deceased sorceress sister, the goddess (''gotinne'')&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Feimurgan (''Fâmurgân'', Fairy Murgan), whom he based on Morgen of Avalon with a Christian bias, as a mistress of dark magic and healing arts who lived her life "in defiance of God" and had the devil in Hell as a trusted companion. Erec is healed by Guinevere with a special plaster that the fairy had given to Arthur before she died. According to the work, at her death all of her wondrous knowledge was lost with her, which included flying, raising the dead, turning people to animals at will, and commanding monsters (wild beasts, evil spirits, dragons).&lt;ref&gt;Larrington, ''King Arthur's Enchantresses'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=IJ378XMAYoIC&amp;pg=PA91|title=Erec|last=Aue|first=Hartmann Von|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0803273290|language=en|date=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; In writing that, Hartmann might have not been influenced by Chrétien, but rather by an earlier oral tradition from the stories of Breton bards.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In the 13th-century romance ''[[Parzival]]'', another German knight-poet [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] inverted Fâmurgân's name to create that of Arthur's fairy ancestor named Terdelaschoye de Feimurgân, the wife of Mazadân, where the part "Terdelaschoye" comes from ''Terre de la Joie'', or Land of Joy; the text also mentions the mountain of Fâmorgân.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ct" /&gt;

A recently discovered moralistic manuscript written in [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman French]] is the only known instance of medieval Arthurian literature presented as being composed by Morgan herself. This late 12th-century text is purportedly addressed to Morgan's court official and tells of the story of a knight called Piers the Fierce; it is likely that the author's motive was to draw a satirical moral from the downfall of the English knight [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall]]. Morgan (Morgayne) is titled in it as "empress of the wilderness, queen of the damsels, lady of the isles, and governor of the waves of the great sea."&lt;ref name="blr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/11688947|title='Morgan le Fay, Empress of the Wilderness': A Newly Recovered Arthurian Text in London, BL Royal 12.C.ix|author=Twomey|first=Michael|date=|via=Academia.edu|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also mentioned in the ''[[Draco Normannicus]]'', a 12th-century (c. 1167–1169) Latin chronicle by [[Étienne de Rouen]], which contains a fictional letter from King Arthur to [[Henry II of England]], written for political propaganda purposes, in which 'Arthur' criticizes Henry for invading Brittany and claims that he has been healed of his wounds and made immortal in Avalon by his fay sister Morgan, called an "immortal nymph" (''nympha perennis'').&lt;ref name="blr" /&gt; Notably, it is one of the first known texts that made Morgan a sister to Arthur, as she is in the works of Chrétien and many others after him.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ddd.uab.cat/pub/tfg/2015/137420/TFG_lauracalvo.pdf|title=The Female Figure as the Antagonist in the Arthurian World: The Role of Morgan le Fay in Thomas Malory's Morte Darthur|last=Zafra|first=Laura Calvo|publisher=Autonomous University of Barcelona|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan's role was greatly expanded by the unknown authors (possibly members of the [[Cistercians|Cisterian]] religious order, which would explain their demonization of pagan motifs and fear of sexuality&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;) of the 13th-century [[Old French]] romances of [[Lancelot-Grail]] (the Vulgate Cycle) and especially its subsequent rewrites (the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]]). Integrating her fully into the Arthurian world, they also make Morgan's ways and deeds much more sinister and aggressive than she was presented by Geoffrey or Chrétien, as she undergoes a series of transformations and becomes a chaotic counter-heroine in many texts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/6129549|title=The Role of Women in the Arthurian Material|author=Marxen|first=Lis|date=|website=|via=Academia.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning as an erratic ally of Arthur and a notorious temptress opposed to his wife and some of his knights (especially Lancelot) in the original stories of the Vulgate Cycle, Morgan's figure eventually often turns into an ambitious and depraved nemesis of King Arthur himself in the Post-Vulgate. Her common image is now a malicious and cruel sorceress, the source of many intrigues at the royal court of Arthur and elsewhere. In some of the later works, she is also subversively working to take over Arthur's throne through her mostly harmful magic and scheming, including manipulating men.&lt;ref name="sec" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fGAoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT90|title=Merlin: Priest of Nature|first=Jean|last=Markale|date=1 June 1995|publisher=Simon and Schuster|via=Google Books|isbn=9781620554500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the time, Morgan's magic arts correspond with these of Merlin's and the [[Lady of the Lake]]'s, such as shapeshifting, illusion, and sleeping spells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://is.muni.cz/th/ws1hd/BT_Final_Orlicka.pdf|title=Magic in the Arthurian Legends|last=Orlická|first=Barbora|publisher=Department of English and American Studies, Masaryk University, Brno|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval archetype of the [[loathly lady]] is used frequently, as Morgan can be contradictorily described as both beautiful and ugly even within the same narration.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Morgan first appears in the few surviving verses of the Old French poem ''[[Merlin (poem)|Merlin]]'', which later served as the original source for the Vulgate Cycle and consequently also the Post-Vulgate Cycle. It was written c. 1200 by the French knight-poet [[Robert de Boron]], who described her as an illegitimate daughter of Lady [[Igraine]] (with an unnamed Duke of [[Tintagel]] in a continuation of ''Merlin'' in the Vulgate ''Lancelot''), adopted by King [[Budic II of Brittany|Neutres of Garlot]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Larrington, p. 41"&gt;Larrington, ''King Arthur's Enchantresses'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Merlin'' is the first known work linking Morgan to Igraine and mentioning her learning sorcery after having been sent away for an education. In a popular tradition from later evolutions of this narrative, Morgan is the youngest of the daughters of Igraine and [[Gorlois]], the [[List of legendary rulers of Cornwall|Duke of Cornwall]]. In the poem's prose version and its continuations, she has at least two elder sisters (various manuscripts list up to five daughters and some do not mention Morgan being a bastard child&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;): [[Elaine (legend)#Elaine of Garlot|Elaine of Garlot]] and [[Morgause]], the latter of whom is the mother of Arthur's knights [[Gawain]], [[Gaheris]], [[Gareth]], and [[Agravain]] by [[King Lot]] of [[Lothian]], and the traitor Mordred by Arthur (in some romances the wife of King Lot is called Morcades, a name that R. S. Loomis argued was another variant of Morgan&lt;ref&gt;R. S.

Retrieved January 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;). At a young age, Morgan is sent to a [[convent]] after Arthur's father [[Uther Pendragon]], aided by the half-demon Merlin, kills Gorlois and rapes and marries her mother, who later gives him a son, Arthur (which makes him Morgan's younger half-brother). There, Morgan masters [[Liberal arts education|the seven arts]], and begins her study of magic, going on to specialize in ''astronomie'' (astronomy and [[astrology]]) and healing.&lt;ref name="blr" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larrington, ''King Arthur's Enchantresses'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The late addition known as the Vulgate ''Suite du Merlin'', besides describing Morgan's unmatched beauty and amazing voice, presents more of her skills, including being "the best worker with her hands that anyone knew about in any land," highly eloquent and "the cleverest of all." Its narrator further elaborates on her character, being infamous as "the most ardent and most lecherous woman in all Britain ... inspired with sensuality and the devil," that "as long as she was in her right mind, she was more courteous than any, but when she was angry with anyone, there was no need in trying to reconcile them."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Uther (or Arthur himself in the Post-Vulgate&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;) betroths her to his ally, King [[Urien]] of Gore (possibly [[Rheged]]). Now a queen but unhappy with her husband, Morgan is caught in an affair with her lover Guiomar (derived from Chrétien's Guinguemar) by the High King Arthur's newly married wife, Queen Guinevere, whom Morgan had served as a [[lady-in-waiting]].

In the Post-Vulgate, where Morgan's explicitly evil nature is stated and accented, she also works to destroy Arthur's rule and end his life, but the reasons for her initial hatred of him are never fully explained other than just an extreme antipathy towards the perfect goodness which he symbolizes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The most famous and important of these machinations is introduced in the Post-Vulgate ''Suite'', where she arranges for her devoted lover [[Accolon]] to obtain the enchanted sword Excalibur as well as its protective [[scabbard]], which has been previously confided to Morgan by Arthur himself as he had trusted her even more than his wife, replacing the real ones with fakes. In a conspiracy with the villainous lord Damas, Morgan plans for Accolon to use Arthur's own magic items against him in single combat, so she and her beloved Accolon would become the rulers. As part of her convoluted plan, both Arthur and Accolon are spirited away from their hunt with Urien by a magical boat of twelve damsels. Confident of her coming victory, Morgan also attempts to murder her sleeping husband Urien with his own sword, but in this act she is stopped by their son Ywain (Uwayne), who pardons her when she protests she has been under the devil's power and promises to abandon her wicked ways.&lt;ref name="Hebert, Shapeshifter, p. 71" /&gt; After Arthur nevertheless mortally defeats Accolon in a duel arranged by Morgan, her former mentor Merlin, still having feelings for her, saves her from Arthur's wrath by enabling her to escape.&lt;ref name="Larrington, p. 33" /&gt; To avenge Accolon's death, which caused her great sorrow, Morgan again steals the scabbard from the sleeping king. Pursued by Arthur for her betrayal, Morgan throws the scabbard into a lake, before temporarily turning herself and her entourage to stone, the sight of which makes Arthur think they have been already punished by God. That action of Morgan ultimately causes the death of Arthur, who would otherwise be protected by the scabbard's magic in his final battle. On her way out, Morgan saves Arthur's knight named Manassen (Manessen, Manasses) from certain death and enables him to kill his captor when she learns Accolon was Manessen's cousin. Now banished from Camelot, Morgan retires to her lands in Gore and then to her castle near the stronghold of Tauroc (possibly in [[North Wales]]). However, her treacherous attempts to bring about Arthur's demise in the ''Suite'' are repeatedly frustrated by the king's new sorceress advisor Ninianne (the Lady of the Lake). Such is the case when Morgan sends Arthur a supposed offering of peace in the form of a rich [[Mantle (clothing)|mantle]] cloak; Morgan's messenger maiden is made put on the cursed gift and it burns her to cinders. It is possible that this motif was inspired by classical stories like that how Medea killed her rival for [[Jason]]'s affection&lt;ref&gt;Larrington, ''King Arthur's Enchantresses'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; or how [[Deianira]] sent a poisoned tunic to [[Hercules]].&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, ''Shapeshifter'', p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of her castles, Tugan in Garlot, Morgan has hidden a magic book given to her by Merlin, which actually prophesied the deaths of Arthur and Gawain and who would kill them, but no one can read this passage without dying instantly.&lt;ref name="ct" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Larrington, p. 33"&gt;Larrington, ''King Arthur's Enchantresses'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Queen Morgana Appears unto Sir Launcelot.png|thumb|[[Howard Pyle]]'s illustration from ''[[The Story of the Champions of the Round Table]]'' (1905) &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;"She was clad in all the glory at her command, and her appearance was so shining and radiant that when she came into that room Sir Launcelot knew not whether it was a vision his eyes beheld or whether she was a creature of flesh and blood."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/storyofchampions00pyle|title=The Story of the Champions of the Round Table|last=Pyle|first=Howard|date=1905|publisher=New York: Scribner|others=New York Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]]

Morgan also uses her skills in dealing with various of Arthur's [[Knights of the Round Table]], especially the greatest of them all, Lancelot, whom she alternately tries to seduce and to expose as Guinevere's adulterous lover. Her magic aside, Lancelot is always disempowered in his dealings with Morgan as he could never hurt a woman or fight a kin of his king, which allows the writers to make her a perfect [[Foil (literature)|foil]] for Lancelot as "the woman he most feared in the world."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRMABQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14|title=Sexual Culture in the Literature of Medieval Britain|last=Hopkins|first=Amanda|last2=Rouse|first2=Robert Allen|last3=Rushton|first3=Cory James|date=2014|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd|year=|isbn=9781843843795|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan is emphasized as promiscuous, even more than her sister Morgause, as she is "so lustful and wanton that a looser woman could not have been found."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1837&amp;context=mff|title=Creating Her Own Power: Morte Darthur's Morgan le Fay|last=Scott|first=Cynthia A|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=University of Texas–Pan American, Edinburg|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her many paramours include Huneson the Bald (Hemison, Onesun), who is mortally wounded when he attacks [[Tristan]] (Tristam) out of his jealously for Morgan's attention; he soon dies after returning to her, and the anguished Morgan buries him in a grand tomb.

Lancelot is Morgan's prime object of sexual desire but he consistently refuses her obsessive advances due to his great love of Guinevere, even as Morgan courts, drugs, enchants or imprisons the knight on several occasions (three times in the Vulgate ''Lancelot'').

Sebile and Morgan are particularly close companions, working their magic together, but they tend to fall into petty squabbles due to their rivalries and bad tempers, including a conflict between them when they both seduce Lancelot's brother [[Hector de Maris]] in the late 13th-century ''Prophéties de Merlin''; a resulting contest between them is won by Nimue with help from Merlin.

Besides Lancelot, Morgan's fancied good knights include the rescued-but-abducted young Alexander the Orphan (Alisaunder le Orphelin, a cousin of Tristan and Mark's enemy from the much later addition to the Prose ''Tristan'' as well as the ''Prophéties de Merlin''), whom she promises to heal; however, he vows to castrate himself rather than to pleasure her.

She also otherwise torments Guinevere, causing her great distress and making her miserable until the Lady of the Lake gives her a ring that protects her from Morgan's power.&lt;ref name="l4345" /&gt; On one occasion, she lets the captive Lancelot go to rescue Gawain when he promises to come back (but also keeping him the company of "the most beautiful of her maidens" to do "whatever she could to entice him"), and he keeps his word and does return; she eventually releases him altogether after over a year, when his health falters and he is near death.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, ''Shapeshifter'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that Morgan concentrates on witchcraft to such degree that she goes to live in seclusion in the exile of far-away forests. She learns more spells than any other woman, gains an ability to transform herself into any animal, and people begin to call her Morgan the Goddess (''Morgain-la-déesse'', ''Morgue la dieuesse'').&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Larrington, p. 13"&gt;Larrington, ''King Arthur's Enchantresses'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Post-Vulgate version of ''Queste del Saint Graal'', Lancelot has a vision of Hell where Morgan still will be able to control demons even in afterlife as they torture Guinevere.&lt;ref&gt;Larrington, ''King Arthur's Enchantresses'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, after she hosts her nephews Gawain, Mordred and Gaheriet to heal them, Mordred spots the images of Lancelot's passionate love for Guinevere that Lancelot painted on her castle's walls while he was imprisoned there; Morgan shows them to Gawain and his brothers, encouraging them to take action in the name of loyalty to their king, but they do not do this.&lt;ref&gt;Larrington, ''King Arthur's Enchantresses'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; With same intent, she also gives Tristan an enchanted shield depicting Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot to deliver to Camelot (in the Prose ''Tristan'').&lt;ref name="l4345"&gt;Larrington, ''King Arthur's Enchantresses'', p. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Vulgate ''La Mort le Roi Artu'' (The Death of King Arthur, also known as just ''Mort Artu''), Morgan ceases troubling Arthur and vanishes for a long time, and Arthur assumes her to be dead. But one day, he wanders into Morgan's remote castle while on a hunting trip, and they meet and instantly reconcile with each other. Morgan welcomes him warmly and the king, overjoyed with their reunion, allows her to return to Camelot, but she refuses and declares her plan to move to the Isle of Avalon, "where the women live who know all the world's magic," to live there with other sorceresses. However, disaster strikes when the sight of Lancelot's frescoes and Morgan's confession finally convinces Arthur about the truth to the rumours of the two's secret love affair (about which he has been already warned by his nephew Agravain). This leads to a great conflict between Arthur and Lancelot, which brings down the fellowship of the [[Round Table]]. The goddess [[Fortuna|Fortune]], who appears to Arthur to foretell his death towards the end the Vulgate Cycle, is regarded by some as a double for Morgan.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, ''The Myth of Morgan la Fey'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Mort Artu'', a black-hooded Morgan is the first among the ladies who take the dying Arthur to his final rest and possible revival in Avalon. The latter part of the Post-Vulgate versions of ''Queste'' and ''Mort'' both revert to Morgan's friendly and helpful attitude toward Arthur from the Vulgate Cycle, even as she makes no mention of Avalon or her intentions when taking him away. Arthur steps into her boat after Camlann but assures he is not going to return; his grave is later said to be found mysteriously empty but for his helmet.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A 14th-century Middle English version of ''Mort Artu'' known as the [[Stanzaic Morte Arthur|Stanzaic ''Morte Arthur'']] makes Morgan an unquestionably good sister of Arthur, concerned only about his honor in regard to the affair of Lancelot and Guinevere. Entering her boat (she is not named in the scene, but addresses him as her brother), Arthur believes he is going to be healed, yet his tomb is later discovered by [[Bedivere]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Middle English writer [[Thomas Malory]] follows much of these portrayals of Morgan in his late-15th-century seminal work of the selective compilation book ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' (''The Death of Arthur''), though he reduces her in role and detail of characterisation, in particular either removing or limiting her traditions of healing and prophecy, and making her more consistently and inherently evil just as he makes Merlin more good.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He also diminishes Morgan's conflict with Guinevere, as there is no motif of Guiomar and Accolon (there Sir Accolon of [[Gaul]]) is her first named lover, but does not clarify Morgan's motivations for her antagonistic behaviour against Arthur.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Malory scholar Elizabeth Sklar described Morgan's character here as "an essentially sociopathic personality, respecting no boundaries and acknowledging no rules save those dictated by her own ambitions, envy, and lust."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://is.muni.cz/th/210234/pedf_b/BAKALARSKA_PRACE.docx|title=Femininity and Death in Arthurian Legends|last=Puškášová|first=Pavla|publisher=Department of English Language and Literature, Masaryk University, Brno|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the war between Arthur and Lancelot and the rebellion of Mordred, it is Morgan who remains the main and constant source of direct and indirect threat to the realm.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Malory's backstory, she has studied astrology as well as ''nigremancie'' (which might actually mean [[black magic]] in general rather than "[[necromancy]]"&lt;ref&gt;Larrington, ''King Arthur's Enchantresses'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;) in the nunnery where she was raised, before being married to Urien (Uriens) as a young teenager; in this narrative she did not study with Merlin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her powers seem to be inspired by fairy magic of Celtic folklore rather than by medieval [[Christian demonology]].&lt;ref name="ww" /&gt; Malory mentions Arthur's attempts to conquer at least one of her castles, which originally had been his own gift to her, and which he could not retake (apparently due to magical defenses&lt;ref name=mls&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1837&amp;context=mff|title=Malory's Morgan le Fay: The Danger of Unrestrained Feminine Power|last=Saul|first=MaryLynn|publisher=Worcester State College|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). She also plots an elaborate ambush in "The Book of Sir Tristram de Lyons", after learning of the death of one of her favourites in a tournament, but Tristan ends up killing or routing thirty of her knights when the ambush ends in a disaster. Morgan is widely feared and hated, so much that "many knights wished her burnt." She is now the leader of the four (not three) witch queens who capture Lancelot (the others being the Queen of the Northgales, the Queen of Eastland, and the Queen of the Outer Isles). In an episode that had been first introduced by the anonymous writer of the earlier Prose ''Lancelot'', Lancelot rescues [[Elaine of Corbenic]] from being trapped in an enchanted boiling bath by Morgan and the Queen of the Northgales, both envious of Elaine's great beauty (echoing [[Circe]]'s treatment of [[Scylla]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;). As noted by Mary Lynn Saul: "Curiously, in spite of all her powers, Morgan is rarely successful in any of her plots.

Morgan turns up throughout the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages]] in a variety of roles, generally in works related to the cycles of Arthur (the [[Matter of Britain]]) or [[Charlemagne]] (the [[Matter of France]]). They often feature Morgan as a lover and benefactor (and sometimes opponent, especially when being turned down) of various heroes, sometimes also introducing her additional offspring or alternate siblings, or connecting her closer with the figure of the Lady of the Lake. The 15th-century Italian manuscript ''[[Tavola ritonda]]'' (''The Round Table''), for instance, makes Morgan a sister to the Lady of the Lake as well as to Arthur; it is based on the French romances but here Morgan is a prophetic figure whose main role is to ensure the fulfillment of [[Destiny|fate]].&lt;ref name="e83"&gt;Larrington, ''King Arthur's Enchantresses'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The Middle English romance ''Arthour and Merlin'', written around 1270, casts a villainous Morgan in the role of the Lady of the Lake and gives her a brother named Morganor as an illegitimate son of King Urien; her wondrous castle Palaus is built mostly of crystal and glass.&lt;ref name="ct" /&gt; In the Old French anonymous ''Li Romans de Claris et Laris'' better known as just ''Claris and Laris'' (also c. 1270),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://d.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/text/porney-claris-and-laris|title=Claris and Laris|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en|website=Robbins Library Digital Projects}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgane la Faye (Morgana in the modern English translation) is a now fully supernatural being, a former sister of Arthur as well as a former pupil of the Lady of Lake, Viviane (Viviana). Still ever lascivious and sexual, Morgan now lives in a splendid enchanted castle in the wilderness (identified as [[Brocéliande]] in a later manuscript) with twelve other beautiful fairy ladies including the sorceress Madoine (Madoina). There, they lure and ensnare many hundreds of young and attractive knights, who then spend the rest of their lives in the palace.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, ''The Myth of Morgan la Fey'', p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=dS1dAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT44|title=Fairies in Medieval Romance|last=Wade|first=J.|date=2011-05-23|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780230119154|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th-century Italian romance titled ''La Pulzella Gaia'' (''The'' ''Merry Maiden'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/pulzellagaiacant00rajn|title=Pulzella Gaia: Cantare Cavalleresco|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Rajna|editor-first=Pio|edition=1893|location=|pages=|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; features the titular beautiful young daughter of Morgana the Wise by Hemison.

She then herself is imprisoned in a magical torment in her mother's glass-and-diamond magical castle Pela-Orso, as Morgana, who here too is a sister of the Lady of the Lake, wants to marry her "whore" daughter to Tristan; Gawain storms the castle after three years of siege and frees her from a cursed dungeon, also capturing her tyrannical mother for the same punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Varanini|first=Giorgio|date=1959|title=Il manoscritto quattrocentesco della " Ponzela Gaia "|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/scrip_0036-9772_1959_num_13_1_3001|journal=Scriptorium|language=it-IT|volume=13|issue=1|pages=70–79|doi=10.3406/scrip.1959.3001|issn=0036-9772}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B9AGDAAAQBAJ|title=Gawain: A Casebook|last=Busby|first=Keith|last2=Thompson|first2=Raymond H.|date=2005-11-08|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136783517|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 14th-century Middle English romance ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', one of the best-known Arthurian tales, it is revealed that the entire [[Green Knight]] plot has been instigated by Gawain's aunt, the goddess&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/3069692|title=An Exploration of the Evolution of the Arthurian Myth|author=Still|first=Angie|date=|website=Academia.edu|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan le Fay (''Morgue la Faye'', ''Morgne þe goddes''&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;), whose prior mentorship by Merlin is mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8161437|title=Morgan le Fay and the fairy mound in 'Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'|author=North|first=Richard|date=|website=Academia.edu|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, she is an ambiguous [[trickster]]&lt;ref name="ww" /&gt; who takes an appearance of an elderly woman (contrasting from the beautiful [[Lady Bertilak]] in a role evoking the loathly lady tradition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/120086811/sovereign-fantasies-arthurian-romance-and-the-making|title=Sovereign Fantasies: Arthurian Romance and the Making of Britain|last=Clare|first=Patricia|date=2001|website=|publisher=Questia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;), as a test for Arthur and his knights and to frighten Guinevere to death.

In some texts, Avalon is often described as an otherworldly place ruled by Morgan. In his 14th-century [[Catalan language|Catalan]] poem ''La faula'', [[Guillem de Torroella]] claims to having visited the Enchanted Isle and met Arthur who has been brought back to life by the fay Morgan (''Morgan la feya'', ''Morguan la fea'')&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and they both are now forever young due to the power of the [[Holy Grail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rialc.unina.it/179.1.htm|title=La faula|last=Torroella|first=Guillem de|date=|editor-last=Compagna|editor-first=Anna Maria|website=www.rialc.unina.it|language=Catalan|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th-century Spanish romance ''[[Tirant lo Blanch]]'', the noble Queen Morgan searches the world for her missing brother and finds him as an entranced prisoner in [[Constantinople]]; Morgan brings Arthur back to his senses by removing Excalibur from his hands, and after great celebrations they depart together back to Avalon. In the legends of Charlemagne, she is most famous for her association with the Danish legendary hero [[Ogier the Dane]], following his initial epics. When he is 100 years old, she restores him to his youthful form but removes his memory, then takes him to her mystical island palace in Avalon (where Arthur and Gawain are also still alive) to be her lover for 200 years; she later protects him during his adventures in the mortal world as he defends France from Muslim invasion, before his eventual return to Avalon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silverberg |first=Robert |url=https://www.questia.com/library/7120207/the-realm-of-prester-john |title=The Realm of Prester John by Robert Silverberg, 1972 &amp;#124; Online Research Library |publisher=Questia |date= |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some accounts, Ogier begets her two sons, including Marlyn (Meurvin);&lt;ref name="ct" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larrington, ''King Arthur's Enchantresses'', p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 14th-century ''Ly Myreur des Histor'' by Jean d'Outremeus, one of their sons is a giant.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In the 13th-century ''[[chanson de geste]]'' of [[Huon of Bordeaux]], she is a protector of the eponymous hero and the mother of the fairy king [[Oberon]] by none other than [[Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref&gt;Sion, C.M.H.

The 13th-century romance ''Floriant et Florete'' places Morgan's secret mountain castle of Mongibel (Montgibel or Montegibel, derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name for Etna), where, in the role of a fairy godmother, Morgan and two other fays&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; spirit away and raises Floriant, a son of a murdered Sicilian king and the hero of the story.

During the [[Italian Renaissance]], Morgan has been primarily featured in relation to the cycle of epic poems of Orlando (based on [[Roland]] of the historical Charlemagne). In [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]]'s late-15th century ''[[Orlando Innamorato]]'', fata Morgana (initially as lady Fortune&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSuXAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14|title=Encyclopedia of Fairies in World Folklore and Mythology|last=Bane|first=Theresa|date=2013-08-30|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476612423|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is beautiful but wicked fairy enchantress, a sister of King Arthur and a pupil of Merlin. Morgana lives in her paradise-like garden in a crystal cavern under a lake, plotting to eventually destroy the entire world.

It also features the medieval motif where she convinces Arthur of the infidelity of his queen (Geneura) using a magic horn, here successfully.

The '''Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya''' ({{IPA-ca|muˈzɛw nəsi.uˈnal ˈdaɾd də kətəˈluɲə}}, [[English language|English]]: "National Art Museum of Catalonia"), abbreviated as '''MNAC''', is the national [[museum]] of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] visual art located in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Situated on [[Montjuïc]] hill at the end of [[Avinguda de la Reina Maria Cristina]], near [[Plaça d'Espanya, Barcelona|Pl Espanya]], the museum is especially notable for its outstanding collection of [[romanesque art|romanesque]] church paintings,  and for [[Catalan art]] and design from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including [[modernisme]] and [[noucentisme]]. The museum is housed in the [[Palau Nacional]], a huge, Italian-style building dating to 1929. The Palau Nacional, which has housed the Museu d'Art de Catalunya since 1934, was declared a [[national museum]] in 1990 under the Museums Law passed by the Catalan Government. That same year, a thorough renovation process was launched to refurbish the site, based on plans drawn up by the architects [[Gae Aulenti]] and [[Enric Steegmann]], who were later joined in the undertaking by [[Josep Benedito]]. The Oval Hall was reopened in 1992 on the occasion of the [[1992 Summer Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], and the various collections were installed and opened over the period from 1995 (when the Romanesque Art section was reopened) to 2004. The Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (Museu Nacional) was officially inaugurated on 16 December 2004.&lt;ref name="DDAA. Museu Nacional d 2009"&gt;DDAA. Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. Florència: Mnac i SCALA GROUP S.p.A, 2009. {{ISBN|978-84-8043-198-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the [[list of largest art museums in the world|largest]] museums in Spain.

==History==
The history of this institution dates back to the 19th century, when, in accordance with the principles that inspired [[Catalonia]]'s cultural and political ''[[Renaixença]]'' (renaissance), a movement particularly active in that century, many projects were launched to help revive and conserve the country's artistic heritage. This process began with the establishment of the [[Museu d'Antiguitats de Barcelona]] (Barcelona Museum of Antiquities) in the [[Chapel of Santa Àgata|Chapel of St Agatha]] (1880) and the [[Museu Municipal de Belles Arts]] (Municipal Fine Art Museum) in the [[Palau de Belles Arts]] (1891), a palace built to mark the occasion of the [[Exposición Universal de Barcelona|1888 Universal Exhibition]]. A project to install all these [[Catalan art]] collections in the [[Palau Nacional]], launched in 1934 under the initiative of [[Joaquim Folch i Torres]], the first director of Catalonia Museum of Art, was frustrated by the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939), when for protection many works were transferred to [[Olot]], [[Darnius]] and [[Paris]] (where an important exhibit was established). During the postwar period, the 19th- and 20th-century collections were installed in the [[Museu d'Art Modern]], housed from 1945 to 2004 in the Arsenal building in Barcelona’s [[Parc de la Ciutadella]], whilst the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]], [[Gothic art|Gothic]] and [[baroque]] collections were installed in the Palau in 1942.

The Palau Nacional, which has housed the Museu d'Art de Catalunya since 1934, was declared a ''national museum'' in 1990 under the Museums Law passed by the Catalan Government. In 1992 a thorough renovation process was launched to refurbish the site, based on plans drawn up by the architects Gae Aulenti and Enric Steegmann, who were later joined in the undertaking by Josep Benedito. The Oval Hall was reopened in 1992 on the occasion of the Olympic Games, and the various collections were installed and opened over the period from 1995 (when the Romanesque Art section was reopened) to 2004. The Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya (Museu Nacional) was officially inaugurated on 16 December 2004.

Since 2004, the Palau Nacional has once more housed several magnificent art collections, mostly by Catalan art, but also Spanish and European art. The works from that first museum have now been enriched by new purchases and donations, tracing the country’s art history from early medieval times to the mid-20th century: from Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and baroque to modern art. This heritage is completed by the Gabinet Numismàtic de Catalunya (coin and medal collections), the Gabinet de Dibuixos i Gravats (drawings and engravings) and the library.&lt;ref name="DDAA.

It is one of the most important and outstanding collections in the museum, due largely to the series of mural [[paintings]] it includes. Indeed, the Museu Nacional Romanesque Collection is unmatched by that of any other museum in the world. Many of the works here originally adorned rural churches in the [[Pyrenees]] and other sites in Old Catalonia, or ''Catalunya Vella'', as it is known; they began to be discovered and studied in the early 20th century, particularly after a Pyrenean expedition in 1907 by the [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans]] (Institute of Catalan Studies), which later published ''Les pintures murals catalanes'' (Catalan Mural Paintings). Years later, the news emerged that a group of foreign financiers and antiquarians had block-purchased most of these paintings to be taken to the [[United States of America]]. Although there were no laws in [[Spain]] at that time to forbid the expatriation of art, the [[Junta de Museus]] (Catalan Board of Museums) was able to successfully intervene in order to rescue, dismantle and transfer works to the Museum of Barcelona (1919–1923), then housed in the [[Parc de la Ciutadella]], thus conserving and protecting these Romanesque works, considered a completely unique piece of art heritage and also a symbol of the birth and formation of [[Catalonia]].&lt;ref name="Romanesque art in the MNAC collections"&gt;{{cite book|title=Romanesque art in the MNAC collections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vE_qAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=14 August 2012|year=2008|publisher=MNAC|isbn=978-84-8043-196-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanesque rooms are arranged in chronological and stylistic order, giving visitors a view of the different tendencies in Catalan [[Romanesque art]] and featuring works produced, for the most part, in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries.

The visit to this section begins with the mural [[paintings from Sant Joan in Boí]], which show clear stylistic influences from the French [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] tradition, and then continues with works showing the Italian influence that dominated painting from the late 11th century, doubtless as a result of the influence of the [[Gregorian Reform]]. This style is illustrated in such excellent works as the mural [[Southern apse from Pedret|paintings from Sant Quirze de Pedret]], [[Apse of Santa Maria d'Àneu|Santa Maria d'Àneu]] and [[Paintings from El Burgal|Sant Pere del Burgal]].

However, the rooms of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya also feature a particularly outstanding example of European Romanesque art: the remarkable, original and extraordinarily expressive paintings from the [[Apse of Sant Climent de Taüll]], including the famous Pantocrator or Christ in Majesty, an undisputed masterpiece from the 12th century that forms tangible evidence of the creative power of Catalan painting. Beside this superb piece stands another magnificent [[Paintings from Santa Maria in Taüll|group of works]], from [[Santa Maria de Taüll]], the most important example of the interior of a Romanesque church painted throughout, with much of its decoration conserved today.

The Romanesque section ends with the [[Paintings from Arlanza|paintings from San Pedro de Arlanza]] and the chapter house of [[Monastery of Santa María de Sigena|Sigena]]. The latter features one of the most magnificent pictorial series in this new style, called 1200 art, which swept across Europe in the 13th century. The piece has been conserved in the museum since it was severely damaged by fire in 1936, during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Romanesque art in the MNAC collections"/&gt;

Romanesque rooms also show the techniques that distinguished Catalan art at the time, such as panel painting, wood carving and others that help to complete our aesthetic vision of Romanesque, such as precious metalwork and carving stone.

The collection of panel paintings, unique in Europe, is another singular aspect of Romanesque painting, due both to the number and antiquity of the Catalan works conserved (the result of interest in the Romanesque since the late19th century) and to their quality and technical diversity. Particularly outstanding are the frontals of the Apostles (also known as the [[Frontal from La Seu d'Urgell or of The Apostles|Frontal of La Seu d'Urgell]]), [[Alòs d'Isil]], [[Altar frontal from Avià|Avià]] and [[Altar frontal from Cardet|Cardet]], which are rightly considered paradigms of an original pictorial technique, embodying enormous artistic interest. Moreover, the wood carving collection completes this wide-ranging summary of Romanesque art, featuring fine works of different types, such as [[Virgin of Ger]], the [[Batlló Majesty]] and the carvings in the [[Erill la Vall Descent from the Cross]].

There are also sculptures in stone that form part of the Museu Nacional Romanesque art collection, particularly a number of works from [[Ripoll]] and a large group of elements from ensembles in the city of Barcelona, including the refined marble capitals from the former [[Hospital de Sant Nicolau]]. Finally, the Romanesque section also features an important collection of enamels, mostly produced [[Limoges enamel|in Limoges]], such as the [[Mondoñedo Crosier]].&lt;ref&gt;DDAA.

=== Gothic Art Collection ===

The Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya Gothic art collection began to take shape in the early decades of the 19th century, when a movement was first launched to revive and conserve the important body of [[Catalan culture|Catalan]] heritage, which had been seriously damaged in the wave of convent burnings that took place at around the time of the [[Ecclesiastical confiscations of Mendizábal|disentailment of church goods]] in the year 1835.

The Gothic collection features a considerable number of Catalan works accompanied, moreover, by an extraordinary selection of pieces from the other territories that were once ruled by the [[Crown of Aragon]]. As a whole, this section presents a broad, representative panoramic view of Gothic art produced in the three large peninsular territories that formed part of the [[kingdom of Aragon]] – [[Catalonia]], Aragon itself, and [[Valencia]] – as well as a more anecdotal selection of works from [[Majorca]].

The Gothic rooms display works from the late 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, arranged in chronological order, although the pieces are also grouped by school and typological affinity, and several thematic sections have been established. These include the renowned [[Mural paintings of the Conquest of Majorca]], which preside over the first Gothic room. This same room also contains other works on profane themes or from secular sites, including elements from the enteixinats ([[Coffer|coffered]] ceilings) of noble Barcelona houses to amatory caskets.

Other works in this and the following rooms, from [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], [[Navarre]], [[Aragon]] and Catalonia, clearly illustrate the predominance of [[French Gothic]] models, which endured until the mid-14th century, when competition was finally offered by new Italianate models. This new style, developed in the Italy of [[Giotto]], was adopted and adapted here, working a profound transformation in painting and sculpture not only in Catalonia, but throughout the reigns forming part of the Crown of Aragon.

Besides a few Italian examples, the Museu Nacional also features an important selection of Italian, Catalan and Aragonese painting, such as the [[Triptych of Sant Vicenç d'Estopanyà]], probably by an immigrant Italian artist, and altarpieces by the Serra brothers (the Serra family were highly influential in steering the course of Catalan painting during the closing decades of the 14th century). Sculpture during this period from the mid-14th century, was also influenced by Italian models, although the French Gothic style continued to exercise its authority. The collection includes works that may be attributed to some of the most outstanding sculptors of the time, such as [[Jaume Cascalls]] (see [[Head of Christ (Cascalls)|Head of Christ]]) and [[Bartomeu de Robió]]. Catalan sculpture in the late 14th century and the first half of the 15th is represented by two misericords from [[Barcelona Cathedral]] carved stalls by [[Pere Sanglada]]. From the 15th century, working in the new [[International Gothic]] style, [[Pere Oller]] and [[Pere Joan]] perhaps represent the peak of what was without doubt an important Catalan contribution to sculptural art.

Amongst Catalan painters, [[Lluís Borrassà]], [[Joan Mates]], [[Bernat Martorell]], [[Ramon de Mur]] and [[Joan Antigó]] are amongst the finest exponents of International Gothic, a style that also coincided with the period when Valencia was flourishing as a centre for art. Valencia is represented in the Museu Nacional by such outstanding artists as [[Gonçal Peris]]. The Gothic collection also features examples of painting from Aragon, another region that enjoyed considerable influence at this time. The exchange of influences continued, in both directions, during the period that followed when artistic representation became more realistic, and which took its initial inspiration from [[Jan van Eyck]]: the Valencian artist [[Lluís Dalmau]] painted the universally acclaimed [[Virgin of the Consellers]] whilst the Catalan [[Juan Rexach|Joan Reixac]] – whose work is well represented at the Museu Nacional – directed the most prolific workshop in Valencia. It was also after a period in Valencia that [[Jaume Huguet]], the great Catalan painter working in the second half of the 15th century, made his residence definitively in Barcelona, establishing his dominance and setting up a school there. Complementing a generous selection of Huguet's works, the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya also contains examples from artists active during the same period, such as [[Pere Garcia de Benabarre]], who worked in both Aragon and Catalonia and created another successful formula based on similar cultural components.

Besides this central strain in autochthonous painting, the panorama of Gothic art also features various other important episodes, such as the time spent by [[Antoine de Lonhy]] in Barcelona, or the later, longer residence in the Catalan capital of the [[Cordoba, Andalusia|Cordoban]] artist [[Bartolomé Bermejo]], who had previously worked in Valencia and Aragon. This journey through the late 15th century continues with such Castilian painters as [[Fernando Gallego]], along with others from Aragon, as [[Martín Bernat]] or [[Miguel Ximénez (artist)|Miguel Ximénez]], and Valencia, principally [[Roderic d'Osona]]. Finally, mention the remarkable series of the organ shutters from the [[La Seu d'Urgell Cathedral|Cathedral of la Seu d'Urgell]], painted at the end of the 20th century by an artist from [[Perpignan]] who is known by various names, including that of the [[Master of La Seu d'Urgell]].&lt;ref&gt;Gumà, Montserrat (ed).

=== Renaissance and Baroque Art Collection ===
The Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya [[Renaissance]] and [[baroque]] art collection comprises pieces of priceless cultural heritage that – unlike the collections at other great national museums in [[Europe]], which were generally built up from royal and aristocratic collections – was established in [[Catalonia]] through the acquisition of local pieces and later complemented by donations and acquisitions from private galleries.

The itinerary begins with art from the [[Low Countries]] in the 16th century, in which religious fervour is mixed with detailed depiction of everyday life, as can be seen in the superb collection of panels and triptychs commissioned for private use. In Catalonia during the early Renaissance period, the Gothic forms are found alongside other, new stylistic solutions, as exemplified, for instance, in [[Saint Candidus (Ayne Bru)|St Candidus]], by [[Ayne Bru]] or [[Saint Blaise|St Blaise]], by [[Pere Fernández]], works imbued with the humanist feeling and influenced by the modern composition theories that were then emerging in [[Italy]]. In the [[Altarpiece of St Eligius of the Silversmiths]], [[Pere Nunyes]] clearly shows the influence of this new language, as does the sculptor [[Damià Forment]] in his interpretation of the Apostles for the [[Dormition of the Virgin]]. Towards the end of the 16th century, Spanish painting produced many works of outstanding beauty, such as [[El Greco]]'s ''[[The Bearing of the Cross]]'' and [[Saint Peter and Saint Paul|St Peter and St Paul]], enriched by modern use of colour, the fruit of the lessons the artist had learned in [[Venice]]. In this age, the [[Ecce Homo (Luis de Morales)|Ecce Homo]], [[Luis de Morales]], a contemporary of [[El Greco]], [[Jacopo Tintoretto]] or [[The Bassano]], masterfully conveyed the devotional spirit of the [[Counter-Reformation]].

The 17th century begins with the [[Mural Paintings from the Herrera Chapel|frescoes in the Herrera Chapel]] by [[Annibale Carracci]] and collaborators, who decorated the Church of [[San Giacomo degli Spagnuoli]] in [[Rome]], and continues with works by other Italian artists such as the Neapolitans [[Massimo Stanzione]] and [[Andrea Vaccaro]]. However, standing out above all these are the masterpieces from the masters of the Spanish Golden Age, such as the [[Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew]] by [[José de Ribera]], known as Lo Spagnoletto, [[St Paul (Velázquez)|St Paul]], by [[Diego Velázquez]], and the [[Immaculate Conception (Zurbarán)|Immaculate Conception]] and several still lifes by [[Francisco de Zurbarán]]. Returning to Catalonia, in his image of [[Saint Cajetan|St Cajetan]], the sculptor [[Andreu Sala]] reveals himself to be a worthy follower of the Italian genius [[Bernini]].

Entering now the 18th century, [[Antoni Viladomat]]'s series of canvases devoted to the Life of St Francis, which decorated the main cloister of the former [[monastery of the Friars Minor in Barcelona]], constitutes the only complete set of scenes from monastic life preserved in a museum. Finally, heralding the art forms that would develop in the 19th century, the daring works of [[Francesc Pla]], known as ''El Vigatà'', illustrate the painterly freedom taken when decorating the interiors of seigniorial mansions belonging to the new, wealthy classes who had made their fortunes in trade and industry.

The collection, which reflects the taste of certain sections of society for Renaissance and Baroque art, features (exceptionally, if compared to the rest of the Museu Nacional collections) art produced not only in Catalonia, but also in the rest of Spain, Italy and Flanders, providing an overview of the development of European art during this period. Two later donations made important contributions to this more general vision: the Cambó Bequest and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection.&lt;ref name="Gumà, Montserrat 2004"&gt;Gumà, Montserrat (coord).

==== The Cambó Bequest ====
The collection of paintings that the Catalan politician and arts patron [[Francesc Cambó]] (1876–1947) built up with the intention of donating works by the great masters to complement the great medieval series in the Museu d'Art de Catalunya as it was then known, is the most valuable altruistic donation that the Museu Nacional has received in its history, and the one which has most served to enrich the body of Renaissance and Baroque works here.

The Cambó Bequest forms a collection of paintings embraces European painting history from the 14th to the early 20th century. It includes representative works of the Gothic and Renaissance periods, together with pieces that illustrate the perfection of the Italian [[Quattrocento]], the sensuality of the great Venetian masters of the [[Cinquecento]], the rising economic prosperity of the Low Countries in the 16th and 17th centuries and the magnificence of the Spanish Golden Age, without forgetting the richness of European [[Rococo]]. The artists represented at the Museu Nacional, thanks to this distinguished collection, include many outstanding, universally known names: great Italian painters such as [[Sebastiano dal Piombo]], [[Tiziano Vecellio]] (Titian) and [[Giandomenico Tiepolo]]; superb exponents of the [[Flemish School]] in the form of [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]]; [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]] and [[Maurice Quentin de la Tour]] and their French rococo works; and, finally, [[Francisco de Goya]], whose revolutionary genius rounds off the artistic journey embraced by the Cambó Bequest.&lt;ref name="Gumà, Montserrat 2004"/&gt;

==== Thyssen Bornemisza Collection ====
When the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection was installed in the [[Palacio de Villahermosa]] in [[Madrid]], and the state formalised the purchase in 1993, a number of the works – 72 paintings and 8 sculptures, mainly on religious themes, though also including several landscapes and portraits – were dispatched on permanent loan to Barcelona. In that same year, 1993, the permanent exhibition of these works was officially opened in a wing of [[Pedralbes Monastery]], converted into a museum by Barcelona City Council. In 2004, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Foundation and the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya reached an agreement under which the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection of Barcelona was to be exhibited permanently at the Museu Nacional, with the dual purpose of complementing the content in the Catalan museum and making the works more widely known and appreciated.

The collection comprises paintings and sculptures spanning European art from the Gothic to the [[rococo]] period. There are many Italian works, including, most outstandingly, paintings by [[Fra Angelico]], [[Pietro da Rimini]], [[Taddeo Gaddi]], [[Francesco del Cossa]], [[Bernardino Butinone]], [[Dosso Dossi]], [[Titian]], [[Ludovico Carracci]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] and [[Canaletto]], among others. Particularly fine examples from the [[Flemish school]] are a painting by [[Petrus Paulus Rubens]] and a landscape by [[Salomon van Ruysdael|Salomon Jacobz van Ruysdael]], whilst the [[Spanish Golden Age]] is represented by [[Diego Velázquez]]'s [[Portrait of Mariana of Austria]].

=== Modern Art Collection ===
The Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya [[modern art]] collection owes its origins to the [[1888 Universal Exhibition]], when Barcelona City Council installed what was then a modest collection of  contemporary (for the time) modern art in the [[Palau de Belles Arts]]. This original core of the collection was considerably expanded by acquisitions made by the Council at art exhibitions. As it stands at present, the modern art collection contains a selection of the finest Catalan art from the early 19th century until the 1940s.

The first part of this itinerary is devoted to the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]], [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[Realism (art movement)|realist]] movements. Among the most outstanding Catalan neoclassical artists represented here are the painter [[Josep Bernat Flaugier]] and the sculptor [[Damià Campeny]]. In terms of Romanticism, particular mention should be made of [[Nazarene movement|Nazarene]] painters such as [[Claudi Lorenzale]], who focussed on the portrait most notably, and [[Lluís Rigalt]], a precursor of the Catalan landscape tradition, which was continued (now entering the Realist period) by [[Ramon Martí Alsina]], who introduced [[Courbet]]'s ideas in Catalonia, and [[Joaquim Vayreda]], founder of the [[Olot School]], among others. Special mention should also be made of [[Marià Fortuny]], Catalonia's finest 19th-century painter. Fortuny’s genre painting won him international acclaim, although towards the end of his short life he became interested in pictorial innovation, as can be seen in his last works. Also represented here are several painters who worked in the style of ''anecdotal realism'', including [[Romà Ribera]] and [[Francesc Masriera]], and the [[Luminism (Impressionism)|''Luminists'']] of the Sitges School, disciples of Fortuny. Turning now to sculpture, the [[Vallmitjana brothers]] are the most outstanding exponents of the realist tradition. Finally, the section devoted to the 19th century also includes examples from early photographic art, featuring works by [[André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri|A. A. Disdéri]], [[Jean Laurent (photographer)|Jean Laurent]], [[Le Jeune]] and [[Charles Clifford (photographer)|Charles Clifford]], among others, featuring images of different places from all over Spanish territory.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

''[[Modernisme]]'' is a movement of enormous artistic and cultural importance in [[Catalonia]], is one of the central themes in the Museu Nacional modern art collection. In painting, the works most clearly identified with this movement, infused with a spirit of renewal, are those by [[Ramon Casas]] and [[Santiago Rusiñol]], whose Parisian paintings embrace certain elements from French Impressionism. Another important trend is [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], represented here by the paintings of [[Alexandre de Riquer]] and [[Joan Brull]], and also seen in certain photographs by the pictorialist [[Pere Casas Abarca]]. The second generation of Modernista artists are present in depth and number, too, with works by the likes of [[Isidre Nonell]], [[Marià Pidelaserra]], [[Ricard Canals]], [[Hermen Anglada–Camarasa]], [[Nicolau Raurich]] and [[Joaquim Mir]], among others. It was these and other artists who helped to elevate Catalan painting to reach one of its most brilliant periods around the turn of the 20th century. The collection also includes works by Spanish painters, such as [[Julio Romero de Torres]], [[Joaquim Sorolla]], [[Ignacio Zuloaga]], [[Darío de Regoyos]] and [[José Gutiérrez Solana]], the photographer [[José Ortiz-Echagüe|Ortiz-Echagüe]] and the French artists [[Eugène Boudin|Boudin]], [[Alfred Sisley|Sisley]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. Particularly interesting in the section devoted to Modernista sculpture are the works of [[Miquel Blay]] and [[Josep Llimona]], who were clearly influenced by Rodin. The collection of Modernista decorative arts includes some exceptional examples of interior decorative art by [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]], [[Gaspar Homar]] and [[Antoni Gaudí]] from, respectively, the [[Casa Amatller|Amatller]], [[Casa Lleó Morera|Lleó Morera]] and [[Casa Batlló|Batlló]] houses in Barcelona’s [[Passeig de Gràcia]]; objets d'art in various specialities, such as ironwork, ceramics, glasswork and jewellery; not forgetting several items of furniture by [[Joan Busquets]] and the architect [[Josep Maria Jujol]].

The second movement richly represented in the Museu Nacional modern art collection is [[Noucentisme]], which embodies the quest for the essential spirit of the [[Mediterranean]]. The movement is represented by the classical compositions of [[Joaquín Torres García]] and [[Joaquim Sunyer]], vaguely influenced by [[Cézanne]], and the sculptural nudes of [[Josep Clarà]] and [[Enric Casanovas]]. Completing this review of [[Noucentisme]] are the sculptures by [[Manolo Hugué]] and the paintings by [[Xavier Nogués]], notably popular in tone. In around 1920, a new generation of artists emerged, one faced by the dilemma of either continuing in the [[Figurative art|figurative tradition]] or making the leap to the [[avant-garde]]. Some of these, such as the painters [[Josep de Togores]] and [[Francesc Domingo]], produced work with a style of its own within the context of international realism, a movement that gained many followers between the wars. Others, such as Torres-García himself, [[Rafael Barradas]] and [[Salvador Dalí]], found in the [[Galeries Dalmau]] the ideal gallery at which to show their more innovative works.

The historic avant-garde is very well represented, particularly in terms of sculpture, with works including impressive sculptures by [[Pablo Gargallo]], [[Julio González (sculptor)|Julio González]] and [[Leandre Cristòfol]], whilst in painting the most exceptional figure is [[Pablo Picasso]], represented in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya collection since 2007.

Turning now to the field of photography, we should mention such avant-garde artists as [[Josep Masana]], [[Josep Batlles]], [[Pere Català Pic]] and [[Emili Godes]], as well as [[Agustí Centelles]] for his important graphic work documenting the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Finally, the new avant-garde that emerged during the post-war years is represented by [[Otho Lloyd]] and [[Joaquim Gomis]], whose pioneering work found its continuation in the [[Neorealism (art)|Neorealists]] [[Francesc Català-Roca]], [[Joan Colom]], [[Oriol Maspons]] and [[Xavier Miserachs]], among others.

==== The Carmen Thyssen Bornemisza Collection ====
In late 2004, to mark the opening of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, the museum received a score of Catalan art works from the [[Carmen Thyssen]]-Bornemisza collection. In view of the wealth and heterogeneity of this collection, the works loaned to the Museu Nacional focus more on diversity than on unity of discourse, with the object of giving an idea, if overly concise, of the plurality of this collection.

The chronological period covered by this section spans from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century, one of the most brilliant moments in the history of Catalan art. Notable amongst the 19th-century pieces is Marià Fortuny’s Bullfight, Wounded Picador, painted in 1867. As regards the Modernista movement, several of the most important artists from this period are represented, featuring ''[[Open-Air Interior]]'' (1892) and ''[[Ramon Casas and Pere Romeu on a Tandem]]'' (1897),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.secrethotels.eu/visiting-barcelona-on-a-budget/ |title= Visiting Barcelona on a Budget&amp;nbsp;|publisher=secrethotels.eu |date=|accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; both by [[Ramon Casas]]; Le Paon Blanc by [[Hermen Anglada-Camarasa]]; and ''[[The Cathedral of the Poor]]'' (in which the Church of the [[Sagrada Familia]], under construction, is seen in the background) and The Abyss. ''Majorca'' (1901–1904) by [[Joaquim Mir]]. Equally noteworthy is the presence of Noucentisme, a movement deeply rooted in Catalonia, with paintings by [[Joaquim Torres-García]] and [[Joaquim Sunyer]], as well as works by younger artists who continued the Noucentista spirit. Finally, this journey through the history of Catalan modern art leads to the acclaimed [[Antoni Tàpies]].&lt;ref name="DDAA. Museu Nacional d 2009"/&gt;

==== Cabinet of Drawings and Prints ====
The collections assembled from the museum's historic holdings to form the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya Cabinet of Drawings and Prints comprise some 50,000 drawings, 70,000 engravings and more than 1,000 posters. The founds combine to offer a rich and wide-ranging journey through the most important movements in the history of Catalan art, particularly since the late 18th century, thanks largely to the establishment in Barcelona in 1775 of the Free School of Design and the Fine Arts. Popularly known as ''[[La Llotja]]'', this school quickly became a reference point in the consolidation of the academic style in Catalonia. Representing the period from [[Neoclassicism]] to [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], the Museu Nacional collections of works on paper feature a considerable number of pieces by artists linked to the school in the 19th century, including [[Josep Bernat Flaugier]], [[Vicent Rodés]], [[Claudi Lorenzale]] and [[Ramon Martí Alsina]], as well as others by members of certain families, such as the Planella and the Rigalt lineages, who produced various generations of artists. From the preceding periods, we should highlight in particular the contribution made by the most outstanding Catalan baroque painter, [[Antoni Viladomat]], who is represented by many works in the Cabinet of Drawings and Prints. As recently as 2003, moreover, the collection was enhanced by the acquisition of a group of Catalan baroque altar works from [[César Martinell]]'s unique collection, which provide an interesting view of Catalan altarpiece art in the 17th and 18th centuries.       
 
However, there can be no doubt that one of the true highlights of these collections is the important body of works by [[Marià Fortuny]], which include more than 1,500 drawings and 50 engravings, making the Cabinet of Drawings and Prints an essential reference for reconstructing the creative trajectory of this great 19th-century artist. From the same period, moreover, are more than 30 drawings by the history painter [[Eduardo Rosales]], acquired in 1912, and linked to two of his finest and most characteristic historic compositions: ''The Testament of Queen Isabella the Catholic'' and ''the Death of Lucrecia''.

The Modernista and noucentista movements are also widely represented in the Cabinet holdings. The collections include more than 600 Modernista posters by renowned Catalan and foreign artists. Among the most impressive are those by [[Ramon Casas]], one of the most illustrious of all Modernista artists. Particularly mention should be made of the famous series of charcoal sketches, a veritable portrait gallery of the leading personalities of the era in Catalonia, and which Casas himself donated to the museum in 1909. Turning now to the noucentista movement, we should draw attention in particular to [[Isidre Nonell]], represented in the Cabinet by some 150 pieces.

Nor should we forget the collection of posters from the same period, largely acquired by the museum from [[Lluís Plandiura]] in 1903. Comprising more than 500 pieces among which foreign artists are also well represented, this invaluable legacy constitutes an incomparable resource for tracing the history of poster art in Catalonia.

Finally, though the collection is rather uneven here, mention should be made of the printed works from the avant-garde movement. The sculptor [[Juli González]] is one of the avant-garde artists most amply represented in the Cabinet, thanks to the donation of more than 150 drawings made by his daughter in 1972. On the other hand, the presence of certain great contemporary creative artists such as [[Dalí]] and [[Miró]], to mention but two, is little more than anecdotal.

Two acquisitions made by the old Museums Board were fundamental to forming the collections contained in the Cabinet of Drawings and Prints. The first was the collection of literary and art critic [[Raimon Casellas]], in 1911; the second, that of Modernista artist [[Alexandre de Riquer]], ten years later.

==== Numismatic Cabinet of Catalonia ====
The collections of the Numismatic Cabinet of Catalonia, established in 1932, now comprises more than 134,000 pieces. This rich holding is the result of a long process of acquisition by purchase, donation, legacy or deposit, which began in the first half of the 19th century and continues even today.

The coin collection comprises nearly 100,000 pieces, including examples from the main series minted from the 6th century BC to the present. The most important and interesting amongst these are, without doubt, the coins produced in Catalonia, which include many extremely rare and unique pieces. The visit to the Numismatic Cabinet begins with the series of ancient coinage, outstanding among which are those minted on the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. These include such important pieces as the coins from the Greek colonies of [[Emporion]] and Rhode and the treasure of 897 silver pieces found at the neapolis of [[Emporion]]. Dating back to the transition period between the ancient and medieval worlds is the collection of [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] coins, including some minted at workshops in Catalan territory, such as [[Barcelona|Barcino]], [[Tarraco]] or [[Gerunda]]. Practically all the western European kingdoms are represented in the medieval Christian series, although the collections of coins from Catalonia and Aragon are the most notable. They include examples that illustrate, step by step, the historic and economic evolution of these lands. For example, the economic growth that Catalonia enjoyed in the 13th century is reflected in the minting in Barcelona for the first time of silver Peter II Croats{{clarify|date=September 2012}}. Finally, among the coins minted in the modern and contemporary periods, we should mention particularly those produced in Catalonia during three important historic periods: the [[Reapers War]], the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and the [[Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte|French occupation]].

The medals collection is formed by more than 9,000 pieces, which range from the earliest, struck in Italy in the second half of the 15th century, to the present. The greater part of this collection is made up of works produced in Spain, mostly by well-known artists and engravers, who created medals of the highest quality. For example, the Museu Nacional medals collection features works by such outstanding 18th-century master engravers as [[Tomás Francisco Prieto]] and [[Gerónimo Antonio Gil]]. During the late 19th century, moreover, particularly after the 1888 Barcelona Exhibition, many Modernista sculptors turned to the art of medal-making, and the examples in the Cabinet fully reflect what was a splendid creative period for the genre, particularly in Catalonia. The leading artist in the field was, without doubt, Eusebi Arnau, but such sculptors as Parera, Blay, Llimona and Gargallo also created medals of the highest quality.

The central core of the MNC paper money collection, which embraces a wide range of documents of different types, is formed by its 4,100 examples of banknotes. These include the Spanish series containing all the banknotes issued by the [[Bank of Spain]] from 1874 to the present, as well as the series of paper money printed by the Catalan Government and local authorities in the country during the Spanish Civil War.

The Cabinet also exhibits a range of different pieces of interest due to their direct or indirect connection with numismatics. These include, amongst other things, tools used for minting coin, coin weights, scales, jettons (counters), pellofes and other types of tokens, stamps, medals and various documentary collections.

==The building==
{{wide image|Montjuic360.jpg|300px| 360° view outside the main entrance to the Palau Nacional|45%|right|alt=360° view outside the Palau Nacional}}
The National Palau of Montjuïc, known as ''Palau Nacional'' was constructed between 1926 and 1929, with the goal of being the main building of the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition]], holding an Exhibition of Spanish Art named ''El Arte en España'' (The Art of Spain). More than 5,000 works came to the Exhibition from across Spain.

The Palau Nacional is a huge building (over {{convert|50000|m2|ft2}}) which embodies the academic classical style that predominated in constructions for all the universal exhibitions of the period. Its façade is crowned by a great dome inspired by [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in the [[Vatican City]] in [[Rome]], flanked by two smaller domes, while four towers modelled on [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral]] stand at the corners of the so-called Sala Oval, or Oval Hall. This great space (2,300 m2), used as the venue for important civic and cultural events, is encircled by tiered seating, preceded by double columns; it also houses a monumental [[organ (music)|organ]], one of the biggest in Europe, waiting for an important restoration work. Many of the most outstanding painters and sculptors of the day, for the most part followers of the [[Noucentisme|Noucentista]] aesthetic and cultural movement, were commissioned to decorate the interior of the Palau. Entrance from the front is by a huge staircase leading up from Avinguda de la Reina Maria Cristina, flanked halfway by magnificent monumental illuminated fountains designed by [[Carles Buïgas]].
[[File:MNAC fountains, Barcelona.jpg|thumb|right|Fountains in front of MNAC]]

The first projects to develop the slopes of Montjuïc, turning the mountain into the city's ''green lung'' and a leisure activity centre for the people of Barcelona, date back to the early 20th century. However, these ideas were given decisive momentum when Montjuïc was chosen as the site for the great International Exhibition organised by the city in 1929. The renowned [[Modernisme]] architect [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]] was commissioned to direct the urban development and architectural aspects of this project, and [[Juan Claude Nicolas Forestier]] and [[Nicolau Maria Rubió i Tudurí]] landscaped the gardens. Under these plans, the Palau Nacional was to be the central palace for the exhibition. In 1923, the dictator [[Primo de Rivera]] seized power, with the result that Puig i Cadafalch was removed from the project. A [[Architectural design competition|competition to design]] and build the Palau Nacional was then won by the architects Eugenio P. Cendoya, [[Enric Catà i Catà|Enric Catà]] and Pere Domènech i Roura. The palace was to provide the central venue for a great exhibition entitled Art in Spain and featuring original works and reproductions representing the history of Spanish art, complemented by two extensions: the [[Poble Espanyol]] (Spanish Village) architectural site, still open today, and the Palau d'Art Modern (Palace of Modern Art), which was later demolished.

In the area around the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya site, moreover, many of the buildings erected for the 1929 International Exhibition remain, whilst others have also been established. All these different elements form a complex that has become one of the most attractive cultural, commercial and leisure centres in the city. The outstanding buildings dating from the time of the International Exhibition include the pavilions housing the Barcelona Trade Fair ([[Fira de Barcelona]]), the [[Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys]], refurbished for the 1992 Games, the [[Poble Espanyol]] and the [[Teatre Grec]], a Greek amphitheatre built in a disused quarry. This gives its name to [[Festival Grec de Barcelona|Barcelona’s summer arts festival (GREC)]].

== Library and archive ==
The library is the most important documentation centre open to the public. Its origins go back to the books referred to by museum technicians in Barcelona when preparing for the 1888 Universal Exhibition. In the early 20th century, the Junta de Museus (Museums Board) decided that the library should be opened to the public, and decisive impetus was given to this initiative when the Special Committee for the Library was set up in 1907. From that year onwards, the library holdings were constantly enriched by legacies and donations from important private libraries.

The Museu Nacional Library collections comprise domestic and foreign books and magazines on different aspects of art: monographic works on art and artists; photography; numismatics; local history; a reserve section containing a collection of manuscripts; incunabula such as the 1493 [[Nuremberg Chronicle]]; works published pre 1900; and the books of artists and collector’s editions. Sections of particular interest include that devoted to exhibition catalogues, established in 1913 and containing printed matter on shows held at galleries in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain and even further afield, and ‘The Press’, established in 1968, which brings together news items published in the daily media and of interest to the artworld.

It is thanks to the Museu Nacional publications policy, that many of these works were acquired – it aims to promote exchanges and so provide the library with copies of works published by museums and art centres all over the world.

The library facilities are designed to provide Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya technical staff, researchers, students, art professionals and all individuals interested in the art world with all the information they seek. The reading room provides access to the library catalogue, the Collective Catalogue of Universities (CCUC), several databases (Princeton University, Index of Christian Art; Bibliography of the History of Art; Art Price), and to databases available on CD-ROM and Internet.

Another important element in the Museu Nacional organisational structure is the archive, founded as a department in 1995 to standardise management of the museum’s documentary collections. With regard to the origin of these collections, the archive contains both documentation generated by the museum since 1991, when the consortium was set up, and historic documents from institutions that now form part of the Museu Nacional: the Museu d'Art de Catalunya (Art Museum of Catalonia), the Museu d'Art Modern (Museum of Modern Art), the Cabinet of Drawings and Prints, the Numismatic Cabinet of Catalonia, and the Library of Art History.

The archive also conserves invaluable historic documentation in the form of the collections built up by different organising committees for fine art exhibitions (1891–1946). Here, too, are other historic resources related to the world of art and deposited in the museum over the years.

Finally, the archive also contains a section devoted to the image, comprising some 350,000 audiovisual documents, mainly photographs, on different supports and in a variety of formats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museunacional.cat/en/library-and-archive The museum's library]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Museum Network ==
[[File:Biblioteca Museu Víctor Balaguer (pinacoteca).jpg|thumb|The [[Victor Balaguer Museum]]]]
The ''Museus secció'' are part of Museu Nacional but they go under an independent management and ownership is on the respective councils. Currently three entities comprise:

* The '''[[Biblioteca Museu Víctor Balaguer]]''': [[Victor Balaguer]] Museum Library is located at [[Vilanova i la Geltrú]] and was founded in 1884 by [[Victor Balaguer]] as a sign of gratitude to the city for support received in his political career. It has a gallery specializing in Catalan painting of the 19th and 20h centuries, including works by [[Santiago Rusiñol]], [[Ramon Casas]], [[Joaquim Vayreda]], [[Ramon Martí Alsina]], [[Dionís Baixeras]], [[Isidre Nonell]], [[Rafael Durancamps]] and  [[Xavier Nogués]], among others. It also features works from different periods of art history, with an Egyptian collection, pre-Columbian, Filipino, East, archaeological and decorative arts. It also has placed works of art from the [[Museo del Prado]].
* The '''[[Cau Ferrat]]''': located in [[Sitges]], near the beach of San Sebastian, was the home study of [[Santiago Rusiñol]]. It was opened as a museum in 1935, and exhibit several collections related to modernism and the artist. There is a large collection of iron, glass and ceramics. As for painting and drawing, man can see works of [[El Greco]], [[Ramon Casas]], [[Miquel Utrillo]], [[Ignacio Zuloaga]], [[Anglada Camarasa]], [[Picasso]] and [[Darío de Regoyos]], among others. One of the peculiarities is the same provision of the works.
* The '''[[County Museum of la Garrotxa]]''': located in [[Olot]], specializes in Catalan painting and more specifically members of the [[Olot school|School of Olot]]. One can view works by artists such as Ramon Casas, [[Xavier Nogués]], [[Leonci Quera]], [[Ramon Amadeu]], [[Miquel Blay]] and [[Josep Clarà]] as well as a collection of [[Art Nouveau]] posters.

== Educational activities ==
[[File:MNAC- Espai Educatiu.JPG|thumb|right|Educational space at the museum]]
One of the other aspects of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya is the number of services and training proposals and entertainment for families and schools. The museum has an educational service itself, which offers several resources for learning and services tailored to different audiences. Among others, a program is the museum common space of integration aimed at people at risk of [[Social exclusion|exclusion]] and use the museum as a key integrator and software ''Museum hosts'', aimed at integrating with other training projects related to art.

Another of the best known proposals is ''Museum as an integration space'' (''El Museu espai comú d'integració'', in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]), and also  ''A hand of stories'' (''Una Ma de Contes''), a joint initiative between [[Televisió de Catalunya]] and Museu Nacional, which explains 20 short stories representing 20 paintings of Museu Nacional permanent collection, with a different look.

There are also activities which are encouraged in the relationship between children and artists active. They participated in activities such contemporary artists as [[Philip Stanton]] [[Gino Rubert]] or [[Lluïsa Jover]].&lt;ref&gt;Tv3.cat [http://www.tv3.cat/videos/216971231 Children Artists in the museum] Accessed 04/08/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoration and Preventive Conservation Centre ==
[[File:Tests de neteja.JPG|thumb|Cleaning tests at the Conservation-Restoration Center of the museum]]
The aim of the Department of the Restoration and Preventive Conservation is to ensure the conservation of all the works in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya collections. The Department helps to guarantee the physical conservation of all the museum’s holdings, including both works on exhibition and in storage, on deposit or on loan, whilst also seeking to delay as far as possible the ageing process that affects the materials that form the artworks. In addition, the Restoration and Preventive Conservation Department also studies the materials and the technical aspects of works with a view to providing scientific and technical assistance for art historians specialising in different periods, promoting dialogue and interdisciplinary studies.

At the centre, professionals from different specialist disciplines study problems affecting the works, or changes they are undergoing, determining the causes of deterioration and doing their utmost to eliminate any risk to the works. In this regard, a key aim is to create a stable environment and to establish the best conditions for exhibiting, storing, handling, packing and transporting works. The centre seeks to minimise deterioration to the collections by ensuring that the most appropriate environmental conditions and exhibition systems are provided, as well as exercising strict control over the movement of objects and the restoration treatments applied to individual works.

Most of the activity at the centre is concerned with prevention, but due importance is also attached to reparative treatment and restoration. Restoration work is aimed at improving the aesthetic reading of pieces on which, very often, restorers from much earlier generations have previously intervened, working according to criteria very different from those applied today. Needless to say, restoration is not carried out in the hope of returning works to their original state; but rather, to take into account the passing of time and any work that has already been carried out on the piece, and which now forms part of the history of restoration in Catalonia in general.

The center exists due to the impulse that [[Joaquim Folch i Torres]] gave to the project when he sent [[Manuel Grau i Mas]] in [[Milan]] with the objective that was formed by the hand of [[Mauro Pelliccioli]], then director of the restoration laboratories in [[Milan]], attached to the [[Pinacoteca di Brera]] art gallery. The Milan laboratories had a decisive influence on how restoration work was carried out all over Europe. Work continues today with a view to establishing the Museu Nacional Department of Restoration and Preventive Conservation as a reference and resource, which may operate separately from the museum itself, in terms both of the working methodologies and the rigour and the criteria that the centre applies.

The centre is staffed by scientific personnel devoted to preventive conservation and chemical laboratory work, and by a team of curators and restorers specialising in various disciplines, in accordance with the types of works that form the museum collections: restoration of paint on canvas and transferred painted murals; paint on wooden panels; polychrome wood sculpture; furniture; artwork on paper and photography; and stone, metal and ceramic.

'''Partido Nuevo Triunfo''' (New Triumph Party) was a small [[far-right]] political party in [[Argentina]] banned on 17 March 2009 by ruling of the [[Argentine Supreme Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/03/17/um/m-01879057.htm La Corte Suprema le negó la personería jurídica a un partido nazi. Clarín, 17 March 2009]{{·}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The party was formed by [[Alejandro Biondini]] in 1990 as the ''Partido Nacionalista de los Trabajadores'' (Nationalist Worker's Party), initially as a breakaway from the [[Justicialist Party]].&lt;ref name="Kalki y las camisas negras"&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/subnotas/56374-18757-2005-09-12.html 'Kalki y las camisas negras']&lt;/ref&gt; The party leader anticipated economic crisis in the country which he felt would set up the basis for a takeover by revolutionary nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;D. Gatti, [http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/42/213.html 'Cybernetic Neo-Nazis']&lt;/ref&gt; Biondini is a veteran of the international neo-nazi scene, having established a group called ''Alerta Nacional'' in 1984, which he described as 'a small part of the great worldwide socialist movement'. This group has attempted to build links between the country's various extreme right groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jinuj.net/articulos_ver.php?id=225 '"Neo" Nazismo en América Latina']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The party was re-launched as the New Triumph Party in November 1997, identifying itself as 'the political, militant and electoral expression of Argentine national socialism'.&lt;ref name="Argentina"&gt;[http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive2/argentina/argentina.htm Argentina]&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when use of the [[internet]] by fringe political groups was limited but growing in popularity the New Triumph Party's online publication ''Libertad de Opinión'' broke new ground in Argentina by providing a regular forum for Argentine neo-Nazism and [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref name="Argentina"/&gt; [[Ricardo Brinzoni]] was briefly associated with the group as his lawyer Juan Enrique Torres Bande was a member.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://ar.geocities.com/veaylea2000/verbitsky/01-04-29nuevotriunfo.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+02:51:09  'Nuevo Triunfo de Brinzoni']&lt;/ref&gt;

The party has consistently attempted to gain legal recognition but has been rejected.&lt;ref name="Kalki y las camisas negras"/&gt; Nonetheless in the [[Argentine legislative election, 2005]] two members of the party, Biondini's wife and son, featured as candidates for ''Acción Ciudadana'', a group headed by Jorge Colotto, the general commissioner of the [[Policía Federal Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;Carnota, Fernando (1995), El Palacio de la Corrupción, Buenos Aires: Editorial Sudamericana. {{ISBN|950-07-1047-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
The party supports Neo-Nazism and seeks to use Argentina as the new Nazi base. It has been claimed that Biondini believes that [[Adolf Hitler]] had identified Argentina as the future of [[Nazism]]. He has claimed that in the final days in the ''[[Führerbunker]]'' Hitler pointed to Argentina on a map and stated that 'from there the new leader will come'.&lt;ref name="Kalki y las camisas negras"/&gt;

The party has also been vocal in its criticism of the major political parties and leaders, denouncing [[Fernando de la Rúa]] as a puppet of the [[Zionist Occupation Government]].&lt;ref name="Kalki y las camisas negras"/&gt; As part of this rhetoric it also emphasises its grounding in [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pnt.libreopinion.com/programa.htm Programme of Government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201004220/http://pnt.libreopinion.com/programa.htm |date=2007-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platform==
The ideas of the party have been summed up by them in declaration of policies which states five aims for the Argentine people. These are listed as:

* The reaffirmation of the values of Argentina, based on God and country with a firm stance taken against all who would seek to damage these values.
* Dignity for the Argentine worker, through the establishment of a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] parliament.
* Defence of national [[sovereignty]] at all costs, with a systematic programme of rearmament in order to recover the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[Patagonia]].
* The establishment of a purely Argentine economic system which would eliminate [[usury]] and unite classes under corporatism.
* A much stricter legal code, including punishments for those it feels have benefitted from Argentina's struggles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pnt.libreopinion.com/proclama.htm Proclama al Pueblo Argentino]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nicaea icon.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] depicting [[Constantine I|the Emperor Constantine]], accompanied by the [[bishop]]s of the First Council of Nicaea (325), holding the Niceno–Constantinopolitan Creed of 381]]
The '''Nicene Creed''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{Lang|el|Σύμβολον τῆς Νικαίας}} or, {{Lang|el|τῆς πίστεως}}, [[Latin language|Latin]]: {{lang|la|Symbolum Nicaenum}}) is a [[creed|statement of belief]] widely used in [[Christianity|Christian]] [[liturgy]]. It is called ''Nicene'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|aɪ|s|iː|n}} because it was originally adopted in the city of [[Nicaea]] (present day [[İznik]], Turkey) by the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325.&lt;ref name=Creed &gt;''Readings in the History of Christian Theology'' by [[William Carl Placher]] 1988 {{ISBN|0-664-24057-7}} pages 52–53&lt;/ref&gt; In 381, it was amended at the [[First Council of Constantinople]], and the amended form is referred to as the Nicene or the '''Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed'''.

The [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian]] churches use this profession of [[faith]] with the verbs in the original plural ("we believe"), but the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] churches convert those verbs to the singular ("I believe"). The [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and many [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations generally use the singular form, sometimes the plural.

The earlier [[Apostles' Creed]] is also used in the [[Western Christianity|Latin West]], but not in the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] [[liturgy|liturgies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04479a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Liturgical Use of Creeds|website=Newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiochian.org/content/nicene-creed|title=The Nicene Creed - Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese|website=Antiochian.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oca.org/orthodoxy/the-orthodox-faith/doctrine/the-symbol-of-faith/nicene-creed|title=The Orthodox Faith - Volume I - Doctrine and Scripture - The Symbol of Faith - Nicene Creed|website=oca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Sunday worship|Sundays]] and [[solemnity|solemnities]], one of these two creeds is recited in the [[Roman Rite]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] after the [[homily]]. The Nicene Creed is also part of the profession of faith required of those undertaking important functions within the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_1998_professio-fidei_en.html|title=PROFESSION OF FAITH|website=Vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P2R.HTM#A|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|website=Vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Byzantine Rite]], the Nicene Creed is sung or recited at the [[Divine Liturgy]], immediately preceding the [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Anaphora (Eucharistic Prayer)]], and is also recited daily at [[Compline#Compline in Byzantine usage|compline]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holytrinitymission.org/books/english/liturgics_averky_e.htm#_Toc104768095] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726153144/http://www.holytrinitymission.org/books/english/liturgics_averky_e.htm |date=26 July 2011 }} "Archbishop Averky Liturgics – The Small Compline", Retrieved 2013-04-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holytrinitymission.org/books/english/liturgics_averky_e.htm#_Toc104768129] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726153144/http://www.holytrinitymission.org/books/english/liturgics_averky_e.htm |date=26 July 2011 }} "Archbishop Averky Liturgics – The Symbol of Faith", Retrieved 2013-04-14&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Rylands Nicene Creed papyrus.jpg|thumb|Oldest extant manuscript of the Nicene Creed, dated to the 6th Century]]

The purpose of a [[creed]] is to provide a doctrinal statement of correct belief or orthodoxy. The creeds of Christianity have been drawn up at times of conflict about doctrine: acceptance or rejection of a creed served to distinguish believers and deniers of particular doctrines. For that reason, a creed was called in Greek a σύμβολον (''symbolon''), which originally meant half of a broken object which, when fitted to the other half, verified the bearer's identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=su/mbolon Liddell and Scott: σύμβολον]; cf. [[split tally]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word passed through Latin ''symbolum'' into English "symbol", which only later took on the meaning of an outward sign of something.&lt;ref&gt;Symbol. c.1434, "creed, summary, religious belief," from L.L. symbolum "creed, token, mark," from Gk. symbolon "token, watchword" (applied c.250 by Cyprian of Carthage to the Apostles' Creed, on the notion of the "mark" that distinguishes Christians from pagans), from syn- "together" + stem of ballein "to throw." The sense evolution is from "throwing things together" to "contrasting" to "comparing" to "token used in comparisons to determine if something is genuine." Hence, "outward sign" of something. The meaning "something which stands for something else" first recorded 1590 (in "Faerie Queene"). Symbolic is attested from 1680. ([http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/symbol symbol. Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. Accessed: 24 March 2008]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nicene Creed was adopted to resolve the [[Arianism|Arian]] controversy, whose leader, [[Arius]], a clergyman of Alexandria, "objected to [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander's]] (the bishop of the time) apparent carelessness in blurring the distinction of nature between the Father and the Son by his emphasis on eternal generation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://online.manchester.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-3688527-dt-content-rid-12460921_1/courses/I3088-RELT-10131-1151-1SE-013172/J.%20Rebecca%20Lyman.pdf|title = The Invention of 'Heresy' and 'Schism'|date = 2010|accessdate = 2015-11-30|website = |publisher = The Cambridge History of Christianity|last = Lyman|first = J. Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, Alexander accused Arius of denying the divinity of the Son and also of being too "Jewish" and "Greek" in his thought. Alexander and his supporters created the Nicene Creed to clarify the key tenets of the Christian faith in response to the widespread adoption of Arius' doctrine, which was henceforth marked as [[Heresy_in_Christianity|heresy]].

The Nicene Creed of 325 explicitly affirms the [[divinity of Jesus|co-essential divinity of the Son]], applying to him the term "consubstantial". The 381 version speaks of the Holy Spirit as worshipped and glorified with the Father and the Son. The later [[Athanasian Creed]] (not used in Eastern Christianity) describes in much greater detail the relationship between Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The earlier [[Apostles' Creed]] does not explicitly affirm the divinity of the Son and the Holy Spirit, but in the view of many who use it, this doctrine is implicit in it.

=== Original Nicene Creed of 325 ===
The original Nicene Creed was first adopted in 325 at the [[First Council of Nicaea]]. At that time, the text ended with the words "We believe in the Holy Spirit", after which various [[anathema]]s against Arian propositions were added.&lt;ref&gt;Bindley, T. Herbert. ''The Oecumenical Documents of the Faith'' Methuen &amp; C° 4th edn. 1950 revised by Green, F.W. pp.&amp;nbsp;15, 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fenton John Anthony Hort|F. J. A. Hort]] and [[Adolf Harnack]] argued that the Nicene creed was the local creed of [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds2.iii.i.x.html|title=Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes. Volume II. The History of Creeds. - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|website=Ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Early centers of Christianity#Caesarea|an important center of Early Christianity]]) recited in the council by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]. Their case relied largely on a very specific interpretation of Eusebius' own account of the Council's proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly J.N.D. ''Early Christian Creeds'' Longmans (1963) pp. 217–8&lt;/ref&gt; More recent scholarship has not been convinced by their arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Rowan. ''Arius'' SCM (2nd Edn 2001) pp. 69-70&lt;/ref&gt; The large number of secondary divergences from the text of the creed quoted by Eusebius make it unlikely that it was used as a starting point by those who drafted the conciliar creed.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly J.N.D. ''Early Christian Creeds'' Longmans (1963) pp. 218f&lt;/ref&gt; Their initial text was probably a local creed from a Syro–Palestinian source into which they awkwardly inserted phrases to define the Nicene theology.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly J.N.D. ''Early Christian Creeds'' Longmans (1963) pp. 22–30&lt;/ref&gt; The Eusebian Creed may thus have been either a second or one of many nominations for the Nicene Creed.

Soon after the Council of Nicaea, new formulae of faith were composed, most of them variations of the Nicene Symbol, to counter new phases of [[Arianism]]. The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' identifies at least four before the [[Archbishopric of Sardica#Council of Sardica|Council of Sardica]] (341), where a new form was presented and inserted in the Acts of the Council, though it was not agreed on.

=== Niceno–Constantinopolitan Creed ===
What is known as the "Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed" or the "Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed"&lt;ref&gt;Both names are common. Instances of the former are in the ''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' and in the ''[[Roman Missal]]'', while the latter is used consistently by the [[Faith and Order Commission]]. "Constantinopolitan Creed" can also be found, but very rarely.&lt;/ref&gt; received this name because of a belief that it was adopted at the [[Second Ecumenical Council]] held in Constantinople in 381 as a modification of the original Nicene Creed of 325. In that light, it also came to be very commonly known simply as the "Nicene Creed". It is the only authoritative ''ecumenical'' statement of the Christian faith accepted by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Anglican communion|Anglican]], and the major [[Protestant]] denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Religion Facts, four of the five Protestant denominations studied agree with the Nicene Creed and the fifth may as well, they just don't do creeds in general |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/charts/denominations_beliefs.htm |accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christianity Today reports on a study that shows most evangelicals believe the basic Nicene formulation |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/october-web-only/new-poll-finds-evangelicals-favorite-heresies.html |accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles']] and [[Athanasian Creed|Athanasian]] creeds are not as widely accepted.)&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/413955/Nicene-Creed |title=Nicene Creed |accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It differs in a number of respects, both by addition and omission, from the creed adopted at the First Council of Nicaea. The most notable difference is the additional section "And [we believe] in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver-of-Life, who proceedeth from the Father, who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, who spake by the prophets. And [we believe] in one, holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. We acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins, [and] we look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen."&lt;ref&gt;Schaff's [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.ix.iii.html ''Seven Ecumenical Councils: Second Ecumenical: The Holy Creed Which the 150 Holy Fathers Set Forth...'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the end of the 19th century,&lt;ref name="Kelly1"&gt;Kelly, J.N.D. ''Early Christian Creeds'' Longmans (1960&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)p. 305; p.307 &amp; pp. 322–331 respectively&lt;/ref&gt; scholars have questioned the traditional explanation of the origin of this creed, which has been passed down in the name of the council, whose official acts have been lost over time. A local council of Constantinople in 382 and the third ecumenical council (Ephesus, 431) made no mention of it,&lt;ref name=davis&gt;Davis, Leo Donald S.J., ''The First Seven Ecumenical Councils'', The Liturgical Press, Collegeville, Minnesota, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8146-5616-1}}, pp. 120–122 and 185&lt;/ref&gt; with the latter affirming the 325 creed of Nicaea as a valid statement of the faith and using it to denounce [[Nestorianism]]. Though some scholarship claims that hints of the later creed's existence are discernible in some writings,&lt;ref name="Kelly2"&gt;Kelly, J.N.D. ''Early Christian Creeds'' London, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; no extant document gives its text or makes explicit mention of it earlier than the fourth ecumenical council at Chalcedon in 451.&lt;ref name="Kelly1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=davis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chalcedon /&gt; Many of the bishops of the 451 council themselves had never heard of it and initially greeted it skeptically, but it was then produced from the episcopal archives of Constantinople, and the council accepted it "not as supplying any omission but as an authentic interpretation of the faith of Nicaea".&lt;ref name=davis /&gt; In spite of the questions raised, it is considered most likely that this creed was in fact adopted at the 381 second ecumenical council.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

On the basis of evidence both internal and external to the text, it has been argued that this creed originated not as an editing of the original Creed proposed at Nicaea in 325, but as an independent creed (probably an older baptismal creed) modified to make it more like the Nicene Creed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc03/htm/ii.10.ii.htm Philip Schaff, The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol. III: article ''Constantinopolitan Creed'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have argued that the creed may have been presented at Chalcedon as "a precedent for drawing up new creeds and definitions to supplement the Creed of Nicaea, as a way of getting round the ban on new creeds in Canon 7 of Ephesus".&lt;ref name=Chalcedon&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6IUaOOT1G3UC&amp;pg=RA1-PA3&amp;dq=Chalcedon+%22doubtless+motivated+by+the+need%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5NW0Ub0QrbDsBo2igYAD&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Chalcedon%20%22doubtless%20motivated%20by%20the%20need%22&amp;f=false Richard Price, Michael Gaddis (editors), ''The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon'' (Liverpool University Press 2005] {{ISBN|978-0-85323039-7}}), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally agreed that the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed is not simply an expansion of the Creed of Nicaea, and was probably based on another traditional creed independent of the one from Nicaea.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly1" /&gt;

The [[third Ecumenical Council]] ([[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] of 431) reaffirmed the original 325 version&lt;ref&gt;It was the original 325 creed, not the one that is attributed to the second Ecumenical Council in 381, that was recited at the Council of Ephesus ([http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/ephesus.html The Third Ecumenical Council. The Council of Ephesus, p. 202]).&lt;/ref&gt; of the Nicene Creed and declared that "it is unlawful for any man to bring forward, or to write, or to compose a different ({{lang|grc|ἑτέραν}}) faith as a rival to that established by the holy Fathers assembled with the Holy Ghost in Nicaea" (i.e., the 325 creed). The word {{lang|grc|ἑτέραν}} is more accurately translated as used by the Council to mean "different", "contradictory", rather than "another".&lt;ref name=Ethereal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.xi.html|title=NPNF2-14. The Seven Ecumenical Councils - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|website=Ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ethereal/&gt; This statement has been interpreted as a prohibition against changing this creed or composing others, but not all accept this interpretation.&lt;ref name=Ethereal/&gt; This question is connected with the controversy whether a [[creed]] proclaimed by an [[Ecumenical Council]] is definitive in excluding not only excisions from its text but also additions to it.

In one respect, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]'s [[textus receptus|received text]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds2.iv.i.ii.i.html|title=Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes. Volume II. The History of Creeds. - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|website=Ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed differs from the earliest text, which is included in the acts of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] of 451: The Eastern Orthodox Church uses the singular forms of verbs such as "I believe", in place of the plural form ("we believe") used by the council. [[Byzantine Rite]] [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] use exactly the same form of the Creed, since the Catholic Church teaches that it is wrong to add "[[Filioque|and the Son]]" to the [[Greek language|Greek]] verb "ἐκπορευόμενον", though correct to add it to the [[Latin]] "qui procedit", which does not have precisely the same meaning.&lt;ref name="Catholic Greek-Latin" /&gt; The form generally used in Western churches does add "and the Son" and also the phrase "God from God", which is found in the original 325 Creed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds2.iv.i.ii.ii.html|title=Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes.

=== Filioque controversy ===
{{Main article|Filioque}}
In the late 6th century, some Latin-speaking churches added the words "and from the Son" (''[[Filioque]]'') to the description of the procession of the Holy Spirit, in what many Eastern Orthodox Christians have at a later stage argued is a violation of [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.x.html Canon VII] of the Third Ecumenical Council, since the words were not included in the text by either the Council of Nicaea or that of Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;For a different view, see e.g. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.xi.html Excursus on the Words πίστιν ἑτέραν]&lt;/ref&gt; This was incorporated into the liturgical practice of Rome in 1014.&lt;ref name="Catholic Greek-Latin" /&gt; ''Filioque'' eventually became one of the main causes for the [[East-West Schism]] in 1054, and the failures of the repeated union attempts.

The [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity|Vatican]] stated in 1995 that, while the words καὶ τοῦ Υἱοῦ ("and the Son") would indeed be [[Christian heresy|heretical]] if used with the Greek verb ἐκπορεύομαι&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/greek/1607.htm|title=Strong's Greek: 1607. ἐκπορεύομαι (ekporeuomai) -- to make to go forth, to go forth|website=Biblehub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;—which is one of the terms used by [[St. Gregory Nazianzen|St. Gregory]] of Nazianzus and the one adopted by the Council of Constantinople&lt;ref name="Catholic Greek-Latin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;St. Gregory of Nazianzus, ''Oratio 39 in sancta lumina'', in ''Patrologia Graeca'', ed. by J.P. Migne, vol. 36, D’Ambroise, Paris 1858, XII, PG 36, 348 B: Πνεῦμα ἅγιον ἀληθῶς τὸ πνεῦμα, '''προϊὸν''' μὲν ἐκ τοῦ Πατρὸς, οὐχ ὑϊκῶς δὲ, οὐδὲ γὰρ γεννητῶς, ἀλλ’ '''ἐκπορευτῶς''' [The Holy Spirit is truly Spirit, going from (προϊὸν, a word that can correspond to the Latin ''procedens'') the Father, not as a Son (οὐχ ὑϊκῶς) nor indeed as begotten (γεννητῶς) but as originating (ἐκπορευτῶς)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;St. Gregory of Nazianzus, Oration 31 on the Holy Spirit, in Patrologia Graeca, ed. by J.P. Migne, vol. 36, D’Ambroise, Paris 1858, X, PG 36, 141 C: Τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον, ὃ παρὰ τοῦ πατρὸς '''ἐκπορεύεται'''· ὃ καθ’ ὅσον μὲν ἐκεῖθεν ἐκπορεύεται, οὐ κτίσμα· καθ’ ὅσον δὲ οὐ γεννητόν, οὐχ υἱός· καθ’ ὅσον δὲ ἀγεννήτου καὶ γεννητοῦ μέσον θεός: [The Holy Spirit, ‘who has his origin in the Father’ [John 15:26], who inasmuch as he has his origin in him, is not a creature. Inasmuch as he is not begotten, he is not the Son; inasmuch as he is the middle of the Unbegotten and the Begotten, he is God].&lt;/ref&gt;—the word ''Filioque'' is not heretical when associated with the Latin verb ''procedo'' and the related word ''processio.'' Whereas the verb ἐκπορεύομαι (from ἐκ, "out of" and πορεύομαι "to come or go") in Gregory and other Fathers necessarily means "to originate from a cause or principle," the Latin term ''procedo'' (from ''pro'', "forward;" and ''cedo'', "to go") has no such connotation and simply denotes the communication of the Divine Essence or Substance. In this sense, ''processio'' is similar in meaning to the Greek term προϊέναι, used by the Fathers from Alexandria (especially [[Cyril of Alexandria]]) as well as others.&lt;ref name="Catholic Greek-Latin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/PCCUFILQ.HTM|title=Greek and Latin Traditions on Holy Spirit|website=Ewtn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Such as St. Gregory of Nazianzen, as seen in the passage from ''Oratio 39'' cited above.&lt;/ref&gt; Partly due to the influence of the Latin translations of the New Testament (especially of John 15:26), the term ἐκπορευόμενον (the present participle of ἐκπορεύομαι) in the creed was translated into Latin as ''procedentem''. In time, the Latin version of the Creed came to be interpreted in the West in the light of the Western concept of ''processio'', which required the affirmation of the ''Filioque'' to avoid the heresy of [[Arianism]].&lt;ref name="Catholic Greek-Latin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Briefly, Arianism is a Trinitarian heresy that denies the divinity of the Son, the Second Person. It claims that the Son is subordinate to the Father, so much so that the Son is a mere creature. Orthodox (in the sense of non-heterodox) Trinitarian doctrine teaches that the Persons are distinct from each other only as regards their mutual relations. If the Father has the power to communicate the Divine essence to the Holy Spirit (which is the same thing as saying that the Holy Spirit proceeds—in the Latin sense—from the Father), it follows that the Son must have exactly the same power, since Father and Son are the same in every respect except in their mutual relation. Denying this (by denying the ''Filioque''), Catholic doctrine would argue, would make the Son subordinate to the Father, as in Arianism.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Views on the importance of this creed ===
The view that the Nicene Creed can serve as a touchstone of true Christian faith is reflected in the name "symbol of faith", which was given to it in Greek and Latin, when in those languages the word "symbol" meant a "token for identification (by comparison with a counterpart)".&lt;ref&gt;See etymology given in [http://www.bartleby.com/61/74/S0957400.html The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Rite]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], the Latin text of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, with "Deum de Deo" (God from God) and "[[Filioque]]" (and from the Son), phrases absent in the original text, was previously the only form used for the "profession of faith".  The [[Roman Missal]] now refers to it jointly with the [[Apostles' Creed]] as "the Symbol or Profession of Faith or Creed", describing the second as "the baptismal Symbol of the Roman Church, known as the Apostles' Creed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/liturgy/missalformation/OrdoMissaeWhiteBook.pdf|title=''Ordo Missae'', 18–19|website=Usccb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The liturgies of the ancient Churches of [[Eastern Christianity]] ([[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], [[Church of the East]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]), use the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, never the Western Apostles' Creed.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

&lt;!-- The following paragraph seems misplaced, as it refers to liturgical practice --&gt;
While in certain places where the [[Byzantine Rite]] is used, the choir or congregation sings the Creed at the [[Divine Liturgy]], in many places the Creed is typically recited by the cantor, who in this capacity represents the whole congregation although many, and sometimes all, members of the congregation may join in rhythmic recitation.  Where the latter is the practice, it is customary to invite, as a token of honor, any prominent lay member of the congregation who happens to be present, e.g., royalty, a visiting dignitary, the [[Mayor]], etc., to recite the Creed in lieu of the cantor. This practice stems from the tradition that the prerogative to recite the Creed belonged to the [[Byzantine Emperor|Emperor]], speaking for his populace.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

Some [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] and other Christians consider the Nicene Creed helpful and to a certain extent authoritative, but not infallibly so in view of their belief that [[sola scriptura|only Scripture is truly authoritative]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6MNUIyB37jgC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22sola+scriptura%22+creed&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RGQ5TvnoIs-4hAeytoSgAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sola%20scriptura%22%20creed&amp;f=false N.

== Ancient liturgical versions ==

There are several designations for the two forms of the Nicene creed, some with overlapping meanings:
* '''Nicene Creed''' or the '''Creed of Nicaea''' is used to refer to the original version adopted at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325), to the revised version adopted by the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381), to the liturgical text used by the [[Orthodox Church]] (with "I believe" instead of "We believe"),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.orthodoxprayer.org/Creed.html Orthodox Prayer: The Nicene Creed]&lt;/ref&gt; to the Latin version that includes the phrase "Deum de Deo" and "[[Filioque]]",&lt;ref&gt;This version is called the Nicene Creed in [http://www.scborromeo.org/prayers/nicenecreed.pdf Catholic Prayers,] [http://www.thecatholictreasurechest.com/creeds.htm Creeds of the Catholic Church,] [http://bne.catholic.net.au/asp/index.asp?pgid=11381 Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane], etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and to the [[Armenian language|Armenian]] version, which does not include "and from the Son", but does include "God from God" and many other phrases.&lt;ref name=Arm&gt;What the Armenian Church calls the Nicene Creed is given in the [http://www.armenianchurchlibrary.com/files/creed.pdf Armenian Church Library,] [http://www.stleon.org/ St Leon Armenian Church,] [http://armeniandiaconate.org/styled-3/index.html Armenian Diaconate], etc.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed''' can stand for the revised version of Constantinople (381) or the later Latin version&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{Citation |url=https://sites.google.com/site/litcomwenty/resources/resources--sunday-eucharist/roman-missal/apostles-creed |title=Roman Missal &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; Apostles' Creed |publisher=[[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] |publication-place=[[Wentworthville]] |year=2011 |accessdate=2016-09-30| quote=Instead of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, especially during Lent and Easter Time, the baptismal Symbol of the Roman Church, known as the Apostles’ Creed, may be used}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or various other versions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc03/htm/ii.10.ii.htm Philip Schaff, The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol. III: article ''Constantinopolitan Creed''] lists eight creed-forms calling themselves Niceno-Constantinopolitan or Nicene.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Icon/Symbol of the Faith''' is the usual designation for the revised version of Constantinople 381 in the Orthodox churches, where this is the only creed used in the liturgy.
* '''Profession of Faith of the 318 Fathers''' refers specifically to the version of Nicaea 325 (traditionally, 318 bishops took part at the First Council of Nicaea).
* '''Profession of Faith of the 150 Fathers''' refers specifically to the version of Constantinople 381 (traditionally, 150 bishops took part at the First Council of Constantinople).

In musical settings, particularly when sung in [[Latin (language)|Latin]], this Creed is usually referred to by its first word, ''Credo''.

This section is not meant to collect the texts of all liturgical versions of the Nicene Creed, and provides only three, the Greek, the Latin, and the Armenian, of special interest. Others are mentioned separately, but without the texts. All ancient liturgical versions, even the Greek, differ at least to some small extent from the text adopted by the First Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople. The Creed was originally written in [[Greek language|Greek]], owing to the location of the two councils.&lt;ref name=Arm/&gt;

But though the councils' texts have "Πιστεύομεν ... ὁμολογοῦμεν ... προσδοκοῦμεν" (''we'' believe ... confess ... await), the Creed that the Churches of Byzantine tradition use in their liturgy has "Πιστεύω ... ὁμολογῶ ... προσδοκῶ" (''I'' believe ... confess ... await), accentuating the personal nature of recitation of the Creed. The Latin text, as well as using the singular, has two additions: "Deum de Deo" (God from God) and "Filioque" (and from the Son). The Armenian text has many more additions, and is included as showing how [[Armenian Apostolic Church|that ancient church]] has chosen to recite the Creed with these numerous elaborations of its contents.&lt;ref name=Arm/&gt;

An English translation of the Armenian text is added; English translations of the Greek and Latin liturgical texts are given at [[English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use]].

The Latin text adds "Deum de Deo" and "Filioque" to the Greek. On the latter see [[Nicene Creed#Filioque controversy|The Filioque Controversy]] above. Inevitably also, the overtones of the terms used, such as "{{lang|grc|παντοκράτορα}}" (pantokratora) and "omnipotentem" differ ("[[Pantocrator|pantokratora]]" meaning Ruler of all; "omnipotentem" meaning omnipotent, Almighty). The implications of this for the interpretation of "{{lang|grc|ἐκπορευόμενον}}" and "qui ... procedit" was the object of the study ''The Greek and the Latin Traditions regarding the Procession of the Holy Spirit'' published by the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]] in 1996.

Again, the terms "{{lang|grc|ὁμοούσιον}}" and "consubstantialem", translated as "of one being" or "[[consubstantial]]", have different overtones, being based respectively on Greek {{lang|grc|οὐσία}} (stable being, immutable reality, substance, essence, true nature),[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2376030] and Latin ''substantia'' (that of which a thing consists, the being, essence, contents, material, substance).&lt;ref name="A Latin Dictionary: substantia"&gt;Charlton T. Lewis, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2346080 ''A Latin Dictionary: substantia'']&lt;/ref&gt;

"Credo", which in classical Latin is used with the accusative case of the thing held to be true (and with the dative of the person to whom credence is given),&lt;ref name="A Latin Dictionary: credo"&gt;Charlton T. Lewis, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dcredo ''A Latin Dictionary: credo'']&lt;/ref&gt; is here used three times with the preposition "in", a literal translation of the Greek "{{lang|grc|εἰς}}" (in unum Deum ..., in unum Dominum ..., in Spiritum Sanctum ...), and once in the classical preposition-less construction (unam, sanctam, catholicam et apostolicam Ecclesiam).

'''English translation of the Armenian version'''

{{blockquote|We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, the maker of heaven and earth, of things visible and invisible.

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the begotten of God the Father, the Only-begotten, that is of the essence of the Father.

God of God, Light of Light, true God of true God, begotten and not made; of the very same nature of the Father, by Whom all things came into being, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible.

Who for us humanity and for our salvation came down from heaven, was incarnate, was made human, was born perfectly of the holy virgin Mary by the Holy Spirit.

By whom He took body, soul, and mind, and everything that is in man, truly and not in semblance.

He suffered, was crucified, was buried, rose again on the third day, ascended into heaven with the same body, [and] sat at the right hand of the Father.

He is to come with the same body and with the glory of the Father, to judge the living and the dead; of His kingdom there is no end.

We believe in the Holy Spirit, in the uncreated and the perfect; Who spoke through the Law, prophets, and Gospels; Who came down upon the Jordan, preached through the apostles, and lived in the saints.

We believe also in only One, Universal, Apostolic, and [Holy] Church; in one baptism in repentance, for the remission, and forgiveness of sins; and in the resurrection of the dead, in the everlasting judgement of souls and bodies, and the Kingdom of Heaven and in the everlasting life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armenianchurchlibrary.com/files/creed.pdf|title=Text in Armenian, with transliteration and English translation|website=Armenianlibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Other ancient liturgical versions ===
The version in the [[Church Slavonic language]], used by several [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es is practically identical with the Greek liturgical version.

This version is used also by some [[Byzantine Rite]] [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. Although the [[Union of Brest]] excluded addition of the ''Filioque'', this was sometimes added by [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholics]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13277a.htm Andrew Shipman, "Ruthenian Rite" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1912)]&lt;/ref&gt; whose older liturgical books also show the phrase in brackets, and by [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholics]]. Writing in 1971, the Ruthenian Scholar Fr. Casimir Kucharek noted, "In Eastern Catholic Churches, the ''Filioque'' may be omitted except when scandal would ensue. Most of the Eastern Catholic Rites use it."&lt;ref name="Kucharek"&gt;{{Citation |last=Kucharek |first=Casimir |year=1971 |publication-date=1971 |title=The Byzantine-Slav Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom: Its Origin and Evolution |pages=547 |place=[[Combermere, Ontario]], Canada |publisher=Alleluia Press. |isbn=0-911726-06-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the decades that followed 1971 it has come to be used more rarely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://compassreview.org/autumn05/6.html|title=The Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church in Australia and the Filioque: A Return to Eastern Christian Tradition |publisher=Compass |last=Babie |first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archeparchy.ca/documents/Pastoral%20Letter%20on%20the%20Creed.pdf|title=Pastoral Letter of the Ukrainian Catholic Hierarchy in Canada, 1 September 2005|website=Archeparchy.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stsophia.us/Eng/renewal.htm|title=Mark M.

== English translations ==
{{main article|English versions of the Nicene Creed}}

The version found in the 1662 ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' is still commonly used by some English speakers, but more modern translations are now more common. The [[International Consultation on English Texts]] published an English translation of the Nicene Creed, first in 1970 and then in successive revisions in 1971 and 1975. These texts were adopted by several churches. The Roman Catholic Church in the United States, which adopted the 1971 version in 1973, and the Catholic Church in other English-speaking countries, which in 1975 adopted the version published in that year, continued to use them until 2011, when it replaced them with the version in the ''[[Roman Missal]] third edition''. The 1975 version was included in the 1979 Episcopal Church (United States) ''Book of Common Prayer'', but with one variation: in the line "For us men and for our salvation", it omitted the word "men".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5609">'''Oracle Internet Directory''' ('''OID''') is a [[directory service]] produced by [[Oracle Corporation]], which functions compatible with [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] version 3. 

== Functionality ==

OID makes the following features available from within an [[Oracle database]] environment:

* integration with Oracle 8i and subsequent [[Oracle database|databases]] for ease of use and administration
* a scalable, multi-platform listing structure for reliable and safe [[intranet]] integration
* [[synchronization]] of OID-based listings (also with distributed [[application software|applications]])
* integration of existing [[public key]] certificates, [[digital wallet]]s (e-wallets) and entrance privileges
* co-existence with other LDAP implementations via Oracle's Directory Integration Platform (DIP)
* administration tools, including:
** [[routing policy|routing policies]]
** system management [[object (computer science)|objects]] such as Oracle Directory Manager (also known as "oidadmin" or "ODM")
** technical support regarding the quality of the services
** delegated administrative service&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==

OID uses standard Oracle database structures to store its internal tables.

In Oracle version 9 databases, by default, many Oracle LDAP Table Stores use [[tablespace]]s with names beginning with the &lt;code&gt;OLTS_&lt;/code&gt; (and occasionally &lt;code&gt;P1TS_&lt;/code&gt;) prefixes. Relevant default schemas used may include &lt;code&gt;ODS&lt;/code&gt; (for "Oracle directory server") and &lt;code&gt;ODSCOMMON&lt;/code&gt;.

== Operation ==

The OID Control Utility (OIDCTL) serves as a command-line tool for starting and stopping the OID server.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oracle-base.com/articles/9i/OracleInternetDirectory9i.php ORACLE-BASE - Oracle9i Internet Directory (OID)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The OID Monitor process interprets and executes the OIDCTL commands.

== Marketing ==

In comparing Oracle Internet Directory with its competitors, Oracle Corporation stresses that it uses as its foundation an [[Oracle database]]; whereas many competing products (such as [[Sun Java System Directory Server|Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition]] and [[Novell eDirectory]]) do not rely on an enterprise-strength relational database, but instead on embedded database engines similar to [[Berkeley DB]]. Integration with the Oracle database makes many of the technologies available for Oracle database available for Oracle Internet Directory, and improvements that Oracle makes in the database space can instantly flow through to its LDAP implementation.

For marketing purposes, OID forms part of the [[Oracle Identity Management]] suite of [[Oracle Application Server]].

=== Distribution ===

Oracle database version 9 included OID bundled as an extra facility. {{As of|2006}} OID shipped with the [[Oracle Application Server]] version 10.

{{As of | 2007}} Oracle Corporation makes the most recent version of OID available only as part of the [[Oracle Identity Management | Identity Management-suite]] bundling of Oracle Application Server (10.1.4.0.1).

Oracle Internet Directory 11g forms part of Oracle directory services (ODS).&lt;ref&gt;

The '''rating percentage index''', commonly known as the '''RPI,''' is a quantity used to rank sports teams based upon a team's wins and losses and its [[strength of schedule]]. It is one of the [[sports rating system]]s by which [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[College basketball|basketball]], [[college baseball|baseball]], [[college softball|softball]], [[college hockey|hockey]], [[College soccer|soccer]], [[college lacrosse|lacrosse]], and [[volleyball]] teams are ranked. This system was in use in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] men's college basketball from 1981 through 2018 to aid in the selecting and seeding of teams appearing in the men's playoffs (see [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|March Madness]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/NCAANewsArchive/1981/19810215.pdf |title=NCAA News |publisher= |date=February 15, 1981 |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used in the [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|women's tournament]] since its inception in 1982.

During the 2018 offseason, the NCAA announced that the RPI would no longer be used in the [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|selection process]] for the Division I  men's basketball tournament. Effective immediately, it was replaced with the [[Rating_percentage_index#Replacement_with_NET_for_Division_I_men's_basketball|NCAA Evaluation Tool (NET)]]. This new metric will initially be used only by the Division I men's selection committee—the Division I women's basketball committee, plus all other NCAA selection committees, continue to use their own versions of the RPI.&lt;ref name="Borzello NET"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/24445390/ncaa-announces-new-ranking-system-rpi |title=New ranking system developed for NCAA tournament, replacing RPI |first=Jeff |last=Borzello |website=ESPN.com |date=August 22, 2018 |accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norlander NET"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/the-ncaa-tournament-committee-will-select-and-seed-teams-using-a-new-ranking-system-after-killing-the-rpi/ |title=The NCAA Tournament committee will select and seed teams using a new ranking system after killing the RPI |first=Matt |last=Norlander |website=CBSSports.com |date=August 22, 2018 |accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its current formulation, the index comprises a team's winning percentage (25%), its opponents' winning percentage (50%), and the winning percentage of those opponents' opponents (25%). The opponents' winning percentage and the winning percentage of those opponents' opponents both comprise the strength of schedule (SOS). Thus, the SOS accounts for 75% of the RPI calculation and is 2/3 its opponents' winning percentage and 1/3 its opponents' opponents' winning percentages.

The RPI lacks theoretical justification from a statistical standpoint. Other ranking systems which include the margin of victory of games played or other statistics in addition to the win/loss results have been shown to be a better predictor of the outcomes of future games. However, because [[Point shaving|the margin of victory has been manipulated]] in the past by teams or individuals in the context of gambling, the RPI can be used to mitigate motivation for such manipulation.

Some feel that the heavy emphasis upon strength of schedule gives an unfair advantage to teams from major conferences. Teams from "majors" are allowed to pick many of their non-conference opponents (often blatantly weaker teams). Teams from minor conferences, however, may only get one or two such opponents in their schedules. Also, some [[mid-major]] conferences regularly compel their member teams to schedule opponents ranked in the top half of the RPI, which could boost the strength of that conference and/or its tougher-scheduling teams. In basketball, the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] has successfully done this: It has become one of the top-rated RPI conferences, despite having very few of its teams ranked in the two national Top 25 polls.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/stories/103006aad.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the NCAA began to release its RPI calculations weekly starting in January. Independent sources, such as [[ESPN]] or [[CNN Sports Illustrated|CNN/SI]], also publish their own RPI calculations, which are updated more frequently.

==Basketball formula==
The current and commonly used formula for determining the RPI of a college basketball team at any given time is as follows.

RPI = (WP * 0.25) + (OWP * 0.50) + (OOWP * 0.25)

where WP is Winning Percentage, OWP is Opponents' Winning Percentage and OOWP is Opponents' Opponents' Winning Percentage.

The WP is calculated by taking a team's wins divided by the number of games it has played (i.e. wins plus losses).

For Division 1 NCAA Men's basketball, the WP factor of the RPI was updated in 2004 to account for differences in home, away, and neutral games. A home win now counts as 0.6 win, while a road win counts as 1.4 wins. Inversely, a home loss equals 1.4 losses, while a road loss counts as 0.6 loss. A neutral game counts as 1 win or 1 loss. This change was based on statistical data that consistently showed home teams in Division I basketball winning about two-thirds of the time.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/baseball/2011-08-03/rpi-formula-altering-2013-season|title=RPI formula altering for 2013 season|last=Johnson|first=Greg|date=August 3, 2011|publisher=NCAA.com|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that this location adjustment applies only to the WP factor and not the OWP and OOWP factors. Only games against Division 1 teams are included for all RPI factors. As an example, if a team loses to Syracuse at home, beats them away, and then loses to Cincinnati away, their record would be 1–2. Considering the weighted aspect of the WP, their winning percentage is 1.4 / (1.4 + 1.4 + 0.6) = 0.4118

The OWP is calculated by taking the average of the WP's for each of the team's opponents with the requirement that all games against the team in question are removed from the calculation. Continuing from the example above, assume Syracuse has played one other game and lost, while Cincinnati has played two other teams and won. The team in question has played Syracuse twice and therefore Syracuse must be counted twice. Thus the OWP of the team is (0/1 + 0/1 + 2/2) / 3 (number of opponents – Syracuse, Syracuse, Cincinnati). OWP = 0.3333

The OOWP is calculated by taking the average of each Opponent's OWP. Note that the team in question is part of the team's OOWP. In fact, the most re-occurring opponent of your opponents is the team in question.

Continuing the example above, a team has played Syracuse twice and Cincinnati once. Syracuse has played one other game and lost, while Cincinnati has played two other games and won. Next, for simplicity, assume none of the unnamed teams has played any other games.

The OOWP is calculated as (Syracuse's OWP + Syracuse's OWP + Cincinnati's OWP ) / 3.

Syracuse has played and beat the team in question (which, excluding the games against Syracuse, only lost to Cincinnati), lost to the team in question (excluding Syracuse, only lost to Cincinnati), and lost one other game (excluding Syracuse, this team has no WP). Syracuse's OWP is (0/1 + 0/1) / 2 = 0.0000.

Cincinnati has played the team in question (excluding Cincinnati, they went 1–1 vs. Syracuse) and won versus two other opponents each of which have no WP when games versus Cincinnati are excluded. Cincinnati's OWP is (1/2) / 1 = 0.5000.

For the team in question, the OOWP is thus (0.0000 + 0.0000 + 0.5000) / 3 = 0.1667

For the team in question, the RPI can now be calculated:

RPI = (WP * 0.25) + (OWP * 0.50) + (OOWP * 0.25)

Plugging in numbers from the above example gives you

RPI = (0.4117 * 0.25) + (0.3333 * 0.50) + (0.1667 * 0.25) = 0.3113

===Extended example===
Assume the following game results:

|}

Here is the calculation of the WPs, OWPs, and OOWPs for each team:

'''WP'''

:UConn: 3 / 4 = 0.7500 Weighted 2.6/3.2 = 0.8125
:Kansas: 2 / 3 = 0.6667 Weighted 2.0/2.6 = 0.7692
:Duke: 1 / 2 = 0.5000 Weighted 0.6/1.2 = 0.500
:Wisconsin: 0 / 3 = 0.0000 Weighted 0/3.4 = 0.000

'''OWP'''

:UConn: ((Kansas 1.0) + (Kansas 1.0) + (Duke 1.0) + (Wisconsin 0.0)) / (4 games) = 0.7500
:Kansas: ((UConn 1.0) + (UConn 1.0) + (Wisconsin 0.0)) / (3 games) = 0.6667
:Duke: ((UConn 0.6667) + (Wisconsin 0.0)) / (2 games) = 0.3333
:Wisconsin: ((UConn 0.6667) + (Duke 0.0) + (Kansas 0.5)) / (3 games) = 0.3889

'''OOWP'''

:UConn: ((Kansas 0.6667) + (Kansas 0.6667) + (Duke 0.3333) + (Wisconsin 0.3889)) / (4 games) = 0.5139
:Kansas: ((UConn 0.7500) + (UConn 0.7500) + (Wisconsin 0.3889)) / (3 games) = 0.6296
:Duke: ((UConn 0.7500) + (Wisconsin 0.3889)) / (2 games) = 0.5694
:Wisconsin: ((UConn 0.7500) + (Duke 0.3333) + (Kansas 0.6667)) / (3 games) = 0.5833

These are then combined via the formula
:RPI = (WP * 0.25) + (OWP * 0.50) + (OOWP * 0.25)
resulting in the following ratings:

:UConn: 0.7066
:Kansas: 0.6830
:Duke: 0.4340
:Wisconsin: 0.3403

The RPI formula also has many flaws. Due to the heavy weighting of opponents winning percentage, beating a team with a bad RPI may actually hurt your RPI.  In addition,
losing to a good RPI team can help your RPI. &lt;ref&gt;rpistats.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quadrants===
Since [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2018]], one criterion for determining selection to the NCAA Tournament has been performance against certain RPI quadrants.  Typically, a quadrant 1 win is considered a "good win", while a quadrant 4 loss is considered a "bad loss".  The quadrants are defined as follows: 

* Quadrant 1: Home games vs. RPI teams ranked in the top 30; neutral games vs. 1-50; away games vs. 1-75.
* Quadrant 2: Home vs. 31-75 teams; neutral vs. 51-100; away vs. 76-135.
* Quadrant 3: Home vs. 76-160 teams; neutral vs. 101-200; away vs. 136-240.
* Quadrant 4: Home vs. 161-plus teams; neutral vs. 201-plus; away vs. 241-plus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/for-petes-sake/article203907229.html |title=Here's a primer on how NCAA Tournament committee uses Quadrants to decide the field |newspaper=[[Kansas City Star]] |author=Pete Grathoff |date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quadrant system is still in use under the new NET system, with RPI ranking replaced by NET ranking.&lt;ref name="Norlander NET"/&gt;

===Replacement with NET for Division I men's basketball===
The NCAA announced on August 22, 2018 that the RPI would no longer be used in the Division I men's basketball selection process, and would be replaced by the aforementioned NET. This new metric will take the following into account:&lt;ref name="Borzello NET"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norlander NET"/&gt;
* Game results
* Strength of schedule
* Game location (home, away, or neutral court)
* Scoring margin — While included in the NET, teams receive no extra credit for wins by more than 10 points. Additionally, overtime games will be assigned a 1-point victory margin, regardless of the actual score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/the-ncaa-ending-the-rpi-in-favor-of-the-net-is-a-long-overdue-overhaul-on-an-outdated-process/ |title=The NCAA ending the RPI in favor of the 'NET' is a long-overdue overhaul on an outdated process |first=Matt |last=Norlander |website=CBSSports.com |date=August 22, 2018 |accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Net offensive and defensive efficiency
* Quality of wins and losses, using the existing quadrant system
Game date and order are not included in the NET—all games are treated equally, whether an early-season matchup or a conference tournament championship game. As noted above, the NET is initially being used only for the Division I men's basketball tournament.&lt;ref name="Borzello NET"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norlander NET"/&gt;

==Baseball formula==
The formula used in NCAA baseball is the same as that used in basketball except for the adjustment of home and road records.  Starting in 2013, college baseball RPI formula values each road victory as 1.3 instead of 1.0. Each home win is valued at 0.7 instead of 1.0. Conversely, each home loss counts 1.3 against a team’s RPI and each road loss counts 0.7 against a team’s RPI. Neutral-site games have a value of 1.0, but the committee is studying how to determine if a game should be considered a neutral-site contest. The adjustment is based on data showing that home teams win about 62 percent of the time in Division I baseball."&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt; The change was made because of the discrepancy in the number of home games teams play. Some schools are able to play 35–40 of their 56 allowable games at home, while other teams, due to factors such as weather, may play only 20 home games.

This adjustment replaces the current system of bonuses or penalties that teams receive.  Bonus points are awarded for beating top-75 non-conference opponents on the road and penalty points are given for losing to bottom-75 non-conference opponents at home. Bonuses and penalties are on a sliding scale, separated into groups of 25, with the top bonus for a road win against a top-25 team and the worst penalty for a home loss to a bottom-25 opponent.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

The word '''sertão''' ({{IPA-pt|sɛhˈtɐ̃w̃}}, plural ''sertões'', has no precise equivalent in any other language, but in English is approximated by "[[outback]]" or "[[backcountry]]". It is one of the four sub-regions of the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Region of Brazil]]. Its borders are not precise and do not correspond to any modern Brazilian states. Like the South of the United States, it is a region that is well-known in Brazilian culture, with a rich history and much folklore.

Originally the term referred to the vast hinterlands of Asia and South America that [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorers]] encountered. In [[Brazil]], it referred to backlands away from the Atlantic coastal regions where the Portuguese first settled in South America in the early sixteenth century. A Brazilian historian once referred to colonial life in Brazil as a "civilization of crabs", as most settlers clung to the shoreline, with few trying to make inroads into the ''sertão''. In modern terms, "''sertão''" refers to a semi-arid region in [[Northeast Region, Brazil|northeastern Brazil]], comprising parts of the states of [[Alagoas]], [[Bahia]], [[Pernambuco]], [[Paraíba]], [[Rio Grande do Norte]], [[Ceará]], [[Maranhão]], [[Piauí]], and [[Minas Gerais]].

Geographically, the ''sertão'' consists mainly of low uplands that form part of the [[Brazilian Highlands]]. Most parts of the ''sertão'' are between {{convert|200|meters}} and {{convert|500|meters}} above sea level, with higher elevations found on the eastern edge in the [[Planalto da Borborema]], where it merges into a sub-humid region known as [[agreste]], in the [[Serra da Ibiapaba]] in western [[Ceará]] and in the Serro do Periquito of central [[Pernambuco]]. In the north, the ''sertão'' extends to the northern coastal plains of Rio Grande do Norte state, while to the south it ends gradually in the northern part of Minas Gerais.

Two major rivers cross the ''sertão'', the [[Jaguaribe River|Jaguaribe]] and further east the [[Piranhas River|Piranhas]], and the larger [[São Francisco River]] is in part in the ''sertão''. Smaller rivers dry up after the end of the rainy season.

The term ''sertão'' is also used in Portuguese to refer to the Brazilian hinterland in general, regardless of region. It is this sense that corresponds to ''sertão'' music, ''[[música sertaneja]]'', roughly "[[country music]]". To avoid ambiguity, the region in the northeast is sometimes called the ''sertão nordestino'', while the Brazilian hinterland may also be called the ''sertania'', the land of ''sertões''.

[[File:2003SertaoNordestino.jpg|thumb|The Sertão (desert) of Brazil]]

Because the ''sertão'' lies just south of the [[equator]], temperatures are nearly uniform throughout the year and are typically tropical, often extremely hot in the west.

However, the ''sertão'' is distinctive in its low rainfall compared to other areas of Brazil. Because of the relatively cool temperatures in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]], the [[intertropical convergence zone]] remains north of the region for most of the year, so that most of the year is very dry.

Although annual rainfall averages between {{convert|500|mm}} and {{convert|800|mm}} over most of the ''sertão''{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}{{disputed inline|date=January 2014}} and {{convert|1300|mm}} on the northern coast at [[Fortaleza]], it is confined to a short rainy season. This season extends from January to April in the west, but in the eastern ''sertão'' it generally occurs from March to June. However, rainfall is extremely erratic and in some years the rains are minimal, leading to catastrophic [[drought]], while in others rains are extremely heavy and floods occur. This variability has caused extreme famines among subsistence farmers in the region, exacerbated by the extreme imbalance of land ownership throughout the ''sertão''.{{explain|date=November 2018}} The worst of these famines, between 1877 and 1879, was said{{by whom|date=January 2014}} to have killed over half the region's population.

In its natural state, the ''sertão'' was covered by a distinctive scrubby [[caatinga]] vegetation, consisting generally of low thorny bushes adapted to the extreme climate. Several species of tree in the caatinga, such asthe [[cashew nut|cashew]], have become valuable horticultural plants. Most of the ''sertão'' vegetation is now{{when|date=November 2018}} substantially degraded as a result of centuries of cattle ranching or clearing for [[cotton]] farming.

Parts of the ''sertão'' are recognized as a [[biodiversity]] hot-spot because of its unique flora.{{explain|date=November 2018}}

'''St. James' School''' opened in the [[Eve Hill]] area of [[Dudley]] in 1842 for pupils aged 5–11. In 1989–1990 it was demolished, then rebuilt at the [[Black Country Living Museum]].

==History==
The school was designed by William Bourne, who also designed the nearby church of St James and St John. The design was intended to reflect its support from the church.&lt;ref name=bourne&gt;{{cite web|title=St Luke Cradley Heath|url=http://www.blackcountrychurchyards.com/5301.html|publisher=blackcountrychurchyards.com|accessdate=18 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504080223/http://www.blackcountrychurchyards.com/5301.html|archivedate=4 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The school cost just under £500 with the majority of the funds being raised by public subscription.&lt;ref name=church/&gt; The running costs were to be raised by annual sermons, public donations and the two pennies that the children paid for their schooling every Monday morning.&lt;ref name="pdf"/&gt; The school opened in 1842 and fund raising methods included the selling of medallions in order that the school could be of sufficient size to accommodate 300 pupils with a new extension at the rear. An alternative estimate was that the two rooms, which could be divided by a partition, were the main focus for a school roll of 200 pupils. They were separated mainly by gender, either side in three or four classes.&lt;ref name="pdf"/&gt; Early documents referred to each side of the partition as the boys' school and the girls' school. Religious education was emphasised by concentration on the catechism, church doctrine and principles being taught twice every week. The Bible was to be read daily.&lt;ref&gt;School's Trust Deed, 1843, cited in Lineen, ''A Church School in Dudley''&lt;/ref&gt;

The teachers were judged on results and records show that pupils were just taught arithmetic, reading and writing in the weeks before the exams. The teachers were paid £60 or £30 depending on whether they were male or female; female teachers were preferred as they were cheaper.&lt;ref name=pdf&gt;{{cite web|title=St. James' Church School|url=http://www.bclm.co.uk/downloads/a4_st_james_church_school.pdf|publisher=Black Country Living Museum|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1868 the mistress of the school was made redundant when the school management decided that the boys' and girls' schools education could be combined under the previous headmaster, Mr Westbury.&lt;ref name="church"/&gt; In the 1890s the school was upgraded with plaster on the walls, heating and cloakrooms.&lt;ref name="sign"/&gt; In 1906 it became an [[infants school]], preparing children for transfer to the [[Jessons Church of England Primary School|Jessons School]] when they reached junior age.

==A free school for everyone==
[[File:St James School Dudley classroom.jpg|thumb|right|The classroom set out as it was thought to be in 1912]]
The school was refurbished in 1912, the windows being enlarged substantially, after the school first became free and compulsory.&lt;ref name="pdf"/&gt; It still suffered from absenteeism around the time of the [[Hops|hop]] harvest and the Dudley School Board issued medals to encourage attendance.

The school building was improved again in the 1930s. It remained in use until the early 1940s, when the children were moved out until the end of the war so that American Forces could use the building.&lt;ref name="sign"&gt;Museum sign in the Black Country Living Museum, on display February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The school was then open again until July 1972, when it finally ceased to be a school in its own right. The building remained in use as a school for a further eight years as overflow for the reorganised [[Jessons Church of England Primary School|Jessons Middle School]] (formerly the junior school) until a new school building opened on the Jessons site in 1980. That was the end of the building as a school after 138 years, but it survived for another a decade at its Eve Hill site. When Jessons Middle School vacated the building, it was converted into a youth centre before falling short of modern health and safety standards and was thought to be structurally unsafe by 1989.&lt;ref name="sign"/&gt;

==As a museum exhibit==
[[Black Country Living Museum|Black Country Museum]] officials decided to move the building to its current site in 1989 and the relocation was completed in October 1990, with the exhibit opening to the public in 1991. The move was funded by the [[Charles William Hayward|Charles Hayward Trust]]. HRH [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester|The Duke of Gloucester]] carried out an official re-opening on 12 May 1992. The museum drew on the memories of former students to reconstruct how the school would have appeared in 1912, using period fixtures and fittings.&lt;ref name=church&gt;{{cite book|last=Lineen|first=Anne|title=A Church School in Dudley|year=1992|publisher=The Black Country Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The '''''Tarbell Course in Magic''''' is a notable [[encyclopedia]] of magic amongst professional and amateur [[Magic (illusion)|magician]]s. It has eight volumes; the first five were part of the original home-study correspondence course compiled in 1928 by Dr. [[Harlan Tarbell]], the remaining three volumes being added on later.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

This magic volume series was originally designed as a correspondence course for budding magicians. Once they were collected and bound, the series has become an unparalleled reference standard for magicians. In its impact on the magic world, it is second perhaps in its influence on the art of magic only to [[Modern Magic|Hoffman's ''Modern Magic'']], and many professional magicians have based their careers on the ''Tarbell Course''. 

__TOC__

== Structure ==

The entire collection comprises more than one-hundred lessons in every aspect of magic including [[micromagic]]/close-up magic, [[escapology]], [[mentalism]] and [[stage illusions]]. It is the most comprehensive literary work in magic history. The original five volumes contained sixty correspondence lessons with more than 3,000 illustrations.

In addition to teaching specific tricks, ''The Tarbell Course'' also teaches [[patter]], [[marketing]], the history of magic, [[ethics]], [[advertising]], routining, presentation, diction and elocution, magic theory, [[performance theory]], [[acting]], [[misdirection (magic)|misdirection]], timing and [[Showmanship (performing)|showmanship]]. 

Volume 7 of the series was written by [[Harry Lorayne]] and compiled from contributions by other magicians; it is valued largely for its comprehensive index, subdivided by title, contributor, and properties, to the first seven volumes. 

Volume 8 of the series was compiled and edited by [[Richard J. Kaufman]] and Steve Burton. It collected Tarbell's widely scattered and previously uncollected writings on magic, which Kaufman then fashioned into something resembling the first six volumes of the course. Since most of the book was written and illustrated by Tarbell, it is linked more closely to the rest of the course than Volume 7.

== History ==

Publishers T. Grant Cooke and Walter A. Jordan hoped to produce a correspondence course in magic in the mid-1920s and approached Harlan Tarbell and Walter Baker to work on the project. Baker abandoned the project early on to concentrate on his performances. Tarbell was thus dropped from the project. 

Cooke and Jordan then approached [[Harry Houdini]] to create the course. Houdini declined due to lack of time but recommended Tarbell. Ultimately, the publishers agreed and offered Tarbell $50,000 for the course.

The series sold 10,000 copies until Cooke and Jordan discontinued it in 1931. In 1941, Louis Tannen purchased the rights to the course and reworked the correspondence lessons into book form and ultimately added three additional volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

D. Robbins and Co./ E-Z Magic purchased all rights from Tannens in 1962 and is the current publisher and distributor of the Tarbell Course in Magic.   The Encyclopedia was also translated into the Korean and Japanese language.   

The course was ultimately so successful that it became a textbook for magicians all over the world. A magician traveling in India offered to buy some of the secrets of a Hindu Fakir and was surprised to learn that they came from the Tarbell Course. In Africa, tribal medicine men asked that the volumes be sent in a plain brown wrapper to keep their followers from learning that their magic came from Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

From 2016 onward, Penguin Magic adapted the Tarbell Course for online video, with each trick and technique taught in order by magician [[Dan Harlan]]. It is released monthly, lesson-by-lesson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magic News - Tarbell Every Trick In The Book|url=http://itricks.com/news/2014/09/tarbell-every-trick-in-the-book-reviewed-so-far/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Imperial gazetteer india1908.jpg|right|thumb|''The Imperial Gazetteer of India'', 1908, showing the 26 volumes, including the first four encyclopaedic volumes entitled ''Indian Empire: Descriptive, Historical, Economic and Administrative'', and the last volume (26), ''Atlas'']]

'''''The Imperial Gazetteer of India''''' was a [[gazetteer]] of the [[British Indian Empire]], and is now a historical reference work. It was first published in 1881. [[William Wilson Hunter|Sir William Wilson Hunter]] made the original plans of the book, starting in 1869.

The 1908, 1909 and 1931 "New Editions" have four encyclopaedic volumes covering the geography, history, economics, and administration of India, 20 volumes of the alphabetically arranged [[gazetteer]], listing places' names and giving statistics and summary information, and one volume each comprising the index and atlas. The New Editions were all published by the [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford, UK.

==Editions==
The first edition of ''The Imperial Gazetteer of India'' was published in nine volumes in 1881. A second edition, augmented to fourteen volumes, was issued in the years 1885–87. After the death of [[William Wilson Hunter|Sir William Wilson Hunter]] in 1900, [[Herbert Hope Risley|Sir Herbert Hope Risley]], [[William Stevenson Meyer]], [[Richard Burn (Indologist)|Sir Richard Burn]] and [[James Sutherland Cotton]] compiled the twenty-six volume ''Imperial Gazetteer of India''.&lt;ref name="Scholberg1970"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Henry Scholberg]]|title=The District Gazetteers of British India: A Bibliography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BYsZAAAAMAAJ|year=1970|publisher=Zug, Switzerland: Inter Documentation Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A revised form of the article on India, greatly enlarged and with statistics brought up to date, appeared as an independent volume in 1893, under the title of ''The Indian Empire: Its Peoples, History, and Products.''

All of these were edited by Hunter, who formed the original plan of the work in 1869. A parallel series of publications known as the ''Imperial Gazetteer of India: Provincial Series'' were prepared.

In July 2013, the option for browsing the website without username was made available to all Internet users. On June 22, 2014, in the International Congress of Sibt al-Nabi (a) in Tehran, WikiShia was officially launched by [[Hasan Rohani]], the [[president of the Islamic Republic of Iran]].

== Content ==
The content of WikiShia includes, beliefs, personalities, books, places, events, ceremonies and rituals of the sects believing in household of Muhammad, the [[Prophet of Islam]]. [[History of Shia Islam|History of Shia]] and any other issue which would be related to Shi'a in some ways, are included in WikiShia. General Islamic concepts which are believed by all Muslims or related to the Islamic history is also among the topics in this wiki. There are also some articles about other Islamic sects.

By the end of October 2015, the number of entries in Wikishia reached 9231, and it is growing day by day. It has more than 1204 entries in English. The content of WikiShia is supervised by many scholars in Qom. Currently, WikiShia is not an open wiki, so editing it is possible only with the permission of the managers. It has about 100 users all of which are verified by [[Ahl Al-Bayt World Assembly]], but it's been said in "About page" of WikiShia that it'll be changed to an open wiki so everyone could signup and contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://en.wikishia.net/view/Wikishia:About_WikiShia|title = Wikishia:About WikiShia|date = March 22, 2015|accessdate = May 2, 2015|website = WikiShia|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neutrality policy in the concepts of Shia and the Ahlul Bayt is to be observed in WikiShia, but the contributors of this wiki consider themselves to be preaching the school of Shi'a so the entries are written to explain and defend their teachings. However, the judgment about scholarly and historical disagreements is left to the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://en.wikishia.net/view/Wikishia:About_WikiShia#Neutrality_Policy|title = Wikishia:About WikiShia, Neutrality Policy|date = May 2, 2015|accessdate = May 2, 2015|website = WikiShia|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to religious disagreements, contributors of WikiShia are asked to try their best to benefit from first-hand sources accepted by the two great Islamic schools (Shia and [[Sunni]]). Wikishia is authorize to delete that type of articles which are against the [[Islam-e-Naab]].

A '''writ of assistance''' is a written order (a [[writ]]) issued by a [[court]] instructing a law enforcement official, such as a [[sheriff]] or a tax collector, to perform a certain task. Historically, several types of writs have been called "writs of assistance".The Writs of Assistance was finally published in October 6, 1763.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendIVs2.html|title=Amendment IV: Writs of Assistance 1761--72|publisher=[[University of Chicago]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often, a writ of assistance is "used to enforce an order for the possession of lands".&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law'' (Springfield, Massachusetts: Merriam, -Webster, 1996), 538.&lt;/ref&gt; When used to [[eviction|evict]] someone from [[real property]], such a writ is also called a ''writ of restitution'' or a ''writ of possession''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/w/writ-of-assistance/ |title=Writ of Assistance Law &amp; Legal Definition|publisher=U.S. Legal, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of customs, writs of assistance were first authorized by an act of the English Parliament in 1660 (12 Charles 2 c. 29),&lt;ref&gt;George Elliott Howard, ''Preliminaries of the revolution, 1763–1775'' (1906), 73.&lt;/ref&gt; and were issued by the [[Exchequer of pleas|Court of Exchequer]] to help customs officials search for [[smuggling|smuggled]] goods. These writs were called "writs of assistance" because they called upon sheriffs, other officials, and loyal subjects to "assist" the customs official in carrying out his duties.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Writs of Assistance Case'', 29–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, customs writs of assistance served as general [[search warrant]]s that did not expire, allowing customs officials to search anywhere for smuggled goods without having to obtain a specific warrant. These writs became controversial when they were issued by courts in [[British America]] in the 1760s, especially the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]]. Controversy over these general writs of assistance inspired the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which forbids general search warrants in the United States of America.

==In colonial America==
General writs of assistance played an important role in the increasing tensions that led to the [[American Revolution]] and the creation of the United States of America. In 1760, Great Britain began to enforce some of the provisions of the [[Navigation Acts]] by granting customs officers these writs. In [[New England]], smuggling had become common. However, officers could not search a person's property without giving a reason. Colonists protested that the writs violated their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as British subjects]]. 
The colonists had several problems with these writs. They were permanent and even transferable; the holder of a writ could assign it to another. Any place could be searched at the whim of the holder, and searchers were not responsible for any damage they caused. This put anyone who had such a writ above the laws.

All writs of assistance expired six months after death of the king, at which time new writs had to be obtained. With the death of King George II in October 1760, all writs would expire on 25 April 1761. The crisis began on 27 December 1760 when news of King George II's death reached Boston and the people of Massachusetts learned that all writs faced termination.&lt;ref name="Hutchinson"&gt;These facts are established by many sources including Thomas Hutchinson, ''The History of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay'' (3 vols. 1764–1828; 1765–1828)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paxton's case===
Within three weeks, the writs were challenged by a group of 63 Boston merchants represented by fiery Boston attorney [[James Otis, Jr.]]  A countersuit was filed by a British customs agent Paxton, and together these are known as "Paxton's case".&lt;ref name="CourtFiles"&gt;Court files Suffolk vol. 572 March 1765 no 100.5156 Application merchants 19 Jan 1761&lt;/ref&gt; Otis argued the famous writs of assistance case at the [[Old State House (Boston)|Old State House]] in Boston in February 1761 and again on 16 November 1761.  Although Otis technically lost, his challenge to the authority of Parliament made a strong impression on John Adams, who was present, and thereby eventually contributed to the American Revolution. In a pamphlet published three years later, in 1765, Otis expanded his argument that the general writs violated the British unwritten constitution hearkening back to [[Magna Carta]].  Any law in violation of the constitution or "[[natural law]]" which underlay it, was void.&lt;ref name="Quincy"&gt;Josiah Quincy Reports Of Cases...In the Superior Court of Judicature...Between 1761 and 1772, at 479–482 and in Appendix (Samuel Quincy, 1865)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malcom Affair===
A writ of assistance was used in an incident known as the "Malcom Affair", which was described by legal scholar William Cuddihy as "the most famous search in colonial America."&lt;ref&gt;Otis H. Stephens and Richard A. Glenn, ''Unreasonable Searches and Seizures: Rights and Liberties under the Law'' (ABC-CLIO, 2006), 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The episode demonstrated a fundamental difference between the colonists' view of their rights and the official British view of imperial law. "The Malcom affair was a minor matter, a comedy of blundering revenue officers and barricaded colonials," wrote legal historian John Phillip Reid, "but were we to dismiss it in haste we might run the risk of dismissing much of the story of the American Revolution."

On 24 September 1766, customs officials in Boston, with a deputy sheriff, searched merchant Daniel Malcom's home, which was also his place of business. They claimed the authority to do so by a writ of assistance issued to customs official Benjamin Hallowell, and the information of a confidential informant. Malcom allowed them to search, but denied them access to a locked cellar, arguing that they did not have the legal authority to break it open. According to customs officials, Malcom threatened to use force to prevent them from opening the door; according to Malcom and his supporters, his threat specified resisting any ''unlawful'' forced entry.

The officials left and returned with a specific search warrant, only to find that Malcom had locked his house. A crowd supportive of Malcom had gathered around the house; [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tories]] claimed that this "mob" numbered 300 or more people and was hostile to the customs officers, while [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Whigs]] insisted that this was a peaceful gathering of about 50 curious onlookers, mostly boys. No violence occurred, but reports written by Governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]] and the customs officials created the impression in Britain that a riot had taken place. The incident furthered Boston's reputation in Britain as a lawless town controlled by "mobs", a reputation that would contribute to the government's decision to send troops in 1768.

Although British officials, and some historians, described Malcom as acting in defiance of the law, John Phillip Reid argued that Malcom's actions were lawful—so precisely lawful, in fact, that Reid speculated that Malcom may have been acting under the advice of his lawyer, James Otis. According to Reid, Malcom and Otis may have been attempting to provoke a lawsuit so that they could once again "challenge the validity of writs of assistance" in court. This was one of several incidents when a Boston merchant resisted a search with a seemingly exact knowledge of the law; [[John Hancock]] would act in a similar manner when customs officials attempted to search his ship ''Lydia'' in 1768.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, ''Rebellious Spirit'',12 - 32, 57 - 59, 135–36n32; Knollenberg, "Growth", 215&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of colonial writs===
Uncertainty about the legality of writs of assistance issued by colonial superior courts prompted Parliament to affirm that such writs were legal in the 1767 [[Townshend Acts]]. However, most colonial courts refused to issue general writs, and the Malcom case was apparently the last time a writ of assistance was issued in Boston.

==In the United Kingdom==
Writs of assistance continue to have force in the United Kingdom and may be used by customs officers to enter any building by force and search and seize anything liable to forfeiture.
The officer must have reasonable grounds to suspect that goods liable for forfeiture are kept on the premises and that the goods are likely to be removed, destroyed or lost before a search warrant can be obtained and executed. Writs of assistance are issued at the start of the monarch's reign and continue in force until six months after the end of the monarch's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/2/section/161|title=Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the much-hated general writs, several of the colonies included a particularity requirement for [[search warrant]]s in their constitutions when they established independent governments in 1776; the phrase "particularity requirement" is the legal [[term of art]] used in contemporary cases to refer to an express requirement that the target of a search warrant must be "particularly" described in detail.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[Maryland v. Garrison]]'', {{ussc|480|79|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several years later, the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] also contained a particularity requirement that outlawed the use of writs of assistance (and all general search warrants) by the federal government.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, ''Writs of Assistance Case'', 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Fourth Amendment was [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporated]] against the states via the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Stanford v. Texas]]'', {{ussc|379|476|1965}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and writs of assistance were proscribed.

In the [[folklore]] of [[Nepal]], the '''Yeti''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɛ|t|i}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/yeti "Yeti"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ne|यती}}, {{lang-bo|གཡའ་དྲེད}}) or '''Abominable Snowman''' is an [[ape]]-like creature taller than an average human, that is said to inhabit the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] and [[Siberia|Siberian]] regions of [[East Asia]]. The names ''Yeti'' and ''Meh-Teh'' are commonly used by the people indigenous to the region, and are part of their history and mythology. Stories of the Yeti first emerged as a facet of Western popular culture in the 19th century.

The scientific community has generally regarded the Yeti as a [[legend]], given the lack of evidence of its existence.&lt;ref name=bigfoot&gt;{{cite book |title=Bigfoot: The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality |author=Napier, John | authorlink=John R.

==Etymology and alternate names==
{{Contains Tibetan text|section}}

The word ''Yeti'' is derived from {{bo|t=གཡའ་དྲེད་|w=g.ya' dred|z=Yachê}}, a compound of the words {{bo|t=གཡའ་|w=g.ya'|z=ya}} "rocky", "rocky place" and ({{bo|t=དྲེད་|w=dred|z=chê}}) "bear".&lt;ref name=pranBobay &gt;{{cite journal |author=Pranavananda, Swami |title=The Abominable Snowman | journal=Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society | volume= 54|year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stonorState &gt;Stonor, Charles (30 January 1954). ''The Statesman in Calcutta''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=swanp882884 &gt;{{cite journal |author=Swan, Lawrence W.|title=Abominable Snowman|date=18 April 1958|journal=Science |pages=882–84|volume=127| issue = 3303|pmid=17733822 |doi=10.1126/science.127.3303.882-b|bibcode=1958Sci...127..882S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IzzardP2122 &gt;Izzard, Ch. 2, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Pranavananda&lt;ref name=pranBobay /&gt; states that the words "ti", "te" and "teh" are derived from the spoken word 'tre' (spelled "dred"), Tibetan for bear, with the 'r' so softly pronounced as to be almost inaudible, thus making it "te" or "teh".&lt;ref name=pranBobay /&gt;&lt;ref name=izzardp199&gt;Izzard, Ch. 2, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sherpa and the Snowman|author=Stonor, Charles |year=1955 |publisher=Hollis and Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terms used by Himalayan peoples do not translate exactly the same, but refer to legendary and indigenous wildlife:

* '''Michê''' ({{bo|t=མི་དྲེད་|w= mi dred|z=Michê}}) translates as "man-[[bear]]".&lt;ref name=swanp882884 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Izzard, Ch. 2, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Dzu-teh'''&amp;nbsp;– 'dzu' translates as "[[cattle]]" and the full meaning translates as "cattle bear", referring to the [[Himalayan brown bear]].&lt;ref name=stonorState /&gt;&lt;ref name=izzardp199 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pranavananda, Swami  |year = 1955|volume=30| pages = 99–104|journal=Indian Geographical Journal, July–Sept|title=Abominable Snowman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jacksonMM &gt;{{cite book |author=Jackson, John A. |title=More than Mountains |year=1955|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Migoi''' or '''Mi-go''' ({{bo|t=མི་རྒོད་|w=mi rgod|z=Migö/Mirgö}}) translates as "wild man".&lt;ref name=izzardp199 /&gt;&lt;ref name=jacksonMM /&gt;
* '''Bun Manchi'''&amp;nbsp;– Nepali for "jungle man" that is used outside Sherpa communities where '''yeti''' is the common name.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mirka'''&amp;nbsp;– Another name for "wild-man". Local legend holds that "anyone who sees one dies or is killed". The latter is taken from a written statement by [[Frank Smythe]]'s [[Sherpa people|sherpas]] in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Tilman, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Kang Admi'''&amp;nbsp;– "Snow Man".&lt;ref name=jacksonMM /&gt;

===The "Abominable Snowman"===
The name "Abominable Snowman" was coined in 1921, the same year Lieutenant-Colonel [[Charles Howard-Bury]] led the [[1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition]]&lt;ref name=buryP121124 &gt;{{cite journal |author= Howard-Bury, Charles |date=February 1921|title=Some Observations on the Approaches to Mount Everest | journal=The Geographical Journal|volume= 57|pages=121–24|doi=10.2307/1781561|issue= 2 |jstor= 1781561 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yourghusband, Francis |author2=Collie, H.

He adds that his Sherpa guides "at once volunteered that the tracks must be that of 'The Wild Man of the Snows', to which they gave the name 'metoh-kangmi'".&lt;ref name=howardBury141 /&gt; "Metoh" translates as "man-bear" and "Kang-mi" translates as "snowman".&lt;ref name=pranBobay /&gt;&lt;ref name=swanp882884 /&gt;&lt;ref name=jacksonMM /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Izzard, Ch. 2, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Confusion exists between Howard-Bury's recitation of the term "metoh-kangmi"&lt;ref name=buryP121124 /&gt;&lt;ref name=howardBury141 /&gt; and the term used in [[Bill Tilman]]'s book ''Mount Everest, 1938''&lt;ref name=tilmanP127137&gt;Tilman, pp. 127–37&lt;/ref&gt; where Tilman had used the words "metch", which does not exist in the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]],&lt;ref name=izzardP24 &gt;Izzard, Ch. 2, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and "kangmi" when relating the coining of the term "Abominable Snowman".&lt;ref name=swanp882884 /&gt;&lt;ref name=jacksonMM /&gt;&lt;ref name=tilmanP127137 /&gt;&lt;ref name=straus-Vol123 &gt;{{cite journal |author=Straus, William L., Jr., |journal=Science|volume= 123|title=Abominable Snowman|date=8 June 1956|pages= 1024–25| issue= 3206|doi=10.1126/science.123.3206.1024 |pmid=17800969|bibcode=1956Sci...123.1024S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence of "metch" being a misnomer is provided by Tibetan language authority Professor [[David Snellgrove]] from the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] at the [[University of London]] (ca. 1956), who dismissed the word "metch" as impossible, because the consonants "t-c-h" cannot be conjoined in the Tibetan language."&lt;ref name=izzardP24 /&gt; Documentation suggests that the term "metch-kangmi" is derived from one source (from the year 1921).&lt;ref name="tilmanP127137"/&gt; It has been suggested that "metch" is simply a misspelling of "metoh".

The use of "Abominable Snowman" began when Henry Newman, a longtime contributor to ''[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]'' in [[Calcutta]], writing under the pen name "Kim",&lt;ref name=IzzardP2122 /&gt; interviewed the porters of the "Everest Reconnaissance expedition" on their return to Darjeeling.&lt;ref name=tilmanP127137 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kirtley, Bacil F. | title=Unknown Hominids and New World legends | pages=77–90|journal=Western Folklore | volume=23|date=April 1964| doi=10.2307/1498256 | issue= 1304 |jstor= 1498256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Masters, John | title=The Abominable Snowman | page=31|publisher= Harpers | volume=CCXVIII|date=January 1959 | issue= 1304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman mistranslated the word "metoh" as "filthy", substituting the term "abominable", perhaps out of artistic license.&lt;ref&gt;Izzard, Ch. 2, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; As author Bill Tilman recounts, "[Newman] wrote long after in a letter to ''The Times'': The whole story seemed such a joyous creation I sent it to one or two newspapers".&lt;ref name=tilmanP127137 /&gt;

==History==
===Pre-19th century===
According to H. Siiger, the Yeti was a part of the pre-Buddhist beliefs of several Himalayan people. He was told that the [[Lepcha people]] worshipped a "Glacier Being" as a God of the Hunt. He also reported that followers of the [[Bön]] religion once believed the blood of the "mi rgod" or "wild man" had use in certain mystical ceremonies. The being was depicted as an apelike creature who carries a large stone as a weapon and makes a whistling swoosh sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B0C-IhEKrSEC&amp;pg=PA423|chapter=The Abominable Snowman |author=Siiger, H. |title=Himalayan anthropology: the Indo-Tibetan interface |editor =Fisher, James F. |page=423|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=9789027977007|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
In 1832, [[James Prinsep]]'s ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'' published trekker [[Brian Houghton Hodgson|B. H. Hodgson]]'s account of his experiences in northern Nepal. His local guides spotted a tall, bipedal creature covered with long dark hair, which seemed to flee in fear. Hodgson concluded it was an [[orangutan]].

An early record of reported [[footprint]]s appeared in 1899 in [[Laurence Waddell]]'s ''Among the Himalayas''.{{fact|date=June 2018}} Waddell reported his guide's description of a large apelike creature that left the prints, which Waddell thought were made by a bear. Waddell heard stories of bipedal, apelike creatures but wrote that "none, however, of the many Tibetans I have interrogated on this subject could ever give me an authentic case. On the most superficial investigation it always resolved into something that somebody heard tell of."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Waddell, Laurence Austine | authorlink=Laurence Waddell |title=Among the Himalayas |year=1899 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PueCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA223 |page=223 |publisher=Archibald Constable &amp;amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
The frequency of reports increased during the early 20th century, when Westerners began making determined attempts to scale the many mountains in the area and occasionally reported seeing odd creatures or strange tracks.

[[File:1937 yeti footprints.png|left|thumb|1937 Frank S. Smythe photograph of alleged Yeti footprints, printed in ''Popular Science'', 1952]]
In 1925, [[N. A. Tombazi]], a photographer and member of the Royal Geographical Society, writes that he saw a creature at about {{convert|15000|ft|abbr=on}} near [[Zemu Glacier]]. Tombazi later wrote that he observed the creature from about {{convert|200|to|300|yd|abbr=on}}, for about a minute. "Unquestionably, the figure in outline was exactly like a human being, walking upright and stopping occasionally to pull at some dwarf [[rhododendron]] [[Shrub|bushes]]. It showed up dark against the snow, and as far as I could make out, wore no clothes." About two hours later, Tombazi and his companions descended the mountain and saw the creature's prints, described as "similar in shape to those of a man, but only six to seven inches long by four inches wide...&lt;ref&gt;{{convert|6|to|7|in|abbr=on}}, {{convert|4|in|abbr=on}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prints were undoubtedly those of a biped."&lt;ref&gt;Abell, George Ogden and Singer, Barry (1981) ''Science and The Paranormal: Probing the Existence of The Supernatural'', Scribner, p. 32. {{ISBN|0-684-16655-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eric Shipton yeti footprint.png|left|thumb|Alleged Yeti footprint found by Michael Ward and photographed by Eric Shipton taken at Menlung Glacier on the 1951 Everest Expedition with Edmund Hillary in Nepal]]
Western interest in the Yeti peaked dramatically in the 1950s. While attempting to scale [[Mount Everest]] in 1951, [[Eric Shipton]] took photographs of a number of large prints in the snow, at about {{convert|6000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. These photos have been subject to intense scrutiny and debate. Some argue they are the best evidence of Yeti's existence, while others contend the prints are those of a mundane creature that have been distorted by the melting snow.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, C. (2008). ''Who's Who in British Climbing'', The Climbing Company, {{ISBN|0955660106}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Byrne reported finding a yeti footprint in 1948, in northern [[Sikkim]], India near the [[Zemu Glacier]], while on holiday from a [[Royal Air Force]] assignment in India.&lt;ref name="sikkim"&gt;{{Cite book | last = McLeod| first = Michael| title = Anatomy of a beast: obsession and myth on the trail of Bigfoot| publisher = University of California Press| year = 2009| page = 54| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_6FmjJYd13wC&amp;pg=PA54| isbn = 978-0-520-25571-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Sir [[Edmund Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay]] reported seeing large footprints while scaling Mount Everest. Hillary would later discount Yeti reports as unreliable. In his first autobiography Tenzing said that he believed the Yeti was a large ape, and although he had never seen it himself his father had seen one twice, but in his second autobiography he said he had become much more sceptical about its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Man of Everest&amp;nbsp;— The Autobiography of Tenzing|author=Tenzing Norgay (told to and written by James Ramsey Ullman) |year=1955 |publisher=George Harrap &amp; Co, Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Co. |location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson tracked and photographed many footprints in the snow, most of which were identifiable. However, there were many large footprints which could not be identified. These flattened footprint-like indentations were attributed to erosion and subsequent widening of the original footprint by wind and particles.

[[Image:pangcboche-19534-John-Jackson.jpg|thumb|Dr. [[Biswamoy Biswas]] examining the Pangboche Yeti scalp during the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' Snowman Expedition of 1954]]
On 19 March 1954, the ''Daily Mail'' printed an article which described expedition teams obtaining hair specimens from what was alleged to be a Yeti [[scalp]] found in the [[Pangboche]] monastery. The hairs were black to dark brown in colour in dim light, and fox red in sunlight. The hair was analysed by Professor [[Frederic Wood Jones]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dobson, Jessie | title= Obituary: 79, Frederic Wood-Jones, F.R.S.: 1879–1954 |journal=Man | volume=56 |date=June 1956 |pages=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Wilfred E. le Gros Clark| title= Frederic Wood-Jones, 1879–1954 |journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society | volume= 1 |date=November 1955 | pages=118–134| doi= 10.1098/rsbm.1955.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; an expert in human and comparative anatomy. During the study, the hairs were bleached, cut into sections and analysed microscopically. The research consisted of taking [[Micrograph|microphotographs]] of the hairs and comparing them with hairs from known animals such as bears and orangutans. Jones concluded that the hairs were not actually from a scalp. He contended that while some animals do have a ridge of hair extending from the pate to the back, no animals have a ridge (as in the Pangboche "scalp") running from the base of the forehead across the pate and ending at the nape of the neck. Jones was unable to pinpoint exactly the animal from which the Pangboche hairs were taken. He was, however, convinced that the hairs were not of a bear or [[anthropoid ape]]. He suggested that the hairs were from the shoulder of a coarse-haired hoofed animal.&lt;ref&gt;Izzard&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sławomir Rawicz]] claimed in his book ''The Long Walk'', published in 1956, that as he and some others were crossing the Himalayas in the winter of 1940, their path was blocked for hours by two bipedal animals that were doing seemingly nothing but shuffling around in the snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rawicz, Sławomir|year=1956|title=The Long Walk|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|chapter=22|pages=258–60|isbn=978-1-59921-975-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1957, an American [[Tom Slick]] funded a few missions to investigate Yeti reports. In 1959, supposed Yeti [[feces]] were collected by one of Slick's expeditions; fecal analysis found a [[Parasitism|parasite]] which could not be classified. The United States government thought that finding the Yeti was likely enough to create three rules for American expeditions searching for it: obtain a Nepalese permit, do not harm the Yeti except in self-defense, and let the Nepalese government approve any news reporting on the animal's discovery.&lt;ref name="bedard20110902"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2011/09/02/documents-show-feds-believed-in-yeti?google_editors_picks=true | title=Documents Show Feds Believed in the Yeti | work=US News and World Report | date=2 September 2011 | accessdate=2 September 2011 |author1=Bedard, Paul |author2=Fox, Lauren }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, actor [[James Stewart]], while visiting India, reportedly smuggled  the so-called [[Pangboche Hand]], by concealing it in his luggage when he flew from India to London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anomalist.com/milestones/stewart.html |title=Milestones – Jimmy Stewart |publisher=Anomalist.com |date=2 July 1997 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, [[Edmund Hillary|Sir Edmund Hillary]] mounted an expedition to collect and analyze physical evidence of the Yeti. Hillary borrowed a supposed Yeti scalp from the Khumjung monastery then himself and Khumjo Chumbi (the village headman), brought the "scalp" back to London &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/23/yeti-scalp-nepal-edmund-hillary,&lt;/ref&gt; where a small sample was cut off for testing. Marca Burns made a detailed examination of the sample of skin and hair from the margin of the alleged Yeti scalp and compared it with similar samples from the [[Himalayan serow|serow]], [[Tibetan blue bear|blue bear]] and [[Asian black bear|black bear]]. Burns concluded the sample "was probably made from the skin of an animal closely resembling the sampled specimen of Serow, but definitely not identical with it: possibly a local variety or race of the same species, or a different but closely related species."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 29787501|title = Report on a Sample of Skin and Hair from the Khumjung Yeti Scalp|journal = Genus|volume = 18|issue = 1/4|pages = 80–88|last1 = Burns|first1 = Marca|year = 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to the 1960s, belief in the yeti was relatively common in Bhutan and in 1966 a Bhutanese stamp was made to honor the creature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Bhutan Stamp Shows 'Abomidable Snowman' |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QrhIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UQENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5041,5654462 |newspaper=Associated Press via The Morning Record |date=10 December 1966 |author=Kronish, Syd }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the twenty-first century belief in the being has declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-08-17/news/17125008_1_bhutan-yeti-abominable-snowman |author=Sullivan, Tim  |agency=Associated Press |date=17 August 2008 |title=Yeti myth dying out as Bhutan modernizes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, British mountaineer [[Don Whillans]] claimed to have witnessed a creature when scaling [[Annapurna]].&lt;ref&gt;Perrin, Jim (2005) ''The villain: the life of Don Whillans'', The Mountaineers Books, pp. 261–62, {{ISBN|0099416727}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Whillans, while scouting for a campsite, he heard some odd cries which his Sherpa guide attributed to a Yeti's call. That night, he saw a dark shape moving near his camp. The next day, he observed a few human-like footprints in the snow, and that evening, viewed with binoculars a bipedal, ape-like creature for 20 minutes as it apparently searched for food not far from his camp.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In 1983, Himalayan conservationist [[Daniel C. Taylor]] and Himalayan natural historian Robert L. Fleming Jr. led a yeti expedition into Nepal's Barun Valley (suggested by discovery in the Barun in 1972 of footprints alleged to be yeti by Cronin &amp; McNeely&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, Edward W. (1979) ''The Arun: A Natural History of the World's Deepest Valley'', Boston: Houghton Mifflin, p. 153, {{ISBN|0395262992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). The Taylor-Fleming expedition also discovered similar yeti-like footprints (hominoid appearing with both a hallux and bipedal gait), intriguing large nests in trees, and vivid reports from local villagers of two bears, ''rukh balu'' ('tree bear', small, reclusive, weighing about {{convert|150|lb|kg|-1}}) and ''bhui balu'' ('ground bear', aggressive, weighing up to {{convert|400|lb|kg|-1}}). Further interviews across Nepal gave evidence of local belief in two different bears. Skulls were collected, these were compared to known skulls at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[American Museum of Natural History]], and [[British Museum]], and confirmed identification of a single species, the [[Asiatic black bear]], showing no morphological difference between 'tree bear' and 'ground bear.'&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, pp. 106–20.&lt;/ref&gt; (This despite an intriguing skull in the [[British Museum]] of a 'tree bear' collected in 1869 by Oldham and discussed in the ''Annals of the Royal Zoological Society''.)

===21st century===
In 2004, [[Henry Gee]], editor of the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', mentioned the Yeti as an example of a legend deserving further study, writing, "The discovery that ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'' survived until so very recently, in geological terms, makes it more likely that stories of other mythical, human-like creatures such as Yetis are founded on grains of truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/news041025-2|title=Flores, God and Cryptozoology|year=2004|last1=Gee|first1=Henry|journal=Nature News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early December 2007, American television presenter [[Joshua Gates]] and his team ([[Destination Truth]]) reported finding a series of footprints in the Everest region of Nepal resembling descriptions of Yeti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7122705.stm |title='Yeti prints' found near Everest |accessdate=1 December 2007 |author=Haviland, Charles  |date=1 December 2007 |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the footprints measured {{convert|33|cm|abbr=on}} in length with five toes that measured a total of {{convert|25|cm|abbr=on}} across. Casts were made of the prints for further research. The footprints were examined by [[Jeffrey Meldrum]] of Idaho State University, who believed them to be too [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] accurate to be fake or man-made, before changing his mind after making further investigations.&lt;ref&gt;Daegling, David J. (2004) ''Bigfoot Exposed: An Anthropologist Examines America's Enduring Legend'', AltaMira Press, p. 260, footnote 21, {{ISBN|0-7591-0538-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2009, Gates made another investigation during which he discovered hair samples. A forensic analyst concluded that the hair contained an unknown DNA sequence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syfy.com/destinationtruth/episodes/season/3/episode/309/the_bhutan_yeti The Bhutan Yeti | Episodes | Destination Truth].

On 25 July 2008, the BBC reported that hairs collected in the remote [[Garo Hills]] area of [[North-East India]] by Dipu Marak had been analyzed at [[Oxford Brookes University]] in the UK by primatologist Anna Nekaris and [[microscopy]] expert Jon Wells. These initial tests were inconclusive, and ape conservation expert [[Ian Redmond]] told the BBC that there was similarity between the cuticle pattern of these hairs and specimens collected by Edmund Hillary during Himalayan expeditions in the 1950s and donated to the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]], and announced planned [[DNA]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawson|first=Alastair|title='Yeti hair' to get DNA analysis|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7525060.stm|publisher=BBC|date=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis has since revealed that the hair came from the [[Himalayan goral]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7666900.stm 'Yeti hairs' belong to a goat] By Alastair Lawson&amp;nbsp;— BBC News&amp;nbsp; – 11:20 GMT, Monday, 13 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of Chinese scientists and explorers in 2010 proposed to renew searches in the [[Shennongjia]] Forestry District of [[Hubei]] province, which was the site of expeditions in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/2010-10/12/content_21102561.htm |title=Search for ape man continues against the odds |publisher=China.org.cn |date=12 October 2010 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A yeti was reportedly captured in Russia in December 2011.&lt;ref name="A possible yeti captured in Russia!"&gt;[http://www.interfax.ru/russia/news.asp?id=224287 В горах Ингушетии пограничники поймали существо, похожее на "снежного человека"]. interfax.ru (28 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the story claimed that a hunter reported having seen a bear-like creature, trying to kill one of his sheep, but after he fired his gun, the creature ran into a forest on two legs. The story then claimed that border patrol soldiers captured a hairy two-legged female creature similar to a gorilla that ate meat and vegetation. This was later revealed as a hoax or possibly a publicity stunt for charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=27 January 2012|url=http://www.en.rian.ru/video/20111230/170564175.html |title=Santa visits "Yeti" caught in Ingushetia |work= RIA Novosti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible explanations==
The misidentification of Himalayan wildlife has been proposed as an explanation for some Yeti sightings, including the ''chu-teh'', a [[Colobinae|langur]] monkey&lt;ref name=Chu-Teh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabernet.demon.co.uk/JAJ/E2K1954/slides/7.%20Yeti%20from%20Book-bw.html |title=Everest to Kangchenjunga 1954 " Viewing 7.

A well publicized expedition to [[Bhutan]] initially reported that a hair sample had been obtained which by [[DNA]] analysis by Professor [[Bryan Sykes]] could not be matched to any known animal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091810/http://www.thestatesman.net/page.arcview.php?clid=18&amp;id=149706&amp;usrsess=1 Mystery Primate]. The Statesmen&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis completed after the media release, however, clearly showed the samples were from a [[brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos'') and an [[Asiatic black bear]] (''Ursus thibetanus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chandler, H.C.|year=2003|title= Using Ancient DNA to Link Culture and Biology in Human Populations | publisher=Unpublished D.

In 1986, [[South Tyrol]]ean mountaineer [[Reinhold Messner]] claimed to have had a face-to-face encounter with a Yeti. He wrote a book, ''My Quest for the Yeti'', and claims to have killed one. According to Messner, the Yeti is actually the endangered [[Himalayan brown bear]], ''Ursus arctos isabellinus'', or [[Tibetan blue bear]], ''U. a. pruinosus'', which can walk both upright or on all fours.&lt;ref&gt;Trull, D. (1998) [https://web.archive.org/web/20040605022325/http://www.parascope.com/en/articles/yetiBear.htm The Grizzly Truth About the Yeti&amp;nbsp;– Stalking the Abominable Snow-Bear].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tg&gt;{{cite news |last=Wollaston |first=Sam |title=The yeti hunter |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/aug/10/travelbooks.samwollaston |accessdate=23 February 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=10 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1983 [[Barun Valley]] discoveries prompted three years of research on the 'tree bear' possibility by Taylor, Fleming, John Craighead and Tirtha Shrestha. From that research the conclusion was that the [[Asiatic black bear]], when about two years old, spends much time in trees to avoid attack by larger male bears on the ground ('ground bears'). During this tree period that may last two years, young bears train their inner claw outward, allowing an opposable grip. The imprint in the snow of a hind paw coming over the front paw that appears to have a hallux, especially when the bear is going slightly uphill so the hind paw print extends the overprint backward makes a hominoid-appearing track, both in that it is elongated like a human foot but with a “thumb” and in that a four-footed animal’s gait now appears bipedal.&lt;ref&gt;Covey, Jacob (2006) ''Beasts: Traditional Hidden Creatures'', Seattle, Washington, Fantagraphic Books/WW Norton, pp. 191–93.&lt;/ref&gt;  This "yeti discovery", in the words of ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' editor Bill Garrett, "[by] on-site research sweeps away much of the 'smoke and mirrors' and gives us a believable yeti".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

This fieldwork in Nepal's Barun Valley led directly to initiating in 1984 [[Makalu-Barun National Park]] that protected over half a million acres in 1991, and across the border with China the [[Qomolangma national nature preserve]] in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] that protected over six million acres. In the words of Honorary President of the [[American Alpine Club]], Robert H. Bates, this yeti discovery "has apparently solved the mystery of the yeti, or at least part of it, and in so doing added to the world’s great wildlife preserves"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Davis, Wade |title=The Clouded Leopard: A Book of Travels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLIdAQAAIAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|isbn=978-1-84511-453-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; such that the shy animal that lives in trees (and not the high snows), and mysteries and myths of the Himalayas that it represents, can continue within a protected area nearly the size of Switzerland.

In 2003, Japanese researcher and mountaineer Dr. Makoto Nebuka published the results of his twelve-year [[Linguistics|linguistic]] study, postulating that the word "Yeti" is a corruption of the word "meti", a regional dialect term for a "bear". Nebuka claims that ethnic Tibetans fear and worship the bear as a supernatural being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/sylvia/Tib.htm |title=Tibet: Mystic Trivia |publisher=Iras.ucalgary.ca |date=26 September 1998 |accessdate=27 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113172225/http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/sylvia/Tib.htm |archive-date=13 January 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nebuka's claims were subject to almost immediate criticism, and he was accused of linguistic carelessness. Dr. Raj Kumar Pandey, who has researched both Yetis and mountain languages, said "it is not enough to blame tales of the mysterious beast of the Himalayas on words that rhyme but mean different things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lak, Daniel |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3143020.stm |title= Yeti's 'non-existence' hard to bear |publisher=BBC News |date=26 September 2003 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speculate these reported creatures could be present-day specimens of the [[extinction|extinct]] giant ape ''[[Gigantopithecus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gilman, Laura Anne (2002) ''Yeti, The Abominable Snowman'', The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc., {{ISBN|0-8239-3565-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmalzer, Sigrid (2008) ''The People's Peking Man: Popular Science and Human Identity in Twentieth-century China'', The University of Chicago Press, p. 220, {{ISBN|978-0-226-73859-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shrestha, Tej Kumar  (1997) ''Mammals of Nepal'', Nepal: R. K. Printers, p. 352, {{ISBN|0-9524390-6-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Truet, Turin and Gilman, Laura Anne  (2011) ''Searching For Yeti: The Abominable Snowman'', The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc., p. 37, {{ISBN|978-1-4488-4764-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Yeti is generally described as bipedal, and most scientists believe ''Gigantopithecus'' to have been [[quadruped]]al, and so massive that, unless it evolved specifically as a bipedal ape (like ''[[Oreopithecus]]'' and the [[hominid]]s), walking upright would have been even more difficult for the now extinct primate than it is for its extant quadrupedal relative, the [[orangutan]].

In 2013, a call was put out by scientists from the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Lausanne|Lausanne]] for people claiming to have samples from these sorts of creatures. A mitochondrial DNA analysis of the [[MT-RNR1|12S RNA]] gene was undertaken on samples of hair from an unidentified animal from [[Ladakh]] in northern India on the west of the Himalayas, and one from [[Bhutan]]. These samples were compared with those in [[GenBank]], the international repository of gene sequences, and matched a sample from an ancient polar bear jawbone found in [[Svalbard]], [[Norway]], that dates back to between 40,000 and 120,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|title=British scientist 'solves' mystery of Himalayan yetis|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24564487|publisher=BBC|date=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The result suggests that, barring hoaxes of planted samples or contamination, bears in these regions may have been taken to be yeti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/17/yeti-dna-ancient-polar-bear-scientists |title=Has DNA really solved the mystery of the yeti? |author=Alok Jha |work=Guardian |date= 17 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of evolutionary genetics at the [[University of Cambridge]] Bill Amos doubted the samples were of polar bears in the Himalayas, but was "90% convinced that there is a bear in these regions that has been mistaken for a yeti". Professor [[Bryan Sykes]] whose team carried out the analysis of the samples at Oxford university has his own theory. He believes that the samples may have come from a hybrid species of bear produced from a mating between a brown bear and a polar bear.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20131017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lawless |first=Jill |title=DNA Links Mysterious Yeti To Ancient Polar Bear |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20131017/DA9G5VB01.html |date=17 October 2013 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A research of 12S rRNA published in 2015 revealed that the hair samples collected are most likely those of brown bears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gutiérrez|first= Eliécer|last2= Pine|first2= Ronald|date= 16 March 2015|title= No need to replace an "anomalous" primate (Primates) with an "anomalous" bear (Carnivora, Ursidae)|journal= ZooKeys|volume= 487|issue= 487|pages= 141–54|doi= 10.3897/zookeys.487.9176|pmc=4366689|pmid=25829853}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, a new analysis compared mtDNA sequences of bears from the region with DNA extracted from hair and other samples claimed to have come from yeti.

In 2017, [[Daniel C. Taylor]] published a comprehensive analysis of the century-long Yeti literature, giving added evidence to the (''Ursus thibetanus'') explanation building on the initial Barun Valley discoveries. Importantly, this book under the Oxford University imprint gave a meticulous explanation for the iconic Yeti footprint photographed by [[Eric Shipton]] in 1950, also the 1972 Cronin-McNeely print, as well all other unexplained Yeti footprints. To complete this explanation, Taylor also located a never-before published photograph in the archives of the Royal Geographical Society, taken in 1950 by [[Eric Shipton]], that included scratches that are clearly bear nail marks.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel C Taylor, “Yeti: The Ecology of a Mystery,” (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Yunjing''''' ({{zh|t=韻鏡|s=韵镜|first=t|l='''''Mirror of Rhymes'''''}}) is one of the two oldest existing examples of a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[rhyme table]] – a series of charts which arrange [[Chinese characters]] in large tables according to their tone and syllable structures to indicate their proper pronunciations. Current versions of the ''Yunjing'' date to AD 1161 and 1203 editions published by Zhang Linzhi (張麟之).  
The original author(s) and date of composition of the ''Yunjing'' are unknown.  Some of its elements, such as certain choices in its ordering, reflect features particular to the [[Tang dynasty]], but no conclusive proof of an actual date of composition has yet been found.

The ''Yunjing'' contains 43 tables ({{zh|t=轉|p=zhuǎn|l=turnings}}), each of which tabulates combinations of a particular final rhyme (listed in rows) with various initials (listed in columns), in up to four tones, to show in a grid pattern all possible syllables.  Empty circles on the grid denote that the author(s) were unaware of any word with that particular pronunciation.  By locating a character in ''Yunjing'', a reader could identify its initial consonant (by looking at its column) and its "rhyme", or main vowel and ending consonant (by looking at its row), and combine the two to obtain the word's pronunciation.  Zhang Linzhi's prefaces list a total of 36 possible initial consonants ({{zh|t=聲母|p=shēngmǔ}}) &amp;ndash; by comparison, modern [[Standard Mandarin]] only has 23.

[[Historical Chinese phonology]] uses the ''Yunjing'' as an accurate representation of [[Middle Chinese|Late Middle Chinese]] (10th &amp;ndash; 12th century) phonology.  The ''Yunjing'''s use of this system represents a significant advancement in the Chinese' analysis of their own language, and is believed to have been inspired by their studies of [[Sanskrit]] phonological treatises and [[mantra|Buddhist mantras]] written in the [[Siddhaṃ script|Siddham]] script during in the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and Tang dynasties.

==Layout==
[[File:Yunjing first table.jpg|right|450px|thumb|The first table of the ''Yunjing'']]

===Rows (Finals/Rhymes)===
Each of the 43 tables in the ''Yunjing'' is first divided into four large rows that correspond to the [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones of Middle Chinese]]: the level tone ({{zh|c=平聲|p=píngshēng}}), the rising tone ({{zh|c=上聲|p=shǎngshēng}}), the departing tone ({{zh|c=去聲|p=qùshēng}}), and the entering tone ({{zh|t=入聲|p=rùshēng}}).&lt;ref&gt;William Baxter, ''A Handbook of Old Chinese Phonology'' (Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, 1992), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  They are not explicitly marked as such, but the four characters are taken from each of the tone categories of the ''[[Guangyun]]'' [[rhyme dictionary]].  In the image at right, the first row &amp;ndash; the level tone &amp;ndash; is occupied by the level tone rhyme ''dōng'' 東, the second row &amp;ndash; the rising tone &amp;ndash; by the ''dǒng'' 董 rhyme, the third row &amp;ndash; the departing tone &amp;ndash; by ''sòng'' 送, and the fourth row &amp;ndash; the entering tone &amp;ndash; by ''wū'' 屋 ([[Cantonese]]: uk&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

Each large row is further subdivided into four grades or divisions ({{zh|c=等|p=děng}}), forming four rows within each larger row.  Characters' placement in the first through fourth grade seems to be related to their [[Semivowel|medial (glide)]] and main vowel, though their exact distinction is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter (1992), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Columns (Initials)===
Each table is divided into six large columns representing syllables' [[place of articulation]]:
*"Lip sounds" ({{zh|c=唇音|p=chúnyīn}})
*"Tongue sounds" ({{zh|c=舌音|p=shèyīn}})
*"[[Molar (tooth)|Molar]] sounds" ({{zh|c=牙音|p=yáyīn}})
*"Tooth sounds" ({{zh|c=齒音|p=chǐyīn}})
*"Throat sounds" ({{zh|c=喉音|p=hóuyīn}})
*"Tongue-tooth sounds" ({{zh|c=舌齒音|p=shèchǐyīn}})

Large columns are further subdivided into two to five smaller columns, which can represent one of four possible sub-categories:&lt;ref&gt;Baxter (1992), 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
**"Clear" sounds ({{zh|c=清|p=}}) &amp;ndash; [[voicing (phonetics)|voiceless]] [[aspirated consonant|unaspirated]]
**"Secondarily-clear" sounds ({{zh|c=次清|p=}}) &amp;ndash; [[voicing (phonetics)|voiceless]] [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]]
**"Muddy" sounds ({{zh|c=濁|p=}}) &amp;ndash; [[voicing (phonetics)|voiced]]
**"Clear-muddy" sounds ({{zh|c=清濁|p=}}) &amp;ndash; [[nasal stop]]s

The ''Yunjing'' tables have only 23 columns &amp;ndash; some columns represent more than one of the 36 possible initial consonants.  Other rhyme tables, such as the ''Qieyun zhizhangtu'' ({{zh|t=切韻指掌圖}}), do not combine the initials and have 36 full columns.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter (1992), 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
