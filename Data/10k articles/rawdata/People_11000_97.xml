      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2338">'''Abdul Hafiz''' or '''Abdul Hafeez''' ({{lang-ar| عبد الحفيظ }}) is a Muslim male given name, and in modern usage, surname. It is built from the Arabic words ''[[Abd (Arabic)|Abd]]'', ''[[al-]]'' and ''Hafiz''. The name means "servant of the Guardian", ''Al-Hafīz'' being one of the [[names of God in the Qur'an]], which give rise to the [[List of Arabic theophoric names|Muslim theophoric names]].&lt;ref name=ahmed&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author=Salahuddin Ahmed| publisher = Hurst &amp; Company| location=London| year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rahman&gt; {{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author= S. A. Rahman| publisher=Goodword Books|  location=New Delhi| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter ''a'' of the ''al-'' is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by ''e''. So the first part can appear as Abdel, Abdul or Abd-al. The second part may appear as Hafiz, Hafeez, Hafid, Hafeedh or in other ways. The whole name is subject to variable spacing and hyphenation. 

It may refer to:
*[[Abdul Hafeez]], known as Senior Brigadier General  of Pakistan ( 1954 ) Pakistani Social Activist
*[[Abdul Hafiz Mohamed Barakatullah]], known as Maulavi Barkatullah (1854–1927), Indian independence activist

'''Ann Foster''' (c. 1617 – December 3, 1692) was an [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]] widow accused of [[witchcraft]] during the [[Salem witch trials]].&lt;ref name="Ray 2015 p. 98"&gt;{{cite book | last=Ray | first=B.C. | title=Satan and Salem: The Witch-Hunt Crisis of 1692 | publisher=[[University of Virginia Press]] | year=2015 | isbn=978-0-8139-3708-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yW2pBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT98 | accessdate=July 30, 2016 | pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beau 2016 p. 127"&gt;{{cite book | last=Beau | first=B.F.L. | title=The Story of the Salem Witch Trials | publisher=[[Routledge]] | year=2016 | isbn=978-1-315-50904-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ugo3DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127 | accessdate=July 30, 2016 | page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and family==

Ann (née Alcock) married Andrew Foster and settled in [[Andover, Massachusetts]]. They had five children: Andrew, Abraham, Sarah (Mrs. Kemp), Hannah (Mrs. Stone, whose husband, Hugh Stone, killed her in a drunken rage in 1689, and was hanged), and Mary (Mrs. Lacey).{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Accusation and trial==
{{onesource|section|date=January 2018}}
In 1692, when a woman named Elizabeth Ballard came down with a fever that baffled doctors, witchcraft was suspected, and a search for the responsible witch began. Two afflicted girls from Salem village, [[Ann Putnam]] and [[Mary Walcott]], were taken to Andover to seek out the witch, and fell into fits at the sight of Ann Foster.

Ann, seven years a widow, was arrested and taken to Salem prison. Foster's daughter, Mary Foster Lacey, and her daughter, named Mary Lacey Kemp (called "Mary Lacey Jr."), were accused of witchcraft as well.

A close reading of the trial transcripts&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ostinatoguitars.com//ghtout/npr7.htm Trial Transcripts&lt;/ref&gt; reveals Ann resisted confessing to the crimes she was accused of, despite being "put to the question" (i.e. [[torture]]d) multiple times over a period of days. 

Her resolve broke when her daughter, Mary Lacey Sr., similarly accused of witchcraft, accused her own mother Ann of the crime, likely to save herself and her child. Ann's subsequent confession was an apparent attempt to shield her daughter.

==Death==
Convicted, Ann died in the Salem jail on December 3, 1692, aged around 75, after 21 weeks of imprisonment before the trials were discredited and ended. Her son, Abraham, later petitioned the authorities to clear her name ("remove the attainder") and reimburse the family for the expenses associated with her incarceration and burial; the petition is also posted

He lives in [[Italy]] and works for [[UNHCR]].&lt;ref name="frontierenews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frontierenews.it/2013/06/il-canto-del-rifugiato-questo-momento-mi-appartiene/|title=Il canto del rifugiato: &amp;#8220;Questo momento mi appartiene&amp;#8221;  &amp;#124;  Frontiere|publisher=frontierenews.it|accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aljazeera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/12/20111211135052458863.html|title=Europe no sanctuary for Afghan asylum seekers - Features - Al Jazeera English|publisher=aljazeera.com|accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Basir Ahang has received his diploma from Mir Adina High School in Malistan-Ghazni, and has received his [[bachelor]] degree in [[Persian language|Persian]] [[Literature]] from [[Kabul University]] in 2007. While studying at Kabul University, he has been collaborating with different national and international media. He is one of [[Radio]] Malistan founders. Basir Ahang is best known for his social and cultural as well as human rights activities both in Afghanistan and in Europe that makes him an effective and influential figure among the youth.

== Moving to Italy ==

After receiving security alerts for his activities in Afghanistan, Basir Ahang moved to Italy In 2008 where he continued his studies in [[International Relations]] in [[Padua University]]. In 2009, after being informed about the condition of the Afghanistan [[asylum seekers]] in [[Greece]], he went to [[Patras]] city with a team of MSF (doctors without borders) and Italian [[advocates]] and journalists. His first reports in Persian that were published on Kabul Press,&lt;ref name="kabulpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kabulpress.org/my/spip.php?auteur957|title=بصیر آهنگ - Kabul Press &amp;#124; Afghanistan Press &amp;#124; کابل پرس &amp;#124; افغانستان پرس|publisher=kabulpress.org|accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Italian on Italian news websites,&lt;ref name="ilprimoamore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilprimoamore.com/blogNEW/blogDATA/spip.php?article6|title=il primo amore|publisher=ilprimoamore.com|accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; shocked everyone, as no one had such first-person detailed reports from refugees and asylum seekers in Greece that far.
Basir Ahang is a member of [[International Federation of Journalists]] since January 2009.

On March 31, 2009, the [[Italian parliament]] showed a reaction to one of his reports on misbehavior of Italian police with a minor named Ali Dad who was thirteen. The parliament asked the authorities to pursue the case. Basir Ahang made a documentary about the [[refugees]] and asylum seekers in Greece and after a part of this documentary was broadcast on Rai,”1” Italy’s public television, it caught the attention of journalists and human rights organizations and they were pushed to go to Greece to be able to see the condition of refugees and the violation of their rights and report on it. After these events in May 2009, some lawyers and human rights activists filed a complaint in the [[European Human Rights Court]] in [[Strasbourg]] [[France]],&lt;ref name="meltingpot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meltingpot.org/Una-speranza-per-i-profughi-di-Patrasso.html#.Uw415_ldWSq|title=Una speranza per i profughi di Patrasso - Progetto Melting Pot Europa|publisher=meltingpot.org|accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the Italian and the Greek governments for their misbehavior and violation of refugees’ rights in these two countries. In this complaint, they asked the EHRC to prevent the systematic refugee’s rights violation, by putting pressure on the Italian and Greek governments. The complaint is still in process after the EHRC has accepted the claim. The complaint includes files of 54 asylum seekers from Afghanistan and [[Somalia]] who were tortured by the Italian and Greek police.

== Writing and journalistic activities ==

Out of many articles in Italian about human rights and [[socio-political crisis]] in Afghanistan, three of Ahang’s articles are published in the books below;

1-	Geopolitics of Peace 2009 Venice-Italy
2-	Afghanistan; Cuore, Fede e Ragione 2012 Milan-Italy
3-	Ripartire 2013 Rome- Italy

Ahang has so far, written hundreds of reports on refugees and their legal rights, [[women rights]], [[freedom of speech]] and human rights violation]] in Afghanistan. His articles are written in Persian, Italian and English which are published in different online and printing media such as; [[Kabul Press]], [[BBC Persian]]&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/world/2010/12/101209_hn_afghan_refugees_greece_081210.shtml|title=BBC فارسی - جهان - آلبوم عکس: پناهجویان افغانی در یونان|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brooks John Joseph Mileson''' (13 November 1947&amp;nbsp;– 3 November 2008) was an English businessman and the owner of now dissolved professional [[Association football|football]] club [[Gretna F.C.|Gretna]] as well as being a philanthropist to 70 [[Non-League football|non-League]] clubs.

==Early life==
The eldest son of parents who were both members of [[the Salvation Army]], Mileson and his four siblings were born in [[Pennywell]], an estate in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], England. All the children were committed [[Christian]]s who were given a good education, brought up in a poor household. Told he would never make the sports team after breaking his back in a [[quarry]] aged 11, Mileson took up [[running]]. He won the bronze medal in the 1967 English [[Cross country running|cross country]] junior championships&amp;nbsp;– then immediately stopped: "It was the happiest day of my life. I hated every minute of running, but I had something to prove."&lt;ref name="Scotsman1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.scotsman.com/opinion/A-dream-gone-up-in.3882969.jp|title=A dream gone up in smoke&amp;nbsp;— Profile: Brooks Mileson|publisher=The Scotsman|date=2008-03-16|accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
Starting out from school and working in the construction industry, after the then [[Durham, England|Durham]]-based Mileson was made redundant in 1982, he set up his first construction firm, before branching out into [[insurance]]. Although estimates of his wealth varied, he was said to have sold two companies for £17m and £48.6m,&lt;ref name="Scotsman1"/&gt; with the highest tabloid estimates at over £75 million, according to a profile in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.''

Towards the end of his tenure at [[Gretna F.C.|Gretna]], Mileson was reported to be heavily in debt, with his personal bank account reported to be overdrawn by almost half a million pounds. Mileson was posthumously declared bankrupt in February 2010, after a businessman who was owed £1.85 million by Mileson made an application to Carlisle County Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/gretnafc/Sad-decline-of-Brooks-Mileson39s.6250967.jp|title=Sad decline of Brooks Mileson's mansion as judge approves repossession|first=Patrick|last=Hill|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=24 April 2010|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
Mileson was a devotee of grass-roots football,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mileson to help fans buy Dundee|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2006-05-20|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/d/dundee/5001272.stm|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made donations to several football trusts, including [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle]]'s United Trust, [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]]'s Arab Trust, [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]]'s Honest Men Trust,  [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]]'s Dee4life Trust  and [[Berwick Rangers F.C.|Berwick Rangers]]'s Supporters Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Halliday|title=Gretna bubbly as promotion looms|publisher=[[The Scotsman]] |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=393&amp;id=241992005|date=2005-03-05|accessdate=2006-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mileson was made an honorary vice president of the [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] Supporters' Trust for the support and guidance he provided during their takeover of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brookes Mileson becomes Honorary Vice-President|publisher=Stockport County Trust|date=August 2005|url=http://www.stockportcountytrust.com/news/n0605_brookes.asp|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the president of [[Whitby Town F.C.|Whitby Town]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Club|publisher=Whitby Town|url=http://www.whitby-town.com/info.php|accessdate=2008-03-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130209052335/http://www.whitby-town.com/info.php|archivedate=2013-02-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sponsor of the [[Northern League (football)|Northern League]].&lt;ref name="love"/&gt;

He failed in an attempt to buy [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]], a team he supported.&lt;ref name="love"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Nick|title=Brooks Mileson: 'This club is in my soul.

(1878)|Airdrie]].&lt;ref name = "gretna"/&gt; Mileson took control of the club and invested heavily in the team, and they were promoted from the [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Scottish Third Division]] to the [[Scottish Premier League]] in three consecutive seasons.&lt;ref name = "gretna"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gretna fairytale continues |publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 April 2007|first=Colin|last=Moffat|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/g/gretna/6530071.stm|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gretna also reached the [[2006 Scottish Cup Final]] as a [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]] club, only losing to [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] in a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]].&lt;ref name = "gretna"/&gt;

'''Bruno Bauer''' ({{IPA-de|baʊɐ|lang}}; 6 September 1809{{snd}}13 April 1882) was a German philosopher and historian.  As a student of [[G. W. F. Hegel]], Bauer was a radical [[Rationalism|Rationalist]] in philosophy, politics and [[Biblical criticism]].  Bauer investigated the sources of the [[New Testament]] and, beginning with Hegel's Hellenophile orientation, concluded that early Christianity owed more to [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophy ([[Stoicism]]) than to [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;see Bauer's work "Christus und die Caesaren" (English: ''Christ and the Caesars'')&lt;/ref&gt;  Bruno Bauer is also known by his association and sharp break with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], and by his later association with [[Max Stirner]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Starting in 1840, he began a series of works arguing that Jesus was a 2nd-century fusion of Jewish, Greek, and Roman theology.&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;[[Will Durant|Durant, Will]]. Caesar and Christ. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Bauer was the son of a painter in a [[porcelain]] factory and his wife at [[Eisenberg, Thuringia|Eisenberg]] in [[Saxe-Altenburg]], and became one of the great scholars of the 19th century.

Bauer studied at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in Berlin from Spring 1828 to Spring 1832.  He became associated with the so-called [[Right Hegelians]] under [[Philip Marheineke]], who engaged Bauer years later to edit the second edition of Hegel's ''Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion 1818–1832''.  This was to become one of Bauer's best-known works—a three-volume, critical edition.

In 1834 he began to teach in Berlin as a licentiate of theology, and in 1839 was transferred to the [[University of Bonn]].

In 1838 he published his ''Kritische Darstellung der Religion des Alten Testaments'' (Critical Exhibition of the Religion of the Old Testament) in two volumes.  This work showed Bauer was faithful to the Hegelian Rationalist theology that interpreted all miracles in Naturalistic terms.

Consistent with his Hegelian Rationalism, Bauer continued in 1840 with, ''Kritik der evangelischen Geschichte des Johannes'' (Critique of the Evangelical History of John).  In 1841 Bauer continued his Rationalist theme with, ''Kritik der evangelischen Geschichte der Synoptiker'' (''Critique of the Evangelical History of the [[Synoptic Gospels|Synoptics]]'').

At no time in his writing was Bauer ever an orthodox Christian.  From his earliest days of academic scholarship under Hegel, Bauer maintained a firm criticism of [[Immanuel Kant]] and a firm fealty to both Hegel's dialectic and his Rationalist Theology.

Accused of being a so-called "Right Hegelian" (cf. [[David Strauss]], ''In Defense of My 'Life of Jesus' Against the Hegelians'', 1838), he was later accused of being a "Left Hegelian" because of his association, or rather his early leadership, of the [[Young Hegelians]].  Yet the labels of 'Left' and 'Right' were only placed on Bruno Bauer by others; never by himself.  Bauer considered himself simply a Hegelian.

From 1839 to 1841, Bauer was a teacher, mentor and close friend of [[Karl Marx]], but in 1841 they came to a break.  Marx, with [[Friedrich Engels]], had formulated a socialist and communistic programme that Bruno Bauer firmly rejected.  Marx and Engels in turn expressed their break with Bauer in two books: ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'' (1845) and ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1846).

The Prussian Minister of Education, [[Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein|Altenstein]], sent Bauer to the [[University of Bonn]], to protect his Rationalist Theology from the critique of the Berlin orthodox, as well as to win over Bonn University to Hegelianism.  Bauer, however, created many enemies at [[pietist]]-dominated Bonn university, where he openly taught [[Rationalism]] in his new position as professor of theology. Bauer attested in letters during this time that he tried to provoke a scandal, to force the government either to give complete freedom of science and teaching to its university professors, or to openly express its anti-enlightenment position by removing him from his post.

The pro-Hegelian minister Altenstein had died and been replaced by the anti-Hegelian Eichhorn.  The government officials asked for advice from the theology departments of its universities. Except for the Hegelian [[Marheineke]], most said that a professor of Protestant theology should not be allowed to teach "atheism" to his student priests. As Bauer was unwilling to compromise his Rationalism, the Prussian government in 1842 revoked his teaching license. After the setbacks of the [[revolutions of 1848]], Bauer left the city.  He lived an [[ascetic]] and [[Stoicism|stoic]] life in the countryside of [[Rixdorf]] near Berlin.

Bauer continued to write, including more than nine theological tomes, in twelve lengthy volumes.  His lengthy volumes varied between theology, modern history and politics.  He published them at his own expense while working at his family's tobacco shop.

Between 1843 and 1845 Bauer published ''Geschichte der Politik, Kultur und Aufklärung des 18ten Jahrhunderts'' (''History of Politics, Culture and Enlightenment in the 18th Century'', in 4 volumes).  In 1847 Bauer published ''Geschichte der französischen Revolution'' (''History of the French Revolution'', in 3 volumes).

Between 1850 and 1852 Bauer published ''Kritik der Evangelien und Geschichte ihres Ursprungs'' (''A Critique of the Gospels and a History of their Origin''), as well as ''Kritik der paulinischen Briefe'' (''Critique of the Pauline Epistles'').  In these works Bauer led the academic movement to subject the Bible to historical and literary criticism.

In 1877 Bauer published ''Christus und die Caesaren'' (''Christ and the Caesars''), and in 1882 he published ''Disraelis romantischer und Bismarcks socialistischer Imperialismus'' (''Disraeli's Romantic and Bismarck's Socialist Imperialism'').

Bauer's final book on theology, ''Christ and the Caesars'' (1877), was his crowning effort to justify Hegel's position that Christian theology owed at least as much to Greco-Roman classical philosophy as it owed to Judaism.

Bruno Bauer died at Rixdorf in 1882.  His younger brother, [[Edgar Bauer|Edgar]], was a German left-wing journalist who had supported his brother's fights and was sent to prison for his political positions. He later became a police spy in London for the Danish government, reporting about Karl Marx, among others.

== Conflict with David Strauss ==

Shortly after the death of [[Hegel]], another writer, [[David Strauss]], who had been a reader of Hegel's writings, arrived in Berlin (1831).  As a student of [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] he wrote a controversial book which is now famous, entitled, ''The Life of Jesus Critically Examined'', usually referred to as ''The Life of Jesus'' (1835).  In this book David Strauss announced his own landmark theory of 'demythologization' as an approach to the Gospels, but he also attempted to use Hegel's name and fame in his book as a marketing ploy.

In the year of its publication, Strauss' book raised a storm of controversy.  The Prussian king [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV]] tightened control of the Prussian University system, favoring his ultra-conservative approach to the Bible.  He objected to the writing of David Strauss, and he also mistakenly believed that the Hegelian school in general was its source.

Bruno Bauer, at 26 years of age, was chosen by the Hegelians to refute David Strauss in the Hegelian "Journal für wissenschaftliche Kritik" (Journal of Philosophical Criticism).  Bauer ably showed that Strauss misrepresented Hegel, and that Strauss' position differed significantly from Hegel's.  Bauer also demonstrated that David Strauss' so-called dialectic was taken from Schleiermacher (who had been antagonistic toward Hegel).

Although Strauss' book had sold well throughout Europe, in 1838 Strauss published a rebuttal to Bruno Bauer in a booklet entitled, ''In Defense of my Life of Jesus against the Hegelians''.  In that book Strauss admitted publicly that his position had not been inspired by Hegel's philosophy after all, nor by Hegel's theological position (which advocated a dialectical Trinity).  Strauss divorced himself from the Hegelians with this booklet, and never joined their ranks again.

However, in this final exchange with the Hegelians, he criticised the Hegelian school in a way that has become unforgettable.  In that booklet David Strauss invented terms still in use today: a [[Right Hegelian]] would uncritically defend all positions of orthodox Christian theology, he said, while a [[Left Hegelian]] takes a liberal and progressive approach to Scripture.  A "Centrist Hegelian" would take the middle road and try to honor both: whatever was rational in theological thinking as well as free scientific thought.

The Prussian monarch, objecting to these debates, banned many Hegelians from teaching in Universities, including Bruno Bauer.  For the rest of his life, Bauer continued to be bitter towards David Strauss.

For example, when Bauer was middle-aged, a youthful [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] came to visit him, seeking advice from a well-known author (because Bruno Bauer did remain well known during his lifetime).  Bauer encouraged Nietzsche to criticize David Strauss, and in that early period, that is exactly what young Nietzsche did.  Nietzsche in turn mentions later that Bruno Bauer was "my entire reading public".&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche, Friedrich]], Genealogy of Morals and Ecce Homo, Ecce Homo, page 278 (Random House: Vintage Books Edition, 1989, Walter Kaufmann, ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views on Christian origins ==
Bauer wrote criticism of the [[New Testament]]. [[David Strauss]], in his ''Life of Jesus'', had accounted for the Gospel narratives as half-conscious products of the mythic instinct in the early Christian communities. Bauer ridiculed Strauss's notion that a community could produce a connected narrative.  Rather, only a single writer could be responsible for the first Gospel.  His own contention, embodying a theory of [[Christian Gottlob Wilke]] (''Der Urevangelist'', 1838), was that the original narrative was the [[Gospel of Mark]].

For Bruno Bauer, the [[Gospel of Mark]] was completed in the reign (117–138) of [[Hadrian]] (where its prototype, the 'Ur-Marcus,' identifiable within the [[Gospel of Mark]] by a critical analysis, was begun around the time of Josephus and the Roman-Jewish Wars). Bauer, like other advocates of this '[[Markan priority|Marcan Hypothesis]]', affirmed that all the other Gospel narratives used the [[Gospel of Mark]] as their model within their writing communities.

In 1906 [[Albert Schweitzer]] wrote that Bauer "originally sought to defend the honor of Jesus by rescuing his reputation from the inane parody of a biography that the Christian apologists had forged." However, he eventually came to the belief that it was a complete fiction and "regarded the Gospel of Mark not only as the first narrator, but even as the creator of the gospel history, thus making the latter a fiction and Christianity the invention of a single original evangelist" ([[Otto Pfleiderer]]).

Although Bauer did investigate the 'Ur-Marcus,' it was his remarks on the current version of the [[Gospel of Mark]] that captured popular attention. In particular, some key themes in the [[Gospel of Mark]] appeared to be literary. The [[Messianic Secret]] theme, in which Jesus continually performed wonders and then continually told the viewers not to tell anybody that he did this, seemed to Bauer to be an example of fiction.  If the [[Messianic Secret]] is a fiction, Bauer wrote, then the redactor who added that theme was probably the final redactor of our current version of the [[Gospel of Mark]].  In 1901, [[Wilhelm Wrede]] would make his lasting fame by repeating many of Bauer's ideas in his book, ''The Messianic Secret''.

Also, for some influential theologians in the [[Tübingen School]], several [[Pauline epistles]] were regarded as forgeries of the 2nd century.  Bauer radicalised that position by suggesting that '''all''' Pauline epistles were forgeries, written in the West in antagonism to the [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] of ''The Acts''.  Bauer observed a preponderance of the Greco-Roman element, over and above the Jewish element, in Christian writings, and he added a wealth of historical background to support his theory; though modern scholars such as [[E. P. Sanders]] and [[John P. Meier]] have disputed this theory and attempted to demonstrate a mainly Jewish historical background.  Other authors, such as [[Rudolf Bultmann]], tended to agree that a Greco-Roman element was dominant.

According to Bruno Bauer, the writer of [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]]'s gospel was "an Italian, at home both in Rome and Alexandria"; that of [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]]'s gospel "a Roman, nourished by the spirit of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]";  Christianity is essentially "[[Stoicism]] triumphant in a Jewish garb."

What Bruno Bauer added was a deep review of European literature in the 1st century. In his estimation, many key themes of the New Testament, especially those that are opposed to themes in the Old Testament, can be found with relative ease in Greco-Roman literature that flourished during the 1st century. Such a position was also maintained by some Jewish scholars.

Bauer's final book, ''Christ and the Caesars'' (1877) offers a penetrating analysis that shows common key-words in the words of 1st-century writers like Seneca the Stoic and New Testament texts.  While this had been perceived even in ancient times, the ancient explanation was that Seneca 'must have been' a secret Christian.  Bruno Bauer was perhaps the first to attempt to carefully demonstrate that some New Testament writers freely borrowed from Seneca the Stoic. One modern explanation is that common cultures share common thought-forms and common patterns of speech; that similarities do not necessarily indicate borrowing.

In ''Christ and the Caesars'', Bauer argued that [[Judaism]] entered Rome during the era of the [[Maccabees]], and increased in population and influence in Rome since that time. He cited literature from the 1st century to strengthen his case that Jewish influence in Rome was far greater than historians had yet reported.  The Imperial throne was influenced by the Jewish religious genius, he said, citing Herod's relation with the Caesar family, as well as the famous relationship between [[Josephus]] and the Flavians, [[Vespasian]] and [[Titus]], and also one of the poems of [[Horace]].

According to Bruno Bauer, [[Julius Caesar]] sought to interpret his own life as an Oriental miracle story, and Augustus Caesar completed that job by commissioning [[Virgil]] to write his ''Aeneid'', making Caesar into the Son of Venus and a relative of the Trojans, thereby justifying the Roman conquest of Greece and insinuating Rome into a much older history.

By contrast, said Bauer, [[Vespasian]] was far more fortunate, since he had [[Josephus]] himself to link his reign with an Oriental miracle.  Josephus had prophesied that Vespasian would become Emperor of Rome and thus ruler of the world. This actually happened, and in this way the Roman conquest of Judea was justified and insinuated Rome into an even older history.

According to [[Albert Schweitzer]], Bruno Bauer's criticisms of the New Testament provided the most interesting questions about the historical Jesus that he had seen.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Albert, The Quest of the Historical Jesus – 1906 – Adam and Charles Black, on p.159, Schweitzer explicitly states, "Bauer's 'Criticism of the Gospel History' is worth a good dozen Lives of Jesus, because his work, as we are only now coming to recognise, after half a century, is the ablest and most complete collection of the difficulties of the Life of Jesus which is anywhere to be found."&lt;/ref&gt;

Judging by the second-to-last chapter of his ''Quest,'' Schweitzer's own theology was partly based on Bauer's writings.  The title of that chapter is ''Thoroughgoing Skepticism and Eschatology.''  In that chapter Schweitzer clashes head-on with [[Wilhelm Wrede]], who had recently (in 1905) proposed the theory of a [[Messianic Secret]].  Wrede's theory claimed that Jesus' continual commands to his followers to "say nothing to anybody" after each miracle was performed could only be explained as a literary invention of this Gospel writer.  (That is,  Wrede was the thoroughgoing skeptic, and Schweitzer was the thoroughgoing eschatologist.)  Schweitzer began by showing that Wrede had merely copied this idea from Bruno Bauer.  Then Schweizter listed another forty brilliant criticisms from Bruno Bauer (pp.&amp;nbsp;334–335) some of which he disagreed with (such as the so-called [[Messianic Secret]]) and some of which he considered indispensable for any modern theology of the Gospel.

This line of criticism has value in emphasizing the importance of studying the influence of environment in the formation of the Christian Scriptures. Bauer was a man of restless creativity, interdisciplinary activity and independent judgment.  Many reviewers have charged that Bauer's judgment was ill-balanced,  Due to the controversial nature of his work as a social theorist, theologian and historian, Bauer was banned from public teaching by a Prussian monarch.  After many years of similar censorship, Bauer came to resign himself to his place as a free-lance critic, rather than as an official teacher.

[[Douglas Moggach]] published ''The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer'' in 2003. This is the most comprehensive overview of Bauer's life and works, in English to date. Bauer's biography has obtained more kindly reviews these days, even by opponents. In his own day, his opponents often respected him, since he was not afraid of taking a line on principle.

One point that is often raised in this regard is his line that was displeasing to his liberal friends on the [[Jewish question]] (''Die Judenfrage'', 1843).
Bauers later article "Jews abroad" (Das Judentum in der Fremde) in "Staats- und Gesellschaftslexicon" was even more radical and extensive, mixing arguments of racism, religion and "voelkisch" ideology.

The topic of Bauer's personal religious views or lack thereof is a continuing debate in contemporary scholarship about Bruno Bauer.  One modern writer, Paul Trejo (2002), has made the case that Bauer remained a radical theologian who criticized specific types of Christianity, and that Bauer maintained a Hegelian interpretation of Christianity throughout his life.  According to Trejo, Bauer's book, ''Christianity Exposed'' (1843), was very mild, only setting one sect of Christian against another.  Further, opined Trejo, Bauer's ''Trumpet of the Last Judgment against Hegel the Atheist and Antichrist'' was a comedy – actually a prank – in which Bauer pretended to be a right-wing cleric who was attacking Hegel.  When many right-wing readers publicly praised the book, Bauer revealed himself as the actual author and had a good laugh.

''The Trumpet'', written by Bauer and published anonymously, was of inspiration to [[Gianfranco Sanguinetti]], for his 1975 pamphlet ''Veritable Report on the Last Chances to Save Capitalism in Italy'', a [[Situationist International|Situationist]] prank which caused him to leave Italy under the force of political pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/censor-nonexistence.html Bauer citation], [http://portland.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/299604.shtml report of scandal].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antisemitism==
Beginning in 1848, critics accused Bauer of promoting a virulent antisemitism in print within reactionary circles.&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas, ''The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Bauer's view of Jews and Judaism is considered by some to have been absolutely negative, both when considering the past and when contemplating the present.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jacob, ''From Prejudice to Destruction: Anti-Semitism, 1700–1933'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1980) p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, Bauer wrote [[The Jewish Question]], which was responded to in a pamphlet written by Karl Marx, entitled, ''[[On the Jewish Question]]''. According to Marx, Bauer argued that the Jews were responsible for their own misfortunes in European society since they had "made their nest in the pores and interstices of bourgeois society".&lt;ref&gt;Poliakov, Leon, ''The History of Anti-Semitism, Volume III: From Voltaire to Wagner'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2003) p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; 
Jacob Katz contextualizes Bauer's antisemitism with his passionate anti-Christianity, the latter of which caused Bauer to lose his professorship. Although, according to Katz, Bauer was "equally impatient with Christianity and Judaism",&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jacob. ''From prejudice to destruction: anti-Semitism, 1700–1933''. page 169&lt;/ref&gt; Bauer would frequently diverge from a review or opinion piece on a Jewish writer or thinker into a general consideration of "the Jew as a type", grasping at whatever negative characteristics he could find.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jacob. ''From prejudice to destruction: anti-Semitism, 1700–1933''. page 214-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political ideology==
The first English-language rendering of Bruno Bauer's career was published in March, 2003 by Douglas Moggach, a professor at the [[University of Ottawa]].  His book is entitled, ''The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer''.  Professor Moggach develops a republican interpretation of Bruno Bauer, in which Bauer is portrayed as reaching atheist conclusions because of his political commitments to free self-consciousness and autonomy, and his criticisms of the Restoration union of church and state.  Other scholars continue to dispute that portrait.

Bauer's personality was complex.  During his career and even after he died he was difficult to classify.  The left-wing tried to define him as one of their own.  The right-wing tried to define him as one of their own.  He was praised by the right-Hegelians, and he was praised by the left-Hegelians.

Bauer had studied directly under the German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Friedrich Hegel]].  Hegel had awarded an academic prize to Bauer when Bauer was about 20 years old.  [[Hegel]] died when Bruno Bauer was 22 years old.  Perhaps this affected Bauer's personality strongly; he may have seen himself as sitting very close to the highest academic post in Prussia and possibly he imagined that he would one day have that post.

When [[Hegel]] unexpectedly died in 1831, possibly of cholera, Bruno Bauer's official connections were drastically reduced.  Bauer had very few powerful friends during the academic fallout after Hegel's death.

After the publication of his 'The Trumpet' (1841) he was considered as an important representative of the radicals.

The struggle with [[David Strauss]] and especially with the Prussian monarchy had set Bruno Bauer back quite a bit.
This also affected Bauer's personality.

Bauer went underground and began to write Hegelian newspapers here and there.  In this journey he met some socialists, including [[Karl Marx]], his former student, and Marx' new friends, [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Arnold Ruge]].  They were all left-wing radicals.  Bauer was not a left-wing radical, but he was happy to be their leader if it could lead them back to a Hegelian understanding of the dialectic.  Another member of those Young Hegelians, [[Max Stirner]], became Bauer's lifelong friend. Although Bauer was not a radical egoist, he preferred the writings of Stirner to the writings of [[Marx]], [[Engels]] and [[Arnold Ruge|Ruge]].

Shortly after, [[Marx]] and [[Engels]] broke sharply with Bruno Bauer and attacked him specifically in a critique of one of his works, "On the Jewish Question" and in other books that were critical of various Young Hegelians including Bauer, ''The Holy Family'', and ''The German Ideology''.

Bruno Bauer met with Marx again in London in the mid-1850s, while visiting his exiled brother [[Edgar Bauer|Edgar]] there. According to Marx's correspondence with Engels, Bauer presented him with a copy of Hegel's Science of Logic. Marx referred to this volume while completing his drafts of 'Capital'.

Bauer had already turned away from the socialism and communism of Marx and Engels, so he was immune to the barbs they wrote in ''The Holy Family or Critique of Critical Criticism. Against Bruno Bauer and Company'' by his pupils, Marx and Engels.  Nevertheless, he had fallen quite far – from a favorite son of Hegel himself down to an enemy of both the right-wing and the left-wing as well.  He found very few friends in this intellectual position aside from Max Stirner.  According to some sources he contemplated suicide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2010}}  According to other sources, his enemies only wished that he contemplated suicide.

Suppressed and condemned by both the right-wing and the left-wing, the once-influential Bruno Bauer finally settled into his family's tobacco shop to earn his living, though he continued to write.  He never married, but he wrote books for the rest of his life.

== Revival ==
Bauer's scholarship was buried by German academia, and he remained a pariah, until [[Albert Kalthoff]] rescued his works from neglect and obscurity. Kalthoff revived Bauer's Christ Myth thesis in his ''Das Christus-Problem. Grundlinien zu einer Sozialtheologie'' (''The Problem of Christ: Principles of a Social Theology'', 1902) and ''Die Entstehung des Christentums, Neue Beiträge zum Christusproblem'' (''The Rise of Christianity'', 1904).
[[Albert Schweitzer]] a historian of theology, who presented an important critical review of the history of the search for Jesus's life in ''Geschichte der Leben-Jesu-Forschung'' (''[[The Quest of the Historical Jesus]], 1906''), highly praised Bauer's early work.&lt;ref name="Schweitzer.Quest"&gt;{{cite book|last=SCHWEITZER|first=ALBERT|authorlink=Albert Schweitzer|title=THE QUEST OF THE HISTORICAL JESUS A CRITICAL STUDY OF ITS PROGRESS FROM REIMARUS TO WREDE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UPLuZZ8NHIC&amp;pg=PA159|year=1910|page=159|quote=[Bauer] had long been regarded by theologians as an extinct force; nay, more, had been forgotten. [...] It was, indeed, nothing less than a misfortune that Strauss and Bauer appeared within so short a time of one another. Bauer passed practically unnoticed, because every one was preoccupied with Strauss. Another unfortunate thing was that Bauer overthrew with his powerful criticism the hypothesis which attributed real historical value to Mark, so that it lay for a long time disregarded, and there ensued a barren period of twenty years in the critical study of the Life of Jesus. [...] Bauer's "Criticism of the Gospel History" is worth a good dozen Lives of Jesus, because his work, as we are only now coming to recognise, after half a century, is the ablest and most complete collection of the difficulties of the Life of Jesus which is anywhere to be found.

[[Arthur Drews]] noted Bauer's views in his own work ''[[The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present]]'', "Christianity is the product of the intimidated class of Romans who needed a straw of hope and faith in their struggle against the egoism of Caesars.  It's absurd to suppose it to be originating from Hierosolyma [Jerusalem].  The origin of the Gospel literature is then reexamined.  Originally, it's just a demonstration of the new principle of freedom, in rebellion against the law-dominated world, represented by Judaism.  The Gospels demonstrate various steps in the evolution of this esteem. The main factor of influence was of the Roman empire, whose oppression forced the community to look for hope in a kingdom of heavens and exterminating the kingdom of Rome to make it possible. ...Absolutely no such thing as a historical Jesus of Galilee is needed to explain the genesis of Mark's gospel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drews|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur Drews|title=Die Leugnung der Geschichtlichkeit Jesu in Vergangenheit und Gegenwart.

Price]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;Reading the prescient Bruno Bauer one has the eerie feeling that a century of New Testament scholarship may find itself ending up where it began. For instance, the work of [[Burton Mack]], [[Vernon Robbins]], and others makes a powerful case for understanding the gospels as [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]]-[[Stoicism|Stoic]] in tone.... Robert M. Fowler, [[Frank Kermode]], and [[Randel Helms]] have demonstrated how thoroughly the gospels smack of fictional composition. Thus, from many directions, New Testament researchers seem to be converging uncannily on the theses that Bruno Bauer set forth over a century ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Price|first1=Robert|title=Bruno Bauer, Christ and the Caesars, reviewed by Robert M.

== Argument against the existence of Jesus ==

Bauer became the first author to systematically argue that Jesus did not exist.&lt;ref name=voorst711&gt;[[Robert E. Van Voorst]] ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'' Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} pages 7-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BeilbyEddy2009"&gt;Beilby, James K. and Eddy, Paul Rhodes.

However, he left open the question of whether a historical Jesus existed at all until his 1851 work, ''Criticism of the Gospels and History of their Origin'' and then in 1877 proposed his theory for the true origin of Jesus in ''Christ and the Caesars''.

Bauer's 1842 work, ''Kritik der evangelischen Geschichte der Synoptiker und des Johannes'' (3 vol) argued that the gospels were purely literary, with no historically authentic material. While not yet rejecting the historicity of Jesus, Bauer denied the historicity of a [[supernatural]] Christ (viz. Jesus—a natural human).&lt;ref name="Schweitzer.Quest" /&gt; Bauer wrote, "Everything that the historical Christ is, everything that is said of Him, everything that is known of Him, belongs to the world of imagination, that is, of the imagination of the Christian community, and therefore has nothing to do with any man who belongs to the real world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bauer|first=Bruno|authorlink=Bruno Bauer|title=Kritik der evangelischen Geschichte der Synoptiker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Ac3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA308|volume=3|year=1842|publisher=O.

In his ''Criticism of the Pauline Epistles'' (1850–1852) and in ''A Critique of the Gospels and a History of their Origin'' (1850–1851), Bauer argued that Jesus had not existed.&lt;ref name=Schweitzer128&gt;Schweitzer, Albert. ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus''. Fortress, 2001; first published 1913, pp. 124–128, 139–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Schweitzer notes, "At the end of his study of the Gospels, Bauer is inclined to make the decision of the question whether there ever was a historic Jesus depend on the result of a further investigation which he proposed to make into the Pauline Epistles. It was not until ten years later (1850–1851) that he accomplished this task, (''Kritik der Paidinischen Briefe''. (Criticism of the Pauline Epistles.) Berlin, 1850-1852.) and applied the result in his new edition of the "Criticism of the Gospel History." (''Kritik der Evangelien und Geschichte ihres Ursprungs.'' (Criticism of the Gospels and History of their Origin.) 2 vols., Berlin, 1850-1851.) The result is negative: there never was any historical Jesus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=SCHWEITZER|first=ALBERT|title=THE QUEST OF THE HISTORICAL JESUS A CRITICAL STUDY OF ITS PROGRESS FROM REIMARUS TO WREDE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UPLuZZ8NHIC&amp;pg=PA157|year=1910|page=157|chapter=Bruno Bauer|quote=Image of [https://books.google.com/books?id=7UPLuZZ8NHIC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U2v_K4aUq8poJTD2ra6kme2pVKUag&amp;ci=93%2C753%2C820%2C725&amp;edge=0 p.&amp;nbsp;157] at Google Books.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Christ and the Caesars'' (1877) he suggested that Christianity was a synthesis of the [[Stoicism]] of [[Seneca the Younger]] and of the Jewish theology of [[Philo]] as developed by pro-Roman Jews such as [[Josephus]].&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mEQd5VP1lBIC&amp;pg=PA184 ''The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer'']. Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 184. *Also see Engels, Frederick. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1882/05/bauer.htm "Bruno Bauer and Early Christianity"], ''Der Sozialdemokrat'', May 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; Bauer's work was heavily criticized at the time; in 1839 he was removed from his position at the University of Bonn, and his work did not have much impact on future myth theorists.&lt;ref name=voorst711/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBen204&gt;''In Search of Jesus: Insider and Outsider Images'' by [[Clinton Bennett]] (Dec 1, 2001) {{ISBN|0826449166}} Continuum page 204&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christ myth theory]] proponents still assert the threefold argument originally asserted by Bauer:
* that the New Testament has no historical value.
* that there are no non-Christian references to Jesus Christ dating back to the first century.
* that Christianity had pagan or mythical roots.&lt;ref name="Voorst2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Voorst|first=Robert Van|authorlink=Robert E. Van Voorst|title=Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lwzliMSRGGkC&amp;pg=PA9|year=2000|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-4368-5|page=9|quote=Bauer laid down the typical threefold argument that almost all subsequent deniers of the existence of Jesus were to follow (although not in direct dependence upon him). First, he denied the value of the New Testament, especially the Gospels and Paul’s letters, in establishing the existence of Jesus. Second, he argued that the lack of mention of Jesus in non-Christian writings of the first century shows that Jesus did not exist. Neither do the few mentions of Jesus by Roman writers in the early second century establish his existence. Third, he promoted the view that Christianity was syncretistic and mythical at its beginnings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Translations ===
The great bulk of Bauer's writings have still not been translated into English. Only two books by Bauer have been formally translated; a comedic parody, ''The Trumpet of the Last Judgment Against Hegel the Atheist and Antichrist'' (1841, trans. Lawrence Stepelevich, 1989),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/censor-nonexistence.html Quote] from Sanguinetti '75: In 1841, under the pretext of denouncing [[Hegel]] for his atheism, [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and Bauer wrote and published an anonymous pamphlet [''The Trumpet''..] in fact directed against the right-wing Hegelians, but which, in its style and tone, seemed to have been written by a right-wing metaphysician. This pamphlet in reality showed all of the menacing revolutionary traits that the Hegelian dialectic had in that epoch, and was thus the first document to establish the death of metaphysics and, consequently, the "destruction of all of the laws of the State."&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Christianity Exposed: A Recollection of the 18th Century and a Contribution to the Crisis of the 19th'' (1843, ed. Paul Trejo, 2002).  A third book, Bauer's great, ''Christ and the Caesars'' (1877, Charleston House Publishing, 1999) was published informally, perhaps as a software-generated translation under a pseudonym, "Frank E. Schacht."

The '''Captain &amp; Tennille''' were American recording artists whose primary success occurred in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=USA&gt;{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/captain-tennille-mn0000940831/biography |title=Captain &amp; Tennille &amp;#124; Biography |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/captain-tennille-mn0000940831/awards |title=Captain &amp; Tennille &amp;#124; Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The husband-and-wife duo were "Captain" [[Daryl Dragon]] (born August 27, 1942) and [[Toni Tennille|Cathryn Antoinette "Toni" Tennille]] (born May 8, 1940). They have five albums certified gold or platinum and scored numerous hits on the US singles charts, the most enduring of which included "[[Love Will Keep Us Together]]", "[[Do That to Me One More Time]]", and "[[Muskrat Love]]". They  hosted their own television variety series on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1976–77.

==Early history and collaboration==
In 1972, [[Toni Tennille]] was the co-writer of an ecology-themed musical, ''Mother Earth''. At that time, [[Daryl Dragon]] (son of composer [[Carmen Dragon]]) was working as a keyboardist for [[the Beach Boys]]. When Tennille's show was preparing to move from [[San Francisco]]'s [[Marines Memorial Theatre]] to [[Southern California]]'s [[South Coast Repertory]], a call was put out for a replacement keyboardist. Dragon was between tours when he heard about the opening, met Tennille in San Francisco to audition, and landed the gig.

Dragon later reciprocated by recommending Tennille to the Beach Boys when the band needed an additional keyboardist, and they hired her. She toured with them for a year, and has since been known as The Beach Boys' one and only "Beach Girl".&lt;ref&gt;Fuqua 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing their collaborative potential when the tour was over, Tennille and Dragon began performing as a duo at the now-defunct Smokehouse Restaurant in [[Encino, California]]. They started to become popular in the [[Los Angeles]] area, and their early version of the Tennille-penned "The Way I Want to Touch You" became popular on a local radio station. This led to a recording contract with [[A&amp;M Records]].&lt;ref name=Fuqua132&gt;Fuqua 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first hit single, a rendition of [[Neil Sedaka]]'s and [[Howard Greenfield]]'s "[[Love Will Keep Us Together]]", reached #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart nine weeks after its 1975 debut, and went on to win the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Record of the Year]]. It sold over 1 million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on July 1, 1975.&lt;ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"&gt;{{cite book

The duo successfully mined the Sedaka songbook a number of times over their chartmaking career. Two of their other hit singles were the Sedaka co-writes "[[Lonely Night (Angel Face)]]" and "[[You Never Done It Like That]]".&lt;ref name=Bronson408&gt;Bronson 408&lt;/ref&gt; Their Spanish recording of "[[Love Will Keep Us Together]]", "[[Por Amor Viviremos]]", also charted in 1975; it was the first time two versions of the same single charted simultaneously. Tennille and Dragon included renditions of several other Sedaka songs on their albums.

Tennille and Dragon married on November 11, 1975 (not on Valentine's Day 1974, as is often erroneously reported, for example, on the February 14, 1976 edition of [[Casey Kasem]]'s [[American Top 40]]).&lt;ref name=USA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://captainandtennille.net/tonis-take_blog_06.htm |title=TONI'S TAKE - BLOG PAGES .

==Success and subsequent period==
[[File:Toni Tennille (1976-07-07)(Gerald Ford Library) (cropped).jpg|200px|thumb|left|Tennille performing at the White House, 1976]]
Over the next few years, Captain and Tennille released a string of hit singles mostly from their first two albums ''Love Will Keep Us Together'' (US #2, 1975) and ''Song Of Joy'' (US #9, 1976) including "[[The Way I Want to Touch You]]" (US #4), "[[Lonely Night (Angel Face)]]" (US #3), "[[Shop Around]]" (US #4), and "[[Muskrat Love]]" (US #4).

In July 1976, they were invited by First Lady [[Betty Ford]] to perform in the East Room of the [[White House]] in the presence of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and President [[Gerald Ford]] during the country's bicentennial celebration. After a long journey, the Queen fell asleep during their show.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Such was the level of their popularity that they were given their own television variety show. ''The Captain and Tennille'' TV show aired from September 1976 to March 1977 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. It featured musical numbers and comedy sketches performed with various guest stars. However, despite solid ratings success, the duo wanted to focus on their music and touring career and, after one season, asked to be released from their contract.

The duo's third album ''Come in from the Rain'' (US #18, 1977) produced three singles: "Can't Stop Dancing" (US #13), the title track (US #61), and "Circles", which did not chart. A&amp;M Records later released a Greatest Hits album (1977) which peaked at #55 on the US Top 200.

The duo released their fourth studio album ''Dream'' (US #131, 1978), although their first single "I'm on My Way" (US #74) failed to become a hit. However, their second single, and third Sedaka title, "You Never Done It Like That," fared much better at #10. A third single was "You Need a Woman Tonight" (US #40). ''Dream'' would be the last Captain and Tennille studio album released by A&amp;M.

In 1979, [[Neil Bogart]] signed them to a contract on his [[Casablanca Records]] label. The album ''Make Your Move'' (US #23, 1979) rose much higher on the chart than the act's previous release, and the first single "[[Do That to Me One More Time]]" reached the summit on February 16, 1980, becoming their second #1 single. However, subsequent singles "Love on a Shoestring" (US #55) and "Happy Together (A Fantasy)" (US #53) only achieved minimal success.

''Keeping Our Love Warm'' (1980) was the duo's second Casablanca release, and sixth studio album overall, but failed to crack the Top 200. The first single from this album, the title track, was performed live (although lip synced) during the 1980 [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]].

During the duo's period of highest popularity, Tennille also worked as a [[session musician|session singer]] (most frequently partnered with The Beach Boys' [[Bruce Johnston]]), performing as a [[backing vocalist]] on the [[Elton John]] albums ''[[Caribou (album)|Caribou]]'', ''[[Blue Moves]]'', and ''[[21 at 33]]'' (some vocally arranged by Dragon) and most notably on the hit track "[[Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me]]". She also appeared as a backing vocalist on tracks by [[Art Garfunkel]] and The Beach Boys, as well as [[Pink Floyd]] for whom she performed backing tracks on ''[[The Wall]]'' album.

In the liner notes of the Captain &amp; Tennille anthology ''Ultimate Collection: The Complete Greatest Hits'', Tennille explains how her work on Pink Floyd's album gained her at least one new fan:

{{quote|I went to see the Pink Floyd concert at the Sports Arena in [[Los Angeles]].  There was a 15-year-old boy sitting in front of me who recognized me. He turned around and snottily said, 'What are YOU doing here?' So I told him I sang on the album. He ran off to find a friend who had brought the LP to the show, and looked at the back to see if my name was really on there. A few minutes later, he came back and apologetically said, 'Can I have your autograph?'

Toni Tennille hosted her own syndicated television talk show from September 1980 to January 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Toni Tennille Show|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1446646/|website=IMDb|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Toni Tennille Show - Episode Guide - TV.com|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-toni-tennille-show/episodes/|accessdate=20 February 2017|quote= The Toni Tenille Show (ended 1981). Air date: September 15 1980 (Episode 1) - January 15 1981 (Episode 73).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990s-present==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
Throughout the 1990s, they continued to perform various concert dates at venues around the world, frequently at [[Harrah's Lake Tahoe]] and [[Harrah's Reno]], which were located close to their home near [[Carson City, Nevada]]. One of their more notable appearances in that decade occurred when they played at the House of Blues on the [[Sunset Strip]] in Los Angeles in 1995, as part of their 20th anniversary as an act.

At the same time throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Tennille enjoyed a second career as a [[big band]] and [[pop standard]] singer, not unlike pop colleague [[Linda Ronstadt]]. She performed with orchestras throughout the country and subsequently recorded several solo albums including Mirage Records' ''More Than You Know'' (1984), and ''All of Me'' on Gaia Records in 1987.

In 1999, on [[Cartoon Network]], the duo made a guest appearance, interviewed by [[Harvey Birdman]], rather than [[Space Ghost]] (who is sent to jail and breaks out) in an episode of ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]''.

In 2001, on the popular television series, [[Friends (sitcom)|Friends]], the duo was referenced in "The One With Joey's Award."

Toni Tennille also enjoyed a year as the star of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] tour of ''[[Victor/Victoria (musical)|Victor/Victoria]]''. At the end of that project, she and Dragon were to have embarked on a 25th anniversary tour; however, the stresses of the road proved too demanding and Captain &amp; Tennille instead put an indefinite hold on their career as a performing duo. Nevertheless, Captain &amp; Tennille's popularity remained evident in the release of their ''Ultimate Collection: The Complete Hits'' on [[Hip-O Records]] (a subsidiary of [[Universal Records]]) in 2001, and ''More Than Dancing... Much More'', a 2002 compact disc. The latter contains what was originally their final album in 1982, ''More Than Dancing'', which at that time was released only in [[Australia]], and is combined with selected tracks from their 1995 ''20 Years of Romance'', originally on [[K-Tel]] (re-recording of their songs, and cover versions of others), as well as five newly released tracks.

In November 2003, Tennille performed a [[benefit concert]] for the [[Reno, Nevada]] [[Chamber Orchestra]], where her surprise guest was Dragon. It was the first time they had publicly performed as Captain &amp; Tennille in many years. Their first live recording, ''An Intimate Evening with Toni Tennille'', was released to commemorate the event.

In 2005, Brant Berry, the vice president of a small [[Portland, Oregon]]–based entertainment company, Respond 2 Entertainment (R2), signed an agreement with Captain &amp; Tennille to release three projects. The first was the home video release of Captain &amp; Tennille's 1976 variety series, on a three-disc [[DVD]] set containing 11 complete episodes with bonus musical tracks. Second, R2 re-released all six of their albums, both from the original A&amp;M and Casablanca labels, on newly remastered CDs. Several of the CDs were previously available only in [[Japan]]. The new CDs, packaged both as individual CDs and in a [[box set]], contained new liner notes written by Tennille.

Third, a new recording by Captain &amp; Tennille was released—a three-song Christmas CD entitled ''Saving Up Christmas''. This effort was followed by ''The Secret of Christmas'' released on Captain &amp; Tennille's own label, Purebred Records, on November 1, 2006. It was Captain &amp; Tennille's first complete original album produced in more than a decade, and their first-ever Christmas album.

Tennille returned to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] airwaves and to club play when the band [[Bent (band)|Bent]] sampled a small portion of her vocals from Captain &amp; Tennille's 1979 track, "Love on a Shoestring" (from the album ''Make Your Move''), into their "Magic Love" single in 2003. An [[Ashley Beedle]] [[remix]] of the single heightened the danceability of the original [[ambient music|ambient]] track.

In October 2006, [[Cartoon Network]]'s animated special ''[[Casper's Scare School]]'' was aired. The duo recorded two songs for the [[film]], and voiced the dialog for the characters who sang the songs. Tennille portrayed Aunt Belle and the Captain was Uncle Murray, who together formed a two-head-on-one-body being known as the Ankle. The two songs they performed, "Why Does Love Make Me Feel So Good" and "World Without Fear," were written by [[Magnus Fiennes]]. Captain &amp; Tennille's co-stars on the show included [[Phyllis Diller]], [[James Belushi]], [[Dan Castellaneta]], and [[Bob Saget]].

In 2007, three new DVDs were released of Captain &amp; Tennille's ABC TV specials: ''Captain &amp; Tennille in Hawaii'', ''Captain &amp; Tennille in New Orleans'', and ''Captain &amp; Tennille Songbook''.

Dragon and Tennille spent most of the 1990s and 2000s living in the [[Carson City]] area of [[Nevada]], where they had lived for more than fifteen years, and where Tennille served as Ambassador for the Arts for the state. In the mid-2000s, they temporarily took year-round residence at their second home, located in the [[Palm Springs]] area of [[Southern California]]. In 2008 they sold their home near Carson City, and built a house and settled down in [[Prescott, Arizona]], where Tennille participates in the annual Prescott Jazz Summit.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Divorce===
Tennille filed for divorce from Dragon in the State of Arizona on January 16, 2014, after 39 years of marriage. Dragon was unaware of the termination of his marriage until he was served with the divorce papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tmz.com/2014/01/22/captain-and-tennille-divorce/ | title = Captain &amp; Tennille Divorce -- Love WON'T Keep Us Together | publisher= [[TMZ.com]] | date = January 22, 2014|accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The divorce documents referenced health insurance or health issues, and Tennille had written on her blog in 2010 that Dragon's neurological condition, similar to Parkinson’s, known as [[essential tremor]], was characterized by such extreme tremors he could no longer play keyboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/01/23/captain-and-tennille-musical-duo-of-the-70s-divorcing-after-39-years-of-marriage/|title= Captain and Tennille, musical duo of the ’70s, divorcing after 39 years of marriage|work= [[The Washington Post]] | first= Diana | last= Reese |date=January 23, 2014|accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tennille|first1=Toni|title=Parker &amp; Parker: April 19, 2011|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSy6dbBXu8|website=YouTube.com|accessdate=8 May 2016|date=19 April 2011|quote=Daryl has a condition called Essential tremor, which has really wrecked his keyboard playing...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dragon later stated that some of his health problems were the result of errors in dosing his medication, a problem which has since been fixed; he and Tennille remain on speaking terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/music/celebrity/daryl-dragon-of-captain-and-tennille-clears-up-rumors-about-his-health-‘i-am-not-under-hospice-care’/ar-AAmPIB3?li=BBnb7Kz|title=Daryl Dragon of Captain and Tennille Clears Up Rumors About His Health: ‘I Am Not Under Hospice Care’|work=People magazine|date=February 12, 2017|first=Alex|last=Fernandez|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21370">Though the [[United States]] was in combat for only a matter of months, the reorganization of society had a great effect on American life.  During [[World War I]], daily life was affected as men were drafted and sent abroad, and women had to fill their places in the factories. Youth programs grew and developed in a response to aid the government with these new programs. During and after the war, life for children in the United States was greatly affected in a variety of ways.

More than 116,000 members of the [[U.S. military]] died in the war, far fewer than combatants from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Niall Ferguson|title=The Pity of War: Explaining World War I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=McfJaJ25lscC|year=1999|publisher=Basic Books|page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No one has estimated how many orphans resulted.&lt;ref name=Greenwald4&gt;Greenwald, ''Women, War, and Work'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, as the male workforce left for battle, mothers and sisters began working in factories to take their positions, and the family dynamic began to change; this affected children as they had less time to spend with family members and were expected to grow up faster and help with the war effort.&lt;ref name="Greenwald4"/&gt; Similarly, [[Woodrow Wilson]] called on children involved in youth organizations to help collect money for war bonds and stamps in order to raise money for the war effort.&lt;ref name="McDermott, T pg. 70"&gt;McDermott, T. P "USA's Boy Scouts and World War I Liberty Loan Bonds", pg. 70&lt;/ref&gt; This was a way to mobilize public opinion and shame adults who did not donate. The [[Office of War Information]] and other agencies implemented programs and created posters and pamphlets to encourage war support.&lt;ref name="Spring20"/&gt;

==Background of World War I==
{{main|United States home front during World War I}}
The United States was involved in World War I for the last 19 months of the war (April 1917 to November 1918), 4,355,000 men were conscripted into service. By summer 1918, they were trained and shipped to France at the rate of 10,000 military personnel a day.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Chambers, II, ''To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, every farm, town and city, and every economic sector, was mobilized for the war effort. Tens of millions of parents took war jobs or joined voluntary organizations such as the Red Cross. This involvement changed the course of the war and directly affected daily life, education, and family structures of children in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Eyewitness'', 62&lt;/ref&gt;  The home front saw a systematic mobilization of the entire population and the entire economy to produce the soldiers, food supplies, munitions, and money needed to win the war. Although the United States entered the war in 1917, there had been very little planning, or even recognition of the problems that the British and other Allies had to solve on their homefronts. As a result, the level of confusion was high in the first 12 months, then efficiency took control.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Kennedy, ''Over Here: The First World War and American Society'' (2004), is the standard scholarly history&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on daily life==
After the United States entered the war, daily life was affected for most as men prepared for battle, women began working, and children and families had less time to spend together. The women and children did much more work than they used to. Children were affected as many of their fathers were killed or maimed in battle, and their mothers began working long hours in the factories.  As the war progressed, technology advanced and industry boomed, enabling women to spend less time on household chores and more time outside of the home.&lt;ref name="Doswell131"&gt;Dowswell, True Stories, 131&lt;/ref&gt;  The American family began to change as women started working more regularly, which affected the role of the child in American life.&lt;ref name=Greenwald4/&gt;

===Home life===
[[Image:Howard Chandler Christy WWI poster 04.jpg|left|thumb|alt=World War I US poster calling girls to help out.| Girls too young for paid jobs learned how they could help the war effort.]]
Over 21 million people were killed or injured in World War I; in many cases, all of the men in one family were killed, numerous cities in Europe were destroyed, and family life throughout the world was greatly affected.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Eyewitness'', 30&lt;/ref&gt;  While the United States suffered the fewest casualties, family life was still greatly affected as husbands were deployed and wives had to begin working.  As the war draft suddenly removed many men from factory work, the factories began soliciting for women workers in traditionally male-dominated areas.&lt;ref name="Greenwald4"/&gt;  Therefore, women had less time to spend at home with the children, as many of them would have before the war. As fathers, uncles, brothers, and grandfathers deployed in military service, women filled their places in factories and offices, changing the ways young children and teens received home nurturing.  Additionally, women moving into new roles in society had lasting effects on children and family life after the war.  President [[Woodrow Wilson]] stated, "We have made partners of the women in this war; shall we admit them only to a partnership of suffering and sacrifice and toil and not to a partnership of privilege and right?"&lt;ref&gt;"Wilson Makes Suffrage Appeal, But Senate Waits" ''The New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;  As women began working in the factories, more of society began to realize the need for women's rights; while women had been granted [[suffrage]] (voting rights) to varying degrees in several states beginning in the late 19th century, they were now guaranteed full suffrage throughout the United States by the [[19th Amendment to the United States Constitution]] passed in August, 1920.  This also paved the way for the children of future generations by creating greater career opportunities for girls and women; as women gained a stronger voice, girls became more involved in the workforce and education and prepared for roles outside of the home.  Additionally, family life was affected after the war as more and more women entered the work force, moving away from the traditional stay-at-home mother and housewife role.&lt;ref name=Greenwald4/&gt;

Over the course of the war, the United States mobilized hundreds of thousands of men and endured an estimated 117,465 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;"American Merchant Marine at War, www.usmm.org"&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the men who survived and returned home, [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] created a major impact on society.  During this time, and still today, post-traumatic stress (then more likely to be known as "shell shock") was not fully understood, but because of the traumatic nature of battle, many men were negatively affected after the war.  Some men were forced to leave battle, which many people considered cowardice,  and there were asylums throughout Europe housing men suffering from this condition.  In some extreme cases, men were even shot for showing weakness.&lt;ref name="Doswell131"/&gt; There are still people living today who lost family members because of this practice, which created lasting impacts on these children.  Additionally, many of these men were teenagers when they left for war, and virtually all were under the age of 30; therefore many of these soldiers were barely out of childhood themselves.&lt;ref name="Dowswell132"&gt;Dowswell, ''True Stories'', 132&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:americansailor.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Young American in the Navy.|This is a young American man enlisted in the [[U.S. Navy]] during World War I.]]

Furthermore, because over a million young men were deployed overseas, marriage had to be postponed. In addition, a large number of the military personnel who returned home suffered from serious permanent injuries.

===Technology===
On the home front, domestic appliances were being created, alleviating the amount of time that women needed to spend on chores, so they had more time to work outside of the home.  Additionally, this lessened the need for female [[servants]], as things like laundry services and food preparation services became popular.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, ''Women, War, and Work'', 11&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, women were able to move into more traditionally male-dominated areas, as technology began to do the service jobs that women primarily were responsible for.  Additionally, this showed young girls that they could eventually work outside of the home and more opportunities were available to them after they completed their education.

==Impact on Education==
World War I altered education in the United States through curriculum changes with government pamphlets and required patriotism sessions.  Even though the United States was only involved in World War I for a short period of time, the government instituted many programs for and changes to American [[education]].  During this war period, there was a strong focus on [[nationalism]] and [[patriotism]], which significantly affected education.  Woodrow Wilson and the United States government funded a series of pamphlets, posters, bulletins, and speeches, which promoted strong nationalism and anti-German sentiments.&lt;ref name="Spring20"&gt;Spring, ''Images of American Life'', 20&lt;/ref&gt;  These forms of nationalist [[propaganda]] were used nationwide in  [[public school district]]s and influenced students to remain loyal to the United States. These programs promoted things like volunteering with federal organizations such as the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) and buying [[War Bonds]] to support the government.&lt;ref name="Spring25"&gt;Spring, ''Images of American Life'', 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the government created several programs to help support education such as the [[Committee of Public Information]] (CPI), the [[National Education Association]] (NEA), and the [[Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education]], all of which promoted nationalist movements and changes to education.  For example, as part of the CPI and NEA programs, with the assistance of Woodrow Wilson, pamphlets were published advocating democracy and national patriotism in schools.&lt;ref name="Spring20"/&gt;  These pamphlets also focused on a new movement of social efficacy, which strongly favored students growing as people and becoming involved, patriotic citizens.&lt;ref name="Spring20"/&gt;  Another main goal of these educational programs was a move away from state education systems and toward a nationalized system of education, which would keep curriculums similar and promote a unified nation among students.&lt;ref&gt;Spring, ''Images of American Life'', 21&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the national government changed textbooks to portray the [[American Revolution]] in a way that didn't make Britain look like the bad guys. This was important because the United States allied with [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Spring, ''Images of American Life'', 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting as early as the [[Primary education|elementary]] level, patriotic and pro-war lessons were instituted in public schools.  They included things such as weekly fifteen-minute periods on patriotism for first and second grades.  They stressed that teachers instruct the children so that they viewed the war in a positive manner and portrayed war in terms of celebrations, and victories, not destructive realities.  An elementary pamphlet stated, "In teaching the war to young pupils, the appeal should be directed primarily to the imagination and to the emotions.  It is not enough that our pupils shall be informed of the events of the war...Their imaginations must be awakened and their feelings aroused to an appreciation of the significance of the great happenings of the times."&lt;ref name="Spring25"/&gt; Therefore, starting at a very early level, students were taught that the war was a good thing and the importance of patriotism.

The patriotic sentiments were also carried out in [[Secondary education|secondary]] settings.  Specific programs and in-school curricula targeted the patriotic development of children, especially teens. New history curricula introduced rewrote the story of the American past to de-emphasize the friction between the colonies and Britain, and to deconstruct historical American and German amity, to vilify the Germans.&lt;ref name="Spring24_25"&gt;Spring, ''Images of American Life'', 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, every [[Senior (education)|senior]] in high school received their own pamphlet in January 1918 called "Study of the Great War." This attempted to encourage enmity for Germany and emphasized the importance of an Allied victory.&lt;ref name="Spring24_25"/&gt;  Things like the importance of the ROTC program were also stressed during this time.  Nationalist posters and other forms of propaganda were placed in public areas throughout the country and again showed the importance of patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;Spring, ''Images of American Life'', 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;  Posters, like the Boy Scout poster shown below, depicted teenagers helping the war effort as being courageous and admired.  This form of propaganda was especially influential on teenagers because most of them were trying to figure out their roles in society and desired to fit in; therefore, posters showing their peers serving their country and receiving recognition and respect, were particularly influential in persuading teenagers to join the war effort in whatever way they could.&lt;ref&gt;Snowman, McCown, and Biehler, pg. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war===
After the war ended, nationalist movements changed to a larger focus on international peace.  There were strong government movements toward peace and anti-war sentiments and the need to avoid further wars.&lt;ref&gt;Wit, ''Internationalization of Higher Education'', 10&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, there was a focus on internationalization of higher education.  For example, in 1920, the [[Belgian American Educational Foundation]] instituted a program with over 700 students, in which American students went to study in Belgium and vice versa in order to promote international understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Wit, ''Internationalization of Higher Education'', 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth organizations==

As a result of World War I, youth organizations such as the Boy Scouts and Camp Fire Girls greatly expanded, helping to raise money for the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, T. P "America's Boy Scouts and World War I Liberty Loan Bonds", pg. 70–72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boy Scouts===
Due to the large nationalist movement during World War I, many youth organizations were developed or expanded, including the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. During World War I, Woodrow Wilson placed a great importance on the Boy Scouts of America, asking them to encourage war support and educate the public sources about the importance of the war. They helped distribute the war pamphlets, helped sell war bonds and helped to drive nationalism and support for the war. Additionally, they were involved in many acts that helped the national government, such as locating black walnut to use in war materials and peach pits for [[gas masks]].&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, T.P.  "America's Boy Scouts and World War I Liberty Loan Bonds"&lt;/ref&gt; The Boy Scouts were involved in five Liberty Bond drives in which they helped sell Liberty Bonds to benefit the American Government.&lt;ref name="McDermott, T pg. 70"/&gt;  During the first campaign, they raised a total of $23,000,000 and in the second drive they collected $.&lt;ref name="McDermott, T pg. 70"/&gt;  For the third campaign, known as the "Wake Up, America" rally, beginning on April 27, 1918, 400,000 Boy Scouts embarked on a door to window program selling Liberty Bonds as well as war stamps.&lt;ref name="McDermott, T pg. 70"/&gt;  At the end of the five campaigns, the Boy Scouts raised $354,859,262 in bond subscriptions and $43,043,698 in war stamps.&lt;ref name="McDermott, T pg. 72"&gt;McDermott, T. P "America's Boy Scouts and World War I Liberty Loan Bonds", pg. 72&lt;/ref&gt;  When a Boy Scout sold a bond or stamp, he would record the sale and send in a post card to his local post office, which would then forward it to the bonds and stamps, he would receive an "Ace Medal".&lt;ref name="McDermott, T pg. 71"&gt;McDermott, T. P "America's Boy Scouts and World War I Liberty Loan Bonds", pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Camp Fire Girl===
During World War I [[Camp Fire Girls]] helped to sell over one million dollars in [[Liberty Bonds]] and over $900,000 in [[Thrift Stamps]]; 55,000 girls helped to support French and Belgian orphans, and an estimated 68,000 girls earned honors by conservation of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The New International Year Book |publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company |year=1920 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G6YYAAAAIAAJ |accessdate=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the conclusion of World War I, the United States and the rest of the world changed.  Those who were children during World War I grew up to become the adults of World War II.  These children were exposed to propaganda and indoctrinated to value strong nationalism and loyalty to the United States and its allies.  Therefore, when World War II was on the forefront, many of the adults in the United States still harbored negative feelings toward the Germans because of their schooling during World War I.&lt;ref name="Spring24_25"/&gt;

Additionally, women were granted [[suffrage]] shortly after World War I.  This was partly due to the fact that they had moved away from their traditional roles and filled the factory jobs that the men were forced to leave in order to serve in World War I.&lt;ref name="Doswell131"/&gt;  Women showed their importance in society, which fueled many women's rights movements post–World War I.  The girls who were in school during World War I were also learning about the importance of nationalism, and saw their mothers fulfilling traditionally male-dominated roles.  This desire for nationalism and exposure to wider opportunities helped to enable these girls to grow up and become involved in securing rights for themselves.

'''Ephraim Wales Bull''' (March 4, 1806 – September 26, 1895) was an [[United States|American]] [[farmer]], best known for the creation of the [[Concord (grape)|Concord grape]].

==Biography==
Ephraim Wales Bull was born on March 4, 1806, in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Bull was an apprentice for a [[goldbeater]] at a young age, and on September 10, 1826, he married Mary Ellen Walker of [[Dorchester, Massachusetts]]. Complaining of lung problems, Bull moved to [[Concord, Massachusetts]], in 1836, settling with his wife on a farm next door to [[Amos Bronson Alcott]].

[[Image:Ephraim-bull-039.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Epitaph of Ephraim Bull. [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Concord]], Massachusetts. ]]

In 1843, Bull began the deliberate process of breeding a [[grape]] that could thrive in the cold [[New England]] climate. By 1849, having planted 22,000 [[seedlings]], he had created a large, sweet variety from a [[Vitis labrusca|native species]], which he called [[Concord grapes|'Concord']], and by 1853 the grapes were for sale. However, within several years, competing growers had begun raising their own crops of Concord grapes, purchased from Bull for $5 per vine, and Bull saw little profit from the strain after the initial sales.

Ephraim Bull was later elected to the [[Massachusetts]] [[Massachusetts House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 1855. In 1893, after a fall, Bull went to live in the Concord Home for the Aged, and died on September 26, 1895. Bull was buried in the [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Concord|Sleepy Hollow Cemetery]] in Concord, with an [[epitaph]] reading, "He Sowed Others Reaped."

'''Feng Zhenghu''' (born 1 July 1954) is a Chinese economist and scholar based in Shanghai. Citing [[Amnesty International]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that Feng was "a prominent [[human rights defender]]" in China. In 2001 he was sent to prison for three years ostensibly for "illegal business activity". He was released in 2004 and has since written critical pieces highlighting alleged malpractice by local governments and [[Forced eviction (China)|forced evictions]].&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

Outside China, Feng is best known for having been refused re-entry into China eight times in 2009, despite being a Chinese citizen. He protested and remained in the immigration hall of [[Narita International Airport]] for 92 days, attracted concern from Asian activists, and received worldwide media attention.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/13/chinese-activist-japan-airport |title=Chinese human rights activist stuck at Tokyo airport |agency=Associated Press, Tokyo |work= The Guardian |date=13 November 2009 | location=London | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Feng was born in [[Wenzhou]], [[Zhejiang]]. He started his business in 1980s and later founded the Institute of China Business Development. He lives in Shanghai; he has a sister, who lives in Japan with her Japanese husband.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

===Imprisonment===
He criticized the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] and the [[People's Liberation Army]] for suppressing the democratization of the Chinese society. He later went to study in Japan and returned to China, and was imprisoned in 2001 for "illegal business activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/11/30/world/worldwatch/entry5834483.shtml| work=CBS News | title=Feng Zhenghu: Changing China from Terminal 1 | date=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2015}}
===Refused entry to China===
Since 2007 Feng edited "Supervision Bulletin" a 1000-copy circulation monthly newsletter reporting on cases of social injustices and official breaches of the law, such as studies of ordinary folk who had had their property seized or had rights violated by the authorities.&lt;ref name=20121010sampsonia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sampsoniaway.org/fearless-ink/2012/10/10/feng-zhenghu-imprisoned-at-home-for-over-200-days/|title=Feng Zhenghu: Imprisoned at Home for Over 200 Days - Sampsonia Way Magazine|work=sampsoniaway.org|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feng also edited four volumes of ''I want to post a suit: Casebook of the non-action of the Shanghai Judicial Authority'', which contain 430 case studies of violations of citizens' civil rights have been violated and how their rights of appeal have been infringed.&lt;ref name=20121010sampsonia/&gt;

In early 2009, Feng was inexplicably detained for 41 days;&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-japan-terminal-man19-2009nov19,0,29937.story |title=Man unable to enter China languishes in Tokyo airport |first=John |last=Glionna |work= Los Angeles Times |date=19 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he left China for medical treatment in Japan soon afterwards — in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/banned-11042009150704.html |title=China Bars Returning Activists |author= Radio Free Asia |date=4 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On attempting to return home in June, he was refused entry by the authorities. According to Feng's sister, airlines prevented him from boarding a China-bound flight four times; on the four occasions he succeeded in boarding a plane, Chinese authorities at Shanghai turned him away. A Japanese immigration official said Feng arrived from Shanghai on 4 November with a valid Chinese passport and a visa to enter Japan – but has refused to enter Japan, opting instead to attempt return to China.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; He spent his time on a couch near an immigration checkpoint in the south wing of Terminal 1 of Narita Airport, subsisting on snacks given to him by travellers and activists (including Hong Kong activist [[Christina Chan]]).&lt;ref name=hkstandard/&gt; He has been likened to the [[Tom Hanks]] character in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 2004 film ''[[The Terminal]]'',&lt;ref name=hkstandard&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking_news_detail.asp?id=17042&amp;icid=4&amp;d_str=20091113|title=HK activist delivers food to Tokyo airport camper|date=13 November 2009|work=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_453394.html|title= Chinese activist in limbo  |date=12 November 2009|work=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has watched the film on DVD. From 3 December 2009, the airport authorities issued daily notices to Mr. Feng, requesting him to leave the arrival zone and be admitted into Japan.&lt;ref name=fengstwitter&gt;{{cite news|url=https://twitter.com/fzhenghu|title=Feng Zhenghu's Twitter(in Chinese)|date=5 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/fzhenghu/4162510167/|title=冯正虎向中国政府转呈12月6日的日本官方文件（总第4份）|work=flickr.com|accessdate=16 June 2016|date=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/12/03/japan.chinese.activist/index.html?iref=allsearch | publisher=CNN | title=Chinese activist in limbo at Tokyo airport | accessdate=2 May 2010 | date=4 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, after several visits by Chinese diplomats from Tokyo, Feng announced on 2 February 2010 that he was going to enter Japan on the next day in anticipation of being allowed to return to Shanghai by mid February.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100202/ap_on_re_as/as_japan_terminal_activist.story |title=Man who spent 3 months in Tokyo airport to leave |first=Mari |last=Yamaguchi |agency= Associated Press |date=2 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 February 2010, Feng publicly announced his plan to return to Shanghai. On 12 February 2010, two days ahead of [[Chinese New Year]], he successfully entered China after arriving on a flight from Narita to Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/11/AR2010021105003.html | work=The Washington Post}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he stayed in his Shanghai apartment under guarded house arrest.&lt;ref name=Sued&gt;Pavillons und Arbeitslager.

[[File:FrancoisdeMontmorency-Bouteville-15.jpg|thumb|François de Montmorency, comte de [[Bouteville]] et de [[Luxé]], by [[Daniel Dumonstier|Dumonstier]]]]

'''François de Montmorency-Bouteville''' (1600{{spaced ndash}}22 June 1627) was the second son of Louis de [[House of Montmorency|Montmorency]], Comte de [[Bouteville]], [[Vice-admiral#France|Vice-Admiral]] of France under [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]]. François succeeded his brother Henri in 1616 and became [[Duke of Luxembourg-Piney|Duke of Luxembourg]] and Governor of [[Senlis (Oise)|Senlis]]. He served with distinction at the sieges of [[Saint-Jean-d'Angély]], [[Montauban]], [[Royan]] and [[Montpellier]].

After fighting a [[duel]] against the Comte de Pontgibaud, he killed the Marquis de Portes in 1625.&lt;ref&gt;Clémencet 1818, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Dueling had long been forbidden, but the penalty of death was rarely enforced. [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who believed the severity of the penalty contributed to its lack of enforcement, argued for its liberalization. An edict of February 1626 restricted the death penalty to duels in which one of the participants died, or the seconds also dueled. It was registered by ''[[parlement]]'' on 24 March.&lt;ref name=Levi&gt;Levi 2000, pp. 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;  Montmorency-Bouteville dueled and killed Jacques de Matignon, Comte de Thorigny, on 25 March.&lt;ref&gt;Anselme 1712, p. 657 (Jacques de Matignon, son of {{Interlanguage link multi|Charles de Matignon, Comte de Thorigny |fr |3=Charles de Goyon de Matignon (1564-1648)|vertical-align=sup}}).&lt;/ref&gt; He injured the Baron de la Frette in 1627,&lt;ref&gt;Salabéry 1834, p. 546; Edwards 1893, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt; then fled to [[Brussels]] to escape the wrath of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. Eventually Louis XIII let it be known that Montmorency-Bouteville could return to France, but not to Paris or the court.&lt;ref name=Levi/&gt;

François d'Harcourt Beuvron, a relative of Thorigny, was determined to avenge Thorigny's death. At the insistence of Louis XIII, a dinner of reconciliation was arranged in Brussels, but failed, and afterward Beuvron issued a challenge. On 12 May 1627 at the [[Place des Vosges|Place Royale]] in Paris, Montmorency-Bouteville dueled Beuvron without fatality, but Montmorency-Bouteville's second, François de Rosmadec, Comte de Chappelles, dueled and killed Beuvron's second, the Marquis de Bussi d'Amboise. While Beuvron took refuge in England, Montmorency-Bouteville and Rosmadec, despite their nobility, were beheaded at the [[Place de Grève]] in Paris on 22 June 1627.&lt;ref&gt;Clémencet 1818, p. 63; Levi 2000, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

His posthumous son, [[François Henri de Montmorency-Bouteville, duc de Luxembourg|François-Henri]], became a [[Marshal of France]]; his daughter Élisabeth-Angélique was married in turn to Gaspard IV de [[Duc de Coligny|Coligny]] (son of [[Gaspard III de Coligny|Gaspard III]]) and [[Christian Louis I, Duke of Mecklenburg|Christian Ludwig I zu Mecklenburg]] (son of [[Adolf Frederick I, Duke of Mecklenburg|Adolf Friedrich I]]).

'''George Washington Van Tassel''' (March 12, 1910 – February 9, 1978) was an [[United States|American]] [[contactee]], [[ufologist]], author.

==History==
Van Tassel was born in [[Jefferson, Ohio|Jefferson]], [[Ohio]] in 1910, and grew up in a fairly prosperous middle-class family. He finished high school in the 10th grade and held a job at a [[Cleveland]] airport; he also acquired a pilot's license. At 20, he headed for [[California]], where at first he worked for a garage owned by an uncle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/467760/I-Rode-A-Flying-Saucer-George-Van-Tassel |title=I Rode A Flying Saucer - George Van Tassel |website=Scribd.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working at the garage he met Frank Critzer, an eccentric loner who claimed to be working a mine somewhere near [[Giant Rock]], a 7-story boulder near [[Landers, California]]. Frank Critzer was a German immigrant trying to make a living in the desert as a prospector. During [[World War II]], Critzer was under suspicion as a German spy and died during a police siege at the Rock in 1942. Upon receiving news of Critzer's death, Van Tassel applied for a lease of the abandoned airport near Giant Rock from the Bureau of Land Management, who managed the land, and was eventually given a renewable Federal Government contract to develop the airstrip.&lt;ref name="scribd1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/19708836/When-Stars-Look-Down-By-George-Van-Tassel |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305083051/https://www.scribd.com/doc/19708836/When-Stars-Look-Down-By-George-Van-Tassel |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Tassel became an aircraft mechanic and flight inspector who at various times between 1930 and 1947 worked for [[Douglas Aircraft]], [[Hughes Aircraft]], and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]. While at Hughes Aircraft he was the Top Flight Inspector.&lt;ref name="scribd1"/&gt; He finally left [[Southern California]]'s booming [[aerospace]] industry for the desert in 1947. He and his family at first lived a simple existence in the rooms Frank Critzer had dug out under Giant Rock. Van Tassel eventually built a home, a cafe, a small airstrip, and a [[dude ranch]] beside the Rock.&lt;ref name="scribd1"/&gt;

George Van Tassel died of a heart attack in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/02/a-time-machine-in-the-mojave-desert/385652/|title=A Time Machine in the Mojave Desert — A four-story structure designed to recharge cell structure is now a recording studio and tourist attraction.|date=20 February 2015|first=Jennifer|last=McCartney|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Integratron}}
George Van Tassel started hosting group meditation in 1953 in a room underneath [[Giant Rock]] excavated by Frank Critzer, a prospector. That year, according to Van Tassel the occupant of a space ship from the planet Venus woke him up, invited him on board his space ship, and both verbally and telepathically gave him a technique for rejuvenating the human body. In 1954, Van Tassel and others began building what they called the "Integratron" to perform the rejuvenation. According to Van Tassel, the Integratron was to be a structure for scientific research into time, anti-gravity and at extending human life, built partially upon the research of [[Nikola Tesla]] and [[Georges Lakhovsky]]. Van Tassel described the Integratron as being created for scientific and spiritual research with the aim to recharge and rejuvenate people's cells, "a time machine for basic research on rejuvenation, anti-gravity and time travel".&lt;ref name="labyrinthina1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labyrinthina.com/rock.htm |title=Integratron's George Van Tassel and the Giant Rock Spaceship Conventions with George Hunt Williamson 1950s |website=Labyrinthina.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The domed wood structure has a rotating metal apparatus on the outside he called an "electrostatic dirod". Van Tassel claimed it was made of non-[[ferromagnetic]] materials:  wood, concrete, glass, and fibreglass, lacking even metal screws or nails. The Integratron was never fully completed due to Van Tassel's sudden death a few weeks before the official opening. In recent times some people who visit the unfinished Integratron claim to be rejuvenated by staying there, and experiencing "sound baths" inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.integratron.com/ |title=Integratron |website=Integratron.com |date=1966-11-17 |accessdate=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conventions and organizations==
Van Tassel was a classic 1950s [[contactee]] in the mold of [[George Adamski]], [[Truman Bethurum]], [[Orfeo Angelucci]] and many others. He hosted "The Giant Rock Spacecraft Convention" annually beside the Rock, from 1953 to 1978, which attracted at its peak in 1959 as many as 10,000 attendees. Guests trekked to the desert by car or landed airplanes on Van Tassel's small airstrip, called Giant Rock Airport.&lt;ref name="labyrinthina1"/&gt;

Every famous [[contactee]] appeared personally at these conventions over the years, and many more not-so-famous ones. References often state that the first and most famous [[contactee]], [[George Adamski]], pointedly boycotted these conventions. In fact, however, Adamski attended the third convention, held in 1955, where he gave a 35-minute lecture and was interviewed by [[Edward J. Ruppelt]], once head of the Air Force ''[[Project Blue Book]]''. It was the only such convention Adamski attended.&lt;ref name="labyrinthina1"/&gt;

Van Tassel founded a metaphysics research organization called The Ministry of Universal Wisdom, and The College of Universal Wisdom to codify the spiritual revelations he was now regularly receiving via communications with the people from Space.&lt;ref name="scribd1"/&gt;

==Publications==
Van Tassel's book, ''I Rode A Flying Saucer'' (1952, 1955), recounts his claims of receiving "cosmic wisdom" "Solgonda" and a large number of other people from space. Among his other works are ''Into This World and Out Again'' (1956), ''The Council of Seven Lights'' (1958), ''Religion and Science Merged'', and ''When Stars Look Down''.

[[File:GerardMortier.jpg|thumb|upright|Gerard Mortier]]
'''Gerard Alfons August, Baron Mortier''' (25 November 1943 – 8 March 2014) was a Belgian [[opera]] director and administrator of [[Flemish people|Flemish]] origin.

==Biography==
Born in [[Ghent]], the son of a baker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Ben Lawrence | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/10686260/Opera-director-Gerard-Mortier-dies-aged-70.html | title=Opera director Gerard Mortier dies aged 70 | work=Telegraph | date=2014-03-09 | accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortier attended in youth the Jesuit private school [[Sint-Barbaracollege]], following the death of his mother. He subsequently studied law and journalism at [[Ghent University]].

Mortier pursued apprenticeships in opera administration under [[Christoph von Dohnányi]] in Frankfurt and [[Rolf Liebermann]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2014/3/News/Gerard_Mortier.html|title=Gerard Mortier, 70, Intendant Who Courted Innovation and Controversy in the Opera House, Has Died|author=Fred Cohn|work=[[Opera News]]|date=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for the Flanders Festival from 1968 to 1972.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite web | author=Andrew Clark | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b4dbe1fe-b053-11e3-8058-00144feab7de.html#axzz3Os1PeePA | title=Obituary: Gerard Mortier, arts administrator, 1943-2014 | work=Financial Times | date=2014-03-21 | accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first major administrative post was as the general director of [[La Monnaie]] (De Munt) in Brussels from 1981 to 1991, where he was credited with artistically rejuvenating the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Rupert Christiansen]]|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/10686518/Gerard-Mortiers-devotion-to-opera-was-intense-and-unswerving.html|title=Gerard Mortier's devotion to opera was intense and unswerving|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2014-03-09|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently held the general directorship of the [[Salzburg Festival]] from 1991 to 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christian Merlin|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/musique/2014/03/09/03006-20140309ARTFIG00135-gerard-mortier-requiem-pour-un-moderne.php|title=Gerard Mortier, requiem pour un moderne|work=[[Le Figaro]]|language=fr|date=2014-03-09|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortier was the founding director of the [[Ruhrtriennale]] arts festival in Germany, leading it from 2002 to 2004. He was inspired to "a social and artistic experiment: how to attract new audiences to the classics and galvanize a depressed corner of Germany."&lt;ref name=ruhr /&gt; At the same time, he was able to work his own interests in flouting tradition and attracting new audiences to the Ruhr.&lt;ref name="ruhr"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[John Rockwell]]|title=Tempting Audiences To German Rust Belt; Ruhr Triennale Flouts Tradition|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07EED61E3FF936A25756C0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=15 May 2003|accessdate=29 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He put intimate productions into expansive, renovated industrial spaces. In 2003, he offered an ambitious season of
&lt;blockquote&gt;
23 productions with 129 performances in 15 spaces, along with additional concerts, a fringe festival and what promises to be an astonishing installation of a [[Bill Viola]] video spectacle, ''Five Angels for the Millennium,'' inside a mighty, gorgeously restored gas tank in Oberhausen.&lt;ref name="ruhr" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Planned was a production of [[Olivier Messiaen|Messiaen]]'s ''[[Saint François d'Assise]]'' in September 2003. Mortier had a "current of spirituality meant to infuse these cathedrals of industry", and emphasized a French subtext in 2003, compared to a German one the year before. He had "faith that audiences will eventually respond to the experimentation by him and his successors."&lt;ref name="ruhr" /&gt;

Mortier served as general director of the [[Opéra National de Paris]] from 2004 to 2009.

In February 2007, the [[New York City Opera]] (NYCO) named him their next general director, effective as of the 2009/2010 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Daniel J. Wakin|title=City Opera Lures Director From Paris|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/28/arts/music/28oper.html|work=The New York Times|date=28 February 2007|accessdate=29 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortier assisted with company operations from Paris during the interim period after his appointment was announced. Problems with fund-raising and a smaller-than-expected budget began to develop during the interim period after his appointment. In addition, Mortier was campaigning for a position as co-artistic director of the [[Bayreuth Festival]].&lt;ref name="Millington"&gt;{{cite web | author=Barry Millington | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/14/gerard-mortier | title=Gerard Mortier obituary | work=The Guardian | date=2014-03-14 | accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, by mutual agreement, Mortier and the NYCO agreed to terminate their contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Daniel J. Wakin|title=Bold Impresario and City Opera Part Ways|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/08/arts/music/08oper.html|work=The New York Times|date=7 November 2008|accessdate=29 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in November 2008, Mortier accepted the position of Artistic Director of the [[Teatro Real]] in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=El Teatro Real ficha a Gérard Mortier|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cultura/Teatro/Real/ficha/Gerard/Mortier/elpepucul/20081126elpepucul_8/Tes|work=El País|date=26 November 2008|accessdate=29 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in New York, he had already commissioned a new opera, ''[[Brokeback Mountain (opera)|Brokeback Mountain]]'', with the American composer [[Charles Wuorinen]] and a libretto by [[Annie Proulx]], who wrote the original short story on which it is based. This was one of the projects Mortier took with him to the Teatro Real, and it was completed in 2012.

In September 2013, Mortier disclosed publicly his condition of cancer. During the search for his successor, he made controversial comments that he did not know of a fully qualified Spanish candidate to succeed him, and mentioned concerns about the expressed government interference in the choice of successor and their wish to have only a Spanish candidate succeed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Daniel Verdú | url=http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2013/09/02/actualidad/1378150163_102238.html | title=Mortier: 'Si el Gobierno impone a mi sucesor, no esperaré a 2016: me voy' | work=El País | date=2013-09-03 | accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Paul Hamilos | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/10/madrid-teatro-real-gerard-mortier | title=Madrid's Teatro Real boss sparks row by saying no Spaniard can succeed him | work=The Guardian | date=2013-09-10 | accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, following the appointment of [[Joan Matabosch]] as the company next's artistic director, Mortier was named artistic advisor of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Gerard Mortier, Artistic Advisor for Teatro Real | publisher=Teatro Real | date=2013-09-26 | url=http://www.teatro-real.com/en/news/detalle/gerard-mortier-artistic-advisor-for-teatro-real | accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 28, 2014, ''Brokeback Mountain'' premiered in Madrid. The production had been highly anticipated in the international season, and it was considered also a tribute to Mortier, "and a testament to his tireless support of the artists who work with him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Zachary Woolfe | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/arts/music/charles-wuorinen-adapts-brokeback-mountain-as-opera.html | title=Love That Dare Not Sing Its Name | work=The New York Times | date=2014-01-24 | accessdate=2014-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortier died of pancreatic cancer in [[Brussels]] on 8 March 2014, aged 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Zachary Woolfe | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/arts/music/gerard-mortier-opera-visionary-dies-at-70.html | title=Gerard Mortier, Opera Visionary and Patron of New Work, Dies at 70 | work=The New York Times | date=2014-03-10 | accessdate=2014-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors include his sister Rita&lt;ref name="Millington"/&gt; and his longtime companion, conductor [[Sylvain Cambreling]].&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; In April 2014, Mortier was posthumously awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award in the [[International Opera Awards]] 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operaawards.org/Winners2014.aspx|title=Opera Awards 2014|publisher=The International Opera Awards|accessdate=2014-04-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412121043/http://www.operaawards.org/Winners2014.aspx|archivedate=12 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
She married Sultan [[Mehmed II]] in 1446 at [[Manisa]].&lt;ref name="Fatih"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060502151014/http://www.4dw.net/royalark/Turkey/turkey3.htm The Imperial House of Osman - 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin===
The Ottoman inscription (''vakfiye'') describes her as ''Hātun binti Abdullah (Daughter of Abdullah)'', which means that her father was possibly a convert to [[Islam]].

===Issue===
She was mother of  ''"Gevher-Han Sultan",'' who married the son of [[Aq Qoyunlu]] Sultan [[Uzun Hasan]], "Şâh-Zâde Uğurlu Damad Muhammed Mirza Paşa"&lt;ref name="Fatih"/&gt; in 1474, and the mother of [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Bayezid II]].&lt;ref name="Bayezid-Mother"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sakaoğlu2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Necdet Sakaoğlu|title=Famous Ottoman women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mItAQAAIAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Avea|page=69|quote=The graves of Gül-Bahars are very well khown.

Per custom, Gülbahar got the highest position as Valde Hatun in the imperial family after the sultan himself when her son, Bayezid II, ascended the throne in 1481 until her death in 1492. During her son's reign, she and the rest of the Imperial Family resided at the Old Palace (''saray-ı atik'') and were visited by the Sultan who on each visit used to pay his respect to his mother. In one case, Gülbahar complained of her son's rare visits and in a letter to her son wrote: {{bq|text="My fortune, I miss you. Even if you don't miss me, I miss you ... Come and let me see you. My dear lord, if you are going on campaign soon, come once or twice at least so that I may see your fortune-favored face before you go. It's been forty days since I last saw you. My sultan, please forgive my boldness. Who else do I have beside you ... ?"&lt;ref name="Bayezid-Mother"/&gt;}}

==In popular culture==
In 2012 film, ''[[Fetih 1453]]'', Gülbahar was portrayed by [[Şahika Koldemir]].

Lieutenant Colonel '''I Gusti Ngurah Rai''' (30 January 1917 – 20 November 1946) was an [[List of National Heroes of Indonesia|Indonesian National Hero]] who commanded Indonesian forces in [[Bali]] against the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] during the [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesian War of Independence]]. He was killed in the [[Battle of Margarana]].&lt;ref&gt;Pringle (2004), p 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MUTIARA"&gt;Mutiara Sumber Widya (publisher)(1999) p89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ngurah Rai was born in Carangsari, [[Badung Regency]], [[Bali]] on 30 January 1917. He studied at a Dutch elementary school, then went to high school in [[Malang]], [[East Java]]. He then received Dutch military training at the Military Cadet School in [[Gianyar]], Bali and [[Magelang]], [[Central Java]]. After graduating, he joined the Dutch-sponsored military as a second lieutenant in Bali.&lt;ref name="MUTIARA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SUDARMANTO205"&gt;Sudarmanto (1996) p205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
[[File:Indonesia 2005 50000r o.jpg|thumb|left|I Gusti Ngurah Rai featured on the [[Indonesian rupiah|50,000-rupiah banknote]] issued by Bank Indonesia.]]
[[File:Balinese kingdoms map.jpg|thumb|left|The political divisions among kingdoms of Bali during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] (1945-49)]]

After the [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence]] he established the People's Security Army, the forerunner of the [[military of Indonesia]], for the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]. He then left for the republican capital, [[Yogyakarta]] to receive orders before returning to Bali to oppose the approximately 2,000 Dutch troops who had landed on 2 and 3 March 1946.&lt;ref name="SUDARMANTO205"/&gt;

[[File:Statue of Ngurah Rai.jpg|thumb|Statue of I Gusti Ngurah Rai, Bali]]

Ngurah Rai found that the republican forces were divided and he worked hard to reunite them. He then organized the first attack against the Dutch forces headquarters at [[Tabanan]]. The Dutch then attempted to locate Nguraha Rai's base and offered negotiations, which he refused.

On 20 November 1946, the Dutch launched a large attack on Marga with the assistance of troops from [[Lombok]] and supported by aircraft. Lt. Col Ngurah Rai ordered a [[Puputan]], or fight to the death. He died along with all of his troops. The battle is now known as the Battle of Margarana.&lt;ref name="MUTIARA"/&gt;However, because Ngurah Rai's entire force was wiped out, including the military leadership, the Dutch forces were subsequently unopposed and were able to regain control of Bali. This may not have been possible had Ngurah Rai adopted a guerrilla strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung (1996) p89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burial and national hero status==
Ngurah Rai was buried in Marga. On 9 August 1975, he was made a national hero via Presidential Decision No. 063/TK/TH 1975.&lt;ref name="MUTIARA"/&gt; [[Ngurah Rai International Airport]] in [[Bali]] is named for him and he appears on the [[Indonesian rupiah|IDR]]50,000 note.

According to the ancient Hindu law, the Kshatriyas are alone having the rights to bear arms in order to defend the country.

Most prominent of the Kshatriya clans in Java were those located in ''Koripan, Gaglang, Kediri and Janggala''. The literary work ''Rangga Lawe'' describes in detail about the Kshatriyas and [[Vaishya]]s of the Kediri royal palace.

Some of these Kshatriya clans migrated to the island of Bali as well.

'''Julian Stewart Thomas''' (born 1959) is a British [[Archaeology|archaeologist]], publishing on the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[prehistory]] of Britain and north-west Europe. Thomas has been vice president of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute]] since 2007, is a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], has been [[Professor#Most other English-speaking countries|professor]] of archaeology at the [[University of Manchester]] since 2000, and is former secretary of the [[World Archaeological Congress]]. Thomas is perhaps best known as the author of the academic publication ''Understanding the Neolithic'' in particular, and for his work with the [[Stonehenge Riverside Project]].&lt;ref name="Antique 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Society of Antiquaries of London - News archive|url=http://www.sal.org.uk/newsandevents/newsarchive/index_html/view?searchterm=Julian%20Thomas|accessdate=2009-10-24|publisher=[[Society of Antiquaries of London]]|year=2009|work= Society of Antiquaries of London website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Born in [[Epsom]], [[Surrey]], Thomas studied archaeology at the [[University of Bradford]], where he acquired a [[Bachelor of Technology|BTech]] in [[archaeological science]] in 1981, before transferring to the [[University of Sheffield]] and achieving an [[Master of Arts|MA]] (in 1982), and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] (in 1986), for his research on the "social and economic change in the Neolithic of Wessex and the Upper Thames valley".&lt;ref name="Man Uni"&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Julian Thomas, research profile - personal details (The University of|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/Julian.thomas/personaldetails|accessdate=2009-09-27|publisher=[[University of Manchester]]|date=2009-09-27|work=The University of Manchester website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Stonehenge back wide.jpg|right|thumb|292px|&lt;center&gt;[[Stonehenge]]&lt;br/&gt;A [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]&lt;br/&gt;and part of the [[Stonehenge Riverside Project]]&lt;/center&gt;|alt=Standing stones at Stonehenge in the sunlight, with dark clouds above]]
Between 1987 and 2000 Thomas was a lecturer in archaeology at the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]] (1987&amp;ndash;1993) and at [[Southampton University]] (1994&amp;ndash;2000). Thomas worked with [[Historic Scotland]] between 1994 and 2002, excavating prehistoric sites in [[Dumfries]] and [[Galloway]] as "Director of archaeological excavations of Neolithic and later prehistoric sites" &amp;ndash; the record of which was published as ''Place and Memory: Excavations at the Pict's Knowe, Holywood and Holm Farm'' in 2007.&lt;ref name="Antique 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Man Uni"/&gt;

Originally published as ''Rethinking the Neolithic'' in 1991, Thomas revised his work, which was republished as ''Understanding the Neolithic'' in 1999. The book challenged the conventionally held view that human lifestyles transformed in [[Great Britain]], from [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s to Neolithic farmers &amp;ndash; a process known as the "[[Neolithic Revolution]]"&amp;ndash; through interpretive analysis of "social theory, anthropology and critical hermeneutics".&lt;ref name="Rout 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the Neolithic - Preview|url=http://www.ewidgetsonline.com/dxreader/Reader.aspx?token=F%2fAji97QLS1%2fdYZSgtomKg%3d%3d&amp;rand=1316950296&amp;buyNowLink=|accessdate=2009-10-24|publisher=[[Routledge]]year=2007|work=Routledge website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1994 and 1999 Thomas was secretary of the [[World Archaeological Congress]] and became academic series editor (a ''[[Pro bono publico|pro bono]]'' (unpaid) position held jointly with [[Martin Hall (academic)|Martin Hall]]) of the [[Routledge]] series ''Themes in Archaeology'' &amp;ndash; which moved to [[Left Coast Press]] as the ''One World Archaeology Series'' in 2008.

Thomas took up the Chair of Archaeology at Manchester University in April 2000, a position he still holds.

Thomas is co-director of the [[Stonehenge Riverside Project]] &amp;ndash; a collaborative archaeological study begun in 2003 as a consortium of university teams, funded by the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council|AHRC]] and the [[National Geographic Society]]. During excavations of sites surrounding [[Stonehenge]] &amp;ndash; including [[Stonehenge Cursus]], [[Stonehenge Avenue|the Avenue]] and [[Woodhenge]] &amp;ndash; Thomas found evidence of a large settlement of Neolithic houses, at [[Durrington Walls]], nearby and discovered the [[prehistoric]] [[henge]] and [[stone circle]], known as "[[Bluestonehenge]]", on the west bank of the [[River Avon (Hampshire)|Avon]].&lt;ref name="SHR 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=stonehenge (The University of Manchester)|url=http://www.arts.manchester.ac.uk/subjectareas/archaeology/research/stonehenge/|accessdate=2009-10-22|publisher=University of Manchester|date=2008-05-29|work=The Stonehenge Riverside Project report|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009130957/http://www.arts.manchester.ac.uk/subjectareas/archaeology/research/stonehenge/|archivedate=2009-10-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SHR 3"&gt;{{cite news|title=Timber shrine reveals Stonehenge secret - TimesOnline|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1303146.ece|accessdate=2009-10-23|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=2007-01-30|work=TimesOnline website | location=London | first=Mark | last=Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gruniad 1"&gt;{{cite news|title='Second Stonehenge' discovered near original|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/oct/06/second-stonehenge-discovered|accessdate=2009-10-23|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2009-10-23|work=guardian.co.uk website | location=London | first=James | last=Sturcke}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas speculates that the 25 [[bluestone]]s at [[Stonehenge]] &amp;ndash; originating in the [[Preseli Hills]], {{convert|250|km}} away in modern-day [[Pembrokeshire]], [[Wales]] &amp;ndash; stood in a circle, surrounded by a [[henge]], at [[Bluestonehenge]] for around 500 years before being dismantled and moved to their current location around 2500 [[Common Era|BCE]].&lt;ref name="Nat Geo 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mini-Stonehenge Found: Crematorium on Stonehenge Road?|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/10/091005-mini-stonehenge-bluestonehenge-bluehenge.html|accessdate=2009-10-31|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|date=2009-10-05|work= National Geographic News website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kelabit''' are an indigenous [[Dayak people]] of the [[Sarawak]]/[[North Kalimantan]] highlands of [[Borneo]] with a minority in the neighbouring state of [[Brunei]]. They have close ties to the [[Lun Bawang]]. The elevation there is slightly over 1,200&amp;nbsp;meters. In the past, because there were few roads (only poorly maintained logging roads, which tended not to be too close to the Bario Highlands) and because the area was largely inaccessible by river because of [[rapids]], the highlands and the Kelabit were relatively untouched by modern western influences.  Now, however, there is a relatively permanent road route on which it is possible to reach Bario by car from Miri.  The road is marked but driving without a local guide  is not advisable, as it takes over 11 hours of driving to reach Bario from Miri through many logging trail junctions and river crossings.

With a population of approximately 6,600 people (2013) the Kelabit comprise one of the smallest [[ethnic groups]] in [[Sarawak]]. Many have migrated to [[urban areas]] over the last 20&amp;nbsp;years and it is estimated that only 1,200 still live in their remote homeland. There, tightly knit communities live in inherited [[longhouse]]s and practice a generations-old form of agriculture. Hunting and fishing is also practised. Domesticated [[Bubalus|buffalo]] are valued highly, seven of which are traditionally required for the [[dowry]] for an upper class bride.

==Etymology==
[[File:Sarawak; three native Kalabit women. Photograph. Wellcome V0037427.jpg|thumb|Three native Kelabit women, 1922.]]
The name of the people comes from the local word, "''na labid''"; where the name of people originated from the name of Labid River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etnolog.ru/people.php?id=KELA |title=Келабиты|author= |publisher=Etnolog |date= |accessdate=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, other people group names such as Lun Bawang, Lun Dayeh or Southern Muruts are often associated with the Kelabit people. The Kelabit people belong to the [[Dayak people]] (it is a large ethnic group of closely related people groups that includes about 200 tribes). With a population of approximately 6,600, the Kelabit people are the smallest people group in the state of [[Sarawak]].

==History==
During the [[Second World War]] the Kelabit, like other natives of Borneo, were co-opted by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] into fighting the Japanese. The English academic [[Tom Harrisson]] led the [[Operation Semut|Semut I operations]] (one of four Semut operations in the area), which parachuted into their midst in 1945 to make contact; they were supplied with weapons by the Australian military and played an essential role in the liberation of Borneo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2016/08/14/teripun-a-reminder-of-kelabits-roots/ |title=Teripun a reminder of Kelabits’ roots|author=Cecilia Sman |publisher=The Borneo Post |date=14 August 2016 |accessdate=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
After the Second World War the Kelabit people received visits from [[Christian missionaries]] of the [[Borneo Evangelical Mission]]. The Kelabit are now predominantly Christian. Prior to conversion they had a custom of erecting [[megalith]]s and digging ditches in honour of notable individuals. As the Kelabit people began to Christianize in the early 20th century, so did the process of ethnic consolidation were also intensified.&lt;ref name="PAROTW"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Тишков В.А.|title=Народы и религии мира. Энциклопедия|year=1999|publisher=М.: Большая Российская энциклопедия|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The Kelabit people uses [[Latin script]] that were introduced to the island by the colonialist from Europe. The [[Kelabit language]] belongs to the [[North Bornean languages|North Bornean branch]] of the [[Western Malayo-Polynesian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=William J. Frawley|title=International Encyclopedia of Linguistics: AAVE - Esperanto, Volume 1|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=01-951-3977-1|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kelabit language]] is used in one of the most remote areas of the Borneo island in the [[Bario]] highlands of Kalimantan and northern [[Sarawak]]. There are several dialects in the [[Kelabitic languages]] such as Lepu Potng, Padas, Trusan and so on.

==Culture==

===Family===
There is a strict order (rule) of inheritance, which includes the need for one person to organize expensive commemorative celebrations (perhaps, a wake) for people who inherit from them. The conflict between older brothers and sisters can be particularly noticeable in connection with these circumstances. In any case, the Kelabit family is a cooperating unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Tom Harrison|title=Human Studies in Central Borneo|year=1945-1948|publisher=Man, v50 (19500201): 19-20|issn=0025-1496|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# A spouse, with whom one would grow rice together
# Children
# Rice, with which one would be able to feed their children and grandchildren

In rural communities there is a division of castes namely, the nobility, the ordinary community members and the descendants of those who were in slavery. The leader always comes from the nobility. He must have things that are regarded as special prestige among the Kelabit people. These are ancient items of Chinese origin such as, porcelain vases, beads or gongs, as well as items that are made from pearls.

===Settlements===
Kelabit villages usually include only one [[longhouse]], in which all the inhabitants of the community would live in. A [[longhouse]] can stretch as long as 75 meters in length. Such house does not have partitions that divides into rooms.&lt;ref name="PAROTW"/&gt;

===Clothing===
[[File:BEADED AND TATTOOED BEAUTIES OF THE KALABIT TRIBE.jpg|thumb|upright|All Kelabit women are tattooed when they reach the age of 16. Bold zigzag bands are traced on the forearm, not completely encircling the limb, and strikingly decorative geometrical designs are tattooed on the thigh, the shin, and sometimes, on the knee-cap. They wear strings of large blue beads around the waist and wrist, and necklaces of smaller beads. 1922.]]
In traditional society, men wear traditional loincloths, and the women would wear skirt made of [[Tapa cloth]] (material from the inside of the tree bark). Some would prefer Westernized clothing. The custom of tattooing and dulling of teeth have also become less pervalent.&lt;ref name="PAROTW"/&gt;

===Cuisine===
Rice, for the Kelabit people, symbolizes the true human food. Kelabit people mainly eat rice, and also additionally meat, fruits, vegetables, corn and sugar cane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270458845_The_Kelabit_attitude_to_the_Penan_Forever_children |title=The Kelabit attitude to the Penan: Forever children |author=Monica Janowski |publisher=La Ricerca Folklorica |date=October 1996 |accessdate=2018-03-01 |pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Kelabit cuisine are such as:-&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2012/11/15/tribal-scoops-traditional-kelabit-offering/ |title=Tribal Scoops: Traditional Kelabit offering|author=Dave Avran |publisher=Free Malaysia Today |date=15 November 2012 |accessdate=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional activities===
[[File:Sarawak; a native Kalabit smithy. Photograph. Wellcome V0037410.jpg|thumb|Kelabit blacksmith in [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]], circa 1896.]]
Pottery, blacksmithing and wood carving are all traditional crafts of Kelabit people. The form of the stone adze (chopping tools) of the Kelabit differs noticeably from the types previously recorded in Southeast Asia; where its 'quadrangular' is from [[Malaysia]], and there is no 'round ax'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Tom Harrison|title=Human Studies in Central Borneo|year=1945-1948|publisher=Man, v50 (19500201): 19-20|issn=0025-1496|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also traditional occupation of the Kelabit people includes needle-working. There are 69 items with pearls (necklaces, hats and belts) decorations. Pearl jewelry is a sign of prestige, just like Chinese porcelain vases. Necklaces are worn by both men and women, while headdresses are exclusively for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1480174|title=Perle, prestigio e vita tra i Kelabit di Sarawak |author=Monica Janowski &amp; Chiara Ingrao |publisher=La Ricerca Folklorica |date=October 1996 |doi=10.2307/1480174 |page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelabit people are interested in precious stones. Earlier before they became Christians, Kelabit people had stone amulets. Agriculture is a traditional occupation of the Kelabit people.

==Livelihood and economy==
The traditional occupation of Kelabit people is agriculture. The main cultivar is rice. They distinguish between wet [[paddy field]] and dried [[paddy field]]. In the north of the Bario Highlands, there are only wet [[paddy field]] areas. In other parts of the Highlands, dried [[paddy field]] areas have also been made, as well as other crops that have also been planted in these [[paddy field]] areas. The Kelabit people are also cultivators of [[maize]], [[tapioca]], [[pineapple]], [[pumpkin]], [[cucumber]], [[beans]], coffee, lemon grass, taro and various [[fruit]] like passion fruit and strawberry. Livestock development is limited. Meat is a special problem, as traditionally the Kelabit people used it only for sacrifices, and even today almost no animals are slaughtered for daily consumption (since, at present, there are still many Kelabit people who are adherents of traditional beliefs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270458845_The_Kelabit_attitude_to_the_Penan_Forever_children |title=The Kelabit attitude to the Penan: Forever children |author=Monica Janowski |publisher=La Ricerca Folklorica |date=October 1996 |accessdate=2018-03-01 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, they began to raise animals for dairy products and meat. The forest is the main source of wild fruits and vegetables. Forest gathering, hunting and fishing are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://goturist.ru/narod-kelabity/ |title=КЕЛАБИТЫ |publisher=Go Turist |date=18 January 2016 |accessdate=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelabit people engages in salt extraction; which plays a significant role in their economy. With salt, they would exchange from other people for their own necessities.

'''Katherine Aurora "Kitty" Kirkpatrick''' (9 April 1802 &amp;ndash; 2 March 1889) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Anglo-Indian]] woman best known as a [[muse]] of the author [[Thomas Carlyle]], and as an example of [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] children during the early years of British colonialism in [[Indian subcontinent|India]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Kitty Kirkpatrick was born on 9 April 1802, in [[Hyderabad]] in the [[State of Hyderabad]], a large [[principality]] in the southern [[Indian Subcontinent]] under [[Suzerainty#British_paramountcy|British paramountcy]]. Her father, [[James Achilles Kirkpatrick]], was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Resident (title)|Resident]] in Hyderabad and a [[colonel]] in the [[British East India Company]]'s army. Her mother, Khair-un-Nissa, was a Hyderabadi [ [[noblewoman]] and a ''[[Sayyida]]'', a lineal descendant of the Muslim prophet [[Muhammad]], whose grandfather was the [[prime minister]] of Hyderabad.&lt;ref name="DalrympleWhiteMughals"/&gt; The two had met in the court of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], and were married in a Muslim ceremony. James Kirkpatrick, a [[Christianity|Christian]], underwent some degree of [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to Islam to be permitted to marry Khair-un-Nissa, but is not clear whether the marriage or the conversion were recognized as legal.&lt;ref name="DalrympleWhiteMughals"/&gt;

Kitty was initially named Noor un-Nissa, Sahib Begum ("Little Lady of High Lineage") and was raised alongside her brother William (known as Mir Ghulam Ali, Sahib Allum) in the mansion her father built, the [[British Residency, Hyderabad]], living in the [[zenana]] with her mother and grandmother. James was a doting father and is known to have spent a lot of time with his wife and small children. In 1805, Kitty and William were sent to live in England at age three and five years, respectively, with their paternal grandfather, Colonel James Kirkpatrick. At the time, it was common for British families in India to send their young children to [[Europe]] as death rates for children in India were frighteningly high, and families wanted them to grow up as British, speaking unaccented [[English language|English]] and being educated at a British school or by British [[tutors]] in a British home, before returning. The well-known painter, [[George Chinnery]], created a portrait of the siblings in [[Madras]], shortly before they were sent to England. The two children were [[baptised]] as Christians on 25 March 1805, at [[St Marylebone Parish Church|St Mary's Church, Marylebone Road]] in [[London]], and were thereafter known by their new Christian names, William George Kirkpatrick and Katherine Aurora "Kitty" Kirkpatrick.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/dec/09/britishidentity.india White mischief], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 9 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; They never again saw India or any members of their maternal family.&lt;ref name="DalrympleWhiteMughals"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|title=White Mughals: love and betrayal in eighteenth-century India|date=2002|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-200412-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Kirkpatrick died on 15 October 1805, around 8 months after Kitty and William had left India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noor un-Nissa, Sahib Begum 'Kitty' KIRKPATRICK, later christened Katherine Aurora|url=http://www.genealogy.kirkpatrickaustralian.com/archives/getperson.php?personID=I8440&amp;tree=TKA|website=The Kirkpatrick Family Archives|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DalrympleWhiteMughals"/&gt; In his [[Will (legal)|will]], James describes William and Kitty as his "[[natural children]]," leaving large fortunes to each, and left money to his nieces and nephews, the children of his brother William Kirkpatrick, who he was deeply indebted to for launching his lucrative career with the East India Company. William Kirkpatrick, who had needed to retire to [[England]] mid-career due to poor health, had arranged for James to step into his prestigious and lucrative position as Resident at Hyderabad. James used his fortune to support William Kirkpatrick and his children out of his love for and gratitude toward his elder brother.&lt;ref name="DalrympleWhiteMughals"/&gt; Following James' death and the absence of her children, Khair-un-Nissa, who had lived in strict ''[[purdah]]'' during his lifetime, began a relationship with [[Sir Henry Russell, 2nd Baronet|Henry Russell]], one of James' assistants. Only 19 years-old at the time, Khair-un-Nissa was abandoned by Russell, destroying her reputation among the Hyderabadi elite and was forced into [[exile]], unable to prevent greedy relatives from taking over the valuable landed estates she had inherited from her father.&lt;ref name="DalrympleWhiteMughals"/&gt;

===Life in England===
{{moresources|section|date=December 2017}}
[[File:Portrait of Katherine "Kitty Kirkpatrick.jpg|thumb|right|A portrait of Katherine Kirkpatrick, ca. 1830]]
Kitty and her brother William had substantial sums settled on them by their mother, which allowed for them to be raised and educated in [[middle-class]] comfort in England. Kitty was educated privately and brought up to emulate the ideal of the Christian lady. In 1812, William suffered a severe [[burn injury]] resulted in the [[amputation]] of one of his arms, and became reclusive thereafter, though he successfully graduated from [[Oxford University]] in 1820, married, and had three daughters before his early death in 1828. Her brother's death, as well as that of her grandfather and other relations, left Kitty with a substantial inheritance estimated at about £50,000. After the death of her grandfather, Kirkpatrick lived with various of her married cousins: [[Sir John Louis, 2nd Baronet|Clementina, Lady Louis]]; Julia, the wife of Edward Strachey; and (Barbara) Isabella, the wife of Charles Buller, a [[Member of Parliament]] and mother of [[Charles Buller]] junior.

Into adulthood Kitty became known for her attractiveness, and in 1822, while staying with the Bullers, she met the Scottish philosopher and historian, [[Thomas Carlyle]], who was then employed as the Buller children's tutor and who swiftly became infatuated with Kirkpatrick. The romance was encouraged by another of Kitty's cousins, Julia (who married Edward Strachey, grandfather of the writer [[Lytton Strachey]]). However, Carlyle was impoverished and not believed by the rest of the family to be a suitable match for the wealthy and well-connected Kitty.&lt;ref name="gardner"&gt;[http://www.anthonygardner.co.uk/interviews/william_dalrymple.html Anthony Gardner: Author and Journalist - Interviews (Tatler, 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt; Carlyle would later use Kitty as the basis for the [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]]-like Blumine in his novel ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' and his [[memoirs]], written many decades later, wrote a pen portrait of Kitty admiring her beauty but is clearly suspicious of her [[mixed-race]] ancestry:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/mag/2005/02/27/stories/2005022700420700.htm Colonial Grandeur], ''[[The Hindu]]'', 27 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text=a strangely complexioned young lady, with soft brown eyes and floods of bronze-red hair, really a pretty-looking, smiling, and amiable though most foreign bit of magnificence and kindly splendour|author=Thomas Carlyle|title=''Reminiscences''}}

On 21 November 1829, Kitty married James Winslowe Phillipps (1802-1859), an army [[Military Officer|officer]] in the 7th Hussars Regiment, and a member of the [[Kennaway_baronets|Kennaway family]], which also had Indian connections. It was evidently a happy marriage, Kirkpatrick and Phillipps went on to have seven children, of whom four survived to adulthood: Mary Augusta (1830-1909), John James (b. 1834), Emily Georgina (b. 1835), and Bertha Elizabeth (1840-1875).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noor un-Nissa, Sahib Begum 'Kitty' KIRKPATRICK, later christened Katherine Aurora|url=http://www.genealogy.kirkpatrickaustralian.com/archives/getperson.php?personID=I8440&amp;tree=TKA|website=The Kirkpatrick Family Archives|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renewed contact with India===
Kirkpatrick's paternal family had long forbidden her from maintaining any contact with her family in India. However, with the help of Henry Russell, her father's former assistant and her mother's ex-lover, Kirkpatrick was able to re-establish contact with her maternal grandmother after almost four decades of separation. Although they were never physically re-united, the two women were correspondents on a regular and often emotional basis for six years. 

Kirkpatrick's letters make it clear that despite leaving India and her mother at such a young age, she still retained vivid memories of it:
{{Quote|text=I often think of you and remember you and my dear mother. I often dream that I am with you in India and that I see you both in the room you used to sit in. No day of my life has ever passed without my thinking of my dear mother. I can remember the verandah and the place where the tailors worked and a place on the house top where my mother used to let me sit down and slide. When I dream of my mother I am in such joy to have found her again that I awake, or else am pained in finding that she cannot understand the English I speak. I can well recollect her cries when we left her and I can now see the place where she sat when we parted, and her tearing her long hair. What worlds would I give to possess one lock of that beautiful and much loved hair! How dreadful to think that so many, many years have passed when it would have done my heart such good to think that you loved me &amp; when I longed to write to you &amp; tell you these feelings that I was never able to express, a letter which I was sure would have been detained &amp; now how wonderful it is that after 35 years I am able for the first time to hear that you think of me, and love me, and have perhaps wondered why I did not write to you, and that you have thought me cold and insensible to such near dear ties.|author=Katherine Kirkpatrick|title=''[[White Mughals]]''|source=386-87}} 

Kirkpatrick died at her home, the Villa Sorrento, in [[Torquay]], [[Devon]], in 1889.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

'''Liu Miaomiao''' ({{zh|s=刘苗苗|t=劉苗苗}}) (born 1962 in [[Guyuan]], [[Ningxia]]) is a female Chinese film director. Liu, an ethnic [[Hui people|Hui]] [[Islam in China|Muslim]], was the youngest member of the 1982 class of the [[Beijing Film Academy]], commonly referred to as the [[Cinema of China#The rise of the Fifth Generation, 1980s-1990s|Fifth Generation]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;Zhang, Yingjin &amp; Xiao, Zhiwei (1998). "Liu Miaomiao" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=MIkc8os0WPwC&amp;pg=PA164 ''Encyclopedia of Chinese Film'']. Taylor &amp; Francis, p. 227. {{ISBN|0-415-15168-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Her career has spanned both film and television, though she remains less well known than many of her male counterparts to international audiences.

== Career ==
Liu graduated from the BFA's directing program, in which she enrolled at the age of sixteen,&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia2&gt;Cui, Shuqin (2005).  "Liu Miaomiao" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=U2cO7tjYIK0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Zhang+Jianya%22&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 ''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture''], edited by Edward Lawrence Davis. Routledge, p. 482. {{ISBN|0-203-64506-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; along with directors such as [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]] and [[Chen Kaige]]. Upon graduation, she was assigned to the [[Xiaoxing Film Studio]] where she directed her first solo work, ''Stories of the Voyage'' in 1985 at the age of 23.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;

In 1987, she directed the war film ''[[Women on the Long March]]'', about eight female Red Army soldiers who find themselves separated from their main force during the [[Long March]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hu | first = Lindan | title = Rescuing female desire from revolutionary history: Chinese women’s cinema in the 1980s | journal = [[Asian Journal of Women's Studies]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages =  49–65 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/12259276.2017.1279890 | date = 2017 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080%2F12259276.2017.1279890 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia2/&gt; In the early 1990s, Liu filmed two important works, 1993's ''[[Chatterbox (1993 film)|Chatterbox]]'', and 1994's ''[[Family Scandal]]'' (co-directed with Cui Xiaoqin). Both films garnered international notice, particularly the former, which won an award at the [[Venice International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; ''Chatterbox'' was a personal work as well, with Liu receiving no salary for the film and borrowing heavily to bring it to an international venue.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;

Liu Miaomiao has also shifted her career into filming [[television]] programs and films.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia2/&gt;

'''Lucio Godina''' (March 8, 1908 – November 24, 1936) and '''Simplicio Godina''' (March 8, 1908 - December 8, 1936) were [[pygopagus]] [[conjoined twins]] from the island of [[Samar (island)|Samar]] in the [[Philippines]].

At the age of 21 they married Natividad and Victorina Matos, who were [[identical twins]]. They performed in various [[sideshow]] acts, including in an orchestra on [[Coney Island]] and in dance with their wives.&lt;ref name="samarTwinsBio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phreeque.com/godina_brothers.html |title=Lucio and Simplicio Godina |work= |accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manuel Machado y Ruiz''' (29 August 1874 in [[Seville]] – 19 January 1947 in [[Madrid]]) was a [[Spanish poetry|Spanish poet]] and a prominent member of the [[Generation of 98]].

Manuel Machado was the son of [[Antonio Machado Álvarez]], known folklorist Seville nicknamed "Demófilo", and Ana Ruiz. His brothers were also a poet Antonio Machado and José Machado.
Inherited his father's love of popular Andalusian character. Born in San Pedro Martir Street No. 20, his childhood was spent in the Palacio de las Dueñas, where his family had rented one of the zones reserved for individuals. When Manuel was 9, the whole family moved to Madrid, because the paternal grandfather had obtained a professorship at the Universidad Central. The desire of all the three brothers was studying in the Free Institution of Teaching, led by [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos]], a great friend of the grandfather Manuel.

The family moved to Madrid, where he developed his studies, culminating with a Bachelor of Arts. Since then, his family returned to Seville in few occasions, but Seville and [[Andalusia]] remained for him a living reference, though distant, for the love of his parents towards their land.

In Madrid, Manuel began to publicize his first poetry and contributed to several literary life in Madrid along with writers like Francis and Juan Ramón Jiménez Villaespesa.

He was co-founder, on February 11, 1933 of the Association of Friends of the [[Soviet Union]].

Over the years, he became director of Madrid's Municipal Library (now the Municipal Historical Library) and Municipal Museum. He created several short-lived literary magazines and worked in daily newspapers in Europe and America.

Contributed strongly to the modernist poetry, understood in its most colorful, decadent, cosmopolitan, giving a hint of Andalusian poetry makes something unique.

It has often been opposed to the modernist side of the 98 Generation.

In 1936-during the civil war, was appointed to a seat in the [[Royal Spanish Academy]].

Brothers Manuel and Antonio wrote together several dramatic works of Andalusian. Manuel's most notable work is ''La Lola se va a los puertos'', filmed twice.

Other dramatic works of Machado were the ''La duquesa de Benamejí'', ''La prima Fernanda'', ''Juan de Mañara'', ''El hombre que murió en la guerra'' and ''Desdichas de la fortuna o Julianillo Valcárcel''.

Although the poetry of both is very different, we can see certain parallels. Thus, both paths composed autobiographical poems ("Adelfos" Manuel, and "Portrait", by Antonio) using Alexandrine verses organized in serventesios. The civil war separated the brothers, placing them on opposite sides.

Upon arrival in Madrid after the [[Spanish coup of July 1936]], Manuel gave the military an encomiastic poetry, "The sword of the Caudillo." This earned him the recognition of the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]]. After the war he returned to his post as director of the Newspaper Library and the Municipal Museum of Madrid, who retired shortly thereafter. He continued to write poetry, mostly [[religious]] in nature. His [[Catholic faith]] was rekindled during your stay in [[Burgos]] thanks to the devotion of his wife and the influence of certain [[priests]], as Bonifacio Zamora. The poet continued to write eulogies to various figures and symbols of [[Francoist Spain]], which earned him the scorn of critics and later poets, who considered him a traitor to the Spanish Second Republic.

On January 19, 1947 died in Madrid. After the poet's death, his widow entered a [[religious order]] dedicated to caring for abandoned and sick children.

Then came the Spanish openness of the 60 and 70, [[Francisco Franco]] gave the youth side to the poets covered by Spain and embraced those who died, or still living-in-exile. Thus, the work and the figure of Manuel Machado were eclipsed by those of Antonio Machado, more akin to the taste of time.

Some of Manuel Machado poems are as famous as these ones:

:'''CANTARES'''

:Vino, sentimiento, guitarra y poesía
:hacen los cantares de la patria mía.
:Quien dice cantares dice Andalucía.
:A la sombra fresca de la vieja parra,
:un mozo moreno rasguea la guitarra...
:Cantares...
:Algo que acaricia y algo que desgarra.

:La prima que canta y el bordón que llora...
:Y el tiempo callado se va hora tras hora.
:Cantares...
:Son dejos fatales de la raza mora.

:No importa la vida, que ya está perdida,
:y, después de todo, ¿qué es eso, la vida?...
:Cantares...
:Cantando la pena, la pena se olvida.

:Madre, pena, suerte, pena, madre, muerte,
:ojos negros, negros, y negra la suerte...
:Cantares...
:En ellos el alma del alma se vierte.

:Cantares. Cantares de la patria mía,
:quien dice cantares dice Andalucía.
:Cantares...
:No tiene más notas la guitarra mía.

:'''CASTILLA'''

:El ciego sol se estrella
:en las duras aristas de las armas,
:llaga de luz los petos y espaldares
:y flamea en las puntas de las lanzas.
:El ciego sol, la sed y la fatiga.
:Por la terrible estepa castellana,
:al destierro, con doce de los suyos
:—polvo, sudor y hierro—, el Cid cabalga.
:Cerrado está el mesón a piedra y lodo.
:Nadie responde. Al pomo de la espada
:y al cuento de las picas el postigo
:va a ceder... ¡Quema el sol, el aire abrasa!
:A los terribles golpes,
:de eco ronco, una voz pura, de plata
:y de cristal responde... Hay una niña
:muy débil y muy blanca
:en el umbral. Es toda
:ojos azules y en los ojos lágrimas.
:Oro pálido nimba
:su carita curiosa y asustada.
:«¡Buen Cid, pasad...! El rey nos dará muerte,
:arruinará la casa,
:y sembrará de sal el pobre campo
:que mi padre trabaja...
:Idos. El cielo os colme de venturas...
:¡En nuestro mal, oh Cid no ganáis nada!»
:Calla la niña y llora sin gemido...
:Un sollozo infantil cruza la escuadra
:de feroces guerreros,
:y una voz inflexible grita «¡En marcha!»
:El ciego sol, la sed y la fatiga.
:Por la terrible estepa castellana,
:al destierro, con doce de los suyos
:—polvo, sudor y hierro—, el Cid cabalga.

'''Rainie Yang''' ({{zh|t=楊丞琳|s=杨丞琳|p=Yáng Chénglín}}; born 4 June 1984) is a [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] singer, actress, and television host.

==Early years==
Yang was born and raised in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], her father was from the [[Shunde District|Shunde]], [[Foshan]], [[Guangdong]], China. She spoke [[Cantonese]] at home. By the time she was 13, she had to start working because her father's business failed, which led to her parents being divorced. She attended Hwakang Arts School in Performance Arts.

==Career==
Yang began her career in 2000 as a member of Taiwanese girl group [[4 in Love (group)|4 in Love]], where she was given the stage name Rainie. The group's popularity in the musical industry achieved limited success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wretch.cc/blog/www77rainie/12067450|title=關於 "Rainie"|accessdate=2009-10-24|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; After they disbanded in 2002, Yang continued to pursue her career in the entertainment industry as a TV host, hosting shows such as the variety show ''[[Guess (variety show)|Guess]]''.

In the same year, she released her debut album, ''[[My Intuition]]'', featured the hit song "Intuition" as the theme song of ''[[Devil Beside You]]'' and "Ideal Lover".

In 2006, she released her second album, ''[[Meeting Love]]''.

After an X-ray examination, doctors diagnosed Yang's injury as a spinal contusion. After leaving the hospital, producer Angie Chai took Yang to a Chinese massage therapist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yangchenglin080423.shtm|title=l Rainie Films and Hurts Spine 杨丞琳拍片 摔伤脊椎]|last=Huang|first=Ailian|date=23 April 2008|work=|publisher=ZaoBao|language=zh|via=|accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Miss No Good]]'', starring Yang and [[Will Pan]], was aired during the fall and winter of 2008 and met with much success.

[[File:Roman.de.renart.2.jpg|thumb|Illumination from a [[manuscript]] of the ''Roman de Renart'', end of the 13th century]]
'''''Reynard the Fox''''' is a [[list of literary cycles|literary cycle]] of medieval [[allegory|allegorical]] [[Folklore of the Low Countries|Dutch]], [[English folklore|English]], [[French folklore|French]] and [[German folklore|German]] [[fable]]s. The first extant versions of the cycle date to the second half of the 12th century. The genre is very popular throughout the [[Late Middle Ages]], and in [[chapbook]] form throughout the [[Early Modern period]].

The stories are largely concerned with the main character Reynard ({{lang-nl|Reinaert}}; {{lang-fr|Renart}}; {{lang-de|Reineke or Reinicke}}; {{lang-la|Renartus}}), an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[red fox]] and [[trickster]] figure. His adventures usually involve him deceiving other anthropomorphic animals for his own advantage or trying to avoid retaliations from them. His main enemy and victim across the cycle is his uncle, the wolf Isengrim (or Ysengrim). 

While the character of Reynard appears in later works, the core stories were written during the Middle Ages by multiple authors and are often seen as parodies of medieval literature such as [[courtly love]] stories and [[chansons de geste]], as well as a satire of political and religious institutions.&lt;ref name="Bianciotto"&gt;Bianciotto, G. (2005). Introduction. In ''Le Roman de Renart''. Paris: Librairie Générale Française (Livre de poche) {{ISBN|978-2-253-08698-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==

The main characters are anthropomorphic animals. The given names of the animals are [[Old High German]] in origin, most of them were in common use as personal names in medieval Lorraine.

*''Reynard the Fox''. The given name ''Reynard'' is from ''Reginhard, Raginohardus'' "strong in counsel". Because of the popularity of the Reynard stories, ''renard'' became the standard French word for "fox", replacing the [[old French]] word for "fox", which was ''[[wikt:goupil|goupil]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:vulpecula|vulpecula]]''.

==In medieval European folklore and literature==
[[File:Fuchs.margin (MMW10F50 f6r) detail.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A studious fox in a monk's [[cowl]], in the margins of a [[Book of hours]], [[Utrecht]], c 1460]]

The figure of Reynard is thought to have originated in [[Lorraine]] [[folklore]] from where it spread to France, the [[Low Countries]], and Germany.&lt;ref name="Longman"&gt;Briggs, Asa (ed.) (1989) ''The Longman Encyclopedia'', Longman, {{ISBN|0-582-91620-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extensive treatment of the character is the [[Old French]] ''Le Roman de Renart'' written by [[Pierre de Saint-Cloud]] around 1170, which sets the typical setting. Reynard has been summoned to the court of king Noble, or Leo, the lion, to answer charges brought against him by Isengrim the wolf. Other [[anthropomorphic]] animals, including Bruin the bear, Baldwin the ass, and Tibert (Tybalt) the cat, all attempt one stratagem or another. The stories typically involve [[satire]] whose usual butts are the [[aristocracy]] and the [[clergy]], making Reynard a peasant-hero character.&lt;ref name="Longman" /&gt; The story of the preaching fox found in the Reynard literature was used in church art by the Catholic Church as propaganda against the [[Lollardy|Lollards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Some of the tales feature Reynard's funeral, where his enemies gather to deliver maudlin [[elegy|elegies]] full of insincere piety, and which feature Reynard's posthumous revenge. Reynard's wife Hermeline appears in the stories, but plays little active role, although in some versions she remarries when Reynard is thought dead, thereby becoming one of the people he plans revenge upon. Isengrim (alternate French spelling: ''Ysengrin'') is Reynard's most frequent antagonist and foil, and generally ends up outwitted, though he occasionally gets revenge.

===''Ysengrimus''===
Reynard appears first in the medieval [[Latin]] poem ''[[Ysengrimus]]'', a long Latin mock-epic written c. 1148–1153 by the poet Nivardus in [[Ghent]], that collects a great store of Reynard's adventures. He also puts in an early appearance in a number of Latin [[sequence (poetry)|sequences]] by the preacher [[Odo of Cheriton]]. Both of these early sources seem to draw on a pre-existing store of [[popular culture]] featuring the character.

=== ''Roman de Renart'' ===
The first "branch" (or chapter) of the ''Roman de Renart'' appears in 1174, written by Pierre de St. Cloud, although in all French editions it is designated as "Branch II". The same author wrote a sequel in 1179&amp;mdash;called "Branch I"&amp;mdash;but from that date onwards, many other French authors composed their own adventures for Renart ''li goupil'' ("the fox"). There is also the text ''Reinhard Fuchs'' by [[Heinrich der Glïchezäre]], dated to {{circa}}1180.

Pierre de St. Cloud opens his work on the fox by situating it within the larger tradition of epic poetry, the [[fabliau]]x and [[Arthurian romance]]:

===''Van den vos Reynaerde''===
{{anchor|Middle Dutch}}
A mid-13th-century [[Middle Dutch]] version of the story by [[Willem die Madoc maecte]] (''[[Van den vos Reynaerde]]'', Of Reynaert the Fox), is also made up of [[rhyme]]d verses (the same [[Rhyme scheme|AA BB scheme]]). Like Pierre, very little is known of the author, other than the description by the copyist in the first sentences:&lt;ref name="rey"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bouwman | first = André | last2 = Besamusca | first2 = Bart | title = Of Reynaert the Fox: Text and Facing Translation of the Middle Dutch Beast Epic Van Den Vos Reynaerde | publisher = Amsterdam University Press | location = Amsterdam | year = 2009 | pages = 42–43 | isbn = 908964024X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

that he had the life looked for&lt;br /&gt;
and, following the [[French language|French]] books,&lt;br /&gt;
he began it in Dutch as follows.&lt;br /&gt;
|}
''Madocke'' or ''Madoc'' is thought to be another one of Willem's works that at one point existed but was lost. The ''Arnout'' mentioned was an earlier Reynard poet whose work Willem (the writer) alleges to have finished. However, there are serious objections to this notion of joint authorship, and the only thing deemed likely is that Arnout was French-speaking ("Walschen" in Middle Dutch referred to northern French-speaking people, specifically the [[Walloons]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gtb.inl.nl/iWDB/search?actie=article&amp;wdb=VMNW&amp;id=ID84113&amp;lemmodern=Waal Lemma = Waal], ''INL''&lt;/ref&gt; Willem's work became one of the standard versions of the legend, and was the foundation for most later adaptations in Dutch, German, and English, including those of [[William Caxton]], [[Goethe]], and [[Frederick Startridge Ellis|F. S. Ellis]].&lt;ref name=rey/&gt;

===Chaucer===
[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] used Reynard material in the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''; in "[[The Nun's Priest's Tale]]", Reynard appears as "Rossel" and an ass as "Brunel".

==Early modern tradition==

In 1481 [[William Caxton]] printed ''The Historie of Reynart the Foxe'', which was translated from ''Van den vos Reynaerde''.&lt;ref name="Longman" /&gt; Also in the 1480s, the Scottish poet [[Robert Henryson]] devised a highly sophisticated development of Reynardian material as part of his ''[[The Morall Fabillis|Morall Fabillis]]'' in the sections known as ''The [[Fable|Talking]] of the [[Fox|Tod]]''. [[Hans van Ghetelen]], a printer of [[Incunabulum|Incunabula]] in [[Lübeck]] printed an early German version called ''Reinke de Vos'' in 1498. It was translated to Latin and other languages, which made the tale popular across Europe. Reynard is also referenced in the [[Middle English]] poem ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' during the third hunt.

[[Tybalt]] in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' is named after the cat in Reynard the Fox (and is called 'Prince of Cats' by [[Mercutio]] in reference to this).
[[Ben Jonson|Jonson's]] play ''[[Volpone]]'' is heavily indebted to Reynard.&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, B. (1999) Brian Parker and David Bevington (eds.), ''Volpone'', Manchester, Manchester University Press pp. 3-6 {{ISBN|978-0-7190-5182-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century ===
''Reinecke Fuchs'' by [[Goethe]] is a poem in hexameters, in twelve parts, written 1793 and first published 1794.
Goethe adapted the Reynard material from the edition by [[Johann Christoph Gottsched]] (1752), based on the 1498 ''Reynke de vos''.

In [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[The Twilight of the Idols]]'', Nietzsche uses Reynard the Fox as an example of a [[dialectician]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J3z2ZJ2XuRkC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=Reynard+intitle:Twilight+intitle:of+intitle:the+intitle:Idols&amp;hl=pt-br&amp;ei=TFFUTbSCBcur8QP84-HuBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Reynard%20intitle%3ATwilight%20intitle%3Aof%20intitle%3Athe%20intitle%3AIdols&amp;f=false Twilight of the Idols], Nietzsche, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th-century literature===
[[File:Reineke 00 ATitel.jpg|thumb|right|Title page from Flinzer's ''Reineke Fuchs'' (Glogau 1881)]]
[[Fedor Flinzer]] illustrated ''Reineke Fuchs'' (''Reynard the Fox'') for children.

===Antisemitic version (1937)===
''Van den vos Reynaerde'' (Of Reynaert the Fox) was an [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] children's story, written by the Dutch-Belgian [[Robert van Genechten]], and named after the Middle Dutch poem. It was first published in 1937 in ''[[Nieuw-Nederland (publication)|Nieuw-Nederland]]'', a monthly publication of the Dutch [[Nazi Party]]'s front, the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|NSB]]. In 1941 it was published as a book.

The story features a [[rhinoceros]] called Jodocus, somewhat akin to the Dutch word [[wiktionary:jood#Dutch|''jood'']] ("[[jew]]"); and a donkey, Boudewijn, who occupies the throne. ''Boudewijn'' was the Dutch name for the contemporary real-world [[Baudouin of Belgium|Belgian crown prince]]. 
In the story, Jodocus is an outsider who comes to the Empire and subsequently introduces new ideas that drastically alter the natural order. The land is then declared a "Republic", where "liberty, equality and fraternity" are to be exercised, presenting a [[dystopia]]n view of a [[socialist republic]]: "There was no one who kept to the rules of the race. Rabbits crept into foxholes, the chickens wanted to build an eyrie." 
Eventually, Reynard and the others trick and kill Jodocus and his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.7/articles/barten1.7.html Reynard the Fox and the Jew Animal] by Egbert Barten and Gerard Groeneveld {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618185846/http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.7/articles/barten1.7.html |date=June 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Van den vos Reynaerde'' was also produced as a cartoon film by [[Nederlandfilm]] in 1943, mostly financed with German money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Animation World Network |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/profiles/reynard-fox-and-jew-animal/page/1%2C1 |title=Reynard the Fox and the Jew Animal |publisher=Awn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
While lavishly budgeted, it was never presented publicly, possibly because most Dutch Jews had already been transported to the [[concentration camp]]s and the film came too late to be useful as a propaganda piece, possibly also because the Dutch collaborationist Department of People's Information, Service and Arts objected to the fact that the fox, an animal traditionally seen as "villainous", should be used as a hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Animation World Network |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/profiles/reynard-fox-and-jew-animal/page/6%2C1 |title=Reynard the Fox and the Jew Animal, page 6 |publisher=Awn.com |date=1996-10-01 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1991, parts of the film were discovered in the German ''Bundesarchiv''. In 2005, more pieces were found, and the film has been restored. The reconstructed film was shown during the 2006 Holland Animation Film Festival in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and during the KLIK! Amsterdam Animation Festival in 2008, in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Animaties over oorlog op filmfestival|url=http://www.brabantsdagblad.nl/laatstenieuws/article753502.ece|publisher=ANP|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In movies and television===
[[Ladislas Starevich]]'s [[1930 in film|1930]] puppet-animated feature film ''[[The Tale of the Fox|Le Roman de Renard]]'' (The Tale of the Fox) featured the Reynard character as the protagonist.
The documentary film ''[[Black Fox: The Rise and Fall of Adolf Hitler|Black Fox]]'' (1962) parallels [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s rise to power with the Reynard fable.

Initially, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] considered a movie about Reynard. However, due to [[Walt Disney]]'s concern that Reynard was an unsuitable choice for a hero, the studio decided to make Reynard the antagonist of a single narrative feature film named ''Chanticleer and Reynard'' (based on [[Edmond Rostand]]'s ''[[Chantecler (play)|Chanticleer]]'') but the production was scrapped in the mid-1960s, in favor of ''[[The Sword in the Stone (film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' (1963). Ken Anderson used the character designs for ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (1973) such as the animal counterparts (e.g. Robin Hood like Reynard is a fox while the Sheriff of Nottingham like Isengrim is a wolf).

In 1985, a French animated series, ''{{ill|Moi Renart|fr}}'' (''I Reynard''), was created that was loosely based on Reynard's tales. In it, the original animals are [[anthropomorphic]] [[humanoid]] animals (to the point that, primary, [[Theriocephaly|only their heads are that of animals]]) and the action occurs in modern [[Paris]] with other anthropomorphic animals in human roles. Reynard is a young mischievous fox with a little monkey pet called Marmouset (an original creation). He sets off into Paris in order to discover the city, get a job and visit his grumpy and stingy uncle, Isengrim, who is a deluxe car salesman, and his reasonable yet dreamy she-wolf aunt, Hersent. Reynard meets Hermeline, a young and charming motorbike-riding [[vixen]] journalist. He immediately falls in love with her and tries to win her heart during several of the episodes. As Reynard establishes himself in Paris, he creates a small company that shares his name which offers to do any job for anyone, from impersonating female maids to opera singers. To help with this, he is a master of disguise and is a bit of a [[kleptomaniac]], which gets him into trouble from police chief Chantecler (a rooster) who often sends cat police inspector Tybalt after him to thwart his plans.

"Le roman de Renart" is a 2005 CGI feature animated film made in Luxembourg in French with an English dub called "Renart The Fox" or "The Adventures of Renny the Fox"

The TV show ''[[The Magicians (U.S. TV series)|The Magicians]]'' includes a character based on Reynard. In this version, he is a violent pagan trickster god accidentally summoned by a group of hedge witches. He ends up killing most of the summoners and taking over the body of their leader.

===In music===
Reynard the Fox is the name of a number of traditional folk songs ([[Roud Folk Song Index|Roud]] 190, 358 and 1868).
* ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' is a one-act chamber opera-ballet by [[Igor Stravinsky]], written in 1916, with text by the composer based on Russian folk tales from the collection by [[Alexander Afanasyev]].

'''Rod Duncan''' (born 1962, Wales) is a British writer. He grew up in [[Aberystwyth]]. He was identified as [[dyslexic]] at the age of eight and made his way through the education system by avoiding writing as far as possible.&lt;ref name="transculturalwriting" /&gt; Duncan went on to study Mining Geology in the [[University of Leicester]], for which he attained a BSc (Hons). He returned to [[Leicester]] to study [[Geology]] and Satellite Imagery for a PhD, but did not complete this. Duncan moved to [[Taiwan]] in 1989, where he established an environmental education development programme on behalf of the [[Baha'i]] community. He returned to [[Leicestershire]] in 1993,&lt;ref name=Backlash&gt;{{cite web|title=Backlash - about the author|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Backlash-Rod-Duncan/dp/0743450191|website=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he lives in [[Glenfield, Leicestershire|Glenfield]] working as an author and lecturer at [[De Montfort University]].&lt;ref name=demontfort /&gt;

Being [[dyslexic]], it was the invention of the [[word processor]] that enabled him to develop his storytelling and writing skills.&lt;ref name="transculturalwriting" /&gt; He now uses dictation software as a tool in the writing process.&lt;ref name=demontfort /&gt;

== Writings ==
His first published novels form the so-called "Riot Trilogy", each of which examine the same riot, on one day in [[Leicester]], from the experience of a different character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazon's author page on Rod Duncan|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rod-Duncan/e/B0034Q02YG/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Backlash'' was shortlisted for the Crime Writers' Association [[CWA New Blood Dagger]] award for the best debut crime novel of 2003.&lt;ref name="transculturalwriting" /&gt;

The books in this series are:
* ''Backlash''
* ''Breakbeat''
* ''Burnout''

As part of the Crime Express series, Duncan wrote the short story, "The Mentalist".

Duncan has since moved into writing [[Steampunk]] novels, and is working on another series - the Fall of the Gas-Lit Empire. The first in the series, ''The Bullet-Catcher's Daughter'', was nominated for the [[Philip K. Dick Award]] for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Philip K. Dick Award Nominees Announced|url=http://www.philipkdickaward.org/2015/01/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set in the "Gas-Lit Empire", a Victorianesque version of [[Leicester]] and [[Lincolnshire]], the events happen in the aftermath of a [[Luddite]] revolution that has reined back technology.&lt;ref name=demontfort /&gt; The novel takes place at a travelling magic show and is themed around illusion, hence the [[bullet catch]] trick in the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The novel twist that puts Leicester at the heart of an author's steampunk world|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/novel-twist-puts-Leicester-heart-author-s-sci-fi/story-26069037-detail/story.html|publisher=Leicester Mercury|date=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Unseemly Science''
* ''The Custodian of Marvels''

Rod Duncan wrote and performed in a Rhys Davies film ''"How to Make a Movie for £43"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to make a movie for £43|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1594903/|publisher=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also performed in [[Zombie Undead]], also by Rhys Davies.

'''Rāhula''' ([[Pāli]] and Sanskrit) was the only son of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhārtha Gautama (commonly known as the Buddha)]]  ({{nowrap|{{circa}} 563 or 480 {{en dash}}}} {{nowrap|483 or 400 BCE}}), and his wife and princess [[Yasodharā|Yaśodharā]]. He is mentioned in numerous Buddhist texts, from the [[Early Buddhist Texts|early period]] onward. Accounts about Rāhula indicate a mutual impact between Prince Siddhārtha's life and those of his family members. According to the [[Pali Canon|Pāli tradition]], Rāhula is born on the day of Prince Siddhārta's [[great renunciation|renunciation]], and is therefore named ''Rāhula'', meaning a fetter on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. According to the [[Mūlasarvāstivāda]] tradition, and numerous other [[post-canonical Buddhist texts|later sources]], however, Rāhula is only ''conceived'' on the day of Prince Siddhārtha, and is born six years later, when Prince Siddhārtha becomes enlightened as the [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]]. This long gestation period is explained by bad [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]] from previous lives of both Yaśodharā and of Rāhula himself, although more [[religious naturalism|naturalistic]] reasons are also given. As a result of the late birth, Yaśodharā needs to prove that Rāhula is really Prince Siddhārtha's son, which she eventually does successfully by an [[sacca-kiriya|act of truth]]. Historian {{ill|Wolfgang Schumann|de|Wolfgang Schumann (Historiker)}} has argued that Prince Siddhārtha conceived Rāhula and waited for his birth, to be able to leave the palace with the king and queen's permission, but Orientalist {{ill|Noël Péri|fr}} considered it more likely that Rāhula was born after Prince Siddhārtha left his palace.

Between seven and fifteen years after Rāhula is born, the Buddha returns to his [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|hometown]], where Yaśodharā has Rāhula ask the Buddha for the throne of the [[Shakya|Śākya]] clan. The Buddha responds by having Rāhula [[pabbajja|ordain]] as the first Buddhist [[samanera|novice monk]]. He teaches the young novice about [[sacca|truth]], self-reflection, and [[anatta|not-self]], eventually leading to Rāhula's enlightenment. Although early accounts state that Rāhula dies before the Buddha does, later tradition has it that Rāhula is one of the disciples that outlives the Buddha, guarding the Buddha's dispensation until the rising of the [[Maitreya|next Buddha]]. Rāhula is known in Buddhist texts for his eagerness for learning, and was honored by novice monks and [[samaneri|nuns]] throughout Buddhist history. His accounts have led to a perspective in Buddhism of seeing children as hindrances to the spiritual life on the one hand, and as people with potential for enlightenment on the other hand.

== Accounts ==
Some early texts such as those of the [[Pali Canon|Pāli tradition]] do not mention Rāhula at all;{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=139}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=113}} but he is mentioned in later Pāli texts such as the [[Apadana|Apadāna]] and the [[atthakatha|commentaries]], as well as in the texts on [[Vinaya|monastic discipline]] of the [[Mūlasarvāstivāda]] and [[Mahasanghika|Mahāsaṇghika]] traditions.{{refn |For the [[Apadana|Apadāna]], see {{harvtxt |Crosby |2013 |page = 105}}. The other information is mentioned in {{harvtxt |Meeks |2016 |p=139}}.}} Earliest texts do not describe Rāhula in much detail, and he remains an ideal figure without much depth in character.{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=109}} Because of the lack of detail, especially after Rāhula's ordination, some scholars have argued Rāhula did not have an important role in Buddhism.{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=136}} Apart from the early texts, there are many [[post-canonical Buddhist texts]] that contain accounts about Rāhula.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=139}} The accounts about Rāhula reveal that when Prince Siddhārtha leaves his palace to become a monk, his decision and subsequent spiritual quest is not just a personal matter, but also affects his family every step during the way, as they respond to and affect the prince on his path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. Thus, the prince's life before enlightenment is about two parallel spiritual lives, that of the Buddha and that of his family.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |pp=122{{en dash}}4}}

=== Birth ===
==== Pāli tradition ====
[[File:Siddhartha leaving sleeping Yashodhara and Rahula Roundel 17 buddha ivory tusk.jpg|thumb|Just before the prince leaves the palace for the spiritual life, he takes one look at his wife Yaśodharā and his just-born child.|alt=Ivory tusk showing a woman and a child sleeping on a bed, and a man standing besides the bed.]]
Rāhula is born on same day Prince [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhārtha Gautama]] renounces the throne by leaving the palace,{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} when the prince is 29 years old,{{sfn |Keown |2004 |page=233}}{{sfn |Irons |2007 |p=400}}{{refn |group=note |According to some traditional sources, the prince is sixteen then.{{sfn |Keown |2004 |p=267}} Furthermore, some sources say that Rāhula is born seven days before Prince Siddhārtha leaves the palace.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/rahulamata.htm Rāhulamātā]}}{{sfn |Sarao |2017 |loc=Biography of the Buddha and Early Buddhism}}}} on the full moon day of the eight [[lunar month]] of the [[Hindu calendar|ancient Indian calendar]].{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} That day, Prince Siddhārtha is preparing himself to leave the palace. The Pāli account claims that when he receives the news of his son's birth he replies "{{IAST|rāhulajāto bandhanaṃ jātaṃ}}", meaning 'A ''rāhu'' is born, a fetter has arisen',{{sfn |Powers |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} that is, an impediment to the search for enlightenment. Accordingly, [[Suddhodana|Śuddhodana]], Prince Siddhārtha's father and king of the [[Shakya|Śākya clan]], names the child ''Rāhula'',{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} because he does not want his son to pursue a spiritual life as a mendicant.{{sfn |Irons |2007 |p=400}} In some versions, Prince Siddhārtha is the one naming his son this way, for being a hindrance on his spiritual path.{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=136}} Just before the prince leaves the palace for the spiritual life, he takes one look at his wife Yaśodharā and his just-born child. Fearing his resolve might waver, Prince Siddhārtha resists to hold his son and leaves the palace as he has planned.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} Rāhula therefore becomes Prince Siddhārtha's first, but also last and only son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Violatti |first1=Cristian |title=Siddhartha Gautama |url=https://www.ancient.eu/Siddhartha_Gautama/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825002210/http://www.ancient.eu:80/Siddhartha_Gautama |archive-date=25 August 2014 |deadurl=no |website=Ancient History Encyclopedia |accessdate=29 October 2018 |date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Powers |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}

==== Other traditions ====
Other texts derive ''rāhu'' differently. For example, the Pāli ''[[Apadana|Apadāna]]'', as well as another account found in the texts of [[vinaya|monastic discipline]] of the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, derive ''rāhu'' from the eclipse of the moon, which traditionally was seen to be caused by the [[asura (Buddhism)|asura]] (demon) [[Rāhu]].{{sfn |Gnoli |1977 |page = 119}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} The ''Apadāna'' states that just like the moon is obstructed from view by Rāhu, Prince Siddhārtha is obstructed by Rāhula's birth.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=105}} The Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition relates, however, that Rāhula is conceived on the evening of the [[great renunciation|renunciation]] of Prince Siddhārtha, and born six years later, on the day that his father achieves enlightenment,{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} which was during a lunar eclipse.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=119}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=105}} Further credence is given to the astrological theory of Rāhula's name by the observation that sons of [[list of Buddhas|previous Buddhas]] are given similar names, related to constellations.{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=136}}

Mūlasarvāstivāda and later Chinese texts such as the ''[[Dharmaguptaka#Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra|Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra]]'' give two types of explanation for the long gestation period.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |pp=139{{en dash}}40}}{{sfn |Sasson |Law |2008 |p=69}} The first type involves the [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]] of Princess Yaśodharā and Rāhula himself.&lt;!--139-40--&gt; According to this interpretation, Yaśodharā has to bear the suffering of carrying a child in her womb for six years, because in a previous life as a cow herder she had refused to help her mother to carry a pail of milk and left it for her mother to carry the extra pail for six [[yojana|leagues]].{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |pp=139{{en dash}}40}}{{sfn |Sasson |Law |2008 |pp=69{{en dash}}70}} As for Rāhula, his karma was that in a previous life as a king he unintentionally had a sage wait for six days.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=140}}{{sfn |Ohnuma |2012 |p=143}} In this life, he was a king and his brother, [[Bodhisattva#Early and Theravāda Buddhism|a previous life of the Buddha]],{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=136}} was a [[rishi|hermit]] who had taken a vow he would only live from what was given by people. One day, the brother broke his vow to take some water, and feeling guilty, asked the king to punish him.{{refn |group=note |In the texts of the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, the brother is another hermit, not the king, but he sends his brother to see the king for punishment.{{sfn |Péri |1918 |p=8}}}} The king refused to issue a punishment for such a trivial matter, but had his brother wait for his final decision and constrained in the royal gardens. After six days, the king suddenly realized he had forgotten about the hermit and immediately set him free, including apologies and gifts. As a result, Rāhula had to wait for six years before being born.{{sfn |Sasson |Law |2008 |p=69}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=117}} In some versions, the king did not allow a sage to enter his kingdom and accumulated the same bad karma of a long gestation period.{{sfn |Shirane |2013 |pp=168{{en dash}}9}} The later Mahāyāna commentary ''[[Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa]]'' ({{zh|t=大智度論|p=Dazhidulun}}) does not blame Yaśodharā's karma for the six years gestation period, but does mention Rāhula's same karma as a king. However, in the 13th-century Japanese devotional text ''Raun Kōshiki'', Rāhula's late birth is seen as evidence of a miracle, rather than a result of karma.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=141}}{{refn |group=note |In the Pāli texts, no long gestation period of Rāhula is mentioned, but a similar motif occurs in the story of Suppāvāsā, with a similar karma in a past life.{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=136}}}}

The second type of explanation consists of the more [[Religious naturalism|naturalistic]] argument that Yaśodharā is practicing [[Asceticism#Buddhism|religious austerities]] involving fasting and sleeping on a straw bed, which causes Rāhula's growth to slow down. She is involved in these practices during the time when Siddhārtha is practicing self-mortification. Later, King Śuddhodana prevents Yaśodharā from hearing any news of her former husband, and she gradually becomes healthier, as the pregnancy continues normally. However, some time later, the false rumor spreads that the former prince has died of his ascetism.&lt;!--118--&gt; Yaśodharā becomes very desperate and depressed, endangering her own pregnancy. When the news reaches the palace that Siddhārtha has attained enlightenment, Yaśodharā is overjoyed and gives birth to Rāhula. Buddhist Studies scholar [[John S. Strong]] notes that this account draws a parallel between the quest for enlightenment and Yaśodharā's path to being a mother, and eventually, they both are accomplished at the same time.&lt;!--119--&gt;{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=140}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |pp=118{{en dash}}9}}
[[File:Rāhula seeing the Buddha.png|thumb|The Buddha returning home following his enlightenment, being greeted by Rāhula. The Buddha is represented by his footprints and throne. [[Amaravati|Amarāvatī]], 3rd century. [[National Museum, New Delhi]]. |alt=Stone relief with throne at the center and numerous figures surrounding the throne, including a mother and her child ]]
The late childbirth leads to doubts in the Śākya clan as to who is the father, as told in the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, in the ''Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa'' and in the later Chinese ''Zabaozang jing'' ({{zh|t=雜寶藏經}}).{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=139}} Since Rāhula's birth was not regarded by Buddhists to be a virginal or miraculous birth, tradition had to explain that Prince Siddhārtha was actually the father.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=119}} Yaśodharā responds by putting her child on a stone in a pond of water and making an [[sacca-kiriya|act of truth]] that if Rāhula is really her child, that he and the stone may not sink, but rather float back-and-forth. After she makes the declaration, the child floats according to her vow.{{sfn |Ohnuma |2012 |p=142}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=120}} Strong notes that this is a symbolic parallel with the attainment of enlightenment by the Buddha, described as the "further shore", and coming back to teach humankind.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=140}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=120}} The ''Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa'' contains another account, in which Prince Siddhārtha has several wives,&lt;!--140--&gt; and a wife other than Yaśodharā is the one defending her, being witness of her innocence.&lt;!--141--&gt;{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |pp=139{{en dash}}41}}

Furthermore, in both the Mūlasarvāstivāda texts and the ''Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa'', there is a third account that proves Yaśodharā's innocence: the Buddha makes everyone around him look identical to him, through a [[ṛddhi|supernatural accomplishment]]. Rāhula proves that the Buddha is his true father when he manages to approach the real Buddha straight away.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=120}}{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pp=32{{en dash}}3}}{{refn |group=note |Yaśodharā had Rāhula present a gift to his real father, and he manages to find him straight away. In one version of the story the gift is a ring signet,{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pp=32{{en dash}}3}} in another version it is an aphrodisiac.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=120}}(''See [[Rāhula#Ordination|§ Ordination]], below.'')}} In a fourth story about proving Yaśodhara's purity, appearing in Chinese [[Avadana|Avadāna]]-style texts from the 5th century CE onward, she is burnt alive, but miraculously survives. In this account, King Śuddhodana orders that she be killed by burning her alive as punishment for her alleged impurity. Instead of being hurt by the flames, however, she performs an act of truth and the fire transforms into a pond of water. Śuddhodana welcomes her and her son back into the clan, and later becomes very fond of Rāhula.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=142}} Some Chinese [[Jataka|Jātakas]] say that he recognizes his son Siddhārtha in the child, and manages to better cope with the loss of Prince Siddhārtha.{{sfn |Péri |1918 |p=22}} Religion scholar Reiko Ohnuma sees the fire ordeal as a metaphor that parallels the Buddha's enlightenment, a similar argument that Strong makes.{{sfn |Ohnuma |2012 |p=142}}

==== Historical analysis ====
Historian {{ill|Wolfgang Schumann|de|Wolfgang Schumann (Historiker)}} hypothesized that Prince Siddhārtha conceived Rāhula to please his parents, obtain their permission for leaving the palace and becoming a mendicant. He further speculated that the prince only conceived a son thirteen years after his marriage, because Yaśodharā initially did not want to bear a child, for fear that the prince would leave the palace and the throne as soon as the child was conceived.{{sfn |Schumann |2004 |p=46}} Orientalist and missionary {{ill |Noël Péri |fr}} believed that a late gestation period was more historically probable than the birth on the same day as in the Pāli tradition. She believed that if Prince Siddhārtha had left an heir to the throne, there would have been no sound reason for him to leave secretly at night. She further argued that there are many sources that try to explain the long gestation period, indicating an established tradition.{{sfn |Péri |1918 |pp=34{{en dash}}5}}

Besides historical speculations, Buddhist Studies scholar Kate Crosby argues that Prince Siddhārtha conceiving or giving birth to a son before his renunciation functions as a motif to prove that he is the best at each possible path in life: after having tried the life of a father to the fullest, he decides to leave it behind for a better alternative.&lt;!--108--&gt; In [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist]] India, being a father and bearing a son was seen as a spiritual and religious path as well as that of renouncing one's family, and Prince Siddhārtha's bringing a son in the world before renunciation proves he is capable of both.&lt;!--108-9--&gt;{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |pp=108{{en dash}}9}}

=== Ordination ===
[[File:Indian Museum Sculpture - Ordination of Rahula, Jamalgarhi (9220605766).jpg|thumb |Ordination of Rāhula, [[Indian Museum]], [[Kolkata]] |alt=Relief with child depicted at the center, and numerous figures at the sides, including the Buddha |upright=1.8]]
The accounts continue and describe that Rāhula is raised by his mother Yaśodharā and grandfather King Śuddhodana.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} When Rāhula is seven,{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} nine{{sfn |Meeks|2016 |p=136}}{{sfn |Schumann |2004 |p=123}} or fifteen{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=110}} years old, the Buddha returns to his home city of [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]] at the request of Śuddhodana.{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} The [[Mahavastu|Mahāvastu]] text from the [[Lokottaravāda]] tradition states that the royals try to prevent Rāhula from learning about the return of his father, but eventually he insists to know who the "Great Ascetic" about to arrive is, and he is told&lt;!--133-4--&gt;{{em dash}}indologist Bhikkhu Telwatte Rahula {{sic}} argues that the child was conscious of being without father.&lt;!--134--&gt;{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |pp=133{{en dash}}4}} Next, the Mahāvastu and the Mūlasarvāstivāda texts relate that Yaśodharā tries to tempt the Buddha back into his life as a prince by having Rāhula offer the Buddha an [[aphrodisiac]].{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=121}}{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=134}} Mūlasarvāstivāda texts continue and tell that her plan backfires when the Buddha has Rāhula eat it himself, and Rāhula therefore becomes enamored by his father and wishes to follow him.{{sfn |Ohnuma |2012 |p=145}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=121}} In the Pāli version of the story, on the seventh day of the Buddha's return, Yaśodharā takes Rāhula to see his father, the Buddha. She tells Rāhula that since his father has renounced the palace life and as he is the next royal prince in line, he should ask his father for his inheritance of crown and treasure, for his future sake when his grandfather will no longer rule the kingdom.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=134}} After the Buddha has had a meal, Rāhula follows the Buddha, asking him for his inheritance.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} The Buddha does not try to prevent Rāhula from following him,{{sfn |Penner |2009 |p=68}} but in some versions of the story, some women from the court do try to, yet Rāhula persists.{{sfn |Péri |1918 |p=5}} He then looks at his father and says, "Pleasant is your shadow, [[shramana|recluse]]".{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}} Reaching the [[Nigrodharama|Park of Nigrodha]], where the Buddha is staying,{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}} the Buddha considers that the heritage of the throne will one day perish, and is tied up with suffering and stress: "I will give him the wealth I obtained under the [[Bodhi tree|tree of enlightenment]] thus making him the heir of an inheritance that does not perish."{{sfn |Penner |2009 |p=68}}

Most traditions relate that the Buddha then calls [[Sariputta|Śāriputra]] and asks him to ordain Rāhula. Rāhula ordains and is the first [[Samanera|''śrāmaṇera'']] (novice monk),{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} and probably the first person in the [[sangha|monastic order]] to [[pabbajja|ordain in a formal way]].{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=83}} In some versions of the story, such as the 9th century Chinese ''Weicengyou Yinyuan Jing'' ({{zh|t=未曾有因緣經}}), a group of young boys ordain together with him.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=143}}{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pp=34{{en dash}}5}} The king discovers that now his grandson, [[Nanda (half-brother of Buddha)|his son Nanda]] and a number of other young men in the royal family have ordained and left the palace. Seeing his daughter grieve, he asks the Buddha that from now on, he only ordain people with the consent of his parents.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}{{sfn |Keown |2004 |p=281}} Śuddhodana explains that Rāhula's ordination was a great shock to him. The Buddha assents to the proposal.{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}} This rule is later expanded in the case of women ordaining, as both parents and the husband have to give permission first to allow women to join the order of monks and nuns.{{sfn |Schumann |2004 |p=163}} In some versions of the story of Rāhula's ordination, Yaśodharā also protests, but relents in the end.{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |p=34}} The Mahāvastu states, however, that Rāhula asks to ordain himself, and is eventually granted permission by Yaśodharā and Śuddhodana.{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=134}}

Archaeologist Maurizio Taddei has noted that in many [[Gandhara]]n art depictions, Rāhula's life is linked to that of a previous life of the Buddha, the hermit [[Sumedho (Buddhist figure)|Sumedho]]. The Buddha giving his spiritual heritage to his son is compared to that of Sumedho allowing the [[Dipankara|Buddha Dīpaṃkara]] to walk over him, which is followed by Dipaṃkara predicting that Sumedho will become a [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]] in a future life.&lt;!--119--&gt; Both the figure of Gautama Buddha giving his inheritance to his son, and the figure of Dīpaṃkara Buddha giving his inheritance of [[Buddhahood]] to Sumedho are depicted with flames emitting from their bodies; both scenes are depictions of inheritance, [[filial piety|filial]] and disciple piety; both may have been considered by 5th-century Buddhists to be representations of "eager youth".&lt;!--120--&gt;{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |pp=119{{en dash}}20}}

According to the Pāli texts, once Rāhula has become novice, the Buddha teaches Rāhula regularly.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} His instructions are very age-specific, using vivid metaphors&lt;!--113--&gt; and simple explanations.&lt;!--115--&gt;{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |pp=113, 115}} The Buddha's teachings have led to numerous [[sūtra|discourses]] being named after Rāhula in the [[Early Buddhist Texts]].{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} Pāli texts relate how Rāhula grows up to become a novice that is diligent,&lt;!--Nakagawa--&gt; dutiful, amenable and eager for learning,&lt;!--Malalasekera--&gt;{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}{{sfn |Nakagawa |2005 |p=34}} but there are also some early medieval Chinese and Japanese accounts which relate that Rāhula initially struggles with being a novice and only later appreciates the Buddha's teaching.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=143}} Besides the Buddha, Śāriputra and [[Maudgalyayana|Maugalyayāna]] also help to teach Rāhula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |author2=Stefon, Matt |title=Shariputra {{en dash}} Disciple of the Buddha |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Shariputra |website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] |accessdate=30 October 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181114220448/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Shariputra |archive-date=14 November 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Nakagawa |2005 |p=34}} Rāhula often assists Śāriputra on his rounds for [[alms (Buddhism)|alms]] in the morning, and sometimes on other travels.{{refn |Both {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} and {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} mention the alms, but only {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} mentions the other travels.}} Every morning, Rāhula wakes up and throws a handful of sand in the air, making the wish that he may be counselled by good teachers as much as those grains of sand.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}}

Still in the same year as Rāhula's ordination, the Buddha teaches his son the importance of telling the truth in a discourse known as the ''Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta''.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} In this discourse, the Buddha teaches and encourages consistent self-reflection, to help let go of all evil actions that lead to harm to oneself and others, and to develop self-control and a moral life.{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}}{{sfn |Schlieter |2014 |p=319}} He encourages reflection before, during and after one's actions,{{sfn |Schlieter |2014 |p=319}} and explains that lying makes the spiritual life void and empty,{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}} leading to many other evils.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/am/ambalatthika_raahulovaada_s.htm Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta]}}

When Rāhula becomes eighteen years old, the Buddha instructs Rāhula in a [[Kammaṭṭhāna|meditation technique]] to counter the desires that hinder him during his tours for alms. Rāhula has grown enamored with his own and his father's handsome appearance. To help Rāhula, the Buddha teaches another discourse to him. He tells Rāhula that all [[rūpa|matter]] is [[anatta|not-self]], and the same holds for the [[skandhas|different parts of one's mental experience]].{{refn |For the part on alms rounds, see {{harvtxt|Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}}. For the part about not-self, see {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} and {{harvtxt|Crosby |2013 |p=115}}.}} Having heard the discourse, Rāhula starts to practice meditation. His teacher Śāriputra recommends him to practice [[anapanasati|breathing meditation]],{{sfn |Shaw |2006 |pp=189{{en dash}}93}} but is unable to give Rāhula the instructions he needs.{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=110}} Rāhula therefore asks the Buddha to explain the meditation method in more detail and the Buddha responds by describing several meditation techniques to him.{{sfn |Shaw |2006 |pp=189{{en dash}}93}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=115}} On a similar note, the Buddha teaches Rāhula at a place called Andhavana about the [[anicca|impermanence]] of all things, and instructs him how to overcome the [[asava|"taints"]] inside the mind. As a result, Rāhula attains enlightenment.{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |pp=482{{en dash}}3}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=116}} Pāli tradition has it that the sermon is also attended by a [[crore]] of [[deva (Buddhism)|heavenly beings]], who once had vowed to witness the enlightenment of the son of the Buddha. Rāhula obtains the name "Rāhula the Lucky" ({{lang-pi|Rāhula-bhadda|italic=no |link=no}}; {{lang-sa|Rāhula-bhadra|link=no}}), which he himself explains is because of being the son of the Buddha, and because of having attained enlightenment.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} and {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}. For the Sanskrit translation, see {{harvtxt |Burnouf |2010 |p=489}}.}}
[[File:Bodh Gaya - Buddha Statue - Rahula (9224949643).jpg|thumb |Statue of Rāhula, [[Bihar]], India. |alt=Statue of monk with one shoulder uncovered |upright=.7 |left]]
Later, the Buddha declares that Rāhula is [[etatagga|foremost]] among all disciples in eagerness in learning ({{lang-pi|sikkhākamānaṃ|italic=yes |link=no}}).{{sfn |Powers |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} and in the Pāli [[Udana|Udāna]], the Buddha includes him as one of eleven particularly praiseworthy disciples.{{sfn |Sarao |2004 |p=720}} Chinese sources add that he is also known for his [[khanti|patience]], and that he is foremost in 'practicing with discretion' ({{zh|p=mixing diyi}}), meaning practicing the Buddha's teaching consistently, dedication to the [[śila|precepts]] and study, but without seeking praise or being proud because of being the son of the Buddha.{{refn |For the aspect of dedication to the [[śila|precepts]] and to study, as well as avoiding being proud, see {{harvtxt |Irons |2007 |p=163}}; for the aspect of seeking praise, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}.}} Pāli texts give examples of Rāhula's strictness in monastic discipline. E.g. after there was a rule established that no novice could sleep in the same room as a [[bhikkhu|fully ordained monk]], Rāhula is said to have slept in an outdoor toilet.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}} When the Buddha becomes aware of this, he admonishes the monks for not taking proper care of the novices. After that, the Buddha adjusts the rule.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/t/tipallatthamiga_jat_16.htm Tipallatthamiga Jātaka (No.16)]}}

Pāli texts state that despite Rāhula being his son, the Buddha did not particularly favor him: he is said to have loved problematic disciples such as [[Aṅgulimāla]] and [[Devadatta]] as much as his own son, without any bias.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}

Later in Rāhula's life his mother Yaśodharā becomes ordained as a [[bhikkhuni|nun]]. In one story, the nun Yaśodharā falls ill with [[flatulence]]. Rāhula helps her recover by asking his teacher Śāriputra to find sweetened mango juice for her, which is the medicine she is used to and requires. Therefore, with Rāhula's help, she eventually recovers.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/rahulamata.htm Rāhulamātā]}} and {{harvtxt |Crosby |2013 |p=112}}. Only Malalasekera mentions the mango juice and the recovery.}}

When he is 20 years old, Rāhula [[upasampada|fully ordains]] as a monk in [[Savatthi|Sāvatthī]].{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Baroni |2002 |p=261}} and {{harvtxt |Schumann |2004 |p=123}}. For the information that he was fully ordained in Sāvatthī, see {{harvtxt |Sarao |2013 |p=157}}.}}

Rāhula's death receives little attention in the earliest sources.{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=106}} Rāhula dies before the Buddha and his teacher Śariputra do. According to Pāli{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} and Chinese{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} sources, this happens as he is travelling through the [[Tavatimsa|second Buddhist heaven]] ({{lang-sa|Trāyastriṃśa|link=no}}). According to the early ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara Āgama]]'' ([[Sarvastivada|Sārvastivāda]] or Mahāsaṅghika tradition) and the later ''Śāriputrapṛcchā'', however, Rāhula is one the four [[arhat|enlightened disciples]] whom Gautama Buddha asks to prolong their lives to stay in the world until the [[Maitreya|next Buddha Maitreya]] has risen, to protect the current Buddha's dispensation.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=121}}

=== Previous lives ===
Following the Pāli and Sanskrit language sources, Rāhula is the son of the [[Bodhisattva#Early and Theravāda Buddhism|Buddha-to-be]] throughout many lifetimes.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} He develops his habit of being amenable and easy to teach in previous lives.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}} Pāli texts explain that in a previous life he was impressed by the son of a previous Buddha, and vowed to be like him in a future life.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}

== Legacy ==
[[File:Rahula - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Rāhula on a Tibetan painting, 16th century |alt=Elderly monk in green and red robes, holding his hands in front of his chest.]]
Texts in the [[Mahayana|Mahayāna]] tradition describe that Rāhula is the eleventh of the [[16 arhats|16 Elders]] ({{lang-sa|Ṣoḍaśasthavira|italic=yes}}; Chinese tradition added two elders in the 10th century, making for 18 Elders{{sfn |Dong |2010 |p=33}}), enlightened disciples that have been entrusted with taking care of the Buddha's dispensation until the rising of Maitreya Buddha. Tradition states therefore that Rāhula is still alive, and resides with 1,100 of his pupils in an island called the 'land of chestnuts and grains' ({{zh|t=畢利颺瞿洲|p=Biliyangqu zhou}}).{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} and {{harvtxt |Meeks |2016 |pp=137{{en dash}}8}}. For the number of 18, see {{harvtxt |Irons |2007 |p=400}}; {{harvtxt|Strong |1997 |pp=121{{en dash}}22}}. For the information that ''Biliyangqu zhou'' is an island, see {{harvtxt |Dong |2010 |p=59 n.11}}.}} The pilgrim [[Xuan Zang]] ({{circa}}602{{en dash}}664) heard a [[brahmin]] claim that he met Rāhula as an old man, who had delayed his passing into [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]] and was therefore still alive.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=146}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=122}} On a similar note, Rāhula is considered one of the [[Ten Principal Disciples]],{{sfn |Keown |2004 |p=298}} known for his dedication to training new monks and novices.{{sfn |Baroni |2002 |p=262}} Moreover, he is considered to be one of the 23{{en dash}}28 masters in the lineage of the [[Tiantai]] tradition, one of the 28 in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] lineage,{{refn |{{harvtxt |Welter |2004 |pp=462{{en dash}}3}} says [[Tiantai]] has only 23 patriarchs, whereas {{harvtxt |Irons |2007 |p=526}} states they later expanded to 28.}} and one of the [[eight arahants (Burma)|eight enlightened disciples]] in the Burmese tradition.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=122}}

As one of the enlightened disciples responsible for protecting the Buddha's dispensation, Rāhula has often been depicted in East Asian art. He is depicted with a large, "umbrella-shaped" head, prominent eyes and a hooked nose.{{sfn |Watters |1898 |p=340}}

The Chinese monks Xuan Zang and [[Faxian]] ({{circa}}320{{en dash}}420 CE) noted during their pilgrimages in India that a cult existed that worshiped Rāhula, especially in the [[Madhura]] area. Whereas monks would worship certain early male disciples following their particular specialization, and nuns would honor [[Ānanda]] in gratitude for helping to set up the nun's order, novices would worship Rāhula.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |pp=135{{en dash}}6}} The two Chinese pilgrims noted that Emperor [[Ashoka|Aśoka]] built a [[stupa|monument]] in honor of Rāhula, especially meant for novices to pay their respects.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} Religious studies scholar Lori Meeks points out with regard to Japan, however, that Rāhula was not the individual object of any devotional cult, but was rather honored as part of a group of enlightened disciples, such as the 16 Elders.&lt;!--132--&gt; Exception to this was the 13th{{en dash}}14th century, when the figure of Rāhula became an important part of a revival of devotion to early Buddhist disciples among the old [[Nara prefecture|Nara]] schools,&lt;!--131--&gt; as [[kōshiki|chanted lectures]] (''kōshiki'') rites,&lt;!--137--&gt; and images&lt;!--147--&gt; were used in dedication to Rāhula. On regular [[uposatha|days of religious observance]],&lt;!--137--&gt; male&lt;!--133--&gt; and [[samaneri|female]]&lt;!--134--&gt; novices performed rites and gave lectures in honor of Rāhula. These were popular with the laypeople,&lt;!--133--&gt; as well as with priests that aimed to revive early Buddhist [[vinaya|monastic discipline]].&lt;!--134--&gt;{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |pp=131{{en dash}}3, 147}} In the ''kōshiki'' Rāhula was praised extensively, and was described as the "Eldest Child", ''eldest'' being a devotional term, since Prince Siddhārtha had no other children.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=137, n.2}}

The ''[[Lotus Sutra|Lotus Sūtra]]'', as well as later East Asian texts such as the ''Raun Kōshiki'', relate that Gautama Buddha predicts Rāhula will become a [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]] in a future life,{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} named "Stepping on Seven Treasure Flowers" ({{lang-sa|Saptaratnapadmavikrama |link=no}}). In these texts, Rāhula was seen as a [[Bodhisattva#In_Mahāyāna_Buddhism|Mahāyāna type of Buddha-to-be]], who would save many [[sentient being (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] and live in a [[Pure Land]].{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=144}}

The exhortations the Buddha gives to Rāhula have also become part of his legacy. The ''Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta'' became one of the seven Buddhist texts recommended for study in the [[Edicts of Ashoka|inscriptions]] of the Emperor Aśoka.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/am/ambalatthika_raahulovaada_s.htm Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta]}}{{sfn |Hazzra |1995 |p=38}} This discourse has been raised by modern ethicists as evidence for [[consequentalism|consequentalist]] ethics in Buddhism, though this is disputed.{{sfn |Schlieter |2014 |p=319}}

Rāhula is mentioned as one of the founders of a system of Buddhist philosophy called the ''[[Vaibhāṣika]]'', which was part of the Sarvāstivāda schools.{{sfn |Burnouf |2010 |p=418}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=107}} He is also considered by some Thai schools of Buddhist [[Tantric Theravada|''boran'']] meditation to be the patron of their tradition, which is explained by referring to Rāhula's gradual development in meditation as opposed to the instant enlightenment of [[disciples of the Buddha|other disciples]].{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=121}}

=== Childhood in Buddhism ===
[[File:Novices_studying_Dhamma_and_Pali_language.jpg |The acceptance of Rāhula in the monastic order as a child set a precedent, which later developed into a widespread Buddhist tradition of educating children in monasteries.|thumb |alt=Teenage novices studying in class. |upright=1.2]]
From the narratives surrounding Rāhula several conclusions have been drawn with regard to Buddhist perspectives on childhood. Several scholars have raised Rāhula's example to indicate that children in Buddhism are seen as an obstacle to spiritual enlightenment,{{sfn |Thompson |Mauk |Kelly |Cook |2012 |p=61}} or that Buddhism, being a monastic religion, is not interested in children.{{sfn |Sasson |2014 |pp=594{{en dash}}5}} Education scholar Yoshiharu Nakagawa argues, however, that Rāhula's story points at two ideals of childhood which exist parallel in Buddhism: that of the common child, subject to the [[human condition]], and that of the child with a potential for enlightenment, who Crosby describes as a heroic disciple.{{sfn |Nakagawa |2005 |p=41}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |pp=119, 121}} Religion scholar Vanessa Sasson notes that although Prince Siddhārtha initially abandons his son, he comes back for him and offers a spiritual heritage to him as opposed to a material one. This heritage is given from a viewpoint of trust in the potential of the child Rāhula, presuming that the Buddhist path can also be accessed by children.{{sfn |Sasson |2014 |p=595}}

The acceptance of Rāhula in the monastic order as a child set a precedent, which later developed into a widespread Buddhist tradition of educating children in monasteries.{{sfn |Nakagawa |2005 |pp=34{{en dash}}5}} The numerous teachings given to Rāhula have left behind teaching material which could be used for teaching children of different ages,&lt;!--117--&gt; and were sophisticated for the time period.&lt;!--118--&gt; [[Theravada|Theravāda]] tradition further built on this genre, with Pāli manuals of religious teaching for novices.&lt;!--117--&gt;{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |pp=117{{en dash}}8}}

The '''Scavenger''' is the name of two [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]]s with no known connections with each other. The first Scavenger was Peter Mortimer, an Aquaman villain who debuted in ''[[Aquaman]]'' vol. 2 #37 (January 1968), and was created by [[Henry Boltinoff]] and [[Nick Cardy]]. He is re-introduced in the New 52 series ''Aquaman'' by writer [[Geoff Johns]] and artist [[Paul Pelletier]].&lt;ref&gt;''Aquaman'' vol.7 #15&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Scavenger first appeared in ''[[Superboy (comic book)|Superboy]]'' #2 (March 1994), and was created by [[Karl Kesel]] and [[Tom Grummett]].

==Fictional character biography==

===Peter Mortimer===
In his first appearance, the first Scavenger was looking for something called the Time Decelerator. When he finds it, it apparently de-ages him to nothing. In his next appearance, while battling Aquaman for the second time, he explains that the Time Decelerator simply sent him into a timeless, [[limbo]]-like dimension.&lt;ref&gt;''Aquaman'' #59&lt;/ref&gt; The Scavenger then resurfaces in the otherdimensional world of [[Skartaris]], where he gains mystical powers, becoming the Scavenger of Souls and battling Travis Morgan, known as the [[Warlord (comics)|Warlord]]. He apparently loses these mystical powers and returned to his own world sometime later.

In his next appearance, the Scavenger is shown to have reformed, also becoming a friend of Aquaman's.&lt;ref&gt;''Aquaman'' volume 4 #13 (December 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; However, a later encounter with [[Hawkman]] [[retcon]]ned his redemption, stating that Peter Mortimer was secretly part of a [[pedophile]] ring who videotaped himself [[rape|raping]] young boys and girls. Moreover, he now calls himself Barracuda and explains that he was the avatar of the [[barracuda]], just as [[Katar Hol|Hawkman]] is the avatar of the hawk. After Barracuda attempts to kill both Aquaman and Hawkman, Hawkman kills him.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkman'' volume 3 #15 (December 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, after the events of [[Throne of Atlantis]], Mortimer begins scouring the ocean floor with the help of his minions for all Atlantean technology and weaponry, then sells them off to the highest bidder. He, along with villains such as the Weapons Master, the Key, the Scarecrow, Captain Cold, and the Cheetah were all attacked, captured, tortured, and interrogated by the villain David Graves who intended to acquire information on the members of the Justice League.

Mortimer was among the villains recruited by the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] during the events of the [[Forever Evil]] story arc, and was later captured along with several other members of the [[Secret Society of Supervillains|Secret Society]] by the reformed Justice League in the aftermath of the Crime Syndicate's defeat.

===Second Scavenger===
The second Scavenger first appeared in ''[[Superboy (comic book)|Superboy]]'' #2. He is an old man, with a wide range of weaponry at his disposal. Little of the man's history has been revealed, except once during Superboy and the Ravers he mentioned he was one of the men who originally were the Argonauts and challenged the gods, which led to his dilemmas later in life. He believes he is being persecuted by an enemy from his past, and stockpiles weapons and gadgets to be ready when the enemy strikes. The identity of the nemesis has never been revealed and only made one appearance near the end of Superboy's series in which the enemy's identity was never revealed; Scavenger suffers severe [[paranoia]], and believes anyone who tries to stop him is working for his nemesis. He later joins the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] headed by [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Alexander Luthor]]. Scavenger and other villains, including [[Red Panzer]], are sent to [[Gotham City]], where they go on a murderous attack against law enforcement officers.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gotham Central]]'' #37 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Scavenger somehow survives to the 30th century (at least in the post-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] version of future history), where he fights Superboy and the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. By that time he has acquired the equipment of various 20th century superheroes.

==Other versions==
===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, the second Scavenger is a member of [[Deathstroke]]'s pirates after being broken out of a floating prison by Deathstroke.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Deathstroke and the Curse of the Ravager'' #1 (June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; During an ambush by [[Aquaman]] and [[Ocean Master]], Scavenger opens fire at Aquaman with a gun blaster, but Aquaman dodges, causing the blast to hit his shipmate, [[Tattooed Man]]. Aquaman then snaps Scavenger's body in two by breaking his back over his knee.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Deathstroke and the Curse of the Ravager'' #2 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===
* In the ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' animated series, the Scavengers are a gang of technology thieves introduced in the episode "Legacy", and subsequently hired by Alexis Luthor. They make further appearances in "Sundown" Pt. 2 and "In the Beginning".   
* The Scavengers gang make an appearance in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Siege of Starro" Part 1. Batman and Booster Gold fight against them in the 31st century before returning to the present. They are seen being carried by Police Science through the Booster portal.
* The ''Flashpoint'' version of Scavenger appears in ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11219">'''Shawn Carpenter''' is an [[United States Navy|American Navy]] veteran and [[whistleblower]] (previously employed by [[Sandia National Laboratories]]) who tracked down a Chinese [[cyberespionage]] ring that is code-named [[Titan Rain]] by the FBI. He came to national attention when his story was reported on in the September 5, 2005 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.

Carpenter was an employee of Sandia National Laboratories, investigating security breaches in its networks. However, upon tracking several breaches of Sandia, [[Lockheed Martin Corporation]], [[Redstone Arsenal]], and even [[NASA]], dating back to 2003, Carpenter noticed patterns that began to appear to link the attacks to a single group. He was impressed by the meticulous, voracious and incredibly fast manner (sometimes completed in less than 30 minutes) in which the hackers operated. Such observations led him to alert the federal government of his findings.

The Titan Rain hacking operation was first reported in an August 25, 2005'' [[Washington Post]]'' article by [[Bradley Graham]], which didn't mention Carpenter. Graham listed anonymous governmental officials as his sources.

After informing his supervisors of the breaches, he was told that his only concern should be Sandia computers, and to drop the issue.  His employment was later terminated when Carpenter disobeyed his management and communicated the information about the security breaches first to [[United States Army]] Cyber Counterintelligence Special Agents, who verified his information and later brought in the [[FBI]].  The FBI requested a Senior DAC Counterintelligence agent known in the counterintelligence community by the nickname "Doc" to handle Carpenter and lead the operation on behalf of the FBI.  Carpenter was a confidential informant for the FBI for almost half a year before Sandia discovered his actions. Carpenter reportedly felt betrayed by the termination, as he viewed his actions were a service to his country, similar to that of his previous military service.

According to Carpenter, during his termination hearing at Sandia, Bruce Held, Sandia's chief of counterintelligence, yelled "''[you're] lucky you have such understanding management... if you worked for me, I would decapitate you! There would at least be blood all over the office!''"&lt;ref name="computerworld.com"&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9011832&amp;pageNumber=3  Q&amp;A: Reverse hacker describes ordeal (Computerworld)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310035822/http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9011832&amp;pageNumber=3 |date=2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the subsequent court case, Held testified that he did use the word "decapitate" and, while he did not recall using the word "blood," would not contest it. He also apologized.&lt;ref name="computerworld.com"/&gt;

Carpenter sued Sandia National Laboratories for wrongful termination and defamation; a jury awarded him almost $4.7 million in compensatory and punitive damages on February 13, 2007.  The jury more than doubled the punitive damages requested by Carpenter's attorneys [[Thad Guyer]], Stephani Ayers and Philip Davis. The 13-person New Mexico state district court jury determined that Sandia's handling of Shawn Carpenter's termination was "malicious, willful, reckless, wanton, fraudulent or in bad faith." Juror Ed Dzienis said that, "If they (Sandia) have an interest in protecting us, they certainly didn't show it with the way they handled Shawn."  Ms. Alex Scott, the jury forewoman, said jurors were upset by the lack of documentation of the process and by the "reckless behavior on the part of Sandia to not have adequate policies in place for employees about hacking, and the cavalier attitude about national security and global security."

Carpenter's wife, Dr. Jennifer Jacobs, testified at the trial. Dr. Jacobs, a former Sandia scientist, nuclear engineer, [[West Point]] graduate, and Army Reserve Major, said Sandia management questioned her loyalty to the company after her husband was fired. Dr. Jacobs left Sandia and was later appointed as a [[White House Fellow]], and was a director at the [[United States National Security Council]]. In an interview with the ''Albuquerque Journal'', Dr. Jacobs stated, "The point for us all along was this is bad for the country to have contractors like Sandia Corporation behaving this way -- with impunity. And if other citizens don't do this, it's the beginning of the end for our country.  That's what we kept coming back to: This is what we have to do, because it's what we expect of others."

Sandia Corporation, the private entity that manages Sandia National Laboratories on behalf of the [[National Nuclear Security Administration]], the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and [[Federal Government of the United States]], is a wholly owned subsidiary of the for-profit Lockheed Martin Corporation.

In an ironic twist, Carpenter testified at trial that he found hundreds of pages of detailed schematics and other sensitive documents labeled, "Lockheed Martin Proprietary Information" and "Export Controlled" regarding the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] stashed on a foreign server in South Korea. He was helping the FBI investigate the stolen [[Lockheed Martin]] information along with hundreds of other network breaches at military and United States defense contractors when Sandia officials fired him.

{{As of|2007|March}}, Carpenter is employed at NetWitness Corporation, a startup headed by [[Amit Yoran]], former director of the [[National Cyber Security Division]] within the [[United States]] [[Department of Homeland Security]].

In March 2007, Sandia National Laboratories retained three additional attorneys at the international corporate defense firm of [[Baker Botts]]. In post-trial motions, Sandia attorneys unsuccessfully argued to throw out the jury verdict, to reduce the judgment to zero, and for a new trial. Carpenter's attorneys successfully argued a motion for post-judgment interest and Sandia was ordered to pay an interest rate of 15% per year on the final judgment of $4,742,146.66 (plus attorney fees) during the appeals process.

In April 2007, Sandia attorneys filed a motion to appeal the jury verdict. Sandia National Laboratories posted a $5.8 million [[supersedeas bond]] to prevent Carpenter from seizing Sandia assets during the appeals process. Interest in the amount of almost $60,000 a month accumulates while Sandia pursues their appeals. According to news reports, Sandia plans to appeal to the [[New Mexico Supreme Court]], if necessary, which could take years.

On October 14, 2007, ''The Albuquerque Journal'' published a story ("Analyst, Sandia Settle Suit") that stated that Sandia had dropped its appeal of the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abqjournal.com/news/metro/602547metro10-14-07.htm Analyst, Sandia Settle Suit (Albuquerque Journal)]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the story, the judgment had been accumulating 15 percent interest since the verdict in his favor in February 2007. The piece also related that Carpenter continues to work in the national security area for clients in the intelligence community, federal agencies and the military.

'''Thomas John Ley''' (28 October 1880{{spaced ndash}}29 July 1947) was an Australian politician who was convicted of murder in England. It is highly likely that he was also involved in the deaths of a number of people in Australia.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{cite web

==Early life==
Ley was born in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England, but his father died in 1882 and his mother brought him and three siblings to Australia in 1886. He attended Crown Street Public School in Sydney until he was ten; then he worked as an assistant in his mother's grocery store.  Having learnt shorthand, he became a junior clerk-stenographer in a solicitor's office at 14.  He married Emily Louisa (known as "Lewie") Vernon in 1898, the year she came to Australia from England.  Both husband and wife were active in politics, she in the international [[suffrage]] movement, and he as a state ([[New South Wales]]) and federal politician from 1917 to 1928.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

== State politics ==
Ley served in the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|lower house]] of the New South Wales parliament (1917–25) as member for [[electoral district of Hurstville|Hurstville]] from 1917 to 1920, representing the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]], and [[electoral district of St George|St George]] from 1920 to 1925, representing the [[Progressive Party (1920)|Progressive Party]] from 1920 to 1922.&lt;ref name=nsw&gt;{{cite web

As a teetotaller, Ley acquired the nickname ''Lemonade Ley'', but the [[temperance movement]] accused him of betrayal when he supported legislation which eased requirements for the sale of alcohol. It later emerged that he was being paid by the brewery lobby. Despite this, he was appointed as New South Wales Minister for Justice from 1922 to 1925 — in the cabinet of Premier [[George Fuller (Australian politician)|Sir George Fuller]] — and gained a reputation for harsh decisions.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

Shortly after he became Minister for Justice, Ley made an official visit to Western Australia and there was introduced to Maggie Evelyn Brook, a magistrate's wife. Shortly afterwards the magistrate died; Ley acted for her and her daughter in various financial and legal matters.&lt;ref name='Lustgarten'&gt;{{cite book | last = Lustgarten | first = Edgar | authorlink = Edgar Lustgarten | title = The Chalk Pit Murder | publisher=Hart-Davis, MacGibbon | year = 1974 | location = London | pages = 10–11 | url = | id = | isbn = 978-0-246-64061-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Federal politician ==
In 1925, Ley stood for the seat of [[Division of Barton|Barton]] in the federal House of Representatives. He unsuccessfully tried to bribe his [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]] opponent, [[Frederick McDonald]], with a £2,000 share in a property at [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]] in return for withdrawing from the ballot.  McDonald instead publicly revealed the attempted bribe.  Despite this, Ley won the election on a large swing as part of the decisive [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] victory that year. 

Conventional wisdom would have suggested that Ley, as a former senior member of the New South Wales government, would have been considered for a post in the federal cabinet. However, Ley's fellow conservatives, above all Prime Minister [[Stanley Bruce]], began to have doubts about him after the election. As a result, Ley was not considered for ministerial preferment.

McDonald took the matter of the bribe to court, but disappeared in mysterious circumstances. The case against Ley collapsed for lack of evidence when McDonald failed to appear. McDonald's disappearance may have been a coincidence. But in 1927, [[Hyman Goldstein (politician)|Hyman Goldstein]] (himself the state member for [[Electoral district of Coogee|Coogee]], and another of Ley's public critics) was found dead after apparently falling from "Suicide Point" on the cliffs of [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee]]. Then a group of businessmen, concerned at Ley's reputation for dubious business dealings ([[SOS Prickly Pear Poisons Ltd]] being one of the more infamous), appointed Keith Greedor, an opponent of Ley but formerly an associate of his, to investigate. Travelling to [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] by boat, Greedor fell overboard and drowned.&lt;ref name=nla/&gt;

== Return to England ==
After his defeat in the 1928 election, Ley returned to England with Maggie Brook, his mistress of several years, leaving his wife in Australia.

Little is recorded of Ley's life during the 1930s. About all that can be said for certain is that he used his move to England to start afresh in dubious business ventures, and during World War II he was arrested and convicted for [[black market]]eering.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

==The Chalk-pit Murder==
In 1946 Maggie Brook was living in Wimbledon, and Ley had his house at 5 Beaufort Gardens, London, converted into [[apartments|flats]]. Ley imagined (wrongly) that Brook and a barman called John McMain Mudie were lovers. Ley persuaded two of his labourers that Mudie was a blackmailer, and together they tortured and killed him. The case became known as the "Chalk-pit Murder" because Mudie's body was dumped in a Surrey chalk-pit.

With Lawrence John Smith, Ley was tried at the Old Bailey, and both were sentenced to death in March 1947. However, both Smith and Ley escaped the noose: Smith's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, while Ley was declared insane and sent to [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane]]. There he died soon after of a [[cerebral haemorrhage]]. He is said to have been the wealthiest person ever to be a Broadmoor prisoner.&lt;ref name="Jesse"&gt;{{cite book | title = Famous Trials | volume = 4 | last1 = Jesse | first1 = F. Tennyson | contribution = Ley and Smith | editor1-last = Hodge | editor1-first = James H. | publisher=Penguin Books | year = 1954 | page = 109 | quote = Ley is supposed to have been the richest prisoner ever sent to the Criminal Lunatic Asylum. | authorlink = F. Tennyson Jesse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ley's wife had followed him to England in 1942. From Broadmoor, Ley wrote letters and poems and protested his innocence to his wife and children. After his death, Lewie Ley returned to Australia; she died at [[Bowral, New South Wales]], in 1956.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

'''Tracey Freeman''' (born 1948) is an Australian Paralympic athlete who won ten medals at two Paralympics.

==Personal==
Freeman became a quadriplegic due to [[polio]] at the age of two in 1951, while living in the Queensland city of [[Mount Isa]]. She went to the Crippled Children's Centre in the Sydney suburb of [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]] until the age of 15, when she moved to the Mt Wilga Rehabilitation Centre. She developed a passion for sports competition, having been introduced to archery, field events and swimming during her rehabilitation. She then moved with her family back to Queensland and spent time at the Kingsholm Rehabilitation Centre in [[Brisbane]].&lt;ref name="step"&gt;{{cite book|title=Step by Step We Conquer|publisher=Keeaira Press|isbn=0958529191|first=Vicki|last=Epstein|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; She married shortly before the [[1972 Summer Paralympics|1972 Heidelberg Paralympics]].&lt;ref name="step"/&gt;

==Career==
Freeman's first national competition was the National Wheelchair Games in Sydney, where she won all the events she entered; she broke Australian records in discus, javelin, shot put and the 60&amp;nbsp;m sprint, and won a gold medal in table tennis.&lt;ref name="step"/&gt; She was therefore selected for a place in the Australian team at the 1972 Heidelberg Paralympics, where she won three gold medals and broke world records in the Women's Discus 1B, Women's Javelin 1B, and Women's Shot Put 1B events, and two silver medals in the Women's 60&amp;nbsp;m Wheelchair 1B and Women's Slalom 1B events.&lt;ref name="step"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/ipc_results/search.php?sport=all&amp;games=all&amp;medal=all&amp;npc=all&amp;name=Freeman&amp;fname=T.&amp;gender=all|title=Athlete Search Results|publisher=[[International Paralympic Committee]]|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was the most successful athlete at the games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsa.org.au/life_site/text/sport/index.html|title=The history of people with disabilities in Australia – 100 years: Sport|publisher=Disability Services Australia|accessdate=28 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v93Y0MPX?url=http://www.dsa.org.au/life_site/text/sport/index.html|archivedate=21 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first Australian woman to win a gold medal at a Paralympic athletics competition,&lt;ref name="wheelies"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://assets.clubsonline.com.au/assets/console/document/documents/110903-QLDUnderageAWDChamps-ResultsBook.pdf|title=2011 Queensland Underage AWD Athletics Championships: Results Booklet|publisher=[[Sporting Wheelies and Disabled Association]]|date=3 September 2011|accessdate=28 February 2012|format=PDF}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of Australia's first high-profile Paralympic competitors.&lt;ref name="step"/&gt;

She defended her national titles in athletics events at the 1973 National Wheelchair Games in [[Adelaide]] and won a gold medal in the wheelchair slalom.&lt;ref name="step"/&gt; She broke games records at the [[1974 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games]] in [[Dunedin]] and won gold medals in the discus and shot put and silver medals in the 60&amp;nbsp;m and slalom at the first [[FESPIC Games]] in Japan the following year.&lt;ref name="step"/&gt; At the [[1976 Summer Paralympics|1976 Toronto Games]], she won three gold medals and three world records in the Women's 60&amp;nbsp;m 1C, Women's Javelin 1C, and Women's Shot Put 1C events, and two silver medals in the Women's Discus 1C and Women's Slalom 1C events.&lt;ref name="IPC"/&gt; She hoped to participate in the [[1980 Summer Paralympics|1980 Arnhem Paralympics]] but a car accident just before the games forced her to withdraw from the competition.&lt;ref name="step"/&gt; She made a comeback in the early 1990s, when she once again won medals in national competitions and set Australian records, before retiring in 1996.&lt;ref name="step"/&gt;

==Recognition==
In 1976, Freeman became the first athlete with a disability to win ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'' Sportswoman of the Year award.&lt;ref name="wheelies"/&gt; In 2000, she received an [[Australian Sports Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=977709&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true|title=Freeman, Tracey|publisher=It's an Honour|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sporting Wheelies and Disabled Association]]'s Tracey Freeman Athlete of the Meet award is named after her.&lt;ref name="wheelies"/&gt; In December 2016, Freeman was inducted into the [[Australian Paralympic Committee awards#Australian Paralympic Hall of Fame|Australian Paralympic Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walsh|first1=Scott|title=Dylan Alcott wins double at Australian Paralympic Awards|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/olympics-2016/dylan-alcott-wins-double-at-australian-paralympic-awards/news-story/ee02e262ebc0ea1cfcf0e7ca58c06392|date=8 December 2016|work=The Courier-Mail|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2120">'''Urbain Johnson''' (January 27, 1824 &amp;ndash; April 1917) was a farmer and political figure in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[New Brunswick]]. He represented [[Kent County, New Brunswick|Kent County]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]] from 1869 to 1870, from 1874 to 1882 and from 1895 to 1908 as a [[Liberal Party of New Brunswick|Liberal]] member.

He was born and educated at [[Saint-Louis-de-Kent, New Brunswick]], the son of Simon Johnson and Geneviève Vautour. Johnson was a descendant of [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrants who had first settled among the [[Acadian]]s in the [[Chaleur Bay]] area. In 1856, he married Nathalie Leblanc.

Johnson was first elected to the Legislative Assembly in an 1869 by-election held after [[Owen McInerney]] was named to the Legislative Council. Johnson was defeated in the general election which followed in 1870. He opposed the [[Common Schools Act of 1871|Common Schools Act]] which banned [[religious]] instruction in the province's school system based on the principle of [[Separation of church and state]]. He attended the convention of the [[Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste]] convention in [[Quebec City]] in 1880 and the Acadian national convention in 1881, where he suggested that the Acadians choose a different holiday and symbols from those chosen by other [[French Canadians]]. He also was a [[justice of the peace]] and an officer in the local militia. Johnson retired from politics in 1908.

The '''widowhood effect''' is the increase in the probability of a person dying a relatively short time  after their long-time [[spouse]] has died. The pattern indicates a sharp increase in risk of death for the widower, particularly but not exclusively, in the three months closest thereafter the death of the spouse. This process of losing a spouse and dying shortly after has also been called "dying of a [[broken heart]]". Becoming a widow is often a very detrimental and life changing time in a spouse's life, that forces them to go through changes that they may not have anticipated to make for a significant amount of time. Responses of grief and bereavement due to the loss of a spouse increases vulnerability to psychological and physical illnesses (Ramadas &amp; Kuttichira, 2013).

Psychologically, losing a long-term spouse can cause symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and feelings of guilt. Physical illness may also occur as the body becomes more vulnerable to emotional and environmental stressors. There are many factors that may be affected when one becomes a widow. A widow (or widower if referring to a male who lost a spouse) tends to have a decline in health regulation. Higher prevalence in mortality rates are noted among bereaved spouses during the first six months of bereavement compared to the last six months of bereavement.  The most crucial are said to be the first three months during grief processing.  Grieving spouses are more vulnerable during these few months not only health wise but socially and physically.  During this early period of bereavement spouses tend to have less interest in their health as well as physical appearance caring less about continuing with medications or adapting healthy behaviors such as eating healthy or exercising.  Also, they are likelier to practice risky behaviors and commit suicide.  Men on the other hand, are more likely to look for social support such as friends, family, or support groups regarding the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, P. J., Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011). Does Widowhood Increase Mortality Risk? Epidemiology, 22(1), 1-5. doi:10.1097/ede.0b013e3181fdcc0b&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect appears to be far more prevalent in older married couples than in younger married couples. As a result, studies that have been conducted in regards to this phenomenon since the early 2000s have revolved primarily around observations of older widows. Through the many studies that have been conducted over the years, it has been found that the widowhood effect affects the mortality rates of people with varying levels of severity depending on their genders and religions.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}}It is far more frequent in more seasoned, long-term, elder couples than in recently married couples. Since the topic has only been recently studied within this last decade, and due to the prevalence of older couples being affected, most widows in similar studies are typically over the age of 50&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-widowhood-effect-idUSBRE9AD0VU20131114|title='Widowhood effect' strongest during first three months|date=2016-11-14|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Jegtvig, 2013).

Although there have not been many studies, the phenomenon is one of the best documented examples of the effect of social relations on health. Through the numerous studies that have been directed throughout the years, it has been found that the widowhood impact influences the death rates of individuals with changing levels of stringencies relying upon their sexual orientations and religions. There are many theories as to what causes this to occur. There are many factors and theories about the widowhood effect, but in general, a study on a large population sample has suggested rates of death nearly double during the first three months after loss of a spouse, and quickly taper thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moon|first=J.

==Gender differences==

Both men and women respond differently to the death of their spouse. In general, men tend to be more vulnerable to the widowhood effect. Men are affected more socially than women.  Women tend to maintain social relationships and friendships outside of marriage, so when the wife dies first, men tend to lose out on these social relationships and support groups and they tend to isolate themselves. Women maintain their friendships and relationships and lean on them for support after their spouse dies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2136854 Widowhood and Depression: Explaining Long-Term Gender Differences in Vulnerability.] ''Journal of Health and Social Behavior.'' (1992). Retrieved on 2016-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of peer-reviewed articles suggest that it is indeed women that are more frequently at risk of succumbing to the widowhood effect. A collaborative study by Gary R. Lee et al. (2001) surveyed 1686 married and widowed people age 65 or older using data from 1988 [[National Survey of Families and Households]]. The study took into account the psychological well-being of each person on a [[Center for Epidemiologic Studies]]— Depression scale (CES-D), and found that women were further depressed by the loss of their spouse than men were. Women were also more likely to die soon after the death of their spouse compared to men. The researchers hypothesized that this was because older married women had a higher baseline happiness than their spouses, so they had more happiness to lose. Women in this study were also less likely to be avid church goers, despised chores, and were not as adept at helping their adult children. The lack of social behavior and general activity may contribute to the widowhood effect's influence on female mortality.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"&gt;{{cite web |date=April 18, 2016 |title=Is Broken Heart Syndrome Difficult? |url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/Cardiomyopathy/Is-Broken-Heart-Syndrome-Difficult_UCM_448547_Article.jsp |location=Dallas |publisher=American Heart Association |access-date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lee|DeMaris|Bavin|Sullivan|2001}}

Experimenters involved in the study regarding: ''The effects of widowhood on physical and mental health, health behaviors, and health outcomes'', took a deeper look into the overall health differences between recent widowers and those who are currently involved in a marriage (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Mental health alterations include those of depression and socially extracting yourself were the most common for women who have become widowed in the past year or so (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Although some of these women were shown to extract them selves from social settings, the study also supported an alternate hypothesis that women experiencing the effects of widowhood are less likely to engage coping mechanisms such as support groups, fellow widowers, and overall strong support systems such as close friends and family (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003).

In a study done by Stahl and Shultz, they found that the death of a woman’s spouse affected her physical activity (2014). Women’s physical activity increases immediately following the death of a spouse, and the authors note that this may perhaps be a coping mechanism to alleviate depressive symptoms (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). In the year following the death of a spouse, women are more likely to experience a fluctuation in physical activity during the transition into widowhood, if they did not die (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). Women in the youngest age group of this study (55– 65 years) were at the highest risk of mortality after the death of their spouse (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Elwert and Christakis found that within the first month of bereavement after widowhood morality is largest and doesn’t decline sharply until the sixth month of widowhood for females, compared to only the third month for males (2006).

Nicholas A. Christakis of Harvard and Felix Elwert of the University of Wisconsin analyzed 9 years’ worth of data gathered from almost 373,189 elderly married couples in the U.S. Their findings showed an 18 percent increase in “all-cause mortality” for women whose husbands died first; for men, the risk is 16 percent (Elwert 2008). Although the percentage of females was higher than males, it is not a significant difference to state that women are more affected than men. It is hard to say whether males or females suffer from the widowhood effect more, however it is clear that it is higher in couples that are older.

&lt;ref&gt;In conclusion to this, other research that has been conducted has gathered similar statistics regarding widowhood effect between genders. A comparable study taken place in the U.S found that “The death of a husband is associated with a greater rate in all-cause mortality for women, and the death of a wife is associated with a lesser rate in all-cause mortality for men, after adjusting for covariates (Elwert, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health effects of widowhood==
The death of a spouse can have a major impact on a person’s mental health. Each individual may respond to their spouse’s death differently. After the death of a spouse many widows begin to take more prescription medications for mental health issues (Avis, Brambilla, Vass, &amp; Mckinlay, 1991). The mental health effects of men and women also differ. Women become more depressed in widowhood compared to men because women may not have as strong of a support group. Married women also report a higher rate of happiness in their marriage and the death of their spouse could drastically alter this happiness. Men may have an easier time adapting to widowhood and be more willing to seek mental help while women tend to be less social and did not like to do chores, go to church, or help their children. Men and women both show greater rates of depression after the death of a spouse but the rates of depression in women tends to be higher than in men (Lee, DeMaris, &amp; Sullivan, 2001).

==Takotsubo and the widowhood effect==

Recently, there has been a phenomenon discussed and researched dubbed the takotsubo condition, also referred to as the [[broken heart syndrome]] (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Takotsubo has been discussed in contexts surrounding great physical and emotional stress, such as circumstance in which someone has been widowed, and emotional stress has long been associated with myocardial infarction. In their research, Brenn and Ytterstad saw an increase in death of women 55–64 years old due to heart disease in the first week of widowhood than married women 55–64 years old (2016). Although takotsubo is not considered to be the direct cause of death at this time, it is an observed phenomenon (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016.)

==Effects of widowhood on social life==

Elderly widows experience changes in their social lives prior to and following the deaths of their spouses. A study conducted by Rebecca L. Utz et al. (2002) revealed that elderly persons experiencing widowhood spent more time with family and friends than nonwidowed counterparts, based on the lifestyle changes that occur in elderly couples. Although widowed subjects were more likely to socialize with family and friends, they were no more likely to visit church or volunteer than the intact couples. This study also found that healthy spouses were reclusive while their significant other was on their deathbed, but due to a network of family and friends; the surviving spouse entered society being more social than had been prior to the death of their husband or wife. Elderly widows were more or less involved socially depending on the amount of support they had from family and friends.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}} It has been noted that widows who have a close and supportive social network can counteract the effects of widowhood by remaining active in their social group. The loss of a spouse affects almost every domain of life, and as a consequence has a significant impact on wellbeing: psychological, social, physical, practical, and economic (Bennett, 2012). With all of these aspects of a widowed individuals being affected maintaining a sense of normality is important to help avoid depression like symptoms. Social support, as well as creating new lasting relationships through social interaction can help the process of bereavement go smoother for widow effected individuals.

==Urban, rural and race variations==

A study conducted by Rosato, O’Reilly and Wright (2015) revealed that there is a significant difference in urban-rural variation in the social environment as well as in health outcomes. There is evidence that social support from family and friends have better health outcomes on mortality rates. Investigations showed that the race of the partner influences widowhood effect; whites in endogamous marriages had greater mortality risks that were not obvious among blacks, which the authors concluded was due to a high level of family support for elderly among black families versuswhite families. Moreover, the study also found differences in urban and rural areas around the world. They found that elderly married couples in the US suffered significant mortality risks compared to those in Ireland where older people living in more rural areas receive more social support from their families, and they live with their children, while in the US elderly people live in care homes. As a result, mortality rates are greater in urban areas and less in rural areas.

In a study done by Elwert and Christakis, they found that there was no widowhood effect found in endogamously married black men or women (2016). Deducing this finding, they proposed that this might be because blacks are able to extend their marital survival advantage into widowhood. This is likely because blacks are prone to have kin nearer to help take care of them, they may be more self-sufficient than their white counterparts, and there is greater religious participation in blacks that may help them with spiritual comfort (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2016). Whites were found to have “a large and enduring widowhood effect” because there is no reparation to make up for the survival advantages that marriage gave them, even if they have been widowed for years (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2008).

The widowhood effect appears to have a higher impact in rural and intermediate areas compared to urban areas. One factor may be that there are greater distances to primary care services in rural areas, and this increases mortality due to discouraged health checkups (Wright, 2015). It is known that the size of family and social network coincides with physical functioning; the bigger the social group one belongs to the better they can physically function. Residential areas near green areas are associated with an increase in physical activity and lowered mortality (Wright, 2015). Researchers measured peak flow to show the increases or decreases in physical functioning, and the results suggest that married subjects have a higher peak flow compared to those divorced or widowed (Clouston, 2014).

==Possible causes==

It was suggested that the widowhood effect was a mere coincidence resulting from the selection of mates with similar health risk. In a recent study by Paul J. Boyle, Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011), it was concluded that the increased [[mortality rate]] of widows is caused by the death of their spouse. Researchers in the study used data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study to compare the ratios of death in widowed males and females. The male and female subjects were categorized into different groups dependent on the manner in which their spouse died. The results provided evidence that suggest a causal relationship between mortality rate and widowhood.{{sfn|Boyle|Feng|Raab|2011}}

In April 2016, the [[American Heart Association]] published an article regarding phenomenon referred to as "broken heart syndrome". This particular syndrome seems to occur when a person experiences an overwhelming amount of stress in their life in a short period of time. The cases mentioned involved both positive events like winning the lottery as well as negative events like experiencing the death of a spouse. Though broken heart syndrome has been misdiagnosed as a heart attack, the differences between the two phenomena are clear. Heart attacks are the result of a blockage of arteries, but broken heart syndrome is the result of a hormone induced enlargement of a portion of the heart. The enlarged region of the heart is less effective in regards to pumping blood, and the normal sized regions of the heart are forced to work harder as a result.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"/&gt;


== Widowhood Effect Solution == 
	Widowhood effect is important to be aware of because of the affects that it can have on the body; mentally, physically, emotionally. Although there is no correct coping mechanism when losing a partner, it is important to find preventative ways to fight this from occurring because of the depressive symptoms and state of mental health that are a result from a partner passing away. Being aware of widowhood effect and acknowledging the feelings, such as grieving over that individual can be a way of coping with their current situation. Individuals that result to safe methods with grieving such as counseling or finding different hobbies can decrease their chances of experiencing widowhood effect. 


== Coping Mechanisms ==
There is no universally accepted “proper” method or way to grieve or adjust to life after loss; it varies among individuals, influenced by their cultural and social practices, personality, and the circumstances surrounding the death. Even though grief processing varies, there are ways to reduce the effects of widowhood. Since a spouse is often one’s primary source of social interactions, maintaining and establishing social bonds is a crucial aspect in determining the outcome of a widowed individual’s bereavement (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Social participation may be utilized “as an active coping strategy” as discovered in a study by Rebecca Utz and colleagues (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Additionally, the loss of a spouse means the loss of a partner; the loss of a supportive presence with whom responsibility was shared amongst one another. Studies have shown that for couples who followed traditional gender roles, adjustment to life after their loss was often more difficult than for couples who did not (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Undertaking the responsibilities previously considered the ‘job’ of one’s deceased partner is often hard to handle on top of processing the loss; therefore, the utilization of organizations built to support and help widowed individuals may also prove to be helpful in reducing grief. The Widowed Persons Service (WPS) and their parent organization, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), are two organizations which provide aid specifically to widowed individuals (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Effective and safe methods of grief processing are important for all individuals dealing with loss; however, the utilization of organizations may prove to be beneficial for those who need a little more help.

'''William Cronk Elmore''' (September 16, 1909 - January 23, 2003) was an American [[physicist]], educator, and author who is best known for his work on and related to the Manhattan project during [[World War II]] and as a professor of Physics at [[Swarthmore College]], PA from 1938 to 1974. Bill Elmore authored two influential books during his life, ''Electronics-Experimental Techniques''&lt;ref name="ELMORE-SANDS"/&gt; with [[Matthew Sands]] and the ''Physics of Waves''&lt;ref name="ELMORE-HEALD"/&gt; with Mark Heald. He is also known for deriving a simple approximation for the delay through an [[RC network]], known as the [[Elmore delay]].&lt;ref name="Elmore"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
William Cronk Elmore was born in [[Montour Falls, New York]] to Thaddeus Perceval Elmore and Grace Cronk Elmore. Elmore had two sisters, Mary Elmore (b. 1902, d. 1907) and Eleanor Elmore (b. 1912, d. 2010). As a young man, Bill spent many of his days outside with his boy scout troop, experimenting with electronics and other technology, and building crystal radios. He attended Cook Academy in [[Montour Falls, New York]] and was the valedictorian upon his graduation in 1928. He earned a B.Sc. in Engineering Physics from [[Lehigh University]] (Phi Beta Kappa) in 1932 and a Ph.D. from Yale in 1935. Elmore began his career as a physics instructor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] from 1935 to 1938. In 1936, Elmore married Barbara Page, the daughter of the [[Yale University]] physics professor, [[Leigh Page]]. Bill and Barbara were married for the next 66 years.&lt;ref name="ELMOREOBIT"/&gt; They had 4 children, Mary-Leigh (b. 1939), David (b. 1945), Elizabeth (b. 1947, d. 2015), and Page (b. 1959).

==World War II==

Elmore was recruited to work on the [[Manhattan Project]] at Los Alamos in 1943.&lt;ref name="ElmoreBadge"/&gt; He played a major role in developing electronic circuits to handle the fast-pulse signals needed in the development of the atomic bomb.&lt;ref name="ElmoreAHF"/&gt; He also developed the electronics used to measure the strength of the first atomic test at [[Trinity test]] in [[New Mexico]]. At Trinity on July 16, 1945, Elmore observed the blast from the closest position of any observer, laying on a rubber mat beside [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] behind a temporary wall of lead bricks and holding a piece of welding glass in front of his eyes. War era letters Barbara Page wrote to her mother and other family members detail the daily life of Elmore and his family while living in Los Alamos with the other Manhattan Project scientists, such as [[Enrico Fermi]].&lt;ref name="ElmoreLetters"/&gt;

In 1946, Elmore and Matthew Sands wrote ''Electronics: Experimental Techniques'', which was published in 1949 by McGraw-Hill as part of the National Nuclear Energy Series.&lt;ref name="ELMORE-SANDS"/&gt; This book covered pre-transistor electronics including advances developed by the United States' war-time Atomic Energy Program, and became a standard reference for post-war instrumentation, influencing a generation of science and engineering students in the 1950s.

In 1957, Elmore returned to Los Alamos to work with the controlled fusion group. He was a delegate to the second Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva.&lt;ref name="ELMOREOBIT"/&gt;

==Swarthmore College==

In 1938, Elmore joined Swarthmore’s physics faculty, retiring in 1974. He served as department chair from 1948 to 1968. Despite his clear potential for advancing theoretical and experimental physics, at Swarthmore, Elmore was known for developing (and publishing&lt;ref name="ELMOREPHYS"/&gt;) laboratory experiments that effectively taught students the fundamentals of physics.&lt;ref name="ELMOREOBIT"/&gt;  Elmore and Heald co-wrote the 1969 textbook Physics of Waves.&lt;ref name="ELMORE-HEALD"/&gt; In 1965, Elmore received a Distinguished Service Citation from the [[American Association of Physics Teachers]] and was elected a fellow of the [[American Physical Society]].
