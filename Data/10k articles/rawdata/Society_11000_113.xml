In the '''2017 [[Chomutov]] incident''', a 37-year-old man believed that a vehicular rampage was taking place in front of his home and in an effort to stop it, he shot the 34 year old driver dead. The subsequent investigation and court case attracted significant public attention mainly due to issues related to the limits of legitimate self-defense and [[defensive gun use]] in the [[Czech Republic]].

== Background ==

In months and years preceding the incident, Europe has seen a number of vehicular terror attacks against pedestrians ([[2014 Dijon attack|2014 Dijon]], [[2014 Nantes attack|2014 Nantes]], [[2016 Nice attack|2016 Nice]], [[2016 Berlin attack|2016 Berlin]], [[2017 Westminster attack|2017 Westminster]], [[2017 Stockholm attack|2017 Stockholm]]). While no similar terror attack had taken place directly in the Czech Republic, the 1973 vehicular rampage perpetrated by [[Olga Hepnarová]] remains to this day the largest mass murder in the country (with 20 victims, of them 8 fatal).

The Czech Republic issues [[concealed carry]] permits, in which private firearm possession is seen as one way to provide public safety, especially when it comes to soft target protection at the time of increased terror risk. There are 240,000 civilians licensed to carry concealed firearms. However, it is unknown how many of them actually regularly do so. Following a wave of terror attacks around Europe, a number of politicians as well as security professionals started urging gun owners to actually carry firearms in order to be able to contribute to [[soft target]]s protection. These included, among many others, President [[Miloš Zeman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blesk.cz/clanek/zpravy-politika/410026/ivana-zemanova-uz-ma-revolver-prezident-vyzval-cechy-ke-zbrojeni-proti-teroru.html|title=Ivana Zemanová už má revolver. Prezident vyzval Čechy ke zbrojení proti teroru [Ivana Zeman obtained a revolver. President calls Czechs to arm themselves against terrorism]|publisher=Blesk.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Libor Lochman, Chief of [[Útvar rychlého nasazení|URNA]], the country's main special forces anti-terrorism unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/branit-se-strelnou-brani-lide-by-meli-mit-tu-moznost-nemuzem/r~cbe51888322511e6a3e5002590604f2e/|title=Šéf URNA: Nemůžeme být všude.

People are not sheep, they shall have the ability to defend themselves with firearms.]|publisher=aktualne.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Czech courts had previously ruled that a car constitutes a weapon in case it is intentionally used against a person, even when driven slowly and with no injuries caused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/ceska-ekonomika/soud-auto-je-zbran-i-kdyz-jede-jenom-pomalu-a-nezrani/r~i:article:769808/?redirected=1523954772|title=Soud: Auto je zbraň, i když jede jenom pomalu a nezraní [Court: car is a weapon even when driven slowly and with no injuries caused]|publisher=aktualne.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Czech law, a firearm may be used for self-defense in case that its use is not "manifestly disproportionate to the manner of attack".

==Night of the incident==
The initial police report describes the incident that took place at 3 AM on 27 May 2017 as follows: "A man (b. 1980) heard a loud noise from the street in the night, and from his window situated in a block of appartments he saw a van that was crashing into parked cars and driving into people assembled on the pathwalk in front of the house. He immediately took his legally owned firearm and went outside, where he opened fire towards the van that was passing by his side. The driver (born 1983) was hit by several bullets and suffered serious injuries that proved fatal. The suspect awaited arrival of police and admitted to the shooting." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policie.cz/clanek/strelba-v-chomutove-aktualizace.aspx|title=Střelba v Chomutově [Chomutov shooting]|publisher=Police of the Czech Republic|language=Czech|accessdate=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media reported that one woman had her leg run over by the driver, while several parked cars were damaged.&lt;ref name="potize"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zpravy.idnes.cz/utok-chomutov-sidliste-0vx-/domaci.aspx?c=A170529_171753_domaci_jj|title= Střelba v Chomutově obnažila potíže v soužití.

The shooter was charged with murder and [[Remand (detention)#Czech Republic 2|remanded in jail]] pending police interviews with witnesses (whereby maximum length of remand is 3 months).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://usti.idnes.cz/strelba-chomutov-obvineni-z-vrazdy-rom-dodavkou-najizdel-na-lidi-a-boural-do-aut-gdl-/usti-zpravy.aspx?c=A170529_142235_usti-zpravy_vac2|title= Soud poslal do vazby střelce z Chomutova obviněného z vraždy Roma [The court remanded the shooter charged of murdering a Roma]|publisher=idnes.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state attorney petitioned court to remand the shooter also for fear of avoiding trial, which would allow jailing him for more than 3 months, however court refused that and state attorney did not challenge that decision.&lt;ref name="idnes 2-6" /&gt; He was released from custody on 14 August 2017 to await trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romea.cz/cz/zpravodajstvi/domaci/strelec-z-chomutova-byl-dnes-propusten-z-vazby-u-soudu-mu-nadale-hrozi-az-dvacet-let-vezeni|title= Střelec z Chomutova byl včera propuštěn z vazby.

== Shooter ==
The shooter was identified by media as a 37 year old Petr Benda.,&lt;ref name="novinky 5-4"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.novinky.cz/krimi/468247-bez-varovani-do-nej-vystrilel-cely-zasobnik-popsal-u-soudu-strelbu-v-chomutove-otec-obeti.html|title= Bez varování do něj vystřílel celý zásobník, popsal u soudu střelbu v Chomutově otec oběti [He empted the entire magazine without so much as a warning, the victim's father said]|publisher=novinky.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; an ethnically white Czech former prison guard that works as a warehouseman.&lt;ref name="idnes 2-6" /&gt; He had owned the firearm legally since 2002.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The shooter claimed that he acted in defense of self and others. He is represented by Jiří Pašek, a local attorney.&lt;ref name="idnes 2-6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zpravy.idnes.cz/strelec-chomutov-soud-trest-najizdeni-do-lidi-rom-fv7-/domaci.aspx?c=A170601_180628_domaci_fka|title=    Střelec z Chomutova může vyváznout bez trestu.

== Driver ==
The driver was identified by media as a 34 year old "Radek Š.",&lt;ref name="radek"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zpravy.idnes.cz/chomutov-strelba-auto-sidliste-utok-smrt-soud-fq8-/krimi.aspx?c=A180125_223457_domaci_ane|title= Deset ran.

Media brought reports of uneasy relations between ethnic Czechs and Romanis at the apartment complex where the incident took place as well as information about possible racist motive of the shooting, which the police however denied.&lt;ref name="potize" /&gt;

==Court Case==
=== Indictment ===
State Attorney Vladimír Jan indicted the shooter on 6 February 2018 on charges of premeditated murder and damage to property; if found guilty, the shooter may face 12 to 20 years imprisonment.&lt;ref name="blesk 6-2" /&gt; According to Jan, the shooter did not act in legitimate defense as the shooting happened after the danger elapsed (there were no more people in the driving path of the car).&lt;ref name="blesk 6-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blesk.cz/clanek/zpravy-krimi/522944/strelec-z-chomutova-je-obzalovan-z-vrazdy-mladeho-roma-pry-nezabil-v-sebeobrane.html|title=Střelec z Chomutova je obžalován z vraždy: Mladého Roma prý nezabil v sebeobraně [The Chomutov shooter was indicted on murder charges, he purportedly did not act in self defense]|publisher=blesk.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the indictment, the driver was returning home from a nightclub and an uncle, who was under influence of drugs, stopped him in front of the shooter's house.&lt;ref name="idnes 12-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://usti.idnes.cz/strelec-chomutov-smrt-rom-dodavka-obzaloba-vrazda-fsw-/usti-zpravy.aspx?c=A180212_111033_usti-zpravy_vac2|title=Zastřelení řidiče v Chomutově bylo zbytečné, nikoho neohrožoval, říká obžaloba [There was no need to shoot the driver in Chomutov, he wasn't endangering anyone according to the indictment]|publisher=idnes.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They engaged in a quarrel.&lt;ref name="idnes 12-2" /&gt; Afterward, the driver attempted to drive away, a group of his relatives was trying to stop him.&lt;ref name="idnes 12-2" /&gt; In an attempt to drive away from the crowd, the driver hit several cars and was driving on the footpath in front of the shooter's house.&lt;ref name="idnes 12-2" /&gt; By that moment the police had already received several calls from concerned citizens and dispatched a unit there.&lt;ref name="romea 13-2" /&gt;

The shooter was alerted by his mother who told him that a driver was hitting cars and people in front of their house and after a brief look out of the window, he ran outside with gun in hand.&lt;ref name="idnes 12-2" /&gt; The van was driving 7 to 8&amp;nbsp;km/h on the footpath with no obstacle or people further in its way.&lt;ref name="idnes 12-2" /&gt; At that moment, the shooter engaged the driver with at least 13 shots from his 9mm [[Beretta Px4 Storm]], hitting him 8 times.&lt;ref name="idnes 12-2" /&gt; The driver was shot in the front torso, leg, side as well as back and died shortly afterward.&lt;ref name="idnes 12-2" /&gt;

State attorney further clarified that media reports of shooter's racial slurs were not corroborated by any witness statements, and that the case has no racial underline.&lt;ref name="romea 13-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romea.cz/cz/zpravodajstvi/domaci/strelec-z-chomutova-byl-obzalovan-z-vrazdy-obet-na-nikoho-nenajizdela-vyvraci-informace-policie-statni-zastupce|title=Střelec z Chomutova byl obžalován z vraždy.

The victim did not drive into people according to the State Attorney]|publisher=romea.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victim's family sought damages in amount of CZK 5 million (USD 250,000).

=== Testimonies ===
In his opening statement, the shooter claimed that he intended to protect the people outside: "My mother told me that there is some lunatic outside. I looked out of the window and I saw a car driving back and forth. At one moment the car very closely missed a group of people. I heard a lot of screaming. I will remember that screaming forever. I recalled all those repulsive car attacks from other countries and decided to go out and help those people."&lt;ref name="idnes 4-4"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://usti.idnes.cz/zastreleni-roma-v-dodavce-chomutov-soud-usti-obzalovany-vrazda-pw7-/usti-zpravy.aspx?c=A180404_100141_usti-zpravy_vac2|title= Jen jsem chránil lidi, hájí se obžalovaný z vraždy Roma v Chomutově [I was just protecting people, claims man charged with murder of a Romani in Chomutov]|publisher=idnes.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed he started shooting when the van drove in his direction.&lt;ref name="idnes 4-4" /&gt; The shooter apologized to the driver's family, saying that he wishes the incident had a different outcome, however that he does not feel guilty of committing a murder.&lt;ref name="idnes 4-4" /&gt;

A witness testified that he "saw someone driving in a van on a parking lot. It was clear from the driving style that the driver was off. Some woman started screaming that he ran over her legs. He was driving into cars as well as into people."&lt;ref name="novinky 5-4a" /&gt; According to another witness, someone was shouting "he drove him off, he probably killed him.&lt;ref name="novinky 5-4a" /&gt; I was thinking what a madman, he is driving people over and hitting cars."&lt;ref name="novinky 5-4a" /&gt; The shooter's mother said that from her window, it seemed that the car is trying to drive into a crowd of people: "When I saw my son with pistol in hand I told him not to do anything. Then I called the police, I didn't even realize he left, and then I only heard the shots."&lt;ref name="novinky 5-4a"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.novinky.cz/krimi/468356-najizdel-do-lidi-i-do-aut-rekli-u-soudu-svedci-o-zastrelenem-ridici-dodavky-v-chomutove.html|title= Najížděl do lidí i do aut, řekli u soudu svědci o zastřeleném řidiči dodávky v Chomutově [He was driving into people, the witnesses testified]|publisher=novinky.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the driver's father's testimony, the driver was walking his dog when he was engaged by his uncle.&lt;ref name="idnes 5-4"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://usti.idnes.cz/zastreleni-roma-v-dodavce-chomutov-soud-obzalovany-petr-benda-vrazda-12v-/usti-zpravy.aspx?c=A180405_092731_usti-zpravy_vac2|title=     Zabil mi syna, ale tvářil se jako neviňátko, řekl otec zastřeleného Roma [He killed my son and then pretended to be innocent]|publisher=idnes.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; They brawled, and afterwards he got into the car and tried to drive away: "He was driving very slowly, maybe he intended to stop, he wasn't endangering anyone, and at that moment Benda came out of the house and shot entire magazine."&lt;ref name="novinky 5-4" /&gt; According to driver's mother written testimony, the same person who was shooting previously shouted from windows from high above racial slurs.&lt;ref name="novinky 5-4" /&gt; The shooter denied that, commenting that he did not say a single word during the entire incident.&lt;ref name="novinky 5-4" /&gt;

According to a psychologist, the shooter has a high moral standard. He feels sorry for the driver's death, however at the same time he is convinced that the given situation required what he did.&lt;ref name="idnes 4-4" /&gt;

A municipal policeman that first arrived to the scene testified that Benda told him that he had shot at the van in self-defense and surrendered the firearm. As more and more Romanis were coming to the scene shouting death threats in the shooter's direction, he took him away. Immediately after the incident, the shooter told the policeman that the car had been driving towards him when he opened fire. The shooter was sober and fully cooperated.&lt;ref name="idnes 5-4" /&gt;
Another witness, driver's uncle, testified that the driver got into the car after a quarrel, and drove the car against his (uncle's) girlfriend. The car hit her and knocked her down. Then the driver crashed into several parked cars, which was followed by the gunshots.&lt;ref name="denika 16-4"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://chomutovsky.denik.cz/zlociny-a-soudy/pamatuje-si-velke-cerne-oci-a-zaslehy-z-pistole-soud-resi-vrazdu-roma-20180404.html|title= Pamatuje si velké černé oči a zášlehy z pistole. Soud řeší vraždu Roma [He remembers large black eyes and muzzle flash]|publisher=denik.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Driver's brother, who was wearing a [[Belly chain (restraint)|belly chain]] and who was escorted by four prison guards as he was serving prison sentence for unrelated crime at the time of the hearing, testified that the driver was a successful freelance businessman in the Netherlands and that he came to Chomutov with the aim of purchasing a flat for their mother.&lt;ref name="denika 16-4" /&gt;

In his closing statement, the shooter said that "going out was my first mistake, I was a naive fool that wanted to help people. The second mistake was the shooting itself. Had I not been so frightened, had I handled the situation in a psychologically and physically better way, it could have had different ending. I am sorry, I did not mean to kill him, but I don't feel guilty of anything."&lt;ref name="denika 16-4" /&gt;

On 17 April 2018, the court found the shooter guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced the shooter to 12.5 years imprisonment. After release, the shooter shall be prohibited from possessing a firearm for further 10 years. The court also awarded CZK 2.5 million (USD 125,000) to the driver's relatives. The judge said that "in the moment when the defendant came outside, he did nothing to assess whether there is any imminent threat, he immediately started shooting and emptied his entire magazine into the car. At the moment of the shooting, the car was not endangering the defendant, nor anybody else.&lt;ref name="denika 17-4"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://chomutovsky.denik.cz/zlociny-a-soudy/chomutovsky-strelec-inkasoval-za-vrazdu-roma-12-a-pul-roku-vezeni-20180417.html|title= Chomutovský střelec inkasoval za vraždu Roma 12 a půl roku vězení [Chomutov shooter sentenced for 12 and half years for murdering a Roma]|publisher=denik.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the shooter used his firearm without any cause, unjustifiably, and he must have done so with intent to kill. When shooting entire magazine at the driver's doors and seeing the driver inside, the defendant must have been aware the 9mm rounds will easily penetrate the doors and cause a potentially deadly injury."&lt;ref name="tyden 17-4"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/domaci/krimi/strelec-dostal-za-vrazdu-na-sidlisti-v-chomutove-12-5-roku-vezeni_476091.html|title= Střelec ze sídliště v Chomutově dostal za vraždu 12,5 roku vězení [Chomutov shooter sentenced for 12 and half years for a murder]|publisher=tyden.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal===
The shooter lodged appeal against the verdict. The appeal was heard by the High Court in Prague which changed the conviction to murder without premeditation and sentenced the shooter to 7 years imprisonment.

The High Court overruled the original decision in several key areas:
*The High Court held that the shooter's actions undertaken within the flat (a decision to load the firearm and go outside to stop the van) were legitimate and covered under the legal definition of necessary defense as he genuinely believed that people's lives were at risk. Thus the court diverged from the original opinion which considered this to be the moment when the murder was premeditated. However, once the shooter got outside of the building, he should have recognized that the car was already leaving the scene and that it was very slowly driving in a direction where there were no more people in its path. Thus, nobody was threatened by the driver by the time of commencement of shooting.
*The High Court further held that the shooter was not under extraordinary distress and thus his actions cannot be considered a mere manslaughter.
*The High court further held that the shooter was cooperating with the investigation from the beginning, had been a law-abiding citizen for his entire life and had positive psychological and psychiatrical assessment as regards the possibility of resocialization. Taking into account that the entire situation was started and exacerbated by the victim and that the shooter acted with aim of protecting others, albeit outside of legal limits of necessary defense, the court decided that there are sufficient reasons for punishment beyond the minimum band of standard penalty for murder (10-18 years) and punished the shooter with 7 years of imprisonment.

The '''Armenians in Bahrain''' are people of [[Armenian people|Armenian]] descent living in [[Bahrain]]. Though no concise data is available, some have estimated that there are around 10 Armenian families living in the country, predominantly in the capital [[Manama]].&lt;ref name=Azad&gt;{{cite web|title=Archbishop Goriun Babian meets Bahrain and Khobar Armenians|url=http://www.azad-hye.net/news/viewnews.asp?newsId=366jfl51|publisher=Azad Hye|accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others state that the population is around 100 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Armenians of Bahrain|url=http://www.azad-hye.net/article/article_view.asp?re=876aah95|publisher=Azad Hye|accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They come from [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]], attracted by the economic opportunities provided by the country.

The Armenians in Bahrain are Armenian Apostolics (Orthodox Armenians) belonging to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and under the jurisdiction of the [[Holy See of Cilicia]]. The [[Catholicossate of the Great House of Cilicia]] (also known as the Holy See of Cilicia) has established the "Diocese of Kuwait and the Arabian Gulf Countries" headquartered in Kuwait, but also serving the Armenians in the Persian Gulf including Bahrain.&lt;ref name=Azad/&gt;

The first [[Divine Liturgy|Armenian Mass]] was held on 10 December 2004, in Manama, by the [[Archbishop]] Goriun Babian who heads the [[Armenians in the United Arab Emirates|Armenian community in the UAE]].&lt;ref name=Azad/&gt;

'''Aṣíkò''' (Ashiko) is a musical genre similar to [[Sakara music|sákárà]] music from Nigeria, West Africa. Aṣíkò was the Christian version of [[Sakara music|sákárà]] (Sakara). It developed originally as a type of
[[syncretic]] street drumming in port towns throughout [[English language|Anglophone]] West Africa. By the 1920s it was also played by musicians inland in [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] towns like [[Abęokuta]] and [[Ibadan]]. Isaac O. Delano gives a detailed description of an aṣíkò ensemble in the 1930s:

"Another popular native dance is the "Ashiko". It is not a Yoruba dance in its origin, but was imported from [[Sierra Leone]] or somewhere that way. The "Ashiko" dance is chiefly performed by Christian people, and has only one kind of music, rather quicker than the "Sakara" . . . and resembles a fox-trot. No stringed instruments are employed, only drums and carpenter's saw, used occasionally to make a kind of noise on its sharp edge, as an embellishment to "Ashiko" drum music. Sometimes a bottle is also used, a nail beating time on it, for the same purpose. The drummers, five in number, all beat similar drums, and produce a continuous volume of music. The dancing is done by pairs, two ladies and two gentlemen facing each other. The drummers sing as in the "Sakara" dance with chorus boys, but no one else sings with them (Delano [1937] 1973:157)."&lt;ref&gt;Delano, Isaac. [1937] 1973. The soul of Nigeria. Nendeln: Kraus Reprints.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aṣíkò music has its origins in the music of [[Sierra Leone]]an repatriates, from the West Indian colonies, who themselves had been influenced by [[Afro-Brazilian]] [[samba]] music. The wooden frame drums used in aṣíkò music and the carpenter's saw, were introduced by the [[Liberated Africans in Nigeria|Aguda]], who introduced modern carpentry techniques to the Yoruba artisans. Often, elderly informants use the terms aṣíkò and [[samba|sámbà]] interchangeably. "John Collins writes that a social dance genre called aṣíkò was popular in Accra, the capital of the [[Gold Coast Colony]] before World War I (Collins 1977:54)."&lt;ref&gt;Collins, E.J. 1977. Post-war popular band music in West Africa. African Arts 10(3): 53-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Other influences are also possible from [[Dahomean]], [[Liberia]]n and [[West Indian]] immigrants.

[[Lagos]] was a breeding ground for young Christian musicians playing aṣíkò music. They developed and rehearsed their own versions of holiday songs, for various festivals around Christmas, etc. Then when the day arrived they would take to the streets and compete. With the elders as judges, the best group would take home a cash prize. The aṣíkò drum, a square frame drum, complete with tuning pegs, was perfect for marching in a parade. It was hand held, lightweight and easy to play with one hand. The drums are made in different sizes and played using interlocking rhythms, which create a driving beat that's difficult to resist as the band marches through the streets.

Delano noted European musical influences, since there's no call and response tradition within this genre. The drummers themselves are the singers.

The success of these amateur aṣíkò groups resulted in a number of them becoming full-time professional bands, which eventually entered the recording studios allowing them to reach a larger audience and become quite popular. Musicians such as A.B.O. Mabinuori, Amusa (otherwise known as 'Captain'),  Jero, Tesilimi, Samu Egbo ("Samu Esu"), Ajayi Williams (alias "Ajayi Koboko") and Alabi Labilu are just a few of the most popular aṣíkò bandleaders.

This [[syncretized]] music was the perfect match for the newly indoctrinated Christian converts of the day, because it incorporated "foreign" instruments with no ties to traditional religious practices; lyrical poetic song texts promoting Christianity over the [[Orisha|òrìṣà]] (traditional religion) and the songs were sung in either [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] or [[Nigerian Pidgin English]], which made them accessible to a large cross-section of the population.

As the music grew in popularity the song texts began to change, as well. By the late 1920s songs could be heard about important social events, historical events, current events  and low-status occupations, like prostitution, etc.

Examples of aṣíkò can be found on CD, as well as [[Sakara music|sákárà]] music, it's Islamic counterpart.

Nigerian musician [[Babatunde Olatunji]] incorporated many of these elements into his music. The samba rhythm was one of his favorites, heard on many of his albums. Much like the rhythm of [[James Brown]] identified him and his music; the samba rhythms identify the music of [[Olatunji]]. Typically, he did not use sets of drums, but rather created batteries of drums. For instance, [[atsimevu]], [[djembe]], [[conga]]s and [[dunun]] would be played together. In the latter part of his career he also introduced a drum, now identified with him, the [[Ashiko|Boku]] drum from Cuba, under the name aṣíkò (ashiko). For most American drummers this is the ashiko drum, as opposed to the hand held relative of the Spanish [[Pandeiro]]. In light of his Yoruba origins and Christian upbringing, it all makes sense. As we look at his recordings we see everything from songs like Bethlehemu to Shango and from Sahara Samba to [[Mbira]] which features, not Mbira as we know it but rather, a Cuban style [[Marimbula]] or [[Agidigbo]] as it is known in Nigeria.

'''Bernard Hendrik Slicher''', since 1933 calling himself '''Slicher van Bath''', was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[social history|social historian]], best known internationally for his 1960 work ''The agrarian history of Western Europe, AD 500–1850''{{r|bwn}} and regarded as the initiator of [[Quantitative history|quantitative]] social history in his native country.&lt;ref name="boonstra"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Boonstra |first1=Onno |last2=Gales |first2=Ben |title=Quantitative social historical research in the Netherlands: past, present and future |journal=Historical Social Research |volume=9 |year=1984 |issue=2 |url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0168-ssoar-35049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slicher commenced his studies in history at the [[Rijksuniversiteit Groningen]] in 1930 and moved to [[Utrecht University|Utrecht]] in 1934 where he studied under the German medievalist [[Otto Oppermann]]. Having graduated in 1936, he took an assistant position with Oppermann, typing the professor's manuscripts and maintaining his library, which brought him into contact with the journal ''[[Annales d'histoire économique et sociale]]''. Slicher van Bath then worked for some time as an archivist in [[Gelderland]], being able to avoid [[conscription]] as a former sufferer of [[polio]],{{r|bwn}} and returned to Oppermann's service in 1941. Oppermann's research interests took an ever more ideological turn toward [[national socialism]]; when he suggested, in 1942, that Slicher should research the Dutch role in the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]'', Slicher quit his job.{{r|bwn}}

During the [[World War II in the Netherlands|war time]], Slicher van Bath pursued a [[doctorate degree]], initially with Oppermann but soon with the Amsterdam-based historian [[Jan Romein]], visiting Romein at his home and later at his hiding place.{{r|bwn}} The thesis was finished in 1944, the doctorate degree awarded half a year after the end of World War II in November 1945.

Slicher van Bath finally settled in [[Wageningen University and Research Centre|Wageningen]], where he was appointed special professor{{efn|{{lang-nl|Bijzonder hoogleraar}}.}} in agrarian history and formed what was termed the "Wageningen school" of quantitative history{{r|boonstra}} (a label that Slicher vehemently rejected, not wishing to be constrained by the methods of any particular "school"{{r|bwg}}). At the request of the [[Cambridge Economic History of Europe]]'s editorial board, Slicher van Bath wrote ''The agrarian history of Western Europe, AD 500–1850'', his ''magnum opus'' (initially published in Dutch as ''De agrarische geschiedenis van West-Europa (500-1850)'', 1960).{{r|bwn}} The book got him a guest professorship at the [[University of Chicago]] (1967–68), where Slicher van Bath became interested in the methods of the [[new economic history]] and shifted his attention to the history of [[Latin America]]. The history of this continent, rather than Annales-style regional studies of the Netherlands and Western Europe, would be his primary research topic until his 1975 retirement.{{r|bwn}}

The area known as Cappadocia today was known to the [[Persians|Ancient Persians]] as ''Katpatuka'', a name which the Greeks altered into Kappadokia (Cappadocia).&lt;ref name=" Bevan, Edwyn Robert 1966 76 "&gt;{{cite book|author= Bevan, Edwyn Robert |title= The house of Seleucus, Volume 1 |publisher= Barnes &amp; Noble |year= 1966 |page=76 |oclc= 313659202 |quote= The eastern and northern part of the country beyond the Taurus was known to the Persians as Katpatuka, a name which the Greeks transformed into Cappadocia (Kappadokia). }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Greeks and Greek culture arrived in Asia Minor, the area was controlled by another [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] people, the [[Hittites]]. [[Mycenaean Greeks]] set up trading posts along the west coast around 1300 B.C. and soon started [[Colonies in antiquity|colonizing]] the coasts, spreading Hellenic culture and language. In the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic era]], following the conquest of Anatolia by [[Alexander the Great]], Greek settlers began arriving in the mountainous regions of Cappadocia at this time.&lt;ref name=" Avi-Yonah, Michael 1978 119 "&gt;{{cite book|author= Avi-Yonah, Michael |title=Hellenism and the East: contacts and interrelations from Alexander to the Roman conquest |publisher=University Microfilms International |year=1978 |page=119 |isbn=978-0-8357-0301-7 |quote= The Ptolemies also kept close control of the cities on their domain, but as - apart from Naucratis - their cities were new foundations, the relations between them and their cities belong properly to the next subject to be dealt with, the foundation of new cities… Between these two areas cities were set up along the old Persian 'royal road' from Sardis to Cilicia. This strip of Greek colonies was located between the mountainous regions of Pisidia, Cilicia and Cappadocia, which remained largely unconquered or were ruled by native vassals. Another row of cities lined the seacoast from Rhodes eastwards.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Greek population movement of the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC solidified a Greek presence in Cappadocia. As a result, Greek became the [[lingua franca]] of the region's natives. It would become the sole spoken language of the region's inhabitants within three centuries and would remain so for the next one thousand years.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt;

The region became a key Byzantine military district after the advent of Islam and the subsequent [[Muslim conquests|Muslim conquest]] of Syria led to the establishment of a militarized frontier zone (cf ''[[kleisoura (Byzantine district)|kleisoura]]'' and ''[[thughur]]'') on the border of Cappadocia. This lasted from the mid-7th to the 10th century during the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]], immortalized in [[Digenis Akritas]], the [[Medieval Greek]] heroic epic set in this frontier region. During this period Cappadocia became crucial to the empire and produced numerous Byzantine generals, notably the [[Phokas (Byzantine family)|Phokas]] clan, warlords (see [[Karbeas]] of [[Tephrike]]), and intrigue, most importantly the [[Paulician]] heresy. Because they were living in such a volatile region, the Cappadocian Greeks created elaborate underground cities in the volcanic formations of eastern Cappadocia and would take refuge in them during times of danger.

In the 10th century [[Leo the Deacon]] recorded a journey to Cappadocia by [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros Phokas]], in his writings he mentions that its inhabitants were called Troglodytes, in view of the fact that they “went underground in holes, clefts and labyrinths, as it were in dens and burrows”.&lt;ref name=" Rodley, Lyn 2010 1 "&gt;{{cite book|author= Rodley, Lyn |title=Cave Monasteries of Byzantine Cappadocia |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |page=1 |isbn=978-0-521-15477-2 |quote= The tenth-century historian Leo the Deacon records a journey to Cappadocia made by Nikephoros Phokas shortly before he became emperor. Perhaps to recapture the attention of readers beginning to tire of troop movements he also offers a scrap of information about a curiosity of the region to which the emperor was heading: its inhabitants were once called troglodytes, because ‘they went underground in holes, clefts and labyrinths, as it were in dens and burrows’. This brief note was probably not based on first-hand knowledge but it might have been prompted by an awareness of the vast number of rock-cut cavities in an area to the west and southwest of Kaisareia (Kayseri of modern Turkey). Had Leo been more inclined to garrulous digression (or perhaps just better informed), he might have supplied more details of the troglodyte region and the task of bringing scholarly order to the hundreds of rock-cut monuments and other cavities in the area might have been much similar. … At this time the region was still inhabited by a mixed population of Turkish-speaking Moslems and Greek-speaking Christians. The latter group left for Greece in the early 1920s, during an exchange of population of minorities that was part of the radical social re-ordering initiated by Kemal Ataturk; they were replaced by Turks from Greece, mostly from Thrace. In the two decades before this upheaval, however, members of the local Greek population acted as guides to [[Guillaume de Jerphanion]], who made several visits to the volcanic valleys and wrote his meticulous descriptions of many painted Byzantine rock-cut churches. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Byzantine empire|Byzantines]] re-established control of Cappadocia between the 7th and 11th centuries, during this period churches were carved into cliffs and rock faces in the [[Göreme]] and Soğanlı region.&lt;ref name=" Darke, Diana 2011 139-140 "/&gt; In the Middle Ages the Cappadocian Greeks would bury their religious figures in and around monasteries.

The decision of many lords to leave was frequently the result of coercion, though throughout the tenth to eleventh centuries there were also pro-Byzantine factions within the Armenian kingdoms, supporting Byzantium’s aims. Already in 968 the southwestern district of Taron was annexed. In 1000, a large area embracing Tayk, Karin, and Manzikert (to the north of Lake Van) was annexed to the Byzantine Empire. In 1021 King Senekerim Artsruni of Vaspurakan ceded his kingdom to the empire and moved to Cappadocia. He was followed in 1045 by King Gagik II of Ani and King Gagik-Abas of Kars (1064). The Byzantine policy of removing important lords from their Armenian lands and settling them elsewhere (principally on imperial territory, in Cappadocia and northern Mesopotamia) proved shortsighted in two respects. First, it left eastern Asia Minor devoid of its native defenders. Second, it exacerbated Armeno-Greek ethnic tensions by the introduction of thousands of Armenian newcomers into Cappadocia. The empire compounded its error by disbanding a 50,000-man local Armenian army, ostensibly to save money. As a result, the land was left defenseless as well as leaderless. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the fifteenth century more than 90 percent of the population was Muslim. Some of this change was due to the immigration of a large Muslim population, but in great part it was caused by the conversion of Christians to Islam. These conversions were basically due to the breakdown of Anatolian Christianity through the weakening of the Byzantine state and the Greek Orthodox Church, and the collapse of Anatolian society in the face of Turkish migrations. In the late thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the Turks excluded bishops and metropolitans from their sees. Church revenues and properties were confiscated. Hospitals, schools, orphanages, and monasteries were destroyed or abandoned, and the Anatolian Christian population was left without leadership and social services. The remaining Christian clerics had to turn to Turkish authorities to handle internal disputes on terms that only further weakened Christian institutions. …Byzantine princes, lords, and administrators were tempted to convert to Islam in order to join the Ottoman aristocracy.

The first literary works in a modern European sense were based on a spoken variety of Turkish and written with Armenian characters. The Karamanlid literature, produced by orthodox Christians, was written in Greek characters. The Judeo-Spanish (Ladino) group cultivated a Romance variety brought to Istanbul and the Balkans by Jews expelled from Spain in 1492. The first descriptions and grammars of Ottoman were written by minority members and foreigners.

The strategy implemented by the Turks is of displacing people to the interior without taking measures for their survival by exposing them to death, hunger, and illness. The abandoned homes are then looted and burnt or destroyed. Whatever was done to the Armenians is being repeated with the Greeks. Massacres most likely did take place at Amisos and other villages in Pontus.

As part of the final phase of this agreement, 44,432 Greek Orthodox Cappadocian refugees were expelled from Turkey and came to Greece as exchanged persons. Since they had not fled under conditions of military conflict, the experience for them was different from that of the earlier waves of refugees who arrived in Greece in 1922. In this chapter, I describe two Cappadocian settlements: New Karvali in eastern Macedonia, northern Greece, and New Prokopi in central Greece, on the island of Evia. In choosing to study these particular settlements two factors proved decisive: their name and their culture significance. Both settlements were named after places left behind in Cappadocia, with the addition of the word ‘New’. […]Aside from the religious dimension, the other main factor that helped the Cappadocian refugees transform their settlements from ‘space’ into a meaningful ‘place’ was that many of them were settled as communities and were not broken up and dispersed. This allowed the transplanted people to name their settlements in Greece after their villages in Cappadocia. […] In the case of the Cappadocians, the notion of keeping a discrete refugee community together as one unit in the settlement process played a significant role in the refugees’ process of adaptation. By settling near relatives and their fellow villagers from Cappadocia, these refugees were encouraged to re-create their neighborhoods. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The regions of Greece with significant settlements of Cappadocian Greeks include the cities of [[Karditsa]], [[Volos]], [[Kilkis]], [[Larisa]], [[Chalkidiki]], [[Kavala]], [[Alexandroupoli]] and [[Thessaloniki]].&lt;ref name="Ammon, Ulrich 2012 180 "&gt;{{cite book|author= Ammon, Ulrich |title=Morphologies in Contact |publisher= Akademie Verlag|year= 2012|page=180 |isbn=978-3-05-005701-9 |quote= Even among men, very few people were fully bilingual, as opposed to speakers of Cappadocian, another Asia Minor dialect of Greek origin, where bilingualism was spread among men and women.

{{main|Cappadocian Greek}}

The Cappadocian Greeks traditionally spoke a dialect of the Greek language known as ''[[Cappadocian Greek]]''. Cappadocian Greek diverged from the other [[Byzantine Greek]] dialects early, beginning with the Turkish conquests of central Asia Minor in the 11th and 12th centuries, and so developed several radical features, such as the loss of the gender for nouns.&lt;ref name="Dawkins, R.M 1916"&gt;Dawkins, R.M. 1916. Modern Greek in Asia Minor. A study of dialect of Silly, Cappadocia and Pharasa. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, having been isolated from the crusader conquests ([[Fourth Crusade]]) and the later Venetian influence of the Greek coast, it retained the Ancient Greek terms for many words that were replaced with [[Romance language]] ones in Demotic Greek.&lt;ref name="Dawkins, R.M 1916"/&gt; After centuries of Ottoman rule the [[Turkish language]] began to emerge as the dominant language of Cappadocia. Many Greeks began to speak Turkish as a second language and became bilingual, this was the case with the “''Kouvoukliotes''” who were always Greek speakers and spoke Turkish with a strong Greek accent,&lt;ref name=" Armenian General Benevolent Union 1988 43 "&gt;{{cite book|author= Armenian General Benevolent Union |title= Ararat, Volume 29 |publisher= Armenian General Benevolent Union of America |year= 1988 |page=43 |oclc= 643827160|quote= Unlike the Karamanlides – Elia Kazan’s people, the Greeks of Kaisaria in the Anatolian interior who, over the centuries became Turkish-speaking – the Kouvoukliotes were always Grecophones who spoke Turkish with a strong Greek accent. As was natural, their dialect included Turkish words like rahat, bahcheh, dondourmas…., and it differed greatly from the Greek spoken in other villages of the province. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there were Cappadocian Greeks who only spoke the Turkish language and had given up the use of Greek centuries earlier, known as the ''[[Karamanlides]]''.&lt;ref name="Nagel Publishers 1968 615"&gt;{{cite book |author= Nagel Publishers |title= Turkey |publisher= Nagel |year= 1968 |page=615 |oclc= 3060049 |quote= The Karaman region was for a long time inhabited by Turkish-speaking Orthodox Greeks who wrote Turkish in the Greek script. These Greeks are called Karamanians. }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 20th century, the Cappadocian Greek language still had a strong presence at [[Gülşehir]] (formerly Arabison/Arapsu) north-west of [[Nevsehir]], and in the large region southward as far down as [[Niğde]] and [[Bor, Niğde|Bor]].&lt;ref name=" Horrocks, Geoffrey C. 2010 403 "&gt;{{cite book|author= Horrocks, Geoffrey C. |title=Greek: A History of the Language and Its Speakers |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2010 |page=403 |isbn=978-1-4051-3415-6 |quote= None the less, at the beginning of the 20th century, Greek still had a strong presence in Silli north-west of Konya (ancient Ikonion), in Pharasa and other villages in the region drained by the Yenice river (some {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} south of Kayeri, ancient Caesarea), and in Cappadocia proper, at Arabison (Arapsu/Gulsehir) north-west of Nevsehir (ancient Nyssa), and in the large region south of Nevsehir as far down as Nigde and Bor (close to ancient Tyana). This whole area, as the home of St Basil the Great (329-79), his brother St Gregory of Nyssa (335-94) and his friend St Gregory of Nazianzos (330-89), was of great importance in the early history of Christianity, but is perhaps most famous today for the extraordinary landscape of eroded volcanic tufa in the valleys of Goreme, Ihlara and Soganh, and for the churches and houses carved into the 'fairy chimneys' to serve the Christian population in the middle ages. Many of the rock cut churches, which range in date from the 6th to the 13th centuries, contain magnificent frescos. Away from the valleys, some of the villages have vast underground complexes containing houses, cellars, stables, refectories, cemeteries and churches, affording protection from marauding Arabs in the days when the Byzantine empire extended to the Euphrates, and serving later as places of refuge from hostile Turkish raiders. The most famous of these are at Kaymakli and Derinkuyu, formerly the Greek villages of Anaku (Inegi) and Malakopi (Melagob), where the chambers extended down over several levels of depths of up to 85 metres. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek was also still spoken at [[Sille (village)|Silli]] north-west of [[Konya]], in [[Develi|Pharasa]]&lt;ref name=" Horrocks, Geoffrey C. 2010 403 "/&gt; and other villages in isolated communities in the interior of central Turkey prior to the Genocide of 1915 and subsequent population transfers.&lt;ref name=" Moseley, Christopher 2007 239-40 "&gt;{{cite book |author= Moseley, Christopher |title=Encyclopedia Of The World's Endangered Languages |publisher=Psychology Press |year= 2007 |pages=239–40 |isbn=978-0-7007-1197-0 |quote= Cappadocian Greek [100] an outlying dialect of Greek spoken in a few isolated communities in the interior of Cappadocia in central Turkey, notably in Sille (Silli) near Konya, villages near Kayseri, and Faras (Pharasa) and adjacent villages, before the genocide of 1915 and the subsequent population exchanges, after which most survivors settled in Greece. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Cappadocian Greeks completely abandoned Greek when they learned Turkish, although in the western regions of Cappadocia many Greeks still retained their native language. John Robert Sitlington Sterrett travelled through Cappadocia in 1884 and noted: "[[Derinkuyu|Melegobi]] is a large and flourishing village, inhabited almost exclusively by Greek-speaking Greeks. The Greeks are numerous all through the western part of Cappadocia, and generally cling to their language with great tenacity, a fact worthy of notice, inasmuch as the Greeks in other parts of Asia Minor speak only Turkish.

During the 19th-century British scholar [[John Pinkerton]] was informed by the Turkish-speaking Greeks that past Turkish rulers of Anatolia had caused them to lose the knowledge of the Greek language,&lt;ref name="Batalden, Stephen K. 2004 246"/&gt; Pinkerton reported that:

:{{quotation|..."the cruel persecutions of their Mahomedan masters have been the cause of their present degraded state of ignorance, even in regard to their native tongue; for that there was a time when their Turkish masters strictly prohibited the Greeks in Asia Minor even from speaking the Greek language among themselves, and that they cut out the tongues of some, and punished others with death, who dared to disobey this their barbarous command. It is an indisputable fact, that the language of their oppressors has long since almost universally prevailed, and that in a great part of Anatolia even the public worship of the Greeks is now performed in the Turkish tongue. The following works, in the Turkish language, but all in the Greek character, afford further proof of what I have now stated...” ([[John Pinkerton]], 1817)&lt;ref name="Batalden, Stephen K. 2004 246"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stephen K.

Those who disobeyed "this their barbarous command" had had their tongues cut out or had been punished with death. The cutting out of tongues was a commonly held, popular explanation for the abandonment of Greek in favor of Turkish, although there is no evidence that such a practice had ever occurred. “It is”, Pinkerton wrote, “an indisputable fact, that the language of their oppressors has long since almost universally prevailed, and that in a great part of Anatolia even the public worship of the Greeks is now performed in the Turkish tongue”. He appended a list of publications in karamanlidika, five of which he had been able to purchase. He concluded that, in his “humble opinion,” }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In the 1920s when the Cappadocian Greeks arrived in Greece, the [[Cappadocian Greek]] spoken by them was hardly intelligible with the [[Demotic Greek]] used in mainland Greece, as it had been cut off from the rest of the Greek-speaking world for centuries. The Cappadocian Greeks were more linguistically Turkified then the Greeks in Pontus and the western coastal regions of Turkey.&lt;ref name="Daly, Michael 1988 40"/&gt; Once in Greece though, they started using the [[modern Greek language]],&lt;ref name=" Gökalp, Ziya 1959 131 "/&gt; causing their ancestral Greek dialect, the Cappadocian Greek language, to go to the brink of extinction. The Cappadocian Greek language was believed by some scholars to have been extinct for many years. The language was then declared alive in 2005, when descendants of Cappadocian Greeks were discovered still speaking the language fluently in central and northern Greece.&lt;ref name=" Horrocks, Geoffrey C. 2010 398 "&gt;{{cite book|author= Horrocks, Geoffrey C. |title=Greek: A History of the Language and Its Speakers |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2010 |page=398 |isbn=978-1-4051-3415-6 |quote= Cappadocia fell immediately under Seljuk control and, with the growth of bilingualism and conversion to Islam, its dialects began to show signs of Turkish influence and later of convergence with the dominant language.

In 2005, however, it was discovered that there were descendants of the Cappadocian refugees in central and northern Greece who still spoke their traditional language fluently. The position of Cappadocia remains precarious, but it is certainly not yet extinct. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is still spoken by mainly elderly Cappadocian Greeks in various regions of Greece including in Karditsa, Volos, Kilkis, Larisa, Thessaloniki, Chalkidiki, Kavala, and Alexandroupoli.&lt;ref name="Ammon, Ulrich 2012 180 "/&gt; Some Cappadocian Greeks who converted to Islam, allowing them to avoid the population exchanges of 1923, still speak the language in their traditional homeland in Turkey{{Citation Needed|date=May 2018}}.

==Culture==
The Cappadocian Greeks have been isolated from the rest of the Greek-speaking world for centuries and this has made their [[culture]], way of life, and customs somewhat distinctive. Their culture has been strongly influenced by the topography of its different regions. In commercial cities like [[Kayseri]] and [[Derinkuyu|Malakopea]] upper level education and arts flourished under the protection of a cosmopolitan middle class. The economy of Cappadocia was largely based upon [[agriculture]] and [[mining]] and the rural centers which lay upon the valleys and plains. The Cappadocian Greeks have distinctive traditional songs and dances which are still performed in Greece.

===Contemporary literature===
The Cappadocian Greek-American immigrant and renowned Hollywood director [[Elia Kazan]] wrote a book "America, America" about his uncle, who grew up in Cappadocia in an environment of increasing persecution. Sent on foot by his father as a teenager, with the entire family savings, to Istanbul, Elia's uncle was supposed to establish a new life and, eventually, to bring the rest of the family to the city. In the end Elia's uncle traveled much further, to America, later fulfilling his filial duty and bringing his family over as well. Kazan made his book into an Academy Award-winning movie ''[[America, America]]'' in 1963.

===Cuisine===
The Cappadocian Greeks continued a number of Anatolian culinary traditions passed down since Byzantine times.

{{nihongo|'''Coming of Age Day'''|成人の日|Seijin no Hi}} is a [[Japanese holiday]] held annually on the second Monday of January. It is held in order to congratulate and encourage all those who have reached or will reach the [[age of majority]] between April 2 of the previous year and April 1 of the current year, and to help them realize that they have become [[adult]]s. Festivities include {{nihongo|'''coming of age ceremonies'''|成人式|seijin-shiki}} held at local and [[prefecture|prefectural]] offices, as well as after-parties among family and friends.

==History==
[[Coming of age]] ceremonies have been celebrated in [[Japan]] since at least 714 AD, when a young prince donned new robes and a hairstyle to mark his passage into [[adulthood]].&lt;ref name=ss&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=19733|title=Coming of Age Day, a big event for Japanese youths, is steeped in tradition |last=Allen|first=David|author2=Sumida, Chiyomi|date=January 9, 2004|work=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holiday was first established in 1948, to be held every year on January 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Araiso|first=Yoshiyuki|title=Currents: 100 essential expressions for understanding changing Japan|publisher=Japan Echo Inc. in cooperation with the Foreign Press Center|page=150|date=1988|isbn=978-4-915226-03-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, as a result of the [[Happy Monday System]], Coming of Age Day was changed to the second Monday in January.&lt;ref name=ss /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kyōkai|first=Nihon Rōdō|title=Japan labor bulletin, Volume 39|publisher=Japan Institute of Labour|date=2000|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/japan-coming-age-day-2015-facts-about-japanese-holiday-celebrating-young-people-1775200|title=Japan Coming Of Age Day 2015: Facts About Japanese Holiday Celebrating Young People [PHOTOS]|date=11 January 2015|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|last=Glum|first=Julia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan's [[Demographics of Japan|low birth rate and shrinking percentage of young people]], coupled with disruptions to some ceremonies in recent years (such as an incident in [[Naha]] in 2002, when drunken Japanese youths tried to disrupt the festivities) and a general increase in the number of 20-year-olds who do not feel themselves to be adults have led to decreased attendance of the ceremonies, which has caused some concern among older Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/1381592/Drunken-Japanese-youths-ruin-coming-of-age-rituals.html|title=Drunken Japanese youths ruin coming of age rituals|last=Joyce|first=Colin|date=January 15, 2002|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the decline continued for the fifth year in a row, with the total of 1.22 million adults celebrating the holiday in 2012 – under half of the participants seen at its peak in 1976, when 2.76 million adults attended ceremonies. This was the first time it has declined below the 50% threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120109p2g00m0dm076000c.html|title=Record-low number of new adults mark Coming-of-Age Day|date=January 9, 2012|work=[[Mainichi Daily News]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109191853/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120109p2g00m0dm076000c.html|archivedate=January 9, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan lowered the age of adulthood in 2018 from 20 years of age to 18 which is set to take effect in 2022. This change has caused confusion on the status of the holiday, and raised concerns among the [[kimono]] industry which profits from the garments worn during the ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/japan-lowers-age-adulthood-20-to-18|title=Credit cards, but no sake: Japan lowers age of adulthood from 20 to 18|author=Justin McCurry|publisher=The Guardian|date=June 14, 2018|accessdate=June 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremonies==
{{nihongo|Coming of age ceremonies|成人式|Seijin-shiki}} mark one's coming of age (age of maturity), which reflects both the expanded rights but also increased responsibilities expected of new adults. The ceremonies are generally held in the morning at local city offices throughout Japan. All young adults who turned or will turn 20 between April 2 of the previous year and April 1 of the current one and who maintain [[Jūminhyō|residency]] in the area are invited to attend. Government officials give speeches, and small presents are handed out to the newly recognized adults.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Many women celebrate this day by wearing ''[[furisode]]'', a style of ''kimono'' with long sleeves that hang down, and ''[[zōri]]'' sandals. Since most are unable to put on a ''kimono'' by themselves due to the intricacies involved, many choose to visit a beauty salon to dress and to set their hair. A full set of formal clothing is expensive, so it is usually either borrowed from a relative or rented rather than bought especially for the occasion. Men sometimes also wear traditional dress (e.g. dark ''kimono'' with ''[[hakama]]''), but nowadays many men wear formal Western clothes such as a suit and tie more often than the traditional ''hakama''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=Jennifer Ellen|title=A companion to the anthropology of Japan|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|date=2005|pages=158|isbn=978-0-631-22955-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the ceremony, the young adults often celebrate in groups by going to parties or going out drinking.&lt;ref name=ss/&gt;

'''Dagbani''' (or Dagbane), also known as '''Dagbanli''' and '''Dagbanle''', is a [[Gur languages|Gur language]] spoken in [[Ghana]]. Its native speakers are estimated around 1,160,000 (2013). It is a compulsory subject in primary and junior high school in the [[Dagbon Kingdom]], which covers the eastern part of the region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dagbani is also widely known as a second language in northern Ghana, especially among acephalous tribes overseen by the King of Dagbon, the ''[[Ya-Na]]''.

It is closely related to and [[mutually intelligible]] with the [[Mampelle language]], also spoken in [[Northern Region (Ghana)|Northern Region, Ghana]]. Dagbani is also similar to the other languages of the same subgroup spoken in this Region, the [[Dagaare language|Dagaare]] and [[Wala people|Waala]] languages, spoken in [[Upper West Region]] of Ghana, and the [[Frafra language]], spoken in [[Upper East Region]] of Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gur|last=Naden|first=Tony|date=1989|publisher=University Press of America|location=Lanham, MD|pages=141–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Niger-Congo Languages|last=Bendor-Samuel|first=John T. [ed.]|date=1989|publisher=University Press of America|location=Lanham, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Dialects==
Dagbani has a major dialect split between Eastern Dagbani, centred on the traditional capital town of [[Yendi]], and Western Dagbani, centred on the administrative capital of the Northern Region, [[Tamale, Ghana|Tamale]]. The dialects are however mutually intelligible and mainly consist of different [[root vowels]] in some [[lexemes]], and different forms or pronunciations of some nouns, particularly those referring to local flora. The words ''Dagbani'' and ''Dagbanli'' given above for the name of the language are respectively the Eastern and Western dialect forms of the name, but the Dagbani Orthography Committee resolved that “It was decided that in the spelling system &lt;Dagbani&gt; is used to refer to the ... Language, and &lt;Dagbanli&gt; ... to the life and culture”;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Committee|first=Dagbani Orthography|title=Approved Dagbani Orthography|date=n/d (1998)|publisher=privately|location=n/p (Tamale, N.R.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{OR|date=July 2017}} in the spoken language, each dialect used its form of the name for both functions.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===

Dagbani has eleven phonemic vowels – six short vowels and five long vowels:

Olawsky (1999) puts the [[schwa]] (ə) in place of {{IPA|/ɨ/}}, unlike other researchers on the language&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hudu |first=Fusheini |year=2010 |title=Dagbani tongue-root harmony: a formal account with ultrasound investigation,
  |location=Vancouver |publisher=University of British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt; who use the higher articulated {{IPA|/ɨ/}}. [[Allophonic]] variation based on [[tongue-root advancement]] is well attested for 4 of these vowels: {{IPA|[i]}} ~ {{IPA|[ɪ]/[ə]}}, {{IPA|[e]}} ~ {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, {{IPA|[u]}} ~ {{IPA|[ʊ]}} and {{IPA|[o]}} ~ {{IPA|[ɔ]}}.

===Tone===
Dagbani is a [[tonal language]] in which pitch is used to distinguish words, as in ''gballi'' {{IPA|[ɡbálːɪ́]}} (high-high) 'grave' vs. ''gballi'' {{IPA|[ɡbálːɪ̀]}} (high-low) 'zana mat'.&lt;ref&gt;Olawsky 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The tone system of Dagbani is characterised by two level tones and [[downstep]] (a lowering effect occurring between sequences of the same phonemic tone).

==Writing system==
[[File:A teacher at School for Life, a project in northern Ghana, April 2012 (8405073471).jpg|thumb|right|250px|A teacher at School for Life, a project in northern Ghana]]Dagbani is written in a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] with the addition of the [[apostrophe]], the letters [[ɛ]], [[ɣ]], [[ŋ]], [[ɔ]], and [[ʒ]], and the digraphs [[Ch (digraph)|ch]], [[Gb (digraph)|gb]], [[Kp (digraph)|kp]], and [[Ny (digraph)|ny]]. The [[literacy]] rate used to be only 2–3%.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} This percentage is expected to rise as Dagbani is now a compulsory subject in primary and junior secondary school all over [[Dagbon]]. The [[orthography]] currently used&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/613117515|title=Dagbani basic and cultural vocabulary|last=Sergio|first=Baldi|last2=Adam|first2=Mahmoud|date=2006|publisher=Univ. degli Studidi Napoli "L'Orientale"|year=|isbn=9788895044071|location=|pages=10|oclc=613117515}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Orthography Committee /d(1998)) represents a number of [[allophone|allophonic]] distinctions.

==Grammar==
Dagbani is [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]], but with some [[fusional language|fusion]] of affixes. The constituent order in Dagbani sentences is usually [[agent–verb–object]].

==Lexicon==
There is an insight into a historical stage of the language in the papers of Rudolf Fisch reflecting data collected during his missionary work in the [[German Togoland]] colony in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, especially the lexical list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisch|first=Rudolf|title=Wörtersammlung Dagbané-Deutsch|journal=MSOS|date=1913|volume=16|pages=113–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there is also some grammatical information&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisch|first=Rudolf|title=Grammatik der Dagomba-Sprache|journal=Archiv für das Studium deutscher Kolonialsprachen|date=1912|volume=14|pages=1–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sample texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisch|first=Rudolf|title=Dagbane Sprachproben|journal=M. veröfffentlich vom Seminar für Kolonialsprachen in Hamburg|date=1913|volume=8|pages=beiheft}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more modern glossary was published in 1934 by a southern Ghanaian officer of the colonial government, E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2131">The '''Ends of the Earth Club''' was a group of artists and explorers founded in 1903. Its members included [[Mark Twain]],&lt;ref&gt;"Ends of the Earthers Foregather Here Again:  And Astonish Mark Twain with Some Very Brief Reports," New York Times, Feb. 17, 1906, at 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[General John Pershing]], Admiral [[Robert Peary]],&lt;ref&gt;"Gathered From the Ends of the Earth to Dine," [[New York Times]], March 31, 1904, at 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gutzon Borglum]] (the sculptor of [[Mt. Rushmore]]), [[Herbert Adams Gibbons]] (a Princeton professor and journalist),&lt;ref&gt;"Ends of the Earth Club Dinner, New York Times, Dec. 4, 1920, at 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 100 other prominent businessmen and academics located, primarily, in the northeastern United States.

The group's honorary president was the British adventurer and writer, [[Rudyard Kipling]]. During the first three decades of the twentieth century, the group held an annual dinner at the Savoy Hotel in New York, where its members would meet and exchange stories about foreign travel and politics.&lt;ref name=Fatout&gt;Paul Fatout, ed., Mark Twain Speaking, at 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the group generally favored Anglo American [[colonization]] of the non-European world. [[Mark Twain]] recalled an evening at the club in a dictation recorded on March 7, 1906. During the evening, the chairman of the dinner, General James L. Wilson, proudly told the group that they were "all members of the Anglo-Saxon race." Wilson further commented, "And when the Anglo-Saxon wants something, he takes it."  Twain said that Wilson's comment meant that Englishmen and Americans were "thieves, highwaymen, and pirates – and proud of it."&lt;ref name=Fatout/&gt;

The club was one of at least two such clubs in New York.  The other club was the [[Adventurers' Club of New York]].

'''''Friedelehe''''' is the term for a postulated form of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[marriage]] said to have existed during the [[Early Middle Ages]].  This concept was introduced into mediaeval [[historiography]] during the 1920s by [[Herbert Oskar Meyer|Herbert Meyer]].  There is some controversy as to whether such a marriage form, actually a quasi-marriage,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=VTElDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=Friedelehe+quasi+marriage+Church&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZi6GehvHVAhUHw4MKHY-MAUMQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Friedelehe%20quasi%20marriage%20Church&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; existed but historians who have identified it agree that it was not accepted by the Church.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=DLUzCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT53&amp;dq=Friedelehe+quasi+marriage&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnr7nThfHVAhXI5oMKHR_5APAQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Friedelehe%20quasi%20marriage&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term ''Friedelehe'' means approximately "lover marriage".  The modern German word ''Friedel'' is derived from the [[Old High German]] ''friudil'', which meant "lover", or "sweetheart";&lt;ref&gt;''Deutsches Wörterbuch'' of Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm. 16 Vols, 32 Fasicles]. Leipzig: S. Hirzel 1854-1960. -- Edition of 1971.  Available online 
[http://germazope.uni-trier.de/Projects/WBB/woerterbuecher/dwb/wbgui?lemid=GF09219 here].&lt;/ref&gt; this is in turn derived from ''frijōn'' "to love".  The OHG ''friudil'' was parallel to the [[Old Norse]] ''fridl'', ''frilla'', modern [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''frille'' "lover".

''Friedel'' is compounded with the word ''Ehe'' "marriage", from OHG ''ēha'' or ''ēa'' "marriage", which in turn harks back to the form ''ēwa'', meaning (approximately) cosmic or divine "law".  An OHG form *''friudilēha'' is itself apparently not attested, contributing to the controversy about the authenticity of the modern term.

== Defining characteristics of ''Friedelehe'' according to Meyer ==
According to Herbert Meyer, the characteristics or Friedelehe were: 
* The husband did not become the legal guardian of the woman, in contrast to the ''[[Muntehe]]'', or dowered marriage. 
* The marriage was based on a consensual agreement between husband and wife, that is, both had the desire to marry. 
* The woman had the same right as the man to ask for divorce. 
* ''Friedelehe'' was usually contracted between couples from different social status. 
* ''Friedelehe'' was not synonymous with [[polygyny]], but enabled it. 
* The children of a ''Friedelehe'' were not under the control of the father, but only that of the mother. 
* Children of a ''Friedelehe'' initially enjoyed full inheritance rights; under the growing influence of the church their position was continuously weakened. 
* A ''Friedelehe'' came into being solely by public conveyance of the bride to the groom's domicile and the wedding night consummation; the bride also received a ''[[Dower|Morgengabe]]''. 
* A ''Friedelehe'' was able to be converted into a ''Muntehe'' (dowered or guardianship marriage), if the husband subsequently conveyed [[bridewealth]].

Perhaps the best known historic individual to have been born under a Friedelehe was [[Charlemagne]] who unified much of Europe in the [[Middle Ages]]. Most historians agree that he was born on 2 April 742 while his parents, [[Pepin the Short]] and [[Bertrada of Laon]], were bound under a private contract, not considered to be a legal union; the couple did not marry until 744.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=_U4lDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Charlemagne+date+of+birth+742&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZos_EgfHVAhUFwYMKHRFXDJEQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=illegitimate%20private%20contract&amp;f=false, p=132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=CurSh3Sh_KMC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=Charlemagne+was+arguably+illegitimate+married+Bertrada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9yea78PDVAhWD6oMKHQkjBEMQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Charlemagne%20was%20arguably%20illegitimate%20married%20Bertrada&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; According to Meyer, Friedelehe was declared illegitimate by the Church in the 9th Century.  Nevertheless, vestiges of this form of marriage are said have persisted until modern times reflected in the form of the ''[[Morganatic marriage]]'' (also called ''left-hand marriage''). 

In addition to ''Friedelehe'' there are said to have existed in the Middle Ages the aforementioned ''Muntehe'', ''Kebsehe'' ([[concubinage]]), ''Raubehe'' ([[Raptus|abduction]]) and ''Entführungsehe'' ([[elopement]]),

== Criticism of Meyer's definition ==
According to recent research (among others that of Else Ebel, Karl Heidecker and Andrea Esmyol), indications have accumulated providing evidence to the effect that ''Friedelehe'' is a mere research artifact, a construct that arose from a faulty interpretation of the sources by Meyers.  In particular Esmyol has refuted the basic assumptions of Meyer's definition in her dissertation ''Lover or Wife? Concubines in the Early Middle Ages''. 

The following points of criticism have been raised: 

* After reviewing the Old Norse sources used by Meyer, Ebel can not confirm his conclusions.  In particular she offers the criticism that his citations had been taken out of context, distorting their meaning. 
* According to Esmyol, the textual citations used by Meyer all relate either to concubinage or to dowered marriages, and do not lead to any conclusions about the existence of a freer form of marriage such as ''Friedelehe''. 
* In addition, most of the sources frequently employed by Meyer date from a time in which, even according to his own opinion, ''Friedelehe'' no longer existed. 

That Meyers' theory was still able to prevail in this field of research for decades may be attributed to the specific context in which it developed.  It was, on the one hand, a time in the 19th and early 20th century characterized by the search for historical models for freer choice in the [[free love|amatory realm]]; on the other hand, it was precisely during the time of the [[Nazi]] regime, which was careful to ensure that Meyer's theory was not overlooked, since it fit very well into the Nazi ideology emphasizing Germanic heritage and promoting a higher birthrate (cf.&amp;nbsp;[[Lebensborn]]).

'''''From Russia, with Love''''' is the fifth novel by the English author [[Ian Fleming]] to feature his fictional British [[Secret Intelligence Service|Secret Service]] agent [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]]. Fleming wrote the story in early 1956 at his [[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye estate]] in Jamaica; at the time he thought it might be his final Bond book. The novel was first published in the United Kingdom by [[Jonathan Cape]] on 8 April 1957.

The story centres on a plot by [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]], the Soviet [[counter-intelligence]] agency, to assassinate Bond in such a way as to discredit both him and his organisation. As bait, the Russians use a beautiful cipher clerk and the Spektor, a Soviet decoding machine. Much of the action takes place in [[Istanbul]] and on the [[Orient Express]]. The book was inspired by Fleming's visit to Turkey on behalf of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' to report on an [[Interpol]] conference; he returned to Britain by the Orient Express. ''From Russia, with Love'' deals with the East–West tensions of the [[Cold War]], and the decline of British power and influence in the post-Second World War era.

''From Russia, with Love'' received broadly positive reviews at the time of publication. The book's sales were boosted by an advertising campaign that played upon a visit by the British Prime Minister [[Anthony Eden]] to the Goldeneye estate, and the publication of an article in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', which listed ''From Russia, with Love'' as one of US President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s ten favourite books. The story was serialised in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic strip. In 1963 it was adapted into the [[From Russia with Love (film)|second film]] in the [[James Bond in film|Bond series]], starring [[Sean Connery]].

==Plot==
{{Quote box|quote=Not that it matters, but a great deal of the background to this story is accurate.&amp;nbsp;...

SMERSH, a contraction of Smiert Spionam—Death to Spies—exists and remains today the most secret department of the Soviet government.|source = Ian Fleming, ''From Russia, with Love'', Author's note{{sfn|Fleming|1957|p=6}}|align=right|width=30em|border=1px|salign=right}}

[[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]], the Soviet [[counterintelligence]] agency, plans to commit a grand act of terrorism in the intelligence field. For this, it targets the British secret service agent [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]]. Due in part to his role in the defeat of the SMERSH agents [[Le Chiffre]], Mr Big and [[Hugo Drax]], Bond has been listed as an enemy of the Soviet state and a "death warrant" is issued for him. His death is planned to precipitate a major sex scandal, which will run in the world press for months and leave his and his service's reputations in tatters. Bond's killer is to be the SMERSH executioner Red Grant, a psychopath whose homicidal urges coincide with the full moon. Kronsteen, SMERSH's chess-playing master planner, and Colonel [[Rosa Klebb]], the head of Operations and Executions, devise the operation. They instruct an attractive young cipher clerk, Corporal [[Tatiana Romanova]], to falsely defect from her post in [[Istanbul]] having, she would claim, fallen in love with Bond after seeing a photograph on his file. As an added lure for Bond, Romanova will provide the British with a Spektor, a Russian decoding device much coveted by [[MI6]]. She is not told the details of the plan.

[[File:Orient Express 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Orient Express]], on which Bond travelled from Istanbul to Paris]]
The offer of defection is received by MI6 in London, ostensibly from Romanova, but is conditional that Bond collects her and the Spektor from Istanbul. MI6 is unsure of Romanova's motive, but the prize of the Spektor is too tempting to ignore; Bond's superior, [[M (James Bond)|M]], orders him to go to Turkey. Once there, Bond forms a comradeship with Darko Kerim, head of the British service's station in Turkey. Bond meets Romanova and they plan their route out of Turkey with the Spektor. He and Kerim believe her story and the three board the [[Orient Express]]. Kerim quickly discovers three Russian [[Ministry of State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]] agents on board, travelling incognito. He uses bribes and trickery to have two of them taken off the train, but he is later found dead in his compartment with the body of the third MGB agent.

At [[Trieste]] a fellow MI6 agent, "Captain Nash", introduces himself and Bond presumes he has been sent by M as added protection for the rest of the trip. Romanova is suspicious of Nash, but Bond reassures her that the man is from his own service. After dinner, at which Nash has drugged Romanova, they rest. Bond is woken with a weapon pointing at him and Nash reveals himself to be the killer Grant. Instead of killing Bond immediately, he describes SMERSH's plan. He is to shoot Bond through the heart and dispose of Romanova after leaving a film of their love-making in the luggage; in addition, the Spektor is booby-trapped to explode when examined. As Grant talks, Bond places his metal cigarette case between the pages of a book he holds in front of him, positioning it in front of his heart to stop the bullet. After Grant fires, Bond collapses to the floor and, when Grant steps over him, he attacks and kills the assassin. Bond and Romanova escape.

Later, in Paris, after successfully delivering Romanova and the booby-trapped Spektor to his superiors, Bond meets Rosa Klebb. She is captured but manages to kick Bond with a poisoned blade concealed in her shoe; the story ends with Bond fighting for breath and falling to the floor.

==Background and writing history==
By January 1956 the author [[Ian Fleming]] had published three novels—''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' in 1953, ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'' in 1954 and ''[[Moonraker (novel)|Moonraker]]'' in 1955. A fourth, ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (novel)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'', was being edited and prepared for production.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|pp=268–69}}&lt;ref name="IFP: Books" /&gt;{{efn|''Diamonds Are Forever'' was published in March 1956.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=289}} }} That month Fleming travelled to his [[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye estate]] in Jamaica to write ''From Russia, with Love''. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in ''[[Hansom Books|Books and Bookmen]]'' magazine: "I write for about three hours in the morning&amp;nbsp;... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written&amp;nbsp;... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day."{{sfn|Faulks|Fleming|2009|p=320}} He returned to London in March that year with a 228-page first-draft manuscript{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=101}} that he subsequently altered more heavily than any of his other works.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=13}}{{sfn|Fleming|Higson|2006|p=v}} One of the significant re-writes changed Bond's fate; Fleming had become disenchanted with his books{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=14}} and wrote to his friend, the American author [[Raymond Chandler]]: "My muse is in a very bad way&amp;nbsp;... I am getting fed up with Bond and it has been very difficult to make him go through his tawdry tricks."{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=209}} Fleming re-wrote the end of the novel in April 1956 to make Klebb poison Bond, which allowed him to finish the series with the death of the character if he wanted.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Breathing became difficult. Bond sighed to the depth of his lungs. He clenched his jaws and half closed his eyes, as people do when they want to hide their drunkenness.&amp;nbsp;... He prised his eyes open.&amp;nbsp;... Now he had to gasp for breath. Again his hand moved up towards his cold face. He had an impression of Mathis starting towards him. Bond felt his knees begin to buckle&amp;nbsp;... [he] pivoted slowly on his heel and crashed head-long to the wine-red floor.&lt;p&gt;
''From Russia, with Love'', novel's closing lines&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fleming's first draft ended with Bond and Romanova enjoying a romance.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=293}} By January 1957 Fleming had decided he would write another story, and began work on ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]'' in which Bond recovers from his poisoning and is sent to Jamaica.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|pp=307–08}}

Fleming's trip to Istanbul in June 1955 to cover an [[Interpol]] conference for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' was a source of much of the background information in the story.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|pp=96–97}} While there he met the Oxford-educated ship owner Nazim Kalkavan, who became the model for Darko Kerim;{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=12}} Fleming took down many of Kalkavan's conversations in a notebook, and used them verbatim in the novel.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|pp=96–97}}{{efn|While in Turkey, Fleming wrote an account of the [[Istanbul pogrom]]s, "The Great Riot of Istanbul", which was published in ''The Sunday Times'' on 11 September 1955.&lt;ref name="Fleming: Istanbul" /&gt;}}

Although Fleming did not date the event within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom wrote books for [[Ian Fleming Publications]]—have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the [[List of James Bond novels and short stories|novel series]] as a whole. Chancellor put the events of ''From Russia, with Love'' in 1955; Griswold considers the story to have taken place between June and August 1954.{{sfn|Griswold|2006|p=13}}{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|pp=98–99}}

In August 1956, for fifty [[Guinea (coin)|guineas]], Fleming commissioned [[Richard Chopping]] to provide the art for the cover, based on Fleming's design; the result won a number of prizes.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=16}}{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=300}} After ''Diamonds Are Forever'' had been published in March 1956, Fleming received a letter from a thirty-one-year-old Bond enthusiast and gun expert, [[Geoffrey Boothroyd]], criticising the author's choice of firearm for Bond.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wish to point out that a man in James Bond's position would never consider using a .25 Beretta. It's really a lady's gun—and not a very nice lady at that! Dare I suggest that Bond should be armed with a .38 or a nine millimetre—let's say a German Walther PPK? That's far more appropriate.&lt;ref name="DT: Boothroyd" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Boothroyd's suggestions came too late to be included in ''From Russia, with Love'', but one of his guns—a .38 [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] [[snubnosed revolver]] modified with one third of the trigger guard removed—was used as the model for Chopping's image.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=160}} Fleming later thanked Boothroyd by naming the armourer in [[Dr. No (novel)|''Dr. No'']] Major Boothroyd.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=15}}

==Development==

===Plot inspirations===
[[File:Enigma-G.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A mechanical machine, much like an old-fashioned typewriter, is in a wooden box|The [[Enigma machine]] was used as the basis for the fictional Soviet Spektor decoding machine]]

As with several of his works, Fleming appropriated the names or backgrounds of people he knew or had heard of for the story's characters: Red Grant, a Jamaican river guide—whom Fleming's biographer [[Andrew Lycett]] described as "a cheerful, voluble giant of villainous aspect"—was used for the half-German, half-Irish assassin.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=282}}{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=90}} Rosa Klebb was partly based on Colonel Rybkin—a real-life member of the Lenin Military-Political Academy about whom Fleming had written an article for ''The Sunday Times''.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=93}}{{sfn|Halloran|1986|p=163}} The Spektor machine used as the bait for Bond was not a [[Cold War]] device, but had its roots in the Second World War [[Enigma machine]], which Fleming had tried to obtain while serving in the [[Naval Intelligence Division]].{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=97}}

The idea of the Orient Express came from two sources: Fleming had returned from the Istanbul conference in 1955 by the train, but found the experience drab, partly because the restaurant car was closed.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=12}}{{sfn|Black|2005|p=30}} He also knew of the story of Eugene Karp and his journey on the Orient Express: Karp was a US naval attaché and intelligence agent based in Budapest who, in February 1950, took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris, carrying a number of papers about blown US spy networks in the [[Eastern Bloc]]. Soviet assassins were already on the train. The conductor was drugged and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of [[Salzburg]].{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=96}} Fleming had a long-standing interest in trains and, following his involvement in a near-fatal crash in 1927, associated them with danger; they also feature in ''Live and Let Die'', ''Diamonds Are Forever'' and ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]''.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=16}}

The cultural historian [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] points out that ''From Russia, with Love'' was written and published at a time when tensions between East and West were on the rise and public awareness of the Cold War was high. A [[Operation Gold|joint British and American operation]] to tap into landline communication of the [[Soviet Army]] headquarters in Berlin using a tunnel into the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet-occupied zone]] had been publicly uncovered by the Soviets in April 1956. The same month the diver [[Lionel Crabb]] had gone missing on a mission to photograph the propeller of the Soviet cruiser ''Ordzhonikidze'' while the ship was moored in [[Portsmouth Harbour]], an incident that was much reported and discussed in British newspapers. In October and November that year a [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|popular uprising]] in Hungary was repressed by Soviet forces.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=28}}

===Characters===
To make Bond a more rounded character, Fleming put further aspects of his personality into his creation. The journalist and writer Matthew Parker observes that Bond's "physical and mental ennui" is a reflection of Fleming's poor health and low spirits when he wrote the book.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=208}}{{sfn|Panek|1981|p=316}} The early depictions of Bond were based on earlier literary characters. In ''[[New Statesman]]'', the journalist William Cook writes of the early Bond:

&lt;blockquote&gt;James Bond is the culmination of an important but much-maligned tradition in English literature. As a boy, Fleming devoured the [[Bulldog Drummond]] tales of Lieutenant Colonel [[H. C. McNeile|Herman Cyril McNeile]] (aka "Sapper") and the [[Richard Hannay]] stories of [[John Buchan]]. His genius was to repackage these antiquated adventures to fit the fashion of postwar Britain&amp;nbsp;... In Bond, he created a Bulldog Drummond for the jet age.&lt;ref name="Cook (2004)" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following on from the character development of Bond in his previous four novels, Fleming adds further background to Bond's private life, largely around his home life and personal habits, with Bond's introduction to the story seeing him at breakfast with his housekeeper, May.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=106}} The novelist [[Raymond Benson]]—who later wrote a series of Bond novels—sees aspects of self-doubt entering Bond's mind with the "soft" life he has been leading when he is introduced in the book. Benson identifies Bond's fear when the flight to Istanbul encounters severe turbulence from a storm, and notes Bond's apparent nervousness when he first meets Romanova; he seems concerned and guilty about his mission.{{sfn|Benson|1988|pp=106–07}} The other characters in the book are also well developed, according to Benson. He considers that the head of the Turkish office, Darko Kerim Bey, is "one of Fleming's more colourful characters"; Kerim is a similar type of dependable and appealing ally that Fleming also created with Quarrel (in ''Live and Let Die'') and Colombo (in the short story "[[Risico]]").{{sfn|Benson|1988|pp=107–08}} Parker considers that Kerim is "an antidote" to Bond's lethargy,{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=209}} while the essayist [[Umberto Eco]] sees the character as having some of the moral qualities of the villains in the series, but that those qualities are used in support of Bond.{{sfn|Eco|2009|p=39}}&lt;ref name="Synnott: Beauty" /&gt;

''From Russia, with Love'' is one of the few stories by Fleming in which the Soviets are the main enemy,{{sfn|Panek|1981|p=208}} although Eco considers Bond's Russian opponents "so monstrous, so improbably evil that it seems impossible to take them seriously".{{sfn|Eco|2009|p=46}} Fleming introduced what was a new development for him, a female opponent for Bond, although much like the former adversaries in the series, Rosa Klebb is described as being physically repulsive, with poor hygiene and gross tastes.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=108}}{{sfn|Black|2005|pp=28–29}} Eco—and Anthony Synnott, in his examination of aesthetics in the Bond novels—consider that despite Klebb being female, the character is more akin to a "sexually neuter" individual.{{sfn|Eco|2009|p=39}} Red Grant was Fleming's first "psychotic opponent" for Bond, according to Benson.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=108}} [[Charlie Higson]]—who later wrote the [[Young Bond]] series—finds Grant to be "a very modern villain: the relentless, remorseless psycho with the cold dead eyes of a 'drowned man'."{{sfn|Fleming|Higson|2006|p=vii}}

==Style==
According to Higson, Fleming spent the first four novels changing the style of his books, and his approach to his characters, but in ''From Russia, with Love'' the author "finally hits on the classic Bond formula, and he happily moved into his most creative phase".{{sfn|Fleming|Higson|2006|p=vi}} The literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek observes that the previous novels were, in essence, episodic detective stories, while ''From Russia, with Love'' is structured differently, with an "extended opening picture" that describes Grant, the Russians and Romanova before moving onto the main story and then bringing back some of the elements when least expected.{{sfn|Panek|1981|pp=212–13}} The extensive prose that describes the Soviet opponents and the background to the mission takes up the first ten chapters of the book, and Bond is only introduced into the story in chapter eleven.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=105}} Eco identifies that the opening passage introducing Red Grant is a "cleverly presented" beginning, similar to the opening of a film.{{efn|The narrative describes Grant as an immobile man, lying by a swimming pool, waiting to be massaged; it has no direct connection to the main storyline.{{sfn|Eco|2009|p=51}}}} Eco remarks that "Fleming abounds in such passages of high technical skill".{{sfn|Eco|2009|p=51}}

Benson describes the "Fleming Sweep" as taking the reader from one chapter to another using "hooks" at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader onto the next.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=85}} He feels that the "Fleming Sweep steadily propels the plot" of ''From Russia, with Love'' and, though it was the longest of Fleming's novels, "the Sweep makes it seem half as long".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=105}} [[Kingsley Amis]], who later wrote a Bond novel, considers that the story is "full of pace and conviction",{{sfn|Amis|1966|pp=154–55}} while Parker identifies "cracks" in the plot of the novel, but believes that "the action mov[es] fast enough for the reader to skim over them".{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=198}}

Fleming used known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism,{{sfn|Faulks|Fleming|2009|p=320}}{{sfn|Butler|1973|p=241}} which Amis calls "the Fleming effect".{{sfn|Amis|1966|p=112}} Amis describes "the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond's world&amp;nbsp;... [is] bolted down to some sort of reality, or at least counter-balanced."{{sfn|Amis|1966|pp=111–12}}

==Themes==
The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and [[Tony Bennett (sociologist)|Tony Bennett]] consider that Fleming's preface note—in which he informs readers that "a great deal of the background to this story is accurate"—indicates that in this novel "cold war tensions are most massively present, saturating the narrative from beginning to end".{{sfn|Bennett|Woollacott|1987|p=28}} As in ''Casino Royale'', the concept of the loss of British power and influence during the post-Second World War and Cold War period was also present in the novel.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=113}} The journalist William Cook observes that, with the British Empire in decline "Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight."&lt;ref name="Cook (2004)" /&gt; Woollacott and Bennett agree, and maintain that "Bond embodied the imaginary possibility that England might once again be placed at the centre of world affairs during a period when its world power status was visibly and rapidly declining."{{sfn|Bennett|Woollacott|1987|p=28}} In ''From Russia, with Love'', this acknowledgement of decline manifested itself in Bond's conversations with Darko Kerim when he admits that in England "we don't show teeth any more—only gums."{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=113}}{{sfn|Fleming|Higson|2006|p=227}}

Woollacott and Bennett argue that in selecting Bond as the target for the Russians, he is "deemed the most consummate embodiment of the myth of England".{{sfn|Bennett|Woollacott|1987|p=138}} The literary critic [[Meir Sternberg]] sees the theme of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] running through several of the Bond stories, including ''From Russia, with Love''. He sees Bond as [[Saint George]]—the [[patron saint]] of England—in the story, and notes that the opening chapter begins with an examination of a [[dragonfly]] as it flies over the supine body of Grant.&lt;ref name="Style: Dragon" /&gt;{{efn|Sternberg also points out that in ''Moonraker'', Bond's opponent is named Drax ({{lang|de|Drache}} is German for dragon), while in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' (1963) the character Marc-Ange Draco's surname is Latin for dragon, and in ''From Russia, with Love'' Darko Kerim's first name is "an anagrammatic variation on the same cover name".&lt;ref name="Style: Dragon" /&gt;}}

''From Russia, with Love'' was released in the UK as a hardback on 8 April 1957, by the publishers [[Jonathan Cape]].&lt;ref name="Richardson (1957)"/&gt; The American edition was published a few weeks later by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=16}}&lt;ref name="Boucher (1957)" /&gt; Fleming was pleased with the book and later said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Personally I think ''from Russia, with Love'' was, in many respects, my best book, but the great thing is that each one of the books seems to have been a favourite with one or other section of the public and none has yet been completely damned.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=97}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 1956 the Prime Minister, [[Anthony Eden|Sir Anthony Eden]], had visited Fleming's Jamaican Goldeneye estate, to recuperate from a breakdown in his health. This was much reported in the British press,{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=15}} and the publication of ''From Russia, with Love'' was accompanied by a promotional campaign that capitalised on Fleming's raised public profile.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=313}} The serialisation of the story in ''[[Daily Express|The Daily Express]]'' in 1957 provided a boost to the sales of the book;{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=16}} a bigger rise in sales was to follow four years later. In an article in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' on 17 March 1961, the US President [[John F. Kennedy]] listed ''From Russia, with Love'' as one of his ten favourite books.&lt;ref name="Time: Kennedy" /&gt;{{efn|Kennedy's brother [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert]] was also an avid reader of the Bond novels, as was [[Allen Dulles]], the [[Director of Central Intelligence]].{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=260, 262}}}} This accolade, and its associated publicity, led to a surge in sales that made Fleming the biggest-selling crime writer in the US.{{sfn|Fleming|Higson|2006|p=vi}}{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=383}} There was a further boost to sales following the release of the [[From Russia with Love (film)|film of the same name]] in 1963, which saw the sales of the [[Pan Books|Pan]] paperback rise from 145,000 in 1962 to 642,000 in 1963 and 600,000 in 1964.{{sfn|Bennett|Woollacott|2009|pp=17, 21}}

===Reception===
''From Russia, with Love'' received mainly positive reviews from critics.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=239}} [[Julian Symons]], in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', considered that it was Fleming's "tautest, most exciting and most brilliant tale", that the author "brings the thriller in line with modern emotional needs", and that Bond "is the intellectual's [[Mike Hammer]]: a killer with a keen eye and a soft heart for a woman".&lt;ref name="Symons (1957)" /&gt; The critic for ''[[The Times]]'' was less persuaded by the story, suggesting that "the general tautness and brutality of the story leave the reader uneasily hovering between fact and fiction".&lt;ref name="Times (1957)" /&gt; Although the review compared Fleming in unflattering terms to [[Peter Cheyney]], a [[crime fiction]] writer of the 1930s and 1940s, it concluded that ''From Russia, with Love'' was "exciting enough of its kind".&lt;ref name="Times (1957)"/&gt;

''[[The Observer]]''{{'}}s critic, Maurice Richardson, thought that ''From Russia, with Love'' was a "stupendous plot to trap&amp;nbsp;... Bond, our deluxe cad-clubman agent" and wondered "Is this the end of Bond?"&lt;ref name="Richardson (1957)" /&gt; The reviewer for the ''[[Oxford Mail]]'' declared that "Ian Fleming is in a class by himself",{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=97}} while the critic for ''The Sunday Times'' argued that "If a psychiatrist and a thoroughly efficient copywriter got together to produce a fictional character who would be the mid-twentieth century subconscious male ambition, the result would inevitably be James Bond."{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=97}}

Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Anthony Boucher]]—described by a Fleming biographer, [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]], as "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"{{sfn|Pearson|1967|p=99}}—was damning in his review, saying that ''From Russia, with Love'' was Fleming's "longest and poorest book".&lt;ref name="Boucher (1957)" /&gt; Boucher further wrote that the novel contained "as usual, sex-cum-sadism with a veneer of literacy but without the occasional brilliant setpieces".&lt;ref name="Boucher (1957)"/&gt; The critic for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', conversely, wrote that "Mr Fleming is intensely observant, acutely literate and can turn a cliché into a silk purse with astute alchemy".{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=97}} Robert R Kirsch, writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', also disagreed with Boucher, saying that "the espionage novel has been brought up to date by a superb practitioner of that nearly lost art: Ian Fleming."&lt;ref name="Kirsch (1957)" /&gt; In Kirsch's opinion, ''From Russia, with Love'' "has everything of the traditional plus the most modern refinements in the sinister arts of spying".&lt;ref name="Kirsch (1957)"/&gt;

==Adaptations==
{{see also|James Bond (comic strip)}}

''From Russia, with Love'' was serialised in ''The Daily Express'' from 1 April 1957;&lt;ref name="D Exp serial" /&gt; it was the first Bond novel the paper had adapted.{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=16}} In 1960 the novel was also adapted as a daily [[comic strip]] in the paper and was syndicated worldwide. The series, which ran from 3 February to 21 May 1960,{{sfn|Fleming|Gammidge|McLusky|1988|p=6}} was written by [[Henry Gammidge]] and illustrated by [[John McLusky]].{{sfn|McLusky|Gammidge|Hern|Fleming|2009|p=5}} The comic strip was reprinted in 2005 by [[Titan Books]] in the ''Dr. No'' anthology, which also included ''Diamonds Are Forever'' and ''Casino Royale''.{{sfn|McLusky|Gammidge|Hern|Fleming|2009|p=135}}

The film ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' was released in 1963, produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], and directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]]. It was the second Bond film in the [[Eon Productions]] series and starred [[Sean Connery]] as Bond.&lt;ref name="Brooke BFI" /&gt; The film version contained some changes to the novel, with the leading villains switching from SMERSH to [[SPECTRE]], a fictional terrorist organisation.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=21}} In the main it was a faithful adaptation of the novel; the ending was changed to make clear Bond's survival. Benson declares that "many fans consider it ''the'' best Bond film, simply because it is close to Fleming's original story".{{sfn|Benson|1988|pp=172–74}}

The novel was dramatised for radio in 2012 by Archie Scottney, directed by [[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]] and produced by [[Rosalind Ayres]]; it featured a full cast starring [[Toby Stephens]] as James Bond and was first broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]]. It continued the series of Bond radio adaptations featuring Jarvis and Stephens following [[Dr. No (novel)|''Dr. No'']] in 2008 and [[Goldfinger (novel)|''Goldfinger'']] in 2010.&lt;ref name="BBC adaps" /&gt;

The '''Hartford Club''' is a [[Gentlemen's club|private club]] at 46 Prospect Street in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and founded in 1873.&lt;ref name=nrhpinv3/&gt;

==History==
The Hartford Club began as a union of local men's clubs amalgamated due to financial woes. It began admitting women members in the 1970s. Its present clubhouse, located at 46 Prospect Street, was designed in 1901 by [[Robert D. Andrews]] of [[Andrews, Jacques and Rantoul]] and was completed in 1903.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=84000779}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Hartford Club |date=January 19, 1984 |author=David F. Ransom |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NRHP url|id=84000779|title=''Accompanying photo from 1982''|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened on January 1, 1908.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;&lt;ref name=nrhpinv3/&gt;&lt;ref name=HartfordDntnMRA&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=64000093}} |title=Hartford Downtown MRA|author=David F. Ransom and John Herzan |date=January 19, 1984 |publisher=[[National Park Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club provides dining rooms, private banquet and meeting rooms, concierge services for members, and members' activities.

==Architecture==
The clubhouse is located in downtown Hartford, on the east side of Prospect Street, across from the [[Travelers Tower]] and one block south of the [[Old State House (Connecticut)|Old State House]]. It is a three-story Georgian Revival building, slightly larger in size than domestic mansions of the period that were built in a similar style.  It has a broad five-bay facade, with slightly projecting end bays.  The ground-floor end windows are three-part Palladian style windows with narrow sidelights, and the center entrance has a series of elaborate projecting elements supported by Corinthian columns.  Second-floor windows are set in openings with half-round tops set in recessed panels; the outer windows have the arched section filled with moulded decorative panels.&lt;ref name=nrhpinv3/&gt;

The clubhouse was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

==History==

===History until the Ottoman conquest===
[[Robert H. Hewsen]] shows the region where today's [[Hemşin]] is located to be populated by a people with different designations throughout the ancient and early medieval history. He indicates thereby that some designations may have alternative forms and partially presents the names used with question marks. In summary from 13th century to 6th century BC [[Colchis|Colchians]],&lt;ref name="Hewsen"&gt;[[Robert H. Hewsen|Hewsen, Robert H.]]. ''Armenia: A Historical Atlas''. Chicago: University Of Chicago Press, 2000, maps 10, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; 550 to 330 BC Colchians and [[Macrones]],&lt;ref&gt;Hewsen. ''Armenia'', map 17.&lt;/ref&gt; 180 BC to 14 AD [[Laz people|Lazoi]] (Chani/Tzan tribes),&lt;ref&gt;Hewsen. ''Armenia'', map 21.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Arsacid Period (63–298 AD) [[Heniochi]], [[Machelones]], Heptakometians, [[Mossynoeci]]&lt;ref&gt;Hewsen. ''Armenia'', map 42.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Sanni]], [[Drilae]] and Macrones&lt;ref&gt;Hewsen. ''Armenia'', map 55.&lt;/ref&gt; are mentioned.

The Hemşin region is shown as part of [[Colchis]] (299–387),&lt;ref&gt;Hewsen. ''Armenia'', map 62.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tzans|Tzanica]] (387–591)&lt;ref&gt;Hewsen. ''Armenia'', map 65.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Chaldia]] (654–750).&lt;ref&gt;Hewsen. ''Armenia'', map 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The specific location of Hemşin is indicated as Tambur/Hamamašen as a fort and town for the first time in the map covering the period 654–750.

Those two names (Tambur and Hamamašen) are included in the ''History of Taron'' by [[John Mamikonean]] in a short passage&lt;ref&gt;[http://rbedrosian.com/jm6.htm]: "As soon as [Tiran] read the letter, another letter arrived the same day from Vashdean's sister's son, Hamam, acquainting [Tiran] with the treachery before him from the troops who had come from Iran. He immediately wrote a letter to Vashdean reprimanding him for his plot. Vashdean grew angry and had Hamam's feet and hands lopped off. Then, taking the Iranians, [Vashdean] crossed the Chorox river and went to Hamam's city, named Tambur, which he attacked with fire and sword and enslaved. Now the blessed bishop of the city, Manknos, severely cursed the prince. [Vashdean] ordered the Iranians to kill the priests in the church named Holy Zion. The bishop had silently prayed to God to ask only that the city be turned into a desert and a ruin and that for all eternity no one reside there. He threw himself on the altar and [the Iranlans] sacrificed him on Pentecost before mass was offered to Christ. On the next day there was a cloudburst and [Vashdean] was consumed by fire as he sat by the city gates of Tambur. Hamam subsequently [re]built this [city] calling it after himself, Hamamashen. And Mangnos' prayer was realized. In one night 3,000 men died, others fled, and the city remained a ruin."
&lt;/ref&gt; about a war between the ruler of Tambur, Hamam, and his maternal uncle the Georgian Prince, which resulted in the destruction of the town to be rebuilt by Hamam and be named after him namely Hamamshen. This event is declared by [[Mamikonian]] to have taken place in early seventh century. Hamamashen became Hamshen over time. [[Hovann Simonian|Simonian]] who conveys this story reports also that the date given by the author may be wrong.&lt;ref name="Simonian"&gt;Simonian, Hovann H. "Hamshen Before Hemshin: The Prelude to Islamicization", in ''The Hemshin'', pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other Armenian chronicles Ghewond and [[Stepanos Asoghik]] of Taron, report in short passages in their histories about a migration from Armenia/Oshakan led by prince Shapuh [[Amatuni]] and his son Hamam. Ghewond conveys this immigration to be to avoid heavy taxes imposed on Armenians by the Arab rulers. The [[Amatuni]] lords are offered fertile land to settle down by the Byzantine Emperor, after they crossed the Corukh river. This migration is dated to be after 789 by Ghewond and as 750 by Stephen Asoghik of Taron.&lt;ref name="Simonian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rbedrosian.com/ghew9.htm]: "[Sulaiman] so increased the yoke [of taxation] on people that they could not endure it. For even if they gave all that they possessed, it was not enough to save themselves. This same Sulaiman sent to the city of Dwin his son-in-law, a certain Ibn Ducas (Ibndoke'), an impious and malevolent man, son of one of his maid-servants, who was of Greek nationality. He imposed unendurably heavy taxes on the residents of our land. All the lords, common folk, bishops and the kat'oghikos Esayi [Esayi I Eghipatrushets'i, 775-788] came and pleaded with [Ibn Ducas] to reduce the onerous level of taxation, but it was of no avail. For the wrath of the Lord had delivered the Christians into merciless hands. [Ibn Ducas instead] sent tax collectors to the different parts of the land with the order to double the yearly collection and to take it immediately, and they implemented the command. Once this was accomplished, this son of satan devised another wicked scheme. He had lead seals put around the necks of everyone, demanding many zuzas for each [seal]. Thus did this wicked executioner reduce everyone to the worst extremes of bankruptcy through his intolerant measures. [g167]."&lt;/ref&gt;

Benninghaus specifies "Tambur" as the destination of the migration led by Hamam and his father Shapuh Amaduni and says that they have seemingly met people there who were already Christians, possibly Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews. ''Ethnic Groups in the Republic of Turkey'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Redgate informs about possible symbolism used in the Ghewond’s history and possible garbling in Mamikonian’s history, and cautions not to take everything at face value.&lt;ref&gt;Redgate, Anne Elizabeth. "Morale, Cohesion and Power in the First Centuries of Amatuni Hamshen", in ''The Hemshin'', pp. 3-13&lt;/ref&gt; Hachikian states “There is no clue as to where Tambur, the legendary capital of Hamshen, was located. The only certain thing about it is that it clearly belonged to a much earlier time- if it existed at all”.&lt;ref&gt;Hachikian. "Notes", p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentions in the footnote the name similarity between Tambur and a yayla known as Tahpur or Tagpur, in the heights of Kaptanpasa. Simonian states that Tambur is probably in the vicinity of Varoşkale (altitude 1800 m).&lt;ref&gt;Simonian. "Hamshen Before Hemshin", p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

A description of "Haynsen" in the [[Kingdom of Georgia]], its inhabitants and history is contained in "La Fleur des histoires de la terre d'Orient" by Hetu'm of Corycos, written around 1307, translated into English in 1520, and later reproduced in the travellers' tales of Samuel Purchas published in 1614. Purrchas uses the term "Hamsem" to designate the region and concludes that this is the place of the original Cimmerian gloom of [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]]&lt;ref&gt;Redgate. "Morale, Cohesion and Power", p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/modernity/purchas.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728233753/http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/modernity/purchas.html |archivedate=2008-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The translation of He'tum's related passage to modern English uses the term Hamshen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rbedrosian.com/hetumint.htm|title=Het'um, Medieval Geography of Asia, History, Historical, Cilicia, Cilician, Armenia, Armenian, Geography, Asia, Central, Far East, Traveler, Traveller, Saljuq, Seljuq, Seljluk, Byzantine, Iran, Persia, Iranian, Persian, Turkey, Turkish, Turco-Mongolica, Altaica, Armenian Highlands, Georgia,  Georgian, Mongol, Mongols, Mamluks, Cilician Armenia, Crusades, Hetum the Historian, History of the Tartars|publisher=|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He'tum describes the region to be "miraculous and strange place" unbelievable unless seen by own eyes, dark and without roads. Signs of human settlement are that "...&amp;nbsp;People in those parts say that one frequently hears the sounds of men bellowing, of cocks crowing, of horses neighing in the forest," Those people are described by He'tum, leaning upon Georgian and Armenian Histories, to be the descendants of the men of the "wicked" Iranian Emperor Shaworeos who had chased and harassed Christian people.

The referenced translation suggests this Emperor could be [[Shapur II|Shapuhr II]], [309–379].&lt;ref&gt;
There is a miraculous and strange place in the realm of Georgia which&amp;mdash;had I not seen it with by own eyes&amp;mdash;I would neither dare to speak about it nor to believe in it. But since I was there in person and saw it, I shall discuss it. There is a district named Hamshen in that area, its circumference being a three day's journey. And despite the district's extent, the place is so foggy and dark that no one can see anything. For no road goes through it. People in those parts say that one frequently hears the sounds of men bellowing, of cocks crowing, of horses neighing in the forest, and the murmuring of a river which flows thence. These are all regarded as trustworthy signs there that a settlement of people exists in the area.

This much is true: [g15] in the histories of the kingdoms of Armenia and Georgia it may be read that a certain wicked Emperor Shaworeos [?Shapuhr II, A.D. 309-79], an idolator and ferocious persecutor of Christians, one day ordered that all the inhabitants of Asia come and worship the idols. Those who ignored the command were to be burned with fire. Whereupon it transpired that some of the Christians chose martyrdom to worshipping the idols. Some chose to convert temporarily and, out of fear, worshipped the idols, so that they not be deprived of their lives and worldly goods. Meanwhile others took to the mountains and deserted places and somehow kept themselves alive. The group of the best Christians who lived in the Moghon [Mughan] plain thought to leave their belongings and to pass to Greece [Byzantium]. While they were so resolved, the [Persian] Emperor arose before them, ordering that those refusing to sacrifice to the idols should be pulled apart, limb by limb. Now the people cried out to the Lord Jesus Christ and, going by the straight path, they survived. However, the infidels have resided in that gloomy valley to the present. [And then the Christians made a great cry to Our Lord God, and soon after came this great darkness that blinded the Emperor and all his men; and so the Christian men escaped, and the Emperor with his men tarried in the darkness. oe15] And they must stay there until the end of the world. So it is believed by everyone, and so it is related. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Simonian considers the so described difficulty in access not to imply total isolation. On the contrary, he reports, Hamshen served sometimes as a transit route between the coastal regions and the Armenian plateau.&lt;ref&gt;Simonian. "Hamshen Before Hemshin", p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further theories of medieval settlement to Hamshen are that: 
*Following the Seljuk invasions. the Armenians of [[Ani]] have fled to Hemshin which had never seen any human face before;
*There has been continuous influx of Armenians from the south following the initial settlement; resulting in an armenization of the area through expelling local [[Laz people|Laz]] or [[Tzans|Tzan]] population;
*The armenization of the Laz or Tzan people took place through Armenian ruling dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;Simonian. "Hamshen Before Hemshin", pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his analysis of the literary and non-literary sources from the 8th through the 19th centuries, combined with excursions into Hamšēn during the 1980s to identify the surviving Armenian architecture, Dr. Robert W. Edwards has defined the geographical perimeters of that region and assessed the historical impact of its extreme isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Edwards, “Hamšēn: An Armenian Enclave in the Byzanto-Georgian Pontos.  A Survey of Literary and Nonliterary Sources,” ''Le Muséon'' vol.101, fasc.3-4, 1988, pp.403-422.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources of the ruling powers in the region, (Byzantine, Trapezuntine, Georgian, Armenian and Turkish) are silent about Hemshin; until the conquest by the Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;Simonian. "Hamshen Before Hemshin", pp. 26, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; It is deduced that Hemşin has been governed by local lords under the umbrella of the greater regional powers changing by the time namely the Bagratid Armenian kingdom, the Byzantine Empire, its successor the Empire of Trebizond, the Georgian Kingdom, the Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu Turkmen Confederations&lt;ref&gt;Simonian. "Hamshen Before Hemshin", p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; until it was annexed by the Ottoman Empire which collapsed as a result of the World War I and gave birth to the Republic of Turkey.

The Ottoman conquest of Hemshin occurred sometime in the 1480s: an Ottoman register dated around 1486 calls it ''Hemshin'' and mentions it as being an Ottoman possession.&lt;ref&gt;Simonian. "Hamshen Before Hemshin", p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkish dominance and division===
[[Turkish people|Turkish]] influence was firmly established in the region after the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, after which the [[Seljuk Turks]] and other [[Anatolian Turkish Beyliks|Turkish tribes]] gained a strong foothold in [[Central Anatolia]] and Western [[Armenian Highlands]], often referred to as [[Eastern Anatolia]], bringing the local population in contact with the religion of [[Islam]]. In the 15th century, the region of Hamshen was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the Turkish rule, two most important developments are [[human migration]]s and [[Religious conversion|conversions]].&lt;ref&gt;Simonian. "Hamshen Before Hemshin," pp. 61, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beller-Hann, Ildiko. "Hemshinli-Lazi Relations in Northeast Turkey", in ''The Hemshin'', p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; Most sources agree that prior to Ottoman era majority of the residents of Hemshin were [[Christianity|Christian]] and members of the Armenian Apostolic Church. The details and the accompanying circumstances for the migrations and the [[Religious conversion|conversions]] during the Ottoman era are not clearly known or documented.&lt;ref&gt;Simonian. "Hamshen Before Hemshin," p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simonian. "Hemshin from Islamicization", pp. 52, 58, 61-66, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of those developments, distinctive communities with the same generic name have also appeared in the vicinity of [[Hopa]], [[Turkey]] as well as in the [[Caucasus]]. Those three communities are almost oblivious to one another's existence.&lt;ref&gt;Awde, Nicholas. "Foreword" in ''The Hemshin'', p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''Hemshinli''' of Hemshin proper (also designated occasionally as '''western Hemshinli''' in publications) are [[Turkish language|Turkish]]-speaking [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] who mostly live in the counties (ilçe) of [[Çamlıhemşin]], [[Çayeli]], [[İkizdere]], [[Pazar, Rize|Pazar]] and [[Hemşin]] in Turkey's [[Rize Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=cl6QAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PR22&amp;dq=The%20Hemshin&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OqZmVYWeBYv3UOKcg8gM&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Hemshin&amp;f=false|title=The Hemshin: History, Society and Identity in the Highlands of Northeast Turkey|first=Hovann|last=Simonian|date=24 January 2007|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=4 December 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''Hopa Hemshinli''' (also designated occasionally as '''eastern Hemshinli''' in publications) are Sunni Muslims and mostly live in the [[Hopa]] and [[Borçka]] counties of Turkey's [[Artvin Province]]. In addition to Turkish, they also speak a dialect of [[Western Armenian language|western Armenian]] they call "''Homshetsma''" or "Hemşince" in Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;Ibit, Uwe Blasing, "Armenian in the vocabulary and culture of the Turkish Hemshinli".&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Homshentsik''' (also designated occasionally as '''Northern Homshentsik''' in publications) are Christians who live in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and in Russia's [[Krasnodar Krai]]. They speak Homshetsma as well.&lt;ref&gt;Bert Vaux, Hemshinli: The Forgotten Black Sea Armenians, Harvard University, 2001 p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some Muslim Hamshentsi living in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and Krasnodar &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biryasam.com.tr/Detay/23|title=Biryasam|first=biryaşam kültür ve ekoloji derneği artvin|last=hopa|publisher=|accessdate=4 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927223548/http://www.biryasam.com.tr/Detay/23|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some Hamshentsi elements amongst the [[Meskhetian Turks]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Bennigsen, "Muslims of the Soviet Empire: A Guide", 1986, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Two major developments in the Hemshin region during the Ottoman era: Islamization and population movements.&lt;ref name="Bert Vaux pp.1-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peter Alford Andrews 1989. pp. 476-477" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simonian. "Hemshin from Islamicization", pp. 52-99.&lt;/ref&gt; Islam may have begun to spread prior to the Ottoman rule, but it did not become the general religion before the end of the 16th century. A number of population movements (both into and out of the region) also happened during the Ottoman era. Even though detailed information regarding the nature of these movements is missing, in summary:
* some  Hemshinli who were members of the Armenian Orthodox Church emigrated  to other countries on the eastern Black Sea during the early centuries of Ottoman rule;
* some Muslim Hemshinli migrated to western Anatolia and the Caucasus as a result of the Turco-Russian wars and related hardships during the 19th century;
* some immigration into the area have occurred during Ottoman rule.

The present community of Hemshinli  is exclusively Muslim and Turkish speaking. This goes for the people living in Hemshin or people maintaining links to the area and living elsewhere in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Bert Vaux, Hemshinli: The Forgotten Black Sea Armenians, Harvard University, 2001 p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Alford Andrews, Ethnic Groups in the Republic of Turkey, Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag, Wiesbaden, 1989. pp.476-477, 484, 487&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hovann H. Simonian (Ed.), "The Hemshin: History, society and identity in the Highlands of Northeast Turkey", Routledge, London and New York., pp. 159, 165, 176, 257, 332, 333&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinct community settled about 50&amp;nbsp;km east of Hemşin in villages around Hopa and Borçka also call themselves  “Hemşinli”. They are often referred to as the  “Hopa Hemşinli”. Professor of Linguistics Bert Vaux at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee refers to this group as the “Eastern Hamshenis”. Hemşinli and Hopa Hemşinli are separated not only by geography but also by language and some features of culture. The two groups are almost oblivious to one another's existence. Simonian reports various theories regarding  the appearance of the Hope Hemshinli group. Those theories relate to whether the groups migrated from Hemshin or they were settled by the Ottoman authorities, whether the migration/settlement was in the early 16th or late 17th centuries, and whether the migration took place in one step or two waves. The Hopa Hemşinli are exclusively Muslim as well.
Simonian reports that there is a controversy regarding whether they arrived in the Hopa region as Muslims or converted to Islam after arrival.&lt;ref&gt;Simonian. "Hemshin from Islamicization", p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hopa Hemşinli speak  a language called "Hemşince" or (“Homşetsi” and/or Homshetsma in some sources) as well as Turkish. Recent studies by Hovann Simonian (Author: The Hemshin: A Handbook (Caucasus World)) suggest that this language is an archaic dialect of Armenian subject to influence from Turkish and Laz.&lt;ref&gt;Bert Vaux, Hemshinli: The Forgotten Black Sea Armenians, Harvard University, 2001 p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Vaux also reports that "Hemşince" has been subject to influence from Turkish to a much greater extent than other Armenian dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Vaux. "Homshetsma", p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Hemşince and Armenian are generally mutually not intelligible.&lt;ref&gt;Hovann H. Simonian (Ed.), "The Hemshin: History, society and identity in the Highlands of Northeast Turkey", Routledge, London and New York., pp. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these two groups there are people speaking Hemşince / Homshetsma in the countries of the former USSR whose ancestors probably originated from Hemşin and/or Hopa Hemşin in course of the various population movements to the Caucasus. Many of the Muslim Hemşince speakers in the former USSR were deported from the Adjara area of Georgia during the Stalin era to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Since 1989, a considerable number of these deportees have moved to Krasnodar Krai since 1989, along with the [[Meskhetian Turks]].

Most Christian Hemşince speakers currently live in Georgia and in the Krasnodar Krai region of Russia, concentrated in the Sochi area and Adygeya.

==Culture==
Hemshinli are well known for the clever jokes, riddles, and stories that they tell. Some of the anecdotes that the Muslim Hemshinli tell are actually based on older Armenian ones. They accompany dances with their own brand of music using the ''[[tulum (bagpipe)|tulum]]'' (the [[Pontus (region)|Pontic]] [[bagpipe]]) (for the Western group), the ''şimşir kaval'' ([[flute]] made of [[buxus]]) (for the Eastern group) or the ''Hamshna-Zurna'' (Hamsheni [[zurna]]) (for the Northern group). The traditional occupations of the Turkish Hemshinli are cultivating [[tea]] and [[maize]], breeding [[livestock]], and [[beekeeping]]. The Northern Hamshenis of Russia and Georgia, meanwhile, are primarily known as citrus, corn, tobacco and tea growers as well as [[fishery|fishermen]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Present situation==

===Hemşinli in Turkey===
The "Turkey for the Turks" ideology, writes [[Neal Ascherson]], "offered no security for minorities" with "the tiny Hemşinli group having especially compelling reasons to keep its head down" because "its members are the descendants of Armenians."&lt;ref&gt;Ascherson, Neal. ''Black Sea''. London: Jonathan Cape, 1995, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1930s, a number of Turkish historians attempted to ascribe an entirely Turkish origin to the Hemshinli, the most prominent of them being M. Fahrettin Kırzıoğlu, whose theories have since gained wide currency among the community.&lt;ref&gt;Simonian, Hovann H.

Costa Mesa, CA: Mazda Publishers, 2009, pp. 382-387.&lt;/ref&gt; His theories on the Hemshinli, however, have come under close scrutiny and have been roundly criticized.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, {{de icon}} Rüdiger Benninghaus, "Zur Herkunft und Identität der Hemşinli" in ''Ethnic Groups in the Republic of Turkey'', Peter A. Andrews with the assistance of Rüdiger Benninghaus (eds.). Wiesbaden: L. Reichert, 1989 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The German scholars Wolfgang Feurstein and Tucha Berdsena describe Kırzıoğlu's methodology as so:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At first Kırzıoğlu assaults the reader with a flow of historical peoples; he then searches for some kind of phonetic correspondence or similarity with an old Turkish tribe, flavors this alleged historical outpouring with a pinch of "Islam," and presents himself as a competent researcher of Turkishness. Probably never before has a single person in Turkey falsified history so massively!&lt;ref&gt;Benninghaus, Rüdiger. "Turk and Hemshinli: Manipulating Ethnic Origin and Identity" in ''The Hemshin'', p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The filmmaker [[Özcan Alper]], an eastern Hemshinli, made the first motion picture in Homshetsi, ''Momi'' (Grandma), released in 2000. As a result, Alper was accused in the Court for State Security of producing material intended to destroy the unity of the state, under article 8 of Turkey's anti-terror law. This law was repealed in 2003 after EU pressure, and Alper's trial did not go ahead.&lt;ref&gt;Rüdiger. "Turk and Hemshinli," pp. 369-370 and p 388, notes 160 and 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamsheni singer [[Gökhan Birben]] (from the Western group) and [[Laz people|Laz]] singer [[Kâzım Koyuncu]] had also sung in Homshetsi. In 2005, the first music album exclusively of anonymous Hamshen folk songs and sung mostly in Homshetsi, ''Vova - Hamşetsu Ğhağ'' was released.

Older generations of Turkish Hemshinli see the reference "Ermeni" (often used by their [[Laz people|Laz]] neighbours) as an insult.

[[Mesut Yılmaz]], a former Prime Minister of Turkey, was born in [[Istanbul]] to a family with partial Hamsheni (Western group) origins.&lt;ref name="Şener, Cemal"&gt;Şener, Cemal.

There are two ongoing projects involving Turkish [[NGO]]s and [[EuropeAid]], [[European Commission]]'s external aid instrument, that touch their issues.

===Hamshenis in Russia and the former Soviet Union===
Interest in Hamshen heritage is rising among Christian Hamshenis in the former Soviet Union. In 2006, the first music album in Homshetsma by the Ensemble Caravan was released in Krasnodar. Hamshen Scientific, Information and Cultural Centre began to work on exclusive projects in order to recover the cultural heritage of the Hamshenis living in the region. The Armenian newspaper published in [[Sukhumi]] carries the name ''Hamshen''.

During the [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] period of the [[Soviet Union]] in the late 1980s, the Hamshenis of Kazakhstan began petitioning for the government to move them to the [[Armenian SSR]]. However, this move was denied by Moscow because of fears that the Muslim Hamshenis might spark ethnic conflicts with their Christian Armenian brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.usanogh.com/content/view/418/93/ |title= Hamshenis denied return to Armenian SSR|accessdate=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, most Hamshenis lived relatively undisturbed. However, those in the Abkhazia region of Georgia had trouble coping with day-to-day life during the [[Georgian Civil War]].

Since 2000, several hundred of the Muslim Hamshenis in Russia who have resettled from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to [[Krasnodar Krai]] (about 1000 total) have repeatedly attempted to formally receive registration from the local authorities. This is similar and related to the problem of the [[Meskhetian Turks|Meskhetians]]. These actions have been made difficult by the attitude of the Krasnodar officials. In defiance of the authorities an organisation of their co-ethnics in Armenia have appealed to the Russian ambassador in [[Yerevan]] to get [[Moscow]] to intervene in this case and overrule the regional officials who seem intent on preventing Hamshenis from gaining a status of permanent residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsumonitor.com/stories/051205Russia.shtml|title=www.fsumonitor.com|publisher=|accessdate=4 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927014846/http://www.fsumonitor.com/stories/051205Russia.shtml|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Hemshin Women.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Hemsheni women [[Rize]], [[Turkey]]]]
In the 2002 Russian Federation census, 1,542 people identified themselves as Hamshenis, two-thirds of whom were living in Krasnodar Krai.

===Recognition by the Armenian mainstream===
From October 13 to 15, 2005, a Hamsheni international scientific convention was held in Sochi. The conference was organized under the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences of Armenia, Russian-Armenian Commonwealth Organization of Moscow (commissioned by the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]]) with help from the Armenian Scientific Informational and Cultural Center, "Hamshen" (Krasnodar, Russia) and Russian Armenian newspaper [[Yerkramas]]. It involved scholars from Armenia, Russia, the [[United States]], [[Germany]], and [[Iran]] to discuss the past of the Hamshenis.

==History==
It began on a large scale in the late 19th century, although most of the immigrants that reached the country in that period eventually returned to Italy after the rise of [[Italian Fascism|Fascism]]. Future Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] himself emigrated in Switzerland in 1902, only to be [[deportation|deported]] after becoming involved in the socialist movement.&lt;ref name="mediterranean3"&gt;Mediterranean Fascism 1919-1945 Edited by Charles F. Delzel, Harper Rowe 1970, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

A new migratory wave began after 1945, favoured by the lax immigration laws then in force.&lt;ref name="che"&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.swissinfo.ch/ita/index.html?siteSect=105&amp;sid=4885000 La lunga storia dell'immigrazione in Svizzera]&lt;/ref&gt; At first the [[Swiss government]] encouraged the arrival of [[guest workers]], assigning them different types of [[work permit]]s, some forbidding job switching, ranging from the "''frontaliere''" permit given to Italians living near the Swiss border to the ''"C"'' permit granting the same status of a [[Swiss citizen]] minus the [[political rights]].&lt;ref name="che"/&gt;

In 1970 there were a million immigrants in Switzerland, 54% of whom were Italians.&lt;ref name="che"/&gt; Rising friction with the indigenous majority even led to the creation of an "anti-Italians party" in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideesuisse.ch/256.0.html?&amp;no_cache=1&amp;L=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=674&amp;tx_ttnews%5Blist%5D=679%2C494%2C674%2C233%2C378&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=110 SRG SSR Timeline: Fondation d'un «parti anti-Italiens» à Zurich]&lt;/ref&gt; As every other immigrant group at the time, Italians were faced with a policy of forced [[Social integration|integration]], later satirised in the highly successful 1978 comedy film [[The Swissmakers|''Die Schweizermacher'']] (literally "The Swissmakers"), which went on to become the fifth most-watched film of all time in Switzerland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.procinema.ch/db_neu2009/index.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709085336/http://www.procinema.ch/db_neu2009/index.asp |archivedate=2009-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Italian citizens remain the largest non-naturalized group (ca. 290,000,&lt;ref name="cosc"&gt;[http://www.coscienzasvizzera.ch/docs/ItalianiinSvizzerasaldomigratorio.pdf Italiani in Svizzera: saldo migratorio nuovamente positivo ]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by 270,000 [[German immigration to Switzerland|Germans]]). The total number of "ethnic Italians" in Switzerland is estimated{{By whom|date=June 2011}} at close to half a million, but there are no official statistics on ethnicity, and furthermore [[cultural assimilation]] and cross-marriage makes it difficult to determine who among the second or third generation descendants of Italians should be counted as "ethnic Italian".

As of 2008 there is a small resurfacing of Italian immigration, when after decades the migratory balance of Italians returned positive (2,213 new Italian immigrants to Switzerland).&lt;ref name="cosc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10514">'''Japanese haunted towns''' are towns legendarily inhabited by [[ghosts]] (''[[yōkai]]''). These include Yōkai Street (officially known as Jōkyo Street or Taishōgun shopping street), in [[Kyoto]] and the Yōkaichi of [[Shiga Prefecture]].

== Ōbokeyōkai village ==
Ōbokeyōkai Village in the [[Tokushima]] Prefecture has developed a ''yōkai'' culture. Legend has it that ''yōkai'' inhabit the village. Some 15,000 people were identified as residents in the 1950s. However, reports regarding &lt;u&gt;''yōkai''&lt;/u&gt; sightings and ''yōkai''-related phenomena led to a mass exodus. In 2013, the village was home to only 4,000 permanent residents.&lt;ref name=Takashi&gt;Takashi, M. (2013, September). [http://www.suntory.co.jp/sfnd/prize_cca/detail/2013c4.html Yamazato ni tsutawaru youkaidensetsu wo kaku ni shita tikizukuri]. (Community improvement which was based on legends handed down to mountain villages.) Suntory foundation. [July 9, 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

This village is said to be a birthplace of [[konaki-jiji|''konakijijī'']],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topics.or.jp/localNews/news/2013/12/2013_13867226107145.html Konakijiji wo shohyotoroku Obokemura, kashi nado 30 syurui shitei] (Oboke village registered a trademark of “Konakijiji”. For example, confectionery, and so on, 30 kinds of products were designed). (2013, December 11). Tokushima newspaper digital.  [May 29, 2014].&lt;/ref&gt; and is the source of many ''yōkai'' legends. To capitalize upon the interests of Japanese pop culture and as a sign of respect for their fellow ''yōkai'' residents, this village erected statues of ''yōkai'' and holds various "''yōkai'' events" annually.

=== History ===
In 1998, locals began to investigate the village and uncovered its legend as a birthplace of ''konakijijī'' and ''yōkai''. In 2001, they put up a statue of ''konakijijī'' and started a ''yōkai'' festival. In 2010, a rest area in this village was remade into a ''yōkai'' mansion and many statues of &lt;u&gt;''yōkai''&lt;/u&gt; are displayed there.&lt;ref name=Takashi/&gt;

=== Events and buildings ===
People in this village have held many events and built many structures. The biggest event is the Yōkai Festival held every year in November. Yokai night walks, a disguise contest, poster exhibitions, and guided tours are also held.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshiharu, T. (2013, December 23). [http://sankei.jp.msn.com/west/west-life/news/131223/wlf1322318010022-n1.htm Aratana “hikyo no yokai supotto”] 「Konkijiji」 no sato.

Retrieved:  [May 29, 2014].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is a yōkai mansion as a roadside station, where legends about yōkai are displayed. Furthermore, many sculptures of yōkai stand in various places throughout the village.&lt;ref name=Takashi/&gt;

=== Stories about Yōkai ===
In Ōbokeyokai village, stories about ''yōkai'' have been handed down from generation to generation. For example, stories about ''konakijijī'', ''hitotsumenyūdō'', ''[[tengu]]'', [[kappa (folklore)|''kappa'' (folklore)]], and so on. More than one hundred and fifty stories exist now.&lt;ref&gt;Yamashiro Oboke village, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient people scared children with stories of ''yōkai'', to prevent them from doing dangerous things.

== Mizuki Shigeru Road, Sakaiminato ==
Mizuki Shigeru road is a street with many statues of ''yōkai'' in [[Sakaiminato, Tottori]]. Sakaiminato is the birthplace of [[Shigeru Mizuki]], who is the author of [[GeGeGe no Kitarō]], a famous Japanese comic. Mizuki Shigeru road has many statues of ''yōkai'' and facilities related to ''yōkai''.

=== Attractions ===
Statues of ''yōkai'', a memorial house, a shrine and many shops are on Mizuki Shigeru road. When the road was first built, 23 statues of ''yōkai'' were there, but by 2014, the number had risen to 153.&lt;ref name=kankokyokai&gt;[http://www.mlit.go.jp/common/000213058.pdf Sakaiminato shi kankō kyōkai].

=== History ===
Mizuki Shigeru road had a history of 21 years as of 2014. Sakaiminato prospered by the marine products industry. To add culture, Mizuki Shigeru road was made in 1993. In 2000, ''yōkai jinja'' was founded on the road, and in 2003, Mizuki Shigeru ''kinenkan'' was made. In 2008 over 10 million people visited this road .&lt;ref name=kankokyokai /&gt;

=== Events ===
Events include ''Sakaiminato sakana'', a ''yōkai'' walk. Another event is ''GeGeGe no getatumi taikai'', in which the participants compete by the number of ''Getas'' they amass. The higher-ranking prize winners receive a prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sakaiminato.net/site2/page/event/koureievent/getatum Sakaiminato shi kankō kyōkai]. (2014).

== Yōkai Street, Kyoto ==
In Yōkai Street, many cute and humorous ''yōkai'' appear. Yōkai Street is at Taishōgun in [[Kyōto]]. This is a development project. Many ''yōkai'' dolls are displayed in storefronts. When events are held, many people participate.

=== History ===
Residents of Taishōgun began this project in 2005. The project derives from “[[Hyakki yagyō]]” in the [[Heian period]]. Hyakkiyakō is a parade of many yōkai, which is from old tools threw away. In the [[Heian period]], people believed that if people threw tools using a long time,that the tools had souls, called [[Tsukumogami]]. It is said that this way of thinking celebrates the importance of using tools for a long time.&lt;ref name=hyakkitaisho&gt;[http://www.kit.hi-ho.ne.jp/u2me2/kyo/daishogun/01.html Hyakkiyakō no Taishōgun] (Taishōgun, where Hyakkiyakō appears). (2008, June). Kyōto mania.  [July 17, 2014].&lt;/ref&gt; These yōkai often appeared along Ichjō street. Now, in Taishōgun along Ichijō street, there is a small hall of yōkai. In the hall there, details explaining Hyakkiyakō and yōkai can be found.

=== ''Yōkai'' statues and ''yōkai'' food ===
Yōkai Street is usually quiet, but many kind of ''yokai'' welcome visitors. Various stores and handmade ''yōkai'' are placed in front of stores. In front of the bakery is “the old man of bread.” In front of the kimono shop is a ''[[bakeneko]]'' dressed in a ''kimono''. One local dish is ''Yōkai Ramen'', a Chinese noodle soup. It is the black and powdered in red. In front of this restaurant is a one-eyed [[goblin]]. Other food served there is a ''yōkai'' [[croquette]]. The color is black and the inside is green. These foods are popular despite their strange appearance.&lt;ref name=shikama&gt;Shikama, A. (2010, August 7).

Retrieved:  [June 25, 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Events ===
At the Taishōgunhachi shrine on Yōkai Street, a Yōkai Free Market is held several times a year. This market is usually well attended and full of people buying and selling ''yōkai''-related goods. Another event is “''Ichijō Hyakkiyakō'',” a costume parade in which many people wear ''yōkai'' costumes and walk along Ichijō street at night.&lt;ref name = officesanga&gt;OFFICE-SANGA.

[May 24, 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Yōkaichi, Shiga ==
[[Yōkaichi, Shiga|Yōkaichi city]], which is in [[Shiga prefecture]], has  become prosperous by publicizing ''yōkai''. Honaikai is an attempt to recover local history through events related to ''yōkai''.

=== History ===
Yōkaichi, Shiga city, which is now [[Higashiōmi, Shiga]] city, was named in the [[Asuka period]] by [[Prince Shōtoku]]. The name Yōkaichi derives from the market which was held on days including 8 (8th, 18th, 28th) in Asuka period. Yōkaichi prospered as a market town and in 2005 merged with four other towns to form [[Higashiōmi, Shiga]].&lt;ref name= Nishi&gt;Nishī, R.(2014, March 8) [http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/local/shiga/feature/CO005896/20140307-OYT8T01318.html Sonogo Ichigamijinja(higashiōmi) akinai no kami tīki mamoru]
(Number 5 Ichigami shrine (Kitaomi) The God of business watch Yōkaichi community).(2014, March 8).Yomiuri Newspaper.  [July 26, 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
Honaikai took a leading part in the development of ''yōkai'' culture in Yōkaichi city, starting in 1999. In 2002, "Honaikai" made the map of mysterious ''yōkai'' places for the first time. In 2007, Honaikai made a map called the "[[Prince Shōtoku]] series" which introduced twelve shrines and temples related to Prince Shōtoku. Seven maps related to [[raccoon dogs]], foxes, and the legend of a long-nosed goblin were created. Honaikai especially focuses on Gao, a ghost that eats mischievous children. Members of Honaikai disguise themselves as Gao on February 3 and visit children.&lt;ref name=Nishi/&gt;

=== Festivals ===
Festivals related to ''yōkai'' or the history of Yōkaichi are held there. "Yōkaichi ha Yōkaichi" is held mainly by "Honaikai" to inform people of the history and to advance ''yōkai'' culture. A parade with ghosts and a haunted house is held.

The "Yōkaichi Shōtoku Maturi" is a festival during which a night market is held and people enjoy dancing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shigahochi.co.jp/info.php?type=article&amp;id=A0010731 Yōkaichi kara Higashiōmi he! kaiichikinensai], "Yōkaichi ha yōkaichi" (From Yokaichi to Higashiōmi, memorial festival).

'''Lavi''' (Lawi; autonym: Swoeng or ''səlwəŋ'') is a [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer language]] of the [[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]] branch spoken in [[Sekong Province]], [[Laos]]. Chazée (1999:95) estimates the population at 500, while the 2015 Laotian census places the Lavi population at 1,215.

The Lavi language was discovered by Thai linguist Therapan L-Thongkum in the late 1990s. Within the West Bahnaric branch, it is the most divergent language (Sidwell 2003). Lavi speakers reside in the village Ban Lavi (also called Ban Fandeng), which is about 8&amp;nbsp;km south of the city of Sekong. Speakers can also be found in Laongam in Salavan province, Paksong in Champasak province, and Thateng in Sekong province.

The '''Lithuanian Museum of Ancient Beekeeping''' (''Senovinės bitininkystės muziejus''), established in 1984 near [[Stripeikiai]] in northeastern [[Lithuania]], displays the history of [[apiculture|beekeeping]] in the area.
The museum, part of [[Aukštaitija National Park]], was founded by the beekeeper Bronius Kazlas.

[[Image:Lithuania Stripeikiai Honeymaking Museum.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sculptured hives at the museum]]

As of 2006, the museum consisted of six buildings, about 500 displays, and 25 sculptures.   In addition to illustrating the history of beekeeping in Lithuania, some of the museum's wooden sculptures themselves contain [[beehives]]. The sculptures pay homage to the honeybee's place in worldwide mythology and folklore, including [[Egypt]]ian and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] figures as well as the Lithuanian god Babilas and goddess Austėja. They were carved by Teofilis Patiejūnas and Ipolitas Užkurnis.

The displays include glass-sided hives that enable visitors to watch the bees at work, tool collections, and illustrations of the role that bees play in [[pollination]]. The wide variety of hives includes many tree trunks, which were used from the 15th century until the beginning of the 20th century.

The [[Lithuanian Veterinary Academy]] claims that Lithuanian bees are especially peaceful. They constitute a sub-species of the [[Western honey bee|European honey bee]]; they are smaller than [[Italian bee]]s and larger than the [[Caucasian honey bee]].

The honeybee is a symbol of friendship in Lithuania; the word ''bičiulis'' is an affectionate form of address. In 2005 [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] presented Lithuanian President [[Valdas Adamkus]] with three beehives and bees, which were brought to the museum.

The museum is open from May to October. A Honey Harvest festival is held in August, and the museum features a "Honey Bar".&lt;br /&gt;

The museum has been under the reconstruction recently. Hovewer, it is opened renewed in the spring of 2015.

'''[[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] of [[Serbia]]''' are an officially recognized ethnic minority in Serbia.

==History==
[[File:Avtonomna Makedonia Belgrade 1905.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''Avtonomna Makedonia'' periodical, [[Belgrade]], 1905]]
During the years 1945&amp;ndash;1992, [[ethnic Macedonians]] and the [[Macedonian Language]] was a constituent part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Many [[Ethnic Macedonians]], due to economic reasons, migrated during the 1960s and 1970s to the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]] (predominately in [[Vojvodina]]). In 2004, Serbia and Macedonia signed an inter-state agreement on the protection of Macedonians in Serbia and [[Serbs of the Republic of Macedonia|Serbs in Macedonia]].

==Demographics==

According to the 2011 census there were 22,755 [[ethnic Macedonians]] in [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pod2.stat.gov.rs/ObjavljenePublikacije/Popis2011/Nacionalna%20pripadnost-Ethnicity.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811224233/http://pod2.stat.gov.rs/ObjavljenePublikacije/Popis2011/Nacionalna%20pripadnost-Ethnicity.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Macedonian population living in Serbia is concentrated in two cities, [[Belgrade]] and [[Pančevo]]. In Belgrade there are 6,970 Macedonians, while in neighboring Pančevo 4,558 - out of which vast majority live in three villages ([[Jabuka]], [[Glogonj]], and [[Kačarevo]]) that are within administrative limits of City of Pančevo. Additionally, Macedonians constitute significant population in [[Plandište]] municipality, especially in village of [[Dužine]].

==Politics==
In 2005 Macedonians in Serbia also established a National Minority Council, which represents as a step towards safeguarding their interests. Jovo Radevski was elected as its president. The [[Democratic Party of Macedonians]] is the primary minority party. It is centered in [[Novi Sad]].

==Culture==
Macedonian language is in the official use in the municipality of [[Plandište]], where Macedonians constitute 9.2% of population. Macedonian-language print media consists primarily of the monthly political journal ''Makedonska videlina'' produced by the Macedonian Information and Publishing Centre in [[Pančevo]]. Limited Macedonian-language television is available through regional public broadcaster of [[Radio Television of Vojvodina]] and the local station TV Pančevo.

Associations such as "The Society of Serbian and Macedonian Friendship Šar – planina" seated in Belgrade, and the "Municipal Society of Serbian-Macedonian Friendship" seated in Zrenjanin cover issues related to ethnic, cultural and economic cooperation in [[Serbia]].

==History and origin==
The Manka are said to get their name from their profession of making  ''manka'', which in the [[Gujarati language|Gujrati]] language, means the making of prayer beads. They claim to be [[Chavda Kingdom|Chavda]] [[Rajput]]s. The community is said to have come from [[Sindh]] and are now found mainly in twenty villages of Bachau and Rapar [[taluka]]s of [[Kutch District]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Two edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 863-867&lt;/ref&gt;Some of the Manka are found in Jam Salaya district Jamnagar in Saurashtra who are mainly in fishing and seafaring work.

==Present circumstances==

The Manka speak a dialect of [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], with substantial [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] loan words. The Manka consist of a number of clans, the main ones being the Jabayi, Chunctria, Jesra, Payana, Chavda and Sinayi. The community is split along religious lines, with the [[Bhuj]] Manka being [[Muslim]]. They resemble other [[Kutch]] [[Muslim]] communities in social, ritual and religious activity. The Manka are an endogamous community, and marriages between the clans is the norm. Land is a major economic source, and agriculture is their traditional occupation.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Two edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 863-867&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Poverty''' can be and is '''measured''' in different ways by governments, international organisations, policy makers and practitioners. Increasingly, poverty is understood as multidimensional comprising social, natural and economic factors situated within wider socio-political processes. The capabilities approach also argues that capturing the perceptions of poor people is fundamental in understanding and measuring poverty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sen|first1=Amartya|title=Development as Freedom|date=1999|publisher=OUP|isbn=0-19-289330-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

==Absolute vs relative poverty==
When measured, poverty may be [[absolute poverty|absolute]] or [[Poverty#Relative Poverty|relative]]. Absolute poverty refers to a set standard which is consistent over time and between countries. An example of an absolute measurement would be the percentage of the population eating less food than is required to sustain the human body (approximately 2000&amp;ndash;2500 [[calories]] per day).

Relative poverty, in contrast, views poverty as socially defined and dependent on [[social context]]. One relative measurement would be to compare the total wealth of the poorest one-third of the population with the total wealth of the richest 1% of the population. In this case, the number of people counted as poor could increase while their income rises. There are several different [[income inequality metrics]]; one example is the [[Gini coefficient]].

Although absolute [[poverty]] is more common in developing countries, poverty and inequality exist across the world.

==Measurements==
The main [[poverty line]] used in the [[OECD]] and the [[European Union]] is a relative poverty measure based on "economic distance", a level of income usually set at 60% of the median household income.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poverty.org.uk/summary/eapn.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States, in contrast, uses an absolute poverty measure. The US poverty line was created in 1963&amp;ndash;64 and was based on the dollar costs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's "economy food plan" multiplied by a factor of three. The multiplier was based on research showing that food costs then accounted for about one-third of money income. This one-time calculation has since been annually updated for inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/faq.shtml US Department of Human Services], FAQ Poverty Guidelines and Poverty&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. line has been critiqued as being either too high or too low. For example, the [[Heritage Foundation]], a conservative U.S. [[think tank]], objects to the fact that, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 46% of those defined as being in poverty in the U.S. own their own home (with the average poor person's home having three bedrooms, with one and a half baths, and a garage).&lt;ref&gt;Rector, Robert E. and Johnson, Kirk A., [http://www.fullemployment.org/Understanding%20Poverty%20in%20America.pdf ''Understanding Poverty in America''], Executive Summary, Heritage Foundation, January 15, 2004, No. 1713&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as economist Ellen Frank, argue that the poverty measure is too low as families spend much less of their total budget on food than they did when the measure was established in the 1950s. Further, federal poverty statistics do not account for the widely varying regional differences in non-food costs such as housing, transport, and utilities.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Ellen, [http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2006/0106dollar.html "Dr. Dollar: How Is Poverty Defined in Government Statistics?"] ''[[Dollars &amp; Sense]]'' magazine, January/February 2006. Accessed April 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Both absolute and relative poverty measures are usually based on a person's yearly income and frequently take no account of total wealth. Some people argue that this ignores a key component of economic well-being. Major developments and research in this area suggest that standard one dimensional measures of poverty, based mainly on wealth or calorie consumption, are seriously deficient. This is because poverty often  involves being deprived on several fronts, which do not necessarily correlate well with wealth. Access to basic needs is an example of a measurement that does not include wealth. Access to basic needs that may be used in the measurement of poverty are clean water, food, shelter and clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.boundless.com/sociology/textbooks/boundless-sociology-textbook/stratification-inequality-and-social-class-in-the-u-s-9/poverty-78/measuring-poverty-463-3312/ | title=Measuring Poverty - Poverty is defined by deprivation, and can be measured with economic or social indicators. | accessdate=12 March 2015 | website=boundless.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=12 March 2015 | first1=Thomas | last1=Pogge | url=http://thomaspogge.com/thomas-pogge/measuring-poverty/ | title=Measuring Poverty | website=thomaspogge.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been established that people may have enough income to satisfy basic needs, but not use it wisely. Similarly, extremely poor people may not be deprived if sufficiently strong social networks, or social service systems exist. For deeper discussion see.&lt;ref&gt;Thorbecke, E., 2008. Multidimensional Poverty: Conceptual and Measurement Issues. In: Kakwani, N., Silber, J. (Eds.), The Many Dimensions of Poverty. Palgrave
Macmillan, New York, pp. 3–20&lt;/ref&gt; See also the Wikipedia article on Multidimensional poverty.

==Definitions==
The [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] defines poverty in absolute terms. The bank defines ''[[extreme poverty]]'' as living on less than US$1.90 per day&gt;&lt;ref name="worldbank2008"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2008/09/16/new-data-show-14-billion-live-less-us125-day-progress-against-poverty-remains-strong | title=New Data Show 1.4 Billion Live On Less Than US$1.25 A Day, But Progress Against Poverty Remains Strong | publisher=The World Bank | accessdate=13 March 2015 | website=worldbank.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]), and ''moderate poverty'' as less than $3.10 a day. It has been estimated that in 2008, 1.4 billion people had consumption levels below US$1.25 a day and 2.7 billion lived on less than $2 a day. The proportion of the [[developing world]]'s population living in extreme economic poverty has fallen from 28 percent in 1990 to 21 percent in 2001. Much of the improvement has occurred in East and South Asia. In Sub-Saharan Africa GDP/capita shrank with 14 percent, and extreme poverty increased from 41 percent in 1981 to 46 percent in 2001. Other regions have seen little or no change. In the early 1990s the transition economies of Europe and Central Asia experienced a sharp drop in income. Poverty rates rose to 6 percent at the end of the decade before beginning to recede.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/0,,contentMDK:20153855~menuPK:373757~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:336992,00.html  Worldbank.org reference]&lt;/ref&gt; There are criticisms of these measurements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19990427100741/http://www.transnational.org/features/chossu_worldbank.html TFF, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-monetary indicators==
Some economists, such as Guy Pfeffermann, say that other non-monetary indicators of "absolute poverty" are also improving. [[Life expectancy]] has greatly increased in the developing world since [[World War II]] and is starting to close the gap to the developed world where the improvement has been smaller. Even in Sub-Saharan Africa, the least developed region, life expectancy increased from 30 years before World War II to a peak of about 50 years &amp;mdash; before the HIV pandemic and other diseases started to force it down to the current level of 47 years. [[Child mortality]] has decreased in every developing region of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobalist.com/DBWeb/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=2429 ''The Eight Losers of Globalization''] by Guy Pfeffermann. Pfeffermann, former Chief Economist of the International Finance Corporation, is the CEO of [http://www.gbsnonline.org Global Business School Network]. This is a non-profit organization supporting business and management education in the developing world. 2002.&lt;blockquote&gt;It is an area where not only is there little or no consensus among disciplines, but where economists themselves have widely differing views. So, what can one say with a fair degree of certainty about growth and inequality in developing countries? Life expectancy at birth — the most basic and robust of all social indicators — has increased very considerably around the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of the world's population living in countries where per-capita food supplies are less than 2,200 [[calorie]]s (9,200 [[kilojoule]]s) per day decreased from 56% in the mid-1960s to below 10% by the 1990s. Between 1950 and 1999, global literacy increased from 52% to 81% of the world. Women made up much of the gap: Female literacy as a percentage of male literacy has increased from 59% in 1970 to 80% in 2000. The percentage of children not in the labor force has also risen to over 90% in 2000 from 76% in 1960. There are similar trends for electric power, cars, radios, and telephones per capita, as well as the proportion of the population with access to clean water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.org/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VC6-4F02KWN-8&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=01%2F01%2F2005&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=3c12cc79f8121ee4e000396b0273a1eb www.sciencedirect.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poverty Gap Index ==

The [[Poverty Gap Index]] is the mean distance below the poverty line as a proportion of the poverty line where the mean is taken over the whole population, counting the non-poor as having zero poverty gap.

==Stats==
Even if poverty may be lessening for the world as a whole, it continues to be an enormous problem:
* One third of deaths &amp;mdash; some 18 million people a year or 50,000 per day &amp;mdash; are due to poverty-related causes. That's 270 million people since 1990, the majority women and children, roughly equal to the population of the US.	 
* Every year nearly 11 million children die before their fifth birthday.
*In 2001, 1.1 billion people had consumption levels below $1 a day and 2.7 billion lived on less than $2 a day.
* 800 million people go to bed hungry every day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millenniumcampaign.org/site/pp.asp?c=grKVL2NLE&amp;b=185518 millenniumcampaign.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other factors==
The World Bank's Voices of the Poor initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voices of the Poor|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/0,,contentMDK:20622514~menuPK:336998~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:336992,00.html|website=worldbank.org|publisher=THe World Bank|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on research with over 20,000 poor people in 23 countries, identifies a range of factors that poor people consider elements of poverty. Most important are those necessary for material well-being, especially food. Many others relate to social rather than material issues.

'''Nathan Aviezer''' is an American-Israeli physicist who writes on Torah and science, especially on [[evolution]] and [[cosmology]] from an Orthodox Jewish perspective. He is a [[Professor]] of [[Physics]] and former Chairman of the Physics Department of [[Bar-Ilan University]].

==Biography==
Aviezer was born in [[Switzerland]] in [[1935]] and raised in the [[United States]]. He received his doctorate in physics from the [[University of Chicago]], and subsequently held a research position at the University of Illinois in the research group of Professor [[John Bardeen]], the only person ever to be awarded two Nobel Prizes in physics. He was then invited to join the research group at the [[IBM Watson Research Center]] near New York headed by Professor [[Leo Esaki]], who was also a Nobel Prize winner. In 1967, Aviezer and his wife Dvora made [[aliyah]] to [[Israel]]. He is the author of 140 scientific articles on [[solid state physics]]. In recognition of his important research contributions, he was honored by being elected as a Fellow of the [[American Physical Society]] (1984).

In addition to his scientific research, Aviezer has a long-standing involvement in Torah and science and he has written three books on the subject: "In the Beginning" (translated into nine languages),"Fossils and Faith" (translated into four languages), "Modern Science and Ancient Faith" (recently published). For several decades, Aviezer has received invitation to lecture on the subject of Torah and science throughout the world. Aviezer also gives a course in Torah and science at Bar-Ilan University. In 1999, his course was awarded the prestigious Templeton Prize. Aviezer continues to give lectures on Torah and science throughout Israel as well as abroad.

==Views on creation and evolution==
Aviezer is particularly notable for being one of very few modern writers from the religious Jewish perspective to publish on the subject of Torah and science, using the language of science and rejecting creationism. Aviezer allows for divine guidance within an [[evolution]]ary paradigm in the transmutation of species over time, including the emergence of modern man. He interprets the six days of creation as broadly referring to large periods of time, an interpretation for which he cites rabbinic sources, including [[Maimonides]] and [[Nachmanides]], citing in particular the problem with defining the several "days" of creation that precede the creation of the Sun, according to the Biblical narrative.

'''Nida Civic Movement''' ({{lang-az|Nida Vətəndaş Hərəkatı}}), commonly referred to as '''N!DA''' or simply '''Nida''', is an Azerbaijani civic movement founded in early 2011 by a few young people to achieve democratic and social changes in [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nidavh.org/ About us, Official web page of N!DA]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it has over 350 members comprising mainly young individuals as well as well-known politicians and activists. The movement claims to have no affiliation with any of the political parties in the country. ''Nida'' means ''exclamation'' in Azerbaijani.

==Principles==
The purpose of the movement is to defend the constitutional and human rights of the society, and preserve the democratic and republican values. N!DA also aims to attract citizens, especially, youth and students into the socio-political processes of the country in order to democratize Azerbaijan and increase their influence in the processes. The manifest of the movement explicitly states that N!DA is not a political party and it has no intention to be represented in the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nidavh.org/#about-us About us, Official web page of N!DA]&lt;/ref&gt;
           
==Administrative board==
N!DA is coordinated by the administrative board consisting of seven members. The members of the board are elected by a general voting held among the movement members only. The incumbent board was formed after some of the board members (co-founders at the same time) and ordinary members were arrested with believed to be fake accusations by the government authorities.

The current board, as of September 2015, includes Ulvi Hasanli, Ramin Huseynov, Majid Majidli, Kenan Gasimli, Murad Rustambeyli, Ashum Ashumov, Turgut Gambar and İlaha Amiraslanova.

==Political prisoners==
Seven activists of N!DA, including four board members, were kidnapped and arrested with different bogus accusations a few days after the protests held against the non-combat military deaths in March and April 2013 in Baku, Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nidavh.org/page/siyasimehbuslarimiz Our political prisoners, Official web page of N!DA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.trend.az/news/politics/2127572.html 3 persons who incited violence and civil confrontation arrested in Baku]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://azerireport.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3908 NIDA Activist Rashad Hasanov Arrested]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://azerbaijantldr.com/2-more-nida-members-arrested/ 2 more NIDA members arrested]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://azerbaijantldr.com/zaur-gurbanli-of-nda-arrested/ Zaur Gurbanli of N!DA arrested]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3692/en/azerbaijan-at-the-upr:-time-to-cease-politically-motivated-arrests-and-the-imprisonment-of-opposition-activists-and-journalists Azerbaijan at the UPR: Time to cease politically motivated arrests and the imprisonment of opposition activists and journalists]&lt;/ref&gt; One more member of the movement, Omar Mammadov was arrested in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.info/40566.html Daha bir gənc fəal həbs olundu, Azadlıq newspaper, 25 January 2014, retrieved on 27 March 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, a criminal case has been launched on articles 234.1 (illegally obtaining, keeping or selling drugs) and 228.1 (illegally obtaining, keeping, carrying weapons, explosives) of the Criminal Code.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9846">'''Official development assistance''' ('''ODA''') is a term coined by the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) of the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) to measure [[aid]]. The DAC first used the term in 1969. It is widely used as an indicator of international aid flow. It includes some loans.

Most ODA comes from the 30 members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DAC members|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/dacmembers.htm|website=OECD|publisher=OECD|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the DAC, or about $135&amp;nbsp;billion in 2013. A further $15.9&amp;nbsp;billion came from the [[European Commission]] and non-DAC countries gave an additional $9.4&amp;nbsp;billion. Although [[development aid]] rose in 2013 to the highest level ever recorded, a trend of a falling share of aid going to the neediest sub-Saharan African countries continued.&lt;ref name=OECD-2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Aid to developing countries rebounds in 2013 to reach an all-time high|url=http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/aid-to-developing-countries-rebounds-in-2013-to-reach-an-all-time-high.htm|publisher=OECD|accessdate=18 October 2014|date=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The full definition of ODA is:
{{Quotation|Flows of official financing administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective, and which are concessional in character with a grant element of at least 25 percent (using a fixed 10 percent rate of discount). By convention, ODA flows comprise contributions of donor government agencies, at all levels, to developing countries (“bilateral ODA”) and to multilateral institutions. ODA receipts comprise disbursements by bilateral donors and multilateral institutions. |OECD|Glossary of Statistical Terms
&lt;ref&gt;  [http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6043 OECD Glossary of statistical terms, ''Official Development Assistance (ODA)'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, ODA needs to contain the three elements:&lt;br /&gt;
(a) undertaken by the &lt;u&gt;official sector&lt;/u&gt; (official agencies, including state and local governments, or their executive agencies)[http://www.oecd.org/investment/stats/34086975.pdf]&lt;br /&gt;
(b) with promotion of economic &lt;u&gt;development&lt;/u&gt; and welfare as the main objective; and&lt;br /&gt; 
(c) at &lt;u&gt;concessional&lt;/u&gt; financial terms (if a loan, having a grant element of at least 25 per cent).

This definition is used to exclude development aid from the two other categories of aid from DAC members:
* '''Official Aid''' (OA): Flows which meet conditions of eligibility for inclusion in Official Development Assistance (ODA), other than the fact that the recipients are on Part II of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) List of Aid Recipients.
* '''Other Official Flows''' (OOF): Transactions by the official sector with countries on the List of Aid Recipients which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as Official Development Assistance or Official Aid, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they have a grant element of less than 25 per cent.

Examples:&lt;br /&gt;
If a donor country accords a grant or a concessional loan to [[Afghanistan]] it is classified as '''ODA''', because it is on the Part I list.&lt;br /&gt;
If a donor country accords a grant or a concessional loan to [[Bahrain]] it is classified as '''OA''', because it is on the Part II list.&lt;br /&gt;
If a donor country gives military assistance to any other country or territory it is classified as '''OOF''', because it is not aimed at development.

A recent OECD DAC Commique has seen the donor community update the definition of ODA to better reflect the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changes-to-official-aid-rules|title=Changes to official aid rules - GOV.UK|author=|date=|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/DAC-HLM-Communique-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries by development aid given==
{{main|List of development aid country donors}}

ODA volumes may be measured absolutely, by the amount transferred, or relatively, as a proportion of the donor country's economy. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the top 15 countries (DAC and non-DAC members) giving the highest amounts (in absolute terms) in 2015 are as follows:&lt;ref name=OECD-2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Development aid in 2015 continues to grow despite costs for in-donor refugees|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/ODA-2015-detailed-summary.pdf|publisher=OECD|accessdate=29 April 2016|date=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union accumulated a higher portion of GDP as a form of foreign aid than any other economic union.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed 1945 to the Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=New York|year=2014|isbn=9780199371020|location=New York|pages=516–517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Donor countries by percentage of gross national income ===

The OECD also lists countries by the amount of ODA they give ''as a percentage of their [[gross national income]].'' Seven countries met the longstanding UN target for an ODA/GNI ratio of 0.7% in 2015. The top 15 DAC and non-DAC countries for 2015 are shown below:&lt;ref name=OECD-2015/&gt;

==Aid recipients==
{{See|List of countries by Official Development Assistance received}}

[[File:2005net oda.PNG|thumb|upright=2.95|A map of official development assistance distribution in 2005.]]
[[World Bank]] reports that Iraq was the top recipient of development aid in 2005 followed by Nigeria. However, this is due to the significant debt relief deals that were granted to these nations that year - when donor countries write off a portion of a recipient country's debt, it is counted as official development assistance from the donor country.

The OECD reports that in 2009 Africa received the largest amount of ODA, at $28 billion. Of that, $25 billion went to countries south of the Sahara, with Sudan receiving approximately $1.9 billion and Ethiopia getting $1.8 billion. Asia received the second largest amount at $24 billion. The top ODA receiving countries in order were Afghanistan ($5.1 billion), Iraq ($2.6 billion) and Vietnam ($2.1 billion) &lt;ref name="OECDSTATS09"&gt;[[OECD]], [http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=ODA_RECIP "ODA by Recipient"], 2011-08-08&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Official development assistance has been criticized by several economists for being an inappropriate way of helping poor countries. The Hungarian economist [[Peter Thomas Bauer]] has been one of the most vocal of them.  Another notable economist arguing against ODA is [[Dambisa Moyo]] in her book [[Dambisa Moyo#Dead_Aid | Dead Aid]]. She contends that a country accustomed to receiving ODA may become perpetually dependent on such aid.

Donor countries are most commonly compared by the amount of Official Development Assistance given and their quantity of aid as a percent of GDP.  However, there is an increasing focus placed on the quality of aid, rather than simply the quantity.  The [[Commitment to Development Index]] is one such measure that ranks the largest donors on a broad range of their "development friendly" policies.  It takes into account the quality of aid, in addition to the quantity, penalizing countries for [[tied aid]].  Aid also does not operate in a vacuum; a country's policies on issues such as trade or migration also have a significant impact on developing countries.

'''Paska''' (Russian, Ukrainian: '''Пáска''' "[[Easter]]", Georgian: '''პასკა''' "[[Easter]]", ultimately from {{lang-arc|פסחא}} "[[Passover]]") is a Easter bread tradition and particularly spread in countries with predominant [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] religion or cultural connections to the ancient [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://macknade.com/blog/festival-breads-for-easter/|title=Festival Breads for Easter - Macknade Fine Foods|work=Macknade Fine Foods|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://triblive.com/news/indiana/5955006-74/easter-orthodox-fasting|title=Orthodox traditions observed locally for Easter season|last=Delfavero|first=Gina|website=TribLIVE.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paska breads are a traditional element in the easter holidays of Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Armenia, Romania, Moldova, Georgia and parts of Bulgaria as well as the [[Assyrian–Chaldean–Syriac diaspora]]. Due to its geographical closeness, it is also widespread in Slovakia. Meanwhile it is also eaten in countries with immigrant populations from Eastern Europe such as the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.

== Etymology and Origins ==
Easter is called in Russian and Ukranian languages ''па́ска'' (''páska''/''Paskha'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-russian/easter|title=Easter {{!}} translate English to Russian: Cambridge Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is connected to ancient Greek word ''πάσκα'' (''páska'') and Georgian: ''პასკა'' (''Easter''), derived from the Orthodox believers in Byzantine Empire. The name is connected to the Jewish holiday of ''Pesach.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1020497898|title=Silentium : and other reflections on memory, sorrow, place, and the sacred|last=Connie,|first=Braun,|publisher=Resource Publications|others=Janzen, Jean,|year=2017|isbn=9781532617928|location=Eugene, Oregon|pages=158|oclc=1020497898}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Traditional ingredients ==
Paska is made with [[milk]], [[butter]], [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[flour]], and [[sugar]], except in Romania, where the recipe most commonly includes sweet cream, [[cottage cheese]], and/or [[sour cream]] along with [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[sugar]], [[raisins]], and [[rum]]. An egg and water mixture is used as a glaze.

== Christian symbolism ==
[[File:Lob NARkult 02.JPG|thumb|Paska bread kulich in [[Belgorod Oblast]]|alt=]]
The Christian faithful in many [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] countries eat this bread during Easter. Christian symbolism is associated with features of paska type breads. The inside of paska can be a swirl of yellow and white that is said to represent the [[resurrection of Jesus]] while the white represents the [[Holy Spirit]]. Other versions include chocolate, rice, or even savoury mixtures based on cheese. A version is made with maraschino cherries added to symbolize royal jewels in honor of the resurrection of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Halmo [https://books.google.com/books?id=wOJ4sLwVllEC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Paska+bread&amp;lr=#PPA43,M1 ''Celebrating the church year with young children''] Liturgical Press, 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-8146-1580-5}}. 159 pages. page 43&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eaten with other foods ==
[[File:PASKA2.JPG|thumb|left|Paska bread|alt=]]
Paska is eaten with "hrudka", also called ''syrek'', a bland sweet custard similar to cheese made from separated eggs and milk and beets mixed with [[horseradish]] (''chren''/''hrin'') and [[kielbasa]] (in Polish) or ''kovbasa'' (in Ukrainian).

==Assyrian Paska==
In Iran and the diaspora, Assyrians will eat a Paska cake on Easter, ''Ida Gura''. The tall cake is decorated with a cross on top to represent [[Calvary]], the place of Jesus' crucifixion, and surrounded with colored eggs to symbolize the people who visited Jesus during his death and were at his cross.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

This article lists the statutory '''retirement age''' in different countries. In some contexts, the [[retirement]] age is the age at which a person is expected or required to cease work and is usually the age at which they may be entitled to receive [[pension|superannuation]] or other government benefits, like a [[state pension]]. Policy makers usually consider the demography, fiscal cost of ageing, health, life expectancy, nature of profession, supply of labour force etc. while deciding the retirement age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cppr.in/archives/setting-an-ideal-retirement-age/|title=Setting an Ideal Retirement Age!|work=Centre for Public Policy Research (CPPR)|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407060852/http://www.cppr.in/archives/setting-an-ideal-retirement-age/|archivedate=7 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the countries listed in the table below are in the process of reforming the ages (see the notes in the table for details). The ages in the table show when an individual retires if they retire/have retired in the year given in the table; the trend in some countries is that in the future the age will increase gradually (where available, explanations are given in the section on notes), therefore one's year of birth determines when one has the age of retirement (e.g. in Romania women born in January 1955 had the retirement age in January 2015 at age 60; those born in January 1958 will retire in January 2019 at age 61; those born in January 1961 will retire in January 2023 at age 62; those born in January 1967 will retire in January 2030 at age 63).&lt;ref name="cjpensiiarad.ro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjpensiiarad.ro/pensii6.php|title=Casa Judeteana de Pensii Arad|publisher=cjpensiiarad.ro|accessdate=23 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805074556/http://www.cjpensiiarad.ro/pensii6.php|archivedate=5 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|{{Further information|Pensions in Canada}}The standard age to begin receiving a CPP retirement pension is when one attains age 65 (the month following the 65th birthday).

|The retirement age for an employee depends on the employment contract. Upon retirement, the retired employee should be given his/her benefits according to the agreement or contract between the employer and the employee. However, if there is no existing retirement plan or agreement for the employee, he/she may retire at the age of 60, given that he/she has served the employer for 5 years, and shall be given a retirement pay of at least half a month’s salary for every year of service (6 months of work given is considered as 1 whole year for the retirement pay).

The average of statutory retirement age in the 34 countries of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in 2014 was males 65 years and females 63.5 years, but the tendency all over the world is to increase the retirement age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = John | last = Scott | url = http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/business/aging-australians-balk-worlds-oldest-retirement-age/ | title = Aging Australians Balk at World’s Oldest Retirement Age | date = 25 June 2014 | publisher = BeritaSatu Media Holdings | location = Jakarta | accessdate = 10 March 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140912153533/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/business/aging-australians-balk-worlds-oldest-retirement-age/ | archivedate = 12 September 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also reflected by the findings that just over half the Asian investors surveyed region-wide said they agreed with raising the retirement age, with a quarter disagreeing and the remainder undecided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.manulife.com/public/news/detail/0,,lang=en&amp;artId=147865&amp;navId=630002,00.html | title = Asians Want To See Official Retirement Ages Rise – Manulife Survey | publisher = The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company | location = Hong Kong | date = 22 May 2014 | accessdate = 10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reform ==
Reforms tend to be phased-in slowly when the retirement age (or pension age) is increased, with [[grandfathering]] ensuring a gradual change. In contrast, when the age of retirement is decreased, changes are often brought about rapidly.&lt;ref name="Blair2014-p107"&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Blair|title=Securing Pension Provision: The Challenge of Reforming the Age of Entitlement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvc7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107|date=8 August 2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-45397-6|page=107|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506014926/https://books.google.com/books?id=hvc7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107|archivedate=6 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One such example of grandfathering are the transitional pension rules which were applied for staff aged 54 years or older, and to some extent for all staff in place, when in 2014 the [[European Civil Service#Pensions|retirement age of European civil servants]] was increased to 66 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Irene Souka|url=http://www.u4unity.eu/document2/SR_HR20130712.pdf#page=12|title=Review of the Staff Regulations|date=July 2013|format=PDF|page=12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219020815/http://www.u4unity.eu/document2/SR_HR20130712.pdf#page=12|archivedate=19 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men either retire later than women or at the same time. This is being addressed in some countries where the retirement ages are being equalised.

The '''Royal Madras Yacht Club (RMYC)''' is a [[yacht club]] located in [[Chennai]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Royal Madras Yacht Club website (History) http://www.rmyc.in/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RMYC-logo.png|thumb|right|Centenary Logo]]
The RMYC was founded by [[Francis Spring|Sir Francis Spring]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;''The Geography of India: Sacred and Historic Places'' (Britannica Educational Publishing), 184.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first sailing club in southern India, and was originally based in what was called the Timber Pond area of the Madras harbour. Soon after its founding the club was granted [[Patronage|royal patronage]] by [[George V]], and it became one of the most prestigious sporting and social clubs in [[British India]]. Today the club is located at Springhaven Wharf, named after its founder.

==History==
[[File:RMYC Then.jpg|thumb|An early photograph of club]]
Sporting sailing in the area first started in [[Ennore]], situated north of Madras, in the early 1900s. Sir Francis Spring, the first Chairman of the Madras Port Trust, founded the Royal Madras Yacht Club in 1911. The first of the Inter-Club Regattas in India was held in 1924 between the [[Yachting Association of Sri Lanka#Clubs|Royal Colombo Yacht Club]] and the RMYC in Madras. It was accorded its 'Royal' status by the [[Emperor of India]], [[George V]], and the name was changed to The Royal Madras Yacht Club on 8 June 1933. The popular class at that time was the ''Bembridge''. The club quickly gained a reputation for its formal atmosphere and it became one of the leading sporting social clubs in the country. After a number of re-locations, the club is situated at its original premises selected by its founder, which has come to be known as the Springhaven Wharf.

Recent decades have seen the facilities of the club improved and modernised. The then Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral [[Radhakrishna Hariram Tahiliani]], inaugurated the new Club House on 4 February 1987. The Club was affiliated to Yachting Association of India after the YAI was formed in 1960 and many national sailing events have since been held at the Club. The Club conducted many regattas in Chennai between 1961 and 1981, including the Madras Port Centenary Regatta in 1971. From 1963 to 1971, The Royal Madras Yacht Club conducted the Inter Club Regatta for the Yachting Association of India and in 1963 the club were runners-up. In 1971, the Club won both the individual and team events. At the international level, club members Deep Rekhi, Kuruvilla Abraham, Drona Narayanan, Navaz Currimbhoy, Sandeep Srikanth, Niloufer Jamal, Rohit Ashok and Varun Prabhakar represented India between 1970 and 2000. During the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], the Club lost 12 Boats and its facilities were badly damaged.

[[File:RMYC MAIN CLUB.jpg|thumb|The club pictured in 2010]][[File:RMYC-j80.jpg|thumb|RMYC fleet of J80 boats - Coast Guard Beach patrol initiative -2014]]
The Club claims that its primary purpose is "to promote the sport of sailing" in all its aspects, and caters for sailors of all ages and abilities. It continues to provide facilities for national and intentional sailing events, in part due to the good sailing conditions off the coast of Chennai. The  RMYC has a fleet of boats comprising Optimists, Lasers, Enterprise, Waterwags, 420 Class, 29ers, Omega and Seabirds. The Club has recently acquired a fleet of J80 boats which is the first in India.

''' SETI@home''' ("SETI at home") is an Internet-based public [[volunteer computing]] project employing the [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing|BOINC]] software platform created by the [[Berkeley SETI Research Center]] and is hosted by the [[Space Sciences Laboratory]], at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Its purpose is to analyze radio signals, searching for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence, and as such is one of many activities undertaken as part of the worldwide [[SETI]] effort. 

SETI@home was released to the public on May 17, 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast23may99_1.htm |publisher=[[NASA]] |title=ET, phone SETI@home! |author=Dr. Tony Phillips |date=May 23, 1999 |accessdate=2006-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001170505/http://science.nasa.gov//newhome/headlines/ast23may99_1.htm |archivedate=October 1, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD |title=How to Search for Aliens |date=May 17, 1999 |access-date=2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/classic.php |title=SETI@home Classic: In Memoriam |date=December 15, 2005 |accessdate=2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the third large-scale use of [[distributed computing]] over the Internet for research purposes, after [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] (GIMPS) was launched in 1996 and [[distributed.net]] in 1997. Along with [[MilkyWay@home]] and [[Einstein@home]], it is the third major computing project of this type that has the investigation of phenomena in interstellar space as its primary purpose.

==Scientific research==
The two original goals of SETI@home were:
* to do useful scientific work by supporting an observational analysis to detect intelligent life outside Earth
* to prove the viability and practicality of the "volunteer computing" concept

The second of these goals is considered to have succeeded completely. The current [[BOINC]] environment, a development of the original SETI@home, is providing support for many computationally intensive projects in a wide range of disciplines.

The first of these goals has to date yielded no conclusive results: no evidence for ETI signals has been shown via SETI@home. However, the ongoing continuation is predicated on the assumption that the observational analysis is not an "ill-posed" one. The remainder of this article deals specifically with the original SETI@home observations/analysis.  The vast majority of the sky (over 98%) has yet to be surveyed, and each point in the sky must be surveyed many times to exclude even a subset of possibilities.

==Procedure details==
SETI@home searches for possible evidence of [[radio]] transmissions from [[extraterrestrial intelligence]] using observational data from the [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo radio telescope]] and the [[Green Bank Telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://seti.berkeley.edu/listen/research.html|title=Berkeley SETI|website=seti.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data is taken "piggyback" or "passively" while the telescope is used for other scientific programs. The data is digitized, stored, and sent to the SETI@home facility. The data are then parsed into small chunks in frequency and time, and analyzed, using software, to search for any signals—that is, variations which cannot be ascribed to noise, and hence contain information. Using distributed computing, SETI@home sends the millions of chunks of data to be analyzed off-site by home computers, and then have those computers report the results. Thus what appears a difficult problem in data analysis is reduced to a reasonable one by aid from a large, Internet-based community of borrowed computer resources.

The software searches for five types of signals that distinguish them from [[Electromagnetic interference|noise]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/about_seti/about_seti_at_home_4.html |title=How SETI@Home Works  - What is SETI@home Looking For? |publisher=SETI@Home Classic |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spikes in [[power spectrum|power spectra]]
* [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]] rises and falls in transmission power, possibly representing the telescope beam's [[main lobe]] passing over a radio source
* Triplets&amp;nbsp;— three power spikes in a row
* [[Pulse (signal processing)|Pulsing]] signals that possibly represent a [[narrowband]] digital-style transmission
* [[Autocorrelation]] detects signal waveforms.

There are many variations on how an ETI signal may be affected by the interstellar medium, and by the relative motion of its origin compared to Earth. The potential "signal" is thus processed in many ways (although not testing all detection methods nor scenarios) to ensure the highest likelihood of distinguishing it from the scintillating noise already present in all directions of outer space. For instance, another planet is very likely to be moving at a speed and acceleration with respect to Earth, and that will shift the frequency, over time, of the potential "signal." Checking for this through processing is done, to an extent, in the SETI@home software.

The process is somewhat like tuning a [[radio]] to various [[Channel (communications)|channels]], and looking at the signal strength meter. If the strength of the signal goes up, that gets attention. More technically, it involves a lot of digital signal processing, mostly [[discrete Fourier transform]]s at various [[chirp]] rates and durations.

==Results==
To date, the project has not confirmed the detection of any [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|ETI]] signals. However, it has identified several candidate targets (sky positions), where the spike in intensity is not easily explained as noisespots,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/candidates.html |title=Signal Candidate |publisher=Classic SETI@home |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; for further analysis. The most significant candidate signal to date was announced on September 1, 2004, named [[Radio source SHGb02+14a]].

While the project has not reached the stated primary goal of finding extraterrestrial intelligence, it has proved to the scientific community that distributed computing projects using Internet-connected computers can succeed as a viable analysis tool, and even beat the largest supercomputers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boincstats.com/en/stats/-1/project/detail |publisher=BOINCstats |title=BOINC combined - Credit overview |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has not been demonstrated that the order of magnitude excess in computers used, many outside the home (the original intent was to use 50,000-100,000 "home" computers),&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/woody_paper.html |title=Sullivan, et al.: Seti@Home |publisher=Seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  has benefited the project scientifically. (For more on this, see {{section link||Challenges to the project}} below.)

[[Astronomer]] [[Seth Shostak]] stated in 2004 that he expects to get a conclusive signal and proof of alien contact between 2020 and 2025, based on the [[Drake equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = Space Daily | title = First Contact Within 20 Years: Shostak | url = http://www.spacedaily.com/news/seti-04e.html | date = 2004-07-22 | last = Shostak | first = Seth | authorlink = Seth Shostak | accessdate = 2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that a prolonged effort may benefit SETI@home, despite its (present) eighteen-year run without success in ETI detection.

==Technology==
Anybody with an at least intermittently Internet-connected computer can participate in SETI@home by running a free program that downloads and analyzes [[radio telescope]] data.

Observational [[data]] are recorded on 2-[[terabyte]] [[SATA]] hard disk drives at the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in Puerto Rico, each holding about 2.5 days of observations, which are then sent to [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="Korpela"&gt;{{cite journal | title = SETI@home&amp;nbsp;— Massively Distributed Computing for SETI | first = Eric | last = Korpela | author2 = Dan Werthimer | author3 = David Anderson | author4 = Jeff Cobb | author5 = Matt Lebofsky | journal = Computing in Science &amp; Engineering |date=January 2001 | pages = 78–83 | url=http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/~korpela/papers/CISE.pdf | doi = 10.1109/5992.895191 | volume = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arecibo does not have a broadband [[Internet access|Internet connection]], so data must go by [[postal mail]] to Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/about_seti/about_seti_at_home_2.html |title=About SETI@home page 2 |publisher=Seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once there, it is divided in both [[time domain|time]] and [[frequency domain]]s ''work units'' of 107 seconds of data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The SETI@home Sky Survey | url = http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/sciencepaper.html | author = SETI@home | date=2001&lt;!-- no valid last modified available --&gt; |
accessdate = 2006-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; or approximately 0.35 [[megabytes]] (350 [[kilobytes]] or 350,000 [[bytes]]), which overlap in time but not in frequency.&lt;ref name="Korpela"/&gt; These work units are then sent from the SETI@home [[Server (computing)|server]] over the [[Internet]] to personal computers around the world to analyze.

The analysis software can search for signals with about one-tenth the strength of those sought in previous surveys, because it makes use of a computationally-intensive [[algorithm]] called ''coherent integration''&lt;!-- this is really not true&amp;nbsp;— see the talk page&amp;nbsp;— need to fix--&gt; that no one else has had the computing power to implement.

Data is merged into a [[database]] using SETI@home computers in Berkeley. [[Interference (communication)|Interference]] is rejected, and various pattern-detection algorithms are applied to search for the most interesting signals.

===Software===
[[File:BOINC Manager Screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing|BOINC]] Manager working on the SETI@home project (v 7.6.22).]]
[[Image:Setiathomeversion5point15.png|thumb|right|Screenshot of SETI@home Enhanced BOINC Screensaver (v6.03)]]
[[Image:Setiathomeversion3point07.JPG|thumb|right|Screenshot of SETI@home Classic Screensaver (v3.07)]]
&lt;!--Generally needs to go much deeper about how the software works internally rather than how it appears to a non-technical participant. Maybe put this in how it section and make this a history section?--&gt;

The SETI@home distributed computing [[software]] runs either as a [[screensaver]] or continuously while a user works, making use of processor time that would otherwise be unused.

The initial software platform, now referred to as "SETI@home Classic," ran from May 17, 1999, to December 15, 2005. This program was only capable of running SETI@home; it was replaced by [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing]] (BOINC), which also allows users to contribute to other distributed computing projects at the same time as running SETI@home. The BOINC platform will also allow testing for more types of signals.

The discontinuation of the SETI@home Classic platform has rendered older [[Macintosh]] computers running the [[classic Mac OS]] unsuitable for participating in the project.

SETI@home is available for the Sony [[PlayStation 3]] console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dotsch.de/boinc/SETI@home%20applications.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108193313/http://www.dotsch.de/boinc/SETI%40home%20applications.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-01-08|title=SETI@home applications|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, 2006, new work units for a new version of SETI@home called "SETI@home Enhanced" started distribution. Since computers now have the power for more computationally intensive work than when the project began, this new version is more sensitive by a factor of two concerning Gaussian signals and to some kinds of pulsed signals than the original SETI@home (BOINC) software. This new application has been optimized to the point where it will run faster on some work units than earlier versions. However, some work units (the best work units, scientifically speaking) will take significantly longer.

In addition, some distributions of the SETI@home applications have been optimized for a particular type of [[CPU]]. They are referred to as "optimized executables" and have been found to run faster on systems specific for that CPU. {{As of|2007}}, most of these applications are optimized for [[Intel]] processors and their corresponding [[instruction set]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lunatics.kwsn.net |title=Seti@Home optimized science apps and information |publisher=Lunatics.kwsn.net |accessdate=2009-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424210331/http://lunatics.kwsn.net/ |archivedate=April 24, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the data processing are normally automatically transmitted when the computer is next connected to the Internet; it can also be instructed to connect to the Internet as needed.

==Statistics==
With over 5.2 million participants worldwide, the project is the distributed computing project with the most participants to date{{when|date=March 2014}}. The original intent of SETI@home was to utilize 50,000-100,000 home computers.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; Since its launch on May 17, 1999, the project has logged over two million years of aggregate computing time.{{as of?|date=May 2012}} On September 26, 2001, SETI@home had performed a total of 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; [[floating point]] operations. It was acknowledged by the 2008 edition of the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the largest computation in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Largest Computation | url = http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/index.asp?id=53519 | work = Guinness World Records | editor = Newport, Stuart | date = 2005&lt;!-- no valid last modified available --&gt; | publisher = HCI Entertainment | accessdate = 2005-12-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051128165405/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/index.asp?id=53519 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2005-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; With over 145,000 active computers in the system (1.4 million total) in 233 countries, {{As of|2013|06|23|lc=on}}, SETI@home had the ability to compute over 668 [[teraFLOPS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boincstats.com/en/stats/0/project/detail |title=SETI@Home Project |publisher=BOINC Stats |accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, the [[Tianhe-2]] computer, which {{As of|2013|06|23|lc=on}} was the world's [[Top500|fastest]] [[supercomputer]], was able to compute 33.86 [[petaFLOPS]] (approximately 50 times greater).

==Project future==
There were plans to get data from the [[Parkes Observatory]] in [[Australia]] to analyze the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/setifuture.html#southern |title=Southern Hemisphere Search - increasing SETI@home's sky coverage in the "Future directions of SETI@home" |publisher=Classic SETI@home website |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{As of|2018|06|03|lc=on}}, these plans were not mentioned in the project's website. Other plans include a Multi-Beam Data Recorder, a Near Time Persistency Checker and [[Astropulse]] (an application that uses coherent dedispersion to search for pulsed signals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/sah_plans.php |title=SETI@home Plans |publisher=SETI@home |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astropulse will team with the original SETI@home to detect other sources, such as rapidly rotating pulsars, exploding primordial black holes, or as-yet unknown astrophysical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/ap_faq.php |title=Astropulse FAQ |publisher=Setiathome.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beta testing of the final public release version of Astropulse was completed in July 2008, and the distribution of work units to higher spec machines capable of processing the more CPU intensive work units started in mid-July 2008.

==Competitive aspect==
SETI@home users quickly started to compete with one another to process the maximum number of work units. Teams were formed to combine the efforts of individual users. The competition continued and grew larger with the introduction of BOINC.

As with any competition, attempts have been made to "cheat" the system and claim credit for work that has not been performed. To combat cheats, the SETI@home system sends every work unit to multiple computers, a value known as "initial replication" (currently '''2'''). Credit is only granted for each returned work unit once a minimum number of results have been returned and the results agree, a value known as "minimum quorum" (currently '''2'''). If, due to computation errors or cheating by submitting false data, not enough results agree, more identical work units are sent out until the minimum quorum can be reached. The final credit granted to all machines which returned the correct result is the same and is the lowest of the values claimed by each machine. The claimed credit by each machine for an identical work unit often varies due to minor differences in floating point arithmetic on different processors.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Some users have installed and run SETI@home on computers at their workplaces&amp;nbsp;— an act known as
"Borging", after the assimilation-driven [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] of ''[[Star Trek]]''. In some cases, SETI@home users have misused company resources to gain work-unit results&amp;nbsp;— with at least two individuals getting fired for running SETI@home on an enterprise production system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1782050.stm |title=BBC 2002 |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-01-28 |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The first firing was much earlier, but needs citation finding before one can use that information--&gt;There is a thread in the newsgroup alt.sci.seti which bears the title "Anyone fired for SETI screensaver" and ran starting as early as September 14, 1999.

Other users collect large quantities of equipment together at home to create "SETI farms", which typically consist of a number of computers consisting of only a [[motherboard]], [[Central processing unit|CPU]], [[RAM]] and [[power supply]] that are arranged on shelves as diskless [[Workstation (computer hardware)|workstations]] running either [[Linux]] or old versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] "headless" (without a monitor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bhs.broo.k12.wv.us/homepage/staff/seti/farms.htm |title=SETI Stack and farm systems |publisher=Bhs.broo.k12.wv.us |accessdate=2009-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131122519/http://bhs.broo.k12.wv.us/homepage/staff/seti/farms.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges to the project==

There are other challenges to the project's future viability.  {{Wikinews|Searching for asteroids, extraterrestrial life a little more rocky: Budget cuts threaten to close Arecibo, world's largest radio telescope}}
Like any project of prolonged duration, there are factors that may result in its termination. Some of these are detailed below:

===Potential closure of Arecibo Observatory===

At present, SETI@home procures its data from the [[Arecibo Observatory]] facility operated by the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center and administered by [[SRI International]].

The decreasing operating budget for the observatory has created a shortfall of funds which has not been made up from other sources such as private donors, [[NASA]], other foreign research institutions, nor private non-profit organizations such as SETI@home.

However, in the overall longterm views held by many involved with the SETI project, any usable radio telescope could take over from Arecibo, as all the SETI systems are portable and relocatable.

===Alternative distributed computing projects===
When the project launched, there were few alternative ways of donating computer time to research projects. However, there are now [[List of distributed computing projects|many other projects]] that are competing for such time.{{quantify|date=May 2015}}

===More restrictive computer use policies in businesses===
In one documented case, an individual was fired for explicitly importing and using the SETI@home software on computers used for the U.S. state of Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2004-10-09  |author=John Adams |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/databases/blog/2004/10/knock_down_then_kick.html |title=Knock Down, Then Kick - O'Reilly Databases |publisher=Oreillynet.com |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another incident a school IT director resigned after his installation allegedly cost his school district $1 million in removal costs; however, other reasons for this firing included lack of communication with his superiors, not installing [[firewall (computing)|firewall]] software and alleged theft of computer equipment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Higley firing tied to alien-search software |date=30 November 2009 |newspaper=The Arizona Republic |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/11/30/20091130searchforaliens1202.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading a [[ZDNet]] editor to comment that "the distributed computing nonsense was simply the best and most obvious excuse the district had to terminate his contract [[Dismissal (employment)#Reasons|with cause]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Christopher Dawson |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/education/admin-fired-for-incompetence-not-alien-search/3408 |title=Admin fired for incompetence, not alien search |publisher=ZDnet.com |date=2009-12-02 |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2005|10|16}}, approximately one-third of the processing for the non-BOINC version of the software was performed on work or school based machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = SETI@home | date = 2005 | url = http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/stats/venues.html | title = SETI@home computer venues | accessdate = 2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many of these computers will give reduced privileges to ordinary users, it is possible that much of this has been done by [[network administrator]]s.

To some extent, this may be offset by [[Internet access#History|better connectivity to home machines]] and [[Moore's law|increasing performance]] of home computers,{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} especially those with [[GPU]]s,&lt;ref name="SETI_GPU"&gt;{{Cite web

 |accessdate=February 19, 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have also benefited other distributed computing projects such as [[Folding@Home]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | title = Folding@Home - GPGPU
 | author = Mike Houston
 | accessdate = February 19, 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of [[mobile computing]] devices provides another large resource for distributed computing. For example, in 2012, Piotr Luszczek (a former doctoral student of [[Jack Dongarra]]), presented results showing that an [[iPad 2]] matched the historical performance of a [[Cray-2]] (the fastest computer in the world in 1985) on an embedded [[LINPACK]] benchmark.&lt;ref name="iPad2_Cray2"&gt;{{Cite web

===Funding===
There is currently no government [[funding]] for SETI research, and private funding is always limited.  Berkeley Space Science Lab has found ways of working with small budgets, and the project has received donations allowing it to go well beyond its original planned duration, but it still has to compete for limited funds with other SETI projects and other space sciences projects.

In a December 16, 2007 plea for donations, SETI@home stated its present modest state and urged donations of $476,000 needed for continuation into 2008.

===Unofficial clients===
A number of individuals and companies made unofficial changes to the distributed part of the software to try to produce faster results, but this compromised the integrity of all the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The SETI@Home Problem | journal = Crossroads | date = 2000 | first = David | last = Molnar | volume = 7 | issue = 1| id = | url = http://oldwww.acm.org/crossroads/xrds7-1/september2000.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120715134754/http://oldwww.acm.org/crossroads/xrds7-1/september2000.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-07-15 | accessdate = 2011-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the software had to be updated to make it easier to detect such changes, and discover unreliable clients.  [[BOINC]] will run on unofficial clients; however, clients that return different and therefore incorrect data are not allowed, so corrupting the result database is avoided.
BOINC relies on cross-checking to validate data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/SecurityIssues |title=SecurityIssues - BOINC - Trac |publisher=Boinc.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; but unreliable clients need to be identified, to avoid situations when two of these report the same invalid data and therefore corrupt the database.
A very popular unofficial client (lunatic) allows users to take advantage of the special features provided by their processor(s) such as [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]], [[SSE2]], [[SSE3]], [[SSSE3]], [[SSE4|SSE4.1]], and [[Advanced Vector Extensions|AVX]] to allow for faster processing. The only downside to this is that if the user selects features that their processor(s) do not support, the chances of bad results and crashes rise significantly. {{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Tools (such as [[CPU-Z]]) are freely available to tell users what features are supported by their processor(s).

===Hardware and database failures===
Currently, {{when|date=May 2014}} SETI@home is a test bed for further development not only of [[BOINC]] but of other hardware and software (database) technology. Under SETI@home processing loads these experimental technologies can be more challenging than expected, as SETI databases do not have typical accounting and business data or relational structures. The non-traditional database uses often do incur greater processing overheads and risk of database corruption and outright database failure. Hardware, software and database failures can (and do) cause dips in project participation.

The project has had to shut down several times to change over to new databases capable of handling more massive datasets. Hardware failure has proven to be a substantial source of project shutdowns—as hardware failure is often coupled with database corruption.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45418">'''Sex in advertising''' is the use of [[sex appeal]] in [[advertising]] to help sell a particular product or service. According to research, sexually appealing imagery does not need to pertain to the product or service in question. A few examples of sexually appealing imagery include [[nudity]], [[pin-up model]]s, and muscular men. "Sex sells" became a controversial issue, with techniques for enlarging and titillating the audience challenging conventional moral standards.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger Streitmatter, ''Sex sells!: The media's journey from repression to obsession'' (Basic Books, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Dawn Blair, et al., "Ethics in advertising: sex sells, but should it?." ''Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues'' 9.1/2 (2006): 109+.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary mainstream advertising (e.g., magazines, online, television), sex is present in promotional messages for a wide range of branded goods. Ads often feature provocative images of well-defined women (and men) in revealing outfits and postures selling things such as clothing, alcohol, beauty products, and fragrances. Advertisers such as Calvin Klein, Victoria's Secret, and Pepsi (just to name a few) use these images to cultivate a sexy media presence. Also, sexual information is used to promote mainstream products not traditionally associated with sex. For example, [[Dallas Opera]]'s recent reversal of its declining ticket sales has been attributed to the marketing of the more lascivious parts of its performances.&lt;ref&gt;Chism, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sex in advertising research: A review of content, effects, and functions of sexual information in consumer advertising|year=2002|pages=241–73|journal=Annu. Rev. Sex Res.|volume=13|author=Tom Reichert|pmid=12836733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of sex in advertising can be highly overt or extremely subtle and, on some level, subliminal. It ranges from relatively explicit displays of sexual acts and seductive behavior aimed at the viewer, to the use of double-meanings and underlying sexual references that are more subconscious. Sex in advertising relies on evolutionary processes and varies in effectiveness depending on the culture and gender of the receiver. The use of sex in advertising has been criticized for its tendency to objectify the female body and emphasizing various stereotypes.

==Concept==
''Gender Advertisements'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goffman |first1=Erving |title=Gender Advertisements |date=March 1, 1979 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=0060906332 |pages=84 |edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 1979 book by Canadian social anthropologist, [[Erving Goffman]] is series of studies of visual communication and how gender representation in advertising communicates subtle, underlying messages about the sexual roles projected by masculine and feminine images in advertising. The book is a visual essay about sex roles in advertising and the differences, as well as the symbolism implied in the depictions of men and women in advertising.

When couples are used in an advertisement, the sex-roles played by each also send out messages. The interaction of the couple may send out a message of relative dominance and power, and may stereotype the roles of one or both partners. Usually the message is very subtle, and sometimes advertisements attract interest by changing stereotypical roles. For example, companies including [[Spotify]], [[AirBnB]], [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] have used same-sex couples in adverts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=13 amazing adverts featuring same-sex couples|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/08/13/13-amazing-adverts-featuring-same-sex-couples/|website=PinkNews|accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These adverts appeal to same-sex couples; and they also create the image that these companies are tolerant and allow them to appeal to a wider consumer audience.

As many consumers and professionals think, sex is used to grab a viewer's attention but this is a short-term success. Whether using sex in advertising is effective depends on the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/2008/03/does-sex-in-adv.html|title=DOES SEX IN ADVERTISING WORK?|publisher=Branding Strategy Insider|accessdate=2015-03-31|date=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About three-quarters of advertisements using sex to sell the product are communicating a product-related benefit, such as the product making its users more sexually attractive. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Types==

===Physical attractiveness===
The use of physically attractive models in advertising is a form of sex in advertising. Physical attractiveness can be conveyed through facial beauty, physique, hair, skin complexion as well as by the model's inferred personality. This form of sex in advertising is effective as it draws attention and influences the overall feeling of the ad. Furthermore, such ads create an association between physical attractiveness and the product which sends a message to the consumer buying it that they will help them achieve that physique.&lt;ref name="Reichert"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reichert|first1=Tom|title=Sex in advertising: Perspectives on the erotic appeal|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|pages=11–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  [[sexual arousal]] possibly elicited by physical attractiveness in adverts is thought to transfer onto the advertised product.&lt;ref name="AABerger"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Arthur Asa|title=Ads, fads and Consumer culture|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=99–120|edition=Fifth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual behaviour===
Marketers often use tactics such as using sexual imagery in their advertisements to capture the consumer's attention for longer.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, Sengupta &amp; Vohs (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Sex in advertising is also incorporated using hints of [[sexual behaviour]]. The latter is communicated by the models using flirtatious [[body language]], open posture and making eye contact with the viewer. Sexual behaviour can also be displayed using several models interacting in a more or less sexual way. Sexual behaviour in advertising is used to arouse sexual interest from the viewer.&lt;ref name="Reichert" /&gt; Research has shown that sexual arousal elicited by an advert subsequently affects the overall ad evaluation and the chances of future purchase.&lt;ref name="AABerger" /&gt;

For example, in a Guess clothing advert, while the models are physically attractive, it is their behavior such as position, posture and facial expressions that communicate sexual interest to the viewer. Women are often shown as being shorter, put in the background of images, shown in more ‘feminine’ poses than men, and generally present a higher degree of ‘body display’ than men in print advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zotos|first=Yorgos|last2=Tsichla|first2=Eirini|date=October 2014|title=Snapshots of Men and Women in Interaction:  An Investigation of Stereotypes in Print Advertisement Relationship Portrayals|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267842958|journal=Journal of Euromarketing|volume=23|issue=3|pages=35–58|via=ResearchGate|doi=10.9768/0023.03.035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual referents===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:VW topless.png|thumb|282x282px|Volkswagen advert for the "topless" Beetle Cabriolet]] --&gt;
Sexual referents are a more implicit example of sex in advertising. Sex can be invoked in advertising using sexual double entendre or innuendos. The latter rely on the viewer to interpret them. They can be words or images that while not being explicitly sexual, trigger sexual thoughts from the viewer. Elements such as lighting, music, models’ behaviour and camera effects can contribute towards communicating implicit sexual meaning. Sexual referents are a powerful tool as they drive viewers to create sexual thoughts and interpretations of the product.&lt;ref name="Reichert" /&gt;

While sexual referents are an implicit use of sex in advertising, as there may be nothing overtly sexual about them, they are placed by advertisers in the aim that viewers will interpret them as sexual.

An example of sexual referents is [[Volkswagen]]'s campaign for the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]] Cabriolet. The advert pixelates the non-existent roof to the car, similar to the pixilation that occurs when female's breasts are exposed in some forms of media. Volkswagen have a history of producing tongue-in-cheek adverts, and this one serves to compare their new convertible to a woman who goes topless at a beach. It implies the car is relaxed and fun, like someone who goes topless at a beach.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Super chocolate cake vagina Moist.jpg|left|thumb|168x168px|Betty Crocker cake mix advert using sexual embed technique]] --&gt;

===Sexual embeds===
Sexual embeds are a controversial form of sex in advertising. They are a powerful technique that advertising agencies do not want consumers to consciously notice. They are [[subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] elements that are detected as sexual information solely at the subconscious level. Sexual embeds can take the form of objects or words that, at the subconscious level (or when occasionally consciously identified) explicitly depict sexual acts or genitalia. For example, a perfume bottle could mimic a phallic shape and its positioning could suggest sexual intercourse. Embeds are especially effective as they unconsciously trigger sexual arousal in the consumer which drives motivation and goal directed behaviour such as purchase intention.&lt;ref name="Reichert" /&gt;

An example of this technique is a particular cake mix advertisement from [[Betty Crocker]] in which it would appear the chocolate icing on the heel of the cake has been painted to look like [[female genitalia]]. Amongst millions who viewed the commercial, very few will have noticed anything unusual; however, while this detail might not have been consciously perceived, it would have been interpreted sexually at the [[subconscious]] level. This advertisement, directed at women, puts an emphasis on the [[sense of touch]] by using words such as "moist", and on the whole the ad creates a subconscious association between the product and [[sexual pleasure]].&lt;ref name="Reichert" /&gt;

===Gender roles===
After women achieved the vote in the United States, Britain and Canada in the 1920s, advertising agencies exploited the new status of women. For example, they associated driving an automobile with masculinity, power, control, and dominance over a beautiful woman sitting alongside. More subtly, they published automobile ads in women's magazines, at a time when the vast majority of purchasers and drivers were in fact men.  The new ads promoted themes of women's liberation while also delineating the limits of this freedom. Automobiles were more than practical devices. They were also highly visible symbols of affluence, mobility and modernity.  The ads offered women a visual vocabulary to imagine their new social and political roles as citizens and to play an active role in shaping their identity as modern women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Einav | first1 = Rabinovitch-Fox | year = 2016 | title = Baby, You Can Drive My Car: Advertising Women's Freedom in 1920s America | url = | journal = American Journalism | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 372–400 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary theory ==
[[File:AN Aurora Jolie 1.jpg|thumb|209x209px|An example of a product being paired with sexual imagery to create an association between the two. The logo of the product this model is promoting is printed on the [[pasties]] (on her breasts).]]
Research into evolution explains the use of sex in advertising and the differences between genders, due to different [[Mating strategy|mating strategies]]. It is the biological prerogative of the male to reproduce with as many females as possible, as this increases his chances of producing [[offspring]]. Because of this need to reproduce as much as possible, males search for cues which signal females are available and accessible, such as seductive behaviour, as well as cues that indicate good health, including facial symmetry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thornhill &amp; Gangstead|year=1996|title=The evolution of human sexuality|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49758142|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|volume=11|issue=2|pages=98–102|doi=10.1016/0169-5347(96)81051-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; shiny hair and firm breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havlíček |first=Jan|display-authors=etal |year=2016|title=Men's preferences for women's breast size and shape in four cultures|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513816302847|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=In Press|issue=2|pages=217–226|via=|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2016.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisers can use these findings to help create an association between their product and the males needs by pairing the two.

Evolutionary research into female sex strategies show that women are more concerned about long term prospects and mates resources,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss |first=D |last2=Schmitt |first2=D.|year=1993|title=Sexual strategies theory: an evolutionary perspective on human mating|url=|journal=Psychological Review|volume=100.2|issue=2|pages=204–232|via=|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.100.2.204}}&lt;/ref&gt; and less interested in typical male requirements of good health and accessibility. This explains why sexually explicit adverts tend to be directed at male consumers, whereas products aimed at a female market typically involve romantic imagery, and males who are wealthy, intelligent or powerful.

==History==
{{main|History of advertising}}
The earliest known use of sex in advertising is by the Pearl Tobacco brand in 1871, which featured a naked maiden on the package cover. In 1885, W. Duke &amp; Sons inserted trading cards into cigarette packs that featured sexually provocative starlets. Duke grew to become the leading American cigarette brand by 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1916-skin-touch-soap-ad.jpg|thumb|320x320px|1916 ''Ladies' Home Journal''  version of the famous seduction-based ad by [[Helen Lansdowne Resor]]  at J. Walter Thompson Agency]] Other early forms of sex appeal in advertising include woodcuts and illustrations of attractive women (often unclothed from the waist up) adorning posters, signs, and ads for [[bar (establishment)|saloon]]s, [[patent medicine|tonic]]s, and [[tobacco]]. In several notable cases, sex in advertising has been claimed as the reason for increased consumer interest and sales.

===Sex and soap===
[[Woodbury's Facial Soap]], a woman's beauty bar, was almost discontinued in 1911. The soap's sales decline was reversed, however, with ads containing images of romantic couples and promises of love and intimacy for those using the brand.&lt;ref&gt;''Account Histories'', 1926&lt;/ref&gt; Jovan Musk Oil, introduced in 1971, was promoted with sexual entendre and descriptions of the fragrance's sexual attraction properties. As a result, Jovane, Inc.'s revenue grew from $1.5 million in 1971 to $77 million by 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Sloan &amp; Millman, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

===KamaSutra condoms in India===
In 1991, J.K. Chemicals Group asked the [[Bombay]] office of Lintas Bombay to develop a campaign for a new [[condom]] brand. The problem was that in the late 1940s, the [[Nehru]] government had launched a major population limitation program to reduce India's birthrate. The program was very heavy-handed, using coercion, and demanding that men use condoms.  The product therefore signified an oppressive governmental intrusion.  The agency head hit on the idea of a pleasurable condom, "So when the user hears the brand name, he says, "Wow. It's a turn on. Not a turn off."  A brainstorming session hit on the name "[[KamaSutra (brand)|KamaSutra]]", which refers to [[Kama Sutra|an ancient Sanskrit treatise on lovemaking]] and the sculptures at temples that illustrate the positions involved.  The term was known to well-educated Indians, and that was the intended audience.  Correctly predicting the huge impact the ad campaign would have, the agency purchased all the advertising space in the popular glamour magazine ''[[Debonair (magazine)|Debonair]]'' and filled it with erotic images of [[Bollywood]] actors and actresses promoting KamaSutra condoms. A television commercial followed featuring a steamy shower scene. The television ad was censored but the print campaign proved highly successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Barr | first1 = William M. | year = 2008 | title = Advertising in India | url = | journal = Advertising &amp; Society Review | volume = 9 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Mazzarella, ''Shoveling Smoke: Advertising and Globalization in Contemporary India'' (Duke University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benetton===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Priest Benetton Nun.jpg|thumb|190x190px|Nun and Priest kissing in a Benetton United Colours advert]] --&gt;
The Italian clothing company [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] gained worldwide attention in the late 20th century for its saucy advertising, inspired by its art director [[Oliviero Toscani]]. He started with multicultural themes, tied together under the campaign "United Colors of Benetton" then became increasingly provocative with interracial groupings, and unusual sexual images, such as a nun kissing a priest.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Tungate, ''Adland: A Global History of Advertising'' (2007) pp 146–49&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Brooke shields calvin klein jeans.jpg|left|thumb|268x268px|Calvin Klein advert featuring Brooke Shields]] --&gt;

===Calvin Klein - sex and jeans===
[[Calvin Klein]] of '''Calvin Klein [[Jeans]]''' has been at the forefront of this movement to use sex in advertising, having claimed, "Jeans are about sex. The abundance of bare flesh is the last gasp of advertisers trying to give redundant products a new identity." Calvin Klein's first controversial jeans advertisement showed a 15-year-old [[Brooke Shields]], in Calvin Klein jeans, saying, "Do you want to know what gets between me and my Calvins? Nothing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sischy |first=Ingrid |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/04/calvin200804?currentPage=7 |title=Vanity Fair Calvin Klein |publisher=Vanityfair.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calvin Klein]] has also received media attention for its controversial advertisements in the mid-1990s. Several of Calvin Klein's advertisements featured images of teenage models, some "who were reportedly as young as 15" in overly sexual and provocative poses.&lt;ref name="Calvin Klein: A Case Study"&gt;[http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/educational/handouts/ethics/calvin_klein_case_study.cfm Calvin Klein: A Case Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521174126/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/educational/handouts/ethics/calvin_klein_case_study.cfm |date=2012-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Klein insisted that these advertisements were not pornographic, some considered the campaign as a form of "[[soft porn]]" or "[[kiddie porn]]" that was exploitative, shocking, and suggestive. In 1999, Calvin Klein was the subject of more controversy when it aired advertisements of young children who were only wearing the brand's underwear. This "kiddie underwear ad campaign" was pulled only one day after it aired as a result of public outlash.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Robert. [http://store.soliscompany.com/kpoco.html "Kiddie Porn" Controversy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725074812/http://store.soliscompany.com/kpoco.html |date=2009-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson from Calvin Klein insisted that these ads were intended "to capture the same warmth and spontaneity that you find in a family snapshot."&lt;ref name="Calvin Klein: A Case Study"/&gt;

==Effectiveness==

===Effective use===
Gallup &amp; Robinson, an advertising and marketing research firm, has reported that in more than 50 years of testing advertising effectiveness, it has found the use of the erotic to be a significantly above-average technique in communicating with the marketplace, "...although one of the more dangerous for the advertiser. Weighted down with taboos and volatile attitudes, sex is a Code Red advertising technique ... handle with care ... seller beware; all of which makes it even more intriguing." This research has led to the popular idea that ''"sex sells"''.&lt;ref name="Sex sells"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex sells!: The media's journey from repression to obsession|last=Streitmatter|first=Roger|publisher=Basic Books|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketing strategies centred around sex have been successful. [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] used sex to market their brand in a variety of ways, including store greeters dressed only in underwear, models working in store and topless models on the bags. Employees were hired based on physical attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/05/07/abercrombie-and-fitch-hollister-sexual-marketing/70934572/|title=Cover up! Abercrombie &amp; Fitch says sexual marketing is over|website=USA today|last1=Bowerman|first1=Mary|accessdate=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy was aimed at teenagers and young adults, who are the most impressionable consumer group, and who have vast amounts of disposable money. During the late 1990s, the company produced a magazine/catalogue (magalog), featuring semi-nude or nude models. The magalog was a success, with A&amp;F issuing over 1.5 million copies. Despite being somewhat paradoxical, the use of sexual branding raised their revenue from $85 million in 1993 to $1.35 billion in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2005|title=Message Communication in Advertising: Selling the Abercrombie and Fitch Image|url=https://www.uwlax.edu/urc/jur-online/PDF/2005/driessen.pdf|journal=UW-L Journal of Undergraduate Research VIII|last1=Driessen|first1=Claire|accessdate=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A&amp;F have expressed that they will move away from sexual marketing, and focus on showcasing product and trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/shirts-boys-abercrombie-says-its-done-sexualized-marketing-164300|title=Shirts on, Boys.

Sexuality in advertising is extremely effective at attracting the consumer's attention and once it has their attention, to remember the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=James|last2=McClelland|first2=Alastair|last3=Furnham|first3=Adrian|date=2015-03-01|title=Sex Really Does Sell: The Recall of Sexual and Non-sexual Television Advertisements in Sexual and Non-sexual Programmes|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=210–216|doi=10.1002/acp.3095|issn=1099-0720}}&lt;/ref&gt; This solves the greatest problem in advertising of getting the potential buyer to look at and remember the advertisement. However the introduction of attraction and especially sexuality into an ad often distracts from the original message and can cause an adverse effect of the consumer wanting to take action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=6040|title=Sexual Content and Advertising Effectiveness: Comments on Belch Et Al.

=== Ineffective use ===

There are some studies that contradict the theory that sex is an effective tool for improving finances and gathering attention. A study from 2009 found that there was a negative correlation between nudity and sexuality in movies, and box office performance and critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/aca-3-4-200.pdf |title=Sex Doesn't Sell—Nor Impress!

It is hypothesized by that survey, that this is a result of a general numbing caused by over use of [[sexual stimuli]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergencemarketing.com/2005/10/25/sex-in-ads-does-not-sell/ |title=Sex in ads does not sell |publisher=Emergencemarketing.com |date=2005-10-25 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in advertising.

In another experimental study conducted on 324 undergraduate college students, [[Brad Bushman]] examined brand recall for neutral, sexual or violent commercials embedded in neutral, sexual or violent TV programs. He found that brand recall was higher for participants who saw neutral TV programs and neutral commercials versus those who saw sexual or violent commercials embedded in sexual or violent TV programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bushman|first=Brad|title=That was a great commercial, but what were they selling?

Unless sex is related to the product (such as beauty, health or hygiene products) there is not clear effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.uga.edu/releases/article/magazine-trends-study-finds-increase-in-advertisements-using-sex/|title=Magazine trends study finds increase in advertisements using sex|date=2012-06-05|publisher=uga.edu|accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7624485|title=Violence and Sex in Television Programs Do Not Sell Products in Advertisements|date=2012-06-05|publisher=researchgate.net|accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using sex may attract one market demographic while repelling another at the same time.  The overt use of sexuality to promote [[breast cancer awareness]], through fundraising campaigns like "I Love Boobies" and "Save the Ta-tas", is effective at reaching younger women, who are at low risk of developing breast cancer, but angers and offends some breast [[cancer survivor]]s and older women, who are at higher risk of developing breast cancer.&lt;ref name="Szabo"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/30/patients-decry-sexualization-of-breast-cancer/1630911/ |title=Sexy breast cancer campaigns anger many patients|last=Szabo|first=Lisa|date=30 October 2012 |work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender differences ===

Recent research indicates that the use of sexual images of females in ads negatively affects women's interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-12-women-sexually-explicit-ads-unappealingunless.html#inlRlv |title=Women find sexually explicit ads unappealing—unless the price is right |publisher=medicalxpress.com |date=2013-12-03 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that females were more likely than males to be portrayed as nude, wearing sexual clothing or only a partial amount of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soley|first=Lawrence|year=1986|title=Sex in Advertising: A Comparison of 1964 and 1984 Magazine Advertisements|url=|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=15|issue=3|pages=46–64|via=|doi=10.1080/00913367.1986.10673018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 2013 of how printed ads with sexual content affects women clearly showed that women are not attracted to them except in the case of products being luxurious and expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/sex-doesnt-sell-this-study-into-womens-response-to-raunchy-advertising-starts-wrong-and-gets-worse-8995776.html |title=Sex doesn't sell?

Further research &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sengupta|first=J|year=2008|title=Gender-related reactions to gratuitous sex appeals in advertising|url=|journal=Journal of Consumer Advertising|volume=18|pages=62–78|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2007.10.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that men have a positive attitude to sexual adverts, whereas women have a negative response to them, this study used an advert with both a male and female. This was thought to be because women had lower average [[sex drive]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s than men. Another theory for this difference is that evolution has led men to seek casual sex, contrary to women who value commitment and intimacy in the context of a sexual relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herold|year=1993|title=Gender differences in casual sex and AIDS prevention: A survey of dating bars.|url=|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=30|pages=36–42|via=|doi=10.1080/00224499309551676}}&lt;/ref&gt; In adverts sex tends to be represented in its own right and not as part of a relationship leading to the difference in responses. This theory is supported by research which found that women respond less negatively to sexual adverts when it is in the context of gift giving from a man to a women. Therefore, react less negatively when the sexuality of the advert is the context of commitment. Men respond more negatively to the sexual advert when it involves gift giving as it emphasises them having to spend money in a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahl|first=Darren|year=2009|title=Sex in advertising: Gender differences and the role of relationship commitment|url=|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=36|issue=2|pages=215–231|via=|doi=10.1086/597158|citeseerx=10.1.1.620.2353}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in line with evolutionary theory that women value men for their resources and men value women for sex and fertility &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=David|year=1989|title=Sex differences in human mate preferences: Evolutionary hypotheses tested in 37 cultures|url=|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=12|pages=1–14|via=|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00023992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research found that even in men recall of the advert is worsened by sexual content, as they focus on breasts and legs but not on the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nudd|year=2005|title=Does sex really sell?|url=|journal=Adweek|volume=46|pages=14–17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural differences ===
In order to be consistent, brands use standardized campaigns across various countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Argawal|first=Wadhu|year=1995|title=Review of a 40-year debate in international advertising: Practitioner and academician perspectives to the standardization/adaptation issue|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=12|pages=26–48|doi=10.1108/02651339510080089}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural differences have been found in response to sexual adverts. A 2016 study by the Korea Internet Advertising Foundation (KIAF) noted that 94.5% of South Korean high schoolers were familiar with sex-driven ads, 83.4% of adults thought such ads have negative influence on society, and 91.2% said there are too many of such ads. A KIAF official noted that government legislation aimed to reduce such ads is not effective due to its ambiguity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://koreabizwire.com/internet-ads-with-sexual-imagery-at-a-critical-level-survey/65968?platform=hootsuite|title=Internet Ads with Sexual Imagery at a Critical Level: Survey {{!}} Be Korea-savvy|website=koreabizwire.com|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has found that sex is used in adverts more in [[France]] than in the [[United States]] because they are more sexually liberated and so receptive to its use in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biswas|year=1992|title=A comparison of print advertisements from the United States and France|url=|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=21|issue=4|pages=73–81|doi=10.1080/00913367.1992.10673387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
In the [[21st century]], the use of increasingly explicit sexual imagery in consumer-oriented print ads have become almost commonplace.  Ads for jeans, [[perfume]]s and many other products have featured provocative images that were designed to elicit sexual responses from as large a cross section of the population as possible, to shock by their ambivalence, or to appeal to repressed sexual desires, which are thought to carry a stronger emotional load.  Increased tolerance, more tempered censorship, emancipatory developments and increasing buying power of previously neglected appreciative target groups in rich markets (mainly in the West) have led to a marked increase in the share of attractive flesh 'on display'.

''[[Advertising Age|Ad Age]]'', a magazine delivering news, analysis, and data on marketing and media, published a list of Top 100 most effective advertising of the century, out of the 100, only 8 involved use of sex.&lt;ref name=Garfield&gt;{{cite news |author=Garfield, Bob |date=29 March 1999 |title=Top 100 Advertising Campaigns of the Century |url=http://adage.com/century/campaigns.html |newspaper=Ad Age|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In international perspective, a 2008 comparison of nudity in television advertising in [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Germany]], [[South Korea]], [[Thailand]], and the [[United States]] reveals that China and the United States have the most demure ads, while Germany and Thailand exposed more of the female body. There is little variation in male undress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = Michelle R. | last2 = Paek | first2 = Hye-Jin | year = 2008 | title = Nudity of female and male models in primetime TV advertising across seven countries | url = | journal = International Journal of Advertising | volume = 27 | issue = 5| pages = 715–744 | doi=10.2501/s0265048708080281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, sex in advertising has focused on heterosexual gender roles, but there are increasing examples of sex being used to advertise to the [[LGBT]] community. The New Zealand Aids Foundation's Love Your Condom (LYC) campaign used provocative images of males alongside captions such as "Riding hard?", "Bear hunting?" and "Going deep?", followed by the hashtag #loveyourcondom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loveyourcondom.co.nz/condoms|title=Order free condoms|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=New Zealand Aids Foundation|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was hoped by using images explicitly directed towards homosexual men, their use of condoms would increase, which would help decrease rates of HIV transmission amongst gay and bisexual men. The campaign has been successful, with a 12% in new [[HIV]] infections among [[Men who have sex with men|MSM]] in [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=New Zealand Aids Foundation |title=History of NZAF |url=https://www.nzaf.org.nz/about-us/history-of-nzaf/|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted at the University of Georgia in 2003, researchers looked at sexual advertisements in magazines over the span of the last 30 years. The rate at which sex in advertising is being used increased from 15% to 27% in the advertisements that the researchers looked at. Their reasoning behind the increase is because they believe sex still sells, specifically with “low-risk products impulse purchases.” The study also mentions “alcohol, entertainment and beauty are the main product categories that use sex in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/2649-sex-sells-more.html|title=Why Sex Sells…More Than Ever|newspaper=Business News Daily|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

=== Stereotypes===
The use of sex in advertising has been criticized for its tendency to reinforce sexist stereotypes. Since the late 1970s, many researchers have determined that advertisements depict women as having less social power than men, but the ways in which females are displayed as less powerful than men have evolved over time. In modern times, advertisements have displayed women's expanding roles in the professional realm and importance in business backgrounds. However, as this change occurred there has been a substantial increase in the number of images that showcase women as less sexually powerful than men and as objects of men's desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stankiewicz and Rosselli|first1=Julie and Francine|title=Women as Sex Objects and Victims in Print Advertisements|journal=Sex Roles|date=2008|issue=58.7|pages=579–589|doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9359-1|volume=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objectification ===

Furthermore, sex in advertising has been criticised for its emphasis on the importance of physical attractiveness and role as mate. This emphasis has led men and women to value intelligence and general skills less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advertising and Society|last=Pardun|first=Carol|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rise in awareness of sexism portrayed in these types of adverts has led to stricter advertising policies. One group that enforces these rules is the [[Advertising Women of New York]] association. Adverts using highly sexual images containing nudity and unrealistic physiques can lead to self-objectification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|year=2004|title=Mere exposure:effects of priming a state of self-objectification|url=|journal=Sex Roles|volume=51|pages=17–28|via=|doi=10.1023/b:sers.0000032306.20462.22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, this can lead to shame, disgust, appearance anxiety, eating disorders and depression. The increase in self-objectification caused by the use of sex in advertising has been found in women and men. The latter is not surprising with the increased sexual portrayal of men in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reichart|first=Tom|year=1999|title=Cheesecake and beefcake: No matter how you slice it, sexual explicitness in advertising continues to increase.|url=|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|volume=76|pages=7–20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social norms ===

Sex in advertising is an accepted marketing technique however it is not unusual for it to cause backlash when it breaks social norms. In 1995, the Calvin Klein advertising campaign (see section on Calvin Klein, above) that showed teenage models in provocative poses wearing Calvin Klein underwear and jeans was deemed inappropriate and shocking. The ads were withdrawn when parents and child welfare groups threatened to protest and Hudson stores did not want their stores associated with the ads. It was reported that the [[US Justice Department]] was investigating the ad campaign for possible violations of federal child pornography and exploitation laws. The Justice Department subsequently decided not to prosecute Calvin Klein for these alleged violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-16/business/fi-3736_1_calvin-klein|title=Justice Department Plans No Charges Over Calvin Klein Ads|publisher=Articles.latimes.com|accessdate=2015-03-31|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1995-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skyy Vodka ===
[[Skyy Vodka]] is known for using sex in their advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://epowers1.blogspot.com/2012/02/i-think-we-can-all-agree-with-statement.html|title=Liz's Media Criticism Blog: Skyy Ad Campaign Sells More Than Just Vodka|last=Powers|first=Liz|date=2012-02-16|website=Liz's Media Criticism Blog|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}} In a specific Skyy Vodka advertisement, which was a part of Skyy Vodkas “SKYY SEXY” campaign in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100928006244/en/CORRECTING-REPLACING-Skyy-Spirits-Unveils-Sexiest-Ad|title=CORRECTING and REPLACING Skyy Spirits Unveils Sexiest Ad Campaign in SKYY® Vodka History    {{!}} Business Wire|website=www.businesswire.com|access-date=2016-12-12|date=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; a woman's legs are wrapped around a bottle of Skyy Vodka. Bruce Lee Livingston, of the [[Marin Institute]] stated “This is just ridiculous, It’s a porn-a-hol”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2010-09-28-vodka28_ST_N.htm|title=Skyy pushes the envelope with sexy ad campaign - USATODAY.com|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to mention its affect on underage kids. “Underage kids will look at this and associate sexual prowess with drinking Skyy.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Skyy Vodka’s marketing director, Maura McGinn, defended the advertisement by stating, “It’s the content of our product...We’re an adult product consumed mostly in the evenings and in flirtatious situations.” McGinn even defended the advertisement when pitted against the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S. ad code that states, “Beverage alcohol advertising and marketing materials should not rely upon sexual prowess or sexual success as a selling point for the brand.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discus.org/responsibility/code/|title=Code of Responsible Practices {{!}} DISCUS|website=www.discus.org|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGinn stated “There is nothing in our ad that would suggest we are making such a claim.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Therapy freedom''' is the freedom of [[physicians]] to apply whichever therapy their medical knowledge makes them believe to be appropriate. That often means:
# Physician have the [[legal right]] to prescribe an unlicensed drug.
# A [[health insurance company]] is obliged to pay for the treatment, regardless of whether or not it considers the treatment to be appropriate.

Therapy freedom, however, is limited to cases of no treatment existing that is both well-established and more [[efficacious]].

Therapy freedom is established in [[Germany]], where it is known as ''[[:de:Therapiefreiheit|Therapiefreiheit]]''.

In contrast to shapes and patterns we have very little evidence on the colours used.

== History and types ==
The Thracians wore a [[tunic]], a cloak called ''zeira'' ([[Ancient Greek]]: ζείρα), a cap called ''[[alopekis]]'' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Αλωπεκίς) made from the scalp of a fox with the ears visible,&lt;ref name="Webber18"/&gt; other [[Phrygian cap]] styles, and fawnskin boots called ''embades'' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Εμβάδες). Thracian clothing was sometimes decorated with intricate patterns. While [[pattern]]ed clothing was not unique to Thracians, the ''zeira'', ''embades'' and the ''alopekis'' probably originated from them.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Clothing was made from hemp, flax or wool.&lt;ref&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dacians]] and the [[Getae]] wore pantaloons called [[bracae]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0062:entry=bracae-harpers&amp;highlight=dacians bracae-harpers]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Ancient Greek]],"''ἀναξυρίδες''" or "''θύλακοι''").These loose pants were described in Euripides work as “variegated bags” ([[Ancient Greek]],"''τοὺς θυλάκους τοὺς ποικίλους''")  and may have appeared highly ridiculous to the Greeks, although [[Ovid]] mentions the adoption of them by the descendants of some of the Greek colonists on the Euxine.These trousers were common in many nations.

===Classical era===
[[File:Peltaste.JPG|thumb|right|Thracian [[peltast]] from a [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] wearing patterned clothing]]
In the north only noble Thracians, the "[[Zibythides]]" and noble [[Dacians]], the "[[Pileati]]", would wear caps.&lt;ref name="Webber18"/&gt; Despite this [[Herodotus]] writes that all Thracians in the [[Persian army]] wore foxskin caps and multicoloured mantles. Northern tribes in general, both Thracians and [[Daco-Getians]], wore clothes similar to [[Scythians]].&lt;ref name="Webber18"/&gt;

===Hellenistic era===
The Thracians at [[Battle of Pydna|Pydna]] in 168 BC wore black tunics. The [[Kausia]] ([[Ancient Greek]]: Καυσία) was adopted from the [[Macedon]]ians&lt;ref&gt;Saatsoglou-Paliadeli, Chryssoula. 1993. “Aspects of ancient Macedonian costume.” ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'' 113: 122–147. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/632401 doi:10.2307/632401]&lt;/ref&gt;. Although many Thracian tribes began to incorporate Greek garbs to their fashion, they still largely retained their own styles of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}, page 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal''' involves the [[sexual abuse]] of female athletes—primarily minors—over the past two decades, in which over 368 individuals have been sexually assaulted "by gym owners, coaches, and staff working for gymnastics programs across the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gvqm7y/skandal-u-americkoj-gimnastici-deca-zlostavljana-20-godina|title=New Report Reveals 20-Year Sex Abuse Scandal Across US Gymnastics Programs|last=Messman|first=Lauren|date=15 December 2016|publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|language=English|accessdate=17 February 2018|quote=At least 368 child gymnasts have alleged sexual assault by gym owners, coaches, and staff working for top gymnastics programs across the country over the last 20 years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2016/12/15/20-year-toll-368-gymnasts-allege-sexual-exploitation/95198724/|title=A 20-year toll: 368 gymnasts allege sexual exploitation|year=2016|publisher=[[The Indianapolis Star]]|language=English|accessdate=17 February 2018|author=Tim Evans, Mark Alesia and Marisa Kwiatkowski|quote=At least 368 gymnasts have alleged some form of sexual abuse at the hands of their coaches, gym owners and other adults working in gymnastics.

On February 5, 2018, Nassar received another 40 to 125 years.

An investigation over the period of nine months found that "predatory coaches were allowed to move from gym to gym, undetected by a lax system of oversight, or dangerously passed on by USA Gymnastics-certified gyms".&lt;ref name="TIS2016"/&gt; USAG and [[Michigan State University]]—where Nassar was a faculty member—have been accused of enabling Nassar's abuse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/national-international/Larry-Nassar-Fallout-Michigan-State-US-Olympic-Committee-USA-Gymnastics-470969223.html|title=Michigan State President Resigns; US Olympic Committee Face Fallout of Larry Nassar Sentencing|work=NBC Chicago|date=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-nassar-accountability-20180124-story.html|title=Michigan State University president resigns amid widening calls for accountability over Larry Nassar abuse scandal|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 24, 2018|first=Matt|last=Pearce}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/15/us/larry-nassar-gymnastics-me-too-sentence/index.html|title=Larry Nassar's sexual abuse victims finally get their days in court|work=CNN|date=January 15, 2018|first=Eric|last=Levenson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are named as defendants in civil lawsuits that former gymnasts have filed against Nassar.&lt;ref name=chicagotri&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/international/ct-usa-gymnastics-fbi-doctor-abuse-20170216-story.html|title=USA Gymnastics alerted FBI in 2015 to doctor accused of abuse|work=Chicago Tribune|date=February 16, 2017|first1=Rick|last1=Maese|first2=Will|last2=Hobson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytsteve/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/sports/olympics/sexual-abuse-charges-put-shadow-on-us-gymnastics-federation.html|title=Sexual Abuse Charges Put Shadow on U.S. Gymnastics Federation|work=The New York Times|date=September 13, 2016|first=Juliet|last=Macur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1990, USAG started a list of permanently banned coaches, including for sex abuse. In 1992, Robert Dean Head, a USAG coach in Kentucky, pled guilty to raping a 12-year old. In 2007, USAG made background checks mandatory for all coaches. [[Don Peters]], the national coach for the [[Gymnastics at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympic team]], was banned from USAG in 2011, after two former gymnasts accused him of sexual abuse. In 2016, Olympic team doctor Larry Nassar was arrested on charges of sex abuse and possession of child pornography. Multiple victims of sexual abuse have filed lawsuits against USAG and other parties.&lt;ref name=legacy&gt;{{Cite news| title = A Legacy of Inaction| work = The Washington Post| accessdate = 2018-02-04| date = 2017-02-15| url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-40467147.html|via=High Beam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several incidents where USA Gymnastics has dismissed warnings about coaches. In a 2013 lawsuit USA Gymnastics officials admitted under oath that allegations of sexual abuse were routinely dismissed as hearsay, unless they came directly from a victim or victim's parent. USA Gymnastics waited for four years before reporting Marvin Sharp to police. He was charged and committed suicide in prison. Mark Schiefelbein was charged in 2002 for molesting a 10-year-old girl. After prosecutors [[subpoena]]ed records, they learned that USA gymnastics had received prior complaints against Schiefelbein, who is serving a 36-year sentence. There had been a complaint about James Bell on file for at least five years before he was arrested in 2003 for molesting three young gymnasts. Bell pleaded guilty and is serving eight years in prison.&lt;ref name=dayton /&gt;

At least four complaints were made against [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] coach William McCabe, but USAG did not report the allegations to police. One gym owner had warned that McCabe "should be locked in a cage before someone is raped". McCabe continued coaching for seven years, until one gymnast's mother went to the FBI with emails that had been sent to her 11-year-old daughter. McCabe was charged with molesting gymnasts, secretly videotaping girls changing clothes and posting their naked pictures on the Internet. He pleaded guilty and is serving a 30-year sentence.&lt;ref name=dayton&gt;{{Cite news| last1 = Kwiatkowski| first1 = Marisa Mark Alesia| last2 = Alesia| first2 = Mark| last3 = Star| first3 = Evans| title = A BLIND EYE TO SEX ABUSE ; How USA Gymnastics Protected Coaches over Kids by Failing to Report Allegations of Misconduct| work = Dayton Daily News (Dayton, OH)| accessdate = 2018-02-04| date = 2016-08-04| url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-39900495.html |via=High Beam}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
A judge released over 5,600 pages of court records in the McCabe case after the ''Indianapolis Star'' requested the documents, which detail how USA Gymnastics has responded to various sexual misconduct allegations that were made against coaches over a 10-year period from 1996 to 2006. The released documents included a letter which says a USAG regional chairman spoke to the organization's president in support of allowing a convicted sex offender to keep his membership. Other documents include sexual abuse complaints that were filed against 54 coaches. The documents revealed that some of coaches were not banned from the sport despite being convicted of the crimes. USAG has since said that it has banned 37 of the 54 coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last1 = Kwiatkowski| first1 = Marisa| last2 = Evans| first2 = Tim| last3 = Alesia| first3 = Mark| last4 = Star| first4 = The Indianapolis| title = Judge Releases USA Gymnastics Sex Abuse Files| work = Dayton Daily News (Dayton, OH)| accessdate = 2018-02-04| date = 2017-03-05| url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-40514599.html|via=High Beam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a deposition, then USAG President [[Steve Penny]] said "To the best of my knowledge, there's no duty to report if you are – if you are a third-party to some allegation ... You know, that lies with the person who has first-hand knowledge."&lt;ref name=dayton /&gt; Penny resigned in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = A list of all the USA Gymnastics board members who have resigned| work = Indianapolis Star| accessdate = 2018-02-04| url = https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2018/02/02/heres-list-all-usa-gymnastics-board-members-who-have-resigned/300714002/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual abuse allegations==
In September 2016, ''[[The Indianapolis Star]]'' revealed that [[Rachael Denhollander]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indystar.com/videos/news/2016/09/12/90274492/|title=Gymnast accuses former USAG doctor of abuse|website=Indianapolis Star|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of two former gymnasts who had made accusations of sexual abuse against Nassar.

The molestations ranged from inserting a finger in the gymnasts' vaginas and anuses to fondling their breasts and genitalia. These were criminal acts irrespective of consent, because the victims were minors. Nassar initially denied the charges, claiming that he was performing legitimate medical procedures.&lt;ref name=chicagotri/&gt; In February 2017, three former gymnasts, [[Jeanette Antolin]], Jessica Howard and [[Jamie Dantzscher]], gave an interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]'' in which they accused Nassar of sexually abusing them. The gymnasts also alleged that the "emotionally abusive environment" at the national team training camps run by [[Béla Károlyi|Béla]] and [[Márta Károlyi]] at the [[Karolyi Ranch]] near [[Huntsville, Texas]], gave Nassar an opportunity to take advantage of the gymnasts and made them afraid to speak up about the abuse.&lt;ref name=60mins&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/on-60-minutes-former-gymnasts-allege-sexual-abuse/|title=On 60 Minutes, former gymnasts allege sexual abuse|work=CBS News|date=February 19, 2017|first=Brit|last=McCandless}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rachael Denhollander, one of the first women to publicly accuse Nassar,&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt; said in court in May 2017 that Nassar sexually abused her on five doctor's visits in 2000, when she was 15 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/13/us/michigan-gymnastics-doctor-sexual-abuse-allegations/index.html|title=Doctor's accuser: 'I froze, because I knew it was sexual abuse'|author1=Steve Almasy|author2=Anne Woolsey|work=CNN|date=May 14, 2017|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response and impact==
===USA Gymnastics===
With regard to the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal in its entirety, USAG stated that "Nothing is more important to USA Gymnastics, the Board of Directors and CEO Steve Penny than protecting athletes, which requires sustained vigilance by everyone — coaches, athletes, parents, administrators and officials. We are saddened when any athlete has been harmed in the course of his or her gymnastics career."&lt;ref name="TIS2016"/&gt; The USAG also said that it required criminal background checks for all of its coaches.&lt;ref name="TIS2016"/&gt; An independent investigation by ''[[The Indianapolis Star]]'', however, found that "some coaches are fired at gym after gym without being tracked or flagged by USA Gymnastics, or losing their membership with the organization".&lt;ref name="TIS2016"/&gt;

Specifically with respect to Nassar, USA Gymnastics (USAG) said that its executives first learned of an athlete's concern regarding him in June 2015. Following an investigation, Nassar was fired and reported to the [[FBI]] in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2017/02/16/a03f968c-f489-11e6-a9b0-ecee7ce475fc_story.html|title=USA Gymnastics says it alerted FBI to doctor accused of sex abuse in 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=February 16, 2017|first1=Rick|last1=Maese|first2=Will|last2=Hobson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2017, USAG president [[Steve Penny]] resigned amid accusations of negligence&lt;ref name=nytsteve&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/sports/steve-penny-resigns-as-usa-gymnastics-president.html|title=Steve Penny Resigns as U.S.A.

On November 5, 2018, the USOC announced that it was starting the process to decertify USAG as the national governing body for gymnastics in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/05/us/usa-gymnastics-us-olympic-committee/index.html|title=US Olympic Committee moves to revoke USA Gymnastics' status|publisher=[[CNN]]|language=en-US|date=November 6, 2018|access-date=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michigan State University===
Michigan State University said that it first received a complaint against Nassar in 2014. A Title IX investigation into the complaint found no violation of policy and Nassar was allowed to continue treating patients under certain agreed upon restrictions as stipulated by MSU College of Osteopathic Medicine Dean William Strampel. However no monitoring was instituted.&lt;ref name="lsj"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wolcott|first1=RJ|title=MSU president apologizes to Nassar victims; university creates $10 million counseling fund|url=https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2017/12/15/msu-board-trustees-sexual-assault-simon-nassar-students/954984001/|accessdate=February 8, 2018|work=Lansing State Journal|date=December 15, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After allegations against Nassar were made public by ''[[The Indianapolis Star]]'' in September 2016, Nassar was fired by Michigan State for violating the 2014 agreement.&lt;ref name=NbcFBI/&gt;

The university faces lawsuits from 144 local and MSU athletes who say they were sexually assaulted by Larry Nassar.&lt;ref name=klages&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/nolan-finley/2017/12/02/cost-msu-gymnast-scandal/108247652/|title=Finley: MSU cost in gymnast abuse scandal could top $1B|work=The Detroit News|date=December 2, 2017|first=Nolan|last=Finley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Michigan State University gymnastics coach Kathie Klages was suspended on February 13, 2017, and retired the next day, amidst the sexual abuse investigation of Nassar.&lt;ref name=klages2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statenews.com/article/2017/08/klages-twistars|title=Former MSU gymnastics coach Klages working at gymnastics club|work=The State News|date=August 27, 2017|first=Madison|last=O'Connor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klages has been accused of dismissing sexual abuse complaints by former gymnasts against Nassar and pressuring them to stay silent.&lt;ref name=klages/&gt; According to court documents, Klages was reportedly aware of sexual abuse allegations against Nassar as early as 1997.&lt;ref name=klages2/&gt;

On December 12, 2017, Strampel resigned as dean and went on medical leave as faculty. Mediation ended in the civil lawsuits. Thus the MSU Board of Trustees voted to establish a $10 million fund to reimburse victims of Nassar for counseling services. MSU President Lou Anna Simon also apologized to the Nassar victims and donated her just approved raise to the Roy J. and Lou Anna K. Simon Scholarship fund while declining it in the future. Kaylee Lorincz, Nassar's Ingham County criminal case "Victim E", addressed the board wanting the university to change not for them to focus on litigation. Lorincz did not think the apology was "heartfelt".&lt;ref name="lsj"/&gt;

During Nassar's sentencing in January 2018, 8 former MSU athletes, including those from the gymnastics, softball, volleyball, rowing, and track and field programs, gave [[victim impact statement]]s accusing MSU staff of dismissing their sexual abuse complaints against Nassar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/sports/college/msu/2018/01/25/ncaa-investigation-michigan-state-larry-nassar/1064105001/|title=Who'll be key figures at center of NCAA investigation at Michigan State?|date=January 25, 2018|work=Lansing State Journal|first=Chris|last=Solari}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/23/us/nassar-sexual-abuse-who-knew/index.html|title=What others knew: Culture of denial protected Nassar for years|work=CNN|date=January 25, 2018|first=Nicole|last=Chavez}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 23, 2018, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] formally opened an investigation into the university's handling of sexual abuse allegations against Nassar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/sports/michigan-state-ncaa-investigation.html|title=N.C.A.A.

Simon resigned later that same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/24/michigan-house-resolution-simon-resign/109777330/|title=MSU President Lou Anna Simon resigns|work=The Detroit News|date=January 24, 2018|first=Jonathan|last=Oosting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20180125/news01/651021/msu-president-lou-anna-simon-resigns-in-wake-of-nassar-case|title=MSU President Lou Anna Simon resigns in wake of Nassar case|work=Crain's Detroit Business|date=January 24, 2018|first=Michael|last=Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, MSU athletic director [[Mark Hollis (athletic director)|Mark Hollis]] retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/sports/michigan-state-mark-hollis.html|title=Michigan State Athletic Director Mark Hollis Resigns|work=The New York Times|date=January 26, 2018|first=Marc|last=Tracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, 2018, [[ESPN]]'s ''[[Outside the Lines]]'' reported that their investigation "found a pattern of widespread denial, inaction and information suppression of such allegations by officials ranging from campus police to the Spartan athletic department" that went "well beyond" the Nassar case. According to the investigation, at least 16 [[Michigan State Spartans football|football]] players have been accused of sexual assault or violence against women since 2007, the team's first season under current head coach [[Mark Dantonio]]. The investigation also included two previously publicized allegations of similar conduct by members of the [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|men's basketball program,]] as well as one never-before-publicized allegation made by former Michigan State counselor Lauren Allswede against Travis Walton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/22214566/pattern-denial-inaction-information-suppression-michigan-state-goes-larry-nassar-case-espn |title=OTL: Michigan State secrets extend far beyond Larry Nassar case |first1=Paula |last1=Lavigne |first2=Nicole |last2=Noren |website=ESPN.com |date=January 27, 2018 |accessdate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ESPN has been criticized for their reporting in linking these allegations to the Larry Nassar scandal by some members of the local and national media, especially for showing a graphic of Coach Dantonio, Coach Izzo, and Larry Nassar together with a title of "Crisis at Michigan State" in the Outside the Lines report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theathletic.com/257847/2018/03/01/entering-tournament-msus-tom-izzo-wants-just-basketball-as-focus-for-team/|title=Entering tournament, Tom Izzo wants 'just basketball' as...|first=Katie|last=Strang|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-football/news/michigan-state-interim-president-blasts-espn-dragging-mark-dantonio-tom-izzo-larry-nassar-scandal/kri4rtlsqsxk1cn8sux8kbbzv|title=Michigan State interim president blasts ESPN for dragging Mark Dantonio, Tom Izzo|date=February 13, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/sports/columnists/graham-couch/2018/02/01/tom-izzo-espn-michigan-state-couch-column/1084253001/|title=Couch: Tom Izzo has chosen a standoff with ESPN – one he might win|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Dantonio denied all allegations on mishandling sexual assault&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/watch-michigan-states-mark-dantonio-disputes-report-of-mishandled-sexual-assault-allegations/|title=WATCH: Michigan State's Mark Dantonio disputes report of mishandled sexual-assault allegations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tom Izzo]] insisted that he would cooperate with any investigation as he had in the past stating "we'll cooperate with any investigation and always have".&lt;ref name="si.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2018/01/28/tom-izzo-michigan-state-sexual-assault-investigation-questioning|title=Tom Izzo: "I cooperated with every investigation"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017 with sexual assault charges facing 4 former Michigan State football players, Mark Dantonio was cleared by the independent report conducted by the Jones Day firm, however it was determined that football administrative staff member Curtis Blackwell had violated policy &lt;ref name="si.com"/&gt; and was let go.  The report also determined that Coach Dantonio had actually been the one to report the alleged sexual assault involving three players when he had been informed of the assault by another player.&lt;ref name="lansingstatejournal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/sports/college/msu/football/2017/06/05/kn/371675001/|title=Investigation clears MSU's Dantonio; Blackwell violated policy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report found that Dantonio properly followed the mandatory reporting guidelines making several calls and texts to report the incident between 2:01 and 2:12 pm on January 16, 2017, including calls to MSU's director of the Office of Institutional Equity.&lt;ref name="lansingstatejournal.com"/&gt;  On June 6, 2018, three of the four football players charged where sentenced to 36 months probation and ordered to undergo sexual offender therapy after agreeing to a plea to charges of [[seduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2018/06/06/former-michigan-state-football-players-sentenced-probation/676220002/|title=3 former Michigan State football players sentenced to probation in sexual assault case|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other investigations by state and federal agencies into Michigan State's involvement are ongoing, including the Michigan Attorney General's office &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2018/01/6_questions_schuette_didnt_ans.html|title=7 questions AG Bill Schuette needs to answer about his Michigan State investigation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States Education Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/26/education-department-michigan-state-probe-425355|title=DeVos announces new Title IX probe at Michigan State|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the Michigan Attorney General's investigation, in March 2018 William Strampel, who oversaw Nassar's clinic while dean of the [[Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine|College of Osteopathic Medicine]], was arrested and charged with felony misconduct in office and criminal sexual conduct for allegedly groping a student and storing nude photos on his computer.

===United States Congress===
The [[United States Congress]] responded to the sexual abuse claims that were made against Nassar and also responded to claims made against personnel who were involved with [[USA Swimming]] and [[USA Taekwondo]]. [[United States Senator]] [[Dianne Feinstein]] introduced a bill that would require [[United States Olympic Committee#National Governing Body Members|national governing body]] members overseeing Olympic sports to immediately report sexual assault allegations to law enforcement or designated child-welfare agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=DFAC8B0E-AB09-4176-8D74-B9D803CFAB2B|title=Senators Introduce Bill Requiring U.S. Amateur Athletic Organizations, Members to Report Sexual Abuse|website=feinstein.senate.gov|date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former gymnasts [[Dominique Moceanu]], [[Jamie Dantzscher]] and Jessica Howard testified at a [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] hearing on March 28, 2017, concerning the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/former-usa-gymnasts-address-senators-at-hearing-on-young-athletes-and-abuse/|title=Olympic stars testify to Congress about sex abuse at USA Gymnastics program|work=CBS News|date=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimessenate&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/sports/facing-congress-some-sports-officials-not-all-begin-to-confront-sex-abuse.html|title=Facing Congress, Some Sports Officials (Not All) Begin to Confront Sexual Abuse|first=Juliet|last=Macur|date=March 29, 2017|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick Adams, chief of Paralympic sports for the [[United States Olympic Committee]] and head of organizational development for the NGBs, stated at the hearing: "We do take responsibility, and we apologize to any young athlete who has ever faced abuse."

It further authorizes the United States Center for Safe Sport to ensure that aspiring U.S. Olympic athletes can report allegations of abuse to an independent and non-conflicted entity for investigation and resolution, and to make sure that all national governing bodies follow the strictest standards for child abuse prevention and detection.

{{refimprove|date=August 2009}}

The '''Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act''' (1985, revised 1989), was recommended as a [[Uniform Act]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sabatino|first=Charles|date=Fall 2003|title=De-Balkanizing State Advance Directive Law|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/aging/publications/bifocal/251.authcheckdam.pdf|journal=Bifocal American Bar Association Commission on Law and Aging Bar Associations in Focus on Aging and the Law|volume=Vol. 25, No. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act  subsequently was passed by many states.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} The Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act was replaced as a recommended Uniform act by the Uniform Health-Care Decision-making Act in 1993.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The law allows a person to declare a [[living will]] specifying that, if the situation arises, he or she does not wish to be kept alive through [[life support]] if [[terminally ill]] or in a [[coma]]. The patient may also obtain a health care [[power of attorney]]. This power of attorney appoints an agent to make medical decision for the patient in case the patient becomes incompetent.

Many people make use of this act because they do not wish to endure any pain or suffering if weakened by a fatal disease.  They want to "die with dignity," so that family members will not have to go through emotional pain of watching their loved one sleep through many years of life with no response to any stimuli.

This form of death is known as passive [[euthanasia]], where death is not inflicted with drugs, but is allowed by cutting off life support.

As of 2013, there were over 4,000 Uruguayans living in Swedish territory.&lt;ref name="Uruguaydelnorte"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/domingo/suecia-uruguay-norte.html |title=Suecia: Uruguay del norte |date=8 September 2013 |publisher=[[El País (Uruguay)|EL PAIS]]}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Being Sweden a very democratic country and a net receiver of immigrants, during the [[civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay]] (1973–1985) there were several Uruguayans that went exiled to Sweden; this was possible, among others, much because of Ambassador [[Harald Edelstam]].&lt;ref name="Uruguaydelnorte"/&gt;  Nowadays there are many Uruguayans who still live in Sweden.&lt;ref name="Uruguaydelnorte"/&gt; 

Uruguayan residents in Sweden have their own institutions, for instance, [[Casa Uruguay]] in [[Malmö]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casauruguaymalmo.se/ Casa Uruguay Malmö] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104034953/http://www.casauruguaymalmo.se/ |date=2013-11-04 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Consultative Councils in [[Stockholm]] and [[Gothenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.d20.org.uy/Lista-de-Consejos |title=List of Consultative Councils of Uruguayans abroad |accessdate=1 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809011138/http://www.d20.org.uy/Lista-de-Consejos |archive-date=9 August 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
