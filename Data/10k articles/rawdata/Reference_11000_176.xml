}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to reinstate a new Boer-administered republic reminiscent of the era when Boers administered independent republics during the 19th century following the [[Great Trek]].

South African law-enforcement officials charge the Boeremag for being responsible for the [[2002 Soweto bombings]] and arrested twenty-six men, alleged to be members of the Boeremag, in November and December 2002, reportedly seizing over 1,000 kilograms of [[explosive]]s in the process. Further arrests followed in March 2003.

It has since been alleged{{by whom?|date=September 2016}} that the Boeremag case was orchestrated by the Crime Intelligence Department of the South African ANC government as exposed by ex-crime intelligence captain Deon Loots in his [[affidavit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listofagenciesontacted.blogspot.com/2013/02/sworn-affidavit-from-deon-loots.html|title=Blogger|author=|date=|website=listofagenciesontacted.blogspot.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://censorbugbear-reports.blogspot.com/2013/02/ex-intelligence-cop-deon-loots-defends.html|title=Ex-intelligence cop Deon Loots defends Boeremag|author=|date=|website=censorbugbear-reports.blogspot.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/SwornAffidavitByDeonLoots|title=Sworn Affidavit By Deon Loots|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the High Court which was published in various media articles.

It has also been revealed that the South African government provides an annual [[slush fund]] of R600,000,000 for its crime intelligence department to source any anti-government movement, which does not require accounting for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The first trial of Boeremag suspects began under tight security in [[Pretoria]] during May 2003. Twenty-two men were charged with forty-two counts of [[treason]], [[murder]], and illegal weapons possession. Six pleaded not guilty, two have not entered pleas, one refuses to plead, and thirteen are challenging the court's jurisdiction, alleging that the post-apartheid constitution and government of South Africa are illegitimate.

During the trial plans to blow up South African actor [[Casper de Vries]] together with eight other individuals were revealed. The group is quoted as saying that the reason for this plan was because De Vries "was not on the right path".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_1570696,00.html News24: Boeremag planned 'new nation']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317164348/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0%2C%2C2-7-1442_1570696%2C00.html |date=March 17, 2008  }} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004 the Pretoria High Court heard testimony from a witness, Deon Crous, who stated under oath that he had assisted two of the accused, Kobus Pretorius and Jacques Jordaan, to manufacture 1500&amp;nbsp;kg of explosives. Crous testified that five amounts of 300&amp;nbsp;kg were reserved for five separate bombs. One of the planned bomb attacks was cancelled as there was too high a risk of white civilians being injured. The bombs were to be detonated on December 13, 2002, with various attacks planned to follow the bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_1613034,00.html|title= Boeremag: 'We made explosives'|date= 2004-10-29|accessdate= 2008-01-30|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080929045005/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0%2C%2C2-7-1442_1613034%2C00.html|archivedate= 2008-09-29|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early May 2006 Herman van Rooyen and Rudi Gouws, two of the leading members being tried, were reported to have escaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=270761|title= Prisons minister blames police for escape fiasco|date= 2006-05-04|accessdate= 2006-05-26|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120717050210/http://mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=270761|archivedate= 2012-07-17|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men were recaptured on 20 January 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sabcnews.com/south_africa/crime1justice/0,2172,142223,00.html |title=Boeremag escapees in court under tight security |date=2007-01-20 |accessdate=2007-01-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124426/http://www.sabcnews.com/south_africa/crime1justice/0%2C2172%2C142223%2C00.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were set to appear in court to face charges of escape and the illegal possession of firearms.

In late October 2013, [[Mike du Toit]], the ringleader of a plot to assassinate [[Nelson Mandela]] and expel Black people out of South Africa, was convicted of treason and sentenced to 35 years in prison. Twenty other members of Boeremag were also sentenced to prison terms of between five and 35 years. They included Herman van Rooyen and Rudi Gouws, two of the co-conspirators of Du Toit who were given longer sentences for their role in planting bombs in their attempt to assassinate Nelson Mandela.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

These men have been imprisoned since 2002. The trial lasted 11 years.

The ''''' Chronica latina regum Castellae''''', known in Spanish as the  '''''Crónica latina de los reyes de Castilla''''', both meaning "Latin Chronicle of the Kings of Castile", is a [[medieval Latin]] history of the [[List of Castilian monarchs|rulers of Castile]] from the death of Count [[Fernán González]] in 970 to the [[Reconquista|reconquest]] of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] by King [[Ferdinand III of Castile|Ferdinand III]] in 1236–39. It was probably composed by [[Juan de Soria]], the [[Bishop of Osma]] and [[chancellor]] of Ferdinand III, between 1217 and 1239.&lt;ref&gt;Derek W. Lomax, "The Authorship of the ''Chronique latine des rois de Castille''", ''Bulletin of Hispanic Studies'', XL (1963), 205–11.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the text deals with the reigns of [[Alfonso VIII]] (1158–1214) and Ferdinand III (1217–1252). It was designed with two purposes: for use at the royal court as a ''[[speculum principis]]'' and to defend the interests of Castile against those of the [[Kingdom of León]]. 

The ''Chronica'' originally ended in 1230 with the death of [[Alfonso IX of León]], who was succeeded by Ferdinand III. Modern historians disagree whether the continuation down to the capture of Córdoba six years later was written by Juan de Soria or by another author.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Charlo Brea, "¿Un segundo autor para la última parte de la ''Crónica latina de los Reyes de Castilla''?", ''Actas I Congreso Nacional de Latín Medieval'' (León: University of León, 1995), 251–56, argues for a second author. Francisco J. Hernández, "La corte de Fernando III y la casa real de Francia: Documentación, crónicas y monumentos", ''Actas del VIII Congreso de Estudios Medievales: Fernando III y su tiempo'' (Ávila: Fundación Sánchez Albornoz, 2003), argues for the single authorship of the bishop.&lt;/ref&gt; One has even suggested a composition in three stages between 1223 and 1237 by the same author, Juan de Soria.&lt;ref&gt;Inés Fernández-Ordóñez, [http://e-spania.revues.org/document283.html "La composición por etapas de la ''Chronica latina regum Castellae'' (1223–1237) de Juan de Soria"], ''E-Spania: Revue électronique d'études hispaniques médiévales'', 2 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The sources of the ''Chronica'' were the documents of the royal archives, to which its author had access, although he also records events from memory. He makes little use of other narrative histories, which were the main sources of the contemporary chronicles called ''[[Chronicon mundi]]'' and ''[[De rebus Hispaniae]]''. Juan also includes contemporaneous events from the [[Maghrib]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], and the [[Kingdom of France]] in order to place Castilian history in context, something neither the ''Chronicon'' nor the ''De rebus'' do, although the later histories composed at the request of [[Alfonso X]], the ''[[Grande e general estoria]]'' and the ''[[Estoria de España]]'' do. 

The ''Chronica'' is preserved in only one late fifteenth-century manuscript, [[Manuscript|MS]] G-1 or 9/450, in the library of the [[Real Academia de la Historia]] in Madrid. It is a copy of the original and is found on folios 89 through 122. The structure found in most printed editions, of four sections subdivided into chapters, was added by its first editor, Georges Cirot.

The '''Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information (CGI)''', usually referred to by the unofficial "'''Commission for Geoscience Information'''" is a daughter or major [[subcommittee]] grade scientific daughter organization that concerns itself with [[geology|geological]] [[Technical standard|standard]], [[information management]] and [[interoperability]] matters on a global scale.

==About==
The Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information (CGI) is a [[working committee|working subcommittee]] of the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]]. The Commission meets usually annually, and at the quadrennial meetings scheduled by the IUGS at the International Geological Congress.

The Commission is the governing body responsible for the XML-based exchange languages Geoscience Markup Language ([[GeoSciML]] - in collaboration with the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]]) and EarthResource Markup Language ([[EarthResourceML]]). The CGI and its members also play a significant role in the [[OneGeology]] initiative.

==Aims==
The Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information (CGI) mission is to enable the global exchange of knowledge about geoscience information and systems.

Specifically CGI aims to:

* Provide the means for transferring knowledge on geoscience information and systems
* Stimulate international dissemination of best practice in geoscience information
* Stimulate and support initiatives which are developing standards
* Establish and occupy an accepted position in the international geoscience information community and represent IUGS on geoscience information matters.

==Methodology==
The Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information has created two working groups, the '''Interoperability Working Group''' and the '''Geoscience Terminology Working Group'''.

The '''Interoperability Working Group''' aims to develop and test relevant and timely geological information standards. The ultimate objective of the working group is to enable seamless web integration of select information hosted at different locations in varied formats. It aims to achieve this by:
* develop a conceptual model of geoscientific information based on existing information models
* implement a subset of this model, the Geoscience Mark-up Language, referred to as [[GeoSciML]] as an extension of [[Geography Markup Language]] 
* implement an interchange format for geoscience information related to mines and mineral resources (EarthResourceML)
* identify areas that require standardised vocabularies in order to enable data exchange and develop vocabularies for populating GeoSciML instance documents.

The '''Multi-lingual Thesaurus Working Group''' was formed in 2003 to continue work of the Multhes working group of the 1990s. The goal was to enable the global exchange of geoscience information by establishing a common multilingual core vocabulary by developing and expanding the Multilingual Thesaurus of Geosciences.  In 2012, vocabulary development activities of the Interoperability Working Group (the Concept Definition Task Group) were merged with the activities of the Multi-lingual Thesaurus Working Group to form a new '''Geoscience Terminology Working Group''' that will organize and coordinate ongoing development of geoscience terminology for use in information exchange.

'''Daniel Ellsberg''' (born April 7, 1931) is an American activist and former [[United States military]] analyst who, while employed by the [[RAND Corporation]], precipitated a national political controversy in 1971 when he released the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]'', a top-secret [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] study of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] decision-making in relation to the [[Vietnam War]], to ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other newspapers.

On January 3, 1973, Ellsberg was charged under the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] along with other charges of theft and conspiracy, carrying a total maximum sentence of 115 years. Due to governmental misconduct and illegal evidence-gathering, and the defense by [[Leonard Boudin]] and Harvard Law School professor [[Charles Nesson]], [[William Matthew Byrne, Jr.|Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr.]] dismissed all charges against Ellsberg on May 11, 1973.

Ellsberg was awarded the [[Right Livelihood Award]] in 2006. He is also known for having formulated an important example in [[decision theory]], the [[Ellsberg paradox]], and for having voiced support for [[WikiLeaks]], [[Chelsea Manning]], and [[Edward Snowden]].

==Early life and career==
Ellsberg was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]] on April 7, 1931, the son of Harry and Adele (Charsky) Ellsberg. His parents were [[Ashkenazi Jews]] who had converted to [[Christian Science]], and he was raised as a Christian Scientist. He grew up in [[Detroit]] and attended the [[Cranbrook Kingswood School|Cranbrook School]] in nearby [[Bloomfield Hills]]. His mother wanted him to be a [[concert pianist]], but he stopped playing in July 1946, after both his mother and sister were killed when his father fell asleep at the wheel and crashed the family car into a [[culvert]] wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ml_ZepYWGdkC&amp;pg=PA36|title=Wild Man: The Life and Times of Daniel Ellsberg|first=Tom|last=Wells|date=June 9, 2001|pages=36, 39, 70–95, 267|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellsberg entered [[Harvard College]] on a scholarship, graduating ''[[summa cum laude]]'' with an [[A.B.]] in [[economics]] in 1952. He studied at the [[University of Cambridge]] for a year on a [[Woodrow Wilson]] [[Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation|Fellowship]], then returned to Harvard for graduate school. In 1954, he enlisted in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] and earned a commission.&lt;ref name=bookragsbio/&gt; He served as a platoon leader and company commander in the 2nd Marine Division, and was discharged in 1957 as a [[first lieutenant]].&lt;ref name=bookragsbio/&gt; Ellsberg returned to Harvard as a Junior Fellow in the [[Harvard Society of Fellows|Society of Fellows]] for two years.&lt;ref name=bookragsbio/&gt;

==RAND Corporation and PhD==
Ellsberg began working as a strategic analyst at the [[RAND Corporation]] for the summer of 1958 and then permanently in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode
 | title = Daniel Ellsberg Explains Why He Leaked The Pentagon Papers

Ellsberg completed a [[Ph.D.]] in economics from Harvard in 1962.&lt;ref name=bookragsbio&gt;Daniel Ellsberg Biography @ Encyclopedia of World Biography, via [http://www.bookrags.com/biography/daniel-ellsberg BookRags.com]&lt;/ref&gt; His dissertation on [[decision theory]] was based on a set of thought experiments that showed that decisions under conditions of [[uncertainty]] or [[ambiguity]] generally may not be consistent with well defined subjective probabilities. Now known as the [[Ellsberg paradox]],&lt;ref name=Ellsberg1961&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ellsberg|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Ellsberg|journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]|volume=75|title=Risk, Ambiguity, and the Savage Axioms|year=1961|pages=643–669 |doi=10.2307/1884324|issue=4 |jstor=1884324 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this formed the basis of a large literature that has developed since the 1980s, including approaches such as [[Choquet expected utility]] and [[info-gap decision theory]].

Ellsberg worked in the Pentagon from August 1964&lt;ref name=BBC4&gt;[[BBC Four]] ''[[Storyville (television series)|Storyville]] – 2009–2010 – 14. The Most Dangerous Man in America''&lt;/ref&gt; under [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] as special assistant to Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs [[John McNaughton (government official)|John McNaughton]]. He then went to [[South Vietnam]] for two years, working for General [[Edward Lansdale]] as a member of the [[United States Department of State|State Department]].

On his return from South Vietnam, Ellsberg resumed working at RAND. In 1967, he contributed to a top-secret study of [[Classified information|classified]] documents on the conduct of the Vietnam War that had been commissioned by Defense Secretary McNamara.&lt;ref name=upi1971yearinreview&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pentagon Papers|work=1971 Year in Review|publisher=UPI|year=1971|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/The-Pentagon-Papers/12295509436546-7|accessdate=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These documents, completed in 1968, later became known collectively as the Pentagon Papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/movie/FIjiysnlYYSwnm/REqtSvvuifNltz |title=The Most Dangerous Man in America: Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers (2010) |publisher=Movieweb.com |accessdate=December 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through study of this body of US government records, Ellsberg came to understand about the Vietnam War that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was no more a "[[civil war]]" after 1955 or 1960 than it had been during the U.S.-supported French attempt at colonial reconquest. A war in which one side was ''entirely'' equipped and paid by a foreign power – which dictated the nature of the local regime in its own interest – was not a civil war. To say that we had "interfered" in what is "really a civil war," as most American academic writers and even liberal critics of the war do to this day, simply screened a more painful reality and was as much a myth as the earlier official one of "aggression from the North." In terms of the [[UN Charter]] and of our own avowed ideals, it was a war of foreign aggression, American aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Oliver and Kuznick, Peter, "The Untold History of the United States" (New York: Gallery Books, 2012) p. 384 ''citing'' Daniel Ellberg, "Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers" (New York: Viking, 2002), pp. 258–260&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Disaffection with Vietnam War==
By 1969 Ellsberg began attending [[anti-war]] events while still remaining in his position at RAND. He experienced an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] attending a [[War Resisters League]] conference at [[Haverford College]] in August 1969, listening to a speech given by a [[draft resister]] named [[Randy Kehler]], who said he was "very excited" that he would soon be able to join his friends in prison.&lt;ref name="thomas2002"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Thomas|first = Marlo|authorlink = Marlo Thomas|title = The Right Words at the Right Time|publisher = Atria Books|year = 2002|location = New York|isbn = 0-7862-8889-2|display-authors = etal}} pp.100–03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hyp.is/M4GAugGYEei1At-CibjmnQ/janksreviews.com/post-indepth-review/|title=The Post – In-Depth Review|last=Farrow|first=Chas|date=|website=|access-date=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ellsberg described his reaction:{{quote|And he said this very calmly. I hadn't known that he was about to be sentenced for draft resistance. It hit me as a total surprise and shock, because I heard his words in the midst of actually feeling proud of my country listening to him. And then I heard he was going to prison. It wasn't what he said exactly that changed my worldview. It was the example he was setting with his life. How his words in general showed that he was a stellar American, and that he was going to jail as a very deliberate choice—because he thought it was the right thing to do. There was no question in my mind that my government was involved in an unjust war that was going to continue and get larger. Thousands of young men were dying each year. I left the auditorium and found a deserted men's room. I sat on the floor and cried for over an hour, just sobbing. The only time in my life I've reacted to something like that.}}

Decades later, reflecting on Kehler's decision, Ellsberg said:{{quote|Randy Kehler never thought his going to prison would end the war. If I hadn't met Randy Kehler it wouldn't have occurred to me to copy [the Pentagon Papers]. His actions spoke to me as no mere words would have done. He put the right question in my mind at the right time.}}

After leaving Rand, Ellsberg went to work for [[MIT]] as a senior research fellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/09/archives/daniel-ellsberg-of-mit-marries-patricia-marx.html|title=Daniel Ellsberg of M.I.T. Marries Patricia Marx|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Pentagon Papers''==
{{Main|Pentagon Papers}}
In late 1969, with the assistance of his former RAND Corporation colleague [[Anthony Russo (whistleblower)|Anthony Russo]], Ellsberg secretly made several sets of photocopies of the classified documents to which he had access; these later became known as the ''Pentagon Papers''. They revealed that, early on, the government had knowledge that the war as then resourced could most likely not be won. Further, as an editor of ''The New York Times'' was to write much later, these documents "demonstrated, among other things, that the [[Lyndon B. Johnson#Presidency 1963–1969|Johnson Administration]] had systematically lied, not only to the public but also to Congress, about a subject of transcendent national interest and significance".&lt;ref name="Apple"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Apple|first=R.W.|authorlink=R. W. Apple, Jr.|title=Pentagon Papers|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York|date=June 23, 1996|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/pentagon_papers/index.html?scp=1-spot&amp;sq=pentagon%20papers&amp;st=cse|quote=Johnson Administration had systematically lied, not only to the public but also to Congress|accessdate=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Ellsberg copied the documents, he resolved to meet some of the people who had influenced both his change of heart on the war and his decision to act. One of them was Randy Kehler. Another was the poet [[Gary Snyder]], whom he had met in Kyoto in 1960, and with whom he had argued about U.S. foreign policy; Ellsberg was finally prepared to concede that Gary Snyder had been right, about both the situation and the need for action against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Halper|first=Jon|title=Gary Snyder: dimensions of a life|publisher=Sierra Club Books|year=1991|isbn=0-87156-636-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release and publication===
Throughout 1970, Ellsberg covertly attempted to persuade a few sympathetic [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]]—among them [[J. William Fulbright]], chair of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], and [[George McGovern]], a leading opponent of the war—to release the papers on the Senate floor, because a Senator could not be prosecuted for anything he said on the record before the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford J. Ungar, The Papers &amp; The Papers, An Account of the Legal and Political Battle Over the Pentagon Papers, 1972, E.P. Dutton &amp; Co., Inc., New York; p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellsberg allowed some copies of the documents to circulate privately, including among scholars at the [[Institute for Policy Studies]] (IPS). Ellsberg also shared the documents with ''The New York Times'' correspondent [[Neil Sheehan]], who wrote a story based on what he had received both directly from Ellsberg and from contacts at IPS.&lt;ref name=wildmanreviewinreason&gt;{{Cite news|last=Young |first=Michael |title=The devil and Daniel Ellsberg: From archetype to anachronism (review of ''Wild Man: The Life and Times of Daniel Ellsberg'') |newspaper=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |page=2 |date=June 2002 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1568/is_2_34/ai_85701104 |accessdate=July 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830070005/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1568/is_2_34/ai_85701104/ |archivedate=August 30, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, June 13, 1971, the ''Times'' published the first of nine excerpts from, and commentaries on, the 7,000 page collection. For 15 days, the ''Times'' was prevented from publishing its articles by court order requested by the Nixon administration. Meanwhile, while eluding an [[FBI]] manhunt for thirteen days, Ellsberg leaked the documents to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and 17 other newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers|journal=The Nation|author=H. Bruce Franklin|date=July 9, 2001|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~hbf/ELLSBERG.htm|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 30, the [[US Supreme Court]] ordered free resumption of publication by the ''Times'' (''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]''). Two days prior to the Supreme Court's decision, Ellsberg publicly admitted his role in releasing the Pentagon Papers to the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ellsberg|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Ellsberg|title=Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers|publisher=Viking Press|location=New York|year=2002|isbn=0-670-03030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 1971, U.S. Senator [[Mike Gravel]] of Alaska entered 4,100 pages of the Papers into the record of his Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds—pages which he had received from Ellsberg via [[Ben Bagdikian]], then an editor at the ''Washington Post''.

===Fallout===
The release of these papers was politically embarrassing not only to those involved in the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon Johnson|Johnson]] administrations but also to the incumbent Nixon administration. Nixon's [[Watergate tapes|Oval Office tape]] from June 14, 1971, shows [[H. R. Haldeman]] describing the situation to Nixon:

[[File:Nixon Oval Office meeting with H.R. Haldeman, Monday, 14 June 1971, 309 p.m.wav|thumb|Nixon Oval Office meeting with H.R. Haldeman, Monday, 14 June 1971, 3:09 p.m. . (Quote begins at about 7:30 into the recording) [http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB48/oval.pdf Transcript here] ]]
:[[Donald Rumsfeld|Rumsfeld]] was making this point this morning... To the ordinary guy, all this is a bunch of gobbledygook. But out of the gobbledygook comes a very clear thing.... You can't trust the government; you can't believe what they say; and you can't rely on their judgment; and the – the implicit infallibility of presidents, which has been an accepted thing in America, is badly hurt by this, because It shows that people do things the president wants to do even though it's wrong, and the president can be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Meadows|first = Eddie|authorlink = |title = Oval office meeting with Bob Haldelman, Nixon Presidential Materials Project, Oval-519-, Cassette 747|newspaper = audio tape|location = |date = June 14, 1971|url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB48/nixon.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]], Nixon's [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], almost immediately issued a telegram to the ''Times'' ordering that it halt publication. The ''Times'' refused, and the government brought suit against it.

Although the ''Times'' eventually won the trial before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], prior to that, an [[appellate court]] ordered that the ''Times'' temporarily halt further publication. This was the first time the federal government was able to restrain the publication of a major newspaper since the presidency of [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[U.S. Civil War]]. Ellsberg released the Pentagon Papers to seventeen other newspapers in rapid succession.&lt;ref&gt;''The Most Dangerous Man in America: Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers''&lt;/ref&gt; The right of the press to publish the papers was upheld in ''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]''. The Supreme Court ruling has been called one of the "modern pillars" of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights with respect to freedom of the press.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State (June 23, 2008).

In response to the leaks, Nixon White House staffers began a campaign against further leaks and against Ellsberg personally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/12-9-2002-31884.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712153748/http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/12-9-2002-31884.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 12, 2012 |title=Portrait: Daniel Ellsberg |publisher=Buzzle.com |date=December 9, 2002 |accessdate=December 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aides [[Egil Krogh]] and [[David Young (Watergate)|David Young]], under the supervision of [[John Ehrlichman]], created the "[[White House Plumbers]]", which would later lead to the Watergate burglaries.

==Fielding break-in==
[[File:Daniel Ellsberg psychiatrist filing cabinet.jpg|thumb|Fielding's filing cabinet, with break-in marks, on display at the [[Smithsonian National Museum of American History]]]]
In August 1971, Krogh and Young met with [[G. Gordon Liddy]] and [[E. Howard Hunt]] in a basement office in the [[Old Executive Office Building]]. Hunt and Liddy recommended a "covert operation" to get a "mother lode" of information about Ellsberg's mental state in order to discredit him. Krogh and Young sent a memo to Ehrlichman seeking his approval for a "covert operation [to] be undertaken to examine all of the medical files still held by Ellsberg's psychiatrist", Lewis Fielding. Ehrlichman approved under the condition that it be "done under your assurance that it is not traceable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/30/opinion/30krogh.html|first=Egil|last=Krogh|authorlink=Egil Krogh|title=The Break-In That History Forgot|journal=The New York Times|date=June 30, 2007|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 3, 1971, the burglary of Fielding's office—titled "Hunt/Liddy Special Project No. 1" in Ehrlichman's notes—was carried out by [[White House Plumbers]] Hunt, Liddy, [[Eugenio Martínez]], Felipe de Diego and [[Bernard Barker]] (the latter three were, or had been, recruited CIA agents).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/325566/united-states-v-felipe-de-diego/ |title=United States v. Felipe de Diego, 511 F.2d 818 |website=CourtListener.com |publisher=[[Free Law Project]] |year=1975 |accessdate=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Plumbers found Ellsberg's file, but it apparently did not contain the potentially embarrassing information they sought, as they left it discarded on the floor of Fielding's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Jim Hougan|Hougan, Jim]] |title=Secret Agenda |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=1984 |isbn=0-394-51428-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt and Liddy subsequently planned to break into Fielding's home, but Ehrlichman did not approve the second burglary. The break-in was not known to Ellsberg or to the public until it came to light during Ellsberg and Russo's trial in April 1973.

==Trial and dismissal==
On June 28, 1971, two days before a Supreme Court ruling saying that a federal judge had ruled incorrectly about the right of ''The New York Times'' to publish the Pentagon Papers,&lt;ref name=upi1971yearinreview/&gt; Ellsberg publicly surrendered to the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts]] in [[Boston]]. In admitting to giving the documents to the press, Ellsberg said:
:I felt that as an American citizen, as a responsible citizen, I could no longer cooperate in concealing this information from the American public. I did this clearly at my own jeopardy and I am prepared to answer to all the consequences of this decision.&lt;ref name=upi1971yearinreview/&gt;
He and Russo faced charges under the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and other charges including theft and conspiracy, carrying a total maximum sentence of 115 years for Ellsberg, 35 years for Russo. Their trial commenced in Los Angeles on January 3, 1973, presided over by U.S. District Judge [[William Matthew Byrne Jr.]] Ellsberg tried to claim that the documents were ''illegally'' classified to keep them not from an enemy but from the American public.  However, that argument was ruled "irrelevant".  Ellsberg was silenced before he could begin.  Ellsberg said, in 2014, that his "lawyer, exasperated, said he 'had never heard of a case where a defendant was not permitted to tell the jury why he did what he did.' The judge responded: 'Well, you're hearing one now'. And so it has been with every subsequent whistleblower under indictment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ellsberg | first = Daniel

In spite of being effectively denied a defense, Ellsberg began to see events turn in his favor when the break-in of Fielding's office was revealed to Judge Byrne in a memo on April 26;  Byrne ordered it to be shared with the defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907160,00.html|journal=Time|date=May 7, 1973|title=Practicing on Ellsberg|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=byrneobit&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/14/AR2006011401165.html|title=Judge William Byrne; Ended Trial Over Pentagon Papers|journal=Washington Post|date=January 15, 2006|pages=C09|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, further evidence of illegal wiretapping against Ellsberg was revealed in court. The FBI had recorded numerous conversations between [[Morton Halperin]] and Ellsberg without a [[court order]], and furthermore the prosecution had failed to share this evidence with the defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2007/February%202007/0207pentagon.aspx "''The Pentagon Papers''"] by John T. Correll, ''Air Force Magazine'', February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, Byrne also revealed that he personally met twice with John Ehrlichman, who offered him directorship of the FBI. Byrne said he refused to consider the offer while the Ellsberg case was pending, though he was criticized for even agreeing to meet with Ehrlichman during the case.&lt;ref name=byrneobit/&gt;

Due to the gross governmental misconduct and illegal evidence gathering, and the defense by [[Leonard Boudin]] and [[Harvard Law School]] professor [[Charles Nesson]], Judge Byrne dismissed all charges against Ellsberg and Russo on May 11, 1973 after the government claimed it had lost records of wiretapping against Ellsberg. Byrne ruled: "The totality of the circumstances of this case which I have only briefly sketched offend a sense of justice. The bizarre events have incurably infected the prosecution of this case."&lt;ref name=byrneobit/&gt;

As a result of the revelations involving the Watergate scandal, [[John Ehrlichman]], [[H. R. Haldeman]], [[Richard Kleindienst]], and [[John Dean]] were forced out of office on April 30, and all would later be convicted of crimes related to [[Watergate]]. Egil Krogh later pleaded guilty to conspiracy, and White House counsel [[Charles Colson]] pleaded no contest for obstruction of justice in the burglary.

===Halperin case===
It was also revealed in 1973, during Ellsberg's trial, that the telephone calls of [[Mort Halperin]], a member of the [[U.S. National Security Council]] staff suspected of leaking information about the secret bombing of Cambodia to ''The New York Times'', were being recorded by the FBI at the request of [[Henry Kissinger]] to [[J. Edgar Hoover]].

Halperin and his family sued several federal officials, claiming the wiretap violated their [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights and Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The court agreed that Richard Nixon, John Mitchell, and H. R. Haldeman had violated the Halperins' Fourth Amendment rights and awarded them $1 in nominal damages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openjurist.org/606/f2d/1192#fn4_ref Halperin v. Kissinger] 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plumbers LSD plan===
Ellsberg later claimed that after his trial ended, Watergate prosecutor [[William H. Merrill]] informed him of an aborted plot by Liddy and the "[[White House Plumbers|Plumbers]]" to have 12 [[Cuban American]]s who had previously worked for the CIA "totally incapacitate" Ellsberg when he appeared at a public rally. It is unclear whether they were meant to assassinate Ellsberg or merely to hospitalize him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2006/4/27/exclusive_nixon_white_house_counsel_john|title=Nixon White House Counsel John Dean and Pentagon Papers Leaker Daniel Ellsberg on Watergate and the Abuse of Presidential Power from Nixon to Bush|date=April 27, 2006|journal=Democracy Now!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/guides/debate/chats/ellsberg/ |title=COLD WAR Chat: Daniel Ellsberg, Anti-war activist |date=January 10, 1999 |journal=Cold War |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219071852/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/guides/debate/chats/ellsberg/ |archivedate=December 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, Liddy describes an "Ellsberg neutralization proposal" originating from Howard Hunt, which involved drugging Ellsberg with [[LSD]], by dissolving it in his soup, at a fund-raising dinner in Washington in order to "have Ellsberg incoherent by the time he was to speak" and thus "make him appear a near burnt-out drug case" and "discredit him." The plot involved waiters from the Miami Cuban community. According to Liddy, when the plan was finally approved, "there was no longer enough lead time to get the Cuban waiters up from their Miami hotels and into place in the Washington Hotel where the dinner was to take place" and the plan was "put into abeyance pending another opportunity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Will: The Autobiography of G.

==Later activism and views==
[[File:Ellsberg.ogv|thumb|Video interview with Daniel Ellsberg at [[Roskilde Universitets Center]], Denmark, 2004-10-26. (Unedited, the first 10 seconds are black.)]]
Since the end of the Vietnam War, Ellsberg has continued his [[Activism|political activism]], giving lecture tours and speaking out about current events. Reflecting on his time in government, Ellsberg has said the following, based on his extensive access to classified material:

:The public is lied to every day by the President, by his spokespeople, by his officers. If you can't handle the thought that the President lies to the public for all kinds of reasons, you couldn't stay in the government at that level, or you're made aware of it, a week. ... The fact is Presidents rarely say the whole truth—essentially, never say the whole truth—of what they expect and what they're doing and what they believe and why they're doing it and rarely refrain from lying, actually, about these matters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0y2wmpxM2VQ "Presidential Decisions and Public Dissent"], ''Conversations with History'', July 29, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-war activism===
In an interview with ''[[Democracy Now]]'' on May 18, 2018, Ellsberg has been critical of U.S. intervention overseas especially in the Middle East, stating, "I think, in Iraq, America has never faced up to the number of people who have died because of our invasion, our aggression against Iraq, and Afghanistan over the last 30 years, since we first inspired a CIA-sponsored jihad against the Soviets there, and led to the invasion by the Soviets. What we’ve done to the Middle East has been hell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/5/18/whistleblower_daniel_ellsberg_civil_disobedience_against|title=Whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg: Civil Disobedience Against Vietnam War Led Me to Leak Pentagon Papers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Activism against US-led war against Iraq====
[[File:DanielEllsberg.THF.WH.WDC.3jul06.jpg|thumb|Protesting with anti-war group [[Code Pink]] in 2006]]
During the runup to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] he warned of a possible "[[Gulf of Tonkin incident|Tonkin Gulf scenario]]" that could be used to justify going to war, and called on government "insiders" to go public with information to counter the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration's]] [[Public relations preparations for 2003 invasion of Iraq|pro-war propaganda campaign]], praising [[Scott Ritter]] for his efforts in that regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://logosonline.home.igc.org/ellsberg.pdf|title=IGC.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later supported the whistleblowing efforts of British [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] translator [[Katharine Gun]] and called on others to leak any papers that reveal government deception about the invasion.&lt;ref name="expertwitnessradio.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expertwitnessradio.org/archives/ellsberg.html |title=The Expert Witness Radio Show with Michael Levine |publisher=Expertwitnessradio.org |accessdate=December 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724162842/http://www.expertwitnessradio.org/archives/ellsberg.html |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellsberg also testified at the 2004 [[conscientious objector]] hearing of [[Camilo Mejia]] at [[Fort Sill|Fort Sill, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name="expertwitnessradio.org"/&gt;

Ellsberg was arrested, in November 2005, for violating a county ordinance for trespassing while protesting against [[George W. Bush]]'s conduct of the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/23/AR2005112302185.html |title=Antiwar Protesters Arrested Near Bush Ranch |work=The Washington Post |date= November 24, 2005|accessdate=December 2, 2010 |first=Rosalind S. |last=Helderman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a member of [[Campaign for Peace and Democracy]].

====Activism against US military action against Iran====
In September 2006, Ellsberg wrote in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' that he hoped someone would leak information about a potential U.S. invasion of [[Iran]] before the invasion happened, to stop the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =The Next War | journal =Harper's Magazine
 | date =October 2006 | url =http://harpers.org/archive/2006/10/the-next-war/ | accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellsberg called for further leaks following the release of information on the acceleration of U.S.-sponsored anti-government activity in Iran that was leaked to journalist [[Seymour Hersh]]. In November 2007, Ellsberg was interviewed by [[Brad Friedman]] on his blog in regard to former FBI translator turned whistle blower [[Sibel Edmonds]]. "I'd say what she has is far more explosive than the Pentagon Papers", Ellsberg told Friedman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Daniel Ellsberg Says Sibel Edmonds Case 'Far More Explosive Than Pentagon Papers'|url=http://www.bradblog.com/?p=5260|website=The Brad Blog|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech on March 30, 2008 in San Francisco's [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] church, Ellsberg observed that [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] doesn't really have the authority to declare [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] "off the table". The oath of office taken by members of congress requires them to "defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic". He also argued that under the [[U.S. Constitution]], treaties, including the [[United Nations Charter]], become the supreme law of the land that neither the states, the president, nor the congress have the power to break. For example, if the Congress votes to authorize an unprovoked attack on a sovereign nation, that authorization wouldn't make the attack legal. A president citing the authorization as just cause could be prosecuted in the [[International Criminal Court]] for [[war crime]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Saryl Weinstein |url=http://warandlaw.homestead.com/files/Ellsnews.htm |title=Congress should probe Bush's Iran attack plan, says Ellsberg, warning of supreme war crime |publisher=Warandlaw.homestead.com |accessdate=December 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for American whistleblowers===
On December 9, 2010, Ellsberg appeared on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' where he commented that the existence of WikiLeaks helps to build a better government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/368131/december-09-2010/international-manhunt-for-julian-assange---daniel-ellsberg|title=The Colbert Report|website=Comedy Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, 2011, Ellsberg, along with 35 other demonstrators, was arrested during a demonstration outside the [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]], in protest of Manning's current detention at [[Marine Corps Brig, Quantico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/843636/arrests-at-wikileaks-marine-base-protest|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714183731/http://news.sky.com/story/843636/arrests-at-wikileaks-marine-base-protest|deadurl=yes|title=Arrests At WikiLeaks Marine Base Protest|date=July 14, 2012|archivedate=July 14, 2012|publisher=Sky News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 2013, Ellsberg published an editorial in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper praising the actions of former [[Booz Allen Hamilton|Booz Allen]] worker [[Edward Snowden]] in revealing top-secret surveillance programs of the [[NSA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Daniel Ellsberg |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/10/edward-snowden-united-stasi-america |title=Edward Snowden: saving us from the United Stasi of America |work=The Guardian |accessdate=June 10, 2013 |location=London |date=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellsberg believes that the United States has fallen into an "abyss" of total tyranny, but said that because of Snowden's revelations, "I see the unexpected possibility of a way up and out of the abyss."

In June 2013, Ellsberg and numerous celebrities appeared in a video showing support for [[Chelsea Manning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/celebrity-bradley-manning-video-93041.html#ixzz2WgfpNmys|title=Celeb video: 'I am Bradley Manning'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFFkcCh-pCc|title=I am Bradley Manning  (full HD)|first=|last=I am Bradley Manning|date=June 18, 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 17, 2010, Ellsberg was interviewed regarding the parallels between his actions in releasing the Pentagon Papers and those of Private First Class [[Chelsea Manning]], who was arrested by the U.S. military in Iraq after allegedly providing to [[WikiLeaks]] a classified video showing [[July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike|U.S. military helicopter gunships strafing and killing Iraqis]] alleged to be civilians, including two [[Reuters]] journalists. Manning claimed to have provided WikiLeaks with secret videos of additional massacres of alleged civilians in Afghanistan, as well as 260,000 classified [[U.S. State Department|State Department]] cables. Ellsberg said that he fears for Manning and for [[Julian Assange]], as he feared for himself after the initial publication of the Pentagon Papers. WikiLeaks initially said it had not received the cables, but did plan to post the video of an [[Garani airstrike|attack that killed 86 to 145 Afghan civilians]] in the village of Garani. Ellsberg expressed hope that either Assange or President Obama would post the video, and expressed his strong support for Assange and Manning, whom he called "two new heroes of mine".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2010/6/17/wikileaks_whistleblowers "With Rumored Manhunt for Wikileaks Founder and Arrest of Alleged Leaker of Video Showing Iraq Killings, Obama Admin Escalates Crackdown on Whistleblowers of Classified Information"] democracynow.org, June 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-06-15/wikileaks-founder-has-garani-massacre-video-according-to-new-email/ "WikiLeaks Founder to Release Massacre Video"] http://www.thedailybeast.com, Philip Shenon, June 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Democracy Now!]]'' devoted a substantial portion of its program July 4, 2013, to "How the Pentagon Papers Came to be Published By the Beacon Press Told by Daniel Ellsberg &amp; Others."  Ellsberg said there are hundreds of public officials right now who know that the public is being lied to about Iran. They all took an oath to protect the Constitution of the United States, not the commander-in-chief, not superior officers. If they follow orders, they may become complicit in starting an unnecessary war. If they are faithful to their oath, they could prevent that war. Exposing official lies could however carry a heavy personal cost as they could be imprisoned for unlawful disclosure of classified information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Goodman |first=Amy |author-link=w:Amy Goodman |title=How the Pentagon Papers Came to be Published By the Beacon Press Told by Daniel Ellsberg &amp; Others |publisher=Democracy Now! |date=July 4, 2013 |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2013/7/4/how_the_pentagon_papers_came_to |accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Ellsberg became one of the co-founders of the [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]].

Ellsberg is a founding member of the [[Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity]].&lt;ref name="AndyWorthington2015-09-15"/&gt;
In September 2015 Ellsberg and 27 other members of VIPS steering group wrote a letter to the President challenging a recently published book, that claimed to rebut the report of the [[United States Senate Intelligence Committee]] on the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s use of torture.

In December 2015, Ellsberg publicly supported the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]], referencing its utility for [[whistle blowing]] in general for the maintenance of [[democracy]] via the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.torproject.org/blog/what-tor-supporter-looks-daniel-ellsberg|title=This is What a Tor Supporter Looks Like: Daniel Ellsberg – Tor Blog|website=blog.torproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for Occupy Movement===
On November 16, 2011 Ellsberg camped on the [[UC Berkeley]] [[Sproul Plaza]] as part of an effort to support the [[Occupy Cal]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/2011/11/16/4059116/daniel-ellsberg-part-of-uc-berkeley.html Daniel Ellsberg part of UC Berkeley Occupy protest]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Doomsday Machine''===
In December 2017, Ellsberg published ''The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a [[Nuclear War]] Planner,'' a book with his recollections and analysis of a second cache of secret documents related to the [[U.S. nuclear arsenal]]. The book stated that US governments documents revealed that [[President Eisenhower]] empowered a few top military officers to be able to use nuclear weapons without presidential authorization in case there was incapacitation or no way to contact the president. Ellsberg believes that similar procedures remain in place today – in sharp contrast to what the American public is told about how the "[[nuclear football]]" works. In the book, Ellsberg revealed that he had made copies of sensitive U.S. nuclear planning materials and memos he had reviewed during his time at the RAND Corporation, and intended to leak them to the public shortly after the Pentagon Papers were published. However, during the time of Ellsberg's trial, these nuclear planning materials were hidden in a briefcase buried in a [[landfill]], and were lost when an unexpected [[tropical storm]] descended on the region.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Canfield, [http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/The-Doomsday-Machine-by-Daniel-Ellsberg-12413956.php ‘The Doomsday Machine,’ by Daniel Ellsberg] ''San Francisco Chronicle'', retrieved December 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Ellsberg is the recipient of the Inaugural [[The Ridenhour Prizes|Ron Ridenhour Courage Prize]], a prize established by [[The Nation Institute]] and The Fertel Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ridenhour.org/recipients_01b.shtml |title=Ron Ridenhour Courage Prize |publisher=Ridenhour.org |accessdate=December 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130193949/http://www.ridenhour.org/recipients_01b.shtml |archivedate=November 30, 2010 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 he accepted the [[Gandhi Peace Award]] from [[Promoting Enduring Peace]]. On September 28, 2006 he was awarded the [[Right Livelihood Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rightlivelihood.org/daniel-ellsberg.html Right Livelihood Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620102101/http://rightlivelihood.org/daniel-ellsberg.html |date=June 20, 2010}} Daniel Ellsberg 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He received the Dresden Peace Prize in 2016.&lt;ref name="Dresden"&gt;{{cite web |title=Laureates – Dresden-Preis |url=http://dresdner-friedenspreis.de/laureates/?lang=en |website=dresdner-friedenspreis.de |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Ellsberg has been married twice. His first marriage was to Carol Cummings, a graduate of Radcliffe (now Harvard College) whose father was a Marine Corps brigadier general. It lasted 13 years before ending in divorce (at her request, as he stated in his memoir ''Secrets''). They have two children, [[Robert Ellsberg]] and Mary Ellsberg. In 1970, he married Patricia Marx, daughter of toy maker [[Louis Marx]]. They are the parents of a son, [[Michael Ellsberg]], who is an author and journalist.&lt;ref name=motherjones1982&gt;{{Cite news|last=Spake|first=Amanda|title=Ellsberg Rising|newspaper=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|location=San Francisco|pages=40–46|date=Sep–Oct 1982|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=duYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA40 |accessdate=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ellsberg.com/ Who Is Michael Ellsberg?].

The '''Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand''' ({{lang-mi|'''He Wakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tireni'''}}), signed by a number of [[Māori people|Māori]] chiefs in 1835, proclaimed the [[Sovereignty|sovereign independence]] of New Zealand prior to the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in 1840.

== Background and signing ==
{{main|History of New Zealand}}
In 1834, [[James Busby]], the official British [[Resident (title)|Resident]] in New Zealand, drafted a document known as the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand, which he and 34&lt;ref name="signing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/background-to-the-treaty/declaration-of-independence|title=Background to the Treaty of Waitangi – Declaration of Independence|publisher=[[nzhistory.net.nz]]|accessdate=31 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811225106/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/background-to-the-treaty/declaration-of-independence|archivedate=11 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; northern Māori chiefs—including [[Tāmati Wāka Nene]], [[Tītore]] and Bay of Islands brothers; [[Te Wharerahi]], Rewa, and [[Moka Te Kainga-mataa]]—signed at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]] on 28 October 1835. By 1839, 52 chiefs had signed.&lt;ref name="signing" /&gt;

In the process of signing, the chiefs established themselves as representing a [[confederation]] under the title of the "[[United Tribes of New Zealand]]". Missionaries [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]] and [[George Clarke (judge)|George Clarke]] translated the Declaration and signed as witnesses;&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{cite book | author=Caroline Fitzgerald | title= Te Wiremu – Henry Williams: Early Years in the North | year= 2011 | isbn=978-1-86969-439-5| publisher= Huia Press }} 261&lt;/ref&gt; merchants [[James Reddy Clendon|James Clendon]] and [[Gilbert Mair (trader)|Gilbert Mair]] also signed as witnesses.&lt;ref name="nzhistory"&gt;{{cite web| work = Translation from Archives New Zealand, New Zealand History online| title= The Declaration of Independence|url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/interactive/the-declaration-of-independence| accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration arose in response to concerns over the lawlessness of British subjects in New Zealand, and in response to a fear that France would declare [[sovereignty]] over the islands. At this time a Frenchman, [[Charles de Thierry]]&lt;ref name="dnzb"&gt;{{cite web| last = Raeside | first = J. D. | work = Dictionary of New Zealand Biography | title= Thierry, Charles Philippe Hippolyte de – Biography | date = 1 September 2010|url= http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/biographies/1t93/1| accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;—who titled himself 'Charles, Baron de Tierry, Sovereign Chief of New Zealand and King of [[Nuku Hiva]]' (in the [[Marquesas Islands]])—was seeking to establish a colony on a {{convert|40000|acre|ha|order=flip|adj=on}} plot of land he claimed to have purchased in the [[Hokianga]].&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald" /&gt; The document also arose from movements in Māori society. From 1816 onwards, a number of Northern Māori chiefs had made visits to the colonies in [[New South Wales]] and [[Norfolk Island]], as well as to England, leading to discussions about unifying the tribes and the formation of a Māori government. Māori had become involved in international trade and owned trading ships. In 1834, the chiefs had selected a flag for use on ships originating from New Zealand.

The need for a flag of New Zealand first became clear when the [[Merchant vessel|merchant ship]] the ''Sir George Murray'', built in the [[Hokianga]], was seized by [[customs]] officials in the port of Sydney. The ship had been sailing without a flag—a violation of British navigation laws. New Zealand was not a colony at the time and had no flag. The ship's detainment reportedly aroused indignation among the Māori population. Unless a flag was selected, ships would continue to be seized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/nzflag/history/united.html|title=Flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand (1834–1840)|work=History of the New Zealand Flag|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|location=New Zealand|accessdate=2007-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-flags/new_zealand.htm|title=The New Zealand Flag|website=www.diggerhistory.info|access-date=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag, amended slightly when officially gazetted, became the first distinctively [[Flag of New Zealand|New Zealand flag]]. As late as 1900 it was still being used to depict New Zealand, and it appeared on the South African War Medal which was issued to New Zealand soldiers of the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] and was inscribed with the phrase "Success to New Zealand Contingent 1899–1900".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/south-african-war-medal Caption to photo], Alexander Turnbull Library, retrieved 15 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The unamended version of the flag, with eight-pointed stars and black fimbriation, is still widely used by Māori groups.

== The Declaration ==
The hereditary chiefs and heads of the tribes of the northern parts of New Zealand declared the constitution of an independent state. They agreed to meet in Waitangi each year to frame laws, and invited the southern tribes of New Zealand to "lay aside their private animosities" and join them.

[[File:Flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[United Tribes of New Zealand]]]]
[[File:UnitedTribesUnofficial.svg|thumb|The original design of the flag, with eight-pointed stars and black fimbriation, is today widely used by Māori groups.]]

=== Explanation of the Māori text===
The Māori text of the Declaration was made by the ''tino rangatira'' (hereditary chiefs) of the northern part of New Zealand and uses the term ''Rangatiratanga'' to mean independence, declaring the country a ''whenua Rangatira'' (independent state) to be known as The United Tribes of New Zealand (Te Wakaminenga o nga Hapu o Nu Tireni).{{Refn|It should be noted that throughout the document the usual use of "wh" is largely replaced by "w" — a spelling indicative of the document having been largely created by iwi from the western North Island. This is most notable in the use of the term "wakaputanga" (rather than the more common "whakaputanga") in the title.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tewakamokopuna.net/1835declenglish.html Declaration of Independence 1835]," ''Te Waka o te Mokopuna''. Retrieved 6 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;|name=spelling|group=note}}

The translation of the second paragraph is "that all sovereign power and authority in the land" ("Ko te Kingitanga ko te mana i te w[h]enua")&lt;ref name="nzhistory" /&gt; should "reside entirely and exclusively in the hereditary chiefs and heads of tribes in their collective capacity", expressed as the United Tribes of New Zealand.&lt;ref name="nzhistory" /&gt;

The terms ''Kingitanga'' and [[mana|''man''a]] were used in claiming sovereignty of the state to the assembly of the hereditary chiefs, and it was also declared that no government (''[[kawanatanga]]'') would exist except by persons appointed by the assembly of hereditary chiefs.

==The impacts of the Declaration==
The signatories sent a copy of the document to King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] (who reigned from 1830 to 1837), asking him to act as the protector of the new state. The King had previously acknowledged the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand, and now recognised the Declaration in a letter from [[Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg|Lord Glenelg]] (British [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]]) dated 25 May 1836.&lt;ref name=glenelgletter&gt;{{Citation| last=The Lord Glenelg| author-link=Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg| date=25 May 1836| contribution=EXTRACT of a DESPATCH from Lord GLENELG to Major-General Sir RICHARD BOURKE, New South Wales| title=Documents &gt; Declaration of Independence| place=London| publication-place=Christchurch| publisher=Waitangi Associates| url=http://www.waitangi.co.nz/declarationindependence.htm#Extract| accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It read, in part:

{{Cquote
| quote = I have received a letter from Mr. Busby, enclosing a copy of a Declaration made by the chiefs of the Northern parts of New Zealand, setting forth the Independence of their country, and declaring the Union of their respective tribes into one State, under the designation of The United Tribes of New Zealand.

I perceive that the chiefs at the same time came to the resolution to send a copy of their Declaration to His Majesty, to thank him for his acknowledgment of their Flag, and to entreat that, in return for the friendship and protection which they have shown, and are prepared to show, to such British subjects as have settled in their country or resorted to its shores for the purposes of trade, His Majesty will continue to be the parent of their infant State, and its Protector from all attempts on its independence.

With reference to the desire which the chiefs have expressed on this occasion to maintain a good understanding with His Majesty's subjects, it will be proper that they should be assured, in His Majesty's name, that He will not fail to avail himself of every opportunity of showing his goodwill, and of affording to those chiefs such support and protection as may be consistent with a due regard to the just rights of others, and to the interests of His Majesty's subjects.
| author = [[Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg|Lord Glenelg]]
| source = in a letter to Major-General Sir [[Richard Bourke]], Governor of New South Wales, 25 May 1836.&lt;ref name=glenelgletter /&gt;
}}

The Declaration was not well received by the Colonial Office, and it was decided that a new policy for New Zealand was needed as a corrective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/declaration-of-independence-taming-the-frontier |title=Taming the frontier Page 4 – Declaration of Independence |date=23 September 2016 |website=NZ History |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |access-date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is notable that the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] was made between the British Crown and "the chiefs of the United Tribes of New Zealand" in recognition of their independent sovereignty.

== Legal effect ==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--two paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
There is some debate as to whether the Declaration had any legal effect in New Zealand. Most legal commentators argue that the claim to independence lasted only until the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840.&lt;ref name="nzh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/declaration-of-independence-taming-the-frontier|title=Declaration of Independence – taming the frontier?|website=NZ History |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the [[Ngāpuhi]] [[iwi]] (tribe) in Northland requested that the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] rule on whether the tribe had in fact relinquished sovereignty in 1840 when they signed the Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3659/features/15675/independence_daze.html;jsessionid=0C3139CDC49711529FC7EABE62AE22DA|title=Independence Daze|publisher=[[New Zealand Listener|The Listener]]|date=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Paul Moon]] has stated that the tribe is unlikely to be able to take the claim much further because "the tribe has misunderstood how treaties work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor questions Ngapuhi claim|publisher=[[TVNZ]]|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/professor-questions-ngapuhi-claim-3584586|date=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 2 of the Treaty of Waitangi guarantees to the chiefs their continued chieftainship, and ownership of their lands and treasures (''taonga''). It also specifies that Māori could sell land only to the Crown. Most New Zealanders consider the Treaty of Waitangi to be the nation's founding document, with formal sovereignty vested in the British Crown (the [[Monarchy in New Zealand|Crown in Right of New Zealand]] from 1947), but the existence of different versions of the Treaty, in both Māori and English, and its brevity, leave this subject to arguments over the preferred interpretation.

But ''de facto'', the federation of independent tribes became subsumed into a new political body after 1840, regardless of the legality or legitimacy of this process. Thus, the Treaty of Waitangi voided the Declaration for all practical purposes; it is the Treaty, rather than the Declaration, that provides the legal foundation of claims for the redress of historical wrongs. For this reason, constitutional lawyers regard the Declaration as a historical document that no longer has legal force.

=== Ngāpuhi Waitangi Tribunal claim (Te Paparahi o te Raki inquiry) ===
In 2010 the Waitangi Tribunal began hearing Ngāpuhi's claim that sovereignty was not ceded in their signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Field|first=Michael|title=Hearing starts into Ngapuhi's claims|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3674280/Hearing-starts-into-Ngapuhis-claims|work=Hearing starts into Ngapuhi's claims|publisher=Farifax New Zealand|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribunal, in their ''Te Paparahi o te Raki'' inquiry (Wai 1040)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/tribunals/waitangi-tribunal/inquiries/district-inquiries/te-paparahi-o-te-raki-northland|title=Waitangi Tribunal {{!}} Waitangi Tribunal|website=www.justice.govt.nz|language=en-NZ|access-date=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/inquiries/genericinquiries/northland/|title=Te Paparahi o Te Raki (Northland) inquiry|date=|publisher=Waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in the process of considering the Māori and Crown understandings of the Declaration and the Treaty. This aspect of the inquiry raises issues as to the nature of sovereignty and whether the Māori signatories to the Treaty of Waitangi intended to transfer sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Moon (2002) ''Te Ara Ki Te Tiriti: The Path to the Treaty of Waitangi''&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the arguments used are outlined in Paul Moon's book ''Te Ara Ki Te Tiriti: The Path to the Treaty of Waitangi'' (2003), which argued that not only did the Māori signatories have no intention of transferring sovereignty, but that at the time the British government and James Busby did not wish to acquire it and that the developments and justifications leading to the present state were later developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book lies at the heart of Ngapuhi's sovereignty|url=http://www.nznewsuk.co.uk/living/?id=8088|work=Book lies at the heart of Ngāpuhi's sovereignty|publisher=Sky News New Zealand|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that the hearings will last between 4 and 6 years, and may stand as a precedent for all iwi if the Tribunal recognises Ngāpuhi sovereignty. A common Ngāpuhi interpretation of the Declaration of the United Tribes is that the British government was simply recognising Māori independence and putting the world on notice, merely re-asserting sovereignty that had existed "from time immemorial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=joshua hitchcock sets the record straight regarding ngapuhi, sovereignty, and legal pluralism in new zealand 03aug10|url=http://settlercolonialstudies.org/2010/08/03/joshua-hitchcock-sets-the-record-straight-regarding-ngapuhi-sovereignty-and-legal-pluralism-in-new-zealand/|work=joshua hitchcock sets the record straight regarding ngapuhi, sovereignty, and legal pluralism in new zealand 03aug10|publisher=settlercolonialstudies.org|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital curation establishes, maintains and adds value to repositories of digital data for present and future use.&lt;ref name="dccdefn"/&gt; This is often accomplished by [[archivist]]s, librarians, scientists, historians, and scholars. Enterprises are starting to use digital curation to improve the quality of information and data within their operational and strategic processes.&lt;ref&gt;E. Curry, A. Freitas, and S. O'Riáin, [http://www.edwardcurry.org/publications/curry_LED_Curation_2010.pdf "The Role of Community-Driven Data Curation for Enterprises,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123161104/http://3roundstones.com/led_book/led-curry-et-al.html |date=2012-01-23 }} in Linking Enterprise Data, D. Wood, Ed. Boston, MA: Springer US, 2010, pp. 25-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Successful digital curation will mitigate digital obsolescence, keeping the information accessible to users indefinitely.

The term ''[[curator|curation]]'' in the past commonly referred to museum and library professionals. It has since been applied to interaction with [[social media]] including compiling digital images, web links and movie files.

== Core Principles and Activities ==
The term “digital curation” was first used in the [[E-Science|e-science]] and [[Biology|biological science]] fields as a means of differentiating the additional suite of activities ordinarily employed by library and museum curators to add value to their collections and enable its reuse&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dallas|first=Costis|date=2016-12-01|title=Digital curation beyond the "wild frontier": a pragmatic approach|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10502-015-9252-6|journal=Archival Science|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=421–457|doi=10.1007/s10502-015-9252-6|issn=1389-0166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18590|title=Preparing the Workforce for Digital Curation|last=Council|first=National Research|date=2015-04-22|isbn=9780309296946|language=en|doi=10.17226/18590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beagrie|first=Neil|title=Digital Curation for Science, Digital Libraries, and Individuals|url=http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/6|journal=International Journal of Digital Curation|language=en-US|volume=1|pages=3–16|doi=10.2218/ijdc.v1i1.2|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the smaller subtask of simply preserving the data, a significantly more concise archival task.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, the historical understanding of the term “[[curator]]” demands more than simple care of the collection. A [[curator]] is expected to command academic mastery of the subject matter as a requisite part of appraisal and selection of assets and any subsequent adding of value to the collection through application of metadata.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Principles ===
There are five commonly accepted principles that govern the occupation of digital curation:
* Manage the complete birth-to-retirement life cycle of the digital asset.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Evaluate and cull assets for inclusion in the collection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Apply preservation methods to strengthen the asset’s integrity and reusability for future users.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Act proactively throughout the asset life cycle to add value to both the digital asset and the collection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Facilitate the appropriate degree of access to users.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Methodology===
The [[Digital Curation Centre|Digital Curation Center]] offers the following step-by-step life cycle procedures for putting the above principles into practice:&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/curation-lifecycle-model|title=DCC Curation Lifecycle Model {{!}} Digital Curation Centre|website=www.dcc.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Conceptualize: Consider what digital material you will be creating and develop storage options. Take into account websites, publications, email, among other types of digital output.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Create: Produce digital material and attach all relevant [[metadata]], typically the more metadata the more accessible the information.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Access and use: Determine the level of accessibility for the range of digital material created. Some material may be accessible only by password and other material may be freely accessible to the public.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* [[Archival appraisal|Appraise]] and select: Consult the mission statement of the institution or private collection and determine what digital data is relevant. There may also be legal guidelines in place that will guide the decision process for a particular collection.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Dispose: Discard any digital material that is not deemed necessary to the institution.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Ingest: Send digital material to the predetermined storage solution. This may be an archive, repository or other facility.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Preservation action: Employ measures to maintain the integrity of the digital material.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Reappraise: Reevaluate material to ensure that is it still relevant and is true to its original form.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Store: Secure data within the predetermined storage facility.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Access and reuse: Routinely check that material is still accessible for the intended audience and that the material has not been compromised through multiple uses.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Transform: If desirable or necessary the material may be transferred into a different digital format.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Related terms ==
The term "digital curation" is sometimes used interchangeably with terms such as "[[digital preservation]]" and "[[digital archiving]]". While digital preservation does focus a significant degree of energy on optimizing reusability, preservation remains a subtask to the concept of digital archiving, which is in turn a subtask of digital curation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;  For example, archiving is a part of curation, but so are subsequent tasks such as themed collection-building, which is not considered an archival task. Similarly, preservation is a part of archiving, but so are the important tasks of selection and [[Archival appraisal|appraisal]] that are not necessarily part of preservation.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

[[Data curation]] is another term that is often used interchangeably with digital curation, however common usage of the two terms differs. While “[[data]]” is a more all-encompassing term that can be used generally to indicate anything recorded in binary form, the term “data curation” is most common in scientific parlance and usually refers to accumulating and managing information relative to the process of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/900409008|title=Big data, little data, no data : scholarship in the networked world|last=1951-|first=Borgman, Christine L.,|isbn=9780262327862|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=900409008}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, while documents and other discrete [[digital asset]]s are technically a subset of the broader concept of data,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in the context of scientific vernacular digital curation represents a broader purview of responsibilities than data curation due to its interest in preserving and adding value to digital assets of any kind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Challenges ==

=== Rate of creation of new data and data sets ===
The ever lowering cost, and increasing prevalence of entirely new categories of technology has led to a quickly growing flow of new data sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ray|first=Joyce|date=2009|title=Sharks, digital curation, and the education of information professionals|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09647770903314720|journal=Museum Management and Curatorship|volume=24 |issue=4|pages=358|via=|doi=10.1080/09647770903314720}}&lt;/ref&gt; These come from well established sources such as business and government, but the trend is also driven by new styles of sensors becoming embedded in more areas of modern life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is particularly true of consumers, whose production of digital assets is no longer relegated strictly to work. Consumers now create wider ranges of digital assets, including videos, photos, location data, purchases, and fitness tracking data, just to name a few, and share them in wider ranges of social platforms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Additionally, the advance of technology has introduced new ways of working with data. Some examples of this are international partnerships that leverage astronomical data to create “virtual observatories”, and similar partnerships have also leveraged data resulting from research at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]] and the database of protein structures at the [[Protein Data Bank]].&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

=== Storage format evolution and obsolescence ===
By comparison, archiving of analog assets is notably passive in nature, often limited to simply ensuring a suitable storage environment. Digital preservation requires a more proactive approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Higgins|first=Sarah|title=Digital Curation: The Emergence of a New Discipline|url=http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/184|journal=International Journal of Digital Curation|language=en-US|volume=6|issue=2|pages=78–88|doi=10.2218/ijdc.v6i2.191|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today’s artifacts of cultural significance are notably transient in nature and prone to obsolescence when social trends or dependent technologies change.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This rapid progression of technology occasionally makes it necessary to migrate digital asset holdings from one file format to another in order to mitigate the dangers of hardware and software obsolescence which would render the asset unusable.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Underestimation of human labor costs ===
Modern tools for program planning often underestimate the amount of human labor costs required for adequate digital curation of large collections. As a result cost-benefit assessments often paint an inaccurate picture of both the amount of work involved, and the true cost to the institution for both successful outcomes and failures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Standardization and coordination between institutions ===
An absence of coordination across different sectors of society and industry in areas such as the standardization of [[Semantics|semantic]] and [[Ontology|ontological]] definitions,&lt;ref name="ijdcpw2007112"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijdc.net/./ijdc/article/view/43/50|title=Digital Preservation Theory and Application: Transcontinental Persistent Archives Testbed Activity|author=Paul Watry|date=November 2007|publisher=The International Journal of Digital Curation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315030030/http://www.ijdc.net/ijdc/article/view/43/50|archivedate=2008-03-15|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2008-04-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in forming partnerships for proper stewardship of assets has resulted in a lack of interoperability between institutions, and a partial breakdown in digital curation practice from the standpoint of the ordinary user.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Digitization of analog materials ===
The curation of digital objects is not limited to strictly born-digital assets. Many institutions have engaged in monumental efforts to digitize analog holdings in an effort to increase access to their collections. Examples of these materials are books, photographs, maps, audio recordings, and more.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The process of converting printed resources into digital collections has been epitomized to some degree by librarians and related specialists. For example, The [[Digital Curation Centre]] is claimed to be a "world leading centre of expertise in digital information curation"&lt;ref name="Digital Curation Centre2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcc.ac.uk/about-us|title=About the DCC|last=Digital Curation Centre|work=Website|publisher=Digital Curation Centre|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that assists higher education research institutions in such conversions.

=== New representational formats ===
For some topics, knowledge is embodied in forms that have not been conducive to print, such as how choreography of dance or of the motion of skilled workers or artisans is difficult to encode. New digital approaches such as 3D [[hologram]]s and other computer-programmed expressions are developing.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

For mathematics, it seems possible for a new common language to be developed that would express mathematical ideas in ways that can be digitally stored, linked, and made accessible. The [[Global Digital Mathematics Library]] is a project to define and develop such a language.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

=== Accessibility ===
The ability of the intended user community to access the repository’s holdings is of equal importance to all the preceding curatorial tasks. This must take into account not only the user community’s format and communication preferences, but also a consideration of communities that should not have access for various legal or privacy reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lavoie|first=Brian|last2=OCLC|title=The Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model: Introductory Guide (2nd Edition)|url=http://www.dpconline.org/component/docman/doc_download/1359-dpctw14-02|doi=10.7207/twr14-02|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
Many approaches to digital curation exist, and have evolved over time in response to the changing technological landscape. Two examples of this are sheer curation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and channelization{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

''Sheer curation'' is an approach to digital curation where curation activities are quietly integrated into the normal work flow of those creating and managing data and other digital assets. The word sheer is used to emphasize the lightweight and virtually transparent nature of these curation activities. The term ''sheer curation'' was coined by Alistair Miles in the ImageStore project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://imageweb.zoo.ox.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/The_ImageStore_Project The ImageStore Project - ImageWeb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK Digital Curation Centre's SCARP project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcc.ac.uk/scarp/ Digital Curation Centre: DCC SCARP Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The approach depends on curators having close contact or 'immersion' in data creators' working practices. An example is the case study of a neuroimaging research group by Whyte et al., which explored ways of building its digital curation capacity around the apprenticeship style of learning of neuroimaging researchers, through which they share access to datasets and re-use experimental procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, A., Job, D., Giles, S. and Lawrie, S. (2008) '[http://www.ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/74/53 Meeting Curation Challenges in a Neuroimaging Group]', The International Journal of Digital Curation Issue 1, Volume 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheer curation depends on the hypothesis that good data and digital asset management at the point of creation and primary use is also good practice in preparation for sharing, publication and/or [[long-term preservation]] of these assets. Therefore, sheer curation attempts to identify and promote tools and good practices in local data and digital asset management in specific domains, where those tools and practices add immediate value to the creators and primary users of those assets. Curation can best be supported by identifying existing practices of sharing, stewardship and re-use that add value, and augmenting them in ways that both have short-term benefits, and in the longer term reduce risks to digital assets or provide new opportunities to sustain their long-term accessibility and re-use value.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The aim of sheer curation is to establish a solid foundation for other curation activities which may not directly benefit the creators and primary users of digital assets, especially those required to ensure long-term preservation. By providing this foundation, further curation activities may be carried out by specialists at appropriate institutional and organisation levels, whilst causing the minimum of interference to others.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

A similar idea is ''curation at source'' used in the context of Laboratory Information Management Systems [[Laboratory information management system|LIMS]]. This refers more specifically to automatic recording of metadata or information about data at the point of capture, and has been developed to apply semantic web techniques to integrate laboratory instrumentation and documentation systems.&lt;ref&gt;Frey, J. [http://www.allhands.org.uk/2008/programme/jeremyfrey.cfm 'Sharing and Collaboration' keynote presentation at UK e-Science All Hands Meeting], 8–11 September 2008, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; Sheer curation and curation-at-source can be contrasted with post hoc [[digital preservation]], where a project is initiated to preserve a collection of digital assets that have already been created and are beyond the period of their primary use.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

''Channelization'' is curation of digital assets on the web, often by brands and media companies, into continuous flows of content, turning the user experience from a lean-forward interactive medium, to a lean-back passive medium. The curation of content can be done by an independent third party, that selects media from any number of on-demand outlets from across the globe and adds them to a playlist to offer a digital "channel" dedicated to certain subjects, themes, or interests so that the end user would see and/or hear a continuous stream of content.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7426">In [[computing]], a '''directory structure''' is the way an [[operating system]]'s [[file system]] and its files are displayed to the user. Files are typically displayed in a [[hierarchical tree structure]].

==File names and extensions==
A [[filename]] is a string used to uniquely identify a file stored on the file system of a computer. Before the advent of [[32-bit]] operating systems, file names were typically limited to short names (6 to 14 characters in size). Modern operating systems now typically allow much longer filenames (more than 250 characters per [[Path (computing)|pathname]] element).

==Windows, DOS and OS/2==
In [[DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and [[OS/2]], the root directory is "''drive'':\", for example, the root directory is usually "C:\". The directory separator is usually a "\", but the operating system also internally recognizes a "/". Physical and virtual drives are named by a drive letter, as opposed to being combined as one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~tbw/spars/dept.faqs/file_dir_structure.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918144114/http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~tbw/spars/dept.faqs/file_dir_structure.htm |archivedate=2009-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that there is no "formal" root directory, but rather that there are independent root directories on each drive. However, it is possible to combine two drives into one virtual drive letter, by setting a hard drive into a [[RAID]] setting of 0.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/perf/raid/levels/singleLevel0-c.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windows 10===
The following folders may appear in the root of a [[System partition and boot partition#Microsoft definition|boot partition]].
{|class="wikitable"
|-
! style="width:13em" | Folder
!Description
|-
|
&lt;code&gt;\PerfLogs&lt;/code&gt; (Hidden)
|May hold Windows performance logs, but on a default configuration, it is empty.

&lt;code&gt;\Program Files (x86)&lt;/code&gt;
|Appears on 64-bit editions of Windows. 32-bit and 16-bit apps are by default installed in this folder, even though 16-bit apps do not run on 64-bit Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=Raymond|title=Why was the replacement installer for recognized 16-bit installers itself a 32-bit program instead of a 64-bit program?|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/02/11/10592548.aspx|website=The Old New Thing|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|
&lt;code&gt;\ProgramData&lt;/code&gt;
|Contains program data that are expected to be accessed by computer programs regardless of the user account in the context of which they run. For example, an app may store specific information needed to operate [[DVD recorder]]s or [[image scanner]]s connected to a computer, because all users use them. Windows itself uses this folder. For example, [[Windows Defender]] stores its [[virus definition]]s in &lt;code&gt;\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender&lt;/code&gt;. Programs do not have permission to store files in this folder, but have permission to create subfolders and store files in them. The organization of the files is at the discretion of the developer.
|-
|
&lt;code&gt;\Users&lt;/code&gt;
|User profile folders. This folder contains one subfolder for each user that has logged onto the system at least once. In addition, it has two other folders: "&lt;code&gt;Public&lt;/code&gt;" and "&lt;code&gt;Default&lt;/code&gt;" (Hidden). It also has two folder like-items called "Default User" (an [[NTFS junction point]] to "Default" folder) and "All Users" (a [[NTFS symbolic link]] to "C:\ProgramData").
|-
|
:&lt;code&gt;\Public&lt;/code&gt;
|This folder serves as a buffer for users of a computer to share files. By default this folder is accessible to all users that can log on to the computer. Also, by default, this folder is shared over the network, although anonymous access (i.e. without a valid password-protected user account) to it is denied. This folder contains user data, not program data, meaning that users are expected to be sole decider of what is in this folder and how it is organized. It is unethical for an app to store its proprietary data here. (There are other folders dedicated to program data.)
|-
|
:&lt;code&gt;[username]\AppData&lt;/code&gt;
|This folder stores per-user application data and settings. The folder contains three subfolders: &lt;code&gt;Roaming&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Local&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;LocalLow&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Roaming&lt;/code&gt; is for networked based logins for roaming profiles. Data saved in &lt;code&gt;Roaming&lt;/code&gt; will synchronize to the computer when the user logs into that. &lt;code&gt;Local&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LocalLow&lt;/code&gt; does not sync up with networked computers. &lt;ref&gt;http://superuser.com/questions/21458/why-are-there-directories-called-local-locallow-and-roaming-under-users-user&lt;/ref&gt;

|
&lt;code&gt;\Windows&lt;/code&gt;
|Windows itself is installed into this folder.
|-
|
:&lt;code&gt;\System&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;\System32&lt;/code&gt;

The '''Dormition Cathedral in Vladimir''' (sometimes translated '''Assumption Cathedral''') ({{lang-ru|Собор Успения Пресвятой Богородицы}}, ''Sobor Uspeniya Presvyatoy Bogoroditsy'') was a mother church of Medieval [[Russia]] in the 13th and 14th centuries. It is part of a [[World Heritage Site]], the [[White Monuments of Vladimir and Suzdal]].

The [[cathedral]] was commissioned by [[Andrew the Pious]] in his capital, [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], and [[consecration|dedicated]] to the [[Dormition]] of the [[Theotokos]] ([[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]), whom he promoted as the [[patron saint]] of his lands. Originally erected in 1158 to 1160, the cathedral, with six pillars and five domes, was expanded in 1185 to 1189 to reflect the augmented prestige of Vladimir. At of 1178 m², it remained the largest of Russian churches for the next 300 or 400 years.

Andrew the Pious, [[Vsevolod the Big Nest]] and other rulers of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] were interred in the [[crypt]] of this church. Unlike many other churches, the cathedral survived the great devastation and fire of Vladimir in 1239, when the [[Mongol]] hordes of [[Batu Khan]] took hold of the capital.

The exterior walls of the church are covered with elaborate carvings. The interior was painted in the 12th century and then repainted by [[Andrei Rublev]] and [[Daniil Chernyi]] in 1408. The Dormition Cathedral served as a model for [[Aristotele Fioravanti]], when he designed the [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|eponymous cathedral]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]] in 1475 to 1479. A lofty [[belltower]], combining genuine Russian, [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] influences, was erected nearby in 1810.

In [[German folklore]], a '''drude''' ({{lang-de|Drude}}, [[plural|pl.]] ''Druden''&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Lurker. &lt;i&gt;A Dictionary of Gods and Goddesses, Devils and Demons&lt;/i&gt;, Routledge, 1987, 53&lt;/ref&gt;) is a kind of malevolent nocturnal spirit (an [[elf]] ([[Alp (folklore)|Alp]]) or [[kobold]] or a [[hag]]) associated with [[nightmare]]s, prevalent especially in [[Southern Germany]].  Druden were said to participate in the [[Wild Hunt]] and were considered a particular class of demon in [[Alfonso de Spina]]'s [[classification of demons|hierarchy]]. The word also came to be used as a generic term for "[[witch]]" in the 16th century ([[Hans Sachs]]).

The word is attested as Middle High German ''trute'', 
In early modern lexicography and down to the 19th century, it was popularly associated with the word ''[[druid]]'', without any etymological justification. 
Its actual origin is unknown. [[Jacob Grimm|Grimm]] suggests derivation from a euphemistic ''trût''  (modern ''traut'') "dear, beloved; intimate", but cites as an alternative suggestion a relation to the [[valkyrie]]'s name [[Þrúðr]]. &lt;ref&gt;Kluge, F. ''Etymologisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache'', Berlin 1989&lt;/ref&gt; If so it is natural to connect the ''druden'' with the daughter of the chieftain of the gods in the Norse religion, [[Thor]], and his wife [[Sif]]. 

{{anchor|Drudenfuss}}
[[File:Wappen Weiler-Rems.svg|thumb|150px|The [[:de:Weiler (Schorndorf)|Weiler-Rems]] coat of arms containing a Drudenfuss]]
The ''Drudenfuss'' (or ''Drudenfuß''), literally "drude's foot" (also ''Alpfuss''&lt;ref&gt;[[Kaspar von Stieler]] (1691) records  ''drutenfuß, alpfuß'', and also ''druidenfuß''&lt;/ref&gt;), is the [[pentagram]] symbol (in early usage also either a pentagram or a [[hexagram]]), believed to ward off demons, explicitly so named in [[Goethe]]'s [[Faust I|Faust]] (1808). The word has been in use since at least the 17th century, recorded by [[Justus Georg Schottelius]] (as ''drutenfusz'', glossed ''omnis incolumitatis signum ''). Its apotropaic use is well recorded for 18th- to 19th-century folk belief in Bavaria and Tyrol.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]'', s.v. "Drudenfuß".&lt;/ref&gt;

''Drudenfuss'' is also the German name of the pentagram used as a heraldic device (alternatively ''Drudenkreuz'' "drude's cross" and  ''Alpfuß,  Alfenfuß'' "elf-foot" or ''Alpkreuz'' "elf-cross") besides the more descriptive ''Pentalpha'' or ''Fünfstern''.
 
A ''Drudenstein'' is a pebble with a naturally formed hole in the center. In Bavaria, such pebbles were hung in rooms, on cradles or in stables to ward off nightmares, or to protect horses against matted manes or tails.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Panzer, ''Bayerische sagen und Bräuche '' vol. 2 (1855), 164. 429,&lt;/ref&gt;


''Drudenfuss'' is another name for [[mistletoe]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/7-surprising-facts-about-mistletoe/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Edmund Boyd Osler''' (20 November 1845 &amp;ndash; August 4, 1924) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] businessman, politician, and philanthropist. Osler was a founder and benefactor of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]]

== Early life ==

Osler was born at Bond Head, Upper Canada near [[New Tecumseth, Ontario|Tecumseh Township]], [[Simcoe County]], [[Ontario|Canada West]] in 1845.&lt;ref name="canparl"/&gt; He was the fourth son of Featherstone Lake Osler, a former lieutenant in the [[Royal Navy]] turned [[Anglican|Anglican Reverend]], and Ellen Free Pickton.  Osler attended grammar school in [[Dundas, Ontario|Dundas, Upper Canada]].  Unlike his elder brothers he did not attend university.&lt;ref name="canbio"/&gt;

== Financial career ==

In the late 1850s, Osler began his career as a clerk at the [[Bank of Upper Canada]].   The bank failed in 1866.&lt;ref name="canbio"/&gt; Osler became business partners with his colleague Henry Pellat and together they launched their own firm specializing in stockbroking, investment, and insurance services.  Osler often served as a financier in numerous business ventures.&lt;ref name="canbio"/&gt; Throughout the 1880s to 1890s, Osler greatly increased his financial influence through a combination of investments, westward railway expansions, and western land grants.&lt;ref name="canbio"/&gt; Osler was an early shareholder of the [[the Dominion Bank|Dominion Bank]] and gained a directorship with the bank in 1881.  He would become the bank’s president in 1901.&lt;ref name="canbio"/&gt;

Beginning in the 1880s, Osler began working in the transportation industry through railways.  Osler was the founder and managing director of the Ontario and Qu'Appelle Land Company Limited.  His business expertise and connections led to his presidency of the Ontario and Quebec Railway followed by a directorship with the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].&lt;ref name="canbio"/&gt; In 1896, Osler became the president of the Board of Trade.  Osler was also the president of the Toronto Ferry Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oslerhouse.com/rm3.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729134435/http://www.oslerhouse.com/rm3.htm |archivedate=2014-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==

Due to his financial success, many believed that Osler should enter politics.  Osler began his political career in the 1892 [[Old Toronto|mayoralty race]].  He lost to [[Robert John Fleming|R.J. Fleming]] despite having the support of the Toronto establishment.&lt;ref name="rom"/&gt; Osler ran in the [[Canadian federal election, 1896|1896 federal election]] and was elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] as the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] representative of [[West Toronto]]. He served as a [[Member of Parliament|MP]] until 1917. Osler was knighted in 1912.

== Later life ==

After his political retirement, Osler continued to have an active involvement in Canadian business.  By 1921, Osler concurrently held directorships in eight companies, presidencies in another three, and vice-presidency in one. Osler died in 1924 at the age of 78.&lt;ref name="canparl"/&gt; At the time of his death, his estate was valued at nearly $4 million.  In the years prior to his death, Osler had promised money to his friends to support various funds and causes which were posthumously covered by his estate.&lt;ref name="canbio"/&gt;

== Philanthropy ==

Beginning in the 1870s Osler became involved with philanthropy.  His expertise as a successful businessman helped fund and support important causes related to arts, cultures, and health in the city of [[Toronto]]. Osler became a trustee for the [[The Hospital for Sick Children|Hospital for Sick Children]] in 1878.  He also helped fund the new [[Toronto General Hospital]].&lt;ref name="canbio"/&gt; Osler lived in the Toronto neighbourhood of [[Rosedale, Toronto|Rosedale]] at his estate Craigleigh. The Osler family donated the estate to the [[Municipal government of Toronto|City of Toronto]] after Osler's death; today the site of Craigleigh Gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbantoronto.ca/news/2012/04/heritage-toronto-moment-home-sir-edmund-boyd-osler |title=Heritage Toronto Moment: Home of Sir Edmund Boyd Osler|date=April 3, 2012|author=Evan Manning|publisher=UrbanToronto.ca|accessdate=September 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osler was a founder and generous benefactor to the [[Royal Ontario Museum]].  Together with [[George Agnew Reid]], [[Byron Edmund Walker]] and others, Osler participated in the campaign to found an art museum in [[Toronto]] in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name="rom"/&gt; Osler began his involvement on a trip to Egypt from 1906 to 1907 where he met Charles T. Currelly, archaeologist and future director of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]].  In 1909 Osler personally pledged $50 000 over five years to assist with the collection of artefacts for the [[Royal Ontario Museum|future museum]].&lt;ref name="rom"/&gt; Osler would further contribute in 1912 by donating a large collection of paintings by [[Paul Kane]] to the cause.  Through Osler’s and others influence, the Crown passed the Royal Ontario Museum Act in 1912 which led to the opening of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] in 1914.&lt;ref name="canbio"/&gt; Osler's descendants, the Matthews family, continue to support the [[Royal Ontario Museum|museum]] to the present day.  The [[Royal Ontario Museum|museum’s]] Sir Edmund Osler Gate to the wing of the Matthews Family Court of Chinese Sculpture is named after him.&lt;ref name="rom"/&gt;

== Personal life ==

Osler was born at [[New Tecumseth, Ontario|Tecumseh Township]], [[Simcoe County]], [[Ontario|Canada West]] and grew up in the area of present-day [[Hamilton, Ontario]].  His brothers were [[Britton Bath Osler]] (founder of [[Osler, Hoskin &amp; Harcourt]]), and doctor [[William Osler|Sir William Osler]].&lt;ref name="canbio"/&gt; Osler was married twice.  He married his first wife, Isabella Lammond Smith, in 1868.  Smith and Osler had two children who died in infancy and Smith died in 1871.  In 1873, Osler married Annie Farquarson (1848 – 1910).  The couple had six children; three daughters and three sons.&lt;ref name="canbio"/&gt; Osler’s grandson, [[Edmund Boyd Osler (Manitoba politician)|Edmund Boyd Osler]] (1919-1987), was a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] member of the Canadian House of Commons for [[Winnipeg South Centre]].&lt;ref name="canparl"/&gt;

Osler descended from a [[British people|British]] family with a long naval tradition.  Edmund's great grandfather, Edward Osler, was variously described as either a [[Merchant shipping|merchant seaman]] or a [[pirate]].  One of Edmund's uncles served as a medical officer in the [[Royal Navy|Navy]] and wrote the ''Life of Lord Exmouth'' and the poem ''The Voyage''. Osler’s father was Featherstone Lake Osler (1805–1895).  Featherstone was the son of a ship owner from [[Falmouth, Cornwall]].  Featherstone formerly served in the [[Royal Navy]] as a Lieutenant on the [[H.M.S. Victory]]. In 1831 Featherstone Osler was invited to serve on [[H.M.S. Beagle]] as the science officer on [[Charles Darwin]]'s historic voyage to the [[Galápagos Islands]], but turned it down as his father was dying.  Featherstone retired from the navy in 1837 and emigrated to [[Canada]].  Featherstone married Ellen Free Pickton and they had four sons, Edmund was their youngest.  In Canada, Featherstone became an Anglican Reverend.&lt;ref name="canbio"/&gt;

Johann Heinrich Alsted published the ''Encyclopaedia'' in seven volumes in 1620&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/258029995 worldcat entry]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Herborn (Hesse)|Herborn]]. It is often argued that this is the first work to bear the title "encyclopedia", though [[Joachim Sterck van Ringelbergh]]'s ''Lucubrationes vel potius absolutissima kyklopaideia'' was published in 1538, and [[Paul Scalich]] published ''[[Encyclopediae seu orbis disciplinarum tam sacrarum quam profanarum epistemon]]'' in 1559.

Alsted was attempting with his ''Encyclopaedia'' to emulate the combination system of [[Ramon Llull]] as set out in Llull's 1308 ''[[Ars Magna (Ramon Llull)|Ars Magna]]'', and thus to formulate a system of universal knowledge and a Llullian method for systematising the sciences. The scheme includes categorisations such as:

* generic - specific;
* peripheral - central;
* internal - external;
* communal - individual;
* quantum ad locum - ad conditionem ad aetatem;
* preparatorius - elaboratorius.

Alsted's approach influenced, among others, the [[pedagogue]] [[Johann Amos Comenius]] and the Hungarian encyclopedist [[Apáczai Csere János]] (1625–1659). Alsted's vision was that with the right methodologies of teaching and application, any person could have access to a perfect knowledge of all sciences.

'''Eshu''' ([[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]: '''Èṣù''', also known as '''Echú''', '''Exu''' or '''Exú''') is an [[Orisha]] in the [[Yoruba religion]] of the [[Yoruba people]] (originating from [[Yorubaland]], an area in and around present-day [[Nigeria]]). As the religion has spread around the world, the name of this Orisha has varied in different locations, but the beliefs remain similar.&lt;ref name="rar"&gt;[http://www.rootsandrooted.org/esu2.htm Names and worship of Esu]. Roots and Rooted. Retrieved 1 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and role==
Eshu partially serves as an alternate name for [[Elegua|Eleggua]], the messenger for all Orishas, and that there are 256 paths to Eleggua—each one of which is an Eshu. It is believed that Eshu is an Orisha similar to Elugga, but there are only 101 paths to Eshu according to ocha, rather than the 256 paths to Eleggua according to Ifá.&lt;ref name="Lele2010"/&gt; Eshu is known as the "Father who gave birth to Ogboni", and is also thought to be agile and always willing to rise to a challenge.&lt;ref name="P89"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert D. Pelton|title=The Trickster in West Africa: A Study of Mythic Irony and Sacred Delight|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|page=161|isbn=978-0-520-06791-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both ocha and Ifá share some paths, however. Eshu Ayé is said to work closely with Orisha [[Olokun]] and is thought to walk on the shore of the beach. Eshu Bi is a stern and forceful avatar, appearing as both an old man and young boy, who walked with Shangó and Oyá (the initial two Ibeyi), and Eshu Bi protects both of these, as well as all other small children. Eshu Laroye is an avatar believed to be the companion of Oshún and believed to be one of the most important Eshus, and the [[avatar]] of Eshu Laroye is thought to be talkative and small.&lt;ref name="Lele2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ócha'ni Lele|title=Teachings of the Santería Gods: The Spirit of the Odu|date=24 June 2010|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co|isbn=978-1-59477-908-4|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names==
The name of Eshu vary around the world: in [[Yorùbáland]], Eshu is ''Èṣù-Elegba''; ''Exu de Candomblé'' in [[Candomblé]]; ''Echú'' in [[Santería]] and Latin America; ''Legba'' in [[Haitian Vodou]]; ''Leba'' in [[Winti]]; ''Exu de Quimbanda'' in [[Quimbanda]]; ''Lubaniba'' in [[Palo (religion)|Palo Mayombe]]; and ''Exu'' in Latin America.&lt;ref name="rar"/&gt;

==Brazil==

Exu is known by various forms and names in Afro-Brazilian religions. They include Akessan; Alafiá; Alaketo; Bará, or Ibará; Elegbá, or Elegbará, Inan; Lalu, or Jelu; Laroiê; Lon Bií; Lonã; Odara; Olodé; Tamentau, or Etamitá; Tlriri; and Vira, a feminine manifestation of Exu. The most common forms or praise-names of Exu are Exu-Agbo, the protector and guardian of houses and terreiros; Exu-Elepô, the god of palm oil; Exu lnã, the god of fire; Exu Ojixé, a  messenger god.&lt;ref name="l"/&gt;

===Candomblé===

A shrine dedicated to Exu is located outside of the main [[terreiro]] of a Candomblé temple, usually near the entrance gate. It is, in general, made of rough clay or a simple mound of red clay. They are similar to those found in Nigeria.

Ritual foods offered to Exu include palm oil; beans; corn, either in the form of cornmeal or popcorn; farofa, a manioc flour. Four-legged male birds and other animals are offered as sacrifice to Exu. In each offering made to an orixá, a part of the food is separated and dedicated to Exu.&lt;ref name="l"/&gt;

==In culture==
Eshu is described as a "black devil-god" in the character list of [[Aimé Césaire]]'s ''[[Une Tempête]]'', and is mentioned briefly by the Master of Ceremonies in the Introduction. He appears as a bawdy trickster to foil the colonialist Prospero in Act 3, Scene 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aimé Césaire|title=Une Tempête|trans-title=A Tempest|url=https://firstyear.barnard.edu/shakespeare/tempest/tempete|translator1=Richard Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jamaican-Canadian [[Nalo Hopkinson]]'s 2000 [[science fiction]] novel [[Midnight Robber]], eshu is a name for the individual [[AI]] that runs each household in the far-future Cockpit County on the [[Garifuna people|Carib]]-colonized planet of Toussaint.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

'''''Ex parte McQuillon''''', 16 F. Cas. 347 (1861), was a case decided in August 1861 by [[United States district court]] for the southern district of New York involving a writ of [[habeas corpus]]. Judge Betts issued the writ for Purcell McQuillon, who was being held in military custody at [[Fort Lafayette]], but the commandant of the fort declined to bring McQuillon before the court as demanded, citing an order from Gen. [[Winfield Scott]]. Over the objection of McQuillon's attorney, Judge Betts took no further action on the case, declaring that it would be indecorous to openly disagree with [[Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Chief Justice]] [[Roger B. Taney|Taney's]] reasoning in ''[[ex parte Merryman]]'', but that the Constitution must be defended in whatever way it can be and the public would not want everyone to have access to habeas corpus during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

The '''Filmarchiv Austria''' ("Austrian Film Archive") is an organisation for the discovery, reconstruction and preservation of [[Austria]]n film record material: films themselves, literature about film and cinema, or film-related periodicals. With over 100,000 film titles, 2,000,000 photographs and stills, 25,000 cinema programmes, 10,000 film posters, 30,000 books, and an extensive collection of apparatus, documents and costumes, it is the largest such organisation in Austria.

Research is always in progress on particular topics in order to enlarge the film content, covering all genres from advertising footage to experimental projects to light entertainment films. Of all the existing Austrian productions in the world from before 1945, over 95% are kept in the Filmarchiv Austria.

The Filmarchiv Austria is a member of [[International Federation of Film Archives|FIAF]] (the International Federation of Film Archives).

== History ==
[[Image:Metro Kino Wien.JPG|thumb|Metro-Kino, Vienna, run by the Filmarchiv Austria for the showing of significant and historical Austrian films]]
The present Filmarchiv Austria was founded on 17 October 1955, as the '''Österreichische Filmarchiv''' (ÖFA) ("Austrian Film Archive").

The first reconstruction of film material by the ÖFA, in 1961, was the 1926 film version of ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]''. Other major reconstruction projects have included the first Austrian feature film productions, those of [[Saturn-Film]]; the oldest extant Austrian drama film, ''[[Der Müller und sein Kind]]'' of 1911; and the classics ''[[The Hands of Orlac (1924 film)|Orlacs Hände]]'' ("The Hands of Orlac") and ''[[Die Sklavenkönigin]]'' ("The Slave Queen" or "The Moon of Israel"), which without this work would have remained inaccessible to the viewing public.

The Filmarchiv Austria, together with ''[[Der Standard]]'', is also responsible for the selection and production of ''Der österreichische Film'', an authoritative DVD series of significant Austrian films, consisting so far of 50 parts. 

In 1965 a systematic programme began of conversion of film prints on the highly unstable [[cellulose nitrate]] base, which remained in commercial use into the 1950s, to security film. 

In 1968 new premises were found in the Rauhensteingasse in central [[Vienna]], while new storage and exhibition facilities were established in the ''Altes Schloss'' ("Old Castle"), [[Laxenburg castles|Laxenburg]]. In 1997 the ''Österreichische Filmarchiv'' changed its name to '''Filmarchiv Austria''', and established new central facilities at the ''Audiovisuelles Zentrum Wien-Augarten''.

In 2001 the ''Filmarchiv-Studienzentrum'' was opened in the [[Augarten]] premises, incorporating the ''Filmdokumentationszentrum'', formerly the largest private collection of film-related material in Austria, founded in 1965 by Herbert Holba and the film historian Peter Spiegel, on the basis of an earlier collection begin in 1945.

== Collections ==
[[Image:Saturn-Film 3nov1906.jpg|thumb|Advertisements for Saturn-Film productions, the earliest known Austrian feature films (Filmarchiv collection)]]
The collections of the Filmarchiv Austria comprehensively document Austrian cultural and social history. The oldest titles preserved are the sequences of Vienna taken by the [[Lumière Brothers]] in 1896. The oldest preserved native Austrian film is the documentary ''Der Kaiserbesuch in Braunau/Inn'' ("Visit of the Kaiser to Braunau am Inn") from 1903, shot by Johann Bläser, proprietor of a travelling film show, while the earliest extant Austrian feature films are the erotic productions of [[Saturn-Film]] from 1906 onwards.

Some of the more important collections include:
* the Goldstaub collection: a highly significant collection from the early days of the Austrian cinema, with extensive documentary footage from the time of the monarchy; 
* the Reinthaler collection: Austria's largest cinematic collection from the years 1910-20;
* the Köfinger collection: tourism films from the period of silent film;
* a number of collections of cine-newsreels from the 1930s;
* the archive of the major newsreel producer ''Austria Wochenschau'', acquired in 1997

'''Fiona Karen Ritchie''' [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born 1960) is a Scottish radio broadcaster best known as the producer and host of ''[[The Thistle &amp; Shamrock]]'', an hour-long [[Celtic music]] program that airs weekly throughout the United States on [[National Public Radio]] (NPR).  She also curates ThistleRadio, a 24/7 web-based music channel devoted to new and classic music from Celtic roots and is co-author of the ''[[New York Times]]'' Best Seller ''Wayfaring Strangers''.

The radio program has won numerous awards since its inception in 1981, offering a fusion of traditional and contemporary Celtic sounds, interwoven with interviews, in-studio performances and Ritchie's own trademark commentary in her "soft Scots" dialect.&lt;ref name="October 2007"&gt;{{cite web|title=Celtic Connections: A Visit to the Studio|url=http://thistleradio.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=182&amp;Itemid=94|work=The Scots Magazine, Oct 2007|publisher=D.C.Thomson &amp; Co.Ltd.|accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==
Ritchie was born and raised in Scotland, where she went to the [[University of Stirling]] for her undergraduate education. While there, she was invited to spend one semester in [[North Carolina]] in the United States, and that was when she first heard NPR.  After graduating in Scotland she returned to North Carolina and, although initially pursuing post-graduate research, was hired by [[WFAE]] FM, the NPR station in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], to oversee fundraising and promotion efforts.  In her early years, Ritchie guest hosted live radio shows featuring everything from [[Big Band]] to [[Classical music]], also producing and presenting many live concerts.

WFAE was a new station open to new ideas and in 1981 Ritchie began a weekly hour of [[Celtic music]] for its local audience.  ''The Thistle &amp; Shamrock'' was picked up for national broadcast less than two years after this debut.  The program's national following grew quickly and it was soon established as one of NPR's most widely heard and best-loved music offerings.  During her years based in North Carolina, Ritchie visited radio stations coast-to-coast across the US, presenting live broadcasts and events, and in 1989 and 1990, travelled to 22 US cities with The Thistle &amp; Shamrock Concert Tour.

== Return to Scotland ==
Fiona Ritchie has come full circle to re-settle and create her radio programs at home in Scotland.  On numerous return trips to the United States, she has visited and raised funds for NPR member stations everywhere from [[Louisiana]] to Alaska, and hosted festival concerts from [[Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts]] to Chicago's [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]]. Along the way she has forged a strong association with the United States, and made a unique contribution to the American airwaves.

In the UK, Fiona Ritchie has presented numerous programs for [[BBC Radio Scotland]] and [[BBC Radio 2]], launching the Radio Scotland world music series "Celtic Connections" in 1993.

'''George Paul Horse Capture''' (October 20, 1937 &amp;ndash; April 16, 2013) ([[A'aninin]]) was an [[anthropologist]], activist, and writer.

Horse Capture was one of the earlier [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] to be a museum [[curator]]. He was the first curator of the Plains Indian Museum in [[Cody, Wyoming]], and worked for a decade at the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], during planning for its new building on the Mall in Washington, DC. He was an enrolled member of the [[Fort Belknap Indian Community of the Fort Belknap Reservation of Montana]].

George Horse Capture was born into the [[Gros Ventre|A'aninin]] (Gros Ventre) in a [[log cabin]] in [[Fort Belknap Agency, Montana|Fort Belknap]], which is located in north-central [[Montana]], near [[Harlem, Montana|Harlem]]. He is an enrolled member of the tribe. As a child, he lived with his maternal grandmother and cousins on the reservation. When it came time for high school, he moved to [[Butte, Montana]], where he joined his mother. After graduating, he joined the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], serving as a [[shipfitter]] for four years.

After leaving the Navy, Horse Capture worked for five years as a [[welder]]'s helper, becoming a Steel Inspector for the [[California Department of Water Resources]]; he was "the only minority person at that time for the State of [[California]]."&lt;ref name = "indianz"&gt;{{Cite web

She was married to king [[Gjúki]], of [[Burgundy (historical region)|Burgundy]]. She had three sons, [[Gunnarr]], Hǫgni and Guttormr, and a daughter, [[Gudrun]]. She was the sorceress who gave [[Sigurðr]] a magic potion that made him forget that he ever married his wife [[Brynhildr]], so that he would marry Gudrun, her daughter. But she did not stop there. She wanted her son Gunnar to marry Brynhildr, but she refused to marry him, and she would only marry the man who could cross the ring of flames she put up around herself. So Grímhildr talked Sigurðr into helping Gunnarr marry Brynhildr.  Since Sigurðr was the only one who could cross the flames he and Gunnarr switched bodies, so Gunnar's body could cross the flames. Brynhildr then married Gunnar, because she made a promise. When Brynhildr learned that Sigurðr had betrayed her with another woman (Gudrun), not knowing he had been bewitched into doing so by Grímhild, she was out to get revenge. She ended up killing Sigurð and herself by the end of the saga. Grímhildr then made Gudrun marry Brynhild's brother Atli. Gudrun did not want to marry him because she knew he would end up killing her brothers. This is the last that we hear of Grímhild in the ''[[Völsunga saga]]''; it is probable that the ring's curse also brings misfortune and even death upon Grímhild herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jimmy Joe |url=http://www.timelessmyths.com/norse/witches.html#Grimhild |title=Witches |publisher=Timelessmyths.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The name was also given to another beautiful, evil sorceress woman who married king Áli of [[Alfheim]] (modern [[Bohuslän]]) in ''[[Illuga saga Gríðarfóstra]]''. She had seven daughters who too became terrible witches, while King Áli had a daughter before he married Grímhild, named Signý. Signý had a daughter with a king she had married but he died in battle, so she returned home to her father, with her daughter. Grímhildr poisoned the king to have a younger man, and then had ruled the kingdom in such an evil manner that it was laid waste. She then banned Signý and Hild, her daughter, from the kingdom and put a curse on them, that Signy would turn into a [[troll]] woman named Grid and they would have to live in a cave. Every man that came would fall in love with Hild, and then Signý/Grid would have to kill them, until one man is not afraid. In turn, Hildr put a counter-curse on Grímhild, that she would stand over a fire between her legs, burning her from below while her upper parts would freeze, and into this fire Grímhild would drop once their own curse was broken. Grímhild attempted to reason with Hild, as she would rather that neither of their curses hold, but to no avail as Hildr desired revenge.&lt;ref name=vuw/&gt; Eleven years and sixteen men later, a young Dane named Illugi broke Grímhild's curse by defeating and burning all of her daughters, thus also causing her to die at last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.germanicmythology.com/FORNALDARSAGAS/IlugaGridafostraSagaChappell.html |title=Fornaldarsögur Norðurlanda |publisher=Germanicmythology.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Gríms saga loðinkinna]]'', Grímhild was an evil wife of the North Norwegian lord, who had put a curse on her stepdaughter Lofthaena to turn her into an ugly troll. Lofthaena was rescued by a man who loved her, the saga's hero Grím, who than had Grímhild punished by being stoned to death.&lt;ref name=vuw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10063/988/thesis.pdf |format=PDF |title=Naomi Bennett : Peace Unwoven : Transgressive Women in Old Icelandic Heroic and Mythological Literature, and in Saxo Grammaticus’ Grammaticus’ Gesta Danorum |website=Researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz |accessdate=2016-05-11}}

He helped to establish the field of economic botany, and left a collection of research and published works in botany and pharmacology.&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Henry Hurd Rusby: The father of economic botany at the New York Botanical Garden | journal= Brittonia| volume = 44| issue=3| year= 1992| pages= 273–279| last= Williams| first= David E. |last2=Fraser| first2= Susan M.| doi=10.1007/bf02957813| url=https://zenodo.org/record/1232572/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined a series of expeditions from 1880 and 1921&lt;ref name="plants"/&gt; and in 1921, he led the [[Mulford Expedition]] to the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]].

==Biography==
Henry H. Rusby grew up in Franklin (today Nutley) New Jersey. He showed a passionate interest in plants. At 21, his herbarium won first prize at the [[Philadelphia Centennial Exposition]] in 1876.&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt; He came to meet Dr. [[George Thurber]] who was President of the [[Torrey Botanical Society|Torrey Botanical Club]]. Rusby joined the club in 1879, and by then studied medicine at the School of Medicine of New York University.

In 1880, still a medical student, he spent 18 months collecting plants in Texas and New Mexico for the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. In 1883 he returned to the southwest to study and collect medicinal flora of Arizona, for [[Parke-Davis]] &amp; Co.&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt;

In 1884, he graduated with his degree in medicine, and in the following year he embarked on a two-year expedition for Parke, Davis &amp; Co., crossing South America and exploring remote regions of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Brazil.&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt;

Although trained as a physician, Rusby chose to leave medicine for his interest in plants.&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt;

In 1889, he became Professor of Botany and Materia Medica at the School of Pharmacy at [[Columbia University]]. He was Dean of the Faculty for 26 years until his retirement in 1930, and Dean Emeritus until his death in 1940.&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt;

His association with [[New York Botanical Garden]] began even before the garden was formally created. As a member of Torrey Botanical Club, he encountered the celebrated botanist and taxonomist [[Nathaniel Lord Britton]]. Establishing a botanical garden was a goal for the Torrey Botanical Club. In 1888 a pro-Garden committee of Botany, with eight distinguished members of the club, including Britton and Rusby was formed. Rusby was instrumental in collaboration between the Herbarium School of Columbia, and the botanical Library at the New York Botanical Garden.&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt;

On January 26, 1898, Rusby was designated the "Honorary Curator of the Museum of Economic Botany.&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt;

His tropical explorations, particularly in the Amazon, provided materials for taxonomic studies and economic botany by the New York Botanical Garden. Productivity in these explorations was due to his strength and exploration skills.

In 1921, at age 65, he made his last trip to South America as Director of the "Mulford Biological Exploration of the Amazon Basin".&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt;

Rusby died on November 18, 1940, aged 85.

''Kamasutra'' is the oldest surviving Hindu text on erotic love.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xi, Quote: "The Kamasutra is the oldest extant Hindu textbook of erotic love."}} It is a ''sutra''-genre text with terse aphoristic verses that have survived into the modern era with different ''bhasya'' (exposition and commentaries). The text is a mix of prose and [[anustubh]]-meter poetry verses. The text acknowledges the Hindu concept of [[Purusharthas]], and lists desire, sexuality, and emotional fulfillment as one of the proper goals of life. Its chapters discuss methods for courtship, finding a partner, maintaining power in a married life, when and how to commit adultery, sexual positions, and other topics.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xi-xiii}} The majority of the book is about the philosophy and theory of love, what triggers desire, what sustains it, and how and when it is good or bad.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Daniélou, ''The Complete Kama Sutra: The First Unabridged Modern Translation of the Classic Indian Text'', {{ISBN|978-0892815258}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Levy (2010), Kama sense marketing, iUniverse, {{ISBN|978-1440195563}}, see Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

The text is one of many Indian texts on ''[[Kama Shastra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Flood (1996), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a much-translated work in Indian and non-Indian languages. The ''Kamasutra'' has influenced many secondary texts that followed after the 4th-century CE, as well as the Indian arts as exemplified by the pervasive presence Kama-related reliefs and sculpture in old [[Hindu temples]]. Of these, the [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]] is a UNESCO world heritage site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/240 Khajuraho Group of Monuments] UNESCO World Heritage Site&lt;/ref&gt; Among the surviving temples in north India, one in [[Rajasthan]] sculpts all the major chapters and sexual positions to illustrate the ''Kamasutra''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/d/019pho0001007s3u00660000.html Ramgarh temple], The British Library&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wendy Doniger, the ''Kamasutra'' became "one of the most pirated books in English language" soon after it was published in 1883 by Richard Burton. This first European edition by Burton does not faithfully reflect much in the ''Kamasutra'' because he revised the collaborative translation by Bhagavanlal Indrajit and Shivaram Parashuram Bhide with Forster Arbuthnot to suit 19th-century Victorian tastes.&lt;ref name="Doniger2016p9"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-049928-0|pages=155–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original composition date or century for the ''Kamasutra'' is unknown. Historians have variously placed it between 400 BCE and 300 CE.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Refractions of Desire, Feminist Perspectives in the Novels of Toni Morrison, Michèle Roberts, and Anita Desai|author=Sengupta, J.|date=2006|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors|isbn=9788126906291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V9Y_tQfm_WgC|page=21|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Keay]], the ''Kama Sutra'' is a compendium that was collected into its present form in the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India: A History: from the Earliest Civilisations to the Boom of the Twenty-first Century|pages=81–103|author=John Keay|publisher=Grove Press|year=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUPZt-4yqzQC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Indologist Wendy Doniger who has co-translated ''Kama sutra'' and published many papers on related Hindu texts, the surviving version of the ''Kamasutra'' must have been revised or composed after 225 CE because it mentions the Abhiras and the Andhras dynasties that did not co-rule major regions of ancient India before that year.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xi-xii with footnote 2}} The text makes no mention of the [[Gupta Empire]] which ruled over major urban areas of ancient India, reshaping ancient Indian arts, Hindu culture and economy from the 4th-century through the 6th-century. For these reasons, she dates the ''Kama sutra'' to the second half of the 3rd-century CE.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xi-xii with footnote 2}}

The place of its composition is also unclear. The likely candidates are urban centers of north or northwest ancient India, alternatively in the eastern urban Pataliputra (now [[Patna]]).{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xi-xii}} 

Vatsyayana Mallanaga is its widely accepted author because his name is embedded in the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] verse, but little is known about him.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xi-xii}} Vatsyayana states that he wrote the text after much meditation.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xii}} In the preface, Vatsyayana acknowledges that he is distilling many ancient texts, but these have not survived.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xii}} He cites the work of others he calls "teachers" and "scholars", and the longer texts by Auddalaki, Babhravya, Dattaka, Suvarnanabha, Ghotakamukha, Gonardiya, Gonikaputra, Charayana, and Kuchumara.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xii}} Vatsyayana's Kamasutra is mentioned and some verses quoted in the ''Brihatsamhita'' of Varahamihira, as well as the poems of Kalidasa. This suggests he lived before the 5th-century CE.{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=3-4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Varahamihira|author2=M Ramakrishna Bhat|title=Brhat Samhita of Varahamihira|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VR8iriWmzUC|year=1996|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1060-0|pages=720–721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu tradition has the concept of the ''[[Purusharthas]]'' which outlines "four main goals of life".&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flood (1996), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; It holds that every human being has four proper goals that are necessary and sufficient for a fulfilling and happy life:&lt;ref&gt;[a] A.

Each of these pursuits became a subject of study and led to prolific Sanskrit and some Prakrit languages literature in ancient India. Along with Dharmasastras, Arthasastras and Mokshasastras, the Kamasastras genre have been preserved in palm leaf manuscripts. The ''Kamasutra'' belongs to the Kamasastra genre of texts. Other examples of Hindu Sanskrit texts on sexuality and emotions include the ''Ratirahasya'' (called ''Kokashastra'' in some Indian scripts), the ''Anangaranga'', the ''Nagarasarvasva'' and the ''Panchasayaka''.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xii-xiii}}&lt;ref&gt;[a] {{cite journal|title= Rethinking the History of the "Kāma" World in Early India| author= Daud Ali| journal= Journal of Indian Philosophy| volume= 39| number= 1|year= 2011| pages= 1-13| jstor=23884104}};&lt;br&gt;[b] {{cite journal| title= Padmaśrī's "Nāgarasarvasva" and the World of Medieval Kāmaśāstra|author= Daud Ali| journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy| volume= 39| number= 1| year= 2011| pages= 41-62| jstor= 23884106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vatsyayana predominantly discusses Kama along with its relationship with Dharma and Artha. He makes a passing mention of the fourth aim of life in some verses.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002 |pp=xi-xvi}}

===Vedic heritage===
The earliest foundations of the ''kamasutra'' are found in the [[Vedic era]] literature of Hinduism.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002 |pp=xiv with footnote 8}}&lt;ref name="De1969p89"/&gt; Vatsyayana acknowledges this heritage in verse 1.1.9 of the text where he names Shvetaketu Auddalaki as the "first human author of the ''kamasutra''". Auddalaki is an early Upanishadic [[rishi]] (scholar-poet, sage), whose ideas are found in the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'' such as in section 6.2, and the ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' such as over the verses 5.3 through 5.10.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002 |pp=xiv with footnote 8}} These Hindu scriptures are variously dated between 900 BCE and 700 BCE, according to the Indologist and Sanskrit scholar Patrick Olivelle. Among with other ideas such as [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (self, soul) and the ontological concept of [[Brahman]], these early Upanishads discuss human life, activities and the nature of existence as a form of internalized worship, where sexuality and sex is mapped into a form of religious ''[[yajna]]'' ritual (sacrificial fire, [[Agni]]) and suffused in spiritual terms:{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002 |pp=xiv with footnote 8}}

According to the Indologist De, a view with which Doniger agrees, this is one of the many evidences that the ''kamasutra'' began in the religious literature of the Vedic era, ideas that were ultimately refined and distilled into a ''sutra''-genre text by Vatsyayana.&lt;ref name="De1969p89"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sushil Kumar De|title=Ancient Indian Erotics and Erotic Literature|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NdiHngEACAAJ|year= 1969|publisher= K.L.

===Epics===
Human relationships, sex and emotional fulfillment are a significant part of the post-Vedic Sanskrit literature such as the major Hindu epics: the ''Mahabharata'' and the ''Ramayana''. The ancient Indian view has been, states Johann Meyer, that love and sex are a delightful necessity. Though she is reserved and selective, "a woman stands in very great need of ''surata'' (amorous or sexual pleasure)", and "the woman has a far stronger erotic disposition, her delight is the sexual act is greater than a man's".&lt;ref name="Meyer1953p229"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johann Jakob Meyer|title=Sexual Life in Ancient India: A Study in the Comparative History of Indian Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=izFNswlJ9LMC|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Orig: 1953)|isbn=978-81-208-0638-2|pages=229–230, 240–244, context: 229–257 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==
The ''Kamasutra'' manuscripts have survived in many versions across the Indian subcontinent. While attempting to get a translation of the Sanskrit kama-sastra text ''Anangaranga'' that had already been in widely translated by the Hindus in regional languages such as Marathi, associates of the British Orientalist Richard Burton stumbled into portions of the ''Kamasutra'' manuscript. They commissioned the Sanskrit scholar Bhagvanlal Indraji to locate a complete ''Kamasutra'' manuscript and translate it. Indraji collected variant manuscripts in libraries and temples of Varanasi, Kolkata and Jaipur. Burton published an edited English translation of these manuscripts, but not a [[critical edition]] of the ''Kamasutra'' in Sanskrit.{{sfn|Jyoti Puri|2002|pp=614–615}}

According to S.C. Upadhyaya, known for his 1961 scholarly study and a more accurate translation of the ''Kamasutra'', there are issues with the manuscripts that have survived and the text likely underwent revisions over time.&lt;ref name=Upadhyaya1961p52&gt;{{cite book| title= Kama sutra of Vatsyayana Complete translation from the original Sanskrit| author1=Vatsyayana| author2= SC Upadhyaya (transl)| year=1965 | publisher= DB Taraporevala (Orig publication year: 1961) | oclc=150688197|pages=52-54}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is confirmed by other 1st-millennium CE Hindu texts on ''kama'' that mention and cite the ''Kamasutra'', but some of these quotations credited to the ''Kamasutra'' by these historic authors "are not to be found in the text of the Kamasutra" that have survived.&lt;ref name=Upadhyaya1961p52/&gt;{{sfn|Jyoti Puri|2002|pp=623–624}}

== Contents ==
Vatsyayana's ''Kama Sutra'' states it has 1250 verses, distributed over 36 chapters in 64 sections, organised into 7 books.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xxii}} This statement is included in the opening chapter of the text, a common practice in ancient Hindu texts likely included to prevent major and unauthorized expansions of a popular text.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xxii-xxiii with footnotes}} The text that has survived into the modern era has 67 sections, and this list is enumerated in Book 7 and in Yashodhara's Sanskrit commentary (''[[bhasya]]'') on the text.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xxii-xxiii with footnotes}}

The contents of the treatise explicitly aim to be comprehensive, including everything "good or bad" in Vatsyayana's view. The text does not censor a view or lifestyle, but Vatsyayana does include his own comments on what he approves and disapproves of. He also, states Doniger, remarks that "reflective people should accept only the good".{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xxi}}

The ''Kamasutra'' uses a mixture of prose and poetry, and the narration has the form of a dramatic fiction where two characters are called the ''nayaka'' (man) and ''nayika'' (woman), aided by the characters called ''pitamarda'' (libertine), ''vita'' (pander) and ''vidushaka'' (jester). This format follows the teachings found in the Sanskrit classic named the ''[[Natyasastra]]''.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xxv-xxvi with footnotes}} The teachings and discussions found in the ''Kamasutra'' extensively incorporate ancient Hindu mythology and legends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|editor=H.

Across human cultures, states Michel Foucault, "the truth of sex" has been produced and shared by two processes. One method has been ''ars erotica'' texts, while the other has been the ''scientia sexualis'' literature. The first are typically of the hidden variety and shared by one person to another, between friends or from a master to a student, focusing on the emotions and experience, sans physiology. These bury many of the truths about sex and human sexual nature.&lt;ref name="Foucault2012p57"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michel Foucault|title=The History of Sexuality: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwkYO9KveeEC|year=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|isbn=978-0-307-81928-4|pages=57–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002|pp=xv–xvii}} The second are empirical studies of the type found in biology, physiology and medical texts, focusing on the physiology and objective observations, sans emotions.&lt;ref name="Foucault2012p57"/&gt;{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002|pp=xv–xvii}} The ''Kamasutra'' belongs to both camps, states Wendy Doniger. It discusses, in its distilled form, the physiology, the emotions and the experience while citing and quoting prior Sanskrit scholarship on the nature of ''kama''.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002|pp=xv–xvii}}

The ''Kamasutra'' is a "[[sutra]]"-genre text consisting of intensely condensed, aphoristic verses. Doniger describes them as a "kind of atomic string (thread) of meanings", which are so cryptic that any translation is more like deciphering and filling in the text.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002|pp=xv–xvii}} Condensing a text into a sutra-genre religious text form makes it easier to remember and transmit, but it also introduces ambiguity and the need to understand the context of each chapter, its philological roots, as well as the prior literature, states Doniger.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002|pp=xv–xvii}} However, this method of knowledge preservation and transmission has its foundation in the Vedas, which themselves are cryptic and require a commentator and teacher-guide to comprehend the details and the inter-relationship of the ideas.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002|pp=xv–xvii}}{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=5-6}} The ''Kamasutra'' too has attracted commentaries, of which the most well known are those of 12th-century{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=5-6}} or 13th-century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-049928-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yaśodhara's ''Jayamaṅgalā'' in the Sanskrit language, and of Devadatta Shastri who commented on the original text as well as its commentaries in the Hindi language.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002|pp=xv–xvii}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Albrecht Wezler|editor1=Madhav Deshpande|editor2=Peter Edwin Hook|title=Indian Linguistic Studies: Festschrift in Honor of George Cardona|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVR0rGVQ8ecC |year=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1885-9|pages=316–322 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many other Sanskrit commentaries on the ''Kamasutra'', such as the ''Sutra Vritti'' by Narsingha Sastri.{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=5-6}} These commentaries on the ''Kamasutra'' cite and quote text from other Hindu texts such as the ''Upanishads'', the ''Arthashastra'', the ''Natyashastra'', the ''Manusmriti'', the ''Nyayasutra'', the ''Markandeya Purana'', the ''Mahabharata'', the ''Nitishastra'' and others to provide the context, per the norms of its literary traditions.{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=11-12}} The extant translations of the ''Kamasutra'' typically incorporate these commentaries, states Daniélou.{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=6-12}}

In the colonial era marked by sexual censorship, the ''Kamasutra'' became famous as a pirated and underground text for its explicit description of sex positions. The stereotypical image of the text is one where erotic pursuit with sexual intercourse include improbable contortionist forms.&lt;ref name=doniger2016p20/&gt; In reality, according to Doniger, the ''real Kamasutra'' is much more and is a book about "the art of living", about understanding one's body and a partner's body, finding a partner and emotional connection, marriage, the power equation over time in intimate relationships, the nature of adultery and drugs (aphrodisiacs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ|year= 2016 |publisher =Oxford University Press |isbn= 978-0-19-049928-0|page= 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;) along with many simple to complex variations in sex positions to explore. It is also a psychological treatise that presents the effect of desire and pleasure on human behavior.&lt;ref name=doniger2016p20&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ|year=2016 |publisher =Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-049928-0|pages=20-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For each aspect of ''Kama'', the ''Kamasutra'' presents a diverse spectrum of options and regional practices. According to Shastri, as quoted by Doniger, the text analyses "the inclinations of men, good and bad", thereafter it presents Vatsyayana's recommendation and arguments of what one must avoid as well as what to not miss in experiencing and enjoying, with "acting only on the good".{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002|pp=xx–xxi}} For example, the text discusses adultery but recommends a faithful spousal relationship.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002|pp=xx–xxi}}&lt;ref name=doniger2016p14&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-049928-0|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of ''Kamasutra'' is not to ignore nor deny the psychology and complexity of human behavior for pleasure and sex. The text, according to Doniger, clearly states "that a treatise demands the inclusion of everything, good or bad", but after being informed with in depth knowledge, one must "reflect and accept only the good". The approach found in the text is one where goals of science and religion should not be to repress, but to encyclopedically know and understand, thereafter let the individual make the choice.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002|pp=xx–xxi}}

The 3rd-century text includes a number of themes, including subjects such as flirting that resonate in the modern era context, states a ''New York Times'' review.&lt;ref name=nytimes2002kamasutra/&gt; For example, it suggests that a young man seeking to attract a woman, should hold a party, and invite the guests to recite poetry. In the party, a poem should be read with parts missing, and the guests should compete to provide the complete the verse.&lt;ref name=nytimes2002kamasutra/&gt; As another example, the ''Kamasutra'' suggests that the boy and the girl should go play together such as swim in a river. The boy should dive into the water away from the girl he is interested in, then swim underwater to get close to her, emerge out of the water and surprise her, touch her slightly and then dive again, away from her.&lt;ref name=nytimes2002kamasutra/&gt;

===Adultery===
The ''Kamasutra'', states the Indologist and Sanskrit literature scholar [[Ludo Rocher]], discourages adultery but then devotes "not less than fifteen sutras (1.5.6–20) to enumerating the reasons (''karana'') for which a man is allowed to seduce a married woman". Vatsyayana mentions different types of ''nayikas'' (urban girls) such as unmarried virgins, those married and abandoned by husband, widow seeking remarriage and courtesans, then discusses their kama/sexual education, rights and mores.&lt;ref name="Rocher1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rocher|first1=Ludo|title=The Kāmasūtra: Vātsyāyana's Attitude toward Dharma and Dharmaśāstra|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=105|issue=3| year=1985|pages= 521|doi=10.2307/601526}}&lt;/ref&gt; In childhood, [[Vātsyāyana]] says, a person should learn how to make a living; youth is the time for pleasure, and as years pass, one should concentrate on living virtuously and hope to escape the cycle of rebirth.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

According to Doniger, the ''Kamasutra'' teaches adulterous sexual liaison as a means for a man to predispose the involved woman in assisting him, as a strategic means to work against his enemies and to facilitate his successes. It also explains the signs and reasons a woman wants to enter into an adulterous relationship and when she does not want to commit adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|editor=Ariel Glucklich|title=The Sense of Adharma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d6bsOfvySvMC |year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-802448-4|pages=170–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Kamasutra'' teaches strategies to engage in adulterous relationships, but concludes its chapter on sexual liaison stating that one should not commit adultery because adultery pleases only one of two sides in a marriage, hurts the other, it goes against both ''dharma'' and ''artha''.&lt;ref name=doniger2016p14/&gt;

===Caste, class===
The ''Kamasutra'' has been one of the unique sources of sociological information and cultural milieu of ancient India. It shows a "near total disregard of class (varna) and caste (jati)", states Doniger.&lt;ref name=Doniger2016p21/&gt; Human relationships, including the sexual type, are neither segregated nor repressed by gender or caste, rather linked to individual's wealth (success in ''[[artha]]''). In the pages of the ''Kamasutra'', lovers are "not upper-class" but they "must be rich" enough to dress well, pursue social leisure activities, buy gifts and surprise the lover. In the rare mention of caste found in the text, it is about a man finding his legal wife and the advice that humorous stories to seduce a woman should be about "other virgins of same ''jati'' (caste)". In general, the text describes sexual activity between men and women across class and caste, both in urban and rural settings.&lt;ref name=Doniger2016p21&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-049928-0|pages=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Same-sex relationships===
The ''Kamasutra'' includes verses describing homosexual relations such as oral sex between two men, as well as between two women.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002 |pp=xxxiv-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=9-10}} Lesbian relations are extensively covered in Chapters 5 and 8 in Book 2 of the text.{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=169-177}}

According to Doniger, the ''Kamasutra'' discusses same-sex relationships through the notion of the ''tritiya prakriti'', literally, "third sexuality" or "third nature". In ''Redeeming the Kamasutra,'' Doniger states that "the Kamasutra departs from the dharmic view of homosexuality in significant ways", where the term ''kliba'' appears. In contemporary translations, this has been inaccurately rendered as "eunuch" – or, a castrated man in a harem, a practice that started in India after the arrival of Turkish Sultans.&lt;ref name="Doniger2016p114"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-049928-0|pages=114–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanskrit word ''Kliba'' found in older Indian texts refers to a "man who does not act like a man", typically in a pejorative sense. The ''Kamasutra'' does not use the pejorative term ''kliba'' at all, but speaks instead of a "third nature" or, in the sexual behavior context as the "third sexuality".&lt;ref name="Doniger2016p114"/&gt; 

The text states that there are two sorts of "third nature", one where a man behaves like a woman, and in the other, a woman behaves like a man. In one of the longest consecutive sets of verses describing a sexual act, the ''Kamasutra'' describes fellatio technique between a man dressed like a woman performing fellatio on another man.&lt;ref name="Doniger2016p114"/&gt; The text also mentions same-sex behavior between two women, such as a girl losing her virginity with a girlfriend as they use their fingers,&lt;ref name="Doniger2016p120"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-049928-0|pages=120–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as oral sex and the use of sex toys between women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Davesh Soneji|editor=Yudit Kornberg Greenberg|title=Encyclopedia of Love in World Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGoag6b3JvYC |year=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-980-1|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Svairini'', a term Danielou translates as a lesbian,{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=48, 171-172}} is described in the text as a woman who lives a conjugal life with another woman or by herself fending for herself, not interested in a husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=P.P.

The historical records suggest that the ''Kamasutra'' was a well-known and popular text in Indian history, states [[Wendy Doniger]]. This popularity through the [[Mughal Empire]] era is confirmed by its regional translations. The Mughals, states Doniger, had "commissioned lavishly illustrated Persian and Sanskrit ''Kamasutra'' manuscripts".&lt;ref name="Doniger2016p12"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-049928-0|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first English translation of the ''Kama Sutra'' was privately printed in 1883 by the Orientalist Sir [[Richard Francis Burton]]. He did not translate it, but did edit it to suit the Victorian British attitudes. The unedited translation was produced by the Indian scholar [[Bhagwan Lal Indraji]] with the assistance of a student Shivaram Parshuram Bhide, under the guidance of Burton's friend, the Indian civil servant [[Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot]].&lt;ref&gt;McConnachie (2007), pp. 123–125.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wendy Doniger, the Burton version is a "flawed English translation" but influential as modern translators and abridged versions of ''Kamasutra'' even in the Indian languages such as Hindi are re-translations of the Burton version, rather than the original Sanskrit manuscript.&lt;ref name="Doniger2018p164"&gt;[a] [https://lithub.com/redeeming-the-kamasutra/ Sir Richard Burton’s Version of the Kamasutra], Wendy Doniger, ''Literary Hub'' (March 11, 2016);&lt;br&gt;[b] {{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Against Dharma: Dissent in the Ancient Indian Sciences of Sex and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZBNDwAAQBAJ |year=2018|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-21619-6|pages=164–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Burton version of the ''Kamasutra'' was produced in an environment where Victorian mindset and Protestant proselytizers were busy finding faults and attacking Hinduism and its culture, rejecting as "filthy paganism" anything sensuous and sexual in Hindu arts and literature. The "Hindus were cowering under their scorn", states Doniger, and the open discussion of sex in the ''Kamasutra'' scandalized the 19th-century Europeans.&lt;ref name="Doniger2018p164"/&gt; The Burton edition of the ''Kamasutra'' was illegal to publish in England and the United States till 1962. Yet, states Doniger, it became soon after its publication in 1883, "one of the most pirated books in the English language", widely copied, reprinted and republished sometimes without Richard Burton's name.&lt;ref name="Doniger2018p164"/&gt;

Burton made two important contributions to the ''Kamasutra''. First, he had the courage to publish it in the colonial era against the political and cultural mores of the British elite. He creatively found a way to subvert the then prevalent censorship laws of Britain under the Obscene Publications Act of 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= Translating/'The' "Kama Sutra"| author= Ben Grant|journal = Third World Quarterly| volume= 26|number= 3| year= 2005| pages= 509-510| publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|jstor=  3993841}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doniger2018p164"/&gt; Burton created a fake publishing house named ''The Kama Shastra Society of London and Benares'' (Benares = [[Varanasi]]), with the declaration that it is "for private circulation only".&lt;ref name="Doniger2018p164"/&gt; The second major contribution was to edit it in a major way, by changing words and rewriting sections to make it more acceptable to the general British public. For example, the original Sanskrit ''Kamasutra'' does not use the words [[lingam]] or [[yoni]] for sexual organs, and almost always uses other terms. Burton adroitly avoided been viewed as obscene to the Victorian mindset by avoiding the use of words such as penis, vulva, vagina and other direct or indirect sexual terms in the Sanskrit text to discuss sex, sexual relationships and human sexual positions. Burton used the terms lingam and yoni instead throughout the translation.&lt;ref name=doniger2011p500/&gt; This conscious and incorrect word substitution, states Doniger, thus served as an Orientalist means to "anthropologize sex, distance it, make it safe for English readers by assuring them, or pretending to assure them, that the text was not about real sexual organs, their sexual organs, but merely about the appendages of weird, dark people far away."&lt;ref name=doniger2011p500&gt;{{cite journal|author =Wendy Doniger| title= God's Body, or, The Lingam Made Flesh: Conflicts over the Representation of the Sexual Body of the Hindu God Shiva| journal= Social Research|volume =78| number=2|year= 2011|publisher=  The Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=499-505|jstor=23347187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Burton used the terms [[lingam]] and [[yoni]] for human sexual organs, terms that actually mean a lot more in Sanskrit texts and its meaning depends on the context. However, Burton's ''Kamasutra'' gave a unique, specific meaning to these words in the western imagination.&lt;ref name=doniger2011p500/&gt; 

The problems with Burton mistranslation are many, states Doniger. First, the text "simply does not say what Burton says it says".&lt;ref name="Doniger2018p164"/&gt; Second, it "robs women of their voices, turning direct quotes into indirect quotes, thus losing the force of the dialogue that animates the work and erasing the vivid presence of the many women who speak in the Kamasutra". Third, it changes the force of words in the original text. For example, when a woman says "Stop!" or "Let me go!" in the original text of Vatsyayana, Burton changed it to "She continually utters words expressive of prohibition, sufficiency, or desire of liberation", states Doniger, and thus misconstrues the context and intent of the original text.&lt;ref name="Doniger2018p164"/&gt; Similarly, while the original ''Kamasutra'' acknowledges that "women have strong privileges", Burton erased these passages and thus eroded women's agency in ancient India in the typical Orientialist manner that dehumanized the Indian culture.&lt;ref name="Doniger2018p164"/&gt;&lt;ref name=doniger2011p500/&gt; David Shulman, a professor of Indian Studies and Comparative Religion, agrees with Doniger that the Burton translation is misguided and flawed.&lt;ref name=nytimes2002kamasutra/&gt; The Burton version was written with a different mindset, one that treated "sexual matters with Victorian squeamishness and a pornographic delight in the indirect", according to Shulman. It has led to a misunderstanding of the text and created the wrong impression of it being ancient "Hindu pornography".&lt;ref name=nytimes2002kamasutra/&gt;

In 1961, S. C. Upadhyaya published his translation as the ''Kamasutra of Vatsyayana: Complete Translation from the Original''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Kama sutra of Vatsyayana Complete translation from the original Sanskrit| author1=Vatsyayana| author2= SC Upadhyaya (transl)| year=1965 | publisher= DB Taraporevala (Orig publication year: 1961) | oclc=150688197}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jyoti Puri, it is considered among the best-known scholarly English-language translations of the ''Kamasutra'' in post-independent India.{{sfn|Jyoti Puri|2002|p=607}}

Other translations include those by [[Alain Daniélou]] (''The Complete Kama Sutra'' in 1994)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alaindanielou.org/The-Complete-Kama-Sutra.html ''The Complete Kama Sutra''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506045738/http://www.alaindanielou.org/The-Complete-Kama-Sutra.html |date=6 May 2008 }} by Alain Daniélou.&lt;/ref&gt; This translation, originally into French, and thence into English, featured the original text attributed to [[Vātsyāyana|Vatsyayana]], along with a medieval and a modern commentary.{{sfn|Daniélou|1993}} Unlike the 1883 version, Daniélou's new translation preserves the numbered verse divisions of the original, and does not incorporate notes in the text. He includes English translations of two important commentaries, one by Jayamangala commentary, and a more modern commentary by Devadatta Shastri, as [[endnote]]s.{{sfn|Daniélou|1993}} Wendy Doniger questions the accuracy of Daniélou's translation, stating that he has freely reinterpreted the ''Kamasutra'' while disregarding the gender that is implicit in the Sanskrit words. He, at times, reverses the object and subject, making the woman the subject and man the object when the ''Kamasutra'' is explicitly stating the reverse. According to Doniger,  "even this cryptic text [''Kamasutra''] is not infinitely elastic" and such creative reinterpretations do not reflect the text.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xxxvi-xxxvii with footnotes}}

A translation by [[Indra Sinha]] was published in 1980. In the early 1990s, its chapter on sexual positions began circulating on the internet as an independent text and today is often assumed to be the whole of the ''Kama Sutra''.&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wendy Doniger and Sudhir Kakar published another translation in 2002.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002}} Along with the translation, Doniger has published numerous articles and book chapters relating to the ''Kamasutra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-049928-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the Kamasutra|author=Wendy Doniger| journal= Daedalus| volume= 131| number=2|year= 2002|publisher=The MIT Press|pages=   126-129|jstor=20027767}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|editor=Ariel Glucklich|title=The Sense of Adharma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d6bsOfvySvMC&amp;pg=PA169|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-802448-4|pages=169–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Doniger translation and ''Kamasutra''-related literature has both been praised and criticized. According to David Shulman, the Doniger translation "will change peoples' understanding of this book and of ancient India. Previous translations are hopelessly outdated, inadequate and misguided".&lt;ref name=nytimes2002kamasutra&gt;{{cite news|author= Dinitia Smith| title=A New Kama Sutra Without Victorian Veils|publisher=The New York Times|date=May 4, 2002|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/04/books/a-new-kama-sutra-without-victorian-veils.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narasingha Sil calls the Doniger's work as "another signature work of translation and exegesis of the much misunderstood and abused Hindu erotology". Her translation has the folksy, "twinkle prose", engaging style, and an original translation of the Sanskrit text. However, adds Sil, Doniger's work mixes her postmodern translation and interpretation of the text with her own "political and polemical" views. She makes sweeping generalizations and flippant insertions that are neither supported by the original text nor the weight of evidence in other related ancient and later Indian literature such as from the Bengal Renaissance movement – one of the scholarly specialty of Narasingha Sil. Doniger's presentation style titillates, yet some details misinform and parts of her interpretations are dubious, states Sil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Narasingha P.

==Reception==
{{Quote box
 |quote  = '''On sexual embraces'''
&lt;poem&gt;
Some sexual embraces, not in this text,
also intensify passion;
these, too, may be used for love-making,
but only with care.
The territory of the text extends
only so far as men have dull appetites;
but when the wheel of sexual ecstasy is in full motion,
there is no textbook at all, and no order.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Indira Kapoor, a director of the International Planned Parenthood Foundation, states that the ''Kamasutra'' is a treatise on human sexual behavior and an ancient attempt to seriously study sexuality among other things. According to Kapoor, quotes Jyoti Puri, the attitude of contemporary Indians is markedly different, with misconceptions and expressions of embarrassment, rather than curiosity and pride, when faced with texts such as ''Kamasutra'' and amorous and erotic arts found in Hindu temples.{{sfn|Jyoti Puri|2002|p=605}} ''Kamasutra'', states Kapoor, must be viewed as a means to discover and improve the "self-confidence and understanding of their bodies and feelings".{{sfn|Jyoti Puri|2002|p=605}}

The ''Kamasutra'' has been a popular reference to erotic ancient literature. In the Western media, such as in the American women's magazine ''[[Redbook]]'', the Kamasutra is described as "Although it was written centuries ago, there's still no better sex handbook, which details hundreds of positions, each offering a subtle variation in pleasure to men and women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Lamar Graham|year=1995| title= A Love Map to His Body|journal = Redbook|issue=May|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jyoti Puri, who has published a review and feminist critique of the text, states that the "''Kamasutra'' is frequently appropriated as indisputable evidence of a non-Western and tolerant, indeed celebratory, view of sexuality" and for "the belief that the ''Kamasutra'' provides a transparent glimpse into the positive, even exalted, view of sexuality".{{sfn|Jyoti Puri|2002|pp=604, 606–608}} However, according to Puri, this is a colonial and anticolonial modernist interpretation of the text. These narratives neither resonate with nor provide the "politics of gender, race, nationality and class" in ancient India published by other historians and that may have been prevalent then.{{sfn|Jyoti Puri|2002|pp=633-634}}

According to Wendy Doniger, the ''Kamasutra'' is a "great cultural masterpiece", one which can inspire contemporary Indians to overcome "self-doubts and rejoice" in their ancient heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-049928-0|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Interiorlake-tyson.jpg|thumb|]]
The '''Lake–Tysen House''' is a spacious farmhouse with Dutch and Flemish architectural details. It was built by Joseph Guyon on his farmstead in [[Oakwood, Staten Island]] in the United States. Most of its original interior woodwork, including both Georgian and Federal styles of paneling remains intact. Based on the style and proportions of the house, it would be considered a middle-to-upper-class dwelling. The Lake family owned several slaves, who may have been housed in the rooms above the kitchen. The building was acquired by [[Historic Richmond Town]], a [[living history museum]], in 1962, and transported from Oakwood during July 9–12, 1962. The building was restored before it was opened to the public on October, 1963. Full restoration was completed in the 1970s.

==Construction==
The main portion of the house was built circa 1740, while the kitchen addition was rebuilt circa 1820.
The building was constructed from a wood frame, using the bent system. It is one and a half stories tall. There is a cellar under the two main rooms and front hall.
The cellar walls are made with rubble stone, while the first floor rooms and front hallways are mud and straw filled with a flaster coat. The flooring, panelling, mouldings, and doors are all pine.

==Original location==
The Lake–Tysen House originally sat on a plot of 115 acres of land. The original location was 750 feet south of [[Hylan Boulevard]], 100 feet West of Tysens Lane, in [[Oakwood, Staten Island]].
This area is significant as it was a large, fertile farm plot which spread from the shore line to road which allowed for two point of transport and trade.

Prior to the Lake–Tysen House at this location, the land was originally patented to Hanse Laurense circa 1677. By 1723, the land was owned by James Hanse Dye. Any structure had been destroyed, but there was evidence found of its existence nearby the kitchen area.

==Museum interpretation==
The building features several rooms, furnished for interpretation of different time periods that range from the mid-18th century to the late 19th century. When [[Historic Richmond Town]] is open with [[living history]] demonstrations, the interpretation is mostly daily farm life circa 1820.

==Inhabitants and their occupations==

'''''Life in Hell''''' is a [[comic strip]] by [[Matt Groening]], creator of ''[[The Simpsons|The Simpsons,]]'' ''[[Disenchantment]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]'', which was published weekly from 1977 to 2012. The strip features [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] rabbits and a [[gay]] couple. The comic covers a wide range of subjects, such as love, sex, work, and death, and explores themes of angst, social alienation, self-loathing, and fear of inevitable doom.

==History==
[[File:Matt Groening by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|[[Matt Groening]] created ''Life in Hell'' to describe life in Los Angeles to his friends.]]
''Life in Hell'' started in 1977 as a [[self-publishing|self-published]] comic book Groening used to describe life in Los Angeles to his friends.&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt; It was inspired by his move to the city that year; in an interview with ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'', Groening commented on his arrival: "I got [to Los Angeles] on a Friday night in August; it was about a hundred and two degrees; my car broke down in the fast lane of the [[Hollywood Freeway]] while I was listening to a drunken DJ who was giving his last program on a local rock station and bitterly denouncing the station's management. And then I had a series of lousy jobs."&lt;ref name=Ortved&gt;{{cite book|last=Ortved|first=John|title=The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History |chapter=The Matt Groening Show|year=2009|publisher=Greystone Books|isbn=978-1-55365-503-9|pages=11–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the comic book, Groening attacked what many young adults found repellent: school, work, and love. He described it as "every ex-campus protester's, every Boomer idealist's, conception of what adult existence in the '80s had turned out to be."&lt;ref name=Ortved/&gt;

Groening photocopied and distributed the magazines to friends, and also sold them for two dollars a copy&lt;ref name=Ortved/&gt; at the [[punk subculture|punk]] corner of the record store in which he worked, Licorice Pizza on [[Sunset Boulevard]].&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Matt Groening |work=[[Salon.com]] |url=http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2001/01/30/groening/index.html |last=Chocano |first=Carina |date=2001-01-30 |accessdate=January 14, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204032744/http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2001/01/30/groening/index.html |archivedate=February 4, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These magazines contained comic strips, comedy sketches, letters, and photo collages. The magazine covers were humorous as well: the first issue saw Binky standing in a cloud of smog and declaring, “What you see is what you breathe.” Groening also worked real photos into the covers, such as drawings from [[Jules Verne]]’s books or a picture of his family’s living room.

An editor from [[Wet (magazine)]] bought one of the zines and liked it, and offered Matt Groening a spot in the magazine, soon after ''Life in Hell'' debuted as a [[comic strip]] in the avant-garde [[Wet (magazine)|''Wet'' magazine]] in 1978, to which Groening made his first professional cartoon sale. The first strip, entitled "Forbidden Words", appeared in the September/October issue.&lt;ref name="bigbook" /&gt; Popular in the [[underground comix|underground]], ''Life in Hell'' was picked up by the ''[[Los Angeles Reader]]'' (an alternative weekly newspaper where Groening also worked as a typesetter, editor, paste-up artist and music critic) in 1980, where it began appearing weekly.&lt;ref name="bigbook"&gt;{{cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |authorlink=Matt Groening |chapter=About the Author |title=The Big Book of Hell |year=1990 |publisher=Pantheon Books |location=New York |isbn=0-679-72759-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-publisher of the ''Reader'' Jane Levine said Groening arrived at editor-in-chief James Vowell's office one day, showing him his "silly cartoons with the rabbit with one ear." After Groening left, Vowell came out of his office saying, "This guy is gonna be famous someday."&lt;ref name="Ortved" /&gt;

The character designs for Akbar and Jeff were in fact failed attempts by Groening to draw [[Charlie Brown]] from ''[[Peanuts]]'', which is why the two characters wear Charlie Brown T-shirts. In a 1999 interview, Groening said that he added Akbar and Jeff as characters to the comic to appease his girlfriend. Early in the comic, he used Binky and his wife to mirror the arguments he had with her, and she grew irritated with Groening because she felt he was portraying her as worse than himself. The addition of the twin-like Akbar and Jeff was meant to act as a mask of anonymity to hide who was who in the arguments. According to Groening, however, she still told him, “You think you’re Akbar, but you’re really Jeff.”

In a 1991 interview about ''The Simpsons'', Groening said that ''Life in Hell'' was done entirely by himself (“Matt Groening pure and simple”) and that the strips were often weird or entirely different every week because of however he was feeling at the time of the comic. 

The strip was frequently a [[Serial (literature)|serial]], discussing various topics such as "Love is Hell", a 1984 "13-chapter miniseries" pontificating on love and relationships. In November of that year, Groening's then-girlfriend (and co-worker at the ''Reader'') Deborah Caplan offered to publish "Love is Hell" in book form.&lt;ref name="loveishell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |authorlink=Matt Groening |coauthors= |title=Love is Hell: Special Ultra Jumbo 10th Anniversary Edition |chapter=Introduction |year=1994 |publisher=Pantheon Books |location=New York |isbn=0-679-75665-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was an underground success, selling 22,000 copies in its first two printings. Soon afterward, Caplan and Groening left the ''Reader'' and put together the Life in Hell Co., which handled [[print syndication|syndication]] and merchandising for Groening’s projects.&lt;ref name="latimesmag"&gt;{{cite book |last=Morgenstern |first=Joe |authorlink=Joe Morgenstern |coauthors= |title=Los Angeles Times Magazine |chapter=Bart Simpson's Real Father |pages=12–18, 20, 22 |date=1990-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Life in Hell'' reached the attention of Hollywood producer [[James L. Brooks]], who received one strip—"The Los Angeles Way of Death" from 1982—as a gift from fellow producer [[Polly Platt]].&lt;ref name="americasfirstfamily"&gt;{{cite video|people=BBC|date=2000|title=The Simpsons: America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/|format=DVD|location=UK|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kim"&gt;{{cite web|title=Keep 'em Laughing |date=October 1999 |last=Kim |first=John W. |work=Scr(i)pt |url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening99d.html |accessdate=January 14, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526133854/http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening99d.html |archivedate=May 26, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of developing a series of short animated [[sketch comedy|skit]]s, called "bumpers", for ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. Originally, Brooks had wanted Groening to adapt his ''Life in Hell'' characters for the show. Fearing the loss of ownership rights to his characters, Groening instead created an entirely new batch of characters; [[Simpson family|the Simpsons]].

As television began to place more demands on his time, however, Groening came to almost exclusively feature single-panel strips or 16-panel grids in which Akbar and Jeff exchange terse jabs. This later period also saw the increase of autobiographical strips, perhaps because Groening was influenced by this burgeoning trend in [[alternative comics]].

Television has also made the strip "safe enough for a number of newspapers to print", according to Groening, who claims that he has not "toned the strip down at all, other than no longer using profanity"&lt;ref name="flux"&gt;{{cite web|title=Life in Hell |work=Flux Magazine |url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening95.html |last=Paul |first=Alan |date=1995-09-30 |accessdate=January 14, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208235641/http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening95.html |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a concession to daily papers that carry the strip.&lt;ref name="motherjones"&gt;{{cite web | title=Matt Groening | work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] | url=https://www.motherjones.com/arts/qa/1999/03/groening.html | last=Doherty | first=Brian | date=March–April 1999 | accessdate=January 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 1998 Groening registered the domain mattgroening.com to publish ''Life in Hell'' online; however, the website has remained in its "under construction" state since then, although Groening insists he'll "get around to it ... [when he's] ready to wade in on a regular basis."&lt;ref name="ojr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ojr.org/ojr/entertainment/1042169162.php |title=Doh! Groening's Guide to Digital Cartooning |date=January 2003 |work=USC Annenberg Online Journalism Review |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026112352/http://www.ojr.org/ojr/entertainment/1042169162.php |archivedate=2005-10-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 3, 2013, the domain has expired.

Groening decided in 2007, in the wake of the [[110th United States Congress|2006 U.S. election results]], to write "Life Is Swell" above the comic instead of "Life in Hell".&lt;ref name="laweekly"&gt;{{cite web | title=Matt Groening: Life is Swell | work=[[LA Weekly]] | url=http://www.laweekly.com/2007-07-19/news/matt-groening-life-is-swell/  | last=Shulman | first=Dave | date=2007-07-19 | accessdate=September 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Groening had previously stated that he would never give up the comic strip,&lt;ref name="tvhost"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prime time is heaven for 'Life in Hell' Artist |work=TV Host |url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening89.html |last=Leopold |first=Todd |date=1989-12-16 |accessdate=March 23, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102171637/http://snpp.com/other/interviews/groening89.html |archivedate=January 2, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009 he indicated that due to troubling times for print newspapers and constant involvement with ''The Simpsons'' and ''Futurama'', he would likely one day drop the strip.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web | title=Matt Groening looks to the future | work=CNN | url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/TV/02/26/matt.groening.futurama/index.html | last=Bergman | first=Erik H. | date=2009-02-26 | accessdate=February 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Groening announced the strip's conclusion and the final new strip ran on June 16, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/story/2012-06-19/matt-groening-life-in-hell/55698336/1|title='Life in Hell' is over for cartoonist Matt Groening|author=Graham, Jefferson|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2012-06-20|date=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final strip shows Akbar or Jeff dancing naked, while the other tells him to stop. At the end of the strip he gives up and dances along with him, saying "Well, I tried." 

The strip has been published in his home town Portland since 1986. They have skipped some strips due to political jokes that the paper didn't like.

==Format==
The strip was published in a perfect square, unlike most Sunday strips which are published in rectangles. He had different types of format. He would make 4 rows of boxes, each row with 4 in it, when Akbar and Jeff were discussing love. He did 3 boxes by 3, very rarely did he use 4 boxes. Single boxes were often quick and comedic, and 4 x 4 boxes often had a story line. This is based on the way [[Lynda Barry]] made comics when they were in college, and the way it was published originally in the "Reader." Atop each strip, he quickly writes out "Life in Hell" and Copyright Matt Groening and the year it was made. Sometimes though, he changed the way he wrote the title on top. Instead of being quickly written, sometimes it would be in balloons, or bubble letters, or fireworks, old English handwriting, etc., he also wrote "This is your" above the "Life in Hell." He also sometimes changed the way he wrote his name and date but not very often. In one strip "Why men growl" from 1982, he wrote his name as Matt Grrrrroening. In another strip, "Are you Easily Provoked?" He misspelled his name 3 times until getting it right and writing "godamnit" underneath. If he gets help from another cartoonist, he writes their names underneath his. Sometimes a message such as "My back feels better, thank you." He sometimes put where he was when he was making the strip, he'd write Chicago or Portland underneath his name.

==Recurring characters==
*'''Binky''' is a stressed and thus "normal" rabbit and star of the cartoon. He usually embodies dread and alienation. Binky is usually stuck in a dead end job, has a bad apartment and regularly sees a therapist. Binky usually is full of wise old sayings.
*'''Sheba''' is Binky's estranged girlfriend. Her character design is "basically Binky in drag".&lt;ref name="sheba"&gt;{{cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |authorlink=Matt Groening |coauthors= |title=The Huge Book of Hell |chapter=Hell For Beginners |pages=137 |year=1997 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |isbn=0-14-026310-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Binky and Sheba met at a coffee shop in a 1981 storyline, and are often used as a generic couple whenever Groening needs one.
*'''Bongo''' is Binky's illegitimate son, the product of a drunken night of "jungle passion." He was introduced in a 1983 storyline in which his mother, Hulga, left him to Binky so she could seek her fortune in New York. Bongo's defining physical attribute is his one ear, which Groening admits is solely so that the casual viewer can tell him apart from Binky.&lt;ref name="royale"&gt;{{cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |authorlink=Matt Groening |coauthors= |title=Simpsons Comics Royale |chapter=The Secret Life of Lisa Simpson |pages=128 |year=2001 |publisher=Perennial |location=New York |isbn=0-06-093378-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bongo made an appearance in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[Xmas Story]]", where he is seen being sold in a [[pet store|pet shop]]. He also appeared in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Treehouse of Horror XII]]" as one of the rabbits that [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] catches in the trap. He appears in ''The Simpsons'' again in [[The Man in the Blue Flannel Pants|another episode]] as a plush toy in [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]'s room, though he is called Madam Bunny. He is shown as a plush toy in "[[The Fool Monty]]" where [[Mr. Burns]] is eating it in [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]'s closet.  He has a cameo in "[[Simpsorama]]" as one of the rabbit-like creatures rampaging New New York, where he writes on a wall "Crossovers are hell".
*'''Akbar &amp; Jeff''' are described in various strips and interviews as "brothers or lovers...and possibly both". In one interview, Groening says they are gay.&lt;ref name="flux"/&gt; They have large noses and wear [[Fez (clothing)|fezzes]] and [[Charlie Brown]]-like striped shirts. They have run numerous businesses over the years, including Akbar &amp; Jeff's Tofu Hut, Akbar &amp; Jeff's Earthquake T-shirt Hut, and Akbar &amp; Jeff's Bootleg "Akbar &amp; Jeff" T-shirt Hut. Like Binky and Sheba, Akbar and Jeff are often used as a generic couple when needed. According to Groening, "the reason why I draw a strip with Akbar and Jeff instead of Binky and Sheba is that I figure that no one can accuse me of trying to score points against men or women if the characters are identical."&lt;ref name="loveishell"/&gt; They have been given cameo appearances in ''The Simpsons'', such as during "[[Homer's Triple Bypass]]", where Homer uses finger puppets resembling the characters to describe his surgery to Bart and Lisa.&lt;ref name=Jean&gt;{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|date=2004|title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Triple Bypass"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Matt Groening''' appears in the strip as a bearded, [[Glasses|bespectacled]] rabbit. He is also sometimes represented as Binky.
*'''Will and Abe''' are Matt Groening's two sons, represented in rabbit form. They usually talk about vampires, zombies, and other child-fantasy topics.
*'''Snarla''', a cat, is Bongo's classmate and love interest. She bears a resemblance to [[Lisa Simpson]].
*'''[[Bart Simpson]]''', has never spoken—except when he uttered his former catch phrase "Don't have a cow, man!" in a "forbidden words" strip—but is seen in the background of a number of strips.
*'''Mr. Simpson''' is Binky's [[anthropomorphic]] dog boss at his job. His name predates ''[[The Simpsons]]''.
*'''Gooey, Screwy, and Ratatouille''' are Akbar and/or Jeff's triplet nephews.  The names are an obvious spoof of the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] characters [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]] ([[Donald Duck]]'s nephews).

==Recurring jokes and situations==
*'''Fake magazines''' such as "Lonely Tyrant: The magazine for abusive bosses whose employees hate their guts". Stories inside include, "The fine art of the meaningless memo".
*'''The X types of Y:''' The 9 types of college teachers, the 81 types of high school students, the 16 types of brothers, the 9 types of relationships.
*'''How-To Guides:'''  Examples include "So You Want to Be an Unrecognized Genius", "How to Be a Clever Film Critic", and "How to Get into the College of Your Choice".
*'''Miniseries'''&amp;nbsp;– A series of strips focusing on a particular theme in a mock textbook manner, such as "School is Hell" and "Love is Hell", both of which have been collected in their entirety in book form.
*'''Akbar &amp; Jeff discussing their relationship'''&amp;nbsp;– Arguably the most common set-up. A 1992 strip, "The Dart Game of Love", was prefaced with "I hope this cartoon pleases you gripers who whined about all those Akbar &amp; Jeff strips where they stared at each other."
*'''Binky attempting to meditate'''
*'''Advertisements for disreputable businesses run by Akbar &amp; Jeff''' such as "Akbar &amp; Jeff's Lucky Psychic Hut".
*'''Bongo locked in a detention room or orphanage''' - Usually, with 1 or 2 pairs of eyes watching him.
*'''Bongo unsatisfied with the huge assortment of presents he has received on Christmas morning'''
*'''Shadow rabbit'''&amp;nbsp;– Binky's looming shadow towers over Bongo, who has clearly committed a crime despite his assurances to the contrary. Several of Bongo's excuses parodied those of politicians, such as "[[Mistakes were made]]". Occasionally there would also be a shadow Akbar &amp; Jeff looming over Bongo and their nephews. One comic showed Bongo's shadow looming over Binky.
*'''Pledge of Allegiance:''' Bongo's class is forced to recite the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]. Bongo intentionally butchers the Pledge, usually criticizing the government in the process ("and to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] which I can't stand"). One strip, released after the death of musician [[Frank Zappa]] in 1993, has Bongo replacing most the words of the Pledge with names of Zappa albums ("With [[The Yellow Shark|yellow sharks]] and [[Hot Rats|hot rats]] for all"). The comic would always end with Bongo's teacher angrily leering at him, and often Bongo would be tied to his desk and gagged as punishment.
*'''Forbidden Words'''&amp;nbsp;– An annual compilation of buzzwords used over the past year that Groening has deemed "forbidden". This topic was the first ever comic by Groening, published in 1980. These also appear in ''Simpsons'' annuals.
*'''"How to draw Binky"''' - Often comedic ways on how to draw Binky, usually one of which is drawing randomly with your eyes closed.

==Merchandise and advertising==
After the success of ''Love Is Hell'', more book collections followed, including ''Work Is Hell'' and ''Childhood Is Hell''. To date, 15 books have been released.

In addition to the books, the comic also spawned T-shirts, greeting cards, posters,&lt;ref name="latimesmag"/&gt; coffee mugs, and a short-lived newsletter called the "Life in Hell Times".&lt;ref name="whatthehell"&gt;{{cite web|author=Romanov, Alexander |title=Rare Life in Hell Merchandise |date=2005-07-27 |work=What the Hell |url=http://hell.capefeare.com/items.php |accessdate=2007-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206214505/http://hell.capefeare.com/items.php |archivedate=2007-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an annual calendar.

In the late 1980s, Groening drew several print advertisements for [[Apple Computer]] in the form of ''Life in Hell'' comic strips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vintagezen.com/zen/2013/2/26/matt-groenings-artwork-for-apple |title=Matt Groening Apple Ad from 1989 |author= |date= |website=vintagezen.com |publisher= |access-date=August 10, 2016 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718102055/http://vintagezen.com/zen/2013/2/26/matt-groenings-artwork-for-apple |archivedate=July 18, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2005 [[Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] in [[San Diego]], a series of deluxe ''Life in Hell'' vinyl figurines manufactured by CritterBox Toys was announced.&lt;ref name="scs"&gt;{{cite web | title=Life Is Heaven with Life In Hell Line | date=2005-07-18 | work=Simpsons Collector Sector | url=http://www.simpsonscollectors.com/news.asp?archive=7/2005/ | accessdate=2007-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Binky and Bongo appear as background non-interactive characters in the Simpsons arcade video game (coin-op).

==History==
The first testimonies were related to the sacred performances of the Passion of Christ which were located in the ''Loggia del Giuramento'', and were a central moment in the life of the citizens because the entire population was involved in the spectacular staging.&lt;ref name="ORSELLI"&gt;Cesare Orselli, ''Toscana: una scena incantata. Guida ai luoghi dell'opera'', Firenze, Giunti, 2007-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1500s, the Chappell of the Cathedral became the main musical organization, next to the single parishes and churches of the Domenican order and of San Filippo, the latter attended by nobility. Starting in the 1600s, the Rospigliosi family was central to the music scene in [[Pistoia]]&lt;ref&gt;Giulio Rospigliosi becomes [[Pope Clement IX]] in 1667, and was one of the greatest authors of sacred lyric works or operas of the Roman Baroque.&lt;/ref&gt;, together with Melani and Pasquini. With their donations they succeeded in ensuring that the Chappell always continued to excel.&lt;ref name="ORSELLI" /&gt; In this period, the dynasties of composers Gherardeschi and [[Giovan Gualberto Brunetti|Brunetti]], who dominated the music in [[Pistoia]] even in the 1700s, were affirmed. The entire activity of the Chappell and the works of its masters, made up of compositions from scratch such as the performance and collection of the works of other composers, has been merged, and is today available for consult, in the preserved documents of the ''Biliotheca Musicalis'' of the Archive of the Chapter&lt;ref name="MUSICALIS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=16&amp;val_search=|title=Bibliotheca Musicalis|publisher=CeDoMus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MUSICALIS SITO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archiviocapitolaredipistoia.it/mo-bibliotheca_musicalis-id4.php|title=Bibliotheca Musicalis|publisher=Official website of the Archive of the Chapter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Forteguerriana Library (Biblioteca Forteguerriana)&lt;ref name="FORTE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=43&amp;val_search=|title=Music material in Forteguerriana|publisher=CeDoMus}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while the materials produced by the single parishes are today found in the State Archive (Archivio di Stato)&lt;ref name="STATO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=49&amp;val_search=|title=Musical material in State Archive|publisher=CeDoMus}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in the Leoniana Library at the Vescovile Seminary&lt;ref name="PARROCCHIE LEONIANA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=9&amp;val_search=|title=Parishes archives of Pistoia Diocese |publisher=CeDoMus}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Old Library of Canonici (today at the Archive of the Chapter)&lt;ref name="CANONICI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=14&amp;val_search=|title=Old Library of Canonici|publisher=CeDoMus}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and at the Domenican Library.&lt;ref name="DOMENICANI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=234&amp;val_search=|title=Domenican Library|publisher=CeDoMus}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Musica a notazione quadrata all'Archivio di Stato di Pistoia.jpg|thumb|left|Music and square notation in the State Archive in Pistoia&lt;ref name="STATO" /&gt;]]
Beginning in the 1600s, the large nobile families also began to patron the production of lyric opera, especially in the academic scene (The Accademia dei Risvegliati constructed its theater in 1677). Melani made their descendents acquire musical skills: Jacopo, Alessandro and Atto became esteemed composers and musicians in Italy and in France.&lt;ref name="ORSELLI" /&gt; However, the Rospigliosi family is still the family that left the greatest trace and documentation of operatic activities in Pistoia in the 1600s and on: the Rospigliosi Collection (today divided between the Archive of the Chapter and the Forteguerriana Library) attests to the great musical vitality of the citizens with a collection of music of the most influential composers in the world, performed in Pistoia until the end of the 1800s, which was the century in which the Rospigliosi salon, where many celebrities gathered, was one of the major cultural centers at the local level..&lt;ref name="ROS FORTE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=10&amp;val_search=|title=Rospigliosi Collection in Forteguerriana Library|publisher=CeDoMus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ROS CAP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=11&amp;val_search=|title=Rospigliosi Collection in Archive of the Chapter|publisher=CeDoMus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ROS VOLUME"&gt;Teresa Dolfi, Luciano Vannucci (ed.), ''Catalogo del Fondo Musicale Rospigliosi'', Lucca, LIM, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel to the secular production, we cannot forget the production of sacred music (as is attested by the Music Collection of the Seminary&lt;ref name="MUS SEMINARIO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=6&amp;val_search=|title=Seminary music collection|publisher=CeDoMus}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Collection of the Parish of the Madonna dell'Umiltà (Mary of Umility)&lt;ref name="MADONNA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=45&amp;val_search=|title=Mary of Umility Collection in Leoniana Library of the Seminary|publisher=CeDoMus}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the musical documents of the Fabroniana Library, rich in theoretical and historical texts that were especially pertinent to the 1700s&lt;ref name="FABRONIANA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=18&amp;val_search=|title=Fabroniana Library|publisher=CeDoMus}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A composer of the 1800s, [[Teodulo Mabellini]], for example, wrote both lyric operas and sacred music, and some of his compositions are today preserved as autographs in the Forteguerriana Library and in the Archive of the Chapter (see the [[Teodulo_Mabellini#Sources|Sources of Mabellini]]). In the 1800s, the Borgognoni Philharmonic and the School of Music and Dance were founded (later named Mabellini). The Philharmonic conducted an intense production of music and diffusion of sophisticated music, thanks to the many band arrangements, today preserved in their archive&lt;ref name="BANDA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=28&amp;val_search=|title=Music Archive of Borgognoni Philharmonic|publisher=CeDoMus}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

An exceptional testimony of music of the 1900s is at the Mabellini School of Music and Dance: the autographed arrangements by Carlo Savina for two concerts in Pistoia of the music of [[Nino Rota]] performed with the Orchestra of Rome of [[RAI]] in 1981.&lt;ref name="SAVINA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=189&amp;val_search=|title=Fondo Rota-Savina|publisher=CeDoMus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16090">The '''New Engineering Contract''' ('''NEC'''), or '''NEC Engineering and Construction Contract''', is a formalised system created by the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] that guides the [[Legal writing|drafting]] of documents on [[civil engineering]] and [[construction|construction projects]] for the purpose of obtaining [[Call for bids|tenders]], awarding and administering [[contracts]].&lt;ref&gt;R Gerard (2005). [http://www.leanconstruction.org/lcj/V2_N1/LCJ_05_006.pdf Relational contracts—NEC in perspective]. Lean Construction Journal, 2, 80-86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brook M. (2004). Estimating and Tendering for Construction Work Butterworth-Heinemann {{ISBN|978-0-7506-5864-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such they [[Law#Contract law|legally]] define the responsibilities and duties of Employers (who commission work) and [[Contractors]] (who carry out work) in the Works Information. The contract consists of two key parts the Contract Data part one (Data provided by the Employer) and Contract Data part two (Data provided by the Contractor).  Several approaches are included making it a family of options. It is used in the [[UK]] and internationally in countries including [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Patterson R (2007) [http://www.neccontract.com/documents/events/Introducing%20NEC%20-%20R%20Patterson.pdf Introducing NEC Wellington Seminar]&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been four editions, the first in 1993, the second in 1995, the third in 2005 and the most recent in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.neccontract.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The NEC3 was launched in 2005 and it was amended in April 2013.

NEC4 was announced in March 2017 and has been available since June 2017. This new edition reflects procurement and project management developments and emerging best practice, with improvements in flexibility, clarity and the ease of administration. It also introduces two new contracts: NEC4 Design, Build and Operate (DBO) and NEC4 Alliance Contract (ALC).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.neccontract.com/About-NEC/News-Media/NEC4-the-next-generation-of-NEC-Contracts&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The NEC is a family of standard contracts, each of which has these characteristics:

* Its use stimulates good management of the relationship between the two parties to the contract and, hence, of the work included in the contract.
* It can be used in a wide variety of commercial situations, for a wide variety of types of work and in any location.
* It is a clear and simple document - using language and a structure which are straightforward and easily understood.

The NEC3 complies fully with the [http://www.ogc.gov.uk/guidance_achieving_excellence_in_construction.asp Achieving Excellence in Construction] (AEC) principles. The Efficiency &amp; Reform Group of The UK Cabinet Office recommends the use of NEC3 by public sector construction procurers on their construction projects.

==Options==

The NEC contracts now form a suite of contracts, with NEC being the brand name for the "umbrella" of contracts. When it was first launched in 1993, it was simply the "New Engineering Contract". This specific contract has been renamed the "Engineering and Construction Contract" which is the main contract used for any construction based project. It now sits alongside a number of other contracts that together should mean that the NEC suite is suitable for what ever stage of a lifecycle the project is at and for any party within a project. The contracts available within the suite are:

'''Engineering and Construction Contract (ECC)''':
 
Suitable for any construction based contract between an Employer and a Contractor. It is intended to be suitable for any sector of the industry, including civil, building, nuclear, oil &amp; gas, etc. 
Within the ECC contract there are six family level options of which the Employer will choose what she/he deems to be the most suitable and give her/him the best option/value for money on that project:

* Option A: Priced contract with activity schedule
* Option B: Priced contract with bill of quantities
* Option C: Target contract with activity schedule
* Option D: Target contract with bill of quantities
* Option E: Cost-reimbursable contract
* Option F: Management contract

These options offer a framework for tender and contract clauses that differ primarily in regard to the mechanisms by which the contractor is paid and how risk is allocated/motivated to control costs.

The core clauses (of the main option listed above) are used in conjunction with the secondary options and the additional conditions of contract. The Efficiency and Reform group of The Cabinet Office in the UK (formerly the OGC) has published generic [http://www.ogc.gov.uk/documents/PublicSectorZClausesForUseWithNEC3Contracts.pdf public sector Z-clauses for the use with '''NEC3''' contracts].

The clauses of these options have been be adapted for simpler less risky work (short contracts), for use as subcontracts, and for professional services such as design as below.

'''The Engineering and Construction Subcontract Contract (ECS)'''

Very similar in detail and complexity of contractual requirements to the ECC contract above, but allows the contractor to sub-let the project to a subcontractor imposing most of the clauses that she/he has within her/his headline contract. There is very little difference between the ECC and the ECS, other than the names of the parties are changed (contractor and subcontractor)and some of the timescales for contractual responses are altered to take into account the timescales required in the ECC contract.

'''The Engineering and Construction Short Contract (ECSC)'''

This is an abbreviated version of the ECC contract and most suitable when the contract is considered "low risk" (not necessarily low value) on a project with little change expected. This contract is still between the employer and contractor but does not use all of the processes of the ECC making it simpler and easier to manage and administer.

'''The Engineering and Construction Short Subcontract (ECSS)'''

Allows the contractor to sub-let a simpler lower risk contract down the line to a subcontractor. It is back-to-back with the ECSC but is frequently used as subcontract when the main contract is under the ECS.

'''The Professional Services Contract (PSC)'''

This contract is for anyone providing a service, rather than doing any physical construction works. Designers are the most obvious party that fit into this category. Whilst they are producing a design for an employer or contractor, they would sign up and follow the clauses within the PSC. Most of the clauses within this contract are the same or similar to those in the main ECC contract, so that all contractors, designers and subcontractors have pretty much the same obligations and processes to follow as each other.

'''The Professional Services Short Contract (PSSC)'''

This was added to the family in April 2013 and was co-developed with the Association for Project Management. It is for simpler less complex assignments than the PSC, such as the appointment of small team for managing an ECC contract on the Employer's behalf. E.g. the Project Manager and Supervisor. It is frequently used as a subcontract to the PSC for design work.

'''Framework Contract (FC)'''

Parties enter into a "framework" of which work packages will then be let during the life of that framework. Any individual projects will then be awarded using one of the other contracts within the suite, meaning that the parties follow the headline clauses within the framework contract (which is a fairly slim contract) and then the individual clauses within the chosen contract for that package. Different work packages can be let using different contracts during the life of the framework.

'''Term Service Contract (TSC)'''

For parties on a project that is operational or maintenance based, e.g. maintaining highway signage, where the contract is to ensure that a certain standard is maintained. This contract is not generally used for constructing new works, but can include some amount of betterment. There is also a "Term Service Short Contract" where the project is a relatively low risk project and/or the work is primarily re-active. It is an abbreviated version of the main TSC.

'''Supply Contract/Short Supply Contract (SC/SSC)'''

These contracts were launched in 2010. This is for a supplier of supplies or goods to a project, and puts extra contractual requirements on them during their procurement/manufacture period. The Supply Contract is for big bespoke items i.e. designed and manufactured specifically for that contract, with the Short Supply Contract potentially being for more run of the mill / commoditised items on a project. Neither of these contracts cover working on a Site. I.e. as written they are not 'supply and install' contracts.

'''Dispute Resolution Services Contract (DRSC) - previously Adjudicator's Contract'''

If there is a dispute between the parties on a project then the Adjudicator will follow the clauses within this contract in order to come to a decision.

'''Design Build and Operate (DBO)'''

The NEC4 Design, Build and Operate Contract (DBO) allows the procurement of a more integrated whole-life delivery solution. It combines responsibility for design, construction, operation and/or maintenance, procured from a single supplier.

It can include a range of different services to be provided before, during and after engineering and construction works are completed.

'''Alliance Contract (ALC)'''
The NEC4 Alliance Contract (ALC) will be published initially in a consultation form. It was created to support Clients who wish to take a step forward by fully integrating the delivery team for large complex projects.

The ALC should be used to engage in a single collaborative contract with a number of participants in order to deliver a project or programme of work. The basis of the contract will be that all parties work together in achieving Client objectives, and share in the risks and benefits of doing so.	

'''Guidance Notes and Flowcharts'''

For each of the different contracts listed above each comes with its own set of guidance notes and flowcharts which should aid understanding of the intent of the drafted clauses. The guidance notes expand on each clause to give extra substance and intent of the original drafters as to how a clause should be understood and interpreted. The flowcharts then map out each of the main processes within each contract and demonstrate how it should operate and what to do next if a party has or has not carried out the next contractual action.

==History==

Originally contracts in the civil engineering and construction industries were bespoke and drafted by [[Inns of Chancery|Chancery]] [[Special pleader|pleaders]] using their knowledge of [[leases]] rather than building processes. In 1879, [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] for construction projects created RIBA forms which lead to the [[Joint Contracts Tribunal]], JCT forms. For civil engineering the need for a formalized approach to contracts led the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] to produce the ICE formalized set of conditions of contract. In 1986, the ICE commissioned the development of a new form of contract as it was felt that there was a need for a form that had clearer language, clearer allocation of responsibilities and reduced opportunities for contractual “gamesmanship”. In 1991, this resulted in a consultative form of the New Engineering Contract form of contract. The first edition was published in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Broome JC, Hayes RW. (1997). A comparison of the clarity of traditional construction contracts and of the New Engineering Contract. International Journal of Project Management, 15, 255-261. {{doi|10.1016/S0263-7863(96)00078-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wider use of the NEC was recommended by the [[Latham Report]] in 1994.

NEC's history started in 1986 when [[Martin Barnes]] was commissioned to start drafting a contract to stimulated good project management.

The first edition of NEC was launched in 1993. NEC2 arrived two years later, in 1995. NEC2 was used to build the High Speed 1 railway, between London and the Channel Tunnel.

The NEC3 suite was launched in 2005 and it was fully revised in 2013 - NEC's 20th anniversary. This suite was used in projects such as Crossrail, London 2012 Olympics, Halley VI, and the Tin Shui Wai Hospital in Hong Kong.

NEC3 was endorsed by The Construction Clients' Board (formerly Public Sector Construction Clients' Forum), Crown Commercial Services, The Facilities Management Board of the Cabinet Office UK, The South African Construction Industry Development Board, The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), The Association for Project Management (APM) and The British Institute of Facilities Management (BIFM).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.neccontract.com/About-NEC/Endorsements&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hong Kong government decided to use NEC3 contracts generally for all government projects tendered in 2015/16. After a series of successful NEC3 projects in the region, the Hong Kong government announced in November 2016 that the NEC contract suite will be used for all future public works projects as far as practicable.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.neccontract.com/About-NEC/News-Media/Hong-Kong-government-endorses-NEC-as-main-contract&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison==

The following demonstrates the differing approaches to drafting in the NEC and ICE forms of contract using the illustration of circumstances when the contractor is entitled to additional time and cost for physical conditions.

;NEC Engineering and Construction Contract Second Edition Clause 60.1 (12)
The Contractor encounters physical conditions which
* are within the site.
* are not weather conditions and
* which an experienced contractor would have judged at the Contract Date to have such a small chance of occurring that it would have been unreasonable for her/him to have allowed for them.

;ICE Conditions of Contract Sixth Edition Clause 12(1)

&lt;blockquote&gt;If during the execution of the Works the Contractor shall encounter physical conditions (other than weather conditions or conditions due to weather conditions) or artificial obstructions which conditions or obstructions could not in her/his opinion reasonably have been foreseen by an experienced contractor the Contractor shall as early as practicable give written notice thereof to the Engineer. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Guidance Notes and Further Information==

Guidance Notes  and Flow Charts are published by the ICE. These notes are supplemented by the Frequently Asked Questions sections of the NEC website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neccontract.com/FAQs/index.asp  www.neccontract.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Prospective users of the NEC3 contract are encouraged to study the FAQ's in order to avoid unintended contract provisions. The often unintended Option C scenario where a Contractor is paid monies in excess of the Target Cost plus maximum share provisions is specifically not addressed in the guidance notes / Frequently Asked Questions. Other common misinterpretations are [http://www.neccontract.com/FAQs/faq_detail.asp?ID=117&amp;FAQCat=1&amp;FAQSubCat=&amp;Keyword= minutes of meetings as communications], [http://www.neccontract.com/FAQs/faq_detail.asp?ID=53&amp;FAQCat=1&amp;FAQSubCat=&amp;Keyword= deleted work] and [http://www.neccontract.com/FAQs/faq_detail.asp?ID=60&amp;FAQCat=1&amp;FAQSubCat=&amp;Keyword= paying for correcting defects]. Employers often use the additional conditions of contract (Z-clauses) to amend or delete contract provisions relating to these items.

[[File:NYTimesBldgByLuigiNovi2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[The New York Times Building]] in [[New York City]], [[United States]]; some meanings of the term "newspaper of record" originated in reference to ''[[The New York Times]]'']]

A '''newspaper of record''' is a major [[newspaper]] that has a large circulation and whose editorial and news-gathering functions are considered professional and typically [[authoritative]]. A newspaper of record may also be a publicly available newspaper that has been authorised or maintained by a government to publish [[Public notice|public or legal notices]], and therefore serves as a "newspaper of public record".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Shannon E.|title=Newspapers of Record in a Digital Age: From Hot Type to Hot Link|year=1998|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-275-95960-0|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwZ9QgWpJfwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newspapers of public record==
A "newspaper of public record", sometimes referred to as an "[[public journal|official newspaper]]", refers to a publicly available newspaper that has been authorised by a government to publish public or legal notices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Shannon E.|title=Newspapers of record in a digital age: from hot type to hot link|year=1998|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-275-95960-0|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwZ9QgWpJfwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often established by [[statute]] or official action and publication of notices within it, whether by the government or a private party, is usually considered sufficient to comply with legal requirements for public notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary, 6th edn.|year=1990|publisher=West Publishing|isbn=90-6544-631-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions, privately owned newspapers may register with the public authorities to publish public and legal notices, or be otherwise eligible to publish said notices (terms used may include "newspaper of general circulation" among others).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, L.N. 362 of 1997 of The Government of The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Gazette&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[For example, see http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/LG/htm/LG.52.htm#52.004 Texas Local Government Code - Section 52.004. Official Newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of McCleary, Official Newspaper|url=http://www.cityofmccleary.com/index.asp?SEC=%7B821D9B2C-D6B1-4D12-AB18-1A88DE86A30D%7D&amp;Type=B_LIST}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a private newspaper may be designated by the [[court]]s for publication of legal notices, such as notices of [[fictitious business name]]s. These are sometimes referred to as "legally adjudicated newspapers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fictitious Names: Adjudicated Newspapers|url=http://www.sonoma-county.org/Clerk/HTML_Documents/FictitiousNames/Newspapers.htm|work=County Clerk|publisher=[[Sonoma County, California|County of Sonoma]]|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of newspapers of public record are those newspapers controlled by governments or political parties that serve as official newspapers reflecting the positions of their controlling bodies. [[Organs of state|State organs]] such as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era ''[[Izvestia]]'' (the name of which translates to "delivered messages", derived from the verb ''izveshchat'' which means "to inform", "to notify")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eastview.com/Files/EVIzvestiiaDA.pdf |title=Izvestiia Digital Archive 1917-2010.

==Newspapers of record (by reputation)==
The second type of "newspaper of record" (also known as a "journal of record", or by the [[French language|French]] term ''{{lang|fr|presse de référence}}'') is not defined by any formal criteria and its characteristics can be variable.  The category typically consists of those newspapers that are considered to meet higher [[Journalism ethics and standards|standards of journalism]] than most print media, including editorial independence and attention to accuracy, and are usually renowned internationally.&lt;ref name="Salles"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salles|first=Chloë|title=Media Coverage of the Internet: An Acculturation Strategy for Press of Record?|journal=Innovation Journalism|date=January 2010|volume=7|issue=1|page=5|url=http://www.innovationjournalism.org/archive/INJO-7-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Shannon|title=Newspapers of Record in a Digital Age: From Hot Type to Hot Link|year=1998|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0275959600|pages=6, 27, 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite changes in society, such newspapers have historically tended to maintain a similar tone, coverage, style, and traditions.&lt;ref name="Salles"/&gt;

===Origin of the term===
The term is believed to have originated among librarians, who began referring to ''[[The New York Times]]'' as the "newspaper of record" when, in 1913, it became the first U.S. newspaper to publish an index of the subjects covered in its pages.&lt;ref name="Martin 1998 7"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Shannon E.|title=Newspapers of record in a digital age: from hot type to hot link|year=1998|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-275-95960-0|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwZ9QgWpJfwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of the usage, the ''Times'' held an essay contest in 1927 in which entrants had to demonstrate "The Value of ''The New York Times'' Index and Files as a Newspaper of Record".  The ''Times'', and other newspapers of its type, then sought to be chroniclers of events, acting as a record of the day's announcements, schedules, directories, proceedings, transcripts and appointments. The ''Times'' no longer considers itself a newspaper of record in the original, literal sense.&lt;ref name=Okrent&gt;{{cite news|last=Okrent|first=Daniel|title=The Public Editor — Paper of Record? No Way, No Reason, No Thanks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/25/weekinreview/the-public-editor-paper-of-record-no-way-no-reason-no-thanks.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|work=The New York TImes|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, historians began to rely on ''The New York Times'' and similar titles as a reliable archival record of significant past events and a gauge of societal opinions at the time of printing. The term "newspaper of record" thus evolved from its original literal sense to its currently understood meaning.&lt;ref name="Martin 1998 7"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5009">'''Newspaper theft''' is a form of [[censorship]] in which a large portion of the print run of a [[newspaper]] or other publication is stolen or destroyed, with the intention of preventing others from reading it. It may be carried out by individuals, organized groups, or governmental entities.

==Overview==
The motivation for newspaper theft is usually to suppress circulation of a story, item, or advertisement that is viewed as unfavorable or offensive by an individual or group. In some cases, the action is motivated by a generalized animus toward the editorial slant of the publication. The actors involved in newspaper thefts vary; they include political groups, [[fraternities and sororities]], [[College athletics|college athletic teams]], as well as politicians or public officials, who may order police or other government agents to remove copies of the publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Hiestand| first = Mike| title = Newspaper theft remains popular form of censorship| work = Trends in College Media| accessdate = 2010-07-12| date = 2005-03-01| url = http://www.studentpress.org/acp/trends/~law0205college.html| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807115901/http://www.studentpress.org/acp/trends/~law0205college.html| archivedate = 2011-08-07| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Thornton| first = Paul| title = Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates to Plead Guilty to Theft| work = [[The Daily Californian]]| accessdate = 2010-07-12| date = 2002-12-12| url = http://www.dailycal.org/article/10530/berkeley_mayor_tom_bates_to_plead_guilty_to_theft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Student Press Law Center]] has tracked college newspaper thefts since 2000.&lt;ref name="Where newspaper thefts are reported"&gt;[http://www.splc.org//knowyourrights/theftmap.asp Where newspaper thefts are reported]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, 27 newspaper thefts were reported by college papers.&lt;ref name="Where newspaper thefts are reported"/&gt;

==Laws concerning newspaper theft==
The unpaid taking of newspapers which are for sale constitutes [[theft]], as does unauthorized taking of newspapers that have been delivered to subscribers or have yet to be distributed. However, removal of multiple copies of free newspapers and publications is not a crime in most jurisdictions. In response to high-profile incidents, laws specifically against newspaper theft, including the theft of large numbers of free newspapers, have been passed in the states of [[Maryland]] and [[Colorado]], and the cities of [[San Francisco]] and [[Berkeley, California]].&lt;ref name=calvert&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://elr.lls.edu/issues/v25-issue1/documents/13.Calvertfinalpdf.pdf|last=Calvert|first=Clay|year=2005|title=All the News That's Fit to Steal: The First Amendment, a Free Press &amp;(and) a Lagging Legislative Response|journal=Loyola of Los Angeles Entertainment Law Review|volume=25|issue=1|pages=117–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maryland law makes it a [[misdemeanor]] offense when "A person ... knowingly or willfully obtain[s] or exert[s] control that is unauthorized over newspapers with the intent to prevent another from reading the newspapers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefire.org/public/pdfs/33d307c028d0cf2a836e679ff95de833.pdf Md. CRIMINAL LAW Code Ann. §  7-106 (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purchase with the intent to block distribution==
A related and less common phenomenon is the clandestine purchase of a large portion of the print run of a newspaper. While this does not normally violate any law, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] ruled in the 2004 case ''[[Rossignol v. Voorhaar]]'' that public officials who purchase a large portion of the print run of a newspaper with the intention of keeping a story out of the view of the public are acting in violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and are liable for civil damages. This decision was later upheld by [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] without hearing.&lt;ref name=calvert/&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the film ''[[Absence of Malice]]'', the character Teresa Perrone attempts unsuccessfully to destroy a run of newspapers that has a story exposing her abortion, before she commits suicide. In an episode of''[[ King of the Hill]]'', Hank removes an embarrassing photograph from all his neighbor's local newspapers before they woke up that morning.

[[File:Agenda.jpg|thumb|Daily Agenda]]

A '''personal organizer''', '''day planner''', '''personal analog assistant''', '''personal planner''', '''year planner''', '''bullet journal''', or '''agenda''' (from Latin ''agenda'' - things to do), is a small book or binder that is designed to be portable. It usually contains a [[diary (stationery)|diary]], [[calendar]], [[address book]], blank paper, and other sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/personal+organizers|last=Farlex|title=The Free Dictionary: personal organizer|date=2018|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The organizer is a personal tool and may also include pages with useful information, such as maps and telephone codes. It is related to the separate desktop stationery items that have one or more of the same functions, such as appointment calendars, [[rolodex]]es, [[notebook]]s, and [[almanacs]].

By the end of the 20th century, paper-and-binder personal organizers started to be replaced by electronic devices such as [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs), [[personal information manager]] software, and [[online organizer]]s. This process has accelerated in the beginning of the 21st century with the advent of [[smartphones]], [[tablet computer]]s, [[smartwatch]]es and a variety of [[mobile app]]s.

{{History of American football}}
The '''Pro Football Hall of Fame''' is the [[hall of fame]] for [[professional football (gridiron)|professional]] [[American football]], located in [[Canton, Ohio]]. Opened in 1963, the Hall of Fame enshrines exceptional figures in the sport of professional football, including players, coaches, franchise owners, and front-office personnel, almost all of whom made their primary contributions to the game in the [[National Football League]] (NFL); the Hall inducts between four and eight new enshrinees each year. The Hall of Fame's Mission is to "Honor the Heroes of the Game, Preserve its History, Promote its Values &amp; Celebrate Excellence EVERYWHERE." 

With the election of the Class of 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/heroes-of-the-game/class-of-2018/|title=Class of 2018 {{!}} Pro Football Hall of Fame Official Site|website=www.profootballhof.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Bobby Beathard]], [[Robert Brazile]], [[Brian Dawkins]], [[Jerry Kramer]], [[Ray Lewis]], [[Randy Moss]], [[Terrell Owens]] and [[Brian Urlacher]] – there are a total of 318 members of the Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="List"&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Hall of Fame members|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/heroes-of-the-game/years/|accessdate=February 6, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65FlRedOq?url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/alphabetical.aspx|archivedate=February 6, 2012|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Football Hall of Fame.JPG|thumb|left|Old entrance to The Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio]]
The community of [[Canton, Ohio]] successfully lobbied the NFL to have the Hall of Fame built in their city for two reasons: first, the NFL was founded in Canton in 1920 (at that time it was known as the [[American Professional Football Association]]); second, the now-defunct [[Canton Bulldogs]] were a successful NFL team based in Canton during the first few years of the league. Groundbreaking for the building was held on August 11, 1962. The original building contained just two rooms, and {{convert|19000|sqft|m2|-2}} of interior space.&lt;ref name="PFHOF: Then and Now"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pro Football Hall of Fame: Then and Now|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hall/release.aspx?release_id=932|publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame|accessdate=February 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65FklLKND?url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hall/release.aspx?release_id=932|archivedate=February 6, 2012|date=January 1, 2005|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1970, ground was broken for the first of many expansions. This first expansion cost [[US$|$]]620,000, and was completed in May 1971. The size was increased to {{convert|34000|sqft|m2|-2}} by adding another room. The pro shop opened with this expansion. This was also an important milestone for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, as yearly attendance passed the 200,000 mark for the first time. This was at least in some part due to the increase in popularity of professional football caused by the advent of the [[American Football League]] and its success in the final two [[Professional American football championship games|AFL-NFL World Championship]] games.&lt;ref name="PFHOF: Then and Now"/&gt;

[[Image:PFootballHall of fame original dome entrance.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Inside the original structure in 2008.]]
In November 1977, work began on another expansion project, costing US$1,200,000. It was completed in November 1978, enlarging the gift shop and research library, while doubling the size of the theater. The total size of the hall was now {{convert|50500|sqft|m2|-1}}, more than 2.5 times the original size.&lt;ref name="PFHOF: Then and Now"/&gt;

The building remained largely unchanged until July 1993. The Hall then announced yet another expansion, costing US$9,200,000, and adding a fifth room. This expansion was completed in October 1995. The building's size was increased to {{convert|82307|sqft|m2|0}}. The most notable addition was the ''GameDay Stadium'', which shows an [[NFL Films]] production on a {{convert|20|ft|m|sing=on}} by {{convert|42|ft|m|sing=on}} [[Cinemascope]] screen.&lt;ref name="PFHOF: Then and Now"/&gt;

In 2013, the Hall of Fame completed its largest expansion and renovation today. Currently, the Hall of Fame consists of 118,000 square feet.

An $800 million expansion project, Johnson Controls Hall of Fame Village, is underway and will be completed to coincide with the NFL's Centennial in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tendler|first1=Alexandra|title=$800 million 'Disneyland' for football will open in 2020, NFL Hall of Fame pres. says|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2017/07/27/800-million-disneyland-for-football-will-open-in-2020-nfl-hall-fame-pres-says.html|website=FoxBusiness.com|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inductees==
[[Image:Pro Football hall of Fame inductee display.jpg|thumb|left|The Hall is made up of several sections, at heart is the display of inductees.]]
{{main article|List of Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees}}
Through 2018, all inductees except one, played some part of their professional career in the NFL (the lone exception is [[Buffalo Bills]] guard [[Billy Shaw]], who played his entire career in the [[American Football League]] (AFL) prior to the 1970 [[AFL–NFL merger]]). Though several Hall of Famers have had AFL, [[Canadian Football League]], [[World Football League]], [[United States Football League]], [[Arena Football League]] and/or [[Indoor Football League]] experience, and there is a division of the Hall devoted to alternative leagues such as this, to this point no players have made the Hall without having made significant contributions to either the NFL, AFL or [[All-America Football Conference]]. For CFL stars, there is a parallel [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]]; only one player ([[Warren Moon]]) and one coach ([[Bud Grant]]) are in both halls.

The [[Chicago Bears]] have the most Hall of Famers among the league's franchises with either 34 or 28 enshrinees depending on whether you count players that only played a small portion of their careers with the team .&lt;ref name=ChicagoBears&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago Bears: Team History|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.aspx?TeamAlias=chicago-bears&amp;InfoTab=History|publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame|accessdate=February 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65Fm9pmbM?url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.aspx?TeamAlias=chicago-bears&amp;InfoTab=History|archivedate=February 6, 2012|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection process===

====Selection Committee====
Enshrinees are selected by a 48-person committee, largely made up of media members, officially known as the Selection Committee.&lt;ref name="Selection Process"&gt;{{cite web|title=Selection Process|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/selectionprocess.aspx|publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame|accessdate=February 6, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65FmNMFy5?url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/selectionprocess.aspx|archivedate=February 6, 2012|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each city that has a current NFL team sends one representative from the local media to the committee. A city with more than one franchise sends a representative for each franchise. 

There are also 15 at-large delegates including one representative from the [[Pro Football Writers Association]]. Except for the PFWA representative, who is appointed to a two-year term, all other appointments are open-ended and terminated only by death, incapacitation, retirement, or resignation.&lt;ref name="Selection Process"/&gt;

====Voting procedure====
[[Image:Hall Fame Air.JPG|300|thumb|right|[[Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium]] with the Hall of Fame in lower right]]

To be eligible for the nominating process, a player or coach must have been retired for at least five years. Any other contributor such as a team owner or executive can be voted in at any time.&lt;ref name="Selection Process FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Selection Process FAQ|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/SelectionProcessFAQ.aspx|publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame|accessdate=February 6, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65Fmpnt9n?url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/SelectionProcessFAQ.aspx|archivedate=February 6, 2012|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fans may nominate any player, coach or contributor by simply writing to the Pro Football Hall of Fame via letter or email. The Selection Committee is then polled three times by mail to eventually narrow the list to 25 semifinalists: once in March, once in September, and once in October. In November, the committee then selects 15 finalists by mail balloting. A Seniors and Contributors Committee, subcommittees of the overall Selection Committee, nominate Seniors (those players who completed their careers more than 25 years ago) and Contributors (individuals who made contributions to the game in areas other than playing or coaching).  The Seniors Committee and Contributors Committee add two or one finalist(s) on alternating years which makes a final ballot of 18 finalists under consideration by the full committee each year.&lt;ref name="Selection Process FAQ"/&gt; Committee members are instructed to only consider a candidate's professional football contributions and to disregard all other factors.&lt;ref name=ojhof&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20126215/for-oj-simpson-welcome-mat-pro-football-hall-fame-canton-out|title=Canton welcome mat still out for O.J. Simpson|work=ESPN.com|date=July 21, 2017|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Selection Committee then meets on "Selection Saturday," the day before each [[Super Bowl]] game to elect a new class. To be elected, a finalist must receive at least 80 percent support from the Board, with at least four, but no more than eight, candidates being elected annually. Once a contributor is inducted into the Hall, they cannot be banished and remain an inductee forever.&lt;ref name=ojhof/&gt;

===Enshrinement ceremony===
[[File:Hall of Fame Football (1987.572.1).jpg|thumb|left|A football signed by the 1974 Pro Football Hall of Fame enshrinement class]]

The enshrinement ceremony is usually held during the first full weekend in August. An enshrinement celebration is held throughout the week in Canton surrounding the enshrinement ceremony.&lt;ref name="Enshrinement festival"&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinement Festival Schedule|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/enshrinement/festivalschedule.aspx|publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame|accessdate=February 6, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65FqiEKaF?url=http://www.profootballhof.com/enshrinement/festivalschedule.aspx|archivedate=February 6, 2012|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enshrinees do not go into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a member of a certain team. Rather, all of an enshrinee's affiliations are listed equally.&lt;ref name="Selection Process FAQ"/&gt; While the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] plaques generally depict each of their inductees wearing a particular club's cap (with a few exceptions, such as [[Catfish Hunter]] and [[Greg Maddux]]), the bust sculptures of each Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee make no reference to any specific team. In addition to the bust that goes on permanent display at the Hall of Fame, inductees receive a distinctive Gold Jacket and previous inductees nearly always wear theirs when participating at new inductee ceremonies.

Previous induction ceremonies were held during the next day (Sunday from 1999–2005, Saturday in 2006), situated on the steps of the Hall of Fame building. Starting in 2002, the ceremony was moved to Fawcett Stadium (now [[Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium]]), where it was held from 1963 to 1965. Since 2007, the enshrinement ceremony has been held on the Saturday night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Class of 2007 Presenters|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/enshrinement/story.aspx?story_id=2454|accessdate=February 6, 2012|newspaper=Pro Football Hall of Fame|date=July 2, 2007|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65FnYvIuO?url=http://www.profootballhof.com/enshrinement/story.aspx?story_id=2454|archivedate=February 6, 2012|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hall of Fame Game==
{{main article|Pro Football Hall of Fame Game}}
The Hall of Fame Game, the annual NFL preseason opener, is played in Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton, Ohio. In 2017, the Hall of Fame Game was held for the first time on Thursday night. The preseason classic kicks off Enshrinement Week Powered by Johnson Controls and officially kicks off the [[NFL preseason]].

==Criticism==
[[Image:Profootballhalloffame USFL areas.jpg|thumb|The "Other Leagues" display includes the [[United States Football League|USFL]]; inductee [[Jim Kelly]]'s jersey is in the foreground.]]

The Pro Football Hall of Fame uses only media representatives to select inductees. This, along with its policy of inducting only a maximum of seven players a year (six in certain years past), with a current maximum of two "senior" candidates and five "non-seniors," has been criticized by sports columnists, former players, and football fans.&lt;ref name="Enshrinement festival"/&gt; Such critics would like to see solutions such as expanding the number of selectors, rotating panel members on and off the selection committee, and allowing former players to participate in the voting.&lt;ref name="Joyner"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/sports/football/25score.html?_r=1 |work=The New York Times |first=K C |last=Joyner |title=A Case for Ray Guy Belonging in Pro Football Hall of Fame |date=January 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small number of candidates elected each year has helped foster what some perceive as an inequality of representation at certain positions or in certain categories of player, with defensive players in general and [[defensive back]]s and outside [[linebacker]]s in particular, [[special teams]] players, [[wide receiver]]s, deserving players who primarily played on bad teams, and those from the "seniors" category, being slighted. This has included a 2009 ''[[New York Times]]'' article which criticized the Hall for not including [[Punter (American football)|punter]] [[Ray Guy]] on its ballot, also noting that the Hall did not have an inductee at the time representing the position.&lt;ref name="Joyner"/&gt; (At least two inductees, [[Sammy Baugh]] and [[Yale Lary]], punted in addition to playing other positions.) Guy was eventually inducted as part of the 2014 class for the Hall of Fame. There has also been criticism that certain players get overlooked because their team underproduced during their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/how-to-fix-footballs-hall-of-fame-voting-system/ |work=The New York Times |first=Andy |last=Barall |title=How to Fix Football's Hall of Fame Voting System |date=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pro Football Hall of Fame is unique among North American major league sports halls of fame in that [[Official (American football)|officials]] have generally been excluded from the Hall; only one, 1966 inductee [[Hugh "Shorty" Ray]], has been enshrined. The [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]], [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] and [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] have each inducted game officials as members. In part to rectify the lack of officials and other off-field contributors, the Hall of Fame added a “Contributors” committee beginning with the class of 2015, which will nominate officials, general managers, owners and other positions that have historically been overlooked by the committee at large.&lt;ref&gt;King, Peter (October 21, 2014). [http://mmqb.si.com/2014/10/21/pro-football-hall-of-fame-contributor-committee/ Behind the HOF’s New Contributor Committee]. ''SI.com''. Retrieved October 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prominent absence from the Hall is sports-journalist [[Howard Cosell]], who has yet to be awarded the [[Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award]] despite his well-known association with ''[[Monday Night Football]]''. An August 2010 ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' article hints that Cosell may have even been "blacklisted" by the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Billson |first=Marky |date=August 4, 2010 |title=As strange as it sounds, Howard Cosell has never won Rozelle award |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/football/nfl/08/02/cosell/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006210159/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/football/nfl/08/02/cosell/index.html |archivedate=October 6, 2010 |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |access-date=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://inducthowardcosell.blogspot.com/ |work=NFL Sports Blog |first=NFL |last=Researcher |title=Cronyism on the part of the NFL and the Pro Football Hall of Fame? |date=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the late 2010s approached, a number of controversial and polarizing figures began to reach eligibility for the Hall. [[Terrell Owens]]'s exclusion from the Hall in his first two years of eligibility despite his strong individual statistics was a subject of public debate.&lt;ref name="cbssports.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/one-hall-of-fame-voter-sheds-light-on-why-terrell-owens-didnt-make-it-in/|title=One Hall of Fame voter sheds light on why Terrell Owens didn't make it in|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owens was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2018 but refused to attend the enshrinement ceremony.

[[File:British Museum Great Court, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|View of the Great Court from the second floor of the southern wing.]]

The '''Queen Elizabeth II Great Court''', commonly referred to simply as the '''Great Court''', is the covered central [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] of the [[British Museum]] in London. It was redeveloped during the late 1990s to a design by [[Foster and Partners]], from a 1970s design by [[Colin St John Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, R. 2007. ''Colin St John Wilson: Buildings and Projects.'' London: Black Dog Publishing. p455. {{ISBN|978-1-904772-70-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court was opened by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 2000.

== Description ==
The court has a [[tessellation|tessellated]] glass roof designed by [[Buro Happold]]&lt;ref name=buro&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/projects/portfolio/archives/0103BritishMuseum.asp Queen Elizabeth II Great Court, British Museum], accessed 22 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and executed by [[Waagner-Biro]], covering the entire court and surrounds the original circular [[British Museum Reading Room]] in the centre, now a museum. It is the largest covered square in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Evening Standard (London)|date=12 August 2002|title=The firm that raised the roof|page=22|quote=The British Museum is one of Britain's most visited venues. To create more space, the Museum has made its historic round Reading Room the centrepiece of the largest covered courtyard in Europe. A spectacular glass and steel gridshell roof encloses the 6,700 sq metre (92m x 73m) courtyard and features more than 6,000 individual steel members connected at 1,800 nodes and 3,312 glazing panels.|author=Stephen Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; The glass and steel roof is made up of 4,878 unique steel members connected at 1,566 unique nodes and 1,656 pairs of glass windowpanes making up 6,100m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of glazing;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Millennium and Beyond|author=Steve Brown|publisher=The Structural Engineer|date=18 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; each of a unique shape because of the undulating nature of the roof.

Controversially, some of the stone in the court is from [[France]], rather than being [[Portland Stone]] from southern [[England]] as agreed in the original contract with the masons.

Within the Great Court, there are shops and a café. The court acts as a central  linking point for the museum, somewhat like [[I. M. Pei]]'s [[Louvre Pyramid]] in [[Paris]].

==Construction==
The central courtyard of the British Museum was occupied by the [[British Library]] until 1997 when it moved to St Pancras. At that time the entire courtyard was filled with bookshelves, three stories high (the 'Bookstacks'). To get from one side of the museum to the other visitors had to go round.

Once the Library had moved out, the bookstacks were cleared and the Great Court constructed in this central courtyard. A new 'ground' level was created, a storey higher than the original courtyard, with the space below used to accommodate the Clore Education Centre and the African galleries (which had been housed at the [[Museum of Mankind]] since 1970).

The South Portico was largely rebuilt, with two new lifts incorporated for disabled access to the upper levels of the museum.

A new gridshell glass roof was provided over the entire courtyard to create a covered space at the centre of the museum.

The British Library Reading Room at the centre of the courtyard was retained and refurbished for use as the Museum library and information centre. As the Reading room had no outer wall - the bookstacks coming right up to the back of the reading room shelves - a new outer wall was created to protect the Reading room, to support the new roof and the conceal the ventilation ducts serving the spaces below.

North of the Reading Room there is a block with a museum shop at ground level, a gallery for temporary exhibitions above and a restaurant above that, just below the glass roof.

== Education facilities ==

The Clore Education Centre is housed in the lower level of the Great Court. It comprises the:

* BP Lecture Theatre
* Hugh and Catherine Stevenson Theatre
* Raymond and Beverly Sackler seminar room
* Studio, used for art and craft activities
* Claus Moser seminar room
* Ford Centre for Young Visitors
* Samsung Digital Discovery Centre  

[[Nelson Mandela]] spoke at the inauguration of the [[BP]] Lecture Theatre on 16 November 2000. He supported the Museum's global role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mandela supported the British Museum’s global role|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Mandela-supported-the-British-Museums-global-role/31310|publisher=[[The Art Newspaper]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LgvUHYKR?url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Mandela-supported-the-British-Museums-global-role/31310|archivedate=7 December 2013|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sculptures ==

Upon the Great Court's opening to the public in 2000, twelve sculptures from the British Museum's collection were installed on the main floor of the concourse:

* A [[stela]] of the Assyrian King [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (9th century BC)
* A marble [[Lion of Knidos]], [[Asia Minor]] (3rd century BC)
* Two heads of Pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]] (circa 1400 BC)
* Two [[Obelisks of Nectanebo II|obelisks]] of the Egyptian King [[Nectanebo II]] (circa 350 BC)
* [[Hoa Hakananai'a]], a statue from [[Easter Island]] (Date unknown, but between 1200 and 1800 AD), later moved to Room 24
* Two [[Totem Pole (British Museum)|totem poles]] from British Columbia (19th Century AD)
* A Roman equestrian statue (2nd century AD)
* An Irish memorial slab carved in [[Ogham]] script (5th century AD)
* An Anglo-Saxon cross shaft (late 8th/early 9th century AD)
* A pair of Chinese guardian figures (17th century AD)
* A column base from [[Persepolis]] (5th Century BC)

There were initial plans for a new, thirteenth sculpture to be commissioned from [[Anish Kapoor]], but these were scrapped.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="729">'''R v Linekar''' [1995] 3 All ER 69 73 is a leading case in which the [[Court of Appeal]] ruled on cases of "[[Rape by deception|rape by fraud]]" in English law, and the extent to which deceit may be involved before it negates consent. The defendant agreed to pay for sexual intercourse with a prostitute but refused to pay afterward. The ruling retained the "very narrow" definition of rape that, although consent was based on payment, refusing to do so after the fact was only fraud not rape.

{{Discrimination sidebar|expanded=General}}
'''Religious discrimination''' is treating a person or group differently because of the beliefs they hold about a religion. This includes when adherents of different [[religion]]s, [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s or non-religions are treated unequally due to these beliefs, either before the [[Equality before the law|law]] or in institutional settings, such as employment or housing.

Religious discrimination is related to [[religious persecution]], the most extreme forms of which would include instances in which people have been executed for beliefs perceived to be [[heresy|heretic]]. Laws which only carry light punishments are described as ''mild forms of religious persecution'' or as ''religious discrimination''.

Even in societies where [[freedom of religion]] is a constitutional right, adherents of religious minorities sometimes voice concerns about religious discrimination against them. Insofar as legal policies are concerned, cases that are perceived as religious discrimination might be the result of an interference of the religious sphere with other spheres of the public that are regulated by law (and not aimed specifically against a religious minority).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==In Western countries==

===United States===
{{main|Religious discrimination in the United States}}
{{See|Anti-Catholicism in the United States|Antisemitism in the United States|Anti-atheist sentiment in the United States}}
In a 1979 consultation on the issue, the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] defined religious discrimination in relation to the [[civil rights]] guaranteed by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Whereas religious civil liberties, such as the right to hold or not to hold a religious belief, are essential for [[Freedom of Religion]] (in the United States secured by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]), religious discrimination occurs when someone is denied "the equal protection of the laws, equality of status under the law, equal treatment in the administration of justice, and equality of opportunity and access to employment, education, housing, public services and facilities, and public accommodation because of their exercise of their right to religious freedom".&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 1979: II&lt;/ref&gt;

However, cases of religious discrimination might also be the result of an interference of the religious sphere with other spheres of the public that are regulated by law. Although e.g. in the United States the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment]] states that ''"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"'', in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'' the U.S. supreme court decided that religious duty was not a suitable defense to a criminal indictment.  In this specific case a law against bigamy was not considered to be discriminating against [[Mormon]]s, who stopped practicing [[Polygamy]] in 1890.&lt;ref name="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/topic/polygamy |title=Polygamy |publisher=Mormonnewsroom.org |date=2007-07-24 |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], during 1995-1998, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] had only Christian schools (four of them, Pentecostal, Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist, and inter-denominational (Anglican, Salvation Army and United Church)). The right to organize publicly supported religious schools was only given to certain Christian denominations, thus tax money used to support a selected group of Christian denominations. The denominational schools could also refuse admission of a student or the hiring of a qualified teacher on purely religious grounds. [[Quebec]] has used two school systems, one Protestant and the other Roman Catholic, but it seems this system will be replaced with two secular school systems: one French and the other English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/related/Federal/ConstPat.asp?Language=E |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003195225/http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/related/Federal/ConstPat.asp?Language=E |archivedate=2006-10-03 |title=The Constitution Since Patriation |publisher=Parl.gc.ca |date=2006-10-03 |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ontario]] had two school systems going back before Confederation. The British North America Act (1867) gave the Provinces jurisdiction over education. Section 93 of the BNA Act offered constitutional protection for denominational schools as they existed in law at the time of Confederation. Like "Public schools", Catholic schools are fully funded from kindergarten to grade 12. However, profound demographic changes of the past few decades have made the province of Ontario a multicultural, multi-racial, and multi-religious society. The thought that one religious group is privileged to have schools funded from the public purse is becoming unacceptable in a pluralistic, multicultural, secular society. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ocsta.on.ca/ocsta/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/A-Short-History-of-Catholic-Schools-in-Ontario-Mark-McGowan.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304141235/http://www.ocsta.on.ca/ocsta/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/A-Short-History-of-Catholic-Schools-in-Ontario-Mark-McGowan.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian faith-based university, [[Trinity Western University]] is currently facing a challenge from members of the legal and [[LGBT]] community to its freedom to educate students in a private university context while holding certain "religious values", such as the freedom to discriminate against other people, including requiring students to sign a chastity oath, and denying LGBT students the same rights as straight students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/law-societies-must-show-more-courage-on-trinity-western-application/article16023053/|title=Law societies must show more courage on Trinity Western application|author=|date=|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/trinity-western-university-s-law-school-approved-by-b-c-law-society-1.2606964|title=B.C.

British Columbia College of Teachers]]) where the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that TWU was capable to teach professional disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1867/index.do|title=Trinity Western University v. British Columbia College of Teachers - SCC Cases (Lexum)|author=|date=|website=scc-csc.lexum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
{{further|Scientology in Germany}}
[[Scientology|Scientologists]] in Germany face specific political and economic restrictions. They are barred from membership in some major political parties, and businesses and other employers use so-called "sect filters" to expose a prospective business partner's or employee's association with the organization. German federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning Scientology in late 2007, but abandoned the initiative a year later, finding insufficient legal grounds. Despite this, polls suggest that most Germans favor banning Scientology altogether. The [[U.S. government]] has repeatedly raised concerns over discriminatory practices directed at individual Scientologists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barber|Barber (1997-01-30)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KentFGA&gt;[[#Kent2001|Kent (2001)]], pp. 3, 12–13 |&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USS1999"&gt;[[#USDSRF1999|U.S. Department of State (1999)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
In [[Greece]] since the [[Greek War of Independence|independence]] from the [[Ottoman Greece|Muslim Ottomans]] rule in the 19th century, the [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox Church]] has been given privileged status and only the Greek Orthodox church, Roman Catholic, some Protestant churches, Judaism and Islam are recognized religions. The Muslim minority alleges that Greece persistently and systematically discriminates against Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/1999/01/08/greece790.htm |title=Turkish Minority Rights Violated in Greece |publisher=Hrw.org |date=1999-01-08 |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/greece/ |title=The Turks of Western Thrace |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, professor Nick Drydakis ([[Anglia Ruskin University]]) examined religious affiliation and employment bias in Athens, by implementing an experimental field study. Labor market outcomes (occupation access, entry wage, and wait time for call back) were assessed for three religious minorities (Pentecostal, evangelical, and Jehovah's Witnesses). Results indicate that religious minorities experience employment bias Moreover, religious minorities face greater constraints on occupational access in more prestigious jobs compared to less prestigious jobs. Occupational access and entry wage bias is highest for religious minority women. In all cases, Jehovah's Witnesses face the greatest bias; female employers offered significantly lower entry wages to Jehovah's Witnesses than male employers.&lt;ref&gt;Drydakis Nick (2010) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-5906.2010.01523.x Religious Affiliation and Labour Bias.] Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 49, 472-488.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
According to a ''Human Rights Practices'' report by the ''U.S. State department'' on [[Mexico]] note that "some local officials infringe on religious freedom, especially in the south". There is conflict between Catholic/Mayan syncretists and Protestant evangelicals in the [[Chiapas]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/wha/8320.htm |title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices |publisher=State.gov |date=2002-03-04 |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991002222613/http://www.baptistfire.com/articles/other/mexico.shtml|title=BaptistFire - Persecution in Mexico|author=|date=2 October 1999|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/www/global/human_rights/irf/irf_rpt/1999/irf_mexico99.html |title=U.S. Department of State Annual Report on International Religious Freedom for 1999: Mexico |publisher=State.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Middle East==

===Iraq===
[[Assyrians in Iraq|Assyrian]] Christians have suffered from discrimination since [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Ba'athist Arabization campaigns in North Iraq|Arabization policies in the 1980s]], with the latest instance of discrimination being the [[ISIS]] invasion of the Nineveh plains and [[Fall of Mosul|Mosul]], where tens of thousands have been forced to flee, and multiple Christian sites have been destroyed. The number of Christians in [[Iraq]] overall since the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 invasion]] has dropped by around 60%, from 800,000 to 300,000, and in 1987, that number was around 1.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iz.htmlz{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 invasion by ISIS has likely degraded that number further.

Sunni Muslims have also fallen victim to persecution from the majority Shia population of Iraq, which may have led to the ISIS invasion. {{clarification needed|date=May 2017}} {{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Turkey===
{{Original research|section|date=May 2015}}Historically, [[Racism in Turkey|religious discrimination in Turkey]] has been a serious issue, with the [[Armenian Genocide|Armenian]], [[Greek Genocide|Greek]], and [[Assyrian Genocide]]s all occurring there. Discrimination has continued during the [[Syrian Civil War]]. In one instance, Turkey allowed members of [[Al Nusra]], a radical Islamic terror group that controls land in Syria, to enter through its border, and then into the majority Armenian Christian town of [[Kessab]], which is right on the Turkish–Syrian border. Al Nusra raided the town, capturing those who didn't flee. They proceeded to take their captives to the Turkish city of Iskenderun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armradio.am/en/2015/03/21/kessab-armenians-in-diaspora-remember-their-quaint-town-in-syria/|title=Kessab Armenians in Diaspora remember their quaint town in Syria|author=|date=21 March 2015|website=armradio.am}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11324061/Syria-video-dispatch-Kessab-churches-burned-and-graves-destroyed.html|title=Syria video dispatch: Kessab churches burned and graves destroyed|first1=Ruth Sherlock 11:54AM GMT 04 Jan 2015 Follow !function{var|last1=js|first2=|last2=fjs=d.getElementsByTagName;if){js=d.createElement;js.id=id;js.src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore;}};|date=4 January 2015|website=telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Religious discrimination in Pakistan}}
[[Religious discrimination in Pakistan]] is a serious issue. Several incidents of discrimination have been recorded with some finding support by the state itself.

The '''San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park''' is located in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], United States. The park includes a fleet of historic vessels, a visitor center, a maritime museum, and a library/research facility. The park used to be referred to as the '''San Francisco Maritime Museum''', however the former 1951 name changed in 1978 when the collections were acquired by the [[National Park Service]]. Today's San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park was authorized in 1988; the maritime museum is among the park's many cultural resources. The park also incorporates the [[Aquatic Park Historic District]], bounded by Van Ness Avenue, Polk Street, and Hyde Street.

==Historic vessel fleet==
The historic fleet of the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park is moored at the park's [[Hyde Street Pier]]. The fleet consists of the following major vessels:

*''[[Balclutha (1886)|Balclutha]]'', an 1886 built square rigged sailing ship.
*''[[C.A. Thayer (1895)|C.A. Thayer]]'', an 1895 built schooner.
*''[[Eureka (1890)|Eureka]]'', an 1890 built steam ferryboat.
*''[[Alma (1891)|Alma]]'', an 1891 built scow schooner.
*''[[Hercules (1907)|Hercules]]'', a 1907 built steam tug.
*''[[Eppleton Hall (1914)|Eppleton Hall]]'', a 1914 built paddlewheel tug.

Image:C A Thayer.JPG|&lt;center&gt;Lumber schooner ''[[C.A. Thayer (1895)|C.A. Thayer]]''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The fleet also includes over one hundred small craft.

==Visitor Center==
The Visitor Center is housed in the park's 1909 waterfront warehouse, located at the corner of Hyde and Jefferson Streets. The City of San Francisco declared the four-story brick structure a historic landmark in 1974, and the building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1975. Inside, exhibits (including a first order [[Fresnel lens|Fresnel lighthouse lens]] and a shipwrecked boat) tell the story of San Francisco's colorful and diverse maritime heritage. The visitor center also contains a theater and a ranger-staffed information desk.

==Maritime Museum==
[[File:ENTRANCE - Aquatic Park Bathhouse, Beach Street, West of Polk Street, San Francisco, San Francisco County, CA HABS CAL,38-SANFRA,157-3.tif|thumb|Aquatic Park Bathhouse]]
The maritime museum was until recently housed in a [[Streamline Moderne]] (late [[Art Deco]]) building that is the centerpiece of the [[Aquatic Park Historic District]], a [[National Historic Landmark]] at the foot of Polk Street and a minute's walk from the visitor center and Hyde Street Pier. The building was originally built (starting in 1936) by the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] as a public [[Public bathing|bathhouse]], and its interior is decorated with fantastic and colorful murals, created primarily by artist and color theoretician [[Hilaire Hiler]].  The architects were William Mooser Jr. and William Mooser III.

==Maritime Research Center==
The Maritime Research Center is the premier resource for San Francisco and Pacific Coast maritime history. Originating in 1939, the collections have become the largest maritime collection on the West Coast and the largest museum and research collection in the National Park Service.

The collections include more than:
* 35,000 published titles comprising over 74,000 items
* 500,000 photographs
* 7,000 archival and manuscript collections
* 150,000 naval architecture and marine engineering drawings
* 3,000 maps and charts
* 150,000 feet of motion picture film and video
* 6,000 historical archaeology artifacts
* 2,500 pieces of folk and fine art
* 40,000 history objects
* 100 small craft
* 50,000 pieces of ephemera
* 600 oral histories and audio recordings

==Supporting associations==
The park is supported by several cooperating associations. One of these is the [[San Francisco Maritime National Park Association]].

==Location and access==
The Visitors Center, [[Hyde Street Pier]] and Maritime Museum are all situated adjacent to the foot of Hyde Street and at the western end of the [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]] district. The park headquarters and Maritime Research Center are located in [[Fort Mason]], some 10 minutes walk to the west of the other sites. The Beach and Hyde Street terminal of the [[San Francisco cable car system]] adjoins the main site, while the Jones Street terminal of the [[F Market|F Market historic streetcar line]] is some 5 minutes walk to the east.

Opening times and fees for the various sites can be found on the park's website, see 'External links' below.

===Open Water Swimming===
Aquatic Park is a popular place for open water [[human swimming|swimming]], both for recreation and training.  The [[South End Rowing Club]] and Dolphin Club are located in Aquatic Park. Recently there have been several incidents of swimmers being bitten by sea lions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1252">In [[classical Chinese]] [[philology]], '''''shengxun''''' (聲訓 "voice explanation") or '''''yinxun''''' (音訓 "sound explanation") is the practice of explaining a [[Chinese character|character]] by using a [[homophone]] or near-homophone. The practice is ancient, and can be seen in pre-[[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] texts. Xu Shen, author of the monumental ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', employed ''shengxun''. For example, when Xu explained the word "ghost", he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;big&gt;人所歸爲鬼&lt;/big&gt; (A ghost is where (the state that) human beings return to)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
歸 ("to return to"; ''guī'') and 鬼("ghost"; ''guǐ'') are near-homophones. (A similar explanation of the word can be found in the earlier ''[[Erya]]''.)

The ancient [[Chinese dictionary]] ''[[Shiming]]'' is noted for using ''shengxun'' for most of its definitions.

''Shengxun'' can be highly fanciful, and often results in [[folk etymology]]. However, the practice points to the idea of "cognate characters" (同源字) or what [[Bernhard Karlgren]] called "word families".

'''''Słownik etymologiczny języka polskiego''''' (''Etymological Dictionary of the Polish Language'') is an [[etymological dictionary]] first published in 1927.  It was compiled by [[Aleksander Brückner]] and served through the 20th century as a principal [[Polish language|Polish]] etymological dictionary.  

Though now to some extent superseded by more recent efforts, it remains serviceable.

[[File:Cook's Timetable 1888 cover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cover of the December 1888 edition]]

The '''''European Rail Timetable''''', more commonly known by its former names, the '''''Thomas Cook European Timetable''''', the '''''Thomas Cook Continental Timetable''''' or simply '''''Cook's Timetable''''', is an international [[Public transport timetable|timetable]] of selected passenger [[Rail transport|rail]] schedules for every country in [[Europe]], along with a small amount of such content from areas outside Europe.  It also includes regularly scheduled passenger shipping services and a few [[Coach (scheduled transport)|intercity bus (coach)]] services on routes where rail services are not operated.  Except during World War II, it has been in continuous publication since 1873.  Until 2013 it was published by [[Thomas Cook Group|Thomas Cook Publishing]],&lt;ref name=IRJ-2013nov1/&gt; in the [[United Kingdom]], and since 1883 has been issued monthly.&lt;ref name="JRTR"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fox | first=Brendan | title=Thomas Cook Timetables–Covering the World | date=September 2009 | magazine=Japan Railway &amp; Transport Review | volume=53 | publisher= East Japan Railway Culture Foundation | pages=18–23 | issn= 1342-7512 | url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr53/pdf/18-23_web.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The longstanding inclusion of "Continental" in the title reflected the fact that coverage was, for many years, mostly limited to [[continental Europe]].  Information on rail services in [[Great Britain]] was limited to only about 30 pages (out of about 400-plus pages) until 1954 and then omitted entirely until 1970.  June 2011 marked the 1500th edition.&lt;ref name=1500th&gt;{{cite web | title=European Rail Timetable 1500th Edition | date=2 June 2011 | publisher=[[Thomas Cook Group|Thomas Cook Publishing]] | url=http://www.thomascookpublishing.com/Blog/archive/2011/06/european-rail-timetable-1500th-edition/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808044855/http://www.thomascookpublishing.com/Blog/archive/2011/06/european-rail-timetable-1500th-edition/ |archivedate=8 August 2011|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although minor changes to the publication's title have been made over the years, every version included "Continental", rather than "European", from 1873 through 1987 — except for a brief period (1977–1980) when the coverage was expanded to worldwide and the name became the ''Thomas Cook International Timetable''.  From 1981, most non-European content was moved into a new publication named the ''Thomas Cook Overseas Timetable''. "Rail" was added to the title only relatively recently, in 2005, making it the '''''Thomas Cook European Rail Timetable''''', but its coverage continued to include some non-rail content, such as passenger shipping and [[ferry]] timetables.  The ''Timetable'' has been recommended by several editors of [[Guide book|travel guide books]] for Europe, one of whom described it as "the most revered and accurate railway reference in existence".&lt;ref name=birnbaum1991&gt;{{cite book | editor=Birnbaum, Stephen | editor-link=Stephen Birnbaum| title=Birnbaum's Europe 1991 | year=1990 | page=60 | publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin Company]] | location=Boston | isbn=0-395-55732-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2013, Thomas Cook announced that it would cease publishing the ''Timetable'' and all of its other publications, in accordance with a decision to close the company's publishing business altogether.&lt;ref name=indttc&gt;{{cite news | first = Simon | last = Calder | authorlink = Simon Calder | title = Thomas Cook's European Rail timetable reaches end of the line | newspaper = [[The Independent]] | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/thomas-cooks-european-rail-timetable-reaches-end-of-the-line-8682078.html | date = 1 July 2013 | accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final Thomas Cook edition of the ''Timetable'' was published in August 2013.&lt;ref name=telegraph2013aug&gt;{{cite news|last=McClarence|first=Stephen|title=The end of the line for Thomas Cook's rail 'bible': After 140 years Thomas Cook has finally called time on its European Rail Timetable |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=29 August 2013|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/journeysbyrail/10273162/The-end-of-the-line-for-Thomas-Cooks-rail-bible.html |accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=saved-telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Soo|title=European Rail Timetable 'saved'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/10424698/European-Rail-Timetable-saved.html|accessdate=17 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the end of October it was announced that publication would resume, independent of Thomas Cook Group, in February 2014 as a result of agreements that had been reached allowing the formation of a new company for that purpose, European Rail Timetable Limited.&lt;ref name=IRJ-2013nov1&gt;{{cite news|last=Briginshaw|first=David|title=European Rail Timetable to be re-launched in February|url=http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/europe/european-rail-timetable-to-be-re-launched-in-february.html?channel=542|accessdate=17 November 2013|newspaper=[[International Railway Journal]]|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=saved-telegraph/&gt; The new company is owned by John Potter, who was a member of the former editorial staff.&lt;ref name=saved-telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-7march2014&gt;{{cite news|last=Cassidy|first=Nigel|title=Back on schedule: Europe's InterRail timetable is re-born|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-26475256|accessdate=9 March 2014|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new version does not include Thomas Cook in its title.  The first issue compiled by the new company was published in March 2014, with the publication title now being '''''European Rail Timetable'''''.&lt;ref name=ERT-2014Mar4&gt;{{cite web|title=News Update - 4th March 2014|url=http://www.europeanrailtimetable.eu/home.html|publisher=European Rail Timetable Ltd.|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and overview ==
The idea that [[Thomas Cook &amp; Son]] should publish a [[compendium]] of railway and steamship timetables for continental Europe was proposed by Cook employee John Bredall and approved by John Mason Cook, son of company founder [[Thomas Cook]].  The first issue was published in March 1873,&lt;ref name="JRTR"/&gt; under the title ''Cook's Continental Time Tables &amp; Tourist's Handbook''.&lt;ref name=keydates&gt;{{cite web | title=Thomas Cook History: Key Dates | publisher= [[Thomas Cook Group]] | url=http://www.thomascook.com/about-us/thomas-cook-history/key-dates/ | accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bateson | first= E.W. | title=Bibliography of English Literature, Volume III (1800–1900) | year=1940 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | location=London | page=845 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uak8AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA845&amp;ots=A0Y11jB6NF&amp;dq=%22Cook's%20Continental%20Time%20Tables%22&amp;pg=PA845#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Cook's%20Continental%20Time%20Tables%22&amp;f=false | accessdate=7 February 2012 | isbn=0-521-04501-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first [[Editing|editor]], part-time only, was John Bredall. The title was later altered to ''Cook's Continental Time Tables, Tourist's Handbook and Steamship Tables''. Publication was quarterly until the beginning of 1883, and monthly thereafter.  Except for a break during [[World War II]], publication has continued to be monthly ever since 1883.&lt;ref name="JRTR"/&gt;  The ''Timetable'' has only had six [[Editor-in-chief|editors-in-chief]] in its history.  John Bredall was followed in 1914 by C. H. Davies.&lt;ref name="JRTR"/&gt; Later editors were H. V. Francis (1946–52), John H. Price (1952–85, then Managing Editor until 1988),&lt;ref name=price-obit&gt;"John Price" (obituary of). ''[[Tramways &amp; Urban Transit]]'' magazine, December 1998, p. 478.  [[Ian Allan Publishing]].  {{ISSN|1460-8324}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Brendan H. Fox (1985–2013), and John Potter (since 2014).  So as to remain sufficiently compact that it can be easily carried by a railway traveller, the ''Timetable'' does not show every scheduled train and every line for each country, but shows all major lines and most minor lines.&lt;ref name=lets-go-italy/&gt;  It has always been a [[Paperback|softcover]] book.

[[World War I]] did not interrupt publication, but emphasis during the war was shifted more to shipping services, the result of disruption of rail service in several countries.  During World War II, however, the timetable's publication was suspended, the last prewar issue being that of August 1939.  Publication resumed in 1946.&lt;ref name="JRTR"/&gt;&lt;ref name=1500th/&gt;

Cook's chief competitor, ''[[Bradshaw's Railway Guide|Bradshaw's Continental Railway Guide]]'', also ceased publication in 1939, but did not resume after the war (A Bradshaw Guide covering just the United Kingdom survived until 1961). This improved the potential for significant increase in sales of the ''Cook's Timetable'' in the postwar period, and Thomas Cook began to offer it in the form of a monthly subscription, in addition to selling individual copies.&lt;ref name="JRTR"/&gt;

==Title changes==
From January 1919, the title was altered slightly, to ''Cook's Continental Time-Table''.  The apostrophe was dropped in 1956, and "time-table" also became one word.  Subsequent name changes were made as follows:
*''Thomas Cook Continental Timetable'', mid-1974 through 1976
*'' Thomas Cook International Timetable'' ({{ISSN|0141-2701}}), 1977–80
*''Thomas Cook Continental Timetable'', ({{ISSN|0144-7467}}), 1981–87
*''Thomas Cook European Timetable'' ({{ISSN|0952-620X}}), 1988–2004
*''Thomas Cook European Rail Timetable'' (ISSN unchanged), 2005–13
*''European Rail Timetable'' ({{ISSN|1748-0817}}), 2014–

The "International" name was short-lived, as the non-European content that had prompted the adoption of that name was moved into a new publication at the beginning of 1981, the ''Thomas Cook Overseas Timetable'' ({{ISSN|0144-7475}}).&lt;ref name="JRTR"/&gt;

The ''Continental Timetable'' became the ''European Timetable'' in January 1988. Although "Rail" was added to the title in 2005, the ''Timetable'' continues to include principal passenger shipping services and a few coach (intercity bus) services, as before, and its ISSN did not change in 2005.&lt;ref name="JRTR"/&gt;

==Content and format changes==
Coverage of [[Great Britain]]/the [[United Kingdom]] was originally very limited, and in the period 1954–70 it was excluded altogether.  ''[[Bradshaw's Railway Guide]]'' had been publishing railway timetables for Britain since 1839, and continued to do so until 1961.  [[British Rail]] was publishing its own timetable book, so even after ''Bradshaw's'' ceased publication, ''Cook's Timetable'' continued to cover only the continent. However, by the end of that decade Thomas Cook Publishing had decided it would be worthwhile to include in its ''Timetable'' a section covering the principal British services, and 64 pages of tables were added for this purpose in 1970.&lt;ref name="JRTR"/&gt;

Following the example of some of the national railway companies on the continent (starting with Italy in 1898), the use of a [[24-hour clock]] for train arrival and departure times was adopted by ''Cook's Timetable'' in December 1919.  It was the first timetable book in Britain to adopt this practice.&lt;ref name="JRTR"/&gt;

Although railway timetables have always been its predominant content, the ''Cook's Timetable'' included a substantial amount of other information during the first decades of the 20th century.  The August 1939 edition, for example, devoted 48 of its 520 pages to general travel information, and regularly scheduled passenger shipping routes took 130 pages.&lt;ref name="JRTR"/&gt;  In later decades, content other than railway timetables has continued to be included, but on a smaller scale.  Shipping services consumed only about 30–35 pages in 1963&lt;ref name=feb63&gt;''Cooks Continental Timetable'', February 1963 issue.&lt;/ref&gt; and general travel information consumed about 15–20 pages after the post-war resumption of publication.

A graphic of a [[24-hour clock]] was part of the cover design from December 1919 through 1975. The final Thomas Cook iteration is at lower right.]]
A longstanding regular inclusion was a section giving [[passport]] and [[Visa (document)|visa]] requirements for each European country, as applicable to travellers from different countries, taking about 4–8 pages.  Other longtime regular features included a summary of [[baggage]] and [[customs]] regulations for each country, information on foreign [[Currency|currencies]] and a table giving the annual rainfall and average monthly high and low temperatures for each of about 150–200 European cities.&lt;ref name=var&gt;Various issues, ''Cook's Continental Timetable'' and ''Thomas Cook European Timetable''.&lt;/ref&gt;   Some of these features, although included in the ''Timetable'' for more than a century, were scaled-back in the 1990s or 2000s, after such information became available in greater detail on the Internet, or because of the simplification of [[border control]] and currencies under the [[European Union]].  Added in about 1990 was a brief, five-language glossary of words often used by railway travellers.  A one-page list of scenic rail routes is another regular inclusion.  Included since at least 1949 is a multi-page section with small maps of several cities that have more than one [[Train station|station]],&lt;ref name=seat61&gt;{{cite web | title=The Thomas Cook European Rail Timetable | publisher=[[The Man in Seat Sixty-One]] (travel website) | url=http://www.seat61.com/Thomas-Cook-European-Timetable.htm | accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing the locations of the principal rail lines and stations — and also showing [[Rapid transit|metro]] or [[tram]] lines connecting stations, where available, to help travellers who need to go between stations to continue their journeys.  The number of cities covered by this section has varied over time, between about 30 and 60.&lt;ref name=var/&gt;

Among the changes implemented in the immediate post-war period was that timetables were numbered, by route.&lt;ref name="JRTR"/&gt; Previously, tables had been simply headed by the names of the major cities served by the route.  Numbering of timetables is a common practice now.  Initially, the maps for each country or region remained unaltered, not showing the timetable numbers. This changed with the issue of 23 May 1954, which introduced a set of 15 new "index maps"&amp;nbsp;– in place of 10 maps previously included&amp;nbsp;– all drawn in a new style, showing only the railway lines covered by the ''Timetable'' and with individual timetable numbers marked for each line on the maps.&lt;ref name=23may54&gt;Price, J. H. (May 1954). "Stop Press [regular section summarising significant changes in each issue, mostly to transport services]:  New maps". ''Cook's Continental Timetable'', 23 May – 17 June 1954 issue, p. 8.  [[Thomas Cook and Son|Thomas Cook &amp; Son, Ltd]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Sections in which timetables for certain types of long-distance services are grouped are another longtime regular feature, with a section on "[[Motorail|car–sleeper train]]s" and one covering major [[Lists of named passenger trains|named international trains]].&lt;ref name=seat61/&gt;  After the launch of the [[Trans Europ Express|Trans-Europe Express]] (TEE) network, a section covering just TEE trains was added, designated Table 10, and this table was changed to a [[EuroCity]] table when ECs replaced most of the then-remaining TEE services at the start of the railways' summer timetable period on 31 May 1987.&lt;ref name=may87&gt;''Thomas Cook Continental Timetable'', May 1987 issue, pp. 65 and 472.&lt;/ref&gt;

The February through May editions include a section, at the back of the issue, giving planned schedules for the forthcoming summer timetable period on main international routes, for the benefit of persons doing advance planning of a summer travel itinerary,&lt;ref name=birnbaum1991/&gt; subject to the railway companies of the various countries providing the information sufficiently far enough ahead of time for this "supplement". Similarly, the October and November editions include a supplement showing the planned winter schedules on major routes, for the railway operators' winter timetable period.  This practice of including advance summer and winter supplements in ''Cook's Timetable'' in the 2–3 months before those seasonal changes took effect started in 1958.&lt;ref name="JRTR"/&gt;

Around 1970, listings began to use local place-name spellings instead of [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] versions for some – but not yet all – cities for which an [[English language|English]] spelling existed. For example, [[the Hague]] became {{Lang|nl|Den Haag}}, and [[Munich]] became {{Lang|de|München}}. This change was made in steps, not all at once. It was applied to all Italian cities, such as {{Lang|it|[[Florence|Firenze]]}} and {{Lang|it|[[Naples|Napoli]]}}, with effect from the 26 May 1974 edition.&lt;ref name=29mar74&gt;Price, J. H. (March 1974). "Editorial". ''Cooks Continental Timetable'', 29 March – 30 April 1974 issue, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-1975 the transition to local place-name spellings throughout the book had been completed.  Distances between stations, shown in each route's timetable, were expressed in miles until the 1970s, but were changed to kilometres in 1976.&lt;ref name=july76&gt;Price, J. H. (July 1976). "Editorial". ''Thomas Cook Continental Timetable'', July 1976 issue, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Timetable'''s page size from 1873–1939 was {{convert|123|x|184|mm|in}},&lt;ref name=apr88&gt;''Thomas Cook European Timetable'', April 1988 issue, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; but was increased to {{convert|152|x|249|mm|in}} with the post-war resumption, and there have been only small changes to this subsequently.  The ''Timetable'' currently measures {{convert|154|x|242|mm|in|sigfig=1}}. The number of pages per issue varies from issue to issue, mainly seasonally, and has varied over time. From the 1930s to the early 1990s the size of one issue usually varied between about 400 and 520 pages, while since the mid-1990s it has varied between about 560 and 600 pages.&lt;ref name=var/&gt;

For more than 136 years the cover of the ''Cooks Continental'' (or ''European'') ''Timetable'' was orange (or [[red-orange]]) in colour, but with effect from the October 2009 issue it was changed to blue,&lt;ref name=oct2009&gt;Fox, Brendan (ed.) (October 2009). "Our New Look". ''Thomas Cook European Rail Timetable'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; matching the colour used for Thomas Cook's ''Overseas Timetable'', in publication since 1981. When publication was taken over by a new publisher in 2014, what is now the ''European Rail Timetable'' returned to using red-orange for the cover colour.

In some years, a portion of the cover space was sold for an [[Advertising|advertisement]], including from the 1940s through 1975 and from 1998 through 2004. Since 2005, the cover does not carry advertising and, in the final years of publication by Thomas Cook, instead featured a [[Monochrome photography|monochrome]] photograph – changed with each issue – of a train of one of the railways of Europe.&lt;ref name=var/&gt;

In 2013, the ''European Timetable'' started to include a ''Route of the Month'' article in each monthly edition; it features narrative travel writing describing a particular European rail journey, usually with cross-reference to particular table numbers in the timetable section of the book. The legacy publication, independently published since March 2014 and now titled ''European Rail Timetable,'' continues to carry a ''Route of the Month'' in every issue. From early 2015, the Route of the Month was complemented by a second piece of narrative writing in every issue; this additional feature gives tips of travel planning and ticketing and runs under the title ''Tip of the Month''.

==Non-European coverage==
Although coverage was mainly limited to [[continental Europe]], by at least the 1960s a few pages were devoted to major routes in other areas, mostly adjacent to Europe.  For example, in the February 1967 issue, 16 of its total of 440 pages were given to railway timetables for "the USSR and Far East", Turkey, and all countries in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] that had any scheduled train service.&lt;ref name=feb67&gt;''Cooks Continental Timetable'', February 1967 issue.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-European coverage was expanded in the 1970s.  Schedules for [[Amtrak]], in the United States, were added in 1972, after Amtrak hired Thomas Cook &amp; Son Ltd. as a sales agent and paid to have its schedules included in the ''Timetable''. By 1974, [[Canadian National Railway|Canadian National]]'s service had also been added. However, altogether, the US and Canadian section still took up only 10 pages in a 520-page book.&lt;ref name=29mar74/&gt;

A more substantial change was implemented early in 1977, when coverage was expanded to world-wide, and the title was changed from the ''Thomas Cook Continental Timetable'' to the ''Thomas Cook International Timetable''.  The new information for non-European countries was much more condensed than that for Europe, but the change still added 80 pages to the publication.  The monthly [[print run]] exceeded 20,000 in summer 1977.&lt;ref name="JRTR"/&gt;

In January 1981, the non-European content was taken back out, to be included instead in a new bi-monthly publication entitled the ''Thomas Cook Overseas Timetable'' ({{ISSN|0144-7475}}), which averaged about 420 pages and included much more [[Coach (scheduled transport)|intercity bus (coach)]] services, in countries where intercity rail service was very limited or non-existent.&lt;ref name="JRTR"/&gt;  With this change, the main timetable book reverted to the name ''Thomas Cook Continental Timetable''.  The ''Overseas Timetable'' was published for 30 years, but ceased publication at the end of 2010.&lt;ref name="end of the line"&gt;{{cite news | last=Calder | first=Simon | authorlink=Simon Calder | title=End of the line for the Thomas Cook book | date=23 October 2010 | newspaper=[[The Independent]] | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/simon-calder-end-of-the-line-for-the-thomas-cook-book-2114010.html | accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the early 1990s, quarterly editions of the ''European Timetable'' have also been published, sub-titled the "Independent Traveller's Editions" and containing 32 additional pages of travel information. The frequency of these was later reduced to twice per year, for the Summer and Winter periods only.  These editions are intended mainly for sale at book shops&lt;ref name="JRTR"/&gt; and each one is given a distinct [[ISBN]], in addition to the ISSN of the series title. They have a full-colour photograph on the cover, as compared to the [[Monochrome photography|monochrome photo]] on the cover of the regular ''European Timetable''.

In August 2011, about eight months after the ''Overseas Timetable'' ceased publication, a new section called "Beyond Europe" was added to the ''European Timetable''.  This section appears in every issue but rotates among six different regions of the world outside Europe, with each area being included only twice per year, six months apart.&lt;ref name=mirror-july2011&gt;{{cite news|title=Thomas Cook European Rail Timetable to include 'Beyond Europe' section|date=30 July 2011|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/travel/thomas-cook-european-rail-timetable-144616|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign-language editions==
A [[Japanese language|Japanese]] edition of the ''European Timetable'' was introduced in 1985, published twice a year (named the Spring and Summer editions) and printed by a different company, under a [[License|licensing]] agreement with Thomas Cook Publishing.  The frequency later increased to quarterly but then reverted to bi-annually.  The tables of train times are essentially unmodified, but the general-information sections and the introductory paragraphs at the start of each section are translated into Japanese. From 2000 to 2009, a monthly [[German language|German-language]] edition was published, and this was produced directly by Thomas Cook Publishing – under an agreement with {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Bahn]]}} (German Railways) and titled {{lang|de|Kursbuch Europa}}.  Unlike the Japanese version, this edition differed only slightly from the regular (English) ''Thomas Cook European Timetable'', with a brief German introduction and a different cover design.&lt;ref name="JRTR"/&gt;

==Usage==
Users and buyers of the ''Timetable'' have included independent travellers (both [[Tourism|tourist]] and business travellers), [[Travel agency|travel agent]]s, [[Bookselling|book shop]]s, libraries and [[Railfan|railway enthusiast]]s. The ''Timetable'' has been suggested as a useful reference by travel writers in various media, such as ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name=nyt-grimes&gt;{{cite news | last=Grimes | first=Paul | title=Practical Traveler: The Rewards of Homework | date=1 July 1984 | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/01/travel/practical-traveler-the-rewards-of-homework.html | accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by many noted [[Guide book|travel-guide]] writers.  [[Fodor's]] has recommended ''Cook's Timetable'' for travellers to Europe who "want to be really knowledgeable about train times in Europe",&lt;ref name=fodors75&gt;{{cite book | author=Tennant, David D. | editor=Eugene Fodor | editor-link=Eugene Fodor (writer) | editor2=Robert C.

[[Image:ThomasRegister.png|frame|1905 ''Thomas' Register of American Manufacturers'']]
The '''''Thomas Register of American Manufacturers''''', now '''ThomasNet''', is an online platform for supplier discovery and product sourcing in the USA and Canada. It was once known  as the "big green books" and "Thomas Registry", and was a multi-volume [[Yellow Pages|directory]] of [[Industry|industrial]] product information covering 650,000 [[distributors]], [[manufacturers]] and service companies within 67,000-plus [[industry|industrial]] categories that is now published on ThomasNet.

==History==
The books were first published in 1898 by Harvey Mark Thomas as ''Hardware and Kindred Trades. ''In their heyday, '''''Thomas Register of American Manufacturers ''''' was a 34-volume, 3 section buying guide offering sourcing information on industrial products and services, along with comprehensive specifications and detailed product information from thousands of manufacturers. The Thomas Regional Directory Company began as a division of Thomas Publishing in 1976. Thomas Regional Regional Industrial Buying Guides provided information in print and on CD-ROM,  on local OEMs, distributors, MRO services and other custom manufacturing services in 19 regional editions covering much of the United States. Thomas Register and Thomas Regional were available online from the mid 1990s. The company stopped publishing its print products in 2006.

Thomas has moved its database [[online]] as ThomasNet, published and maintained by Thomas Industrial Network, one of Thomas’ five business units. ThomasNet has expanded to provide not only product and company information, but also [[Online shopping|online catalog]]s, [[computer-aided design]] ([[Computer-aided design|CAD]]) drawings, [[news]], [[press releases]] and [[blogs]].

==Thomas Publishing Company, LLC==

Thomas Publishing Company, LLC of [[New York City]] has been [[privately held]] since its inception. It used independent representatives to sell advertising space around its listings in print products like the Thomas Register and the Thomas Industrial Regional Directories, and these representatives continue to sell Internet related products to manufacturers, distributors, and other companies.

==ThomasNet==

ThomasNet is an information and technology company based in New York City. In April 2006 the [[New York Public Library]] named ThomasNet.com as one of its [http://www.nypl.org/branch/books/index2.cfm?ListID=300 25 Best of Reference] sources for the [[reference librarian]], and is currently listed in their [http://www.nypl.org/weblinks/1382 Best of the Web] list for Industry Information.

Since November 2010, ThomasNet has been a founding partner of GlobalTrade.net, a marketplace for international trade service providers.

==ThomasNet News==
ThomasNet News is a product of Thomas Publishing Company, LLC. ThomasNet News was introduced with “the mission of delivering timely, new industrial product information covering the whole range of products …” It manually reviews press releases submitted through the website and publishes with a small description in one of 51 different categories.

In 2000, ThomasNet News released Industry Market Trends (IMT), its first Journal. In the IMT, editors published editorials, interviews, and long form journalism on issues ranging from career skills, developments in the industry, and discussions with leading experts. Soon after, IMT Green &amp; Clean was launched in response to the growing interest in green technology and its impact on the world. In 2011, the IMT Machining Journal was launched followed by the IMT Fluid &amp; Gas Flow Journal, the IMT Career Journal, and the IMT Procurement Journal.

==Research==
Starting in 2010, ThomasNet began reaching out to its database of manufacturers to get a better understanding of where the community was, where their shortcomings were, and where they saw the landscape going in the future. This yearly survey is called the Industry Market Barometer.

'''Ubaoner''' is the name of a [[fiction|fictitious]] [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[magician (paranormal)|magician]] appearing in the second chapter of a story told in the legendary ''[[Westcar Papyrus]].'' He is said to have worked [[miracle|wonders]] during the reign of king ([[pharaoh]]) [[Nebka]] ([[Third dynasty of Egypt|3rd dynasty]]).

==The literary person==
Ubaoner appears only in the second story of the ''Westcar Papyrus'' – there is no [[Archeology|archeological]] or [[History|historical]] evidence that he existed. Nevertheless, he is an object of great interest for [[Egyptologists]], since his magical trick is connected to later cultural perceptions of the personality of king Nebka. In the story, Ubaoner is described as a high lector priest.&lt;ref&gt;Alan B. Lloyd: ''Herodotus, book II: introduction'', Band 1. BRILL, Leiden 1975, {{ISBN|90-04-04179-6}}, page 104 – 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VeLe&gt;Verena M. Lepper: ''Untersuchungen zu pWestcar.

==The wonder of Ubaoner==
According to the ''Westcar Papyrus,'' Ubaoner is betrayed by his own wife several times. She secretly loves a commoner who resides at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and sends him expensive clothes and other material. The commoner comes to visit Ubaoner's wife and says to her: “Isn't there a [[pavilion]] at the lake?”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; The wife says: “See, let's spend some time in there.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; She calls for Ubaoner's [[Property caretaker|caretaker]] and orders him: “Prepare the pavilion with all good things.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; And so Ubaoner's wife and the commoner spend their time in the pavilion drinking together, until they were finished. Later that evening the commoner is picked up by his maidservant, who was waiting at the lake. Ubaoner's caretaker was waiting there, too and he says to himself: “I will go to Ubaoner.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Two days later the caretaker tells everything to Ubaoner and makes the comment: “See, it was your wife who spent a day in your pavilion; she was together with that commoner you know. It was [[adultery]] what he did, two times, at your lake.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Thereupon, Ubaoner says to the caretaker: “Bring me a pair of [...]&lt;ref name=VML&gt;The text at this spot is lost because of severe damages; see: Verena M. Lepper: ''Untersuchungen zu pWestcar. Eine philologische und literaturwissenschaftliche (Neu-)Analyse''. In: ''Ägyptologische Abhandlungen'', Band 70. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, {{ISBN|3-447-05651-7}}, page 35 – 41.&lt;/ref&gt; made of [[ebony]] and [[Electrum|dja'am]]. I will create [...]&lt;ref name=VML/&gt; and send it as a harbinger.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; He creates a small figurine of [[wax]] in the shape of a [[Nile crocodile|crocodile]] with a length of seven fingers. He bewitches the figurine and gives it to his caretaker with the words: “When he comes to purify himself in the lake, this commoner, then you may throw this crocodile made of wax after him.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; The caretaker does as ordered and waits until the next day. The next morning Ubaoner's wife orders the caretaker: “Let the pavilion at the lake be prepared, for I will sit in it.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Thereupon she spends the whole day in the pavilion together with the commoner. Later that evening the commoner leaves the pavilion to take a bath in the lake. The caretaker quickly throws the wax figurine after the stranger and when the idol touches the water it becomes a real, living crocodile 3.70m in length. The animal devours the commoner and disappears in the depths of the lake for seven days. During these seven days Ubaoner is received by pharaoh Nebka for an important audience. After the audience Ubaoner invites Nebka to visit his house with the words: “May thy majesty proceed and see the wonder that has happened in the time of thy majesty [...]&lt;ref name=VML/&gt; a commoner.”.&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Nebka and Ubaoner walk to the lake where Ubaoner orders the crocodile to come out of the water and to release the commoner. When king Nebka sees that he says: “This crocodile is dangerous!”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; But Ubaoner bends down and touches the crocodile and immediately it becomes a figurine of wax again. Then Ubaoner gives a report to Nebka about the affairs. Nebka tells the crocodile: “Take away what is yours!”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; and the animal grabs the commoner and then disappears. The wife of Ubaoner is brought to Nebka, too and the pharaoh sentence her to death. She is brought to a place east of the palace and burnt alive. Her ash is thrown into the [[Nile]].&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt;&lt;ref name=AdEr2&gt;Adolf Erman: ''Die Märchen des Papyrus Westcar I. Einleitung und Commentar''. In: ''Mitteilungen aus den Orientalischen Sammlungen''. Heft V, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Berlin 1890. page 7 – 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MiLi/&gt;

==Modern analysis==
[[Adolf Erman]] and [[Kurt Heinrich Sethe]] once considered the stories of ''Papyrus Westcar'' as mere [[folklore]]. They saw literary figures like [[Djadjaemankh]] and the other heroes of the ''Westcar Papyrus'' as a pure fiction, created only for entertainment, since there is no archeological evidence of them.&lt;ref name=AdEr/&gt;&lt;ref name=AdEr2/&gt;

Modern Egyptologists like [[Verena Lepper]] and [[Miriam Lichtheim]] deny this view and argue, that Sethe and Erman may have just failed to see the profundity of such novels. They hold that the story of Ubaoner describes a classical case of [[adultery]] through the wife and a typical sort of punishment for that during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] (in this case it is the [[death penalty]]). Furthermore, it throws a positive light on the personality of king Nebka. The king is depicted as a strict but lawful [[judge]]: He punishes mischief and [[ethics|unethical]] behavior, in this case the betrayal of Ubaoner's wife. Additionally, Lepper and Lichtheim point to multiple similar but somewhat later ancient Egyptian writings in which magicians perform very similar magic tricks. According to the Egyptologists, their stories are obviously inspired by the tale of Ubaoner. And since they show the same manner of speaking and equal picking up of quaint phrases as the ''Westcar Papyrus'' does, Lepper and Lichtheim hold that Ubaoner (and the other wise men from the same papyrus) must have been known to Egyptian authors for a long time.&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt;&lt;ref name=MiLi/&gt;

The '''Yahoo! Directory''' was a [[web directory]] which at one time rivaled [[DMOZ]] in size. The directory was [[Yahoo!]]'s first offering and started in 1994 under the name '''Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.golem.de/news/yahoo-directory-yahoo-schliesst-seinen-katalog-1409-109478.html Yahoo schließt seinen Katalog] from golem.de, September 27, 2014, retrieved in June 3, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; When Yahoo! changed to [[Yahoo! Search|crawler-based listings]] for its main results in October 2002, the human-edited directory's significance dropped, but it was still being updated as of April 16, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dir.yahoo.com/new/20140416/regional/ Yahoo! Directory Additions for Wednesday April 16, 2014], Yahoo&lt;/ref&gt;  Users could browse thousands of listings which were organized in 7 or more tiers.  For example, if a user was looking for a site on chess they might follow a path such as: recreation -&gt; games -&gt; board games -&gt; chess.

The directory originally offered two options for suggesting websites for possible listing: "Standard", which was free,&lt;ref name=How&gt;[http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/directory/listings/listings-03.html How do I add my site to the Yahoo! Directory?], Yahoo! website, accessed January 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and a paid submission process which offered expedited review.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ecom.yahoo.com/dir/submit/intro/  Yahoo! Directory Submit], Yahoo! website, accessed April 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; "Standard" was dropped, and a non-refundable review fee of $299 ($600 for adult sites) was required when suggesting any website. If listed, the same amount was charged annually.

On September 26, 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would be closing the directory on December 31, 2014.&lt;ref name=Closing&gt;[http://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/98474044364/progress-report-continued-product-focus "Progress Report: Continued Product Focus"], Yahoo! September 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  This followed the closing of  a number of country-specific directories in 2010.&lt;ref name=NoPlans&gt;[http://searchengineland.com/yahoo-closes-european-directories-us-directory-safe-44610 "Yahoo! Closes European Directories, Says US Directory Is Safe"], SearchEngineLand.com, accessed August 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yin Yu Tang House (蔭餘堂)''' is a late 18th-century [[China|Chinese]] house from [[Anhui]] province that had been removed from its original village and re-erected in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts]]. In North America it is the only example of historic Chinese vernacular architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Han|date=2014|title=“Transplanting” Yin Yu Tang to America: Preservation, Value, and Cultural Heritage|url=http://iaste.berkeley.edu/iaste/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2014/08/25.2-TDSR-LI.pdf|journal=TDSR|volume=XXV|pages=53-64|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such it provides an example of the type of dwelling an average family in China would have lived in. The Yin Yu Tang (Hall of Plentiful Shelter) was built in the late eighteenth century during the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644-1911). 

A prosperous merchant surnamed Huang built a stately sixteen-bedroom house in China's southeastern [[Huizhou (region)|Huizhou region]], calling his home Yin Yu Tang House.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/x1526284304/The-house-that-feng-shui-built-Yin-Yu-Tang-is-a-window-to-the-ancient-practice|title=The house that feng shui built: Yin Yu Tang is a window to the ancient practice|work=Wicked Local|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Chinese merchant commissioned the construction of the house in the province of his birth, Anhui, China. The five-bay, two-story residence was typical of its region, built of [[Ancient Chinese wooden architecture#Timber frame|timber frame construction]], with a tile roof and exterior masonry walls of sandstone and brick. The house is about 47 feet 6 inches by 52 feet 5-1/2 inches not including the kitchens. In addition to sixteen bedrooms there are also two reception areas, a storage room, and a courtyard in the center. There are also large intricately carved wooden panels that cover the inner windows on the first floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yinyutang.pem.org/faqs.html|title=Yin Yu Tang, A Chinese Home|website=yinyutang.pem.org|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The house survived economic and political upheavals, and was home to eight generations of the Huang family. By the mid-1980s the house stood empty. Local and national authorities, with the endorsement of the original owner's descendants, gave permission for the house (and its contents) to be relocated to the [[Peabody Essex Museum]] (PEM) in Salem, Massachusetts. The house opened in June 2003 as a permanent exhibit at the PEM.
