{{refimprove|date=July 2014}}
An '''and-inverter graph (AIG)''' is a directed, acyclic [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] that represents a structural implementation of the logical functionality of a [[digital circuit|circuit or network]].  An AIG consists of two-input nodes representing [[logical conjunction]], terminal nodes labeled with variable names, and edges optionally containing markers indicating [[logical negation]].  This representation of a logic function is rarely structurally efficient for large circuits, but is an efficient representation for manipulation of [[boolean function]]s. Typically, the abstract graph is represented as a [[data structure]] in software.
[[Image:And-inverter-graph.svg|thumb|400px|Two structurally different AIGs for the function f(x1, x2, x3) = x2 * ( x1 + x3 )]]

Conversion from the network of [[logic gate]]s to AIGs is fast and scalable. It only requires that every gate be expressed in terms of [[AND gate]]s and [[inverter (logic gate)|inverters]]. This conversion does not lead to unpredictable increase in memory use and runtime.  This makes the AIG an efficient representation in comparison with either the [[binary decision diagram]] (BDD) or the "sum-of-product" (ΣoΠ) form,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} that is, the [[canonical form (Boolean algebra)|canonical form]] in [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] known as the [[disjunctive normal form]] (DNF). The BDD and DNF may also be viewed as circuits, but they involve formal constraints that deprive them of scalability.  For example, ΣoΠs are circuits with at most two levels while BDDs are canonical, that is, they require that input variables be evaluated in the same order on all paths.

Circuits composed of simple gates, including AIGs, are an "ancient" research topic. The interest in AIGs started with Alan Turing's seminal 1948 paper&lt;ref&gt;Turing's 1948 paper has been re-printed as Turing AM. Intelligent Machinery. In: Ince DC, editor. ''Collected works of AM Turing &amp;mdash; Mechanical Intelligence.'' Elsevier Science Publishers, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; on neural networks, in which he described a randomized trainable network of NAND gates.   Interest continued through the late 1950s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =L. Hellerman|title=A catalog of three-variable Or-Inverter and And-Inverter logical circuits|journal=IEEE Trans. Electron. Comput.|volume=EC-12|date=June 1963|pages=198&amp;ndash;223|doi=10.1109/PGEC.1963.263531|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued in the 1970s when various local transformations have been developed.  These transformations were implemented in several
logic synthesis and verification systems, such as Darringer et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Darringer |author2=W. H. Joyner, Jr. |author3=C. L. Berman |author4=L. Trevillyan |title=Logic synthesis through local transformations|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=25|issue=4|date=Jul 1981|pages=272&amp;ndash;280|doi=10.1147/rd.254.0272|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.85.7515&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Smith et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G. L. Smith |author2=R. J. Bahnsen |author3=H. Halliwell |title=Boolean comparison of hardware and flowcharts|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=26|issue=1|date=Jan 1982|pages=106&amp;ndash;116|doi=10.1147/rd.261.0106|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.85.2196&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reduce circuits to improve area and delay during synthesis, or to speed up [[formal equivalence checking]]. Several important techniques were discovered early at [[IBM]], such as combining and reusing multi-input logic expressions and subexpressions, now known as [[structural hashing]].

Recently there has been a renewed interest in AIGs as a [[Functional Representation|functional representation]] for a variety of tasks in synthesis and verification. That is because representations popular in the 1990s (such as BDDs) have reached their limits of scalability in many of their applications.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Another important development was the recent emergence of much more efficient [[boolean satisfiability]] (SAT) solvers. When coupled with ''AIGs'' as the circuit representation, they lead to remarkable speedups in solving a wide variety of [[boolean problem]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

AIGs found successful use in diverse [[Electronic design automation|EDA]] applications. A well-tuned combination of ''AIGs'' and [[boolean satisfiability]] made an impact on [[formal verification]], including both [[model checking]] and equivalence checking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Kuehlmann |author2=V. Paruthi |author3=F. Krohm |author4=M. K. Ganai |title=Robust boolean reasoning for equivalence checking and functional property verification|journal=IEEE Trans.

ICCAD '04|pages=42&amp;ndash;49|date=2004|url=http://www.perbjesse.com/iccad04.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing understanding that logic and physical synthesis problems can be solved using simulation and [[boolean satisfiability]] to compute functional properties (such as symmetries)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=K.-H. Chang |author2=I. L. Markov |author3=V. Bertacco |title=Post-placement rewiring and rebuffering by exhaustive search for functional symmetries|booktitle=Proc.

Mishchenko |author2=J. S. Zhang |author3=S. Sinha |author4=J. R. Burch |author5=R. Brayton |author6=M.

ICCAD | pages=254&amp;mdash;261 | date=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mishchenko et al. shows that AIGs are a promising ''unifying'' representation, which can bridge [[logic synthesis]], [[technology mapping]], physical synthesis, and formal verification.  This is, to a large extent, due to the simple and uniform structure of AIGs, which allow rewriting, simulation, mapping, placement, and verification to share the same data structure.

In addition to combinational logic, AIGs have also been applied to [[sequential logic]] and sequential transformations.  Specifically, the method of structural hashing was extended to work for AIGs with memory elements (such as [[flip-flop (electronics)#D flip-flop|D-type flip-flop]]s with an initial state,
which, in general, can be unknown) resulting in a data structure that is specifically tailored for applications related to [[retiming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=J. Baumgartner |author2=A. Kuehlmann |title=Min-area retiming on flexible circuit structures|booktitle= Proc. ICCAD'01|pages=176&amp;ndash;182|date=2001|url=ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/es/info/iwls01_ret.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing research includes implementing a modern logic synthesis system completely based on AIGs.  The prototype called [http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/ ABC] features an AIG package, several AIG-based synthesis and equivalence-checking techniques, as well as an experimental implementation of sequential synthesis. One such technique combines technology mapping and retiming in a single optimization step. These optimizations can be implemented using networks composed of arbitrary gates, but the use of AIGs makes them more scalable and easier to implement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33205">'''Archaeological looting in Iraq''' took place on the aftermath of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|US-led invasion of Iraq]] in 2003. The chaos following war has provided the opportunity to pillage everything that is not nailed down.  The period between April 8, 2003 when the staff vacated [[National Museum of Iraq]] and April 16, 2003 when US forces arrived in sufficient numbers to “restore some semblance of order.” Some 15,000 cultural artifacts disappeared in that time.

==History==
Looting of ancient artifacts has a long tradition. As early as 1884, laws passed in Mesopotamia about moving and destroying antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of WW1, British-occupied Mesopotamia had created protections for archeological sites where looting was beginning to become a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They established an absolute prohibition on exporting antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The British Museum was responsible for the sites and museums across Iraq during this time period. [[Gertrude Bell]], well known for drawing the Iraq borders, excavated many sites around Iraq and created what is now the [[National Museum of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

By the mid 1920s the black market for antiquities was growing and looting began in all sites where antiquities could be found. After Iraq was independent of Britain the absolute ban on antiquity exports was lifted. Until the mid 1970s Iraq was one of very few countries to not prohibit external trade in antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made Iraq attractive to looters and black market collectors from around the globe. The result of the first [[Gulf War]] was that at least 4000 artifacts were looted from Iraq sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Uprisings that followed the war also resulted in 9 of 13 regional museums being looted and burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was just a preview for what would once again happen after the 2003 war. Since the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], archaeological looting has become an even greater problem. Though some sites, such as [[Ur]] and [[Nippur]], were officially protected by US and Coalition forces, most were not. 

[[Saddam Hussein]] treasured his national heritage immensely and acted to defend these sites and the artifacts within them. Hussein came into power in 1979 as the fifth president of Iraq. He believed that the past of Iraq was important to his national campaign and his regime actually doubled the national budget for archeology and heritage creating museums and protecting sites all over Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn’t until his party the [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)|Ba'ath Party]] was under pressure in the 1990s that looting become a large problem once again for Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000 looting had become so rampant that the workers of the sites were even looting their own workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the fall of Saddam's government on 9 April 2003, archaeological sites were left completely open to looting.

==Failure to protect before the 2003 Invasion ==

Before the 2003 invasion by US and Coalition forces, the US government created a post-war plan for Iraq. The US has been heavily criticized in the media and academic writings for not adequately planning protections for culture and antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lawrence Rothfield, former director of the Cultural Policy Center at the [[University of Chicago]] and associate professor of English and comparative literature, this looting of the National Museum of Iraq and of hundreds of archaeological sites around the country was not prevented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of war planning it was Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] who decided on a fast invasion with fewer troops, resulting in inadequate protection of buildings and cultural sites.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} 

American troops and commanders did not prioritize security for cultural sites around Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peacekeeping was seen as a lesser job than physically fighting in combat and President Bush’s suspension of former president Clinton’s policies for peacekeeping not only backed up this thought but also made the US’s duties to restore public order unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; American troops in Iraq didn’t trust Iraqi power of any kind meaning that instead of using and training Iraqi police, the US military took matters of security and policing into their own hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially the US would act as peacekeepers to train a national army and police force. Special Forces teams would work with regional warlords to keep control of their territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing warlords to police their own areas has been credited with being a disastrous plan for the archaeological sites in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Arthur Houghton had an interest and some expertise in cultural heritage and was one of the first to wonder what the pre-war plan was for Iraqi culture. He had worked in the State Department as a Foreign Service officer, as an international policy analyst for the White house and also served at an acting curator for the Getty Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late spring 2002, Houghton was approached by Ashton Hawkins, former Executive Vice President and Counsel to the Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum, and was asked to find out what was being done by officials to secure heritage sites in the upcoming war in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houghton could find no one designated with the task of protection and preservation of culture in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There had been a secret Future of Iraq Project since October 2001, with clearance from the Pentagon. However, even under this Project no specific person had taken up responsibility of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even archaeological organizations in the US hadn’t noticed the issue until late 2002. Likewise when the US Agency for Cultural Development (USAID) met with estimated 150 NGO’s not one brought up protection of cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] had in fact, after the Gulf War in 1991, attempted to go into Iraq and assess the damage to cultural sites but they were not allowed to enter the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO then focused, for the next decade, on reconstruction after the fact rather than prevention measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the US military, Civil Affairs (CA) forces were important to the protection of culture and, as they were mostly reservists, included experts in a variety of areas including archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was to spread the expertise among fighting forces in order to warn them of cultural sites in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, CA was left out of  pre-war planning until January 2003, when it was too late to be of any real significant help. The CA had to prioritize the small amount of CA troops to what they thought was necessary, which inevitably wasn’t culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CA did, however, pull the only two archaeologists in Civil Affairs to be on a culture team, Maj. Chris Varhola and Capt. William Sumner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These two men, however, in the end were sent to other places when the conflict began. Varhola was needed to prepare for the refugee crises that never arrived and Sumner was reassigned to guard a zoo after pushing his advisor too hard on antiquities issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any protection of culture, sites or buildings was stopped due to the priorities of other matters. Essentially no one who had archaeological expertise was senior enough to get anything done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another branch of the US government that had interest in culture was the Foreign Area Offices (FAO). Unfortunately though, they were focused on customs and attitudes rather than archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Something that was accomplished was the creation of a no-strike list created by Maj. Varhola just like two archaeologists before him had done during the 1991 Gulf War which had a great outcome of saving antiquities from bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One piece of international law that is important for this conflict is the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, this Convention states that parties in conflict must “under take to prohibit, prevent and, if necessary, put a stop to any form of theft, pillage or misappropriation of, and any act of vandalism directed against, cultural property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;” This provision was constructed for the parties actually in combat within the war and not civilians within their own state. As the upcoming years would prove, there are exceptions to this Convention and they would result in Americans firing on the Iraq National Museum. 

By fall 2002, post-war planning was sporadic and improvised. The cultural planning aspect needed to have leadership that it never got.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy Assistant under the Security of Defense, Joseph Collins, recalls some forces spent more time working on projects that ended up not being needed like a refugee crises plan. He says he can’t remember if there was even an organizational plans to solve specific issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first known effort by cultural interests to contact US officials was October 2002. After a meeting of powerful players in culture, Houghton sent a letter asking for departments to tell forces to avoid damaging monuments, soldiers were to respect the integrity of sites, and lastly to work quickly to get the antiquities services in Iraq up and running again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, the [[Archaeological Institute of America]] (AIA) also sent a similar letter to the Pentagon in December 2002 asking for governments to take action to prevent looting in the aftermath of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; As 2002 came to an end the media and government were only broadcasting the good done by the troops in not destroying cultural heritage themselves but not on the looting done by people in Iraq and the Americans duty to protect the antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Large scale looting ==

When the looting of the National Iraq Museum became known, experts from around the globe started planning to remedy the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGuire Gibson, one of the leading archaeologists and experts on Mesopotamia explained to the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) that the looted museum artifacts were only a small part of what archaeological digs around the country held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps 25 thousand of an estimated half million sites were registered. ORHA had no resources to address this problem. Gibson had suggested helicopter surveys to determine the scale of looted sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 24, 2003, looting had taken place in [[Umma]], Umm al-Hafriyat, Umm al-Aqarib, Bismaya, Larsa, and Bad-tibira, most of were unguarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most looting was by workers once employed by the now disbanded State Board of Antiquities and Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local tribe was guarding the World Heritage Site of Hatra although others were unsupervised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By May 2003, international work began on the already looted museum but not on other sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US military conducted a raid in May on Umma where they found hundreds of trenches with many looters all over the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, the Bush Administration replaced Gen. Jay Garner with L. Paul Bremer who was given more power and banned high-ranking Ba’ath Party members from government jobs and disbanded the remains of the Iraqi army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any guards at archeological sites were unpaid for months and they were not allowed to carry guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, instead of dealing with civilian looters, these unarmed guards were dealing with large mobs of armed people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

At the end of May 2003, it finally became clear how badly the sites were looted when a trip sponsored by National Geographic went out to assess the damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a northern and southern team to assess the post-conflict damage by land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found the famous sites such as Babylon, Hatra, Nimrud and Ur were under US military control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lesser known sites were completely unguarded and the responsible Civil Affairs teams didn’t even know where they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every place the National Geographic team saw, except one that was guarded by barbed wire, had been damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gibson was part of the northern National Geographic team and he sent  a report to the White House science advisor John Marburger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other archeological experts in both the US and Britain were waiting for invitations to go to Iraq and help. After Gibson’s report they were given invitations to create a team in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Early July 2003, UNESCO revealed that looting was still happening at sites across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other military services such as Japanese and Dutch troops offered assistance but were ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 8, a new security guard force known as the Iraqi Facility Protection Service (FPS) was established to protect sites all around the country in co-operation with the US military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, the State Department announced it was forming a group to assist in the rebuilding of Iraq’s cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

These announcements had no effect on the looting and illegal export of artifacts. McGuire Gibson on September 11, 2003 wrote  to a military geographer, "The continuing destruction of sites all over southern Iraq and the theft of thousands of artifacts every week, with no visible effort on part of the US authorities, makes the question of ethical behaviour by museums pointless. Your unit of the Pentagon is capable of demonstrating the location and expansion of illegal digging. Are you at least doing that much?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

[[File:Hrs 081225 sod hia.jpg|left|thumb|Recovered artifacts on display in late 2008]]

It is impossible to discover exactly how much destruction to archeological sites has happened since the 2003 invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 2004, US military maps still did not show archeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archeologist Elizabeth Stone purchased satellite images of the seven thousand square kilometers in Iraq that contain many known sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; She counted 1,837 new holes by comparing 2001-2002 with 2003 images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looters concentrated on sites that had the most marketable artifacts. Estimates of the number of looted artifacts from 2003-2005 are from 400,000 to 600,000 items. This number is 30-40 times greater than the number of artifacts stolen from the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Britain alone between 2004-2006 seized 3-4 tons of plundered artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some artifacts have been recovered by accident. An archeologist was watching a home decorating show when he saw a second century stone head from Hatra sitting on the decorator’s mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illegal black market for goods became so saturated that prices in the market were  going down after 2003 according to an antiquities researcher specializing in illicit dealings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Revenue from looted antiquities is estimated by the Archeological Institute of America to amount to between $10 to $20 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorist and rebel groups have a long history of using stolen artifacts to finance their operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the end of 2003, 1,900 Iraqi antiquities had been confiscated from bordering countries: 1,450 in Jordan, 36 in Syria, 38 in Kuwait and 18 in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Marine Corps reservist Matthew Boulay witnessed illicit trading even on U.S. military bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flea markets authorized by the camp commanders included a booth with antiquities for $20, $40 or $100 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boulay asked Gibson and was told that these artifacts were real. Gibson asked Boulay to ask the base commander to stop these sales. When Boulay informed his platoon commander he got a “cease and desist” order forbidding any more emails about the issue to anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other institutes from America and around the world have contributed to protect sites in Iraq but this is still not enough. The US started teaching military personnel headed for Iraq the importance of cultural heritage and site preservation, but not how to stop civilian looting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donny George who was an employee at the Iraq National Museum was appointed to Director of Museums in 2004, and by summer 2006, a force of 1,400 guards were situated at sites around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sites affected==

*[[Adab (city)|Adab]] – an ancient city plagued by hundreds of looters.
* [[Babylon]] – saw the construction of "a 150-hectare camp for 2,000 troops. In the process the 2,500-year-old brick pavement to the [[Ishtar Gate]] was smashed by tanks and the gate itself damaged. The archaeology-rich subsoil was bulldozed to fill sandbags, and large areas covered in compacted gravel for helipads and car parks. Babylon is being rendered archaeologically barren".&lt;ref&gt;([[Simon Jenkins]] in [[The Guardian]], 8 June 2007).[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,2098272,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hatra]] – looters with stonecutters have stolen elements of friezes and reliefs straight off the ancient architecture here.
* [[Isin]] – over two hundred looters' pits are organized around the former site of the Temple of [[Nintinugga|Gula]]; countless artifacts have been removed from the site here, including innumerable [[cuneiform]] tablets, [[cylinder seal]]s, and [[Votive deposit|votive tablets]], some of which could sell for as much as $30,000.
* [[Nimrud]] – home of the palace of [[Assurnasirpal II]] and described by the [[Old Testament]] as the "principal city" of [[Assyria]], Nimrud is one of the few sites that is militarily protected. However, weeks before the arrival of the site's US guards, looters attacked the friezes and statues with stonecutting tools, stealing images distinctly belonging to Nimrud, and thus unmistakenly known to any potential buyers to be stolen; the items have been sold, presumably, nevertheless. Those few looters that managed to break into this site despite its protection have given every indication that they know precisely what they are looking for, where to find it, and how to get at it. Like many looters throughout Iraq and across the world, they have presumably been hired to obtain specific images; this separates them from the looters who dig up and sell whatever they can find.
* [[Nineveh]] – one of the more thoroughly researched sites, experts have little difficulty identifying objects stolen from Nineveh. The site was severely looted and damaged nevertheless after the first Gulf War, and chunks of its unique and ancient friezes have appeared on the European and American art markets.
* [[Nippur]] – the great [[ziggurat]] here has only three major looters' pits cut into it, which are the first in over forty years of valuable research and excavation.
* [[Umma]] – looters descended upon the site as soon as Coalition bombing began; the site is now pockmarked with hundreds of ditches and pits. When archaeologists "tried to remove vulnerable carvings from the ancient city of Umma to Baghdad, they found gangs of looters already in place with bulldozers, dump trucks and AK47s".[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,2098272,00.html]
* [[Ur]] – one of the few sites protected by a US military presence. According to [[Simon Jenkins]], "its walls are pockmarked with wartime shrapnel and a blockhouse is being built over an adjacent archaeological site".[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,2098272,00.html]

'''Architecture criticism''' is the critique of architecture. Everyday criticism relates to published or broadcast critiques of [[building]]s, whether completed or not, both in terms of news and other criteria. In many cases, criticism amounts to an assessment of the architect's success in meeting his or her own aims and objectives and those of others. The assessment may consider the subject from the perspective of some wider context, which may involve planning, social or aesthetic issues. It may also take a polemical position reflecting the critic's own values. At the most accessible extreme, architectural criticism is a branch of lifestyle journalism, especially in the case of high-end residential projects.

==Media coverage==
Most major national [[newspapers]] in developed countries cover the [[arts]] in some form. Architectural [[criticism]] may be included as a part of their arts coverage, in a [[real estate]] section or a ''Home &amp; Style'' supplement.&lt;ref name="goldberger"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Goldberger |first=Paul |title=Architecture Criticism: Does It Matter |work=Paul Goldberger |accessdate=2008-07-10 |date=2003-11-12 |url=http://www.paulgoldberger.com/speeches.php?speech=criticism |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622164550/http://www.paulgoldberger.com/speeches.php?speech=criticism |archivedate=June 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA, reviews are published in specialist magazines ranging from the popular (e.g. [[Architectural Digest]], [[Wallpaper (magazine)|Wallpaper]]) to specialist magazines for design professionals (e.g. [[Architectural Review]], [[DETAIL (professional journal)|Detail]]). As with other forms of criticism, [[technical language]] is used to a varying extent to convey impressions and views precisely.

[[Lewis Mumford]] wrote extensively on architecture in the nineteen thirties, forties and fifties at ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="goldberger" /&gt; [[Ada Louise Huxtable]] was the first full-time architecture critic working for an American daily newspaper when ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave her the role in 1963.&lt;ref name="goldberger" /&gt; [[John Betjeman]], a co-founder of the [[Victorian Society]], wrote and broadcast from the 1950s to 1970s, principally covering historical rather than new buildings, but contributing to a trend for criticism to expand into radio and then television. [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], is outspoken in his criticism of modern architecture, memorably describing a proposed extension to the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery in London]] as a "[[monstrous carbuncle]] on the face of a much-loved friend".

==Criteria==

The  critic's task is to assess how successful the architect and others involved with the project have been in meeting both the criteria the project set out to meet and those that the critic himself feels to be important. Specific criteria include:

* [[Aesthetics]]
* [[Proportion (architecture)|Proportion]]
* [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionality]]
* [[Architectural styles|Architectural style]]
* Choice and use of [[building materials]]
* [[Built environment]] or context
* [[Sustainability]]

==Architectural journalists==
Contemporary critics working for major [[newspapers]] include:
* [[Justin Davidson]] of ''[[New York Magazine]]''
* [[Martin Filler]] of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''
* [[Jonathan Glancey]] of ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanglancey | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jonathan | last=Glancey | title=&lt;img class="contributor-pic" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jonathan_glancey_140x140.jpg" alt="Picture of Jonathan Glancey" title="Jonathan Glancey" /&gt; | date=2007-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Breast Tax''' (''Mulakkaram'' or ''mula-karam'' in [[Malayalam]]) was a tax imposed on the [[Dalit|untouchable]] (outcaste) women in [[Travancore]] (in present-day [[Kerala]] state of India), until 1924. The untouchable (''avarna'') women were expected to pay the government a tax on their [[breast]]s, as soon as they started developing breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=K.S.

The outcaste women were not allowed to wear clothes covering their upper body in the public.&lt;ref name="Jacob_1990"/&gt; The law resulted from Travancore's tradition, in which the breast was bared as a symbol of respect to higher-status people. For example, the [[Nair]]s bared their breasts to the upper-caste [[Nambudiri]] [[Brahmin]]s, while the Brahmins bared their breasts only to the images of the deities. The people of the even lower castes, such as [[Nadar (caste)|Nadars]] (or Shanars), were not allowed cover their breasts at all. With the spread of [[Christianity]] in the 19th century, the Christian converts among the Nadar women started covering their upper body, and gradually, even the Hindu Nadar women adopted this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3290">'''Burgess''' originally meant a [[Freedom of the City|freeman]] of a [[borough]] ([[England]], [[Wales]], [[Ireland]]) or [[burgh]] ([[Scotland]]).  It later came to mean an [[election|elected]] or unelected [[official]] of a [[municipality]], or the [[Legislator|representative]] of a borough in the [[English House of Commons]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Burgess|volume=4|page=814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was also used in some of the original [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]]. In the [[Colony of Virginia]], a "burgess" was a member of the legislative body, which was termed the "[[House of Burgesses]]".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

== Etymology ==
It was derived in [[Middle English]] and [[Middle Scots]] from the [[Old French language|Old French]] word ''burgeis'', simply meaning "an inhabitant of a town" (cf. ''burgeis'' or ''burges'' respectively). The Old French word ''burgeis'' is derived from ''bourg'', meaning a [[market town]] or medieval village, itself derived from [[Late Latin]] ''burgus'', meaning "[[fortress]]"&lt;ref&gt;[[American Heritage Dictionary]] [[etymology]]&lt;/ref&gt; or "wall". In effect, the reference was to the north-west European medieval and renaissance [[merchant]] class which tended to set up their storefronts along the outside of the city wall, where traffic through the gates was an advantage and safety in event of an attack was easily accessible. The right to seek shelter within a burg was known as the ''right of burgess''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Industrial Evolution|last= Bücher|first= Carl|authorlink= Karl Bücher|others= S. Morley Wickett (translator)|year= 1912|publisher= Henry Holt and Co.|location= New York|page= 116|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DGMuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=burgess-rights&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#PPR1,M1 |edition= ''Die Entstehung der Volkswirtschaft''. Translated from the third German|accessdate= 2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was close in meaning to the Germanic term ''[[:wikt:burgher|burgher]]'', a formally defined class in medieval German cities ([[Middle Dutch language|Middle Dutch]] ''burgher'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''burger'' and [[German language|German]] ''Bürger''). It is also linguistically close to the [[French language|French]] term ''[[Bourgeois]]'', which evolved from ''burgeis''. 

== "Greensleeves" reference ==

The original version of the well-known English folk song "[[Greensleeves]]" includes the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Thy purse and eke thy gay guilt knives,
thy pincase gallant to the eye:
No better wore the Burgesse wives,
and yet thou wouldst not love me.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This clearly implies that at the time when it was composed (late 16th to early 17th century) a burgess was proverbial as being able to provide his wife with beautiful and expensive clothes.

In [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]], the '''calculus of constructions''' ('''CoC''') is a [[type theory]] created by [[Thierry Coquand]].  It can serve as both a typed programming language and as [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive]] [[Foundations of mathematics|foundation for mathematics]].  For this second reason, the CoC and its variants have been the basis for [[Coq]] and other [[proof assistant]]s.

Some of its variants include the calculus of inductive constructions (which adds [[Intuitionistic type theory#Inductive types|inductive types]]),
the calculus of (co)inductive constructions (which adds [[coinduction]]), 
and the predicative calculus of inductive constructions (which removes some [[impredicativity]]).

==General traits==
The CoC is a higher-order [[typed lambda calculus]], initially developed by [[Thierry Coquand]].  It is well known for being at the top of [[Henk Barendregt|Barendregt]]'s [[lambda cube]].  It is possible within CoC to define functions from integers to integers, as well as integers to types, types to types, and types to integers.

The CoC is [[normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strongly normalizing]], although, by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]], it is impossible to prove this property within the CoC since it implies inconsistency.

== Usage ==

The CoC has been developed alongside the [[Coq]] [[proof assistant]].  As features were added (or possible liabilities removed) to the theory, they became available in Coq.

Variants of the CoC are used in other proof assistants, such as [[Matita]].

==The basics of the calculus of constructions==

The Calculus of Constructions can be considered an extension of the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]]. The Curry–Howard isomorphism associates a term in the [[Typed lambda calculus|simply typed lambda calculus]] with each natural-deduction proof in [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic propositional logic]]. The Calculus of Constructions extends this isomorphism to proofs in the full intuitionistic predicate calculus, which includes proofs of quantified statements (which we will also call "propositions").

===Terms===

A ''term'' in the calculus of constructions is constructed using the following rules:

* '''T''' is a term (also called ''Type'');
* '''P''' is a term (also called ''Prop'', the type of all propositions);
* Variables (''x'', ''y'', ...) are terms;
* If ''A'' and ''B'' are terms, then so is (''A''&amp;nbsp;''B'');
* If ''A'' and ''B'' are terms and ''x'' is a variable, then following are also terms:
** (&amp;lambda;''x'':''A''&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;''B''),
** (&amp;forall;''x'':''A''&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;B).

In other words, the term syntax, in BNF, is then:
:&lt;math&gt;e ::= \mathbf{T} \mid \mathbf{P} \mid x \mid e \, e \mid \lambda x\mathbin{:}e.e\mid \forall x\mathbin{:}e.e&lt;/math&gt;

The calculus of constructions has five kinds of objects:
# ''proofs'', which are terms whose types are ''propositions'';
# ''propositions'', which are also known as ''small types'';
# ''predicates'', which are functions that return propositions;
# ''large types'', which are the types of predicates ('''P''' is an example of a large type);
# '''T''' itself, which is the type of large types.

===Judgments===

The calculus of constructions allows proving '''typing judgments''':

:&lt;math&gt; x_1:A_1, x_2:A_2, \ldots \vdash t:B&lt;/math&gt;

Which can be read as the implication

: If variables &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; have types &lt;math&gt;A_1, A_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;, then term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

The valid judgments for the calculus of constructions are derivable from a set of inference rules. In the following, we use &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; to mean a sequence of type assignments 
&lt;math&gt; x_1:A_1, x_2:A_2, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;, and we use '''K''' to mean either '''P''' or '''T'''. We shall write &lt;math&gt;B[x:=N]&lt;/math&gt; to mean the result of substituting the term 
&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; for the free variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in 
the term &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

An inference rule is written in the form

:&lt;math&gt; {\Gamma \vdash A:B} \over {\Gamma' \vdash C:D} &lt;/math&gt;

which means

: If &lt;math&gt; \Gamma \vdash A:B &lt;/math&gt; is a valid judgment, then so is &lt;math&gt; \Gamma' \vdash C:D &lt;/math&gt;

===Inference rules for the calculus of constructions===

'''1'''.  &lt;math&gt; {{} \over {} \Gamma \vdash P : T} &lt;/math&gt;

'''2'''.  &lt;math&gt; {\Gamma \vdash A : K \over 
{\Gamma, x:A \vdash x : A}} &lt;/math&gt;

'''3'''.  &lt;math&gt; {\Gamma, x:A \vdash B : K \qquad\qquad \Gamma, x:A \vdash N : B \over 
{\Gamma \vdash (\lambda x:A . N) : (\forall x:A . B) : K}} &lt;/math&gt;

'''4'''.  &lt;math&gt; {\Gamma \vdash M : (\forall x:A . B)\qquad\qquad\Gamma
\vdash N : A \over 
{\Gamma \vdash M N : B[x := N]}} &lt;/math&gt;

'''5'''.   &lt;math&gt; {\Gamma \vdash M : A \qquad \qquad A =_\beta B \qquad \qquad B : K 
\over {\Gamma \vdash M : B}} &lt;/math&gt;

===Defining logical operators===

The calculus of constructions has very few basic operators: the only logical operator for forming propositions is &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;. However, this one operator is sufficient to define all the other logical operators:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ccll}
A \Rightarrow B &amp; \equiv &amp; \forall x:A . B &amp; (x \notin B) \\
A \wedge B      &amp; \equiv &amp; \forall C:P . (A \Rightarrow B \Rightarrow C) \Rightarrow C &amp; \\
A \vee B        &amp; \equiv &amp; \forall C:P . (A \Rightarrow C) \Rightarrow (B \Rightarrow C) \Rightarrow C &amp; \\
\neg A          &amp; \equiv &amp; \forall C:P . (A \Rightarrow C) &amp; \\
\exists x:A.B   &amp; \equiv &amp; \forall C:P . (\forall x:A.(B \Rightarrow C)) \Rightarrow C &amp;
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Defining data types===

The basic data types used in computer science can be defined
within the Calculus of Constructions:

; Booleans : &lt;math&gt;\forall A: P . A \Rightarrow A \Rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;
; Naturals : &lt;math&gt;\forall A:P . 
(A \Rightarrow A) \Rightarrow (A \Rightarrow A)&lt;/math&gt;
; Product &lt;math&gt;A \times B&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;A \wedge B&lt;/math&gt;
; Disjoint union &lt;math&gt;A + B&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;A \vee B&lt;/math&gt;

Note that Booleans and Naturals are defined in the same way as in [[Church encoding]]. However additional problems raise from propositional extensionality and proof irrelevance [http://coq.inria.fr/stdlib/Coq.Logic.ClassicalFacts.html].

Smith, Wiley, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-470-01460-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special case of the center-of-momentum frame is the '''center-of-mass frame''': an inertial frame in which the [[center of mass]] (which is a physical point) remains at the origin. In all COM frames, the center of mass is at rest, but it is not necessarily at the origin of the coordinate system.

In [[special relativity]], the COM frame is necessarily unique only when the system is isolated.

==Properties==

===General===
The center of momentum frame is defined as the inertial frame in which the sum over the linear momentum of each particle vanishes. Let ''S'' denote the laboratory reference system and ''S''′ denote the center-of-momentum reference frame. Using a [[galilean transformation]], the particle velocity in ''S''′ is

&lt;math&gt; v' = v - V_c ,&lt;/math&gt;

where 
&lt;math&gt;
V_c = \frac{\sum_i m_i v_i}{\sum_i m_i}
&lt;/math&gt;

is the velocity of the mass center.  The total momentum in the center-of-momentum system then vanishes:

&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i} p'_i = \sum_{i} m_i v'_i 
= \sum_{i} m_i (v_i - V_c) 
= \sum_{i} m_i v_i - \sum_i m_i \frac{\sum_j m_j v_j}{\sum_j m_j} 
= \sum_i m_i v_i - \sum_j m_j v_j
= 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

Also, the total [[energy]] of the system is the ''minimal energy'' as seen from all [[inertial reference frame]]s.

===Special relativity===

In [[special relativity|relativity]], COM frame exists for an isolated massive system. This is a consequence of [[Noether's theorem#Example 2: Conservation of center of momentum|Noether's theorem]]. In the COM frame the total energy of the system is the ''[[rest energy]]'', and this quantity (when divided by the factor ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]) gives the [[rest mass]] ([[invariant mass]]) of the system:

:&lt;math&gt; m_0 = \frac{E_0}{c^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[invariant mass]] of the system is given in any inertial frame by the relativistic invariant relation

:&lt;math&gt; m_0{}^2 =\left(\frac{E}{c^2}\right)^2-\left(\frac{p}{c}\right)^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;

but for zero momentum the momentum term (''p''/''c'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; vanishes and thus the total energy coincides with the rest energy.

Systems that have nonzero energy but zero [[rest mass]] (such as [[photons]] moving in a single direction, or equivalently, [[plane wave|plane]] [[electromagnetic wave]]s) do not have COM frames, because there is no frame in which they have zero net momentum. Due to the invariance of the [[speed of light]], such [[Massless particle|massless]] systems must travel at the speed of light in any frame, and therefore always possess a net momentum magnitude that is equal to their energy divided by the speed of light:

:&lt;math&gt; p = \frac{E}{c} .&lt;/math&gt;

==Two-body problem==

An example of the usage of this frame is given below – in a two-body collision, not necessarily elastic (where ''kinetic energy'' is conserved).  The COM frame can be used to find the momentum of the particles much easier than in a [[lab frame]]: the frame where the measurement or calculation is done.  The situation is analyzed using [[Galilean transformations]] and [[conservation of momentum]] (for generality, rather than kinetic energies alone), for two particles of mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, moving at initial velocities (before collision) '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.  The transformations are applied to take the velocity of the frame from the velocity of each particle from the lab frame (unprimed quantities) to the COM frame (primed quantities):&lt;ref name="Forshaw and Smith"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_1^\prime = \mathbf{u}_1 - \mathbf{V} , \quad \mathbf{u}_2^\prime = \mathbf{u}_2 - \mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''V''' is the velocity of the COM frame. Since '''V''' is the velocity of the COM, i.e. the time derivative of the COM location '''R''' (position of the center of mass of the system):&lt;ref&gt;Classical Mechanics, T.W.B. Kibble, European Physics Series, 1973, {{ISBN|0-07-084018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\frac{{\rm d}\mathbf{R}}{{\rm d}t} &amp; = \frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}t}\left(\frac{m_1\mathbf{r}_1+m_2\mathbf{r}_2}{m_1+m_2} \right) \\
&amp; = \frac{m_1\mathbf{u}_1 + m_2\mathbf{u}_2 }{m_1+m_2} \\
&amp; = \mathbf{V} \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

so at the origin of the COM frame, '''R''' = '''0''', this implies

:&lt;math&gt; m_1\mathbf{u}_1^\prime + m_2\mathbf{u}_2^\prime = \boldsymbol{0} &lt;/math&gt;

The same results can be obtained by applying momentum conservation in the lab frame, where the momenta are '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V} = \frac{\mathbf{p}_1 + \mathbf{p}_2}{m_1+m_2} = \frac{m_1\mathbf{u}_1 + m_2\mathbf{u}_2}{m_1+m_2}&lt;/math&gt;

and in the COM frame, where it is asserted definitively that the total momenta of the particles, '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;' and '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;', vanishes:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p}_1^\prime + \mathbf{p}_2^\prime = m_1\mathbf{u}_1^\prime + m_2\mathbf{u}_2^\prime = \boldsymbol{0} &lt;/math&gt;

Using the COM frame equation to solve for '''V''' returns the lab frame equation above, demonstrating any frame (including the COM frame) may be used to calculate the momenta of the particles. It has been established that the velocity of the COM frame can be removed from the calculation using the above frame, so the momenta of the particles in the COM frame can be 
expressed in terms of the quantities in the lab frame (i.e. the given initial values):

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
\mathbf{p}_1^\prime &amp; = m_1\mathbf{u}_1^\prime \\
 &amp; = m_1 \left( \mathbf{u}_1 - \mathbf{V} \right) = \frac{m_1m_2}{m_1+m_2} \left( \mathbf{u}_1 - \mathbf{u}_2 \right) \\
 &amp; = -m_2\mathbf{u}_2^\prime = -\mathbf{p}_2^\prime \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

notice the [[relative velocity]] in the lab frame of particle 1 to 2 is

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u}_1 - \mathbf{u}_2 &lt;/math&gt;

and the 2-body [[reduced mass]] is

:&lt;math&gt; \mu = \frac{m_1m_2}{m_1+m_2} &lt;/math&gt;

so the momenta of the particles compactly reduce to

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p}_1^\prime = -\mathbf{p}_2^\prime = \mu \Delta\mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;

This is a substantially simpler calculation of the momenta of both particles; the reduced mass and relative velocity can be calculated from the initial velocities in the lab frame and the masses, and the momentum of one particle is simply the negative of the other. The calculation can be repeated for final velocities '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in place of the initial velocities '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, since after the collision the velocities still satisfy the above equations:&lt;ref&gt;''An Introduction to Mechanics'', D. Kleppner, R.J. Kolenkow, Cambridge University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-521-19821-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\frac{{\rm d}\mathbf{R}}{{\rm d}t} &amp; = \frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}t}\left(\frac{m_1\mathbf{r}_1+m_2\mathbf{r}_2}{m_1+m_2} \right) \\
&amp; = \frac{m_1\mathbf{v}_1 + m_2\mathbf{v}_2 }{m_1+m_2} \\
&amp; = \mathbf{V} \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

so at the origin of the COM frame, '''R''' = '''0''', this implies after the collision

:&lt;math&gt; m_1\mathbf{v}_1^\prime + m_2\mathbf{v}_2^\prime = \boldsymbol{0} &lt;/math&gt;

In the lab frame, the conservation of momentum fully reads:

:&lt;math&gt; m_1\mathbf{u}_1 + m_2\mathbf{u}_2 = m_1\mathbf{v}_1 + m_2\mathbf{v}_2 = (m_1+m_2)\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation does ''not'' imply that

:&lt;math&gt; m_1\mathbf{u}_1 = m_1\mathbf{v}_1 = m_1\mathbf{V}, \quad m_2\mathbf{u}_2 = m_2\mathbf{v}_2 = m_2\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt;

instead, it simply indicates the total mass ''M'' multiplied by the velocity of the centre of mass '''V''' is the total momentum '''P''' of the system:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \mathbf{P} &amp; = \mathbf{p}_1 + \mathbf{p}_2 \\
&amp; = (m_1 + m_2)\mathbf{V} \\
&amp; = M\mathbf{V}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Similar analysis to the above obtains

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p}_1^\prime = -\mathbf{p}_2^\prime = \mu \Delta\mathbf{v} = \mu \Delta\mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;

where the final [[relative velocity]] in the lab frame of particle 1 to 2 is

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}_1 - \mathbf{v}_2 = \Delta\mathbf{u}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5478">A '''Cluster diagram''' or ''clustering diagram'' is a general type of [[diagram]], which represents some kind of cluster. A cluster in general is a group or bunch of several discrete items that are close to each other.

The cluster diagram figures a cluster, such as a network diagram figures a [[computer network|network]], a flow diagram a process or movement of objects, and a tree diagram an abstract [[tree]]. But all these diagrams can be considered interconnected: A network diagram can be seen as a special orderly arranged kind of cluster diagram. A cluster diagram is a [[Mesh networking|mesh]] kind of network diagram. A [[wikt:flow diagram|flow diagram]] can be seen as a [[wikt:line|line]] type of network diagram, and a [[tree structure|tree diagram]] a [[Tree and hypertree networks|tree]] type of network diagram.

'''Critical rationalism''' is an [[epistemological]] [[philosophy]] advanced by [[Karl Popper]].

==Criticism, not support==
Critical rationalists hold that scientific [[theories]] and any other claims to [[knowledge]] can and should be rationally criticized, and (if they have [[empirical]] content) can and should be subjected to tests which may falsify them. Thus claims to knowledge may be contrastingly and normatively evaluated. They are either falsifiable and thus empirical (in a very broad sense), or not falsifiable and thus non-empirical. Those claims to knowledge that are potentially falsifiable can then be admitted to the body of empirical science, and then further differentiated according to whether they are retained or are later actually falsified. If retained, further differentiation may be made on the basis of how much subjection to criticism they have received, how severe such criticism has been, and how probable the theory is, with the least&lt;ref name=lscd43&gt;{{Cite book|last=Popper |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Popper |title=[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]] |origyear=1959 |edition=2nd English |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge Classics |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-27844-9 |oclc=59377149}}, section 43, especially footnote *1 and *2&lt;/ref&gt; probable theory that still withstands attempts to falsify it being the one to be preferred. That it is the ''least''&lt;ref name=lscd43/&gt; probable theory that is to be preferred is one of the contrasting differences between critical rationalism and classical views on science, such as positivism, who hold that one should instead accept the ''most'' probable theory. (The least probable theory is the one with the highest information content and most open to future falsification.)
Critical Rationalism as a discourse positioned itself against what its proponents took to be epistemologically [[relativist]] philosophies, particularly [[post-modernist]] or [[sociological]] approaches to knowledge. Critical rationalism has it that knowledge is objective (in the sense of being embodied in various substrates and in the sense of not being reducible to what humans individually "''know''"), and also that truth is objective (exists independently of social mediation or individual perception, but is "really real").

However, this contrastive, critical approach to objective knowledge is quite different from more traditional views that also hold knowledge to be objective. (These include the [[Rationalism|classical rationalism]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the [[verificationism]] of the [[logical positivists]], or approaches to science based on [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], a supposed form of logical inference which critical rationalists reject, in line with [[David Hume]].) For criticism is all that can be done when attempting to differentiate claims to knowledge, according to the critical rationalist. Reason is the [[wikt:organon|organon]] of criticism, not of support; of tentative refutation, not of proof.

Supposed positive evidence (such as the provision of "good reasons" for a claim, or its having been "corroborated" by making successful predictions) actually does nothing to bolster, support, or prove a claim, belief, or theory.

In this sense, critical rationalism turns the normal understanding of a traditional rationalist, and a realist, on its head. Especially the view that a theory is better if it is less likely to be true is in direct opposition to the traditional positivistic view, which holds that one should seek for theories that have a high probability.&lt;ref name=lscd43/&gt; Popper notes that this "may illustrate Schopenhauer's remark that the solution of a problem often first looks like a paradox and later like a truism". Even a highly unlikely theory that conflicts current observation (and is thus false, like "all swans are white") must be considered to be better than one which fits observations perfectly, but is highly probable (like "all swans have a color"). This insight is the crucial difference between naive falsificationism and critical rationalism. The lower probability theory is favoured by critical rationalism because the higher the informative content of a theory the lower will be its probability, for the more information a statement contains, the greater will be the number of ways in which it may turn out to be false. The rationale behind this is simply to make it as easy as possible to find out whether the theory is false so that it can be replaced by one that is closer to the truth. It is not meant as a concession to justificatory epistemology, like assuming a theory to be "justifiable" by asserting that it is highly unlikely and yet fits observation.

Critical rationalism rejects the classical position that knowledge is [[justified true belief]]; it instead holds the exact opposite:{{CN|date=November 2018}} That, in general, knowledge is unjustified untrue unbelief. It is unjustified because of the non-existence of good reasons. It is untrue, because it usually contains errors that sometimes remain unnoticed for hundreds of years. And it is not belief either, because scientific knowledge, or the knowledge needed to build a plane, is contained in no single person's mind. It is only available as the content of books.

==Non-justificationism==
{{also|Theory of justification#Criticisms}}
[[William Warren Bartley]] compared critical rationalism to the very general philosophical approach to knowledge which he called '''justificationism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, the view that scientific theories can be justified. Most justificationists do not know that they are justificationists. Justificationism is what Popper called a "subjectivist" view of truth, in which the question of whether some statement is true, is confused with the question of whether it can be justified (established, proven, verified, warranted, made well-founded, made reliable, grounded, supported, legitimated, based on evidence) in some way.

According to Bartley, some justificationists are positive about this mistake. They are naïve rationalists, and thinking that their knowledge can indeed be founded, in principle, it may be deemed certain to some degree, and rational.

Other justificationists are negative about these mistakes. They are epistemological relativists, and think (rightly, according to the critical rationalist) that you cannot ''find'' knowledge, that there is no source of epistemological absolutism. But they conclude (wrongly, according to the critical rationalist) that there is therefore no rationality, and no objective distinction to be made between the true and the false.

By dissolving justificationism itself, the critical rationalist (a proponent of '''non-justificationism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IEP |url-id=cr-ratio |title=Karl Popper and Critical Rationalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; regards knowledge and rationality, reason and science, as neither foundational nor infallible, but nevertheless does not think we must therefore all be relativists. Knowledge and truth still exist, just not in the way we thought.

==The pitfalls of justificationism and positivism==
[[File:Black Swans.jpg|thumb|300px|Are all swans white? The classical view of the philosophy of science is that it is the goal of science to “prove” such [[hypotheses]] or [[inductive reasoning|induce]] them from observational data. This seems hardly possible, since it would require us to infer a general rule from a number of individual cases, which is logically inadmissible. However, if we find one single black swan, logic allows us to conclude that the statement that all swans are white is false. Falsificationism thus strives for questioning, for falsification, of hypotheses instead of proving them.]]

The rejection of "positivist" approaches to knowledge occurs due to various pitfalls that positivism falls into.

1. The naïve [[empiricism]] of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] was shown to be illogical by Hume. A thousand observations of some event A coinciding with some event B does not allow one to logically infer that all A events coincide with B events. According to the critical rationalist, if there is a sense in which humans accrue knowledge positively by experience, it is only by pivoting observations off existing conjectural theories pertinent to the observations, or off underlying cognitive schemas which unconsciously handle perceptions and use them to generate new theories. But these new theories advanced in response to perceived particulars are not ''logically'' "induced" from them. These new theories may be wrong. The myth that we ''induce'' theories from particulars is persistent because ''when'' we do this we are often successful, but this is due to the advanced state of our evolved tendencies. If we were really "inducting" theories from particulars, it would be inductively logical to claim that the sun sets ''because'' I get up in the morning, or that all buses must have drivers in them (if you've never seen an empty bus).

2. [[Karl Popper|Popper]] and [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] showed in 1983&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' 302, April 21, "A Proof of the Impossibility of Inductive Probability"&lt;/ref&gt; that evidence supposed to partly support a hypothesis can, in fact, only be neutral to, or even be counter-supportive of the hypothesis.

3. Related to the point above, [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]],&lt;ref&gt;In his ''[[Critical Rationalism: A Restatement and Defence]]'', Chapter 3 "A Critique of Good Reasons"&lt;/ref&gt; attacks the use of "good reasons" in general (including evidence supposed to support the excess content of a hypothesis). He argues that good reasons are neither attainable, nor even desirable. Basically, Miller asserts that all arguments purporting to give valid support for a claim are either circular or question-begging. That is, if one provides a valid deductive argument (an inference from premises to a conclusion) for a given claim, then the content of the claim must already be contained within the premises of the argument (if it is not, then the argument is [[ampliative]] and so is invalid). Therefore, the claim is already presupposed by the premises, and is no more "supported" than are the assumptions upon which the claim rests, i.e. begging the question.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10532">'''Cyberformance''' refers to live theatrical performances in which remote participants are enabled to work together in real time through the medium of the internet, employing technologies such as chat applications or purpose-built, multiuser, real-time collaborative software (for example, [[UpStage]], Visitors Studio, the Waterwheel Tap, [[MOO]]s, and other platforms).  Cyberformance is also known as online performance, networked performance, telematic performance, and [[digital theatre]]; there is as yet no consensus on which term should be preferred, but cyberformance has the advantage of compactness. For example, it is commonly employed by users of the [[UpStage]] platform to designate a special type of [[Performance art]] activity taking place in a [[cyber-]]artistic environment.

Cyberformance can be created and presented entirely online, for a distributed online audience who participate via internet-connected computers anywhere in the world, or it can be presented to a proximal audience (such as in a physical theatre or gallery venue) with some or all of the performers appearing via the internet; or it can be a hybrid of the two approaches, with both remote and proximal audiences and/or performers.

==History and context==
The term 'cyberformance' (a [[portmanteau word]] blending 'cyberspace' with 'performance') was coined by the net artist and curator [[Helen Varley Jamieson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Online performances or virtual theatre has taken place in a number of the virtual environments that have emerged since the 1980s, including the multi-user virtual environments known as [[MUD]]s and [[MOO]]s in the 1970s, internet chat spaces (e.g. [[Internet Relay Chat]], or IRC) in the 1980s, the [[The Palace (computer program)|Palace graphical chatroom]] in the 1990s, and [[UpStage]], Visitors Studio, [[Second Life]], Waterwheel Tap and other platforms in the 2000s. Notable cyberformance groups and projects thus far include:

* [[The Hamnet Players]]. Founded by [[The Hamnet Players|Stuart Harris]], this group performed in IRC; their earliest performance was "Hamnet" in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marmot.org.uk/hamnet/ The Hamnet Players]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Plaintext Players]]. Founded by [[Antoinette LaFarge]], this group performs in MOOs and mixed reality spaces; their earliest performance was "Christmas" in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yin.arts.uci.edu/~players/ The Plaintext Players]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "ParkBench." Created by Nina Sobell and Emily Hartzell in 1994, this was a collaborative performance and drawing space using live video and a web browser interface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cat.nyu.edu/parkbench/ ParkBench]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Desktop Theater]]. Founded by Adriene Jenik and Lisa Brenneis, this group performed in the Palace; an example of their work is "waitingforgodot.com", 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desktoptheater.org/ Desktop Theater]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avatar Body ''Collision''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avatarbodycollision.org/ Avatar Body Collision]&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by [[Helen Varley Jamieson]], Karla Ptacek, Vicki Smith, and Leena Saarinen in 2002, this online performance collective uses [[UpStage]], a web-based software purpose-built for cyberformance with a New Zealand government grant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Features of cyberformance==
Cyberformance differs from [[Digital Performance|digital performance]], which refers to any kind of digitally mediated performance, including those with no significant networked element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The internet is often a subject and inspiration of the work as well as being the central enabling technology.

Cyberformers often work with the dual identities afforded by avatars, exploiting the gap between online persona and offline self.  They can also take advantage of the ease of switching between avatars in a way unavailable to 'proximal' actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Destructive dilemma'''&lt;ref&gt;Hurley, Patrick. A Concise Introduction to Logic With Ilrn Printed Access Card. Wadsworth Pub Co, 2008. Page 361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Parker&lt;/ref&gt; is the name of a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[rule of inference]] of [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]]. It is the [[inference]] that, if ''P'' implies ''Q'' and ''R'' implies ''S'' and either ''Q'' is false or ''S'' is false, then either ''P'' or ''R'' must be false. In sum, if two [[material conditional|conditionals]] are true, but one of their [[consequent]]s is false, then one of their [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]]s has to be false. ''Destructive dilemma'' is the [[Logical disjunction|disjunctive]] version of ''[[modus tollens]]''. The disjunctive version of ''[[modus ponens]]'' is the [[constructive dilemma]]. The rule can be stated:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P \to Q, R \to S, \neg Q \lor \neg S}{\therefore \neg P \lor \neg R}&lt;/math&gt;

where the rule is that wherever instances of "&lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt;", "&lt;math&gt;R \to S&lt;/math&gt;", and "&lt;math&gt;\neg Q \lor \neg S&lt;/math&gt;" appear on lines of a proof, "&lt;math&gt;\neg P \lor \neg R&lt;/math&gt;" can be placed on a subsequent line.

==Formal notation==
The ''destructive dilemma'' rule may be written in [[sequent]] notation:

: &lt;math&gt;(P \to Q), (R \to S), (\neg Q \lor \neg S) \vdash (\neg P \lor \neg R)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metalogic]]al symbol meaning that &lt;math&gt;\neg P \lor  \neg R&lt;/math&gt; is a [[logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] of &lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R \to S&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\neg Q \lor \neg S&lt;/math&gt; in some [[formal system|logical system]];

and expressed as a truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[theorem]] of propositional logic:

:&lt;math&gt;(((P \to Q) \land (R \to S)) \land (\neg Q \lor \neg S)) \to (\neg P \lor \neg R)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are propositions expressed in some [[formal system]].

==Natural language example==

:If it rains, we will stay inside.
:If it is sunny, we will go for a walk.
:Either we will not stay inside, or we will not go for a walk, or both.
:Therefore, either it will not rain, or it will not be sunny, or both.

'''Detention''' is the process whereby a [[State (polity)|state]] or private [[citizen]] lawfully holds a person by removing his or her [[personal freedom|freedom]] or [[liberty]] at that time. This can be due to (pending) [[criminal]] charges preferred against the individual pursuant to a [[prosecution]] or to [[protective custody|protect a person or property]]. Being detained does not always result in being taken to a particular area (generally called a detention centre), either for [[interrogation]] or as [[punishment]] for a [[crime]] (see [[prison]]).
[[File:Detencao.jpg|thumb|right|Detention in [[Brasília]].]] 

The term can also be used in reference to the holding of [[property]] for the same reasons. The process of detainment may or may not have been preceded or followed with an [[arrest]]. 

'''Detainee''' is a term used by certain governments and their [[armed forces]] to refer to individuals held in custody, such as those it does not classify and treat as either [[prisoners of war]] or [[suspect]]s in [[criminal]] cases.  It is used to refer to "any person captured or otherwise detained by an armed force."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-07-22/glossary.htm Global Security Glossary]. Accessed June 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, it means "someone held in custody."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn Princeton wordnet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050917065532/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn |date=2005-09-17 }}. Accessed June 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The prisoners in [[Guantánamo Bay]] are referred to as "detainees".

Article 9 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] provides that "[n]o one shall be subjected to [[arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]], detention or [[exile]]." In [[wars]] between nations, treatment of detainees is governed by the provisions of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Definition of detention==
Any form of [[imprisonment]] where a person's freedom of liberty is removed can be classed as detention, although the term is often associated with persons who are being held without [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] or charge before any have been raised. Being detained for the purposes of a drugs search is tantamount to a temporary [[arrest]], as it is not yet known whether charges can be brought against an individual, pending the outcome of the search. The term 'detained' often refers to the ''immediacy'' when someone has their liberty deprived, often before an arrest or pre-arrest procedure has yet been followed. For example, a shoplifter being pursued and restrained, but not yet informed he/she is under arrest or read his rights would be classed as 'detained'.

==Detention of a suspect==
{{main article|Remand (detention)}}
{{see also|Powers of the police in England and Wales#Detention}}

The detention of suspects is the process of keeping a person who has been [[arrest]]ed in a police-cell, remand [[prison]] or other detention centre before [[trial]] or [[sentence (law)|sentencing]].

The length of detention of suspected [[terrorism|terrorists]], with the justification of taking an action that would aid [[counter-terrorism]], varies according to country or situation, as well as the [[law]]s which regulate it.

The [[Terrorism Act 2006]] in the [[United Kingdom]] lengthened the 14-day limit for detention without an [[arrest warrant]] or an indictment from the [[Terrorism Act 2000]] to 28 days. A controversial [[Her Majesty's Government|Government]] proposal for an extension to 90 days was rejected by the [[House of Commons (UK)|House of Commons]]. [[English criminal law]] requires the detainer/arrestor to have reasonable grounds to suspect ([[reasonable suspicion]]) when detaining (or arresting) someone.

==Indefinite detention ==
{{see also|Internment|Administrative detention|Preventive detention}}
Indefinite detention of an individual occurs frequently in wartime under the [[laws of war]]. This has been applied notably by the [[United States]] after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. Before the [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s, created for reviewing the status of the [[Guantanamo detainee]]s, the United States has argued that it is engaged in a legally recognizable armed conflict to which the laws of war apply, and that it therefore may hold captured [[al Qaeda]] and [[Taliban]] operatives throughout the duration of that conflict, without granting them a criminal trial.

The U.S. military regulates treatment of detainees in the manual [[Military Police: Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees]], last revised in 1997.

The term "[[unlawful combatant]]" came into public awareness during and after the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)]], as the U.S. detained members of the [[Taliban]] and [[al-Qaeda]] captured in that war, and determined them to be [[unlawful combatant]]s.  This had generated considerable debate around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;In Depth: Afghanistan: The controversy over detainees: Are prisoners of war Canada's responsibility?", CBC web site, last updated April 27, 2007, found at [http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/afghanistan/detainees.html CBC News web site]. Accessed June 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government refers to these captured [[enemy combatants]] as "detainees" because they did not qualify as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] under the definition found in the [[Geneva Conventions]].

Under the Obama administration the term '''''enemy combatants''''' was also removed from the lexicon and further defined under the 2010 Defense Omnibus Bill:

Section 948b. Military commissions generally:  (a) Purpose-This chapter establishes procedures governing the use of military commissions to try '''''alien unprivileged enemy belligerents''''' for violations of the law of war and other offenses triable by military commission.

== Detention by country==

=== Netherlands ===
* Article 9, part 1a of [[Wetboek van Strafrecht]] states that there are 4 kinds of primary punishment. Two of them are two kinds of detentions, which are called ''gevangenisstraf'' and ''hechtenis'', where the first is a heavier punishment than the second. The two other kinds of punishment is light community service and fines.&lt;ref&gt;http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/EersteBoek/TitelII/Artikel9/geldigheidsdatum_27-12-2012&lt;/ref&gt; Prisons are designed in several ways and there are 5 levels of regimes (which depends on the crime committed). [[Nieuw Vosseveld]] is a long stay prison with the heaviest regime for the most dangerous criminals.  The prison is meant for criminals that have been sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment and longer.

'''Doreen Kimura''' (born Doreen Goebel 1933 in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] – February 27, 2013) was a Canadian psychologist who was professor at the [[University of Western Ontario]] and professor emeritus at [[Simon Fraser University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlifemoments.ca/sitepages/obituary.asp?oId=688604 |title=Doreen Kimura – Obituaries – London, ON – Your Life Moments |publisher=Yourlifemoments.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the founding president of the [[Society for Academic Freedom and Scholarship]].

==Career==
Kimura held a PhD in [[psychobiology]]. Her interests included the relationship between sex and cognition (see [[sex and intelligence]]) and promoting [[academic freedom]].

While some criticized [[Lawrence Summers]]' claims that differences in male-female representation in the sciences could be due to innate ability, Kimura supported him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sfu.ca/~dkimura/articles/hysteria.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050920220223/http://www.sfu.ca/~dkimura/articles/hysteria.htm |date=September 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a critic of [[affirmative action]], arguing that it is demeaning to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safs.ca/meritdiversity/kimura1.html |title=kimura1 |publisher=Safs.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also supported the concept of the biological origin of differences in cognitive ability between males and females (see also [[nature versus nurture]]).

According to the CISG's (Canadian Inter-Organizational Steering Group for Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology) 'Canadian Guidelines on Auditory Processing Disorder in Children and Adults: Assessment and Intervention' (December 2012), "In 1961, Doreen Kimura proposed a theory that would attempt to explain dichotic listening abilities in humans. As a testament to her theory, her views on dichotic processing of auditory information recently celebrated a 50th anniversary."

==Personal life==
Kimura was the mother of Charlotte Thistle, grandmother of Ella Archer, and sister of Shelagh Derouin and Amber Harvey.

In [[particle physics]], an '''elementary particle''' or '''fundamental particle''' is a [[&lt;!-- wiktionary:particle| --&gt;subatomic particle]] with no  substructure, thus not composed of other particles.&lt;ref name="PFIp1-3"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particles currently thought to be elementary include the fundamental [[fermion]]s ([[quark]]s, [[lepton]]s, [[antiquark]]s, and [[antilepton]]s), which generally are "matter particles" and "[[antimatter]] particles", as well as the fundamental [[boson]]s ([[gauge boson]]s and the [[Higgs boson]]), which generally are "force particles" that mediate [[fundamental interaction|interactions]] among fermions.&lt;ref name="PFIp1-3"/&gt; A particle containing two or more elementary particles is a ''[[list of particles|composite particle]]''.

[[Matter|Everyday matter]] is composed of [[atom]]s, once presumed to be matter's elementary particles—''atom'' meaning "unable to cut" in Greek—although the atom's existence remained controversial until about 1910, as some leading physicists regarded molecules as mathematical illusions, and matter as ultimately composed of energy.&lt;ref name="PFIp1-3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

All elementary particles are—depending on their ''[[spin (physics)|spin]]''—either [[boson]]s or [[fermion]]s. These are differentiated via the [[spin–statistics theorem]] of [[quantum statistics]]. Particles of ''[[half-integer]]'' spin exhibit [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] and are fermions.&lt;ref name="PFIp1-3"/&gt; Particles of ''[[integer]]'' spin, in other words full-integer, exhibit [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] and are bosons.&lt;ref name="PFIp1-3"/&gt;

== Common elementary particles ==
{{main | Cosmic abundance of elements }}

According to the current models of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|big bang nucleosynthesis]], the primordial composition of visible matter of the universe should be about 75% hydrogen and 25% helium-4 (in mass). Neutrons are made up of one up and two down quarks, while protons are made of two up and one down quark. Since the other common elementary particles (such as electrons, neutrinos, or weak bosons) are so light or so rare when compared to atomic nuclei, we can neglect their mass contribution to the observable universe's total mass. Therefore, one can conclude that most of the visible mass of the universe consists of protons and neutrons, which, like all [[baryon]]s, in turn consist of up quarks and down quarks.

Some estimates imply that there are roughly {{10^|80}} baryons (almost entirely protons and neutrons) in the observable universe.&lt;ref name="heile"&gt;

The number of protons in the observable universe is called the [[Eddington number]].

In terms of number of particles, some estimates imply that nearly all the matter, excluding [[dark matter]], occurs in neutrinos, and that roughly {{10^|86}} elementary particles of matter exist in the visible universe, mostly neutrinos.&lt;ref name="mrob"&gt;

== Standard Model ==
{{main|Standard Model}}
The Standard Model of particle physics contains 12 flavors of elementary [[fermion]]s, plus their corresponding [[antiparticle]]s, as well as elementary bosons that mediate the forces and the [[Higgs boson]], which was reported on July 4, 2012, as having been likely detected by the two main experiments at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] ([[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] and [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]]). However, the Standard Model is widely considered to be a provisional theory rather than a truly fundamental one, since it is not known if it is compatible with [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]]. There may be hypothetical elementary particles not described by the Standard Model, such as the [[graviton]], the particle that would carry the [[gravity|gravitational force]], and [[superpartner|sparticle]]s, [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] partners of the ordinary particles.

=== Fundamental fermions ===
{{main|Fermion}}

The 12&amp;nbsp;fundamental fermions are divided into 3&amp;nbsp;[[generation (particle physics)|generations]] of 4&amp;nbsp;particles each. Half of the fermions are [[lepton]]s, three of which have an electric charge of &amp;minus;1, called the electron ({{Subatomic particle|electron-}}), the [[muon]] ({{Subatomic particle|muon-}}), and the [[tau (particle)|tau]] ({{Subatomic particle|tau-}}), the other three leptons are [[neutrino]]s ({{Subatomic particle|electron neutrino}}, {{Subatomic particle|muon neutrino}}, {{Subatomic particle|tau neutrino}}), which are the only elementary fermions with no electric or color charge. The remaining six particles are [[quark]]s (discussed below).

====Mass====
The following table lists current measured masses and mass estimates for all the fermions, using the same scale of measure: [[Electronvolt|millions of electron-volts (MeV)]]. For example, the most accurately known quark mass is of the top quark ({{Subatomic particle|top quark}}) at 172.7&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|GeV]]/c² or 172&amp;nbsp;700&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|MeV]]/c², estimated using the [[On-shell scheme]].

Estimates of the values of quark masses depend on the version of [[quantum chromodynamics]] used to describe quark interactions. Quarks are always confined in an envelope of [[gluons]] which confer vastly greater mass to the [[mesons]] and [[baryons]] where quarks occur, so values for quark masses cannot be measured directly. Since their masses are so small compared to the effective mass of the surrounding gluons, slight differences in the calculation make large differences in the masses.

==== Antiparticles ====
{{main|Antimatter}}

There are also 12&amp;nbsp;fundamental fermionic antiparticles that correspond to these 12&amp;nbsp;particles.  For example, the [[antielectron]] (positron) ''{{Subatomic particle|antielectron}}'' is the electron's antiparticle and has an electric charge of +1.

==== Quarks ====
{{main|Quark}}

Isolated quarks and antiquarks have never been detected, a fact explained by [[Colour confinement|confinement]]. Every quark carries one of three [[color charge]]s of the [[strong interaction]]; antiquarks similarly carry anticolor. Color-charged particles interact via [[gluon]] exchange in the same way that charged particles interact via [[photon]] exchange. However, gluons are themselves color-charged, resulting in an amplification of the strong force as color-charged particles are separated. Unlike the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic force]], which diminishes as charged particles separate, color-charged particles feel increasing force.

However, color-charged particles may combine to form color neutral [[composite particle]]s called [[hadron]]s. A quark may pair up with an antiquark: the quark has a color and the antiquark has the corresponding anticolor. The color and anticolor cancel out, forming a color neutral [[meson]]. Alternatively, three quarks can exist together, one quark being "red", another "blue", another "green". These three colored quarks together form a color-neutral [[baryon]]. Symmetrically, three antiquarks with the colors "antired", "antiblue" and "antigreen" can form a color-neutral [[antibaryon]].

Quarks also carry fractional [[electric charge]]s, but, since they are confined within hadrons whose charges are all integral, fractional charges have never been isolated. Note that quarks have electric charges of either +{{2/3}} or −{{1/3}}, whereas antiquarks have corresponding electric charges of either −{{2/3}} or +{{1/3}}.

Evidence for the existence of quarks comes from [[deep inelastic scattering]]: firing [[electron]]s at [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] to determine the distribution of charge within [[nucleon]]s (which are baryons). If the charge is uniform, the [[electric field]] around the proton should be uniform and the electron should scatter elastically. Low-energy electrons do scatter in this way, but, above a particular energy, the protons deflect some electrons through large angles. The recoiling electron has much less energy and a [[jet (particle physics)|jet of particles]] is emitted. This inelastic scattering suggests that the charge in the proton is not uniform but split among smaller charged particles: quarks.

=== Fundamental bosons ===
{{main|Boson}}

In the Standard Model, vector ([[spin (physics)|spin]]-1) bosons ([[gluon]]s, [[photon]]s, and the [[W and Z bosons]]) mediate forces, whereas the [[Higgs boson]] (spin-0) is responsible for the intrinsic [[mass]] of particles. Bosons differ from fermions in the fact that multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state ([[Pauli exclusion principle]]). Also, bosons can be either elementary, like photons, or a combination, like [[meson]]s. The spin of bosons are integers instead of half integers.

==== Gluons ====
{{main|Gluon}}

Gluons mediate the [[strong interaction]], which join quarks and thereby form [[hadron]]s, which are either [[baryon]]s (three quarks) or [[meson]]s (one quark and one antiquark).  Protons and neutrons are baryons, joined by gluons to form the [[atomic nucleus]].  Like quarks, gluons exhibit [[color charge|color]] and anticolor—unrelated to the concept of visual color—sometimes in combinations, altogether eight variations of gluons.

==== Electroweak bosons ====
{{main|W and Z bosons|Photon}}

There are three [[weak gauge boson]]s: ''W&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''W&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;'', and ''Z&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''; these mediate the [[weak interaction]]. The W bosons are known for their mediation in nuclear decay. The ''W&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;'' converts a neutron into a proton then decay into an electron and electron antineutrino pair. The ''Z&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;'' does not convert charge but rather changes momentum and is the only mechanism for elastically scattering neutrinos. The weak gauge bosons were discovered due to momentum change in electrons from neutrino-Z exchange. The massless [[photon]] mediates the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]]. These four gauge bosons form the electroweak interaction among elementary particles.

==== Higgs boson ====
{{main|Higgs boson}}

Although the weak and electromagnetic forces appear quite different to us at everyday energies, the two forces are theorized to unify as a single [[electroweak force]] at high energies. This prediction was clearly confirmed by measurements of cross-sections for high-energy electron-proton scattering at the [[Hadron Elektron Ring Anlage|HERA]] collider at [[DESY]].  The differences at low energies is a consequence of the high masses of the ''W'' and ''Z'' bosons, which in turn are a consequence of the [[Higgs mechanism]]. Through the process of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], the Higgs selects a special direction in electroweak space that causes three electroweak particles to become very heavy (the weak bosons) and one to remain massless (the photon). On 4 July 2012, after many years of experimentally searching for evidence of its existence, the [[Higgs boson]] was announced to have been observed at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. [[Peter Higgs]] who first posited the existence of the Higgs boson was present at the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[statistical significance]] of this discovery was reported as 5-sigma, which implies a certainty of roughly 99.99994%. In particle physics, this is the level of significance required to officially label experimental observations as a [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]]. Research into the properties of the newly discovered particle continues.

==== Graviton ====

{{main|Graviton}}

The [[graviton]] is a hypothetical elementary spin-2 particle proposed to mediate gravitation. While it remains undiscovered due to [[Graviton#Experimental observation|the difficulty inherent in its detection]], it is sometimes included in tables of elementary particles.&lt;ref name="PFIp1-3"/&gt; The conventional graviton is massless, although there exist models containing massive [[Kaluza–Klein theory|Kaluza–Klein]] gravitons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 0910.1535|bibcode = 2010PhLB..682..446C|title = Massless versus Kaluza-Klein gravitons at the LHC|journal = Physics Letters B|volume = 682|issue = 4–5|pages = 446–449|last1 = Calmet|first1 = Xavier|last2 = De Aquino|first2 = Priscila|last3 = Rizzo|first3 = Thomas G.|year = 2010|doi = 10.1016/j.physletb.2009.11.045|hdl = 2078/31706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beyond the Standard Model ==

Although experimental evidence overwhelmingly confirms the predictions derived from the [[Standard Model]], some of its parameters were added arbitrarily, not determined by a particular explanation, which remain mysteries, for instance the [[hierarchy problem]]. Theories [[beyond the Standard Model]] attempt to resolve these shortcomings.

=== Grand unification ===
{{main|Grand Unified Theory}}

One extension of the Standard Model attempts to combine the [[electroweak interaction]] with the [[strong interaction]] into a single 'grand unified theory' (GUT). Such a force would be [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] into the three forces by a [[Higgs mechanism|Higgs-like mechanism]]. The most dramatic prediction of grand unification is the existence of [[X and Y bosons]], which cause [[proton decay]]. However, the non-observation of proton decay at the [[Super-Kamiokande]] neutrino observatory rules out the simplest GUTs, including SU(5) and SO(10).

=== Supersymmetry ===
{{main|Supersymmetry}}

Supersymmetry extends the Standard Model by adding another class of symmetries to the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]. These symmetries exchange [[fermion]]ic particles with [[boson]]ic ones. Such a symmetry predicts the existence of [[supersymmetric particle]]s, abbreviated as ''[[sparticle]]s'', which include the [[slepton]]s, [[squark]]s, [[neutralino]]s, and [[chargino]]s. Each particle in the Standard Model would have a superpartner whose [[spin (physics)|spin]] differs by {{1/2}} from the ordinary particle. Due to the [[supersymmetry breaking|breaking of supersymmetry]], the sparticles are much heavier than their ordinary counterparts; they are so heavy that existing [[particle collider]]s would not be powerful enough to produce them. However, some physicists believe that sparticles will be detected by the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]].

=== String theory ===
{{main|String theory}}

String theory is a model of physics where all "particles" that make up [[matter]] are composed of strings (measuring at the Planck length) that exist in an 11-dimensional (according to [[M-theory]], the leading version) or 12-dimensional (according to [[F-theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Cumrun Vafa. "Evidence for F-theory." ''Nucl.Phys.'' '''B'''469: 403-418,1996
[[DOI:10.1016/0550-3213(96)00172-1]]. [[arXiv]]: [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9602022 hep-th/9602022]&lt;/ref&gt;) universe.  These strings vibrate at different frequencies that determine mass, electric charge, color charge, and spin.  A string can be open (a line) or closed in a loop (a one-dimensional sphere, like a circle).  As a string moves through space it sweeps out something called a ''[[world line#World lines as a tool to describe events|world sheet]]''.  String theory predicts 1- to 10-branes (a 1-[[Membrane (M-theory)|brane]] being a string and a 10-brane being a 10-dimensional object) that prevent tears in the "fabric" of space using the [[uncertainty principle]] (e.g., the electron orbiting a hydrogen atom has the probability, albeit small, that it could be anywhere else in the universe at any given moment).

String theory proposes that our universe is merely a 4-brane, inside which exist the 3 space dimensions and the 1 time dimension that we observe.  The remaining 7 theoretical dimensions either are very tiny and curled up (and too small to be macroscopically accessible) or simply do not/cannot exist in our universe (because they exist in a grander scheme called the "[[multiverse]]" outside our known universe).

Some predictions of the string theory include existence of extremely massive counterparts of ordinary particles due to vibrational excitations of the fundamental string and existence of a massless spin-2 particle behaving like the [[graviton]].

=== Technicolor ===
{{main|Technicolor (physics)}}

Technicolor theories try to modify the Standard Model in a minimal way by introducing a new QCD-like interaction. This means one adds a new theory of so-called Techniquarks, interacting via so called Technigluons. The main idea is that the Higgs-Boson is not an elementary particle but a bound state of these objects.

=== Preon theory ===
{{main|Preon}}

According to preon theory there are one or more orders of particles more fundamental than those (or most of those) found in the Standard Model. The most fundamental of these are normally called preons, which is derived from "pre-quarks". In essence, preon theory tries to do for the Standard Model what the Standard Model did for the [[particle zoo]] that came before it. Most models assume that almost everything in the Standard Model can be explained in terms of three to half a dozen more fundamental particles and the rules that govern their interactions. Interest in preons has waned since the simplest models were experimentally ruled out in the 1980s.

=== Acceleron theory ===
Accelerons are the hypothetical [[subatomic particle]]s that integrally link the newfound mass of the [[neutrino]] to the [[dark energy]] conjectured to be accelerating the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]].&lt;ref name=acceleron/&gt;

In theory, neutrinos are influenced by a new force resulting from their interactions with accelerons. Dark energy results as the universe tries to pull neutrinos apart.&lt;ref name=acceleron&gt;

In [[theoretical physics]], '''Feynman diagrams''' are pictorial representations of the mathematical expressions describing the behavior of [[subatomic particle]]s. The scheme is named after its inventor, American physicist [[Richard Feynman]], and was first introduced in 1948. The interaction of sub-atomic particles can be complex and difficult to understand intuitively. Feynman diagrams give a simple visualization of what would otherwise be an arcane and abstract formula. As [[David Kaiser]] writes, "since the middle of the 20th century, theoretical physicists have increasingly turned to this tool to help them undertake critical calculations", and so "Feynman diagrams have revolutionized nearly every aspect of theoretical physics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaiser |first=David |year=2005 |title=Physics and Feynman's Diagrams |url=http://web.mit.edu/dikaiser/www/FdsAmSci.pdf |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=93 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the diagrams are applied primarily to [[quantum field theory]], they can also be used in other fields, such as [[solid-state physics|solid-state theory]].

Feynman used [[Ernst Stueckelberg]]'s interpretation of the [[positron]] as if it were an electron moving backward in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feynman |first=Richard |title=The Theory of Positrons |journal=Physical Review |issue=76 |year=1949 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.76.749 |volume=76 |pages=749 |bibcode = 1949PhRv...76..749F |quote="In this solution, the "negative energy states" appear in a form which may be pictured (as by Stückelberg) in space-time as waves traveling away from the external potential backwards in time. Experimentally, such a wave corresponds to a positron approaching the potential and annihilating the electron."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[antiparticle]]s are represented as moving backward along the time axis in Feynman diagrams.

The calculation of [[probability amplitude]]s in theoretical particle physics requires the use of rather large and complicated integrals over a large number of variables. These integrals do, however, have a regular structure, and may be represented graphically as Feynman diagrams.

A Feynman diagram is a contribution of a particular class of particle paths, which join and split as described by the diagram. More precisely, and technically, a Feynman diagram is a graphical representation of a [[perturbative]] contribution to the [[transition amplitude]] or correlation function of a quantum mechanical or statistical field theory. Within the [[canonical quantization|canonical]] formulation of quantum field theory, a Feynman diagram represents a term in the [[Wick's theorem|Wick's expansion]] of the perturbative [[S-matrix|{{mvar|S}}-matrix]]. Alternatively, the [[path integral formulation]] of quantum field theory represents the transition amplitude as a weighted sum of all possible histories of the system from the initial to the final state, in terms of either particles or fields. The transition amplitude is then given as the matrix element of the {{mvar|S}}-matrix between the initial and the final states of the quantum system.

== Motivation and history ==
[[File:Kaon-Decay.svg|301px|thumb|right|In this diagram, a [[kaon]], made of an up and anti-strange quark, decays both [[Weak interaction|weakly]] and strongly into three [[pion]]s, with intermediate steps involving a [[W and Z bosons|W boson]] and a [[gluon]] (represented by the blue sine wave and green spiral, respectively).]]

When calculating [[scattering cross-section]]s in [[particle physics]], the interaction between particles can be described by starting from a [[free field]] that describes the incoming and outgoing particles, and including an interaction [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] to describe how the particles deflect one another. The amplitude for scattering is the sum of each possible interaction history over all possible intermediate particle states. The number of times the interaction Hamiltonian acts is the order of the [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation expansion]], and the time-dependent perturbation theory for fields is known as the [[Dyson series]]. When the intermediate states at intermediate times are energy [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenstates]] (collections of particles with a definite momentum) the series is called [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)#Time-dependent perturbation theory|old-fashioned perturbation theory]].

The Dyson series can be alternatively rewritten as a sum over Feynman diagrams, where at each vertex both the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] are [[conservation law|conserved]], but where the length of the [[four-momentum|energy-momentum four-vector]] is not necessarily equal to the mass. The Feynman diagrams are much easier to keep track of than “old-fashioned” terms, because the old-fashioned way treats the particle and antiparticle contributions as separate. Each Feynman diagram is the sum of exponentially many old-fashioned terms, because each internal line can separately represent either a particle or an antiparticle. In a non-relativistic theory, there are no antiparticles and there is no doubling, so each Feynman diagram includes only one term.

Feynman gave a prescription for calculating the amplitude ([[#Feynman rules|the Feynman rules, below]]) for any given diagram from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|field theory Lagrangian]]. Each internal line corresponds to a factor of the [[virtual particle]]'s [[propagator]]; each vertex where lines meet gives a factor derived from an interaction term in the Lagrangian, and incoming and outgoing lines carry an energy, momentum, and [[spin (physics)|spin]].

In addition to their value as a mathematical tool, Feynman diagrams provide deep physical insight into the nature of particle interactions. Particles interact in every way available; in fact, intermediate virtual particles are allowed to propagate faster than light. The probability of each final state is then obtained by summing over all such possibilities. This is closely tied to the [[functional integral]] formulation of [[quantum mechanics]], also invented by Feynman—see [[path integral formulation]].

The naïve application of such calculations often produces diagrams whose amplitudes are [[infinity|infinite]], because the short-distance particle interactions require a careful limiting procedure, to include particle [[self-interaction]]s. The technique of [[renormalization]], suggested by [[Ernst Stueckelberg]] and [[Hans Bethe]] and implemented by [[Freeman Dyson|Dyson]], Feynman, [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]], and [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga|Tomonaga]] compensates for this effect and eliminates the troublesome infinities. After renormalization, calculations using Feynman diagrams match experimental results with very high accuracy.

Feynman diagram and path integral methods are also used in [[statistical mechanics]] and can even be applied to [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |authors=R. Penco, D.

=== Alternative names ===
[[Murray Gell-Mann]] always referred to Feynman diagrams as '''Stueckelberg diagrams''', after a Swiss physicist, [[Ernst Stueckelberg]], who devised a similar notation many years earlier. Stueckelberg was motivated by the need for a manifestly covariant formalism for quantum field theory, but did not provide as automated a way to handle symmetry factors and loops, although he was first to find the correct physical interpretation in terms of forward and backward in time particle paths, all without the path-integral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=George Johnson |title=The Jaguar and the Fox |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2000/07/johnson.htm |work=The Atlantic |date=July 2000 |access-date=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historically, as a book-keeping device of covariant perturbation theory, the graphs were called '''Feynman–Dyson diagrams''' or '''Dyson graphs''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Gribbin, John and Mary |title=Richard Feynman: A Life in Science |publisher=Penguin-Putnam |year=1997 |chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the path integral was unfamiliar when they were introduced, and [[Freeman Dyson]]'s derivation from old-fashioned perturbation theory was easier to follow for physicists trained in earlier methods.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;"It was Dyson's contribution to indicate how Feynman's visual insights could be used [...] He realized that Feynman diagrams [...] can also be viewed as a representation of the logical content of field theories (as stated in their perturbative expansions)". Schwebber, op.cit (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Feynman had to lobby hard for the diagrams, which confused the establishment physicists trained in equations and graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Leonard |last=Mlodinow |title=Feynman's Rainbow |publisher=Vintage |year=2011 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representation of physical reality ==
In their presentations of [[fundamental interactions]],&lt;ref&gt;Gerardus 't Hooft, Martinus Veltman, ''Diagrammar'', CERN Yellow Report 1973, reprinted in G. 't Hooft, ''Under the Spell of Gauge Principle'' (World Scientific, Singapore, 1994), Introduction [http://preprints.cern.ch/cgi-bin/setlink?base=cernrep&amp;categ=Yellow_Report&amp;id=1973-009 online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martinus Veltman, ''Diagrammatica: The Path to Feynman Diagrams'', Cambridge Lecture Notes in Physics, {{ISBN|0-521-45692-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; written from the particle physics perspective, [[Gerard 't Hooft]] and [[Martinus Veltman]] gave good arguments for taking the original, non-regularized Feynman diagrams as the most succinct representation of our present knowledge about the physics of quantum scattering of [[fundamental particles]]. Their motivations are consistent with the convictions of [[James Daniel Bjorken]] and [[Sidney Drell]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. D. |last=Bjorken |first2=S. D. |last2=Drell |title=Relativistic Quantum Fields |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1965 |page=viii }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Feynman graphs and rules of calculation summarize [[quantum field theory]] in a form in close contact with the experimental numbers one wants to understand. Although the statement of the theory in terms of graphs may imply [[perturbation theory]], use of graphical methods in the [[many-body problem]] shows that this formalism is flexible enough to deal with phenomena of nonperturbative characters … Some modification of the [[Feynman rules]] of calculation may well outlive the elaborate mathematical structure of local canonical quantum field theory …&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So far there are no opposing opinions. In [[quantum field theories]] the Feynman diagrams are obtained from [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] by Feynman rules.

[[Dimensional regularization]] is a method for [[regularization (physics)|regularizing]] [[integral]]s in the evaluation of Feynman diagrams; it assigns values to them that are [[meromorphic function]]s of an auxiliary complex parameter {{mvar|d}}, called the dimension.  Dimensional regularization writes a [[Feynman integral]] as an integral depending on the spacetime dimension {{mvar|d}} and spacetime points.

== Particle-path interpretation ==
A Feynman diagram is a representation of quantum field theory processes in terms of [[Elementary particle|particle]] interactions. The particles are represented by the lines of the diagram, which can be squiggly or straight, with an arrow or without, depending on the type of particle. A point where lines connect to other lines is a ''vertex'', and this is where the particles meet and interact: by emitting or absorbing new particles, deflecting one another, or changing type.

There are three different types of lines: ''internal lines'' connect two vertices, ''incoming lines'' extend from "the past" to a vertex and represent an initial state, and ''outgoing lines'' extend from a vertex to "the future" and represent the final state (the latter two are also known as ''external lines''). Traditionally, the bottom of the diagram is the past and the top the future; other times, the past is to the left and the future to the right. When calculating [[correlation functions]] instead of [[scattering amplitude]]s, there is no past and future and all the lines are internal. The particles then begin and end on little x's, which represent the positions of the operators whose correlation is being calculated.

Feynman diagrams are a pictorial representation of a contribution to the total amplitude for a process that can happen in several different ways. When a group of incoming particles are to scatter off each other, the process can be thought of as one where the particles travel over all possible paths, including paths that go backward in time.

Feynman diagrams are often confused with [[spacetime diagram]]s and [[bubble chamber]] images because they all describe particle scattering. Feynman diagrams are [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] that represent the interaction of particles rather than the physical position of the particle during a scattering process. Unlike a bubble chamber picture, only the sum of all the Feynman diagrams represent any given particle interaction; particles do not choose a particular diagram each time they interact. The law of summation is in accord with the [[quantum superposition|principle of superposition]]—every diagram contributes to the total amplitude for the process.

A Feynman diagram represents a perturbative contribution to the amplitude of a quantum transition from some initial quantum state to some final quantum state.

For example, in the process of electron-positron annihilation the initial state is one electron and one positron, the final state: two photons.

The initial state is often assumed to be at the left of the diagram and the final state at the right (although other conventions are also used quite often).

A Feynman diagram consists of points, called vertices, and lines attached to the vertices.

The particles in the initial state are depicted by lines sticking out in the direction of the initial state (e.g., to the left), the particles in the final state are represented by lines sticking out in the direction of the final state (e.g., to the right).

In [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]] there are two types of particles: matter particles such as electrons or positrons (called [[fermions]]) and exchange particles (called [[gauge bosons]]). They are represented in Feynman diagrams as follows:
# Electron in the initial state is represented by a solid line, with an arrow indicating the spin of the particle e.g. pointing toward the vertex (→•).
# Electron in the final state is represented by a line, with an arrow indicating the spin of the particle e.g. pointing away from the vertex: (•→).
# Positron in the initial state is represented by a solid line, with an arrow indicating the spin of the particle e.g. pointing away from the vertex: (←•).
# Positron in the final state is represented by a line, with an arrow indicating the spin of the particle e.g. pointing toward the vertex: (•←).
# Virtual Photon in the initial and the final state is represented by a wavy line (&lt;big&gt;~•&lt;/big&gt; and &lt;big&gt;•~&lt;/big&gt;).

In QED a vertex always has three lines attached to it: one bosonic line, one fermionic line with arrow toward the vertex, and one fermionic line with arrow away from the vertex.

The vertices might be connected by a bosonic or fermionic [[propagator]]. A bosonic propagator is represented by a wavy line connecting two vertices (•~•). A fermionic propagator is represented by a solid line (with an arrow in one or another direction) connecting two vertices, (•←•).

The number of vertices gives the order of the term in the perturbation series expansion of the transition amplitude.

=== Electron–positron annihilation example ===
[[File:Feynman EP Annihilation.svg|thumb|Feynman diagram of electron/positron annihilation]]

The electron–positron annihilation interaction:

:e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2γ

has a contribution from the second order Feynman diagram shown adjacent:

In the initial state (at the bottom; early time) there is one electron (e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and one positron (e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and in the final state (at the top; late time) there are two photons (γ).

== Canonical quantization formulation ==
The [[probability amplitude]] for a transition of a quantum system from the initial state {{math|{{ket|''i''}}}} to the final state {{math|{{ket| ''f'' }}}} is given by the matrix element

:&lt;math&gt;S_{fi}=\langle f|S|i\rangle\;,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|S}} is the [[S-matrix|{{mvar|S}}-matrix]].

In the canonical quantum field theory the {{mvar|S}}-matrix is represented within the [[interaction picture]] by the perturbation series in the powers of the interaction Lagrangian,

:&lt;math&gt;S=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{i^n}{n!}\int\prod_{j=1}^n d^4 x_j T\prod_{j=1}^n L_v\left(x_j\right)\equiv\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}S^{(n)}\;,
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|L&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the interaction Lagrangian and {{mvar|T}} signifies the time-ordered product of operators.

A Feynman diagram is a graphical representation of a term in the [[Wick's theorem|Wick's expansion]] of the time-ordered product in the {{mvar|n}}th order term {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;}} of the {{mvar|S}}-matrix,

:&lt;math&gt;T\prod_{j=1}^nL_v\left(x_j\right)=\sum_{\text{all possible} \atop \text{contractions}}(\pm)N\prod_{j=1}^nL_v\left(x_j\right)\;,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|N}} signifies the [[Normal order|normal-product]] of the operators and (±) takes care of the possible sign change when commuting the fermionic operators to bring them together for a contraction (a [[propagator]]).

=== Feynman rules ===
The diagrams are drawn according to the Feynman rules, which depend upon the interaction Lagrangian. For the [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]] interaction Lagrangian
:&lt;math&gt;L_v=-g\bar\psi\gamma^\mu\psi A_\mu&lt;/math&gt;
describing the interaction of a fermionic field {{mvar|ψ}} with a bosonic gauge field {{mvar|A&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the Feynman rules can be formulated in coordinate space as follows:

# Each integration coordinate {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}} is represented by a point (sometimes called a vertex);
# A bosonic [[propagator]] is represented by a wiggly line connecting two points;
# A fermionic propagator is represented by a solid line connecting two points;
# A bosonic field &lt;math&gt;A_\mu(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; is represented by a wiggly line attached to the point {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}};
# A fermionic field {{math|''ψ''(''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is represented by a solid line attached to the point {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} with an arrow toward the point;
# An anti-fermionic field {{math|{{overline|''ψ''}}(''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is represented by a solid line attached to the point {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} with an arrow away from the point;

=== Example: second order processes in QED ===
The second order perturbation term in the {{mvar|S}}-matrix is

:&lt;math&gt;S^{(2)}=\frac{(ie)^2}{2!}\int d^4x\, d^4x'\, T\bar\psi(x)\,\gamma^\mu\,\psi(x)\,A_\mu(x)\,\bar\psi(x')\,\gamma^\nu\,\psi(x')\,A_\nu(x').\;&lt;/math&gt;

==== Scattering of fermions ====

    |}
The [[Wick's theorem|Wick's expansion]] of the integrand gives (among others) the following term

:&lt;math&gt;N\bar\psi(x)\gamma^\mu\psi(x)\bar\psi(x')\gamma^\nu\psi(x')\underline{A_\mu(x)A_\nu(x')}\;,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{A_\mu(x)A_\nu(x')}=\int\frac{d^4k}{(2\pi)^4}\frac{-ig_{\mu\nu}}{k^2+i0}e^{-ik(x-x')}&lt;/math&gt;

is the electromagnetic contraction (propagator) in the Feynman gauge. This term is represented by the Feynman diagram at the right. This diagram gives contributions to the following processes:
# e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; scattering (initial state at the right, final state at the left of the diagram);
# e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; scattering (initial state at the left, final state at the right of the diagram);
# e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; scattering (initial state at the bottom/top, final state at the top/bottom of the diagram).

==== Compton scattering and annihilation/generation of e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pairs ====
Another interesting term in the expansion is

:&lt;math&gt;N\bar\psi(x)\,\gamma^\mu\,\underline{\psi(x)\,\bar\psi(x')}\,\gamma^\nu\,\psi(x')\,A_\mu(x)\,A_\nu(x')\;,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{\psi(x)\bar\psi(x')}=\int\frac{d^4p}{(2\pi)^4}\frac{i}{\gamma p-m+i0}e^{-ip(x-x')}&lt;/math&gt;

is the fermionic contraction (propagator).

== Path integral formulation ==
In a [[path integral formulation|path integral]], the field Lagrangian, integrated over all possible field histories, defines the probability amplitude to go from one field configuration to another. In order to make sense, the field theory should have a well-defined [[ground state]], and the integral should be performed a little bit rotated into imaginary time, i.e. a [[Wick rotation]].

=== Scalar field Lagrangian ===
A simple example is the free relativistic scalar field in {{mvar|d}} dimensions, whose action integral is:
:&lt;math&gt; S = \int \tfrac12 \partial_\mu \phi \partial^\mu \phi\, d^dx \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The probability amplitude for a process is:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_A^B e^{iS}\, D\phi\,, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are space-like hypersurfaces that define the boundary conditions. The collection of all the {{math|''φ''(''A'')}} on the starting hypersurface give the initial value of the field, analogous to the starting position for a point particle, and the field values {{math|''φ''(''B'')}} at each point of the final hypersurface defines the final field value, which is allowed to vary, giving a different amplitude to end up at different values. This is the field-to-field transition amplitude.

The path integral gives the expectation value of operators between the initial and final state:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_A^B e^{iS} \phi(x_1) \cdots \phi(x_n) \,D\phi = \left\langle A\left| \phi(x_1) \cdots \phi(x_n) \right|B \right\rangle\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and in the limit that A and B recede to the infinite past and the infinite future, the only contribution that matters is from the ground state (this is only rigorously true if the path-integral is defined slightly rotated into imaginary time). The path integral can be thought of as analogous to a probability distribution, and it is convenient to define it so that multiplying by a constant doesn't change anything:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\displaystyle\int e^{iS} \phi(x_1) \cdots \phi(x_n) \,D\phi }{ \displaystyle\int e^{iS} \,D\phi } = \left\langle 0 \left| \phi(x_1) \cdots \phi(x_n) \right|0\right\rangle \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The normalization factor on the bottom is called the ''partition function'' for the field, and it coincides with the statistical mechanical partition function at zero temperature when rotated into imaginary time.

The initial-to-final amplitudes are ill-defined if one thinks of the continuum limit right from the beginning, because the fluctuations in the field can become unbounded. So the path-integral can be thought of as on a discrete square lattice, with lattice spacing {{mvar|a}} and the limit {{math|''a'' → 0}} should be taken carefully{{clarify|date=May 2016}}. If the final results do not depend on the shape of the lattice or the value of {{mvar|a}}, then the continuum limit exists.

=== On a lattice ===
On a lattice, (i), the field can be expanded in [[Fourier series|Fourier modes]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x) = \int \frac{dk}{(2\pi)^d} \phi(k) e^{ik\cdot x} = \int_k \phi(k) e^{ikx}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the integration domain is over {{mvar|k}} restricted to a cube of side length {{math|{{sfrac|2π|''a''}}}}, so that large values of {{mvar|k}} are not allowed. It is important to note that the {{mvar|k}}-measure contains the factors of 2{{pi}} from Fourier transforms, this is the best standard convention for {{mvar|k}}-integrals in QFT. The lattice means that fluctuations at large {{mvar|k}} are not allowed to contribute right away, they only start to contribute in the limit {{math|''a'' → 0}}. Sometimes, instead of a lattice, the field modes are just cut off at high values of {{mvar|k}} instead.

It is also convenient from time to time to consider the space-time volume to be finite, so that the {{mvar|k}} modes are also a lattice. This is not strictly as necessary as the space-lattice limit, because interactions in {{mvar|k}} are not localized, but it is convenient for keeping track of the factors in front of the {{mvar|k}}-integrals and the momentum-conserving delta functions that will arise.

On a lattice, (ii), the action needs to be discretized:
:&lt;math&gt; S= \sum_{\langle x,y\rangle} \tfrac12 \big(\phi(x) - \phi(y) \big)^2\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|{{angbr|''x'',''y''}}}} is a pair of nearest lattice neighbors {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}. The discretization should be thought of as defining what the derivative {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;''φ''}} means.

In terms of the lattice Fourier modes, the action can be written:
:&lt;math&gt;S= \int_k \Big( \big(1-\cos(k_1)\big) +\big(1-\cos(k_2)\big) + \cdots + \big(1-\cos(k_d)\big) \Big)\phi^*_k \phi^k\,.&lt;/math&gt;
For {{mvar|k}} near zero this is:
:&lt;math&gt;S = \int_k \tfrac12 k^2 \left|\phi(k)\right|^2\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Now we have the continuum Fourier transform of the original action. In finite volume, the quantity {{mvar|d&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;k}} is not infinitesimal, but becomes the volume of a box made by neighboring Fourier modes, or {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{sfrac|2π|''V''}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''d''|b=&amp;nbsp;}}}}.

The field {{mvar|φ}} is real-valued, so the Fourier transform obeys:

:&lt;math&gt; \phi(k)^* = \phi(-k)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of real and imaginary parts, the real part of {{math|''φ''(''k'')}} is an [[even function]] of {{mvar|k}}, while the imaginary part is odd. The Fourier transform avoids double-counting, so that it can be written:

:&lt;math&gt; S = \int_k \tfrac12 k^2 \phi(k) \phi(-k)&lt;/math&gt;

over an integration domain that integrates over each pair {{math|(''k'',−''k'')}} exactly once.

For a complex scalar field with action

:&lt;math&gt; S = \int \tfrac12 \partial_\mu\phi^* \partial^\mu\phi \,d^dx&lt;/math&gt;

the Fourier transform is unconstrained:

:&lt;math&gt; S = \int_k \tfrac12 k^2 \left|\phi(k)\right|^2&lt;/math&gt;

and the integral is over all {{mvar|k}}.

Integrating over all different values of {{math|''φ''(''x'')}} is equivalent to integrating over all Fourier modes, because taking a Fourier transform is a unitary linear transformation of field coordinates. When you change coordinates in a multidimensional integral by a linear transformation, the value of the new integral is given by the determinant of the transformation matrix. If
:&lt;math&gt; y_i = A_{ij} x_j\,,&lt;/math&gt;

then
:&lt;math&gt;\det(A) \int dx_1\, dx_2 \cdots\, dx_n = \int dy_1\, dy_2 \cdots\, dy_n\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{mvar|A}} is a rotation, then
:&lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{T} A = I&lt;/math&gt;
so that {{math|det ''A'' {{=}} ±1}}, and the sign depends on whether the rotation includes a reflection or not.

The matrix that changes coordinates from {{math|''φ''(''x'')}} to {{math|''φ''(''k'')}} can be read off from the definition of a Fourier transform.

:&lt;math&gt; A_{kx} = e^{ikx} \,&lt;/math&gt;

and the Fourier inversion theorem tells you the inverse:

:&lt;math&gt; A^{-1}_{kx} = e^{-ikx} \,&lt;/math&gt;

which is the complex conjugate-transpose, up to factors of 2{{pi}}. On a finite volume lattice, the determinant is nonzero and independent of the field values.
:&lt;math&gt; \det A = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

and the path integral is a separate factor at each value of {{mvar|k}}.

:&lt;math&gt; \int \exp \left(\frac{i}{2} \sum_k k^2 \phi^*(k) \phi(k) \right)\, D\phi = \prod_k \int_{\phi_k} e^{\frac{i}{2} k^2 \left|\phi_k \right|^2\, d^dk} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The factor {{mvar|d&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;k}} is the infinitesimal volume of a discrete cell in {{mvar|k}}-space, in a square lattice box
:&lt;math&gt;d^dk = \left(\frac{1}{L}\right)^d\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|L}} is the side-length of the box. Each separate factor is an oscillatory Gaussian, and the width of the Gaussian diverges as the volume goes to infinity.

In imaginary time, the ''Euclidean action'' becomes positive definite, and can be interpreted as a probability distribution. The probability of a field having values {{mvar|φ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} is
:&lt;math&gt; e^{\int_k - \tfrac12 k^2 \phi^*_k \phi_k} = \prod_k e^{- k^2 \left|\phi_k\right|^2\, d^dk}\,. &lt;/math&gt;

The expectation value of the field is the statistical expectation value of the field when chosen according to the probability distribution:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \phi(x_1) \cdots \phi(x_n) \right\rangle = \frac{ \displaystyle\int e^{-S} \phi(x_1) \cdots \phi(x_n)\, D\phi} {\displaystyle\int e^{-S}\, D\phi}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the probability of {{mvar|φ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a product, the value of {{mvar|φ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} at each separate value of {{mvar|k}} is independently Gaussian distributed. The variance of the Gaussian is {{math|{{sfrac|1|''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''d&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;k''}}}}, which is formally infinite, but that just means that the fluctuations are unbounded in infinite volume. In any finite volume, the integral is replaced by a discrete sum, and the variance of the integral is {{math|{{sfrac|''V''|''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}.

=== Monte Carlo ===
The path integral defines a probabilistic algorithm to generate a Euclidean scalar field configuration. Randomly pick the real and imaginary parts of each Fourier mode at wavenumber {{mvar|k}} to be a Gaussian random variable with variance {{math|{{sfrac|1|''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}. This generates a configuration {{math|''φ&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''(''k'')}} at random, and the Fourier transform gives {{math|''φ&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')}}. For real scalar fields, the algorithm must generate only one of each pair {{math|''φ''(''k''), ''φ''(−''k'')}}, and make the second the complex conjugate of the first.

To find any correlation function, generate a field again and again by this procedure, and find the statistical average:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle \phi(x_1) \cdots \phi(x_n) \right\rangle = \lim_{|C|\rightarrow\infty}\frac{ \displaystyle\sum_C \phi_C(x_1) \cdots \phi_C(x_n) }{|C| } &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|{{abs|''C''}}}} is the number of configurations, and the sum is of the product of the field values on each configuration. The Euclidean correlation function is just the same as the correlation function in statistics or statistical mechanics. The quantum mechanical correlation functions are an analytic continuation of the Euclidean correlation functions.

For free fields with a quadratic action, the probability distribution is a high-dimensional Gaussian, and the statistical average is given by an explicit formula. But the [[Monte Carlo method]] also works well for bosonic interacting field theories where there is no closed form for the correlation functions.

=== Scalar propagator ===
Each mode is independently Gaussian distributed. The expectation of field modes is easy to calculate:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle \phi_k \phi_{k'}\right\rangle = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

for {{math|''k'' ≠ ''k''′}}, since then the two Gaussian random variables are independent and both have zero mean.

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle\phi_k \phi_k \right\rangle = \frac{V}{k^2} &lt;/math&gt;

in finite volume {{mvar|V}}, when the two {{mvar|k}}-values coincide, since this is the variance of the Gaussian. In the infinite volume limit,

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle\phi(k) \phi(k')\right\rangle = \delta(k-k') \frac{1}{k^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Strictly speaking, this is an approximation: the lattice propagator is:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\phi(k) \phi(k')\right\rangle = \delta(k-k') \frac{1}{2\big(d - \cos(k_1) + \cos(k_2) \cdots + \cos(k_d)\big) }&lt;/math&gt;

But near {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}}, for field fluctuations long compared to the lattice spacing, the two forms coincide.

It is important to emphasize that the delta functions contain factors of 2{{pi}}, so that they cancel out the 2{{pi}} factors in the measure for {{mvar|k}} integrals.

:&lt;math&gt;\delta(k) = (2\pi)^d \delta_D(k_1)\delta_D(k_2) \cdots \delta_D(k_d) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''δ&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''(''k'')}} is the ordinary one-dimensional Dirac delta function. This convention for delta-functions is not universal—some authors keep the factors of 2{{pi}} in the delta functions (and in the {{mvar|k}}-integration) explicit.

=== Equation of motion ===
The form of the propagator can be more easily found by using the equation of motion for the field. From the Lagrangian, the equation of motion is:

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_\mu \partial^\mu \phi = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

and in an expectation value, this says:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu\partial^\mu \left\langle \phi(x) \phi(y)\right\rangle =0&lt;/math&gt;

Where the derivatives act on {{mvar|x}}, and the identity is true everywhere except when {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} coincide, and the operator order matters. The form of the singularity can be understood from the canonical commutation relations to be a delta-function. Defining the (Euclidean) ''Feynman propagator'' {{math|Δ}} as the Fourier transform of the time-ordered two-point function (the one that comes from the path-integral):

:&lt;math&gt; \partial^2 \Delta (x) = i\delta(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

So that:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(k) = \frac{i}{k^2}&lt;/math&gt;

If the equations of motion are linear, the propagator will always be the reciprocal of the quadratic-form matrix that defines the free Lagrangian, since this gives the equations of motion. This is also easy to see directly from the path integral. The factor of {{mvar|i}} disappears in the Euclidean theory.

==== Wick theorem ====
{{Main article|Wick's theorem}}
Because each field mode is an independent Gaussian, the expectation values for the product of many field modes obeys ''Wick's theorem'':

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle \phi(k_1) \phi(k_2) \cdots \phi(k_n)\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

is zero unless the field modes coincide in pairs. This means that it is zero for an odd number of {{mvar|φ}}, and for an even number of {{mvar|φ}}, it is equal to a contribution from each pair separately, with a delta function.

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \phi(k_1) \cdots \phi(k_{2n})\right\rangle = \sum \prod_{i,j} \frac{\delta\left(k_i - k_j\right) }{k_i^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where the sum is over each partition of the field modes into pairs, and the product is over the pairs. For example,

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle \phi(k_1) \phi(k_2) \phi(k_3) \phi(k_4) \right\rangle = \frac{\delta(k_1 -k_2)}{k_1^2}\frac{\delta(k_3-k_4)}{k_3^2} + \frac{\delta(k_1-k_3)}{k_3^2}\frac{\delta(k_2-k_4)}{k_2^2} + \frac{\delta(k_1-k_4)}{k_1^2}\frac{\delta(k_2 -k_3)}{k_2^2}&lt;/math&gt;

An interpretation of Wick's theorem is that each field insertion can be thought of as a dangling line, and the expectation value is calculated by linking up the lines in pairs, putting a delta function factor that ensures that the momentum of each partner in the pair is equal, and dividing by the propagator.

==== Higher Gaussian moments — completing Wick's theorem ====
There is a subtle point left before Wick's theorem is proved—what if more than two of the phis have the same momentum? If it's an odd number, the integral is zero; negative values cancel with the positive values. But if the number is even, the integral is positive. The previous demonstration assumed that the phis would only match up in pairs.

But the theorem is correct even when arbitrarily many of the {{mvar|φ}} are equal, and this is a notable property of Gaussian integration:
:&lt;math&gt; I = \int e^{-ax^2/2}dx = \sqrt\frac{2\pi}{a} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^n}{\partial a^n } I = \int \frac{x^{2n}}{2^n} e^{-ax^2/2}dx = \frac{1\cdot 3 \cdot 5 \ldots \cdot (2n-1) }{ 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \ldots \;\;\;\;\;\cdot 2\;\;\;\;\;\;} \sqrt{2\pi}\, a^{-\frac{2n+1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing by {{mvar|I}},

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle x^{2n}\right\rangle=\frac{\displaystyle\int x^{2n} e^{-a x^2/2} }{\displaystyle \int e^{-a x^2/2} } = 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \ldots \cdot (2n-1) \frac{1}{a^n} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle x^2 \right\rangle = \frac{1}{a} &lt;/math&gt;

If Wick's theorem were correct, the higher moments would be given by all possible pairings of a list of {{math|2''n''}} different {{mvar|x}}:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle x_1 x_2 x_3 \cdots x_{2n} \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{mvar|x}} are all the same variable, the index is just to keep track of the number of ways to pair them. The first {{mvar|x}} can be paired with {{math|2''n'' − 1}} others, leaving {{math|2''n'' − 2}}. The next unpaired {{mvar|x}} can be paired with {{math|2''n'' − 3}} different {{mvar|x}} leaving {{math|2''n'' − 4}}, and so on. This means that Wick's theorem, uncorrected, says that the expectation value of {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} should be:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle x^{2n} \right\rangle = (2n-1)\cdot(2n-3)\ldots \cdot5 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 \left\langle x^2\right\rangle^n &lt;/math&gt;

and this is in fact the correct answer. So Wick's theorem holds no matter how many of the momenta of the internal variables coincide.

==== Interaction ====
Interactions are represented by higher order contributions, since quadratic contributions are always Gaussian. The simplest interaction is the quartic self-interaction, with an action:

:&lt;math&gt; S = \int \partial^\mu \phi \partial_\mu\phi +\frac {\lambda}{ 4!} \phi^4. &lt;/math&gt;

The reason for the combinatorial factor 4! will be clear soon. Writing the action in terms of the lattice (or continuum) Fourier modes:

:&lt;math&gt; S = \int_k k^2 \left|\phi(k)\right|^2 + \int_{k_1k_2k_3k_4} \phi(k_1) \phi(k_2) \phi(k_3)\phi(k_4) \delta(k_1+k_2+k_3 + k_4) = S_F + X. &lt;/math&gt;

Where {{mvar|S&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the free action, whose correlation functions are given by Wick's theorem. The exponential of {{mvar|S}} in the path integral can be expanded in powers of {{mvar|λ}}, giving a series of corrections to the free action.

:&lt;math&gt; e^{-S} = e^{-S_F} \left( 1 + X + \frac{1}{2!} X X + \frac{1}{3!} X X X + \cdots \right) &lt;/math&gt;

The path integral for the interacting action is then a power series of corrections to the free action. The term represented by {{mvar|X}} should be thought of as four half-lines, one for each factor of {{math|''φ''(''k'')}}. The half-lines meet at a vertex, which contributes a delta-function that ensures that the sum of the momenta are all equal.

To compute a correlation function in the interacting theory, there is a contribution from the {{mvar|X}} terms now. For example, the path-integral for the four-field correlator:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \phi(k_1) \phi(k_2) \phi(k_3) \phi(k_4) \right\rangle = \frac{\displaystyle\int e^{-S} \phi(k_1)\phi(k_2)\phi(k_3)\phi(k_4) D\phi }{ Z}&lt;/math&gt;

which in the free field was only nonzero when the momenta {{mvar|k}} were equal in pairs, is now nonzero for all values of {{mvar|k}}. The momenta of the insertions {{math|''φ''(''k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} can now match up with the momenta of the {{mvar|X}}s in the expansion. The insertions should also be thought of as half-lines, four in this case, which carry a momentum {{mvar|k}}, but one that is not integrated.

The lowest-order contribution comes from the first nontrivial term {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''S&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sup&gt;''X''}} in the Taylor expansion of the action. Wick's theorem requires that the momenta in the {{mvar|X}} half-lines, the {{math|''φ''(''k'')}} factors in {{math|X}}, should match up with the momenta of the external half-lines in pairs. The new contribution is equal to:

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda \frac{1}{ k_1^2} \frac{1}{ k_2^2} \frac{1}{ k_3^2} \frac{1}{ k_4^2}\,. &lt;/math&gt;

The 4! inside {{math|X}} is canceled because there are exactly 4! ways to match the half-lines in {{mvar|X}} to the external half-lines. Each of these different ways of matching the half-lines together in pairs contributes exactly once, regardless of the values of {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;1,2,3,4&lt;/sub&gt;}}, by Wick's theorem.

==== Feynman diagrams ====
The expansion of the action in powers of {{mvar|X}} gives a series of terms with progressively higher number of {{mvar|X}}s. The contribution from the term with exactly {{mvar|n}} {{mvar|X}}s is called {{mvar|n}}th order.

The {{mvar|n}}th order terms has:
# {{math|4''n''}} internal half-lines, which are the factors of {{math|''φ''(''k'')}} from the {{mvar|X}}s. These all end on a vertex, and are integrated over all possible {{mvar|k}}.
# external half-lines, which are the come from the {{math|''φ''(''k'')}} insertions in the integral.

By Wick's theorem, each pair of half-lines must be paired together to make a ''line'', and this line gives a factor of

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta(k_1 + k_2)}{k_1^2} &lt;/math&gt;

which multiplies the contribution. This means that the two half-lines that make a line are forced to have equal and opposite momentum. The line itself should be labelled by an arrow, drawn parallel to the line, and labeled by the momentum in the line {{mvar|k}}. The half-line at the tail end of the arrow carries momentum {{mvar|k}}, while the half-line at the head-end carries momentum {{mvar|−''k''}}. If one of the two half-lines is external, this kills the integral over the internal {{mvar|k}}, since it forces the internal {{mvar|k}} to be equal to the external {{mvar|k}}. If both are internal, the integral over {{mvar|k}} remains.

The diagrams that are formed by linking the half-lines in the {{mvar|X}}s with the external half-lines, representing insertions, are the Feynman diagrams of this theory. Each line carries a factor of {{math|{{sfrac|1|''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}, the propagator, and either goes from vertex to vertex, or ends at an insertion. If it is internal, it is integrated over. At each vertex, the total incoming {{mvar|k}} is equal to the total outgoing {{mvar|k}}.

The number of ways of making a diagram by joining half-lines into lines almost completely cancels the factorial factors coming from the Taylor series of the exponential and the 4! at each vertex.

==== Loop order ====
A forest diagram is one where all the internal lines have momentum that is completely determined by the external lines and the condition that the incoming and outgoing momentum are equal at each vertex. The contribution of these diagrams is a product of propagators, without any integration. A tree diagram is a connected forest diagram.

An example of a tree diagram is the one where each of four external lines end on an {{mvar|X}}. Another is when three external lines end on an {{mvar|X}}, and the remaining half-line joins up with another {{mvar|X}}, and the remaining half-lines of this {{mvar|X}} run off to external lines. These are all also forest diagrams (as every tree is a forest); an example of a forest that is not a tree is when eight external lines end on two {{mvar|X}}s.

It is easy to verify that in all these cases, the momenta on all the internal lines is determined by the external momenta and the condition of momentum conservation in each vertex.

A diagram that is not a forest diagram is called a ''loop'' diagram, and an example is one where two lines of an {{mvar|X}} are joined to external lines, while the remaining two lines are joined to each other. The two lines joined to each other can have any momentum at all, since they both enter and leave the same vertex. A more complicated example is one where two {{mvar|X}}s are joined to each other by matching the legs one to the other. This diagram has no external lines at all.

The reason loop diagrams are called loop diagrams is because the number of {{mvar|k}}-integrals that are left undetermined by momentum conservation is equal to the number of independent closed loops in the diagram, where independent loops are counted as in [[homology theory]]. The homology is real-valued (actually {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;}} valued), the value associated with each line is the momentum. The boundary operator takes each line to the sum of the end-vertices with a positive sign at the head and a negative sign at the tail. The condition that the momentum is conserved is exactly the condition that the boundary of the {{mvar|k}}-valued weighted graph is zero.

A set of valid {{mvar|k}}-values can be arbitrarily redefined whenever there is a closed loop. A closed loop is a cyclical path of adjacent vertices that never revisits the same vertex. Such a cycle can be thought of as the boundary of a hypothetical 2-cell. The {{mvar|k}}-labellings of a graph that conserve momentum (i.e. which has zero boundary) up to redefinitions of {{mvar|k}} (i.e. up to boundaries of 2-cells) define the first homology of a graph. The number of independent momenta that are not determined is then equal to the number of independent homology loops. For many graphs, this is equal to the number of loops as counted in the most intuitive way.

==== Symmetry factors ====
The number of ways to form a given Feynman diagram by joining together half-lines is large, and by Wick's theorem, each way of pairing up the half-lines contributes equally. Often, this completely cancels the factorials in the denominator of each term, but the cancellation is sometimes incomplete.

The uncancelled denominator is called the ''symmetry factor'' of the diagram. The contribution of each diagram to the correlation function must be divided by its symmetry factor.

For example, consider the Feynman diagram formed from two external lines joined to one {{mvar|X}}, and the remaining two half-lines in the {{mvar|X}} joined to each other. There are 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3 ways to join the external half-lines to the {{mvar|X}}, and then there is only one way to join the two remaining lines to each other. The {{mvar|X}} comes divided by {{nowrap|4! {{=}} 4 × 3 × 2}}, but the number of ways to link up the {{mvar|X}} half lines to make the diagram is only 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3, so the contribution of this diagram is divided by two.

For another example, consider the diagram formed by joining all the half-lines of one {{mvar|X}} to all the half-lines of another {{mvar|X}}. This diagram is called a ''vacuum bubble'', because it does not link up to any external lines. There are 4! ways to form this diagram, but the denominator includes a 2! (from the expansion of the exponential, there are two {{mvar|X}}s) and two factors of 4!. The contribution is multiplied by {{sfrac|4!|2 × 4! × 4!}} =&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|48}}.

Another example is the Feynman diagram formed from two {{mvar|X}}s where each {{mvar|X}} links up to two external lines, and the remaining two half-lines of each {{mvar|X}} are joined to each other. The number of ways to link an {{mvar|X}} to two external lines is 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3, and either {{mvar|X}} could link up to either pair, giving an additional factor of 2. The remaining two half-lines in the two {{mvar|X}}s can be linked to each other in two ways, so that the total number of ways to form the diagram is {{nowrap|4 × 3 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 2}}, while the denominator is {{nowrap|4! × 4! × 2!}}. The total symmetry factor is 2, and the contribution of this diagram is divided by 2.

The symmetry factor theorem gives the symmetry factor for a general diagram: the contribution of each Feynman diagram must be divided by the order of its group of automorphisms, the number of symmetries that it has.

An [[automorphism]] of a Feynman graph is a permutation {{mvar|M}} of the lines and a permutation {{mvar|N}} of the vertices with the following properties:

# If a line {{mvar|l}} goes from vertex {{mvar|v}} to vertex {{mvar|v′}}, then {{math|''M''(''l'')}} goes from {{math|''N''(''v'')}} to {{math|''N''(''v′'')}}. If the line is undirected, as it is for a real scalar field, then {{math|''M''(''l'')}} can go from {{math|''N''(''v′'')}} to {{math|''N''(''v'')}} too.
# If a line {{mvar|l}} ends on an external line, {{math|''M''(''l'')}} ends on the same external line.
# If there are different types of lines, {{math|''M''(''l'')}} should preserve the type.

This theorem has an interpretation in terms of particle-paths: when identical particles are present, the integral over all intermediate particles must not double-count states that differ only by interchanging identical particles.

Proof: To prove this theorem, label all the internal and external lines of a diagram with a unique name. Then form the diagram by linking a half-line to a name and then to the other half line.

Now count the number of ways to form the named diagram. Each permutation of the {{mvar|X}}s gives a different pattern of linking names to half-lines, and this is a factor of {{math|''n''!}}. Each permutation of the half-lines in a single {{mvar|X}} gives a factor of 4!. So a named diagram can be formed in exactly as many ways as the denominator of the Feynman expansion.

But the number of unnamed diagrams is smaller than the number of named diagram by the order of the automorphism group of the graph.

==== Connected diagrams: ''linked-cluster theorem'' ====
Roughly speaking, a Feynman diagram is called ''connected'' if all vertices and propagator lines are linked by a sequence of vertices and propagators of the diagram itself. If one views it as an [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|undirected graph]] it is connected. The remarkable relevance of such diagrams in QFTs is due to the fact that they are sufficient to determine the [[Partition function (quantum field theory)|quantum partition function]] {{math|''Z''[''J'']}}. More precisely, connected Feynman diagrams determine

:&lt;math&gt;i W[J]\equiv \ln Z[J].&lt;/math&gt;

To see this, one should recall that

:&lt;math&gt; Z[J]\propto\sum_k{D_k}&lt;/math&gt;

with {{mvar|D&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} constructed from some (arbitrary) Feynman diagram that can be thought to consist of several connected components {{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If one encounters {{mvar|n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} (identical) copies of a component {{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} within the Feynman diagram {{mvar|D&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} one has to include a ''symmetry factor'' {{mvar|''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''!}}. However, in the end each contribution of a Feynman diagram {{mvar|D&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} to the partition function has the generic form

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_i \frac{C_{i}^{n_i} }{ n_i!} &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|i}} labels the (infinitely) many connected Feynman diagrams possible.

A scheme to successively create such contributions from the {{mvar|D&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''Z''[''J'']}} is obtained by

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{1}{0!}+\frac{C_1}{1!}+\frac{C^2_1}{2!}+\cdots\right)\left(1+C_2+\frac{1}{2}C^2_2+\cdots\right)\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

and therefore yields

:&lt;math&gt;Z[J]\propto\prod_i{\sum^\infty_{n_i=0}{\frac{C_i^{n_i}}{n_i!}}}=\exp{\sum_i{C_i}}\propto \exp{W[J]}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

To establish the ''normalization'' {{math|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} exp ''W''[0] {{=}} 1}} one simply calculates all connected ''vacuum diagrams'', i.e., the diagrams without any ''sources'' {{mvar|J}} (sometimes referred to as ''external legs'' of a Feynman diagram).

==== Vacuum bubbles ====
An immediate consequence of the linked-cluster theorem is that all vacuum bubbles, diagrams without external lines, cancel when calculating correlation functions. A correlation function is given by a ratio of path-integrals:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle \phi_1(x_1) \cdots \phi_n(x_n)\right\rangle = \frac{\displaystyle\int e^{-S} \phi_1(x_1) \cdots\phi_n(x_n)\, D\phi }{\displaystyle \int e^{-S}\, D\phi}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The top is the sum over all Feynman diagrams, including disconnected diagrams that do not link up to external lines at all. In terms of the connected diagrams, the numerator includes the same contributions of vacuum bubbles as the denominator:

:&lt;math&gt; \int e^{-S}\phi_1(x_1)\cdots\phi_n(x_n)\, D\phi = \left(\sum E_i\right)\left( \exp\left(\sum_i C_i\right) \right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Where the sum over {{mvar|E}} diagrams includes only those diagrams each of whose connected components end on at least one external line. The vacuum bubbles are the same whatever the external lines, and give an overall multiplicative factor. The denominator is the sum over all vacuum bubbles, and dividing gets rid of the second factor.

The vacuum bubbles then are only useful for determining {{mvar|Z}} itself, which from the definition of the path integral is equal to:

:&lt;math&gt; Z= \int e^{-S} D\phi = e^{-HT} = e^{-\rho V} &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|ρ}} is the energy density in the vacuum. Each vacuum bubble contains a factor of {{math|''δ''(''k'')}} zeroing the total {{mvar|k}} at each vertex, and when there are no external lines, this contains a factor of {{math|''δ''(0)}}, because the momentum conservation is over-enforced. In finite volume, this factor can be identified as the total volume of space time. Dividing by the volume, the remaining integral for the vacuum bubble has an interpretation: it is a contribution to the energy density of the vacuum.

==== Sources ====
Correlation functions are the sum of the connected Feynman diagrams, but the formalism treats the connected and disconnected diagrams differently. Internal lines end on vertices, while external lines go off to insertions. Introducing ''sources'' unifies the formalism, by making new vertices where one line can end.

Sources are external fields, fields that contribute to the action, but are not dynamical variables. A scalar field source is another scalar field {{mvar|h}} that contributes a term to the (Lorentz) Lagrangian:

:&lt;math&gt; \int h(x) \phi(x)\, d^dx = \int h(k) \phi(k)\, d^dk \,&lt;/math&gt;

In the Feynman expansion, this contributes H terms with one half-line ending on a vertex. Lines in a Feynman diagram can now end either on an {{mvar|X}} vertex, or on an {{mvar|H}} vertex, and only one line enters an {{mvar|H}} vertex. The Feynman rule for an {{mvar|H}} vertex is that a line from an {{mvar|H}} with momentum {{mvar|k}} gets a factor of {{math|''h''(''k'')}}.

The sum of the connected diagrams in the presence of sources includes a term for each connected diagram in the absence of sources, except now the diagrams can end on the source. Traditionally, a source is represented by a little "×" with one line extending out, exactly as an insertion.

:&lt;math&gt; \log\big(Z[h]\big) = \sum_{n,C} h(k_1) h(k_2) \cdots h(k_n) C(k_1,\cdots,k_n)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''C''(''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is the connected diagram with {{mvar|n}} external lines carrying momentum as indicated. The sum is over all connected diagrams, as before.

The field {{mvar|h}} is not dynamical, which means that there is no path integral over {{mvar|h}}: {{mvar|h}} is just a parameter in the Lagrangian, which varies from point to point. The path integral for the field is:

:&lt;math&gt; Z[h] = \int e^{iS + i\int h\phi}\, D\phi \,&lt;/math&gt;

and it is a function of the values of {{mvar|h}} at every point. One way to interpret this expression is that it is taking the Fourier transform in field space. If there is a probability density on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the Fourier transform of the probability density is:

:&lt;math&gt; \int \rho(y) e^{i k y}\, d^n y = \left\langle e^{i k y} \right\rangle = \left\langle \prod_{i=1}^{n} e^{ih_i y_i}\right\rangle \,&lt;/math&gt;

The Fourier transform is the expectation of an oscillatory exponential. The path integral in the presence of a source {{mvar|''h''(''x'')}} is:

:&lt;math&gt; Z[h] = \int e^{iS} e^{i\int_x h(x)\phi(x)}\, D\phi = \left\langle e^{i h \phi }\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

which, on a lattice, is the product of an oscillatory exponential for each field value:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle \prod_x e^{i h_x \phi_x}\right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

The fourier transform of a delta-function is a constant, which gives a formal expression for a delta function:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta(x-y) = \int e^{ik(x-y)}\, dk &lt;/math&gt;

This tells you what a field delta function looks like in a path-integral. For two scalar fields {{mvar|φ}} and {{mvar|η}},

:&lt;math&gt; \delta(\phi - \eta) = \int e^{ i h(x)\big(\phi(x) -\eta(x)\big)\,d^dx}\, Dh\,, &lt;/math&gt;

which integrates over the Fourier transform coordinate, over {{mvar|h}}. This expression is useful for formally changing field coordinates in the path integral, much as a delta function is used to change coordinates in an ordinary multi-dimensional integral.

The partition function is now a function of the field {{mvar|h}}, and the physical partition function is the value when {{mvar|h}} is the zero function:

The correlation functions are derivatives of the path integral with respect to the source:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle\phi(x)\right\rangle = \frac{1}{Z} \frac{\partial}{\partial h(x)} Z[h] = \frac{\partial}{\partial h(x)} \log\big(Z[h]\big)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In Euclidean space, source contributions to the action can still appear with a factor of {{mvar|i}}, so that they still do a Fourier transform.

=== Spin {{sfrac|1|2}}; "photons" and "ghosts" ===

==== Spin {{sfrac|1|2}}: Grassmann integrals ====
The field path integral can be extended to the Fermi case, but only if the notion of integration is expanded. A [[Berezin integral|Grassmann integral]] of a free Fermi field is a high-dimensional [[determinant]] or [[Pfaffian]], which defines the new type of Gaussian integration appropriate for Fermi fields.

The two fundamental formulas of Grassmann integration are:

:&lt;math&gt; \int e^{M_{ij}{\bar\psi}^i \psi^j}\, D\bar\psi\, D\psi= \mathrm{Det}(M)\,, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|M}} is an arbitrary matrix and {{math|''ψ'', {{overline|''ψ''}}}} are independent Grassmann variables for each index {{mvar|i}}, and

:&lt;math&gt; \int e^{\frac12 A_{ij} \psi^i \psi^j}\, D\psi = \mathrm{Pfaff}(A)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|A}} is an antisymmetric matrix, {{mvar|ψ}} is a collection of Grassmann variables, and the {{sfrac|1|2}} is to prevent double-counting (since {{math|''ψ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;ψ&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} −''ψ&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;ψ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}}).

In matrix notation, where {{mvar|{{overline|ψ}}}} and {{mvar|{{overline|η}}}} are Grassmann-valued row vectors, {{mvar|η}} and {{mvar|ψ}} are Grassmann-valued column vectors, and {{mvar|M}} is a real-valued matrix:

:&lt;math&gt; Z = \int e^{\bar\psi M \psi + \bar\eta \psi + \bar\psi \eta}\, D\bar\psi\, D\psi = \int e^{\left(\bar\psi+\bar\eta M^{-1}\right)M \left(\psi+ M^{-1}\eta\right) - \bar\eta M^{-1}\eta}\, D\bar\psi\, D\psi = \mathrm{Det}(M) e^{-\bar\eta M^{-1}\eta}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the last equality is a consequence of the translation invariance of the Grassmann integral. The Grassmann variables {{mvar|η}} are external sources for {{mvar|ψ}}, and differentiating with respect to {{mvar|η}} pulls down factors of {{mvar|{{overline|ψ}}}}.

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle\bar\psi \psi\right\rangle = \frac{1}{Z} \frac{\partial}{\partial \eta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar\eta} Z |_{\eta=\bar\eta=0} = M^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

again, in a schematic matrix notation. The meaning of the formula above is that the derivative with respect to the appropriate component of {{mvar|η}} and {{mvar|{{overline|η}}}} gives the matrix element of {{math|''M''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This is exactly analogous to the bosonic path integration formula for a Gaussian integral of a complex bosonic field:

:&lt;math&gt; \int e^{\phi^* M \phi + h^* \phi + \phi^* h } \,D\phi^*\, D\phi = \frac{e^{h^* M^{-1} h} }{ \mathrm{Det}(M)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle\phi^* \phi\right\rangle = \frac{1}{Z} \frac{\partial}{\partial h} \frac{\partial}{\partial h^*}Z |_{h=h^*=0} = M^{-1} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

So that the propagator is the inverse of the matrix in the quadratic part of the action in both the Bose and Fermi case.

For real Grassmann fields, for [[Majorana fermion]]s, the path integral a Pfaffian times a source quadratic form, and the formulas give the square root of the determinant, just as they do for real Bosonic fields. The propagator is still the inverse of the quadratic part.

The free Dirac Lagrangian:

:&lt;math&gt; \int \bar\psi\left(\gamma^\mu \partial_{\mu} - m \right) \psi &lt;/math&gt;

formally gives the equations of motion and the anticommutation relations of the Dirac field, just as the Klein Gordon Lagrangian in an ordinary path integral gives the equations of motion and commutation relations of the scalar field. By using the spatial Fourier transform of the Dirac field as a new basis for the Grassmann algebra, the quadratic part of the Dirac action becomes simple to invert:

:&lt;math&gt; S= \int_k \bar\psi\left( i\gamma^\mu k_\mu - m \right) \psi\,. &lt;/math&gt;

The propagator is the inverse of the matrix {{mvar|M}} linking {{math|''ψ''(''k'')}} and {{math|''{{overline|ψ}}''(''k'')}}, since different values of {{mvar|k}} do not mix together.

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle\bar\psi(k') \psi (k) \right\rangle = \delta (k+k')\frac{1} {\gamma\cdot k - m}  = \delta(k+k')\frac{\gamma\cdot k+m }{ k^2 - m^2} &lt;/math&gt;

The analog of Wick's theorem matches {{mvar|ψ}} and {{mvar|{{overline|ψ}}}} in pairs:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle\bar\psi(k_1) \bar\psi(k_2) \cdots \bar\psi(k_n) \psi(k'_1) \cdots \psi(k_n)\right\rangle = \sum_{\mathrm{pairings}} (-1)^S \prod_{\mathrm{pairs}\; i,j} \delta\left(k_i -k_j\right) \frac{1}{\gamma\cdot k_i - m}&lt;/math&gt;

where S is the sign of the permutation that reorders the sequence of {{mvar|{{overline|ψ}}}} and {{mvar|ψ}} to put the ones that are paired up to make the delta-functions next to each other, with the {{mvar|{{overline|ψ}}}} coming right before the {{mvar|ψ}}. Since a {{math|''ψ'', ''{{overline|ψ}}''}} pair is a commuting element of the Grassmann algebra, it doesn't matter what order the pairs are in. If more than one {{math|''ψ'', ''{{overline|ψ}}''}} pair have the same {{mvar|k}}, the integral is zero, and it is easy to check that the sum over pairings gives zero in this case (there are always an even number of them). This is the Grassmann analog of the higher Gaussian moments that completed the Bosonic Wick's theorem earlier.

The rules for spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} Dirac particles are as follows: The propagator is the inverse of the Dirac operator, the lines have arrows just as for a complex scalar field, and the diagram acquires an overall factor of −1 for each closed Fermi loop. If there are an odd number of Fermi loops, the diagram changes sign. Historically, the −1 rule was very difficult for Feynman to discover. He discovered it after a long process of trial and error, since he lacked a proper theory of Grassmann integration.

The rule follows from the observation that the number of Fermi lines at a vertex is always even. Each term in the Lagrangian must always be Bosonic. A Fermi loop is counted by following Fermionic lines until one comes back to the starting point, then removing those lines from the diagram. Repeating this process eventually erases all the Fermionic lines: this is the Euler algorithm to 2-color a graph, which works whenever each vertex has even degree. Note that the number of steps in the Euler algorithm is only equal to the number of independent Fermionic homology cycles in the common special case that all terms in the Lagrangian are exactly quadratic in the Fermi fields, so that each vertex has exactly two Fermionic lines. When there are four-Fermi interactions (like in the Fermi effective theory of the [[weak nuclear interaction]]s) there are more {{mvar|k}}-integrals than Fermi loops. In this case, the counting rule should apply the Euler algorithm by pairing up the Fermi lines at each vertex into pairs that together form a bosonic factor of the term in the Lagrangian, and when entering a vertex by one line, the algorithm should always leave with the partner line.

To clarify and prove the rule, consider a Feynman diagram formed from vertices, terms in the Lagrangian, with Fermion fields. The full term is Bosonic, it is a commuting element of the Grassmann algebra, so the order in which the vertices appear is not important. The Fermi lines are linked into loops, and when traversing the loop, one can reorder the vertex terms one after the other as one goes around without any sign cost. The exception is when you return to the starting point, and the final half-line must be joined with the unlinked first half-line. This requires one permutation to move the last {{mvar|{{overline|ψ}}}} to go in front of the first {{mvar|ψ}}, and this gives the sign.

This rule is the only visible effect of the exclusion principle in internal lines. When there are external lines, the amplitudes are antisymmetric when two Fermi insertions for identical particles are interchanged. This is automatic in the source formalism, because the sources for Fermi fields are themselves Grassmann valued.

==== Spin 1: photons ====
The naive propagator for photons is infinite, since the Lagrangian for the A-field is:

:&lt;math&gt; S = \int \tfrac14 F^{\mu\nu} F_{\mu\nu} = \int -\tfrac12\left(\partial^\mu A_\nu \partial_\mu A^\nu - \partial^\mu A_\mu \partial_\nu A^\nu \right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The quadratic form defining the propagator is non-invertible. The reason is the [[gauge invariance]] of the field; adding a gradient to {{mvar|A}} does not change the physics.

To fix this problem, one needs to fix a gauge. The most convenient way is to demand that the divergence of {{mvar|A}} is some function {{mvar|f}}, whose value is random from point to point. It does no harm to integrate over the values of {{mvar|f}}, since it only determines the choice of gauge. This procedure inserts the following factor into the path integral for {{mvar|A}}:

:&lt;math&gt; \int \delta\left(\partial_\mu A^\mu - f\right) e^{-\frac{f^2}{2} }\, Df\,. &lt;/math&gt;

The first factor, the delta function, fixes the gauge. The second factor sums over different values of {{mvar|f}} that are inequivalent gauge fixings. This is simply

:&lt;math&gt; e^{- \frac{\left(\partial_\mu A_\mu\right)^2}{2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The additional contribution from gauge-fixing cancels the second half of the free Lagrangian, giving the Feynman Lagrangian:

:&lt;math&gt; S= \int \partial^\mu A^\nu \partial_\mu A_\nu &lt;/math&gt;

which is just like four independent free scalar fields, one for each component of {{mvar|A}}. The Feynman propagator is:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle A_\mu(k) A_\nu(k') \right\rangle = \delta\left(k+k'\right) \frac{g_{\mu\nu}}{ k^2 }.&lt;/math&gt;

The one difference is that the sign of one propagator is wrong in the Lorentz case: the timelike component has an opposite sign propagator. This means that these particle states have negative norm—they are not physical states. In the case of photons, it is easy to show by diagram methods that these states are not physical—their contribution cancels with longitudinal photons to only leave two physical photon polarization contributions for any value of {{mvar|k}}.

If the averaging over {{mvar|f}} is done with a coefficient different from {{sfrac|1|2}}, the two terms don't cancel completely. This gives a covariant Lagrangian with a coefficient &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, which does not affect anything:

:&lt;math&gt; S= \int \tfrac12\left(\partial^\mu A^\nu \partial_\mu A_\nu - \lambda \left(\partial_\mu A^\mu\right)^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and the covariant propagator for QED is:

:&lt;math&gt;\left \langle A_\mu(k) A_\nu(k') \right\rangle =\delta\left(k+k'\right)\frac{g_{\mu\nu} - \lambda\frac{k_\mu k_\nu }{ k^2} }{ k^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

==== Spin 1: non-Abelian ghosts ====
To find the Feynman rules for non-Abelian gauge fields, the procedure that performs the gauge fixing must be carefully corrected to account for a change of variables in the path-integral.

The gauge fixing factor has an extra determinant from popping the delta function:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta\left(\partial_\mu A_\mu - f\right) e^{-\frac{f^2}{2}} \det M &lt;/math&gt;

To find the form of the determinant, consider first a simple two-dimensional integral of a function {{mvar|f}} that depends only on {{mvar|r}}, not on the angle {{mvar|θ}}. Inserting an integral over {{mvar|θ}}:

:&lt;math&gt; \int f(r)\, dx\, dy = \int f(r) \int d\theta\, \delta(y) \left|\frac{dy}{d\theta}\right|\, dx\, dy &lt;/math&gt;

The derivative-factor ensures that popping the delta function in {{mvar|θ}} removes the integral. Exchanging the order of integration,

:&lt;math&gt; \int f(r)\, dx\, dy = \int d\theta\, \int f(r) \delta(y) \left|\frac{dy}{d\theta}\right|\, dx\, dy &lt;/math&gt;

but now the delta-function can be popped in {{mvar|y}},

:&lt;math&gt; \int f(r)\, dx\, dy = \int d\theta_0\, \int f(x) \left|\frac{dy}{d\theta}\right|\, dx\,. &lt;/math&gt;

The integral over {{mvar|θ}} just gives an overall factor of 2{{pi}}, while the rate of change of {{mvar|y}} with a change in {{mvar|θ}} is just {{mvar|x}}, so this exercise reproduces the standard formula for polar integration of a radial function:

:&lt;math&gt; \int f(r)\, dx\, dy = 2\pi \int f(x) x\, dx &lt;/math&gt;

In the path-integral for a nonabelian gauge field, the analogous manipulation is:

:&lt;math&gt; \int DA \int \delta\big(F(A)\big) \det\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial G}\right)\, DG e^{iS} = \int DG \int \delta\big(F(A)\big)\det\left(\frac{\partial F}{ \partial G}\right) e^{iS} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The factor in front is the volume of the gauge group, and it contributes a constant, which can be discarded. The remaining integral is over the gauge fixed action.

:&lt;math&gt; \int \det\left(\frac{\partial F}{ \partial G}\right)e^{iS_{GF}}\, DA \,&lt;/math&gt;

To get a covariant gauge, the gauge fixing condition is the same as in the Abelian case:

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_\mu A^\mu = f \,,&lt;/math&gt;

Whose variation under an infinitesimal gauge transformation is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_\mu\, D_\mu \alpha \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|α}} is the adjoint valued element of the Lie algebra at every point that performs the infinitesimal gauge transformation. This adds the Faddeev Popov determinant to the action:

:&lt;math&gt; \det\left(\partial_\mu\, D_\mu\right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

which can be rewritten as a Grassmann integral by introducing ghost fields:

:&lt;math&gt; \int e^{\bar\eta \partial_\mu\, D^\mu \eta}\, D\bar\eta\, D\eta \,&lt;/math&gt;

The determinant is independent of {{mvar|f}}, so the path-integral over {{mvar|f}} can give the Feynman propagator (or a covariant propagator) by choosing the measure for {{mvar|f}} as in the abelian case. The full gauge fixed action is then the Yang Mills action in Feynman gauge with an additional ghost action:

:&lt;math&gt; S= \int \operatorname{Tr} \partial_\mu A_\nu \partial^\mu A^\nu + f^i_{jk} \partial^\nu A_i^\mu A^j_\mu A^k_\nu + f^i_{jr} f^r_{kl} A_i A_j A^k A^l + \operatorname{Tr} \partial_\mu \bar\eta \partial^\mu \eta + \bar\eta A_j \eta \,&lt;/math&gt;

The diagrams are derived from this action. The propagator for the spin-1 fields has the usual Feynman form. There are vertices of degree 3 with momentum factors whose couplings are the structure constants, and vertices of degree 4 whose couplings are products of structure constants. There are additional ghost loops, which cancel out timelike and longitudinal states in {{mvar|A}} loops.

In the Abelian case, the determinant for covariant gauges does not depend on {{mvar|A}}, so the ghosts do not contribute to the connected diagrams.

== Particle-path representation ==
Feynman diagrams were originally discovered by Feynman, by trial and error, as a way to represent the contribution to the S-matrix from different classes of particle trajectories.

=== Schwinger representation&lt;!--'Schwinger representation' redirects here--&gt; ===
The Euclidean scalar propagator has a suggestive representation:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{p^2+m^2} = \int_0^\infty e^{-\tau\left(p^2 + m^2\right)}\, d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

The meaning of this identity (which is an elementary integration) is made clearer by Fourier transforming to real space.

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(x) = \int_0^\infty d\tau e^{-m^2\tau} \frac{1}{ ({4\pi\tau})^{d/2}}e^\frac{-x^2}{ 4\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

The contribution at any one value of {{mvar|τ}} to the propagator is a Gaussian of width {{math|{{sqrt|''τ''}}}}. The total propagation function from 0 to {{mvar|x}} is a weighted sum over all proper times {{mvar|τ}} of a normalized Gaussian, the probability of ending up at {{mvar|x}} after a random walk of time {{mvar|τ}}.

The path-integral representation for the propagator is then:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(x) = \int_0^\infty d\tau \int DX\, e^{- \int\limits_0^{\tau} \left(\frac{\dot{x}^2}{2} + m^2\right) d\tau'} &lt;/math&gt;

which is a path-integral rewrite of the '''Schwinger representation'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.

The Schwinger representation is both useful for making manifest the particle aspect of the propagator, and for symmetrizing denominators of loop diagrams.

=== Combining denominators ===
The Schwinger representation has an immediate practical application to loop diagrams. For example, for the diagram in the {{math|''φ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} theory formed by joining two {{mvar|x}}s together in two half-lines, and making the remaining lines external, the integral over the internal propagators in the loop is:

: &lt;math&gt; \int_k \frac{1}{k^2 + m^2} \frac{1}{ (k+p)^2 + m^2} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Here one line carries momentum {{mvar|k}} and the other {{math|''k'' + ''p''}}. The asymmetry can be fixed by putting everything in the Schwinger representation.

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{t,t'} e^{-t(k^2+m^2) - t'\left((k+p)^2 +m^2\right) }\, dt\, dt'\,. &lt;/math&gt;

Now the exponent mostly depends on {{math|''t'' + ''t''′}},

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{t,t'} e^{-(t+t')(k^2+m^2) - t' 2p\cdot k -t' p^2}\,, &lt;/math&gt;

except for the asymmetrical little bit. Defining the variable {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''t'' + ''t''′}} and {{math|''v'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''t''′|''u''}}}}, the variable {{mvar|u}} goes from 0 to {{math|∞}}, while {{mvar|v}} goes from 0 to 1. The variable {{mvar|u}} is the total proper time for the loop, while {{mvar|v}} parametrizes the fraction of the proper time on the top of the loop versus the bottom.

The Jacobian for this transformation of variables is easy to work out from the identities:

:&lt;math&gt; d(uv)= dt'\quad du = dt+dt'\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and "wedging" gives

:&lt;math&gt; u\, du \wedge dv = dt \wedge dt'\,&lt;/math&gt;.

This allows the {{mvar|u}} integral to be evaluated explicitly:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{u,v} u e^{-u \left( k^2+m^2 + v 2p\cdot k + v p^2\right)} = \int \frac{1}{\left(k^2 + m^2 + v 2p\cdot k - v p^2\right)^2}\, dv &lt;/math&gt;

leaving only the {{mvar|v}}-integral. This method, invented by Schwinger but usually attributed to Feynman, is called ''combining denominator''. Abstractly, it is the elementary identity:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{AB}= \int_0^1 \frac{1}{\big( vA+ (1-v)B\big)^2}\, dv &lt;/math&gt;

But this form does not provide the physical motivation for introducing {{mvar|v}}; {{mvar|v}} is the proportion of proper time on one of the legs of the loop.

Once the denominators are combined, a shift in {{mvar|k}} to {{math|''k''′ {{=}} ''k'' + ''vp''}} symmetrizes everything:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^1 \int\frac{1}{\left(k^2 + m^2 + 2vp \cdot k + v p^2\right)^2}\, dk\, dv = \int_0^1 \int \frac{1}{\left(k'^2 + m^2 + v(1-v)p^2\right)^2}\, dk'\, dv&lt;/math&gt;

This form shows that the moment that {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is more negative than four times the mass of the particle in the loop, which happens in a physical region of Lorentz space, the integral has a cut. This is exactly when the external momentum can create physical particles.

When the loop has more vertices, there are more denominators to combine:

:&lt;math&gt; \int dk\, \frac{1}{k^2 + m^2} \frac{1}{(k+p_1)^2 + m^2} \cdots \frac{1}{(k+p_n)^2 + m^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The general rule follows from the Schwinger prescription for {{mvar|''n'' + 1}} denominators:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{D_0 D_1 \cdots D_n} = \int_0^\infty \cdots\int_0^\infty e^{-u_0 D_0 \cdots -u_n D_n}\, du_0 \cdots du_n \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The integral over the Schwinger parameters {{mvar|u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be split up as before into an integral over the total proper time {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; … + ''u&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and an integral over the fraction of the proper time in all but the first segment of the loop {{math|''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''|''u''}}}} for {{math|''i'' ∈ {{mset|1,2,…,''n''}}}}. The {{mvar|v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} are positive and add up to less than 1, so that the {{mvar|v}} integral is over an {{mvar|n}}-dimensional simplex.

The Jacobian for the coordinate transformation can be worked out as before:

:&lt;math&gt; du = du_0 + du_1 \cdots + du_n \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; d(uv_i) = d u_i \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Wedging all these equations together, one obtains

:&lt;math&gt; u^n\, du \wedge dv_1 \wedge dv_2 \cdots \wedge dv_n = du_0 \wedge du_1 \cdots \wedge du_n \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the integral:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^\infty \int_{\mathrm{simplex}} u^n e^{-u\left(v_0 D_0 + v_1 D_1 + v_2 D_2 \cdots + v_n D_n\right)}\, dv_1\cdots dv_n\, du\,, &lt;/math&gt;

where the simplex is the region defined by the conditions
:&lt;math&gt;v_i&gt;0 \quad \mbox{and} \quad \sum_{i=1}^n v_i &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;
as well as
:&lt;math&gt;v_0 = 1-\sum_{i=1}^n v_i\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Performing the {{mvar|u}} integral gives the general prescription for combining denominators:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{ D_0 \cdots D_n } = n! \int_{\mathrm{simplex}} \frac{1}{ \left(v_0 D_0 +v_1 D_1 \cdots + v_n D_n\right)^{n+1}}\, dv_1\, dv_2 \cdots dv_n &lt;/math&gt;

Since the numerator of the integrand is not involved, the same prescription works for any loop, no matter what the spins are carried by the legs. The interpretation of the parameters {{mvar|v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is that they are the fraction of the total proper time spent on each leg.

=== Scattering ===
The correlation functions of a quantum field theory describe the scattering of particles. The definition of "particle" in relativistic field theory is not self-evident, because if you try to determine the position so that the uncertainty is less than the [[compton wavelength]], the uncertainty in energy is large enough to produce more particles and antiparticles of the same type from the vacuum. This means that the notion of a single-particle state is to some extent incompatible with the notion of an object localized in space.

In the 1930s, [[Eugene Wigner|Wigner]] gave a mathematical definition for single-particle states: they are a collection of states that form an irreducible representation of the Poincaré group. Single particle states describe an object with a finite mass, a well defined momentum, and a spin. This definition is fine for protons and neutrons, electrons and photons, but it excludes quarks, which are permanently confined, so the modern point of view is more accommodating: a particle is anything whose interaction can be described in terms of Feynman diagrams, which have an interpretation as a sum over particle trajectories.

A field operator can act to produce a one-particle state from the vacuum, which means that the field operator {{mvar|''φ''(''x'')}} produces a superposition of Wigner particle states. In the free field theory, the field produces one particle states only. But when there are interactions, the field operator can also produce 3-particle, 5-particle (if there is no +/− symmetry also 2, 4, 6 particle) states too. To compute the scattering amplitude for single particle states only requires a careful limit, sending the fields to infinity and integrating over space to get rid of the higher-order corrections.

The relation between scattering and correlation functions is the LSZ-theorem: The scattering amplitude for {{mvar|n}} particles to go to {{mvar|m}} particles in a scattering event is the given by the sum of the Feynman diagrams that go into the correlation function for {{math|''n'' + ''m''}} field insertions, leaving out the propagators for the external legs.

For example, for the {{math|''λφ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} interaction of the previous section, the order {{mvar|λ}} contribution to the (Lorentz) correlation function is:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle \phi(k_1)\phi(k_2)\phi(k_3)\phi(k_4)\right\rangle = \frac{i}{k_1^2}\frac{i}{k_2^2} \frac{i}{k_3^2} \frac{i}{k_4^2} i\lambda \,&lt;/math&gt;

Stripping off the external propagators, that is, removing the factors of {{math|{{sfrac|''i''|''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}, gives the invariant scattering amplitude {{mvar|M}}:

:&lt;math&gt; M = i\lambda \,&lt;/math&gt;

which is a constant, independent of the incoming and outgoing momentum. The interpretation of the scattering amplitude is that the sum of {{math|{{abs|''M''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} over all possible final states is the probability for the scattering event. The normalization of the single-particle states must be chosen carefully, however, to ensure that {{mvar|M}} is a relativistic invariant.

Non-relativistic single particle states are labeled by the momentum {{mvar|k}}, and they are chosen to have the same norm at every value of {{mvar|k}}. This is because the nonrelativistic unit operator on single particle states is:

:&lt;math&gt; \int dk\, |k\rangle\langle k|\,. &lt;/math&gt;

In relativity, the integral over the {{mvar|k}}-states for a particle of mass m integrates over a hyperbola in {{math|''E'',''k''}} space defined by the energy–momentum relation:

:&lt;math&gt; E^2 - k^2 = m^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

If the integral weighs each {{mvar|k}} point equally, the measure is not Lorentz-invariant. The invariant measure integrates over all values of {{mvar|k}} and {{mvar|E}}, restricting to the hyperbola with a Lorentz-invariant delta function:

:&lt;math&gt; \int \delta(E^2-k^2 - m^2) |E,k\rangle\langle E,k|\, dE\, dk = \int {dk \over 2 E} |k\rangle\langle k|\,.&lt;/math&gt;

So the normalized {{mvar|k}}-states are different from the relativistically normalized {{mvar|k}}-states by a factor of
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{E} = \left(k^2-m^2\right)^\frac14\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The invariant amplitude {{mvar|M}} is then the probability amplitude for relativistically normalized incoming states to become relativistically normalized outgoing states.

For nonrelativistic values of {{mvar|k}}, the relativistic normalization is the same as the nonrelativistic normalization (up to a constant factor {{math|{{sqrt|''m''}}}}). In this limit, the {{math|''φ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} invariant scattering amplitude is still constant. The particles created by the field {{mvar|φ}} scatter in all directions with equal amplitude.

The nonrelativistic potential, which scatters in all directions with an equal amplitude (in the [[Born approximation]]), is one whose Fourier transform is constant—a delta-function potential. The lowest order scattering of the theory reveals the non-relativistic interpretation of this theory—it describes a collection of particles with a delta-function repulsion. Two such particles have an aversion to occupying the same point at the same time.

== Nonperturbative effects ==
Thinking of Feynman diagrams as a perturbation series, nonperturbative effects like tunneling do not show up, because any effect that goes to zero faster than any polynomial does not affect the Taylor series. Even bound states are absent, since at any finite order particles are only exchanged a finite number of times, and to make a bound state, the binding force must last forever.

But this point of view is misleading, because the diagrams not only describe scattering, but they also are a representation of the short-distance field theory correlations. They encode not only asymptotic processes like particle scattering, they also describe the multiplication rules for fields, the [[operator product expansion]]. Nonperturbative tunneling processes involve field configurations that on average get big when the coupling constant gets small, but each configuration is a coherent superposition of particles whose local interactions are described by Feynman diagrams. When the coupling is small, these become collective processes that involve large numbers of particles, but where the interactions between each of the particles is simple.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

This means that nonperturbative effects show up asymptotically in resummations of infinite classes of diagrams, and these diagrams can be locally simple. The graphs determine the local equations of motion, while the allowed large-scale configurations describe non-perturbative physics. But because Feynman propagators are nonlocal in time, translating a field process to a coherent particle language is not completely intuitive, and has only been explicitly worked out in certain special cases. In the case of nonrelativistic bound states, the [[Bethe–Salpeter equation]] describes the class of diagrams to include to describe a relativistic atom. For quantum chromodynamics, the Shifman Vainshtein Zakharov sum rules describe non-perturbatively excited long-wavelength field modes in particle language, but only in a phenomenological way.

The number of Feynman diagrams at high orders of perturbation theory is very large, because there are as many diagrams as there are graphs with a given number of nodes. Nonperturbative effects leave a signature on the way in which the number of diagrams and resummations diverge at high order. It is only because non-perturbative effects appear in hidden form in diagrams that it was possible to analyze nonperturbative effects in string theory, where in many cases a Feynman description is the only one available.

'''HHole for Mannheim (2006-∞)''' is a permanent multimedia installation in the "Athene-Trakt" of the [[:de:Kunsthalle Mannheim|Kunsthalle Mannheim]]&lt;ref name="Kunsthalle Mannheim 1907-2007"&gt;{{cite book | title=100 Yahre Kunsthalle Mannheim 1907-2007 | publisher=Kunsthalle Mannheim | year=2007 | isbn=978-3-89165-210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; created by [[NatHalie Braun Barends]].

The Kunsthalle is {{asof|2015}} under reconstruction. Following a court decision of the Landgericht Mannheim, the installation will likely not be rebuilt afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/kunsthalle-muss-mannheimer-loch-nicht-wieder-installieren-13556651.html|title=Landgericht weist Klage ab: Kunsthalle muss „Mannheimer Loch“ nicht wieder installieren|trans-title=|author=|date=24 April 2015|publisher=|access-date=26 January 2017|via=FAZ.NET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Landgericht Mannheim decided that the right of the owner of the building (even if against the signed loan contracts) overrides  the copyright and the property of the artist, to allow the city to build the new €70 millions museum. It is to appreciate that the artist, in order to protect the fundamental right of artistic freedom, property right and copyright will go on to the next instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/kunst-und-architektur/article140084472/Und-ich-sage-dieses-Loch-ist-Kunst.html|title=Mannheimer Loch: Ist es nichts?

== Description ==
HHole for Mannheim (2006-∞) has been conceived as a permanent, conceptual, site specific, developing artwork in progress.&lt;ref name="NatHalie Braun Barends - Light Art Life"&gt;{{cite book | title=NatHalie Braun Barends - Light Art Life | publisher=Art Space | year=2007 | location=Berlin/New York/Santiago | isbn=978-3-941494-00-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It consists of seven holes which pass through the Athene Trakt that unites the old (Billing-Bau) and the new building (Mitzlaff-Bau) of the Mannheim Kunsthalle.

The natural light flows from the topmost hole above the museum rooftop, through the holes in the floors below, meeting the light projected upwards from a Gobo projector located at the lowest floor. At the rooftop, a custom designed laser light (also used by astronomers to point at stars), projects into the universe the artist's symbol of the HMap. The natural and the artificial lights meet again symbolically at the antipodes of the museum, close to New Zealand at 49° 28′ 56.68″ S, 171° 31′ 29.63″ E.

Seven rooms contain the seven holes, starting from above: Infinite Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/7-infinite/infinite.php-page=text.htm|title=Infinite Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phoenix Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hn2b.net/HHole/6-phoenix/phoenix.php-page=text.htm|title=Phoenix Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflection Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/5-reflection/reflection.php-page=text.htm|title=Reflection Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silence Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/4-silence/silence.php-page=text.htm|title=Silence Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treasure Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/3-treasure/treasure.php-page=text.htm|title=Treasure Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ground Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/2-ground/ground.php-page=text.htm|title=Ground Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Earth Room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/1-earth/earth.php-page=text.htm|title=Earth Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each room hosts different installations, with videos, HHole specially designed acrylic furniture, waterfall, living tree, pool, and telephone to connect each level.

Higher-order theories are distinguished from other [[Cognition|cognitive]]/representational accounts of consciousness which suggest that merely first-order mentality of certain sorts constitutes consciousness.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;

==Motivation==

Higher-order theory can account for the distinction between unconscious and conscious brain processing. Both types of mental operations involve first-order manipulations, and according to higher-order theory, what makes cognition conscious is a higher-order observation of the first-order processing.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;

In [[neuroscience]] terms, higher-order theory is motivated by the distinction between first-order information in early sensory regions versus higher-order representations in [[Prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] and [[Parietal lobe|parietal cortices]].&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|365–66}}

==Types==

===Higher-order perception theory===

Also called '''inner-sense theory''', this version of higher-order theory proposes that phenomenal consciousness consists not in immediate sensations but in higher-level sensing of those [[Sensation (psychology)|sensations]]. Or put another way:
: A phenomenally conscious mental state is a state with analog/non-conceptual [[Intentionality|intentional]] content, which is in turn the target of a higher-order analog/non-conceptual intentional state, via the operations of a faculty of 'inner sense'.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;
One motivation for this approach is that it accounts for phenomenal consciousness absent beliefs or behaviors associated with those experiences—so that, e.g., someone could feel pain without necessarily exhibiting functional reactions to pain.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;

===Actualist higher-order thought theory===

[[David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)|David Rosenthal]] is a foremost advocate of this view. It claims that a mental state is conscious when it's the subject of a '''higher-order thought''' (HOT). Phenomenal consciousness in particular corresponds to certain kinds of mental states (e.g., visual inputs) that are the subjects of HOTs. Rosenthal excludes the special case in which one learns about one's lower-order states by conscious deduction. For instance, if [[psychoanalysis]] could reveal one's unconscious motives, this would not suddenly make them conscious.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;

===Dispositionalist higher-order thought theory===

The dispositionalist mirrors the actualist view except that the first-order mental state needn't actually be thought about—it only needs to be available to potentially be thought about.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;

While actualist accounts would seem to require immense higher-order computation on all first-order percepts, dispositionalist accounts do not; they merely require ''availability'' of first-order information. Such availability could come from, e.g., global broadcasting as in the [[Global Workspace Theory]].&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;

===Self-representational higher-order theories===

Self-representational higher-order theories consider the higher-order state to be ''constitutive'' or ''internal'' to its first-order state.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt; This may be either because
# the first-order and higher-order states are identical, with the same state serving two different roles, or
# the first-order and higher-order states are part of the same whole, and the whole complex is what becomes conscious.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;
An example of the second, "part-whole" self-representational theory is Vincent Picciuto's "quotational theory of consciousness" in which consciousness consists of "mentally quoting" a first-order perception.&lt;ref name=Picciuto2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Picciuto|first1=Vincent|title=Consciousness and Mental Quotation: An intrinsic higher-order approach|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1903/15231|website=Digital Repository at the University of Maryland|accessdate=31 August 2014|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher-order statistical inference view===

In this theory, higher-level processing determines that a first-order representation is reliable.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|366}}

===Radical plasticity thesis===

Similar to a HOT view, this theory proposes that the brain "learns" when there exists a trustworthy lower-level representation.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|366}}

==Scientific perspectives==

Higher-order theories originated in philosophy, but they have also gained some scientific defenders.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hakwan Lau|author2=David Rosenthal|title=Empirical support for higher-order theories of conscious awareness|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=Aug 2011|volume=15|issue=8|pages=365–373|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2011.05.009|url=http://www.summer12.isc.uqam.ca/page/docs/readings/Lau-Hakwan/Lau-Rosenthal-Empirical-support-for-higher-order-theories-of-conscious-awareness.pdf|pmid=21737339}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|365}} Here are some examples of evidence supporting higher-order views:
* Reporting of conscious experience seems in some studies to occur serially following unconscious processing rather than in parallel with it.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|368}}
* Unconscious processing is quite powerful on its own, so it's not obvious that task performance requires consciousness. Higher-order views agree with this, unlike, e.g., global-workspace views.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|368}}
* Impairments to the prefrontal cortex may impair subjective reports without affecting task performance. If the prefrontal cortex were mainly serving an attentional role, performance should degrade along with reportability.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|369}}
* Some interpretations of certain disorders of consciousness suggest that they operate by affecting the prefrontal cortex, where higher-order thoughts are assumed to take place.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|370–71}}

[[Edmund Rolls]] defends a higher-order account of consciousness. He argues that consciousness consists in higher-order thoughts allowing one to monitor and correct errors and "that the brain systems that are required for consciousness and language are similar."&lt;ref name=Rolls2005&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edmund T. Rolls|title=Emotion Explained|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0198570035}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|404–05}} [[Qualia]] like pain become conscious when "they enter into a specialized linguistic symbol-manipulation system, which is part of a higher-order thought system" that helps with, inter alia, "flexible planning of actions."&lt;ref name=Rolls2005 /&gt;{{rp|407}}

==Criticisms==

===Against inner-sense and actualist HOT views===

Scott Sturgeon argues against inner-sense theory on the grounds that it could give rise to disorders in which, e.g., one has a first-order perception of red which mis-triggers a second-order sense of "looks orange". But we don't see any such disorders in [[neurology]].&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sturgeon2000&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sturgeon|first1=Scott|title=Matters of Mind: Consciousness, Reason and Nature|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, inner-sense and actualist views face the "targetless higher-order representation problem" in which there might be, e.g., a higher-order experience/thought about perceiving red without a corresponding first-order redness percept.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt; One reply is that this is no more a problem for higher-order theories than for other neuroscientific theories of consciousness, which also involve many layers of processing that could theoretically be inconsistent.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|370}}

[[Peter Carruthers (philosopher)|Peter Carruthers]] points out that inner sense of or actualist HOTs about first-order percepts might greatly increase the computing power required to consciously process stimuli, for not only does one need to have a perception, but one then needs to have another (perhaps highly detailed) perception or thought about that perception.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Carruthers2000&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carruthers|first1=Peter|title=Phenomenal Consciousness: A Naturalistic Theory|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against any higher-order view===

The "rock objection" notes that thinking about a rock doesn't cause the rock to "light up" with consciousness, so why does thinking about a first-order percept cause it to light up? Higher-order theorists reply that first-order states need to be mental states, which rocks are not.

'''Hilde Lindemann''' (also ''Hilde Lindemann Nelson'') is an American philosophy professor and bioethicist currently teaching at [[Michigan State University]]. Lindemann earned her B.A. in German language and literature in 1969 at the [[University of Georgia]]. Lindemann also earned her M.A. in theatre history and dramatic literature, in 1972, at the [[University of Georgia]]. Lindemann began her career as a copyeditor for several universities ([http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/no-ethics-without-feminism/ Interview at 3AM Magazine]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/no-ethics-without-feminism/|title=No ethics without feminism|website=3:AM Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;). She then moved on to a job at the Hastings Center in New York City, an institute focused on bioethics research, and co-authored book ''The Patient in the Family'' before deciding to earn a Ph.D. in philosophy at [[Fordham University]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Previously, she taught at the [[University of Tennessee]] and [[Vassar College]] and served as the associate editor of the [[Hastings Center Report]] (1990–95). Lindemann currently teaches courses on [[feminist philosophy]], identity and agency, naturalized bioethics, and narrative approaches to bioethics at Michigan State University.

==Contributions to philosophy==
Lindemann's work primarily focuses on feminist bioethics, the ethics of families, feminist ethics, and the social construction of identities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She is the former editor of ''[[Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy]]'' and was also coeditor, with [[Sara Ruddick]] and [[Margaret Urban Walker]], of the Feminist Constructions series for Rowman &amp; Littlefield. In addition, she coedited, with James Lindemann Nelson, a series on Reflective Bioethics for Routledge.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Lindemann is a [[Hastings Center]] Fellow, a member of the advisory board for the Women’s Bioethics Project (2006–), and was the president of the [[American Society for Bioethics and Humanities]] (2008–2009).

Hilde Lindemann is a narrative [[ethicist]]. A narrative approach uses stories and relationships between people in specific cases, as well as generalizable examples, for moral contexts and discussion (Gotlib&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fem-e-n/|title=Feminist Ethics and Narrative Ethics {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Two of her books, ''Holding and Letting Go: The Social Practice of Personal Identities'' and ''Alzheimer's: Answers to Hard Questions for Families,'' co-authored by her partner James Lindemann Nelson, have various reviews that summarize philosophical theories and ethics demonstrated in her works.

The review of ''Holding and Letting Go: The Social Practice of Personal Identities'' and ''Alzheimer's Answer to Hard Questions for Families'' explains that Lindemann adopts a non-obscure, story-related approach to make readers think about realistic situations: "Only when we see ethical lives as diachronically and interpersonally structured and as embedded in narratively rich contexts can ethical reflection take hold in actual persons' lives" (Christman&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/57247-holding-and-letting-go-the-social-practice-of-personal-identities/|title=Holding and Letting Go: The Social Practice of Personal Identities // Reviews // Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews // University of Notre Dame|last=Dame|first=ENR // AgencyND // University of Notre|website=ndpr.nd.edu|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The review of the co-authored book, ''Alzheimer's: Answers to Hard Questions for Families'', also demonstrates that Lindemann employs case studies and life experiences for the patients and caregivers to convey ideas in her work (Moody&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moody|first=Harry|date=Jun 1, 1998|title=James Lindemann Nelson and Hilde Lindemann Nelson, "Alzheimer's Answer to Hard Questions for Families" (Book Review)|url=http://search.proquest/docview/1303258761|journal=The Journal of Value Inquiry|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This method of provoking thought is aimed at a wide general audience of people who are not necessarily ethics scholars.

==Quotes on philosophy==
* "I think it’s a great mistake to see feminism as a war on men. Men aren’t responsible for the subordination of women – they just benefit from it. It’s not politically useful to set men up as the enemy, because that alienates people whom we need as allies. And it perpetuates the victor/vanquished, master/slave relation that’s the whole problem in the first place. If the gender system is ever to be dismantled, it won’t be by declaring war on men. It’s much better to affirm lots of differences among people without insisting that differences have to be ordered into power hierarchies"([http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/no-ethics-without-feminism/ Interview at 3AM Magazine] 2012&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;).
* "Narrativists have claimed, among other things, that stories of one kind or another are required: (1) to teach us our duties, (2) to guide morally good action, (3) to motivate morally good action, (4) to justify action on moral grounds, (5) to cultivate our moral sensibilities, (6) to enhance our moral perception, (7) to make actions of persons morally intelligible, and (8) to reinvent ourselves as better persons (Nelson 2001, 36)." (Gotlib&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8171">'''Human dynamics''' refer to a branch of [[complex systems]] research in [[statistical physics]] such as the movement of crowds and queues and other systems of complex human interactions including [[statistical model]]ling of human networks, including interactions over communications networks.

==Academic research==

Human Dynamics as a branch of statistical physics: Its main goal is to understand human behavior using methods originally developed in statistical physics. Research in this area started to gain momentum in 2005 after the publication of A.-L. Barabási's seminal paper ''The origin of bursts and heavy tails in human dynamics.''&lt;ref name="Barabasi05-1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A.-L. Barabási |year=2005|title=The origin of bursts and heavy tails in human dynamics.|journal=Nature|volume= 435|pages=207–211|pmid=15889093|issue=7039|doi=10.1038/nature03459|arxiv = cond-mat/0505371 |bibcode = 2005Natur.435..207B }}&lt;/ref&gt; that introduced a queuing model that was alleged to be capable of explaining the long tailed distribution of inter event times that naturally occur in human activity.

This paper spurred a burst of activity in this new area leading to not only further theoretical development of the Barabasi model,&lt;ref name="vazquez05-1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.248701|author1=A.

The term ''Human Dynamics'' or ''Human Dynamics as Personality Dynamics'' has also been used to describe a technique aimed at education and team building which has been subject to some skepticism, having been described in a Dutch newspaper as a personality course with esoteric (occult) roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nd.nl/artikelen/2009/november/09/skepsis-bekritiseert-occulte-schooltraining |title=Skepsis bekritiseert 'occulte' schooltraining |work=[[Nederlands Dagblad]] |date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=4 September 2014 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nanninga |first=Rob |authorlink=Rob Nanninga|date=2009 |url=http://www.skepsis.nl/human-dynamics.html |title=Human Dynamics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15841">The '''Huzita–Hatori axioms''' or '''Huzita–Justin axioms''' are a set of rules related to the [[Mathematics of paper folding|mathematical principles of paper folding]], describing the operations that can be made when folding a piece of paper. The axioms assume that the operations are completed on a plane (i.e. a perfect piece of paper), and that all folds are linear. These are not a minimal set of axioms but rather the complete set of possible single folds.

The axioms were first discovered by Jacques Justin in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Justin|first=Jacques|date=1986|title=Résolution par le pliage de l’équation du troisième degré et applications géométriques|url=https://mathinfo.unistra.fr/fileadmin/upload/IREM/Publications/L_Ouvert/n042/o_42_9-19.pdf|journal=L’Ouvert - Journal de l’APMEP d’Alsace et de l’IREM de Strasbourg|language=French|volume=42|issue=|pages=9–19|doi=|pmid=|access-date=September 7, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Axioms 1 through 6 were rediscovered by [[Japanese people|Japanese]]-[[Italy|Italian]] mathematician [[Humiaki Huzita]] and reported at ''the First International Conference on Origami in Education and Therapy'' in 1991. Axioms 1 though 5 were rediscovered by Auckly and Cleveland in 1995. Axiom 7 was rediscovered by Koshiro Hatori in 2001; [[Robert J. Lang]] also found axiom 7.

==The seven axioms==
The first 6 axioms are known as Huzita's axioms. Axiom 7 was discovered by Koshiro Hatori. Jacques Justin and [[Robert J. Lang]] also found axiom 7. The axioms are as follows:

# Given two distinct points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique fold that passes through both of them.
# Given two distinct points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique fold that places ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
# Given two lines ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
# Given a point ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and a line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique fold perpendicular to ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that passes through point ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
# Given two points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and passes through ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
# Given two points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and two lines ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
# Given one point ''p'' and two lines ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''p'' onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and is perpendicular to ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Axiom 5 may have 0, 1, or 2 solutions, while Axiom 6 may have 0, 1, 2, or 3 solutions. In this way, the resulting geometries of origami are stronger than the geometries of [[compass and straightedge]], where the maximum number of solutions an axiom has is 2. Thus compass and straightedge geometry solves second-degree equations, while origami geometry, or origametry, can solve third-degree equations, and solve problems such as [[angle trisection]] and [[doubling of the cube]]. The construction of the fold guaranteed by Axiom 6 requires "sliding" the paper, or [[neusis]], which is not allowed in classical compass and straightedge constructions. Use of neusis together with a compass and straightedge does allow trisection of an arbitrary angle.

==Details==

===Axiom 1===
Given two points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique fold that passes through both of them.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 1.png|Folding a line through two points]]

In parametric form, the equation for the line that passes through the two points is :

:&lt;math&gt;F(s)=p_1 +s(p_2 - p_1).&lt;/math&gt;

===Axiom 2===
Given two points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique fold that places ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 2.png|Folding a line putting one point on another]]

This is equivalent to finding the perpendicular bisector of the line segment ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This can be done in four steps:

* Use '''Axiom 1''' to find the line through ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, given by &lt;math&gt;P(s)=p_1+s(p_2-p_1)&lt;/math&gt;
* Find the [[midpoint]] of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;mid&lt;/sub&gt; of ''P''(''s'')
* Find the vector '''v'''&lt;sup&gt;perp&lt;/sup&gt; perpendicular to ''P''(''s'')
* The [[parametric equation]] of the fold is then:
:&lt;math&gt;F(s)=p_\mathrm{mid} + s\cdot\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{perp}}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Axiom 3===
Given two lines ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 3.png|Folding a line putting one line on another]]

This is equivalent to finding a bisector of the angle between ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Let ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be any two points on ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and let ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be any two points on ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Also, let '''u''' and '''v''' be the unit direction vectors of ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively; that is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = (p_2-p_1) / \left|(p_2-p_1)\right|&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = (q_2-q_1) / \left|(q_2-q_1)\right|.&lt;/math&gt;

If the two lines are not parallel, their point of intersection is:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\mathrm{int} = p_1+s_\mathrm{int}\cdot\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;s_{int} = -\frac{\mathbf{v}^{\perp} \cdot (p_1 - q_1)} {\mathbf{v}^{\perp} \cdot \mathbf{u}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The direction of one of the bisectors is then:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w} = \frac{
\left|\mathbf{u}\right| \mathbf{v} +
\left|\mathbf{v}\right| \mathbf{u}}
{\left|\mathbf{u}\right| +
\left|\mathbf{v}\right|}.&lt;/math&gt;

And the parametric equation of the fold is:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = p_\mathrm{int} + s\cdot\mathbf{w}.&lt;/math&gt;

A second bisector also exists, perpendicular to the first and passing through ''p''&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;. Folding along this second bisector will also achieve the desired result of placing ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It may not be possible to perform one or the other of these folds, depending on the location of the intersection point.

If the two lines are parallel, they have no point of intersection. The fold must be the line midway between ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and parallel to them.

===Axiom 4===
Given a point ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and a line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique fold perpendicular to ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that passes through point ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 4.png|Folding through a point perpendicular to a line]]

This is equivalent to finding a perpendicular to ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that passes through ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. If we find some vector '''v''' that is perpendicular to the line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, then the parametric equation of the fold is:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = p_1 + s\cdot\mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Axiom 5===
Given two points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and passes through ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 5.png|Folding a point onto a line through another point]]

This axiom is equivalent to finding the intersection of a line with a circle, so it may have 0, 1, or 2 solutions. The line is defined by ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the circle has its center at ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and a radius equal to the distance from ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. If the line does not intersect the circle, there are no solutions. If the line is tangent to the circle, there is one solution, and if the line intersects the circle in two places, there are two solutions.

If we know two points on the line, (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then the line can be expressed parametrically as:

:&lt;math&gt;x = x_1 + s(x_2 - x_1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = y_1 + s(y_2 - y_1).&lt;/math&gt;

Let the circle be defined by its center at ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=(''x&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''), with radius &lt;math&gt;r = \left|p_1 - p_2\right|&lt;/math&gt;. Then the circle can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;(x-x_c)^2 + (y-y_c)^2 = r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

In order to determine the points of intersection of the line with the circle, we substitute the ''x'' and ''y'' components of the equations for the line into the equation for the circle, giving:

:&lt;math&gt;(x_1 + s(x_2-x_1) - x_c)^2 + (y_1 + s(y_2 - y_1) - y_c)^2 = r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Or, simplified:

:&lt;math&gt;as^2 + bs + c = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;a = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = 2(x_2 - x_1)(x_1 - x_c) + 2(y_2 - y_1)(y_1 - y_c)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c = x_c^2 + y_c^2 + x_1^2 + y_1^2 - 2(x_c x_1 + y_c y_1)-r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Then we simply solve the quadratic equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the discriminant ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;4''ac'' &amp;lt; 0, there are no solutions. The circle does not intersect or touch the line. If the discriminant is equal to 0, then there is a single solution, where the line is tangent to the circle. And if the discriminant is greater than 0, there are two solutions, representing the two points of intersection. Let us call the solutions ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, if they exist. We have 0, 1, or 2 line segments:

:&lt;math&gt;m_1 = \overline{p_1 d_1} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m_2 = \overline{p_1 d_2}. &lt;/math&gt;

A fold ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') perpendicular to ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through its midpoint will place ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the line at location ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Similarly, a fold ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') perpendicular to ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through its midpoint will place ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the line at location ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The application of Axiom 2 easily accomplishes this. The parametric equations of the folds are thus:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F_1(s) &amp; = p_1 +\frac{1}{2}(d_1-p_1)+s(d_1-p_1)^\perp \\[8pt]
F_2(s) &amp; = p_1 +\frac{1}{2}(d_2-p_1)+s(d_2-p_1)^\perp.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Axiom 6===
Given two points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and two lines ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 6.png]]

This axiom is equivalent to finding a line simultaneously tangent to two parabolas, and can be considered equivalent to solving a third-degree equation as there are in general three solutions. The two parabolas have foci at ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, with directrices defined by ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

This fold is called the Beloch fold after [[Margherita Piazzola Beloch | Margharita P. Beloch]], who in 1936 showed using it that origami can be used to solve general cubic equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Solving Cubics With Creases: The Work of Beloch and Lill |author=Thomas C. Hull |url=http://mars.wne.edu/~thull/papers/amer.math.monthly.118.04.307-hull.pdf |journal=American Mathematical Monthly |date=April 2011 |pages=307–315|doi=10.4169/amer.math.monthly.118.04.307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Axiom 7===
Given one point ''p'' and two lines ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''p'' onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and is perpendicular to ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita-Hatori axiom 7.png]]

This axiom was originally discovered by Jacques Justin in 1989 but was overlooked and was rediscovered by Koshiro Hatori in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=One-, Two-, and Multi-Fold Origami Axioms |url=http://www.math.sjsu.edu/~alperin/AlperinLang.pdf |author1=Roger C. Alperin |author2=Robert J. Lang |journal=4OSME |publisher=A K Peters |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert J. Lang]] has proven that this list of axioms completes the axioms of origami.

==Constructibility==
Subsets of the axioms  can be used to construct different sets of numbers. The first three can be used with three given points not on a line to do what Alperin calls Thalian constructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Mathematical Theory of Origami Constructions and Numbers |first1=Roger C |last1=Alperin |journal=New York Journal of Mathematics |year=2000 |volume=6 |pages=119–133 |url=http://nyjm.albany.edu/j/2000/6-8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first four axioms with two given points define a system weaker than [[compass and straightedge constructions]]: every shape that can be folded with those axioms can be constructed with compass and straightedge, but some things can be constructed by compass and straightedge that cannot be folded with those axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=D. Auckly and J. Cleveland|title=Totally real origami and impossible paperfolding|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=102|pages=215–226|arxiv=math/0407174|doi=10.2307/2975008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers that can be constructed are called the origami or pythagorean numbers, if the distance between the two given points is 1 then the constructible points are all of the form &lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are Pythagorean numbers. The Pythagorean numbers are given by the smallest field containing the rational numbers and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is such a number.

Adding the fifth axiom gives the [[Euclidean number]]s, that is the points constructible by [[Compass-and-straightedge_construction|compass and straightedge construction]].

Adding the [[Neusis construction|neusis]] axiom 6, all compass-straightedge constructions, and more, can be made.  In particular, the [[Constructible polygon|constructible]] regular polygons with these axioms are those with &lt;math&gt;2^a3^b\rho\ge3&lt;/math&gt; sides, where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a product of distinct [[Pierpont prime]]s.  Compass-straightedge constructions allow only those with  &lt;math&gt;2^a\phi\ge3&lt;/math&gt; sides, where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a product of distinct [[Fermat prime]]s.  (Fermat primes are a [[subset]] of Pierpont primes.)

The seventh axiom does not allow construction of further axioms. The seven axioms give all the single-fold constructions that can be done rather than being a minimal set of axioms.

== An eighth axiom ==
The existence of an eighth axiom was claimed by Lucero in 2017, which may be stated as: there is a fold along a given line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lucero|first=Jorge C.|date=2017|title=On the Elementary Single-Fold Operations of Origami: Reflections and Incidence Constraints on the Plane|url=http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2017volume17/FG201725.pdf|journal=Forum Geometricorum|volume=17|pages=207-221|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new axiom was found after enumerating all possible incidences between constructible points and lines on a plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/lee_hwa-young_201712_ma.pdf|title=Origami-Constructible Numbers|last=Lee|first=Hwa Y.|publisher=University of Georgia|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=64|type=Master's Thesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it does not create a new line, it is nevertheless needed in actual paper folding when it is required to fold a layer of paper along a line marked on the layer immediately below.

'''Information management''' ('''IM''') concerns a cycle of organizational activity: the acquisition of [[information]] from one or more sources, the custodianship and the distribution of that information to those who need it, and its ultimate [[disposition]] through [[archiving]] or deletion.

This cycle of organisational involvement with information involves a variety of [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s, including those who are responsible for assuring the [[quality (business)|quality]], [[accessibility]] and [[utility]] of acquired information; those who are responsible for its safe [[Data storage device|storage]] and [[:wikt:disposal|disposal]]; and those who need it for [[decision making]]. Stakeholders might have rights to originate, change, distribute or delete information according to organisational information management [[policies]].

Information management embraces all the generic concepts of management, including the [[planning]], [[organizing (management)|organizing]], structuring, [[Business process|process]]ing, [[Internal control|control]]ling, [[evaluation]] and [[Data reporting|reporting]] of information activities, all of which is needed in order to meet the needs of those with organisational roles or functions that depend on information. These generic concepts allow the information to be presented to the audience or the correct group of people. After individuals are able to put that information to use, it then gains more value.

Information management is closely related to, and overlaps with, the management of ''[[data]]'', ''[[system]]s'', ''[[technology]]'', ''[[Business process|process]]es'' and – where the availability of information is critical to organisational success – ''[[strategy]]''. This broad view of the realm of information management contrasts with the earlier, more traditional view, that the [[Project life cycle|life cycle]] of managing information is an operational matter that requires specific procedures, organisational capabilities and standards that deal with information as a [[product (business)|product]] or a service.

==History==

===Emergent ideas out of data management===
In the 1970s, the management of information largely concerned matters closer to what would now be called [[data management]]: [[punched cards]], [[magnetic tape]]s and other record-keeping [[Digital media|media]], involving a life cycle of such formats requiring origination, distribution, backup, maintenance and disposal. At this time the huge potential of [[information technology]] began to be recognised: for example a single [[Integrated circuit|chip]] storing a whole [[book]], or [[electronic mail]] moving messages instantly around the world, remarkable ideas at the time.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, C., 1979. ''The Mighty Micro'', London: Victor Gollancz.&lt;/ref&gt; With the proliferation of information technology and the extending reach of information systems in the 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref name="Venkat0"&gt;Venkatraman, N., 1994. IT-enabled business transformation: from automation to business scope redefinition. ''Sloan Management Review'', 35(2), pp.73–87&lt;/ref&gt; information management took on a new form. Progressive businesses such as [[British Petroleum]] transformed the vocabulary of what was then "[[IT management]]", so that “[[systems analyst]]s” became “[[business analyst]]s”, “monopoly supply” became a mixture of “[[insourcing]]” and “[[outsourcing]]”, and the large IT function was transformed into “lean teams” that began to allow some agility in the processes that harness information for [[business benefit]].&lt;ref name="Cross and Earl"&gt;Cross, J. &amp; Earl, M., 1997. Transformation of the IT function at British Petroleum. ''MIS Quarterly'', 21(4), page 403&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of [[senior management]] interest in information at British Petroleum extended from the creation of value through improved [[business process]]es, based upon the effective management of information, permitting the implementation of appropriate information systems (or “[[application software|applications]]”) that were operated on [[IT infrastructure]] that was [[outsource]]d.&lt;ref name="Cross and Earl" /&gt; In this way, information management was no longer a simple job that could be performed by anyone who had nothing else to do, it became highly strategic and a matter for [[senior management]] attention. An understanding of the technologies involved, an ability to manage information systems [[project]]s and [[business change]] well, and a willingness to align technology and business strategies all became necessary.&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"&gt;Ward, J. &amp; Peppard, J., 2002. ''Strategic Planning for Information Systems'' (3rd Edition), Chichester: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positioning information management in the bigger picture===
In the transitional period leading up to the strategic view of information management, Venkatraman (a strong advocate of this transition and transformation,&lt;ref name="Venkat2"&gt;Venkatraman, N., 1994. IT-enabled business transformation: from automation to business scope redefinition. ''Sloan Management Review'', 35(2), pp.73–87.&lt;/ref&gt; proffered a simple arrangement of ideas that succinctly brought together the  managements [[Data management|of data]], information, and [[knowledge management|knowledge]] (see the figure)) argued that:

* Data that is maintained in IT infrastructure has to be ''interpreted'' in order to render information.
* The information in our information systems has to be ''understood'' in order to emerge as knowledge.
* Knowledge allows managers to ''take effective decisions''.
* Effective decisions have to lead to ''appropriate actions''. 
* Appropriate actions are expected to deliver ''meaningful results''.

[[File:DIKAR model.jpg|thumb|This simple model summarises a presentation by Venkatraman in 1996, as reported by Ward and Peppard (2002, page 207).&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"/&gt;]]
This is often referred to as the [[DIKAR]] model: Data, Information, Knowledge, Action and Result,&lt;ref name="Venkat1"&gt;Venkatraman, N., 1996. Managing IT resources as a value center, ''IS Executive Seminar Series, Cranfield School of Management''&lt;/ref&gt; it gives a strong clue as to the layers involved in aligning technology and organisational strategies, and it can be seen as a pivotal moment in changing attitudes to information management.  The recognition that information management is an investment that must deliver meaningful results is important to all modern organisations that depend on information and good decision-making for their success.&lt;ref name="Bytheway"&gt;Bytheway, A., 2015. [https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319119083 Investing in Information: the Information Management Body of Knowledge], Geneva: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical background==

===Behavioural and organisational theories===
It is commonly believed that good information management is crucial to the smooth working of organisations, and although there is no commonly accepted [[theory]] of information management ''per se'', behavioural and organisational theories help. Following the [[behavioural science]] theory of management, mainly developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and prominently supported by March and Simon,&lt;ref name="March and Simon" /&gt; most of what goes on in modern organizations is actually information handling and decision making. One crucial factor in information handling and decision making is an individual's ability to process information and to make decisions under limitations that might derive from the context: a person's age, the situational complexity, or a lack of requisite quality in the information that is at hand – all of which is exacerbated by the rapid advance of technology and the new kinds of [[system]] that it enables, especially as the [[social web]] emerges as a phenomenon that business cannot ignore. And yet, well before there was any general recognition of the importance of information management in organisations, March and Simon &lt;ref name="March and Simon"&gt;March, J.G. &amp; Simon, H.A., 1958. ''Organizations'', Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; argued that organizations have to be considered as [[cooperative systems]], with a high level of information processing and a vast need for decision making at various levels. Instead of using the model of the "[[economic man]]", as advocated in classical theory &lt;ref name="Opp"&gt;see Opp, K.-D., 1985. Sociology and economic man. ''Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft/Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics'', pp.213–243&lt;/ref&gt; they proposed "[[administrative man]]" as an alternative, based on their argumentation about the cognitive limits of rationality. Additionally they proposed the notion of [[satisficing]], which entails searching through the available alternatives until an acceptability threshold is met - another idea that still has currency.&lt;ref name="Winter"&gt;Winter, S.G., 2000. The satisficing principle in capability learning. ''Strategic Management Journal'', 21(10-11), pp.981–996&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic theory===
In addition to the organisational factors mentioned by March and Simon, there are other issues that stem from economic and environmental dynamics. There is the cost of collecting and evaluating the information needed to take a decision, including the time and effort required.&lt;ref name="Hedberg"&gt;Hedberg, Bo (1981), "How organizations learn and unlearn", in: Nyström, P.C. &amp; Starbuck, W.H., ''Handbook of Organizational Design'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The [[transaction cost]] associated with information processes can be high. In particular, established organizational rules and procedures can prevent the taking of the most appropriate decision, leading to sub-optimum outcomes 
.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"&gt;Mackenzie K.D. (1978), ''Organizational Structures'', AHM Publishing Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullins"&gt;Mullins, L.J (1993), ''Management and Organizational Behaviours'', 3rd ed., Pitman Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; This is an issue that has been presented as a major problem with bureaucratic organizations that lose the economies of strategic change because of entrenched attitudes.&lt;ref name="Wigand"&gt;Wigand, Rolf T., Picot, Arnold and Reichwald, Ralf (1997), ''Information, Organization and Management: Expanding Markets and Corporate Boundaries'', Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic information management==

===Background===
According to the Carnegie Mellon School an organization's ability to process information is at the core of organizational and managerial [[competence (human resources)|competency]], and an organization's strategies must be designed to improve information processing capability &lt;ref name="Cyert"&gt;Cyert, R.M. &amp; March, J.G., 1959. A behavioural theory of organizational objectives. ''Modern Organization Theory'', Wiley, New York, pp.76–90&lt;/ref&gt; and as information systems that provide that capability became formalised and automated, competencies were severely tested at many levels.&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;Morton, M.S.S., 1991. ''The corporation of the 1990s: Information technology and organizational transformation'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; It was recognised that organisations needed to be able to learn and adapt in ways that were never so evident before &lt;ref name="Senge"&gt;Senge, P.M., 1990. ''The fifth discipline'', Doubleday&lt;/ref&gt; and academics began to organise and publish definitive works concerning the strategic management of information, and information systems.&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"&gt;Ward, J. &amp; Peppard, J., 2002. ''Strategic Planning for Information Systems'' (3rd Edition), Chichester: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Earl"&gt;Earl, M.J., 1989. ''Management Strategies for Information Technology'', Upper Saddle River, NJ, USA: Prentice-Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, the ideas of [[business process]] management &lt;ref name="Hammer and Champy"&gt;Hammer, M. &amp; Champy, J., 2009. ''Reengineering the Corporation: Manifesto for Business Revolution'', A, Zondervan&lt;/ref&gt; and [[knowledge management]] &lt;ref name="Nonaka and Takeuchi"&gt;Nonaka, I. &amp; Takeuchi, H., 1995. ''The knowledge creating company: how Japanese companies create the dynamics of innovation'', New York, NY, USA: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; although much of the optimistic early thinking about [[business process redesign]] has since been discredited in the information management literature.&lt;ref name="Belmiro"&gt;Belmiro, T., Gardiner, P. &amp; Simmons, J., 1997. Business process re-engineering—A discredited vocabulary? ''International Journal of Information Management'', 17(1), pp.21–33&lt;/ref&gt; In the strategic studies field, it is considered of the highest priority the understanding of the information environment, conceived as the aggregate of individuals, organizations, and systems that collect, process, disseminate, or act on information. This environment consists of three interrelated dimensions which continuously interact with individuals, organizations, and systems. These dimensions are the physical, informational, and cognitive.&lt;ref&gt;Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army (2012). Information Operations. Joint Publication 3-13. Joint Doctrine Support Division, 116 Lake View Parkway, Suffolk, VA., p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aligning technology and business strategy with information management===

Venkatraman has provided a simple view of the requisite capabilities of an organisation that wants to manage information well – the [[DIKAR]] model (see above). He also worked with others to understand how technology and business strategies could be appropriately aligned in order to identify specific capabilities that are needed.&lt;ref name="Henderson and Venkat"&gt;Henderson, J.C. &amp; Venkatraman, N., 1993. Strategic alignment: leveraging information technology for transforming organizations. ''IBM Systems Journal'', 32(1), pp.4–16&lt;/ref&gt; This work was paralleled by other writers in the world of consulting,&lt;ref name="Zachman"&gt;Zachman, J. A. (1987). A framework for information systems architecture. ''IBM Systems Journal'', 26(3), 590–616&lt;/ref&gt; practice &lt;ref name="Cross"&gt;Cross, J., 1995. IT outsourcing : British Petroleum’s competitive approach. ''Harvard Business Review'', 73(3), p.94&lt;/ref&gt; and academia.&lt;ref name="Ward2"&gt;Ward, J. &amp; Daniel, E., 2005. ''Benefits Management: Delivering Value from IS and IT Investments'', Chichester: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

===A contemporary portfolio model for information===
Bytheway has collected and organised basic tools and techniques for information management in a single volume.&lt;ref name="Bytheway" /&gt;  At the heart of his view of information management is a portfolio model that takes account of the surging interest in external sources of information and the need to organise un-structured information external so as to make it useful (see the figure).

[[File:An Information Portfolio.jpg|thumb|This portfolio model organizes issues of internal and external sourcing and management of information, that may be either structured or unstructured.]]

Such an information portfolio as this shows how information can be gathered and usefully organised, in four stages:

'''Stage 1''': Taking advantage of [[public information]]: recognise and adopt well-structured external schemes of reference data, such as post codes, weather data, GPS positioning data and travel timetables, exemplified in the personal computing press.&lt;ref name="Ashbrook"&gt;Ashbrook, D. &amp; Starner, T., 2003. Using GPS to learn significant locations and predict movement across multiple users. ''Personal and Ubiquitous Computing'', 7(5), pp.275–286&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage 2''': Tagging the noise on the [[world wide web]]: use existing schemes such as [[post code]]s and [[GPS]] data or more typically by adding “tags”, or construct a formal [[ontology]] that provides structure. Shirky provides an overview of these two approaches.&lt;ref name="Shirky"&gt;Shirky, C., 2005. Shirky: Ontology is Overrated -- Categories, Links, and Tags. ''Clay Shirky’s Writings About the Internet''. Available at: http://shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html [Accessed May 23, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage 3''': Sifting and analysing: in the wider world the generalised ontologies that are under development extend to hundreds of entities and hundreds of relations between them and provide the means to elicit meaning from large volumes of data. Structured data in databases works best when that structure reflects a higher-level information model – an ontology, or an [[entity-relationship model]].&lt;ref name="Noy"&gt;Noy, N.F., McGuinness, D.L. &amp; others, 2001. Ontology development 101: A guide to creating your first ontology, ''Stanford knowledge systems laboratory technical report KSL-01-05 and Stanford medical informatics technical report SMI-2001-0880''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage 4''': Structuring and archiving: with the large volume of data available from sources such as the [[social web]] and from the miniature [[telemetry]] systems used in personal [[health management]], new ways to archive and then trawl data for meaningful information. [[Map-reduce]] methods, originating from [[functional programming]], are a more recent way of eliciting information from large archival [[dataset]]s that is becoming interesting to regular businesses that have very large data resources to work with, but it requires advanced multi-processor resources.&lt;ref name="Chu"&gt;Chu, C. et al., 2007. Map-reduce for machine learning on multicore. ''Advances in neural information processing systems'', 19, p.281&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competencies to manage information well===
The [[Information Management Body of Knowledge]] was made available on the world wide web in 2004 &lt;ref name="IMBOK"&gt;IMBOK, 2004. ''The Information Management Body of Knowledge''. Available at: http://www.imbok.org [Accessed May 12, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; 
and sets out to show that the required management competencies to derive real benefits from an investment in information are complex and multi-layered. The framework model that is the basis for understanding competencies comprises six “knowledge” areas and four “process” areas:

[[File:IMBOK Framework.jpg|thumb|This framework is the basis of organising the "Information Management Body of Knowledge" first made available in 2004. This version is adapted by the addition of "Business information" in 2014.]]
;The information management knowledge areas
The IMBOK is based on the argument that there are six areas of required management competency, two of which (“business process management” and “business information management”) are very closely related.&lt;ref name="Bytheway2"&gt;Bytheway, A., 2015. ''Investing in Information:  the Information Management Body of Knowledge'', Geneva: Springer,
 p29&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Information technology''': The pace of change of [[technology]] and the pressure to constantly acquire the newest technological products can undermine the stability of the [[infrastructure]] that supports systems, and thereby optimises [[business process]]es and delivers benefits. It is necessary to manage the “[[supply side]]” and recognise that technology is, increasingly, becoming a [[commodity]].&lt;ref name="Carr"&gt;Carr, N., 2003. IT doesn’t matter. In ''Wringing real value from IT''. HBR OnPoint, pp. 3–10&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Information system''': While historically information systems were developed [[in-house]], over the years it has become possible to acquire most of the software systems that an organisation needs from the [[Application software|software package]] industry. However, there is still the potential for [[competitive advantage]] from the implementation of new systems ideas that deliver to the strategic intentions of organisations.&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"/&gt;
* '''Business processes and Business information''': [[Information system]]s are applied to [[business process]]es in order to improve them, and they bring data to the business that becomes useful as [[business information]]. [[Business process management]] is still seen as a relatively new idea because it is not universally adopted, and it has been difficult in many cases; business ''information'' management is even more of a challenge.&lt;ref name="Belmiro0"&gt;Belmiro, T.R. et al., 2000. Are BPR practitioners really addressing business processes? ''International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management'', 20(10), pp.1183–1203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davenport"&gt;Davenport, T.H. &amp; Short, J., 2003. Information technology and business process redesign. ''Operations management: critical perspectives on business and management'', 1, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Business benefit''': What are the benefits that we are seeking? It is necessary not only to be brutally honest about what ''can'' be achieved, but also to ensure the active management and assessment of benefit delivery. Since the emergence and popularisation of the [[Balanced scorecard]] &lt;ref name="Kaplan and Norton"&gt;Kaplan, R. &amp; Norton, D., 1996. ''The balanced scorecard - translating stragegy into action'', Boston MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; there has been huge interest in business performance management but not much serious effort has been made to relate business performance management to the benefits of information technology investments and the introduction of new [[information system]]s until the turn of the [[millennium]].&lt;ref name="Ward2" /&gt;
* '''Business strategy''': Although a long way from the workaday issues of managing information in organisations, [[strategy]] in most organisations simply has to be informed by information technology and information systems opportunities, whether to address poor performance or to improve differentiation and [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]]. Strategic analysis tools such as the [[value chain]] and [[critical success factor]] analysis are directly dependent on proper attention to the information that is (or could be) managed &lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"/&gt;

;The information management processes
Even with full capability and competency within the six knowledge areas, it is argued that things can still go wrong. The problem lies in the migration of ideas and information management value from one area of competency to another. Summarising what Bytheway explains in some detail (and supported by selected secondary references):&lt;ref name="Bytheway3"&gt;Bytheway, A., 2015. ''Investing in Information: the Information Management Body of Knowledge'', Geneva: Springer,
 p31&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Projects''': Information technology is without value until it is engineered into information systems that meet the needs of the business by means of good [[project management]].&lt;ref name="Schwalbe"&gt;Schwalbe, K., 2013. ''Information technology project management'', Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Business change''': The best information systems succeed in delivering benefits through the achievement of change within the business systems, but people do not appreciate change that makes new demands upon their skills in the ways that new information systems often do. Contrary to common expectations, there is some evidence that the [[public sector]] has succeeded with information technology induced [[business change]].&lt;ref name="Scholl"&gt;Scholl, H.J., 2005. E-government-induced business process change (BPC): An empirical study of current practices. ''International Journal of Electronic Government Research'' (IJEGR), 1(2), pp.27–49&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Business operations''': With new systems in place, with [[business process]]es and [[business information]] improved, and with staff finally ready and able to work with new processes, then the business can get to work, even when new systems extend far beyond the boundaries of a single business.&lt;ref name="Seed"&gt;Saeed, K.A., Malhotra, M.K. &amp; Grover, V., 2005. Examining the Impact of Interorganizational Systems on Process Efficiency and Sourcing Leverage in Buyer–Supplier Dyads. ''Decision Sciences'', 36(3), pp.365–396&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Performance management''': [[Investment]]s are no longer solely about financial results, financial success must be balanced with internal efficiency, [[customer satisfaction]], and with [[organisational learning]] and development.&lt;ref name="Kaplan and Norton" /&gt;

===Summary===
There are always many ways to see a business, and the information management viewpoint is only one way. It is important to remember that other areas of business activity will also contribute to strategy – it is not only good information management that moves a business forwards. [[Corporate governance]], [[human resource management]], [[product development]] and [[marketing]] will all have an important role to play in strategic ways, and we must not see one domain of activity alone as the sole source of strategic success. On the other hand, corporate governance, human resource management, product development and marketing are all dependent on effective information management, and so in the final analysis our competency to manage information well, on the broad basis that is offered here, can be said to be predominant.

==Operationalising information management==

===Managing requisite change===
Organizations are often confronted with many information management challenges and issues at the [[operational level]], especially when [[organisational change]] is engendered. The novelty of new [[systems architecture]]s and a lack of experience with new styles of information management requires a level of organisational [[change management]] that is notoriously difficult to deliver. As a result of a general organisational reluctance to change, to enable new forms of information management, there might be (for example): a shortfall in the requisite resources, a failure to acknowledge new classes of information and the new procedures that use them, a lack of support from senior management leading to a loss of strategic vision, and even political manoeuvring that undermines the operation of the whole organisation.&lt;ref name="Knights and Murray"&gt;Knights, D. &amp; Murray, F., 1994. ''Managers Divided'', Chichester: John Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; However, the implementation of new forms of information management should normally lead to operational benefits.

===The early work of Galbraith===
In early work, taking an information processing view of organisation design, Jay [[Galbraith]] has identified five tactical areas to increase information processing capacity and reduce the need for information processing.&lt;ref name="Galbraith"&gt;Galbraith, J.R., 1977. ''Organization design'', Addison Wesley&lt;/ref&gt;

* Developing, implementing, and monitoring all aspects of the “environment” of an organization.
* Creation of slack resources so as to decrease the load on the overall [[hierarchy]] of resources and to reduce information processing relating to overload.
* Creation of self-contained tasks with defined boundaries and that can achieve proper closure, and with all the [[resource]]s at hand required to perform the task.
* Recognition of lateral relations that cut across functional units, so as to move decision power to the [[Business process|process]] instead of fragmenting it within the [[hierarchy]].
* Investment in vertical information systems that route [[information flow]]s for a specific task (or set of tasks) in accordance to the applied [[business logic]].

===The matrix organisation===
The lateral relations concept leads to an organizational form that is different from the simple hierarchy, the “[[matrix organization]]”.  This brings together the vertical (hierarchical) view of an organisation and the horizontal (product or project) view of the work that it does visible to the outside world. The creation of a matrix organization is one management response to a persistent fluidity of external demand, avoiding multifarious and spurious responses to episodic demands that tend to be dealt with individually.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note too the American spellings of '''integrated assessment modeling''' and '''integrated modeling'''.}} is a type of [[scientific modelling]] often used by the [[environmental sciences]] and [[environmental policy]] analysis. The modelling is '''integrated''' because environmental problems do not respect the borders between academic disciplines. Integrated assessment models therefore integrate knowledge from two or more domains into a single framework. Integrated modelling is referred to as '''assessment''' because the activity aims to generate useful information for policy making, rather than to advance knowledge for knowledge's sake. Integrated assessment modelling is that part of integrated assessment that relies on the use of numerical '''models'''.

Integrated assessment modelling has a long history, and scholars disagree on the first precedent. However, it became recognizable as a sub- or inter-discipline in the late 1980s with a focus on understanding and regulating [[acid rain|acidification]]. Integrated assessment modelling was further developed in the area of [[climate change]], inter alias in the context of the [[Energy Modeling Forum]].

Notable centres of integrated assessment modelling are [[IIASA]], [[MIT]], [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]], and [[International Futures]]. Notable scholars are [[Barry B. Hughes]], [[William Nordhaus|Bill Nordhaus]], [[Robert O. Mendelsohn|Robert Mendelsohn]], [[Richard G. Richels|Rich Richels]], [[Michael Schlesinger]], [[Stephen Schneider]], [[Richard Tol]], [[John Weyant]], and [[Gary Yohe]].

== Interpretation ==

While the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) relies heavily on integrated modeling, [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] lead author Thomas Bruckner cautions against overinterpreting the results from such modeling.&lt;ref name="bruckner-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  With regard to future technology choice, Bruckner observes that "The ''quantitative deployment'' of [[nuclear power]] or [[Carbon capture and storage|CCS]] technologies that has been found by the IPCC authors in the different mitigation scenarios, for instance, occasionally has been (mis)interpreted as an IPCC ''recommendation for their factual usage''."&lt;ref name="bruckner-2016"/&gt;{{rp|20}}{{nnbsp}}{{rp|at=emphasis per original}}  Bruckner continues "The scale of deployment of low-carbon technologies shown in [IPCC] diagrams{{nbsp}}... reveals neither the ''possible contribution'' of the respective energy technology to GHG mitigation nor the ''required contribution''.{{nbsp}}... The possible contribution (without considering costs) might be higher whereas the strictly required one could be lower.&lt;ref name="bruckner-2016"/&gt;{{rp|20}}

== Criticism ==

Economist [[Robert Pindyck]] argues that IAMs are problematic and "close to useless as tools for policy analysis". He argues that "IAM-based analyses of [[Climate change policy of the United States|climate policy]] create a perception of knowledge and precision that is illusory, and can fool policy-makers into thinking that the forecasts the models generate have some kind of scientific legitimacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Robert S. |last1=Pindyck |title=The Use and Misuse of Models for Climate Policy |journal=Review of Environmental Economics and Policy |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=2017 |pages=100–114 |doi=10.1093/reep/rew012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:IDI round table.jpg|thumb|250px|Round table discussion, Israel Democracy Institute]]
The Israel Democracy Institute was founded in 1991 by [[Arye Carmon]], the founding president, and Mr. [[Bernard Marcus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/business/business-opinion/.premium-1.653842 How Israel profits from the nonprofits] Haaretz, 28 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

IDI works to bolster the values and institutions of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. A non-partisan think-and-do tank,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/world/middleeast/israeli-cabinet-backs-nationality-bill-that-risks-wider-rift-with-arab-minority.html?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/08/world/africa/08iht-israel.4519509.html]&lt;/ref&gt; the institute harnesses rigorous applied research to influence policy, legislation and public opinion. The institute partners with government, policy and decision makers, civil service and society, to improve the functioning of the government and its institutions, confront [[security]] threats while preserving civil liberties, and foster solidarity within Israeli society. Israel recognized the positive impact of IDI's research and recommendations by conferring upon the institute its most prestigious award, the [[Israel Prize]] for Lifetime Achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/PrashTashsath/MachonIshraeliLedemokratya/NsMachonIshraeliLedemokratya.htm|title=נימוקי השופטים|website=cms.education.gov.il|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Yohanan Plesner]] was appointed president of the Institute. He replaced Arik Carmon, who left to concentrate on research after a 22-year term of service.

== Structure ==
The Israel Democracy Institute contains the following centers:

=== The Center for Democratic Values and Institutions ===
Engages with the core issues of Israeli democracy, and with the erosion in public commitment to substantive democracy and its values. The Center focuses on bolstering the commitment of public institutions and decision makers to the protection of human rights, to the principles of freedom and equality, and to the rule of law. The research and implementation work carried out at the Center concentrates on failures in implementing the principle of the separation of powers, and on maintaining the independence of the state's structural institutions, including the courts, the [[Knesset]], the government, regulatory bodies, the state prosecutor and the attorney general, local government, and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/centers/1155|title=Center for Democratic Values and Institutions|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Center for Religion, Nation and State ===
Addresses the question of how to balance the particularistic Jewish characteristics of the State of Israel (nationality and religion) with its liberal-democratic characteristics. The Center is also concerned with renewing the conceptual foundations of Jewish-democratic Zionism for our times, and with the internal and external challenges to the state's Jewish identity. The Center's researchers are also engaged in developing ways for Israel's [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] population to be integrated into the general Israeli economy and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/centers/1157|title=Center for Religion, Nation and State|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Center for Governance and the Economy ===
Promotes reforms to the political system, the civil service, and the labor market in Israel, with the aim of improving the functioning of these systems and increasing public trust in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/centers/1156|title=Center for Governance and the Economy|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Center for Security and Democracy ===
Maps the challenges for democratic societies posed by the fight against terror, and examines how a balance can be maintained between answering security needs and protecting human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/centers/1158|title=Center for Security and Democracy|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guttman Center for Public Opinion and Policy Research ===
An independent research center that has operated under the auspices of the Israel Democracy Institute since 1998, engaged in collecting, analyzing, and maintaining empirical data relating to Israeli society and politics. The Center's comprehensive [[Surveying|survey]] database contains data from more than a thousand public opinion surveys conducted since 1967 on a range of political, social, and media-related topics. The Center is headed by Prof. Tamar Hermann. Among the more noteworthy publications issued by the Guttman Center in recent years are: Religious? National!, a survey of attitudes and behaviors in the national-religious sector in Israel; the annual Israeli Democracy Index; and the monthly Peace Index produced in partnership with Tel-Aviv University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/centers/1159|title=The Guttman Center for Public Opinion and Policy Research|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

=== Eli Hurvitz Conference on Economy and Society (formerly the Caesarea Forum) ===
The Eli Hurvitz Conference on Economy and Society, run by the Israel Democracy Institute, is Israel's leading economic conference. Since 1993, the conference has served as the meeting place for public discourse and professional knowledge relating to economy and society in Israel. Its main goal is to improve decision-making processes in government, so as to ensure better social and economic policies that will benefit all Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/events/14059|title=Eli Hurvitz Conference on Economy and Society|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israeli Democracy Index ===
The Israeli Democracy Index provides an annual assessment of the quality of democracy in Israel. It is prepared on the basis of a large-scale survey conducted every year since 2004 with a representative sample of the Israeli population, comprising around 1,500 interviewees aged 18 and above. The survey is designed to identify trends in Israeli society on substantial issues relating to the fulfillment of democratic values and goals, and to the functioning of government systems and elected officials. The Index contains an analysis of the survey results, and aims to enrich public discourse on the state of democracy in Israel by giving access to a broad database of relevant information.

Alongside this general assessment, the Index also focuses each year on a particular topic connected to Israeli democracy. The subjects chosen so far include: opinions of Israeli youth (2004); the media in Israeli democracy (2005); tenth anniversary of the Rabin assassination (2005); political parties in Israel (2006); cohesion in a fractured society (2007); civil society in Israel (2008); twentieth anniversary of mass immigration from the Soviet Union (2009); democratic principles in Israel in practice (2010); the social protest, a year on (2012); civilian opinions on the socioeconomic situation (2014); the Rabin assassination, twenty years on (2015); and opinions in Haredi society (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/centers/1159/1519|title=Israeli Democracy Index|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outstanding Parliamentarian Award ===
The Institute's Outstanding Parliamentarian Award seeks to encourage high-quality parliamentary activity and to recognize those who perform it.

The award is given annually to two Knesset members, one from the governing coalition and one from the opposition, based on a comprehensive review of several fixed criteria used to determine good parliamentary performance. First, a database is created of the activity of all [[Knesset]] members (excluding ministers, deputy ministers, the Speaker of the Knesset, and the previous year's winners of the award) across a range of parameters: attendance at committee meetings, private legislation passed during that year's Knesset session, queries submitted, agenda item proposals debated in the plenum, brief and full-length speeches delivered at plenary sessions, commissioning of research studies from the Knesset Research and Information Center, and plenary attendance, as well as reprimands and punishments received from the Knesset Ethics Committee. Next, the award committee, chaired by retired Justice Theodore Orr, convenes to discuss the list of candidates, and selects the honorees based on the data provided as well as on additional criteria, such as the broader public influence and importance of the candidates’ parliamentary work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/events/16338|title=2017 Outstanding Parliamentarian Award|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Outstanding Parliamentarian Award helps improve both the quality of Knesset members’ work and the public perception of the Knesset as Israel's legislative body.

=== Political and Electoral Reform ===
The Forum for Political Reform in Israel was founded by [[Arik Carmon]], driven by “a sense of the need to launch processes that will bring about a significant change in the capabilities and functioning of the parliament in general, and in particular, of those who hold the levers of power,” as he described it. The forum was chaired by former Supreme Court President Meir Shamgar, and its members included academics, retired justices, leading public figures, and businesspeople.

The forum examined the expected impact of reforms to the electoral, governmental, and party-political systems proposed by the Israel Democracy Institute, and formulated practical proposals for legislation and public policy accordingly.

In 2015, the Israel Democracy Institute published an updated plan for political and electoral reform, proposing structural changes to the political system that would result in the formation of two major blocks of political parties providing clear alternatives for government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/publications/4222|title=Reforming Israel's Political System: A Plan for the Knesset|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Parliament'' online journal ===
Parliament is an online journal exploring topics related to governance, law, and society from both local and international perspectives. The first issue was published in print in 1993, and up until 2007 the journal contained articles on such subjects as elections in Israel and around the world, Israeli society, constitution and basic laws, religion and state, security and the armed forces, political participation, political parties, the European Union, and many others. In 2007, the format of the journal was changed so that each issue is dedicated to a single main topic. The journal was also taken online, and is no longer published in a print format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.idi.org.il/parliaments|title=כתב העת פרלמנט|website=www.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human Rights and Judaism Fellowship Program ===
This is a unique scholarship program for outstanding doctoral research students in the field of human rights and Judaism, which seeks to create an intellectual foundation for shaping the human rights discourse in a Jewish nation state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/centers/1157/1515|title=Human Rights and Judaism|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annual Statistical Report on Ultra-Orthodox Society in Israel ===
This is the first publication in Israel to provide a comprehensive anthology of existing quantitative data about Haredi society in Israel. It aims to provide a full and up-to-date picture of Haredi society based on statistical information and data analysis, covering a range of subject areas including demographics, education, welfare, standard of living, employment, voting patterns in Knesset elections, and lifestyles.

The Annual Statistical Report on Ultra-Orthodox Society in Israel is produced by a team of researchers from the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research and the Israel Democracy Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/haredi/2016/|title=Statistical Report on Ultra-Orthodox Society in Israel|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal opinions to the Ministerial Committee on Legislation ===
The Ministerial Committee on [[Legislation]] is one of Israel's most important ministerial committees. Chaired by the Minister of Justice, it meets weekly to decide the governing coalition's position on all proposed legislation, whether government-sponsored or private members’ bills.

Every week, the Israel Democracy Institute submits a legal opinion on the bills being discussed by the committee, which it also shares with relevant Knesset committees. The opinion is written based on the areas of research expertise of the Institute's research fellows.

=== ''Security Clearance'' blog ===
''Security Clearance'' is an online forum for analyzing issues relating to both national security and democracy. It aims to contribute to the public-academic debate on national security issues from a range of perspectives, including law, ethics, and social sciences.

The blog is edited by researchers at the Israel Democracy Institute, but is open to a diverse range of views, and to writers from a variety of fields related to national security who seek to participate in serious, open, and fruitful discussions. The views expressed on the blog are strictly those of the writers themselves, and do not represent the institutions or organizations to which they belong, or the views of the blog editors or the Israel Democracy Institute.

=== Elections and Political Parties ===
This comparative tool, developed by the Israel Democracy Institute, provides an overview of Israel's elections since the founding of the state, and of the political parties that participated in each. The information provided by party includes the parties’ political platform, main leaders, the number of votes and Knesset seats won at each election, and their representation in [[government]]. The information on elections includes a description of the major issues that formed the backdrop to each, and the political context in which they were held. Additionally, full lists of candidates are provided, including those parties that did not reach the electoral threshold.

=== Comparative International Perspective ===
This tool provides in-depth political information on 50 democratic countries, including Israel. This information includes basic data on each country (population, area, language), current leaders, system of government, electoral system, type of current government, and structure of legislative authority.

In addition, it allows users to view countries’ rankings according to a number of comparative indexes, such as freedom of the press, perception of corruption, percentage of female members of parliament, GINI inequality index, and more. Users can compare multiple countries on a particular index, or compare multiple index rankings for a particular country.

=== Constitution by Consensus ===
In 2001, the Israel Democracy Institute established the Constitution by Consensus public council, chaired by former Supreme Court President Meir Shamgar, with the aim of designing a constitution for Israel that would enjoy broad public support. The council had around 100 members, including ministers and Knesset members; secular, national religious, and Haredi Jews; Arabs; right-wingers and left-wingers; and academics, jurists, religious leaders, and public figures. Over the course of five years, this public council examined the diverse range of views relating to constitutional issues in Israel, and sought to formulate the agreements and compromises that would be necessary to create a consensual constitution. The council's discussions formed the basis and inspiration for the Israel Democracy Institute's proposal for a constitution by consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/publications/9127|title=Constitution by Consensus: A Constitution for the State of Israel|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Joseph Patrick McShane''' (March 17, 1909 - December 23, 1968) was the former chief [[United States Marshal]] during part of the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; 

==Biography==
He was born in 1909 in [[New York City]]. 

As head of the Executive Office for U.S. Marshals, he supervised federal agents during the [[Freedom Rides]] of 1961, but is most known for his role in leading the federal agents who escorted [[James Meredith]], the first African American student at [[University of Mississippi]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Personal Papers of James J.P.

In November of 1962 McShane was indicted by a Lafayette County Mississippi grand jury on charges that he "did incite a riot" in relation to his decision to fire tear gas into crowds of violent protesters during the [[Ole Miss riot of 1962]]. McShane subsequently gave himself up for arrest, was processed, and released. The US District Court found that McShane acted under orders and statutory authority and "had reasonable cause to believe ... that the use of tear gas ... was a proper measure to be taken". The court granted summary judgment in favor of McShane. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court | litigants=Petition of James P. McSHANE for a Writ of Habeas Corpus | court=United States District Court N. D. Mississippi, W. D | date=September 16, 1964 | url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1455034/in-re-mcshanes-petition/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before being a U.S. Marshal, he worked for the Senate's select [[United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management|McClellan Committee]], was chief of security and the personal bodyguard for President [[John F. Kennedy]] and a [[New York City Police Department]] homicide detective.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

He died on December 23, 1968, from pneumonia in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{Cite news | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = James McShane, Chief Marshal Who Escorted Meredith, Is Dead.

'''Jewish Autonomism''' was a non-[[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Jewish political movements|political movement]] that emerged in [[Eastern Europe]] in the late 19th and early 20th century. One of its major proponents was the historian and activist [[Simon Dubnow]], who also called his ideology [[Folkspartei|folkism]].

[[Image:SimonDubnow.jpg|thumb|150px|Simon Dubnow]]
The Autonomists believed that the future survival of the [[Jews]] as a [[nation]] depends on their spiritual and cultural strength, in developing "spiritual nationhood" and in viability of [[Jewish diaspora]] as long as Jewish communities maintain [[self-rule]], and rejected [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. Autonomists often stressed the vitality of modern [[Yiddish]] culture.

Various concepts of the Autonomism were adopted in the platforms of the [[Folkspartei]], the [[Sejmists]] and [[socialist]] Jewish parties such as the [[General Jewish Labor Union|Bund]].

Some groups blended Autonomism with [[Zionism]]: they favored Jewish self-rule in the diaspora until diaspora Jews make [[Aliyah]] to their national homeland in [[Zion]].

The movement's beliefs were similar to those of the [[Austromarxists]], who advocated [[national personal autonomy]] within the multinational [[Austro-Hungarian empire]], and [[cultural pluralism|cultural pluralists]] in America, such as [[Randolph Bourne]] and [[Horace Kallen]].

In 1941, Simon Dubnow was one of thousands of Jews murdered in the [[Rumbula massacre]]. After [[the Holocaust]], the notion of Autonomism practically disappeared from [[Jewish philosophy]].

It is not connected to the contemporary political movement [[autonomism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8105">[[File:Canute_rebukes_his_courtiers.png|thumb|  "Canute rebukes his courtiers" by [[Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville]]]]
The story of '''''King Canute and the tide''''' is an [[apocryphal]] anecdote illustrating the [[piety]] or [[humility]] of King [[Canute the Great]], recorded in the 12th century by  [[Henry of Huntingdon]].

In the story, Canute demonstrates to his flattering courtiers that he has no control over the elements (the incoming tide), explaining that secular power is vain compared to the [[omnipotence|supreme power]] of God.
The episode is frequently alluded to in contexts where the futility of "trying to stop the tide" of an inexorable event is pointed out, but usually misrepresenting Canute as believing he had supernatural powers, when Huntingdon's story in fact relates the opposite.

==The episode==
[[Henry of Huntingdon]] tells the story as one of three examples of Canute's "graceful and magnificent" behaviour (outside of his bravery in warfare),&lt;ref&gt;''Enimvero extra numerum bellorum, quibus maxime splenduit, tria gessit eleganter &amp; magnifice''&lt;/ref&gt; the other two being his arrangement of the marriage of [[Gunhilda of Denmark|his daughter]] to the later [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor]], and the negotiation of a reduction in tolls on the roads  [[Arelat|across Gaul]] to Rome at the [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor#Imperial coronation|imperial coronation]] of 1027.

In Huntingdon's account, Canute set his throne by the sea shore and commanded the [[tide|incoming tide]] to halt and not wet his feet and robes. Yet "continuing to rise as usual [the tide] dashed over his feet and legs without respect to his royal person. Then the king leapt backwards, saying: 'Let all men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings, for there is none worthy of the name, but He whom heaven, earth, and sea obey by eternal laws.{{'"}} He then hung his gold crown on a [[crucifix]], and never wore it again "to the honour of God the almighty King".&lt;ref name="Henry of Hntdn., ''The Chronicle'', p. 199"&gt;Henry of Huntingdon, ''The Chronicle'', p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later historians repeated the story, most of them adjusting it to have Canute more clearly aware that the tides would not obey him, and staging the scene to rebuke the flattery of his courtiers.
There are also earlier parallels in Celtic stories of men who commanded the tides, namely Saint [[Illtud]] of [[Glamorgan]], [[Maelgwn Gwynedd|Maelgwn]], king of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]], and Tuirbe, of Tuirbe's Strand in [[Brittany]].&lt;ref&gt;[[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]]: "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2797899 Cnut and the Waves]": ''Man'', Vol. 60, (January 1960), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proverbial reference==
Proverbial reference to the legend in modern journalism or politics usually casts the story in terms of "Canute's arrogance" of "attempting to stop the tide". 
It was cited, for example, by [[Stacy Head]] as typifying the [[New Orleans]] city council's response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] (2005), or by [[Mark Stephens (solicitor)|Mark Stephens]] in reference to [[Ryan Giggs]] as "the King Canute of football"  for his attempts of stopping "the unstoppable tide of information" on the internet in the [[2011 British privacy injunctions controversy]]. That is a misrepresentation of Huntingdon's account, whose Canute uses the tide to demonstrate his inability to control the elements and his deference to the greater authority of God.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13524677 Is King Canute misunderstood?] BBC news story&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodore Dalrymple]] refers to the story, without misattributing motives of arrogance to Canute, in the context of the [[international reaction to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|British reaction to the Ukraine crisis]] (2014), saying 
{{quote|Political power or office often gives those who possess it the illusion that they control events. That, after all, is the reason why the story of King Canute retains, and will always retain, its relevance to the current political situation.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Dalrymple, [http://www.salisburyreview.com/Theodore_Dalrymple/drone.html Droning over the Caucasus], The Salisbury Review, 4 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Warren Burger]], the [[Chief Justice of the United States]], mentions Canute in the 1980 decision ''[[Diamond v. Chakrabarty]]'' (447 U.S. 303), stating the denial of a patent for a micro-organism "is not likely to put an end to genetic research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/447/303.html |title=Diamond V. Chakrabarty &amp;#124; Findlaw |website=Caselaw.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burger likens doing so to Canute commanding the tides.

==Historicity and possible location==
The contemporary ''[[Encomium Emmae]]'' has no mention of the episode, which has been taken as indicating its ahistoricity, as it would seem that so pious a dedication might have been recorded there, since the same source gives an "eye-witness account of his lavish gifts to the monasteries and poor of [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]] when on the way to Rome, and of the tears and breast-beating which accompanied them".&lt;ref name="Lawson125"&gt;Lawson, M. K., ''Cnut – England's Viking King'', Stroud: Tempus (2nd ed. 2004), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Goscelin]], writing later in the 11th century, instead has Canute place his crown on a crucifix at Winchester one Easter, with no mention of the sea, and "with the explanation that the king of kings was more worthy of it than he". Nevertheless, there may be a "basis of fact, in a planned act of piety" behind this story.&lt;ref name="Lawson125"/&gt; 
On the other hand, [[Malcolm Godden]] says the story is simply "a 12th Century legend... and those 12th Century historians were always making up stories about kings from Anglo-Saxon times".&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

The site of the episode is often identified as [[Thorney Island (London)|Thorney Island]] (now known as [[Westminster]]), where Canute set up a royal palace during his reign over [[Anglo-Saxon London|London]].&lt;ref&gt;The Palace of Westminster Factsheet G11, General Series, Revised March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/estatehistory/the-middle-ages/anglosaxon-royal-palace/ Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.] Living Heritage. History of the Parliamentary Estate: Anglo-Saxon origins&lt;/ref&gt; 
Conflictingly, a sign on [[Southampton]] city centre's Canute Road reads, "Near this spot AD 1028 Canute reproved his courtiers".&lt;ref name=Archaeology&gt;{{cite web|title=Canute Castle Hotel |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/s-leisure/artsheritage/history/archaeology/archaeology-unit/sitesbyarea/bargate-ward/canute-castle.aspx |work=Archaeological Sites |publisher=Southampton City Council |accessdate=21 March 2012 |date=January 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428024210/http://www.southampton.gov.uk/s-leisure/artsheritage/history/archaeology/archaeology-unit/sitesbyarea/bargate-ward/canute-castle.aspx |archivedate=28 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Maps, Canute Road Southampton|url=http://g.co/maps/q97zq|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bosham]] in [[West Sussex]] also claims to be the site of this episode, as does [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] in [[Lincolnshire]]. As Gainsborough is inland, if the story is true then Canute would have been trying to turn back the [[tidal bore]] known as the [[Trent aegir|aegir]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4693">The '''law of specific nerve energies''', first proposed by [[Johannes Peter Müller]] in 1835, is that the nature of perception is defined by the pathway over which the sensory information is carried.  Hence, the origin of the sensation is not important. Therefore, the difference in perception of seeing, hearing, and touch are not caused by differences in the stimuli themselves but by the different nervous structures that these stimuli excite. For example, pressing on the [[human eye|eye]] elicits sensations of flashes of [[light]] because the [[neuron]]s in the [[retina]] send a signal to the [[occipital lobe]]. Despite the sensory input's being mechanical, the experience is visual.

==Quotation==

Here is Müller's statement of the law, from ''Handbuch der Physiologie des Menschen für Vorlesungen'', 2nd Ed., translated by Edwin Clarke and Charles Donald O'Malley:
::''The same cause, such as electricity, can simultaneously affect all sensory organs, since they are all sensitive to it; and yet, every sensory nerve reacts to it differently; one nerve perceives it as light, another hears its sound, another one smells it; another tastes the electricity, and another one feels it as pain and shock. One nerve perceives a luminous picture through mechanical irritation, another one hears it as buzzing, another one senses it as pain. . . He who feels compelled to consider the consequences of these facts cannot but realize that the specific sensibility of nerves for certain impressions is not enough, since all nerves are sensitive to the same cause but react to the same cause in different ways. . . (S)ensation is not the conduction of a quality or state of external bodies to consciousness, but the conduction of a quality or state of our nerves to consciousness, excited by an external cause.''

==Clarification==

As the above quotation shows, Müller's law seems to differ from the modern statement of the law in one key way. Müller attributed the [[quale|quality]] of an experience to some specific quality of the energy in the nerves. For example, the visual experience from light shining into the eye, or from a poke in the eye, arises from some special quality of the energy carried by [[optic nerve]], and the auditory experience from sound coming into the ear, or from electrical stimulation of the [[cochlea]], arises from some different, special quality of the energy carried by the [[auditory nerve]]. In 1912, [[Lord Edgar Douglas Adrian]] showed that all neurons carry the same energy, electrical energy in the form of [[action potential]]s. That means that the quality of an experience depends on the part of the brain to which nerves deliver their action potentials (e.g., light from nerves arriving at the [[visual cortex]] and sound from nerves arriving at the [[auditory cortex]]).

In 1945, [[Roger Sperry]] showed that it is the location in the brain to which nerves attach that determines experience. He studied [[amphibian]]s whose optic nerves cross completely, so that the left eye connects to the right side of the brain and the right eye connects to the left side of the brain. He was able to cut the optic nerves and cause them to regrow on the opposite side of the brain so that the left eye now connected to the left side of the brain and the right eye connected to the right side of the brain. He then showed that these animals made the opposite movements from the ones they would have made before the operation. For example, before the operation, the animal would move to the left to get away from a large object approaching from the right. After the operation, the animal would move to the right in response to the same large object approaching from the right. Sperry showed similar results in other animals including [[mammal]]s ([[rat]]s), this work contributing to his [[Nobel Prize]] in 1981.

In [[DC Comics]]' [[DC Universe]], a '''metahuman''' is a [[human]] with [[superpowers]]. The term is roughly synonymous with both ''[[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]'' and ''[[mutate (comics)|mutate]]'' in the [[Marvel Universe]] and ''[[posthuman]]'' in the [[Wildstorm]] and [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universes. In DC Comics, the term is used loosely in most instances to refer to any human-like being with extranormal powers and abilities, be they cosmic, mutant, science, mystic, skill or tech in nature. A significant portion of these are normal human beings born with a genetic variant called the "metagene",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burlingame|first1=Russ|title=The Flash: What are Metahumans?|url=http://comicbook.com/2014/10/04/the-flash-what-are-metahumans-/|website=Comicbook.com|accessdate=23 July 2016|language=en|date=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which causes them to gain powers and abilities during freak accidents or times of intense psychological distress.

The term as a referent to superheroes began in 1986 by author [[George R. R. Martin]], first in the ''[[Superworld]]'' role playing system, and then later in his ''[[Wild Cards]]'' series of novels.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==DC Comics==
{{main article|Invasion! (DC Comics)}}
The term was first used by a fictitious race of [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] known as the [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominators]] when they appeared in [[DC Comics]]' ''Invasion!'' mini-series. The Dominators use this term to refer to any human native of the planet [[Earth]] with "fictional superhuman abilities". The prefix "''meta-''" simply means "''beyond''", denoting persons and abilities beyond human limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/meta-|title=the definition of meta-|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metahuman may also relate to an individual who has exceeded what is known as "The Current Potential", meaning one's ability to move matter with mind. (See [[Telekinesis]]).

===''Xenobrood''===
{{main article|Xenobrood}}
Before the White Martians arrived on Earth, Lord Vimana, the Vimanian overlord from the Xenobrood mini-series, claimed credit for the creation of the human race both normal and metahuman, due to their introduction of superpowered alien genetic matter into human [[germline]] [[dna|DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=Xenobrood |issue=6 |date=April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vimanians in the series forced their super powered worker drones to mate with humanity's ancestors ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' (3 million years ago), and later ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (1.5 million years ago) in order to create a race of superpowered slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=Xenobrood |issue=3-4 |date=January–February 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Metagene===
The ''Invasion!'' mini-series provided a concept for why humans in the DC Universe would survive catastrophic events and develop superpowers. One of the Dominators discovered that select members of the human race had a "biological variant," which he called the meta-gene (also spelled "metagene"). This gene often lay dormant until an instant of extraordinary physical and emotional stress activates it. A "spontaneous chromosomal combustion" then takes place, as the metagene takes the source of the biostress – be it chemical, radioactive or whatever – and turns the potential catastrophe into a catalyst for "genetic change," resulting in metahuman abilities. It should also be noted that DC does not use the "metagene concept" as a solid editorial rule, and few writers explicitly reference the metagene when explaining a character's origin.

DC also has characters born with superhuman abilities, suggesting the metagene can activate spontaneously and without any prior appearance in the ancestry. One well-known example involves Dinah Laurel Lance, the second [[Black Canary]]. Although her mother (Dinah Drake Lance, the original Black Canary) was a superhero, neither she nor her husband Larry Lance were born with any known metagenes. However, Dinah Laurel ''was'' born with a metagene, the infamous ultrasonic scream known as the Canary Cry.

The prefix ''[[meta]]-'', in this context, simply means "beyond"&amp;mdash;as in ''[[metastable]]'', which is beyond regular stability and ready to collapse at the slightest disruption, or ''[[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]'', which is the state of going beyond a single shape. In the DC comic mini-series ''Invasion!'', the Dominators point out that the Meta-gene is contained inside every cell of the human body.

In the DC Comics universe, metahuman criminals are incarcerated in special metahuman prisons, like the prison built on Alcatraz Island, which is outfitted not only with provisions to hold criminals whose powers are [[science]] and [[technology]]-based, but even mystical dampeners to hold villains (including ''[[Homo Magi|Homo magi]]'') whose powers are [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] based. Prisoners in this facility are tagged with nanobyte tracers injected into their [[bloodstream]] that allow them to be located wherever they are.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' #12 (July 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for individuals skilled in science and biology to manipulate, dampen or modify the activities of the metagene. During the [[Final Crisis]] while the Dominators were devised a ''Gene Bomb'' able to accelerate the metagene activity to the point of cellular and physical instabilities, an ''anti-metagene virus'' was spread as a last-ditch weapon in the invaded [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] quarters. This ''metavirus'' has the opposite effects of the Gene Bomb, curbing and shutting down the metagene and stripping the metahumans of their powers for an unspecified amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis: Resist'' Oneshot (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===White Martians===
{{main article|White Martian}}
The genetic potential for a future metagene was discovered in ancient [[Archaic humans|Homo sapien's]] DNA (500,000 - 250,000 years ago) by the White Martian race. The White Martians performed experiments on these primitive humans, changing how the metahuman [[phenotype]] was [[Gene expression|expressed]] by the metagene.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA'' #4 (April 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Martian Manhunter'' (vol. 2) #25-27 (December 2000-February 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vulcan"&gt;''Son of Vulcan'' (vol.) 2 #5 (December 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their experiments, they altered the destiny of the human race. Whereas before, evolution would have eventually made mankind into a race of superhumans similar to the [[Daxamites]] and [[Kryptonians]], now only a select few humans would develop metahuman powers. As punishment for this, the group of renegades known as the '''[[Hyperclan]]''' was exiled to the ''Still Zone'', a version of the [[Phantom Zone]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Metavirus===
The White Martians also created a metavirus, a metagene that could be passed from host to host via touch. This metavirus was responsible for the empowerment of the very first [[Vulcan (DC Comics)|Son of Vulcan]]. From that time onwards, the Sons of Vulcan passed the metavirus down in an unbroken line, sworn to hunt and kill White Martians.&lt;ref name="vulcan"/&gt;

===Population===
The terms "meta" and "metahuman" do not refer only to humans born with biological variants. [[Superman]] and [[Martian Manhunter]] (aliens) as well as [[Wonder Woman]] (a near-goddess) and [[Aquaman]] (an [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]]) are referred to in many instances as "metahumans." It can refer to anyone with extraordinary powers, no matter the origins and including those not born with such power. According to ''[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'', roughly 1.3 million metahumans live on Earth, 99.5% of whom are considered "nuisance-level" (such as kids who can bend spoons with their mind and the old lady "who keeps hitting at [[Powerball]]"). The other 0.5% are what [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] and the [[One-Man Army Corps|OMACs]] consider alpha, beta and gamma level threats. For example, [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] are categorized as alpha level, while [[Metamorpho]] is considered a beta level and [[Ratcatcher (comics)|Ratcatcher]] is considered a gamma level.

===Exo-gene===
The ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' mini-series introduced a toxic mutagen called the Exo-gene (also referred to as the Exogene). It is a toxic [[gene therapy]] treatment created by [[LexCorp]] for the [[Everyman Project]] which creates metahuman abilities in compatible non-metahumans. It first appeared in ''52'' #4 with the first announcement of the Everyman Project in ''52'' #8. The project was controversial, creating unstable heroes that gave Luthor an "off switch" for their powers, creating countless mid-flight deaths.

===Amalgam===
In the short-lived DC/[[Marvel Comics]] crossover "[[Amalgam Comics]]" event, in the ''JLX'' series (combining ''[[Justice League]]'' and Marvel's ''[[X-Men]]''), metahumans are replaced with metamutants (a portmanteau of metahumans and Marvel's [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]) who are said to carry a 'metamutant gene'.

==Television==

===DC animated universe===
In [[DC animated universe|animated versions of the DC universe]], the term metahuman is used in the animated series ''[[Static Shock]]''.

===''Birds of Prey''===
On the television series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'', metahumans included heroines [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]] and [[Black Canary|Dinah Lance]]. New Gotham has a thriving metahuman underground, mostly made of metahumans who are trying to live their own lives, although a self-hating metahuman, Claude Morton ([[Joe Flanigan]]), tries to convince the police that all metahumans are evil. In ''Birds of Prey'', metahumans are treated seemingly as a race or species; the Huntress is described as being "half-metahuman" on her mother's side.

===''Smallville''===
On the television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', metahumans can occur naturally. However, the majority are the result of exposure to [[Kryptonite in Smallville|kryptonite]], which in the ''Smallville'' universe can turn people into superpowered "'''meteor freaks'''", often with psychotic side effects. For many seasons of ''Smallville'', all superpowered people other than Kryptonians were so-called meteor freaks, but as the show went on it began to explore further corners of the DC universe. Non-kryptonite metahumans include the ''Smallville'' versions of [[Aquaman]], [[Bart Allen|the Flash]], [[Black Canary]], and [[Zatanna]].

===''Young Justice''===
On the animated series ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', the alien antagonists known as the Kroloteans have frequently used the term and have even researched into the discovery of a "metagene" by abducting and testing on random humans. The alien [[Reach (comics)|reach]] conduct similar experiments and kidnap a cadre of teen runaways to test for the metagene, leading several of these individuals to develop superpowers. In the episode "Runaways," a [[STAR Labs|S.T.A.R. Labs]] scientist surmises that the gene is "opportunistic" in as much as it causes its user to develop powers seemingly based on their personal experiences or surroundings.

===Arrowverse===
In the [[Arrowverse]] family of live-action shows, "metahuman" is used more narrowly than in comics, typically referring to a human being who has powers, often acquired following some kind of accident.
* In the 2014 television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', Dr. [[Harrison Wells]] and his team at Scientific and Technological Advanced Research Laboratories (S.T.A.R. Labs) developed an advanced particle accelerator in Central City. When it was activated, the device went critical and exploded, releasing a variety of theoretical elements such as dark matter and negative energy. Many Central City residents who were affected by the blast wave were genetically altered by the dark matter, granting them superhuman abilities. People with such abilities are called "metahumans," coined by Wells and his staff. The nature of a metahuman's powers appear to be a result of an external element that they were near or exposed to when hit by the blast. Eventually, under Harrison Wells and Cisco Ramon, S.T.A.R. Labs develops effective metahuman-power dampening technology and prison to confine metahumans. Over the course of the series, many more metahuman villains appear, including some from alternate universes or timelines and others who have no connection to the particle accelerator accident. In season three, S.T.A.R. Labs uses metahuman-detecting [[application software|apps]] to alert the Flash's team to attacks; this technology is later used by city police and government agencies. In season five, Team Flash discovers meta-technology has created following their battle with the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]], resulting that any dark matter-powered device such as a [[smartphone]] can be used by anyone to utilize the power of a metahuman. 
* After ''The Flash'' established the existence of metahumans, its sister series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' began to feature them, beginning with the arrival of metahuman villain [[Deathbolt]] in Starling City (later changed to Star City); the team learns that Deathbolt's powers were not derived from the particle accelerator blast, revealing the existence of metahumans from other means, including S.T.A.R. Labs' scientist [[Killer Frost#Arrowverse|Caitlin Snow (Killer Frost)]], who is already a metahuman since childhood long before her dark matter exposure. Later on, the metahuman [[List of Flash enemies|Double Down]] arrives in Star City to kill the [[Oliver Queen (Arrow)|Green Arrow]] and his teammates under the employment of the mystic [[Damien Darhk]], though he fails to do so. Magical characters such as Darhk, [[John Constantine|Constantine]], and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] recur in subsequent episodes, as well as occasional metahuman threats. 
* ''Arrow'' and ''Flash'' spin-off ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' features numerous metahumans, including [[Hawkman]], [[Hawkgirl]], and [[Vandal Savage]] (introduced in [[Heroes Join Forces|an ''Arrow''/''Flash'' crossover]]), as well as characters from other Arrowverse shows. Later seasons introduce versions of Vixen, [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], and [[Commander_Steel#Nathan_Heywood|Steel]]. 
* The television series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' is set in a parallel universe to [[Arrowverse|that of ''Arrow'', ''The Flash'', and ''Legends of Tomorrow'']], in which a variant of Earth where [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] resides is later coined as Earth-38 by [[Vibe (comics)|Cisco Ramon]]. Humanity is aware of superpowered [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] such as Supergirl, her cousin [[Superman]], and [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]], but the existence of metahumans is not widely known on Earth-38 until the first season's episode "[[Worlds Finest]]," a crossover with ''The Flash''. In this episode, the [[Silver Banshee]] and [[Livewire (DC Comics)|Livewire]] publicly battle Supergirl and the Flash, revealing the case of human-derived beings with uncanny abilities in the process. Silver Banshee's powers are mystical in origin and nature, while Livewire's are from an anomalous mutagenic accident. Since the inhabitants of Supergirl's Earth have no experience with metahuman threats, the Flash provides [[National City (DC Comics)|National City]]'s authorities with the means to combat and contain them before returning to his universe. Later, in season two's episode "[[We Can Be Heroes (Supergirl)|We Can Be Heroes]]", shows that a prison facility at National City is using the Flash's world's (Earth-1) metahuman-power dampeners to restrain its superhuman prisoners; the technology is later used by [[Department of Extranormal Operations]] (DEO) and eventually they align with Earth-1's S.T.A.R. Labs. Human criminals begin experimenting on metahumans in hopes of acquiring powers for themselves, of which three metahumans were created with Livewire's powers. In season three, more metahumans begin to appear, including [[Psi (comics)|Psi]], whose powers surface following her maturity.

===''Gotham''===
In the television series ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', Professor Hugo Strange experiments with dead (and alive) bodies of criminals, Arkham Asylum patients, and civilians under the orders of the Court of Owls. There, Strange gives his victims superhuman abilities such as shapeshifting ([[Clayface]]), mind control (Fish Mooney) and super strength ([[Azrael (DC Comics)|Azrael]]). By the end of Season 2, Strange's victims escape and wreak havoc over the city. Throughout the series, the metahumans are commonly referred to as Strange's Monsters, simply Monsters (an allusion to Batman &amp; the Monster Men), or the Freaks from Indian Hill.

===''Black Lightning''===
In the television series ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'', [[Black Lightning|Jefferson Pierce / Black Lightning]] and his daughters [[Thunder (comics)|Anissa]] and [[Lightning (DC Comics)|Jennifer]] are metahumans. The A.S.A. are tracking young metahumans with abilities. As the series progresses, it is revealed that decades ago, because of the city of Freeland's prevailing racial and political conflicts, the A.S.A. developed a substance supposedly as a suppressant to turn its citizens docile in the interest of controlling them but failed. Instead, it turned out to be a [[mutagen]] which transforms some of its citizens into metahumans, including Jefferson Pierce and his daughters who inherited his metagene after his fatherhood. Under Martin Procter, the agency illegally developed an addictive derivative of the drug called Green Light, which is distributed as a [[Recreational drug use|recreational drug]] in hopes to create more metahumans for Procter's agendas. Because the metahumans are dying from unstable mutations, Procter seeks to capture Black Lightning and his offspring because they are the only known stable specimens of the agency's drug. After Procter's death, the A.S.A.'s experiments are exposed and Freeland's metahumans' origin has become a public knowledge. However, it ignites an anti-metahuman bigotry amongst the people in Freeland.

==Film==

===DC Extended Universe===
*In ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', Lex Luthor is stated to be a supporter of the "metahuman thesis." Secretly, he is already conducting studies on them, with particular interest on Wonder Woman, the Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg, all of whom he classifies as metahumans.
*Also, metahumans appear in the movie ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' as Amanda Waller talks about their abilities when forming the squad. El Diablo, Killer Croc and Enchantress appear in the film.

'''Milton Diamond''' (born March 6, 1934 in [[New York City]]&lt;ref name=sab&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/Entrance_Page/About_Us/Advisory_Board/advisory_board.htm#DIA | publisher= Archive for Sexology | title= Scientific Advisory Board | accessdate= September 16, 2009 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090830062533/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/Entrance_Page/About_Us/Advisory_Board/advisory_board.htm#DIA | archivedate= August 30, 2009 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Professor Emeritus]]&lt;ref name=emer&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hawaii.edu/offices/bor/regular/notice/201409250900.regular.pdf | publisher= University of Hawaii | title= Board of Regents' Meeting, Thursday, September 25, 2014 | accessdate = February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[anatomy]] and [[reproductive biology]] at the [[University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa]]. After a career in the study of [[human sexuality]], Diamond retired from the University in December 2009 but continues with his research and writing.

==Early career==
Milton Diamond graduated from the [[City College of New York]] with a [[B.S.]] in [[biophysics]] in 1955,&lt;ref name=sab /&gt; after which he spent three years in the [[United States Army|Army]] as an engineering officer, stationed in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=ca /&gt; On returning to the United States, he attended graduate school at [[University of Kansas]] from 1958–1962 and earned a [[Ph.D.]] in anatomy and [[psychology]] from that University.&lt;ref name=ca&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.changelingaspects.com/Technical/Prof%20M%20Diamond-bio.htm | publisher= Changeling Aspects | title= An Introduction to Professor Milton Diamond Ph.D. | accessdate = September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first job was teaching at the [[University of Louisville]], School of Medicine where he simultaneously completed two years toward an [[M.D.]], passing his Basic Medicine Boards,&lt;ref name=sab /&gt; and in 1967 he moved to [[Hawaii]] to take up a post at the recently established John A. Burns School of Medicine. Milton Diamond had a long running feud with the psychologist Dr. [[John Money]]. In the early seventies, Diamond and Money were attending a conference on transgenderism in [[Dubrovnik]]. According to the book ''As Nature Made Him: The Boy Raised As a Girl'' (p.&amp;nbsp;174)&lt;ref name="Colapintobook"&gt;Colapinto, John (2000). ''As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised As a Girl.'' HarperCollins. {{ISBN|0-06-092959-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; at this conference Money initiated a loud and aggressive argument with Diamond. One witness claims that Money punched Diamond; however, Diamond himself said that he could not recall any physical contact during this encounter.

==David Reimer==
Diamond is known for following up the case of [[David Reimer]], a boy raised as a girl after a botched [[circumcision]]. This case, which Diamond renamed that of "John/Joan" to protect Reimer’s privacy, has become one of the most cited cases in the literature of [[psychiatry]], [[anthropology]], [[women's studies]], [[child development]], and [[biology of gender]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} With the cooperation of H. Keith Sigmundson, who had been Reimer’s supervising psychiatrist, Diamond tracked down the adult Reimer and found that [[John Money]]’s sex reassignment of Reimer had failed. Diamond was the first to alert physicians that the model of how to treat infants with [[intersex]] conditions that Reimer's case proposed was faulty.&lt;ref name="si"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/1961to1999/1982-sexual-identity.html | publisher= Milton Diamond, Ph.D | title= Sexual Identity, Monozygotic Twins Reared in Discordant Sex Roles and a BBC Follow-Up | accessdate = August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Diamond recommended&lt;ref name="moi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Milton|author2=Sigmundson, H. Keith|title=Management of intersexuality. Guidelines for dealing with persons with ambiguous genitalia.|journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med|date=October 1997|volume=151|issue=10|pages=1046–50|doi=10.1001/archpedi.1997.02170470080015|pmid=9343018|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/1961to1999/1997-management-of-intersexuality.html|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that physicians do no surgery on intersexed infants without their informed consent, assign such infants in the gender to which they will probably best adjust, and refrain from adding shame, stigma and secrecy to the issue, by assisting intersexual people to meet and associate with others of like condition. Diamond similarly encouraged considering the intersex condition as a difference of sex development, not as a [[Disorders of sex development|disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diamond |first1=Milton |last2=Beh |first2=Hazel. |year=2008 |title=Changes In Management Of Children With Differences Of Sex Development. |journal=Nature Clinical Practice Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current work, appointments and awards==
Diamond has written extensively about [[abortion]] and [[family planning]], [[pornography]], [[intersexuality]], [[transsexuality]], and other [[sex]]- and [[reproduction]]-related issues for professional sex and legal journals, as well as lay periodicals. He is frequently interviewed for public media and legal matters, and often serves as an expert in court proceedings, and is known for his research on the origins and development of [[sexual identity]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Although he has retired from teaching, he continues to research and consult concerning transsexuality, intersexuality and pornography.

===Appointments===
Diamond was based at the John A. Burns School of Medicine at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, from 1967.&lt;ref name=ca /&gt; He was appointed Professor of Anatomy and Reproductive Biology in 1971, and from 1985 until his retirement he was Director of the Pacific Center for Sex and Society&lt;ref name=ca /&gt; within the School of Medicine.

In 1999 Diamond was appointed as President of the [[International Academy of Sex Research]],&lt;ref name=iasr&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.iasr.org/node/1 | publisher= International Academy of Sex Research | title= Meeting History | accessdate= September 15, 2009 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://archive.is/20090330172938/http://www.iasr.org/node/1 | archivedate= March 30, 2009 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2001/02 as President of the [[Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality]].&lt;ref name=sss&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.sexscience.org/about/index.php?category_id=1182 | publisher= The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality | title= Society Presidents | accessdate= September 15, 2009 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091115181404/http://www.sexscience.org/about/index.php?category_id=1182 | archivedate= November 15, 2009 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mircea Florian''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈmirt͡ʃe̯a floriˈan|lang}}; April 1, 1888 – October 31, 1960) was a [[Romania]]n philosopher and translator. Active mainly during the [[interwar period]], he was noted as one of the leading proponents of [[rationalism]], opposing it to the ''[[Trăirism|Trăirist]]'' philosophy of [[Nae Ionescu]]. His work, comprising some 20 books, shows Florian as a disciple of [[Centrism|centrists]] and rationalists such as [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]] and [[Titu Maiorescu]].

Active in independent [[Social democracy|social democratic]] politics, the philosopher became a political prisoner under the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]]. It was during his time in jail that Florian conceived his philosophical system, published after his death in the treatise ''Recesivitatea ca structură a lumii'' ("Recessivity as World Structure"). In 1990, he was made a posthumous [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Bucharest]], Florian graduated from the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy at the [[University of Bucharest|local university]], where he became a disciple of Rădulescu-Motru and [[P. P. Negulescu]].&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"&gt;{{ro icon}} Oana-Georgiana Enăchescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/mircea_florian_-_nedreptatea_unui_destin "Mircea Florian - nedreptatea unui destin"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 13/2002&lt;/ref&gt; He afterward took his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Greifswald]], in the [[German Empire]], with a thesis on [[Henri Bergson]]'s notion of time.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt; In later years, he found employment as a Bucharest University assistant and substitute professor, lecturing in the History of Philosophy. He was a [[Docent]] from 1916.&lt;ref name="lb(10)350"&gt;Boia (2010), p.350&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], Florian served in the [[Romanian Land Forces]] and was taken prisoner by the [[German Empire|Germans]]. He was transported to an internment camp at [[Krefeld]], alongside figures such as [[Alexandru D. Strurdza]] and [[Ilie Moscovici]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin C. Gomboș, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/insemnari-prizonieratul-german "Însemnări din prizonieratul german"], in ''Historia'', May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Florian was freed by his captors and allowed to lecture at [[Fundațiile Regale|King Carol Foundation]] in Bucharest, under a [[Romania in World War I|German occupation government]]. As Florian later indicated, this was made possible by the intercession of a [[Germanophile]] scholar, [[Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș]], who vouched for him, and by the protection of [[Constantin Giurescu]].&lt;ref name="lb(10)350"/&gt; Following the [[First Armistice at Compiègne|November Armistice]], which reinstated the pro-[[Allies of World War I|Allied]] government, Florian, Tzigara-Samurcaș and Rădulescu-Motru were all subject to an official inquiry, and accused of being [[Collaborationism|collaborators]]. The University Commissions created for this task were largely ineffective, and, among the incriminated, Florian was one of few who presented himself for questioning.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2010), p.347-356&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the war, Florian was in contact with ''[[Ideea Europeană]]'', Rădulescu-Motru's magazine, and went on its conference tour, alongside in various cities by, among others, Nae Ionescu, [[Cora Irineu]], [[Octav Onicescu]], [[Virgil Bărbat]], and [[Emanoil Bucuța]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/memoriile_unui_hedonist "Memoriile unui hedonist"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 41/2000&lt;/ref&gt; However, in later years, he remained largely cut off from his public: said to have been shy in delivering his lectures, he led a private life, and dedicated himself, almost entirely, to research.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt;

He wrote a large body of works over a short time, including such titles as: ''Îndrumare în filosofie'' ("Philosophical Companion"), ''Rostul și utilitatea filosofiei'' ("The Purpose and Use of Philosophy"), ''Știință și raționalism'' ("Science and Rationalism"), ''Cosmologia elenă'' ("Hellenic Cosmology"), ''Antinomiile credinței'' ("The [[Antinomy|Antinomies]] of Faith"), ''Kant și criticismul până la Fichte'' ("[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the Critical Method before [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]]"), ''Cunoaștere și existență'' ("Knowledge and Being"), ''Reconstrucție filosofică'' ("Philosophical Reconstruction"), ''Metafizică și artă'' ("Metaphysics and Art"), ''Misticism și credință'' ("Mysticism and Faith").&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt; Although absorbed by his academic work, Florian affiliated with social democracy, and was a member of the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927-1948)|Social Democratic Party]], the [[Constantin Titel Petrescu]] wing.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt;

Florian's philosophy developed from ideas common to both Rădulescu-Motru and the 19th-century thinker [[Titu Maiorescu]], herald of Romania's moderate and critical approach to philosophy. Florian is therefore ranked among the third-generation "Maiorescans", and seen as reactivating the spirit of Maiorescu's literary club ''[[Junimea]]''.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zopasionanta"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/o_pasionant_carte_de_filosofie "O pasionantă carte de filosofie"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 17/1999&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War I]], the ''Junimist'' legacy came in direct contradiction with Nae Ionescu's critique of rationalism, which was growing in popularity and lending its support to the [[far right]]'s causes.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt; Florian's steady opposition to Ionescu, in both concept and method, has been described as the "dualism" of interwar [[Romanian philosophy]].&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt;

By the time of [[World War II]], Mircea Florian was still pursuing a debate with the two schools of irrationalism, promoted by [[Lucian Blaga]] and [[Constantin Noica]]. Granted a full professorship in 1940, he was presented for Romanian Academy membership by his mentor Rădulescu-Motru, but the proposal failed to gather support.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt; Blaga gave poor reviews to his work in ''Saeculum'' magazine, and, in one (disputed) interpretation, may have portrayed him as the unknown adversary in the virulent lampoon ''Săpunul filozofic'' ("Philosophic Soap", 1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Florian Roatiș, [http://www.romlit.ro/despre_polemica_blaga-motru "Despre polemica Blaga-Motru"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 4/2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian [[Z. Ornea]], Florian's relative lack of exposure is unfair, since his works may rank better than those of either Noica or Blaga.&lt;ref name="zopasionanta"/&gt; Florian was also an adversary of official [[fascism]], before and during the [[Ion Antonescu]] dictatorship. Like [[Grigore T. Popa]], [[Constantin I. Parhon]], [[Alexandru Rosetti]], [[Mihai Ralea]], and several other academics, he was in contact with the underground [[Romanian Communist Party]] and the [[Union of Patriots (Romania)|Union of Patriots]], and, as such, kept under close surveillance by the ''[[Siguranța Statului]]'' agents.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2012), p.236-237&lt;/ref&gt;

Florian's stance, and especially his commitment to independent social democracy, made him a suspect upon the establishment of Romania's communist regime. As noted by researcher Victor Frunză, Florian and [[Alexandru Claudian]] made a "high sacrifice" when they refused to give in to "blackmail" and would not join the "Workers' Party" (as the Communist Party styled itself upon its absorption of Social Democratic sympathizers).&lt;ref&gt;Victor Frunză, ''Istoria stalinismului în România'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 1990, p.274.  {{ISBN|973-28-0177-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, he was stripped of his university chair.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2012), p.302&lt;/ref&gt; Placed under constant surveillance by the [[Securitate]], Romania's new secret police, he was soon after arrested. During his eight-month-long imprisonment without trial, he had the revelation on "recessivity as world structure".&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt; The new system evidenced that Florian had come to criticize some of the basic assumptions in [[Western philosophy]], and conceiving of the world through the teachings of [[genetics]].&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt; His system divided existence alongside its two, equal but alternating, attributes: the [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] trait tempered by the recessive (albeit not degraded) one; violence to love, rational to irrational, [[nationalism]] to [[supranationalism]].&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt;

The imprisonment is said to have been a grueling experience: allegedly, his wife Angela no longer recognized him upon his return to the family home.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt; A while after, Florian was partly reintegrated into academia, and assigned a researcher's position at the Institute of Philosophy. There, he dedicated himself to translating [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Organon]]'', while in committing his ''Recesivitatea'' to paper in his spare time.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt;

''Recesivitatea'' was only published 23 years after Florian's death, with [[Editura Eminescu]]. Reportedly, the text had suffered cuts and interventions by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censors]].&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt; Florian's role was reconsidered mainly after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], when he was made a posthumous member of the Academy.&lt;ref name="ogenedrept"/&gt; His full work was recovered for the public and reviewed by philosopher [[Mircea Flonta]], in a 1998 volume of essays.&lt;ref name="zopasionanta"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12184">'''Natural scene perception''' refers to the process by which an agent (such as a human being) visually takes in and interprets [[Scene (perception)|scenes]] that it typically encounters in natural modes of operation (e.g. busy streets, meadows, living rooms).&lt;ref&gt;Geisler, W.S., Perry, J.S. and Ing, A.D. (2008) Natural systems analysis. In: B. Rogowitz and T. Pappas (Eds.), Human Vision and Electronic Imaging. Proceedings SPIE, Vol 6806, 68060M&lt;/ref&gt;  This process has been modeled in several different ways that are guided by different concepts.

== Debate over role of attention ==

One major dividing line between theories that explain natural scene perception is the role of [[attention]]. Some theories maintain the need for focused attention, while others claim that focused attention is not involved.

Focused attention played a partial role in early models of natural scene perception. Such models involved two stages of visual processing.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, K. &amp; Treisman, A. (2005). Perception of Objects in Natural Scenes: Is it really attention free? ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 31(6)'', 1476-1492.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to these models, the first stage is attention free and registers low level features such as [[brightness]] gradients, [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and orientation in a parallel manner. Meanwhile, the second stage requires focused attention. It registers high-level object descriptions, has limited capacity and operates serially. These models have been empirically informed by studies demonstrating [[change blindness]], [[inattentional blindness]] and [[attentional blink]]. Such studies show that when one's visual focused attention is engaged by a task, significant changes in one's environment that are not directly pertinent to the task can escape awareness. It was generally thought that natural scene perception was similarly susceptible to change blindness, inattentional blindness and attentional blink, and that these psychological phenomena occurred because engaging in a task diverts attentional resources that would otherwise be used for natural scene perception.  

=== Evidence against the need for focused attention ===

The attention-free hypothesis soon emerged to challenge early models. The initial basis for the attention-free hypothesis was the finding that in [[visual search]], basic visual features of objects immediately and automatically pop out to the person doing the visual search.&lt;ref name="See"&gt;See 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Further experiments seemed to support this: Potter (as cited by Evans &amp; Treisman, 2005) showed that high-order [[Representation (psychology)|representations]] can be accessed rapidly from natural scenes presented at rates of up to 10 per second. Additionally, Thorpe, Fize &amp; Marlot (as cited by Evans &amp; Treisman) discovered that humans and primates can categorize natural images (i.e. of animals in everyday indoor and outdoor scenes) rapidly and accurately even after brief exposures.&lt;ref name="See" /&gt;  The basic idea in these studies is that exposure to each individual scene is too brief for attentional processes to occur, yet human beings are able to interpret and categorize these scenes.

Weaker versions of the attention-free hypothesis have also been targeted at specific components of the natural scene perception process instead of the process as a whole. Kihara &amp; Takeda (2012) limit their claim to saying that it is the integration of [[Spatial frequency|spatial frequency-based information]] in natural scenes (a sub-process of natural scene perception) that is attention free.&lt;ref&gt;Kihara, K. &amp; Takeda, Y. (2012). Attention-free integration of spatial frequency-based information in natural scenes. ''Vision Research, 65,'' 38-44.&lt;/ref&gt; This claim is based on a study of theirs which used attention-demanding tasks to examine participants' abilities to accurately categorize images that were [[Image filter|filtered]] to have a wide range of spatial frequencies. The logic behind this experiment was that if integration of visual information across spatial frequencies (measured by the categorization task) is preattentive, then attention-demanding tasks should not affect performance in the categorization task. This was indeed found to be the case. 

=== More recent evidence reasserting the need for focused attention ===

A recent study by Cohen, Alvarez &amp; Nakayama (2011) calls into question the validity of evidence supporting the attention-free hypothesis. They found that participants did display inattentional blindness while doing certain kinds of multiple-object tracking (MOT) and [[rapid serial visual presentation]] (RSVP) tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, M.A., Alvarez, G.A., &amp; Nakayama, K. (2011). Natural-scene perception requires attention. ''Psychological Science, 22(9),'' 1165-1172.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Cohen et al. found that participants' natural scene perception was impaired under dual-task conditions, but that this [[Dual-task paradigm|dual-task]] impairment happened only when participants' primary task was sufficiently demanding. The authors concluded that previous studies showing the absence of a need for focused attention did not use tasks that were demanding enough to fully engage attention.

In the Cohen et al. study, the MOT task involved viewing eight black moving discs presented against a changing background that consisted of randomly colored checkerboard masks. Four of these discs were picked out and participants were instructed to track these four discs. The RSVP task involved viewing a stream of letters and digits presented against a series of changing checkerboards, and counting the number of times a digit was presented. In both experiments, the critical trial involved a natural scene suddenly replacing the second last checkerboard, and participants were immediately afterwards asked whether they had noticed anything different, as well as presented with six questions to determine whether they had categorized the scene. The dual-task condition simply involved participants performing the MOT task mentioned above and a scene-classification task simultaneously. The authors varied the difficulty of the task (i.e. how demanding the task was) by increasing or decreasing the speed of the moving discs.

== Models ==

These are some of the models that have been proposed for the purpose of explaining natural scene perception.

=== Evans' &amp; Treisman's hypothesis ===

Evans &amp; Treisman (2005) proposed a hypothesis that humans rapidly detect disjunctive sets of unbound features of target categories in a [[Parallel processing (psychology)|parallel]] manner, and then use these features to discriminate between scenes that do or do not contain the target without necessarily fully identifying it.&lt;ref name="See" /&gt; An example of such a feature would be outstretched wings that can be used to tell whether or not a bird is in a picture, even before the system has identified an object as a bird. Evans &amp; Treisman propose that natural scene perception involves a first pass through the [[visual hierarchy|visual processing hierarchy]] up to the nodes in a visual identification network, and then optional revisiting of earlier levels for more detailed analysis. During the 'first pass' stage, the system forms a global representation of the natural scene that includes the layout of global boundaries and potential objects. During the 'revisiting' stage, focused attention is employed to select local objects of interest in a serial manner, and then bind their features to their representations.

This hypothesis is consistent with the results of their study in which participants were instructed to detect animal targets in RSVP sequences, and then report their identities and locations. While participants were able to detect the targets in most trials, they were often subsequently unable to identify or localize them. Furthermore, when two targets were presented in quick succession, participants displayed a significant attentional blink when required to identify the targets, but the attentional blink was mostly eliminated among participants only required to only detect them.&lt;ref name="See" /&gt;  Evans &amp; Treisman explain these results by with the hypothesis that the attentional blink occurs because the identification stage requires attentional resources, while the detection stage does not.

=== Ultra-rapid visual categorization ===

Ultra-rapid visual categorization is a model proposing an automatic [[Feedforward neural network|feedforward]] mechanism that forms high-level object representations in parallel without focused attention. In this model, the mechanism cannot be sped up by training. Evidence for a feedforward mechanism can be found in studies that have shown that many [[neurons]] are already highly selective at the beginning of a visual response, thus suggesting that feedback mechanisms are not required for response selectivity to increase.&lt;ref&gt;Fabre-Thorpe, M., Delorme, A., Marlot, C., &amp; Thorpe, S. (2001). A limit to the speed of processing in ultra-rapid visual categorization of novel natural scenes. ''Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 13(2),'' pp. 171-180.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, recent [[fMRI]] and [[Event-related potential|ERP]] studies have shown that masked visual stimuli that participants do not consciously perceive can significantly modulate activity in the motor system, thus suggesting somewhat sophisticated visual processing.&lt;ref&gt;See 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
VanRullen (2006) ran simulations showing that the feedforward propagation of one wave of spikes through high-level neurons, generated in response to a stimulus, could be enough for crude recognition and categorization that occurs in 150 ms or less.&lt;ref&gt;VanRullen, R. (2007). The power of the feed-forward sweep. ''Advances in Cognitive Psychology, 3(1),'' 167-176.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neural-object file theory ===

Xu &amp; Chun (2009) propose the neural-object file theory, which posits that the human visual system initially selects a fixed number of roughly four objects from a crowded scene based on their spatial information (object individuation) before encoding their details (object identification).&lt;ref&gt;Xu, Y. &amp; Chun, M.M. (2009). Selecting and perceiving multiple visual objects. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences'', 13(4), 167-173.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this framework, object individuation is generally controlled by the i[[Intraparietal sulcus|nferior intra-parietal sulcus]] (IPS), while object identification involves the superior IPS and higher-level visual areas. At the object individuation stage, object representations are coarse and contain minimal feature information. However, once these object representations (or object-files, to use the theory's language) have been 'set up' during the object individuation stage they can be elaborated on over time during the object identification stage, during which additional featural and identity information is received.

The neural-object file theory deals with the issue of attention by proposing two different processing systems. One of them tracks the overall hierarchical structure of the visual display and is attention-free, while the other processes current objects of attentional selection. The current hypothesis is that the [[parahippocampal place area]] (PPA) plays a role in shifting visual attention to different parts of a scene and incorporating information from multiple frames in order to form an integrated representation of the scene.

The separation between object individuation and identification in the neural object-file theory is supported by evidence such as that from Xu's &amp; Chun's fMRI study (as cited in Xu &amp; Chun, 2009). In this study, they examined posterior brain mechanisms that supported [[visual short-term memory]] (VSTM). The fMRI showed that representations in the inferior IPS were fixed to roughly four objects regardless of object complexity, but representations in the superior IPS and [[Occipital lobe|lateral occipital complex]] (LOC) varied according to complexity.&lt;ref&gt;See 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 there was a series of criminal prosecutions in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] against various members of the [[Black Panther Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/427/427.F2d.239.772.34604.html |title=427 F.2d 239 |publisher=Bulk.resource.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The charges ranged from criminal conspiracy to felony murder.  All indictments stemmed from the murder of 19-year-old Alex Rackley in the early hours of May 21, 1969.  The trials became a rallying-point for the [[American Left]], and marked a decline in public support, even among the black community, for the Black Panther Party.

==The crime==
On May 19, 1969, members of the [[Black Panther Party]] kidnapped fellow Panther [[Alex Rackley]], who had fallen under suspicion of informing for the FBI.  He was held captive at the New Haven Panther headquarters on Orchard Street, where he was tortured and interrogated for two days until he confessed. His interrogation was tape recorded by the Panthers.&lt;ref name=tape&gt;Paul Bass, [http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/rackley_trial_tape_surfaces/ Black Panther Torture “Trial” Tape Surfaces], New Haven Independent, Feb 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  During that time, national party chairman [[Bobby Seale]] visited New Haven and spoke on the campus of [[Yale University]] for the Yale Black Ensemble Theater Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=4-ICAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA52 | title = New York Magazine | author1 = New York Media | first1 = LLC | date = 1970-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his speech, Seale briefly stopped by the headquarters where Rackley was being held captive, though it was never proven that he went inside or knew about Rackley's treatment.

Early the next day, three Panthers - [[Warren Kimbro]], [[Lonnie McLucas]], and national Panther "Field Marshal" [[George Sams, Jr.]] - drove Rackley to the nearby town of [[Middlefield, Connecticut]].  Kimbro shot Rackley once in the head and McLucas shot him once in the chest.  They dumped his corpse in the [[Coginchaug River]], where it was discovered the next day.

Police raided the Panther headquarters, eventually arresting nine [[New Haven]] area Black Panthers (in addition to two juveniles).   McLucas and Sams were captured later.

Sams and Kimbro confessed to the murder, and agreed to testify against McLucas in exchange for a reduction in sentence.  Sams also implicated Seale in the killing, telling his interrogators that while visiting the Panther headquarters on the night of his speech, Seale had directly ordered him to murder Rackley.  In all, nine defendants were indicted on charges related to the case.  In the heated political rhetoric of the day, these defendants were referred to as the "New Haven Nine", a deliberate allusion to other ''cause-celebre'' defendants like the "[[Chicago Seven]]".

==Protest and unrest==
The first trial was that of Lonnie McLucas, the only person who physically took part in the killing who refused to plead guilty.  In fact, McLucas had confessed to shooting Rackley, but since some of the charges brought against him made him eligible for the [[death penalty]], a not-guilty plea was the only logical trial strategy.

Jury selection began in May 1970.  The case and trial were already a national ''cause célèbre'' among critics of the Nixon administration, and especially among those hostile to the actions of the [[FBI]].  Under the Bureau's then-secret "Counter-Intelligence Program" ([[COINTELPRO]]), FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] had ordered his agents to disrupt, discredit, or otherwise neutralize radical groups like the Panthers.  Hostility between groups organizing political dissent and the Bureau was, by the time of the trials, at a fever pitch.  Hostility from the left was also directed at the two Panthers cooperating with the prosecutors.  Sams in particular, never widely popular in the movement, was accused of being an informant, and lying to implicate Seale to hide his own complicity with the FBI.

Beginning with the pretrial proceedings, tens of thousands of supporters of the Panthers arrived in New Haven individually and in organized groups.  They were housed and fed by community organizations and by sympathetic Yale students in their dormitory rooms. The Yale college dining halls provided basic meals for everyone.  Protesters met daily ''en masse'' on the [[New Haven Green]] across the street from the Courthouse (and one hundred yards from Yale's main gate) to hear protest speakers. Among the speakers were [[Jean Genet]], [[Benjamin Spock]], [[Abbie Hoffman]], [[Jerry Rubin]], and [[John Froines]] (an assistant professor of chemistry at the University of Oregon).  Teach-ins and other events were also held in the colleges themselves.

Towards midnight on May 1, two bombs exploded in Yale's [[Ingalls Rink]], where a concert was being held in conjunction with the protests.&lt;ref name="BassRae"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bass |first1=Paul |last2=Rae |first2=Douglas |authorlink2=Douglas W. Rae |title=Murder in the Model City: The Black Panthers, Yale, and the Redemption of a Killer |publisher=Basic Books |year=2006 |pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rink was damaged, no one was injured, and no culprit was identified.&lt;ref name="BassRae"/&gt;

Yale chaplain [[William Sloane Coffin]] stated, "All of us conspired to bring on this tragedy by law enforcement agencies by their illegal acts against the Panthers, and the rest of us by our immoral silence in front of these acts," while Yale President [[Kingman Brewster Jr.]] issued the statement, "I personally want to say that I'm appalled and ashamed that things should have come to such a pass that I am skeptical of the ability of Black revolutionaries to achieve a fair trial anywhere in the U.S."  Brewster's generally sympathetic tone enraged many of the university's older, more conservative alumni, heightening tensions within the school community.

As tensions mounted, Yale officials sought to avoid deeper unrest and to deflect the real possibility of riots or violent student demonstrations.  [[Sam Chauncey]] has been credited with winning tactical management on behalf of the administration to quell anxiety among law enforcement and New Haven's citizens, while [[Kurt Schmoke]], a future [[Rhodes Scholar]], mayor of [[Baltimore, MD]] and Dean of [[Howard University]] School of Law, has received kudos as undergraduate spokesman to the faculty during some of the protest's tensest moments. Ralph Dawson, a classmate of Schmoke's, figured prominently as moderator of the Black Student Alliance at Yale (BSAY).

In the end, compromises between the administration and the students quashed the possibility of violence. While Yale (and many other colleges) went "on strike" from May Day until the end of the term, like most schools it was not actually "shut down".   Classes were made "voluntarily optional" for the time and students were graded "Pass/Fail" for the work done up to then.

==Trials==

[[File:Sketch of four head representations, including Ericka Huggins, Warren Kimbro, Bobby G. Seale and George Sams Jr.jpg|thumb|Courtroom portraits including Huggins, Kimbro, Seale and Sams, 1970.]]
McLucas's trial set new records for the scale of judicial proceedings in Connecticut. It was the first in Connecticut to have [[metal detector]]s installed at the courtroom doors; jury selection took six weeks, a Connecticut record, and the jury deliberated for six days, another Connecticut record.&lt;ref name="panthers2.htm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/panthers2.htm |title=Edward Jay Epstein's Home Page |publisher=Edwardjayepstein.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite impassioned accusations from protesters that McLucas was being railroaded into the electric chair by a "racist jury,"&lt;ref&gt;Black, Jonathan, "How do you try a revolutionary? A Black Panther trial in New Haven," ''Village Voice'', July 23, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; the jurors (ten white, two black) acquitted him on the most severe charges, convicting him instead on the sole charge of conspiracy to commit murder.  His defense attorney declared, "The judge was fair, the jury was fair, and, in this case, a black revolutionary was given a fair trial."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902777,00.html Justice In New Haven]," in ''Time'' Magazine, September 14, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;  McLucas was sentenced to twelve to fifteen years in prison.  His two collaborators in the murder, who had  pleaded to second degree murder, were released after four years.&lt;ref name="panthers2.htm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/panthers.htm |title=Edward Jay Epstein's Home Page |publisher=Edwardjayepstein.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FTR-bobbyseale.HTML"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gadflyonline.com/8-6-01/FTR-bobbyseale.HTML |title=Gadfly Online |publisher=Gadfly Online |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 1970, [[Bobby Seale]] went on trial alongside [[Ericka Huggins]], founder of the New Haven chapter.  This trial was an even larger undertaking, involving a full four months of jury selection.  Seale's attorney emphasized that it was only Sams' testimony that tied Seale to Rackley's murder. Huggins's voice was heard on a tape recording of the victim's interrogation, played for the jury. Her lawyer argued that Huggins had been acting under duress.&lt;ref name="tape"/&gt; The jury was unable to reach a verdict, deadlocked 11 to 1 for Seale's acquittal and 10 to 2 for Huggins' acquittal. On May 25, 1971 Judge Harold Mulvey stunned courtroom spectators by dismissing the charges against Huggins and Seale saying, "I find it impossible to believe that an unbiased jury could be selected without superhuman efforts -- efforts which this court, the state and these defendants should not be called upon either to make or to endure".&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, March 1, 2000 [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/01/nyregion/harold-m-mulvey-86-judge-at-tense-black-panther-trials.html Harold M. Mulvey, Judge at Tense Black Panther Party Trials]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Both the Panthers and the FBI suffered damage to their reputations, after the public exposure of their most unsavory activities.

In 1971, a group of left-wing radicals calling themselves the [[Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI]] burglarized an FBI field office in [[Media, Pennsylvania]], which was found to be spying on [[Swarthmore College]] students and faculty.  Among the materials stolen in this break-in were documents revealing the nature of the COINTELPRO program.  Within the year, Director [[J. Edgar Hoover|Hoover]] declared that the centralized COINTELPRO was over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albionmonitor.net/9905a/jbcointelpro.html A Short History of FBI COINTELPRO], retrieved July 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Panthers, the Seale trial may have been the height of their national exposure and their popularity among the broader left-wing movement.  A string of violent confrontations with law-enforcement, along with the trials and convictions of national party leaders that followed, left the movement spent and adrift, and by the mid-1970s it was largely inactive.

The trial surfaced again in the news in 2000, when former first lady [[Hillary Clinton]] ran for U.S. Senate in the state of New York.  Anti-Clinton activists discovered that during the trials, Clinton (then a Yale law student named Hillary Rodham) volunteered  to monitor the trial for violations of civil rights, for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].   Widely circulated mass [[e-mails]] erroneously ascribed to Clinton responsibility for "getting the defendants off," and also blamed the future head of the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] [[U.S. Justice Department]]'s [[Civil Rights Division]], [[Bill Lann Lee]], who was a Yale undergraduate at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/clintons/panthers.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Black Panthers and Hillary Clinton |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both were much too junior to have had any role in the actual legal defense, according to John Elvin of the conservative newsmagazine ''[[Insight on the News]]'', "Insight reviewed biographies of Hillary Clinton by Milton, [[David Brock|[David] Brock]] and [[Roger Morris (American writer)|Roger Morris]] for this story and lengthy selections from such other biographies as [[Barbara Olson]]'s Hell to Pay. Together, relying on primary and other firsthand sources, they unquestionably back [[David Horowitz (conservative writer)|David Horowitz]]'s contention that Hillary was a campus leader during the Panther protests";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/h/hillarypanthers.htm |title=Hillary Clinton once supported Black Panthers on trial for murder-Truth! |publisher=Truthorfiction.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee apparently played no prominent role in any protests.&lt;ref name="hillary.html"&gt;[http://tafkac.org/ulz/hillary.html Urban Legend Zeitgeist: Hillary Clinton and the Black Panthers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Kelly Moye revealed that he was a police informant recruited to infiltrate the Panthers by Nick Pastore, head of New Haven Police's Intelligence Division. George Sams held a gun to Moye's head and demanded he turn over his car. Rackley was driven to his death in Moye's car. The police followed Moye's car as it left toward the murder destination but lost sight of the car prior to the murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/after_37_years_spy_comes_in_from_cold/ After 37 Years, Spy Comes In From Cold, by Paul Bass, New Haven Independent, Aug 4, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The State Police discovered Rackley's body the next day. This epilogue was detailed in an article "After 37 Years, Spy Comes In From Cold" by Paul Bass, author of Murder In The Model City: The Black Panthers, Yale and the Redemption of a Killer.

Detective [[Nick Pastore]], who arrested Seale and brought him to New Haven to stand trial, went on to become New Haven's Chief of Police, widely renowned for his successful policy of [[community policing]], and now heads a nonprofit advocacy group in [[Washington, DC]] named Criminal Justice Policy. Thirty one years later, when Seale returned to New Haven to speak at the [[Yale Repertory Theatre]], Pastore decided to attend and even presented Seale with a pink [[Porcelain pigs|porcelain pig]] and a hug, congratulating him for continuing "the struggle".&lt;ref name="FTR-bobbyseale.HTML"/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''nowhere continuous function''', also called an '''everywhere discontinuous function''', is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that is not [[continuous function|continuous]] at any point of its [[domain of a function|domain]]. If ''f'' is a function from [[real number]]s to real numbers, then ''f'' is nowhere continuous if for each point ''x'' there is an {{nowrap|''ε'' &gt; 0}} such that for each {{nowrap|''δ'' &gt; 0}} we can find a point ''y'' such that {{nowrap|0 &lt; {{abs|''x'' &amp;minus; ''y''}} &lt; ''δ''}} and {{nowrap|{{abs|''f''(''x'') &amp;minus; ''f''(''y'')}} ≥ ''ε''}}. Therefore, no matter how close we get to any fixed point, there are even closer points at which the function takes not-nearby values.

More general definitions of this kind of function can be obtained, by replacing the [[absolute value]] by the distance function in a [[metric space]], or by using the definition of continuity in a [[topological space]].

==Dirichlet function==
One example of such a function is the [[indicator function]] of the [[rational number]]s, also known as the '''Dirichlet function''', named after German mathematician [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]].&lt;ref&gt;Lejeune Dirichlet, P. G. (1829) "Sur la convergence des séries trigonométriques qui servent à répresenter une fonction arbitraire entre des limites donées" [On the convergence of trigonometric series which serve to represent an arbitrary function between given limits], ''Journal für reine und angewandte Mathematik'' [Journal for pure and applied mathematics (also known as ''Crelle's Journal'')], vol. 4, pages 157–169.&lt;/ref&gt;  This function is denoted as ''I''&lt;sub&gt;'''Q'''&lt;/sub&gt; and has [[domain of a function|domain]] and [[codomain]] both equal to the [[real number]]s.  ''I''&lt;sub&gt;'''Q'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') equals 1 if ''x'' is a [[rational number]] and 0 if ''x'' is not rational.  If we look at this function in the vicinity of some number ''y'', there are two cases: 
*If ''y'' is rational, then {{nowrap|1=''f''(''y'') = 1}}. To show the function is not continuous at ''y'', we need to find an ''ε'' such that no matter how small we choose ''δ'', there will be points ''z'' within ''δ'' of ''y'' such that ''f''(''z'') is not within ''ε'' of {{nowrap|1=''f''(''y'') = 1}}.  In fact, 1/2 is such an ''ε''.  Because the [[irrational number]]s are [[dense set|dense]] in the reals, no matter what ''δ'' we choose we can always find an irrational ''z'' within ''δ'' of ''y'', and {{nowrap|1=''f''(''z'') = 0}} is at least 1/2 away from 1. 
*If ''y'' is irrational, then {{nowrap|1=''f''(''y'') = 0}}. Again, we can take {{nowrap|1=''ε'' = 1/2}}, and this time, because the rational numbers are dense in the reals, we can pick ''z'' to be a rational number as close to ''y'' as is required. Again, {{nowrap|1=''f''(''z'') = 1}} is more than 1/2 away from {{nowrap|1=''f''(''y'') = 0}}.
In less rigorous terms, between any two irrationals, there is a rational, and vice versa.

The Dirichlet function can be constructed as the double pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions, as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\lim_{k\to\infty}\left(\lim_{j\to\infty}\left(\cos(k!\pi x)\right)^{2j}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

for integer ''j'' and ''k''.

This shows that the Dirichlet function is a [[Baire function|Baire class]] 2 function. It cannot be a Baire class 1 function because a Baire class 1 function can only be discontinuous on a [[meagre set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In general, if ''E'' is any subset of a [[topological space]] ''X'' such that both ''E'' and the complement of ''E'' are dense in ''X'', then the real-valued function which takes the value 1 on ''E'' and 0 on the complement of ''E'' will be nowhere continuous. Functions of this type were originally investigated by [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]].

==Hyperreal characterisation==
A real function ''f'' is nowhere continuous if its natural [[Hyperreal number|hyperreal]] extension has the property that every ''x'' is infinitely close to a ''y'' such that the difference {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') − ''f''(''y'')}} is appreciable (i.e., not [[infinitesimal]]).

A '''poison pen letter''' is a [[Letter (message)|letter]] or note containing unpleasant, [[abuse|abusive]], or [[:wikt:malicious|malicious]] statements or accusations about the recipient or a third party. It is usually sent [[anonymity|anonymously]]. In the term "poison pen", the word [[poison]] is used [[Poison#Figurative use|figuratively]], rather than literally. Poison pen letters are usually composed and sent to upset the recipient. They differ from [[blackmail]], which is intended to obtain something from the recipient. In contrast, poison pen letters are purely malicious.

In the [[United Kingdom]], Section 1 of the [[Malicious Communications Act 1988]] covers most cases of poison pen letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/communications_offences/#an13|title=Communications Offences: Legal Guidance|date=7 November 2013|publisher=[[Crown Prosecution Service]]|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In statistics, a '''Q–Q (quantile-quantile) plot''' is a [[probability plot]], which is a [[List of graphical methods|graphical method]] for comparing two [[probability distribution]]s by plotting their [[quantile]]s against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Wilk | first=M.B. | last2=Gnanadesikan | first2=R. | journal=Biometrika | year=1968 | volume=55 | pages=1–17 | title=Probability plotting methods for the analysis of data | jstor=2334448 | issue=1 | publisher=Biometrika Trust | pmid=5661047 | postscript=. | doi=10.1093/biomet/55.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the set of intervals for the quantiles is chosen. A point {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} on the plot corresponds to one of the quantiles of the second distribution ({{math|''y''}}-coordinate) plotted against the same quantile of the first distribution ({{math|''x''}}-coordinate). Thus the line is a parametric curve with the parameter which is the number of the interval for the quantile.

If the two distributions being compared are similar, the points in the Q–Q plot will approximately lie on the line {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''}}.  If the distributions are linearly related, the points in the Q–Q plot will approximately lie on a line, but not necessarily on the line {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''}}.  Q–Q plots can also be used as a graphical means of estimating parameters in a [[location-scale family]] of distributions.

A Q–Q plot is used to compare the shapes of distributions, providing a graphical view of how properties such as [[central tendency|location]], [[statistical dispersion|scale]], and [[skewness]] are similar or different in the two distributions.  Q–Q plots can be used to compare collections of data, or [[statistical population|theoretical distributions]].  The use of Q–Q plots to compare two samples of data can be viewed as a [[non-parametric statistics|non-parametric]] approach to comparing their underlying distributions.  A Q–Q plot is generally a more powerful approach to do this than the common technique of comparing [[histogram]]s of the two samples, but requires more skill to interpret.  Q–Q plots are commonly used to compare a data set to a theoretical model.&lt;ref&gt;Gnanadesikan (1977) p199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thode21" /&gt;  This can provide an assessment of "goodness of fit" that is graphical, rather than reducing to a numerical summary.  Q–Q plots are also used to compare two theoretical distributions to each other.&lt;ref name="gibbons" /&gt;  Since Q–Q plots compare distributions, there is no need for the values to be observed as pairs, as in a [[scatter plot]], or even for the numbers of values in the two groups being compared to be equal.

The term "probability plot" sometimes refers specifically to a Q–Q plot, sometimes to a more general class of plots, and sometimes to the less commonly used [[P–P plot]]. The [[probability plot correlation coefficient plot]] (PPCC plot) is a quantity derived from the idea of Q–Q plots, which measures the agreement of a fitted distribution with observed data and which is sometimes used as a means of fitting a distribution to data.

A '''Q–Q plot''' is a plot of the quantiles of two distributions against each other, or a plot based on estimates of the quantiles.  The pattern of points in the plot is used to compare the two distributions.

The main step in constructing a Q–Q plot is calculating or estimating the quantiles to be plotted.  If one or both of the axes in a Q–Q plot is based on a theoretical distribution with a continuous [[cumulative distribution function]] (CDF), all quantiles are uniquely defined and can be obtained by inverting the CDF.  If a theoretical probability distribution with a discontinuous CDF is one of the two distributions being compared, some of the quantiles may not be defined, so an interpolated quantile may be plotted.  If the Q–Q plot is based on data, there are multiple quantile estimators in use.  Rules for forming Q–Q plots when quantiles must be estimated or interpolated are called [[#Plotting positions|plotting positions]].

A simple case is where one has two data sets of the same size. In that case, to make the Q–Q plot, one orders each set in increasing order, then pairs off and plots the corresponding values. A more complicated construction is the case where two data sets of different sizes are being compared.  To construct the Q–Q plot in this case, it is necessary to use an [[interpolation|interpolated]] quantile estimate so that quantiles corresponding to the same underlying probability can be constructed.

More abstractly,&lt;ref name="gibbons"&gt;{{Harv|Gibbons|Chakraborti|2003|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kJbVO2G6VicC&amp;pg=PA144#PPA144,M1 p. 144]}}&lt;/ref&gt; given two cumulative probability distribution functions {{math|''F''}} and {{math|''G''}}, with associated [[quantile function]]s {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''G''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} (the inverse function of the CDF is the quantile function), the Q–Q plot draws the {{math|''q''}}-th quantile of {{math|''F''}} against the {{math|''q''}}-th quantile of {{math|''G''}} for a range of values of {{math|''q''}}.  Thus, the Q–Q plot is a [[parametric equation|parametric curve]] indexed over [0,1] with values in the real plane {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

== Interpretation ==

The points plotted in a Q–Q plot are always non-decreasing when viewed from left to right.  If the two distributions being compared are identical, the Q–Q plot follows the 45° line {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''}}.  If the two distributions agree after linearly transforming the values in one of the distributions, then the Q–Q plot follows some line, but not necessarily the line {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''}}.  If the general trend of the Q–Q plot is flatter than the line {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''}}, the distribution plotted on the horizontal axis is more [[statistical dispersion|dispersed]] than the distribution plotted on the vertical axis.  Conversely, if the general trend of the Q–Q plot is steeper than the line {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''}}, the distribution plotted on the vertical axis is more [[statistical dispersion|dispersed]] than the distribution plotted on the horizontal axis.  Q–Q plots are often arced, or "S" shaped, indicating that one of the distributions is more skewed than the other, or that one of the distributions has heavier tails than the other.

Although a Q–Q plot is based on quantiles, in a standard Q–Q plot it is not possible to determine which point in the Q–Q plot determines a given quantile.  For example, it is not possible to determine the median of either of the two distributions being compared by inspecting the Q–Q plot.  Some Q–Q plots indicate the deciles to make determinations such as this possible.

The intercept and slope of a linear regression between the quantiles gives a measure of the relative location and relative scale of the samples. If the median of the distribution plotted on the horizontal axis is 0, the intercept of a regression line is a measure of location, and the slope is a measure of scale. The distance between medians is another measure of relative location reflected in a Q–Q plot.  The "[[probability plot correlation coefficient]]" (PPCC plot) is the [[pearson product moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]] between the paired sample quantiles.  The closer the correlation coefficient is to one, the closer the distributions are to being shifted, scaled versions of each other.  For distributions with a single shape parameter, the probability plot correlation coefficient plot provides a method for estimating the shape parameter – one simply computes the correlation coefficient for different values of the shape parameter, and uses the one with the best fit, just as if one were comparing distributions of different types.

Another common use of Q–Q plots is to compare the distribution of a sample to a theoretical distribution, such as the standard [[normal distribution]] {{math|''N''(0,1)}}, as in a [[normal probability plot]].  As in the case when comparing two samples of data, one orders the data (formally, computes the order statistics), then plots them against certain quantiles of the theoretical distribution.&lt;ref name="thode21"&gt;{{Harv|Thode|2002|loc=Section 2.2.2, Quantile-Quantile Plots, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gbegXB4SdosC&amp;pg=PA21#PPA21,M1 p. 21]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plotting positions ==
The choice of quantiles from a theoretical distribution can depend upon context and purpose. One choice, given a sample of size {{math|''n''}}, is {{math|''k'' / ''n''}} for {{math|''k'' {{=}} 1, …, ''n''}}, as these are the quantiles that the sampling distribution realizes. The last of these, {{math|''n'' / ''n''}}, corresponds to the 100th percentile – the maximum value of the theoretical distribution, which is sometimes infinite. Other choices are the use of  {{math|(''k'' − 0.5) / ''n''}}, or instead to space the points evenly in the uniform distribution, using {{math|''k'' / (''n'' + 1)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

|last=Weibull
|title=The Statistical Theory of the Strength of Materials
|journal=IVA Handlingar, Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences
|issue=No. 151
|year=1939
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other choices have been suggested, both formal and heuristic, based on theory or simulations relevant in context. The following subsections discuss some of these. A narrower question is choosing a maximum (estimation of a population maximum), known as the [[German tank problem]], for which similar "sample maximum, plus a gap" solutions exist, most simply {{math|''m'' + ''m''/''n'' - 1}}. A more formal application of this uniformization of spacing occurs in [[maximum spacing estimation]] of parameters.

=== Expected value of the order statistic for a uniform distribution ===

The {{math|''k'' / (''n'' + 1)}} approach equals that of plotting the points according to the probability that the last of ({{math|''n''+1}}) randomly drawn values will not exceed the {{math|''k''}}-th smallest of the first {{math|''n''}} randomly drawn values.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=H.O.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expected value of the order statistic for a standard normal distribution ===
In using a [[normal probability plot]], the quantiles one uses are the [[rankit]]s, the quantile of the expected value of the order statistic of a standard normal distribution.

More generally, [[Shapiro–Wilk test]] uses the expected values of the order statistics of the given distribution; the resulting plot and line yields the [[generalized least squares]] estimate for location and scale (from the [[Y-intercept|intercept]] and [[slope]] of the fitted line).&lt;ref name="thode31"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gbegXB4SdosC Testing for Normality], by Henry C. Thode, CRC Press, 2002, {{isbn|978-0-8247-9613-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gbegXB4SdosC&amp;pg=PA31 p. 31]&lt;/ref&gt;
Although this is not too important for the normal distribution (the location and scale are estimated by the mean and standard deviation, respectively), it can be useful for many other distributions.

However, this requires calculating the expected values of the order statistic, which may be difficult if the distribution is not normal.

=== Median of the order statistics ===
Alternatively, one may use estimates of the ''[[median]]'' of the order statistics, which one can compute based on estimates of the median of the order statistics of a uniform distribution and the quantile function of the distribution; this was suggested by {{harv|Filliben|1975}}.&lt;ref name="thode31" /&gt;

This can be easily generated for any distribution for which the quantile function can be computed, but conversely the resulting estimates of location and scale are no longer precisely the least squares estimates, though these only differ significantly for {{math|''n''}} small.

=== Heuristics ===
For the quantiles of the comparison distribution typically the formula {{math|''k'' / (''n'' + 1)}} is used.{{Citation needed|reason=Is there consensus that this is typical?|date=December 2015}}
Several different formulas have been used or proposed as [[affine transformation|affine]] [[symmetrical]] '''plotting positions'''. Such formulas have the form {{math|(''k'' − ''a'') / (''n'' + 1 − 2''a'')}} for some value of {{math|''a''}} in the range from 0 to 1/2, which gives a range between {{math|''k'' / (''n'' + 1)}} and {{math|(''k'' − 1/2) / ''n''}}.

For large sample size, {{math|''n''}}, there is little difference between these various expressions.

=== Filliben's estimate ===
The order statistic medians are the medians of the [[order statistics]] of the distribution. These can be expressed in terms of the quantile function and the [[Order statistics#Order statistics sampled from a uniform distribution|order statistic medians for the continuous uniform distribution]] by:
:&lt;math&gt;
N(i) = G(U(i))
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''U''(''i'')}} are the uniform order statistic medians and {{math|''G''}} is the quantile function for the desired distribution. The quantile function is the inverse of the [[cumulative distribution function]] (probability that {{math|''X''}} is less than or equal to some value). That is, given a probability, we want the corresponding quantile of the cumulative distribution function.

James J. Filliben {{harv|Filliben|1975}} uses the following estimates for the uniform order statistic medians:
:&lt;math&gt;
m(i) = \begin{cases} 1 - 0.5^{1/n} &amp; i = 1\\  \\
                     \dfrac{i - 0.3175}{n + 0.365} &amp; i = 2, 3, \ldots, n-1\\  \\
                     0.5^{1/n} &amp; i = n.\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
The reason for this estimate is that the order statistic medians do not have a simple form.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3423">The '''rank-dependent expected utility''' model (originally called '''anticipated utility''') is a [[generalized expected utility]]  model of choice under [[uncertainty]], designed to explain the behaviour observed in the [[Allais paradox]], as well as for the observation that many people both purchase lottery tickets (implying [[risk-loving]] preferences) and insure against losses (implying [[risk aversion]]).

A natural explanation of these observations is that individuals overweight low-probability events such as winning the lottery, or suffering a disastrous insurable loss. In the Allais paradox, individuals appear to forgo the chance of a very large gain to avoid a one per cent chance of missing out on an otherwise certain large gain, but are less risk averse when offered the chance of reducing an 11 per cent chance of loss to 10 per cent.

A number of attempts were made to model preferences incorporating probability theory, most notably the original version of [[prospect theory]], presented by [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] (1979). However, all such models involved violations of first-order [[stochastic dominance]]. In prospect theory, violations of dominance were avoided by the introduction of an 'editing' operation, but this gave rise to violations of [[transitive relation|transitivity]].

The crucial idea of rank-dependent expected utility was to overweigh only unlikely extreme outcomes, rather than all unlikely events. Formalising this insight required transformations to be applied to the cumulative probability distribution function, rather than to individual probabilities ([[John Quiggin|Quiggin]], 1982, 1993).

The central idea of rank-dependent weightings was then incorporated by [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] into prospect theory, and the resulting model was referred to as [[cumulative prospect theory]] (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992).

==Formal representation==

As the name implies, the rank-dependent model is applied to the increasing rearrangement &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}_{[ \; ]}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies &lt;math&gt;y_{[1]}\leq y_{[2]}\leq ...\leq
y_{[S]}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;W(\mathbf{y})=\sum_{s\in \Omega }h_{[s]}(\mathbf{\pi })u(y_{[s]}) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\pi }\in \Pi ,u:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} ,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_{[s]}(
\mathbf{\pi })&lt;/math&gt; is a probability weight such that 
&lt;math&gt;h_{[s]}(\mathbf{\pi })=q\left( \sum\limits_{t=1}^{s}\pi _{[t]}\right)
-q\left( \sum\limits_{t=1}^{s-1}\pi _{[t]}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

for a transformation function &lt;math&gt;q:[0,1]\rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;q(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;
q(1)=1 &lt;/math&gt;.

Note that 
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{s\in \Omega }h_{[s]}(\mathbf{\pi })=q\left( \sum\limits_{t=1}^{S}\pi
_{[t]}\right) =q(1)=1 &lt;/math&gt;
so that the decision weights sum to 1.

In [[religion]] and [[ethics]], the '''inviolability''' or '''sanctity of life''' is a principle of implied protection regarding aspects of [[sentience|sentient]] life that are said to be holy, [[sacred]], or otherwise of such [[Value theory|value]] that they are not to be violated. This can be applied to both animals and humans, for instance in religions that practice [[Ahimsa]], as both are seen as holy and worthy of life.

The concept of inviolability is an important tie between the ethics of religion and the ethics of law, as each seeks justification for its principles as based on both purity and natural concept, as well as in universality of application.

==In Christianity==
{{Main article|Christianity and abortion}}
The phrase ''sanctity of life'' refers to the idea that human life is [[sacred]], [[holy]], and precious, argued mainly by the [[pro-life]] side in political and [[Morality|moral]] debates over such controversial issues as [[abortion]], [[contraception]], [[euthanasia]], [[embryonic stem-cell research]], and the "[[right to die]]" in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]] and other [[English-speaking countries]]. (Comparable phrases are also used in other languages.) Although the phrase was used primarily in the 19th century in [[Protestant]] discourse, after [[World War II]] the phrase has been used in [[Catholic moral theology]] and, following ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] moral rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Drutchas, Geoffrey Gilbert|title=Is Life Sacred? The Incoherence of the Sanctity of Life as a Moral Principle within the Christian Churches|publisher=Lancaster Theological Seminary|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sanctity of life principle, which is often contrasted with the "[[Quality of Life (Healthcare)|quality of life]]" to some extent, is the basis of all [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] teaching about the fifth commandment in the [[Ten Commandments in Catholic theology|Ten Commandments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rzIMeFZZuycC |title=Jewish and Catholic Bioethics: An Ecumenical Dialogue |editor1=[[Edmund Pellegrino|Edmund D.

== In Eastern religions ==
In Western thought, sanctity of life is usually applied solely to the human species ([[anthropocentrism]], sometimes called [[dominionism]]), in marked contrast to many schools of [[Eastern philosophy]], which often hold that all animal life is sacred―in some cases to such a degree that, for example, practitioners of [[Jainism]] carry brushes with which to sweep insects from their path, lest they inadvertently tread upon them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/5greatvows.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Carlin]], American social critic and author, challenged this viewpoint in his 1996 album and HBO special ''[[Back in Town (George Carlin album)|Back in Town]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://lybio.net/george-carlin-pro-life-abortion-and-the-sanctity-of-life/comedy/|title=George Carlin: Pro Life, Abortion, And The Sanctity Of Life|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sandwich class''' is an informal term used in [[Singapore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.straitstimes.com/ST+Forum/Story/STIStory_209539.html | date = 2008-02-23 | title = Suffering sandwich class?

Very generally, the sandwich class consists of lower-middle-class people who feel "squeezed" &amp;mdash; although they are not poor, they are not able to achieve their aspirations as people with a higher income. 

In Hong Kong, this comprises families with an income of US$20,000–40,000 per year.  Per capita income is typically around US$10,000 per year in Hong Kong, so this places them far above the average family in the territory.  However, given very high real estate prices, it is nowhere near enough for them to afford a private residence.  Hence, they are "sandwiched" between the large population who truly need public assistance, and the smaller number of people who can afford private residences and other luxury goods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1529">In [[statistics]], several '''scatterplot smoothing''' methods are available to fit a function through the points of a [[scatterplot]] to best represent the relationship between the variables.

Scatterplots may be smoothed by fitting a line to the data points in a diagram. This line attempts to display the non-random component of the association between the variables in a 2D scatter plot. Smoothing attempts to separate the non-random behaviour in the data from the random fluctuations, removing or reducing these fluctuations, and allows prediction of the response based value of the [[explanatory variable]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.netmba.com/statistics/plot/scatter/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Y. (2006) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}} (entry for "smoothing")&lt;/ref&gt;

Smoothing is normally accomplished by using any one of the techniques mentioned below.

* A straight line ([[simple linear regression]])
* A [[quadratic polynomial|quadratic]] or a [[polynomial]] curve
* [[Local regression]]
* [[Smoothing spline]]s

The smoothing curve is chosen so as to provide the best fit in some sense, often defined as the fit that results in the minimum [[sum of squared error|sum of the squared errors]] (a [[least squares]] criterion).

'''Selective perception''' is the tendency not to notice and more quickly forget stimuli that cause emotional discomfort and contradict our prior beliefs. For example, a teacher may have a favorite student because they are biased by [[in-group favoritism]]. The teacher ignores the student's poor attainment. Conversely, they might not notice the progress of their least favorite student.&lt;ref name="Griffin2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ricky W. Griffin|title=Fundamentals of Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fx235bL0HTcC&amp;pg=PA259|date=31 January 2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-62749-4|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
'''Selective perception''' is the process by which individuals perceive what they want to in media messages while ignoring opposing viewpoints. It is a broad term to identify the behavior all people exhibit to tend to "see things" based on their particular [[Framing (social sciences)|frame of reference]]. It also describes how we categorize and interpret sensory information in a way that favors one category or interpretation over another. In other words, selective perception is a form of bias because we interpret information in a way that is congruent with our existing values and beliefs. Psychologists believe this process occurs automatically.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Lucas Counselling. (2009, December 29). Psychology Definition Of The Week: Selective Perception. Retrieved March 18, 2013, from https://web.archive.org/web/20120416014147/http://counsellingcentral.com/psychology-definition-of-the-week-selective-perception&lt;/ref&gt;

Selective perception may refer to any number of [[cognitive bias]]es in [[psychology]] related to the way expectations affect [[perception]]. Human judgment and decision making is distorted by an array of cognitive, perceptual and motivational biases, and people tend not to recognise their own bias, though they tend to easily recognise (and even overestimate) the operation of bias in human judgment by others.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Pronin, "[http://web.missouri.edu/~segerti/capstone/Biasinjudgement.pdf Perception and misperception of bias in human judgment]," ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences,'' Volume 11, Issue 1, January 2007, pp. 37–43.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons this might occur might be because people are simply bombarded with too much stimuli every day to pay equal attention to everything, therefore, they pick and choose according to their own needs.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20100522194645/http://lilt.ilstu.edu/rrpope/rrpopepwd/articles/perception3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand when and why a particular region of a scene is selected, studies observed and described the eye movements of individuals as they go about performing specific tasks. In this case, vision was an active process that integrated scene properties with specific, goal-oriented oculomotor behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Canosa, R.L. (2009). Real-world vision: selective perception and task. ACM Trans. Appl. Percpt., 6, 2, Article 11, 34 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other studies have shown that students who were told they were consuming [[alcohol]]ic beverages (which in fact were non-alcoholic) perceived themselves as being "[[drunk]]", exhibited fewer physiological symptoms of social stress, and drove a simulated car similarly to other subjects who had actually consumed alcohol. The result is somewhat similar to the [[placebo effect]].{{Fact|reason=What does this have to do with the topic?|date=October 2007}}

In one classic study on this subject related to the [[hostile media effect]] (which is itself an example of selective perception), viewers watched a filmstrip of a particularly violent [[Princeton University|Princeton]]-[[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] [[American football]] game. Princeton viewers reported seeing nearly twice as many rule infractions committed by the Dartmouth team than did Dartmouth viewers. One Dartmouth alumnus did not see any infractions committed by the Dartmouth side and erroneously assumed he had been sent only part of the film, sending word requesting the rest.&lt;ref&gt;Hastorf, A.H. &amp; Cantril, H. (1954). They saw a game: A case study. ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology'', 49, 129–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Selective perception is also an issue for advertisers, as consumers may engage with some ads and not others based on their pre-existing beliefs about the brand. 

Seymour Smith, a prominent advertising researcher, found evidence for selective perception in advertising research in the early 1960s, and he defined it to be "a procedure by which people let in, or screen out, advertising material they have an opportunity to see or hear. They do so because of their attitudes, beliefs, usage preferences and habits, conditioning, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, Theodore and Smith, Seymour.  "Advertising Works—And Advertising Research Does Too." Presentation to [[ESOMAR]]. Spain: 1970s.&lt;/ref&gt; People who like, buy, or are considering buying a brand are more likely to notice advertising than are those who are neutral toward the brand. This fact has repercussions within the field of [[advertising research]] because any post-advertising analysis that examines the differences in attitudes or buying behavior among those aware versus those unaware of advertising is flawed unless pre-existing differences are controlled for. Advertising research methods that utilize a [[longitudinal design]] are arguably better equipped to control for selective perception.  

Selective perceptions are of two types:
* Low level – [[Perceptual vigilance]]
* High level – [[Perceptual defense]]

'''Self-pity''' is a [[psychological]] state of mind.

==Description==
Though the primary focus of self-pity is on the self and one's own emotions that are within, it also has a strong interpersonal component. Being an interpersonal emotion is directing the emotional feeling or response toward others with the goal of attracting attention, empathy or help. However, some who are dealing with self-pity usually look outside of themselves for the source of their problems which only leads to a downward spiral of issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stober|first=J|title=Self-Pity: Exploring the Links to Personality, Control Beliefs, and Anger|journal=Journal of Personality|year=2003|volume=71 | issue = 2|pages=183–220|doi=10.1111/1467-6494.7102004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Von Neumann probes */ added link to Dennis E. Taylor now that he has a wikipedia page.</comment>

The idea of '''self-replicating spacecraft''' has been applied – in theory – to several distinct "tasks". The particular variant of this idea applied to the idea of [[space exploration]] is known as a '''von Neumann [[Space probe|probe]]'''. Other variants include the [[#Berserkers|Berserker]] and an automated [[terraforming]] seeder ship.

== Theory ==
In theory, a self-replicating spacecraft could be sent to a neighbouring planetary system, where it would seek out raw materials (extracted from [[asteroid]]s, [[natural satellite|moons]], [[gas giant]]s, etc.) to create replicas of itself. These replicas would then be sent out to other planetary systems. The original "parent" probe could then pursue its primary purpose within the star system. This mission varies widely depending on the variant of self-replicating starship proposed.

Given this pattern, and its similarity to the reproduction patterns of bacteria, it has been pointed out that von Neumann machines might be considered a form of life. In his short story, "Lungfish" (see [[Self-replicating machines in fiction]]), [[David Brin]] touches on this idea, pointing out that self-replicating machines launched by different species might actually compete with one another (in a [[Darwinism|Darwinistic]] fashion) for raw material, or even have conflicting missions. Given enough variety of "species" they might even form a type of [[ecology]], or – should they also have a form of [[artificial intelligence]] – a society. They may even mutate with untold thousands of "generations".

The first quantitative engineering analysis of such a spacecraft was published in 1980 by [[Robert Freitas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Robert A., Jr.| last=Freitas| title=A Self-Reproducing Interstellar Probe| journal=J. Brit. Interplanet. Soc.| volume=33|date=July 1980| pages=251–264| url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm| bibcode=1980JBIS...33..251F}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the non-replicating [[Project Daedalus]] design was modified to include all subsystems necessary for self-replication. The design's strategy was to use the probe to deliver a "seed" factory with a mass of about 443 tons to a distant site, have the seed factory replicate many copies of itself there to increase its total manufacturing capacity, over a 500-year period, and then use the resulting [[automatic factory|automated industrial complex]] to construct more probes with a single seed factory on board each.

It has been theorized&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ComparisonReproNov1980.htm Comparison of Reproducing and Nonreproducing Starprobe Strategies for Galactic Exploration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that a self-replicating starship utilizing relatively conventional theoretical methods of interstellar travel (i.e., no exotic [[faster-than-light]] propulsion, and speeds limited to an "average cruising speed" of 0.1'''[[Speed of light|c]]'''.) could spread throughout a [[galaxy]] the size of the [[Milky Way]] in as little as half a million years.

==Implications for Fermi's paradox==
In 1981, [[Frank Tipler]]&lt;ref name="Tipler"&gt;"Extraterrestrial Beings Do Not Exist", ''Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society'', vol. 21, number 267 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; put forth an argument that [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] intelligences do not exist, based on the absence of von Neumann probes. Given even a moderate rate of replication and the history of the galaxy, such probes should already be common throughout space and thus, we should have already encountered them. Because we have not, this shows that extraterrestrial intelligences do not exist. This is thus a resolution to the [[Fermi paradox]] – that is, the question of why we have not ''already'' encountered extraterrestrial intelligence if it is common throughout the universe.

A response&lt;ref name="Sagan and Newman"&gt;Sagan, Carl and Newman, William: "The Solipsist Approach to Extraterrestrial Intelligence", ''Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society'', vol. 24, number 113 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; came from [[Carl Sagan]] and William Newman. Now known as ''Sagan's Response'', it pointed out that in fact Tipler had underestimated the rate of replication, and that von Neumann probes should have already started to consume most of the mass in the galaxy. Any intelligent race would therefore, Sagan and Newman reasoned, not design von Neumann probes in the first place, and would try to destroy any von Neumann probes found as soon as they were detected. As Robert Freitas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Robert A., Jr.| last=Freitas| title=Extraterrestrial Intelligence in the Solar System: Resolving the Fermi Paradox| journal=J. Brit. Interplanet. Soc.| volume=36|date=November 1983| pages=496–500| url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ResolvingFermi1983.htm| bibcode=1983JBIS...36..496F}}&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out, the assumed capacity of von Neumann probes described by both sides of the debate are unlikely in reality, and more modestly reproducing systems are unlikely to be observable in their effects on our Solar System or the Galaxy as a whole.

Another objection to the prevalence of von Neumann probes is that civilizations of the type that could potentially create such devices may have inherently short lifetimes, and self-destruct before so advanced a stage is reached, through such events as [[biological warfare|biological]] or [[nuclear warfare]], [[grey goo|nanoterrorism]], [[resource depletion|resource exhaustion]], [[environmental disaster|ecological catastrophe]], or [[pandemic]]s.

Simple workarounds exist to avoid the over-replication scenario. [[Radio]] transmitters, or other means of wireless communication, could be used by probes programmed not to replicate beyond a certain density (such as five probes per cubic [[parsec]]) or arbitrary limit (such as ten million within one century), analogous to the [[Hayflick limit]] in cell reproduction.  One problem with this defence against uncontrolled replication is that it would only require a single probe to malfunction and begin unrestricted reproduction for the entire approach to fail – essentially a technological cancer – unless each probe also has the ability to detect such malfunction in its neighbours and implements a seek and destroy protocol (which in turn could lead to probe-on-probe space wars if faulty probes first managed to multiply to high numbers before they were found by sound ones, which could then well have programming to replicate to matching numbers so as to manage the infestation).  Another workaround is based on the need for spacecraft heating during long interstellar travel.  The use of plutonium as a thermal source would limit the ability to self-replicate.  The spacecraft would have no programming to make more plutonium even if it found the required raw materials.  Another is to program the spacecraft with a clear understanding of the dangers of uncontrolled replication.

== Applications for self-replicating spacecraft ==
The details of the mission of self-replicating starships can vary widely from proposal to proposal, and the only common trait is the self-replicating nature.

=== Von Neumann probes ===
A von Neumann probe is a spacecraft capable of replicating itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm A Self-Reproducing Interstellar Probe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is named after [[Hungarian American]] [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]] [[John von Neumann]], who rigorously studied the concept of self-replicating machines that he called "Universal Assemblers" and which are often referred to as "[[Self-replicating machine|von Neumann machines]]".  While von Neumann never applied his work to the idea of spacecraft, theoreticians since then have done so.

If a self-replicating probe finds evidence of primitive life (or a primitive, low-level culture) it might be programmed to lie dormant, silently observe, attempt to make contact (this variant is known as a [[Bracewell probe]]), or even interfere with or guide the evolution of life in some way.

Physicist [[Paul Davies]] of [[Arizona State University]] has even raised the possibility of a probe resting on our own [[Moon]], having arrived at some point in Earth's ancient prehistory and remained to monitor Earth{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, which is very reminiscent of Arthur C. Clarke's ''[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]'' and the [[Stanley Kubrick]] [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|film ''2001: A Space Odyssey'']].

A variant idea on the interstellar von Neumann probe idea is that of the "[[Astrochicken]]", proposed by [[Freeman Dyson]]. While it has the common traits of self-replication, exploration, and communication with its "home base", Dyson conceived the Astrochicken to explore and operate within our own [[planetary system]], and not explore interstellar space.

Oxford-based philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] discusses the idea that future powerful [[superintelligence]]s will create efficient cost-effective space travel and interstellar Von Neumann probes.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Bostrom 2003 Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence, section 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anders Sandberg]] and Stuart Armstrong argued that launching the colonization of the entire reachable universe through self-replicating probes is well within the capabilities of a star-spanning civilization, and proposed a theoretical approach for achieving it in 32 years, by mining planet Mercury for resources and constructing a [[Dyson sphere#Dyson swarm|Dyson Swarm]] around the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/intergalactic-spreading.pdf Eternity in six hours: intergalactic spreading of intelligent life and sharpening the Fermi paradox]. Stuart Armstrong, Anders Sandberg, Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Berserkers ===
{{noref|section|date=September 2018}}
&lt;!-- [[Berserker probe]] section-redirects here --&gt;

A variant of the self-replicating starship is the ''Berserker''. Unlike the benign probe concept, Berserkers are programmed to seek out and exterminate lifeforms and life-bearing [[exoplanets]] whenever they are encountered.

The name is derived from the ''[[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]]'' series of novels by [[Fred Saberhagen]] which describe a war between humanity and such machines. Saberhagen points out (through one of his characters) that the Berserker warships in his novels are not von Neumann machines themselves, but the larger complex of Berserker machines – including automated shipyards – ''do'' constitute a von Neumann machine. This again brings up the concept of an ecology of von Neumann machines, or even a von Neumann hive entity.

It is speculated in fiction that Berserkers could be created and launched by a [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] civilization (see ''[[Anvil of Stars]]'', by [[Greg Bear]], in the section [[#In fiction|In fiction]] below) or could theoretically "mutate" from a more benign probe. For instance, a von Neumann ship designed for [[terraforming]] processes – mining a planet's surface and adjusting its atmosphere to more human-friendly conditions – might malfunction and attack inhabited planets, killing their inhabitants in the process of changing the planetary environment, and then self-replicate and dispatch more ships to attack other planets.

=== Replicating seeder ships ===
Yet another variant on the idea of the self-replicating starship is that of the seeder ship. Such starships might store the genetic patterns of lifeforms from their home world, perhaps even of the species which created it. Upon finding a habitable [[exoplanet]], or even one that might be [[Terraforming|terraform]]ed, it would try to replicate such lifeforms – either from [[embryo space colonization|stored embryos]] or from stored information using [[molecular nanotechnology]] to build [[zygotes]] with varying genetic information from local raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;Tipler, Frank J. "Extraterrestrial intelligent beings do not exist."  Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society 21 (1980): page 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such ships might be terraforming vessels, preparing colony worlds for later colonization by other vessels, or – should they be programmed to recreate, raise, and educate individuals of the species that created it – self-replicating colonizers themselves. Seeder ships would be a suitable alternative to [[Generation ship]]s as a way to colonize worlds too distant to travel to in one lifetime.

=== Von Neumann probes ===
	 
* ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'': The [[monolith (Space Odyssey)|monolith]]s in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s [[book]] and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s [[film]] ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' were intended to be self-replicating probes, though the artifacts in "[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]", Clarke's original short story upon which 2001 was based, were not.  The film was to begin with a series of scientists explaining how probes like these would be the most efficient method of exploring outer space. Kubrick cut the opening segment from his film at the last minute, however, and these monoliths became almost mystical entities in both the film and Clarke's novel.
	 
* ''[[Cold as Ice (novel)|Cold As Ice]]'': In the novel by [[Charles Sheffield]], there is a segment where the author (a physicist) describes Von Neumann machines harvesting [[sulfur]], [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[helium-4]], and various metals from the atmosphere of [[Jupiter]].
	 
* ''[[Destiny's Road]]'': [[Larry Niven]] frequently refers to Von Neumann probes in many of his works. In his 1998 book ''Destiny's Road'', Von Neumann machines are scattered throughout the human colony world Destiny and its moon Quicksilver in order to build and maintain technology and to make up for the lack of the resident humans' technical knowledge; the Von Neumann machines primarily construct a stretchable fabric cloth capable of acting as a [[Solar thermal collector|solar collector]] which serves as the humans' primary energy source. The Von Neumann machines also engage in ecological maintenance and other exploratory work.

* ''[[No Man's Sky]]'': In the video game ''No Man's Sky'' mysterious probes called Sentinels roam all the planets in the entire galaxy, analyzing the fauna and flora and protecting them from extinction. It is likely these probes have self-replicated for centuries and managed to spread through the galaxy.
	 
* ''[[The Devil's Blind Spot]]'': See also [[Alexander Kluge]], ''The Devil's Blind Spot'' (New Directions; 2004.)
	 
* ''[[Spin (novel)|Spin]]'': In the novel by [[Robert Charles Wilson]], Earth is veiled by a temporal field. Humanity tries to understand and escape this field by using Von Neumann probes. It is later revealed that the field itself was generated by Von Neumann probes from another civilization, and that a competition for resources had taken place between earth's and the aliens' probes.
	 
* ''[[The Third Millennium: A History of the World AD 2000-3000]]'': In the book by [[Brian Stableford]] and [[David Langford]] (published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], Inc. 1985) humanity sends cycle-limited Von Neumann probes out to the nearest stars to do open-ended exploration and to announce humanity's existence to whoever might encounter them.
	 
* ''[[Von Neumann's War]]'': In ''Von Neumann's War'' by [[John Ringo]] and [[Travis S. Taylor]] (published by [[Baen Books]] in 2007) Von Neumann probes arrive in the solar system, moving in from the outer planets, and converting all metals into gigantic structures. Eventually, they arrive on Earth, wiping out much of the population before being beaten back when humanity [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineers]] some of the probes.
	 
* ''[[Grey Goo (video game)|Grey Goo]]'': In the video game ''Grey Goo'', the "Goo" faction is composed entirely of Von Neumann probes sent through various microscopic wormholes to map the Milky Way Galaxy. The faction's units are configurations of nanites used during their original mission of exploration, which have adapted to a combat role. The Goo starts as an antagonist to the Human and Beta factions, but their true objective is revealed during their portion of the single-player campaign. Related to, and inspired by, the [[Grey Goo]] doomsday scenario.

* ''We Are Legion (We Are Bob)'' by [[Dennis E. Taylor]]: Bob Johansson, the former owner of a software company, dies in a car accident, only to wake up a hundred years later as a computer emulation of Bob. Given a Von Neumann probe by America's religious replacement, he is sent out to explore, exploit, expand, and experiment for the good of the human race.

=== Berserkers ===
	 
* In the science fiction short story collection ''[[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]]'' by [[Fred Saberhagen]], a series of short stories include accounts of battles fought against extremely destructive Berserker machines. This and subsequent books set in the same [[fictional universe]] are the origin of the term "Berserker probe".
	 
* In the [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|2003 miniseries]] [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' (and the subsequent [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|2004 series]]) the Cylons are similar to Berserkers in their wish to destroy human life. They were created by humans in a group of fictional planets called the Twelve Colonies. The Cylons created special models that look like humans in order to destroy the twelve colonies and later, the fleeing fleet of surviving humans.
	 
* The [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] of ''[[Star Trek]]'' – a self-replicating bio-mechanical race that is dedicated to the task of achieving perfection through the assimilation of useful technology and lifeforms. Their ships are massive mechanical cubes (a close step from the Berserker's massive mechanical Spheres).
	 
* Science fiction author [[Larry Niven]] later borrowed this notion in his short story "[[Limits (novel)|A Teardrop Falls]]".
	 
* In the computer game ''[[Star Control II]]'', the [[Slylandro]] Probe is an out-of-control self-replicating probe that attacks [[starship]]s of other races. They were not originally intended to be a berserker probe; they sought out intelligent life for peaceful contact, but due to a programming error, they would immediately switch to "resource extraction" mode and attempt to dismantle the target ship for raw materials. While the plot claims that the probes reproduce "at a geometric rate", the game itself caps the frequency of encountering these probes. It is possible to deal with the menace in a side-quest, but this is not necessary to complete the game, as the probes only appear one at a time, and the player's ship will eventually be fast and powerful enough to outrun them or destroy them for resources – although the probes will eventually dominate the entire game universe.
	 
* In [[Iain Banks]]' novel ''[[Excession]]'', hegemonising swarms are described as a form of [[Outside Context Problem]]. An example of an "Aggressive Hegemonising Swarm Object" is given as an uncontrolled self-replicating probe with the goal of turning all matter into copies of itself.  After causing great damage, they are somehow transformed using unspecified techniques by the [[Zetetic Elench]] and become "Evangelical Hegemonising Swarm Objects". Such swarms (referred to as "smatter") reappear in the later novels ''[[Surface Detail]]'' (which features scenes of space combat against the swarms) and ''[[The Hydrogen Sonata]]''.
	 
* The [[Inhibitors (Revelation Space)|Inhibitors]] from [[Alastair Reynolds]]' ''[[Revelation Space]]'' series are self-replicating machines whose purpose is to inhibit the development of intelligent star-faring cultures.  They are dormant for extreme periods of time until they detect the presence of a space-faring culture and proceed to exterminate it even to the point of sterilizing entire planets.  They are very difficult to destroy as they seem to have faced every type of weapon ever devised and only need a short time to 'remember' the necessary counter-measures.
	 
* Also from [[Alastair Reynolds]]' books, the "Greenfly" terraforming machines are another form of berserker machines. For unknown reasons, but probably an error in their programming, they destroy planets and turn them into trillions of domes filled with vegetation – after all, their purpose is to produce a habitable environment for humans, however in doing so they inadvertently decimate the human race. By 10,000, they have wiped out most of the Galaxy.
	 
* The [[Reapers (Mass Effect)|Reapers]] in the video game series ''[[Mass Effect]]'' are also self-replicating probes bent on destroying any advanced civilization encountered in the galaxy. They lie dormant in the vast spaces between the galaxies and follow a cycle of extermination. It is seen in ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'' that they assimilate any advanced species.
	 
* [[Mantrid]] Drones from the [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Lexx]]'' were an extremely aggressive type of self-replicating Berserker machine, eventually converting the majority of the matter in the universe into copies of themselves in the course of their quest to thoroughly exterminate humanity.
	 
* The ''[[Babylon 5]]'' episode "[[Infection (Babylon 5)|Infection]]" showed a smaller scale berserker in the form of the Icarran War Machine. After being created with the goal of defeating an unspecified enemy faction, the War Machines proceeded to exterminate all life on the planet Icarra VII because they had been programmed with standards for what constituted a 'Pure Icaran' based on religious teachings, which no actual Icaran could satisfy. Because the Icaran were pre-starflight, the War Machines became dormant after completing their task rather than spreading. One unit was reactivated on-board Babylon 5 after being smuggled past quarantine by an unscrupulous archaeologist, but after being confronted with how they had rendered Icara VII a dead world, the simulated personality of the War Machine committed suicide. 
	 
* The ''[[Babylon 5]]'' episode "[[A Day in the Strife]]" features a probe that threatens the station with destruction unless a series of questions designed to test a civilization's level of advancement are answered correctly. The commander of the station correctly surmises that the probe is actually a berserker and that if the questions are answered the probe would identify them as a threat to its originating civilization and detonate.
	 
* [[Greg Bear]]'s novel ''[[The Forge of God]]'' deals directly with the concept of "Berserker" von Neumann probes and their consequences.  The idea is further explored in the novel's sequel, ''[[Anvil of Stars]]'', which explores the reaction other civilizations have to the creation and release of Berserkers.
	 
* In [[Gregory Benford]]'s ''[[Galactic Center Saga]]'' series, an antagonist berserker machine race is encountered by Earth, first as a probe in ''[[In the Ocean of Night]]'', and then in an attack in ''[[Across the Sea of Suns]]''.  The berserker machines do not seek to completely eradicate a race if merely throwing it into a primitive low technological state will do as they did to the EMs encountered in ''Across the Sea of Suns''.  The alien machine Watchers would not be considered von Neumann machines themselves, but the collective machine race could.
	 
* On ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' the [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicator]]s were a vicious race of insect-like robots that were originally created by an android named Reese to serve as toys. They grew beyond her control and began evolving, eventually spreading throughout at least two galaxies. In addition to ordinary autonomous evolution they were able to analyze and incorporate new technologies they encountered into themselves, ultimately making them one of the most advanced "races" known. 
	 
* On ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', a second race of replicators created by the Ancients were encountered in the Pegasus Galaxy. They were created as a means to defeat the Wraith. The Ancients attempted to destroy them after they began showing signs of sentience and requested that their drive to kill the wraith be removed. This failed, and an unspecified length of time after the Ancients retreated to the Milky Way Galaxy, the replicators nearly succeeded in destroying the Wraith. The Wraith were able to hack into the replicators and deactivate the extermination drive, at which point they retreated to their home world and were not heard from again until encountered by the Atlantis Expedition. After the Atlantis Expedition reactivated this dormant directive, the replicators embarked on a plan to kill the Wraith by removing their food source, i.e. all humans in the Pegasus Galaxy.
	 
* In ''[[Stargate Universe]]'' Season 2, a galaxy billions of light years distant from the Milky Way is infested with drone ships that are programmed to annihilate intelligent life and advanced technology. The drone ships attack other space ships (including [[List of starships in Stargate#Destiny|Destiny]]) as well as humans on planetary surfaces, but don't bother destroying primitive technology such as buildings unless they are harboring intelligent life or advanced technology.
	 
* In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "[[List of Justice League episodes#ep10|Dark Heart]]", an alien weapon based on this same idea lands on Earth.
	 
* In the ''[[Homeworld: Cataclysm]]'' video game, a bio-mechanical virus called ''Beast'' has the ability to alter organic and mechanic material to suit its needs, and the ships infected become self-replicating hubs for the virus.
	 
* In the SF [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]] ''[[EVE Online]]'', experiments to create more autonomous drones than the ones used by player's ships accidentally created 'rogue drones' which form hives in certain parts of space and are used extensively in missions as difficult opponents.
	 
* In the computer game ''[[Sword of the Stars]]'', the player may randomly encounter "Von Neumann". A Von Neumann mothership appears along with smaller Von Neumann probes, which attack and consume the player's ships.  The probes then return to the mothership, returning the consumed material.  If probes are destroyed, the mothership will create new ones.  If all the player's ships are destroyed, the Von Neumann probes will reduce the planets resource levels before leaving.  The probes appear as blue octahedrons, with small spheres attached to the apical points.  The mothership is a larger version of the probes. In the 2008 expansion ''A Murder of Crows'', Kerberos Productions also introduces the VN Berserker, a combat oriented ship, which attacks player planets and ships in retaliation to violence against VN Motherships. If the player destroys the Berserker things will escalate and a System Destroyer will attack.
	 
* In the ''[[X (computer game series)|X Computer Game Series]]'', the [[X (game series)#Featured races|Xenon]] are a malevolent race of [[AI|artificially intelligent]] machines descended from terraforming ships sent out by humans to prepare worlds for eventual colonization; the result caused by a bugged software update.  They are continual antagonists in the [[X (computer game series)#The X Universe|X-Universe]].
	 
* In the comic ''[[Transmetropolitan]]'' a character mentions "Von Neumann rectal infestations" which are apparently caused by "Shit-ticks that build more shit-ticks that build more shit-ticks".
	 
* In the anime ''[[Vandread]]'', harvester ships attack vessels from both male- and female-dominated factions and harvest hull, reactors, and computer components to make more of themselves. To this end, Harvester ships are built around mobile factories. Earth-born humans also view the inhabitants of the various colonies to be little more than spare parts.
	 
* In ''[[Earth 2160]]'', the Morphidian Aliens rely on {{Not a typo|Mantain}} strain aliens for colonization. Most {{Not a typo|Mantain}}-derived aliens can absorb water, then reproduce like a colony of cells. In this manner, even one {{Not a typo|Mantain}} Lady (or Princess, or Queen) can create enough clones to cover the map. Once they have significant numbers, they "choose an evolutionary path" and swarm the enemy, taking over their resources.
	 
* In the European comic series ''[[Storm (Don Lawrence)|Storm]]'' No 20 &amp; 21 goes over this subject. A kind of bezerk von Neumann is set to collision course with the pandarve system.
	 
* In PC role-playing game ''[[Space Rangers (video game)|Space Rangers]]'' and its sequel ''[[Space Rangers 2: Dominators]]'', a league of 5 nations battles three different types of Berserker robots. One that focuses on invading planets, another that battles normal space and third that lives in hyperspace.
	 
* In the ''[[Star Wolves]]'' video game series, Berserkers are a self-replicating machine menace that threatens the known universe for purposes of destruction and/or assimilation of humanity.
	 
* The [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] features the World Devastators, large ships designed and built by the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] that tear apart planets to use its materials to build other ships or even upgrade or replicate themselves.
	 
* The Tet in the 2013 film ''[[Oblivion (2013 film)|Oblivion]]'' is revealed to be a Berserker of sorts: a sentient machine that travels from planet to planet, exterminating the indigenous population using armies of robotic drones and cloned members of the target species. The Tet then proceeds to harvest the planet's water in order to extract hydrogen for [[nuclear fusion]].
	 
* In ''[[Eclipse Phase]]'', an ETI probe is believed to have infected the TITAN computer systems with the Exsurgent virus to cause them to go berserk and wage war on humanity. This would make ETI probes a form of berserker, albeit one that uses pre-existing computer systems as its key weapons.
	 
* In ''[[Herr aller Dinge]]'' by [[Andreas Eschbach]], an ancient nano machine complex is discovered buried in a glacier off the coast of Russia. When it comes in contact with materials it needs to fulfill its mission, it creates a launch facility and launches a space craft. It is later revealed that the nano machines were created by a pre-historic human race with the intention of destroying other interstellar civilizations (for an unknown reason). It is purposed that the reason there is no evidence of the race is because of the nano-machines themselves and their ability to manipulate matter at an atomic level. It is even suggested that viruses could be ancient nano machines that have evolved over time.
	 
=== Replicating Seeder Ships ===
	 
* ''[[Code of the Lifemaker]]'' by [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]] describes the evolution of a society of humanoid-like robots who inhabit Saturn's moon Titan. The sentient machines are descended from an unmanned factory ship that was to be self replicating, but suffered radiation damage and went off course, eventually landing on Titan around 1,000,000 BC.
	 
* ''[[Manifold: Space]]'', [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]]'s novel, starts with the discovery of alien self-replicating machines active within the Solar system.
	 
* In the ''[[Metroid Prime: Trilogy|Metroid Prime]]'' subseries of games, the massive Leviathans are probes routinely sent out from the planet Phaaze to infect other planets with Phazon radiation and eventually turn these planets into clones of Phaaze, where the self-replication process can continue.
	 
* In [[David Brin]]'s short story collection, ''[[The River of Time]]'' (1986), the short story "Lungfish" prominently features von Neumann probes.&lt;ref&gt;The complete text of the story has been placed on the author's website at [http://www.davidbrin.com/lungfish1.html davidbrin.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does he explore the concept of the probes themselves, but indirectly explores the ideas of competition between different designs of probes, evolution of von Neumann probes in the face of such competition, and the development of a type of ecology between von Neumann probes. One of the vessels mentioned is clearly a Seeder type.
	 
* In ''[[The Songs of Distant Earth]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], humanity on a future Earth facing imminent destruction creates automated seedships that act as [[fire and forget]] lifeboats aimed at distant, habitable worlds. Upon landing, the ship begins to create new humans from stored genetic information, and an onboard computer system raises and trains the first few generations of new inhabitants. The massive ships are then broken down and used as building materials by their "children".
	 
* On the ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' episode "[[Stargate Atlantis (season 5)#ep95|Remnants]]", the Atlantis team finds an ancient probe that they later learn was launched by a now-extinct, technologically advanced race in order to seed new worlds and re-propagate their silicon-based species. The probe communicated with inhabitants of Atlantis by means of hallucinations.
	 
* On the ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' episode "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 4)#ep75|Scorched Earth]]", a species of newly relocated humanoids face extinction via an automated terraforming colony seeder ship controlled by an [[Artificial Intelligence]].
	 
* On ''[[Stargate Universe]]'', the human adventurers live on a ship called ''Destiny''. Its mission was to connect a network of [[Stargate (device)|Stargates]], placed by preceding seeder ships on planets capable of supporting life to allow instantaneous travel between them.
	 
* The trilogy of albums which conclude the comic book series ''[[Storm (Don Lawrence)|Storm]]'' by [[Don Lawrence]] (starting with ''Chronicles of Pandarve 11: The Von Neumann machine'') is based on self-replicating conscious machines containing the sum of all human knowledge employed to rebuild human society throughout the universe in case of disaster on Earth. The probe malfunctions and although new probes are built, they do not separate from the motherprobe, which eventually results in a cluster of malfunctioning probes so big that it can absorb entire moons.

[[File:3D Spherical.svg|thumb|240px|right|Spherical coordinates {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}} as commonly used in '''''physics''''' ([[International Organisation for Standardisation|ISO]] convention): radial distance {{mvar|r}}, polar angle {{mvar|θ}} ([[theta]]), and azimuthal angle {{mvar|φ}} ([[phi]]). The symbol {{mvar|ρ}} ([[rho]]) is often used instead of {{mvar|r}}.]]

[[File:3D Spherical 2.svg|thumb|240px|right|Spherical coordinates {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}} as often used in '''''mathematics''''': radial distance {{mvar|r}}, azimuthal angle {{mvar|θ}}, and polar angle {{mvar|φ}}. The meanings of {{mvar|θ}} and {{mvar|φ}} have been swapped compared to the physics convention.]]

[[File:Spherical coordinate system.svg|thumb|240px|right|A globe showing the radial distance, polar angle and azimuth angle of a point {{mvar|P}} with respect to a [[unit sphere]]. In this image, {{mvar|r}} equals 4/6, {{mvar|θ}} equals 90&amp;deg;, and {{mvar|φ}} equals 30&amp;deg;.]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''spherical coordinate system''' is a [[coordinate system]] for [[dimension|three-dimensional space]] where the position of a point is specified by three numbers: the ''radial distance'' of that point from a fixed origin, its ''polar angle'' measured from a fixed [[zenith]] direction, and the ''[[azimuth|azimuth angle]]'' of its [[orthogonal projection]] on a reference plane that passes through the origin and is orthogonal to the zenith, measured from a fixed reference direction on that plane. It can be seen as the three-dimensional version of the [[polar coordinate system]]. 

The radial distance is also called the ''radius'' or ''radial coordinate''. The polar angle may be called ''colatitude'', ''zenith angle'', ''normal angle'', or ''inclination angle''.

The use of symbols and the order of the coordinates differs between sources. In one system frequently encountered in physics ({{mvar|r}}, [[theta|{{mvar|θ}}]], [[phi|{{mvar|φ}}]]) gives the radial distance, polar angle, and azimuthal angle, whereas in another system used in many mathematics books {{mvar|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}} gives the radial distance, azimuthal angle, and polar angle. In both systems [[rho|{{mvar|ρ}}]] is often used instead of {{mvar|r}}. Other conventions are also used, so great care needs to be taken to check which one is being used. &lt;!-- Please maintain a consistent convention in this article. --&gt;

A number of different spherical coordinate systems following other conventions are used outside mathematics. In a [[geographical coordinate system]] positions are measured in latitude, longitude and height or altitude. There are a number of different [[celestial coordinate system]]s based on different [[Fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental planes]] and with different terms for the various coordinates. The spherical coordinate systems used in mathematics normally use [[radian]]s rather than [[degree (angle)|degrees]] and measure the azimuthal angle counterclockwise from the {{mvar|x}}-axis to the {{mvar|y}}-axis rather than clockwise from north (0°) to east (+90°) like the [[horizontal coordinate system]].&lt;ref&gt;Duffett-Smith, P and Zwart, J, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The polar angle is often replaced by the ''elevation angle'' measured from the reference plane. Elevation angle of zero is at the horizon.

The spherical coordinate system generalizes the two-dimensional polar coordinate system. It can also be extended to higher-dimensional spaces and is then referred to as a [[N-sphere#Spherical coordinates|hyperspherical coordinate system]].

== Definition ==

To define a spherical coordinate system, one must choose two orthogonal directions, the ''zenith'' and the ''azimuth reference'', and an ''origin'' point in space. These choices determine a reference plane that contains the origin and is perpendicular to the zenith. The spherical coordinates of a point {{mvar|P}} are then defined as follows:

* The ''radius'' or ''radial distance'' is the [[Euclidean distance]] from the origin {{mvar|O}} to {{mvar|P}}.
* The ''inclination'' (or ''polar angle'') is the angle between the zenith direction and the line segment {{mvar|OP}}.
* The ''azimuth'' (or ''azimuthal angle'') is the signed angle measured from the azimuth reference direction to the orthogonal projection of the line segment {{mvar|OP}} on the reference plane.

The sign of the azimuth is determined by choosing what is a ''positive'' sense of turning about the zenith. This choice is arbitrary, and is part of the coordinate system's definition.

The ''elevation'' angle is 90 degrees ({{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} radians) minus the inclination angle.

If the inclination is zero or 180 degrees ({{pi}} radians), the azimuth is arbitrary. If the radius is zero, both azimuth and inclination are arbitrary.

In [[linear algebra]], the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] from the origin {{mvar|O}} to the point {{mvar|P}} is often called the ''[[position vector]]'' of ''P''.

=== Conventions ===

Several different conventions exist for representing the three coordinates, and for the order in which they should be written. The use of {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}} to denote radial distance, inclination (or elevation), and azimuth, respectively, is common practice in physics, and is specified by [[International Organisation for Standardisation|ISO]] standard [[ISO 80000-2|80000-2:2009]], and earlier in [[ISO 31-11]] (1992).

However, some authors (including mathematicians) use {{mvar|φ}} for inclination (or elevation) and {{mvar|θ}} for azimuth, which "provides a logical extension of the usual polar coordinates notation".&lt;ref name="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCoordinates.html"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2010-01-15
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors may also list the azimuth before the inclination (or elevation), and/or use {{mvar|ρ}} (rho) instead of {{mvar|r}} for radial distance. Some combinations of these choices result in a [[right-hand rule|left-handed]] coordinate system. The standard convention {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}} conflicts with the usual notation for the two-dimensional [[polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]], where {{mvar|θ}} is often used for the azimuth. It may also conflict with the notation used for three-dimensional [[cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]].
&lt;ref name="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCoordinates.html" /&gt;

The angles are typically measured in [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] (°) or [[radian]]s (rad), where 360°&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2{{pi}} rad. Degrees are most common in geography, astronomy, and engineering, whereas radians are commonly used in mathematics and theoretical physics. The unit for radial distance is usually determined by the context.

When the system is used for physical three-space, it is customary to use positive sign for azimuth angles that are measured in the counter-clockwise sense from the reference direction on the reference plane, as seen from the zenith side of the plane. This convention is used, in particular, for geographical coordinates, where the "zenith" direction is [[north]] and positive azimuth (longitude) angles are measured eastwards from some [[prime meridian]].

=== Unique coordinates ===

Any spherical coordinate triplet {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}} specifies a single point of three-dimensional space. On the other hand, every point has infinitely many equivalent spherical coordinates. One can add or subtract any number of full turns to either angular measure without changing the angles themselves, and therefore without changing the point. It is also convenient, in many contexts, to allow negative radial distances, with the convention that {{math|(−''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}} is equivalent to {{math|(''r'', ''θ'' + 180°, ''φ'')}} for any {{mvar|r}}, {{mvar|θ}}, and {{mvar|φ}}. Moreover, {{math|(''r'', −''θ'', ''φ'')}} is equivalent to {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'' + 180°)}}.

If it is necessary to define a unique set of spherical coordinates for each point, one must restrict their ranges. A common choice is:

: {{math|''r'' ≥ 0}}
: {{math|0° ≤ ''θ'' ≤ 180° (π rad)}}
: {{math|0° ≤ ''φ'' &lt; 360° (2π rad)}}

However, the azimuth {{mvar|φ}} is often restricted to the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{nowrap|(−180°, +180°]}}, or {{nowrap|(−{{pi}}, +{{pi}}]}} in radians, instead of {{nowrap|[0, 360°)}}. This is the standard convention for geographic longitude.

The range {{nowrap|[0°, 180°]}} for inclination is equivalent to {{nowrap|[−90°, +90°]}} for elevation (latitude).

Even with these restrictions, if {{mvar|θ}} is 0° or 180° (elevation is 90° or −90°) then the azimuth angle is arbitrary; and if {{mvar|r}} is zero, both azimuth and inclination/elevation are arbitrary. To make the coordinates unique, one can use the convention that in these cases the arbitrary coordinates are zero.

=== Plotting ===

To plot a dot from its spherical coordinates {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}}, where {{mvar|θ}} is inclination, move {{mvar|r}} units from the origin in the zenith direction, rotate by {{mvar|θ}} about the origin towards the azimuth reference direction, and rotate by {{mvar|φ}} about the zenith in the proper direction.

== Applications ==

The [[geographic coordinate system]] uses the azimuth and elevation of the spherical coordinate system to express locations on Earth, calling them respectively [[longitude]] and [[latitude]]. Just as the two-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]] is useful on the plane, a two-dimensional spherical coordinate system is useful on the surface of a sphere. In this system, the sphere is taken as a unit sphere, so the radius is unity and can generally be ignored. This simplification can also be very useful when dealing with objects such as [[Rotation matrix|rotational matrices]].

Spherical coordinates are useful in analyzing systems that have some degree of symmetry about a point, such as [[multiple integral|volume integrals]] inside a sphere, the potential energy field surrounding a concentrated mass or charge, or global weather simulation in a planet's atmosphere. A sphere that has the Cartesian equation {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} has the simple equation {{math|''r'' {{=}} ''c''}} in spherical coordinates.

Two important [[partial differential equations]] that arise in many physical problems, [[Laplace's equation]] and the [[Helmholtz equation]], allow a [[separation of variables]] in spherical coordinates. The angular portions of the solutions to such equations take the form of [[spherical harmonics]].

Another application is ergonomic design, where {{mvar|r}} is the arm length of a stationary person and the angles describe the direction of the arm as it reaches out.

[[Image:Bosch 36W column loudspeaker polar pattern.png|thumb|The output pattern of an industrial [[loudspeaker]] shown using spherical polar plots taken at six frequencies]]
Three dimensional modeling of [[loudspeaker]] output patterns can be used to predict their performance. A number of polar plots are required, taken at a wide selection of frequencies, as the pattern changes greatly with frequency. Polar plots help to show that many loudspeakers tend toward omnidirectionality at lower frequencies.

The spherical coordinate system is also commonly used in 3D [[game development]] to rotate the camera around the player's position.

=== In geography ===

To a first approximation, the [[geographic coordinate system]] uses elevation angle (latitude) in degrees north of the [[equator]] plane, in the range {{math|−90° ≤ ''φ'' ≤ 90°}}, instead of inclination. Latitude is either [[Latitude#Geocentric latitude|geocentric latitude]], measured at the Earth's center and designated variously by {{math|''ψ'', ''q'', ''φ''′, ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;}} or [[Latitude#Geodetic coordinates|geodetic latitude]], measured by the observer's local vertical, and commonly designated {{mvar|φ}}. The azimuth angle (longitude), commonly denoted by {{mvar|λ}}, is measured in degrees east or west from some conventional reference [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] (most commonly the [[IERS Reference Meridian]]), so its domain is {{math|−180° ≤ ''λ'' ≤ 180°}}. For positions on the [[Earth]] or other solid [[celestial body]], the reference plane is usually taken to be the plane perpendicular to the [[axis of rotation]]. &lt;!--Must explain the conventions for positive latitude and longitude--&gt;

The polar angle, which is 90° minus the latitude and ranges from 0 to 180°, is called [[colatitude]] in geography.

Instead of the radial distance, geographers commonly use [[altitude]] above or below some reference surface, which may be the [[sea level]] or "mean" surface level for planets without liquid oceans. The radial distance {{mvar|r}} can be computed from the altitude by adding the mean radius of the planet's reference surface, which is approximately {{convert|6,360|±|11|km|mi|0|abbr=in}} for Earth.

However, modern geographical coordinate systems are quite complex, and the positions implied by these simple formulae may be wrong by several kilometers. The precise standard meanings of latitude, longitude and altitude are currently defined by the [[World Geodetic System]] (WGS), and take into account the flattening of the Earth at the poles (about {{convert|21|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=or}}) and many other details.

=== In astronomy ===
In astronomy there are a series of [[Celestial coordinate system#Coordinate systems|spherical coordinate systems]] that measure the elevation angle from different [[Fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental planes]]. These reference planes are the observer's [[Horizontal coordinate system|horizon]], the [[Equatorial coordinate system#Spherical coordinates|celestial equator]] (defined by Earth's rotation), the plane of the [[Ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic]] (defined by Earth's orbit around the [[Sun]]), the plane of the earth terminator (normal to the instantaneous direction to the [[Sun]]), and the [[Galactic coordinate system|galactic equator]] (defined by the rotation of the [[Milky Way]]).

== Coordinate system conversions ==

{{also|List of common coordinate transformations#To spherical coordinates}}

As the spherical coordinate system is only one of many three-dimensional coordinate systems, there exist equations for converting coordinates between the spherical coordinate system and others.

=== Cartesian coordinates ===

The spherical coordinates of a point in the ISO convention (i.e. for physics: ''radius'' {{mvar|r}}, ''inclination'' {{mvar|θ}}, ''azimuth'' {{mvar|φ}}) can be obtained from its [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} by the formulae
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} r&amp;=\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \\ \theta &amp;= \arccos\frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}} = \arccos\frac{z}{r} \\ \varphi &amp;= \arctan \frac{y}{x} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse tangent denoted in {{math|''φ'' {{=}} arctan {{sfrac|''y''|''x''}}}} must be suitably defined, taking into account the correct quadrant of {{math|(''x'',''y'')}}. See the article on [[atan2]].

Alternatively, the conversion can be considered as two sequential [[Polar coordinate system#Converting between polar and Cartesian coordinates|rectangular to polar conversions]]: the first in the Cartesian {{mvar|xy}}-plane from {{math|(''x'',''y'')}} to {{math|(''R'',''φ'')}}, where {{mvar|R}} is the projection of {{mvar|r}} onto the {{mvar|xy}}-plane, and the second in the Cartesian {{mvar|zR}}-plane from {{math|(''z'',''R'')}} to {{math|(''r'',''θ'')}}. The correct quadrants for {{mvar|φ}} and {{mvar|θ}} are implied by the correctness of the planar rectangular to polar conversions.

These formulae assume that the two systems have the same origin, that the spherical reference plane is the Cartesian {{mvar|xy}}-plane, that {{mvar|θ}} is inclination from the {{mvar|z}} direction, and that the azimuth angles are measured from the Cartesian {{mvar|x}}-axis (so that the {{mvar|y}}-axis has {{math|''φ'' {{=}} +90°}}). If ''θ'' measures elevation from the reference plane instead of inclination from the zenith the arccos above becomes an arcsin, and the {{math|cos ''θ''}} and {{math|sin ''θ''}} below become switched.

Conversely, the Cartesian coordinates may be retrieved from the spherical coordinates (''radius'' {{mvar|r}}, ''inclination'' {{mvar|θ}}, ''azimuth'' {{mvar|φ}}), where {{math|''r'' ∈ {{closed-open|0, ∞}}}}, {{math|''θ'' ∈ {{closed-closed|0, π}}}}, {{math|''φ'' ∈ {{closed-open|0, 2π}}}}, by:

&lt;!--***PLEASE do not swap theta and phi - check the conventions***--&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} x&amp;=r \, \sin\theta \, \cos\varphi \\ y&amp;=r \, \sin\theta \, \sin\varphi \\ z&amp;=r \, \cos\theta\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--***PLEASE do not swap theta and phi - check the conventions***--&gt;

=== Cylindrical coordinates ===

{{main|Cylindrical coordinate system}}
&lt;!-- if you notice--rho and r are described opposite of convention here--someone with extra time could remedy this --&gt;

[[cylindrical coordinate system|Cylindrical coordinates]] (''radius'' {{mvar|ρ}}, ''azimuth'' &lt;!--radians--&gt; {{mvar|φ}}, ''elevation'' {{mvar|z}}) may be converted into spherical coordinates (''radius'' {{mvar|r}}, ''inclination'' {{mvar|θ}}, ''azimuth'' {{mvar|φ}}), by the formulas

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} r&amp;=\sqrt{\rho^2 + z^2} \\ \theta&amp;=\arctan\frac{\rho}{z}=\arccos\frac{z}{\sqrt{\rho^2 + z^2}} \\ \varphi&amp;=\varphi \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, the spherical coordinates may be converted into cylindrical coordinates by the formulae

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \rho &amp;= r \sin \theta \\ \varphi &amp;= \varphi \\ z &amp;= r \cos \theta \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These formulae assume that the two systems have the same origin and same reference plane, measure the azimuth angle {{mvar|φ}} in the same sense from the same axis, and that the spherical angle {{mvar|θ}} is inclination from the cylindrical {{mvar|z}}-axis.

== Integration and differentiation in spherical coordinates ==

The following equations assume that {{mvar|θ}} is inclination from the {{mvar|z}} (polar) axis (ambiguous since {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, and {{mvar|z}} are mutually normal):

The [[line element]] for an infinitesimal displacement from {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}} to {{math|(''r'' + d''r'', ''θ'' + d''θ'', ''φ'' + d''φ'')}} is

: &lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} = \mathrm{d}r\,\hat{\mathbf r} + r\,\mathrm{d}\theta \,\hat{\boldsymbol\theta } + r \sin{\theta} \, \mathrm{d}\varphi\,\mathbf{\hat{\boldsymbol\varphi}}.&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\hat{\mathbf r}
&amp;=\sin \theta \cos \varphi \,\hat{\mathbf x} +
\sin \theta \sin \varphi \,\hat{\mathbf y} +
\cos \theta \,\hat{\mathbf z}
\\[5px]
\hat{\boldsymbol\theta}
&amp;=\cos \theta \cos \varphi \,\hat{\mathbf x} +
\cos \theta \sin \varphi \,\hat{\mathbf y}
-\sin \theta \,\hat{\mathbf z}
\\[5px]
\hat{\boldsymbol\varphi}
&amp;=-\sin \varphi \,\hat{\mathbf x}
+ \cos \varphi \,\hat{\mathbf y}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
are the local orthogonal [[unit vectors]] in the directions of increasing {{mvar|r}}, {{mvar|θ}}, and {{mvar|φ}}, respectively,
and {{math|'''x̂'''}}, {{math|'''ŷ'''}}, and {{math|'''ẑ'''}} are the unit vectors in Cartesian coordinates.


The general form of the formula to prove the differential line element, is &lt;ref&gt;https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/74442/line-element-dl-in-spherical-coordinates-derivation-diagram/74503#74503&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}=\sum_i\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial x_i}\mathrm{dx_i}=\sum_i \left|\frac{\partial \mathbf{r} }{\partial x_i}\right| \frac{\frac{\partial \mathbf{r} }{\partial x_i} }
{\left|\frac{ \partial \mathbf{r} }{\partial x_i}\right|} \mathrm{dx_i}=\sum_i \left| \frac{\partial \mathbf{r} }{\partial x_i} \right| \mathrm{dx_i}\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}_i
&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the change in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}&lt;/math&gt; is decomposed into individual changes corresponding to changes in the individual coordinates. To apply this to the present case, you need to calculate how &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}&lt;/math&gt; changes with each of the coordinates. With the conventions being used, we have

&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{r}=\begin{bmatrix}r\sin\theta\cos\phi\\ r\sin\theta\sin\phi\\ r\cos\theta\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial\mathbf r}{\partial r}=\begin{bmatrix}\sin\theta\cos\phi \\ \sin\theta\sin\phi \\ \cos\theta\end{bmatrix} \,,
\frac{\partial\mathbf r}{\partial \theta}=\begin{bmatrix}r\cos\theta\cos\phi \\ r\cos\theta\sin\phi \\ -r\sin\theta\end{bmatrix} \,,
\frac{\partial\mathbf r}{\partial \phi}=\begin{bmatrix}-r\sin\theta\sin\phi \\ r\sin\theta\cos\phi \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Then the desired coefficients are the magnitudes of these vectors:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\left| \frac{\partial\mathbf r}{\partial r}\right| = 1 \\
\left| \frac{\partial\mathbf r}{\partial \theta}\right| = r \\
\left| \frac{\partial\mathbf r}{\partial \phi}\right| = r\sin\theta \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/74442/line-element-dl-in-spherical-coordinates-derivation-diagram/74503#74503&lt;/ref&gt;


The [[Surface integral|surface element]] spanning from {{mvar|θ}} to {{math|''θ'' + d''θ''}} and {{mvar|φ}} to {{math|''φ'' + d''φ''}} on a spherical surface at (constant) radius {{mvar|r}} is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}S_r=\left\|{\partial r\hat{\mathbf r} \over \partial \theta}\times {\partial r\hat{\mathbf r} \over \partial \varphi}\right\|\mathrm{d}\theta\,\mathrm{d}\varphi=r^2\sin\theta\,\mathrm{d}\theta\,\mathrm{d}\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the differential [[solid angle]] is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\Omega=\frac{\mathrm{d}S_r}{r^2}=\sin\theta\,\mathrm{d}\theta\,\mathrm{d}\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

The surface element in a surface of polar angle {{mvar|θ}} constant (a cone with vertex the origin) is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}S_\theta=r \sin\theta\,\mathrm{d}\varphi\,\mathrm{d}r.&lt;/math&gt;

The surface element in a surface of azimuth {{mvar|φ}} constant (a vertical half-plane) is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}S_\varphi=r\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[volume element]] spanning from {{mvar|r}} to {{math|''r'' + d''r''}}, {{mvar|θ}} to {{math|''θ'' + d''θ''}}, and {{mvar|φ}} to {{math|''φ'' + d''φ''}} is  ([[determinant]] of the [[Jacobian matrix]] of [[Partial derivative|partial derivatives]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}V =  \left |\frac{\partial(x,y,z)}{\partial (r,\theta,\phi)}\right| 
= r^2 \sin \theta \,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta\,\mathrm{d}\varphi = r^2 \, \mathrm{d}r \, \mathrm{d}\Omega.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for example, a function {{math|''f''(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}} can be integrated over every point in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; by the [[Multiple integral#Spherical coordinates|triple integral]]

: &lt;math&gt;\ \int\limits_{\varphi=0}^{2 \pi}\ \int\limits_{\theta=0}^{\pi}\ \int\limits_{r=0}^{\infty} f(r,\theta,\varphi) r^2 \sin \theta \,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta\,\mathrm{d}\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[del]] operator in this system leads to the following expressions for [[gradient]], [[divergence]], [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] and [[Laplacian]]:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla f = {} &amp;{\partial f \over \partial r}\hat{\mathbf r}
  + {1 \over r}{\partial f \over \partial \theta}\hat{\boldsymbol\theta}
  + {1 \over r\sin\theta}{\partial f \over \partial \varphi}\hat{\boldsymbol\varphi}, \\[8pt]
\nabla\cdot \mathbf{A} = {} &amp; \frac{1}{r^2}{\partial \over \partial r}\left( r^2 A_r \right) + \frac{1}{r \sin\theta}{\partial \over \partial\theta} \left( \sin\theta A_\theta \right) + \frac{1}{r \sin \theta} {\partial A_\varphi \over \partial \varphi}, \\[8pt]
\nabla \times \mathbf{A} = {} &amp; \frac{1}{r\sin\theta}\left({\partial \over \partial \theta} \left( A_\varphi\sin\theta \right)
    - {\partial A_\theta \over \partial \varphi}\right) \hat{\mathbf r} \\[8pt]
&amp; {} + \frac 1 r \left({1 \over \sin\theta}{\partial A_r \over \partial \varphi}
    - {\partial \over \partial r} \left( r A_\varphi \right) \right) \hat{\boldsymbol\theta} \\[8pt]
&amp; {} + \frac 1 r \left({\partial \over \partial r} \left( r A_\theta \right)
    - {\partial A_r \over \partial \theta}\right) \hat{\boldsymbol\varphi}, \\[8pt]
\nabla^2 f = {} &amp; {1 \over r^2}{\partial \over \partial r} \left(r^2 {\partial f \over \partial r}\right) + {1 \over r^2 \sin\theta}{\partial \over \partial \theta} \left(\sin\theta {\partial f \over \partial \theta}\right)
+ {1 \over r^2 \sin^2\theta}{\partial^2 f \over \partial \varphi^2} \\[8pt]
= {} &amp; \left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} + \frac{2}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\right)f + {1 \over r^2 \sin\theta}{\partial \over \partial \theta} \left(\sin\theta \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\right)f + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2\theta}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \varphi^2}f.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Kinematics ==

In spherical coordinates the position of a point is written

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = r \mathbf{\hat r}.&lt;/math&gt;

Its velocity is then

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \dot{r} \mathbf{\hat r} + r\,\dot\theta\,\hat{\boldsymbol\theta } + r\,\dot\varphi \sin\theta\,\mathbf{\hat{\boldsymbol\varphi}},&lt;/math&gt;

and its acceleration is

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf{a} &amp; = \left( \ddot{r} - r\,\dot\theta^2 - r\,\dot\varphi^2\sin^2\theta \right)\mathbf{\hat r} \\
&amp; {} + \left( r\,\ddot\theta + 2\dot{r}\,\dot\theta - r\,\dot\varphi^2\sin\theta\cos\theta \right) \hat{\boldsymbol\theta } \\
&amp; {} + \left( r\ddot\varphi\,\sin\theta + 2\dot{r}\,\dot\varphi\,\sin\theta + 2 r\,\dot\theta\,\dot\varphi\,\cos\theta \right) \hat{\boldsymbol\varphi}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of a constant {{mvar|φ}} or {{math|''θ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|π|2}}}}, this reduces to [[Polar coordinate system#Vector calculus|vector calculus in polar coordinates]].

The '''Tableau économique''' ({{IPA-fr|tablo ekɔnɔmik}}) or ''Economic Table'' is an economic model first described by French economist [[François Quesnay]] in 1758, which laid the foundation of the [[Physiocrats|Physiocratic]] school of economics.&lt;ref name="Spiegel 1983 p.189"&gt;Henry William Spiegel (1983) ''The Growth of Economic Thought'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Duke University Press. p.189&lt;/ref&gt;

Quesnay believed that trade and industry were not sources of wealth, and instead in his 1758 manuscript ''Tableau économique'' (Economic Table) argued that agricultural surpluses, by flowing through the economy in the form of rent, wages, and purchases were the real economic movers.
== The model ==
The model Quesnay created consisted of three economic movers. The "Proprietary" class consisted of only landowners. The "Productive" class consisted of all agricultural laborers. The "Sterile" class is made up of artisans and merchants. The flow of production and/or cash between the three classes started with the Proprietary class because they own the land and they buy from both of the other classes. The process has these steps (consult Figure 1).

#The farmer produces 1,500 food on land leased from the landlord. Of that 1,500, he retains 600 food to feed himself, his livestock, and any laborers he hires. He sells the remaining 900 in the market for $1 per unit of food. He keeps $300 ($150 for himself, $150 for his laborer) to buy non-farm goods (clothes, household goods, etc.) from the merchants and artisans. This produces $600 of net profit, to which Quesnay refers as ''product net''.&lt;ref name="Spiegel 1983 p.189"/&gt;
#The artisan produces 750 units of crafts. To produce at that level, he needs 300 units of food and 150 units of foreign goods. He also has subsistence need of 150 units of food and 150 units of crafts to keep himself alive during the year. The total is 450 units of food, 150 units of crafts, and 150 units of foreign goods. He buys $450 of food from the farmer and $150 of goods from the merchant, and he sells 600 units of crafts at the market for $600. Because the artisan must use the cash he made selling his crafts to buy raw materials for the next year’s production, he has no net profit.
#The landlord is only a consumer of food and crafts and produces no product. His contribution to the production process is the redistribution of $600 in [[economic rent#Land rent|land rent]] the farmer pays for the use of naturally occurring land.  The landlord uses $300 of the rent to buy food from the farmer in the market and $300 to buy crafts from the artisan. Because he is purely a consumer, Quesnay considers the landlord the prime mover of economic activity. It is his desire to consume which causes him to expend his entire lease income on food and crafts and which provides income to the other classes.
#The merchant is the mechanism for exporting food in exchange for foreign imports. The merchant uses the $150 he received from the artisan to buy food from the market, and it is assumed that he takes the food out of the country to exchange it for more foreign goods.

The Tableau shows the reason why the Physiocrats disagreed with Cantillon about exporting food. The economy produces a surplus of food, and neither the farmer nor the artisan can afford to consume more than a subsistence level of food. The landlord is assumed to be consuming at a level of satiation; therefore, he cannot consume any more. Since food cannot be stored easily, it is necessary to sell it to someone who can use it. This is where the merchant provides value.

== Physiocratic interpretation ==
The merchant is not a source of wealth, however. The [[Physiocrats]] believed that “neither industry nor commerce generates wealth.”&lt;ref name="Charbit and Virmani 2002 p.858"&gt;Charbit and Virmani (2002) p.858&lt;/ref&gt; A “plausible explanation is that the Physiocrats developed their theory in light of the actual situation of the French economy…”&lt;ref name="Charbit and Virmani 2002 p.858"/&gt; France was an absolute monarchy with the land owners constituting 6-8% of the population and owning 50% of the land. (5, p.&amp;nbsp;859) Agriculture contributes 80% of the country’s wealth,&lt;ref name="Charbit and Virmani 2002 p.858"/&gt; and the non-land owning segment of the population “practises a subsistence agriculture that produces the essential minimum, with virtually all income being absorbed by food requirements.”&lt;ref name="Charbit and Virmani 2002 p.859"&gt;Charbit and Virmani (2002) p.859&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, exports consisted mostly of agricultural-based products, e.g. wine.&lt;ref name="Charbit and Virmani 2002 p.859"/&gt; Given the massive effect of agriculture on France’s economy, it was more likely they would develop an economic model that used it to the king’s advantage.

The Physiocrats are at the beginning of the anti-mercantilist movement. Quesnay’s argument against industry and international trade as alternatives to his doctrine is twofold. First, industry produces no gain in wealth; therefore, redirecting labor from agriculture to industry will in effect decrease the nation’s overall wealth. Additionally, population expands to fill available land and food supply; therefore, population must go down if the use of land does not produce food. Second, the basic premise of the Mercantilists is that a country must export more than it imports to gain wealth, but that assumes it has more of a tradeable resource than it needs for internal consumption. France did not have a colony with the ability to produce finished or semi-finished goods like England (e.g. India) or Holland (e.g. North America, Africa, South America). Its main colonial presence was in the Caribbean, southern North America, and southeast Asia, and like France, the colonies had agricultural-based economies. The only good which France had in enough excess to export was food; therefore, international trade based on industrial production would not yield as much wealth.

Quesnay was not anti-industry, however. He was just realistic in his assessment that France was not in good position to incubate a strong industrial market. His argument was that artisans and manufacturers would come to France only in proportion to the size of the internal market for their goods.&lt;ref name="Mueller 1978 p.153"&gt;Mueller (1978) p.153&lt;/ref&gt; Quesnay believed “a country should concentrate on manufacturing only to the extent that the local availability of raw materials and suitable labor enabled it to have a cost advantage over its overseas competitors.”&lt;ref name="Mueller 1978 p.153"/&gt; Anything above that amount should be purchased through trade.

== Legacy ==
The tableau économique is credited as the "first precise formulation" of interdependent systems in economics and the origin of the theory of the [[multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] in economics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YAIeAAAAIAAJ The multiplier theory], by Hugo Hegeland, 1954, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YAIeAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%2B%22tableau+economique%22&amp;pgis=1#search_anchor p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; An analogous table is used in the theory of [[money creation]] under [[fractional-reserve banking]] by relending of deposits, leading to the [[money multiplier]].

The [[wage-fund doctrine]] was derived from the tableau, then later rejected.
