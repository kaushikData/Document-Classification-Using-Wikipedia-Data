'''50''' ('''fifty''') is the [[natural number]] following [[49 (number)|49]] and preceding [[51 (number)|51]].

==In mathematics==
'''Fifty''' is the smallest number that is the sum of two non-zero [[square numbers]] in two distinct ways: 50 = 1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;de Koninck, J.M. (2009). ''Those fascinating numbers''. AMS Bookstore. p. 18. {{ISBN|0-8218-4807-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the sum of three squares, 50 = 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the sum of four squares, 50 = 6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is a [[Harshad number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005349|title=Sloane's A005349 : Niven (or Harshad) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no solution to the equation [[Euler's totient function|φ]](''x'') = 50, making 50 a [[nontotient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005277|title=Sloane's A005277 : Nonients|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor is there a solution to the equation ''x'' &amp;minus; φ(''x'') = 50, making 50 a [[noncototient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005278|title=Sloane's A005278 : Noncotients|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2481">'''Arthur Frederick Griffith''' (30 July 1880 – 25 December 1911)&lt;!-- Needs reference - , nicknamed "Pooze," --&gt; was a [[mental calculators|calculating prodigy]] born July 30, 1880 in [[Milford, Kosciusko County, Indiana]].  He could count to 40,000 by age five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Latest Mathematical Prodigy|journal=The Literary Digest|date=January 1900|volume=20|issue=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AE3QAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA83 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An illness at age seven resulted in [[epilepsy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryan|first=William Lowe|last2=Lindley|first2=Ernest Hiram|last3=Harter|first3=Noble|title=On the psychology of learning a life occupation|year=1941|publisher=Indiana University|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=QobzTuGTAcWtgQfy9NCBAg&amp;id=HC_fAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Arthur+F.+Griffith+epileptic&amp;q=epileptic#search_anchor|chapter=The Case of A. G., Lightning Calculator}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prevented him from attending school until age 10.  At age 12, he began to develop calculating short cuts.  He dropped out of school at age 17, but continued to study numbers and practice mental calculation on his own.

At age 19, he met Dr. Ernest Hiram Lindley, who invited Arthur to [[Indiana University]] to be studied in the [[psychology]] laboratory which had been established in 1892 by Dr. [[William Lowe Bryan]].  Bryan and Lindley took Arthur to the [[American Psychological Association]] meeting at [[Yale]] in December 1899, where he exhibited his skills and the I.U. professors presented a paper about their research of Arthur's case.  William Lowe Bryan, in 1900, presented a similar paper at the meeting of the International Congress of Psychology in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryan|first=William Lowe|authorlink=William Lowe Bryan |author2=Lindley,Ernest Hiram |author3=Harter, Noble|title=On the Psychology of Learning a Life Occupation (Indiana University Publications Science Series No. 11)|year=1941 |publisher=Indiana University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Griffith left Indiana University after five months, wrote a book of his methods, entitled ''The Easy and Speedy Reckoner'', and toured the [[vaudeville]] circuit until his death, allegedly of a stroke, in a [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] hotel room at age 31 on Christmas Day, 1911.

In [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]], '''biconditional introduction'''&lt;ref&gt;Hurley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Parker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copi and Cohen&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[rule of inference]]. It allows for one to [[inference|infer]] a [[Logical biconditional|biconditional]] from two [[Material conditional|conditional statements]]. The rule makes it possible to introduce a biconditional statement into a [[formal proof|logical proof]]. If &lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt; is true, and if &lt;math&gt;Q \to P&lt;/math&gt; is true, then one may infer that &lt;math&gt;P \leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is true. For example, from the statements "if I'm breathing, then I'm alive" and "if I'm alive, then I'm breathing", it can be inferred that "I'm breathing [[if and only if]] I'm alive". Biconditional introduction is the [[Converse (logic)|converse]] of [[biconditional elimination]]. The rule can be stated formally as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P \to Q, Q \to P}{\therefore P \leftrightarrow Q}&lt;/math&gt;

where the rule is that wherever instances of "&lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt;" and "&lt;math&gt;Q \to P&lt;/math&gt;" appear on lines of a proof, "&lt;math&gt;P \leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;" can validly be placed on a subsequent line.

== Formal notation ==
The ''biconditional introduction'' rule may be written in [[sequent]] notation:
:&lt;math&gt;(P \to Q), (Q \to P) \vdash (P \leftrightarrow Q)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metalogic]]al symbol meaning that &lt;math&gt;P \leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is a [[logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] when &lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q \to P&lt;/math&gt; are both in a proof;

or as the statement of a truth-functional [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[theorem]] of propositional logic:

:&lt;math&gt;((P \to Q) \land (Q \to P)) \to (P \leftrightarrow Q)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are propositions expressed in some [[formal system]].

for every choice of [[real number|real]] or [[complex number]]s (or more generally, elements of a [[commutative ring]]).
Setting ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''d&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', it gives the [[Lagrange's identity]], which is a stronger version of the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]] for the [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.

==The Binet–Cauchy identity and exterior algebra==
When {{math|1=''n'' = 3}}, the first and second terms on the right hand side become the squared magnitudes of [[Dot product|dot]] and [[cross product]]s respectively; in {{math|''n''}} dimensions these become the magnitudes of the dot and [[wedge product]]s. We may write it

:&lt;math&gt;(a \cdot c)(b \cdot d) = (a \cdot d)(b \cdot c) + (a \wedge b) \cdot (c \wedge d)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''a'''}}, {{math|'''b'''}}, {{math|'''c'''}}, and {{math|'''d'''}} are vectors. It may also be written as a formula giving the dot product of two wedge products, as 

:&lt;math&gt;(a \wedge b) \cdot (c \wedge d) = (a \cdot c)(b \cdot d) - (a \cdot d)(b \cdot c)\,,&lt;/math&gt;
which can be written as 
:&lt;math&gt;(a \times b) \cdot (c \times d) = (a \cdot c)(b \cdot d) - (a \cdot d)(b \cdot c)&lt;/math&gt;
in the {{math|1=''n'' = 3}} case.

In the special case {{math|1='''a''' = '''c'''}} and {{math|1='''b''' = '''d'''}}, the formula yields 
:&lt;math&gt;|a \wedge b|^2 = |a|^2|b|^2 - |a \cdot b|^2. &lt;/math&gt;

When both {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} are unit vectors, we obtain the usual relation
:&lt;math&gt;\sin^2 \phi = 1 - \cos^2 \phi&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''φ''}} is the angle between the vectors.

==Einstein notation==
A relationship between the [[Levi-Civita symbol|Levi–Cevita symbol]]s and the generalized [[Kronecker delta]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{k!}\varepsilon^{\lambda_1\cdots\lambda_k\mu_{k+1}\cdots\mu_{n}} \varepsilon_{\lambda_1\cdots\lambda_k\nu_{k+1}\cdots\nu_{n}} = \delta^{\mu_{k+1}\cdots\mu_{n}}_{\nu_{k+1}\cdots\nu_{n}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;(a \wedge b) \cdot (c \wedge d) = (a \cdot c)(b \cdot d) - (a \cdot d)(b \cdot c)&lt;/math&gt; form of the Binet–Cauchy identity can be written as 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(n-2)!}\left(\varepsilon^{\mu_1\cdots\mu_{n-2}\alpha\beta} ~ a_{\alpha} ~ b_{\beta} \right)\left( \varepsilon_{\mu_1\cdots\mu_{n-2}\gamma\delta} ~ c^{\gamma} ~ d^{\delta}\right) = \delta^{\alpha\beta}_{\gamma\delta} ~ a_{\alpha} ~ b_{\beta} ~ c^{\gamma} ~ d^{\delta}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
Expanding the last term,

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{1\le i &lt; j \le n} 
(a_i b_j - a_j b_i ) 
(c_i d_j - c_j d_i )
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
=
\sum_{1\le i &lt; j \le n} 
(a_i c_i b_j d_j + a_j c_j b_i d_i)
+\sum_{i=1}^n a_i c_i b_i d_i
-
\sum_{1\le i &lt; j \le n} 
(a_i d_i b_j c_j + a_j d_j b_i c_i)
-
\sum_{i=1}^n a_i d_i b_i c_i
&lt;/math&gt;

where the second and fourth terms are the same and artificially added to complete the sums as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
=
\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n
a_i c_i b_j d_j
-
\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n
a_i d_i b_j c_j.
&lt;/math&gt;

This completes the proof after factoring out the terms indexed by ''i''.

==Generalization==
A general form, also known as the [[Cauchy–Binet formula]], states the following:
Suppose ''A'' is an ''m''&amp;times;''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] and ''B'' is an ''n''&amp;times;''m'' matrix. If ''S'' is a [[subset]] of {1, ..., ''n''} with ''m'' elements, we write ''A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' for the ''m''&amp;times;''m'' matrix whose columns are those columns of ''A'' that have indices from ''S''. Similarly, we write ''B&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' for the ''m''&amp;times;''m'' matrix whose ''rows'' are those rows of ''B'' that have indices from ''S''. 
Then the [[determinant]] of the [[matrix product]] of ''A'' and ''B'' satisfies the identity
:&lt;math&gt;\det(AB) = \sum_{\scriptstyle S\subset\{1,\ldots,n\}\atop\scriptstyle|S|=m} \det(A_S)\det(B_S),&lt;/math&gt;
where the sum extends over all possible subsets ''S'' of  {1, ..., ''n''} with ''m'' elements.

We get the original identity as special case by setting
:&lt;math&gt;
A=\begin{pmatrix}a_1&amp;\dots&amp;a_n\\b_1&amp;\dots&amp; b_n\end{pmatrix},\quad
B=\begin{pmatrix}c_1&amp;d_1\\\vdots&amp;\vdots\\c_n&amp;d_n\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3865">In [[complex analysis]], the '''Blaschke product''' is a bounded [[analytic function]] in the open unit disc constructed to have zeros at a (finite or infinite) sequence of prescribed [[complex number]]s

:''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...

inside the [[unit disc]].
[[File:Blaschke-product.png|thumb|right|400px|Blaschke product, B(z), associated to 50 randomly chosen points in the unit disk. &lt;math&gt;\zeta=e^{2\pi i/3}&lt;/math&gt;. B(z) is represented as a [[Matplotlib]] plot, using a version of the [[Domain coloring]] method.]]

Blaschke products were introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Wilhelm Blaschke|first=Wilhelm |last=Blaschke|year=1915}}. They are related to  [[Hardy space]]s.

==Definition==

A sequence of points &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; inside the unit disk is said to satisfy the '''Blaschke condition''' when

&lt;!--
:&amp;Sigma; (1 &amp;minus; |''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|)
--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_n (1-|a_n|) &lt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Given a sequence obeying the Blaschke condition, the Blaschke product is defined as

&lt;!--
:''B''(''z'') = &amp;Pi; ''B''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z'')
--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B(z)=\prod_n B(a_n,z)&lt;/math&gt;

with factors

&lt;!--
:''B''(''a'',''z'') = |''a''|/''a''&amp;middot;(''z'' &amp;minus; ''a'')/(1 &amp;minus; ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''z'')
--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B(a,z)=\frac{|a|}{a}\;\frac{a-z}{1 - \overline{a}z}&lt;/math&gt;

provided ''a'' ≠ 0. Here &lt;math&gt;\overline{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[complex conjugate]] of ''a''. When ''a'' = 0 take ''B''(''0'',''z'') = ''z''.

The Blaschke product ''B''(''z'') defines a function analytic in the open unit disc, and zero exactly at the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (with [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] counted): furthermore it is in the Hardy class &lt;math&gt;H^\infty&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Conway (1996) 274&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; satisfying the convergence criterion above is sometimes called a '''Blaschke sequence'''.

==Szegő theorem==

A theorem of [[Gábor Szegő]] states that if ''f'' is in &lt;math&gt;H^1&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Hardy space]] with integrable norm, and if ''f'' is not identically zero, then the zeroes of ''f'' (certainly countable in number) satisfy the Blaschke condition.

==Finite Blaschke products==

Finite Blaschke products can be characterized (as analytic functions on the unit disc) in the following way: Assume that ''f'' is an analytic function on the open unit disc such that 
''f'' can be extended to a continuous function on the closed unit disc

: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Delta}= \{z \in \mathbb{C}\,|\, |z|\le 1\} &lt;/math&gt;

which maps the unit circle to itself.  Then ƒ is equal to a finite Blaschke product

:&lt;math&gt; B(z)=\zeta\prod_{i=1}^n\left({{z-a_i}\over {1-\overline{a_i}z}}\right)^{m_i} 
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&amp;zeta;'' lies on the unit circle and ''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] of the zero ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', |''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1. In particular, if ''&amp;fnof;'' satisfies the  condition above and has no zeros inside the unit circle then ''&amp;fnof;'' is constant (this fact is also a consequence of the [[maximum principle]] for [[harmonic function]]s, applied to the harmonic function log(|''&amp;fnof;''(''z'')|)).

[[File:SHARP ELSIMATE EL-W221.jpg|thumb|upright|An electronic pocket calculator with a [[liquid-crystal display]] (LCD) [[seven-segment display]] that can perform arithmetic operations]]
[[File:Casio-fx115ES-5564.jpg|thumb|upright|A modern scientific calculator with a [[dot matrix]] LCD]]
An '''electronic calculator''' is typically a portable [[Electronics|electronic]] device used to perform [[calculation]]s, ranging from basic [[arithmetic]] to complex [[mathematics]].

The first [[Solid-state electronics|solid-state electronic]] calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the [[Intel 4004]], the first [[microprocessor]], was developed by [[Intel]] for the Japanese calculator company [[Busicom]]. They later became used commonly within the [[petroleum industry]] (oil and gas).

Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, [[ISO/IEC 7810|credit-card-sized]] models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of [[integrated circuit]]s reduced their size and cost. By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.

Computer [[operating system]]s as far back as [[Ancient UNIX|early Unix]] have included interactive calculator [[Computer program|programs]] such as [[dc (computer program)|dc]] and [[hoc (programming language)|hoc]], and calculator functions are included in almost all [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) type devices, the exceptions being a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices.

In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets. For example, there are [[scientific calculator]]s which include [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] and [[statistics|statistical]] calculations. Some calculators even have the ability to do [[computer algebra]]. [[Graphing calculator]]s can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, or higher-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. {{As of|2016}}, basic calculators cost little, but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more.

In 1986, calculators still represented an estimated 41% of the world's general-purpose hardware capacity to compute information. By 2007, this diminished to less than 0.05%.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 "The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727161911/http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 |date=2013-07-27 }}, Martin Hilbert and Priscila López (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60–65; see also [http://www.martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html "free access to the study"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414233810/http://www.martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html/ |date=2016-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:CalculatorFractions-5550x.jpg|thumb|Scientific calculator displays of fractions and decimal equivalents]]

===Input===
[[Electronics|Electronic]] calculators contain a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] with [[Push-button|buttons]] for [[Numerical digit|digit]]s and [[arithmetic]]al operations; some even contain "00" and "000" buttons to make larger or smaller [[number]]s easier to enter. Most basic calculators assign only one digit or operation on each button; however, in more specific calculators, a button can perform multi-function working with [[key combination]]s.

===Display output===
Calculators usually have [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCD) as output in place of historical [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) displays and [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s (VFD); details are provided in the section ''[[#Technical improvements|Technical improvements]]''.

Large-sized [[Number|figures]] are often used to improve readability; while using [[decimal separator]] (usually a point rather than a [[comma]]) instead of or in addition to [[vulgar fraction]]s. Various symbols for [[Command (computing)|function commands]] may also be shown on the display. [[Fraction (mathematics)|Fractions]] such as {{math|{{frac|1|3}}}} are displayed as decimal [[approximation]]s, for example rounded to {{math|0.33333333}}. Also, some fractions (such as {{math|{{frac|1|7}}}}, which is {{math|0.14285714285714}}; to 14 [[significant figures]]) can be difficult to recognize in [[decimal]] form; as a result, many [[Scientific calculator|scientific]] calculators are able to work in vulgar fractions or [[mixed number]]s.

===Memory===
Calculators also have the ability to store numbers into [[computer memory]]. Basic calculators usually store only one number at a time; more specific types are able to store many numbers represented in [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s. The variables can also be used for constructing [[formula]]s. Some models have the ability to extend [[Computer memory|memory]] capacity to store more numbers; the extended [[memory address]] is termed an [[array data structure|array]] index.

===Power source===
Power sources of calculators are: [[electric battery|batteries]], [[Amorphous silicon#Solar cells|solar cells]] or [[mains electricity]] (for old models), turning on with a [[switch]] or button. Some models even have no turn-off button but they provide some way to put off (for example, leaving no operation for a moment, covering [[solar cell]] exposure, or closing their [[lid]]). [[Crank (mechanism)|Crank]]-powered calculators were also common in the early computer era.

===Key layout===
The following keys are common to most pocket calculators.  While the arrangement of the digits is standard, the positions of other keys vary from model to model; the illustration is an example.

==Internal workings==
In general, a basic [[Electronics|electronic]] calculator consists of the following components:&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis, ''The Pocket Calculator Book''. (London: Usborne, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Power source ([[mains electricity]], [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] and/or [[Amorphous silicon#Solar cells|solar cell]])
* [[Keypad]] (input device) – consists of keys used to input numbers and function commands ([[addition]], [[multiplication]], [[Square root|square-root]], etc.)
* Display panel (output device) – displays input numbers, commands and results. [[Liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs), [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s (VFDs), and [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) displays use [[Seven-segment display|seven segments]] to represent each [[Numerical digit|digit]] in a basic calculator. Advanced calculators may use [[dot matrix]] displays.
** A printing calculator, in addition to a display panel, has a printing unit that prints results in ink onto a roll of paper, using a printing mechanism.
* Processor [[Chipset|chip]] ([[microprocessor]] or [[central processing unit]]).

[[Clock rate]] of a processor [[Chipset|chip]] refers to the frequency at which the [[central processing unit]] (CPU) is running. It is used as an indicator of the processor's speed, and is measured in ''clock cycles per second'' or the [[International System of Units|SI]] unit [[Hertz|hertz (Hz)]]. For basic calculators, the speed can vary from a few hundred [[hertz]] to the [[kilohertz]] range.

===Example===
A basic explanation as to how calculations are performed in a simple four-function calculator:

To perform the calculation {{nowrap|25 + 9}}, one presses keys in the following sequence on most calculators: {{key press|2}}&amp;nbsp;{{key press|5}}&amp;nbsp;{{key press|+}}&amp;nbsp;{{key press|9}}&amp;nbsp;{{key press|{{=}}}}.

:* When {{key press|2}}&amp;nbsp;{{key press|5}} is entered, it is picked up by the scanning unit; the number 25 is encoded and sent to the X register;
:* Next, when the {{key press|+}} key is pressed, the "[[addition]]" instruction is also encoded and sent to the flag or [[status register]];
:* The second number {{Key press|9}} is encoded and sent to the X register. This "pushes" (shifts) the first number out into the Y register;
:* When the {{key press|{{=}}}} key is pressed, a "message" (signal) from the flag or [[status register]] tells the permanent or [[non-volatile memory]] that the operation to be done is "[[addition]]";
:* The numbers in the X and Y registers are then loaded into the [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] and the calculation is carried out following instructions from the permanent or non-volatile memory;
:* The answer, 34 is sent (shifted) back to the X register. From there, it is converted by the [[binary decoder]] unit into a decimal number (usually [[binary-coded decimal]]), and then shown on the display panel.

Other functions are usually performed using repeated additions or subtractions.

====Numeric representation====
{{Main|Binary-coded decimal}}

Most pocket calculators do all their calculations in BCD rather than a [[floating-point representation]].  BCD is common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed, especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic, and not containing a microprocessor. By employing BCD, the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub-circuit. This matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware—a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical [[seven-segment display]]s to build a metering circuit, for example. If the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary, interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry. Therefore, in cases where the calculations are relatively simple, working throughout with BCD can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to and from binary.

The same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor. Often, smaller code results when representing numbers internally in BCD format, since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors. For these applications, some small processors feature BCD arithmetic modes, which assist when writing routines that manipulate BCD quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=University of Alicante |title=A Cordic-based Architecture for High Performance Decimal Calculations |url=http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/11826/1/VF-016519.pdf |publisher=[[IEEE]] |access-date=2015-08-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235832/http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/11826/1/VF-016519.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Decimal CORDIC Rotation based on Selection by Rounding: Algorithm and Architecture |url=http://faculties.sbu.ac.ir/~jaberipur/Papers/Journals/19.pdf |publisher=[[British Computer Society]] |access-date=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where calculators have added functions (such as square root, or [[trigonometric functions]]), software [[algorithm]]s are required to produce high precision results. Sometimes significant design effort is needed to fit all the desired functions in the limited memory space available in the calculator [[Chipset|chip]], with acceptable calculation time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/72jun/jun72a2.pdf |title=David S. Cochran, '&amp;#39;Algorithms and accuracy in the HP35'&amp;#39;, '&amp;#39;Hewlett Packard Journal'&amp;#39;, June 1972 |format=PDF |date= |access-date=2013-10-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004225515/http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/72jun/jun72a2.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculators compared to computers==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
The fundamental difference between a calculator and [[computer]] is that a computer can be [[Computer programming|programmed]] in a way that allows the [[Computer program|program]] to take different [[Branch on condition|branches according to intermediate results]], while calculators are pre-designed with specific functions (such as [[addition]], [[multiplication]], and [[logarithm]]s) built in. The distinction is not clear-cut: some devices classed as [[programmable calculator]]s have [[Computer programming|programming]] functions, sometimes with support for [[programming language]]s (such as [[RPL (programming language)|RPL]] or [[TI-BASIC]]).

For instance, instead of a hardware multiplier, a calculator might implement [[floating point]] mathematics with code in [[read-only memory]] (ROM), and compute [[trigonometric function]]s with the [[CORDIC]] algorithm because CORDIC does not require much multiplication. [[Serial communication|Bit serial]] logic designs are more common in calculators whereas [[Parallel communication|bit parallel]] designs dominate general-purpose computers, because a bit serial design minimizes [[chipset|chip]] complexity, but takes many more [[clock signal|clock cycles]]. This distinction blurs with high-end calculators, which use processor chips associated with computer and embedded systems design, more so the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]], [[Motorola 68000|MC68000]], and [[ARM architecture|ARM]] architectures, and some custom designs specialized for the calculator market.

The first known tools used to aid arithmetic calculations were: bones (used to tally items), pebbles, and [[counting board]]s, and the [[abacus]], known to have been used by [[Sumer]]ians and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] before 2000&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Ifrah|2001|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the [[Antikythera mechanism]] (an "out of the time" [[Astronomy|astronomical]] device), development of computing tools arrived near the start of the 17th century: the [[Sector (instrument)|geometric-military compass]] (by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]), [[logarithm]]s and [[Napier bones]] (by [[John Napier|Napier]]), and the [[slide rule]] (by [[Edmund Gunter]]).

[[File:17th-century-mechanical-calculators.jpg|thumb|17th century mechanical calculators]]
In 1642, the [[Renaissance]] saw the invention of the [[mechanical calculator]] (by [[Wilhelm Schickard]]&lt;ref&gt;See for example, http://calculatorhistory.net&lt;/ref&gt; and several decades later [[Blaise Pascal]]&lt;ref&gt;Pascal's invention of the [[calculating machine]]. Pascal invented his machine just four hundred years ago, as a youth of nineteen. He was spurred to it by sharing the burden of arithmetical labor involved in his father's official work as supervisor of taxes at Rouen. He conceived the idea of doing the work mechanically, and developed a design appropriate for this purpose ; showing herein the same combination of pure science and mechanical genius that characterized his whole life. But it was one thing to conceive and design the machine, and another to get it made and put into use. Here were needed those practical gifts that he displayed later in his inventions....&lt;br&gt;
In a sense, Pascal's invention was premature, in that the mechanical arts in his time were not sufficiently advanced to enable his machine to be made at an economic price, with the accuracy and strength needed for reasonably long use. This difficulty was not overcome until well on into the nineteenth century, by which time also a renewed stimulus to invention was given by the need for many kinds of calculation more intricate than those considered by Pascal. [[#NAT CHAP|S. Chapman, Magazine Nature]], pp.508,509 (1942)&lt;/ref&gt;), a device that was at times somewhat over-promoted as being able to perform all four [[arithmetic]] operations with minimal human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;"Pascal and Leibnitz, in the seventeenth century, and Diderot at a later period, endeavored to construct a machine which might serve as a substitute for human intelligence in the combination of figures" [https://books.google.com/books?id=Rf0IAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=arithmometer&amp;as_brr=1#v=onepage&amp;q=arithmometer The Gentleman's magazine, Volume 202, p.100] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106145057/https://books.google.com/books?id=Rf0IAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=arithmometer&amp;as_brr=1 |date=2017-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pascal's calculator]] could add and subtract two numbers directly and thus, if the tedium could be borne, multiply and divide by repetition. Schickard's machine, constructed several decades earlier, used a clever set of mechanised multiplication tables to ease the process of multiplication and division with the adding machine as a means of completing this operation. (Because they were different inventions with different aims a debate about whether Pascal or Schickard should be credited as the "inventor" of the adding machine (or calculating machine) is probably pointless.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://metastudies.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.SchicardvsPascal Pascal vs Schickard: An empty debate?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408215848/http://metastudies.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.SchicardvsPascal |date=2014-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Schickard and Pascal were followed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] who spent forty years designing a four-operation mechanical calculator, the [[stepped reckoner]], inventing in the process his [[leibniz wheel]], but who couldn't design a fully operational machine.&lt;ref&gt;In 1893, the German calculating machine inventor Arthur Burkhardt was asked to put Leibniz machine in operating condition if possible. His report was favorable except for the sequence in the carry {{cite book|last=Ginsburg|first=Jekuthiel|title=Scripta Mathematica|year=1933|publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC|isbn=978-0-7661-3835-3|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also five unsuccessful attempts to design a calculating clock in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Mechanical calculator#Calculating clocks: unsuccessful mechanical calculators]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th century saw the arrival of some notable improvements, first by [[Giovanni Poleni|Poleni]] with the first fully functional calculating clock and four-operation machine, but these machines were almost always ''one of the kind''. [[Luigi Torchi (inventor)|Luigi Torchi]] invented the first direct multiplication machine in 1834: this was also the second key-driven machine in the world, following that of James White (1822).&lt;ref&gt;Denis Roegel: [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=7763737 ''Before Torchi and Schwilgué, There Was White.''] In: ''IEEE Annals of the History of Computing,'' October–December 2016, pp. 92-93. Retrieved 2018-05-06.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 19th century and the [[Industrial Revolution]] that real developments began to occur. Although machines capable of performing all four arithmetic functions existed prior to the 19th century, the refinement of manufacturing and fabrication processes during the eve of the industrial revolution made large scale production of more compact and modern units possible. The [[Arithmometer]], invented in 1820 as a four-operation mechanical calculator, was released to production in 1851 as an adding machine and became the first commercially successful unit; forty years later, by 1890, about 2,500 arithmometers had been sold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arithmometre.org/NumerosSerie/PageNumerosSeriePayen.html |title=(retrieved on 01/02/2012) |language=fr |publisher=Arithmometre.org |date= |access-date=2013-10-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521075617/http://www.arithmometre.org/NumerosSerie/PageNumerosSeriePayen.html |archivedate=2013-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; plus a few hundreds more from two arithmometer clone makers (Burkhardt, Germany, 1878 and Layton, UK, 1883) and Felt and Tarrant, the only other competitor in true commercial production, had sold 100 [[comptometer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Felt|first=Dorr E.|title=Mechanical arithmetic, or The history of the counting machine|publisher=Washington Institute|location=Chicago|page=4|year=1916|url=https://archive.org/details/mechanicalarithm00feltrich|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703013921/https://archive.org/details/mechanicalarithm00feltrich|archivedate=2016-07-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It wasn't until 1902 that the familiar push-button user interface was developed, with the introduction of the Dalton Adding Machine, developed by James L. Dalton in the [[United States]].

In 1921, [[Edith Clarke]] invented the "Clarke calculator", a simple graph-based calculator for solving line equations involving hyperbolic functions. This allowed electrical engineers to simplify calculations for [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]] in [[power transmission lines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lott|first1=Melissa C.|title=The Engineer Who Foreshadowed the Smart Grid--in 1921|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/the-engineer-who-foreshadowed-the-smart-grid-in-1921/|website=Plugged In|publisher=Scientific American Blog Network|accessdate=14 August 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814232626/https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/the-engineer-who-foreshadowed-the-smart-grid-in-1921/|archivedate=14 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Curta]] calculator was developed in 1948 and, although costly, became popular for its portability. This purely mechanical hand-held device could do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. By the early 1970s electronic pocket calculators ended manufacture of mechanical calculators, although the Curta remains a popular collectable item.

===Development of electronic calculators===
The first [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computers, using firstly [[vacuum tube]]s and later [[transistor]]s in the logic circuits, appeared in the 1940s and 1950s. This technology was to provide a stepping stone to the development of electronic calculators.

The [[Casio]] Computer Company, in [[Japan]], released the Model ''14-A'' calculator in 1957, which was the world's first all-electric (relatively) compact calculator. It did not use electronic logic but was based on [[relay]] technology, and was built into a desk.
[[File:LED DISP.JPG|thumb|Early calculator [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) display from the 1970s ([[USSR]])]]

In October 1961, the world's first ''all-electronic desktop'' calculator, the British [[Bell Punch]]/Sumlock Comptometer [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|ANITA]] ('''A''' '''N'''ew '''I'''nspiration '''T'''o '''A'''rithmetic/'''A'''ccounting) was announced.&lt;ref&gt;"Simple and Silent", ''Office Magazine'', December 1961, p1244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'Anita' der erste tragbare elektonische Rechenautomat" [trans: "the first portable electronic computer"], ''Büromaschinen Mechaniker'', November 1961, p207&lt;/ref&gt; This machine used [[vacuum tube]]s, cold-cathode tubes and [[Dekatron]]s in its circuits, with 12 cold-cathode [[Nixie tube|"Nixie"]] tubes for its display. Two models were displayed, the Mk VII for continental Europe and the Mk VIII for Britain and the rest of the world, both for delivery from early 1962. The Mk VII was a slightly earlier design with a more complicated mode of multiplication, and was soon dropped in favour of the simpler Mark VIII. The ANITA had a full keyboard, similar to mechanical [[comptometer]]s of the time, a feature that was unique to it and the later [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] CS-10A among electronic calculators. The ANITA weighed roughly {{convert|33|lb|kg}} due to its large tube system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ball|first1=Guy|last2=Flamm|first2=Bruce|title=The History of Pocket Electronic Calculators|url=http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/history_of_electronic_calculat.html|website=vintagecalculators.com|publisher=[[Vintage Calculators Web Museum]]|access-date=8 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703140814/http://vintagecalculators.com/html/history_of_electronic_calculat.html|archivedate=3 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell Punch had been producing key-driven mechanical calculators of the comptometer type under the names "Plus" and "Sumlock", and had realised in the mid-1950s that the future of calculators lay in electronics. They employed the young graduate Norbert Kitz, who had worked on the early British [[Pilot ACE]] computer project, to lead the development. The ANITA sold well since it was the only electronic desktop calculator available, and was silent and quick.

The tube technology of the ANITA was superseded in June 1963 by the U.S. manufactured [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]] EC-130, which had an all-transistor design, a stack of four 13-digit numbers displayed on a {{convert|5|in|cm|adj=on}} [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT), and introduced [[Reverse Polish Notation]] (RPN) to the calculator market for a price of $2200, which was about three times the cost of an electromechanical calculator of the time. Like Bell Punch, Friden was a manufacturer of mechanical calculators that had decided that the future lay in electronics. In 1964 more all-transistor electronic calculators were introduced: [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] introduced the [[CS-10A]], which weighed {{convert|25|kg|lb}} and cost 500,000 yen (${{To USD|500000|JPN}}), and [[Industria Macchine Elettroniche]] of Italy introduced the IME 84, to which several extra keyboard and display units could be connected so that several people could make use of it (but apparently not at the same time).

[[File:Olivetti Programma 101 - Museo scienza e tecnologia Milano.jpg|thumb|The Italian [[Programma 101]], the first commercial programmable desktop computer, produced by [[Olivetti]] in 1964]]

There followed a series of electronic calculator models from these and other manufacturers, including [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Mathatronics]], [[Olivetti]], [[SCM Corporation|SCM]] (Smith-Corona-Marchant), [[Sony]], [[Toshiba]], and [[Wang Laboratories|Wang]]. The early calculators used hundreds of [[Bipolar junction transistor#Germanium transistors|germanium transistors]], which were cheaper than [[Transistor#Semiconductor material|silicon transistor]]s, on multiple circuit boards. Display types used were [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]], cold-cathode [[Nixie tube]]s, and [[filament lamp]]s. Memory technology was usually based on the [[delay line memory]] or the [[magnetic core memory]], though the Toshiba "Toscal" BC-1411 appears to have used an early form of [[dynamic RAM]] built from discrete components. Already there was a desire for smaller and less power-hungry machines.

The [[Olivetti]] [[Programma 101]] was introduced in late 1965; it was a stored program machine which could read and write magnetic cards and displayed results on its built-in printer. Memory, implemented by an acoustic delay line, could be partitioned between program steps, constants, and data registers. Programming allowed conditional testing and programs could also be overlaid by reading from magnetic cards. It is regarded as the first personal computer produced by a company (that is, a desktop '''electronic calculating machine''' programmable by non-specialists for personal use). The Olivetti Programma 101 won many industrial design awards.

The ''[[Monroe Epic]]'' programmable calculator came on the market in 1967. A large, printing, desk-top unit, with an attached floor-standing logic tower, it could be programmed to perform many computer-like functions. However, the only ''branch'' instruction was an implied unconditional branch (GOTO) at the end of the operation stack, returning the program to its starting instruction. Thus, it was not possible to include any [[conditional branch]] (IF-THEN-ELSE) logic. During this era, the absence of the conditional branch was sometimes used to distinguish a programmable calculator from a computer.

===1970s to mid-1980s===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Casio as-a ckt1 1c.jpg|thumb|Internal circuit with twelve Nixie tube display elements inside a 1960s desktop calculator]] --&gt;
The electronic calculators of the mid-1960s were large and heavy desktop machines due to their use of hundreds of [[transistor]]s on several circuit boards with a large power consumption that required an AC power supply. There were great efforts to put the logic required for a calculator into fewer and fewer [[integrated circuit]]s (chips) and calculator electronics was one of the leading edges of [[semiconductor]] development. U.S. semiconductor manufacturers led the world in [[Integrated circuit#SSI, MSI and LSI|large scale integration]] (LSI) semiconductor development, squeezing more and more functions into individual integrated circuits. This led to alliances between Japanese calculator manufacturers and U.S. semiconductor companies: [[Canon (company)|Canon Inc.]] with [[Texas Instruments]], [[Hayakawa Electric]] (later renamed [[Sharp Corporation]]) with North-American Rockwell Microelectronics (later renamed [[Rockwell International]]), [[Busicom]] with [[Mostek]] and [[Intel]], and [[General Instrument]] with [[Sanyo]].

====Pocket calculators====
{{Redirect|Pocket calculator|the song|Computer World}}

By 1970, a calculator could be made using just a few chips of low power consumption, allowing portable models powered from rechargeable batteries. The first portable calculators appeared in Japan in 1970, and were soon marketed around the world. These included the [[Sanyo]] ICC-0081 "Mini Calculator", the [[Canon (company)|Canon]] Pocketronic, and the [[Sharp QT-8B]] "micro Compet". The Canon Pocketronic was a development of the "Cal-Tech" project which had been started at [[Texas Instruments]] in 1965 as a research project to produce a portable calculator. The Pocketronic has no traditional display; numerical output is on thermal paper tape. As a result of the "Cal-Tech" project, Texas Instruments was granted master patents on portable calculators.

Sharp put in great efforts in size and power reduction and introduced in January 1971 the [[Sharp EL-8]], also marketed as the Facit 1111, which was close to being a pocket calculator. It weighed 1.59 pounds (721 grams), had a vacuum fluorescent display, rechargeable [[NiCad]] batteries, and initially sold for US $395.

However, the efforts in [[integrated circuit development]] culminated in the introduction in early 1971 of the first "calculator on a chip", the MK6010 by [[Mostek]],&lt;ref&gt;"Single Chip Calculator Hits the Finish Line", ''Electronics'', February 1, 1971, p19&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Texas Instruments later in the year. Although these early hand-held calculators were very costly, these advances in electronics, together with developments in display technology (such as the [[vacuum fluorescent display]], [[Light-emitting diode|LED]], and [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]]), led within a few years to the cheap pocket calculator available to all.

In 1971 [[Pico Electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spingal.plus.com/micro |title=Microprocessor History |publisher=Spingal.plus.com |date= |access-date=2011-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720142104/http://www.spingal.plus.com/micro/ |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[General Instrument]] also introduced their first collaboration in ICs, a full single chip calculator IC for the Monroe Royal Digital III calculator. Pico was a spinout by five GI design engineers whose vision was to create single chip calculator ICs. Pico and GI went on to have significant success in the burgeoning handheld calculator market.

The first truly pocket-sized electronic calculator was the [[Busicom]] LE-120A "HANDY", which was marketed early in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;"The one-chip calculator is here, and it's only the beginning", Electronic Design, February 18, 1971, p34.&lt;/ref&gt; Made in Japan, this was also the first calculator to use an LED display, the first hand-held calculator to use a single integrated circuit (then proclaimed as a "calculator on a chip"), the [[Mostek]] MK6010, and the first electronic calculator to run off replaceable batteries. Using four AA-size cells the LE-120A measures {{convert|4.9 x 2.8 x 0.9|in|mm}}.

The first American-made pocket-sized calculator, the Bowmar 901B (popularly termed ''The Bowmar Brain''), measuring {{convert|5.2 x 3.0 x 1.5|in|mm}}, came out in the Autumn of 1971, with four functions and an eight-digit red [[light-emitting diode|LED]] display, for $240, while in August 1972 the four-function [[Sinclair Executive]] became the first slimline pocket calculator measuring {{convert|5.4 x 2.2 x 0.35|in|mm}} and weighing {{convert|2.5|oz|g}}. It retailed for around £79 (${{To USD|79|GBR}}). By the end of the decade, similar calculators were priced less than £5 (${{To USD|5|GBR}}).

The first [[Soviet Union]] made pocket-sized calculator, the ''Elektronika B3-04'' was developed by the end of 1973 and sold at the start of 1974.

One of the first low-cost calculators was the [[Sinclair Cambridge]], launched in August 1973. It retailed for £29.95 (${{To USD|29.95|GBR}}), or £5 (${{To USD|5|GBR}}) less in kit form. The Sinclair calculators were successful because they were far cheaper than the competition; however, their design led to slow and inaccurate computations of [[transcendental function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://righto.com/sinclair Reversing Sinclair's amazing 1974 calculator hack – half the ROM of the HP-35], Ken Shirriff, 2013. See in particular the section "Limited performance and accuracy".

Meanwhile, [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) had been developing a pocket calculator. Launched in early 1972, it was unlike the other basic four-function pocket calculators then available in that it was the first pocket calculator with ''scientific'' functions that could replace a [[slide rule]]. The $395 [[HP-35]], along with nearly all later HP engineering calculators, used [[reverse Polish notation]] (RPN), also called postfix notation. A calculation like "8 plus 5" is, using RPN, performed by pressing {{key top|8}}, {{key top|Enter↑}}, {{key top|5}}, and {{key top|+}}; instead of the algebraic [[infix notation]]: {{key top|8}}, {{key top|+}}, {{key top|5}}, {{key top|{{=}}}}. It had 35 buttons and was based on Mostek Mk6020 chip.

The first Soviet ''scientific'' pocket-sized calculator the "B3-18" was completed by the end of 1975.

In 1973, [[Texas Instruments]] (TI) introduced the [[TI SR-10|SR-10]], (''SR'' signifying [[slide rule]]) an ''algebraic entry'' pocket calculator using [[scientific notation]] for $150. Shortly after the [[TI SR-11|SR-11]] featured an added key for entering [[Pi]] (π). It was followed the next year by the [[TI SR-50|SR-50]] which added log and trig functions to compete with the HP-35, and in 1977 the mass-marketed [[TI-30]] line which is still produced.

In 1978 a new company, [[Calculated Industries]] arose which focused on specialized markets. Their first calculator, the Loan Arranger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/CI/loanarranger2.htm |title=The Loan Arranger II |publisher=Mathcs.albion.edu |access-date=2011-07-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719134735/http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/CI/loanarranger2.htm |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1978) was a pocket calculator marketed to the Real Estate industry with preprogrammed functions to simplify the process of calculating payments and future values. In 1985, CI launched a calculator for the construction industry called the Construction Master&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/CI/CM.htm |title=Construction Master |publisher=Mathcs.albion.edu |access-date=2011-07-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719135006/http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/CI/CM.htm |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which came preprogrammed with common construction calculations (such as angles, stairs, roofing math, pitch, rise, run, and feet-inch fraction conversions). This would be the first in a line of construction related calculators.

====Programmable calculators====
{{Main|Programmable calculator}}
[[File:HP 65.jpg|thumb|The [[HP-65]], the first programmable pocket calculator (1974)]]
The first desktop ''programmable calculators'' were produced in the mid-1960s by [[Mathatronics]] and [[Casio]] (AL-1000). These machines were very heavy and costly. The first programmable pocket calculator was the [[HP-65]], in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. Two years later the [[HP-25C]] introduced ''[[continuous memory]]'', i.e., programs and data were retained in [[CMOS]] memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first ''[[alphanumeric]]'', programmable, ''expandable'' calculator, the [[HP-41]]C. It could be expanded with [[random access memory]] (RAM, for memory) and [[read-only memory]] (ROM, for software) modules, and peripherals like [[bar code]] readers, [[microcassette]] and [[floppy disk]] drives, paper-roll [[thermal printer]]s, and miscellaneous communication interfaces ([[RS-232]], [[HP-IL]], [[HP-IB]]).

The first Soviet programmable desktop calculator [[ISKRA 123]], powered by the power grid, was released at the start of the 1970s. The first Soviet pocket battery-powered programmable calculator, [[Elektronika]] ''[[B3-21]]'', was developed by the end of 1976 and released at the start of 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://electronika-5.ru/calc/doc/B3-21_pas.rar |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051719/http://electronika-5.ru/calc/doc/B3-21_pas.rar |archive-date=2017-12-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The successor of B3-21, the [[Elektronika B3-34]] wasn't backward compatible with B3-21, even if it kept the [[reverse Polish notation]] (RPN). Thus B3-34 defined a new command set, which later was used in a series of later programmable Soviet calculators. Despite very limited abilities (98 bytes of instruction memory and about 19 stack and addressable registers), people managed to write all kinds of programs for them, including [[adventure game]]s and libraries of calculus-related functions for engineers. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of programs were written for these machines, from practical scientific and business software, which were used in real-life offices and labs, to fun games for children. The [[Elektronika MK-52]] calculator (using the extended B3-34 command set, and featuring internal [[EEPROM]] memory for storing programs and external interface for EEPROM cards and other periphery) was used in Soviet spacecraft program (for [[Soyuz TM-7]] flight) as a backup of the board computer.

This series of calculators was also noted for a large number of highly counter-intuitive mysterious undocumented features, somewhat similar to "[[synthetic programming]]" of the American [[HP-41]], which were exploited by applying normal arithmetic operations to error messages, jumping to nonexistent addresses and other methods. A number of respected monthly publications, including the popular science magazine ''[[Nauka i Zhizn]]'' (''Наука и жизнь'', ''Science and Life''), featured special columns, dedicated to optimization methods for calculator programmers and updates on undocumented features for hackers, which grew into a whole esoteric science with many branches, named "[[yeggogology]]" ("еггогология"). The error messages on those calculators appear as a Russian word "YEGGOG" ("ЕГГОГ") which, unsurprisingly, is translated to "Error".

A similar hacker culture in the USA revolved around the [[HP-41]], which was also noted for a large number of undocumented features and was much more powerful than [[B3-34]].

====Technical improvements====
[[File:Solar-calculator.jpg|thumb|A calculator which runs on solar and battery power]]
Through the 1970s the hand-held electronic calculator underwent rapid development. The red LED and blue/green [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s consumed a lot of power and the calculators either had a short battery life (often measured in hours, so rechargeable [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium batteries]] were common) or were large so that they could take larger, higher capacity batteries. In the early 1970s [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs) were in their infancy and there was a great deal of concern that they only had a short operating lifetime. Busicom introduced the Busicom ''LE-120A "HANDY"'' calculator, the first pocket-sized calculator and the first with an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] display, and announced the Busicom ''LC'' with LCD. However, there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale. The first successful calculators with LCDs were manufactured by [[Rockwell International]] and sold from 1972 by other companies under such names as: Dataking ''LC-800'', Harden ''DT/12'', Ibico ''086'', Lloyds ''40'', Lloyds ''100'', Prismatic ''500'' (a.k.a. ''P500''), Rapid Data ''Rapidman 1208LC''. The LCDs were an early form using the ''Dynamic Scattering Mode DSM'' with the numbers appearing as bright against a dark background. To present a high-contrast display these models illuminated the LCD using a filament lamp and solid plastic light guide, which negated the low power consumption of the display. These models appear to have been sold only for a year or two.

A more successful series of calculators using a reflective DSM-LCD was launched in 1972 by [[Sharp Inc]] with the Sharp ''EL-805'', which was a slim pocket calculator. This, and another few similar models, used Sharp's ''Calculator On Substrate'' (COS) technology. An extension of one glass plate needed for the liquid crystal display was used as a substrate to mount the needed chips based on a new hybrid technology. The COS technology may have been too costly since it was only used in a few models before Sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards.

[[File:Braun 4856 solar card calculator, 2.jpg|thumb|Credit-card-sized, solar-powered calculator by [[Braun (company)|Braun]] (1987)]]
In the mid-1970s the first calculators appeared with field-effect, ''twisted nematic'' (TN) LCDs with dark numerals against a grey background, though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them to cut out damaging [[ultraviolet]] rays. The advantage of LCDs is that they are passive light modulators reflecting light, which require much less power than light-emitting displays such as LEDs or VFDs. This led the way to the first credit-card-sized calculators, such as the [[Casio]] ''Mini Card LC-78'' of 1978, which could run for months of normal use on button cells.

There were also improvements to the electronics inside the calculators. All of the logic functions of a calculator had been squeezed into the first "calculator on a chip" [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) in 1971, but this was leading edge technology of the time and yields were low and costs were high. Many calculators continued to use two or more ICs, especially the scientific and the programmable ones, into the late 1970s.

The power consumption of the integrated circuits was also reduced, especially with the introduction of [[CMOS]] technology. Appearing in the Sharp "EL-801" in 1972, the [[transistor]]s in the logic cells of CMOS ICs only used any appreciable power when they changed state. The [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] and [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays often required added driver transistors or ICs, whereas the LCDs were more amenable to being driven directly by the calculator IC itself.

With this low power consumption came the possibility of using [[solar cell]]s as the power source, realised around 1978 by calculators such as the Royal ''Solar 1'', Sharp ''EL-8026'', and Teal ''Photon''.

====Mass market phase====
At the start of the 1970s, hand-held electronic calculators were very costly, at two or three weeks' wages, and so were a luxury item. The high price was due to their construction requiring many mechanical and electronic components which were costly to produce, and production runs that were too small to exploit economies of scale. Many firms saw that there were good profits to be made in the calculator business with the margin on such high prices. However, the cost of calculators fell as components and their production methods improved, and the effect of economies of scale was felt.

By 1976, the cost of the cheapest four-function pocket calculator had dropped to a few dollars, about 1/20th of the cost five years before. The results of this were that the pocket calculator was affordable, and that it was now difficult for the manufacturers to make a profit from calculators, leading to many firms dropping out of the business or closing down. The firms that survived making calculators tended to be those with high outputs of higher quality calculators, or producing high-specification scientific and programmable calculators.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Mid-1980s to present===
[[File:Elektronika MK-52.JPG|thumb|The [[Elektronika MK-52]] was a programmable RPN-style calculator that accepted extension modules; it was manufactured in the [[Soviet Union]] from 1985 to 1992]]
The first calculator capable of symbolic computing was the [[HP-28C]], released in 1987. It could, for example, solve quadratic equations symbolically. The first [[graphing calculator]] was the [[Casio fx-7000G]] released in 1985.

The two leading manufacturers, HP and TI, released increasingly feature-laden calculators during the 1980s and 1990s. At the turn of the millennium, the line between a graphing calculator and a [[handheld computer]] was not always clear, as some very advanced calculators such as the [[TI-89]], the [[TI-92 series|Voyage 200]] and [[HP-49G]] could [[derivative|differentiate]] and [[integral|integrate]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, solve [[differential equation]]s, run [[word processing]] and [[Personal information manager|PIM]] software, and connect by wire or [[infrared|IR]] to other calculators/computers.

The [[HP-12C|HP 12c]] financial calculator is still produced. It was introduced in 1981 and is still being made with few changes. The HP 12c featured the [[reverse Polish notation]] mode of data entry. In 2003 several new models were released, including an improved version of the HP 12c, the "HP 12c platinum edition" which added more memory, more built-in functions, and the addition of the algebraic mode of data entry.

[[Calculated Industries]] competed with the [[HP-12C|HP 12c]] in the mortgage and real estate markets by differentiating the key labeling; changing the “I”, “PV”, “FV” to easier labeling terms such as "Int", "Term", "Pmt", and not using the [[reverse Polish notation]]. However, CI's more successful calculators involved a line of construction calculators, which evolved and expanded in the 1990s to present. According to Mark Bollman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mark Bollman |url=http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/Calculators.html |title=Mark-&gt;'s Calculator Collection |publisher=Mathcs.albion.edu |date= |access-date=2011-07-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719135244/http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/Calculators.html |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a mathematics and calculator historian and associate professor of mathematics at Albion College, the "Construction Master is the first in a long and profitable line of CI construction calculators" which carried them through the 1980s, 1990s, and to the present.

Personal computers often come with a calculator utility program that emulates the appearance and functions of a calculator, using the [[graphical user interface]] to portray a calculator. One such example is [[Calculator (Windows)|Windows Calculator]]. Most [[personal data assistant]]s (PDAs) and [[smartphone]]s also have such a feature.

==Use in education==
In most countries, [[student]]s use calculators for schoolwork. There was some initial resistance to the idea out of fear that basic or [[elementary arithmetic]] skills would suffer. There remains disagreement about the importance of the ability to perform calculations ''in the head'', with some curricula restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been obtained, while others concentrate more on teaching [[Approximation|estimation]] methods and problem-solving. Research suggests that inadequate guidance in the use of calculating tools can restrict the kind of mathematical thinking that students engage in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Thomas J.

'''Horace Chandler Davis''' (born August 12, 1926&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Tuck | first=Donald H. | authorlink=Donald H. Tuck | title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy | location=Chicago | publisher=[[Advent (publisher)|Advent]] | year=1974|isbn=0-911682-20-1 | page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ithaca, New York]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coolbeat.biz/item/053/the-nightmare.htm The Nightmare by Chan Davis: About the author]&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American-[[Canadians|Canadian]] mathematician, writer, and educator.

He was born in [[Ithaca, New York]], to parents [[Horace B. Davis]] and Marian R. Davis. In 1948 he married [[Natalie Zemon Davis]]; they have three children. He was a member of the [[CPUSA]] and he was dismissed and jailed for his beliefs.

He moved to Canada in 1962 and began teaching at the [[University of Toronto]]. A lecture in honour of his stand for his beliefs is now held at the university that dismissed him.

==Mathematics==
In 1950 he received a doctorate in mathematics from [[Harvard University]].

His principal research investigations involve [[linear algebra]] and [[operator theory]] in [[Hilbert space]]. Furthermore, he has made contributions to [[numerical analysis]], [[geometry]], and [[algebraic logic]]. He is one of the eponyms of the [[Davis–Kahan theorem]] and [[Bhatia–Davis inequality]] (along with [[Rajendra Bhatia]]). The [[Davis–Kahan–Weinberger dilation theorem]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/0719029 Chandler Davis, W. M. Kahan, and H. F. Weinberger Norm-Preserving Dilations and Their Applications to Optimal Error Bounds, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 19-3 (1982), pp. 445–469.]&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the landmark results in the dilation theory of Hilbert space operators and has found applications in many different areas. A PhD thesis titled "Backward Perturbation and Sensitivity Analysis of Structured Polynomial Eigenvalue Problem" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iitj.ac.in/iitf/web/publicationFiles/701.pdf B. Adhikari, Backward Perturbation and Sensitivity Analysis of Structured Polynomial Eigenvalue Problems, Ph.D. thesis, Department of Mathematics, IIT Guwahati, Guwahati, India, 2008.]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; is dedicated to this theorem. Davis has written around eighty research papers in mathematics.
Davis was a professor in the mathematics department of [[University of Michigan]], working alongside [[Wilfred Kaplan]].

He is currently one of the co-Editors-in-Chief of the ''[[Mathematical Intelligencer]]''.  In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2012-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
He is part of the 2019 class of fellows of the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/awm-fellows|title=2019 Class of AWM Fellows|publisher=[[Association for Women in Mathematics]]|accessdate=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction writing==

He began his writing career in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' in 1946. From 1946 through 1962 he produced a spate of science fiction stories, mostly published there. One of the earliest, published May 1946, was ''The Nightmare'', later the lead story in ''[[A Treasury of Science Fiction]]'', edited by [[Groff Conklin]]; it argued for a national policy of decentralizing industry to evade nuclear attacks by terrorists. He also issued the fanzine "Blitherings" in the 1940s.

He attended [[6th World Science Fiction Convention|Torcon I, the 6th]] [[World Science Fiction Convention]] in 1948, appeared at the 2010 [[SFContario]] [[science fiction convention]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfcontario.ca/program/program-descriptions.php "Chandler Davis in Fannish Conversation". ''SFContario 2010 Panel Descriptions''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123062824/http://www.sfcontario.ca/program/program-descriptions.php |date=November 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was Science Guest of Honor at the 2013 [[SFContario]] [[science fiction convention]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.analogsf.com/2013_11/events.shtml "Upcoming Events". ''Analog Science Fiction and Fact''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509222408/https://www.analogsf.com/2013_11/events.shtml |date=2016-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:Chandler Davis (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Davis in 1975.]]

Davis came from a radical family and has identified himself as a [[socialist]] and former member of the [[Communist Party of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truth-out.org/the-origin-americas-intellectual-vacuum65129 Share1163 Hedges, Chris. "The Origin of America’s Intellectual Vacuum" [[Truthout|''Truth-Out.org'']] November 15, 2010]''"It wasn’t a cinch I would be in the Communist Party, but in fact I was, starting in 1943 and then resigning soon after on instructions from the party because I was in the military service. This was part of the coexistence of the Communist Party with Roosevelt and the military. It would not disrupt things during the war. When I got out of the Navy I rejoined the Communist Party, but that lapsed in June of 1953. I never got back in touch with them. At the time I was subpoenaed I was technically an ex-Communist, but I did not feel I had left the movement and in some sense I never did."''&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis&amp;mdash;along with two other professors, Mark Nickerson and [[Clement Markert]]&amp;mdash;refused to cooperate with the [[House Unamerican Activities Committee]] and was subsequently dismissed from the [[University of Michigan]].  Davis was then sentenced to a six-month prison term where he was able to do some research. A paper from this era has the following acknowledgement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Research supported in part by the Federal Prison System. Opinions expressed in this paper are the author's and are not necessarily those of the [[Bureau of Prisons]].&lt;ref&gt;Page 181 in {{cite book | first=Chandler|last=Davis| &lt;!-- authorlink=Chandler Davis --&gt; | chapter=An extremum problem for plane convex curves | pages=181&amp;ndash;185 |editor=[[Victor L.

&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The Federal government released Davis from prison in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pseudopodium.org/repress/chandler-davis/DidTheRedHuntWin.html &amp;#8220;Shooting Rats in a Barrel&amp;#8221;: Did the Red-hunt Win?]&lt;/ref&gt;  After his release, Davis moved to Canada, where he currently resides.

In 1991, the University of Michigan Senate initiated the annual Davis, Markert, Nickerson Lecture on Academic and Intellectual Freedom.  Recent speakers have included: [[Cass Sunstein]] (2008), [[Nadine Strossen]] (2007), [[Bill Keller]] (2006), [[Floyd Abrams]] (2005), and [[Noam Chomsky]] (2004).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6039">In [[constructive mathematics]], '''Church's thesis''' ('''CT''') is an axiom stating that all total functions are [[computable function|computable]].  The axiom takes its name from the [[Church–Turing thesis]], which states that every [[effectively calculable function]] is a [[computable function]], but the constructivist version is much stronger, claiming that every function is computable.

The axiom CT is incompatible with [[classical logic]] in sufficiently strong systems. For example, [[Heyting arithmetic]] (HA) with CT as an addition axiom is able to disprove some instances of the [[law of the excluded middle]]. However, Heyting arithmetic is [[equiconsistent]] with [[Peano arithmetic]] (PA) as well as with Heyting arithmetic plus Church's thesis. That is, adding either the law of the excluded middle or Church's thesis does not make Heyting arithmetic inconsistent, but adding both does.

==Formal statement==
In first-order theories such as HA, which cannot quantify over functions directly, CT is stated as an axiom schema saying that any definable function is computable, using [[Kleene's T predicate]] to define computability. For each formula &amp;phi;(''x'',''y'') of two variables, the schema includes the axiom
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall x \; \exist y \; \phi(x,y)) \to (\exist e \; \forall x \;\exist y,u \; \mathbf{T}(e,x,y,u) \wedge \phi(x,y))&lt;/math&gt;
This axiom asserts that, if for every ''x'' there is a ''y'' satisfying &amp;phi; then there is in fact an ''e'' that is the [[Gödel number]] of a general recursive function that will, for every ''x'', produce such a ''y'' satisfying the formula, with some ''u'' being a Gödel number encoding a verifiable computation bearing witness to the fact that ''y'' is in fact the value of that function at ''x''.

In higher-order systems that can quantify over functions directly, CT can be stated as a single axiom saying that every function from the natural numbers to the natural numbers is computable.

==Relationship to classical logic==
The schema form of CT shown above, when added to constructive systems such as HA, implies the negation of the law of the excluded middle. As an example, it is a classical [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] that every Turing machine either halts or does not halt on a given input. Assuming this tautology, in sufficiently strong systems such as HA it is possible to form a function ''h'' that takes a code for a Turing machine and returns 1 if the machine halts and 0 if it does not halt. Then, from Church's Thesis one would conclude that this function is itself computable, but this is known to be false, because the Halting problem is not computably solvable. Thus HA and CT disproves some consequence of the law of the excluded middle.

The "single axiom" form of CT mentioned above, 
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall f)(\exists e)(\forall n)(\exists u)[ \mathbf{T}(e,n,f(n),u) ]&lt;/math&gt;,
quantifies over functions and says that every function ''f'' is computable (with an index ''e''). This axiom is consistent with some weak classical systems that do not have the strength to form functions such as the function ''f'' of the previous paragraph. For example, the weak classical system &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{RCA}_0&lt;/math&gt; is consistent with this single axiom, because &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{RCA}_0&lt;/math&gt; has a model in which every function is computable. However, the single-axiom form becomes inconsistent with the law of the excluded middle in any system that has sufficient axioms to construct functions such as the function ''h'' in the previous paragraph.

==Extended Church's thesis==
'''Extended Church's thesis (ECT)''' extends the claim to functions which are totally defined over a certain type of domain. It is used by the school of constructive mathematics founded by [[Andrey Markov (Soviet mathematician)|Andrey Markov Jr]]. It can be formally stated by the schema:

:&lt;math&gt;(\forall x \; \psi(x) \to \exist y \; \phi(x,y)) \to \exist f (\forall x \; \psi(x) \to \exist y,u \; \mathbf{T}(f,x,y,u) \wedge \phi(x,y))&lt;/math&gt;

In the above, &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is restricted to be ''almost-negative''. For first-order arithmetic (where the schema is designated &lt;math&gt;ECT_0&lt;/math&gt;), this means &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; cannot contain any [[disjunction]], and existential [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]] can only appear in front of &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_0&lt;/math&gt; (decidable) formulas.

This thesis can be characterised as saying that a sentence is true if and only if it is computably [[realisable]]. In fact this is captured by the following meta-theoretic equivalences:&lt;ref&gt;Troelstra, A. S. ''Metamathematical investigation of intuitionistic arithmetic and analysis''. Vol 344 of Lecture Notes in Mathematics; Springer, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;HA + ECT_0 \vdash (\phi \leftrightarrow (\exist n \; n \Vdash \phi))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(HA + ECT_0 \vdash \phi) \leftrightarrow (HA \vdash \exist n \; (n \Vdash \phi))&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;n \Vdash \phi&lt;/math&gt; stands for "&lt;math&gt;n \text{ realises } \phi&lt;/math&gt;". So, it is provable in &lt;math&gt;HA&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;ECT_0&lt;/math&gt; that a sentence is true iff it is realisable. But also, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is {{not a typo|provably}} true in &lt;math&gt;HA&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;ECT_0&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is {{not a typo|provably}} realisable in &lt;math&gt;HA&lt;/math&gt; without &lt;math&gt;ECT_0&lt;/math&gt;.

The second equivalence can be extended with [[Markov's principle]] (M) as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;(HA + ECT_0 + M \vdash \phi) \leftrightarrow (\exist n \; PA \vdash (\bar{n} \Vdash \phi))&lt;/math&gt;
So, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is {{not a typo|provably}} true in &lt;math&gt;HA&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;ECT_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; iff there is a number ''n'' which {{not a typo|provably}} realises &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;PA&lt;/math&gt;. The existential quantifier has to be outside &lt;math&gt;PA&lt;/math&gt; in this case, because PA is non-constructive and lacks the [[existence property]].

'''Ciprian Manolescu''' (born December 24, 1978) is a [[Romanian-American]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.ucla.edu/~cm/cv.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[mathematician]], working in [[gauge theory]], [[symplectic geometry]], and [[low-dimensional topology]]. He is currently a Professor of Mathematics at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].

==Biography==
Manolescu completed his first eight classes at [[School no. 11 Mihai Eminescu]] and his secondary education at [[Ion Brătianu National College (Pitești)|Ion Brătianu High School]] in [[Piteşti]]. He did his undergrad and Ph.D. at [[Harvard University]] under the direction of [[Peter B. Kronheimer]], and became a teaching fellow in the [[Math 55]] undergraduate course.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-take-Harvards-Math-55&lt;/ref&gt; He was the winner of the [[Morgan Prize]], awarded jointly by AMS-MAA-SIAM, in 2002. His undergraduate thesis was on ''Finite dimensional approximation in [[Seiberg–Witten gauge theory|Seiberg–Witten theory]]'', and his Ph.D. thesis topic was ''A spectrum valued TQFT from the Seiberg–Witten equations''.

In early 2013 he released a paper detailing a disproof of the Triangulation Conjecture for [[manifold]]s of dimension 5 and higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150113-a-proof-that-some-spaces-cant-be-cut/|title=A Proof That Some Spaces Can’t Be Cut|magazine=[[Quanta Magazine]]|date=13 January 2015|first=Kevin|last=Hartnett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
He was among the handful of recipients of the [[Clay Mathematics Institute|Clay Research Fellowship]] (2004–2008).

In 2012 he was awarded one of the ten prizes of the [[European Mathematical Society]] for his work on low-dimensional topology, and particularly for his role in the development of combinatorial [[Heegaard Floer homology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.6ecm.pl/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514123522/http://www.6ecm.pl/ |archivedate=2013-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected as a member of the 2017 class of [[Fellow]]s of the [[American Mathematical Society]] "for contributions to Floer homology and the topology of manifolds".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/ams-fellows/new-fellows 2017 Class of the Fellows of the AMS], [[American Mathematical Society]], retrieved 2016-11-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

When all sets under consideration are considered to be [[subset]]s of a given set {{math|''U''}}, the '''absolute complement''' of {{math|''A''}} is the set of elements in {{math|''U''}} but not in {{math|''A''}}.

The '''relative complement'''  of {{math|''A''}} with respect to a set {{math|''B''}}, also termed the '''difference''' of sets {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, written {{math|''B'' ∖ ''A''}}, is the set of elements in {{math|''B''}} but not in {{math|''A''}}.

==Absolute complement==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bayes' theorem]] and [[absolute set complement]] --&gt;

[[File:Venn1010.svg|250px|thumb|The '''absolute complement''' of {{mvar|A}} (left circle) in ''U'':
&lt;math&gt;A^c = U \setminus A&lt;/math&gt;.]]

===Definition===
If {{math|''A''}} is a set, then the '''absolute complement''' of {{math|''A''}} (or simply the '''complement of {{math|''A''}}''') is the set of elements not in {{math|''A''}}. In other words, if {{math|''U''}} is the [[universe (mathematics)|universe]] that contains all the elements under study, and there is no need to mention it because it is obvious and unique, then the absolute complement of {{math|''A''}} is the relative complement of {{math|''A''}} in {{math|''U''}}:&lt;ref&gt;The set other than {{math|''A''}} is thus implicitly mentioned in an absolute complement, and explicitly mentioned in a relative complement.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A^c = U \setminus A&lt;/math&gt;.

Formally:

:&lt;math&gt;A^c = \{ x\in U \mid x \notin A \}.&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute complement of {{math|''A''}} is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt;. Other notations include &lt;math&gt;\overline A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\complement_U A&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\complement A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Bou"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1970|p=E II.6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
* Assume that the universe is the set of [[integer]]s. If {{math|''A''}} is the set of odd numbers, then the complement of {{math|''A''}} is the set of even numbers. If {{math|''B''}} is the set of [[Multiple (mathematics)|multiples]] of 3, then the complement of {{math|''B''}} is the set of numbers [[Modular arithmetic|congruent]] to 1 or 2 modulo 3 (or, in simpler terms, the integers that are not multiples of 3).
* Assume that the universe is the [[standard 52-card deck]]. If the set {{math|''A''}} is the suit of spades, then the complement of {{math|''A''}} is the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of the suits of clubs, diamonds, and hearts. If the set {{math|''B''}} is the union of the suits of clubs and diamonds, then the complement of {{math|''B''}} is the union of the suits of hearts and spades.

===Properties===
Let {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} be two sets in a universe {{math|''U''}}. The following identities capture important properties of absolute complements:

: [[De Morgan's laws]]:&lt;ref name="Halmos-1960" /&gt;

::* &lt;math&gt;\left(A \cup B \right)^c=A^c \cap B^c.&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt;\left(A \cap B \right)^c=A^c\cup B^c.&lt;/math&gt;

: Complement laws:&lt;ref name="Halmos-1960" /&gt;

::* &lt;math&gt;A \cup A^c = U .&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt;A \cap A^c =\varnothing .&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt;\varnothing^c =U.&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt; U^c =\varnothing.&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt;\text{If }A\subseteq B\text{, then }B^c\subseteq A^c.&lt;/math&gt;
::*: (this follows from the equivalence of a conditional with its [[contrapositive]]).

: [[involution (mathematics)|Involution]] or double complement law:

::* &lt;math&gt;(A^c)^c=A.&lt;/math&gt;

: Relationships between relative and absolute complements:

::* &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B = A \cap B^c.&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt;(A \setminus B)^c = A^c \cup B.&lt;/math&gt;

: Relationship with set difference:
::* &lt;math&gt; A^c \setminus B^c = B \setminus A. &lt;/math&gt;

The first two complement laws above show that if {{math|''A''}} is a non-empty, [[proper subset]] of {{math|''U''}}, then {{math|{''A'', ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∁&lt;/sup&gt;}{{null}}}} is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of {{math|''U''}}.

===Definition===
If {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} are sets, then the '''relative complement''' of {{math|''A''}} in {{math|''B''}},&lt;ref name="Halmos-1960"&gt;{{harvnb|Halmos|1960|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; also termed the '''set difference''' of {{math|''B''}} and {{math|''A''}},&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|1979|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the set of elements in {{math|''B''}} but not in {{math|''A''}}.

[[File:Venn0010.svg|250px|thumb|The '''relative complement''' of {{math|''A''}} (left circle) in {{math|''B''}} (right circle):
&lt;math&gt;B \cap A^c = B \setminus A&lt;/math&gt;]]

The relative complement of {{math|''A''}} in {{math|''B''}} is denoted {{nowrap|{{math|''B'' ∖ ''A''}}}} according to the [[ISO 31-11#Sets|ISO 31-11 standard]]. It is sometimes written {{nowrap|{{math|''B'' − ''A''}}}}, but this notation is ambiguous, as in some contexts it can be interpreted as the set of all elements {{nowrap|{{math|''b'' − ''a''}}}}, where {{math|''b''}} is taken from {{math|''B''}} and {{math|''a''}} from {{math|''A''}}.

Formally:

: &lt;math&gt;B \setminus A = \{ x\in B \mid x \notin A \}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Examples===
* &lt;math&gt;\{ 1, 2, 3\} \setminus \{ 2,3,4\} = \{ 1 \}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\{ 2, 3, 4 \} \setminus \{ 1,2,3 \} = \{ 4 \} &lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[real number]]s and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[rational number]]s, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[irrational number]]s.

===Properties===
Let {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, and {{math|''C''}} be three sets. The following [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] capture notable properties of relative complements:

:* &lt;math&gt;C \setminus (A \cap B) = (C \setminus A) \cup (C \setminus B)&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;C \setminus (A \cup B) = (C \setminus A) \cap (C \setminus B)&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;C \setminus (B \setminus A) = (C \cap A) \cup (C \setminus B)&lt;/math&gt;,
:*:with the important special case &lt;math&gt;C \setminus (C \setminus A) = (C \cap A)&lt;/math&gt; demonstrating that intersection can be expressed using only the relative complement operation.
:* &lt;math&gt;(B \setminus A) \cap C = (B \cap C) \setminus A = B \cap (C \setminus A)&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;(B \setminus A) \cup C = (B \cup C) \setminus (A \setminus C)&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;A \setminus A = \empty&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;\empty \setminus A = \empty&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;A \setminus \empty = A&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;A \setminus U = \empty&lt;/math&gt;.

== LaTeX notation ==

In the [[LaTeX]] typesetting language, the command &lt;code&gt;\setminus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name="The Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List"&gt;[http://ctan.unsw.edu.au/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf] The Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List&lt;/ref&gt; is usually used for rendering a set difference symbol, which is similar to a [[backslash]] symbol. When rendered, the &lt;code&gt;\setminus&lt;/code&gt; command looks identical to &lt;code&gt;\backslash&lt;/code&gt; except that it has a little more space in front and behind the slash, akin to the LaTeX sequence &lt;code&gt;\mathbin{\backslash}&lt;/code&gt;. A variant &lt;code&gt;\smallsetminus&lt;/code&gt; is available in the amssymb package.

== Complements in various programming languages ==

Some programming languages allow for manipulation of [[set (computer science)|sets as data structures]], using these operators or functions to construct the difference of sets &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4769">In [[chaos theory]], the '''correlation dimension''' (denoted by ''ν'') is a measure of the [[dimensionality]] of the space occupied by a set of random points, often referred to as a type of [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref name="grassberger"&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Peter Grassberger]] and [[Itamar Procaccia]] | title=Measuring the Strangeness of Strange Attractors | journal=Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena | year=1983 | volume=9 | issue=1‒2 | pages=189‒208 | doi=10.1016/0167-2789(83)90298-1 | bibcode=1983PhyD....9..189G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grassberger2"&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Peter Grassberger]] and Itamar Procaccia | title=Characterization of Strange Attractors | journal=Physical Review Letters | year=1983 | volume=50 | issue=5 | pages=346‒349 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.50.346 | bibcode=1983PhRvL..50..346G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grassberger3"&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Peter Grassberger]] | title=Generalized Dimensions of Strange Attractors | journal=Physics Letters A | year=1983 | volume=97 | issue=6 | pages=227‒230 | doi=10.1016/0375-9601(83)90753-3|bibcode = 1983PhLA...97..227G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if we have a set of random points on the [[real number]] line between 0 and 1, the correlation dimension will be ''ν''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, while if they are distributed on say, a triangle embedded in three-dimensional space (or ''m''-dimensional space), the correlation dimension will be ''ν''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. This is what we would intuitively expect from a measure of dimension. The real utility of the correlation dimension is in determining the (possibly fractional) dimensions of fractal objects. There are other methods of measuring dimension (e.g. the [[Hausdorff dimension]], the [[box-counting dimension]], and the
[[information dimension]]) but the correlation dimension has the advantage of being straightforwardly and quickly calculated, of being less noisy when only a small number of points is available, and is often in agreement with other calculations of dimension.

For any set of ''N'' points in an ''m''-dimensional space

:&lt;math&gt;\vec x(i)=[x_1(i),x_2(i),\ldots,x_m(i)], \qquad i=1,2,\ldots N&lt;/math&gt;

then the [[correlation integral]] ''C''(''&amp;epsilon;'') is calculated by:

:&lt;math&gt;C(\varepsilon)=\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{g}{N^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is the total number of pairs of points which have a distance between them that is less than distance ''&amp;epsilon;'' (a graphical representation of such close pairs is the [[recurrence plot]]). As the number of points tends to infinity, and the distance between them tends to zero,  the correlation integral, for small values of&amp;nbsp;''&amp;epsilon;'', will take the form:

:&lt;math&gt;C(\varepsilon) \sim \varepsilon^\nu &lt;/math&gt;

If the number of points is sufficiently large, and evenly distributed, a [[log-log graph]] of the correlation integral versus ''&amp;epsilon;'' will yield an estimate of&amp;nbsp;''ν''. This idea can be qualitatively understood by realizing that for higher-dimensional objects, there will be more ways for points to be close to each other, and so the number of pairs close to each other will rise more rapidly for higher dimensions.

[[Peter Grassberger|Grassberger]] and Procaccia introduced the technique in 1983;&lt;ref name="grassberger"/&gt; the article gives the results of such estimates for a number of fractal objects, as well as comparing the values to other measures of fractal dimension. The technique can be used to distinguish between (deterministic) chaotic and truly random behavior, although it may not be good at detecting deterministic behavior if the deterministic generating mechanism is very complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeCoster | first1 = Gregory P. | last2 = Mitchell | first2 = Douglas W. | year = 1991 | title = The efficacy of the correlation dimension technique in detecting determinism in small samples | url = | journal = Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 221–229 | doi = 10.1080/00949659108811357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computability theory]] a '''cylindric numbering''' is a special kind of [[numbering (computability theory)|numbering]] first introduced by [[Yuri L. Ershov]] in 1973. 

If a numberings &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is [[reducibility (numbering)|reducible]] to &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; then there exists a computable function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\nu = \mu \circ f&lt;/math&gt;. Usually &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not [[injective]] but if &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a cylindric numbering we can always find an injective &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. 

== Definition ==

A numbering &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is called '''cylindric''' if 
:&lt;math&gt;\nu \equiv_1 c(\nu).&lt;/math&gt;
That is if it is [[one equivalent numbering|one-equivalent]] to its [[cylindrification]]

A set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is called '''cylindric''' if its [[indicator function]] 
:&lt;math&gt;1_S: \mathbb{N} \to \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; 
is a cylindric numbering.

== Examples ==

* every [[Gödel numbering]] is cylindric

== Properties ==

* cylindric numberings are [[idempotent]], &lt;math&gt;\nu \circ \nu = \nu&lt;/math&gt;

The '''dynamic aperture''' is the stability region of phase space in a circular accelerator.

==Dynamic aperture for hadrons==
In the case of protons or heavy ion accelerators, (or [[synchrotron]]s, or [[storage ring]]s), there is minimal [[radiation]], and hence the dynamics is [[Symplectic manifold|symplectic]].
For long term stability, tiny dynamical diffusion (or [[Arnold diffusion]]) can lead an initially stable orbit slowly into an unstable region.  This makes the dynamic aperture problem particularly challenging.  One may be considering stability over billions of turns.
A scaling law for Dynamic aperture vs. number of turns has been proposed by Giovannozzi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M. Giovannozzi, "Scaling law for Dynamic Aperture"|url=http://prst-ab.aps.org/abstract/PRSTAB/v15/i2/e024001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dynamic aperture for electrons==
For the case of electrons, the electrons will radiate which causes a damping effect.  This means that one typically only cares about stability over thousands of turns.

==Methods to compute or optimize dynamic aperture==
The basic method for computing dynamic aperture involves the use of a tracking code.  A model of the ring is built within the code that includes an integration routine for each magnetic element.  The particle is tracked many turns and stability is determined.

In addition, there are other quantities that may be computed to characterize the dynamics, and can be related to the dynamic aperture.  One example is the [[tune shift with amplitude]].

There have also been other proposals for approaches to enlarge dynamic aperture, such as &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=W. Wan, J. Cary, "Method of enlarging dynamic aperture"|url=http://prst-ab.aps.org/abstract/PRSTAB/v4/i8/e084001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernst Kötter''' was a German mathematician who graduated in 1884 from Berlin University.
His treatise ''"Fundamentals of a purely geometrical theory of [[algebraic plane curve]]s"'' gained the 1886 prize of the [[Berlin Royal Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Norman Fraser| title=Kötter's synthetic geometry of algebraic curves| journal=Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society|date=Feb 1888| volume=7| pages=46–61| url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=3146652&amp;jid=PEM&amp;volumeId=7&amp;issueId=-1&amp;aid=3131388&amp;bodyId=&amp;membershipNumber=&amp;societyETOCSession=| doi=10.1017/s0013091500030364}} Here: p.46&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1901, he published his report on ''"The development of [[synthetic geometry]] from [[Monge]] to [[Karl Georg Christian von Staudt|Staudt]] (1847)"'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Ernst Kötter| title=Die Entwickelung der Synthetischen Geometrie von Monge bis auf Staudt (1847)| year=1901 |url=http://gdz-lucene.tc.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gcs/gcs?&amp;action=pdf&amp;metsFile=PPN37721857X_0005&amp;divID=LOG_0035&amp;pagesize=original&amp;pdfTitlePage=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/pdftitle/?metsFile=PPN37721857X_0005%7C&amp;targetFileName=PPN37721857X_0005_LOG_0035.pdf&amp;}} (2012 Reprint as {{ISBN|1275932649}})&lt;/ref&gt;
it had been sent to the press as early as 1897, but completion was deferred by Kötter's appointment to [[Aachen University]] and a subsequent persisting illness.&lt;ref&gt;Kötter (1901), Preface, p.VIII&lt;/ref&gt;
He constructed a mobile wood model to illustrate the theorems of [[Dandelin spheres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung| volume=16 | year=1907 | title=Vermischtes (Miscellany) |page=82 |url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=PPN37721857X_0016&amp;DMDID=DMDLOG_0016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.rug.nl/models/Serie32_nr2.html Illustration] of [[Groningen University]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!---more notable facts yet to be gathered---&gt;

In a discussion with [[Schoenflies]] and Kötter, [[Hilbert]] reportedly uttered his famous quotation according to which [[point (geometry)|point]]s, [[Line (geometry)|line]]s, and [[plane (geometry)|plane]]s in geometry could be named as well ''"tables, chairs, and beer mugs"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Otto Blumenthal]]| title=Lebensgeschichte| year=1935| volume=3| pages=388–429| publisher=Julius Springer| editor=David Hilbert| series=Gesammelte Abhandlungen| url=http://gdz-lucene.tc.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gcs/gcs?action=pdf&amp;metsFile=PPN237834022&amp;divID=LOG_0001&amp;pagesize=original&amp;pdfTitlePage=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/pdftitle/?metsFile=PPN237834022%7C&amp;targetFileName=PPN237834022_LOG_0001.pdf&amp;}} Here: p.402-403&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2716">In [[mathematical logic]], '''formation rules''' are rules for describing which [[String (computer science)|strings]] of [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] formed from the [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] of a [[formal language]] are [[syntax (logic)|syntactically]] [[Validity (logic)|valid]] within the language. These rules only address the location and manipulation of the strings of the language. It does not describe anything else about a language, such as its [[semantics]] (i.e. what the strings mean). (See also [[formal grammar]]).

==Formal language==
{{Main|Formal language}}
A ''formal language'' is an organized [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[symbol]]s the essential feature being that it can be precisely defined in terms of just the shapes and locations of those symbols. Such a language can be defined, then, without any [[reference]] to any [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]s of any of its expressions; it can exist before any [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] is assigned to it—that is, before it has any meaning. A [[formal grammar]] determines which symbols and sets of symbols are [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formula]]s in a formal language.

== Formal systems ==
{{main|Formal system}}

A ''formal system'' (also called a ''logical calculus'', or a ''logical system'') consists of a formal language together with a [[deductive apparatus]] (also called a ''deductive system''). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of [[transformation rule]]s (also called ''inference rules'') or a set of [[axiom]]s, or have both. A formal system is used to [[Proof theory|derive]] one expression from one or more other expressions. Propositional and predicate calculi are examples of formal systems.

== Propositional and predicate logic ==
The formation rules of a [[propositional calculus]] may, for instance, take a form such that;

* if we take Φ to be a propositional formula we can also take {{not}}Φ to be a formula;
* if we take Φ and Ψ to be a propositional formulas we can also take (Φ {{and}}  Ψ), (Φ {{imp}}  Ψ), (Φ {{or-}}  Ψ) and (Φ {{eqv}}  Ψ) to also be formulas.

A [[predicate calculus]] will usually include all the same rules as a propositional calculus, with the addition of [[Quantifiers (logic)|quantifiers]] such that if we take Φ to be a formula of propositional logic and α as a [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] then we can take ({{all}}α)Φ and ({{exist}}α)Φ each to be formulas of our predicate calculus.

'''Haeckelites''' are three-fold coordinated networks of carbon atoms generated by a periodic arrangement of pentagons, hexagons and heptagons. They were first proposed by Humberto and Mauricio Terrones and their colleagues in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= New Metallic Allotropes of Planar and Tubular Carbon|year=2000 |journal= Physical Review Letters |volume=84|issue=8|pages=1716–1719 |doi=10.1103/physrevlett.84.1716|display-authors=etal |pmid=11017608|author1=Terrones |first1=H |last2=Terrones |first2=M |last3=Hernandez |first3=E |last4=Grobert |first4=N |last5=Charlier |first5=J.

They have not yet been synthesised in the laboratory, but have been the subject of a considerable amount of theoretical work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3749">The '''Hartley function''' is a measure of uncertainty, introduced by [[Ralph Hartley]] in 1928. If a sample from a finite set ''A'' uniformly at random is picked, the information revealed after the outcome is known is given by the Hartley function
:&lt;math&gt; H_0(A) := \mathrm{log}_b \vert A \vert ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{abs|''A''}} denotes the [[cardinality]] of ''A''.

If the [[base (exponentiation)|base]] of the [[logarithm]] is 2, then the unit of uncertainty is the [[Shannon (unit)|shannon]]. If it is the [[natural logarithm]], then the unit is the [[Nat (unit)|nat]]. Hartley used a [[base-ten logarithm]], and with this base, the unit of information is called the [[Hartley (unit)|hartley]] in his honor. It is also known as the Hartley entropy.

== Hartley function, Shannon entropy, and Rényi entropy ==
The Hartley function coincides with the [[Shannon entropy]] (as well as with the Rényi entropies of all orders) in the case of a uniform probability distribution. It is a special case of the [[Rényi entropy]] since:
:&lt;math&gt;H_0(X) = \frac 1 {1-0} \log \sum_{i=1}^{|X|} p_i^0 = \log |X|.&lt;/math&gt;

But it can also be viewed as a primitive construction, since, as emphasized by Kolmogorov and Rényi, the Hartley function can be defined without introducing any notions of probability (see ''Uncertainty and information'' by George J. Klir, p.&amp;nbsp;423).

==Characterization of the Hartley function==
The Hartley function only depends on the number of elements in a set, and hence can be viewed as a function on natural numbers. Rényi showed that the Hartley function in base 2 is the only function mapping natural numbers to real numbers that satisfies

# &lt;math&gt;H(mn) = H(m)+H(n)&lt;/math&gt; (additivity)
# &lt;math&gt;H(m) \leq H(m+1)&lt;/math&gt; (monotonicity)
# &lt;math&gt;H(2)=1&lt;/math&gt; (normalization)

Condition 1 says that the uncertainty of the Cartesian product of two finite sets ''A'' and ''B'' is the sum of uncertainties of ''A'' and ''B''. Condition 2 says that larger set has larger uncertainty.

==Derivation of the Hartley function==
We want to show that the Hartley function, log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''), is the only function mapping natural numbers to real numbers that satisfies

# &lt;math&gt;H(mn) = H(m)+H(n)\,&lt;/math&gt; (additivity)
# &lt;math&gt;H(m) \leq H(m+1)\,&lt;/math&gt; (monotonicity)
# &lt;math&gt;H(2)=1\,&lt;/math&gt; (normalization)

Let ''&amp;fnof;'' be a function on positive integers that satisfies the above three properties. From the additive property, we can show that for any integer ''n'' and ''k'',

:&lt;math&gt;f(n^k) = kf(n).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''a'', ''b'', and ''t'' be any positive integers. There is a unique integer ''s'' determined by

:&lt;math&gt;a^s \leq b^t \leq a^{s+1}. \qquad(1)&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;s \log_2 a\leq t \log_2 b \leq (s+1) \log_2 a \, &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{s}{t} \leq \frac{\log_2 b}{\log_2 a} \leq \frac{s+1}{t}.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, by monotonicity,

:&lt;math&gt;f(a^s) \leq f(b^t) \leq f(a^{s+1}). \, &lt;/math&gt;

Using equation (1), one gets

:&lt;math&gt;s f(a) \leq t f(b) \leq (s+1) f(a),\,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{s}{t} \leq \frac{f(b)}{f(a)} \leq \frac{s+1}{t}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;\left\vert \frac{f(b)}{f(a)} - \frac{\log_2(b)}{\log_2(a)} \right\vert \leq \frac{1}{t}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''t'' can be arbitrarily large, the difference on the left hand side of the above inequality must be zero,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(b)}{f(a)} = \frac{\log_2(b)}{\log_2(a)}.&lt;/math&gt;

So,

:&lt;math&gt;f(a) = \mu \log_2(a)\,&lt;/math&gt;

for some constant ''μ'', which must be equal to 1 by the normalization property.

Design of robust and reliable networks and [[network service]]s relies on an understanding of the [[network traffic|traffic]] characteristics of the network. Throughout history, different models of network traffic have been developed and used for evaluating existing and proposed networks and services.

Demands on [[computer network]]s are not entirely predictable. Performance modeling is necessary for deciding the [[quality of service]] (QoS) level. Performance models in turn, require accurate [[traffic model]]s that have the ability to capture the statistical characteristics of the actual traffic on the network. Many traffic models have been developed based on traffic measurement data. If the underlying traffic models do not efficiently capture the characteristics of the actual traffic, the result may be the under-estimation or over-estimation of the performance of the network. This impairs the design of the network. Traffic models are hence, a core component of any performance evaluation of networks and they need to be very accurate.

“Teletraffic theory is the application of mathematics to the measurement, modeling, and control of traffic in [[telecommunications network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Mathematics Meets the Internet|publisher=AMS|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199808/paxson.pdf|author=Willinger and Paxson|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of traffic modeling is to find stochastic processes to represent the behavior of traffic. Working at the Copenhagen Telephone Company in the 1910s, [[A. K. Erlang]] famously characterized telephone traffic at the call level by certain probability distributions for arrivals of new calls and their holding times. Erlang applied the traffic models to estimate the telephone switch capacity needed to achieve a given call blocking probability. The Erlang blocking formulas had tremendous practical interest for public carriers because telephone facilities (switching and transmission) involved considerable investments. Over several decades, Erlang’s work stimulated the use of queuing theory, and applied probability in general, to engineer the public switched [[telephone network]]. Teletraffic theory for packet networks has seen considerable progress in recent decades.&lt;ref name=parkwill&gt;{{cite book | last1=Park | first1=Kihong | last2=Willinger|first2=Walter|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/047120644X.fmatter_indsub/pdf|title=Self-similar network traffic and performance evaluation | publisher=Wiley | publication-place=New York | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-471-31974-0 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adas&gt;{{cite journal | last=Adas | first=A. | title=Traffic models in broadband networks | journal=IEEE Communications Magazine | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=35 | issue=7 | year=1997 | issn=0163-6804 | doi=10.1109/35.601746 | pages=82–89 | ref=harv}}

==Network traffic models usage==
Measurements are useful and necessary for verifying the actual [[network performance]]. However, measurements do not have the level of abstraction that makes traffic models useful. Traffic models can be used for hypothetical problem solving whereas traffic measurements only reflect current reality. In probabilistic terms, a traffic trace is a realization of a [[random process]], whereas a traffic model is a random process. Thus, traffic models have universality. A traffic trace gives insight about a particular traffic source, but a traffic model gives insight about all traffic sources of that type. Traffic models have three major uses. One important use of traffic models is to properly dimension network resources for a target level of [[Quality of service|QoS]]. It was mentioned earlier that Erlang developed models of [[voice call]]s to estimate telephone switch capacity to achieve a target call blocking probability. Similarly, models of packet traffic are needed to estimate the bandwidth and buffer resources to provide acceptable packet delays and [[packet loss]] probability. Knowledge of the average traffic rate is not sufficient. It is known from [[queuing theory]] that queue lengths increase with the variability of traffic.&lt;ref name="Kleinrock1975"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kleinrock | first=Leonard | title=Queueing systems | publisher=Wiley | publication-place=New York | year=1975 | isbn=978-0-471-49110-1 | language=de | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, an understanding of traffic burstiness or variability is needed to determine sufficient buffer sizes at nodes and link capacities.&lt;ref name="Barakat Thiran Iannaccone Diot 2003 pp. 2111–2124"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Barakat | first=C. | last2=Thiran | first2=P. | last3=Iannaccone | first3=G. | last4=Diot | first4=C. | last5=Owezarski | first5=P. | url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.2.8066&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Modeling internet backbone traffic at the flow level | journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=51 | issue=8 | year=2003 | issn=1053-587X | doi=10.1109/tsp.2003.814521 | pages=2111–2124}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second important use of traffic models is to verify network performance under specific traffic controls. For example, given a packet scheduling algorithm, it would be possible to evaluate the network performance resulting from different traffic scenarios. For another example, a popular area of research is new improvements to the TCP congestion avoidance algorithm. It is critical that any algorithm is stable and allows multiple hosts to share bandwidth fairly, while sustaining a high throughput. Effective evaluation of the stability, fairness, and throughput of new algorithms would not be possible without realistic source models. A third important use of traffic models is admission control. In particular, connection oriented networks such as ATM depends on admission control to block new connections to maintain QOS guarantees. A simple admission strategy could be based on the peak rate of a new connection; a new connection is admitted if the available bandwidth is greater than the peak rate. However, that strategy would be overly conservative because a variable bit-rate connection may need significantly less bandwidth than its peak rate. A more sophisticated admission strategy is based on effective bandwidths.&lt;ref name="Statistical Laboratory"&gt;{{cite web | title=Notes on effective bandwidths | website=Statistical Laboratory | url=http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~frank/eb.html | access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source traffic behavior is translated into an effective bandwidth between the peak rate and average rate, which is the specific amount of bandwidth required to meet a given QoS constraint. The effective bandwidth depends on the variability of the source.&lt;ref name=chen2007/&gt;

==Network traffic models steps==
Traffic modeling consists of three steps:
* (i) selection of one or more models that may provide a good description of the traffic type
* (ii) estimation of parameters for the selected models
* (iii) statistical testing for election of one of the considered models and analysis of its suitability to describe the traffic type under analysis.
Parameter estimation is based on a set of statistics (e.g. mean, variance, density function or auto covariance function, multifractal characteristics) that are measured or calculated from observed data. The set of statistics used in the inference process depends on the impact they may have in the main performance metrics of interest.&lt;ref name=nogueira&gt;{{cite journal | last=Nogueira | first=António | last2=Salvador | first2=Paulo | last3=Valadas | first3=Rui | last4=Pacheco | first4=António | journal=Telecommunication Systems | title=Modeling Network Traffic with Multifractal Behavior|publisher=Springer Nature | volume=24 | issue=2/4 | year=2003 | issn=1018-4864 | doi=10.1023/a:1026183318200 | pages=339–362 | ref=harv|url=
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7c27/a4732bc89057878b7bbf0db8772d2b13d6bd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network traffic models parameter==
In recent years several types of traffic behavior, that can have significant impact on network performance, were discovered: long-range dependence, [[self-similarity]] and, more recently, multifractality.
There are two major parameters generated by network traffic models: packet length distributions and packet inter-arrival distributions. Other parameters, such as routes, distribution of destinations, etc., are of less importance. Simulations that use traces generated by network traffic models usually examine a single node in the network, such as a router or switch; factors that depend on specific network topologies or routing information are specific to those topologies and simulations.&lt;ref name=arrowsmith&gt;{{cite web|author=D.K. Arrowsmith, R.J. Mondragon|title=Modelling Network Data Traffic|location=Queen Mary, University of London|url=http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~arrow/BrisComp06.pdf|year=2006| access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of packet size distribution is fairly well-understood today. Existing models of packet sizes have proven to be valid and simple. Most packet size models do not consider the problem of order in packet sizes. For example, a TCP datagram in one direction is likely to be followed by a tiny ACK in the other direction about half of one Round-Trip Time (RTT) later. The problem of packet inter-arrival distribution is much more difficult. Understanding of network traffic has evolved significantly over the years, leading to a series of evolutions in network traffic models.

==Self-similar traffic models==
One of the earliest objections to self-similar traffic models was the difficulty in mathematical analysis. Existing self-similar models could not be used in conventional queuing models. This limitation was rapidly overturned and workable models were constructed. Once basic self-similar models became feasible, the traffic modeling community settled into the “detail” concerns. TCP’s congestion control algorithm complicated the matter of modeling traffic, so solutions needed to be created. Parameter estimation of self-similar models was always difficult, and recent research addresses ways to model network traffic without fully understanding it.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;
[[File:Let us start from scratch.jpg|thumb|100px|Ilkka Norros]]
* [[Fractional Brownian motion]]:
When self-similar traffic models were first introduced, there were no efficient, analytically tractable processes to generate the models. [[Ilkka Norros]] devised a stochastic process for a storage model with self-similar input and constant bit-rate output. While this initial model was continuous rather than discrete, the model was effective, simple, and attractive.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;
* SWING:
All self-similar traffic models suffer from one significant drawback: estimating the self-similarity parameters from real network traffic requires huge amounts of data and takes extended computation. The most modern method, wavelet multi-resolution analysis, is more efficient, but still very costly. This is undesirable in a traffic model. SWING uses a surprisingly simple model for the network traffic analysis and generation. The model examines characteristics of users, Request-Response Exchanges (RREs), connections, individual packets, and the overall network. No attempt is made to analyze self-similarity characteristics; any self-similarity in the generated traffic comes naturally from the aggregation of many ON/OFF sources.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite web | last=Wilson | first=Michael L. | title=A Historical View of Network Traffic Models | website=wustl.edu |year=2006| url=https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse567-06/ftp/traffic_models2/ | access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pareto distribution]] process:
The Pareto distribution process produces independent and identically distributed (IID) inter-arrival times. In general if X is a random variable with a Pareto distribution, then the probability that X is greater than some number x is given by P(X &gt; x) = (x/x_m)-k for all x ≥ x_m where k is a positive parameter and x_m is the minimum possible value of Xi The probability distribution and the density functions are represented as:
F(t) = 1 – (α/t)β where α,β ≥ 0 &amp; t ≥ α
f(t) = βαβ t-β-1
The parameters β and α are the shape and location parameters, respectively. The Pareto distribution is applied to model self-similar arrival in packet traffic. It is also referred to as double exponential, power law distribution. Other important characteristics of the model are that the Pareto distribution has infinite variance, when β ≥ 2 and achieves infinite mean, when β ≤ 1.
* [[Weibull distribution]] process:
The Weibull distributed process is heavy-tailed and can model the fixed rate in ON period and ON/OFF period lengths, when producing self-similar traffic by multiplexing ON/OFF sources. The distribution function in this case is given by:
F(t) = 1 – e-(t/β)α t &gt; 0
and the density function of the weibull distribution is given as:
f(t) = αβ-α tα-1 e -(t/β)α t &gt; 0
where parameters β ≥ 0 and α &gt; 0 are the scale and location parameters respectively.
The Weibull distribution is close to a normal distribution. For β ≤ 1 the density function of the distribution is L shaped and for values of β &gt; 1, it is bell shaped. This distribution gives a failure rate increasing with time. For β &gt; 1, the failure rate decreases with time. At, β = 1, the failure rate is constant and the lifetimes are exponentially distributed.
* [[Autoregressive model]]s:
The Autoregressive model is one of a group of linear prediction formulas that attempt to predict an output y_n of a system based on previous set of outputs {y_k} where k &lt; n and inputs x_n and {x_k} where k &lt; n. There exist minor changes in the way the predictions are computed based on which, several variations of the model are developed. Basically, when the model depends only on the previous outputs of the system, it is referred to as an auto-regressive model. It is referred to as a Moving Average Model (MAM), if it depends on only the inputs to the system. Finally, Autoregressive-Moving Average models are those that depend both on the inputs and the outputs, for prediction of current output. Autoregressive model of order p, denoted as AR(p), has the following form:
Xt = R1 Xt-1 + R2 Xt-2 + ... + Rp Xt-p + Wt
where Wt is the white noise, Ri are real numbers and Xt are prescribed correlated random numbers. The auto-correlation function of the AR(p) process consists of damped sine waves depending on whether the roots (solutions) of the model are real or imaginary. Discrete Autoregressive Model of order p, denoted as DAR(p), generates a stationary sequence of discrete random variables with a probability distribution and with an auto-correlation structure similar to that of the Autoregressive model of order p.[3]
* [[Regression model]]s:
Regression models define explicitly the next random variable in the sequence by previous ones within a specified time window and a moving average of a white noise.[5]
* [[TES model]]s :
Transform-expand-sample (TES) models are non-linear regression models with modulo-1 arithmetic. They aim to capture both auto-correlation and marginal distribution of empirical data. TES models consist of two major TES processes: TES+ and TES–. TES+ produces a sequence which has positive correlation at lag 1, while TES– produces a negative correlation at lag 1.&lt;ref name="Jelenkovic1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jelenkovic | first=P.R. | last2=Melamed | first2=B. | title=Algorithmic modeling of TES processes | journal=IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=40 | issue=7 | year=1995 | issn=0018-9286 | doi=10.1109/9.400470 | pages=1305–1312|url=http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~predrag/mypub/TES95.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-self-similar traffic models==
Early traffic models were derived from telecommunications models and focused on simplicity of analysis. They generally operated under the assumption that aggregating traffic from a large number of sources tended to smooth out bursts; that burstiness decreased as the number of traffic sources increased.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;
* [[Poisson distribution]] model:
One of the most widely used and oldest traffic models is the Poisson Model. The memoryless Poisson distribution is the predominant model used for analyzing traffic in traditional telephony networks. The Poisson process is characterized as a renewal process. In a Poisson process the inter-arrival times are exponentially distributed with a rate parameter λ: P{An ≤ t} = 1 – exp(-λt). The Poisson distribution is appropriate if the arrivals are from a large number of independent sources, referred to as Poisson sources. The distribution has a mean and variance equal to the parameter λ.
The Poisson distribution can be visualized as a limiting form of the binomial distribution, and is also used widely in queuing models. There are a number of interesting mathematical properties exhibited by Poisson processes. Primarily, superposition of independent Poisson processes results in a new Poisson process whose rate is the sum of the rates of the independent Poisson processes. Further, the independent increment property renders a Poisson process memoryless. Poisson processes are common in traffic applications scenarios that consist of a large number of independent traffic streams. The reason behind the usage stems from Palm's Theorem which states that under suitable conditions, such large number of independent multiplexed streams approach a Poisson process as the number of processes grows, but the individual rates decrease in order to keep the aggregate rate constant. Nevertheless, it is to be noted that traffic aggregation need not always result in a Poisson process. The two primary assumptions that the Poisson model makes are:&lt;ref name=chandra&gt;{{cite web | last=Chandrasekaran | first=Balakrishnan | title=Survey of Network Traffic Models | website=Washington University in St. Louis - Computer Science &amp; Engineering at WashU | date=2006-11-27 | url=http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse567-06/ftp/traffic_models3/index.html | ref=harv | access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1. The number of sources is infinite
2. The traffic arrival pattern is random.
* [[Compound Poisson process|Compound Poisson traffic models]]:
In the compound Poisson model, the base Poisson model is extended to deliver batches of packets at once. The inter-batch arrival times are exponentially distributed, while the batch size is geometric Mathematically, this model has two parameters, λ, the arrival rate, and ρ in (0,1), the batch parameter. Thus, the mean number of packets in a batch is 1/ ρ, while the mean inter-batch arrival time is 1/ λ. Mean packet arrivals over time period t are tλ/ ρ.
The compound Poisson model shares some of the analytical benefits of the pure Poisson model: the model is still memoryless, aggregation of streams is still (compound) Poisson, and the steady-state equation is still reasonably simple to calculate, although varying batch parameters for differing flows would complicate the derivation.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;
* [[Markov model|Markov]] and Embedded Markov Models:
Markov models attempt to model the activities of a traffic source on a network, by a finite number of states. The accuracy of the model increases linearly with the number of states used in the model. However, the complexity of the model also increases proportionally with increasing number of states. An important aspect of the Markov model - the Markov Property, states that the next (future) state depends only on the current state. In other words, the probability of the next state, denoted by some random variable Xn+1, depends only on the current state, indicated by Xn, and not on any other state Xi, where i&lt;n. The set of random variables referring to different states {Xn} is referred to as a Discrete Markov Chain.
* [[Packet train]]s:
Another attempt at providing a bursty traffic model is found in Jain and Routhier’s Packet Trains model.&lt;ref name="Jain Routhier 1986 pp. 986–995"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jain | first=R. | last2=Routhier | first2=S. | title=Packet Trains--Measurements and a New Model for Computer Network Traffic | journal=IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=4 | issue=6 | year=1986 | issn=0733-8716 | doi=10.1109/jsac.1986.1146410 | pages=986–995}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model was principally designed to recognize that address locality applies to routing decisions; that is, packets that arrive near each other in time are frequently going to the same destination. In generating a traffic model that allows for easier analysis of locality, the authors created the notion of packet trains, a sequence of packets from the same source, traveling to the same destination (with replies in the opposite direction). Packet trains are optionally sub-divided into tandem trailers. Traffic between a source and a destination usually consists of a series of messages back and forth. Thus, a series of packets go one direction, followed by one or more reply packets, followed by a new series in the initial direction. Traffic quantity is then a superposition of packet trains, which generates substantial bursty behavior. This refines the general conception of the compound Poisson model, which recognized that packets arrived in groups, by analyzing why they arrive in groups, and better characterizing the attributes of the group. Finally, the authors demonstrate that packet arrival times are not Poisson distributed, which led to a model that departs from variations on the Poisson theme. The packet train model is characterized by the following parameters and their associated probability distributions:
*mean inter-train arrival time
*mean inter-car arrival time
*mean truck size (in the tandem trailer model)
*mean train size.
The train model is designed for analyzing and categorizing real traffic, not for generating synthetic loads for simulation. Thus, little claim has been made about the feasibility of packet trains for generating synthetic traffic. Given accurate parameters and distributions, generation should be straightforward, but derivation of these parameters is not addressed.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;

==Traffic models today==
[[NS-2]] is a popular network simulator;&lt;ref name="ns and nam Sourceforge home 2010"&gt;{{cite web | title=nsnam | website=ns and nam Sourceforge home | date=2010-04-05 | url=http://nsnam.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page | access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; PackMimeHTTP is a web traffic generator for NS-2, published in 2004. It does take long-range dependencies into account, and uses the [[Weibull distribution]]. Thus, it relies on [[Long tail|heavy tails]] to emulate true [[self-similarity]]. Over most time scales, the effort is a success; only a long-running simulation would allow a distinction to be drawn. This follows suggestions from where it is suggested that self-similar processes can be represented as a superposition of many sources each individually modeled with a heavy-tailed distribution. It is clear that self-similar traffic models are in the mainstream.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2248">In the theory of [[partial differential equation]]s, a partial [[differential operator]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; defined on an [[open subset]]  

:&lt;math&gt;U \subset{\mathbb{R}}^n&lt;/math&gt; 

is called '''hypoelliptic''' if for every [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; defined on an open subset  &lt;math&gt;V \subset U&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Pu&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;C^\infty&lt;/math&gt; ([[smooth function|smooth]]), &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; must also be &lt;math&gt;C^\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

If this assertion holds with &lt;math&gt;C^\infty&lt;/math&gt; replaced by [[Mathematical analysis|real analytic]], then &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''analytically hypoelliptic''. 

Every [[elliptic operator]] with &lt;math&gt;C^\infty&lt;/math&gt; coefficients is hypoelliptic. In particular, the [[Laplacian]] is an example of a hypoelliptic operator (the Laplacian is also analytically hypoelliptic). The [[heat equation]] operator 

:&lt;math&gt;P(u)=u_t - k\,\Delta u\,&lt;/math&gt; 

(where &lt;math&gt;k&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;) is hypoelliptic but not elliptic. The [[wave equation]] operator 

:&lt;math&gt;P(u)=u_{tt} - c^2\,\Delta u\,&lt;/math&gt; 

(where &lt;math&gt;c\ne 0&lt;/math&gt;) is not hypoelliptic.

It is a special case of an [[imaginary curve]].

An imaginary line is found in the [[complex projective plane]] P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(C) where points are represented by three [[homogeneous coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3),\quad x_i \isin C .&lt;/math&gt;

[[Boyd Patterson]] described the lines in this plane:&lt;ref&gt;Patterson 590&lt;/ref&gt;
:The locus of points whose coordinates satisfy a homogeneous linear equation with complex coefficients
:::&lt;math&gt; a_1\ x_1 +\  a_2\ x_2 \ + a_3\ x_3 \ =\  0&lt;/math&gt;
:is a straight line and the line is ''real'' or ''imaginary'' according as the coefficients of its equation are or are not proportional to three [[real number]]s.

[[Felix Klein]] described imaginary geometrical structures: "We will characterize a geometric structure as imaginary if its coordinates are not all real.:&lt;ref&gt;Klein 1928 p 46&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hatton:&lt;ref&gt;Hatton 1929 page 13, Definition 4&lt;/ref&gt;
:The locus of the [[double point]]s (imaginary) of the overlapping [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]s in which an overlapping involution pencil (real) is cut by real transversals is a pair of imaginary straight lines.
Hatton continues,
: Hence it follows that an imaginary straight line is determined by an imaginary point, which is a double point of an involution, and a real point, the vertex of the involution pencil.

In the theory of [[fair cake-cutting]], the '''individual-pieces set (IPS)'''
is a geometric object that represents all possible utility vectors in cake partitions.

== Example ==
Suppose we have a cake made of four parts. There are two people, Alice and George, with different tastes: each person values the different parts of the cake differently. The table below describes the parts and their values.

[[File:Individual Pieces Set.png|thumb]]
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
!        !! Chocolate !! Lemon !! Vanilla !! Cherries
|-
| Alice's value  || &lt;big&gt;18&lt;/big&gt;  || &lt;big&gt;9&lt;/big&gt; ||  &lt;big&gt;1&lt;/big&gt;  || &lt;big&gt;2&lt;/big&gt;
|-
| George's value || &lt;big&gt;18&lt;/big&gt; || &lt;big&gt;0&lt;/big&gt; ||  &lt;big&gt;4&lt;/big&gt;  || &lt;big&gt;8&lt;/big&gt;
|-
|}

The cake can be divided in various ways. Each division (Alice's-piece, George's-piece) yields a different utility vector (Alice's utility, George's utility). The IPS is the set of utility vectors of all possible partitions.

The IPS for the example cake is shown on the right.

== Properties ==
The IPS is a [[convex set]] and a [[compact set]]. This follows from the [[Dubins–Spanier theorems]].

With two agents, the IPS is symmetric across the middle point (in this case it is the point (15,15)). Take some int &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; on the IPS. This point comes from some partition. Swap the pieces between Alice and George. Then, Alice's new utility is 30 minus her previous utility, and George's new utility is 30 minus his previous utility, so the symmetric point &lt;math&gt;(30-x,30-y)&lt;/math&gt; is also on the IPS.

The top-right boundary of the IPS is the [[Pareto frontier]] – it is the set of all [[Pareto efficient]] partitions. With two agents, this frontier can be constructed in the following way:
* Order the pieces of the cake in ascending order of the marginal-utiltiy ratio (George's utility / Alice's-utility). In the above example, the order would be: Lemon (0), Chocolate (1), Vanilla+Cherries (4).
* Start at the point where all cake is given to George (0,30).
* Move each piece-of-cake in order from George to Alice; draw a line whose slope is the corresponding utility-ratio.
* Finish at the point where all cake is given to Alice (30,0).

== History ==
The IPS was introduced as part of the [[Dubins–Spanier theorems]] and used in the proof of [[Weller's theorem]]. The term "Individual Pieces set" was coined by [[Julius Barbanel]].&lt;ref name=Barbanel&gt;{{Cite Geometry of Efficient Fair Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lambert-series.png|thumb|right|360px|Function &lt;math&gt;S(q)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty  \frac {q^n}{1-q^n}&lt;/math&gt;, represented as a [[Matplotlib]] plot, using a version of the [[Domain coloring]] method&lt;ref&gt;http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/empet/Math/blob/master/DomainColoring.ipynb&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''Lambert series''', named for [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]], is a [[Series (mathematics)|series]] taking  the form

:&lt;math&gt;S(q)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \frac {q^n}{1-q^n}.&lt;/math&gt;

It can be resummed [[Formal series|formally]] by expanding the denominator:

:&lt;math&gt;S(q)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \sum_{k=1}^\infty q^{nk} = \sum_{m=1}^\infty b_m q^m &lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients of the new series are given by the [[Dirichlet convolution]] of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with the constant function 1(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1:

:&lt;math&gt;b_m = (a*1)(m) = \sum_{n\mid m} a_n. \,&lt;/math&gt;

This series may be inverted by means of the [[Möbius inversion formula]], and is an example of a [[Möbius transform]].

==Examples==
Since this last sum is a typical number-theoretic sum, almost any natural [[multiplicative function]] will be exactly summable when used in a Lambert series.  Thus, for example, one has

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty q^n \sigma_0(n) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{q^n}{1-q^n}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0(n)=d(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of positive [[divisor function|divisors]] of the number&amp;nbsp;''n''.

For the higher order [[divisor function|sigma functions]], one has

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty q^n \sigma_\alpha(n) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^\alpha q^n}{1-q^n}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is any [[complex number]] and

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\alpha(n) = (\textrm{Id}_\alpha*1)(n) = \sum_{d\mid n} d^\alpha \,&lt;/math&gt;
is the divisor function.

Additional Lambert series related to the previous identity include those for the variants of the 
[[Möbius function]] given below &lt;math&gt;\mu(n)&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;See the forum post [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/98174/is-mertens-function-negatively-biased| here] (or the article [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.1524.pdf| arXiv:1112.4911]) and the conclusions section of [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00611.pdf| this article] by Merca and Schmidt (2018) for usage of these two less standard Lambert series for the Moebius function in practical applications.&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(n)\,\frac{q^n}{1-q^n} = q.&lt;/math&gt;
Related Lambert series over the [[Moebius function]] include the following identities for any 
prime &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_{n \geq 1} \frac{\mu(n) q^n}{1+q^n} &amp; = q-2q^2 \\ 
\sum_{n \geq 1} \frac{\mu(\alpha n) q^n}{1-q^n} &amp; = -\sum_{n \geq 0} q^{\alpha^n}. 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The proof of the first identity above follows from a multi-section (or bisection) identity of these 
Lambert series generating functions in the following form where we denote 
&lt;math&gt;L_{f}(q) := q&lt;/math&gt; to be the Lambert series generating function of the arithmetic function ''f'': 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_{n \geq 1} \frac{f(n) q^n}{1+q^n} &amp; = \sum_{n \geq 1} \frac{f(2n-1)q^{2n-1}}{1-q^{2n-1}} - 
     \sum_{n \geq 1} \frac{2 f(n) q^{2n}}{1-q^{2n}} \\ 
     &amp; = 
     \frac{1}{2}\left(L_f(q) - L_f(-q)\right) - 2 \cdot L_f(q^2). 
\end{align} 
&lt;/math&gt; 
The second identity in the previous equations follows from the fact that the coefficients of the left-hand-side sum are given by 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_{d|n} \mu(\alpha d) = 
     \sum_{d | \frac{n}{(n, \alpha)}} \mu(d) = \varepsilon\left(\frac{n}{(n, \alpha)}\right) = 1 
     \iff n = (n, \alpha) \iff n = \alpha^k,\ \text{ for some } k \geq 1, 
\end{align} 
&lt;/math&gt; 
where the function &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(n) = \delta_{n,1}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[multiplicative inverse]] with respect to the operation of [[Dirichlet convolution]] of arithmetic functions. 

For [[Euler's totient function]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \varphi(n)\,\frac{q^n}{1-q^n} = \frac{q}{(1-q)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

For [[Liouville's function]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda(n)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \lambda(n)\,\frac{q^n}{1-q^n} = 
\sum_{n=1}^\infty q^{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

with the sum on the right similar to the [[Ramanujan theta function]], or [[Jacobi theta function]] &lt;math&gt;\vartheta_3(q)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that Lambert series in which the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[trigonometric function]]s, for example, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;sin(2''n''&amp;nbsp;''x''), can be evaluated by various combinations of the [[logarithmic derivative]]s of Jacobi [[theta function]]s.

Generally speaking, we can extend the previous generating function expansion by letting &lt;math&gt;\chi_m(n)&lt;/math&gt; denote the characteristic function of the &lt;math&gt;m^{th}&lt;/math&gt; powers, &lt;math&gt;n = k^m \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;, for positive natural numbers &lt;math&gt;m &gt; 2&lt;/math&gt; and defining the generalized ''m''-Liouville lambda function to be the arithmetic function satisfying &lt;math&gt;\chi_m(n) := (1 \ast \lambda_m)(n)&lt;/math&gt;. This definition of &lt;math&gt;\lambda_m(n)&lt;/math&gt; clearly implies that &lt;math&gt;\lambda_m(n) = \sum_{d^m|n} \mu\left(\frac{n}{d^m}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, which in turn shows that 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \geq 1} \frac{\lambda_m(n) q^n}{1-q^n} = \sum_{n \geq 1} q^{n^m},\ \text{ for } m \geq 2.&lt;/math&gt;

We also have a slightly more generalized Lambert series expansion generating the [[sum of squares function]] &lt;math&gt;r_2(n)&lt;/math&gt; in the form of 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weisstein|first1=Eric W.|title=Lambert Series|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LambertSeries.html|website=MathWorld|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{4 \cdot (-1)^{n+1} q^{2n+1}}{1-q^{2n+1}} = \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} r_2(m) q^m.&lt;/math&gt;

In general, if we write the Lambert series over &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; which generates the arithmetic functions &lt;math&gt;g(m) = (f \ast 1)(m)&lt;/math&gt;, the next pairs of functions correspond to other well-known convolutions expressed by their Lambert series generating functions in the forms of 
:&lt;math&gt;(f, g) = (\mu, \varepsilon), (\varphi, \operatorname{Id}_1), (\lambda, \chi_{\operatorname{sq}}), (\Lambda, \log), 
                (|\mu|, 2^{\omega}), (J_t, \operatorname{Id}_t), (d^3, (d \ast 1)^2), &lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(n) = \delta_{n,1}&lt;/math&gt; is the multiplicative identity for [[Dirichlet convolutions]], &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Id}_k(n) = n^k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity function]] for &lt;math&gt;k^{th}&lt;/math&gt; powers, &lt;math&gt;\chi_{\operatorname{sq}}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the characteristic function for the squares, &lt;math&gt;\omega(n)&lt;/math&gt; which counts the number of distinct prime factors of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (see [[prime omega function]]), &lt;math&gt;J_t&lt;/math&gt; is [[Jordan's totient function]], and &lt;math&gt;d(n) = \sigma_0(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[divisor function]] (see [[Dirichlet convolution#Examples|Dirichlet convolutions]]).

==Alternate form==
Substituting &lt;math&gt;q=e^{-z}&lt;/math&gt; one obtains another common form for the series, as

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac {a_n}{e^{zn}-1}= \sum_{m=1}^\infty b_m e^{-mz}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;b_m = (a*1)(m) = \sum_{d\mid m} a_d\,&lt;/math&gt;

as before. Examples of Lambert series in this form, with &lt;math&gt;z=2\pi&lt;/math&gt;, occur in expressions for the [[Riemann zeta function]] for odd integer values; see [[Zeta constants]] for details.

==Current usage==

In the literature we find ''Lambert series'' applied to a wide variety of sums.  For example, since &lt;math&gt;q^n/(1 - q^n ) = \mathrm{Li}_0(q^{n})&lt;/math&gt; is a [[polylogarithm]] function, we may refer to any sum of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\xi^n  \,\mathrm{Li}_u (\alpha q^n)}{n^s} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\alpha^n  \,\mathrm{Li}_s(\xi q^n)}{n^u}&lt;/math&gt;

as a Lambert series, assuming that the parameters are suitably restricted.  Thus

:&lt;math&gt;12\left(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^2 \, \mathrm{Li}_{-1}(q^n)\right)^{\!2} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 
n^2 \,\mathrm{Li}_{-5}(q^n) -
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^4 \, \mathrm{Li}_{-3}(q^n),&lt;/math&gt;

which holds for all complex ''q'' not on the unit circle, would be considered a Lambert series identity.  This identity follows in a straightforward fashion from some identities published by the Indian mathematician [[S. Ramanujan]].  A very thorough exploration of Ramanujan's works can be found in the works by [[Bruce Berndt]].

==Factorization theorems==

A somewhat newer construction recently published over 2017–2018 relates to so-termed ''Lambert series factorization theorems'' of the form &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merca|first1=Mircea|title=The Lambert series factorization theorem|journal=The Ramanujan Journal|date=13 January 2017|volume=44|issue=2|pages=417–435|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11139-016-9856-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \geq 1} \frac{a_n q^n}{1\pm q^n} = \frac{1}{(\mp q; q)_{\infty}} \sum_{n \geq 1} \left((s_o(n, k) \pm s_e(n, k)) a_k\right) q^n, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;s_o(n, k) \pm s_e(n, k) = [q^n] (\mp q; q)_{\infty} \frac{q^k}{1 \pm q^k}&lt;/math&gt; is the respective sum or difference of the 
restricted partition functions &lt;math&gt;s_{e/o}(n, k)&lt;/math&gt; which denote the number of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;'s in all partitions of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; into an ''even'' (respectively, ''odd'') number of distinct parts. Let &lt;math&gt;s_{n,k} := s_e(n, k) - s_o(n, k) = [q^n] (q; q)_{\infty} \frac{q^k}{1-q^k}&lt;/math&gt; denote the invertible lower triangular sequence whose first few values are shown in the table below.

Another characteristic form of the Lambert series factorization theorem expansions is given by &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merca, M. and Schmidt, M. D.|title=Generating Special Arithmetic Functions by Lambert Series Factorizations|journal=Contributions to Discrete Mathematics|date=2018|volume=to appear|arxiv=1706.00393|bibcode=2017arXiv170600393M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L_f(q) := \sum_{n \geq 1} \frac{f(n) q^n}{1-q^n} = \frac{1}{(q; q)_{\infty}} \sum_{n \geq 1} \left(s_{n,k} f(k)\right) q^n, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(q; q)_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is the (infinite) [[q-Pochhammer symbol]]. The invertible matrix products on the right-hand-side of the previous equation correspond to inverse matrix products whose lower triangular entries are given in terms of the [[Partition (number theory)|partition function]] and the [[Möbius function]] by the [[divisor sums]]

:&lt;math&gt;s_{n,k}^{(-1)} = \sum_{d|n} p(d-k) \mu\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The next table lists the first several rows of these corresponding inverse matrices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A133732|url=https://oeis.org/A133732|website=Online Encylopedia of Integer Sequences|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We let &lt;math&gt;G_j := \frac{1}{2} \left\lceil \frac{j}{2} \right\rceil \left\lceil \frac{3j+1}{2} \right\rceil&lt;/math&gt; denote the sequence of interleaved [[pentagonal numbers]], i.e., so that the [[pentagonal number theorem]] is expanded in the form of

:&lt;math&gt;(q; q)_{\infty} = \sum_{n \geq 0} (-1)^{\left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil} q^{G_n}. &lt;/math&gt;

Then for any Lambert series &lt;math&gt;L_f(q)&lt;/math&gt; generating the sequence of &lt;math&gt;g(n) = (f \ast 1)(n)&lt;/math&gt;, we have the corresponding inversion relation of the factorization theorem expanded above given by &lt;ref name="SCHMIDT_ACTA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=Maxie D.|title=New Recurrence Relations and Matrix Equations for Arithmetic Functions Generated by Lambert Series|journal=Acta Arithmetica|date=8 December 2017|volume=181|pages=355–367|arxiv=1701.06257|bibcode=2017arXiv170106257S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n \sum_{d|n} p(d-k) \mu(n/d) \times \sum_{j: k-G_j &gt; 0} (-1)^{\left\lceil \frac{j}{2} \right\rceil} b(k-G_j).&lt;/math&gt;

This work on Lambert series factorization theorems is extended in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=M. Merca and Schmidt, M. D.|title=New Factor Pairs for Factorizations of Lambert Series Generating Functions|arxiv=1706.02359}}&lt;/ref&gt; to more general expansions of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \geq 1} \frac{a_n q^n}{1-q^n} = \frac{1}{C(q)} \sum_{n \geq 1} \left(\sum_{k=1}^n s_{n,k}(\gamma) \widetilde{a}_k(\gamma)\right) q^n, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C(q)&lt;/math&gt; is any (partition-related) reciprocal generating function, &lt;math&gt;\gamma(n)&lt;/math&gt; is any [[arithmetic function]], and where the 
modified coefficients are expanded by

:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{a}_k(\gamma) = \sum_{d|k} \sum_{r| \frac{k}{d}} a_d \gamma(r). &lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding inverse matrices in the above expansion satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;s_{n,k}^{(-1)}(\gamma) = \sum_{d|n} [q^{d-k}] \frac{1}{C(q)} \gamma\left(\frac{n}{d}\right), &lt;/math&gt;

so that as in the first variant of the Lambert factorization theorem above we obtain an inversion relation for the right-hand-side coefficients of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{a}_k(\gamma) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} s_{n,k}^{(-1)}(\gamma) \times [q^k]\left(\sum_{d=1}^k \frac{a_d q^d}{1-q^d} C(q)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Recurrence relations==

Within this section we define the following functions for natural numbers &lt;math&gt;n,x \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;: 
:&lt;math&gt;g_f(n) := (f \ast 1)(n), &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_f(x) := \sum_{1 \leq n \leq x} g_f(n). &lt;/math&gt;

We also adopt the notation from the [[Lambert series#Factorization theorems|previous section]] that

:&lt;math&gt;s_{n,k} = [q^n] (q; q)_{\infty} \frac{q^k}{1-q^k}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(q; q)_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is the infinite [[q-Pochhammer symbol]]. Then we have the following recurrence relations for involving these functions and the [[pentagonal numbers]] proved in:&lt;ref name="SCHMIDT_ACTA" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g_f(n+1) = \sum_{b = \pm 1} \sum_{k=1}^{\left\lfloor \frac{\sqrt{24n+1}-b}{6}\right\rfloor} 
(-1)^{k+1} g_f\left(n+1-\frac{k(3k+b)}{2}\right) + 
\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} s_{n+1,k} f(k), &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_f(x+1) = \sum_{b = \pm 1} \sum_{k=1}^{\left\lfloor \frac{\sqrt{24n+1}-b}{6}\right\rfloor} 
(-1)^{k+1} \Sigma_f\left(n+1-\frac{k(3k+b)}{2}\right) + 
\sum_{n=0}^x \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} s_{n+1,k} f(k). &lt;/math&gt;

==Derivatives==

Derivatives of a Lambert series can be obtained by differentiation of the series termwise with respect to &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. We have the following identities for the termwise &lt;math&gt;s^{th}&lt;/math&gt; derivatives of a Lambert series for any &lt;math&gt;s \geq 1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Schmidt|first1=Maxie D.|title=Combinatorial Sums and Identities Involving Generalized Divisor Functions with Bounded Divisors|date=2017|arxiv=1704.05595}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Schmidt|first1=Maxie D.|title=Factorization Theorems for Hadamard Products and Higher-Order Derivatives of Lambert Series Generating Functions|date=2017|arxiv=1712.00608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;q^s \cdot D^{(s)}\left[\frac{q^i}{1-q^i}\right] = \sum_{m=0}^s \sum_{k=0}^m \left[\begin{matrix} s \\ m\end{matrix}\right] 
       \left\{\begin{matrix} m \\ k\end{matrix}\right\} \frac{(-1)^{s-k} k! i^m}{(1-q^i)^{k+1}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q^s \cdot D^{(s)}\left[\frac{q^i}{1-q^i}\right] = \sum_{r=0}^s\left[\sum_{m=0}^s \sum_{k=0}^m \left[\begin{matrix} s \\ m\end{matrix}\right] 
       \left\{\begin{matrix} m \\ k\end{matrix}\right\} \binom{s-k}{r} \frac{(-1)^{s-k-r} k! i^m}{(1-q^i)^{k+1}}\right] q^{(r+1)i},&lt;/math&gt;

where the bracketed triangular coefficients in the previous equations denote the [[Stirling number|Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds]]. 
We also have the next identity for extracting the individual coefficients of the terms implicit to the previous expansions given in the form of

:&lt;math&gt;[q^n]\left(\sum_{i \geq t} \frac{a_i q^{mi}}{(1-q^i)^{k+1}}\right) = \sum_{\begin{matrix} d|n \\ t \leq d \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n}{m} \right\rfloor\end{matrix}} 
       \binom{\frac{n}{d}-m+k}{k} a_d. &lt;/math&gt;

Now if we define the functions &lt;math&gt;A_t(n)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;n,t \geq 1&lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;A_t(n) := \sum_{\begin{matrix} 0 \leq k \leq m \leq t \\ 0 \leq r \leq t\end{matrix}} \sum_{d|n} \left[\begin{matrix} t \\ m\end{matrix}\right] 
       \left\{\begin{matrix} m \\ k\end{matrix}\right\} \binom{t-k}{r} \binom{\frac{n}{d}-1-r+k}{k} (-1)^{t-k-r} k! d^m \cdot a_d \cdot 
       \left[t \leq d \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n}{r+1} \right\rfloor\right]_{\delta}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;[\cdot]_{\delta}&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[Iverson's convention]], then we have the coefficients for the &lt;math&gt;t^{th}&lt;/math&gt; derivatives of a Lambert series 
given by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A_t(n) &amp; = [q^n]\left(q^t \cdot D^{(t)}\left[\sum_{i \geq t} \frac{a_i q^i}{1-q^i}\right]\right) \\ 
       &amp; = [q^n]\left(\sum_{n \geq 1} \frac{(A_t \ast \mu)(n) q^n}{1-q^n}\right). 
\end{align} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Of course, by a typical argument purely by operations on formal power series we also have that

:&lt;math&gt;[q^n]\left(q^t \cdot D^{(t)}\left[\sum_{i \geq 1} \frac{f(i) q^i}{1-q^i}\right]\right) = \frac{n!}{(n-t)!} \cdot (f \ast 1)(n). &lt;/math&gt;

The code of [[0 (number)|zero]] is "0"; to code a [[positive number]]:
#Initialize the step count variable ''C'' to 1.
#Write the [[binary numeral system|binary]] representation of the number without the leading "1" to the beginning of the code.
#Let ''M'' be the number of bits written in step 2.
#If ''M'' is not 0, increment ''C'', repeat from step 2 with M as the new number.
#Write ''C'' "1" bits and a "0" to the beginning of the code.

To decode a Levenstein-coded integer:
#Count the number of "1" bits until a "0" is encountered.
#If the count is zero, the value is zero, otherwise
#Start with a variable ''N'', set it to a value of 1 and repeat ''count minus 1'' times:
#Read ''N'' bits, prepend "1", assign the resulting value to ''N''

The Levenstein code of a positive integer is always one bit longer than the [[Elias omega coding|Elias omega code]] of that integer.  However, there is a Levenstein code for zero, whereas Elias omega coding would require the numbers to be shifted so that a zero is represented by the code for one instead.

[[Computability theory]] is the part of the theory of [[computation]] that deals with what can be computed, in principle. [[Computational complexity theory]] deals with how hard computations are, in quantitative terms, both with upper bounds ([[algorithm]]s whose complexity in the worst cases, as use of computing resources, can be estimated), and from below (proofs that no procedure to carry out some task can be very fast).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3979">In [[mathematics]], particularly in [[integral calculus]], the '''localization theorem''' allows, under certain conditions, to infer the nullity of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] given only information about its [[continuity (mathematics)|continuity]] and the value of its integral.

Let {{math|&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;)}} be a [[real-valued function]] defined on some open [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;var&gt;Ω&lt;/var&gt; of the [[real line]] that is [[Continuous function|continuous]] in &lt;var&gt;Ω&lt;/var&gt;. Let &lt;var&gt;D&lt;/var&gt; be an arbitrary subinterval contained in &lt;var&gt;Ω&lt;/var&gt;. The theorem states the following implication:

: &lt;math&gt;\int\limits_D F(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = 0 ~ \forall D \subset \Omega ~ \Rightarrow ~ F(x) = 0 ~ \forall x \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Localization Theorem.svg|float|right]]
A simple proof is as follows: if there were a point &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; within  &lt;var&gt;Ω&lt;/var&gt; for which {{math|&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;ne; 0}}, then the continuity of {{math|&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt;}} would require the existence of a [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in which the value of {{math|&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt;}} was nonzero, and in particular of the same sign than in &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Since such a neighborhood &lt;var&gt;N&lt;/var&gt;, which can be taken to be arbitrarily small, must however be of a nonzero width on the real line, the integral of {{math|&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt;}} over &lt;var&gt;N&lt;/var&gt; would evaluate to a nonzero value. However, since &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is part of the ''open'' set &lt;var&gt;Ω&lt;/var&gt;, all neighborhoods of &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; smaller than the distance of &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to the frontier of &lt;var&gt;Ω&lt;/var&gt; are included within it, and so the integral of {{math|&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt;}} over them must evaluate to zero. Having reached the contradiction that {{math|∫&lt;sub&gt;&lt;var&gt;N&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;) &lt;var&gt;dx&lt;/var&gt;}} must be both zero and nonzero, the initial hypothesis must be wrong, and thus there is no &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in  &lt;var&gt;Ω&lt;/var&gt; for which {{math|&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;ne; 0}}.

The theorem is easily generalized to [[multivariate calculus|multivariate function]]s, replacing intervals with the more general concept of connected [[open set]]s, that is, [[Domain (mathematics)#Real and complex analysis|domain]]s, and the original function with some {{math|&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;'''x'''&lt;/var&gt;) : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;rarr;'''R'''}}, with the constraints of continuity and nullity of its integral over any subdomain {{math|&lt;var&gt;D&lt;/var&gt;&amp;sub;&lt;var&gt;Ω&lt;/var&gt;}}. The proof is completely analogous to the single variable case, and concludes with the impossibility of finding a point {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''x'''&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; &lt;var&gt;Ω&lt;/var&gt;}} such that {{math|&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;'''x'''&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;ne; 0}}.

{{clear}}

==Example==
An example of the use of this theorem in physics is the law of [[conservation of mass]] for fluids, which states that the mass of any fluid volume must not change:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\int\limits_{V_f} \rho(\vec x, t) \, \mathrm{d}\Omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the [[Reynolds transport theorem]], one can change the reference to an arbitrary (non-fluid) [[control volume]] &lt;var&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;.  Further assuming that the [[density|density function]] is continuous (i.e. that our fluid is monophasic and thermodynamically metastable) and that &lt;var&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; is not moving relative to the chosen system of reference, the equation becomes:

: &lt;math&gt;\int\limits_{V_c} \left [ {{\partial \rho} \over {\partial t}} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \vec v) \right ] \, \mathrm{d}\Omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;

As the equation holds for ''any'' such control volume, the localization theorem applies, rendering the common [[partial differential equation]] for the conservation of mass in monophase fluids:

: &lt;math&gt;{\partial \rho \over \partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \vec v) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

{{more footnotes|date=April 2016}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''structure''' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is an additional [[mathematical object]] that, in some manner, attaches (or relates) to that set to endow it with some additional meaning or significance.

A partial list of possible structures are [[Measure theory|measures]], [[algebraic structure]]s ([[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[field (mathematics)|field]]s, etc.), [[Topology|topologies]], [[Metric space|metric structures]] ([[Geometry|geometries]]), [[Order theory|orders]], [[Event structure|events]], [[equivalence relation]]s, [[differential structure]]s, and [[Category (category theory)|categories]].

Sometimes, a set is endowed with more than one structure simultaneously; this enables mathematicians to study it more richly. For example, an ordering imposes a rigid form, shape, or topology on the set. As another example, if a set has both a topology and is a group, and these two structures are related in a certain way, the set becomes a [[topological group]].

[[Map (mathematics)|Mappings]] between sets which preserve structures (so that structures in the source or [[Domain of a function|domain]] are mapped to equivalent structures in the destination or [[codomain]]) are of special interest in many fields of mathematics. Examples are [[homomorphism]]s, which preserve algebraic structures; [[homeomorphism]]s, which preserve topological structures; and [[diffeomorphism]]s, which preserve differential structures.

==History==
In 1939, the French group with the pseudonym [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] saw structures as the root of mathematics. They first mentioned them in their "Fascicule" of ''Theory of Sets'' and expanded it into Chapter IV of the 1957 edition.&lt;ref name=Corry&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corry|first1=Leo|title=Nicolas Bourbaki and the concept of mathematical structure|journal=Synthese|date=September 1992|volume=92|issue=3|pages=315&amp;ndash;348|jstor=20117057|doi=10.1007/bf00414286}}&lt;/ref&gt; They identified three ''mother structures'': algebraic, topological, and order.&lt;ref name=Corry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wells&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Richard B.|title=Biological signal processing and computational neuroscience|date=2010|pages=296&amp;ndash;335|url=http://www.mrc.uidaho.edu/~rwells/techdocs/Biological%20Signal%20Processing/Chapter%2010%20Mathematical%20Structures.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example: the real numbers==
The set of [[real number]]s has several standard structures:
*an order: each number is either less or more than any other number.
*algebraic structure: there are operations of multiplication and addition that make it into a [[Field (mathematics)|field]].
*a measure: intervals along the real line have a specific [[length]], which can be extended to the [[Lebesgue measure]] on many of its subsets.
*a metric: there is a notion of [[Metric (mathematics)|distance]] between points.
*a geometry: it is equipped with a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] and is [[Flatness (mathematics)|flat]].
*a topology: there is a notion of open sets.
There are interfaces among these:
*Its order and, independently, its metric structure induce its topology.
*Its order and algebraic structure make it into an [[ordered field]].
*Its algebraic structure and topology make it into a [[Lie group]], a type of [[topological group]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4397">'''Membrane computing''' (or '''MC''') is an area within [[computer science]] that seeks to discover new [[computational model]]s from the study of biological [[Cell (biology)|cells]], particularly of the [[cellular membrane]]s. It is a sub-task of creating a [[cellular model]].

Membrane computing deals with distributed and parallel computing models, processing multisets of symbol objects in a localized manner. Thus, evolution rules allow for evolving objects to be encapsulated into compartments defined by membranes. The communications between compartments and with the environment play an essential role in the processes. The various types of membrane systems are known as [[P systems]] after [[Gheorghe Păun]] who first conceived the model in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Păun|first=Gheorghe|title=Introduction to Membrane Computing|url=http://psystems.disco.unimib.it/download/MembIntro2004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An essential ingredient of a [[P system]] is its membrane structure, which can be a hierarchical arrangement of membranes, as in a cell, or a net of membranes (placed in the nodes of a graph), as in a tissue or a neural net. [[P systems]] are often depicted graphically with drawings.

[[File:P-System Membrane Format.pdf|Nine Region Membrane Computer|thumb]]

The intuition behind the notion of a membrane is a three-dimensional vesicle from biology.  However the concept itself is more general, and a membrane is seen as a separator of two regions.  The membrane provides for  selective communication between the two regions. As per Gheorghe Păun, the separation is of the [[Euclidean space]] into a finite “inside” and an infinite “outside”.  The selective communication is where the computing comes in. 

Graphical representations may have numerous elements, according to the variation of the model that is being studied. For example, a rule may produce the special symbol δ, in which case the membrane that contains it is dissolved and all its contents move up in the region hierarchy.

The variety of suggestions from biology and the range of possibilities to define the architecture and the functioning of a membrane-based multiset processing device are practically endless.  Indeed the membrane computing literature contains a very large number of models. Thus, MC is not merely a theory related to a specific model, it is a framework for devising compartmentalized models.

Chemicals are modeled by symbols, or alternatively by strings of symbols. The region, which is defined by a membrane, can contain other symbols or strings (collectively referred to as objects) or other membranes, so that a [[P system]] has exactly one outer membrane, called the skin membrane, and a hierarchical relationship governing all its membranes under the skin membrane. 

If objects are symbols, then their multiplicity within a region matters; however multi-sets are also used in some string models. Regions have associated rules that define how objects are produced, consumed, passed to other regions and otherwise interact with one another. The nondeterministic maximally parallel application of rules throughout the system is a transition between system states, and a sequence of transitions is called a computation. Particular goals can be defined to signify a halting state, at which point the result of the computation would be the objects contained in a particular region.  Alternatively the result may be made up of objects sent out of the skin membrane to the environment.

Many variant models have been studied, and interest has focused on proving computational universality for systems with a small number of membranes, for the purpose of solving NP-complete problems such as [[Boolean satisfiability problem|Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems]] and the [[Travelling salesman problem|traveling salesman problem (TSP)]]. The [[P systems]] may trade space and time complexities and less often use models to explain natural processes in living cells.  The studies devise models that may at least theoretically be implemented on hardware. To date, the [[P systems]] are nearly all theoretical models that have never been reduced to practice, although a practical system is given in.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|20090124506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mohammad Hajiaghayi was born in 1979 in [[Qazvin]], [[Iran]].  His parents were both K-12 teachers. He went to high school at [[Shahid Babaee High School (Qazvin Sampad)]], [[National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents]] (NODET).

In 1997, Hajiaghayi won a silver medal in the [[International Olympiad in Informatics]].

==Professional career==
Hajiaghayi received his BSc with highest distinction in Computer Engineering from [[Sharif University of Technology]] in 2000 (in three years),
his MSc in Computer Science from the [[University of Waterloo]] in 2001, and his PhD in applied mathematics and computer science from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 2005 advised by  [[Erik Demaine]] and [[F. Thomson Leighton]].

His thesis was titled "''The [[Bidimensionality]] Theory and Its Algorithmic Applications''"&lt;ref name="phdthesis"&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=95073}}.&lt;/ref&gt; founded the theory of [[bidimensionality]] which later received the [[Nerode Prize]]&lt;ref name="nerode"/&gt; and was subject of studies in a few workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Bidimensional Structures: Algorithms, Combinatorics and Logic|url=https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=13121|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= FOCS 2013 Workshop on Bidimensional Structures: Algorithms and Combinatorics|url=http://simons.berkeley.edu/focs2013/workshop1.html|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a post-doc at the [[Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science]] and [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] as well as a researcher at [[AT&amp;T Labs]]—Research.

Hajiaghayi was hired as an assistant professor at the University of Maryland in the Fall of 2010. He was promoted to an associate professor with tenure in 2012 and then to a full professor in 2016. He has served on the program committees of numerous conferences as well as editorial boards of several journals.

Hajiaghayi has been the coach of the 
[[University of Maryland]] [[ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest|ACM International Collegiate Programming]] team in The World Finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CS Team Wins Award at ACM ICPC Finals|url=https://www.cs.umd.edu/article/2013/07/cs-team-wins-award-acm-icpc-finals|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Hajiaghayi along with Seddighin introduced a new CS Theory Ranking based on publications in theory conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ranking of CS Departments based on the Number of Papers in Theoretical Computer Science|url=http://projects.csail.mit.edu/dnd/ranking|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and awards==
Hajiaghayi's has received  [[National Science Foundation CAREER Awards|National Science Foundation CAREER Award]] (2010),&lt;ref name="nsfcareer"/&gt; [[Office of Naval Research]] Young Investigator Award (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.onr.navy.mil/Science-Technology/Directorates/office-research-discovery-invention/Sponsored-Research/YIP/2011-young-investigator-recipients.aspx|title=2011 Young Investigator Award Recipients|publisher=Office of Naval Research|accessdate=2015-05-05}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Maryland]] Graduate Faculty Mentor of the Year Award (2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.cs.umd.edu/article/2015/04/professor-hajiaghayi-wins-graduate-faculty-mentor-year-award|title=Professor Hajiaghayi Wins Graduate Faculty Mentor of the Year Award|date=April 26, 2015|publisher=University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies|accessdate=2015-05-05}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Google Faculty Research Awards (2010 &amp; 2014). So far Hajiaghayi has raised more than ''3.4'' million dollars in terms of grant award money from government and industry since joining the [[University of Maryland]].&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae|first1=MohammadTaghi |last1=Hajiaghayi|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/cv1.pdf|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his co-authors [[Erik Demaine]], Fedor Fomin, and Dimitrios Thilikos, he received the 2015 [[European Association for Theoretical Computer Science]] [[Nerode Prize]] for his work (also the topic of his Ph.D. thesis&lt;ref name="phdthesis"/&gt;) on [[bidimensionality]], a general technique for developing both [[parameterized complexity|fixed-parameter tractable]] exact algorithms and [[approximation algorithm]]s for a wide class of algorithmic problems on graphs.&lt;ref name="nerode"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/about-us/news/hajiaghayi-wins-2015-nerode-prize|title=Hajiaghayi Wins 2015 Nerode Prize|date=May 8, 2015|publisher=University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies|accessdate=2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''monotonic function'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Mathematics|last=Clapham|first=Christopher|last2=Nicholson|first2=James|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=|edition=5th|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MonotonicFunction.html|title=Monotonic Function|last=Stover|first=Christopher|date=|website=Wolfram MathWorld|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;(or '''monotone function'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Monotone_function|title=Monotone function|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] between [[List of order structures in mathematics|ordered sets]] that preserves or reverses the given [[order relation|order]]. This concept first arose in [[calculus]], and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of [[order theory]].

== Monotonicity in calculus and analysis ==
In [[calculus]], a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; defined on a [[subset]] of the [[real numbers]] with real values is called '''monotonic''' if and only if it is either entirely non-increasing, or entirely non-decreasing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; That is, as per Fig. 1, a function that increases monotonically does not exclusively have to increase, it simply must not decrease.

A function is called '''monotonically increasing''' (also '''increasing''' or '''non-decreasing'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;), if for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x \leq y&lt;/math&gt; one has  &lt;math&gt;f\!\left(x\right) \leq f\!\left(y\right)&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; preserves the order (see Figure 1). Likewise, a function is called '''monotonically decreasing''' (also '''decreasing''' or '''non-increasing'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) if, whenever &lt;math&gt;x \leq y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f\!\left(x\right) \geq f\!\left(y\right)&lt;/math&gt;, so it ''reverses'' the order (see Figure 2).

If the order &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order &lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt;, then one obtains a stronger requirement. A function with this property is called '''strictly increasing'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Again, by inverting the order symbol, one finds a corresponding concept called '''strictly decreasing'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  Functions that are strictly increasing or decreasing are [[one-to-one function|one-to-one]] (because for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; not equal to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, either &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x &gt; y&lt;/math&gt; and so, by monotonicity, either &lt;math&gt;f\!\left(x\right) &lt; f\!\left(y\right)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;f\!\left(x\right) &gt; f\!\left(y\right)&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;f\!\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; is not equal to &lt;math&gt;f\!\left(y\right)&lt;/math&gt;.)

If it is not clear that "increasing" and "decreasing" are taken to include the possibility of repeating the same value at successive arguments, one may use the terms '''weakly increasing''' and '''weakly decreasing''' to stress this possibility.

The terms "non-decreasing" and "non-increasing" should not be confused with the (much weaker) negative qualifications "not decreasing" and "not increasing". For example, the function of figure 3 first falls, then rises, then falls again. It is therefore not decreasing and not increasing, but it is neither non-decreasing nor non-increasing.

A function &lt;math&gt;f\!\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''absolutely monotonic''' over an interval &lt;math&gt;\left(a, b\right)&lt;/math&gt; if the derivatives of all orders of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; are [[nonnegative]] or all [[nonpositive]] at all points on the interval.

=== Monotonic transformation ===

The term '''monotonic transformation''' (or '''monotone transformation''') can also possibly cause some confusion because it refers to a transformation by a strictly increasing function. This is the case in economics with respect to the ordinal properties of a [[utility function]] being preserved across a monotonic transform (see also [[monotone preferences]]).&lt;ref&gt;See the section on Cardinal Versus Ordinal Utility in {{harvtxt|Simon|Blume|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, what we are calling a "monotonic transformation" is, more accurately, called a "positive monotonic transformation", in order to distinguish it from a “negative monotonic transformation,” which reverses the order of the numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Varian |first=Hal R. |title=Intermediate Microeconomics |edition=8th |year=2010 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |page=56 |isbn=9780393934243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Some basic applications and results ===
The following properties are true for a monotonic function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;:
*&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has [[limit of a function|limits]] from the right and from the left at every point of its [[Domain of a function|domain]];
*&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has a limit at positive or negative infinity (&amp;thinsp;&lt;math&gt;\pm\infty&lt;/math&gt;&amp;thinsp;) of either a real number, &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\left(-\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can only have [[jump discontinuity|jump discontinuities]];
*&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can only have [[countable|countably]] many [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuities]] in its domain.  The discontinuities, however, do not necessarily consist of isolated points and may even be dense in an interval (''a'',''b'').

These properties are the reason why monotonic functions are useful in technical work in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Two facts about these functions are:
*if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a monotonic function defined on an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[derivative|differentiable]] [[almost everywhere]] on &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{x : x \in I\right\}&lt;/math&gt; of numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not differentiable in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue]] [[measure zero]]. In addition, this result cannot be improved to countable: see [[Cantor function]].
*if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a monotonic function defined on an interval &lt;math&gt;\left[a, b\right]&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[Riemann integral|Riemann integrable]].

An important application of monotonic functions is in [[probability theory]]. If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[random variable]], its [[cumulative distribution function]] &lt;math&gt;F_X\!\left(x\right) = \text{Prob}\!\left(X \leq x\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a monotonically increasing function.

A function is ''[[unimodal function|unimodal]]'' if it is monotonically increasing up to some point (the ''[[Mode (statistics)|mode]]'') and then monotonically decreasing.

When &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a ''strictly monotonic'' function, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[injective]] on its domain, and if &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, then there is an [[inverse function]] on &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

== Monotonicity in topology ==

A map ''&lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;'' is said to be '''monotone''' if each of its fibers is connected i.e. for each element ''&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;'' in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; the (possibly empty) set &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt; is connected.

== Monotonicity in functional analysis ==

In [[functional analysis]] on a [[topological vector space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, a (possibly non-linear) operator &lt;math&gt;T: X \rightarrow X^*&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''monotone operator''' if

:&lt;math&gt;(Tu - Tv, u - v) \geq 0 \quad \forall u,v \in X.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Kachurovskii's theorem]] shows that [[convex function]]s on [[Banach space]]s have monotonic operators as their derivatives.

A subset &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X \times X^*&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''monotone set''' if for every pair &lt;math&gt;[u_1, w_1]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[u_2, w_2]&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;(w_1 - w_2, u_1 - u_2) \geq 0.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''maximal monotone''' if it is maximal among all monotone sets in the sense of set inclusion.  The graph of a monotone operator &lt;math&gt;G(T)&lt;/math&gt; is a monotone set. A monotone operator is said to be '''maximal monotone''' if its graph is a '''maximal monotone set'''.

== Monotonicity in order theory ==

Order theory deals with arbitrary [[partially ordered set]]s and [[preorder|preordered sets]] in addition to real numbers. The above definition of monotonicity is relevant in these cases as well. However, the terms "increasing" and "decreasing" are avoided, since their conventional pictorial representation does not apply to orders that are not [[total order|total]]. Furthermore, the [[strict order|strict]] relations &lt; and &gt; are of little use in many non-total orders and hence no additional terminology is introduced for them.

A monotone function is also called '''isotone''', or '''{{visible anchor|order-preserving}}'''. The [[duality (order theory)|dual]] notion is often called '''antitone''', '''anti-monotone''', or '''order-reversing'''. Hence, an antitone function ''f'' satisfies the property

: ''x'' ≤ ''y'' implies ''f''(''x'') ≥ ''f''(''y''),

for all ''x'' and ''y'' in its domain. The composite of two monotone mappings is also monotone.

A [[constant function]] is both monotone and antitone; conversely, if ''f'' is both monotone and antitone, and if the domain of ''f'' is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]], then ''f'' must be constant.

Monotone functions are central in order theory. They appear in most articles on the subject and examples from special applications are found in these places. Some notable special monotone functions are [[order embedding]]s (functions for which ''x'' ≤ ''y'' [[if and only if]] ''f''(''x'') ≤ ''f''(''y'')) and [[order isomorphism]]s ([[surjective]] order embeddings).

== Monotonicity in the context of search algorithms ==
In the context of [[search algorithm]]s monotonicity (also called consistency) is a condition applied to [[heuristic function]]s.  A heuristic ''h(n)'' is monotonic if, for every node ''n'' and every successor ''n''' of ''n'' generated by any action ''a'', the estimated cost of reaching the goal from ''n'' is no greater than the step cost of getting to '' n' '' plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal from '' n' '',

:&lt;math&gt;h(n) \leq c(n, a, n') + h(n').&lt;/math&gt;

This is a form of [[triangle inequality]], with ''n'', ''n''', and the goal ''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' closest to ''n''.  Because every monotonic heuristic is also [[admissible heuristic|admissible]], monotonicity is a stricter requirement than admissibility.  Some [[heuristic algorithm]]s such as [[A*]] can be proven [[asymptotically optimal algorithm|optimal]] provided that the heuristic they use is monotonic.&lt;ref&gt;Conditions for optimality:  Admissibility and consistency pg. 94-95 {{Harv|Russell|Norvig|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Boolean functions ==
In [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], a monotonic function is one such that for all ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in {0,1}, if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (i.e. the Cartesian product {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is ordered [[Coordinatewise order|coordinatewise]]), then f(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ f(''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). In other words, a Boolean function is monotonic if, for every combination of inputs, switching one of the inputs from false to true can only cause the output to switch from false to true and not from true to false. Graphically, this means that a Boolean function is monotonic when in its [[Hasse diagram]] ([[Duality (mathematics)#Dimension-reversing dualities|dual]] of its [[Venn diagram]]), there is no 1 connected to a higher 0.

The monotonic Boolean functions are precisely those that can be defined by an expression combining the inputs (which may appear more than once) using only the operators ''[[logical conjunction|and]]'' and ''[[logical disjunction|or]]'' (in particular ''[[negation|not]]'' is forbidden). For instance "at least two of ''a'',''b'',''c'' hold" is a monotonic function of ''a'',''b'',''c'', since it can be written for instance as ((''a'' and ''b'') or (''a'' and ''c'') or (''b'' and ''c'')).

The number of such functions on ''n'' variables is known as the [[Dedekind number]] of ''n''.

In [[graph theory]], '''multiple edges'''  (also called '''parallel edges''' or a '''multi-edge'''), are two or more [[edge (graph theory)|edges]] that are [[incident (graph theory)|incident]] to the same two [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]. A [[simple graph]] has no multiple edges.

Depending on the context, a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]  may be defined so as to either allow or disallow the presence of multiple edges (often in concert with allowing or disallowing [[loop (graph theory)|loops]]):

*Where graphs are defined so as to ''allow'' multiple edges and loops, a graph without loops is often called a [[multigraph]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Balakrishnan, p. 1, and Gross (2003), p. 4, Zwillinger, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Where graphs are defined so as to ''disallow'' multiple edges and loops, a multigraph or a [[pseudograph]] is often defined to mean a "graph" which ''can'' have loops and multiple edges.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Bollobás, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SbZKSZ-1qrwC&amp;pg=PA7 p. 7]; Diestel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aR2TMYQr2CMC&amp;pg=PA28 p. 28]; Harary, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple edges are, for example, useful in the consideration of [[electrical network]]s, from a graph theoretical point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Bollobás, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SbZKSZ-1qrwC&amp;pg=PA39 pp. 39&amp;ndash;40].&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, they constitute the core differentiating feature of [[Multidimensional network|multidimensional networks]].

A [[planar graph]] remains planar if an edge is added between two vertices already joined by an edge; thus, adding multiple edges preserves planarity.&lt;ref&gt;Gross (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=CRDMgj-DfdEC&amp;pg=PA308 p. 308].&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[dipole graph]] is a graph with two vertices, in which all edges are parallel to each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6176">[[File:Ordered space illustration.svg|right|thumb|A point ''x'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the set of all ''y'' such that ''x''&amp;le;''y'' (in red). The order here is ''x''&amp;le;''y'' if and only if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;le; ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;le; ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
In [[mathematics]], an '''ordered vector space''' or '''partially ordered vector space''' is a [[vector space]] equipped with a [[partial order]] that is compatible with the vector space operations.

==Definition==

Given a vector space ''V'' over the [[real number]]s '''R''' and a [[preorder]] ≤ on the [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''V'', the pair {{nowrap|(''V'', ≤)}} is called a '''preordered vector space''' if for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''V'' and {{nowrap|0 ≤ ''&amp;lambda;''}}  in '''R''' the following two axioms are satisfied

# {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} implies {{nowrap|''x'' + ''z'' ≤ ''y'' + ''z''}}
# {{nowrap|''y'' ≤ ''x''}} implies {{nowrap|''&amp;lambda;y'' ≤ ''&amp;lambda;x''}}.

If ≤ is a [[partial order]], {{nowrap|(''V'', ≤)}} is called an '''ordered vector space'''. The two axioms imply that [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s and [[positive homothety|positive homotheties]] are automorphisms of the order structure and the mapping {{nowrap|''x'' ↦ &amp;minus;''x''}} is an isomorphism to the [[Duality (order theory)|dual order structure]]. Ordered vector spaces are [[ordered group]]s under their addition operation.

==Positive cone==

Given a preordered vector space ''V'', the subset ''V''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; of all elements ''x'' in ''V'' satisfying ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0 is a [[convex cone]], called the '''positive cone''' of ''V''. If ''V'' is an ordered vector space,  then ''V''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;cap;&amp;nbsp;(&amp;minus;''V''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{0}, and hence ''V''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[proper cone]]. 

If ''V'' is a real vector space and ''C'' is a proper convex cone in ''V'', there exists a unique partial order on ''V'' that makes ''V'' into an ordered vector space such  ''V''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''C''. This partial order is given by 
: ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''y'' if and only if ''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x'' is in ''C''.
Therefore, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the partial orders on a vector space ''V'' that are compatible with the vector space structure and the proper convex cones of ''V''.

== Examples ==

* The [[real number]]s with the usual order is an ordered vector space. 
* '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is an ordered vector space with the &amp;le; relation defined in any of the following ways (in order of increasing strength, i.e., decreasing sets of pairs):
**[[Lexicographical order]]: {{nowrap|(''a'',''b'') ≤ (''c'',''d'')}} if and only if {{nowrap|''a'' &lt; ''c''}} or ({{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''c''}} and {{nowrap|''b'' ≤ ''d''}}). This is a [[total order]]. The positive cone is given by {{nowrap|''x'' &gt; 0}} or ({{nowrap|1=''x'' = 0}} and {{nowrap|''y'' ≥ 0}}), i.e., in [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]], the set of points with  the angular coordinate satisfying {{nowrap|−π/2 &lt; ''θ'' ≤ π/2}}, together with the origin.
**{{nowrap|(''a'',''b'') ≤ (''c'',''d'')}} if and only if {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''c''}} and {{nowrap|''b'' ≤ ''d''}} (the [[product order]] of two copies of '''R''' with "≤"). This is a partial order. The positive cone is given by {{nowrap|''x'' ≥ 0}} and {{nowrap|''y'' ≥ 0}}, i.e., in polar coordinates {{nowrap|0 ≤ ''θ'' ≤ π/2}}, together with the origin.
**{{nowrap|(''a'',''b'') ≤ (''c'',''d'')}} if and only if ({{nowrap|''a'' &lt; ''c''}} and {{nowrap|''b'' &lt; ''d''}}) or ({{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''c''}} and {{nowrap|1=''b'' = ''d''}}) (the reflexive closure of the [[Direct product#Direct product of binary relations|direct product]] of two copies of '''R''' with "&lt;"). This is also a partial order. The positive cone is given by ({{nowrap|''x'' &gt; 0}} and {{nowrap|''y'' &gt; 0}}) or ({{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y'' = 0}}), i.e., in polar coordinates, {{nowrap|0 &lt; ''θ'' &lt; π/2}}, together with the origin.
:Only the second order is, as a subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, closed, see [[Partially ordered set#Partial orders in topological spaces|partial orders in topological spaces]].
:For the third order the two-dimensional "[[Partially ordered set#Interval|intervals]]" {{nowrap|''p'' &lt; ''x'' &lt; ''q''}} are open sets which generate the topology.
* '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is an ordered vector space with the &amp;le; relation defined similarly. For example, for the second order mentioned above:
**{{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} if and only if {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for {{nowrap|1=''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''}}.
* A [[Riesz space]] is an ordered vector space where the order gives rise to a [[Lattice order|lattice]].
* The space of continuous functions on {{nowrap|[0,1]}} where {{nowrap|''f'' ≤ ''g''}} iff {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') ≤ ''g''(''x'')}} for all ''x'' in {{nowrap|[0,1]}}.

== Remarks ==

* An interval in a partially ordered vector space is a [[convex set]]. If [''a'',''b''] = { ''x'' : ''a'' ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''b'' }, from axioms 1 and 2 above it follows that ''x'',''y'' in [''a'',''b''] and &amp;lambda; in (0,1) implies &amp;lambda;''x''+(1-&amp;lambda;)''y'' in [''a'',''b''].

This result was used to design the [[Penrose method]] of for allocating the voting weights of representatives in a decision-making bodies proportional to the square root of the population represented.

== Short derivation==
To estimate the voting index of any player one needs to estimate the number of the possible winning coalitions in which his vote is decisive. Assume for simplicity that the number of voters is odd, ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''j''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, and the body votes according to the standard majority rule. Following  Penrose one concludes that a given voter will be able to effectively influence the outcome of the voting only if the votes split half and half: if ''j'' players say 'Yes' and the remaining ''j'' players vote 'No', the last vote is decisive.

Assuming that all members of the body  vote independently (the votes are uncorrelated) 
and that the probability of each vote 'Yes' is equal to ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2 one can estimate likelihood of such an event using the [[Bernoulli trial]]. The probability to obtain ''j'' votes 'Yes' out of 2''j'' votes reads

: &lt;math&gt;
P_j = \left(  \frac{1}{2}\right)  ^{2j}\frac{\left( 2j\right)!}{\left( j! \right)^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

For large ''N'' we may use the [[Stirling's approximation]] for the factorial ''j''&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt; and obtain the probability &lt;math&gt;\psi &lt;/math&gt; that the vote of a given voter is decisive

: &lt;math&gt;
\psi=P_j \sim 2^{-2j}\frac{(2j/e)^{2j}\sqrt{4\pi j}}{[(j/e)^j \sqrt{2\pi
j}]^{2}}\ =\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi j}} \sim \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The same approximation is obtained for an even number ''N''.

A mathematical investigation of the influence of possible correlations between the voters for the Penrose square root law was presented by Kirsch.&lt;ref name="kirsch"/&gt;

Penrose law is applied to construct Penrose-like systems of two-tier voting, including the [[Jagiellonian Compromise]] designed for the [[Council of the European Union]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8876">In [[propositional calculus]] and [[proof complexity]] a '''propositional proof system (pps)''', also called a '''Cook–Reckhow propositional proof system''', is system for proving [[classical logic|classical]] [[propositional logic|propositional]] tautologies.

== Mathematical definition ==
Formally a pps is a [[polynomial-time]] function ''P'' whose [[range (mathematics)|range]] is the set of all propositional tautologies (denoted TAUT).&lt;ref name="cr"/&gt; If ''A'' is a formula, then any ''x'' such that ''P''(''x'') = ''A'' is called a ''P''-proof of ''A''. The condition defining pps can be broken up as follows:

* [[Completeness (logic)|Completeness]]: every propositional [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] has a ''P''-proof,
* [[Soundness]]: if a propositional formula has a ''P''-proof then it is a tautology,
* [[Efficiency]]: ''P'' runs in [[polynomial time]].

In general, a proof system for a language ''L'' is a polynomial-time function whose range is ''L''. Thus, a propositional proof system is a proof system for TAUT.

Sometimes the following alternative definition is considered: a pps is given as a proof-verification algorithm ''P''(''A'',''x'') with two inputs.  If ''P'' accepts the pair (''A'',''x'') we say that ''x'' is a ''P''-proof of ''A''. ''P'' is required to run in polynomial time, and moreover, it must hold that ''A'' has a ''P''-proof if and only if it is a tautology.

If ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a pps according to the first definition, then ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; defined by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'',''x'') if and only if ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''A'' is a pps according to the second definition. Conversely, if ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a pps according to the second definition, then ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; defined by
:&lt;math&gt;P_1(\langle x,A\rangle)=\begin{cases}A&amp;\text{if }P_2(A,x)\\\top&amp;\text{otherwise}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
(''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; takes pairs as input) is a pps according to the first definition, where &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed tautology.

== Algorithmic interpretation ==
One can view the second definition as a non-deterministic algorithm for solving membership in TAUT. This means that proving a superpolynomial proof size lower-bound for pps would rule out existence of a certain class of polynomial-time algorithms based on that pps.

As an example, exponential proof size lower-bounds in [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]] for the [[pigeon hole principle]] imply that any algorithm based on resolution cannot decide TAUT or SAT efficiently and will fail on [[pigeon hole principle]] tautologies. This is significant because the class of algorithms based on resolution includes most of current propositional proof search algorithms and modern industrial SAT solvers.

== History ==
Historically, [[Frege's propositional calculus]] was the first propositional proof system. The general definition of a propositional proof system is due to [[Stephen Cook]] and [[Robert A. Reckhow]] (1979).&lt;ref name="cr"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Stephen|last1=Cook|authorlink1=Stephen Cook|first2=Robert A.|last2=Reckhow|title=The Relative Efficiency of Propositional Proof Systems|journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic|volume=44|number=1|year=1979|pages=36–50|jstor=2273702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation with computational complexity theory ==
Propositional proof system can be compared using the notion of [[p-simulation]]. A propositional proof system ''P'' ''p-simulates'' ''Q'' (written as ''P''&amp;nbsp;≤&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''Q'') when there is a polynomial-time function ''F'' such that ''P''(''F''(''x'')) = ''Q''(''x'') for every ''x''.&lt;ref name="cr"/&gt; That is, given a ''Q''-proof ''x'', we can find in polynomial time a ''P''-proof of the same tautology. If ''P''&amp;nbsp;≤&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''Q'' and ''Q''&amp;nbsp;≤&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''P'', the proof systems ''P'' and ''Q'' are ''p-equivalent''. There is also a weaker notion of simulation: a pps ''P'' ''simulates'' or ''weakly p-simulates'' a pps ''Q'' if there is a polynomial ''p'' such that for every ''Q''-proof ''x'' of a tautology ''A'', there is a ''P''-proof ''y'' of ''A'' such that the length of ''y'', |''y''| is at most ''p''(|''x''|). (Some authors use the words p-simulation and simulation interchangeably for either of these two concepts, usually the latter.)

A propositional proof system is called ''p-optimal'' if it ''p''-simulates all other propositional proof systems, and it is ''optimal'' if it simulates all other pps. A propositional proof system ''P'' is ''polynomially bounded'' (also called super) if every tautology has a short (i.e., polynomial-size) ''P''-proof.

If ''P'' is polynomially bounded and ''Q'' simulates ''P'', then ''Q'' is also polynomially bounded.

The set of propositional tautologies, TAUT, is a [[coNP]]-complete set. A propositional proof system is a certificate-verifier for membership in TAUT. Existence of a polynomially bounded propositional proof system means that there is a verifier with polynomial-size certificates, i.e., TAUT is in [[NP (complexity)|NP]]. In fact these two statements are equivalent, i.e., there is a polynomially bounded propositional proof system if and only if the complexity classes NP and [[coNP]] are equal.&lt;ref name="cr"/&gt;

Some equivalence classes of proof systems under simulation or ''p''-simulation are closely related to theories of [[bounded arithmetic]]; they are essentially "non-uniform" versions of the bounded arithmetic, in the same way that circuit classes are non-uniform versions of resource-based complexity classes. "Extended Frege" systems (allowing the introduction of new variables by definition) correspond in this way to polynomially-bounded systems, for example. Where the bounded arithmetic in turn corresponds to a circuit-based complexity class, there are often similarities between the theory of proof systems and the theory of the circuit families, such as matching lower bound results and separations. For example, just as counting cannot be done by an [[AC0|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{AC}^0&lt;/math&gt;]] circuit family of subexponential size, many tautologies relating to the [[pigeonhole principle]] cannot have subexponential proofs in a proof system based on bounded-depth formulas (and in particular, not by resolution-based systems, since they rely solely on depth 1 formulas).

==Spelling==
The spelling "queueing" over "queuing" is typically encountered in the academic research field. In fact, one of the flagship journals of the profession is named ''[[Queueing Systems]]''.

== Single queueing nodes ==
Single queueing nodes are usually described using [[Kendall's notation]] in the form ''A''/''S''/''C'' where ''A'' describes the time between arrivals to the queue, ''S'' the size of jobs and ''C'' the number of servers at the node.&lt;ref name="tijms"&gt;Tijms, H.C, ''Algorithmic Analysis of Queues", Chapter 9 in  A First Course in Stochastic Models, Wiley, Chichester, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kendall | first1 = D.

Markov, Extension of the law of large numbers to dependent quantities, Izvestiia Fiz.-Matem. Obsch. Kazan Univ., (2nd Ser.), 15(1906), pp. 135&amp;ndash;156 [Also [37], pp.
339&amp;ndash;361].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, [[Agner Krarup Erlang]], a Danish engineer who worked for the Copenhagen Telephone Exchange, published the first paper on what would now be called queueing theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pass.maths.org.uk/issue2/erlang/index.html |title=Agner Krarup Erlang (1878 - 1929) &amp;#124; plus.maths.org |publisher=Pass.maths.org.uk |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Asmussen | first1 = S.

* M stands for Markov or memoryless and means arrivals occur according to a Poisson process
* D stands for deterministic and means jobs arriving at the queue which require a fixed amount of service
* ''k'' describes the number of servers at the queueing node (''k'' = 1, 2,...). If there are more jobs at the node than there are servers, then jobs will queue and wait for service

The [[M/M/1 queue]] is a simple model where a single server serves jobs that arrive according to a Poisson process and have [[exponentially distributed]] service requirements. In an [[M/G/1 queue]], the G stands for general and indicates an arbitrary [[probability distribution]]. The M/G/1 model was solved by [[Felix Pollaczek]] in 1930,&lt;ref&gt;Pollaczek, F., Ueber eine Aufgabe der Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie, Math. Z. 1930&lt;/ref&gt; a solution later recast in probabilistic terms by [[Aleksandr Khinchin]] and now known as the [[Pollaczek–Khinchine formula]].&lt;ref name="century" /&gt;&lt;ref name="century1" /&gt;

The [[matrix geometric method]] and [[matrix analytic method]]s have allowed queues with [[phase-type distribution|phase-type distributed]] inter-arrival and service time distributions to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ramaswami | first1 = V. | doi = 10.1080/15326348808807077 | title = A stable recursion for the steady state vector in markov chains of m/g/1 type | journal = Communications in Statistics.

Problems such as performance metrics for the [[M/G/k queue]] remain an open problem.&lt;ref name="century" /&gt;&lt;ref name="century1" /&gt;

[[File:Fifo queue.png|thumb|350px|First in first out (FIFO) queue example.]]
Various scheduling policies can be used at queuing nodes:

;[[LIFO (computing)|Last in first out]]: This principle also serves customers one at a time, but the customer with the shortest [[Mean sojourn time|waiting time]] will be served first.&lt;ref name="penttinen"/&gt; Also known as a [[Stack (data structure)|stack]].
;[[Processor sharing]]: Service capacity is shared equally between customers.&lt;ref name="penttinen"/&gt;
;Priority: Customers with high priority are served first.&lt;ref name="penttinen"/&gt; Priority queues can be of two types, non-preemptive (where a job in service cannot be interrupted) and preemptive (where a job in service can be interrupted by a higher-priority job). No work is lost in either model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Harchol-Balter | first1 = M.|author1-link=Mor Harchol-Balter | chapter = Scheduling: Non-Preemptive, Size-Based Policies | doi = 10.1017/CBO9781139226424.039 | title = Performance Modeling and Design of Computer Systems | pages = 499 | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781139226424 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Service facility
*Single server: customers line up and there is only one server
*Several parallel servers - Single queue: customers line up and there are several servers
*Several servers - Several queues: there are many counters and customers can decide going where to queue

;Customer’s behavior of waiting
*Balking: customers deciding not to join the queue if it is too long
*Jockeying: customers switch between queues if they think they will get served faster by doing so
*Reneging: customers leave the queue if they have waited too long for service

==Simple two-equation queue==
A common basic queuing system is attributed to [[Erlang distribution|Erlang]], though its exact origin remains unclear. The queue refers to a single server with one demand rate (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;), one dropout rate (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;), and one rate of service (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;), for which the length of the queue ''L'' is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{\delta-\sigma}{\mu}
&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming an exponential distribution for the rates, the waiting time ''W'' can be defined as the proportion of demand that is served. This is equal to the exponential survival rate of those who do not drop out over the waiting period, giving:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sigma}{\delta} = e^{-W{\mu}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The second equation is commonly rewritten as:

&lt;math&gt;W = \frac{1}{\mu}ln\frac{\delta}{\mu}
&lt;/math&gt;

The two-stage one-box model is common in epidemiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hernández-Suarez|first=Carlos|date=2010|title=An application of queuing theory to SIS and SEIS epidemic models|url=|journal=Math. Biosci.|volume=7|pages=809–823|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Queueing networks==
Networks of queues are systems in which a number of queues are connected by what's known as customer routing. When a customer is serviced at one node it can join another node and queue for service, or leave the network.

For networks of ''m'' nodes, the state of the system can be described by an ''m''–dimensional vector (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the number of customers at each node.

The simplest non-trivial network of queues is called [[Jackson network|tandem queues]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~winkel/bs3a07l13-14.pdf#page=4&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant results in this area were [[Jackson network]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = J.

The [[normalizing constant]] can be calculated with the [[Buzen's algorithm]], proposed in 1973.&lt;ref name="buzen-1973"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buzen | first1 = J. P. | authorlink = Jeffrey P.

Networks of customers have also been investigated, [[Kelly network]]s where customers of different classes experience different priority levels at different service nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = F.

&lt;/math&gt;

===Routing algorithms===
In discrete time networks where there is a constraint on which service nodes can be active at any time, the max-weight scheduling algorithm chooses a service policy to give optimal throughput in the case that each job visits only a single person &lt;ref name="Manuel" /&gt;service node. In the more general case where jobs can visit more than one node, [[backpressure routing]] gives optimal throughput. A [[network scheduler]] must choose a [[queuing algorithm]], which affects the characteristics of the larger network{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}. See also [[Stochastic scheduling]] for more about scheduling of queueing systems.

==Mean field limits==
[[Mean field model]]s consider the limiting behaviour of the [[empirical measure]] (proportion of queues in different states) as the number of queues (''m'' above) goes to infinity.

==Fluid limits==
{{main article|fluid limit}}
Fluid models are continuous deterministic analogs of queueing networks obtained by taking the limit when the process is scaled in time and space, allowing heterogeneous objects. This scaled trajectory converges to a deterministic equation which allows the stability of the system to be proven. It is known that a queueing network can be stable, but have an unstable fluid limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bramson | first1 = M. | title = A stable queueing network with unstable fluid model | doi = 10.1214/aoap/1029962815 | journal = The Annals of Applied Probability | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 818 | year = 1999 | jstor = 2667284| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heavy traffic/diffusion approximations==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3000">'''Raikov’s theorem''' is a result in [[probability theory]]. It is well known that if each of two [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] [[random variables]] ξ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ξ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a [[Poisson distribution]], then their sum ξ=ξ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+ξ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a Poisson distribution as well. It turns out that the converse is also valid &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. Raikov|first=|date=|year=1937|title=On the decomposition of Poisson laws|url=|journal=Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de l'URSS|volume=14|pages=9-11|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rukhin A.

V.|first=|publisher=Translations of Mathematical Monographs, 48. American Mathematical Society|year=1977|isbn=|location=Providence, R. I.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Statement of the theorem ==
Suppose that a random variable ξ  has a Poisson distribution and admits a decomposition as a sum ξ=ξ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+ξ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of two independent random variables. Then the distribution of each summand is a shifted Poisson's distribution.

== Comment ==
Raikov's theorem is similar to [[Cramér’s decomposition theorem]]. The latter result claims that if a sum of two independent random variables has normal distribution, then each summand is normally distributed as well. It was also proved by [[Yuri Linnik|Yu.V.Linnik]] that a convolution of normal distribution and Poisson's distribution possesses a similar property ([[Linnik's theorem]]).

== An extension to locally compact Abelian groups ==
Let  &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a locally compact Abelian group. Denote by &lt;math&gt;M^1(X)&lt;/math&gt;the convolution semigroup of probability distributions on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and by &lt;math&gt;E_x&lt;/math&gt;the degenerate distribution concentrated at &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;x_0\in X, \lambda&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

Poisson's distribution generated by the measure &lt;math&gt;\lambda E_{x_0}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as a shifted distribution of the form

&lt;math&gt;\mu=e(\lambda E_{x_0})=e^{-\lambda}(E_0+\lambda E_{x_0}+\lambda^2 E_{2x_0}/2!+\ldots+\lambda^n E_{nx_0}/n!+\ldots).&lt;/math&gt;

One has the following

== Raikov's theorem on locally compact Abelian groups ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; be the Poisson's distribution generated by the measure &lt;math&gt;\lambda E_{x_0}&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\mu=\mu_1*\mu_2&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\mu_j\in M^1(X)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is either an infinite order element, or has order 2, then &lt;math&gt;\mu_j&lt;/math&gt; is also a Poisson distribution. In the case of &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; being an element of finite order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n\ne 2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu_j&lt;/math&gt; can fail to be a Poisson distribution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7528">{{Distinguish|text=the [[mock theta function]]s discovered by Ramanujan}}

In [[mathematics]], particularly [[q-analog]] theory, the '''Ramanujan theta function''' generalizes the form of the Jacobi [[theta function]]s, while capturing their general properties.  In particular, the [[Jacobi triple product]] takes on a particularly elegant form when written in terms of the Ramanujan theta.  The function is named after [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]].

==Definition==
The Ramanujan theta function is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;f(a,b) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty
a^{n(n+1)/2} \; b^{n(n-1)/2} &lt;/math&gt;

for |''ab''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;1. The [[Jacobi triple product]] identity then takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;f(a,b) = (-a; ab)_\infty \;(-b; ab)_\infty \;(ab;ab)_\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the expression &lt;math&gt;(a;q)_n&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[q-Pochhammer symbol]]. Identities that follow from this include

:&lt;math&gt;f(q,q) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty q^{n^2} = 
{(-q;q^2)_\infty^2 (q^2;q^2)_\infty} &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;f(q,q^3) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty q^{n(n+1)/2} = 
{(q^2;q^2)_\infty}{(-q; q)_\infty} &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;f(-q,-q^2) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty (-1)^n q^{n(3n-1)/2} = 
(q;q)_\infty &lt;/math&gt;

this last being the [[Euler function]], which is closely related to the [[Dedekind eta function]]. The Jacobi [[theta function]] may be written in terms of the Ramanujan theta function as:

:&lt;math&gt;\vartheta(w, q)=f(qw^2,qw^{-2})&lt;/math&gt;

==Integral representations==

We have the following integral representation for the full two-parameter form of Ramanujan's theta function:&lt;ref name="SQSERIES-MDS"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=M. D.|title=Square series generating function transformations|journal=Journal of Inequalities and Special Functions|date=2017|volume=8|issue=2|url=http://www.ilirias.com/jiasf/repository/docs/JIASF8-2-11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
f(a,b) &amp; = 1 + \int_0^{\infty} \frac{2a e^{-t^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\left[ 
     \frac{1 - a \sqrt{ab} \cosh\left(\sqrt{\log(ab)} t\right)}{ 
     a^3 b - 2a \sqrt{ab} \cosh\left(\sqrt{\log(ab)} t\right) + 1} 
     \right] dt  + 
     \int_0^{\infty} \frac{2b e^{-t^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\left[ 
     \frac{1 - b \sqrt{ab} \cosh\left(\sqrt{\log(ab)} t\right)}{ 
     a b^3 - 2b \sqrt{ab} \cosh\left(\sqrt{\log(ab)} t\right) + 1} 
     \right] dt. 
\end{align} 
&lt;/math&gt;

The special cases of Ramanujan's theta functions given by &lt;math&gt;\varphi(q) := f(q, q)&lt;/math&gt; {{oeis|id=A000122}} and &lt;math&gt;\psi(q) := f(q, q^3)&lt;/math&gt; {{oeis|id=A010054}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weisstein|first1=Eric W.|title=Ramanujan Theta Functions|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RamanujanThetaFunctions.html|website=MathWorld|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also have the following integral representations:&lt;ref name="SQSERIES-MDS" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
\varphi(q) &amp; = 1 + \int_0^{\infty} \frac{e^{-t^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} 
     \left[\frac{4q \left(1-q^2 \cosh\left( 
     \sqrt{2 \log(q)} t\right)\right)}{q^4-2 q^2
     \cosh\left(\sqrt{2 \log(q)} t\right) + 1} 
     \right] dt \\ 
\psi(q) &amp; = \int_0^{\infty} 
     \frac{2 e^{-t^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} 
     \left[\frac{\left(1-\sqrt{q} 
     \cosh\left(\sqrt{\log(q)} t\right)\right)}{q-2 \sqrt{q} 
     \cosh\left(\sqrt{\log(q)} t\right) + 1} 
     \right] dt. 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This leads to several special case integrals for constants defined by these functions when &lt;math&gt;q := \exp(-k\pi)&lt;/math&gt; (cf. [[Theta function#Explicit values|theta function explicit values]]). In particular, we have that &lt;ref name="SQSERIES-MDS" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align} 
\varphi\left(e^{-k\pi}\right) &amp; = 
     1 + \int_0^{\infty} \frac{e^{-t^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \left[ 
     \frac{4 e^{k\pi} \left(e^{2k\pi} - \cos\left(\sqrt{2\pi k} t\right) 
     \right)}{e^{4k\pi} - 2 e^{2k\pi} \cos\left(\sqrt{2\pi k} t\right) + 1} 
     \right] dt \\ 
\frac{\pi^{1/4}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)} &amp; = 
     1 + \int_0^{\infty} \frac{e^{-t^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \left[ 
     \frac{4 e^{\pi} \left(e^{2\pi} - \cos\left(\sqrt{2\pi} t\right) 
     \right)}{e^{4\pi} - 2 e^{2\pi} \cos\left(\sqrt{2\pi} t\right) + 1} 
     \right] dt \\ 
\frac{\pi^{1/4}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)} \cdot 
     \frac{\sqrt{\sqrt{2} + 2}}{2} &amp; = 
     1 + \int_0^{\infty} \frac{e^{-t^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \left[ 
     \frac{4 e^{2\pi} \left(e^{4\pi} - \cos\left(2 \sqrt{\pi} t\right) 
     \right)}{e^{8\pi} - 2 e^{4\pi} \cos\left(2 \sqrt{\pi} t\right) + 1} 
     \right] dt \\ 
\frac{\pi^{1/4}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)} \cdot 
     \frac{\sqrt{\sqrt{3} + 1}}{2^{1/4} 3^{3/8}} &amp; = 
     1 + \int_0^{\infty} \frac{e^{-t^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \left[ 
     \frac{4 e^{3\pi} \left(e^{6\pi} - \cos\left(\sqrt{6 \pi} t\right) 
     \right)}{e^{12\pi} - 2 e^{6\pi} \cos\left(\sqrt{6 \pi} t\right) + 1} 
     \right] dt \\ 
\frac{\pi^{1/4}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)} \cdot 
     \frac{\sqrt{5 + 2 \sqrt{5}}}{5^{3/4}} &amp; = 
     1 + \int_0^{\infty} \frac{e^{-t^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \left[ 
     \frac{4 e^{5\pi} \left(e^{10\pi} - \cos\left(\sqrt{10 \pi} t\right) 
     \right)}{e^{20\pi} - 2 e^{10\pi} \cos\left(\sqrt{10 \pi} t\right) + 1} 
     \right] dt. 
\end{align} 
&lt;/math&gt;

and that

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align} 
\psi\left(e^{-k\pi}\right) &amp; = 
     \int_0^{\infty} \frac{e^{-t^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \left[ 
     \frac{\cos\left(\sqrt{k \pi} t\right) - e^{k\pi / 2}}{ 
     \cos\left(\sqrt{k \pi} t\right) - \cosh\left(\frac{k\pi}{2}\right)} 
     \right] dt \\ 
\frac{\pi^{1/4}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)} \cdot 
     \frac{e^{\pi / 8}}{2^{5/8}} &amp; = 
     \int_0^{\infty} \frac{e^{-t^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \left[ 
     \frac{\cos\left(\sqrt{\pi} t\right) - e^{\pi / 2}}{

\frac{\pi^{1/4}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)} \cdot

However, RaptorX is also significantly different from those profile-based methods (e.g., [[HHpred / HHsearch]] and [[Phyre / Phyre2]]) in that RaptorX excels at modeling of protein sequences without a large number of sequence homologs by exploiting structure information. RaptorX Server has been designed to ensure a user-friendly interface for users inexpert in protein structure prediction methods.

== Description ==

The RaptorX project was started in 2008 and RaptorX Server&lt;ref name=RaptorXServer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Källberg|first=Morten |author2=Haipeng Wang |author3=Sheng Wang |author4=Jian Peng |author5=Zhiyong Wang |author6=Hui Lu |author7=Jinbo Xu|title=Template-based protein structure modeling using the RaptorX web server|journal=Nature Protocols|date=July 2012|volume=7|pages=1511–1522|doi=10.1038/nprot.2012.085|pmid=22814390|url=http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v7/n8/full/nprot.2012.085.html|issue=8 |pmc=4730388}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was released to the public in 2011.

== Standard usage ==

After pasting a protein sequence into the RaptorX submission form, a user will typically wait a couple of hours (depending on sequence length) for a prediction to complete. An email is sent to the user together with a link to a web page of results. RaptorX Server currently generates the following results: 3-state and 8-state secondary structure prediction, sequence-template alignment, 3D structure prediction, solvent accessibility prediction, disorder prediction and binding site prediction. The predicted results are displayed to support visual examination. The result files are also available for download.

RaptorX Server also produces some confidence scores indicating the quality of the predicted 3D models (in the absence of their corresponding native structures). For example, it produces P-value for relative global quality of a 3D model, [[Global distance test|GDT (Global Distance Test)]] and uGDT (unnormalized-GDT) for absolute global quality of a 3D model and per-position [[RMSD]] for absolute local quality at each residue of a 3D model.

Below are some screenshots of RaptorX Server.

== Applications and performance ==
Applications of RaptorX include protein structure prediction, function prediction, protein sequence-structure alignment, evolutionary classification of proteins, guiding [[site-directed mutagenesis]] and solving protein crystal structures by [[molecular replacement]]. In the [[CASP]]9 blind protein structure prediction experiment, RaptorX was ranked 2nd out of about 80 automatic structure prediction servers. RaptorX also generated the best alignments for the 50 hardest [[CASP]]9 TBM(template-based modeling) targets. in [[CASP]]10, RaptorX is the only server group among the top 10 human/server groups for the 15 most difficult [[CASP]]10 TBM targets.

== History ==
RaptorX is the successor to the [[RAPTOR]] protein structure prediction system. RAPTOR was designed and developed by Dr. Jinbo Xu and Dr. Ming Li at the University of Waterloo. RaptorX was designed and developed by a research group led by Prof. Jinbo Xu at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago.

The '''small-angle approximation''' is a useful simplification of the basic [[trigonometric functions]] which is approximately true in the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] where the angle approaches zero. They are truncations of the [[Taylor series]] for the basic trigonometric functions to a [[orders of approximation|second-order approximation]].  This truncation gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sin \theta &amp;\approx \theta \\
\cos \theta &amp;\approx 1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2} \\
\tan \theta &amp;\approx \theta, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|θ}} is the angle in [[radian]]s.

The small angle approximation is useful in many areas of engineering and physics, including [[mechanics]], [[electromagnetics]], [[optics]] (where it forms the basis of the [[paraxial approximation]]), [[cartography]], [[astronomy]], [[computer science]], and so on.

== Justifications ==

=== Graphic ===
The accuracy of the approximations can be seen below in Figure 1 and Figure 2. As the angle approaches zero, it is clear that the gap between the approximation and the original function quickly vanishes.
&lt;gallery widths="500px" heights="400px"&gt;
File:Small_angle_compair_odd.svg|'''Figure 1.''' A comparison of the basic odd trigonometric functions to {{math|θ}}. It is seen that as the angle approaches 0 the approximations become better.
File:Small_angle_compare_even.svg|'''Figure 2.''' A comparison of {{math|cos ''θ''}} to {{math|1 − {{sfrac|''θ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|2}}}}. It is seen that as the angle approaches 0 the approximation becomes better.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Geometric ===
:[[File:Small angle triangle.svg|600px]]
The red section on the right, {{math|d}}, is the difference between the lengths of the hypotenuse, {{mvar|H}}, and the adjacent side, {{mvar|A}}. As is shown, {{mvar|H}} and {{mvar|A}} are almost the same length, meaning {{math|cos ''θ''}} is close to 1 and {{math|{{sfrac|''θ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|2}}}} helps trim the red away.
:&lt;math&gt; \cos{\theta} \approx 1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The opposite leg, {{mvar|O}}, is approximately equal to the length of the blue arc, {{mvar|s}}. Gathering facts from geometry, {{math|''s'' {{=}} ''Aθ''}}, from trigonometry, {{math|sin ''θ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''O''|''H''}}}} and {{math|tan ''θ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''O''|''A''}}}}, and from the picture, {{math|''O'' ≈ ''s''}} and {{math|''H'' ≈ ''A''}} leads to:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta = \frac{O}{H}\approx\frac{O}{A} = \tan \theta = \frac{O}{A} \approx \frac{s}{A} = \frac{A\theta}{A} = \theta.&lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying leaves,

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta \approx \tan \theta \approx \theta.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Calculus ===
&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta \approx \theta&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\tan \theta \approx \theta&lt;/math&gt; , {{math|cos ''θ'' ≈ 1 − {{sfrac|''θ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|2}}}}

can also be expressed this way, considering the fact that θ tends to zero

{{math|{{sfrac|''sin (θ)''|θ}}≈1}} , {{math|{{sfrac|''tan (θ)''|θ}}≈1}} ,  &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta \approx 1.&lt;/math&gt; 

In fact, an approximation can also be synonymous with the word "limit" and θ in radians, being too small, tends to zero. It can be proved using Squeeze Theorem that in terms of limit calculus,
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \lim_{\theta\to 0} \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta} =1, \\[10pt]
&amp; \lim_{\theta\to 0} \frac{\tan(\theta)}{\theta} =1, \\[10pt]
&amp; \lim_{\theta\to 0} {cos(\theta)} = 1.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Algebraic ===
[[File:Small-angle approximation for sine function.svg|thumb|300px|The small-angle approximation for the sine function.]]
The Maclaurin expansion (the Taylor expansion about 0) of the relevant trigonometric function is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Mary L. Boas|last=Boas|first=Mary L.|title=[[Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences]]|year=2006|publisher=Wiley|page=26|isbn=978-0-471-19826-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \sin \theta &amp;= \sum^{\infin}_{n=0} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} \theta^{2n+1} \\
&amp;= \theta - \frac{\theta^3}{3!} + \frac{\theta^5}{5!} - \frac{\theta^7}{7!} + \cdots \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|θ}} is the angle in radians. In clearer terms, 

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta = \theta - \frac{\theta^3}{6} + \frac{\theta^5}{120} - \frac{\theta^7}{5040} + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

It is readily seen that the second most significant (third-order) term falls off as the cube of the first term; thus, even for a not-so-small argument such as 0.01, the value of the second most significant term is on the order of {{val|0.000001}}, or {{sfrac|{{val|10000}}}} the first term. One can thus safely approximate: 

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta \approx \theta&lt;/math&gt;

By extension, since the cosine of a small angle is very nearly 1, and the tangent is given by the sine divided by the cosine, 

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \theta \approx \sin \theta \approx \theta&lt;/math&gt;,

==Error of the approximations==
[[File:Small angle compare error.svg|thumb|upright=2|'''Figure 3.''' A graph of the [[relative error]]s for the small angle approximations.]]
Figure 3 shows the relative errors of the small angle approximations. The angles at which the relative error exceeds 1% are as follows:
* {{math|tan ''θ'' ≈ ''θ''}} at about 0.176 radians (10°).
* {{math|sin ''θ'' ≈ ''θ''}} at about 0.244 radians (14°).
* {{math|cos ''θ'' ≈ 1 − {{sfrac|''θ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|2}}}} at about 0.664 radians (38°).

==Specific uses==

=== Astronomy ===
In [[astronomy]], the angle subtended by the image of a distant object is often only a few [[arcsecond]]s, so it is well suited to the small angle approximation. The linear size ({{mvar|D}}) is related to the angular size ({{mvar|X}}) and the distance from the observer ({{mvar|d}}) by the simple formula

:&lt;math&gt;D = X \frac{d}{206\,265}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|X}} is measured in arcseconds.

The number {{val|206265}} is approximately equal to the number of arcseconds in a [[circle]] ({{val|1296000}}), divided by {{math|2π}}.

The exact formula is

:&lt;math&gt;D = d \tan \left( X \frac{2\pi}{1\,296\,000} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

and the above approximation follows when {{math|tan ''X''}} is replaced by {{mvar|X}}.

=== Motion of a pendulum ===
The second-order cosine approximation is especially useful in calculating the [[potential energy]] of a [[pendulum]], which can then be applied with a [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] to find the indirect (energy) equation of motion.

When calculating the [[frequency|period]] of a simple pendulum, the small-angle approximation for sine is used to allow the resulting differential equation to be solved easily by comparison with the differential equation describing [[simple harmonic motion]].

=== Structural mechanics ===
The small-angle approximation also appears in structural mechanics, especially in stability and bifurcation analyses (mainly of axially-loaded columns ready to undergo [[buckling]]). This leads to significant simplifications, though at a cost in accuracy and insight into the true behavior.
=== Piloting ===
The [[1 in 60 rule]] used in [[air navigation]] has its basis in the small-angle approximation, plus the fact that one radian is approximately 60 degrees.

=== Interpolation ===

Small-angle formulas may be used for interpolating between trigonometric table values. When β ≈ 0, then sin(β) ≈ β, cos(β) ≈ 1, and the angle [[Angle sum and difference identities|sum and difference identities]] reduce to:  

cos(α + β) ≈ cos(α) - βsin(α), 

cos(α - β) ≈ cos(α) + βsin(α),

sin(α + β) ≈ sin(α) + βcos(α),

sin(α - β) ≈ sin(α) - βcos(α).

Example: sin(0.755)
       sin(0.755) =  sin(0.75 + 0.005)
                  ≈  sin(0.75) + (0.005)cos(0.75)	 [sin(0.75) and cos(0.75) values from trigonometric table]
                  ≈  (0.6816) + (0.005)(0.7317)	
                  ≈  0.6853.

'''Soil production function''' refers to the rate of [[bedrock]] [[weathering]] into [[soil]] as a function of soil thickness. 

A general model suggested that the rate of physical [[weathering]] of bedrock (de/dt) can be represented as an exponential decline with soil thickness:

&lt;math&gt; de/dt = P_0 \exp{[-k h]}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is soil thickness [m], ''P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' [mm/year] is the potential (or maximum) weathering rate of bedrock and ''k'' [m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;] is an empirical constant.&lt;ref&gt;Heimsath, A.M., Dietrich, W.E., Nishiizumi, K., Finkel, R.C., 1997. The soil production function and landscape equilibrium. Nature 388 (6640), 358–361&lt;/ref&gt; 

The reduction of weathering rate with thickening of soil is related to the exponential decrease of [[temperature]] amplitude with increasing depth below the soil surface, and also the exponential decrease in average water penetration (for freely-drained soils). Parameters ''P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''k'' are related to the [[climate]] and type of parent materials. {{Harvtxt|Heimsath|Dietrich|Nishiizumi|Finkel|1997}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heimsath |first=A.

Meanwhile values of ''k'' do not vary significantly, ranging from 2 to 4 m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

A number of [[landscape evolution model]]s have adopted the so-called ''humped'' model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://serc.carleton.edu/42696 The humped soil production function] Arjun Heimsath. Arizona State University, Earth and Space Exploration  &lt;/ref&gt; This model dates back to [[Grove Karl Gilbert|G.K. Gilbert's]] ''Report on the Geology of the Henry Mountains'' (1877). Gilbert reasoned that the [[weathering]] of bedrock was fastest under an intermediate thickness of soil and slower under exposed bedrock or under thick mantled soil. This is because chemical [[weathering]] requires the presence of water. Under thin soil or exposed bedrock water tends to run off, reducing the chance of the decomposition of bedrock.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7767">In the mathematical field of [[set theory]], the '''Solovay model''' is a [[model theory|model]] constructed by {{harvs|txt|first=Robert M. |last=Solovay|authorlink=Robert M. Solovay|year=1970}} in which all of the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF) hold, exclusive of the [[axiom of choice]], but in which all [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of [[real number]]s are [[Lebesgue measurable]].  The construction relies on the existence of an [[inaccessible cardinal]].

In this way Solovay showed that the axiom of choice is essential to the proof of the existence of a [[non-measurable set]], at least granted that the existence of an inaccessible cardinal is consistent with [[ZFC]], the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory including the axiom of choice.

==Statement==
ZF stands for Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, and DC for the [[axiom of dependent choice]].

Solovay's theorem is as follows. 
Assuming the existence of an inaccessible cardinal, there is an [[inner model]] of ZF + DC of a suitable [[forcing extension]] ''V''[''G''] such that every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, has the [[perfect set property]], and has the [[Baire property]].

==Construction==
Solovay constructed his model in two steps, starting with a model ''M'' of ZFC containing an inaccessible cardinal κ.

The first step is to take a [[Levy collapse]] ''M''[''G''] of ''M'' by adding a generic set ''G'' for the notion of forcing that collapses all cardinals less than κ to ω. Then ''M''[''G''] is a model of ZFC with the property that every set of reals that is definable over a countable sequence of ordinals is Lebesgue measurable, and has the Baire and perfect set properties. (This includes all definable and [[projective set]]s of reals; however for reasons related to [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]] the notion of a definable set of reals cannot be defined in the language of set theory, while the notion of a set of reals definable over a countable sequence of ordinals can be.)

The second step is to construct Solovay's model ''N'' as the class of all sets in ''M''[''G''] that are hereditarily definable over a countable sequence of ordinals. The model ''N'' is an inner model of ''M''[''G''] satisfying ZF + DC such that every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, has the perfect set property, and has the Baire property. The proof of this uses the fact that every real in ''M''[''G''] is definable over a countable sequence of ordinals, and hence ''N'' and ''M''[''G''] have the same reals.

Instead of using Solovay's model ''N'', one can also use the smaller inner model [[L(R)|''L''('''R''')]] of ''M''[''G''], consisting of the constructible closure of the real numbers, which has similar properties.

==Complements==

Solovay suggested in his paper that the use of an inaccessible cardinal might not be necessary. Several authors proved weaker versions of Solovay's result without assuming the existence of an inaccessible cardinal. In particular {{harvtxt|Krivine|1969}} showed there was a model of ZFC in which every ordinal-definable set of reals is measurable, Solovay showed there is a model of ZF + DC in which there is some translation-invariant extension of Lebesgue measure to all subsets of the reals, and {{harvtxt|Shelah|1984}} showed that there is a model in which all sets of reals have the Baire property (so that the inaccessible cardinal is indeed unnecessary in this case).

The case of the perfect set property was solved by {{harvtxt|Specker|1957}}, who showed (in ZF) that if every set of reals has the perfect set property and the first uncountable cardinal ℵ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is regular then ℵ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is inaccessible in the [[constructible universe]]. Combined with Solovay's result, this shows that the statements "There is an inaccessible cardinal" and "Every set of reals has the perfect set property" are equiconsistent over ZF.

Finally, {{harvtxt|Shelah|1984}} showed that consistency of an inaccessible cardinal  is also necessary for constructing a model in which all sets of reals are Lebesgue measurable. More precisely he showed that if every [[Projective hierarchy#Table|'''Σ'''{{su|p=1|b=3}}]] set of reals is measurable then the first uncountable cardinal ℵ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is inaccessible in the constructible universe, so that the condition about an inaccessible cardinal cannot be dropped from Solovay's theorem. Shelah also showed that the '''Σ'''{{su|p=1|b=3}} condition is close to the best possible by constructing a model (without using an inaccessible cardinal) in which all '''Δ'''{{su|p=1|b=3}} sets of reals are measurable. See {{harvtxt|Raisonnier|1984}} and {{harvtxt|Stern|1985}} and {{harvtxt|Miller|1989}} for expositions of Shelah's result.

{{harvtxt|Shelah|Woodin|1990}} showed that if [[supercompact cardinal]]s exist then every set of reals in ''L''('''R'''), the constructible sets generated by the reals, is Lebesgue measurable and has the Baire property; this includes every "reasonably definable" set of reals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3989">In [[representation theory]], the '''stable module category''' is a category in which projectives are "factored out."

== Definition ==
Let ''R'' be a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. For two [[module (mathematics)|module]]s ''M'' and ''N'', define &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(M,N)&lt;/math&gt; to be the set of ''R''-linear maps from ''M'' to ''N'' modulo the relation that ''f''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;''g'' if ''f''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''g'' factors through a [[projective module]]. The stable module category is defined by setting the objects to be the ''R''-modules, and the morphisms are the equivalence classes &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(M,N)&lt;/math&gt;.

Given a module ''M'', let ''P'' be a projective module with a surjection &lt;math&gt;p \colon P \to M&lt;/math&gt;. Then set &lt;math&gt;\Omega(M)&lt;/math&gt; to be the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of ''p''. Suppose we are given a morphism &lt;math&gt;f \colon M \to N&lt;/math&gt; and a surjection &lt;math&gt;q \colon Q \to N&lt;/math&gt; where ''Q'' is projective. Then one can lift ''f'' to a map &lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt; which maps &lt;math&gt;\Omega(M)&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\Omega(N)&lt;/math&gt;. This gives a well-defined functor &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; from the stable module category to itself.

For certain rings, such as [[Frobenius algebra]]s, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is an [[equivalence of categories]]. In this case, the inverse &lt;math&gt;\Omega^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as follows. Given ''M'', find an [[injective module]] ''I'' with an inclusion &lt;math&gt;i \colon M \to I&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\Omega^{-1}(M)&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the [[cokernel]] of ''i''. A case of particular interest is when the ring ''R'' is a [[group algebra]].

The functor Ω&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; can even be defined on the module category of a general ring (without factoring out projectives), as the cokernel of the [[injective envelope]].  It need not be true in this case that the functor Ω&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is actually an inverse to Ω.  One important property of the stable module category is it allows defining the Ω functor for general rings.  When ''R'' is [[perfect ring|perfect]] (or ''M'' is [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] and ''R'' is [[semiperfect ring|semiperfect]]), then Ω(''M'') can be defined as the kernel of the [[projective cover]], giving a functor on the module category.  However, in general projective covers need not exist, and so passing to the stable module category is necessary.

== Connections with cohomology ==
Now we suppose that ''R = kG'' is a group algebra for some [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'' and some [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G''. One can show that there exist isomorphisms
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(\Omega^n(M), N) \cong \mathrm{Ext}^n_{kG}(M,N) \cong \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(M, \Omega^{-n}(N))&lt;/math&gt;
for every positive integer ''n''. The [[group cohomology]] of a representation ''M'' is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{H}^n(G; M) = \mathrm{Ext}^n_{kG}(k, M)&lt;/math&gt; where ''k'' has a trivial ''G''-action, so in this way the stable module category gives a natural setting in which group cohomology lives. 

Furthermore, the above isomorphism suggests defining cohomology groups for negative values of ''n'', and in this way, one recovers [[Tate cohomology]].

== Triangulated structure ==

An exact sequence 
: &lt;math&gt; 0 \to X \to E \to Y \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
in the usual module category defines an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ext}^1_{kG}(Y,X)&lt;/math&gt;, and hence an element of &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(Y, \Omega^{-1}(X))&lt;/math&gt;, so that we get a sequence
: &lt;math&gt; X \to E \to Y \to \Omega^{-1}(X).&lt;/math&gt;
Taking &lt;math&gt;\Omega^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to be the translation functor and such sequences as above to be exact triangles, the stable module category becomes a [[triangulated category]].

'''Stratification''' has several usages in mathematics.

==In mathematical logic==
In [[mathematical logic]], '''stratification''' is any consistent assignment of numbers to [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] symbols guaranteeing that a unique formal [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of a logical theory exists. Specifically, we say that a set of [[Clause (logic)|clauses]] of the form &lt;math&gt;Q_1 \wedge \dots \wedge Q_n \wedge \neg Q_{n+1} \wedge \dots \wedge \neg Q_{n+m} \rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt; is stratified if and only if
there is a stratification assignment S that fulfills the following conditions:

# If a predicate P is positively derived from a predicate Q (i.e., P is the head of a rule, and Q occurs positively in the body of the same rule), then the stratification number of P must be greater than or equal to the stratification number of Q, in short &lt;math&gt;S(P) \geq S(Q)&lt;/math&gt;.
# If a predicate P is derived from a negated predicate Q (i.e., P is the head of a rule, and Q occurs negatively in the body of the same rule), then the stratification number of P must be greater than the stratification number of Q, in short &lt;math&gt;S(P) &gt; S(Q)&lt;/math&gt;.

The notion of stratified negation leads to a very effective operational semantics for stratified programs in terms of the stratified least fixpoint, that is obtained by iteratively applying the fixpoint operator to each ''stratum'' of the program, from the lowest one up.
Stratification is not only useful for guaranteeing unique interpretation of [[Horn clause]]
theories. It has also been used by [[W.V. Quine]] (1937) to address [[Russell's paradox]], which undermined [[Frege]]'s central work ''[[Grundgesetze der Arithmetik]]'' (1902).

==In set theory==
In [[New Foundations]] (NF) and related set theories, a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in the language of first-order logic with equality and membership is said to be
'''stratified''' if and only if there is a function
&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; which sends each variable appearing in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (considered as an item of syntax) to
a natural number (this works equally well if all integers are used) in such a way that
any atomic formula &lt;math&gt;x \in y&lt;/math&gt; appearing in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x)+1 = \sigma(y)&lt;/math&gt; and any [[atomic formula]] &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt; appearing in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x) = \sigma(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

It turns out that it is sufficient to require that these conditions be satisfied only when
both variables in an atomic formula are bound in the set abstract &lt;math&gt;\{x \mid \phi\}&lt;/math&gt;
under consideration.  A set abstract satisfying this weaker condition is said to be
'''weakly stratified'''.

The stratification of [[New Foundations]] generalizes readily to languages with more
predicates and with term constructions.  Each primitive predicate needs to have specified
required displacements between values of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; at its (bound) arguments
in a (weakly) stratified formula.  In a language with term constructions, terms themselves
need to be assigned values under &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, with fixed displacements from the
values of each of their (bound) arguments in a (weakly) stratified formula.  Defined term
constructions are neatly handled by (possibly merely implicitly) using the theory
of descriptions:  a term &lt;math&gt;(\iota x.\phi)&lt;/math&gt; (the x such that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;) must
be assigned the same value under &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; as the variable x.

A formula is stratified if and only if it is possible to assign types to all variables appearing
in the formula in such a way that it will make sense in a version TST of the theory of
types described in the [[New Foundations]] article, and this is probably the best way
to understand the stratification of [[New Foundations]] in practice.

The notion of stratification can be extended to the [[lambda calculus]]; this is found
in papers of Randall Holmes.

==In topology==
In [[singularity theory]], there is a different meaning, of a decomposition of a [[topological space]] ''X'' into disjoint subsets each of which is a [[topological manifold]] (so that in particular a  ''stratification'' defines a  [[partition of a set|partition]] of the topological space). This is not a useful notion when unrestricted; but when the various '''strata''' are defined by some recognisable set of conditions (for example being [[locally closed]]), and fit together manageably, this idea is often applied in geometry. [[Hassler Whitney]] and [[René Thom]] first defined formal conditions for stratification.  See [[Whitney stratification]] and [[topologically stratified space]].

==In statistics==
See [[stratified sampling]].

*{{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1}}, {{nowrap|1=''a'' − ''b'' = 1}}; then {{nowrap|''a&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' − ''b&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}} = 1 which has no prime divisors
*{{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}}, {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b''}} a [[power of two]]; then any odd prime factors of {{nowrap|''a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''}} = {{nowrap|''(a + b)(a&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; - b&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)''}} must be contained in {{nowrap|''a&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; - b&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, which is also even
*{{nowrap|1=''n'' = 6}}, {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 2}}, {{nowrap|1=''b'' = 1}}; then {{nowrap|''a&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'' − ''b&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;''}} = 63 = 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;×7 = {{nowrap|''(a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' − ''b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' − ''b&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)''}}

This generalizes Bang's theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Taltheoretiske Undersøgelser|author = A. S. Bang|journal = Tidsskrift for Mathematik|series = 5|volume = 4|pages = 70–80|year = 1886|jstor = 24539988|publisher = Mathematica Scandinavica}} And {{cite journal|title = Taltheoretiske Undersøgelser (continued, see p. 80)|pages = 130–137|jstor = 24540006}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which states that if {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 1}} and ''n'' is not equal to 6, then {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} has a prime divisor not dividing any {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} with {{nowrap|''k'' &lt; ''n''}}.

Similarly, {{nowrap|''a&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' + ''b&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}} has at least one primitive prime divisor with the exception {{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 9}}.

Zsigmondy's theorem is often useful, especially in group theory, where it is used to prove that various groups have distinct orders except when they are known to be the same.{{what?|date=October 2016}}

==History==
The theorem was discovered by Zsigmondy working in [[Vienna]] from 1894 until 1925.

== Generalizations ==
Let &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\ge1}&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of nonzero integers.
The '''Zsigmondy set''' associated to the sequence is the set

&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{Z}(a_n) = \{ n \ge 1 : a_n \text{ has no primitive prime divisors} \}.
&lt;/math&gt;

i.e., the set of indices &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that every prime dividing &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt;
also divides some &lt;math&gt;a_m&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;m &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;. Thus Zsigmondy's theorem implies that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}(a^n-b^n)\subset\{1,2,6\}&lt;/math&gt;, and [[Carmichael's theorem]] says that the
Zsigmondy set of the [[Fibonacci sequence]] is &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,6,12\}&lt;/math&gt;, and that of the [[Pell sequence]] is &lt;math&gt;\{1\}&lt;/math&gt;. In 2001 Bilu, Hanrot, and 
Voutier&lt;ref&gt;Y. Bilu, G. Hanrot, P.M. Voutier, Existence of primitive divisors of Lucas and Lehmer numbers, ''J. Reine Angew. Math.'' '''539''' (2001), 75-122&lt;/ref&gt;
proved that in general, if &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\ge1}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Lucas sequence]] or a [[Lehmer number|Lehmer sequence]], then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}(a_n) \subseteq \{ 1 \le n \le 30 \}&lt;/math&gt; (see {{oeis|id=A285314}}, there are only 13 such &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;s, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 18, 30).
Lucas and Lehmer sequences are examples of [[divisibility sequence]]s.

It is also known that
if &lt;math&gt;(W_n)_{n\ge1}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[elliptic divisibility sequence]], then its Zsigmondy
set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}(W_n)&lt;/math&gt; is finite.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Silverman,
Wieferich's criterion and the ''abc''-conjecture,
''J. Number Theory'' '''30''' (1988), 226-237&lt;/ref&gt; However, the result is ineffective in the sense
that the proof does give an explicit upper bound for the largest element in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}(W_n)&lt;/math&gt;,
although it is possible to give an effective upper bound for the number of elements
in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}(W_n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;P. Ingram, J.H. Silverman, Uniform estimates for primitive divisors in elliptic divisibility sequences, ''Number theory, Analysis and Geometry'', Springer-Verlag, 2010, 233-263.&lt;/ref&gt;
