      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14681">The '''2012–13 Stratfor email leak''' is the public disclosure of a number of internal emails between geopolitical intelligence company [[Stratfor]]'s employees and its clients, referred to by [[WikiLeaks]] as the Global Intelligence Files. E-mails began appearing on WikiLeaks on February 27, 2012, with 5,543,061 emails published as of July 18, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/releases.html |title=The Global Intelligence Files |publisher=[[WikiLeaks]] |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710162601/https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/releases.html |archive-date=2015-07-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stratfor is a security group based in [[Austin, Texas]]. On December 24, 2011, hackers took control of Stratfor's website and released a list of names, credit card numbers, passwords, and home and email addresses. Those listed were affiliated with organizations such as [[Bank of America]], the [[United States Department of Defense]], [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], [[Lockheed Martin]], [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Perlroth |first1=Nicole |title=Questions About Motives Behind Stratfor Hack |url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/27/questions-about-motives-behind-stratfor-hack/ |accessdate=November 27, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=December 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hackers included [[Jeremy Hammond]], who worked with [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] to release Stratfor's emails to WikiLeaks. The emails revealed Stratfor's surveillance of groups such as [[Occupy Wall Street]] and protestors of the [[Bhopal disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kopfstein |first1=Janus |title=Hacker with a Cause |url=https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/hacker-with-a-cause |accessdate=November 27, 2018 |work=The New Yorker |date=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The e-mails claim to include client information, notes between Stratfor employees and internal procedural documentation on securing intelligence data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks' Stratfor Email Release Raises Uncomfortable Questions |author=Fahmida Y. Rashid |url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/WikiLeaks-Stratfor-Email-Release-Raises-Uncomfortable-Questions-734788/ |newspaper=[[eWeek]] |date=February 27, 2012 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These communications date from July 2004 through to December 2011.&lt;ref name="India"&gt;{{cite news |title=Stratfor was Dow’s Bhopal spy: WikiLeaks |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Stratfor-was-Dows-Bhopal-spy-WikiLeaks/articleshow/12062587.cms |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |date=February 28, 2012 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks said it had obtained the e-mails from the hacker group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], who [[Stratfor#2011 hacking incident|broke into Stratfor's computer network in 2011]].&lt;ref name="AP1"&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks publishes leaked Stratfor emails |author=Cassandra Vinograd and Raphael Satter |url=https://news.yahoo.com/wikileaks-publishes-leaked-stratfor-emails-135816242.html |newspaper=Yahoo! News |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=February 27, 2012 |accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an initial announcement, WikiLeaks stated that they opened up a [[database]] of the emails to two dozen media organizations operating in several countries, including [[the McClatchy Company]], ''[[l'Espresso]]'', ''[[la Repubblica]]'', [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], the ''[[Russia Reporter]]'',&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'',&lt;ref name="AP1"/&gt; along with a "sneak preview" to [[the Yes Men]].&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

==Email content==
One of the first items released was an email containing a glossary titled "The Stratfor Glossary of Useful, Baffling and Strange Intelligence Terms", which contained concise and sometimes humorously candid definitions, along with pointed assessments of U.S. intelligence and law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks begins disclosing intelligence firm's e-mails |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/02/26/us/wikileaks-stratfor/ |newspaper=[[CNN]] |date=February 27, 2012 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governmental===
An email involving a Stratfor analyst stated that it had been determined that up to 12 officials in Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) agency knew of [[Osama bin-Laden]]'s safe house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stratfor: Osama bin Laden 'was in routine contact with Pakistan's spy agency' |author=Damien McElroy |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/9109457/Stratfor-Osama-bin-Laden-was-in-routine-contact-with-Pakistans-spy-agency.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=February 27, 2012 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[Ynetnews]]'' reported that, according to internal emails between Stratfor employees, [[Israel]] and [[Russia]] were engaged in an exchange of information in 2008. Israel gave Russia "'data link codes' for unmanned aerial vehicles that the Jewish state sold to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]" and that Russia gave "the codes for [[Tor-M1]] missile defense systems that Russia sold Iran". The emails also stated that, during the [[2008 South Ossetia war]], Georgia "realized that their UAVs were compromised and were looking for a replacement for the Israeli made drones".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks: Russia gave Israel Iranian system's codes |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4196367,00.html |newspaper=[[Ynetnews]] |date=February 28, 2012 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[International Business Times]]'' reported that Stratfor had found that several [[Central Europe]]an countries, especially the [[Czech Republic]], have been petitioning [[NATO]] for missile defenses and [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]] to use against Russia. The Czech Republic, according to an unknown Stratfor source, has stated that, if the talks with the US fail, then it will be breaking all ties with NATO and the US in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The WikiLeaks GiFiles: Central Europe States Warn of 'Russian Threat' |author=Anissa Haddadi |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/305348/20120227/wikileaks-gifiles-stratfor-reveals-central-european-states.htm |newspaper=[[International Business Times]] |date=February 27, 2012 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Business Insider]]'' reported that Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] was an intelligence source for Stratfor between 2007 and 2010. In emails, Fred Burton discussed his personal communications with Netanyahu. Burton stated by email that Netanyahu informed him of his success in consolidating power within the [[Likud party]] ahead of regaining the position of prime minister, shared thoughts regarding his distrust of US President [[Barack Obama]], threatened assassination of [[Hezbollah]] leader [[Hasan Nasrallah]], and declared intentions to unilaterally start a war against [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Benjamin Netanyahu Was A Stratfor Source From 2007 To 2010 |author=Michael Kelley |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/leaked-stratfor-emails-benjamin-nentanyahu-was-a-stratfor-source-from-2007-to-2010-2012-3 |newspaper=[[Business Insider]] |date=March 27, 2012 |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)|Al Akhbar]]'', citing internal emails from the Stratfor hack, reported former [[Academi|Blackwater]] director James F. Smith had a relationship with Stratfor and was for a time considered one of their major sources. 
&lt;!-- Commented because of UNDUE and POV. As of the date of this comment, the references added are dead and are biased. There is also no citation directly from Wikileaks.

Over 40,000 documents related with information gathering from [[Venezuela]] including the status of the army (equipment, numbers, plans) and other sensitive information were also released. Various attempts at overthrowing the government of [[Hugo Chavez]] are described from sources inside Venezuela, with references to names such as [[Antonio Ledezma]] (Caracas mayor), [[Henrique Capriles]] (opposition leader), [[Leopoldo Lopez]], [[Rafael Poleo]] (media tycoon). Many papers involve [[Centre for Applied Non Violent Actions and Strategies|CANVAS]], as one of the main strategic counsel. One of the documents is titled "how to guide to revolution".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.correodelorinoco.gob.ve/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/COI147.pdf Correo del Orinoco International] 22.3.2013 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikileaks-press.org/tag/venezuela/ Wikileaks Press]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.pravda.ru/world/americas/26-02-2013/123897-usa_overthrow_chavez-0/ English pravda 26.02.2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

===Companies===
As reported by ''[[The Times of India]]'', some of the emails reveal that Stratfor was allegedly hired by [[Dow Chemical Company]] to spy on protesters of the [[Bhopal disaster]].&lt;ref name="India"/&gt; Dow Chemical Company responded with a written statement that read: "Major companies are often required to take appropriate action to protect their people and safeguard their facilities," and that it had not broken any laws.&lt;ref name="AP1"/&gt;

The ''[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'' reported that, according to some of the released emails, the [[Coca-Cola Company]] paid Stratfor to determine "to what extent will US-based [[PETA]] supporters travel to Canada to support activism" at the [[2010 Olympics]]. The Coca-Cola Company responded to the emails with a statement saying that they "consider it prudent to monitor for protest activities at any major event we sponsor".&lt;ref name="MST"&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks publishes leaked Stratfor emails, casting light on workings of private US intel firm |author=Paul J. Weber and Raphael Satter |url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/140697693.html |newspaper=[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]] |date=February 28, 2012 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wikileaks===
Emails from Fred Burton (Stratfor’s Vice-President for Counterterrorism and Corporate Security, and former Deputy Chief of the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]) allege a United States Government secret indictment against [[WikiLeaks]] founder [[Julian Assange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PRESS RELEASE – STRATFOR EMAILS: US HAS ISSUED SEALED INDICTMENT AGAINST JULIAN ASSANGE|url=https://wikileaks.org/Stratfor-Emails-US-Has-Issued.html|work=Stratfor Email Leaks|publisher=WikiLeaks|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other emails cast doubt on the rape allegations against Assange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STRATFOR EMAILS: STRATFOR SYDNEY BASED WATCH OFFICER CHRIS FARNHAM CONNECTION TO SWEDISH WOMAN IN ASSANGE CASE|url=https://wikileaks.org/Stratfor-Sydney-Based-Watch.html|work=StratFor Email Leaks|publisher=WikiLeaks|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==

===Official response===
Around midnight on February 27, Stratfor released a statement saying that "the release of its stolen emails was an attempt to silence and intimidate it." It also dismissed rumors of CEO George Friedman's resignation.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

Stratfor stated that some of the leaked emails "may be forged or altered to include inaccuracies; some may be authentic", but that they would not confirm either possibility. They further stated that the emails represented candid internal language that would probably be ripe for misinterpretation.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks targets global risk company Stratfor |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/27/wikileaks-stratfor-idUSL5E8DR0120120227 |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |date=February 27, 2012 |accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WikiLeaks founder [[Julian Assange]] told [[Reuters]] that his concerns with Stratfor stem from it being a private intelligence firm relying on informants from government agencies with dubious reputations, both from the U.S. and abroad, and especially its monitoring of activist organizations.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; He also called the company a "shadow CIA" (a term originally coined by Barron's magazine in a 2001 article about the quality of Stratfor's analysis, not any actual association with the CIA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.barrons.com/articles/SB1002927557434087960|title=The Shadow CIA|last=Laing|first=Jonathan R.|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and stated that the emails would "reveal Stratfor's web of informers, payoff structure, payment-laundering techniques and psychological methods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks: Stratfor emails reveal problems with Web security |author=Mark Seibel |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/02/29/3773515/wikileaks-stratfor-emails-reveal.html |newspaper=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]] |date=February 29, 2012 |accessdate=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other responses===
Former [[National Security Agency|NSA]] Director [[Bobby Inman]] stated that the leak would be damaging to Stratfor's business. He had previously stated that Stratfor was competent, delivering high-quality intelligence analyses.&lt;ref name="MST"/&gt;

Max Fisher, the associate director of ''[[The Atlantic]]'', argued that Stratfor has a poor reputation "among foreign policy writers, analysts, and practitioners" and that as a result Anonymous and Wikileaks have exaggerated the significance of the information they released. He also suggested that Assange may have targeted a relatively unimportant firm and over-hyped the results in order to "regain some of his former glory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Max|title=Stratfor Is a Joke and So Is Wikileaks for Taking It Seriously|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/02/stratfor-is-a-joke-and-so-is-wikileaks-for-taking-them-seriously/253681/|accessdate=March 5, 2012|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] foreign correspondent and Stratfor subscriber Mark Corcoran also wrote that the e-mails showed Stratfor's methods used to gather information are similar to those employed by journalists, though he wrote that the quality of its reports are often inferior to news reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Corcoran|first=Mark|title=Confessions of a Stratfor subscriber|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-02-29/corcoran-confessions-of-a-stratfor-subscriber/3859418|accessdate=March 5, 2012|newspaper=The Drum|date=February 29, 2012|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military Commissions Act==

The [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] mandated that Guantanamo captives were no longer entitled to access the US civil justice system, so all outstanding habeas corpus petitions were stayed.&lt;ref name=McaLetter2006-10-16&gt;

==Boumediene v. Bush==

On June 12, 2008 the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled, in [[Boumediene v. Bush]], that the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] could not remove the right for [[Guantanamo captives]] to access the US Federal Court system.  And all previous Guantanamo captives' habeas petitions were eligible to be re-instated.

'''Archives of Manitoba''' is the official government archive of the [[Canadian province]] of [[Manitoba]]. It is located at 200 Vaughan Street in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], Canada.

The [[Hudson's Bay Company]] Archives are part of the Archives of Manitoba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Celebrating ten years of Hudson's Bay Company's gifts to Manitoba and to Canada.(Anniversary) |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-31130135_ITM| coauthors= |date=June 1, 2004|work=The Beaver: Exploring Canada's History |accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archives also holds the papers of Manitoba premier Sir [[Hugh John Macdonald]], son of Canadian prime minister Sir [[John A. Macdonald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-162301349/macdonald-papers-archives-manitoba.html|title=Macdonald papers at the archives of Manitoba.(Documents &amp; Archives)(Sir John A.

==Hudson's Bay Company Archives==
The Hudson's Bay Company Archives (HBCA) are thousands of mainly hand-written records and maps of the Hudson's Bay Company employees for hundreds of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Celebrating ten years of Hudson's Bay Company's gifts to Manitoba and to Canada.(Anniversary)| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-31130135_ITM|coauthors= |date=June 1, 2004|work=The Beaver: Exploring Canada's History |accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/1073591321.html?dids=1073591321:1073591321&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+08%2C+2006&amp;author=Cleo+Paskal&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Peg%27s+history+a+gift+for+tourists&amp;pqatl=google|title=Peg's history a gift for tourists |last=Paskal |first=Cleo |date=July 8, 2006 |work= Toronto Star  |page=K.02 |accessdate=11 January 2010|location= Toronto, Ont. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This important archive is one of Canada's national treasures, and is a part of the [[United Nations]] [[Memory of the World]] project.  The purchase of Rupert's Land from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] is the largest land purchase in Canada's history. Rupert's Land referred to the vast water drainage basin that flows into Hudson Bay. The water basin includes the areas now known as Manitoba, Saskatchewan, parts of Alberta, Northern Ontario, Minnesota, and North Dakota. The lakes and rivers were used for travel and trading, and they stretch from Ontario to Alberta, and far south into what is now the United States.

The Hudson's Bay Company's records provide the original [[recorded history|written history]] of the HBC since its inception in 1670 by [[Prince Rupert]] and others.  [[Henry Hudson]] was the first European to explore and map the shores of the great bay. The first [[Hudson's Bay Company]] trading forts were built along the southern shores of [[Hudson Bay]] to provide the shortest trade route to Europe from the middle of North America.  [[Rupert's Land]] consisted of the vast watershed of rivers that drained into Hudson Bay which gave access to the far western and central parts of [[North America]]. The abundance of archival documents provide the original written history of the fur trade, North American exploration and mapping, native peoples, treaty making, and the original development of the Nation of [[Canada]].  The thousands of documents supply important knowledge about the growth of the HBC's retail empire that led to one of the largest land purchases in world history, along with the original settlements of Western Canada.  The archives protect the original written documents that detail the European exploration and settlement of the western frontier.  Many of these documents provide detailed descriptions of native groups, forts, rivers, lakes, animals, populations, and the difficult working conditions of fur traders.

The Hudson's Bay Company Archives makes the records available and accessible to many people locally, nationally, and internationally.  Their database can be searched online, and some documents are now available online.

'''Softnose skates''' are a family, the Arhynchobatidae, of skates belonging to the order Rajiformes in the superorder [[Batoidea]] of [[Ray (fish)|rays]]. At least 104 species have been described, in 13 genera. Softnose skates have at times been placed in the same family as [[Rajidae|hardnose skates]], but most recent authors recognize them as a distinct family.&lt;ref&gt;MCEACHRAN, J.D. &amp; DUNN, K.A. &amp; MIYAKE, T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3094">The '''''Army List''''' is a list (or more accurately seven series of lists) of serving regular, [[militia]] or territorial [[British Army]] officers, kept in one form or another, since 1702.

Manuscript lists of army officers were kept from 1702–1752, the first official list being published in 1740.

==Regular army==
* Annual Army Lists, 1754–1879 (WO 65)
* Quarterly Army Lists (First Series), 1879–1922
* Half-Yearly Army Lists, 1923 - Feb 1950 (From 1947, annual, despite the name)
* Modern Army Lists, 1951-Ongoing
** Part 1; serving officers.
** Part 2; retired officers, as of 2011 four-yearly
** Part 3; the Gradation List, a short biography of officers, a restricted publication  not generally available.

==Other lists==
* Monthly Army Lists, 1798-June 1940. Officers of colonial, militia and territorial units are included.
* Quarterly Army Lists (Second Series), July 1940-December 1950. These superseded the Monthly Army Lists, and, for the remainder of [[World War II]] were not published but  produced as confidential documents, monthly or bi-monthly until December 1943 and quarterly until April 1947, then three times a year, April, August and December.
* [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] List, 1939–1945
* Militia Lists - various militia lists pertaining to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries are extant.
* ''[[Hart's Army List]]'', an unofficial list, produced between 1839 and 1915, containing details of war service which the official lists started covering only in 1881.

'''''Bomba the Jungle Boy''''' is a series of American boy's adventure books produced by the  [[Stratemeyer Syndicate]] under the pseudonym [[Roy Rockwood]] and published by Cupples &amp; Leon in the first half of the 20th century in imitation of the successful [[Tarzan]] series.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

There are 20 books in the series. The first ten are set in [[South America]], where Bomba, a white boy who grew up in the jungle, tries to discover his origin. The second set of ten books shift the scene to [[Africa]], where a slightly older Bomba has jungle adventures.

A common theme of the Bomba books is that Bomba, because he is white, has a soul that is awake, while his friends, the dark-skinned natives, have souls that are sleeping. [[Richard A. Lupoff]], in his book ''Master of Adventure'', a study of the works of Tarzan creator [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], describes the Bomba tales as more blatantly racist than the often-criticized Tarzan books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Master of Adventure|last=Lupoff|first=Richard|publisher=Bison Books|year=2005|isbn=978-0803280304|location=https://books.google.com/books?id=FQkIXCLxdPUC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=master+of+adventure+bomba&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_9aUY-300n&amp;sig=6VwhW5KwnYjhiAs665-w8yYxcHg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwib5IGM4tXMAhVH1GMKHQ_zCTgQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=master%20of%20adventure%20bomba&amp;f=false|pages=185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1949, [[Monogram Pictures]] brought the character to the motion-picture screen in 12 Bomba films, starring [[Johnny Sheffield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Beebe|first=Ford|title=Bomba, the Jungle Boy|date=1949-03-20|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041196/|accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheffield was already established as an outdoor star; he had portrayed the character Boy in the Tarzan movies with [[Johnny Weissmuller]]. When the Bomba films, all set in Africa, proved popular with young audiences, the first 10 Bomba books were reprinted in the 1950s by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], a publisher of many popular series books such as the [[Hardy Boys]] and [[Nancy Drew]]. These same books were reprinted again by Clover Books, a short-lived publisher that also reprinted the Grosset &amp; Dunlap series [[Tom Quest]].

In 1962, [[WGN-TV]] repackaged the Bomba films as a [[prime time]] summertime series called ''Zim Bomba'' that became a local ratings sensation. WGN executive [[Fred Silverman]] stated that "Zim" meant "Son of" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]].&lt;ref&gt;p.15 Smith, Sally Bedell ''Up the Tube: Prime Time TV and the Silverman Years'' 1981 Viking Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967–68, [[DC Comics]] published a series of seven comic books based on the character.

==Books==
All of the first editions had the same picture on the dust jacket; only the title was different. The Grosset &amp; Dunlap books had different pictures on the dust jacket of each title. The Clover editions had no dust jackets but had picture covers reprinting the Grosset &amp; Dunlap art.

===Background===
[[Walter Mirisch]] had been general manager of [[Monogram Pictures]] since 1945. They specialised in low budget movies, including series of regular characters such as [[Charlie Chan]], [[Joe Palooka]] and the [[Bowery Boys]]. Mirisch looked at the success of the ''Tarzan'' films and remembered the ''Bomba'' novels; he thought they might offer material to do a similar type of movie.

In November 1947 Monogram announced they had bought the rights to twenty of the stories. They assigned [[Walter Mirisch]] to oversee their production and said they intended to make three ''Bomba'' films per year. They were going to be in colour.&lt;ref&gt;By THOMAS F BRADYSpecial to THE NEW,YORK TIMES. (1947, Nov 27). GEIGER WILL FILM DI DONATO'S NOVEL. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.sl.nsw.gov.au/docview/108040272?accountid=13902&lt;/ref&gt; They were seeking a male actor aged 18 to 20 to star.&lt;ref&gt;Schallert, E. (1947, Nov 28). DRAMA AND FILM. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.sl.nsw.gov.au/docview/165782044?accountid=13902&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1948 Monogram's president [[Steve Broidy]] announced that the studio would make two Bomba films over the following year. (Other series at the studio included [[Joe Palooka]], [[Charlie Chan]] and [[Bowery Boys]].)&lt;ref&gt;Studio to turn out 61 pictures during 1948-49. (1948, Sep 14). Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.sl.nsw.gov.au/docview/165890270?accountid=13902&lt;/ref&gt;

Mirisch later claimed he was paid $2,500 a film, and the success of the series launched him as a producer.&lt;ref&gt;Clooney, N. (1998, Mar 13). Oscar's popularity a 70-year tradition.

'''Boothe Memorial Park and Museum''' sits on a {{convert|32|acre|m2|sing=on}} site in the [[Putney, Connecticut|Putney]] section of [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]], [[Connecticut]]. Built about 1840 and remodeled in 1914, it is said to be "The Oldest [[Homestead (buildings)|Homestead]] in America,"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.damnedct.com/boothe-memorial-park-stratford/&lt;/ref&gt; since it sits on the foundations of a 1663 house, and has been continuously occupied. Circa 1914 two brothers, David Beach Boothe and Stephen Nichols Boothe, created the '''Boothe Memorial Museum''' which maintains a collection of twenty architecturally unique buildings. Some of the structures include a carriage house, Americana Museum, miniature lighthouse, windmill, a clock tower museum, trolley station, chapel, and a blacksmith shop. The property became a public park owned by the town of Stratford in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/17/nyregion/friends-keep-watch-over-grand-collection.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Boothe Memorial Park and Museum was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on May 1, 1985.

==Observatory==
The BMAS (Boothe Memorial Astronomical Society) Observatory was built in 1957 on the grounds of the park, located near the cemetery. The observatory features two telescopes: a 16-inch [[Cassegrain reflector|Cassegrain]] (1960) and 4 inch [[Unitron]] refractor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmas.org/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmas.org/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory is open for public observing at 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on the first and third Friday of each month.

==Putney chapel==
Originally constructed in 1844 for [[Congregationalist]] services,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=ScKfcrmyDdoC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22putney+chapel%22+%2Bstratford&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aq1SGP9YYR&amp;sig=HeeCinwWNXSeJQFudnSq1HHYhEk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oiL5TK6oBcP7lwff7JzlBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22putney%20chapel%22%20%2Bstratford&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; the Putney Chapel was moved onto Boothe Park grounds in 1968 from a nearby location on Chapel Street.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.putneychapel.org/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; The chapel is officially non-denominational, handicapped accessible and can still be used as a place of worship or for events, being rentable by the day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.putneychapel.org/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toll booth==
[[Image:Boothe Memorial Park, Stratford, CT.jpg|thumb|left|Other buildings in the park]]
The park also contains the last remaining highway [[Toll house|toll booth]] in Connecticut. It was removed from the [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]] side of the [[Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge]] at the end of the [[Merritt Parkway]], when state toll booths were abolished in June 1988. The booth is of wooden log architecture and is also on the list of National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=25903&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The park grounds are open year long, free of charge.

===Astronomy===
The BMAS group meets the first and third Friday of every month from 8pm-10pm and is open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmas.org/calendar.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birding===
The park is often a destination for bird watchers, and attracts a number of different species due to the large open areas, many trees and the nearby [[Housatonic River]]. 
A September 2010 bird watching festival held by the [[List of Connecticut Audubon Society facilities|Connecticut Audubon Society]] found 262 birds of 49 species, including the [[bald eagle]], [[double-crested cormorant]], [[downy woodpecker]], [[great blue heron]], [[monk parakeet]] and [[red-tailed hawk]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ctaudubon.blogspot.com/search?q=monk+parakeet&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum tours===
Guided tours are available from June 1 to November 1 on Tuesdays &amp; Fridays between 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.-1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.; Saturdays &amp; Sundays 1:00pm–4:00 pm.&lt;ref&gt;http://boothememorialpark.org/info.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of summer, when brood rearing ceases and this sugar source is no longer available, yellow jackets become frantic for sugar, and can be baited with sugar-based baits. They are also much more likely to visit fall flowers for nectar, than they are earlier in the season.&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, there is rarely any evolutionary advantage for a bee to sting a mammal to defend itself as an individual; honey bees will generally only sting when the hive is directly threatened and honey bees found in the field or on a flower will rarely sting.&lt;/ref&gt; continues pumping.

[[File:Simple Labarum2.svg|thumb|right|135px|&lt;center&gt;The Chi-Rho symbol]]

The '''Chi Rho''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|aɪ|_|ˈ|r|oʊ}}; also known as ''chrismon'' or ''sigla''&lt;ref&gt;From a supposed [[Middle Latin]] ''[[:wikt:crismon|crismon]]''), specifically applied to the "Chrismon of Saint Ambrose" in [[Milan Cathedral]]. [http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/CRISMON Crismon] (par les Bénédictins de St. Maur, 1733–1736), in: du Cange, et al., ''Glossarium mediae et infimae latinitatis'', ed. augm., Niort: L. Favre, 1883‑1887, t. 2, col. 621b. "CRISMON, Nota quæ in libro ex voluntate uniuscujusque ad aliquid notandum ponitur. Papias in MS. Bituric. Crismon vel Chrismon proprie est Monogramma Christi sic expressum ☧"; [http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/CHRISMON1 1 chrismon]  (par les Bénédictins de St. Maur, 1733–1736), in: du Cange, et al., ''Glossarium mediae et infimae latinitatis'', ed. augm., Niort : L. Favre, 1883‑1887, t. 2, col. [http://media.enc.sorbonne.fr/ducange/jpg/C/318c.jpg 318c].&lt;/ref&gt;) is one of the earliest forms of [[christogram]], formed by superimposing the first two (capital) letters—[[chi (letter)|chi]] and [[rho]] ('''ΧΡ''')—of the Greek word {{lang|grc|'''ΧΡ'''ΙΣΤΟΣ}}  ([[Christ (title)|Christos]])  in such a way that the vertical stroke of the rho intersects the center of the chi.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Steffler|2002|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chi-Rho symbol was used by the [[Roman Emperors|Roman emperor]] [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] (r. 306–337) as part of a [[military standard]] ([[vexillum]]). Constantine's standard was known as the [[Labarum]]. Early symbols similar to the Chi Rho were the [[Staurogram]] ([[File:Christliche Symbolik (Menzel) I 193 2.jpg|20px]]) and the [[IX monogram]] ([[File:Christliche Symbolik (Menzel) I 193 4.jpg|20px]]).

In pre-Christian times, the Chi-Rho symbol was also to mark a particularly valuable or relevant passage in the margin of a page, abbreviating ''chrēston''  (good).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Southern|2001|p=281}}; {{harvnb|Grant|1998|p=142, citing Bruun, ''Studies in Constantinian Numismatics''}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some coins of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] (r. 246–222 BC) were marked with a Chi-Rho.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Reden|2007|p=69}}: "The ''chi-rho'' series of Euergetes' reign had been the most extensive series of bronze coins ever minted, comprising eight denominations from 1 ''chalkous'' to 4 obols."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although formed of Greek characters, the device (or its separate parts) is frequently found serving as an abbreviation in Latin text, with endings added appropriate to a Latin noun, thus ''XPo'', signifying ''Christo'', "to Christ", the [[dative]] form of ''Christus''.&lt;ref&gt;For example as inscribed on the [[monumental brass]] of [[Thomas de Camoys, 1st Baron Camoys]] (d.1421) in [[St George's Church, Trotton]], Sussex, England&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chi Rho symbol has two [[Unicode codepoint]]s: {{unichar|2627|Chi Rho}} in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols|Miscellaneous symbols block]] and  {{unichar|2CE9|Coptic symbol Khi Ro}} in the [[Coptic (Unicode block)|Coptic block]].

[[File:Missorium Kerch.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Missorium depicting Emperor Constantine's son Constantius II accompanied by a guardsman with the Chi-Rho depicted on his shield (at left, behind the horse).]]

== Origin and adoption ==
According to [[Lactantius]],&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius. ''On the Deaths of the Persecutors'', Chapter 44.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Latin]] historian of [[North Africa]]n origins saved from poverty by the Emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] (r. 306–337), who made him tutor to his son [[Crispus]], Constantine had dreamt of being ordered to put a "heavenly divine symbol" ({{lang-la|coeleste signum dei}}) on the [[shield]]s of his soldiers. The description of the actual symbol chosen by Emperor Constantine the next morning, as reported by Lactantius, is not very clear: it closely resembles a Chi-Rho or a staurogram ([[File:Christliche Symbolik (Menzel) I 193 2.jpg|20px]]), a similar Christian symbol. That very day Constantine's army fought the forces of [[Maxentius]] and won the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] (312), outside [[Rome]].

[[File:Konstantin den stores labarum, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|right|Emperor Constantine's [[labarum]], a standard incorporating the wreathed Chi-Rho, from an antique silver medal.]]

[[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (died in 339)  gave two different accounts of the events. In his church history, written shortly after the battle, when Eusebius hadn't yet had contact with Constantine, he doesn't mention any dream or vision, but compares the defeat of Maxentius (drowned in the [[Tiber]]) to that of the biblical [[pharaoh]] and credits Constantine's victory to divine protection.

In a memoir of the Roman emperor that Eusebius wrote after Constantine's death (''On the Life of Constantine'', circa 337–339), a miraculous appearance is said to have come in [[Gaul]] long before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge. In this later version, the Roman emperor had been pondering the misfortunes that befell commanders who invoked the help of many different gods, and decided to seek divine aid in the forthcoming battle from the One God. At noon, Constantine saw a cross of light imposed over the [[sun]]. Attached to it, in Greek characters, was the saying "Τούτῳ Νίκα!" (“In this sign you will conquer!”).&lt;ref&gt;The well known sentence [[In hoc signo vinces]] is simply a later Latin translation of Eusebius's Greek wording.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only Constantine, but the whole army saw the miracle. That night, [[Christ]] appeared to the Roman emperor in a dream and told him to make a replica of the sign he had seen in the sky, which would be a sure defence in battle.

Eusebius wrote in the ''Vita'' that Constantine himself had told him this story "and confirmed it with oaths" late in life "when I was deemed worthy of his acquaintance and company." "Indeed", says Eusebius, "had anyone else told this story, it would not have been easy to accept it."

Eusebius also left a description of the [[labarum]], the military standard which incorporated the Chi-Rho sign, used by Emperor Constantine in his later wars against Licinius.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius Pamphilius: ''Church History'', ''Life of Constantine'', ''Oration in Praise of Constantine'', Chapter 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chrismon Sancti Ambrosii.jpg|thumb|The so-called "Chrismon of [[Saint Ambrose]]" (''Chrismon Sancti Ambrosii''), on display on the eastern wall of [[Milan Cathedral]], a  Chi-Rho combined with [[Alpha and Omega]] in a circle. According to [[Landulf of Milan]] (12th century), it was used by [[Saint Ambrose]] to introduce the catechumens to the mysteries of the Christian faith (whence it was called "oracle" or ''[[:wikt:χρησμός|chresmos]]'' of St. Ambrose, written by Landulf as ''crismon'', whence the later [[New Latin]] term for the Chi-Rho symbol).&lt;ref&gt;Kenelm Henry Digby, ''Mores Catholici, Or, Ages of Faith'' vol. 1 (1844), [https://books.google.com/books?id=X-UQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA300 p. 300].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Millin, ''Voyage dans le Milanais'' (1817), [https://books.google.com/books?id=51ZCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA51 p. 51].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Later usage ==
{{See also|Resurrection of Jesus in Christian art}}

=== Late antiquity ===

An early visual representation of the connection between the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] and his resurrection, seen in the 4th century [[sarcophagus]] of [[Flavia Domitilla (saint)|Domitilla]] in Rome, the use of a wreath around the Chi-Rho symbolizes the victory of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] over death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harries|2004|p=8}}.
Sarcophagus with Scenes of the Passion (probably from the Catacomb of Domitilla), Rome, mid-fourth century. Marble, 23ʺ x 80ʺ. Museo Pio Christiano, Vatican, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Constantine, the Chi-Rho became part of the official [[imperial insignia]]. [[Archaeologists]] have uncovered evidence demonstrating that the Chi-Rho was [[Emblazonment|emblazoned]] on the [[helmets]] of some Late Roman soldiers. Coins and medallions minted during Emperor Constantine's reign also bore the Chi-Rho. By the year 350, the Chi-Rho began to be used on Christian [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] and [[fresco]]es. The usurper [[Magnentius]] appears to have been the first to use the Chi-Rho monogram flanked by [[Alpha and Omega]], on the reverse of some coins minted in 353.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kellner|1968|p=57ff}}. See also {{harvnb|Grigg|1977|p=469 (Note #4)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Roman Britannia]], a tesselated [[mosaic]] [[Hinton St Mary Mosaic|pavement was uncovered at Hinton St. Mary]], Dorset, in 1963. On stylistic grounds, it is dated to the 4th century; its central roundel represents a beardless male head and bust draped in a ''[[pallium]]'' in front of the Chi-Rho symbol, flanked by [[pomegranate]]s, symbols of eternal life. Another Romano-British Chi-Rho, in [[fresco]], was found at the site of a villa at [[Lullingstone Roman Villa|Lullingstone]] (illustrated). The symbol was also found on Late Roman Christian signet rings in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|1996|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insular Gospel books ===
In [[Insular art|Insular]] [[Gospel book]]s, the beginning of Matthew 1:18, at the end of his account of the [[genealogy of Christ]] and introducing his account of the life, so representing the moment of the [[Incarnation of Christ]], was usually marked with a heavily decorated page, where the letters of the first word "Christi" are abbreviated and written in Greek as "XPI", and often almost submerged by decoration.&lt;ref&gt;In the Latin [[Vulgate]] the verse was "Christi autem generatio sic erat cum esset desponsata mater eius Maria Ioseph antequam convenirent inventa est in utero habens de Spiritu Sancto" ("Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit")&lt;/ref&gt; Though the letters are written one after the other and the "X" and "P" not combined in a monogram, these are known as Chi-Rho pages. Famous examples are in the [[Book of Kells]] and [[Book of Lindisfarne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1980|pp=

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13547">'''Chronicles of Terror''' – a digital internet archive established by the {{ill|Witold Pilecki Center for Totalitarian Studies|pl|Ośrodek Badań nad Totalitaryzmami im. Witolda Pileckiego}} in August 2016. Initially, it provided access to the depositions of Polish citizens who after World War II were interviewed as witnesses before the [[Main Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes in Poland]]. From 17 September 2017, the database also presents the accounts of Poles who fell victim to repressions perpetrated by Communist totalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rp.pl/Historia/301259843-Internauci-poznaja-relacje-zolnierzy-Armii-Andersa.html|title=Internauci poznają relacje żołnierzy Armii Andersa - Historia - rp.pl|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The [[Main Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes in Poland]], set up in 1945, documented German crimes committed during World War II, conducted investigations and published the results of its activities. In 1949, its name was changed to the Main Commission for the Investigation of ''Hitlerite'' Crimes in Poland. The Commission was active throughout the country.

The Commission’s tasks, their scope expanded to include Communist terror, were taken over by the investigative division of the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] (IPN) in 1998. The Commission’s documentation, including witness testimonies, was also passed over to the archives of the Institute. Acting on the basis of an agreement dated 11 February 2016, the IPN started submitting digital copies of these materials with the objective of making them available over the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mkidn.gov.pl/np/pages/posts/100-dni-ministerstwa-kultury-i-dziedzictwa-narodowego-6049.php?p=300|title=Ministerstwo Kultury i Dziedzictwa Narodowego - 2016|last=MKiDN|website=www.mkidn.gov.pl|language=PL|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The “Chronicles of Terror” website premiered on 4 August 2016, initially providing access to a database containing more than 500 testimonies given before the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dzieje.pl/aktualnosci/ponad-500-swiadectw-terroru-niemieckiego-z-okresu-okupacji-ruszyl-portal-zapisyterrorupl|title=Ponad 500 świadectw terroru niemieckiego z okresu okupacji - ruszył portal Zapisyterroru.pl|work=dzieje.pl|access-date=2017-03-27|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://warszawa.wyborcza.pl/warszawa/1,34862,20497249,zeznania-swiadkow-hitlerowskich-zbrodni-dostepne-w-internecie.html?disableRedirects=true|title=Zeznania świadków hitlerowskich zbrodni dostępne w internecie.

On 25 January 2017 the Witold Pilecki Center for Totalitarian Studies signed an agreement with the Hoover Institution, pursuant to which “Chronicles of Terror” will be supplemented by depositions relating to Communist crimes, taken from the archives of Gen. [[Anders' Army|Anders’ Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anders.org.pl/index.php/pl/2017/01/25/amerykanskie-archiwum-andersa-w-polsce/|title=Amerykańskie archiwum Andersa w Polsce – WSPÓLNOTA ANDERSA|website=anders.org.pl|language=pl-PL|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hoover.org/news/hoover-joins-polish-ministry-culture-and-national-heritage-digitize-and-make-available|title=Hoover Joins The Polish Ministry Of Culture And National Heritage To Digitize And Make Available Thousands Of WWII Gulag Testimonies|work=Hoover Institution|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, documents containing the accounts of Poles – both soldiers and civilians who left the Soviet Union together with the Polish Army – were deposited with the Hoover Library, for it was feared that they could have been seized by the Communist authorities.

== Testimony database and its collections ==
“Chronicles of Terror” contains nearly 4,000 depositions (the majority are also available in English translations). Accounts describing crimes committed during World War II in Warsaw and its environs were published in first order. The database also holds depositions made by former prisoners of extermination camps and concentration camps. Plans have been made for its progressive expansion by the addition of testimonies concerning events that occurred in other locations.

In the spring of 2017, it published more than 500 depositions depicting the German Terror in Kielce region, and these were followed in October 2017 by accounts describing crimes committed by the invaders in Radom region. The following topics are addressed in the database.

=== Auschwitz ===
The database contains depositions pertaining to the complex of German camps in Oświęcim. These testimonies include the accounts both of prisoners of the concentration camp itself, and of the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] [[extermination camp]]. A number of them depict the [[Medical experiments at Auschwitz|medical experiments]] carried out on inmates and [[Sonderkommando]] members fate.

===Street Executions in occupied Warsaw===
Chronicles of Terror contains approximately 100 testimonies relating to the street executions that were regularly carried out in occupied Warsaw. The accounts include depositions made both by eyewitnesses and the families of victims. Selected testimonies have been brought together in a collection entitled ''Reign of terror – executions in the streets of Warsaw''

=== Pawiak ===
The Chronicles of Terror archive also has in its possession a dozen or so depositions made by former inmates of [[Pawiak]], including those of its female ward, the so-called Serbia. These testimonies describe conditions existing in the prison, the methods of torture used, and the murders committed within its walls. A part of them has been gathered in the collection entitled ''Pawiak – the Warsaw execution site.''

=== The Ochota massacre ===
More than 30 depositions devoted to the [[Ochota massacre|Ochota Massacre]] are available in the database. Amongst them are the accounts of employees of the Radium Institute: Antoni Borowiecki, Bronisława Mazurkiewicz and Józef Laskowski, who were eyewitnesses to the crimes committed at the facility. The website also presents depositions made by Karol Cugowski, Józef Górski and Lucjan Majchrzak, who survived the mass executions carried out in Grójecka Street despite having suffered gunshot wounds. The murders and rapes committed in the “Zieleniak” have been referred to, among others, in the account of Kazimierz Sucharzewski, who was forced by the executioners to assist in the burning of the bodies of victims, and that of an officer of the [[Home Army]], Fryderyk Korsak-Bartonezz. Romuald Jakubowski and Maria Lachert, in turn, witnessed the murder of the wounded by German units in field hospitals. The remaining accounts contain descriptions of crimes committed, among others, in Kolonia Lubeckiego, Kolonia Staszica and the so-called Reduta Wawelska (Wawelska Stronghold). Selected depositions have been gathered in the collection entitled ''Ochota Massacre – the suffering of the district.''

=== Wola massacre ===
The database holds more than 100 depositions concerning the [[Wola massacre|Wola Massacre]]. Amongst them is the testimony of Janina Rozińska, who was wounded by a grenade during the mass execution carried out at the Tramcar Depot in Młynarska Street, and of Wiesława Chełmińska, who, despite being shot, survived the series of murders perpetrated in St. Lazarus’ Hospital. Wacław Dąbrowski and Father Bernard Filipiuk escaped death and were able to describe the mass shooting carried out at the corner of Górczewska and Zagłoby streets, and also the crimes perpetrated at the Wolski Hospital in Płocka Street. In turn, the account of Wanda Lurie (who was eight months pregnant at the time) relates to the execution conducted in the Ursus Factory at Wolska Street 55, during which she lost three children and herself received a number of injuries. Finally, Kazimierz Gębczyński provided testimony on the crimes committed at Staszica Street 15, where he himself received a gunshot wound. The database also contains the accounts of members of the so-called ''Verbrennungskommando'' (Wacław Dziewulski, Mieczysław Gurbiel, Witold Guzikowski, Mieczysław Miniewski, Stanisław Turek and Franciszek Zasada), who were forced by the Germans to assist in the burning of the bodies of victims. The remaining depositions refer, among others, to the crimes perpetrated by German units in Franaszek’s Factory, Sowińskiego Park, and the area of Wolska Street and Górczewska Street. A part of these have been grouped in a special collection entitled ''Genocide in Wola – a district sentenced to death''.

=== Treblinka extermination camp ===
The testimony database includes more than 30 depositions that describe the functioning of this extermination camp. The accounts of former inmates have been supplemented with those of railway employees – witnesses to the transports arriving in [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]]. A selection has been incorporated in the batch entitled ''Treblinka – a complex for the extermination of the Polish Jews.''

=== Crimes committed in the “police district” ===
“Chronicles of Terror” contains a few dozen depositions concerning the crimes perpetrated in the “Police District” during the [[Warsaw Uprising]]. Among others, they portray the mass executions held in the Open-air Kindergarten at Bagatela Street, in the ruins of the pavilion of the General Inspectorate of the Armed Forces and in Anc’s Pharmacy, and also the events that took place in the Gestapo building at Szucha Avenue. Witnesses include the women who were used by the Germans to act as human shields for their tanks. Selected depositions have been brought together in the collection entitled ''Crimes in the “police district” – tragedy of insurgent Warsaw.''

=== The Gulag Archipelago  ===
This contains the depositions of people who had been arrested and sentenced to terms of imprisonment in corrective forced labor camps ([[Gulag|Soviet forced labor camps]]). They provide graphic descriptions of the brutal interrogation methods used by the [[NKVD]], the conditions existing in Soviet prisons and camps, and the back-breaking labor which the detainees were forced to perform. Many of the witnesses have also described how they were freed on the basis of the so-called “[[Amnesty for Polish citizens in the Soviet Union|amnesty]]”, and somehow managed to reach Gen. [[Anders' Army|Anders’ Army]].

=== Deported  ===
A separate section contains the testimonies of people who [[Soviet repressions of Polish citizens (1939–1946)|were deported to the USSR in the years 1940-1941]] on the basis of administrative decisions issued by the NKVD. These were primarily “enemies of the people” (as they were termed by the Soviet authorities), that is military settlers, foresters, civil servants, and members of their families. The deportees have described the conditions they were forced to endure during transport and at their points of destination. Numerous depositions depict the mind-numbing poverty that they faced while in exile. Some contain information about relations between the expellees themselves, and also their contacts with the local populace.

=== The epilogue to September 1939 – Polish soldiers in Soviet captivity  ===
This batch of depositions was written down by Polish soldiers who following the [[Invasion of Poland|September Campaign]] of 1939 were detained by the Soviets as prisoners of war and ended up in [[NKVD]] POW camps or forced labor camps for POWs. Their accounts provide a description of life in the camps, of interrogation techniques, and the methods used by the NKVD to turn prisoners into informers, and also present the tools of Communist propaganda applied against Polish POWs. Following the so-called “[[Amnesty for Polish citizens in the Soviet Union|amnesty]]”, the majority of these witnesses enlisted in Gen. [[Anders' Army|Anders’ Army]].

In [[computing]], the two primary [[stylesheet language]]s are [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) and the [[Extensible Stylesheet Language]] (XSL). While they are both called stylesheet languages, they have very different purposes and ways of going about their tasks.

== Cascading Style Sheets ==
{{main|Cascading Style Sheets}}

CSS is designed around styling a document, structured in a [[markup language]], [[HTML]] and [[XML]] (including [[XHTML]] and [[SVG]]) documents. It was created for that purpose. The code CSS is non-XML syntax to define the style information for the various elements of the document that it styles.

The language to structure a document ([[markup language]]) is a prelimit to CSS.  A markup language, like HTML and less XUL, may define some primitive elements to style a document, for example &lt;emphasis&gt; to bold.  CSS post styles a document to "screen media" or "paged media".

Screen media, displayed as a single page (possibly with hyperlinks), that has a fixed horizontal width but a virtually unlimited vertical height. Scrolling is often the method of choice for viewing parts of screen media. This is in contrast to "paged media", which has multiple pages, each with specific fixed horizontal and vertical dimensions.  To style paged media involves a variety of complexities that screen media does not. Since CSS was designed originally for screen media, its paged facilities lacked.

CSS version 3.0 provides new features that allow CSS to more adequately style documents for paged display.

== Extensible Stylesheet Language ==
{{main|Extensible Stylesheet Language}}

XSL has evolved drastically from its initial design into something very different from its original purpose. The original idea for XSL was to create an XML-based styling language directed toward paged display media. The mechanism they used to accomplish this task was to divide the process into two distinct steps.

First, the XML document would be transformed into an intermediate form. The process for performing this transformation would be governed by the XSL stylesheet, as defined by the XSL specification. The result of this transformation would be an XML document in an intermediate language, known as [[XSL Formatting Objects|XSL-FO]] (also defined by the XSL specification).

However, in the process of designing the transformation step, it was realized that a generic XML transformation language would be useful for more than merely creating a presentation of an XML document. As such, a new working group was split off from the XSL working group, and the [[XSL Transformations]] (XSLT) language became something that was considered separate from the styling information of the XSL-FO document. Even that split was expanded when [[XPath]] became its own separate specification, though still strongly tied to XSLT.

The combination of XSLT and XSL-FO creates a powerful styling language, though much more complex than CSS. XSLT is a [[Turing complete]] language, while CSS is not; this demonstrates a degree of power and flexibility not found in CSS. Additionally, XSLT is capable of creating content, such as automatically creating a table of contents just from chapters in a book, or removing/selecting content, such as ''only'' generating a glossary from a book. XSLT version 1.0 with the [[EXSLT]] extensions, or XSLT version 2.0 is capable of generating multiple documents as well, such as dividing the chapters in a book into their own individual pages. By contrast, a CSS can only selectively remove content by not displaying it.

XSL-FO is unlike CSS in that the XSL-FO document stands alone. CSS modifies a document that is attached to it, while the XSL-FO document (usually the result of the transformation by XSLT of the original document) contains all of the content to be presented in a purely presentational format. It has a wide range of specification options with regard to paged formatting and higher-quality typesetting. But it does not specify the pages themselves. The XSL-FO document must be passed through an XSL-FO processor utility that generates the final paged media, much like HTML+CSS must pass through a [[web browser]] to be displayed in its formatted state.

The complexity of XSL-FO is a problem, largely because implementing an FO processor is very difficult. CSS implementations in web browsers are still not entirely compatible with one another, and it is much simpler to write a CSS processor than an FO processor. However, for richly specified paged media, such complexity is ultimately required in order to be able to solve various [[typesetting]] problems.

Generations]] brand and a cooking tutorial software series started from a Japan-only title, ''[[Shaberu! DS Oryōri Navi]]''. In North America, it is also part of the ''Personal Trainer'' series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gonintendo.com/?p=64007 Nintendo Launches Personal Trainer: Cooking For Nintendo DS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Cooking Guide'' is an "interactive cooking aid" that gives step by step instructions on how to cook from a range of 245 dishes.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;[http://gonintendo.com/?p=44570 Cooking Guide: Can’t Decide What to Eat? - fact sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; The user is guided through the preparation and cooking process via audio narration and instructional video clips, and the user can use the Nintendo DS's voice recognition to proceed through each cooking step. Users can also choose recipes based on how many [[calorie]]s they have, or what ingredients the user currently has at hand, among other options. ''Cooking Guide'' also keeps in memory what dishes the player has already made. The application also allows users to take notes and compile a shopping list, and features functions such as a cooking timer and a quantity calculator.&lt;ref name=facts/&gt; As a bonus, the [[Game &amp; Watch]] game ''Chef'' can also be played after the user unlocks it by using the timer during preparation of a recipe like in one of its predecessors ''Shaberu! DS Oryōri Navi''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120729140244/http://gamespot.com/ds/puzzle/cookingguide/hints.html?mode=unlockables Cooking Guide: Can't Decide What To Eat? for DS Cheats]&lt;/ref&gt; They guide the users in either English, French, Italian, German or Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.side.com/work/localisation/?artid=17&amp;pageNum=0&amp;blk=39 |title=Side news and work Side UK |publisher=Side.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Released in [[Japan]] in 2006, ''Cooking Guide'' was originally shown to the [[United States|US]] during Nintendo's Media Briefing at the Hollywood Kodak Theater at [[E3 2008]].&lt;ref name = "E3 2008: Cooking Navi Comes to the States"&gt;{{cite web|last=M.

The game was generally well-received, receiving an 81% from [[Metacritic]]. ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' felt ''Cooking Guide'''s features makes it "actually better than your average recipe book" and praised both the ease of use of the software and the range of recipes it offers, but felt that the European retail price it was being sold at was too steep. They gave it 80%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/article.php?id=4832 ONM: Cooking Guide: Can't Decide What To Eat? review]&lt;/ref&gt; Pocketgamer felt that while practiced cooks will have little use for it, on the whole it was more useful than other Touch!

''Cooking Guide'' received an Excellence Prize for Entertainment at the 2006 [[Japan Media Arts Festival]]. Supermarket chain [[Asda]] has claimed that ''Cooking Guide'' has sold over 10,000 copies in the first hour of release alone, and has also positively affected the sales of products used in the application's recipes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=191401 Mums go DS mental at Asda]&lt;/ref&gt; The North American version was the 13th best-selling game and third best-selling Nintendo DS game of December 2008 in the United States.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 10 Games of December 2008, By Platform |url=http://blog.wired.com/games/2009/01/top-10-games-of.html |publisher=blog.wired.com |accessdate=2009-01-19 |date=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels and Spinoffs==
''Cooking Guide'' was the first of five sequels to the Japan-only ''[[Shaberu! DS Oryōri Navi]]'', with development split between Nintendo and [[Koei]]. Nintendo itself issued a Japan only sequel {{nihongo|[https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/aoij/index.html ''Kenkou Ouen Recipe 1000: DS Kondate Zenshuu'']|[[:ja:健康応援レシピ1000 DS献立全集|健康応援レシピ1000 DS献立全集]]|lit. "Health Boost Recipe 1000: DS Complete Menu"}} and the North America-only 2010 release ''America's Test Kitchen: Let's Get Cooking'', based on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] program, [[America's Test Kitchen]] after ''[[Cook's Illustrated]]'' magazine helped the publisher to write the game.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/fIeyCqi4iFZwJXW395q2KhDE0wyfId_q America's Test Kitchen: Let's Get Cooking] Nintendo of America, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Koei]]'s releases are both Japan only, with the company releasing {{nihongo|[http://www.gamecity.ne.jp/ds/cook/ ''Shaberu! DS Oryōri Navi: Marugoto Teikoku Hotel'']|しゃべる!DSお料理ナビ まるごと帝国ホテル|It Talks!

==Legacy==
A musical remix based on this Nintendo DS title was used in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'', where it was heard in the Kirby Final Smash update. This was only heard on the Japanese version of the official website;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smashbros.com/jp/characters/kirby.html |title=カービィ：最後の切りふだ |accessdate=2007-12-07 |last=Sakurai |first=Masahiro |date=2007-10-09 |work=スマブラ拳!! }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the song was added to all versions of ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' as one of the songs for the [[PictoChat]] stage.

'''''Dicționarul Limbii Române''''' (''"The Romanian Language Dictionary"''), abbreviated '''DLR''', also called '''Thesaurus Dictionary of the Romanian Language''', is the most important [[Lexicography|lexicographical]] work of the [[Romanian language]], developed under the aegis of the [[Romanian Academy]] during more than a century. It was compiled and edited in two stages (known under the brand DA series during 1906–1944 and new series, DLR, from 1965 to 2010), in 37 volumes and contains about 175,000 words and variations, with more than 1,300. 000 quotes. The development of electronic version was made in 2007–2010.

This dictionary by size and perspective lexicographical approach is similar to the major dictionaries of world lexicography: [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED), [[Trésor de la langue française]], [[Deutsches Wörterbuch]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}}[http://profs.info.uaic.ro/~corinfor/DLR-achizitionarea.pdf Gabriela Haja, Elena Dănilă, Corina Forăscu, Bogdan-Mihai Aldea, Dicționarul limbii române (DLR) în format electronic.

The '''''Emergency Response Guidebook:''''' ''A Guidebook for First Responders During the Initial Phase of a Dangerous Goods/Hazardous Materials Transportation Incident'' (ERG) is used by emergency response personnel (such as [[firefighter]]s,Paramedics and [[police officer]]s) in Canada, [[Mexico]], and the United States when responding to a transportation emergency involving [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]]. First responders in [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], and [[Colombia]] have recently begun using the ERG as well. It is produced by the [[United States Department of Transportation]], [[Transport Canada]], and the [[Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (Mexico)]].  The principal authors of the ERG are Transport Canada's Michel Cloutier and U.S. DOT's George Cushmac. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/DownloadableFiles/Files/Hazmat/ERG2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guidebook Contents ==
The ERG is primarily applicable for hazardous materials transported by highway and railway, but also is applicable for materials transported by air or [[waterway]], as well as by [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]. It was first issued by the US [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] in 1973, but later became a joint publication of the Department of Transportation (US DOT), Transport Canada (TC), and the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) of Mexico, with collaboration with the Chemistry Information Center for Emergencies (CIQUIME) of Argentina. The ERG is issued every 4 years, with editions now being published in Spanish ('''''Guía de Respuesta en Caso de Emergencia'''''). In 1996 it was published as the '''''North American Emergency Response Guidebook''''', but by the next publication in 2000 "North American" was removed due to its use by several [[South America]]n countries).
The ERG "is primarily a guide to aid first responders in quickly identifying the specific or generic hazards of the material(s) involved in the incident, and protecting themselves and the general public during the initial response phase of
the incident"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/DownloadableFiles/Files/Hazmat/ERG2012.pdf 2012 Emergency Response Guide, page 356&lt;/ref&gt; and should only be used for the "initial response phase" ("that period 
following arrival at the scene of an incident during which the presence and/or identification 
of dangerous goods is confirmed, protective actions and area securement are initiated, and 
assistance of qualified personnel is requested.") of an incident . It is divided into six color-coded sections (white [uncolored], yellow, blue, orange, green, and a second white [uncolored]). The ERG includes 62 "Guides" (found in the [[#Orange Section|Orange Section]]) that identify the primary hazards associated with the applicable general category of hazardous material and general guidance on how to respond to incidents involving that general category of hazardous material. The primary purpose of ERG is to direct the emergency responders to the most appropriate of these guides, based on the incident. The ERG also provides guidance regarding recommended evacuation distances, if applicable, in the [[#Green Section|Green Section]].

== White Section (front) ==
The first section, with white page (uncolored) borders, provides the following:
*Information regarding [[Shipping list|shipping documents]]
*Instructions on how to use the guidebook
*General guidance for responding to any hazardous material incident
*Basic information on the [[Dangerous goods#Classification and labeling summary tables|hazard classification system]] and the associated [[placard]]s/labels
*Recommendations the proper guides based transporting vehicle types and/or [[placard]]s (when the material in question cannot be further identified otherwise)
*General safety precautions
*Specific guidance for incidents involving [[pipeline transport|pipelines]]

== Yellow Section ==
The second section, with yellow page borders, references the material in order of its assigned 4-digit ID number/[[UN/NA number]] (which is often placarded with the other hazardous materials placards) and identifies the appropriate guide number to reference in the [[#Orange Section|Orange Section]]). Items highlighted in green in this section will have evacuation distances included in the [[#Green Section|Green Section]].

== Blue Section ==
The third section, with blue page borders, references the material in alphabetical order of its name and identifies the appropriate guide number to reference in the [[#Orange Section|Orange Section]]). Items highlighted in green in this section will also have evacuation distances included in the [[#Green Section|Green Section]].

== Orange Section ==
The fourth section, with orange page borders, includes the actual response guides. Each of the 62 guides provides safety recommendations and directions on how to proceed during the initial response phase (first thirty minutes) of the incident. It includes "health" and "fire or explosion" potential hazard information (with the more dangerous hazard listed first). For example, "the material gives off irritating vapors, easily ignited by heat, reactive with water"; "highly toxic, may be fatal if inhaled, swallowed or absorbed through skin"; etc. 
 
Next this section includes information for responders on appropriate protective clothing and possible evacuation information for either spill or fire is given. It also includes information on fighting fires (example, do not apply water to [[sodium]]), warnings for spills or leaks, and special directions for first aid (example, not to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if the materials are toxic).

In the event of an unknown material, Guide #111 should be followed until more information becomes available.

== Green Section ==
The fifth section, with green page borders, suggests initial evacuation or [[shelter in place]] distances (protective action distances) for spills of materials that are Toxic-by-Inhalation (TIH). These distances vary based on the size of the spill (small or large) and whether the incident occurs during the day or at night. Only materials that were highlighted in green in the [[#Yellow Section|Yellow]] and [[#Blue Section|Blue Sections]] are included in the Green Section.
This section also includes information regarding toxic gases that are produced when certain materials are spilled in water (as identified previously in this section). Finally, this section includes some very specific evacuation details for six common materials.

== White Section (back) ==
The sixth section, with white page (uncolored) borders, provides the following:
*Additional instructions on how to use the guidebook
*Information regarding protective clothing and equipment
*Instructions on fire and spill control
*[[BLEVE]] (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion) safety precautions
*Beginning with the 2004 edition, information specifically for hazardous materials being used for [[terrorism]]
*[[Glossary]] of terms used in the ERG
*Contact information for the various countries

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1698">The '''Federal Digital System''' ('''FDsys''') replaces GPOAccess,&lt;ref name="GPO"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/ US Government Printing Office: FDsys]&lt;/ref&gt; an [[information storage]] system to house electronic government documents with a modern information management system.  FDsys authenticates, preserves and provides permanent public access to federal government documents.  The system automates the collection, management and dissemination of electronic information from all three branches of the federal government.  The goal is to have a complete historical record of all federal government documents from the founding of our nation to the present.&lt;ref name="GPO"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  FDsys was named by ''Government Computer News'' as one of the best government Web sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gcn.com/articles/2009/07/27/gcn-great-gov-web-sites-2009.aspx?sc_lang=en GCN: Great dot-gov Web Sites 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the first few months of the launch of FDsys, the public could find The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] (the Stimulus Package) and [[2010 United States federal budget|President Obama’s first budget]].  The [[Office of the Federal Register]]’s (OFR) publication, ''Daily Compilation of Presidential Documents'', was specifically engineered for FDsys. This publication contains information released by The [[White House Press Office]] regarding orders, statements and remarks made by the President.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8679">The '''Future Library project''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Framtidsbiblioteket'') is a public artwork that aims to collect an original work by a popular writer every year from 2014 to 2114 and to share them with the world only then. One thousand trees were specially planted for the project in the [[Nordmarka]] forest at its inception&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/10/future-library_n_7532012.html|title='Future Library' Reminds Us How Connected Books And The Environment Really Are|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the 100 books will be printed in limited-edition anthologies using paper made from the trees. ''[[The Guardian]]'' has referred to it as "the world's most secretive library".&lt;ref name="kang"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/31/han-kang-bury-book-100-years-norwegian-forest-future-library|title=Han Kang to bury next book for almost 100 years in Norwegian forest|first=Alison|last=Flood|publisher=The Guardian|date=2018-08-31|accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The project was conceived by [[Katie Paterson]] during the summer of 2014. It is managed by the Future Library Trust and supported by the [[Oslo|City of Oslo]], [[Norway]]. It was produced for the Slow Space public art program and commissioned by [[Bjørvika]], Oslo's former container port, and its development corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futurelibrary.no/|title=Future Library – Framtidsbiblioteket - Katie Paterson|page=About|accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscripts will be held in a specially designed room at the new [[Oslo Public Library|Deichman Library]] (Oslo Public Library) currently under construction in Bjørvika, Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Reader offer: buy a Katie Paterson Future Library limited-edition print|url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/23/reader-offer-katie-paterson-print-future-library|newspaper = the Guardian|date=November 23, 2014 |first = Vanessa|last = Thorpe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = In English|url = http://blogg.deichman.no/nyedeichman/in-english/|accessdate = 2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katie Paterson has been working with the architectural team to design this part of the new public library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nothingintherulebook.com/2018/05/23/creatives-in-profile-interview-with-katie-paterson/|title=Creatives in profile – interview with Katie Paterson|date=2018-05-23|work=nothingintherulebook|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collected works will be on display but the manuscripts will not be available for reading.

The Future Library Trust's committee of trustees will make a new selection annually based on the criteria "outstanding contributions to literature or poetry, and for their work's ability to capture the imagination of this and future generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A library that won't be read for 100 years|url = http://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/05/29/books-thread-future-library|website = www.mprnews.org|accessdate = 2015-08-09|first = Tracy|last = Mumford}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Umberto Eco]] and [[Tomas Tranströmer]], both deceased as of 2016, were previously considered as potential contributors. All other authors approached by Paterson have accepted the invitation.&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/the-future-library-why-you-face-a-big-wait-to-read-any-of-the-books-20170113-gtqw6i.html|title=The Future Library: Why you face a big wait to read any of the books|first=Gaby|last=Wood|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2017-01-13|accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One thousand certificates entitling the holder to the full anthology in 2114 are being sold by the artist's galleries:  Ingleby Gallery (Edinburgh), James Cohan Gallery (New York) and Parafin (London). Initially sold for £625, the price increased to £800 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/23/reader-offer-katie-paterson-print-future-library|title=Reader offer: buy a Katie Paterson Future Library limited-edition print|last=Thorpe|first=Vanessa|date=2014-11-23|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Future Library {{!}} Edition {{!}} Ingleby Gallery|url = http://www.inglebygallery.com/edition/future-library/|website = www.inglebygallery.com|accessdate = 2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The Future Library project has attracted criticism for its emphasis on preventing readership between 2014 and 2114.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maggietiede.com/2018/09/05/margaret-atwood-han-kang-and-more-will-bury-their-new-novels-for-100-years-what-do-you-think-about-the-future-library-project/|first=Maggie|last=Tiede|title=Margaret Atwood, Han Kang, and more will bury their new novels for 100 years. What do you think about the Future Library Project?|date=2018-09-05|accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few details known about the books was revealed accidentally when [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell]] stated that his book quotes the lyrics of ''[[Here Comes The Sun]]'', a song expected to enter the [[public domain]] in the late 21st century.&lt;ref name="smh" /&gt; Writing for ''[[Flavorwire]]'', Moze Halperin called the project "art whose intention is to exclude a few generations" and criticized the class exclusivity planned for the works even after they are released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flavorwire.com/574802/john-malkovichs-100-years-raises-important-questions-even-if-well-never-see-it|first=Moze|last=Halperin|title=John Malkovich’s Silly Cognac-Based ‘100 Years’ Project Raises Important Questions, Even If We’ll Never See It|publisher=Flavorwire|date=2016-05-06|accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Guest House Paradiso''''' is a 1999 British slapstick black comedy film written by and starring comic duo [[Rik Mayall]] and [[Ade Edmondson|Adrian Edmondson]], and directed by Edmondson—his [[directorial debut]] for a feature film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Guest House Paradiso|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/184630/Guest-House-Paradiso/overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is semi-officially based on their comedy television series ''[[Bottom (TV series)|Bottom]]'' (in some territories, the DVD cover refers to it as ''The Bottom Movie''). The key difference in the characters is in their surnames: Mayall's character, known as "[[Richard Richard]]" in the TV show, is here referred to as "Richard Twat" (although he angrily insists on the pronunciation "Thwaite"). Edmondson's character changes from "Edward Elizabeth Hitler" in the TV/live show to "Edward Elizabeth Ndingombaba". Despite this difference, both characters retain the same personalities as their TV counterparts. The film was made at [[Ealing Studios]] and on location on the [[Isle of Wight]].

==Plot==
Richard "Richie" Richard ([[Rik Mayall]]) and Edward "Eddie" Elizabeth Ndingombaba ([[Ade Edmondson|Adrian Edmondson]]) run the worst guest house in the [[United Kingdom]]. Their staff include a [[chef]], an idiotic drunkard and an illegal immigrant who is unable to cook, and a waiter, whom Richie believes has checked into a psychiatric hospital. Both leave because of nonpayment for their employment, with the latter quitting because of the verbal abuse from his boss. The guests, including Mr Johnson ([[Bill Nighy]]), who reside in the pair's hotel are thoroughly dissatisfied by the poor service, and eventually decide to leave, except for Mrs Foxfur ([[Fenella Fielding]]) who lives there.

Life seems bleak for Eddie and Richie, until it seemingly improves with the arrival of the "Nice family", headed by Mr Nice ([[Simon Pegg]]), and the famous [[Italy|Italian]] actress Gina Carbonara (Hélène Mahieu).  Gina's decision to stay in the grotty house is primarily down to her need to seek safety from her ill-tempered fiancé Gino Bolognese ([[Vincent Cassel]]). However, thanks to the pair putting her names in lights outside the guest house to attract more guests, Gino eventually finds her. Forced to cook meals for the guest, Richie comes across some [[fish]] which fell off a military lorry, heading away from the nearby [[nuclear power]] station. Unknown to both him and Eddie, the fish had been contaminated by a radiation leak due to the power station's poor maintenance.

Hours after serving the radioactive fish, everybody becomes violently ill, projectile-[[vomiting]] at high velocity and in huge quantities - all except for Gina Carbonara, the only guest who did not eat the fish. In an act of spontaneous solidarity, every guest projectile-vomits on Gino at once, forcing him backwards out through a window, and off a cliff edge into the ocean. Government agents arrive to hush up the incident and give Eddie and Richie £10 million pounds, first-class tickets to the [[Caribbean]], and new identities for both them and Gina, in exchange for their silence over the leak. The three accept the offer and head to the Caribbean. In the film's final scene, Eddie [[Fourth wall|winks to the camera]] after commenting "How lucky [Gino] was the only fatality. Otherwise there'd be a moral question-mark hanging over our escape."

''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' gave the film two stars out of five stating "The boys toil incredibly hard to make the whole thing work and, while there are some hilarious moments, it is far too patchy for a full feature film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guest House Paradiso|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/review.asp?FID=5291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HalliburtonHouse 2018.jpg|thumb|Haliburton House Museum]]
The '''Haliburton House Museum''' is part of the [[Nova Scotia Museum]] system and is located in [[Windsor, Nova Scotia]].  It was originally built in the 1830s for [[Thomas Chandler Haliburton]], a Windsor native who was one of Canada's first famous authors).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/hh/# |title=museum.gov.ns.ca/hh/ |access-date=2010-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620131400/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/hh/# |archive-date=2010-06-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His "[[Sam Slick]]" stories won him acclaim around the English-speaking world of the 1840s, and though Haliburton's famous character was fictitious, the home has also been referred to as the "Sam Slick House" informally for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/imagesns/html/20852.html# |title=museum.gov.ns.ca/imagesns/html/20852.html |access-date=2010-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610144447/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/imagesns/html/20852.html# |archive-date=2011-06-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The house was added to during Haliburton's time, but successive owners also made major changes to the house until the 1920s.  In 1939, the province acquired the home and in 1940 opened the site as the Haliburton Memorial Museum.     

Though Haliburton auctioned off the property and the contents of the home when he left for England in 1856, the museum does have some furniture and artifacts that belonged to him, including his writing desk.  Most of these items were procured by donation to the Nova Scotia Museum to coincide with the 1940 opening.  The rest of the museum is furnished in period pieces from the museum's collection.

The Museum is open to the public from June 1 - October 15 every year.

The '''''Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan''''' is a comprehensive [[English language|English-language]] [[encyclopedia]] first published in 1983 that covers a broad range of topics on [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=McDowell |first=Edwin |date=October 11, 1983 |title=Major Encyclopedia on Japan Written in English |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/11/arts/major-encyclopedia-on-japan-written-in-english.html?pagewanted=all |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
First published by [[Kodansha]] in 1983 followed by a supplemental volume in 1986. A two-volume updated edition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1993|encyclopedia=Japan: An Illustrated Encyclopedia|publisher=Kodansha|location=Tokyo|isbn=4069310983|oclc=489640156}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a one-volume abridged (and updated) edition were published in 1993.  The latter was the basis of the online version, which as of June 2010, is no longer available as a free-standing site.  It can still be accessed through the JapanKnowledge database.

== Content ==
The encyclopedia was created by both Japanese (680) and non-Japanese scholars (524) from 27 nations. Some of the advisors to the ''Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan'' included [[Edwin O. Reischauer]], [[Gerald Curtis|Gerald L. Curtis]], [[Ronald P. Dore]], [[John Whitney Hall|John W. Hall]], [[Ezra Vogel]], [[Akira Iriye]], and [[Tsuru Shigeto]]. Japanese scholars produced 40 percent of the text, while foreign scholars wrote the remaining 60 percent. Japanese and American scholars wrote the majority of the articles. Many articles are English translations from Japanese encyclopedias.

There are more than 11,000 entries covering 37 categories of information. These include encyclopedia standards such as history, literature, art, religion, economy, and geography. In addition, science, technology, law, women, folklore, plant and animal life, food, clothing, sports, and leisure are given separate categories. It also contains roughly 1000 illustrations in the form of photographs, maps, diagrams, graphs, charts and tables. The ninth index volume contains names and words mentioned within the encyclopedia, but not assigned separate entries.

In order to accommodate a wide audience, from students to businessmen and diplomats, articles were written with the dual purpose of introducing topics at a level appropriate for a high-school student and provide a good starting point for more advanced students with some knowledge of Japan.

Numerous articles are no more than a paragraph. However, more general headings such as "[[History of Japan]]" have as many as 70,000 words. Many are signed, especially the longer ones. A lot of articles are followed by suggestions for further readings in English, Japanese, and occasionally other languages. Japanese names are given in Japanese order (family names first).

'''[[Divers Alert Network]]''' (DAN) is a group of not-for-profit organisations dedicated to improving diving safety for all divers. It was founded in [[Durham, North Carolina]], USA in 1980 at [[Duke University]] to provide 24/7 telephonic hotline diving medical assistance. Since then the organisation has expanded globally and now has independent regional organisations in [[Divers Alert Network#DAN America|North America]], [[Divers Alert Network#DAN Europe|Europe]], [[Divers Alert Network#DAN Japan|Japan]], [[Divers Alert Network#DAN Asia-Pacific|Asia-Pacific]] and [[Divers Alert Network#DAN Southern Africa|Southern Africa]].&lt;ref name="Edmonds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.divingmedicine.info/Ch%20D%20SM10c.pdf|title=Divers Alert Network|last1=Edmonds |first1=Carl |last2=Thomas |first2=Bob |last3=McKenzie |first3=Bart |last4=Pennefather |first4=John |year=2015 |website=Diving Medicine for Scuba Divers|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsletter1q06"&gt;{{cite book|last=Staff|first=|title=DAN Southern Africa newsletter|edition=1st quarter|year=2006|publisher=DAN Southern Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DAN publishes research results on a wide range of matters relating to diving safety and medicine and diving accident analysis, including annual reports on decompression illness and diving fatalities. Most are freely available on the internet, many of these at the [[Rubicon Research Repository]].

This list includes publications where one or more authors are staff or members of one of the DAN affiliates, where a large part of the data is from one of the DAN Databases, or where the research was funded by DAN.

The '''MA'''trixware '''RE'''search '''C'''ollection ('''MAREC''') is a standardised patent data corpus available for research purposes. MAREC seeks to represent patent documents of several languages in order to answer specific research questions.&lt;ref&gt;Merz C., (2003) A Corpus Query Tool For Syntactically Annotated Corpora Licentiate Thesis, The University of Zurich, Department of Computation linguistic, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biber D., Conrad S., and Reppen R. (2000) Corpus Linguistics: Investigating Language Structure and Use. Cambridge University Press, 2nd edition&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of 19 million patent documents in different languages, normalised to a highly specific [[XML]] schema.

MAREC is intended as raw material for research in areas such as [[information retrieval]], [[natural language processing]] or [[machine translation]], which require large amounts of complex documents.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, C. D. and Schütze, H. (2002) Foundations of statistical natural language processing Cambridge, MA, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)  {{ISBN|0-262-13360-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection contains documents in 19 languages, the majority being English, German and French, and about half of the documents include full text.

In MAREC, the documents from different countries and sources are normalised to a common XML format with a uniform patent numbering scheme and citation format. The standardised fields include dates, countries, languages, references, person names, and companies as well as subject classifications such as [[International Patent Classification|IPC]] codes.&lt;ref&gt;European Patent Office (2009) [http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/eponet.nsf/0/1AFC30805E91D074C125758A0051718A/$File/guidelines_2009_complete_en.pdf Guidelines for examination in the European Patent Office], Published by European Patent Office, Germany (April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

MAREC is a comparable corpus, where many documents are available in similar versions in other languages. A comparable corpus can be defined as consisting of texts that share similar topics – news text from the same time period in different countries, while a parallel corpus is defined as a collection of documents with aligned translations from the source to the target language.&lt;ref&gt;Järvelin A. , Talvensaari T. , Järvelin Anni, (2008) Data driven methods for improving mono- and cross-lingual IR performance in noisy environments, Proceedings of the second workshop on Analytics for noisy unstructured text data, (Singapore)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the patent document refers to the same “invention” or “concept of idea” the text is a translation of the invention, but it does not have to be a direct translation of the text itself – text parts could have been removed or added for clarification reasons.

The 19,386,697 XML files measure a total of 621 GB and are hosted by the [[Information Retrieval Facility]]. Access and support are free of charge for research purposes.

== Use Cases ==
* MAREC is used in the [[Patent Language Translations Online (PLuTO)]] project.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2152">The '''Norfolk Record Society''' ('''NRS''' for short) is a [[text publication society]] in the county of [[Norfolk]], [[England]]. The Society was founded to encourage the study and preservation of historical records relating to Norfolk, and to publish editions of these documents.

The society has offices in [[Norwich]] and is [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|registered as a charity]]. Its membership is drawn mainly from [[East Anglia]]; however, individuals and institutions from around the world are also members. 

== History ==
The Society was founded in 1930.&lt;ref name="formed1930"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.norfolkrecordsociety.org.uk/about.html|title=About the Society|work=NRS|accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has published annually a transcript of a significant and sometimes unusual manuscript or collection of manuscripts. The series now covers a time-span ranging from the 12th to 20th centuries. All publications are carefully edited, indexed and include introductions explaining the background of the documents they present.

The Society continues to publish on a wide range of subjects and encourages new researchers and members to submit ideas for future publications.

== Activities ==
The Society holds an annual lecture in conjunction with its annual publication launch.

== Norfolk Record Society Resources ==
The NRS maintains an extensive collection of historical resources, which are on deposit at the Norfolk Record Office at the Archive Centre in Norwich. Some information is provided on their website.

'''OpenSTA''' is a [[feature-rich]] GUI-based [[web server benchmarking]] utility that can perform scripted HTTP and HTTPS heavy load tests with performance measurements.&lt;ref name="tejasreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tejasconsulting.com/open-testware/feature/opensta.html|title=Open Testware Reviews: OpenSTA (Open System Testing Architecture)|year=2003|publisher=Tejas Software Consulting|accessdate=2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is freely available and distributable under the [[Open-source license|open source]] [[GNU General Public License]].  OpenSTA currently only runs on [[Microsoft Windows]]-based operating systems.

Scripts are recorded in a [[proprietary programming language|proprietary language]] called "SCL".  It is a fairly simple coding language that provides support for custom functions, variable scopes, and random or sequential lists.

OpenSTA was originally written by Cyrano. Cyrano's intentions were to write commercial plug in modules and support for OpenSTA for performance testing non-web applications.

Note that the most recent version posted on the [http://opensta.org/ OpenSTA home page] is 1.4.4, released 27 Oct, 2007.

'''Outlook Mobile''' (formerly '''Acompli''') is a [[mobile app|mobile]] [[personal information manager]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] devices.

The app provides unified communication functionality, as opposed to splitting [[email]], [[Calendaring software|calendar]], and contact management functionality into multiple, focused apps the way [[Windows 10 Mobile]]'s apps. Similar to its [[Microsoft Outlook|desktop counterpart]], Outlook Mobile offers an aggregation of attachments and files stored on [[cloud storage]] platforms; a "focused inbox" highlights messages from frequent contacts, and calendar events, files, and locations can be embedded in messages without switching apps. The app supports a number of email platforms and services, including [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] and [[Google Apps]] among others.

First released in April 2014 by the [[venture capital]]-backed [[startup company|startup]] of the same name, Acompli was acquired by [[Microsoft]] in December 2014. On January 29, 2015, Acompli was re-branded as Outlook Mobile—sharing its name with the [[Microsoft Outlook]] desktop [[personal information manager]] and [[Outlook.com]] email service.&lt;ref name=verge-outlookmobile&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft rebrands Acompli as Outlook for iOS and Android|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/29/7936081/microsoft-outlook-app-ios-android-features|website=The Verge|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Acompli was co-founded as a [[startup company|startup]] by [[Javier Soltero]], the former [[chief technology officer]] of [[VMWare]], alongside [[JJ Zhuang]] ([[Chief technology officer|CTO]]), and [[Kevin Henrikson]] (VP of Engineering). It received $7.3 million in funding from Redpoint Ventures, Harrison Metal and Felicis Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/04/25/acompli-is-already-in-the-top-10-after-its-apple-app-store-premiere-today/|title=Acompli is already in the Top 10 after its Apple App Store premiere today|last=Novet|first=Jordan|date=April 25, 2014|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/24/acompli-the-email-productivity-app-backed-by-7-3m-goes-live-on-app-store/|title=Acompli, The Email Productivity App Backed By $7.3M, Goes Live On App Store|last=Perez|first=Sarah|date=April 24, 2014|work=[[TechCrunch]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to distinguish itself from other recent email startups, such as [[Mailbox (application)|Mailbox]], Soltero decided to target the enterprise market—particularly, users of [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] servers. He felt that such users had been underserved by the lacking or non-existent support for Exchange in existing mail apps, believing that their developers—despite its wide adoption, "do not fathom the possibility of anyone using Exchange." A result of this mandate was the decision to make the app a [[personal information manager]] rather than only an email client, integrating a calendar, a list of recent contacts, and a list of recent files from attachments and [[cloud storage]] services.&lt;ref name="verge-history"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/24/5645684/accompli-is-a-powerhouse-email-app-for-iphone-for-outlook-users|title=The history of Microsoft's new Outlook for iPhone app|last=Newton|first=Casey|date=April 24, 2014|work=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-history"/&gt;

Acompli was first released on April 25, 2014 for [[iOS]].&lt;ref name="vb-appstore"/&gt; An [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version was released in September 2014.&lt;ref name="verge-history"/&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-acompliandroid&gt;{{cite web|title=Acompli brings its Exchange-friendly email app to Android|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/4/6099341/acompli-brings-its-exchange-friendly-email-app-to-android|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2014/02/20/acompli-from-zimbra-and-vmware-vets-tees-up-a-swing-at-mobile-email/|title=Acompli, From Zimbra and VMware Vets, Tees Up a Swing at Mobile Email |last=Gannes|first=Liz|date=February 20, 2014|work=[[Re/code]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 26, 2014, an incomplete post on its official blog prematurely revealed that Acompli had been acquired by [[Microsoft]]. The acquisition, valued at over $200 million, was officially announced on December 1, 2014. Rajesh Jha, vice president of Microsoft's Outlook division, stated that "We’re excited about what’s possible as we build on the app’s success and bring it together with work currently in progress by the Outlook team." Soltero assured users that the Acompli app would not be discontinued, and would continue to receive regular updates.&lt;ref name=verge-msacompli&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft may have accidentally announced that it's buying email app Acompli|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/26/7297909/microsoft-may-have-announced-that-its-buying-acompli|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-msannounce&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft acquires email app Acompli|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/1/7298679/microsoft-acquires-acompli|website=The Verge|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 29, 2015, Acompli was re-branded as '''Outlook Mobile''', uniting it with one of its original influences.&lt;ref name=verge-outlookmobile/&gt;

On February 4, 2015, Microsoft acquired [[Sunrise Calendar]];&lt;ref name=PCWorld&gt;{{cite web|last=Miners|first=Zach|title=Microsoft reportedly buying slick calendar app Sunrise to bolster productivity push|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2880272/microsoft-said-to-acquire-calendar-app-sunrise-for-north-of-100-million.html|newspaper=[[PC World]]|date=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on September 13, 2016, Sunrise ceased to operate, and an update was released to Outlook Mobile that contained enhancements to its calendar functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Warren|first=Tom|title=Microsoft isn't killing the Sunrise calendar app just yet|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/1/12746910/microsoft-sunrise-shut-down-delayed|website=[[The Verge]]|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-sunrisedelay"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Outlook's mobile app just added Sunrise's best features|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/13/12895358/microsoft-outlook-sunrise-app-merger|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Outlook Mobile is designed to consolidate functionality that would normally be found in separate apps on mobile devices, similarly to [[personal information manager]]s on [[personal computer]]s. is designed around four "hubs" for different tasks, including "Mail", "Calendar," "Files" and "People". The "People" hub lists frequently and recently used contacts and aggregates recent communications with them, and the "Files" hub aggregates recent attachments from messages, and can also integrate with other online storage services such as [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Google Drive]], and [[OneDrive]].&lt;ref name=verge-acompliandroid /&gt;&lt;ref name="engadget-acompli"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/04/24/acompli-email-app/|title=Acompli Launches App to Simplify Mobile Email|last=Bell|first=Karissa|work=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-acompli"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304393704579530332026112164?KEYWORDS=Joanna+Stern&amp;mg=reno64-wsj|title=You're Emailing Wrong: The Best Mobile Apps for Managing Your Inbox|last=Stern|first=Joanna|date=April 29, 2014|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To facility indexing of content for search and other features, emails and other information are stored on external servers.&lt;ref name=witpro-outlooksecurity&gt;{{cite web|last1=Redmond|first1=Tony|title=Do the ex-Acompli now Outlook clients really compromise security or is everyone overreacting?|url=http://windowsitpro.com/blog/do-ex-acompli-now-outlook-clients-really-compromise-security-or-everyone-overreacting|website=Windows IT Pro|publisher=Penton|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outlook Mobile supports a large number of different e-mail services and platforms, including [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Exchange]], [[iCloud]], [[GMail]], [[Google Apps]], [[Outlook.com]], and [[Yahoo! Mail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tech/news/a567986/best-new-mobile-apps-for-ios-android-ifttt-midrive-more.html#~oRcNVU2vVxDLXK|title=Best new mobile apps for iOS, Android: IFTTT, miDrive, more|last=Langshaw|first=Mark|date=April 30, 2014|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/28/best-iphone-ipad-apps-tynker-acompli|title=20 best iPhone and iPad apps this week|last=Dredge|first=Stuart|date=April 28, 2014|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The app supports multiple email accounts at once.&lt;ref name=zdnet-iosreview/&gt;

Emails are divided into two inboxes: the "Focused" inbox displays messages of high importance, and those from frequent contacts.

Like the desktop Outlook, Outlook Mobile allows users to see appointment details, respond to Exchange meeting invites, and schedule meetings. It also incorporates the three-day view and "Interesting Calendars" features from Sunrise.&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.office.com/2016/09/13/introducing-outlooks-new-and-improved-calendar-on-ios-and-android/&lt;/ref&gt;

Files in the Files tab are not stored offline; they require Internet access to view.

==Security==

==Reception==
Acompli received mostly positive reception: James Kendrick of ''[[ZDNet]]'' considered the app a "must-have" for [[bring your own device]] scenarios, citing its focused inbox, convergence, and support for both personal and business-oriented e-mail platforms. However, he felt that the calendar was not "fancy", and lacked different view modes.&lt;ref name=zdnet-iosreview&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kendrick|first1=James|title=Acompli for iOS review: Must-have app for BYOD|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/acompli-for-ios-review-must-have-app-for-byod/|website=ZDNet|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting its level of support for Gmail, quicker deletion gesture, along with its "clean approach" to filtering through emails and other content, ''[[Engadget]]'' argued that Acompli "can be a speedy and powerful tool if you're willing to take the time to learn its nuances."&lt;ref name="engadget-acompli"/&gt;

On the day of its release, Acompli quickly reached the top 10 free "Productivity" apps on the [[iOS App Store]].&lt;ref name="vb-appstore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/04/25/acompli-is-already-in-the-top-10-after-its-apple-app-store-premiere-today/|title=Acompli is already in the Top 10 after its Apple App Store premiere today|last=Novet|first=Jordan|date=April 25, 2014|work=[[VentureBeat]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novels==

=== Greg Mandel trilogy (1993–1995) ===

#''[[Mindstar Rising]]'' (1993), {{ISBN|0-330-32376-8}}
#''[[A Quantum Murder]]'' (1994), {{ISBN|0-330-33045-4}}
#''[[The Nano Flower]]'' (1995), {{ISBN|0-330-33044-6}}

Hamilton first came to prominence in the mid-1990s with three novels featuring the [[psychic detective]] [[Greg Mandel]]. Set in a near-future Britain which has been run into the ground by global warming and an authoritarian left-wing government, the books describe a society beginning to rebuild itself through the production of advanced technology. The books are a blend of lively scientific, political and social speculation mixed with elements of detective story.

===Confederation universe (1996–2000)===
{{Main article|The Night's Dawn Trilogy}}

# ''[[The Reality Dysfunction]]'' (1996, published in two volumes in the US: ''Emergence'' and ''Expansion''), {{ISBN|0-330-34032-8}}
# ''[[The Neutronium Alchemist]]'' (1997, published in two volumes in the US: ''Consolidation'' and ''Conflict''), {{ISBN|0-330-35143-5}}
# ''[[The Naked God]]'' (1999, published in two volumes in paperback in the US: ''Flight'' and ''Faith''; the US hardback was one volume), {{ISBN|0-330-35145-1}}
* ''[[The Confederation Handbook]]'' (2000, a guide in non-fiction style to the universe of the ''Night's Dawn'' trilogy), {{ISBN|0-330-39614-5}}

After the Greg Mandel novels, Hamilton wrote a space opera in three volumes, known collectively as ''The Night's Dawn Trilogy''. The three books are each well over a thousand pages long and are not standalone novels, totalling 1.2 million words. The trilogy is set in a universe with a wealth of worlds and artificial orbiting colonies. The plot is centered on the souls of the dead coming back from a hellish "beyond" to possess the living, and the latter fighting back. It was followed by a companion to the series, ''The Confederation Handbook'', an informational book containing data about the universe of the ''Night's Dawn'' trilogy. Hamilton re-set several earlier short stories set in the Confederation timeline, published as the collection ''[[A Second Chance at Eden]]'' (see "Short story collections" below), including the newly written title novella.

===Commonwealth universe (2002–present)===
; Commonwealth Saga

{{Main article|Misspent Youth|Commonwealth Saga}}
# ''[[Misspent Youth]]'' (2002), {{ISBN|978-0330480222}}
# ''[[Commonwealth Saga#Pandora's Star|Pandora's Star]]'' (2004), {{ISBN|978-0345461629}}
# ''[[Commonwealth Saga#Judas Unchained|Judas Unchained]]'' (2005), {{ISBN|978-0345461667}}

''Misspent Youth'' is much shorter than either the Night's Dawn novels or ''Fallen Dragon'', and again depicts a near-future version of Britain (but different from that in the Greg Mandel trilogy). It combines a [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] theme with a growing preoccupation with the phenomenon of European integration from the [[Eurosceptic]] point of view. This was his least well received book critically. The author [[Graham Joyce]] has a cameo part in the book. ''Misspent Youth'' is placed in the same universe as the ''Commonwealth Saga'', though it is not integral to the storyline of those novels. Much of the technology used in those novels (rejuvenation and low-cost/high-capacity memory storage) is established within this book.

The ''Commonwealth Saga'' is published in two halves, ''[[Commonwealth Saga#Pandora's Star|Pandora's Star]]'' and ''[[Commonwealth Saga#Judas Unchained|Judas Unchained]]''. Set approximately 300 years later in the same universe as ''Misspent Youth'', it explores the social effects of the almost complete elimination of the experience of death following widespread use of the rejuvenation technique described in ''Misspent Youth''. In somewhat similar style to ''Night's Dawn'', Hamilton also outlines, in detail, a universe with a small number of distinct alien species interacting essentially peacefully and who suddenly become faced with an increasingly ominous external threat.

; Void Trilogy 
{{Main article|Void Trilogy}}

# ''[[The Dreaming Void]]'' (2007), {{ISBN|978-1-4050-8880-0}}
# ''[[The Temporal Void]]'' (2008), {{ISBN|978-1-4050-8883-1}}
# ''[[The Evolutionary Void]]'' (2010), {{ISBN|978-0-345-49657-7}}

Set in the same universe as the ''Commonwealth Saga'', the ''Void Trilogy'' is set 1200 years after the end of ''Judas Unchained''. The release date for the first book, ''[[The Dreaming Void]]'', was 3 August 2007. A time line that links the ''Commonwealth Saga'' with the ''Void Trilogy'', filling in the 1200-year gap, has been written by Hamilton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterfhamilton.co.uk//index.php?page=timeline|title=Timeline|work=peterfhamilton.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second book in the trilogy, ''[[The Temporal Void]]'', was published in 2008.  The third book in the trilogy, ''[[The Evolutionary Void]]'', was published in August 2010.

; The Chronicle of the Fallers
{{main article|The Chronicle of the Fallers}}
# ''[[The Abyss Beyond Dreams]]'' (2014), {{ISBN|978-0-345-54719-4}}

Hamilton announced in 2011 that he is developing a new trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peterfhamilton.co.uk/index.php?page=blog-025---may-2011 |title=Blog 025 - May 2011 |work=peterfhamilton.co.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605095639/http://www.peterfhamilton.co.uk/index.php?page=blog-025---may-2011|archivedate=2014-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He later cut this down to two books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geekchocolate.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=271%3Apeter-f-hamilton-novelist-creator-of-the-commonwealth&amp;limitstart=2|title=GeekChocolate - TV - Film - Books - Comics - Theatre |work=GeekChocolate}}&lt;/ref&gt; titled The Chronicle of the Fallers. It is a return to his Commonwealth Universe, set in the same time-frame as the Void Trilogy, and tells the story of Nigel Sheldon and what happened when he broke into the Void. On 19 March, both the cover art and release date for the first book, ''The Abyss Beyond Dreams'', was unveiled. The book was published on 21 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://upcoming4.me/news/book-news/the-abyss-beyond-dreams-by-peter-f-hamilton-cover-art |title=The Abyss Beyond Dreams by Peter F Hamilton cover art |work=upcoming4.me}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release  |url=https://www.facebook.com/PeterFHamilton/posts/324913197594275|title=FYI....

# ''[[The Hunting of the Princes]]'' (2016)
# ''[[A Voyage Through Air]]'' (August 10th, 2017)
A children's fantasy series also known as ''Book of the Realms''. Taggie and Jemima are summer holidaying on their dad's farm. They know just what to expect—a tumbledown cottage, sunshine and strawberry-picking. But then Jemima sees a white squirrel wearing glasses… And things become even more extraordinary when their dad is captured and whisked away to a faerie world.

===The Salvation Sequence (2018-Onwards)===

* ''[[Salvation_(Peter_F._Hamilton)|Salvation]]'' (2018), {{ISBN|978-1447281313}}
* ''Salvation Lost'' (TBD)
* ''Saints of Salvation'' (TBD)

At the start of 2018, Hamilton and his publishers Macmillan announced a brand-new trilogy set in an entirely new universe called 'The Salvation Sequence'. The three novels titled, ''Salvation'', ''Salvation Lost'' and ''The Saint of Salvation'' Subsequent to that, on the 7th February 2018, the author published the first chapter of book one titled, 'Salvation'. The premise of book one follows two branching story lines, the opening line is set two hundred years in the future during 2204. In this period humanity have developed near-instantaneous space travel via 'trans-dimensional gates', placing them throughout the galaxy. The unintended consequence of this technology has made spaceships essentially redundant; however, when an unknown vessel is found on a recently explored world, a team of specialists are sent out to investigate both the craft and the astonishing contents therein. Meanwhile, the other story line will be set much farther in the future, the 51st century to be precise and follows a genetically engineered team of tier one special forces designed from the ground up to confront and destroy an age-old enemy, whose agenda is the total eradication of the human species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liptak|first=Andrew|title=''Aliens watch the rise of humanity in an excerpt from Peter F.

===Standalone novels===

* ''[[Fallen Dragon]]'' (2001), {{ISBN|9781447281313}}
His full-length novel, ''Fallen Dragon'', is in many ways a condensation of the ideas and styles (and even characters) of the ''Night's Dawn'' trilogy, if rather darker in tone. The stand-alone book describes a bleak [[corporatist]] society dominated by five mega-corporations which wield almost unlimited power. It describes the troubled military campaign by one of these companies to "realise assets" from a minor colony, through the eyes of a veteran mercenary. One of the more interesting aspects of the book was its unconventional description of a spacefaring society which has  developed interstellar travel but only at vast expense, putting it out of the reach of many people and a one-way trip for most of the rest.

* ''[[Great North Road (book)|Great North Road]]'' (2012), {{ISBN|978-0-345-52666-3}}
Set in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in 2143, the ''Great North Road'' is a futuristic murder-mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/great-north-road-peter-f-hamilton/1109890773?ean=9780345526670|title=Great North Road|author=Thirdyen|date=21 January 2013|work=Barnes &amp; Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Reuben Wells''''' is a [[steam locomotive]] in the permanent collection of [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] located in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]]. Beginning in 1868, it operated for 30&amp;nbsp;years in [[Madison, Indiana]], pushing [[railroad car|train cars]] up the steepest "standard-gauge main-track grade"&lt;ref name="Kriplen"/&gt; in the United States.&lt;ref name="All Aboard"&gt;{{cite web|last=The Children's Museum of Indianapolis|title=All Aboard!|url=http://www.childrensmuseum.org/all-aboard|accessdate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The ''Reuben Wells'' is a [[helper locomotive]] that was built in 1868. It was designed to push train cars up the 5.89% incline of Madison Hill in Madison, Indiana, the steepest segment of standard-gauge main-track in the United States.&lt;ref name="Kriplen"/&gt;  Weighing {{Convert|55|ST|lk=on}}, it was the most powerful locomotive in the world at the time.  It is {{Convert|35|ft}} long.&lt;ref name="All Aboard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newseum"/&gt; The locomotive is named after its designer, engineer Reuben Wells.&lt;ref name=Madison&gt;{{cite news|title=Old Reuben Wells Runs At Chicago|newspaper=The Madison Courier|date=June 24, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical information==

The ''Reuben Wells'' was made specifically for Madison Hill, Indiana, a {{Convert|2|mi|adj=on}} long stretch of track that is known for having the steepest regular incline in the United States.  The [[Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad]] tried many different methods to get train cars up the hill.&lt;ref name=PennCentral&gt;{{cite news|title=Reuben Wells: Famous Engine Starts New Career|newspaper=Penn Central Post|date=August 1, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[coupler (railway)|couplers]] used to connect the [[railroad car|train cars]] were not strong enough to withstand being pulled up the hill, making it necessary for the cars to be pushed.&lt;ref name=Label&gt;{{cite web|title=All Aboard! Exhibit Label|work=The Children's Museum of Indianapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially a team of horses was used to pull the train cars up the hill. Following this, a [[rack railway|cogwheel system]] was in use for about twenty years. The ''Reuben Wells'' was the first steam engine to work the grade by [[rail adhesion|adhesion]] alone, pushing the cars up the hill as well as supporting them on the descent.&lt;ref name=Label/&gt;

After the ''Reuben Wells'' was completed in the railroad shops&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdrm.org/faqs/boilers/page6.html San Diego Railroad Museum] ''Locomotive Boilers and Engines&lt;/ref&gt; in 1868, it pushed train cars up Madison Hill for thirty years before it was retired in 1898.  It stayed in reserve for another seven years before it was retired permanently and sent to [[Purdue University]] in 1905. In the years that followed the ''Reuben Wells'' was included in several exhibitions, including the [[1933 World's Fair|Chicago World's Fair]] in 1933–34 and the [[Chicago Railroad Fair]] in 1948–49.  Afterward, it remained in Pennsylvania at [[Penn Central Railroad Company]] railroad yards.  In 1968, the ''Reuben Wells'' was brought back to Indiana, where it was placed on permanent display at the Children's Museum of Indianapolis.&lt;ref name="Newseum"&gt;{{cite news|title=Most Powerful Locomotive Stationed Here|newspaper=The Children's Museum Newsletter|date=February 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Tom Billings, head of the Children's Museum advisory board, learned that the ''Reuben Wells'' was being kept in storage in Pennsylvania.  On a vacation to Washington and Williamsburg, Billings decided to stop by to see the ''Reuben Wells''.  After he saw it, he started trying to get the ''Reuben Wells'' to be permanently back in Indiana, specifically at the Children's Museum.  Billings contacted Otto Frenzel, a member of the Pennsylvania Railroad board of directors, who disclosed that the railroad company was currently trying to find museums for its steam locomotives. At the time, the ''Reuben Wells'' was already promised to a museum in [[St. Louis]].  Advocates pointed out that the St. Louis museum was already getting several pieces, and St. Louis had no historical connection to the engine.  The campaign was successful, and in May 1967, the Pennsylvania railroad president, Allen Greenough, announced that the ''Reuben Wells'' was coming to Indiana.  It was shipped from Pennsylvania to Indiana on [[flatcar]]s.&lt;ref name="Kriplen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kriplen|first=N|title=Keep An Eye on That Mummy|publisher=The Children's Museum of Indianapolis|location=Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Reuben Wells'' entered Indianapolis with much fanfare on June 11, 1968. A parade was organized to escort the train on the last leg of its journey, accompanied by the Central Indiana Council Boy Scout band and a motorcycle [[motorcade]]. The parade made its way down 38th Street and south on Meridian Street before turning into the Children's Museum. After successful fund-raising efforts from the Indiana Junior Historical Society and the Children's Museum Guild, the ''Reuben Wells'' was installed in a new [[train shed]] on the museum campus the next year. The train was moved into the new building in 1976, where it remains on view on the museum's lower level.&lt;ref name="Kriplen"/&gt; Originally acquired as a permanent loan, the Reuben Wells is now within the permanent collection of the Children's Museum.

[[File:Tangyun - Chinese Dictionary Museum.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Copy of the ''Tangyun'', an 8th-century edition of the ''Qieyun'']]
A '''rime dictionary''', '''rhyme dictionary''', or '''rime book''' ({{zh|t=韻書|s=韵书|p=yùnshū}}) is an ancient type of [[Chinese dictionary]] that collates [[Chinese character|character]]s by [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and [[rhyme]], instead of by [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]].
The most important rime dictionary tradition began with the ''[[Qieyun]]'' (601), which codified correct pronunciations for reading the classics and writing poetry by combining the reading traditions of north and south China.
This work became very popular during the [[Tang dynasty]], and went through a series of revisions and expansions, of which the most famous is the ''[[Guangyun]]'' (1007–1008).

These dictionaries specify the pronunciations of characters using the ''[[fanqie|fǎnqiè]]'' method, giving a pair of characters indicating the [[syllable onset|onset]] and remainder of the syllable respectively.
The later [[rime table]]s gave a significantly more precise and systematic account of the sounds of these dictionaries by tabulating syllables by their onsets, rhyme groups, tones and other properties.
The phonological system inferred from these books, often interpreted using the rime tables, is known as [[Middle Chinese]], and has been the key datum for efforts to recover the sounds of early forms of Chinese.
It incorporates most of the distinctions found in modern [[varieties of Chinese]], as well as some that are no longer distinguished.  It has also been used together with other evidence in the reconstruction of [[Old Chinese]] (1st millennium BC).

Some scholars use the French spelling "rime", as used by the Swedish linguist [[Bernard Karlgren]], for the categories described in these works, to distinguish them from the concept of poetic rhyme.{{sfnp|Branner|2006|p=2}}

{{quote frame|I have taken the sounds and the rhymes of the various specialists and the dictionaries of the ancients and moderns, and by arranging what those before me have recorded, I have made up the five volumes of the ''Qieyun''.  The splits and analyses are exceedingly fine and the distinctions abundant and profuse.|Lu Fayan (601)|Qieyun|preface translated by S.R. Ramsey{{sfnp|Ramsey|1989|p=117}}}}
Chinese scholars produced dictionaries to codify reading pronunciations for the correct recitation of the classics and the associated rhyme conventions of regulated verse.{{sfnp|Coblin|2003|p=379}}
The earliest rime dictionary was the ''[[Shenglei]]'' (lit. "sound types") by Li Deng (李登) of the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, containing more than 11,000 characters grouped under the five notes of the [[Chinese musicology|ancient Chinese musical scale]].{{sfnp|Creamer|1991|p=2603}}
The book did not survive, and is known only from descriptions in later works.{{sfnp|Ting|1996|p=146}}

Various schools of the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] and [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] produced their own dictionaries, which differed on many points.
The most prestigious standards were those of the northern capital [[Luoyang]] and the southern capital Jinling (modern [[Nanjing]]).{{sfnp|Chang|1974|p=70}}
In 601, Lù Fǎyán (陸法言) published his ''[[Qieyun]]'', an attempt to merge the distinctions in five earlier dictionaries.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=35–37}}
According to Lu Fayan's preface, the initial plan of the work was drawn up 20 years earlier in consultation with a group of scholars, three from southern China and five from the north.
However the final compilation was by Lu alone, after he had retired from government service.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=24–25}}

The ''Qieyun'' quickly became popular as the standard of cultivated pronunciation during the [[Tang dynasty]].
The dictionaries on which it was based fell out of use, and are no longer extant.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=24}}
Several revisions appeared, of which the most important were:{{sfnp|Chang|1974|loc=Chart 2|p=74}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=39}}

In 1008, during the [[Song dynasty]], a group of scholars commissioned by the emperor produced an expanded revision called the ''[[Guangyun]]''.
The ''[[Jiyun]]'' (1037) was a greatly expanded revision of the ''Guangyun''.{{sfnp|Chang|1974|loc=Chart 2|p=74}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=38–39}}
Lu's initial work was primarily a guide to pronunciation, with very brief glosses, but later editions included expanded definitions, making them useful as dictionaries.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=39}}

Until the mid-20th century, the oldest complete rime dictionaries known were the ''Guangyun'' and ''Jiyun'', though extant copies of the latter were marred by numerous transcription errors.  Thus all studies of the ''Qieyun'' tradition were actually based on the ''Guangyun''.  Fragments of earlier revisions of the ''Qieyun'' were found early in the century among the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]], in [[Turfan]] and in [[Beijing]].{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=38–39}}{{sfnp|Takata|2004}}

When the ''Qieyun'' became the national standard in the Tang dynasty, several copyists were engaged in producing manuscripts to meet the great demand for revisions of the work.
Particularly prized were copies of Wáng Rénxū's edition, made in the early 9th century, by Wú Cǎiluán (呉彩鸞), a woman famed for her calligraphy.{{sfnp|Takata|2004}}
One of these copies was acquired by [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Huizong]] (1100–1026), himself a keen calligrapher.  It remained in the palace library until 1926, when part of the library followed the deposed emperor [[Puyi]] to [[Tianjin]] and then to [[Changchun]], capital of the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]].  After the Japanese surrender in 1945, it passed to a book dealer in Changchun, and in 1947 two scholars discovered it in a book market in [[Liulichang]], Beijing.{{sfnp|Malmqvist|2010|pp=299–300}}
Studies of this almost complete copy have been published by the Chinese linguists Dong Tonghe (1948 and 1952) and [[Li Rong (linguist)|Li Rong]] (1956).{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=39}}

==Structure==
The ''Qieyun'' and its successors all had the same structure.
The characters were first divided between the [[four tones]].
Because there were more characters of the "level tone" (平聲 ''píngshēng''), they occupied two ''juan'' (卷 "fascicle", "scroll" or "volume"), while the other three tones filled one volume each.
The last category or "[[entering tone]]" (入聲 ''rùshēng'') consisted of words ending in stops ''-p'', ''-t'' or ''-k'', corresponding to words ending in nasals ''-m'', ''-n'' and ''-ng'' in the other three tones.  Today, these final stops are generally preserved in southern [[varieties of Chinese]], but have disappeared in most northern ones, including the standard language.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=33–34}}

Each tone was divided into rhyme groups (韻 ''yùn''), traditionally named after the first character of the group, called the 韻目 ''yùnmù'' ("rhyme eye").{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=27}}
Lu Fayan's edition had 193 rhyme groups, which were expanded to 195 by Zhangsun Nayan and then to 206 by Li Zhou.{{sfnp|Chang|1974|pp=74–75}}
The following shows the beginning of the first rhyme group of the ''Guangyun'', with first character 東 ("east"):

[[File:Guangyun Dong Rhyme 1.jpg|700px|center]]

Each rhyme group was subdivided into [[homophone]] groups preceded by a small circle called a 紐 ''niǔ'' ("button").
The entry for each character gave a brief explanation of its meaning.
At the end of the entry for the first character of a homophone group was a description of its pronunciation, given by a ''[[fǎnqiè]]'' formula, a pair of characters indicating the initial (聲母 ''shēngmǔ'') and final (韻母 ''yùnmǔ'') respectively.
The formula was followed by the character 反 ''fǎn'' (in the ''Qieyun'') or the character 切 ''qiè'' (in the ''Guangyun''), followed by the number of homophonous characters.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=35–40}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=26–28}}
For example, the pronunciation of 東 was described using the characters 德 ''tok'' and 紅 ''huwng'', indicating ''tuwng''.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1989|p=119}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=33}}{{efn|Middle Chinese transcriptions are given in [[Baxter's transcription for Middle Chinese|Baxter's system]].}}
In the above sample, this formula is followed by the number 十七, indicating that there are 17 entries, including 東, with the same pronunciation.

The order of the rhyme groups within each volume does not seem to follow any rule, except that similar groups were placed together, and corresponding groups in different tones were usually placed in the same order.  Where two rhyme groups were similar, there was a tendency to choose exemplary words with the same initial.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=34–35}}
The table of contents of the ''Guangyun'' marks adjacent rhyme groups as ''tóngyòng'' (同用), meaning they could rhyme in regulated verse.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1984|pp=139–141}}
In the above sample, under the entry for the rhyme group 刪 in the last part the table of contents (on the right page) is the notation "山同用", indicating that this group could rhyme with the following group 山.

The following are the rhyme groups of the ''Guangyun'' with their modern names, the finals they include (see next section), and the broad rhyme groups (''shè'' 攝) they were assigned to in the [[rime table]]s.  A few entries are re-ordered to place corresponding rhyme groups of different tones in the same row, and darker lines separate the ''tongyong'' groups:

==Phonological system==
The rime dictionaries have been intensively studied as important sources on the [[phonology]] of medieval Chinese, and the system they reveal has been dubbed [[Middle Chinese]].  Since the ''Qieyun'' itself was believed lost until the mid-20th century, most of this work was based on the ''Guangyun''.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=38}}

The books exhaustively list the syllables and give pronunciations, but do not describe the phonology of the language.
This was first attempted in the [[rime table]]s, the oldest of which date from the Song dynasty, but which may represent a tradition going back to the late Tang dynasty.
Though not quite a phonemic analysis, these tables analysed the syllables of the rime books using lists of initials, finals and other features of the syllable.
The initials are further analysed in terms of place and manner of articulation, suggesting inspiration from [[Vyākaraṇa|Indian linguistics]], at that time the most advanced in the world.
However the rime tables were compiled some centuries after the ''Qieyun'', and many of its distinctions would have been obscure.
[[Edwin Pulleyblank]] treats the rime tables as describing a Late Middle Chinese stage, in contrast to the Early Middle Chinese of the rime dictionaries.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=28–34, 40}}

=== Structural analysis ===
In his ''Qièyùn kǎo'' (1842), the Cantonese scholar [[Chen Li (scholar)|Chen Li]] set out to identify the initial and final categories underlying the fanqie spellings in the ''Guangyun''.
The system was clearly not minimal, employing 452 characters as initial spellers and around 1200 as final spellers.
However no character could be used as a speller for itself.
Thus, for example,{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|p=10}}
* 東 was spelled 德 + 紅.
* 德 was spelled 多 + 特.
* 多 was spelled 德 + 河.
From this we may conclude that 東, 德 and 多 must all have had the same initial.  By following such chains of equivalences Chen was able to identify categories of equivalent initial spellers, and similarly for the finals.
More common segments tended to have the most variants.
Words with the same final would rhyme, but a rhyme group might include between one and four finals with different medial glides, as seen in the above table of rhyme groups.
The inventory of initials Chen obtained resembled the [[36 initials]] of the rime tables, but with significant differences.
In particular the "light lip sounds" and "heavy lip sounds" of the rime tables were not distinguished in the fanqie, while each of the "proper tooth sounds" corresponded to two distinct fanqie initial categories.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=28}}{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1984|pp=142–143}}{{sfnp|Malmqvist|1994|pp=19–20}}

Unaware of Chen's work, the Swedish linguist [[Bernard Karlgren]] repeated the analysis identifying the initials and finals in the 1910s.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1984|p=142}}
The initials could be divided into two broad types: [[grave and acute|grave initials]] (labials, velars and laryngeals), which combine with all finals, and acute initials (the others), with more restricted distribution.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=59–60}}
Like Chen, Karlgren noted that in syllables with grave initials, the finals fell into two broad types, now usually referred to (following [[Edwin Pulleyblank]]) as types A and B.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1984|p=78}}
He also noted that these types could be further subdivided into four classes of finals distinguished by the initials with which they could combine.
These classes partially correspond to the four rows or "divisions", traditionally numbered I–IV, of the later rime tables.
The observed combinations of initials and finals are as follows:{{sfnp|Branner|2006|pp=24–25, 33}}

Some of the "mixed" finals are actually pairs of type B finals after grave initials, with two distinct homophone groups for each initial, but a single final after acute initials.  These pairs, known as ''[[chongniu]]'', are also marked in the rime tables by splitting them between rows III and IV, but their interpretation remains uncertain.  There is also no consensus regarding which final of the pair should be identified with the single final occurring after acute initials.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=75–80}}

=== Reconstructed sound values ===
Karlgren also sought to determine the phonetic values of the abstract categories yielded by the formal analysis, by comparing the categories of the ''Guangyun'' with other types of evidence, each of which presented their own problems.  The Song dynasty rime tables applied a sophisticated featural analysis to the rime books, but were separated from them by centuries of sound change, and some of their categories are difficult to interpret.  The so-called [[Sino-Xenic]] pronunciations, readings of Chinese loanwords in Vietnamese, Korean and Japanese, were ancient, but affected by the different phonological structures of those languages.  Finally modern [[varieties of Chinese]] provided a wealth of evidence, but often influenced each other as a result of a millennium of migration and political upheavals.
After applying a variant of the [[comparative method]] in a subsidiary role to flesh out the rime dictionary evidence, Karlgren believed that he had reconstructed the speech of the Sui-Tang capital [[Chang'an]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=24, 34–39}}

Later workers have refined [[Karlgren–Li reconstruction of Middle Chinese|Karlgren's reconstruction]].

In most cases, the simpler inventories of initials of modern varieties of Chinese can be treated as varying developments of the ''Qieyun'' initials.  The voicing distinction is retained in [[Wu Chinese]] dialects, but has disappeared from other varieties.  Except in the [[Min Chinese]] dialects, a [[labiodental]] series has split from the labial series, a development already reflected in the Song dynasty rime tables.  The retroflex and palatal sibilants had also merged by that time.  In Min dialects the retroflex stops have merged with the dental stops, while elsewhere they have merged with the retroflex sibilants.  In the south these have also merged with the dental sibilants, but the distinction is maintained in most [[Mandarin Chinese]] dialects.  The palatal series of modern Mandarin dialects, resulting from a merger of palatal allophones of dental sibilants and velars, is a much more recent development.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=45–59}}

Assigning phonetic values to the finals has proved more difficult, as many of the distinctions reflected in the ''Qieyun'' have been lost over time.
Karlgren proposed that type B finals contained a [[palatal approximant|palatal medial]] {{IPA|/j/}}, a position that is still accepted by most scholars.  However Pulleyblank, noting the use of these syllables in the transcription of foreign words without such a medial, claims the medial developed later.
A [[labio-velar approximant|labiovelar medial]] {{IPA|/w/}} is also widely accepted, with some syllables having both medials.
The codas are believed to reflect those of many modern varieties, namely the glides {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}, nasals {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}} and corresponding stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}.
Some authors argue that the placement of the first four rhyme groups in the ''Qieyun'' suggests that they had distinct codas, reconstructed as [[labialized velar consonant|labiovelar]]s {{IPA|/ŋʷ/}} and {{IPA|/kʷ/}}.
Most reconstructions posit a large number of vowels to distinguish the many ''Qieyun'' rhyme classes that occur with some codas, but the number and the values assigned vary widely.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=36–39}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=61–63, 70–71}}

The Chinese linguist [[Li Rong (linguist)|Li Rong]] published a study of the early edition of the ''Qieyun'' found in 1947, showing that the expanded dictionaries had preserved the phonological structure of the ''Qieyun'' intact, except for a merger of initials /dʐ/ and /ʐ/.
For example, although the number of rhyme groups increased from 193 in the earlier dictionary to 206 in the ''Guangyun'', the differences are limited to splitting rhyme groups based on the presence or absence of a medial glide [[Labio-velar approximant|{{IPA|/w/}}]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=24–27}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=38–40}}{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1984|pp=135–136}}

However the preface of the recovered ''Qieyun'' suggests that it represented a compromise between northern and southern reading pronunciations.{{efn|For translations of the ''Qieyun'' preface, see {{harvtxt|Baxter|1992}}, pp. 35–36 and {{harvtxt|Ramsey|1989}}, pp. 116–117.}}
Most linguists now believe that no single dialect contained all the distinctions recorded, but that each distinction did occur somewhere.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=24–25}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=35–38}}
For example, the ''Qieyun'' distinguished three rhyme groups 支, 脂 and 之 (all pronounced ''zhī'' in modern Chinese), although 支 and 脂 were not distinguished in parts of the north, while 脂 and 之 rhymed in the south.
The three groups are treated as ''tongyong'' in the ''Guangyun'' and have merged in all modern varieties.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1998|pp=203–204}} 
Although Karlgren's identification of the ''Qieyun'' system with a Sui-Tang standard is no longer accepted, the fact that it contains more distinctions than any single contemporary form of speech means that it retains more information about earlier stages of the language, and is a major component in the reconstruction of [[Old Chinese phonology]].{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=37–38}}

==''Pingshui'' rhyme categories==
From early in the Tang dynasty, candidates in the [[imperial examination]] were required to compose [[Chinese poetry|poetry]] and [[Fu (poetry)|rhymed prose]] in conformance with the rhyme categories of the ''Qieyun''.
However, the fine distinctions made by the ''Qieyun'' were found overly restrictive by poets, and [[Xu Jingzong]] and others suggested more relaxed rhyming rules.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1984|p=139}}
The ''Píngshuǐ'' (平水) system of 106 rhyme groups, first codified during the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]], eventually became the prescribed system for the imperial examination.
It became the standard for official rhyme books, and was also used as the classification system for such reference works as the ''[[Peiwen Yunfu]]''.{{sfnp|Branner|1999|p=87}}{{sfnp|Yong|Peng|2008|p=324}}

The ''Píngshuǐ'' rhyme groups are the same as the ''tóngyòng'' groups of the ''Guangyun'', with a few exceptions:{{sfnp|Branner|1999|p=87}}
* The 廢 ''fèi'' group is merged with 隊 ''duì''.{{sfnp|Branner|1999|p=92}}
* The rising and departing tone groups corresponding to 蒸 ''zhēng'' were merged into the 迥 ''jiǒng'' and 徑 ''jìng'' groups.
* The groups 嚴 ''yán'' and 凡 ''fán'', which were ''tóngyòng'' in the ''Guangyun'', and in complementary distribution, were split between the two preceding ''tóngyòng'' groups.{{sfnp|Branner|1999|pp=106–107}}

[[Yan Zhengqing]]'s ''[[Yunhai jingyuan]]'' (c. 780) was the first rime dictionary of multisyllabic words rather than single characters.{{sfnp|Yong|Peng|2008|p=226}}
Though no longer extant, it served as the model for a series of encyclopedic dictionaries of literary words and phrases organized by ''Píngshuǐ'' rhyme groups, culminating in the ''[[Peiwen Yunfu]]'' (1711).{{sfnp|Yong|Peng|2008|pp=324, 332–333}}

==Vernacular dictionaries==
[[File:Zhongyuan Yinyun 侵尋 rhyme group.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|''Zhongyuan Yinyun'' rhyme group 侵尋 (-im, -əm), divided into four tones]]
A side-effect of foreign rule of northern China between the 10th and 14th centuries was a weakening of many of the old traditions. New genres of vernacular literature such as the ''[[Qu (poetry)|qu]]'' and ''[[Chinese Sanqu poetry|sanqu]]'' poetry appeared, as well as the ''[[Zhongyuan Yinyun]]'', created by Zhōu Déqīng (周德清) in 1324 as a guide to the rhyming conventions of ''qu''.  The ''Zhongyuan Yinyun'' was a radical departure from the rhyme table tradition, with the entries grouped into 19 rhyme classes each identified by a pair of exemplary characters.  These rhyme classes combined rhymes from different tones, whose parallelism was implicit in the ordered of the ''Guangyun'' ryhmes.  The rhyme classes are subdivided by tone and then into groups of homophones, with no other indication of pronunciation. The dictionary reflects [[Old Mandarin|contemporaneous northern speech]], with the even tone divided in upper and lower tones, and the loss of the Middle Chinese final stops.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=49–50}} Such syllables, formerly grouped in the entering tone, are distributed between the other tones, but placed after the other syllables with labels such as 入聲作去聲 (''rùshēng zuò qùshēng'' "entering tone makes departing tone").{{sfnp|Yong|Peng|2008|p=252}}

The early Ming dictionary ''Yùnluè yìtōng'' (韻略易通) by Lan Mao was based on the ''Zhongyuan Yinyun'', but arranged the homophone groups according to a fixed order of initials, which were listed in a mnemonic poem in the ''[[ci (poetry)|ci]]'' form.{{sfnp|Yong|Peng|2008|p=272}}{{sfnp|Li|1993|p=30}}
However, there could still be multiple homophone groups under a given rhyme group, tone and initial, as medial glides were not considered part of the rhyme.
Further innovations are found in a rime dictionary from the late 16th century describing the [[Fuzhou dialect]], which is preserved, together with a later redaction, in the ''[[Qi Lin Bayin]]''.
This work enumerates the finals of the dialect, differentiated by both medial and rhyme, and classifies each homophone group uniquely by final, initial and tone.
Both finals and initials are listed in ''ci'' poems.{{sfnp|Li|1993|pp=30–34}}

==Tangut==
[[File:Sea of Characters Level Tone folio 53.jpg|thumb|right|''Sea of Characters'', level tone folio 53]]
[[Tangut language|Tangut]] was the language of the [[Western Xia]] state (1038–1227), centred on the area of modern [[Gansu]].
The language had been extinct for four centuries when an extensive corpus of documents in the logographic [[Tangut script]] were discovered in the early 20th century.
One of the sources used to reconstruct the Tangut language is the ''Sea of Characters'' [[File:LFW2008 4797.png|16px]][[File:LFW2008 0661.png|16px]] ({{zh|c=文海|p=Wénhǎi}}), a rhyme dictionary written entirely in Tangut, but with the same structure as the Chinese dictionaries.
The dictionary consists of one volume each for the Tangut level and rising tones, with a third volume of "mixed category" characters, whose significance is unclear.
As with the Chinese dictionaries, each volume is divided into rhymes, and then into homophone groups separated by a small circle.
The pronunciation of the first Tangut character in each homophone group is given by a ''fanqie'' formula using a pair of Tangut characters.
Mikhail Sofronov applied Chen Li's method to these ''fanqie'' to construct the system of Tangut initials and finals.{{sfnp|Jacques|2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13566">This is a complete bibliography by English [[space opera]] and [[fantasy]] author [[Simon R. Green]]

==Bibliography==
Most of Green's works take place within the same fictional realm, encompassing multiple realities which characters inhabit, or in some cases move between. Although cross-series use of characters or settings is frequently limited to passing mentions or brief [[cameo appearance]]s, a number of Green's stories have prominently featured characters from other works in a manner that is significant to the plot. Despite this, Green's works can, with some exceptions, be separated into several distinct series and standalone novels.

===Series===

==== ''Deathstalker'' ====
{{main|Deathstalker (series)}}

# ''[[Deathstalker (novel)|Deathstalker]]'' (London, Gollancz 1995).
# ''Deathstalker Rebellion'' (London, Vista 1996).
# ''Deathstalker War'' (London, Gollancz/Vista 1997).
# ''Deathstalker Honour'' (London, Gollancz/Vista 1998).
# ''[[Deathstalker Destiny]]'' (London, Orion/Millennium 1999).
# ''Deathstalker Legacy'' (2003)
# ''Deathstalker Return'' (New York, Roc 2004). {{ISBN|0-451-42821-8}}
# ''Deathstalker Coda'' (2005)

The ''Deathstalker'' series is partly a parody of the usual [[space opera]] of the 1950s, told with sovereign disregard of the rules of probability, while being at the same time extremely bloodthirsty.

==== ''Forest Kingdom'' ====

# ''[[Blue Moon Rising (novel)|Blue Moon Rising]]''. New York, Penguin/Roc, May 1991; London, Gollancz, September 1991.
# ''Blood and Honour''. London, Gollancz, June 1992; as ''Blood and Honor'', New York, Penguin/Roc, May 1993.
# ''Down Among the Dead Men''. London, Gollancz, September 1993; New York, Penguin/Roc, December 1993.

# ''Once in a Blue Moon''. Roc, USA, January 2014; {{ISBN|978-0451414663}}.

This series focuses on characters and events in the northern areas of the Low Kingdoms, the same kingdom which encompasses the southern city of Haven (the setting of the Hawk and Fisher series). It largely deals with the events and aftermath of the Demon War, focusing on multiple characters and plot arcs. The series serves as a companion to the ''Hawk and Fisher'' series, ''Blue Moon Rising'' taking place before the first ''Hawk and Fisher'' novel, and ''Beyond the Blue Moon'' being a followup to both ''Blue Moon Rising'' and the ''Hawk and Fisher'' series as a whole.

==== ''Ghost Finders'' ====
# ''Ghost of a Chance'' (August 2010)
# ''Ghost of a Smile'' (August 2011)
# ''Ghost of a Dream'' (August 2012)
# ''Spirits From Beyond'' (August 2013)
# ''Voices From Beyond'' (26 August 2014)
# ''Forces From Beyond'' (25 August 2015)

The Ghostfinders of the Carnacki Institute are here to "Do Something" about ghosts, and live by the motto "We don't take any shit from the Hereafter".  This series follows a team of three Ghostfinders: the leader, JC Chance, who was touched by something from Outside in a recent case and is still trying to determine what all that means; Melody Chambers, girl geek and computer expert; and "Happy" Jack Palmer, Class Eleven telepath and official gloomy bugger.  They are joined by JC's ghost girlfriend, Kim.  JC's motley crew is now considered an "A Team" at the Institute, and are slowly putting pieces together of a greater threat facing humanity. The Ghost Finders series was ended when the sixth book was released in August 2015.

The Ghostfinders series takes place in the same world as the Nightside, Secret Histories, and various other Simon R. Green novels, with frequent references to characters and places between them.

Hawk and Fisher are a husband and wife team on the City Guard, an order which functions rather like a modern police force in a fantasy world of mixed [[Middle Ages|Medieval]], [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]], and [[Industrial Revolution]] stylings. They live in the port city of Haven, a city-state so corrupt that they can justly make the claim of being the only guards who have never taken a bribe or looked the other direction. They deal with everything from pickpockets to wide-scale destructive magic.

Ishmael Jones is someone who cannot afford to be noticed, someone who lives under the radar, who drives on the dark side of the road. He is employed to search out secrets, investigate mysteries and shine a light in dark places. Sometimes he kills people.

* ''A Walk on the Nightside'' (Ace, 5 September 2006)  (A collection of the first three Nightside novels.)

A series of fantasy novels centering on the protagonist, John Taylor, and based in the "Nightside", a hidden area within London in which magic and advanced technology exist. This series also ties into the Hawk and Fisher series (i.e. mentioning the Street of the Gods, a prominent setting in the second and third novellas, ''Winner Take All'' and ''God Killer''). Indeed, Hawk and Fisher appear drinking at Strangefellows Pub in the Nightside as an unnamed but clearly recognizable couple in ''A Hard Day's Knight'', and the Deathstalker series is often referenced: Haceldama, Hadenmen, and the Darkvoid Device are all mentioned in passing. Razor Eddie, Punk God of the Straight Razor, is rumored to have gone to the Street of the Gods to make a deal with some unknown deity for all the evil he had done, and came back changed. The Nightside series was completed when the twelfth book was released in January 2012.

This book series was supposed to be a trilogy, but due to the great popularity of the books Green decided to continue with the series, until finally ending it with ''Night Fall''. Being all from the same universe, the ''Deathstalker'' series has had a member of the Deathstalker family in the ''Secret Histories'' novel. Along with this comes a meeting with John Taylor, a cameo appearance of Walker (both from the ''Nightside'' series), and an appearance of the Carnacki Institute's boss (from the ''Ghost Finders'' series).

# ''Mistworld''. New York, Ace, Sep 1992; London, Gollancz, Nov 1992.
# ''Ghostworld''. New York, Ace, Mar 1993; London, Gollancz, Sep 1993.
# ''Hellworld''. New York, Ace, Sep 1993; revised, London, Gollancz, Dec 1995.
# ''Twilight of the Empire'' (omnibus; contains ''Mistworld'', ''Ghostworld'', and ''Hellworld''). New York, Penguin/Roc, Aug 1997; as ''Deathstalker Prelude'' (with revised version of ''Hellworld''), London, Gollancz/Vista, Nov 1998.

Set in the ''[[Deathstalker (novel)|Deathstalker]]'' universe. ''Mistworld'' tells the tale of the Empire's attack on the free planet of Mistworld, haven of outlaws and rebels, using Typhoid Mary. ''Ghostworld'' introduces Captain Silence and his crew as they respond to an emergency on the (supposedly) dead planet of Unseeli. ''Hellworld'' finds Captain Hunter and his scouts stranded on a nightmarish planet.

All three [[novella]]s either introduce characters that later appear in the main ''Deathstalker'' epic series, or concern events that are later referred to in the main ''Deathstalker'' epic series.

=== Standalone books ===
* ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'' (film novelization)
* ''Shadows Fall''

The ''Shadows Fall'' novel takes place in the same world as the ''Nightside'' series and is mentioned as a destination via subway in several of the ''Nightside'' novels. Characters mentioned in the ''Shadows Fall'' novel have appeared in the ''Nightside'' including Father Time, Bruin Bear, and Sea Goat as well as the building Time Tower, which is the residence of Father Time.

* ''Drinking Midnight Wine''

An audio version of ''Drinking Midnight Wine'' was released in 2013, read by English actor [[Dikran Tulaine]].

===Short stories===
Green plans to release all his short stories in two separate anthologies. The second will be a collection of Nightside shorts featuring a new novella, and the first anthology will contain his other works, also including a new novella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=December News|url=http://simonrgreen.co.uk/2012/12/11/december-news|website=simonrgreen.co.uk|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Spalding Club''' was the name of three successive [[antiquarian]] and [[Text publication society|text publication]] societies founded in [[Aberdeen]], which published scholarly editions of texts and [[archaeology|archaeological]] studies relevant to the history of [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]] and its region. The clubs were named after the 17th-century historian [[John Spalding (historian)|John Spalding]].&lt;ref name=DNBSpalding /&gt;

==First club==
The original club was founded by [[Joseph Robertson (historian)|Joseph Robertson]] (1810–1866) in 1839,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|title=Robertson, Joseph (1810-1866)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included among its members [[Cosmo Innes]] and [[John Stuart (genealogist)|John Stuart]]. Stuart served as secretary and was editor of many of the works published.&lt;ref name=dnbStuart&gt;{{cite DNB |wstitle =Stuart, John (1813-1877)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-eight quarto volumes appeared in the club's main numbered series, as well as another six volumes uniform with but not part of that series. Seventeen of these volumes were edited by John Stuart: his more important works included ''Sculptured Stones of Scotland'' (1856 and 1867), a highly valued work of antiquarian reference; and ''[[Book of Deer|The Book of Deer]]'' (1869), an edition of an important manuscript [[Gospel Book]] held at one time at the [[abbey of Deer]].&lt;ref name=dnbStuart /&gt; The club ceased to be active after 1870. 

==Second club==
The '''New Spalding Club''' was founded at Aberdeen in 1886.&lt;ref name=DNBSpalding&gt;{{cite DNB |wstitle =Spalding, John |first =William |last = Galloway |volume=53 |quote=''Sources:'' [Pref. by Dr. Stuart to Spalding Club edit. of Spalding's History; Par.

A '''ticket''' is a [[voucher]] that indicates that an individual is entitled to admission to an event or establishment such as a theatre, amusement park or [[tourist attraction]], or has a right to travel on a vehicle, such as with an [[airline ticket]], [[bus|bus ticket]] or [[train ticket]]. An individual typically pays for a ticket, but it may be free of charge. A ticket may serve simply as proof of entitlement or reservation. A ticket may be valid for any seat ("free seating") or for a specific one ("allocated seating").

==Overview==
Members of the public can buy a ticket at a ticket window or counter, called a [[box office]] in the entertainment industry (this term is also used for the total receipts). The ticket check may also be there, or it may be separate. Tickets may also be available from [[reseller]]s, which typically are commercial enterprises that purchase tickets in bulk, and resell them to members of the public, adding a surcharge. Consumers buy from resellers for reasons of convenience and availability. The convenience factor relates to being able to obtain tickets locally, and also being able to make alternate selections on the spot if the preferred performance is not available. The availability factor relates to the fact that all tickets may have been sold out at the box office, requiring the purchaser to either obtain tickets from the reseller, or not to see the show (or at least not see the particular performance of choice).

Sometimes, for some train journeys, both free or allocated seating are available, with an increased charge for a reserved seat. A passenger with a free seating ticket in a train carries the risk of having to stand. In a cinema a free seating ticket means that a seat is guaranteed, just not a specific one.

[[Paper]] or [[card stock|card]] is generally used, although [[plastic]] may be used instead for durability. Some have a [[barcode]] or [[magnetic stripe]] for keeping simple [[data]] stored on them, higher end ones use chips to store more data and prevent counterfeiting.

A paper ticket often is perforated so it can be separated into two parts, one (the '''ticket stub'''&lt;!-- [[Ticket stub]] redirects here --&gt;) to be kept by the customer, and one to be kept by the ticket controller. Whether or not one can leave and reenter with the customer part only varies. It may not be allowed to avoid subsequent use of one ticket by multiple people, or even simultaneous use by giving the ticket to someone before the ticket check (if this is physically possible), but it may also be allowed, ex: in a movie theatre to buy, during a movie, a snack or drink before the ticket check and reenter.

Tickets may be printed in advance, or fully or partly printed when issued, or it may be a printed form that is completed in handwriting (ex: by a [[train conductor]] who does not carry a ticket machine, but just a supply of forms and a pen).

==Security issues==
[[Counterfeit]] tickets are a problem at high-priced concerts and other events, so [[hologram]]s are used on tickets for the [[Olympic Games]], [[Super Bowl]], [[FIFA World Cup]] and other high-profile events.

The fraudulent practice of passing-back a ticket can be overcome by making the ticket in the form of a tamper-proof wristband.

When [[Online shop#Payment|paying online]] for admission one may get a code, or a ticket that can be printed out.  At the premises, it is made sure that the same right of admission is not used twice.

[[Internet fraud#Internet ticket fraud|Internet ticket fraud]] has become widespread, with authentic-looking but fake ticket websites taking customers' money but not delivering the tickets, notably for the [[2008 Beijing Olympic Games]] (through websites not based in China).

==Virtual queueing==
Free tickets are applied in virtual [[queueing]]. In a place where one has to wait one's turn, there may be the system that one takes a ticket with a number from a dispenser. This system is usually found in [[hospital]]s and [[surgery|surgeries]], and at offices where many people visit, like [[town hall]]s, [[social security]] offices, [[labor exchange]]s, or [[post office]]s.

Another form of virtual queuing is where the ticket carries a time-slot on it, rather than just a sequentially incremented number. This type of ticket would allow someone to do other things and then return for a roller-coaster ride, for example, without having to actually stand and wait in line.

==Coach ticket==
A [[coach (vehicle)|coach]] ticket is  a document created by a coach operator or a travel agent to confirm that an individual has purchased a seat on a coach. This document is then used to obtain travel on the operators coach fleet. Only with this ticket is the passenger allowed to board the coach.

A paper ticket is only good for the coach operator for which it was purchased. Usually the paper ticket is for a specific journey. It is sometimes possible to purchase an 'open' ticket which allows travel on any coach between the destinations listed on the ticket. The cost for doing this is greater than a ticket for a specific journey.

Some tickets are refundable. However the lower cost tickets are usually not refundable and may carry many additional restrictions.
It is now common for a traveller to print out tickets online and use these on coaches instead of having tickets sent to them in the traditional way. Many coach operators use this system to save costs; some allow a text from the operator to act as a ticket with a unique reference number.  Bus tickets are similar.

==Pass==
{{Main|Season ticket}}
A pass is a special ticket, representing some [[subscription business model|subscription]], in particular for unlimited use of a service or collection of services.  Sometimes the pass replaces the tickets, sometimes it entitles the holder to free tickets. In the latter case, typically both the pass and the ticket has to be shown at the ticket check.

Alternatively, there is the [[Discounts and allowances|discount]] pass, for services such as those above: for a fee per unit time (or as a benefit on other grounds) one gets a discount on each purchase. Alternatively, a multi-use ticket (either valid a limited time, or indefinitely) may provide a discount. For example, a pass for entering a cinema 6 times within a year may cost the price of 4 or 5 tickets. A multi-use ticket may or may not be personal. If not, there may be a limitation to the number of people who can use the same multi-use ticket at the same time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="103635">The period of '''[[witch trials]] in [[Early Modern Europe]]''', also called the '''Burning Times''',&lt;ref&gt;mostly in   the Holy Roman Empire, the British Isles  and France,  and to some extent in the European colonies in North America; largely excluding the Iberian Peninsula and Italy; "Inquisition Spain and Portugal, obsessed with heresy, ignored the witch craze. In Italy, witch trials were comparatively rare and did not involve torture and executions." Anne L. Barstow, ''Witchcraze : a New History of the European Witch Hunts'', HarperCollins, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;   were a widespread [[moral panic]] suggesting that malevolent [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[witchcraft|witches]] were operating as an organized threat to [[Christendom]] during the 16th to 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 01.&lt;/ref&gt; Those accused of witchcraft were portrayed as being worshippers of the [[Devil]], who engaged in such acts as malevolent [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]] at meetings known as [[Witches' Sabbath]]s. Many people were subsequently accused of being witches, and were put on trial for the crime, with varying punishments being applicable in different regions and at different times. More than 75% of those executed in Europe between 1580 and 1630 were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Case Study: The European Witch-Hunts, c. 1450-1750 and Witch-Hunts Today |last=Jones |first=Adam |work=Gendercide Watch |access-date=19 October 2018 |url= http://www.faculty.umb.edu/gary_zabel/Courses/Phil%20281b/Philosophy%20of%20Magic/Arcana/Witchcraft%20and%20Grimoires/case_witchhunts.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though some of the earliest trials are from the [[Late Medieval period]] following Pope Innocent VIII's issue of the [[Summis desiderantes affectibus]], which recognized the existence of witches and gave full papal approval for the inquisition to move against witches, the peak of witch hunting was during the [[European wars of religion]], climaxing from 1580 to 1630. The witch hunts declined in the early 18th century, culminating with the British [[Witchcraft Act of 1735]], but there were sporadic witch-trials during the second half of the 18th century, the last known dating to 1782&lt;ref name="Thurston 2001 Page 79"&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; (though a prosecution was commenced in Tennessee as recently as 1833).&lt;ref name="topix.com"&gt;Poulson's American Daily Advertiser, Volume LX, August 10, 1834, Number 17,057 (From the Nashville (Tenn.)

An estimated total of 30,000-60,000 people were executed during the witch trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1183992/why-europe-was-overrun-by-witch-hunts-in-early-modern-history/|title=Why did Germany burn so many witches?

Among the largest and most notable were the [[Trier witch trials]] (1581–1593), the [[Fulda witch trials]] (1603–1606), the [[Würzburg witch trial]] (1626–1631) and the [[Bamberg witch trials]] (1626–1631).

The sociological causes of the witch-hunts have long been debated. Mainstream historiography sees the reason for the witch craze in a complex interplay of various factors that mark the [[early modern period]], including the religious [[sectarianism]] in the wake of the [[Reformation]], besides other religious, societal, economic and climatic factors.

== Background ==
{{further|Witch hunt}}
The witch-trials emerged in the 16th century out of the practices surrounding the persecution of [[heresy]] in the medieval period, although they reached their peak during the [[Wars of Religion]] and on the heels of the [[Protestant Reformation]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

While belief in witches and preternatural evil were widespread in pre-Christian Europe,&lt;ref name="Hutton 1991 Page 257"&gt;The belief in and persecution of witches especially in Germanic pagan Europe is reflected in [[Germanic law]], and in an episode in [[Jordanes]]' ''[[Getica]]'' (6th century). See e.g. [[#Hut91|Hutton 1991]]. p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; the influence of the Church in the early medieval era resulted in the revocation of these laws in many places,&lt;ref name="Hutton 1991 Page 257"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Likewise, the Lombard King Rothari (c. 606–52) decreed in 643 that Christians must not believe that women devour a human being from inside (''ut mulier hominem vivum instrinsecus possit comedere''), and therefore supposed witches (''strigae'') must not be killed, particularly not convicted in court." Behringer, ''Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History'', p. 30 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; bringing an end to traditional pagan witch hunts.&lt;ref name="Hutton 1991 Page 257"/&gt; Throughout the medieval era mainstream Christian teaching had denied the existence of witches and witchcraft, condemning it as pagan superstition.&lt;ref&gt;"Clearly, there was an increase in skeptical voices during the Carolingian period, even if we take into account an increase in surviving sources.", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", p. 31 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Christian influence on popular beliefs in witches and ''[[Maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]]'' (harm committed by magic) failed to entirely eradicate folk belief in witches.&lt;ref&gt;"Study after study has shown how, all over Europe, ordinary people regularly appealed not to their own consciences, or to the conscience of the Church, but to local practitioners skilled in healing, divination, and astrology for help with their everyday problems. They did this frequently in cases of suspected ''maleficium'', but any kind of misfortune, anticipated or experienced, could justify a visit to the 'cunning' man or woman.", Clark, "Thinking With Demons: the Idea of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe", p. 457 (1999). Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the 13th century was instrumental in developing the new theology which would give rise to the witch hunts.&lt;ref&gt;"Christian theology underwent a major shift of attitude only during the 13th century. In his Summa contra Gentiles, Thomas Aquinas (1255–74) not only confirmed Augustine's semiotic theory, according to which spells, amulets or magical rituals indicated a secret pact with demons, but gave the impression that sorcerers, through the support of the devil, could physically commit their crimes.", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", pp. 35–36 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Because sorcery was judged by secular courts, it was not until ''[[Maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]]'' was identified with heresy that theological trials for witchcraft could commence.&lt;ref&gt;"Sorcery was, however, still subject to secular law and secular courts, since the main indictment was ''maleficium''. Subsequent inquisitors like Nicolas Eymeric (c. 1320–99), inquisitor of Aragon, in his Directorium Inquisitorum of 1376 equated sorcerers with heretics because both were supposed to adore the devil. Sorcery, or witchcraft, was thus redefined as a spiritual crime, subject primarily to ecclesiastical courts, and the Inquisition in particular.", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", p. 36 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; This was accompanied by a number of developments in common Christian belief, i.e. the recognition of the existence of witchcraft as a form of Satanic influence, and its classification as a heresy. As [[Renaissance occultism]] gained traction among the educated classes, the belief in witchcraft, which in the medieval period had been part of the [[folk religion]] of the uneducated rural population, was incorporated into an increasingly comprehensive theology of Satan as the ultimate source of all ''maleficium''.&lt;ref&gt;"Early Christian theologians attributed to the Devil responsibility for persecution, heresy, witchcraft, sin, natural disasters, human calamities, and whatever else went wrong. One tragic consequence of this was a tendency to demonize people accused of wrongs. At the instance of ecclesiastical leaders, the state burned heretics and witches, burning symbolizing the fate deserved by the demonic. Popular fears, stirred to fever pitch in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, sustained frenzied efforts to wipe out heretics, witches, and unbelievers, especially Jews.", Hinson, "Historical and Theological Perspectives on Satan", ''[[Review &amp; Expositor]]'' (89.4.475), (Fall 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Trevor-Roper has said that it was necessary for belief in the Kingdom of Satan to die before the witch theory could be discredited.", Larner, 'Crime of Witchcraft In Early Modern Europe', in Oldridge, 'The Witchcraft Reader', p. 211 (2002). Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes in the doctrinal shift were completed in the mid 15th century, specifically in the wake of the [[Council of Basel]] and centered on the [[Duchy of Savoy]] in the western Alps,&lt;ref&gt;"We are reasonably confident today that the 'classical' doctrine of witchcraft crystallized during the middle third of the 15th century, shortly after the Council of Basel, primarily within a western Alpine zone centred around the duchy of Savoy (Ostorero et al. 1999).", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", pp. 18–19 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to an early series of witch trials by both secular and ecclesiastical courts in the second half of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;"By the end of the 15th century, scattered trials for witchcraft by both secular and ecclesiastical courts occurred in many places from the Pyrenees, where the Spanish Inquisition had become involved, to the North Sea.", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", pp. 18–19 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', the 1485 treatise by [[Henricus Institoris]], met initial resistance in some areas&lt;ref&gt;"Germany was emphatically not the center of this activity; Institoris encountered enormous hostility in the Austrian Alps, and absolutely no evidence exists that the publication of his Malleus started any chain of trials anywhere in the Empire.", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", p. 19 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; while elsewhere in Europe only the first wave of the new witch trials was experienced in the latter half of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;"In Switzerland, the rustic 'forest cantons' of the original Confederation apparently remained unaffected by witch trials until after 1560.", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", p. 19 (2004).
"the first known witch-hunt in the kingdom of France began in the northern Pyrenees in the spring of 1562", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", p. 21 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magic and witchcraft ===
{{further|European witchcraft|Christian views on magic|Medieval magic|Renaissance magic|Shamanism in Europe}}
[[File:Witches'Familiars1579.jpg|thumb|A late-sixteenth-century illustration of a witch feeding her familiars from England. A number of historians believe that the familiar spirit is a pre-Christian idea.]]
Early Modern Europe and its North American colonies were replete with a belief in the reality of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[witchcraft]]. Belief in the witch, an individual who practiced malevolent magic, was not new to Modern Europe.{{sfnm|1a1=Scarre|1a2=Callow|1y=2001|1p=11|2a1=Thurston|2y=2001|2p=15}} Witches had appeared both in literature &amp;ndash; most prominently with the character of [[Circe]] in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' &amp;ndash; and in reality, with many individuals writing [[curse]]s on leaden tablets across the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=11}} In parts of Early Medieval Europe there was a widespread and long-lasting belief in witches who rode out with a goddess, varyingly known as [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Herodias]], [[Holda]], or [[Perchta]]; in the ''[[Canon Episcopi]]'', the Roman Catholic Church maintained that cavalcade did not really happen, and that instead it was an erroneous superstition caused by the Devil.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=12}}

Many Early Modern communities contained professional or semi-professional practitioners of [[folk magic]]; in England they were known as "[[cunning folk]]" although other terms were used elsewhere. They were believed to be able to cure disease, counter malevolent sorcery, identify enemies, foretell the future, and locate treasure and lost property, and would offer their services in these areas for a fee.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=86|2a1=Scarre|2a2=Callow|2y=2001|2p=6|3a1=Davies|3y=2003|3pp=103–109}} In contrast to this low magic was the high magic practiced by learned men of the [[Renaissance]]. Advocated by the likes of [[Marsilio Ficino]] and [[Pico della Mirandola]], this Renaissance high magic was influenced by ancient philosophies like [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Hermeticism]] and was theoretically complex, seeing the practice of magic as part of a wider spiritual system.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|pp=8-10}}

Historians like [[Carlo Ginzburg]] and [[Éva Pócs]] have suggested that various beliefs pertaining to magic and witchcraft in Early Modern Europe represented a survival of [[shamanism|shamanistic]] pre-Christian beliefs about visionary journeys.{{sfnm|1a1=Ginzburg|1y=1990|2a1=Pócs|2y=1999}} For instance, [[Emma Wilby]] has argued that the Early Modern accounts of [[familiar spirit]]s represent a survival of pre-Christian animism,{{sfn|Wilby|2005|p=61}} and has drawn comparisons between alleged witches' Sabbath journeys and the spirit-visions found in [[ethnography|ethnographically]]-recorded shamanic societies in Siberia and North America.{{sfn|Wilby|2005|pp=84-91}}

===The Devil===
[[File:CompendiumMaleficarumEngraving15.jpg|thumb|''The Obscene Kiss'', an illustration of witches kissing the Devil's anus from [[Francesco Maria Guazzo]]'s ''Compendium Maleficarum'' (1608).]]
It was also during the Medieval period that the concept of [[Satan]], the Biblical [[Devil]], began to develop into a more threatening form in the minds of people than earlier. Around the year 1000, when there were increasing fears that the end of the world would soon come in Christendom, the idea of the Devil had become prominent, with many believing that his activities on Earth would soon begin appearing. Whilst in earlier centuries there had been no set depiction of the Devil, it was also around this time that he began to develop the stereotypical image of being animal-like, or even in some cases an animal himself. In particular, he was often viewed as a goat, or as a human with goat-like features, such as horns, hooves and a tail. Equally, the concepts of [[demons]] began to become more prominent, in particular the idea that male demons known as [[incubi]], and female ones known as [[succubi]], would roam the Earth and have sexual intercourse with humans. As Thurston noted, "By about 1200, it would have been difficult to be a Christian and not frequently hear of the devil&amp;nbsp; ... [and] by 1500 scenes of the devil were commonplace in the new cathedrals and small parish churches that had sprung up in many regions."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The field of [[demonology]] had emerged in Medieval Christendom as certain members of the clergy began to focus in particular on the actions of demons in the world.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|pp=12-15}}

In the 14th and 15th centuries, the concept of the witch in Christendom underwent a relatively radical change. No longer were they viewed as sorcerers who had been deceived by the Devil into practicing magic that went against the powers of God, as earlier Church leaders like [[Saint Augustine of Hippo]] had stated{{citation needed|reason=Where did he say it?|date=December 2016}}. Instead, they became the all-out malevolent Devil-worshiper, who had made a pact with him in which they had to renounce [[Christianity]] and devote themselves to Satanism. As a part of this, they gained new, supernatural powers that enabled them to work [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], which they would use against Christians. It was believed that they would fly to their nocturnal meetings, known as the [[Witches' Sabbath]], where they would have sexual intercourse with demons. On their death, the witches' souls, which then belonged to the Devil, subsequently went to [[Hell]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many educated Christians in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, including theologians and judges, there was a great concern about the idea that witches were in league with the Devil.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|pp=6-7}} Conversely, it appears that the idea of the witch as Satanist was far less prevalent among the peasantry and popular classes, who were far more concerned about the potential harm that they could receive from witches than from where the witches gained their magical power.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=7}}

== History ==

=== Medieval prosecution of heresy ===
{{main|Medieval Inquisition}}
While the witch trials only really began in the 15th century, with the start of the [[early modern period]], many of their causes{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} had been developing during the previous centuries, with the prosecution of [[heresy]] by the [[Medieval Inquisition]] during the late twelfth and the thirteenth centuries, and during the [[Late Medieval period]], during which the idea of witchcraft or sorcery gradually changed and adapted. The inquisition had the office of protecting Christians against the "internal" threat of [[heresy]] (as opposed to "external" military threats such as those of the [[Viking invasions|Vikings]], the [[Mongol invasions|Mongols]], and the [[Islamic conquests|Saracens]] or [[growth of the Ottoman Empire|Turks]]).

[[File:Baldung Hexen 1508 kol.JPG|thumb|upright|''Witches'' by [[Hans Baldung Grien]] (Woodcut, 1508)]]

During the [[High Middle Ages]], a number of heretical Christian groups, such as the [[Cathars]] and the [[Knights Templar]] had been accused of performing such anti-Christian activities as Satanism, [[sodomy]] and malevolent sorcery in France. While the nucleus of the early modern "witch craze" would turn out to be popular superstition in the [[Western Alps]], reinforced by theological rationale developed at or following the [[Council of Basel]] of the 1430s, what has been called "the first real witch trial in Europe,"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; the accusation of [[Alice Kyteler]] in 1324, occurred in [[History of Ireland (1169–1536)|14th-century Ireland]], during the turmoils associated with the decline of [[Hiberno-Normans|Norman control]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. pp. 73–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thurston (2001) speaks of a shift in Christian society from a "relatively open and tolerant" attitude to that of a "persecuting society" taking an aggressive stance towards minorities characterized as [[Jews]], [[heretics]] (such as [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]]), [[lepers]] or [[homosexuals]], often associated with [[conspiracy theories]] assuming a concerted effort on the part of diabolical forces to weaken and destroy Christianity, indeed "the idea became popular that one or more vast conspiracies were trying to destroy Christianity from within."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. pp. 16–18, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; An important turning-point was the [[Black Death]] of 1348–1350, which killed a large percentage of the European population, and which many Christians believed had been caused by their enemies. The catalog of typical charges that would later be leveled at witches, of spreading diseases, committing orgies (sometimes [[incest]]uous), [[Blood libel|cannibalizing children]], and following [[Satanism]], emerged during the 14th century as crimes attributed to heretics and Jews.

Witchcraft had not been considered a heresy during the High Medieval period. Indeed, since the [[Council of Paderborn]] of 785, the belief in the possibility of witchcraft itself was considered heretical. While witch-hunts only became common after 1400, an important legal step that would make this development possible occurred in 1326, when [[Pope John XXII]] authorized the [[medieval Inquisition|inquisition]] to prosecute witchcraft as a type of heresy.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Jeffrey Burton. ''A History of Medieval Christianity'', p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] sentiment prevalent in the Medieval era would also influence the later witch trials, with the alleged witches' meetings being termed "sabbaths" and "synagogues".{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=19}}

The historian [[Richard Kieckhefer]] suggested that the late medieval trials "paved the way for more dramatic prosecutions to come".{{sfn|Kieckhefer|2000|p=193}} There had been a growth in the number of sorcery trials in Europe during the fourteenth century.{{sfn|Kieckhefer|2000|p=194}} Kieckhefer noted that the trials of the fifteenth century were "different in kind from most of the preceding cases."{{sfn|Kieckhefer|2000|p=194}} As historians Geoffrey Scarre and John Callow highlighted, the trials of demonic witches was "an early modern and not a medieval phenomenon".{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=22}}

By the late 14th century, a number of "witch hunters" began to publish books on the topic, including [[Nicholas Eymeric]], the inquisitor in [[Aragon]] and [[Avignon]], who published the ''[[Directorium Inquisitorum]]'' in 1376.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beginning of the witch hunts during the 15th century ===
The earliest known witch trials in which the accused were associated with the fully developed stereotype of the demonic witch was in the [[Valais witch trials]] of 1428, which took place in communities of the [[Western Alps]], in what were at the time [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cohn|1y=1975|1p=225|2a1=Kieckhefer|2y=2000|2pp=198–199|3a1=Scarre|3a2=Callow|3y=2001|3p=18}} Here, the cause of eliminating the supposed Satanic witches from society was taken up by a number of individuals; Claude Tholosan for instance had tried over two hundred people accusing them of witchcraft in [[Briançon]], [[Dauphiné]] by 1420.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schiltach Flugblatt.JPG|thumb|left|upright|1533 account of the execution of a witch charged with burning the [[Germany|German]] town of [[Schiltach]] in 1531]]

Soon, the idea of identifying and prosecuting witches spread throughout the neighboring areas of northern Italy, Switzerland and southern Germany, and it was at [[Basel]] that the [[Council of Basel]] assembled from 1431 to 1437. This Church Council, which had been attended by such anti-witchcraft figures as [[Johann Nider]] and [[Martin Le Franc]], helped to standardize the stereotype of the Satanic witch that would be propagated throughout the rest of the trials.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Men who had been at the Council of Basel went on to spread the ideas regarding demonic witchcraft throughout other parts of Europe in the ensuing years.{{sfn|Thurston|2001|p=78}}

The development of the printing press allowed for a number of books to be published which outlined the existence of demonic witchcraft and described how to deal with it; circulating throughout the literate sectors of Western Europe, they stimulated increased interest in the subject and advocated a coherent intellectual response to it. Works published in this vein included [[Johannes Nider]]'s ''[[Formicarius]]'' (c.1435), the ''[[Errores Gazariorum]]'' (c.1450), [[Nicholas Jacquier]]'s ''Flagellum Haereticorum Fascinariorum'' (1450s), [[Ulrich Molitor]]'s ''De Lamiis'' (1489), and most famously [[Heinrich Kramer]]'s ''[[Malleus Malificarum]]'' (''The Hammer of the Witches,'' 1487).{{sfnm|1a1=Scarre|1a2=Callow|1y=2001|1p=20|2a1=Thurston|2y=2001|2p=78}} At the same time, printing allowed fictional stories about witches and magicians to be spread throughout the continent, such as the tales of [[Doctor Faustus (play)|Dr Faustus]], thereby reinforcing the belief in malevolent practitioners of magic who interacted with the Devil and his demons.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|pp=20-21}}

On December 5, 1484, Pope Innocent VIII issued the ''[[Summis desiderantes affectibus]]'', a [[papal bull]] in which he recognized the existence of witches and gave full papal approval for the [[inquisition]] to move against witches. In the bull, which is sometimes referred to as the "Witch-Bull of 1484", the witches were explicitly accused of having "slain infants yet in the mother's womb" (abortion) and of "hindering men from performing the sexual act and women from conceiving" (contraception{{Dubious|date=September 2013}}).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080523174317/http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00e.html ''The Bull of Innocent VIII''] as published in the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' translated by [[Montague Summers]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the main period of witch hunts, men and women were equally accused of witchcraft and their social status was not as important as it would become. By the time of the hunts, 4 out of every 5 victims were women (usually lower class and elderly) in places like England, with that number being reported jumping up to as high as 90% in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoak |first=Dale |title=The Great European Witch-Hunts: A Historical Perspective |journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume=88 |issue=6 |year=1983 |pages=1270–1274 |doi=10.1086/227806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While men did make up a sizable minority of those accused, some scholars have pointed out that many of the men accused were related to women who had already been accused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mencej |first=Mirjam |title=The Role of Gender in Accusations of Witchcraft: The Case of Eastern Slovenia |journal=Český Lid. |volume=98 |issue=4 |year=2011 |pages=393–412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The height of the European trials was between 1560 and 1630, with the large hunts first beginning in 1609.&lt;ref name="Thurston 2001 Page 79"/&gt; During this period, the biggest witch trials were held in Europe, notably the [[Trier witch trials]] (1581–1593), the [[Fulda witch trials]] (1603–1606), the [[Basque witch trials]] (1609-1611), the [[Würzburg witch trial]] (1626–1631) and the [[Bamberg witch trials]] (1626–1631).

In 1590, the [[North Berwick witch trials]] occurred in Scotland, and were of particular note as the king, [[James I of England|James VI]], became involved himself. James had developed a fear that witches planned to kill him after he suffered from storms whilst traveling to Denmark in order to claim his bride, [[Anne of Denmark|Anne]], earlier that year. Returning to Scotland, the king heard of trials that were occurring in [[North Berwick]] and ordered the suspects to be brought to him—he subsequently believed that a nobleman, [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell]], was a witch, and after the latter fled in fear of his life, he was outlawed as a traitor. The king subsequently set up royal commissions to hunt down witches in his realm, recommending torture in dealing with suspects, and in 1597 he wrote a book about the menace that witches posed to society entitled ''[[Daemonologie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]], pp. 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary Foxcroft in 2014 had an article appear in the World Policy Journal suggesting that a minor change King James made to the Bible justified "horrific human rights violations and fuel[ed] the epidemic of witchcraft accusations and persecution across the globe.".&lt;ref&gt;Foxcroft, Gary. "Hunting Witches." World Policy Journal 31, 1. 90-98 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The change involved changing Exodus 22:18 from "do not suffer a poisoner to live" to "do not suffer a witch to live." The veracity of this claim has been questioned.{{by whom|date=May 2017}} A translation that dates before that of the King James version contradicts Foxcroft's claim. The Geneva Bible which precedes the King James version by 51 years includes the term "witch" in Exodus 22:18 ("Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.")&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+22%3A18&amp;version=GNV&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decline of the trials: 1650–1750 ===

{{further|Protests against early modern witch trials}}
Even throughout the 16th century, there had been isolated expressions of scepticism regarding the trial, increasing throughout the 17th century. In 1635, the [[Roman Inquisition]] acknowledged that it had "found scarcely one trial conducted legally".&lt;ref&gt;"even the Roman Inquisition recognized that abuses were common; in 1635 it admitted that "the Inquisition has found scarcely one trial conducted legally."", Midelfort, "Witch hunting in southwestern Germany, 1562-1684: the social and intellectual foundations", p. 28 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the 17th century, the difficulty in proving witchcraft according to legal process contributed to the councilors of [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber|Rothenburg]] (German), following advice to treat witchcraft cases with caution.&lt;ref&gt;"Doubts about their ability to prove witches unequivocally guilty according to due legal procedure, fears that they would invoke God's wrath against themselves and their subjects if they overstepped its bounds, and a certain humility in thinking that witchcraft was a matter best left up to God, all played a part in encouraging the Rothenburg councillors and their advisers to handle witchcraft cases with caution.", Rowlands, 'Witchcraft narratives in Germany: Rothenburg 1561-1652', p. 59 (2003).
"Compelling legal reasons almost always also existed in specific cases to discourage the councillors and their advisers from taking action against sabbat-attenders.", Rowlands, 'Witchcraft narratives in Germany: Rothenburg 1561-1652', p. 57 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the witch trials had begun to fade out across much of Europe by the mid-17th century, they continued on the fringes of Europe and in the American Colonies. In the Nordic countries, the late 17th century saw the peak of the trials in a number of areas: the [[Torsåker witch trials]] of [[Swedish Empire|Sweden (1674)]], where 71 people were executed for witchcraft in a single day, the peak of witch hunting in Swedish Finland,&lt;ref name="Thurston 2001 Page 79"/&gt; and the [[Salzburg witch trials]] in Austria (where 139 people were executed from 1675–1690).

The 1692 [[Salem witch trials]] were a brief outburst of witch hysteria in the New World while the practice was waning in Europe. In the 1690s Winifred King Benham and her daughter Winifred were thrice tried for witchcraft in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]], the last of such trials in New England. While found innocent, they were compelled to leave Wallingford to settle in [[Staten Island, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;http://alicemariebeard.com/history/witch.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1706 [[Grace Sherwood]] of [[Virginia]] was tried by ducking and jailed for allegedly being a witch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|ref={{sfnRef|USA Today|2006}}|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-07-09-witch-pungo_x.htm|title=Va. Woman Seeks To Clear Witch of Pungo|date=July 9, 2006|work=USA Today|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th century witnessed increased urbanization and technological development in Europe, giving European Early Modern society an increased belief in its own abilities to fashion the world and leading to the decrease in the belief of invisible forces affecting humanity.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=65}} Belief that Satan interfered in human affairs directly was also waning{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=71}} and the belief in demons became rare among the educated elites, thus the belief in demonic witchcraft eroded with it.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=66}} Rationalist skeptics of the trials came to the opinion that the use of torture had resulted in erroneous testimony.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|pp=69-70}}

In France, scholars have found that with increased fiscal capacity and a stronger central government, the witchcraft accusations began to decline.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Noel D. and Mark Koyama, "Taxes, Lawyers, and the Decline of Witch Trials in France," The Journal of Law and Economics 57, no. 1 (February 2014): 77-112&lt;/ref&gt; The witch trials that occurred there were symptomatic of a weak legal system and "witches were most likely to be tried and convicted in regions where magistrates departed from established legal statutes." &lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Koyama, ""Taxes, Lawyers, and the Decline of Witch Trials in France," 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 18th century, the practice subsided. [[Jane Wenham (alleged witch)|Jane Wenham]] was among the last subjects of a typical witch trial in England in 1712, but was pardoned after her conviction and set free. The last execution for witchcraft in England took place in 1716, when Mary Hicks and her daughter Elizabeth were hanged. [[Janet Horne]] was executed for witchcraft in Scotland in 1727. The [[Witchcraft Act 1735]] put an end of the traditional form of witchcraft as a legal offense in Britain. Those accused under the new act were restricted to those that pretended to be able to conjure spirits (generally being the most dubious professional fortune tellers and mediums), and punishment was light.&lt;ref&gt;9 Geo. 2, c. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Austria, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] outlawed witch-burning and torture in the late 18th century (the last capital trial, that of [[Maria Pauer]] occurred in 1750 in Salzburg, which was then outside the Austrian domain).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFloAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA434&amp;dq=Austria%20Maria%20Theresa%20%20witch&amp;pg=PA434#v=onepage&amp;q=Austria%20Maria%20Theresa%20%20witch&amp;f=false|title=The Oxford Handbook of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America|last=Levack|first=Brian P.|date=2013-03-28|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191648830|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sporadic witch-hunts after 1750 ===
While the educated elites had largely abandoned their belief in the reality of witchcraft, this belief remained widespread in popular culture.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=63}} From this point on, it was very rare for an accused witch to undergo a judicial process and be threatened with execution, but there was still a danger from popular justice and [[Lynching|lynch mob]]s.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=63}} The death of [[Ruth Osborne (alleged witch)|Ruth Osborne]] is an example of one such case that occurred in 1751. The last person in Germany to be executed for witchcraft was fifteen-year-old [http://www.executedtoday.com/2015/04/02/1756-veronika-zeritschin-the-last-witch-executed-in-germany/ Veronika Zeritschin], who was beheaded and then burned on April 2, 1756 in Landshut.

In the later 18th century, witchcraft had ceased to be considered a criminal offense throughout Europe, but there are a number of cases which were not technically witch trials but are suspected to have involved belief in witches at least behind the scenes. Thus, in 1782, [[Anna Göldi]] was executed in [[Glarus]], [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]], officially for the killing of her infant – a ruling at the time widely denounced throughout Switzerland and Germany as [[judicial murder]]. Like Anna Göldi, [[Barbara Zdunk]] was executed in 1811 in [[Prussia]] not technically for witchcraft but for arson.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} In Poland, the [[Doruchów witch trial]] occurred in 1783 and the execution of two additional women for sorcery in 1793, tried by a legal court but with dubious legitimacy.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Despite the official ending of the trials for Satanic witchcraft, there would still be occasional unofficial killings of those accused in parts of Europe, such as was seen in the cases of [[Anna Klemens]] in Denmark (1800), [[Krystyna Ceynowa]] in Poland (1836), and [[Dummy, the Witch of Sible Hedingham]] in England (1863). In France, there was sporadic violence and even murder in the 1830s, with one woman reportedly burnt in a village square in [[Nord (French department)|Nord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Tombs|title=France 1814–1914|publisher=[[Longman]]|year=1996|isbn=0-582-49314-5|page=245|chapter=Collective Identities: Community and Religion|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1830s a prosecution for witchcraft was commenced against a man in Fentress County, Tennessee named either Joseph or William Stout, based upon his alleged influence over the health of a young woman. The case against the supposed witch was dismissed upon the failure of the alleged victim, who had sworn out a warrant against him, to appear for the trial. However, some of his other accusers were convicted on criminal charges for their part in the matter, and various libel actions were brought.&lt;ref name="topix.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Touring the East Tennessee Back-roads By Carolyn Sakowski, p. 212.(https://books.google.com/books?id=rLBrUbj02IcC&amp;pg=PA212)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, [[Bridget Cleary]] was beaten and burned to death by her husband in Ireland because he suspected that fairies had taken the real Bridget and replaced her with a witch.

The persecution of those believed to perform malevolent sorcery against their neighbors continued into the 20th century. In 1997 two Russian farmers killed a woman and injured five other members of her family after believing that they had used [[folk magic]] against them.&lt;ref name="Thurston 2001 Page 79"/&gt; It has been reported that more than 3,000 people were killed by lynch mobs in Tanzania between 2005 and 2011 for allegedly being witches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= 3,000 Lynched In Tanzania For 'Witchcraft' In Past Six Years |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/29/tanzania-witchcraft-3000-lynchings-witches_n_1553448.html|newspaper= Huffington Post |location= |date= 29 May 2012 |access-date= 23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trials ==
[[File:Matteson Examination of a Witch.jpg|thumb|''Examination of a Witch'' by [[T. H. Matteson]]]]

There were extensive efforts to root out the supposed influence of Satan by various measures aimed at the people who were accused of being servants of Satan. To a lesser degree, animals were also targeted for prosecution (see [[animal trial]]). People suspected of being "[[Demonic possession|possessed by Satan]]" were put on trial. On the other hand, the church also attempted to extirpate the superstitious belief in witchcraft and sorcery, considering it as fraud in most cases.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Most historians agree that the majority of those persecuted in these witch trials were innocent of any involvement in Devil worship.,{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=70}} casting doubt on the veracity of claims made by many historians working in the field.
Geoffrey Scarre and John Callow erroneously thought it "without doubt" that some of those accused in the trials had been guilty of employing magic in an attempt to harm their enemies, and were thus genuinely guilty of witchcraft.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=2}}

Most of the trials were not motivated by stupidity or a love of violence, but of a belief that it was the morally appropriate course of action for people to take; while some of those carrying out the trials appeared to exhibit [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadism]], most appear to have acted "from a spirit of duty and a concern for the public welfare."{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=73}}
Scarre and Callow described the trials as "a frightning example of how morally motivated action can lead to massive suffering".{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=74}} Lecky argues there was a large amount of impartial evidence demonstrating the existence of witchcraft and that views only changed when the concept of evil spirits came under skepticism in general.&lt;ref&gt;Lecky, William Hartpole. [https://archive.org/stream/historyofriseinf00leck#page/38/mode/1up History of the rise and influence of the spirit of rationalism in Europe] Vol. I (1884) pp. 38-40&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regional differences ===
There were many regional differences in the manner in which the witch trials occurred. The trials themselves emerged sporadically, flaring up in some areas while neighbouring areas remained largely unaffected.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=22}} In general, homogeneously Catholic states, such as [[Spain]] and [[Italy]], remained largely unaffected, while religiously divided countries like the [[Holy Roman Empire]] or [[France]] were more affected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomas-hardye.dorset.sch.uk/documents/news_12/dan_horn.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the areas that witnessed the largest number of panics, trials, and executions were the German-language of the Holy Roman Empire. Nevertheless, there were regional variations here, with relatively few executions in southern [[Bavaria]] and the [[Lower Rhine]] area.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=23}}
On the whole the trials were less severe in neighbouring France, although there was regional variation domestically, with the [[Pyrenees]], [[Languedoc]], the [[Alps]] and the North East being particularly heavily affected by the trials. There were also large trials in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] and [[Franche-Comté]], although these regions would only be permanently annexed by France after 1660.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=24}} The situation differed in Southern Europe, with few trials taking place in either Spain or Italy. When they did occur in these nations, it was in the northern regions such as Spain's [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]; being close to neighbouring countries, these areas were more open to foreign influences and had a weaker central authority.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=25}}

There was much regional variation within the [[British Isles]]. In Ireland, there were few trials, and those that did take place lacked the demonic elements present elsewhere on the continent.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=26}} Similarly, the trials in England were atypical of Europe as a whole, for the emphasis of the charges was normally on the practice of malevolent magic rather than contact with the Devil, while the concept of witches' familiars played a key role, which was conversely largely absent from the continental trial accounts.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|pp=26–28}} North of the border, in Scotland, witch trials were far more numerous and resulted in far more executions than in England, having far more in common with the trials of France and Germany.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=28}} Among the British settlements in [[New England]], witch trials were very rare and not a feature of typical Early Modern life.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=28}}

[[File:Bamberger Malefizhaus 1627 Staatsbiblithek Bamberg.jpg|thumb|left|The ''malefizhaus'' of Bamberg, Germany, where suspected witches were held and interrogated: 1627 engraving]]

A country's government and legal system often made a major difference. England, for instance, had and has a long history of strong [[judicial]] centralization and therefore regulations prevented easy convictions, except for periods such as the [[English Civil War]] and the periods of [[Matthew Hopkins#Witch-hunting|Witch-hunting]]; Scotland, on the other hand, lacked the strong [[central government]] that England had and authorities had greater trouble controlling local justice or even contributed to the problem. During the time of the Witch Hunts, Germany was a patchwork of more than [[Unification of Germany|300 autonomous territories]] and was highly decentralized politically, therefore making Germany highly vulnerable to massive witch hunts that spun out of control in the absence of judicial regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levack |first=Brain P. |authorlink=Brian P. Levack |title=The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe |location=London |publisher=Longman |edition=2nd |year=1995 |pages=98–102 |isbn=0-582-08069-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are particularly important differences between the English and continental witch-hunting traditions. The checks and balances inherent in the English jury system, which required a 23-strong body (the grand jury) to indict and a 12-strong one (the petit jury) to convict, always had a restraining effect on prosecutions. Another restraining influence was its relatively rare use of torture: the country formally permitted it only when authorized by the monarch, and no more than 81 torture warrants were issued (for all offenses) throughout English history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John H. |last=Langbein |authorlink=John H. Langbein |title=Torture and the Law of Proof |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1977 |pages=81 ff. |isbn=0-226-46806-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Continental European courts, while varying from region to region, tended to concentrate power in individual judges and place far more reliance on torture. The significance of the institutional difference is most clearly established by a comparison of the witch-hunts of England and Scotland, for the death toll inflicted by the courts north of the border always dwarfed that of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levack |first=Brain P. |title=The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe |location=London |publisher=Longman |edition=2nd |year=1995 |page=202 |isbn=0-582-08069-X }} See also {{cite book |first=Christina |last=Larner |title=Enemies of God: The Witch-hunt in Scotland |location=London |publisher=Chatto and Windus |year=1981 |pages=62–3 |isbn=0-7011-2424-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also apparent from an episode of English history during the early 1640s, when the Civil War resulted in the suspension of jury courts for three years. Several freelance witch-hunters emerged during this period, the most notorious of whom was [[Matthew Hopkins]], who emerged from [[East Anglia]] and proclaimed himself "Witchfinder General".&lt;ref&gt;A detailed account of Hopkins and his fellow witchfinder [[John Stearne (witch-hunter)|John Stearne]] can be found in {{cite book |first=Malcolm |last=Gaskill |title=Witchfinders: A Seventeenth Century English Tragedy |location= |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-674-01976-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy saw much less witchcraft accusation, and even fewer cases where witch trials ended in execution. In 1542, the establishment of the Roman Inquisition effectively retrained secular courts under its influence from liberal application of torture and execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deutscher |first=Thomas |title=The Role of The Episcopal Tribunal of Novara in The Suppression of Heresy and Witchcraft 1563–1615 |journal=Catholic Historical Review |volume=77 |year=1991 |issue=3 |pages=403–421 |jstor=25023586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodological Instructio, which served as an "appropriate" manual for witch hunting, cautioned against hasty convictions and careless executions of the accused. In contrast with other parts of Europe, trials the Venetian Holy Office never saw conviction for the crime of malevolent witchcraft, or "maleficio".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seitz |first=Jonathan |title='The Root is Hidden and the Material Uncertain': The Challenges of Persecuting Witchcraft in Early Modern Venice |journal=[[Renaissance Quarterly]] |volume=62 |year=2009 |issue=1 |pages=102–129 |doi=10.1086/598373 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the notion of diabolical cults was not credible to neither popular culture nor inquisitorial theology, mass accusations and belief in Witches' Sabbath never took root in areas under inquisitorial influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Black |first=Christopher F. |title=The Italian Inquisition |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-300-11706-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain also had a tighter grip on is governmental institutions and thus saw far less convictions in witchcraft.  [[Rodney Stark]] notes the Inquisition in Spain gained a strong hold to combat the mob mentality regarding the prosecution of witches and to provided fair trials for those accused.&lt;ref name="Stark, Rodney 2003. pg 204"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stark |first=Rodney |title=For The Glory Of God: How Monotheism Led to Reformations, Science, Witch-hunts, and the End of Slavery |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2003 |page=204 |isbn=0-691-11436-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brian Levack also notes that even during the high point of the witch hunts in Spain, only eleven of the nineteen hundred accused of witchcraft were condemned.  Levack also notes of those nineteen hundred accused, most were never formally charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levack |first=Brain P. |title=The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe |location=London |publisher=Longman |edition=2nd |year=1995 |page=92 |isbn=0-582-08069-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stark also points at that the Inquisition in Spain was often more lenient than secular courts and would often step in to reverse their convictions.  Stark also noted that in Spain the punishment for a first-time offenses were often light, if any at all.  Oftentimes, the Inquisitors would just have the offender reconcile with the Church.  It was only if this reconciliation was refused was the "witch" sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="Stark, Rodney 2003. pg 204"/&gt;

Because The Holy Office viewed witchcraft as a theological violation toward Catholic doctrines, torture was used sparingly, with the purpose of making subjects renounce their errors and thus be reintegrated back into Catholic society.&lt;ref name="Kallestrup, Louise N. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kallestrup |first=Louise N. |title=Lay and Inquisitorial Witchcraft Prosecution Prosecutions in Early Modern Italy and Denmark |journal=Scandinavian Journal of History |volume=36 |issue=3 |year=2011 |pages=265–278 |doi=10.1080/03468755.2011.580130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means there was much less potential to name other associates, thus decreasing the chance of mass accusation.&lt;ref name="Kallestrup, Louise N. 2011"/&gt;

===Identity of the accused===
The majority of those accused were from the lower economic classes in European society, although, in times of severe panic, wealthier and high ranking individuals were accused as well, including priests, judges and, in very rare cases, members of the nobility.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|pp=31-32}}
On the basis of this evidence, Scarre and Callow asserted that the "typical witch was the wife or widow of an agricultural labourer or small tenant farmer, and she was well known for a quarrelsome and aggressive nature."{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=31}}

In various instances, it was men rather than women who constituted the majority of the accused.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=29}} For instance, in Iceland 92% of the accused were men,&lt;ref name="GibbonsRecent" /&gt; and in Estonia 60% of the accused victims were male, mainly middle-aged or elderly married peasants, and known healers or sorcerers.&lt;ref&gt;Madar, Maia. ''Estonia I: Werewolves and Poisoners''. pp. 257–272&lt;/ref&gt; In the witch trials of Moscow, Russia, two-thirds of those accused were male.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|pp=29-30}}

Although it was far more common for them to be accusers rather than accused, children were sometimes put on trial for witchcraft.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|pp=32-33}} For instance, during the [[Würzburg witch trial|Würzburg trials of 1629]], children made up 60% of those accused, although this had reduced to 17% by the end of the year.{{sfnm|1a1=Midelfort|1y=1972|1p=182|2a1=Scarre|2a2=Callow|2y=2001|2p=33}} Several decades later, in the late 1660s, children in [[Mora witch trial|Mora, Sweden]] publicly claimed that adults had taken them to the witches' Sabbath. As a result, fifteen boys over the age of 16 were executed, while forty younger children were whipped.{{sfnm|1a1=Caro Baroja|1y=2001|1pp=207-208|2a1=Scarre|2a2=Callow|2y=2001|2p=33}}

=== Interrogation and torture ===

Various acts of [[torture]] were used against accused witches to coerce confessions and cause them to name their co-conspirators. The torture of witches began to increase in frequency after 1468 when the Pope declared witchcraft to be "crimen exceptum" and thereby removed all legal limits on the application of torture in cases where evidence was difficult to find.&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Trevor-Roper, ''The European Witch-Craze of The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries and Other Essays,'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1969), 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, an accused witch was deprived of sleep for periods up to forty hours. This technique was also used in England, but without a limitation on time.&lt;ref name="Naish p27"&gt;Camille Naish, ''Death Comes to the Maiden: Sex and Execution 1431–1933'' (London: Routledge, 1991), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual humiliation was used, such as forced sitting on red-hot stools with the claim that the accused woman would not perform sexual acts with the devil.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Charles Lea, ''Witchcraft'', p. 236 as quoted in Camille Naish, ''Death Comes to the Maiden: Sex and Execution 1431–1933'' (London: Routledge, 1991), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, those who endured the torture without confessing were released.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=32}}

The use of torture has been identified as a key factor in converting the trial of one accused witch into a wider [[social panic]], as those being tortured were more likely to accuse a wide array of other local individuals of also being witches.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=32}}

===Punishment and executions===

[[File:Wickiana5.jpg|thumb|''Burning of three witches in [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]], Switzerland'' (1585), by [[Johann Jakob Wick]]]]
[[File:The burning of Louisa Mabree, the French midwife in a cage f Wellcome V0041811.jpg|thumb|The burning of a French midwife in a cage filled with black cats]]
A variety of different punishments were employed for those found guilty of witchcraft, including imprisonment, flogging, fines, or exile.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=34}}
The [[Old Testament]]'s book of [[Exodus 22:18|Exodus (22:18)]] states, "Thou shalt not permit a sorceress to live".{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=12}} Many faced [[capital punishment]] for witchcraft, either by burning at the stake, hanging, or beheading.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|pp=1, 21}} Similarly, in New England, people convicted of witchcraft were hanged.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Stuart England'', edited by Ronald H. Fritze and William B. Robison. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-313-28391-8}}. (p.552).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Number of executions ====
The scholarly consensus on the total number of executions for witchcraft ranges from 40,000-60,000&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hutton|2010|p=247}}.
Scarre and Callow (2001) put forward 40,000 as an estimate for the number killed.{{harv|Scarre|Callow|2001|pp=1, 21}} 
Levack (2006)  came to an estimate of 45,000. Levack, Brian (2006). ''The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe'' Third Edition. Longman. Page 23. 
Hutton (2010) estimated that the numbers were between 40,000&amp;ndash;50,000,{{harv|Hutton|2010|p=247}} 
Wolfgang Behringer and Lyndal Roper had independently calculated the number as being between 50,000&amp;ndash;60,000.({{harvnb|Behringer|2004|p=149}}; {{harvnb|Roper|2004|pp=6&amp;ndash;7}})
In an earlier unpublished essay, Hutton counted local estimates, and in areas where estimates were unavailable attempted to extrapolate from nearby regions with similar demographics and attitudes towards witch hunting.  {{cite web | url=http://www.summerlands.com/crossroads/remembrance/current.htm |title= Estimates of Executions  (based on Hutton's essay 'Counting the Witch Hunt')}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; (not including unofficial lynchings of accused witches, which went unrecorded but are nevertheless believed to have been somewhat rare in the Early Modern period).{{sfnm|1a1=Scarre|1a2=Callow|1y=2001|1p=21|2a1=Hutton|2y=2010|2p=248}} 
It would also have been the case that various individuals would have died as a result of the unsanitary conditions of their imprisonment, but again this is not recorded within the number of executions.{{sfnm|1a1=Scarre|1a2=Callow|1y=2001|1p=34|2a1=Hutton|2y=2010|2p=248}}

Attempts at estimating the total number of executions for witchcraft have a history going back to the end of the period of witch-hunts in the 18th century. A scholarly consensus only emerges in the second half of the 20th century, and  historical estimates vary wildly depending on the method used. Early estimates tend to be highly exaggerated, as they were still part of rhetorical arguments against the persecution of witches rather than purely historical scholarship. 
Notably, a figure of nine million victims was given by [[Gottfried Christian Voigt]] in 1784 in an argument criticizing [[Voltaire]]'s estimate of "several hundred thousand" as too low. Voigt's number has shown remarkably resilient as an influential [[Urban legend|popular myth]], surviving well into the 20th century, especially in [[Feminist interpretations of the Early Modern witch trials|feminist and neo-pagan literature]].&lt;ref&gt;
The history of the "nine million" estimate was researched by Wolfgang  Behringer: ''Neun Millionen Hexen. Enstehung, Tradition und Kritik eines populären Mythos'', in: Geschichte in Wissenschaft und Unterricht 49. 1987, pp. 664–685, extensive summary on [http://www.historicum.net/themen/hexenforschung/thementexte/rezeption/art/Neun_Millionen/html/ca/0e43e9dea3/]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 19th century, some scholars were agnostic, for instance [[Jacob Grimm]] (1844) talked of  "countless" victims&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Grimm|Grimm, Jacob]] (1883 [1844]). ''Teutonic Mythology'' Volume III. Page 1067.&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Charles Mackay (author)|Charles Mackay]] (1841) named "thousands upon thousands".&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Mackay (author)|Mackay, Charles]] (1841). ''Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions'' Volume II. Page 168.&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, a popular news report of 1832 cited a number of 392,000 victims "in Great Britain alone".&lt;ref&gt;'however incredible it may appear, the enormous sum of three thousand one hundred and ninety-two individuals were condemned and executed in Great Britain alone' {{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2208751 |title=WITCHCRAFT. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser|The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser (NSW : 1803 - 1842)]] |location=NSW |date=29 September 1832 |accessdate=30 September 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the early 20th century, some scholarly estimates on the  number of executions still ranged in the hundreds of thousands. The estimate was only reliably placed below  100,000 
in scholarship of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Cohn]] rejected estimates in the hundreds of thousands as "fantastic exaggerations". {{harvnb|Cohn|1975|p=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socio-political turmoil===
Various suggestions have been made that the witch trials emerged as a response to socio-political turmoil in the Early Modern world. One form of this is that the prosecution of witches was a reaction to a disaster that had befallen the community, such as crop-failure, war, or disease.{{sfnm|1a1=Scarre|1a2=Callow|1y=2001|1pp=41–42|2a1=Behringer|2y=2004|2p=88}} For instance, Midelfort suggested that in southwestern Germany, war and famine destabilised local communities, resulting in the witch prosecutions of the 1620s.{{sfn|Midelfort|1972}} Behringer also suggests an increase in witch prosecutions due to socio-political destabilization, stressing the Little Ice Age's effects on food shortages and the subsequent use of witches as scapegoats for consequences of climatic changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behringer|first=Wolfgang|date=1999|title=Climatic Change and Witch-Hunting: The Impact on The Little Ice Age on Mentalities|url=|journal=Climatic Change|volume=43|pages=335–351|via=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Little Ice Age, lasting from about 1300 to 1850,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Little Ice Age: How Climate Made History 1300-1850|last=Fagan|first=Brian|publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=47–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; is characterized by temperatures and precipitation levels lower than the 1901-1960 average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pfister |first=Christian|date=1999|title=Climatic Variability in Sixteenth-Century Europe and its Social Dimension: A Synthesis|url=|journal=Climatic Change |volume=43|pages=5–53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians such as Wolfgang Behringer, Emily Oster, and Hartmut Lehmann argue that these cooling temperatures brought about crop-failure, war, and disease, and that witches were subsequently blamed for this turmoil.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehmann |first=Hartmut |date=1988|title=The Persecution of Witches as Restoration of Order: The Case of Germany, 1590s-1650s|url=|journal=Central European History|volume=21|pages=107–121|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behringer|first=Wolfgang|date=1999|title=Climatic Change and Witch-Hunting: The Impact of The Little Ice Age on Mentalities|url=|journal=Climatic Change|volume=43|pages=335–351|via=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oster |first=Emily|date=2004 |title=Witchcraft, Weather, and Economic Growth in Renaissance Europe|url=|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=18|pages=215–228|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical temperature indexes and witch trials data indicate that, generally, as temperature decreased during this period, witch trials increased.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, the peaks of witchcraft persecutions overlap with hunger crises that occurred in 1570 and 1580, the latter lasting a decade.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Problematically for these theories, it has been highlighted that, in that region, the witch hunts declined during the 1630s, at a time when the communities living there were facing increased disaster as a result of plague, famine, economic collapse and the [[Thirty Years' War]].{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=42}} Furthermore, this scenario would clearly not offer a universal explanation, for trials also took place in areas which were free from war, famine, or pestilence.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=41}} Additionally, these theories - particularly Behringer's - have been labeled as oversimplified.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Witchcraft, Gender and Society in Early Modern Germany|last=Durrant|first=Jonathan|publisher=Brill|year=2007|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=15, 246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is evidence that the Little Ice Age and subsequent famine and disease was likely a contributing factor to increase in witch persecution, Durrant argues that one cannot make a direct link between these problems and witch persecutions in all contexts.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Moreover, the [[Western European marriage pattern|average age at first marriage]] had gradually risen by late sixteenth century; the population had stabilized after a period of growth and availability of jobs and land had lessened. In the last decades of the century the age at marriage had climbed to averages of 25 for women and 27 for men in England and the Low Countries as more people married later or remained unmarried due to lack of money or resources and a decline in living standards, and these averages remained high for nearly two centuries and averages across Northwestern Europe had done likewise.&lt;ref&gt;De Moor, Tine and Jan Luiten van Zanden. 2009. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00483.x/full Girl power: the European marriage pattern and labour markets in the North Sea region in the late medieval and early modern period]. Wiley Online Library. p 17&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nun#Protestantism|convents were closed]] during the [[Protestant Reformation]], which displaced many nuns. Many communities saw the proportion of unmarried women climb from less than 10% to 20% and in some cases as high as 30%, whom few communities knew how to accommodate economically.&lt;ref&gt;Levack, Brian P. (1995). The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe (Second Edition). London and New York: Longman. Pg. 156-157&lt;/ref&gt; Miguel (2003) argues that witch killings may be a process of eliminating the financial burdens of a family or society via elimination of the older women that need to be fed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miguel|first=Edward|date=2005|title=Poverty and Witch Killing|url=|journal=Review of Economic Studies|volume=72|pages=1153–1172|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an increase in unmarried women would enhance this process.

===Catholic versus Protestant conflict===
{{further|Counter-Reformation}}
The English historian [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] advocated the idea that the witch trials emerged as part of the conflicts between Roman Catholics and Protestants in Early Modern Europe.{{sfn|Trevor-Roper|1969}} This theory has however received little support from other experts in the subject.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=43}} This is because there is little evidence that either Roman Catholics were accusing Protestants of witchcraft, or that Protestants were accusing Roman Catholics.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=43}} Furthermore, the witch trials regularly occurred in regions with little or no inter-denominational strife, and which were largely religiously homogenous, such as [[Essex]], [[Lowland Scotland]], [[Geneva]], [[Venice]], and the Spanish Basque Country.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=44}} There is also some evidence, particularly from the Holy Roman Empire, in which adjacent Roman Catholic and Protestant territories were exchanging information on alleged local witches, viewing them as a common threat to both.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=44}} Additionally, many prosecutions were instigated not by the religious or secular authorities, but by popular demands from within the population, thus making it less likely that there were specific inter-denominational reasons behind the accusations.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|pp=44–45}}

In south-western Germany between 1561 and 1670 there were 480 witch trials. Of the 480 trials that took place in southwestern Germany, 317 occurred in Catholic areas, while Protestant territories accounted for 163 of them.{{sfn|Midelfort|1972|p=31}} During the period from 1561 to 1670, at least 3,229 persons were executed for witchcraft in the German Southwest. Of this number 702 were tried and executed in Protestant territories, while 2,527 were tried and executed in Catholic territories.{{sfn|Midelfort|1972|pp=31–32}}

A 2017 study in the ''[[The Economic Journal|Economic Journal]]'', examining "more than 43,000 people tried for witchcraft across 21 European countries over a period of five-and-a-half centuries", found that "more intense religious-market contestation led to more intense witch-trial activity. And, compared to religious-market contestation, the factors that existing hypotheses claim were important for witch-trial activity—weather, income, and state capacity—were not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leeson|first=Peter T.|last2=Russ|first2=Jacob W.|date=2017-03-01|title=Witch trials|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12498/abstract|journal=The Economic Journal|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/ecoj.12498|issn=1468-0297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functional explanations===
Inspired by ethnographically recorded witch trials that anthropologists observed happening in non-European parts of the world, various historians have sought a functional explanation for the Early Modern witch trials, thereby suggesting the social functions that the trials played within their communities.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=45}}
These studies have illustrated how accusations of witchcraft have played a role in releasing social tensions or in facilitating the termination of personal relationships that have become un-desirable to one party.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=45}}

Undertaking in-depth analysis of the social and cultural context of the English witch trials, Keith Thomas and Alan Macfarlene showed that the accused were unpopular, anti-social, and often aggressive, known for begging from their neighbours and verbally cursing those who turned them away. In this they provided an explicitly functionalist explanation of the trials, in that they were used to eliminate anti-social members of the community.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=46}}

===Class conflict===
Another theory is that the witch trials represented a method whereby the socio-economic elites used it as form of social control to consolidate their dominance over the poorer sections of the population.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|pp=49–50}}

Another theory, proposed by the prominent American anthropologist, [[Marvin Harris]], in his work ''Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches'' (1973), is that the witches were scapegoats victimized by the Church and secular lords to focus and divert public furor at a time of economic dislocation: "The practical significance of the witch mania therefore was that it shifted responsibility for the crisis of late medieval society from both Church and state to imaginary demons in human form." (Harris, 1973, 205) Religious and secular authorities, argues Harris, in leading the witch hunts, not only exonerated themselves but made themselves indispensable, cementing their power.

===Gender conflict===
An estimated 75% to 85% of those accused in the early modern witch trials were women,&lt;ref name="GibbonsRecent"&gt;Gibbons, Jenny (1998) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070203210023/http://chass.colostate-pueblo.edu/natrel/pom/old/POM5a1.html] "Recent Developments in the Study of the Great European Witch Hunt"] in ''The Pomegranate'' #5, Lammas 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
According to R. W. Thurston, 75–80% of the victims across both Europe and North America were women, [[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 42.
According to Anne Llewellyn Barstow, 80% of those accused and 85% of those executed in Europe were women. Barstow, Anne Llewellyn (1994) ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' San Francisco:Pandora. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Witch-hunts case"&gt;[http://www.gendercide.org/case_witchhunts.html Jones, Adam (1999-2002)]&lt;/ref&gt; and there is certainly evidence of [[misogyny]] on the part of those persecuting witches, evident from quotes such as  "[It is] not unreasonable that this scum of humanity, [witches], should be drawn chiefly from the feminine sex" ([[Nicholas Rémy]], c. 1595) or  "The Devil uses them so, because he knows that women love carnal pleasures, and he means to bind them to his allegiance by such agreeable provocations."&lt;ref&gt;Klaits, Joseph. ''Servants of Satan: The Age of the Witch Hunts'' (1985) p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar [[Kurt Baschwitz]] in his first monography on the subject (in Dutch, 1948) mentions this aspect of the witch trials even as ''"a war against old women"''.
Nevertheless, it has been argued that the supposedly misogynistic agenda of works on witchcraft has been greatly exaggerated, based on the selective repetition of a few relevant passages   of the ''Malleus maleficarum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=For the Glory of God: How Monotheism Led to Reformations, Science, Witch-Hunts, and the End of Slavery|last=Stark|first=Rodney|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=201–288|chapter=God's Enemies: Explaining the European Witch-Hunts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'On the whole, however, the literature of witchcraft conspicuously lacks any sustained concern for the gender issue; and the only reason for the view that it was extreme and outspoken in its anti-feminism is the tendency for those interested in this subject to read the relevant sections of the Malleus maleficarum and little or nothing else.', Clark, 'Thinking with Demons: the idea of witchcraft in early modern Europe', p. 116 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; There are various reasons as to why this was the case. In Early Modern Europe, it was widely believed that women were less intelligent than men and more susceptible to sin.{{sfnm|1a1=Scarre|1a2=Callow|1y=2001|1p=59|2a1=Thurston|2y=2001|2pp=42–45}}
Many modern scholars argue that the witch hunts cannot be explained simplistically as an expression of male misogyny, as indeed women were frequently accused by other women,&lt;ref&gt;'the theory that witch-hunting equals misogyny is embarrassed by the predominance of women witness against the accused', Purkis, 'The Witch In History', p. 92 (1996); Purkis provides detailed examples, and also demonstrates how some documents have been misread in a manner which attributes accusations or legal prosecution to men, when in fact the action was brought by a woman.
"More numerous than midwives among the accused were women who were engaged in caring for other women's children. Lyndal Roper has shown that many witchcraft accusations in Ausburg in the late sixteenth and early 17th century arose out of conflicts between mothers and the lying-in maids who provided care for them and their infants for a number of weeks after birth. It was not unnatural for the mothers to project their anxieties about their own health, as well as the precarious health of their infants, on to these women. When some misfortune did occur, therefore, the lying-in maids were highly vulnerable to charges of having deprived the baby of nourishment or of having killed it. What is interesting about these accusations is that they originated in tensions among women rather than between men and women. The same can be said regarding many other accusations made against women for harming young children.", Levack, ''The Witch-Hunt In Early Modern Europe'', p. 140 (2nd edition 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibbons 1998"&gt;[[#Gib98|Gibbons 1998]].&lt;/ref&gt;
to the point that witch-hunts, at least at the local level of villages, have been described as having been driven primarily by "women's quarrels".&lt;ref name="Briggs"&gt;"In Lorraine the majority were men, particularly when other men were on trial, yet women did testify in large numbers against other women, making up 43 per cent of witnesses in these cases on average, and predominating in 30 per cent of them.", Briggs, 'Witches &amp; Neighbors: The Social and Cultural Context of European Witchcraft', p. 264 (1998).
"It appears that women were active in building up reputations by gossip, deploying counter-magic and accusing suspects; crystallization into formal prosecution, however, needed the intervention of men, preferably of fairly high status in the community.", ibid., p. 265.
"The number of witchcraft quarrels that began between women may actually have been higher; in some cases, it appears that the husband as 'head of household' came forward to make statements on behalf of his wife, although the central quarrel had taken place between her and another woman.", Willis, ''Malevolent Nature'', p. 36 (1995).
"In Peter Rushton's examination of slander cases in the Durham church courts, women took action against other women who had labeled them witches in 61 percent of the cases.", ibid., p. 36.
"J.A. Sharpe also notes the prevalence of women as accusers in seventeenth-century Yorkshire cases, concluding that 'on a village level witchcraft seems to have been something peculiarly enmeshed in women's quarrels.'14 To a considerable extent, then, village-level witch-hunting was women's work.', ibid., p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;
Especially at the margins of Europe, in Iceland, Finland, Estonia and Russia, the majority of those accused were male.&lt;ref name="Iceland, Finland p. 39"&gt;'The widespread division of labour, which conceives of witches as female, and witch-doctors male, can hardly be explained by Christian influence. In some European countries, like Iceland, Finland, and Estonia, the idea of male witchcraft was dominant, and therefore most of the executed witches were male. As [[Kirsten Hastrup]] has demonstrated, only one of the twenty-two witches executed in Iceland was female. In Normandy three-quarters of the 380 known witchcraft defendants were male.', Behringer, 'Witches and Witch-Hunts: a global history', p. 39 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Barstow (1994) claimed that a combination of factors, including the greater value placed on men as workers in the increasingly wage-oriented economy, and a greater fear of women as inherently evil, loaded the scales against women, even when the charges against them were identical to those against men.&lt;ref&gt;Barstow, Anne Llewellyn (1994) ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' San Francisco: Pandora.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thurston (2001) saw this as a part of the general misogyny of the Late Medieval and Early Modern periods, which had increased during what he described as "the persecuting culture" from that which it had been in the Early Medieval.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. pp. 42-45.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gunnar Heinsohn]] and [[Otto Steiger (economist)|Otto Steiger]] in a 1982 publication speculated that witch-hunts targeted women skilled in midwifery specifically in an attempt to extinguish knowledge about [[birth control]] and "repopulate Europe" after the population catastrophe of the [[Black Death]].&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Heinsohn/Otto Steiger: The Elimination of Medieval Birth Control and the Witch Trials of Modern Times, International Journal of Women's Studies, 3, May 1982, 193–214.Gunnar Heinsohn/Otto Steiger: "Witchcraft, Population Catastrophe and Economic Crisis in Renaissance Europe: An Alternative Macroeconomic Explanation.", University of Bremen 2004 [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/funnyguy_35/6IKSF31.heins-steiger.witchcraft.pdf&amp;date=2009-10-25+22:25:08 (download)]

Mainstream scholarship has remained critical of this "macroeconomic approach", e.g. Walter Rummel: 'Weise' Frauen und 'weise' Männer im Kampf gegen Hexerei. Die Widerlegung einer modernen Fabel. In: Christof Dipper, Lutz Klinkhammer und Alexander Nützenadel: Europäische Sozialgeschichte. Festschrift für Wolfgang Schieder (= Historische Forschungen 68), Berlin 2000, S. 353–375, [http://www.historicum.net/themen/hexenforschung/thementexte/rezeption/art/Weise_Frauen/html/ca/b14c768f43/ historicum.net];
"there is no evidence that the majority of those accused were healers and midwives; in England and also some parts of the Continent, midwives were more than likely to be found helping witch-hunters." {{harv|Purkiss|1996|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic study==
Early rationalist historians interpreted the witch trials as an example of mass superstition, and thus their end in the 18th century was seen as a revival of [[common sense]] among the population.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=64}} This idea did not take into account that the existence of malevolent witches fitted within the worldview of the Early Modern, with its strong divide between good and evil, and that a belief in witches was therefore "common sense" to Early Modern people.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=64}}

During the Prussian [[Kulturkampf]], starting from the mid-19th century, the Roman Catholic Church was accused of being sole originator of witch hunts, the number of victims was significantly overstated with up to 9 million. According to recent research and extensive analysis of court records, it is believed that the result of persecution throughout Europe were about 40,000 to 60,000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Schwerhoff: Vom Alltagsverdacht zur Massenverfolgung. Neuere deutsche Forschungen zum frühneuzeitlichen Hexenwesen. Zeitschrift "Geschichte in Wissenschaft und Unterricht" 46, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From the 1970s onward, there was a "massive explosion of scholarly enthusiasm" for the study of the Early Modern witch trials.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=2}} This was partly because scholars from a variety of different disciplines, including [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[philosophy]], [[philosophy of science]], [[criminology]], [[literary theory]], and [[feminist theory]], all began to investigate the phenomenon and brought their different insights to bear on the subject.{{sfnm|1a1=Scarre|1a2=Callow|1y=2001|1p=2|2a1=Hutton|2y=2010|2p=248}} This was accompanied by in-depth analysis of the trial records and the socio-cultural contexts on which they emerged, allowing for a far more sophisticated understanding of the trials than had previously been available.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=2}}
During this process, Britain and Germany established themselves as the main centres for the research of the subject.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=57}} There have nevertheless been regional differences in how this has been undertaken; scholars in Britain and the United States have for instance largely neglected questions regarding how ancient ideas influenced and informed the identities of Early Modern witchcraft, something which conversely has been of great interest to a number of continental European scholars.{{sfn|Hutton|2010|p=248}}
&lt;br&gt;In 2017, the face of a woman who allegedly confessed to being a witch but who died before she could be burned, was reconstructed &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/31/face-witch-died-1704-digitally-reconstructed/|title=Face of 'witch' who died before she could be burned for her 'crimes' is digitally reconstructed 300 years later|work=Daily Telegraph|date=31 October 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception in wider culture ==

===Popular culture===
In 20th-century Western society, the witch trials were used as "a synonym for pointless persecution", such as the [[Red Scare]] and [[McCarthyism]] in the 1950s United States.{{sfn|Purkiss|1996|p=15}}

=== Witch-cult hypothesis and Wicca ===
{{main|Witch-cult hypothesis}}
Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the common belief among educated sectors of the European populace was that there had never been any genuine cult of witches and that all those persecuted and executed as such had been innocent of the crime.{{sfn|Cohn|1975|p=103}} However, at this time various scholars suggested that there had been a real cult that had been persecuted by the Christian authorities, and that it had had pre-Christian origins. The first to advance this theory was the German Professor of Criminal Law [[Karl Ernst Jarcke]] of the [[University of Berlin]] who put forward the idea in 1828; he suggested that witchcraft had been a pre-Christian German religion that had degenerated into Satanism.{{sfnm|1a1=Cohn|1y=1975|1pp=103-104|2a1=Purkiss|2y=1996|2p=34|3a1=Hutton|3y=1999|3p=136}} Jarcke's ideas were picked up by the German historian [[Franz Josef Mone]] in 1839, although he argued that the cult's origins were Greek rather than Germanic.{{sfnm|1a1=Cohn|1y=1975|1p=104|2a1=Hutton|2y=1999|2pp=136-137}}

In 1862, the Frenchman [[Jules Michelet]] published ''[[Satanism and Witchcraft|La Sorciere]]'', in which he put forth the idea that the witches had been following a pagan religion. The theory achieved greater attention when it was taken up by the Egyptologist [[Margaret Murray]], who published both ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'' (1921) and ''The God of the Witches'' (1931) in which she claimed that the witches had been following a pre-Christian religion which she termed "the Witch-Cult" and "Ritual Witchcraft". She claimed that this faith was devoted to a pagan [[Horned God]] and involved the celebration of four Witches' Sabbaths each year: [[Halloween]], [[Imbolc]], [[Beltane]] and [[Lughnasadh]].{{sfnm|1a1=Murray|1y=1952|2a1=Murray|2a2=1962}} However, the majority of scholarly reviews of Murray's work produced at the time were largely critical,{{sfn|Sheppard|2013|p=169}} and her books never receiving support from experts in the Early Modern witch trials.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=198}} Instead, from her early publications onward many of her ideas were challenged by those who highlighted her "factual errors and methodological failings".{{sfn|Eliade|1975|p=152}}

{{quote box | width = 30% | align = left
| quote = We Neopagans now face a crisis. As new data appeared, historians altered their theories to account for it. We have not. Therefore an enormous gap has opened between the academic and the 'average' Pagan view of witchcraft. We continue to use of out-dated and poor writers, like [[Margaret Murray]], [[Montague Summers]], [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], and [[Jules Michelet]]. We avoid the somewhat dull academic texts that present solid research, preferring sensational writers who play to our emotions.

However, the publication of the Murray thesis in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' made it accessible to "journalists, film-makers popular novelists and thriller writers", who adopted it "enthusiastically".{{sfn|Simpson|1994|p=89}} Influencing works of literature, it inspired writings by [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Robert Graves]].{{sfn|Simpson|1994|p=89}}
Subsequently, in 1939, an English occultist named [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] claimed to have been initiated into a surviving group of the pagan Witch-Cult known as the [[New Forest coven]], although modern historical investigation has led scholars to believe that this coven was not ancient as Gardner believed, but was instead founded in the 1920s or 1930s by occultists wishing to fashion a revived Witch-Cult based upon Murray's theories.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hes04|Heselton 2004]].&lt;/ref&gt; Taking this New Forest coven's beliefs and practices as a basis, Gardner went on to found [[Gardnerian Wicca]], one of the most prominent traditions in the [[Paganism (contemporary religions)|contemporary Pagan]] religion now known as [[Wicca]], which revolved around the worship of a Horned God and Goddess, the celebration of festivals known as ''Sabbats'', and the practice of ritual magic. He also went on to write several books about the historical Witch-Cult, ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959), and in these books, Gardner used the phrase "the burning times" in reference to the European and North American witch trials.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gar54|Gardner 1954]]. p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, a number of individuals and groups emerged in Europe, primarily Britain, and subsequently the United States as well, claiming to be the surviving remnants of the pagan Witch-Cult described in the works of Margaret Murray. The first of these actually appeared in the last few years of the 19th century, being a manuscript that American folklorist [[Charles Leland]] claimed he had been given by a woman who was a member of a group of witches worshipping the god [[Lucifer]] and goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] in [[Tuscany]], Italy. He published the work in 1899 as ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]''. Whilst historians and folklorists have accepted that there are folkloric elements to the gospel, none have accepted it as being the text of a genuine Tuscan religious group, and believe it to be of late-nineteenth-century composition.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance [[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. pp. 142–148 and [[#Mag02|Magliocco 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiccans extended claims regarding the witch-cult in various ways, for instance by utilising the British folklore associating witches with prehistoric sites to assert that the witch-cult used to use such locations for religious rites, in doing so legitimising contemporary Wiccan use of them.{{sfn|Doyle White|2014|p=68}}
By the 1990s, many Wiccans had come to recognise the inaccuracy of the witch-cult theory and had accepted it as a mythological origin story.{{sfn|Simpson|1994|p=95}}

=== Feminist interpretations ===
{{Main|Feminist interpretations of the Early Modern witch trials}}
Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, various [[feminism|feminist]] interpretations of the witch trials have been made and published. One of the earliest individuals to do so was the American [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]], a writer who was deeply involved in the [[First-wave feminism|first-wave feminist]] movement for [[women's suffrage]]. In 1893, she published the book ''Woman, Church and State'', which was "written in a tearing hurry and in time snatched from a political activism which left no space for original research."&lt;ref name="Hutton 1999 Page 141"&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Likely influenced by the works of [[Jules Michelet]] about the Witch-Cult, she claimed that the witches persecuted in the Early Modern period were pagan priestesses adhering to an [[Great Goddess hypothesis|ancient religion venerating a Great Goddess]]. She also repeated the erroneous statement, taken from the works of several German authors, that nine million people had been killed in the witch hunt.&lt;ref name="Hutton 1999 Page 141"/&gt; The United States has become the centre of development for these feminist interpretations.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|pp=57-58}}

In 1973, two American second-wave feminists, [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] and [[Deirdre English]], published an extended pamphlet in which they put forward the idea that the women persecuted had been the traditional healers and midwives of the community who were being deliberately eliminated by the male medical establishment.{{sfnm|1a1=Purkiss|1y=1996|1pp=19-20|2a1=Hutton|2y=1999|2p=342|3a1=Ehrenreich|3a2=English|3y=2010}} This theory disregarded the fact that the majority of those persecuted were neither healers nor midwives and that in various parts of Europe these individuals were commonly among those encouraging the persecutions.{{sfn|Purkiss|1996|p=8}} In 1994, Anne Llewellyn Barstow published her book ''Witchcraze'',{{sfn|Barstow|1994}} which was later described by Scarre and Callow as "perhaps the most successful" attempt to portray the trials as a systematic male attack on women.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=75}}

Other feminist historians have rejected this interpretation of events; historian [[Diane Purkiss]] described it as "not politically helpful" because it constantly portrays women as "helpless victims of patriarchy" and thus does not aid them in contemporary feminist struggles.{{sfn|Purkiss|1996|p=17}} She also condemned it for factual inaccuracy by highlighting that radical feminists adhering to it ignore the [[historicity]] of their claims, instead promoting it because it is perceived as authorising the continued struggle against patriarchal society.{{sfn|Purkiss|1996|pp=11, 16}} She asserted that many radical feminists nonetheless clung to it because of its "mythic significance" and firmly delineated structure between the oppressor and the oppressed.{{sfn|Purkiss|1996|p=8}}

[[File:Detroit Publishing Co. - A Yeoman of the Guard (N.B. actually a Yeoman Warder), full restoration.jpg|thumb|Yeoman Warder in Tudor State Dress, c. 1895]]
The '''Yeomen Warders of Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress the Tower of London, and Members of the Sovereign's Body Guard of the Yeoman Guard Extraordinary''', popularly known as the '''Beefeaters''', are ceremonial guardians of the [[Tower of London]]. In principle they are responsible for looking after any prisoners in the Tower and safeguarding the British [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|crown jewels]]; they have also conducted guided tours since the Victorian era.

In 2011, there were 37 Yeomen Warders and one Chief Warder,&lt;ref name="wantto"&gt;{{cite web|author=Louise Tickle |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jul/04/beefeaters-history-research-notes |title=Want to be a Beefeater? &amp;#124; Education |publisher=The Guardian |date=2011-07-04 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this number has remained stable since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Louise Tickle |url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/tower-of-london-secret-pub-beefeaters-2017-7/#welcome-to-the-tower-of-london-a-secure-fortress-royal-palace-and-infamous-prison-over-the-years-the-tower-has-confined-prisoners-ranging-from-elizabeth-i-to-the-kray-twins-two-of-henry-viiis-wives-were-beheaded-here-1 |title=One of the world’s most exclusive pubs is hidden within the Tower of London — take a look inside |publisher=Business Insider |date=2017-07-31 |accessdate=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All warders are retired from the [[Armed Forces]] of [[Commonwealth realms]] and must be former [[warrant officers]] with at least 22 years of service. They must also hold the [[Long Service and Good Conduct Medal|Long Service and Good Conduct]] medal.

The Yeomen Warders are often incorrectly referred to as [[Yeomen of the Guard]], which is actually a distinct corps of Royal Bodyguards.

==Etymology==

Although the Yeomen Warders are often referred to as [[Yeomen of the Guard]], which is a distinct corps of Royal Bodyguards of the British monarch, they are in fact a separate entity within this guard. [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s opera, ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888), is set in the 16th century, an earlier era before the two corps were split apart; it concerns what are today the Yeomen Warders.&lt;ref&gt;Minney, Rubeigh James (1970) ''The Tower of London'', Cassell, London. {{ISBN|0304934283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beefeater===
The name ''Beefeater'' is of uncertain origin, with various proposed derivations. The term was common as early as the 17th century as a slang term for the English in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.bartleby.com/81/1595.html |author=E. Cobham Brewer |work=Dictionary of Phrase and Fable |year=1898 |title=Beefeaters |via=Bartleby.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest connection to the Royal Household came as a reference to the Yeomen of the Guard by [[Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], who frequented the Court in 1669. In referring to the Yeomen of the Guard, he stated, "A very large ration of beef is given to them daily at the court, and they might be called Beef-eaters".&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |title=Yeomen of the Guard |volume=28 |pages=916–918 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri28chisrich#page/916/mode/1up |quote=The nickname 'Beef-eaters,' which is sometimes associated with the Yeomen of the Guard, had its origin in 1669, when Count Cosimo, grand duke of Tuscany, was in England, and, writing of the size and stature of this magnificent Guard, said, 'They are great eaters of beef, of which a very large ration is given them daily at the court, and they might be called Beef-eaters.' The supposed derivation from 'Buffetier' (''i.e. one who attends at the sideboard'') has no authority.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Beefeater'' name was carried over to the Yeomen Warders, due to the two corps' outward similarities and the Yeoman Warders' more public presence. ''Beefeaters'' also commonly produced and consumed broths made of beef, which were described as rich and hearty. These broths were known, at the time, as ''bef'' or ''beffy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benusis|first1=Jota|title=Broth Handbook|date=1998|publisher=Travis Russell &amp; Associates|location=Rapid City|page=46|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===The Tudor yeomen===
[[File:Beefeater at tower of london.jpg|thumb|upright|Yeoman Warder]]
The Yeomen Warders were formed in 1485 by the new King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], the first monarch of the [[Tudor dynasty]]; the [[Tudor rose]], a heraldic badge of the dynasty, is part of the badge of the Yeomen Warders to this day.

In 1509 Henry VIII moved his official residence from the Tower of London. The Tower retained the formal status of a royal palace and to mark this a party of twelve Yeomen of the Guard was left in place as a token garrison. The title of this detachment was subsequently changed to that of Tower warders as a more accurate reflection of their actual duties. As warders without any ceremonial state functions they forfeited the right to wear the scarlet royal livery of the now separate Yeoman of the Guard. This was, however, restored to them during the reign of [[Edward VI]] (1547–1553), reportedly at the request of a high court official who had been briefly imprisoned in the Tower and was impressed by the behavior of the warders.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

The original Tudor guard was split into two categories: the ordinary (i.e., permanent) guard and the additional troops of the extraordinary. In 1550, for example, the ordinary mustered 105 men, with an additional 300 extraordinary yeomen. Until 1549, the guards at the Tower were numbered among the extraordinary but in that year were raised to the status of ordinary yeomen. There was a considerable wage difference between the two groups. In 1562, a yeoman of the ordinary received 16d per day, whereas an extraordinary yeoman was paid the same as a common infantryman (4d or 6d). In 1551, the ordinary was expanded to 200 men, of whom 100 were to be archers and 100 halberdiers, but these numbers were not maintained. Uniform at this time was a velvet coat trimmed with silver gilt, worn over armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hale |first1=John Rigby |authorlink1=J.R.

The Yeomen Warders provided the permanent garrison of the [[Tower of London|Tower]], but the [[Constable of the Tower]] could call upon the men of the [[Tower division|Tower Hamlets]] to supplement them when necessary. The [[Tower division|Tower Hamlets, aka Tower Division]] was an area, significantly larger than the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|modern London Borough of the same name]], which owed military service to the [[Constable of the Tower|Constable]] in his ''ex officio'' role as [[Lord Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica, 15th Edition, 1993.

==Current composition and duties==
[[File:Moira Cameron.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|[[Moira Cameron]], the first female Yeoman Warder]]
In 2018, there were 37 Yeomen Warders and one Chief Warder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vinepair.com/articles/tower-of-london-secret-pub/|title=THERE’S A SECRET PUB IN THE TOWER OF LONDON, AND ONLY 37 PEOPLE ARE ON THE GUEST LIST |work=Vinepair  |date=9 May 2018 |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At one time, they were primarily guards but more recently, their role is primarily ceremonial; they have become greeters and guides for visitors, as part of their 21 duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20151023-the-secret-life-of-beefeaters |title=The Secret Life of Beefeaters |work=[[BBC]]  |date=4 November 2015|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/flight-sergeant-bristol-tower-london-1233592|title=Flight sergeant from Bristol to be a Tower of London beefeater |work=Bristol Post  |date=20 February 2018 |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

All Yeoman Warders are retired members of the [[British Armed Forces|armed services]]; to be appointed, one must be "a former Warrant Officer, class 1 or 2, (or the equivalent rank in other services) and in exceptional circumstances, a Staff Sergeant" from the [[Royal Navy]], [[British Army]], [[Royal Air Force]], or [[Royal Marines]]; must have earned the [[Long Service and Good Conduct Medal]]; and must have served for 22 years in the regular armed services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrp.org.uk/about-us/work-for-us/our-roles/front-of-house/yeoman-warders/ Yeoman Warders], [[Historic Royal Palaces]] (accessed December 27, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2009, sailors were ineligible to become Yeomen Warders. This was because sailors of the [[Royal Navy]]&amp;mdash;unlike soldiers, marines, and airmen&amp;mdash;swear an oath of allegiance to [[the Admiralty]] rather than the monarch personally.&lt;ref name="SailorBeefearer"&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sailor-beefeater-begins-work-at-tower-of-london Sailor Beefeater begins work at Tower of London] (press release), [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (October 31, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherman"&gt;Jonathan Sherman, [http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/people/take-him-to-the-tower-gosport-sailor-is-now-a-beefeater-1-3201910 Take him to the tower! Gosport sailor is now a Beefeater], ''[[Portsmouth News]]'' (November 1, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, sailors became eligible to join the Yeoman Warders after the Queen consented to a petition from the Governor of the Tower to allow Royal Navy senior ratings to serve.&lt;ref name="SailorBeefearer"/&gt;

The Yeomen Warders normally wear an 'undress' uniform of dark blue with red trimmings. When the sovereign visits the Tower, or the warders are on duty at a state occasion, they wear red and gold uniforms similar to those of the Yeomen of the Guard. These uniforms are referred to by the Yeoman Warders as the ''Tudor State Dress''.

[[File:Residential housing in the outer portion of the Tower Of London.jpg|thumb|left | Tower of London, residential house.]]The Yeomen Warders and their families live in [[tied accommodation]] inside the fortress, paying [[council tax]]es and rent. Most also have a home outside the grounds in order to have a break from their work environment. The Yeoman Warders Club is a pub exclusively for the  Warders and for their invited guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20151023-the-secret-life-of-beefeaters |title=The Secret Life of Beefeaters |work=[[BBC]]  |date=4 November 2015 |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They must own a home outside the fortress to occupy when they retire. Some of the accommodation dates back to the 13th century. The community of the Tower of London is made up of these Yeoman Warders and their families, the Resident Governor and officers, a chaplain and a doctor.

Yeomen Warders participate in the [[Ceremony of the Keys]] each night.

On 1 July 2007 a service woman, [[Moira Cameron]], became the first female Yeoman Warder in the history of the institution. Cameron joined the Army in 1985 at age 20. Aged 42 and [[Warrant officer (United Kingdom)|Warrant Officer Class 2]], she became eligible not long before her appointment. Previously, she served as Superintendent Clerk at a Brigade Headquarters with the [[Adjutant General's Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/?xml=/news/2007/01/12/nbeef12.xml |title=News – Latest breaking news – Telegraph |first=Caroline |last=Davies|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]  |location=[[London, UK|London]] |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, three male warders were suspended, accused of bullying of Cameron; two were dismissed and one was subsequently re-instated following the month-long investigation with the allegations against him "unproven".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/8379326.stm |title=Beefeaters fired in bully probe |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-11-25 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ravenmaster.jpg|thumb|left|Chris Skaife – the present 'Ravenmaster' in front of the [[Traitors' Gate]] ]]
The '''Yeoman Warder Ravenmaster''' (also known as the '''Ravenmaster''' for short) is one of the Yeomen Warders who has the responsibility to maintain the welfare of the [[common raven|raven]]s of the Tower of London. The official title has been in use since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/south-uist-raven-which-served-the-tower-of-london-dies-aged-22-1-4713511|title=South Uist raven which served the Tower of London dies aged 22|website=Scotsman|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known how long the ravens have been living in the Tower of London, but they were resident by the time of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]. Legend maintains that should the ravens ever leave the Tower, the White Tower will fall and disaster will befall the kingdom.&lt;ref name = "visit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryMagazine/DestinationsUK/Tower-Ravens|title=The Ravens at the Tower of London, England|website=www.historic-uk.com|accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[John Flamsteed]], the "astronomical observator", complained that the ravens interfered with observatory work, Charles initially ordered them destroyed, but reminded of the legend, the story goes that he decided to instead relocate the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] to [[Greenwich]]. &lt;ref name = "visit"/&gt; He decreed that at least six ravens must always remain at the Tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryMagazine/DestinationsUK/Tower-Ravens//Tower-Ravens|title=Tower Ravens|website=www.historic-uk.com|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of captive ravens probably goes back only to the later 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/10/ravens-tower-of-london/568312/|title=The Brilliant, Playful, Bloodthirsty Raven|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The current (2018) Yeoman Warder Ravenmaster of the Tower of London is retired [[Staff Sergeant]] Chris Skaife (a former [[Drum major (military)|Drum Major]] with the [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment]]), who took over from Derrick Coyle in 2011&lt;ref name = "visit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jerome|2006|pp=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; , who currently cares for seven of the birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/world/meet-the-ravenmaster |title=Why the Tower of London has a ravenmaster — a man charged with keeping at least six ravens at the castle at all times |publisher=[[National Post]] |date=30 September 2018 |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skaife has written a memoir of his experiences in the role, ''The Ravenmaster: My Life with the Ravens at the Tower of London''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/the-ravenmaster-my-life-with-the-ravens-at-the-tower-of-london/|title=Book Marks reviews of The Ravenmaster: My Life with the Ravens at the Tower of London by Christopher Skaife|website=bookmarks.reviews|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to prevent the ravens from flying away, their flight feathers have traditionally been trimmed so that they could not fly in a straight line for any appreciable distance. The ravens have been free, however, to roam the Tower grounds.&lt;ref name = "visit"/&gt; More recently, the Ravenmaster has been clipping less of the wings and feathers, in order to allow them to fly, instead of merely hopping or gliding, and they can reach the top of the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/10/ravens-tower-of-london/568312/|title=The Brilliant, Playful, Bloodthirsty Raven|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the birds, Merlina, is allowed to fly to the wharf on the Thames but that she always returns due to the bonding with her keeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/10/ravens-tower-of-london/568312/|title=The Brilliant, Playful, Bloodthirsty Raven|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/15/could-legend-come-true-tower-london-ravens-can-fly-warden-reduces/ |title=WExclusive: Could the legend come true?

The Ravenmaster releases the birds from their cages and prepares breakfast for them at dawn each day. The warders have commented that the "real beefeaters" at the Tower are the ravens. Traditionally, they were fed raw beef bought at [[Smithfield, London#Market|Smithfield Meat Market]] by the Ravenmaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spitalfieldslife.com/2013/03/03/chris-skaife-master-raven-keeper-at-the-tower-of-london-merlin-the-raven/|title=Chris Skaife, Master Raven Keeper at the Tower of London, &amp; Merlin the Raven – Spitalfields Life|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, other foods have been introduced to their diet, such as chicks, [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], mice and pig hearts, as well as peanuts, dog biscuits soaked in blood and fish&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/10/ravens-tower-of-london/568312/|title=The Brilliant, Playful, Bloodthirsty Raven|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in hope that this tactic would reduce the amount of scavenging from the garbage bins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/15/could-legend-come-true-tower-london-ravens-can-fly-warden-reduces/ |title=Exclusive: Could the legend come true?

[[File:Yupian Ishiyamadera.jpg|thumb|300px|Vol. 27 of the ''Yupian'' in [[Ishiyama-dera]], [[Ōtsu]], Japan]]
The '''''Yupian''''' ({{zh|c=玉篇|p='''Yùpiān'''|w='''Yü-p'ien'''}}; "Jade Chapters") is a c. 543 [[Chinese dictionary]] edited by Gu Yewang ([[:zh:顧野王|顧野王]]; Ku Yeh-wang; 519-581) during the [[Liang dynasty]]. It arranges 12,158 character entries under 542 [[radical (Chinese character)|radicals]], which differ somewhat from the original 540 in the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]''.  Each character entry gives a [[fanqie]] pronunciation gloss and a definition, with occasional annotation.

Baxter describes the textual history:
&lt;blockquote&gt; The original ''Yùpiān'' was a large and unwieldy work of thirty ''juàn'' ["volumes; fascicles"], and during Táng and Sòng various abridgements and revisions of it were made, which often altered the original ''[[fanqie|fănqiè]]'' spellings; of the original version only fragments remain (some two thousand entries out of a reported original total of 16,917), and the currently-available version of the ''Yùpiān'' is not a reliable guide to Early Middle Chinese phonology. (1992: 40-41) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 760, during the [[Tang dynasty]], Sun Jiang (孫強; Sun Chiang) compiled a ''Yupian'' edition, which he noted had a total of 51,129 words, less than a third of the original 158,641. In 1013, [[Song dynasty]] scholar Chen Pengnian (陳彭年; Ch'en P'eng-nien) published a revised ''Daguang yihui Yupian'' (大廣益會玉篇; "Expanded and enlarged Jade Chapters"). The Japanese monk [[Kūkai]] brought an original version ''Yupian'' back from China in 806, and modified it into his c. 830 ''[[Tenrei Banshō Meigi]]'', which is the oldest extant [[Japanese dictionary]].
