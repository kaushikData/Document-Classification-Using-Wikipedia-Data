The '''1964 T-39 shootdown incident''' occurred on 28 January 1964, when an unarmed [[United States Air Force]] [[North American Sabreliner|T-39 Sabreliner]] on a training mission was shot down over [[Erfurt]], [[East Germany]] by a [[Soviet Air Force|Soviet]] [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19]] fighter aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710195808/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=573 |title=Factsheets : North American T-39A Sabreliner |publisher=Nationalmuseum.af.mil |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=T39&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.western-allies-berlin.com/units/military-liaison-mission/usmlm/detail/t-39-crash |title=T-39 Aircraft Incident |publisher=Western-allies-berlin.com |date=28 January 1964 |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19640128-0 Aviation Safety Network] Retrieved on 27 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The occupants of the aircraft were Lieutenant Colonel Gerald K. Hannaford, Captain Donald Grant Millard and Captain John F. Lorraine. All three died,&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,870650,00.html|title=Cold War: Cold Blooded Murder|work=Time|date=7 February 1964|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming some of the few US confirmed direct casualties of the [[Cold War (1962–1979)|Cold War]] in Europe.

== Background ==
{{Main|Cold War}}
Following the cessation of hostilities at the end of World War II, a situation which came to be known as the [[Cold War]] developed between the United States, Canada, and [[NATO|Western European nations]] on one side, and the [[Warsaw Pact|Soviet bloc]] on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blainey|2005|pp=274–277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions between the United States and [[Soviet Union]] were most felt in the regions bordering the [[Iron Curtain]], notably [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]], and during this time relations between the two superpowers were characterized by hostile attitudes, spying, and numerous incidents resulting in loss of life and equipment. One of the most famous of these is the [[1960 U-2 incident|shooting down]] of a [[Lockheed U-2]] spy plane, piloted by [[Francis Gary Powers]], over the Soviet Union in May 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blainey|2005|pp=344–345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Event ==
On 28 January 1964, an unarmed USAF [[North American Sabreliner|North American T-39A Sabreliner]] twin engine jet trainer, ''62-4448'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19640128-0 |title=ASN Aircraft accident North American CT-39A Sabreliner 62-4448 Vogelsberg village, Thüringen |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date= |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_serials/1962.html |title=1962 USAF Serial Numbers |publisher=Joebaugher.com |date= |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the 7101st Air Base Wing, departed [[Wiesbaden]], West Germany, at 14:10 on a routine three-hour training flight. On board the trainer were three men, Captain John F. Lorraine and students Lieutenant Colonel Gerald K. Hannaford and Captain Donald G. Millard. Lorraine was the qualified instructor, while Hannaford and Millard, both pilots with experience on other types, were being trained in order to qualify on the T-39.&lt;ref name=time /&gt;

The flight proceeded uneventfully until, 47 minutes after takeoff, [[radar]] at two U.S. air defense stations noticed that the trainer was heading toward East Germany at {{convert|500|mph}}.&lt;ref name=time /&gt; Hoping to divert the T-39 back on course, each station began hailing the plane on Air Force frequencies and a Soviet-monitored international distress band. Repeated calls to the T-39 went unanswered. It appeared that the T-39's radio systems malfunctioned and the crew were unable to respond.&lt;ref name=time /&gt;

The T-39 crossed the border into East Germany. Within five minutes, two blips appeared near the American jet. For 11 minutes, radar blips indicated the three planes were moving eastward, then two blips suddenly veered west and the third blip disappeared. American personnel monitoring the T-39's flight could not determine what had happened, although it was later reported that residents in [[Vogelsberg, Thuringia|Vogelsberg]], {{convert|50|mi|km|sp=us}} from the border, had heard machine-gun and cannon fire and had witnessed the plane crash.&lt;ref name=time /&gt; The incident is believed to have occurred at 15:14 hours.&lt;ref name=T39 /&gt;

At 17:00 hours on 28 January the United States [[Military Liaison Missions|Military Liaison Mission]] (USMLM), in Berlin, received a warning to stand by for possible search and rescue of American airmen.&lt;ref name=T39 /&gt; By 18:00 hours, a search team left Berlin for the Erfurt area of East Germany. At 19:15 hours, the chief of the USMLM met with his Soviet counterpart to request help in finding the plane and rescuing survivors (per the Huebner–Malinin Agreement).&lt;ref name=T39 /&gt;

At 20:00 hours, a second search team left Berlin. About this same time, the first team arrived at the crash site, {{convert|20|km|mi|sp=us}} north of Erfurt. The first team received a report from an East German civilian that a U.S. plane had crashed and burned, and that the crew was dead.&lt;ref name=T39 /&gt; Throughout the night, the American teams tried to approach the aircraft and were repeatedly sent away by the armed Soviet forces on site.&lt;ref name=T39 /&gt; These forces denied that any aircraft had crashed, and two American search teams were detained briefly before being released at 14:00 hours on 29 January.&lt;ref name=T39 /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
By 29 January, the [[United States State Department]] charged that the Soviet Union shot down an unarmed plane and caused the needless deaths of three officers. Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] called the action a "shocking and senseless act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19640130&amp;id=d50RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BekDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6479,5227671|title=Red Attack on U.S. Jet: Three Americans Killed in Unarmed Trainer Crash|work=The Spokesman Review|date=30 January 1964|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Soviet press agency, [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|Tass]], Moscow claimed that the plane had intruded over East German territory and failed to react to signals, and then a warning shot. The Soviets said they were compelled to take the measure that brought down the U.S. plane.&lt;ref name=time /&gt;

On 30 January, the Soviets agreed to allow US personnel access to the crash site.&lt;ref name=T39 /&gt; This occurred the following day and later the bodies of all three servicemen were returned to the United States through [[Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility|Andrews Air Force Base]] in Maryland. General [[Curtis E. LeMay]] met the plane and participated in an honors ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_RweAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Y34EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3092,2204853&amp;dq=shot+down+millard|title=US to Fly Bodies of Airmen Home|work=The Milwaukee Journal|date= 5 February 1964|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19640129&amp;id=DRUOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5HwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4775,4839495 |title=Soviets Admit Downing U.S. Plane |work=St. Petersburg Times |date=29 January 1964 |accessdate=17 April 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft wreckage was also recovered and was taken to Berlin, arriving there on 1 February 1964.&lt;ref name=T39 /&gt;

In 2012, a strong [[storm]] swept across southern [[Uruguay]] from 18 to 19 September.&lt;ref name="tormenta"/&gt;

==Facts==
The main area affected were the departments on the [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]] and [[Atlantic]] coasts: Colonia, San José, Montevideo, Canelones, Maldonado, Rocha.&lt;ref name="tormenta"/&gt; 

The strongest winds were in Punta del Este (172&amp;nbsp;km/h), Montevideo (122&amp;nbsp;km/h), Laguna del Sauce (120&amp;nbsp;km/h), Colonia (103&amp;nbsp;km/h), San José (102&amp;nbsp;km/h), Melo (98&amp;nbsp;km/h), Tacuarembó (87&amp;nbsp;km/h), Rivera (83&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name="tormenta"/&gt;

The government was forced to close public buildings, suspend transport and recommend residents in the capital Montevideo and other locations along the coast to remain at home. Luckily enough, it was the week of spring holidays, so children did not have to attend school.&lt;ref name="mercopress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2012/09/20/spring-cyclone-paralyzes-uruguay-s-capital-as-residents-are-told-to-stay-at-home|title=Spring cyclone paralyzes Uruguay’s capital |date=20 Sep 2012|publisher=MercoPress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[Meteorologist]]s considered this to be an [[extratropical cyclone]].&lt;ref name="tormenta"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/232955/tres-muertos-por-el-temporal/|title=3 people dead in the storm|date=20 Sep 2012|accessdate=|publisher=[[El Observador (Uruguay)|El Observador]]|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General comment was that his cyclone was less severe than the [[2005 Uruguay storm|2005 storm]].&lt;ref name="2005-2012"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/232947/el-ciclon-extratropical-de-2005-fue-mas-profundo-que-el-de-ayer/ |title=2005 cyclone much worse than 2012|date=20 Sep 2012|accessdate=|publisher=El Observador|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three people were reported dead in San José, due to a flood.&lt;ref name="tormenta"/&gt;

This storm is part of a regional phenomenon covering also Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia, where other people were reported dead as well.&lt;ref name="regional"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/12/09/20/ultmo_664902.asp |title=Southern Cone panics with the cyclone |date=20 Sep 2012|accessdate=|publisher=EL PAIS|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, doctors in France demanded an investigation into why thirteen babies in three rural areas had been born without hands, forearms or arms in three rural areas, between 2007 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-health-babies/france-investigates-reports-of-babies-born-without-arms-in-rural-areas-idUSKCN1N51MV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Willsher |first1=Kim |title=French doctors fail to solve mystery of babies with missing limbs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/08/france-doctors-fail-solve-mystery-babies-missing-limbs |accessdate=15 November 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public health authority initially stated that the incidents were not significantly higher than the national average, and they would not investigate further.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; However, after additional cases were reported, also in rural areas, health minister [[Agnès Buzyn]] launched a nationwide investigation into the causes in November 2018.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news |title=France opens probe on babies born without hands or arms |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-01/french-babies-born-with-no-hands-arms-probe-launched/10453596 |accessdate=15 November 2018 |work=ABC News |agency=Reuters |date=1 November 2018 |location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=French Ain babies: Missing limb births prompt national inquiry |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46043564 |accessdate=15 November 2018 |work=BBC News |date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Senthilingam |first1=Meera |title=France launches nationwide investigation after babies born with missing or malformed limbs |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/01/health/france-babies-missing-limbs-investigation-intl/index.html |accessdate=15 November 2018 |work=CNN |date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Field of Remembrance in Sydney was held in 1952.&lt;ref name="DPC" /&gt; It was an idea that originated from the late Mrs C J Pope, widow of Rear Admiral Pope, after she had visited London and been impressed by the [[Field of Remembrance]] held each year in an old churchyard near [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref name="NLAWWGNSW" /&gt; In 1972 the Attorney-General granted the War Widows’ Guild of Australia NSW Ltd permission to use the word 'ANZAC' in the title, and the Field has been known since then as the ANZAC Field of Remembrance and continues to the present day.&lt;ref name="BurgeP70"&gt;Burge, Roslyn (2008), ''No Peacetime Cinderellas: A History of the War Widows’ Guild of Australia in New South Wales 1946–2006'', Australia: War Widows’ Guild of Australia NSW Ltd, {{ISBN|9780646477374}} (hbk.) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Ceremony ==
A non-denominational service is held prior to [[Anzac Day]] at St Andrew’s Cathedral, Sydney, with a lesson read by the [[Governor of New South Wales]].&lt;ref name="WWGWebsiteFoR"&gt;[http://www.warwidowsnsw.com.au/About_the_Guild/ANZAC_Field_of_Rememberance.htm War Widows Guild of Australia NSW Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The service is followed by the Dedication of the Field and the planting of the official crosses. The first cross is planted by the Governor in memory of [[The Unknown Warrior]], followed by crosses planted on behalf of the three armed forces: Navy, Army and Air Force; the citizens of Sydney; New Zealanders and their armed forces; veterans; and war widows. The Field was originally laid out on the lawn adjoining the Cathedral near Bathurst Street. Since 2016 the Field has been in Hyde Park on the Corner of Park Street and Elizabeth Street close to the ANZAC Memorial. The crosses are planted in a set of flower boxes that are periodically used to decorate the [[City of Sydney]].&lt;ref name="BurgeP73"&gt;Burge, Roslyn (2008), ''No Peacetime Cinderellas: A History of the War Widows’ Guild of Australia in New South Wales 1946–2006'', Australia: War Widows’ Guild of Australia NSW Ltd, {{ISBN|9780646477374}} (hbk.) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Crosses ==
The small wooden crosses are colour-coded to represent the different armed forces. A sprig of [[rosemary]] is attached to each cross which represents a loved one gone but remembered. They are each personalised with hand written names or small messages.&lt;ref name="BurgeP73" /&gt; After the Field of Remembrance is closed, the crosses are cremated and scattered on the graves of veterans in a memorial garden.&lt;ref&gt;Burge, Roslyn (2008), ''No Peacetime Cinderellas: A History of the War Widows’ Guild of Australia in New South Wales 1946–2006'', Australia: War Widows’ Guild of Australia NSW Ltd, {{ISBN|9780646477374}} (hbk.) p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

== Duration ==
The Field of Remembrance is open for widows and members of the public to place crosses in personal remembrance, from the day of the commemoration service until the late afternoon on Anzac Day.&lt;ref name="WWGWebsiteFoR" /&gt;

== Milestone ==
The Guild held its 60th ANZAC Field of Remembrance on 19 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warwidowsnsw.com.au/pdfs/Digest_Mar_2011.pdf War Widows’ Guild of Australia NSW Limited, “Our President’s Message”, Guild Digest, March 2011] p. 5, ISSN 1449-3691&lt;/ref&gt; At this service, war widows from major and recent conflicts laid sprays of flowers on the Chancel steps of the Cathedral. The Governor of New South Wales, Her Excellency Professor Marie Bashir AC CVO unveiled a plaque to recognise this milestone of 60 years.

== Other Fields of Remembrance ==
Following the establishment of the Sydney Field of Remembrance, the War Widows’ Guild has also held Fields of Remembrance in Albury, Newcastle, The Entrance and Tamworth.&lt;ref&gt;Burge, Roslyn (2008), ''No Peacetime Cinderellas: A History of the War Widows’ Guild of Australia in New South Wales 1946–2006'', Australia: War Widows’ Guild of Australia NSW Ltd, {{ISBN|9780646477374}} (hbk.) pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt; The War Widows’ Guild in the Australian Capital Territory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.act.raafa.org.au/news/newsletter-Jun%2009.pdf RAAF Association (ACT Division) (June 2009), Field of Remembrance Ceremony] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221121118/http://www.act.raafa.org.au/news/newsletter-Jun%2009.pdf |date=February 21, 2011 }} Newsletter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gg.gov.au/speech.php/view/id/210/title/war-widows-guild-of-australia-act-13th-field-of-remembrance |title=His Excellency Major General Michael Jeffery AC CVO MC, Speech, 20 April 2007, Canberra |access-date=2011-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110328045341/http://www.gg.gov.au/speech.php/view/id/210/title/war-widows-guild-of-australia-act-13th-field-of-remembrance |archive-date=2011-03-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tasmania&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govhouse.tas.gov.au/sites/default/files/annual-reports/Gov-House-Annual-Report-2009-2010.pdf Office of the Governor of Tasmania (2009–2010), The Year in Review] Annual Report&lt;/ref&gt; also hold Fields of Remembrance.

{{Campaignbox Battle of Aleppo}}

The '''October–December 2013 Aleppo offensive''' or '''Operation Northern Storm'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-and-hezbollah-advance-in-southern-and-eastern-aleppo-latest-map-update/|title=Syrian Army and Hezbollah Advance in Southern and Eastern Aleppo – Latest Map Update|author=Leith Fadel|work=Al-Masdar News|date=11 November 2015|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a campaign during the [[Syrian civil war]] launched by the [[Syrian army]] in the [[Aleppo Governorate]] to reopen a key supply route linking central Syria to the largest city, [[Aleppo]]. The offensive began when the [[Syrian Army]] attacked the strategic town of [[Khanasir]].

== Background ==
In June 2013, after their strategic [[Battle of al-Qusayr (2013)|capture of al-Qusayr]], government forces launched an offensive called Northern Storm in Aleppo Province aimed at securing supply lines between disparate patches of control in the province. However, increased rebel pressure in [[Homs Governorate|Homs Province]] led the government to abandon the offensive and redeploy its troops there, leaving its supply lines to Aleppo city vulnerable to attack.&lt;ref name="adiyat dabha"/&gt;

Later in the summer, rebels capitalised on this strategic weakness. In late July, rebels launched an offensive west of Aleppo city culminating in the capture of several suburbs and [[Khan al-Assal massacre|a massacre of captured government soldiers]], and on 5 August, the long-besieged Menagh Airbase in the north of the province [[Siege of Menagh Air Base|fell to the rebels]]. On 26 August, rebels captured the strategic town of Khanasir, thus cutting the government's last land supply route to the contested city of Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/08/2013826124946176888.html|title=Syria rebels take control of strategic town|date=26 August 2013|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebels then turned their sights to the government-controlled southern countryside of Aleppo. On 20 September, a coalition of at least ten rebel groups led by [[Ahrar ash-Sham]] and the [[Tawhid Brigade]] launched an offensive called [http://quran.com/100 ''wal-'Adiyat Dabha''] against government positions between the southern edge of the city and the defence factories outside of rebel-held [[Al-Safira]]. In the first six days of the offensive, rebels made significant advances, claiming to have captured at least 25 villages.&lt;ref&gt;Names of villages (from The Institute for the Study of War): Kafr Hout, al-Zaraa, Kafr Kar, Banan al-Has, Sarj Far'a, Balouza, Burj 'Azawi, Madrasa village, Im Jaran, Qanatrat, Samaria, Maghriyat al-Shebli, al-Mayan, al-Manatir, Rasm al-Safa, Rasm Humud, Mazraa Ali Hussein, Diyman, Sada’aya, Rasm al-Shih, Mazraa al-Ayoub, Rasm al-Hilwa, Tayeba, Rasm 'Akirish, and al-Sufayrah&lt;/ref&gt; In response, government forces from [[Aleppo International Airport]] redeployed south to counter the rebel offensive.&lt;ref name="adiyat dabha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iswsyria.blogspot.com/2013/09/offensives-in-aleppo-from-july.html|title=The wal-'Adiyat Dabha Offensive in Southern Aleppo|last=Caris|first=Charlie|author2=Isabel Nassief|date=26 September 2013|publisher=Institute for the Study of War|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The offensive ==

=== Capture of Khanasir and reopening of the highway ===
To reopen supply lines to Aleppo city, the government launched a counteroffensive along the so-called "Desert Road" between Aleppo and [[Salamiyah]], dispatching a large convoy from the latter backed with heavy air support. Khanasir, captured by rebels in August, was the first major objective of the Army as it occupies a critical chokepoint on the road.

On 1 October, the shelling of Khanasir and fighting between the Army and rebels in the vicinity of the town killed at least 20 rebel fighters. The village of Jub al-Ghaws, near of Khanasir was bombed by helicopters while, according to SOHR, rebel fighters hit a fighter airplane above Khanasir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://supportkurds.org/news/tuesday-1-october-2013/ |title=Tuesday 1 October 2013 |publisher=Supportkurds.org |date=2 October 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 October, according to SOHR, the Syrian Army progressed in Khanasir, taking control of parts of the city while a large number of rebel positions were hit by the Air Force in the province; al-Atareb, Khan al-A'sal, Kafrnaha and Minnegh military airport.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

On 3 October, the Army took back control of Khanasir, with at least 25 rebel fighters and 18 pro-government militiamen being killed between 1 and 2 October. However, the military had not yet reopened the highway to Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/in-focus/syria/syria-army-retakes-northern-strategic-town-1.1238911 |title=Syria army retakes northern strategic town |publisher=Gulfnews.com |date=3 October 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004064006/http://gulfnews.com/in-focus/syria/syria-army-retakes-northern-strategic-town-1.1238911 |archivedate=4 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://supportkurds.org/news/wednesday-2-october-2013/ |title=Wednesday 2 October 2013 |publisher=Supportkurds.org |date=3 October 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October, the Army managed to reopen the supply route between Aleppo and Khanasir, capturing many surrounding villages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.aljazeera.com/Event/Syria_Live_Blog/92310948 |title=Syria Live Blog |publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=7 October 2013 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; like Rasm Okeiresh, Rasm al-Sheikh, Rasm al-Helou, Rasm Bakrou, al-Wawiyeh, Rasm al-Safa, Barzanieh, Jalagheem, Zarraa, and Kafar Akkad,&lt;ref name="english.al-akhbar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/content/syrian-army-ends-opposition-siege-aleppo |title=Syrian Army Ends Opposition Siege on Aleppo |publisher=[[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)]] |date=8 October 2013 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; breaking the siege of Aleppo. According to a governorate source, convoys carrying flour, food supplies, and fuel, went to Aleppo.&lt;ref name="english.al-akhbar.com"/&gt;

=== Capture of al-Safira and Tell Aran ===
[[File:1alep.png|thumb|left|Situation in Aleppo city during the offensive]]
On 10 October, heavy Army shelling and air-strikes of the rebel-held town [[al-Safira]] killed 16-18 civilians. One of the areas that was hit was the town's market. According to one rebel, if opposition forces lost control of al-Safira everything they had accomplished over the previous year in Aleppo would be lost in a matter of days.&lt;ref name="rage"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://supportkurds.org/news/thursday-10-october-2013/ |title=Thursday 10 October 2013 |publisher=Supportkurds.org |date=11 October 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October, after clashes, the Army captured the village of Abu Jurayn, in the south of al-Safira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lorientlejour.com/article/837206/syrie-violents-combats-pres-dun-site-chimique-presume.html |title=Syrie: violents combats près d'un site chimique présumé |publisher=L'Orient-Le Jour |date= |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 and 18 October, heavy Army shelling of the rebel-held Kurdish town of [[Tell Aran]] left 21 civilians dead. 11 others were also injured. The town had been captured from Kurdish militants by jihadist rebels earlier in July.&lt;ref name="friday"/&gt;

=== Battle of Base 80 ===

On 8 November, before sunrise, the Syrian Army launched an attack against "[[Base 80]]", controlled by the rebels since February 2013, near the Aleppo airport. The Army, backed up by tanks and heavy artillery, unleashed "the heaviest barrage in more than a year" according to residents in Aleppo. A rebel fighter said, "We did not see it coming. The attack came as a real shock to us." According to Al-Jazeera, if the Army captured the base, it would cut the rebel supply routes between Aleppo city and the opposition-controlled town of al-Bab, about 30 kilometers from the Turkish border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.aljazeera.com/Event/Syria_Live_Blog/95575090 |title=Syria Live Blog |publisher=Live.aljazeera.com |date=8 November 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By morning, the Army took over several areas of "Base 80", leaving them in control of large parts of it.

=== Aleppo's eastern approach and attack on Tell Hassel ===

On 12 November, the Syrian Army had penetrated the town of al-Naqqarin in the eastern outskirts of Aleppo city, advancing further north.

'''Animasyros''' is an international [[animation]] festival and forum. Since 2008 the festival takes place in the capital of [[Cyclades]], [[Hermoupolis]] of [[Syros]], and includes animation movies screenings, special tributes to international festivals, professional forum with the participation of distinguished Greek and foreign creators and professionals, workshops for students and children, the applied follow-up workshop “making of”, parties and other parallel events.

== History ==
Each year the festival is enriched by new and original events, focused on social issues, such as [[domestic violence]], the status of women, [[racism]], etc. All events are free and are held in venues of the island, such as the Apollon Theatre, the municipal Cultural Centre, the local cinema.  In 2014 open-air screenings began to take place on [[Miaoulis Square]]. Animasyros is the largest animation festival in [[Greece]] and one of the 20 largest of its kind in [[Europe]]. In 2014 the festival joined the European Project “[[Creative Europe]]”, which was designed to support millions of artists and professionals in the cultural field and to offer a new impulse on the cultural sector of Europe, and took advantage of its resources. Aim of the festival has from the early beginning been to show how a relatively new form of art in [[Greece]], as animation, can be adopted by the Greek art scene as well as to present significant creators. The selection of the event venue was made in connection to the fact that a society full of urban culture, such as [[Hermoupolis]]’ one, can enfold an initiative, which is gradually transformed from a local one to an international. In 2014 Animasyros joined, after a decision taken by [[Syros]]- Hermoupolis’ City Council, the task group that will create and establish the proposal of the nomination “Syros- Cyclades 2021” - [[Cultural Capital of Europe]].

== International participation ==
The festival has gradually become an attraction spot for tens of significant artists and animation schools. In the past outstanding schools, festivals as well as representatives of award-winning animation production companies participated in the happenings and tributes of Animasyros. Owing to the festival, artists like [[Nina Paley]], Jim Capobianco, Ülo Pikkov, Patrick Smith, Marie-Margaux Tsakiri-Scanatovits, Alain Baran, as well as representatives of production companies, such as [[LAIKA]], [[Pixar]] and [[Dreamworks]], and international festivals, such as Anima Brussels International Animation Film Festival, Canterbury Anifest, Annecy International Festival of Animated Film, Trickfilm festival, Hiroshima international animation festival, [[Anifest]], [[Animafest Zagreb]] etc., visited [[Syros]]. Furthermore, the festival program has occasionally included special tributes to artists like [[Signe Baumane]], Jacques- Rémy Girerd etc.

== Greek participation and workshops ==
Greek animation scene is represented each year in the festival with special tributes as well as through the competition section, which highlights any notable creative effort. Throughout the seven years of the festival, prominent creators like Aggelos Spartalis, Helen Miltsi, Effie Pappa etc. have distinguished. At the same time, Animasyros runs a student competition sector, which constitutes a great chance for new talents to emerge. Greek animation artists and teachers like Christine Depian, Helen Mouri, Giannis Xagoraris, Constantinos Tiligades etc. undertake to teach in the workshops of Animasyros and host tens of animation fans. The free educational programs of the festival, including both children and applied workshops, cover the largest possible range of creation fields.

== Mascot, production and supporters ==
The mascot of the festival is “AnimaSpyros”; a [[Cycladic]] figure with references to director [[Woody Allen]]. “AnimaSpyros” was designed by Petros Christoulias and developed in three dimensions by Constantinos Petrou. Since 2008 has accompanied all festival events and reminds us of both the origin and the concept of the festival. Animasyros is organized by PLATFORMA – Company of Urban Culture. The production team of the festival consists of above fifty members, who apart from coordinating and managing the event are also dealing with artistic and technical issues, such as animation, graphic design, direction, photography, multimedia etc. Additionally, valuable partners of the festival are the volunteers –around fifty on average- who contribute to the accomplishment of all Animasyros events. Animasyros is set every year under the auspices of the Municipality of Syros- Hermoupolis, the [[South Aegean Region]], whereas receives the active support of both public, such as the General Secretariat for Gender Equality, the Ministry of Tourism, the [[University of Aegean]], and private institutions, such as [[Onassis Foundation|Onassis Cultural Centre]], the [[Benaki Museum]] etc. Supporters of the festival are also on a regular basis educational departments of foreign embassies in [[Greece]]. The involvement of the local business community of the island has all these seven years been at a high level. Local authorities have confronted the festival from the early beginning with great respect, since except of its artistic dynamic the festival has contributed to the extension of the island’s touristic season as well as has presented the island as a high standards’ touristic destination. The participation in all the activities and screenings of Animasyros is free.

== Animasyros7 ==
The festival reached its seven years of active presence in 2014. The happenings of Animasyros7, which were held from 2 to 5 October, included
for a first time open-air screenings on [[Miaoulis Square]], executed with the use of special technical equipment. This year’s screenings and parallel events attracted more than 3.000 visitors, both [[Greek people|Greek]] and foreign. The happenings of Animasyros7 opened for a first time with a special ceremony at the [[Benaki Museum]] in [[Athens]], where a presentation of this year’s events and screenings as well as an overall assessment of Animasyros6 took place. Guests of this event were, among others, [[Mark Shapiro (animator)|Mark Shapiro]], representative of [[Laika (company)|LAIKA]] Studio, creator [[Nina Paley]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zippyframes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2146:nina-paley-talks-animation-the-prophet-and-animasyros-fest&amp;catid=97:interviews&amp;Itemid=100010&lt;/ref&gt; along with representatives of the American Embassy in [[Athens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://athens.usembassy.gov/animasyros.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028233037/http://athens.usembassy.gov/animasyros.html# |archive-date=2014-10-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an ardent supporter of the festival. As far as the artistic part is concerned, Animasyros included more than one hundred screenings, special guests from the U.S., the [[Great Britain]], [[France]] and other countries, thematic workshops for elementary students, young and older animation fans, whereas a nationwide premiere of the new production of the award-winning animation studio [[LAIKA]], “[[The Boxtrolls]]”, was held. For four whole days, Hermoupolis experienced the spirit of the animation world. As a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] city, [[Hermoupolis]], resembled to animation movie scenery along with the 150 years old Apollon Theatre and the enthusiastic audience (students, professionals, journalists, natives of all ages, parents carrying their children within the theatre’s hall). The age spectrum was even more astonishing as far as artistic attainments of the workshops are concerned; animation students accompanied by professional teachers introduced young students of [[Hermoupolis]] to how the art of animation is executed and produced small samples of animation work.&lt;ref&gt;http://flix.gr/news/animasyros-70.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Animasyros7 awards were given as follows:

In 2014 the festival was accompanied by special tributes targeted both to raise the awareness of the public opinion and to disseminate the perspective of the big schools of European animation to the festival’s audience. The festival honored in 2014 women creators as well as the female element in the art of animation. Therefore, a tribute to gender equality was carried out under the auspices of the General Secretariat for Gender Equality and the American Embassy in [[Athens]]. The tribute entitled “Woman in Anima” included movies screenings by internationally renowned artist [[Signe Baumane]], whose work is focused on modern woman issues, such as the recently awarded film “Rocks in my pockets”, as well as movies like “Sita sings the blues” by [[Nina Paley]]. Furthermore, the festival hosted this year special and enriched tributes with European orientation. With the support of the Institut Francais de Athenes (IFA), the festival realized a tribute to the great creator of animation movies Jacques-Rémy Girerd, founder of the famous studio [[Folimage]]. With reference to the north of Europe other significant events were also held within the festival; the tribute to [[Animafest Zagreb]] from [[Croatia]], which since its establishment in 1972 is the second oldest animation festival in [[Europe]], as well as the tributes to [[Tallinn]] [[Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival|Black Nights Film Festival]] and to Animated Dreams sub-festival, which both count more than fifteen years of active presence and come from the particularly active in [[animation]] production country of [[Estonia]].

== Animasyros and European Cultural Capital 2021 Project ==
In the summer of 2014 the first contacts between Animasyros and local authorities of [[Syros]] began in order to discuss the possibility of Animasyros involvement in the preparation proceedings of the nomination of the Municipality of Syros as [[Cultural Capital of Europe]] 2021. In October 2014, an official task group was created with the participation of the local authorities as well as institutions linked to cultural and touristic affairs, so as a nomination proposal entitled “Syros- Cyclades 2021 – [[Cultural Capital of Europe]]” to be formed. Animasyros became part of this group and now works towards drafting and promoting the nomimation, recognizing the uniqueness of Hermoupolis as well as of the whole archipelago as an integral monument of European cultural reference.&lt;ref&gt;https://diavgeia.gov.gr/search?query=q:%22animasyros%22&amp;page=1&amp;sort=relative&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Animasyros strongly supports every initiative taken by the Municipality in its effort to get the historic site of Hermoupolis and the medieval settlement of [[Ano Syros]] included in the [[Unesco]] [[World Heritage List]] as the 18th Greek monument.

'''Arthur's Day''' was an annual series of music events worldwide, originally organised by [[Diageo]] in 2009 to promote the 250th anniversary of its [[Guinness]] brewing company.

The 2009 events took place, internationally, in the cities of [[Dublin]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Lagos]], New York and [[Yaoundé]] on 23 September 2009. The event was broadcast internationally on [[Sky Digital (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky TV]],
[[ITV2]] and [[DirecTV]].&lt;ref name="GUINNESS Announces Further Details for Arthur's Day Global Celebrations"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Coughlan|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS186320+08-Sep-2009+PRN20090908|title=GUINNESS Announces Further Details for Arthur's Day Global Celebrations|date=8 September 2009|accessdate=12 September 2009|agency=Reuters  }}&lt;/ref&gt; €6 million was pledged to the Arthur Guinness Fund at the time.&lt;ref name="GUINNESS Announces Further Details for Arthur's Day Global Celebrations"/&gt; The so-called celebration was endorsed by several high-profile names, such as rock star-turned political activist [[Bob Geldof]], director and screenwriter [[Guy Ritchie]], footballer and Guinness football ambassador for Africa [[Michael Essien]] and British celebrities such as [[Peter Crouch]] and [[Sophie Dahl]].&lt;ref name="Celebrated by celebrities— and [[Siebel]] expert Bryan Cantwell.

Notable high-profile names who later spoke out against Arthur's day include: director [[Lenny Abrahamson]], singer-songwriter [[Christy Moore]], and musician [[Mike Scott (musician)|Mike Scott]] of [[The Waterboys]]. The event was also dubbed "Diageo Day" by [[The Huffington Post]] to promote a boycott of the event.&lt;ref name="Boycott Guinness on Arthur's Day -- or Should That Be Diageo Day?"&gt;{{cite web|author=Rory Fitzgerald|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rory-fitzgerald/boycott-guinness-on-arthu_b_1916921.html|title=Boycott Guinness on Arthur's Day – or Should That Be "Diageo Day"?|date=26 September 2012|accessdate=21 September 2013|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal College of Physicians Ireland highlighted a 30% increase in ambulance call-outs on each successive Arthur's Day and a doubling in alcohol-related liver disease over the previous decade, associated with drink promotion and the relative cheapness of alcohol.&lt;ref name="Doctors slam 'Arthur's Day' as drink-related deaths rise"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lyndsey Telford|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/doctors-slam-arthurs-day-as-drinkrelated-deaths-rise-29598566.html|title=Doctors slam 'Arthur's Day' as drink-related deaths rise|date=23 September 2013|work=The Irish Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guinness drinkers were asked by the brewing company to raise a glass to the memory of [[Arthur Guinness]] at 17:59 (5:59&amp;nbsp;pm), a reference to 1759, the year the Guinness Brewery was established.&lt;ref name="Beaumont pint would make Arthur turn in his grave"&gt;{{cite web|author=Roddy L'Estrange|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2009/0812/1224252419950.html|title=Beaumont pint would make Arthur turn in his grave|date=12 August 2009|accessdate=12 September 2009|work=The Irish Times |quote=There were ads on, one of which he'd seen before.

The last Arthur's Day was held in 2013. Guinness cancelling the event in 2014. A new music programme to help emerging artists in Ireland called ''Guinness Amplify'' was launched to replace the event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0702/628069-guinness/|title= Guinness cancels Arthur's Day after five years|date=3 July 2014|work=RTÉ News|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dailyedge.ie/arthurs-day-axed-guinness-amplify-1550182-Jul2014/|title= Arthur’s Day axed: Guinness confirms celebration will not be returning|date=3 July 2014|work=Daily Edge|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
The event was criticised as a marketing ploy to increase sales of Guinness with Arthur's day, without understanding or appreciation for the sense of nostalgia and meaning behind the "Black Stuff" that the event promoted according to Diageo. Diageo also claimed that Arthur's Day was held on a Thursday, rather than an accurate yearly basis on the original date. Thursday was chosen according to Diageo as Thursdays were the traditional "student night" in Dublin and many towns in Ireland.&lt;ref name="We're buying into cheap marketing ploys"&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Clifford|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0828/1224253402209.html|title=We're buying into cheap marketing ploys|date=24 September 2011|accessdate=24 September 2011|work=The Irish Times |quote=In reality, it is a cynical marketing ploy by the international drinks firm, Diageo, which owns Guinness. [...] "In reality, it is a cynical marketing ploy by the international drinks firm, Diageo, which owns Guinness."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Irish Times]]'' has described Arthur's Day as "a masterclass in how to fabricate a national holiday" with its "''[[à la carte]]'' attitude to traditional holidays"&amp;nbsp;– noting its countdown to one minute before six (recalling New Year's Eve), "the faux-patriotism that comes with a celebration of a "national" drink" and the "[[hagiography|hagiographic]] treatment" of Arthur Guinness as some kind of [[saint]]. The paper warned, "If St Patrick's Day, Christmas, and Hallowe'en are festivals that offer an excuse for a drink, Diageo has flipped the concept on its head and made the drink an excuse for a festival".&lt;ref name=fabrication_and_libation&gt;{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Griffin|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0927/breaking50.html|title=Arthur's Day: fabrication and libation|newspaper=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=27 September 2012|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, a Social Media campaign entitled 'Boycott Arthur's Day' began claiming national and international attention. Irish &amp; International Artists and Musicians have given their support to the campaign which calls on Irish Citizens to 'Say NO to Diageo's boozefest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://alcoholireland.ie/home_news/boycott-guinness-on-arthurs-day-or-should-that-be-diageo-day/|title= Boycott Guinness on Arthur's Day – or Should That Be "Diageo Day"?|date=September 2013|work=Alcohol Ireland|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 24 September, a live studio debate which included Guinness executive Peter O'Brien was held on Prime Time on [[RTÉ One]] discussing the pros and cons of Arthur's day. Singer [[Christy Moore]] released a single to mark the occasion which he performed on Prime Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/guinness-exec-wont-visit-ae-29607994.html|title= Guinness exec won't visit A&amp;E|date=25 September 2013|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/eilis-ohanlon-we-didnt-need-any-arthurs-day-to-lure-us-into-heavy-drinking-29604284.html|title= We didn't need any Arthur's Day to lure us into heavy drinking|date=24 September 2013|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arthur Porter Peterson''' (November 21, 1858 – March 16, 1895) was a lawyer and politician of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. He served two separate terms as [[Attorney General of Hawaii]] and was a member of Queen [[Liliuokalani]]'s last cabinet before the [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]]. He was arrested and jailed by the [[Republic of Hawaii]] in the aftermath of the [[1895 Counter-revolution in Hawaii|1895 Counter-Revolution]] and then exiled to [[San Francisco]] where he died of [[pneumonia]].

== Early life ==
Peterson was born November 21, 1858 in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], of Puritan heritage. His parents were Daniel Porter Peterson and Jerusha Morey Clark. In 1870, at the age of eleven, he and his family settled in the Hawaiian Islands. He was educated at [[Punahou School]] in [[Honolulu]], and returned to the United States where he graduated from [[University of Michigan Law School]]. He was admitted to the [[Plymouth County, Massachusetts|Plymouth County]] bar and started his law practice in [[Boston]]. While in Boston, he also helped established, with William E. Chase, a local newspaper called ''The Daily Bee''.&lt;ref name="Puritan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Peterson Known In Plymouth – Early History on One of the Hawaiian Revolutionists|newspaper=The New York Times|location=New York City|date=January 23, 1895|volume=|issue=|page=|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1895/01/23/archives/peterson-known-in-plymouth-early-history-on-one-of-the-hawaiian.html|accessdate=November 12, 2016}}; {{cite news|title=Of Puritan Stock – Political Prisoner Known in a Venerable Yankee Town|newspaper=The Hawaiian Star|location=Honolulu|date=February 12, 1895|volume=III|issue=579|page=3|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015415/1895-02-12/ed-1/seq-3/|accessdate=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StarDeath"&gt;{{cite news|title=Arthur P.

==Career in Hawaii==
After returning to Hawaii, he served as Deputy Attorney General under Attorneys General [[Antone Rosa]] and [[Clarence W. Ashford]] for two years and retired in March 1890, to return to private law practice. In April 1890, he was appointed Notary Public for the First Judicial Circuit of the Kingdom.&lt;ref name="StarDeath"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Molteno Case|newspaper=The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|location=Honolulu|date=March 22, 1887|volume=VI|issue=68|page=3|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1887-03-22/ed-1/seq-3/|accessdate=November 12, 2016}}; {{cite news|title=Local and General|newspaper=The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|location=Honolulu|date=March 22, 1890|volume=XI|issue=69|page=3|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1890-03-22/ed-1/seq-3/|accessdate=November 12, 2016}}; {{cite news|title=Local and General|newspaper=The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|location=Honolulu|date=April 2, 1890|volume=XI|issue=78|page=3|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1890-04-02/ed-1/seq-3/|accessdate=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1890, King [[Kalakaua]] appointed him [[Attorney General of Hawaii]] as a part of the [[John Adams Cummins|Cummins]] Cabinet, a position he held from June 17, 1890 to February 25, 1891.&lt;ref name="PetersonRecords"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/import/import/Government%20Office%20Holders%20-%20Name%20IMJ/P/Peterson,%20Arthur%20P.jpg |title=Peterson, Arthur P. office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate=June 17, 2014 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1893Cabinets"&gt;{{cite news|title=A New Cabinet – Some New Ministers for the Public to Swallow|newspaper=The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|location=Honolulu|date=January 14, 1893|volume=XVII|issue=3277|page=4|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1893-01-14/ed-1/seq-4/|accessdate=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1891, Kalākaua died while abroad in [[California]] and his sister ascended to the throne as Queen [[Liliuokalani]]. After the accession of the new sovereign, it was customary for the hold-over cabinet of the deceased monarch to resign, but the Cummins Cabinet refused the queen's request for them to resign citing the [[1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii|1887 Constitution]] which only gave the [[Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii|legislature]] the power to the dismiss cabinet ministers. They asked for a ruling by the [[Hawaii Supreme Court]], and the justices (except for one dissenting opinion) ruled in favor of the queen's decision, and the ministers resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=476–478}}; {{harvnb|Allen|1982|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892, he was elected as a member of the House of Nobles for the island of [[Oahu]]. During the 1892–1893 legislative assembly, Peterson lost the respect of the ''[[haole]]'' (foreign) community when he became the only white legislator to vote for the lottery bill.{{sfn|Hawaii|Lydecker|1918|page=188}}{{sfn|Twigg-Smith|1998|page=354}} On January 13, 1893, Queen Liliuokalani re-appointed him as Attorney General to the final Parker Cabinet with [[Samuel Parker (Hawaii)|Samuel Parker]], [[William H. Cornwell]], and [[John F. Colburn]] after her previous cabinet was voted out by the legislature.&lt;ref name="PetersonRecords"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1893Cabinets"/&gt;{{sfn|Liliuokalani|1898|page=382}} She had chosen these men specifically to support her plan of promulgating a new constitution while the legislature was not in session.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=581–583}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She attempted to promulgate a [[Proposed 1893 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii|new constitution]], but Peterson and the rest of the cabinet were either opposed to or reluctant to sign the new constitution. Their opposition was one of the causes which ultimately led to her [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow]] by the [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]].{{sfn|Twigg-Smith|1998|page=354}} After the overthrow, Peterson and the rest of the Parker Cabinet were removed from office.{{sfn|Hawaii|Lydecker|1918|pages=178, 188}}

==Imprisonment, exile and death==
In between his political involvements Peterson continued his private practice in Honolulu and "was the acknowledged head of his profession in Hawaii having established for himself a reputation for ability and integrity excelled by none at the Hawaiian bar".&lt;ref name="CallDeath"/&gt; In the aftermath of the unsuccessful [[1895 Counter-revolution in Hawaii|1895 Counter-Revolution]], Peterson and other royalists were arrested and imprisoned by the forces loyal to the [[Republic of Hawaii]]. He was detained in Oahu Prison under conditions which later proved detrimental to his health. After his release, he was exiled along with former Attorney General [[Charles F. Creighton]] and other political dissidents to [[San Francisco]]. The conditions of his imprisonment weakened his physical health and Peterson died of [[pneumonia]] on March 16, 1895. According to Creighton, his last words were "I've got out of jail."&lt;ref name="Puritan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StarDeath"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CallDeath"/&gt; He was survived by his wife Nettie Lincoln Brown (1865–1953) and daughter Myra Peterson (1886–1973) who were residing in [[Onset, Massachusetts]] at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="Puritan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StarDeath"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ancestry"&gt;{{cite web|title=RootsWeb's WorldConnect Project: Boardman, Peterson, Savery, Bacon and other allied families|work=Ancestry.com|url=http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=loken409&amp;id=I00761|accessdate=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aurora x-plane 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|An artist's conception of the Aurora aircraft]]

'''Aurora''' was a rumored mid-1980s American [[reconnaissance aircraft]]. There is no substantial evidence that it was ever built or flown and it has been termed a [[myth]].&lt;ref name= asw&gt;[http://aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/recon/aurora "Aurora, Strategic Reconnaissance."]  ''AerospaceWeb.org.'' Retrieved: 17 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Aurora Myth." ''Aerospace Daily'', 9 October 1990, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] has consistently denied such an aircraft was ever built. Aviation and space reference site ''Aerospaceweb.org'' concluded, "The evidence supporting the Aurora is circumstantial or pure conjecture, there is little reason to contradict the government's position."&lt;ref name= asw /&gt;

Former [[Skunk Works]] director [[Ben Rich]] confirmed that "Aurora" was simply a myth in ''Skunk Works'', a book detailing his days as the director. Mr. Rich wrote that a young colonel working in [[the Pentagon]] arbitrarily assigned the name "Aurora" to the funding for the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2]] bomber design competition and somehow the name was leaked to the media.&lt;ref&gt;"Skunk Works" p. 309 Ben R. Rich and Leo Janos, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Others come to different conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;"Evidence Points to Stealth Spy Plane." ''High Technology Business'', April 1988, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, veteran [[black project]] watcher and aviation writer [[Bill Sweetman]] said, "Does Aurora exist? Years of pursuit have led me to believe that, yes, Aurora is most likely in active development, spurred on by recent advances that have allowed technology to catch up with the ambition that launched the program a generation ago."&lt;ref name="secret"&gt;Sweetman, Bill. [http://www.popsci.com/popsci/aviationspace/95e16f096bd8d010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html "Secret Warplanes of Area 51."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706051254/http://www.popsci.com/popsci/aviationspace/95e16f096bd8d010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html |date= 6 July 2007 }} ''Popular Science,'' 4 June 2006. Retrieved: 1 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Aurora legend started in March 1990, when ''[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]'' magazine broke the news that the term "Aurora" had been inadvertently included in the 1985 U.S. budget, as an allocation of $455 million for "black aircraft production" in [[Fiscal year|FY]] 1987.&lt;ref name="aemann.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060823172040/http://www.aemann.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/aircraft/black/aurora/aurora5.htm "Aurora Timeline."] ''aemann.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk,'' 29 September 2006 via ''webarchive''. Retrieved: 17 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Aviation Week'', ''Project Aurora'' referred to a group of exotic aircraft, and not to one particular [[airframe]]. Funding of the project allegedly reached $2.3 billion in fiscal 1987, according to a 1986 procurement document obtained by ''Aviation Week''. In the 1994 book ''Skunk Works'', [[Ben Rich]], the former head of Lockheed's [[Skunk Works]] division, wrote that the Aurora was the budgetary code name for the stealth bomber fly-off that resulted in the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]].&lt;ref name="Skunk works"&gt;Rich and Janos 1996, pp. 309–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
By the late 1980s many aerospace industry observers{{who|date=August 2017}} believed that the U.S. had the technological capability to build a [[Mach number|Mach]] 5 ([[hypersonic speed]]) replacement for the aging [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird]]. Detailed examinations of the U.S. defense budget claimed to have found money missing or channeled into [[black project]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Skunk Works Revenues Point to Active Aurora Program, Kemper Says." ''Aerospace Daily'', 17 July 1992, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1990s reports surfaced of sightings of unidentified aircraft flying over California and the United Kingdom involving odd-shaped contrails, sonic booms, and related phenomena that suggested the US had developed such an aircraft. Nothing ever linked any of these observations to any program or aircraft type, but the name Aurora was often tagged on these as a way of explaining the observations.&lt;ref name= asw /&gt;

===British sighting claims===
In late August 1989, while working as an engineer on the jack-up barge ''GSF Galveston Key'' in the [[North Sea]], Chris Gibson and another witness saw an unfamiliar [[isosceles triangle]]-shaped delta aircraft, apparently refueling from a [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]] and accompanied by a pair of [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|F-111]] fighter-bombers. Gibson and his girlfriend watched the aircraft for several minutes, until they went out of sight. He subsequently drew a sketch of the formation.

When the sighting was made public in 1992, the British [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]] [[Tom King, Baron King of Bridgwater|Tom King]] was told, "There is no knowledge in the MoD of a 'black' programme of this nature, although it would not surprise the relevant desk officers in the Air Staff and Defence Intelligence Staff if it did exist."&lt;ref&gt;Randerson, James. [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/jun/24/freedomofinformation.usnews "Is it a bird? Is it a spaceship? No, it's a secret US spy plane."] ''The Guardian,'' 24 June 2006. Retrieved: 17 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A crash at [[MoD Boscombe Down|RAF Boscombe Down]] in [[Wiltshire]] on 26 September 1994 appeared closely linked to "black" missions, according to a report in ''AirForces Monthly''. Further investigation was hampered by aircraft from the USAF flooding into the base. The crash site was protected from view by fire engines and tarpaulins and the base was closed to all flights soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dreamlandresort.com/black_projects/boscombe.htm "RAF Boscombe Down's Black Day."] ''dreamlandresort.com.'' Retrieved: 22 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

An unsubstantiated claim on the Horsted Keynes Village Web Site purports to show photos of the trail left after an unusual sonic boom was heard over the village in July 2002. In 2005 the information was used in a BBC report about the Aurora project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horstedkeynes.com/aurora.html|title=Spy Plane Over Horsted Keynes|work=horstedkeynes.com|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. sighting claims===
A series of unusual [[sonic boom]]s was detected in [[Southern California]] beginning in mid-to-late 1991 and recorded by [[United States Geological Survey]] [[seismometer|sensor]]s across Southern California used to pinpoint [[earthquake]] [[epicenter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Edmund. [http://articles.latimes.com/1992-04-17/local/me-607_1_spy-plane "Secret Is Out on 'Quakes': It's a Spy Plane"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 17 April 1992. Retrieved: 29 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The sonic booms were characteristic of a smaller vehicle, rather than of the 37-meter long [[Space Shuttle orbiter]]. Furthermore, neither the Shuttle nor [[NASA]]'s single SR-71B was operating on the days the booms had been registered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.area51zone.com/aircraft/aurora.shtml "Aurora."] ''area51zone.com,'' 29 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, ''"In Plane Sight?"'' which appeared in the ''[[Washington City Paper]]'' on 3 July 1992 (pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13), one of the seismologists, Jim Mori, noted: "We can't tell anything about the vehicle. They seem stronger than other sonic booms that we record once in a while. They've all come on Thursday mornings about the same time, between 4 and 7."&lt;ref name="aemann.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk"/&gt; Former NASA [[sonic boom]] expert Dom Maglieri studied the 15-year-old sonic boom data from the [[California Institute of Technology]] and has deemed that the data showed "something at 90,000&amp;nbsp;ft (c. 27&amp;nbsp;km), Mach 4 to Mach 5.2". He also said the booms did not look like those from aircraft that had traveled through the atmosphere many miles away at [[Los Angeles International Airport]], rather, they appeared to be booms from a high-altitude aircraft directly above the ground moving at high speeds.&lt;ref&gt;Sweetman, Bill. [http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/blogs/defense/index.jsp?plckController=Blog&amp;plckScript=blogScript&amp;plckElementId=blogDest&amp;plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3A27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7Post%3A3b8e5ffb-467d-4030-9b63-d3f52cea5a4e "Boom, Why Does O.C. Go Boom?"] ''Aviation Weekly,'' 29 November 2010. Retrieved: 22 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The boom signatures of the two different aircraft patterns are wildly different.&lt;ref name="secret" /&gt; There was nothing particular to tie these events to any aircraft, but they served to increase the number of stories about the Aurora.

On 23 March 1992, near [[Amarillo, Texas]], Steven Douglass photographed the "donuts on a rope" [[contrail]] and linked this sighting to distinctive sounds. He described the engine noise as: "strange, loud pulsating roar... unique... a deep pulsating rumble that vibrated the house and made the windows shake... similar to rocket engine noise, but deeper, with evenly timed pulses." In addition to providing the first photographs of the distinctive contrail previously reported by many, the significance of this sighting was enhanced by Douglass' reports of intercepts of radio transmissions: "Air-to-air communications... were between an AWACS aircraft with the call sign "Dragnet 51" from [[Tinker Air Force Base|Tinker AFB]], [[Oklahoma]], and two unknown aircraft using the call signs "Darkstar November" and "Darkstar Mike". Messages consisted of phonetically transmitted alphanumerics. It is not known whether this radio traffic had any association with the "pulser" that had just flown over Amarillo." ("Darkstar" is also a call sign of [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]] aircraft from a different squadron at Tinker AFB)&lt;ref&gt;''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology'', 11 May 1992, pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, radio enthusiasts in California monitoring [[Edwards Air Force Base|Edwards AFB]] Radar (callsign "Joshua Control") heard early morning radio transmissions between Joshua and a high flying aircraft using the callsign "Gaspipe". "You're at 67,000 feet, 81 miles out" was heard, followed by "70 miles out now, 36,000 ft, above glideslope." As in the past, nothing linked these observations to any particular aircraft or program, but the attribution to the Aurora helped expand the legend.

In February 1994, a former resident of Rachel, Nevada, and Area 51 enthusiast, Chuck Clark, claimed to have filmed the Aurora taking off from the [[Area 51|Groom Lake facility]]. In the David Darlington book ''[[Area 51: The Dreamland Chronicles]]'', he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I even saw the Aurora take off one night – or an aircraft that matched the Aurora's reputed configuration, a sharp delta with twin tails about a hundred and thirty feet long. It taxied out of a lighted hangar at two-thirty A.M. and used a lot of runway to take off. It had one red light on top, but the minute the wheels left the runway, the light went off and that was the last I saw of it. I didn't hear it because the wind was blowing from behind me toward the base." I asked when this had taken place. "February 1994. Obviously they didn't think anybody was out there. It was thirty below zero – probably ninety below with the wind chill factor. I had hiked into White Sides from a different, harder way than usual, and stayed there two or three days among the rocks, under a camouflage tarp with six layers of clothes on. I had an insulated face mask and two sleeping bags, so I didn't present a heat signature. I videotaped the aircraft through a telescope with a five-hundred-millimeter f4 lens coupled via a C-ring to a high-eight digital video camera with five hundred and twenty scan lines of resolution, which is better than TV." The author then asked, "Where's the tape?" "Locked away. That's a legitimate spyplane; my purpose is not to give away legitimate national defense. When they get ready to unveil it, I'll probably release the tape."&lt;ref&gt;Darlington, David. ''Area 51: The Dreamland Chronicles''. New York, NY: Henry Holt &amp; Company, Inc. 1997. {{ISBN|0-8050-4777-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Additional claims===
&lt;!-- Please do not add pop culture items here. If they are properly referenced they can be added to [[Aircraft in fiction]] or [[List of fictional aircraft]] as per [[WP:AIRPOP]]. --&gt;

By 1996, reports associated with the Aurora name dropped off in frequency, suggesting to people who believed that the aircraft existed that it had only ever been a prototype or that it had had a short service life.&lt;ref name= asw /&gt;

In 2000, ''[[The Press and Journal (Scotland)|Aberdeen Press and Journal]]'' writer Nic Outterside wrote a piece on US stealth technology in Scotland. Citing confidential "sources", he alleged [[RAF Machrihanish|RAF/USAF Machrihanish]] in Kintyre, Argyll to be a base for Aurora aircraft. Machrihanish's almost {{convert |2|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} long runway makes it suitable for high-altitude and experimental aircraft with the fenced-off coastal approach making it ideal for takeoffs and landings to be made well away from eyes or cameras of press and public.  "Oceanic Air Traffic Control at Prestwick," Outterside says, "also tracked fast-moving radar blips. It was claimed by staff that a 'hypersonic jet was the only rational conclusion' for the readings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2002/04/27889.html |title=Latest U.S. Stealth Technology Moves to Western Scotland|publisher= Indy media |accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, aviation writer Bill Sweetman put together 20 years of examining budget "holes", unexplained sonic booms, as well as the Gibson sighting and concluded:

{{Quote |This evidence helps establish the program's initial existence. My investigations continue to turn up evidence that suggests current activity. For example, having spent years sifting through military budgets, tracking untraceable dollars and code names, I learned how to sort out where money was going. This year, when I looked at the Air Force operations budget in detail, I found a $9-billion black hole that seems a perfect fit for a project like Aurora.&lt;ref name="secret" /&gt;}}

In June 2017, ''Aviation Week'' reported that Rob Weiss, the General Manager of the Skunk Works, provided some confirmation of a research project and stated that hypersonic technology was now mature, and efforts were underway to fly an aircraft with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/defense/skunk-works-hints-sr-72-demonstrator-progress |title= Skunk Works Hints At SR-72 Demonstrator Progress |work = Aviation Week|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bālijātrā''' (also Bōita Bandāṇa) literally means '''''A Voyage to [[Bali]]'''''. This festival is held in [[Odisha]] (a state in eastern [[India]]), in the city of [[Cuttack]] at ''Gadagadia Ghata'' of the [[Mahanadi]] river, to mark the day when ancient [[Sadhaba]]s (Oriya mariners) would set sail to distant lands of [[Bali]], as well as [[Java]] (at the time of the voyage known as "Yawadvipa"), [[Sumatra]], [[Borneo]] (all in [[Indonesia]]), and [[Sri Lanka]] (formerly Ceylon) for trade and cultural expansion. To commemorate this, the festival is celebrated every year from the day of Kartika Purnima (full moon day of the month of Kartika) according to the Oriya Calendar. 

On Kartika Purnima, which comes around the end of October and November, people of Odisha gather near banks of [[Mahanadi]], [[Brahmani river]], other river banks, ponds, water tanks and sea shores to float miniature toy boats, made of colored paper, dried banana tree barks, and cork, as a symbolic gesture of their ancestors' voyage. These toy boats, usually launched early in the morning contain traditional paan and small oil lamps, which are lit and placed inside them, to provide an attractive sight during the festival. People sing a song ''Aa ka ma boi, pan gua thoi...'' to remember the early [[maritime history of Odisha]]. The song tells about four months that are important for marine merchants of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] (the earlier name of Odisha). This festival is also celebrated with great fanfare in [[Paradeep]]. Bali Jatra bears testimony to the rich maritime legacy of ancient Odisha. This is the specific time that was considered auspicious by the Sadhabas to begin their voyage in vessels called [[Boita]]s. The voyage is begun on ''Kartika Purnima'' to take advantage of the favorable wind blowing during this time. ''Ajhala'' or big fabric sails were used to harness the wind power to move the ''Boitas''.

Bali Jatra is also associated with ''Taapoi'' and rituals like ''Bhalukuni Osha'' or ''Khudurukuni Osha'' and ''Bada Osha''. ''Taapoi'' is closely associated with the Bali Jatra festival, which recalls traditional memories of young maidens waiting for the return of their sailor brothers. 

In Cuttack, Bali Jatra is celebrated annually as a large open fair near the [[Barabati Fort]] area. It is said to be the largest fair of Asia. There are several attractions for children like toy stalls, giant wheels, differnts games, maut ka kuan (literally well of death) and food stalls selling Oriya delicacies (''Cuttack Dahivada Aludum'', ''Thunka puri'', ''Kulfi'', ''Gupchup'', ''Mathura Cake'', ''Banarasi Paan'' etc.) from different parts of the state, and other vendors selling toys, curiosities, and other gifts. Bali Jatra also provides a lot of cultural programs. Every year millions of people from all over the nation come to experience it.

The '''Battle of Harran''' took place on May 7, 1104 between the [[Crusader states]] of the  [[Principality of Antioch]] and the [[County of Edessa]], and the [[Seljuk Turks]]. It was the first major battle against the newfound Crusader states in the aftermath of the [[First Crusade]] marking a key turning point against [[Franks|Frankish]] expansion.&lt;ref&gt;The Crusades, C. 1071-c. 1291 By Jean Richard, Jean Birrell, pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt;  The battle had a disastrous effect on the [[Principality of Antioch]] as the Turks regained territory earlier lost.&lt;ref&gt;''The Story of the Crusades'' by [[Thomas Andrew Archer]], [[Charles Lethbridge Kingsford]], [[Henry Edward Watts]], pg. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In 1104 [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II of Edessa]] had attacked and besieged the city of [[Harran]]. For his further support Baldwin sought help from [[Bohemond I of Antioch]] and [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee]]. Bohemond and Tancred marched north from [[Antioch]] to [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] to join with Baldwin and [[Joscelin I, Count of Edessa|Joscelin of Courtenay]], accompanied by Bernard of Valence the [[Latin Patriarch of Antioch|Patriarch of Antioch]], [[Daimbert of Pisa]] the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]], and [[Benedict (archbishop of Edessa)|Benedict]], the Archbishop of Edessa. 

The Seljuks, under [[Jikirmish]], governor of [[Mosul]], and Sokman, the [[Ortoqid|Artuqid]] lord of [[Mardin]], gathered in the area of the Khabur, perhaps at Ra's al-'ain (Hellenistic Rhesaina).  In May 1104 they attacked Edessa, perhaps to distract the crusaders from Harran, perhaps to take the city while the crusaders were elsewhere engaged.

==The battle==

According to [[Ibn al-Qalanisi]], Tancred and Bohemund arrived at Edessa during the siege, but according to ''[[Chronicle of 1234]]'' they arrived first at the gates of Harran.  In any case, the Seljuks rode away from the crusaders, [[feigned retreat|feigning a retreat]] and the crusaders followed.

The Seljuks [[feigned retreat]] in the preliminary skirmishes while the Crusaders continued their pursuit south. The contemporary chronicler Matthew of Edessa reports a pursuit of two days while [[Ralph of Caen]] reports three days.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Bachrach|Bacharach]], p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ibn al-Athir]], the main battle was fought twelve kilometres from Harran.

Most historians accept the accounts of [[Albert of Aachen]] and [[Fulcher of Chartres]], who located the battle on the plain (''planitie'') opposite the city of [[Raqqa]], Raqqa being  about two days away from Harran. 

Baldwin and Joscelin commanded the Edessan left wing while Bohemond and Tancred commanded the Antiochene right.&lt;ref&gt;Although Ralph of Caen says that Tancred commanded the middle (Bacharach, p. 165)&lt;/ref&gt;  Ralph of Caen says that the crusaders were caught unawares when the Seljuks turned to fight, so much so that Baldwin and Bohemond fought without armor. 

During the battle itself, Baldwin's troops were completely routed, with Baldwin and Joscelin captured by the Turks.&lt;ref&gt;The Crusades: The Story of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem By Thomas Andrew Archer, Charles Lethbridge Kingsford, pg. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The Antiochene troops along with Bohemond were able to escape to Edessa. However, Jikirmish had only taken a small amount of booty, so he purloined Baldwin from Sokman's camp. Although a ransom was paid, Joscelin and Baldwin were not released until sometime before 1108, and 1109 respectively.

==Significance==

The battle was one of the first decisive Crusader defeats with severe consequences to the [[Principality of Antioch]].&lt;ref&gt;The Crusades, C. 1071-c. 1291 By Jean Richard, Jean Birrell, pg. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Byzantine Empire]] took advantage of the defeat to impose their claims on Antioch, and recaptured [[Latakia]] and parts of [[Cilicia]]. Many of the towns ruled by Antioch revolted and were re-occupied by Muslim forces from Aleppo. [[Armenia]]n territories also revolted in favour of the Byzantines or Armenia. Furthermore, these events caused Bohemund to return to Italy to recruit more troops, leaving Tancred as regent of Antioch.

[[William of Tyre]] wrote that there was no battle more disastrous than this. Although Antioch recovered by the next year, the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Alexius I Comnenus]] imposed the [[Treaty of Devol]] on Bohemond, which would have made Antioch a [[vassal]] of the empire had Tancred agreed to it. Antioch was again crushed at the [[Battle of Ager Sanguinis]] in 1119; Edessa never really recovered and survived until 1144 but only because of divisions among the Muslims.

The '''Battle of Yanling''' ({{zh|t=鄢陵之戰}}) was fought in 575 BC between the states of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] and [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] at [[Yanling County, Henan|Yanling]] during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] of ancient China. On the Jin side, [[Xi Qi]] (郤錡) commanded the right wing whilst [[Luan Shu]] (欒書) commanded the center with [[Han Jue]] (韓厥) on the left . Prior to the battle, Shi Xie wanted to avoid battle on the basis that external enemies are necessary for internal peace. The Chu army had the numerical advantage but with the exception of the King's personal guard, it was in poor condition. The Chu army was also commanded by [[Zifan]] (子反) and [[Zichong]] (子重), who hated each other. Following Luan Shu's advice, the Jin army took a defensive posture instead of going on the offensive. By dawn the Jin armies were deployed behind a marsh and ditch, which impeded Chu troops. Fen Huang, a Jin officer, pointed out that the best Chu troops in the center was bogged down by the marsh, leaving the flanks to be held only by badly disciplined 'wild tribes of the south'. Jin [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariot]]s then charged both Chu flanks, scattering the enemy. They then proceeded to attack the center, which contained the Chu King commanding his troops. Although the Chu King's life was endangered a couple of times, Jin officers let him escape as a sign of respect. However, he was wounded by an arrow and his army was driven back.&lt;ref&gt;Imperial Chinese Military History: 8000 BC –1912 AD, Marvin C Whiting(Writers Club Press), pp 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27666">''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]'' is a [[2010 in film|2010]] American [[psychological thriller]] film about a ballet dancer directed by [[Darren Aronofsky]] and starring [[Natalie Portman]], [[Vincent Cassel]], and [[Mila Kunis]]. After the [[83rd Academy Awards]], in which Portman won the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for her role in the film as a ballerina, controversy arose over how much credit for the dancing in the film was being given to her and how much to her "[[Body double|dance double]]", [[American Ballet Theatre]] [[soloist (ballet)|soloist]] [[Sarah Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://pointemagazine.com/issues/aprilmay-2010/call-board |title=Ballet All Over: Big Names in ''Black Swan'' |work=Pointe Magazine |publisher=Macfadden Performing Arts Media |author=Fuhrer, Margaret |date=April–May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rjYFGach?url=http://pointemagazine.com/issues/aprilmay-2010/call-board |archivedate=2010-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 3, 2011 blog post (written prior to the DVD release) for ''[[Dance Magazine]]'', its editor-in-chief [[Wendy Perron]] asked why a visual effects video clip showing Lane's face being replaced by Portman's was once available online but later removed from the [[Internet]] prior to the Oscars. She also speculated as to whether Portman's omission of Lane's name during her acceptance speech was a case of "forgetfulness in the heat of the moment? Or was this omission, and the deletion from the video, planned by the studio's publicity machine?"&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; It was also noted that Lane is credited as "Lady in the Lane" and as "Stunts" rather than as Portman's double in the theatrical release of the film.&lt;ref name=wsj1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pic-upload.de/view-9658538/vlcsnap-2011-04-19-22h31m40s63.png.html|title=Screenshot of film credits}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pic-upload.de/view-9658506/vlcsnap-2011-03-21-11h24m45s20.png.html|title=Screenshot of film credits}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a number of responses regarding Portman. Aronofsky and Fox Searchlight released a joint statement that argued: "We were fortunate to have Sarah there to cover the more complicated dance sequences and we have nothing but praise for the hard work she did. However, Natalie herself did most of the dancing featured in the final film."&lt;ref name=fs/&gt; [[Benjamin Millepied]] and Kunis also argued in defense of Portman's dancing. Lane responded through an essay published in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' (Portman declined through a representative to write one as well) and an interview on ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'' that her interest lies primarily in defense of ballet as an art form that cannot be mastered in a year.

The DVD of ''Black Swan'' was released on March 29, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Blu-ray-Natalie-Portman/dp/B0041KKYEW|publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |first=|last=|date=|title=''Black Swan''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes the featurette with Sarah Lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/blackswanbluray.php|publisher=DVD Verdict |first=Michael |last=Stailey|date=March 29, 2011|title=DVD Verdict Review:Black Swan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Before the Academy Awards ==
The film's director [[Darren Aronofsky]] stated in a July 2010 interview: "Most of these women who are here started dancing when they were 4, 5, or 6 years old. Their bodies are shaped differently because they started so young. She was able to pull it off. Except for the wide shots when she has to be [[pointe technique|en pointe]] for a real long time, it's Natalie on screen. I haven't used her double a lot."&lt;ref name="roles"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wloszczyna |first=Susan |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-blackswaninside22_ST_N.htm |title='Black Swan' stars step deftly into roles |work=[[USA Today]] |date=July 22, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5s9abMWwQ?url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-blackswaninside22_ST_N.htm |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another time when asked whether Portman did all the dancing, he replied "Not everything, but a lot of it. That shot, in the opening prologue when she walks off into the light and she’s flapping her wings, and she’s on pointe, that is 100%, untouched, no digital Natalie Portman. When the camera pulls out on her and she’s on top of the ramp and she’s bleeding, and she’s on pointe, right before she jumps—that is Natalie Portman en pointe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Thompson | first=Anne | url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/2010/09/15/interview_darren_aronofsky_talks_black_swan/ | title=Aronofsky Talks the "Nightmare" of Getting Black Swan Made | date=September 15, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522013204/http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/2010/09/15/interview_darren_aronofsky_talks_black_swan/ | archivedate=May 22, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 29, 2010 interview, Portman's other dance double, Kimberly Prosa, also added: "Natalie took class, she studied for several months, from the waist up is her. Sarah Lane a soloist at ABT, did the heavy tricks, she did the [[fouetté]]s, but they only had her for a limited time, a couple of weeks, so I did the rest of whatever dance shots they needed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/debra-levine/natalie-portmans-evil-twi_b_789564.html|publisher=HuffingtonPost|first=Debra |last=Levine|accessdate = January 29, 2011|title=Natalie Portman's evil twin, body-double Kimberly Prosa}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Portman said in an interview with [[MSN]]: "I did everything, and the dance double — Sarah Lane, who's a really wonderful dancer — they shot us both doing everything, but because most of the film is in close-up, they're able to use me. The parts I couldn't do were because it's doing very complicated turns en pointe. They would shoot me doing it in flat shoes and Sarah doing it in [[pointe shoes]] and find a way to make that work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamesrocchi.com/2010/11/natalie-portman-of-black-swan-i-did-everything/|publisher=MSN Movies|first=James|last=Rocchi|title=Natalie Portman of 'Black Swan': 'I did everything ...'}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also stated in a November 2010 interview with [[WBUR]] that "there's a wonderful dancer, Sarah Lane, who did the more complicated pointe work. But I did the stuff that was possible to learn in a year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/npr/131667596/to-become-a-black-swan-portman-had-t%20o-go-dark|publisher=WBUR|first=Tery|last=Gross|accessdate =November 30, 2010|title=To Become A 'Black Swan,' Portman Had To Go Dark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, Lane also gave an interview to Kina Poon of ''[[Dance Magazine]]'' in which she responds to the question "and how does it feel to be part of a performance that some critics are giving Natalie Portman rave reviews for?" by saying that "I'm not really looking for any sort of recognition. The process was a huge learning experience and I got everything I wanted out of it. But [Portman] deserves the recognition. She worked really hard."&lt;ref name=kp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dancemagazine.com/issues/December-2010/Quick-QA-Sarah-Lane |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205232123/http://www.dancemagazine.com/issues/December-2010/Quick-QA-Sarah-Lane |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-12-05 |publisher=[[Dance Magazine]] |first=Kina |last=Poon |date=December 2010 |accessdate=April 3, 2011 |title=Quick Q&amp;A: Sarah Lane }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Lane's involvement in ''Black Swan'' was also mentioned in two other dance magazines and in an article on ''[[The New York Times]]'' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pointemagazine.com/issues/decemberjanuary-2011/price-perfection|publisher=Pointe Magazine Online |first=Jennifer|last=Stahl|date=December 2010 – January 2011 |title= The Price of Perfection}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dancespirit.com/articles/2824 |publisher=Dancespirit Magazine |first=Holly Lynn |last=Fusco |date=December 1, 2010 |title=Black Swan: Behind the Scenes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520150541/http://dancespirit.com/articles/2824 |archivedate=May 20, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/arts/dance/28balletfilm.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1 |date=November 26, 2010 |title= Those Undulating Swan Arms?

== Perron's blog ==
After the [[83rd Academy Awards|Oscar ceremony]] on February 27, 2011 in which Portman won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] and where she thanked many people but didn't mention Lane,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eotm.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/natalie-portmans-acceptance-speech-83rd-annual-academy-awards/|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Awards Publicity|date=February 28, 2011 |title= Natalie Portman’s Acceptance Speech – (Transcript) 83rd Annual Academy Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; dancer and editor-in-chief of ''[[Dance Magazine]]'' [[Wendy Perron]] published a March 3, 2011 blog post in which she asks why a visual effects video clip showing Lane's face being replaced by Portman's was once available online but later removed from the [[Internet]] prior to the Oscars. She also speculates as to whether Portman deliberately didn't mention Lane, by asking if this was a case of "forgetfulness in the heat of the moment? Or was this omission, and the deletion from the video, planned by the studio's publicity machine?"&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; Perron also asks, "Do people really believe that it takes only one year to make a ballerina? We know that Natalie Portman studied ballet as a kid and had a year of intensive training for the film, but that doesn't add up to being a ballerina. However, it seems that many people believe that Portman did her own dancing in ''Black Swan''."&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dancemagazine.com/blogs/wendy/3733|publisher=[[Dance Magazine]] |first=Wendy |last=Perron |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=March 30, 2011 |title= Is There a Blackout on Black Swan's Dancing?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perron followed up the next week with a second blog post on the subject. She interviewed Lane who states that she did not expect to be named during Portman's acceptance speech because a Fox Searchlight producer had asked her to stop giving interviews until after the Oscars were over: "They were trying to create this façade that [Portman] had become a ballerina in a year and a half ... So I knew they didn't want to publicize anything about me." Perron then states that Lane "says she was more offended by that myth than any slight to her as a dancer who worked 'painstaking' hours on the set. She says she's talked to her colleagues about 'how unfortunate it is that, as professional dancers, we work so hard, but people can actually believe that it's easy enough to do it in a year. That's the thing that bothered me the most.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dancemagazine.com/blogs/admin-admin/3741 |publisher=[[Dance Magazine]] |first=Wendy |last=Perron |date=Mar 11, 2011 |title=Putting the Black Swan Blackout in Context? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323010817/http://www.dancemagazine.com/blogs/admin-admin/3741 |archivedate=2011-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

=== Millepied ===
[[Benjamin Millepied]] (Portman's husband and a principal dancer from New York City Ballet who debuted in ''Black Swan'' as both actor and choreographer)&lt;ref name="roles" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kourlas |first=Gia |url=http://www.vogue.com/feature/2009_December_On_The_Rise/ |date=December 2009 |title=On The Rise |work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] |oclc=320236642 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rjYER1oM?url=http://www.vogue.com/feature/2009_December_On_The_Rise/ |archivedate=August 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; responded to Perron's blog in a March 23 interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. He states in this interview that "there are articles now talking about her dance double [American Ballet Theatre dancer Sarah Lane] that are making it sound like [Lane] did a lot of the work, but really, she just did the footwork, and the [[Glossary of ballet#Fouetté|fouettés]], and one diagonal [phrase] in the studio. Honestly, 85% of that movie is Natalie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-black-swan-millepied-20110323,0,7797743.story|publisher=Los Angeles Times|first=Jean|last=Lenihan|accessdate=March 23, 2011|title=Choreographer Benjamin Millepied on life after 'Black Swan'|date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lane ===
Lane was then asked about the subject in a March 25 interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' to which she responded that "of the full body shots, I would say 5 percent are Natalie ... All the other shots are me."&lt;ref name=Markovitz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/03/25/portman-black-swan-double/ |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=Adam |last=Markovitz |date=March 25, 2011 |accessdate=March 26, 2011 |title='Black Swan' double claims Natalie Portman only did '5 percent' of full-body dance shots in the movie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview with [[Christopher John Farley]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Lane states that...
{{cquote|I did all of the dancing. Natalie and I alternated shots. They would do close-up shots with her, just of her face and kind of from her arms up. Then they would do the same shot with me, and then they would do a full body shot from far away, or a close-up of my feet, etc. And then there were a few shots they did that were closer full body shots and then they digitally put her face on my body.}}

This happened, she states, because only someone who has had years of training is able to perform in this manner. On the subject of whether she was being credited as she "deserves", she said, "Definitely not" and elaborates...
{{cquote|It was all my fault really because I didn't have a manager ... When I was going to sign my contract, it said on screen credit is up to the producer's discretion .... So I signed the contract and I left it. I thought they would kind of take care of me because they were really encouraging and really sweet and always saying how amazing I was. They were kind of rooting me on when I would have to do shots that were really hard and almost impossible even for a professional ballet dancer.}}

However, she states that her response to the issue of credit is being misrepresented as it is "kind of making me look greedy". Instead she was actually responding to Perron's blog about the possibility of a "cover-up"&lt;ref name=wsj1/&gt; and wanted to clarify that "I do want people to know that you cannot absolutely become a professional ballet dancer in a year and a half no matter how hard you work. I've been doing this for 22 years." Lane also reiterates that she was asked by producers to stop giving interviews until after the Oscars were over and as to why she thinks that happened, explained:
{{cquote|I had read a lot of articles that Natalie had done where she said she did 90 percent of the dancing. And never mentioned my name once. Nobody ever mentioned my name hardly ever. I'm not stupid, I got the idea that they really want to make it look like she [Portman] had accomplished something incredible.}}

Lane continued, "I do want people to know that she did work really hard. And she lost a lot of weight so that if you looked at her, you would say she could pass from the arms up as a dancer. She's an amazing actor. I can't act like that. But to say that she did all of the dancing is absolutely ridiculous to anyone that knows anything about ballet."&lt;ref name=wsj1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/03/26/natalie-portman%E2%80%99s-black-swan-dance-double-says-she-deserves-more-credit/|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=Christopher |last= Farley |date=March 26, 2011 |accessdate=March 30, 2011 |title=Natalie Portman's 'Black Swan' Dance Double Says She Deserves More Credit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aronofsky and Fox Searchlight ===
In response, people involved with the film (particularly Aronofsky) and Fox Searchlight disputed Lane's claim. They released statements that stated: "We were fortunate to have Sarah there to cover the more complicated dance sequences and we have nothing but praise for the hard work she did. However, Natalie herself did most of the dancing featured in the final film."&lt;ref name=fs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/03/26/black-swan-responds-cover-up/|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=Jeff |last=Labrecque|date=March 26, 2011 |accessdate=March 26, 2011 |title='Black Swan' controversy: 'Natalie herself did most of the dancing,' insist filmmakers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aronofsky stated in an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'':

:I had my editor count shots. There are 139 dance shots in the film. 111 are Natalie Portman untouched. 28 are her dance double Sarah Lane. If you do the math, that's 80% Natalie Portman. What about duration? The shots that feature the double are wide shots and rarely play for longer than one second. There are two complicated longer dance sequences that we used face replacement. Even so, if we were judging by time, over 90% would be Natalie Portman. And to be clear, Natalie did dance on pointe in pointe shoes. If you look at the final shot of the opening prologue, which lasts 85 seconds, and was danced completely by Natalie, she exits the scene on pointe. That is completely her without any digital magic. I am responding to this to put this to rest and to defend my actor. Natalie sweated long and hard to deliver a great physical and emotional performance. And I don't want anyone to think that's not her they are watching. It is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/03/28/darren-aronofsky-black-swan-controversy/|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=Adam |last=Markovitz|date=March 28, 2011 |accessdate=March 28, 2011 |title='Black Swan' director Darren Aronofsky defends Natalie Portman in body-double controversy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kunis ===
In addition, Portman's co-star in the film, [[Mila Kunis]], also gave an interview with ''Entertainment Weekly'' in which she said, "Natalie danced her ass off" and that "[Portman will] tell you [that], no, she was not on pointe when she did a fouetté [turn]. No one's going to deny that. But she did do every ounce of every one of her dances .... [Lane] wasn't used for everything. It was more like a safety net. If Nat wasn't able to do something, you'd have a safety net. The same thing that I had — I had a double as a safety net. We all did. No one ever denied it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/03/28/mila-kunis-black-swan-double/|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=Adam |last=Markovitz|date=March 28, 2011 |accessdate=April 3, 2011 |title=Mila Kunis blasts 'Black Swan' controversy: 'Natalie danced her a–– off.' -- EXCLUSIVE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perron ===
In an email exchange with Farley published on March 28 in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Wendy Perron stated, "the publicity department for Fox Searchlight, the studio behind the film, is just 'doing its job' in promoting Portman's work". She also noted: "'Natalie did most of the dancing where you see her in closeup, and she worked hard to make them convincing', Perron said via email. 'Obviously, the far shots plus the pirouettes and closeups on the feet were Sarah or another double.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/03/28/sarah-lane-and-natalie-portman-who-is-the-real-black-swan/|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=Christopher John|last=Farley|date=March 28, 2011|title=Who is the Real ‘Black Swan’?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lane and Portman further responses ==

=== Lane ''The Wall Street Journal'' essay ===
On March 30, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' published an essay by Lane on the subject. (It had asked both Portman and Lane to write about these events, but Portman declined through a representative.) Lane's essay, "My (Double) Life as A Black Swan", describes the life of a ballet dancer and concludes by stating:

:I know that some people are getting very defensive about ''Black Swan'' and my role in it, but back-stabbing is not my purpose when people ask me about the legitimacy of the dance shots in the movie. I only care to speak the truth. The truth is that no one, not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come anywhere close to the level of a professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. She is so talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in ''Black Swan''. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit that they deserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/03/30/dancing-around-the-truth-sarah-lane-on-black-swan/|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=Sarah |last= Lane |date=March 30, 2011 |accessdate=March 30, 2011 |title=My (Double) Life as a Black Swan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portman ''E!'' interview ===
In an April 6 interview with ''[[E!]],'' Natalie Portman responded to the question: "What do you want to say to people who are questioning your dancing in the film?" by stating: "I had a chance to make something beautiful with this film and I don't want to give in to the gossip".&lt;ref name =enp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b235053_Natalie_Portman_Dishes_on_the_Black_Swan_Ballet_Battle_.html|publisher=[[E!]] |first=Ted|last=Casablanca|date=April 6, 2011 |accessdate=April 6, 2011 |title='Natalie Portman Dishes on the Black Swan Ballet Battle!}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said, "I know what went on. We had an amazing experience making the movie. I don't want to tarnish it by entering into nastiness .... I'm really proud of everyone's work on the movie and of my experience. And I'll have that forever. So it's nice for me to always know about that, no matter what kind of nastiness or gossip is going around."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scoop.today.com/_news/2011/04/07/6425725-natalie-portman-dances-around-black-swan-controversy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410123042/http://scoop.today.com/_news/2011/04/07/6425725-natalie-portman-dances-around-black-swan-controversy|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 10, 2011|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|first=|last=|date=April 7, 2011|accessdate=April 7, 2011|title=Natalie Portman dances around 'Black Swan' controversy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a question regarding her Oscar acceptance speech, Portman responded, "I don't remember my Oscar speech at all, and I'm actually too embarrassed to watch it."&lt;ref name =enp/&gt;

=== Lane ''20/20'' interview ===
In an April 15 interview with [[Elizabeth Vargas]] for ABC's ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'', Lane stated: "I didn't really specify anything in my contract about getting onscreen credit or anything ... I didn't do the movie to get fame or recognition or anything."&lt;ref name=doubleabc2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/sarah-lane-natalie-portmans-black-swan-dance-double/story?id=13375693&amp;page=2|publisher=ABC News|first=OLIVIA|last=KATRANDJIAN|accessdate=April 15, 2011|title=Natalie Portman's 'Black Swan' Dance Double Claims Filmmakers Are 'Lying' (p.2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; She added, "I'm not speaking because I feel like I should be heralded .... I'm speaking because [the filmmakers] are completely lying about the amount of dancing Natalie did in the movie. When those incorrect things are coming out, and they threaten the entire principle of ballet, then I feel like I need to say something." When Vargas asked if it is possible that both interpretations of the "math" can be correct, Lane responded: "It's possible, like I said, if you're counting the close-ups of her face as actual dancing shots. But I don't call close-ups of her face actual dancing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/04/15/natalie-portman-black-swan-double-20-20-interview/|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=Adam B.|last=Vary|date=April 15, 2011 |accessdate=April 20, 2011 |title=Natalie Portman's 'Black Swan' double on '20/20': Filmmakers are 'completely lying'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Official2020/&gt;&lt;ref name=doubleabc/&gt; 

''20/20'' also asked ''Black Swan'' editor Andy Weisblum for his take on the math. He responded that "there are about 35 shots that are full body shots in the movie. Of those 35 shots, 12 are Natalie, and then the rest are Sarah. But over the overall film, Natalie did a lot more than that. I mean, she did most of the other shots. It was sometimes hard for me to tell the difference as the editor, it was so close."&lt;ref name=Official2020/&gt; Lane further reiterated the point that prior to the Oscar ceremony, she gave an interview with ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' for an article titled ''The Real Black Swan''. After this interview, a ''Black Swan'' producer contacted her: "He asked if I would please not do any more interviews until after the Oscars because it was bad for Natalie's image ... They were trying to create this image, this facade, really, that Natalie had done something extraordinary. Something that is pretty much impossible ... to become a professional ballerina in a year and half." Lane also emphasized that her criticism was not directed at Portman's acting: "I think she is a really beautiful actress ... I loved working with her. And she was really focused on her character every day. I definitely think she deserves all the credit that she got with the Oscar."&lt;ref name=Official2020&gt;{{Cite web

=== Dance Channel TV Network interview ===
In another interview for the Dance Channel network, Lane was asked, "Looking back and having experienced what you had and deciding to talk about what happened, would you do ''Black Swan'' again?" Her answer was, "Yeah, I would."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCN4nOO4jvs|publisher=Dance Channel TV Network|first=Stuart |last=Brazell |accessdate=2011-06-17|title=Meet Sarah Lane, ABT soloist and infamous "Black Swan" ballerina }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11221">'''CUC (Comp-U-Card) International Inc.''' was a membership-based consumer services conglomerate with travel, shopping, auto, dining, home improvement and financial services offered to more than 60 million customers worldwide based out of [[Stamford, Connecticut]] and founded by [[Kirk Shelton]] and [[Walter Forbes]]. In 1998, it became involved in a [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] investigation into what, at the time, was the biggest [[Accounting scandals|accounting scandal]] in corporate history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr16910.htm SEC press release on bringing civil suits against Forbes and Shelton]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Their main product, a shopping service, originally a [[wiktionary:Membership|membership]] telephone-based [[Drop shipping|drop-ship]] service called Comp-U-Card begun in 1973, was made available online to users of [[The Source (online service)|The Source]] in the mid-1980s, and later [[CompuServe]] after its purchase of The Source. It later offered its Shoppers Advantage service on [[America Online]], [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], [[GEnie]] and [[Delphi online service|Delphi]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEEDC1439F931A35753C1A963958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all On-Line Middleman Opens for Business]&lt;/ref&gt; It was perhaps the first company conducting [[electronic commerce]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/02/business/deal-brings-marketing-to-the-fore.html Deal Brings Marketing To the Fore]&lt;/ref&gt; although its web based service first went online in 1995.

Founded in 1973 by Walter Forbes, CUC's main line of operations was its mail-order clubs such as Shopper’s Advantage, AutoVantage, Traveler’s Advantage, and its Comp-U-Card program, and had been trying to find a way to streamline its clubs and sell retail through a kind of interactive televisions. In an age before the internet and sites such as Amazon.com, this idea was innovative.

CUC went through various company presidents and lost a lot of money during the ‘70’s and by 1979 was losing more than $2 million a year{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}. By 1983, Forbes and his company had found investors such as [[Reader's Digest]] and [[Eckerd Drugs]] but had lost nearly $14 million. After licensing their “interactive shopping” idea in Europe, the [[Morgan Stanley]] group took CUC public in the United States in 1983 and raised $20 million.

Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, CUC continued to grow and acquire other companies. They made strategic deals with other entertainment, communication, retail and investment companies such as America Online and AT&amp;T.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} and grew to have over 30 million customers via their mail order clubs.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  CUC never made any large acquisitions until 1995.  Prior to that time, all acquisitions were relatively small and strategic.

In February 1996, seeking to expand its operations into the field of interactive entertainment, CUC approached software companies [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line Inc.]] and [[Davidson &amp; Associates|Davidson &amp; Associates Inc.]] They bought Sierra for $1.5 billion and Davidson for $1.6 billion, both in stock.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} These acquisitions allowed CUC, as a larger outlet, to streamline its distribution network. In addition, product placements and advertisements in these software companies’ products allowed CUC to find new customers in demographics it had not reached before. 

In December 1997, CUC merged with [[HFS Incorporated]]. A competition was held internally at CUC, primarily among their senior marketing staff but open to all employees, to come up with a new corporate name. The winner was to receive dinner "anywhere in the world".  No employee submission was selected to win, as the name of the company had already been decided.  The new company was named [[Cendant]].
After the merger, Cendant retained its core business as a direct marketer and thereafter also specialized in Hotel Franchises, Car Rentals, Travel agencies, and its consumer software operations, Cendant Software. The merger of these two companies, which between them owned "a virtual monopoly in the worldwide market for full-service timeshare exchange services," according to the [[Federal Trade Commission]], caused the FTC to require "the parties to divest one of their timeshare exchange companies to re-establish a viable competitor in the market" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1997/12/cuc-hfs.shtm Federal Trade Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514103241/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1997/12/cuc-hfs.shtm |date=2009-05-14 }} 17 Dec 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/os/1997/12/cucinter.pkg.htm Federal Trade Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cendant Software, composed of Sierra, Davidson &amp; Associates (including [[Blizzard Entertainment]]), [[Knowledge Adventure]] and [[Gryphon Software Morph|Gryphon Software]], was sold in 1998 to French publisher [[Havas]], which then merged with [[Vivendi]], which then merged with [[Activision]].

After the accounting scandal, the original "Comp-U-Card" division was bought out by some remaining executives and reorganized into a company called [[Trilegiant]]. It was later renamed [[Affinion|Affinion Group,]] and is still located in [[Stamford, Connecticut]].

On October 23, 2005, Cendant Corporation announced its decision to split into four separate companies: [[Realogy]], [[Travelport]], [[Wyndham Worldwide]] and [[Avis Budget Group]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cendant.com/media/pr/press_release.cgi/Corporate/11948 Cendant Press Release]&lt;!-- Retrieved on 2009-02-24--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accounting scandal ===

On April 16, 1998, less than one year after the new brand was introduced,  Cendant disclosed that for three years prior to the merger, CUC had fraudulently overstated its income by over US$500 million. This caused Cendant stock to plummet from $39 to $20 in a single day, eventually reaching $9,&lt;ref name=Shenanigans&gt;{{cite book| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hKaeIS2hEh0C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Cendant/CUC#v=onepage&amp;q=Cendant%2FCUC&amp;f=false | title= Financial shenanigans | author= Howard Mark Schilit | publisher= McGraw-Hill | isbn= 0-07-138626-2 | date= 2002}} pages 3-9&lt;/ref&gt; and costing shareholders about US$14 billion. Cendant/CUC was eventually required to pay more than US$2.85 billion in class action settlements to shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/07/10/283796/index.htm Fortune archive] Cendant Case Scorecard: Government 3; Book-Cookers 0&lt;/ref&gt;

The Securities and Exchange Commission brought civil charges against CUC president [[Kirk Shelton]], and CEO and Chairman [[Walter Forbes]], for the "long-running financial fraud", which, it alleged, started in 1995. The SEC stated that CUC inflated its books in order to inflate its stock price, which allowed it to use its stock to buy other companies; and in turn these [[mergers and acquisitions]] were executed in order to generate financial reserves and purchase reserves that were intended to be "big enough to bury the fraud".&lt;ref name=WFdoj&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nj/press/files/pdffiles/forb0117rel.pdf Dept. of Justice press release on Forbe's conviction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531192647/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nj/press/files/pdffiles/forb0117rel.pdf |date=2009-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KSdoj&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nj/press/files/pdffiles/forb1031rel.pdf  Dept. of Justice press release on Shelton's conviction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514190638/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nj/press/files/pdffiles/forb1031rel.pdf |date=2009-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelton was convicted in January 2005 of 12 counts of fraud and related charges, and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

Government has set up the Centralized Monitoring System (CMS) to automate the process of Lawful Interception &amp; Monitoring of telecommunications. CMS has got the approval from government. Cabinet Committee on Security has approved the project of CMS with government funding of Rs 400 Crores. Pilot trials have been completed and the system is anticipated to be progressively operationalised from the end of the financial year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==History==
The 2007-08 annual report of the [[Department of Telecommunications]] (DoT) stated that the requirements for the CMS project had been finalized by the [[Telecommunication Engineering Center]] (TEC), after deliberations with security agencies, and that the first phase of the project, covering the "national capital", was scheduled to be implemented by 31 March 2008. It also stated that C-DOT had finalized the "scope, architecture and dimensioning of the network".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/English%20annual%20report%202007-08_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008-09 annual report stated that proof of concept had been demonstrated and that R&amp;D activities for the project were "ongoing".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/AR_English_2008-09_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of India budgeted $150 million for the system as part of its [[12th Five Year Plan (Government of India)|12th Five Year Plan]], with [[Cabinet of India|Cabinet]] ultimately approving a higher amount.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The CMS was fast-tracked following the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]]. However, it faced repeated delays and missed the original deployment deadline of the end of 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-06-27/news/40233413_1_surveillance-system-government-surveillance-business-climate |title=Beyond Snowden: US surveillance system a useful model for democratic, terror-hit India|publisher=The Economic Times |date=2013-06-27 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the next deadline of March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=PTI|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/telecom-central-monitoring-system-in-10-circles-by-december-914389.html |title=Telecom Central Monitoring System in 10 circles by December |publisher=''Firstpost'' |date=2013-06-28 |accessdate=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMS was first announced publicly in a press release by the [[Press Information Bureau]] (PIB), dated 26 November 2009.&lt;ref name="firstpost1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Raza |first=Danish |url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/indias-central-monitoring-system-security-cant-come-at-cost-of-privacy-944475.html |title=India's Central Monitoring System: Security can't come at cost of privacy |publisher=''Firstpost'' |date=2013-07-10 |accessdate=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release lacked details on the system but stated that CMS was a "centralized system to monitor communications on mobile phones, landlines and the internet in the country" and claimed that the project would "strengthen the security environment in the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=54679 |title=Press Information Bureau English Releases |publisher=Pib.nic.in |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; CMS was mentioned by [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (India)|Minister of Communications and Information Technology]] [[Kapil Sibal]] on 1 January 2011, while addressing the media to announce his 100-day agenda for the Indian telecom sector. Sibal mentioned it in passing, telling the media that "Steps will be taken to establish the Central Monitoring System which will facilitate and prevent misuse of lawful interception facility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sandeep Joshi |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1023117.ece |title=100-day plan: Sibal promises transparency in telecom sector |publisher=The Hindu |date=2011-01-01 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=PTI |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-01/india/28373595_1_spectrum-telecom-minister-new-telecom-policy |title=Govt to come out with new telecom policy: Sibal |publisher=The Times of India |date=2011-01-01 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement was described as "muted" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' [[Time (magazine)|magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trivedi |first=Anjani |url=http://world.time.com/2013/06/30/in-india-prism-like-surveillance-slips-under-the-radar/ |title=In India, Prism-like Surveillance Slips Under the Radar |publisher=World.time.com |date=2013-06-30 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March 2011, Minister of State for Communications &amp; Information Technology, [[Sachin Pilot]] stated that the CMS was to be set up for the "[[Lawful Interception]] and [[Surveillance|Monitoring]] of communications to address the national security concerns. It will automize the present manual system of interception and monitoring, which will enhance the secrecy of intercepted numbers and will cut down the delay in provisioning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=70747 |title=Press Information Bureau English Releases |publisher=Pib.nic.in |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 2012, ''[[The New Indian Express]]'' reported that the [[National Investigation Agency]] (NIA) had requested for authorization to access CMS once it became functional. The paper also stated that a pilot trial was underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yadav |first=Yatish |url=http://newindianexpress.com/nation/article1300012.ece |title=NIA seeks Central Monitoring System to tap phones |publisher=The New Indian Express |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mint'' cited an internal note from the DoT dated 10 June 2013, which reportedly said that CMS had "undergone successful pilots" and was "likely to be commissioned" by the end of 2013.&lt;ref name="livemint1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Leslie D’Monte &amp; Joji Thomas Philip |url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/pR5zc8hCD1sn3NWQwa7cQJ/The-new-surveillance-state.html |title=How the world's largest democracy is preparing to snoop on its citizens |publisher=Livemint |date=2013-07-03 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government began rolling out the CMS, state by state, in April 2013.&lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt;

In July 2013, [[BlackBerry (company)|BlackBerry]] granted the Indian Government access to its messaging services.&lt;ref name="indiatimes5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-07-10/news/40492683_1_blackberry-services-blackberry-messenger-interception-solution |title=Government, BlackBerry end dispute over interception of BB devices|publisher=The Economic Times |date=2013-07-10 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is presumed that CMS will be used to monitor these services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Phil Muncaster |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/07/11/blackberry_gives_indian_spooks_access/ |title=BlackBerry gives Indian spooks BBM and BIS access |publisher=The Register |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it may be done through C-DOT's [[Lawful Intercept and Monitoring]] (LIM) system.&lt;ref&gt;http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/india-spies-on-its-internet-users-too&lt;/ref&gt; It will make two amendments to the Indian Telegraph Act to allow for intercepting and monitoring through the CMS and to allow "collecting, storing and analyzing message pertaining to information of any nature by the Telegraph Authority".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=tech2 News Staff |url=http://tech2.in.com/news/general/norms-for-interception-of-calls-and-messages-expected-to-be-finalised-by-august-end/907410 |title=Norms for interception of calls and messages expected to be finalised by August end |publisher=Tech2.in.com |date=2013-07-10 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interception Authorization ==
In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 7 of the [[Indian Telegraph Act]], 1885 (13 of 1885), the Government of [[India]] made [http://cis-india.org/internet-governance/resources/rule-419-a-indian-telegraph-rules-1951 Rule 419A] of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directions for interception of any message or class of messages under sub-section (2) of Section 5 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 shall not be issued except by an order made by the Secretary to the Government of India in the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] in the case of Government of India and by the Secretary to the State Government in-charge of the Home Department in the case of a State Government. In unavoidable circumstances, such order may be made by an officer, not below the rank of a Joint Secretary to the Government of India, who has been duly authorized by the Union Home Secretary or the State Home Secretary, as the case may be:

Provided that in emergent cases:

(i) in remote areas, where obtaining of prior directions for interception of messages or class of messages is not feasible; or

(ii) for operational reasons, where obtaining of prior directions for interception of message or class of messages is not feasible;

the required interception of any message or class of messages shall be carried out with the prior approval of the Head or the second senior most officer of the authorized security ''i.e.'' Law Enforcement Agency at the Central Level and the officers authorised in this behalf, not below the rank of Inspector General of Police at the state level but the concerned competent authority shall be informed of such interceptions by the approving authority within three working days and that such interceptions shall be got confirmed by the concerned competent authority within a period of seven working days. If the confirmation from the competent authority is not received within the stipulated seven days, such interception shall cease and the same message or class of messages shall not be intercepted thereafter without the prior approval of the Union Home Secretary or the State Home Secretary, as the case may be.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court has upheld the constitutional validity of interceptions and monitoring under Section 5(2) of the Act through its order dated 18.12.1996 in Writ Petition (C) No.256/1991 by People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) Vs. Union of India. It has also observed that the right to hold a telephone conversation in the privacy of one's home or office without interference can certainly be claimed as “Right to Privacy”, and accordingly, held that telephone tapping would infringe the Right to Life and Right to Freedom of Speech &amp; Expression enshrined in Articles 21 and 19(1)(a) respectively of the Constitution of India, unless it is permitted under the procedure established by law. The Hon’ble Court further observed that Section 5(2) of the Act clearly provides that ‘occurrence of any public emergency’ or ‘interest of public safety’ is a sine qua non for the application of these provisions. Neither of these are secretive conditions or situations. Either of the situations would be apparent to a reasonable person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==System details==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
Earlier the provisioning of Interception of the Telephone was being done by the Telecom operators on the basis of duly authorized order by the competent authority in accordance with 419A telephone rule. Traditionally, the Law Enforcement Agency was approaching the various telecom companies based on the numbering scheme of the target telephone number. In CMS setup there is no change in the Interception authorization order envisaged in 419A telephone rule except that now the [[Law Enforcement]] Agency will go to only TERM Cell for any interception order provisioning irrespective of telephone numbering scheme. There is no change in the existing LIS / LIM system in the telecom network. The TERM Cell who are the field unit of DOT and carries the enforcement and regulation of licensing conditions in the field will be sole authority to provision the interception orders but interception orders will be obtained by Law Enforcement Agencies in according to the 419A telephone rule.

==Government objective==
Government has set up the Centralized Monitoring System (CMS) to automate the process of Lawful Interception &amp; Monitoring of telecommunications technology. Government of India on 2015-12-02 in a reply to parliament question no. 595 on scope, objectives and framework of the CMS has struck a balance between national security, online privacy and free speech informed that to take care of the privacy of citizens, lawful interception and monitoring is governed by the Section 5(2) of Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 read with Rule 419A of Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Rules, 2007 wherein oversight mechanism exists in form of review committee under chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary at Central Government level and Chief Secretary of the State at the State Government level. The same mechanism is applicable for the interception under the CMS Project also. Additionally, there is an inbuilt mechanism of check and balance as Security Agencies/Law Enforcement Agencies cannot provision the target and the provisioning agency cannot see the content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Media reaction==
''[[Business Standard]]'' criticised the fact that a warrant need not be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/india-s-digital-battleground-113062101013_1.html|title=India's digital battleground|last=Shukla|first=Ajai|date=21 June 2013|work=[[Business Standard]]|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Firstpost]]'' criticised the lack of information from the government about the project and the lack of a legal recourse for a citizen whose personal details were misused or leaked.&lt;ref name="firstpost1"/&gt; ''[[The Hindu]]'' also criticised the lack of information available about the system.&lt;ref name="thehindu2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Deepa Kurup |url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/in-the-dark-about-indias-prism/article4817903.ece |title=In the dark about 'India's Prism' |publisher=The Hindu |date=2013-06-16 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Indian Express]]'' criticised the introduction of the system in the absence of accountability and "any reasonably effective safeguards" to protect privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/way-to-watch/1133737/0 |title=Way to watch |publisher=Indian Express |date=2013-06-26 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times of India]]'' criticised the introduction of CMS without public debate or Parliamentary accountability. The paper also felt that Indian privacy laws were "lax",&lt;ref name="indiatimes3"/&gt; and "far worse than American law on these matters".&lt;ref name="indiatimes3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-06-13/news/39952596_1_nsa-india-us-homeland-security-dialogue-national-security-letters |title=Indian surveillance laws &amp; practices far worse than US|publisher=The Economic Times |date=2013-06-18 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Forbes|Forbes India]]'' pointed out that a consequence of CMS would be that innocent citizens could be wrongly accused of criminal activity.&lt;ref name="forbesindia1"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' argued that India did not need centralised interception facilities to have centralised tracking of interception requests. The paper also expressed supported for a strong privacy law, and advised Indian citizens to "take greater care of their own privacy and safeguard the security of their communications".&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Prakash |first=Pranesh |url=http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/11/can-india-trust-its-government-on-privacy/ |title=Can India Trust Its Government on Privacy? |location=Hyderabad |publisher=India.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2012-10-11 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights and civil-liberties groups reactions==
Human rights and civil-liberties groups have expressed concerns that the CMS is prone to abuse, and is an infringement of privacy and civil liberties.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|author=R. Jai Krishna |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/07/06/indias-surveillance-program-stalled/ |title=India's Surveillance Program Stalled |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=2013-07-06 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have described it as "abuse of privacy rights and security-agency overreach".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Meenakshi Ganguly, the [[South Asia]] director of [[Human Rights Watch]], felt that the move toward extensive "surveillance capabilities enabled by digital communications" suggests that governments are now "casting the net wide, enabling intrusions into private lives". Ganguly also felt that increasing surveillance around the world was an attempt by governments to "grapple with the power of social media that can enable spontaneous street protests".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

[[Praveen Swami]], strategic affairs editor of [[Network 18|Network18]], felt that "There is also the argument that the threat of a cyber attack is deliberately overplayed&amp;nbsp;... it is far-fetched.

'''DUID''' is the [[acronym]] that stands for Driving Under the Influence of [[Recreational drug use|Drugs]]. It is akin to DUI or DWI for [[driving under the influence]] of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or driving while [[drunkenness|intoxicated]].
[[Image:Driver drug testing.jpg|right|thumb|A road sign in [[Victoria, Australia]] warning drivers about drug testing.]]
Several [[United States|American]] states and [[Europe]]an countries now have "per se" DUID laws that presume a driver is impaired if they are found to have any detectable quantity of controlled substances in their body while operating an [[automobile]] and that the driver has no doctor's [[medical prescription|prescription]] for the substance. This is similar to the "per se" DUI/DWI laws that presume a driver is impaired when their [[blood alcohol content]] is above a certain level (currently 0.08% in the United States). There is some controversy with "per se" DUID laws in that a driver with any detectable quantity of controlled substances may not in fact be impaired and the detectable quantity in blood or sweat may be only the remnants of drug use in days or weeks past.

==Controversy==

This controversy is reduced by reducing the potential for wrongful convictions in 2 ways; firstly if blood tests are used to obtain convictions most legal frameworks outside the United States require corroborating evidence of impairment to support that the blood test result represents impairment. This ranges from suspects being required to undertake physical co-ordination tests, to computerised pupil reaction tests, to use of witness accounts of general behaviour and erratic driving, and may include expert testimony as to expected impacts on performance.

Secondly, when saliva tests are used (Australia), a cut off threshold is calibrated in fitting with U.S. [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] standards, at such a level that countries other than the United States have erroneously assumed that the average person would be impaired by the drug detected to a degree that crash risk is significantly raised. The original levels stated by SAMHSA were determined and established simply to detect any drug use; these data were promulgated for testing for individuals in sensitive employment positions regarding public safety and/or national security (7 Nev. L.J. 570 (2006-2007)

DWI and Drugs: A Look at Per Se Laws for Marijuana).  Studies have shown that this use can be as long as weeks in the past (id.).  In Germany where more economical sweat tests are used, it is not possible to calibrate detection to a level linked to impairment, and all users may be identified. So unless there has been injury caused there is no criminal charge, but only an administrative one of driving with drugs present, which does not infer impairment or lack of it. This is similar to a speeding ticket as a disincentive for potentially risky behaviour. However if injury was caused, a process of further evidence gathering of driver impairment may be triggered, which can lead to a criminal violation.

Systems where there is a penalty after detection of target drugs are sometimes misnamed zero tolerance for the foregoing reasons. Genuine zero tolerance jurisdictions (ones not applying rational cut offs) are generally failing to substantially reducing drugged driving, where it has been a problem originally. However, in Australia where the use of calibrated devices create de facto limits for common impairing illicit substances, roadside detections and self reporting of drug driving in National telephone surveys have reduced by 25% over the last 3–4 years.

Varying DUID laws have been passed over the last 15 years in response to both increasing roles of drug driving in road tolls, and the fact [[prosecutor]]s have found it difficult to prove that a driver was impaired from using a controlled substance. Practical difficulties included the transient effects of some drugs wearing off before either police or doctors had a chance to assess many suspects for impairment, and also the expense of having to call expert forensic witnesses before courts to interpret results on a case by case basis. These laws can make their cases much easier to win if they only have to prove the presence of a controlled substance in the blood or urine, without a prescription. The logic in zero tolerance jurisdictions is that the trade off more efficient prosecutions of potentially impaired individuals is well worth the possible erroneous convictions of a lesser number of drivers who may not in fact be impaired, because the driver was already violating the law by using a controlled substance without a prescription.

There is a tension with such an approach and enhanced road safety. Promoting zero drug use, as with alcohol prohibition, is not a realistic goal and Policing and Court resources are clearly best targeted at hazardous use. The most successful laws for reducing drink driving have sought to modify cultural norms and the target groups behaviour, separating impairment and driving. An approach that appears to be working most successfully to reduce drug driving, based on the Australian experience of matching public health guidelines, such as no driving for approximately 3 hours after cannabis use, with targeted legal intervention (the saliva test drug detection thresh ehold).

==New Zealand Laws==

New Zealand in 2009 passed unique legislation, which created a zero tolerance law for driving under the influence of class A drugs (methamphetamine) to discourage their use, and a requirement for impairment testing if other drugs are suspected. New Zealand's main issue in traffic is Class C drugs, so this law could appear oriented to support the "war on (hard) drugs". Road Safety advocates however supported the provision for intolerance of methamphetamine, introduced by Opposition MP Trevor Mallard. As intoxicated users can pass traditional impairment tests despite being unfit to drive (mood and judgment), and the time that drivers may be most at risk is when in the come down and levels are low, making any cut off level in future self-defeating.

==European Laws==

Drug impaired driving is today suspected by the European Road Safety Observatory of being the reason that drink driving crash rates no longer reduce in direct proportion to reducing or plateaued numbers of drunk drivers found on roads. It is believed that the remaining ones are carrying more risk than their blood alcohol levels should strictly impart - due to the frequent addition of other drugs. If the historic assumptions about formulae to setting alcohol limits at particular levels to reduce harm (by anticipated degrees) in the target demographic are defunct, the implications for impaired driving reduction policy are major.

==United Kingdom Laws==
Recent UK legislation effective 2 March 2015 has introduced a series of new offences into the realm of road traffic law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/drug-drive-legislation-am-i-fit-to-drive|title=Drug drive legislation: am I fit to drive?|publisher=GOV.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has sought to tackle the belated increased number of drivers operating vehicles with a high measure of proscribed and prescribed drugs in their system. The new offences detail at least 8 illegal drugs and 8 legally prescribed drugs, which have been given set levels to be tested. Illegal drugs will have a 'trace' level set that would constitute a criminal offence.

Drivers who are taking legally prescribed medication will be required to closely follow their doctor's and drug manufacturer's guidance when taking the medication. If the driver is found to be carrying more than the set levels in their system, outside of the set guidelines, they will be guilty of an offence under the new rules.

==Championships==
The Logan Cup car can be entered in open rallies [[Group N]] or open circuit motorsport events. Renault and Dacia organize [[One-Design|One-make racing]] championships in various countries where the Logan is available for sale.

The Dacia Logan Cup has been held in [[Romania]] as '''Cupa Dacia Logan JOE'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daciagroup.com/stire-la_coupe_dacia_joe___archives_-point_et_%C3%A0_la_ligne-615 Point et à la ligne] ''daciagroup.com''&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007. In 2008, the name was changed to '''Cupa Dacia Ursus''' and since 2009 it was known as '''Cupa Dacia'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cupadacia.ro/ Cupa Dacia] ''cupadacia.ro''&lt;/ref&gt; It was managed from the beginning by Mach1sport-management and since 2010 the competition was sponsorised by Policolor's "Klar Professional". Cupa Dacia is very popular, with fierce competition, as it is part of the [[Romanian Rally Championship|Romanian National Rally Championship]] (CNR) and is affiliated to FRAS (Romanian Federation of Sport Automotive).

[[ADAC]] has been organizing the Cup in [[Germany]] since 2006 as the '''ADAC Dacia Logan Clubsport'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dacia-clubsport.com/index.php ADAC Dacia Logan Clubsport] ''dacia-clubsport.com''&lt;/ref&gt; This championship rewards not the best driver but the best amateur team.

In [[France]], the '''Coupe Logan Rallycross''' was organised by [[Fédération Française du Sport Automobile|FFSA]] in 2008&lt;ref name=fra&gt;[http://rallycross.free.fr/coupelogan.htm Coupe Logan Rallycross 2008] ''rallycross.free.fr''&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[rallycross]] series.

In [[Russia]], the '''Renault Logan Cup'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renault.ru/about-renault/sport/logan-cup/#!]&lt;/ref&gt; rally series is supported by local Renault representatives - OAO Avtoframos, which manufacture Logans at a plant in [[Moscow]]. Held since 2008, Renault Logan Cup was private at first, sponsored by AGA autocosmetics. The race calendar consists of 9 races: 4 are part of the Russian Rally Championship, 4 in budget-minded Club Rally Cup, and one final race. Championship events usually attract no more than 5 Logans, as they are expensive. Club Rally evens are twice as popular, and there have been approximately 25 cars built (total) by the end of 2009.

The grand prize of the Russian Renault Logan Cup is free participation in the top winter oval racing (named trek) - Star Race by Za Rylem magazine, which is held each February.

Stein]] in conjunction with the A&amp;O-gallery and other artists from the Berlin [[media art]] scene.

== Founding ==

Directors Lounge was founded informally in 2005 to provide filmmakers and video artists an unceremonious environment to meet and interact during the [[Berlinale]], as well as to screen works that did not conform to categorization of length, method or subject matter, whether by known or obscure artists. In contrast to most such festivals, the surroundings were to be free of the “black box” atmosphere of standard cinemas and screening spaces, but rather selected to cultivate dialogue. As such, its aim was also to serve as a launching pad for collaborations. Due to the positive response, the event was expanded beyond being an annual festival, and it came to be a continuous platform for film and media art, with the Berlin International Directors Lounge (i.e., the annual event in February, see section below) remaining the focal event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://directorslounge.net/introduction.html Directors Lounge: An Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; The festival has been held at various locations, with special attention being shown to maintaining a non-standardized multi-media experience.

The publicly attended annual event held in February parallel to the Berlin Film Festival is primarily a film forum with an emphasis on [[short films]], but also includes [[Installation art|installations]] and hosts musical and [[Live art (art form)|art performances]]. Many films are shown as World Premieres. The artistic direction of the most recent event (stylized as “'''[DLX]'''”, Feb. 6 – 16, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;[http://directorslounge.tumblr.com/post/75402074682/the-kid-at-ten-dlx-the-10th-berlin]&lt;/ref&gt; was credited to Julia Murakami, André Werner, Klaus W. Eisenlohr and Kenton Turk. Frequent curator-contributors have included filmmakers Alexei Dmitriev ([[Russia]]) and [[Shaun Wilson]] ([[Australia]]) as well as the late [[Heiko Daxl]] (Germany) together with [[Ingeborg Fülepp]] ([[Croatia]]), both media artists.

The first festival (2005) was held in Club el Cultrún in the Berlin district [[Friedrichshain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.directorslounge.net/DLweb19/wo.htm Directors Lounge (2005) (German)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 and 2007, converted spaces fronting [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] (137 and 133 respectively) served as the festival location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://directorslounge.net/DL2006.html Directors Lounge (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://directorslounge.net/DL2007.html Directors Lounge (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 and 2009, Directors Lounge moved to the now defunct Scala (opened in 1908 as Überbrettl, later Aladin, still later Camera, “the only [[Revival house|arthouse cinema]] in the [[East Germany|GDR]]”) in [[Mitte]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.directorslounge.net/DL2008map.html Directors Lounge (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 and 2011, the art house Meinblau on the [[Pfefferberg (Berlin)|Pfefferberg]] in [[Pankow]] served as the venue. With the eighth festival, it was relocated back to Mitte, to the Naherholung Sternchen, behind the famous premiere cinema [[Kino International]] near [[Alexanderplatz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://berliner-filmfestivals.de/2012/02/8-berlin-international-directors-lounge Berliner Filmfestivals, “Experimente in der Lounge” (German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the name implies, the film festival concentrates on providing an informal and ambient atmosphere which offers filmmakers and film enthusiasts an opportunity to come into casual contact with one other, in contrast to many similar ventures. It is open to all submissions regardless of length. Aside from selections from this Open Call, it consists of a number of specially curated programs.

The festival does not confer awards on participating films, setting it apart from most similar exhibitions. It is a non-profit event supported to a large extent by [[Volunteering|volunteer services]] and some [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsoring]]. Performers and guest speakers are not paid for their participation.

Notable recent participants in this festival include [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] and [[BAFTA Award|BAFTA]]-winner [[Michael Nyman]], who attended the first public screening in Germany of his feature film ''NYman With A Movie Camera'' (2011); [[Canadians|Canadian]] filmmaker [[Guy Maddin]], who supplied a selection of short films the same year he served on the jury of the Berlinale (2011); [[Cannes Film Festival]] triple award-winning photographer/filmmaker  [[Anton Corbijn]] (2012); [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance International Jury Prize]] winner [[Simon Ellis (film director)|Simon Ellis]], who appeared for a self-curated retrospective of his films (2012) and "[[Cinema of Transgression]]" spearhead [[Nick Zedd]], who likewise attended a retrospective selection of his short films (2012).&lt;ref&gt;[http://directorslounge.net/DL_press/DL2013_pressrelease01_engl_web.pdf DL9 Press info sheet (page 3)]&lt;/ref&gt; Notable recent premieres include the first public screening of works by [[Turkish people|Turkish]] digital media artist [[Erdal Inci]] in Germany (2014).&lt;ref&gt;[http://directorslounge.tumblr.com/post/101383271752/dl-deep-feature-knocked-for-a-loop-north DL Deep Feature "Knocked for a Loop" (Kenton Turk, October 30, 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Performers have included [[Czechs|Czech]] [[avant-garde]] composer [[Vladimír Hirsch]] (performing "Underlying Scapes"), [[video performance artist]] [[Max Hattler]] (with "Audiovisual Abstractions") and [[Deutscher Filmpreis]] winner [[Birol Ünel]] (reading poetry by the "[[NO!art]]" [[anti-art]] movement member Miron Zownir).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.web-events.info/Event?eventid=900196&amp;event_title=Vladimir%20Hirsch%20in%20Berlin Web Events, “Vladimir Hirsch in Berlin”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://berlinlounge.tumblr.com/post/378688679/audiovisual-abstractions-max-hattler Directors Lounge, Feb. 14, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://berlinlounge.tumblr.com/post/16501391053/parasiten-der-ohnmacht Directors Lounge, Feb. 12, 2012, “Parasiten der Nacht”]&lt;/ref&gt;

Projektzentrum für zeitgenössische Kunst (German)]&lt;/ref&gt; These presentations often mirror the multi-media concept of the February event. Recent performers at these excursions include [[VJing|VJ]] Chuuu ([[Japan]]) and [[Kraftwerk]] founding member [[Eberhard Kranemann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perisphere.de/vor-ort/directors-lounge-in-der-black-box Perisphere, “Directors Lounge in der Black Box” (German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these out-of-town excursions, there are regular presentations in Berlin itself. Prominent among these are ongoing monthly presentations by Klaus W. Eisenlohr. These screenings characteristically include discussion rounds with the filmmakers and audience following the film presentations. Most are held in the “Z-inema” of the Z-Bar, which hosts many and varied cultural events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.z-bar.de/Inhaltsseiten/kuenstler.html Z-Bar, Künstler und Partner (German)]&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenlohr also curates a special ongoing series of screenings entitled "Urban Research" that is regularly presented as part of the festival in February. Directors Lounge mounts as well other multi-media events in Berlin, often as part of city arts festivals. Recent performers at these include Turkish computer musician/sound designer and [[Islak Köpek]] member [[Korhan Erel]] (2016).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artconnect.com/events/directors-lounge-at-48-stunden-neukolln-berlin Art Connect Berlin, "Directors Lounge at 48 Stunden Neukölln Berlin" (2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; and legendary [[Rio de Janeiro]] performer and "Black Future" member [[Tantão]] (2018) &lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/DL_Lounge/status/968981302060994560 ''Directors Lounge Twitter'', February 28, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

Online, the platform maintains ''Directors Lounge Magazine'', which posts photos and curiosities of specific and broader interest and publishes original reviews of films shown by Directors Lounge as well as the "DL Deep Feature" series, in-depth exclusive interview-based articles on various figures associated in some way with DL. Canadian director/screenwriter [[Brandon Cronenberg]] was among its first subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://directorslounge.tumblr.com/post/104275992747/dl-deep-feature-if-i-had-a-chesterfield-brandon DL Deep Feature "If I Had a Chesterfield" (Kenton Turk, December 3, 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus of Directors Lounge events remains largely contemporary [[experimental film]] and an innovative reconceptualization of the nature of screenings. In 2015, the platform premiered "DL à la carte," a concept for a localized but asynchronous film festival selection presentation in cooperation with [[shoutr|shoutr labs]] (Berlin), in the latter's first such undertaking (Berliner Liste fair for contemporary art, September 2015).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artconnect.com/events/directors-lounge-a-la-carte-at-berliner-liste-2015 Art Connect Berlin, "'Directors Lounge à la carte' at Berliner Liste 2015" ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Directors Lounge is despite the parallel time frame of the February event not in any way connected to the Berlin International Film Festival, nor is it to be confused with a later-founded German organization named Regielounge, whose name in the English translation variously appears as “Director's Lounge” or “Directors Lounge.”

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 1973''' was the 18th edition of the annual [[Eurovision Song Contest]].

It was held in [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]. It was won by the Luxembourg entry, "[[Tu te reconnaîtras]]", this being Luxembourg's fourth win. The voting was a very close one, with Spain finishing only 4 points behind and [[Cliff Richard]] of the United Kingdom (who came second in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1968|1968]]) another 2 points after. The winning song scored the highest score ever achieved in Eurovision under any voting format, recording 129 points out of a possible 160; scoring just under 81% of the possible maximum, but partly due to a scoring system which guaranteed all countries at least two points from each other country.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, John Kennedy.

== Location ==
{{details|topic=the host city|Luxembourg (city)}}
[[File:Luxemburg Grand Theatre 2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Grand Théâtre, Luxembourg City – host venue of the 1973 contest.]]
The city of Luxembourg, also known as '''Luxembourg City''', is a [[Communes of Luxembourg|commune]] with [[List of cities in Luxembourg|city status]], and the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]]. It is located at the [[confluence]] of the [[Alzette]] and [[Pétrusse]] Rivers in southern Luxembourg. The city contains the historic '''Luxembourg Castle''', established by the [[Franks]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]], around which a settlement developed.

The Grand Théâtre de Luxembourg, inaugurated in 1964 as the Théâtre Municipal de la Ville de Luxembourg, became the venue for the 1973 contest. It is the city's major venue for drama, opera and ballet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salesguide.lu/press-en-4-321.html "The "Grand Théâtre" of Luxembourg City offers high quality cultural events"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722160736/http://salesguide.lu/press-en-4-321.html |date=2011-07-22 }}, ''Luxembourg National Tourist Office, London''.

== Format ==
The language rule forcing countries to enter songs sung in any of their national languages was dropped, so performers from some countries sang in [[English language|English]].  The event was marked by controversy when the [[Spain|Spanish]] song, "Eres tú" (by Mocedades), was accused of [[plagiarism]] due to reasonable similarities in the melody with the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] entry from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1966|1966 contest]] ("[[Brez besed]]" sung by [[Berta Ambrož]]); however, "Eres tú" was not disqualified. After finishing second in the contest, the song went on to become a huge international hit.

The somewhat elliptical lyrics to Portugal's entry "[[Tourada]]" provided sufficient cover for a song that was clearly understood as a blistering assault on the country's decaying dictatorship. Also, the word "breasts" was used during Sweden's song entry. However, no action was taken by the EBU.  An argument broke out between the singer [[Maxi (singer)|Maxi]] and her [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] delegation over how the song should be performed. During rehearsals she repeatedly stopped performing in frustration. When it began to appear possible that Maxi might withdraw from the contest, [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] immediately sent over another singer, [[Tina Reynolds]], to take her place just in case. In the end Miss Reynolds wasn't needed as Maxi did perform, with her entry earning 10th place on the scoreboard. (Reynolds would perform [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|the following year]].)

This contest holds the record for the most watched Eurovision Song Contest in the [[United Kingdom]], and is also the 18th [[List of most-watched television broadcasts#Most watched programmes|most watched television show]] in the same country, with an estimated 21.54 million tuning in on the night. [[Cliff Richard]] represented the [[United Kingdom|UK]] with the song [[Power to All Our Friends]]. He came 3rd with 123 points. The winner though was [[Anne-Marie David]] with '[[Tu te reconnaîtras]]'. In the UK it was released in English under the title "Wonderful Dream" and released on Epic. It made number 13.

In the light of events at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich, there were fears of a terrorist threat, particularly directed against Israel's first-ever entrant, leading to unusually tight security for the contest.  This gave rise to one of the best-known Eurovision anecdotes, frequently recounted by the UK's long-serving commentator [[Terry Wogan]].  He recalled that the floor manager strongly advised the audience to remain seated while applauding the performances, otherwise they risked being shot by security forces.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-84442-994-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voting ===
Each country had two jury members, one aged between 16 and 25 and one aged between 26 and 55. They each awarded 1 to 5 points for each song (other than the song from their own country) immediately after it was performed and the votes were collected and counted as soon as they were cast. The juries watched the show on TV from the Ville du Louvigny TV Studios of CLT and appeared on screen to confirm their scores.

== Participating countries ==
Seventeen nations took part in this year's contest.  [[Malta]] was drawn to perform in 6th place between [[Norway]] and [[Monaco]], but the Maltese broadcaster withdrew before the deadline to select an entry.&lt;ref name="eurovisionsongs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovisionsongs.net/nononever.htm|title=No, No, Never!!! - Songs That Did Not Make It To Eurovision|publisher=''eurovisionsongs.net''|accessdate=2009-07-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301032000/http://www.eurovisionsongs.net/nononever.htm|archivedate=2009-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
This was the first year [[Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest|Israel]] competed in the contest.
The 1973 contest marked the first time that women conducted the ESC orchestra. [[Monica Dominique]] conducted the Swedish entry and [[Nurit Hirsh]] conducted the Israeli entry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40965">The '''International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust''' was a two-day conference that opened on December 11, 2006, in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]. Iranian Foreign Minister [[Manouchehr Mottaki]] said the conference sought "neither to deny nor prove the [[Holocaust]]... [but] to provide an appropriate scientific atmosphere for scholars to offer their opinions in freedom about a historical issue."&lt;ref name=reimann/&gt; Notable attendees included [[David Duke]], [[Moshe Aryeh Friedman]], [[Robert Faurisson]], [[Gerald Fredrick Töben]], [[Richard Krege]], [[Michèle Renouf]], [[Ahmed Rami (writer)|Ahmed Rami]] and [[Yisroel Dovid Weiss]] of [[Neturei Karta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/12/13/professor-holocaust061213.html | title = Canadian prof's presence at Iran forum 'abhorrent': university | work=[[CBC News]] | date=2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference was described as a "[[Holocaust denial]] conference" or a "meeting of Holocaust deniers."&lt;ref&gt;

The conference provoked criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amir Taheri]]. ''The Persian Night: Iran Under the Khomeinist Revolution'', Encounter Books, 2010, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Holy See|Vatican]] condemned it, the [[Executive Office of the President|US administration]] of President [[George W. Bush]] called it an "affront to the entire civilized world," and British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] described it as "shocking beyond belief."&lt;ref name=Guttenplan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/dd_guttenplan/2006/12/the_holocaust_deniers_ball.html|title=Comment is free - The Guardian|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holocaust historians attending a separate conference in [[Berlin]] organized in protest against the Iranian one called it "an attempt to cloak [[anti-Semitism]] in scholarly language."&lt;ref name=Barnard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/articles/2006/12/12/conference_in_iran_on_holocaust_begins/|title=Conference in Iran on Holocaust begins|work=Boston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
According to the Iranian Foreign Ministry, the conference would not aim to deny or prove [[the Holocaust]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/6490BD25-3FFA-4E7D-9D1F-D3A23F7E84DF.htm|title=Iran hosts Holocaust conference (Al Jazeera)|accessdate=2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but to create opportunities "for suitable scientific research so that the hidden and unhidden angles of this most important political issue of the 20th century becomes more transparent." The event was organized by the ministry's Institute for Political &amp; International Studies (IPIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipis.ir/english/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128081129/http://www.ipis.ir/English/ |archivedate=2007-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the conference was to discuss the reality of the [[Nazism|Nazis]]' extermination of [[Jew]]s during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; The [[Foreign Minister of Iran]] and other officials stated that the conference was meant to "create an opportunity for thinkers who cannot express their views freely in Europe about the Holocaust".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,453691,00.html |title=Berlin Counters Holocaust Conference: "This Is What Happened" - SPIEGEL ONLINE |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=2006-12-11 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Iranian Foreign Minister: "If the official version of the Holocaust is thrown into doubt, then the identity and nature of Israel will be thrown into doubt. And if, during this review, it is proved that the Holocaust was a historical reality, then what is the reason for the Palestinians having to pay the cost of the Nazis' crimes?"&lt;ref name=lefkovits/&gt;

==Attendees==
There were 67 attendees from 30 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061214/OPINION/612140314|title=Holocaust deniers spread fiction in Iran|work=recordonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fathi&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/11/world/middleeast/11cnd-iran.html|title=Holocaust Deniers and Skeptics Gather in Iran|first=Nazila|last=Fathi|work=New York Times|date=2006-12-11|accessdate=2006-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michèle Renouf]], an Australian-born British defender of Holocaust denial author [[David Irving]] also attended. At the conference, Renouf claimed that the "terrible things" that happened to the Jews in World War II were brought upon by Jewish leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/12/iran.israel | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | first=Robert | last=Tait | title=Holocaust deniers gather in Iran for 'scientific' conference | date=2006-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the participants at the conference were six members of the [[anti-Zionist]] [[Jews|Jewish]] organisation [[Neturei Karta]], including Aharon Cohen&lt;ref name=spillius&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/12/12/wiran12.xml|title=Iran stirs up hatred with Holocaust conference|first=Alex|last=Spillius|date=2006-12-12|accessdate=2006-12-12 | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nkusa.org/activities/Speeches/2006Iran-ACohen.cfm|title=Orthodox Jewish Attitude to the 'Holocaust'|first=Aharon|last=Cohen|publisher=Neturei Karta USA|date=2006-12-12|accessdate=2006-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; who said he had come to the conference to put the [[Orthodox Jewish]] viewpoint across. Cohen also said that while the Holocaust indisputably happened, "in no way can it be used as a justification for perpetrating unjust acts against the [[Palestinians]]."&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

[[Shiraz Dossa]], a professor of Political Science at [[St. Francis Xavier University]] in [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]],  presented a paper at the conference and was roundly vilified for his participation by the Canadian media and his university.&lt;ref name=CBC1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/12/13/professor-holocaust061213.html|title=Canadian prof's presence at Iran forum 'abhorrent': university|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=December 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Interlanguage link multi|Jan Bernhoff|sv}}, a computer teacher from Sweden, gave a presentation claiming that 300,000 Jews had been killed as opposed to six million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/5797/20061214/ |title=Swedish teacher at Holocaust denial conference - The Local |publisher=Thelocal.se |date= |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[France|French]] Holocaust denier [[Roger Garaudy]] was unable to attend the conference for health reasons. However, he reportedly sent a videotaped message supporting [[Iranian President]] [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s view that Israel should cease to exist.&lt;ref name=bookreview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asharq-e.com/news.asp?section=8&amp;id=8605 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224180036/http://asharq-e.com/news.asp?section=8 |archivedate=2009-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denied permission===
[[Israeli Arab]] lawyer [[Khaled Kasab Mahameed]] was denied permission to attend the conference by Iran after it was discovered that he holds [[Israeli citizenship]]. He had been previously invited to attend by the Iranian government;&lt;ref name=lefkovits2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1164881865648&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|title=Iran bars Israeli Arab from Shoah forum|first=Etgar|last=Lefkovits|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=2006-12-10|accessdate=2006-12-12}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; however Iran does not grant [[visa (document)|visas]] to Israelis. According to ''[[Ha'aretz]]'', Mahameed intended "to tell the conference that the Holocaust did happen and that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's position of Holocaust denial is wrong". He stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everything that happened must be internalized and the facts must not be denied... It is the obligation of all Arabs and all Muslims to understand the significance of the Holocaust. If their goal is to understand their adversary, they must understand the Holocaust... The ''[[1948 Palestinian exodus|naqba]]'' [disaster] the Palestinians experienced in 1948 is small compared to the Holocaust, but the political implications of the Holocaust have made its terrors a burden on the Palestinian people alone... The Holocaust has all the reasons for the creation of the Arab-Israeli conflict, but also has potential to bring peace."&lt;ref name=Stern&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/789142.html|title=Founder of Holocaust museum in Nazareth invited to Tehran|first=Yoav|last=Stern|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|date=2006-11-17|accessdate=2006-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conference events==
The Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] was quoted as saying: "The Zionist regime will be wiped out soon the same way the Soviet Union was, and humanity will achieve freedom [and] elections should be held among Jews, Christians and Muslims so the population of Palestine can select their government and destiny for themselves in a democratic manner."&lt;ref name=JerusalemPost12Dec06&gt;http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?c=JPArticle&amp;cid=1164881878838&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FshowFull&lt;/ref&gt;

Papers delivered by participants from countries ranging from Austria to Indonesia included "A Challenge to the Official Holocaust Story," and "Holocaust, the Achilles Heel of a Primordial Jewish Trojan."&lt;ref name=METimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metimes.com/storyview.php?StoryID=20061212-105225-2773r|title=Iran defiant as anger mounts over Holocaust forum|date=2006-12-12|accessdate=2006-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Duke]] gave a speech in which he said: "In Europe you can freely question, ridicule and deny [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. The same is true for the prophet [[Muhammad]], and nothing will happen to you. But offer a single question of the smallest part of the Holocaust and you face prison."&lt;ref name=lefkovits/&gt;

[[Frederick Töben]] told the conference: "Minds are being switched off to the Holocaust dogma as it is being sold as a historical fact and yet we are not able to question it. This is mental rape."&lt;ref name=theodoulou&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20919335-12332,00.html|title=Leader gets lesson on free speech at Iran uni|first=Michael|last=Theodoulou|publisher=The Australian|date=2006-12-13|accessdate=2006-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Aharon Cohen told the conference: "There is no doubt whatsoever, that during World War II there developed a terrible and catastrophic policy and action of [[genocide]] perpetrated by [[Nazi Germany]] against the Jewish people, confirmed by innumerable eyewitness survivors and fully documented again and again...The figure of six million is regularly quoted. One may wish to dispute this actual figure, but the crime was just as dreadful whether the millions of victims numbered six million, five million or four million. The method of murder is also irrelevant, whether it was by [[gas chamber]], firing squads or whatever. The evil was the same. It would be a terrible affront to the memory of those who perished to belittle the guilt of the crime in any way.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;

[[Richard Krege]] maintained his suggestion of diesel exhaust gas chambers to be an "outright lie," and showed a model of the [[Treblinka extermination camp]] to illustrate this.&lt;ref name=METimes/&gt; He claimed that up to 10,000 people died in the camp, but of disease, instead of planned extermination.&lt;ref name=METimes/&gt; He said, "There is no scientific proof to show that this place was an extermination camp. All that exists are the words of some people."&lt;ref name=METimes/&gt;

===Conclusions===
According to ''[[IRNA]]'', the conference participants agreed to start a world foundation for Holocaust studies with [[Mohammad-Ali Ramin]] as its Secretary General. The stated purpose of the foundation was to "find out the truth about holocaust."  More immediate tasks included preparing for the next Holocaust conference and composing the foundation's letter of association. The main office would initially be located in Tehran, though Ramin said it will eventually move to [[Berlin]], "once proper grounds are prepared".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World foundation for holocaust studies set up in Tehran |url=http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-22/0612141586200734.htm |accessdate=2006-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930230003/http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-22/0612141586200734.htm |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

===Iran===
Iran's sole Jewish member of parliament [[Maurice Motamed]] said: "Holding this conference after having a [[International Holocaust Cartoon Competition|competition of cartoons about the Holocaust]] has put a lot of pressure on Jews all over the world;"&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; and that "The conference has upset Iran's 25,000-strong Jewish community."&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news|url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=2006-12-11T085515Z_01_L11639597_RTRUKOC_0_US-IRAN-HOLOCAUST.xml&amp;WTmodLoc=NewsHome-C3-worldNews-3|title=Iran opens conference questioning the Holocaust|author= Hafezi, Parisa|publisher=Reuters|date=2006-11-12|accessdate=2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though reformist demonstrations had been rare since Ahmadinejad took office, a few dozen students burnt pictures of him and chanted "death to the dictator" as Ahmadinejad gave a speech at [[Amirkabir University of Technology]] in Tehran on 12 December 2006.&lt;ref name=theodoulou/&gt; One student activist said the protest was against the "shameful" Holocaust conference, and added that Ahmadinejad had "brought to our country Nazis and racists from around the world."&lt;ref name="theodoulou"/&gt; Ahmadinejad responded by saying: "Everyone should know that Ahmadinejad is prepared to be burnt in the path of true freedom, independence and justice."&lt;ref name=theodoulou/&gt;

However, Ali Akbar Mohtashamipour, Secretary-General of the International Congress to Support the Palestinian Intifada, expressed support for the conference, saying that the "Western and Zionist media have always been aggrandizing the dimensions of the reality of Holocaust, mixing a bit of truth with a lot of lies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/trend-lines/408/irans-appalling-holocaust-conference|title=Iran's Appalling Holocaust Conference|author=The Editors|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{flagicon|United Nations}} [[United Nations]] [[Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]]  said "Denying historical facts, especially on such an important subject as the Holocaust, is just not acceptable. Nor is it acceptable to call for the elimination of any State or people. I would like to see this fundamental principle respected both in rhetoric and in practice by all the members of the international community.  United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan himself visited Iran and had a series of dialogues with the Iranian leadership and other senior-level people.

*During a visit to Iran in September 2006, then [[United Nations]] [[Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] also criticized this conference, saying "I think the tragedy of the Holocaust is an undeniable historical fact and we should really accept that fact and teach people what happened in World War II and ensure it is never repeated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2006/09/03/annan-iran.html | work=[[CBC News]] | title=Iranian PM snubs Annan over nuclear program | date=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty four of the world’s leading policy institutes released a statement on 15 December that they would break off all relations with Iran's [[Institute for Political and International Studies]].

A number of Arab journalists in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom have criticized this conference, arguing that it included unqualified non-historian speakers, spread the hate and propaganda of an extremist Iranian government, defended the heinous crimes of the Nazis, damaged Iran diplomatically at a time when its foreign relations were difficult, and reflected a lack of human and cultural sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/118/2010.htm |title=Criticism of Tehran Holocaust Denial Conference in Arab and Iranian Media |publisher=Memri.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second festival, held in April 2003 due to its growth, attracted even more attention. The additions of an international student film competition and a screenplay competition broadened interest.

'''James VI and I''' (James Charles Stuart; 19 June 1566&amp;nbsp;– 27 March 1625) was [[List of Scottish monarchs|King of Scotland]] as '''James VI''' from 24 July 1567 and [[King of England]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] as '''James I''' from the [[Union of the Crowns|union of the Scottish and English crowns]] on 24 March 1603 until his death in 1625. The kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]] were individual [[sovereign state]]s, with their own parliaments, judiciaries, and laws, though both were ruled by James in [[personal union]].

James was the son of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and a great-great-grandson of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland]], positioning him to eventually accede to all three thrones. James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months, after his mother was compelled to [[Abdication|abdicate]] in his favour. Four different [[regent]]s governed during his minority, which ended officially in 1578, though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583. In 1603, he succeeded the last [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] monarch of England and Ireland, [[Elizabeth I]], who died childless. He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years, a period known after him as the [[Jacobean era]], until his death in 1625 at the age of 58. After the Union of the Crowns, he based himself in England (the largest of the three realms) from 1603, only returning to Scotland once in 1617, and [[style (manner of address)|styled]] himself "[[King of Great Britain and Ireland]]". He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland. In his reign, the [[Plantation of Ulster]] and [[British colonisation of the Americas]] began.

At 57 years and 246 days, James's reign in Scotland was [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign#Scotland|longer than those of any of his predecessors]]. He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England, including the [[Gunpowder Plot]] in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the [[English Parliament]]. Under James, the "Golden Age" of [[Elizabethan literature]] and drama continued, with writers such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Donne]], [[Ben Jonson]], and Sir [[Francis Bacon]] contributing to a flourishing literary culture.{{sfn|Milling|2004|p=155}} James himself was a talented scholar, the author of works such as ''[[Daemonologie]]'' (1597), ''[[The True Law of Free Monarchies]]'' (1598), and ''[[Basilikon Doron]]'' (1599). He sponsored the [[Bible translations|translation of the Bible]] into English that would later be named after him: the [[Authorised King James Version]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rhodes|Richards|Marshall|2003|p=1}}: "James VI and I was the most writerly of British monarchs. He produced original poetry, as well as translation and a treatise on poetics; works on witchcraft and tobacco; meditations and commentaries on the [[Scriptures]]; a manual on kingship; works of [[political theory]]; and, of course, speeches to parliament&amp;nbsp;... He was the patron of Shakespeare, Jonson, Donne, and the translators of the "Authorized version" of the Bible, surely the greatest concentration of literary talent ever to enjoy royal sponsorship in England."&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Anthony Weldon]] claimed that James had been termed "the wisest fool in [[Christianity|Christendom]]", an epithet associated with his character ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2003|p=238}}: "The label 'the wisest fool in Christendom', often attributed to [[Henry IV of France]] but possibly coined by Anthony Weldon, catches James's paradoxical qualities very neatly"; Sir Anthony Weldon (1651), ''The Court and Character of King James I'', quoted by {{harvnb|Stroud|1999|p=27}}: "A very wise man was wont to say that he believed him the wisest fool in Christendom, meaning him wise in small things, but a fool in weighty affairs."&lt;/ref&gt; Since the latter half of the 20th century, historians have tended to revise James's reputation and treat him as a serious and thoughtful monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=6}}: "Historians have returned to reconsidering James as a serious and intelligent ruler"; {{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|pp=4–6}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2003|p=238}}: "In contrast to earlier historians, recent research on his reign has tended to emphasize the wisdom and downplay the foolishness".&lt;/ref&gt; He was strongly committed to a peace policy, and tried to avoid involvement in [[religious wars]], especially the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648) that devastated much of Central Europe. He tried but failed to prevent the rise of hawkish elements in the [[English Parliament]] who wanted war with Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1959|pp=47–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood==

===Birth===
[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland by Arnold van Brounckhorst.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of James as a boy, after [[Arnold Bronckorst]], 1574. [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]], London.]]

James was the only son of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and her second husband, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]]. Both Mary and Darnley were great-grandchildren of [[Henry VII of England]] through [[Margaret Tudor]], the older sister of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Mary's rule over Scotland was insecure, and she and her husband, being [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland|Roman Catholics]], faced a rebellion by [[Protestant]] noblemen. During Mary's and Darnley's difficult marriage,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guy|2004|pp=236–237, 241–242, 270}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Darnley secretly allied himself with the rebels and conspired in the murder of the Queen's private secretary, [[David Rizzio]], just three months before James's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guy|2004|pp=248–250}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

James was born on 19 June 1566 at [[Edinburgh Castle]], and as the eldest son and [[heir apparent]] of the monarch automatically became [[Duke of Rothesay]] and [[Prince of Scotland|Prince]] and [[Great Steward of Scotland]]. He was baptised "Charles James" or "James Charles" on 17 December 1566 in a Catholic ceremony held at [[Stirling Castle]]. His godparents were [[Charles IX of France]] (represented by [[John III, Count of Ligny|John, Count of Brienne]]), [[Elizabeth I of England]] (represented by the [[Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford|Earl of Bedford]]), and [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]] (represented by ambassador Philibert du Croc).{{efn|As the Earl of Bedford was a Protestant, his place in the ceremony was taken by [[Lady Jean Stewart|Jean, Countess of Argyll]].{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=17}} }} Mary refused to let the [[John Hamilton (archbishop)|Archbishop of St Andrews]], whom she referred to as "a pocky priest", spit in the child's mouth, as was then the custom.{{sfn|Donaldson|1974|p=99}} The subsequent entertainment, devised by Frenchman [[Bastian Pagez]], featured men dressed as satyrs and sporting tails, to which the English guests took offence, thinking the satyrs "done against them".{{sfn|Thomson|1827|pp=171–172}}

James's father, Darnley, was murdered on 10 February 1567 at [[Kirk o' Field]], Edinburgh, perhaps in revenge for the killing of Rizzio. James inherited his father's titles of [[Duke of Albany]] and [[Earl of Ross]]. Mary was already unpopular, and her marriage on 15 May 1567 to [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]], who was widely suspected of murdering Darnley, heightened widespread bad feeling towards her.{{efn|Elizabeth I wrote to Mary: "My ears have been so astounded, my mind so disturbed and my heart so appalled at hearing the horrible report of the abominable murder of your late husband and my slaughtered cousin, that I can scarcely as yet summon the spirit to write about it&amp;nbsp;... I will not conceal from you that people for the most part are saying that you will look through your fingers at this deed instead of avenging it and that you don't care to take action against those who have done you this pleasure." Historian [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]] nonetheless concludes: "Not a single piece of uncontaminated evidence has ever been found to show that Mary had foreknowledge of Darnley's murder".{{sfn|Guy|2004|pp=312–313}} In historian David Harris Willson's view, however: "That Bothwell was the murderer no one can doubt; and that Mary was his accomplice seems equally certain."{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=18}} }} In June 1567, Protestant rebels arrested Mary and imprisoned her in [[Loch Leven Castle]]; she never saw her son again. She was forced to [[Act Anent the demission of the Crown in favour of our Sovereign Lord, and his Majesty's Coronation 1567|abdicate on 24 July 1567]] in favour of the infant James and to appoint her illegitimate half-brother, [[James Stewart, Earl of Moray]], as [[regent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guy|2004|pp=364–365}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regencies===

[[File:Mary Stuart James.jpg|thumb|James (right) depicted aged 17 beside his mother [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary]] (left), 1583. In reality, they were separated when he was still a baby.]]

The care of James was entrusted to the [[John Erskine, Earl of Mar (d. 1572)|Earl]] and Countess of Mar, "to be conserved, nursed, and upbrought"&lt;ref&gt;Letter of Mary to Mar, 29 March 1567, quoted by {{harvnb|Stewart|2003|p=27}}: "Suffer nor admit no noblemen of our realm or any others, of what condition soever they be of, to enter or come within our said Castle or to the presence of our said dearest son, with any more persons but two or three at the most."&lt;/ref&gt; in the security of [[Stirling Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stewart|2003|p=33}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; James was anointed King of Scots at the age of thirteen months at [[the Church of the Holy Rude, Stirling]], by [[Adam Bothwell]], [[Bishop of Orkney]], on 29 July 1567.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=11}} The sermon at the [[Coronation#Scotland|coronation]] was preached by [[John Knox]]. In accordance with the religious beliefs of most of the Scottish ruling class, James was brought up as a member of the Protestant [[Church of Scotland]], the Kirk. The [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Council]] selected [[George Buchanan (humanist)|George Buchanan]], [[Peter Young (tutor)|Peter Young]], [[Adam Erskine]] (lay [[abbot of Cambuskenneth]]), and [[David Erskine (abbot)|David Erskine]] (lay [[abbot of Dryburgh]]) as James's [[preceptor]]s or tutors.{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=19}} As the young king's senior tutor, Buchanan subjected James to regular beatings but also instilled in him a lifelong passion for literature and learning.{{sfn|Croft|2003|pp=12–13}} Buchanan sought to turn James into a God-fearing, Protestant king who accepted the limitations of monarchy, as outlined in his [[treatise]] ''De Jure Regni apud Scotos''.{{sfn|Croft|2003|pp=13, 18}}

In 1568, Mary escaped from her imprisonment at Loch Leven Castle, leading to several years of sporadic violence. The Earl of Moray defeated Mary's troops at the [[Battle of Langside]], forcing her to flee to England, where she was subsequently kept in confinement by Elizabeth. On 23 January 1570, Moray was assassinated by [[James Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Spottiswoode|Spottiswoode, John]] (1851), ''History of the Church in Scotland'', Edinburgh: Oliver &amp; Boyd, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofchurcho02spot#page/120/mode/2up vol. 2, p. 120].&lt;/ref&gt; The next regent was James's paternal grandfather [[Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox]], who was carried fatally wounded into Stirling Castle a year later after a raid by Mary's supporters.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=13}} His successor, the Earl of Mar, "took a vehement sickness" and died on 28 October 1572 at Stirling. Mar's illness, wrote [[James Melville of Halhill|James Melville]], followed a banquet at [[Dalkeith Palace]] given by [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton]].{{sfn|Thomson|1827|pp= 248–249}}

Morton was elected to Mar's office and proved in many ways the most effective of James's regents,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stewart|2003|p=45}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|pp=28–29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but he made enemies by his rapacity.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=15}} He fell from favour when Frenchman [[Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox|Esmé Stewart, Sieur d'Aubigny]], first cousin of James's father Lord Darnley and future [[Earl of Lennox]], arrived in Scotland and quickly established himself as the first of James's powerful favourites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|pp=11–12}}; {{harvnb|Stewart|2003|pp=51–63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Morton was executed on 2 June 1581, belatedly charged with complicity in Darnley's murder.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Calderwood]] quoted by {{harvnb|Stewart|2003|p=63}}: "So ended this nobleman, one of the chief instruments of the reformation; a defender of the same, and of the King in his minority, for the which he is now unthankfully dealt with."&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August, James made Lennox the only duke in Scotland.{{sfn|Stewart|2003|p=63}} The king, then fifteen years old, remained under the influence of Lennox for about one more year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|pp=13–15}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rule in Scotland==
[[File:James VI of Scotland aged 20, 1586..jpg|thumb|left|upright|James in 1586, age 20]]

Lennox was a Protestant convert, but he was distrusted by Scottish [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] who noticed the physical displays of affection between him and the king and alleged that Lennox "went about to draw the King to carnal lust".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=15}} In August 1582, in what became known as the [[Raid of Ruthven|Ruthven Raid]], the Protestant earls of [[William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Gowrie]] and [[Archibald Douglas, 8th Earl of Angus|Angus]] lured James into [[Huntingtower Castle|Ruthven Castle]], imprisoned him,{{efn|James's captors forced from him a proclamation, dated 30 August, declaring that he was not being held prisoner "forced or constrained, for fear or terror, or against his will", and that no one should come to his aid as a result of "seditious or contrary reports".{{sfn|Stewart|2003|p=66}} }} and forced Lennox to leave Scotland. During James's imprisonment (19 September 1582), [[John Craig (minister)|John Craig]], whom the king had personally appointed Royal Chaplain in 1579, rebuked him so sharply from the pulpit for having issued a proclamation so offensive to the clergy "that the king wept".{{sfn|Law|1904|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/collectedessays00lawgoog#page/n318/mode/2up 295, 297]}}

After James was liberated in June 1583, he assumed increasing control of his kingdom. He pushed through the [[History of the Scottish Episcopal Church#Episcopal government maintained|Black Acts]] to assert royal authority over the Kirk, and denounced the writings of his former tutor Buchanan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|pp=17–18}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|pp=39, 50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1584 and 1603, he established effective royal government and relative peace among the lords, ably assisted by [[John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane|John Maitland of Thirlestane]] who led the government until 1592.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=20}} An eight-man commission known as the [[Octavians]] brought some control over the ruinous state of James's finances in 1596, but it drew opposition from vested interests. It was disbanded within a year after a riot in Edinburgh, which was stoked by anti-Catholicism and led the court to withdraw to Linlithgow temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|pp=29, 41–42}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|pp=121–124}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One last Scottish attempt against the king's person occurred in August 1600, when James was apparently assaulted by [[Alexander Ruthven]], the [[John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie|Earl of Gowrie]]'s younger brother, at Gowrie House, the seat of the Ruthvens.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|pp=24–25}}; {{harvnb|Stewart|2003|pp=150–157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruthven was run through by James's page [[John Ramsay, 1st Earl of Holderness|John Ramsay]] and the Earl of Gowrie was killed in the ensuing fracas; there were few surviving witnesses. Given James's history with the Ruthvens and the fact that he owed them a great deal of money, his account of the circumstances was not universally believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=45}}; George Nicolson quoted by {{harvnb|Stewart|2003|p=154}}: "It is begun to be noted that the reports coming from the King should differ"; {{harvnb|Williams|1970|p=61}}: "The two principal characters were dead, the evidence of eyewitnesses was destroyed and only King James's version remained"; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|pp=126–130}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1586, James signed the [[Treaty of Berwick (1586)|Treaty of Berwick]] with England. That and the execution of his mother in 1587, which he denounced as a "preposterous and strange procedure", helped clear the way for his succession south of the border.{{efn|James briefly broke off diplomatic relations with England over Mary's execution, but he wrote privately that Scotland "could never have been without factions if she had beene left alive".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=22}} }} Queen Elizabeth was unmarried and childless, and James was her most likely successor. Securing the English succession became a cornerstone of his policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|pp=29–31}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Spanish Armada]] crisis of 1588, he assured Elizabeth of his support as "your natural son and compatriot of your country".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=23}}

===Marriage===
[[File:John De Critz Anne of Denmark 1605.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Anne of Denmark attributed to [[John de Critz]], c. 1605]]

Throughout his youth, James was praised for his chastity, since he showed little interest in women. After the loss of Lennox, he continued to prefer male company.{{sfn|Croft|2003|pp=23–24}} A suitable marriage, however, was necessary to reinforce his monarchy, and the choice fell on fourteen-year-old [[Anne of Denmark]], younger daughter of Protestant [[Frederick II of Denmark|Frederick II]]. Shortly after a [[proxy marriage]] in Copenhagen in August 1589, Anne sailed for Scotland but was forced by storms to the coast of Norway. On hearing that the crossing had been abandoned, James sailed from [[Leith]] with a 300-strong retinue to fetch Anne personally in what historian [[David Harris Willson]] called "the one romantic episode of his life".{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=85}}{{efn|James heard on 7 October of the decision to postpone the crossing for winter.{{sfn|Stewart|2003|pp=107–110}} }} The couple were married formally at the [[Old Bishop's Palace in Oslo|Bishop's Palace in Oslo]] on 23 November and returned to Scotland on 1 May 1590, after stays at [[Elsinore]] and [[Copenhagen]] and a meeting with [[Tycho Brahe]]. By all accounts, James was at first infatuated with Anne and, in the early years of their marriage, seems always to have shown her patience and affection.{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=85–95}} The royal couple produced three children who survived to adulthood: [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]], who died of [[typhoid fever]] in 1612, aged 18; [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]], later [[List of Bohemian consorts|queen of Bohemia]]; and [[Charles I of England|Charles]], his successor. Anne died before her husband in March 1619.

===Witch hunts===
[[File:North Berwick Witches.png|thumb|left|upright|Suspected witches kneeling before King James; ''[[Daemonologie]]'' (1597)]]

James's visit to Denmark, a country familiar with [[witch-hunt]]s, sparked an interest in the study of [[witchcraft]],{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=26}} which he considered a branch of theology.{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=103}} He attended the [[North Berwick witch trials]], the first major [[Witch trials in early modern Scotland|persecution of witches in Scotland]] under the [[Witchcraft Act 1563]]. Several people were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James's ship, most notably [[Agnes Sampson]].

James became obsessed with the threat posed by witches and wrote ''[[Daemonologie]]'' in 1597, a tract inspired by his personal involvement that opposed the practice of witchcraft and that provided background material for Shakespeare's ''[[MacBeth|Tragedy of Macbeth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keay|Keay|1994|p=556}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|pp=103–105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; James personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches.{{sfn|Keay|Keay|1994|p=556}} After 1599, his views became more sceptical.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=27}}; {{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|pp=105, 308–309}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a later letter written in England to his son [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry]], James congratulates the prince on "the discovery of yon little counterfeit wench. I pray God ye may be my heir in such discoveries&amp;nbsp;... most miracles now-a-days prove but illusions, and ye may see by this how wary judges should be in trusting accusations".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Akrigg|1984|p=220}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=309}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Highlands and Islands===
The forcible dissolution of the [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]] by [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] in 1493 had led to troubled times for the western seaboard. He had subdued the organised military might of the [[Hebrides]], but he and his immediate successors lacked the will or ability to provide an alternative form of governance. As a result, the 16th century became known as ''linn nan creach'', the time of raids.{{sfn|Hunter|2000|pp=143, 166}} Furthermore, the effects of the Reformation were slow to affect the ''[[Gàidhealtachd]]'', driving a religious wedge between this area and centres of political control in the [[Central Belt]].{{sfn|Hunter|2000|p=174}}

In 1540, [[James V of Scotland|James V]] had toured the Hebrides, forcing the [[Scottish clan chief|clan chiefs]] to accompany him. There followed a period of peace, but the clans were soon at loggerheads with one another again.{{sfn|Thompson|1968|pp=40–41}} During James VI's reign, the citizens of the Hebrides were portrayed as lawless barbarians rather than being the cradle of Scottish Christianity and nationhood. Official documents describe the peoples of the Highlands as "void of the knawledge and feir of God" who were prone to "all kynd of barbarous and bestile cruelteis".{{sfn|Hunter|2000|p=175}} The [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] language, spoken fluently by James IV and probably by James V, became known in the time of James VI as "Erse" or Irish, implying that it was foreign in nature. The Scottish Parliament decided that Gaelic had become a principal cause of the Highlanders' shortcomings and sought to abolish it.{{sfn|Thompson|1968|pp=40–41}}{{sfn|Hunter|2000|p=175}}
[[File:James VI unite 1609 662019.jpg|thumb|left|Scottish gold coin from 1609]]
It was against this background that James VI authorised the "[[Gentleman Adventurers of Fife]]" to civilise the "most barbarous Isle of Lewis" in 1598. James wrote that the colonists were to act "not by agreement" with the local inhabitants, but "by extirpation of thame". Their landing at [[Stornoway]] began well, but the colonists were driven out by local forces commanded by Murdoch and Neil MacLeod. The colonists tried again in 1605 with the same result, although a third attempt in 1607 was more successful.{{sfn|Hunter|2000|p=175}}{{sfn|Rotary Club of Stornoway|1995|pp=12–13}} The [[Statutes of Iona]] were enacted in 1609, which required clan chiefs to provide support for Protestant ministers to Highland parishes; to outlaw bards; to report regularly to Edinburgh to answer for their actions; and to send their heirs to [[Lowland Scotland]], to be educated in English-speaking Protestant schools.{{sfn|Hunter|2000|p=176}} So began a process "specifically aimed at the extirpation of the Gaelic language, the destruction of its traditional culture and the suppression of its bearers."{{sfn|MacKinnon|1991|p=46}}

In the [[Northern Isles]], James's cousin [[Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney|Patrick Stewart]], [[Earl of Orkney]], resisted the Statutes of Iona and was consequently imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=139}}; {{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; His natural son Robert led an unsuccessful rebellion against James, and the Earl and his son were hanged.{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=321}} Their estates were forfeited, and the [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] islands were annexed to the Crown.{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=321}}

===Theory of monarchy===
[[File:True Law of Free Monarchies.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|James argued a theological basis for monarchy in ''The True Law of Free Monarchies''.]]

In 1597–98, James wrote ''[[The True Law of Free Monarchies]]'' and ''[[Basilikon Doron]]'' (''Royal Gift''), in which he argues a theological basis for monarchy. In the ''True Law'', he sets out the [[divine right of kings]], explaining that kings are higher beings than other men for Biblical reasons, though "the highest bench is the sliddriest to sit upon".&lt;ref&gt;James quoted by {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=131}}: "Kings are called gods by the prophetical [[King David]] because they sit upon God His throne in earth and have the count of their administration to give unto Him."&lt;/ref&gt; The document proposes an absolutist theory of monarchy, by which a king may impose new laws by [[royal prerogative]] but must also pay heed to tradition and to God, who would "stirre up such scourges as pleaseth him, for punishment of wicked kings".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=131–133}}

''Basilikon Doron'' was written as a book of instruction for four-year-old [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]] and provides a more practical guide to kingship.{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=133}} The work is considered to be well written and perhaps the best example of James's prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|pp=134–135}}: "James wrote well, scattering engaging asides throughout the text"; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=132}}: "''Basilikon Doron'' is the best prose James ever wrote".&lt;/ref&gt; James's advice concerning parliaments, which he understood as merely the king's "head court", foreshadows his difficulties with the English Commons: "Hold no Parliaments," he tells Henry, "but for the necesitie of new Lawes, which would be but seldome".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=133}} In the ''True Law'', James maintains that the king owns his realm as a feudal lord owns his fief, because kings arose "before any estates or ranks of men, before any parliaments were holden, or laws made, and by them was the land distributed, which at first was wholly theirs. And so it follows of necessity that kings were the authors and makers of the laws, and not the laws of the kings."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=132}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary patronage===
In the 1580s and 1590s, James promoted the literature of his native country. He published his treatise ''[[Reulis and Cautelis|Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody]]'' in 1584 at the age of 18. It was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue of [[Middle Scots|Scots]], applying Renaissance principles.{{sfn|Jack|1988|pp=126–127}} He also made statutory provision to reform and promote the teaching of music, seeing the two in connection. One act of his reign urges the Scottish [[burgh]]s to reform and support the teaching of music in ''Sang Sculis''.&lt;ref&gt;See: Jack, R. D. S. (2000), "[http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/ScotLit/ASLS/RDSJack.html Scottish Literature: 1603 and all that] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211125608/http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/ScotLit/ASLS/RDSJack.html |date=11 February 2012 }}", [[Association for Scottish Literary Studies]], retrieved 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In furtherance of these aims, he was both patron and head of a loose circle of Scottish [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] court poets and musicians known as the [[Castalian Band]], which included [[William Fowler (makar)|William Fowler]] and [[Alexander Montgomerie]] among others, Montgomerie being a favourite of the King.&lt;ref&gt;Jack, R. D. S. (1985), ''Alexander Montgomerie'', Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; James was himself a poet, and was happy to be seen as a practising member of the group.{{sfn|Jack|1988|p=125}}

By the late 1590s, his championing of native Scottish tradition was reduced to some extent by the increasing likelihood of his succession to the English throne.{{sfn|Jack|1988|p=137}} [[Sir William Alexander, Earl of Stirling|William Alexander]] and other courtier poets started to [[anglicise]] their written language, and followed the king to London after 1603.&lt;ref&gt;Spiller, Michael (1988), "Poetry after the Union 1603–1660", in Craig, Cairns (general editor), ''The History of Scottish Literature'', Aberdeen University Press, vol. 1, pp. 141–152. Spiller points out that the trend, although unambiguous, was generally more mixed.&lt;/ref&gt; James's role as active literary participant and patron made him a defining figure in many respects for English Renaissance poetry and drama, which reached a pinnacle of achievement in his reign,&lt;ref&gt;See for example Rhodes, Neil (2004), "Wrapped in the Strong Arm of the Union: Shakespeare and King James", in Maley, Willy; Murphy, Andrew (eds), ''Shakespeare and Scotland'', Manchester University Press, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; but his patronage of the [[Stylistics (linguistics)|high style]] in the Scottish tradition, which included his ancestor [[James I of Scotland]], became largely sidelined.{{sfn|Jack|1988|pp=137–138}}

Elizabeth I was the last of Henry VIII's descendants, and James was seen as her most likely heir through his great-grandmother [[Margaret Tudor]], who was Henry VIII's oldest sister.{{efn|By the normal rules of succession James had the best claim to the English throne, as the great-great-grandson of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]. However, [[Henry VIII]]'s will had passed over the Scottish line of his oldest sister [[Margaret Tudor|Margaret]] in favour of that of their younger sister [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary]]. In the event, Henry's will was disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stewart|2003|pp=159–161}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|pp=138–141}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} From 1601, in the last years of Elizabeth's life, certain English politicians—notably her chief minister Sir [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]]{{efn|James described Cecil as "king there in effect".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=48}} }}—maintained a [[Secret correspondence of James VI|secret correspondence with James]] to prepare in advance for a smooth succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|pp=161–162}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|pp=154–155}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the Queen clearly dying, Cecil sent James a draft proclamation of his accession to the English throne in March 1603. Elizabeth died in the early hours of 24 March, and James was proclaimed king in London later the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=49}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=158}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 April, James left Edinburgh for London, promising to return every three years (a promise that he did not keep), and progressed slowly southwards. Local lords received him with lavish hospitality along the route and James was amazed by the wealth of his new land and subjects, claiming that he was "swapping a stony couch for a deep feather bed". At Cecil's house, [[Theobalds House|Theobalds]] in Hertfordshire, James was so in awe that he bought it there and then, arriving in the capital on 7 May, nine days after Elizabeth's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=49}}; {{harvnb|Martin|2016|p=315}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|pp=160–164}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His new subjects flocked to see him, relieved that the succession had triggered neither unrest nor invasion.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=50}} On arrival at London, he was mobbed by a crowd of spectators.{{sfn|Stewart|2003|p=169}}

His [[Coronation of the British monarch|English coronation]] took place on 25 July, with elaborate allegories provided by dramatic poets such as [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]] and [[Ben Jonson]]. An outbreak of plague restricted festivities,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stewart|2003|p=172}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=165}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but "the streets seemed paved with men," wrote Dekker. "Stalls instead of rich wares were set out with children, open casements filled up with women."{{sfn|Stewart|2003|p=173}}

The kingdom to which James succeeded, however, had its problems. Monopolies and taxation had engendered a widespread sense of grievance, and the costs of [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|war in Ireland]] had become a heavy burden on the government,{{sfn|Croft|2003|pp=50–51}} which had debts of £400,000.

==Early reign in England==
{{Main|Jacobean era}}
[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland by John De Critz the Elder.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait after [[John de Critz]], c. 1606]]
James survived two conspiracies in the first year of his reign, despite the smoothness of the succession and the warmth of his welcome: the [[Bye Plot]] and [[Main Plot]], which led to the arrest of [[Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham|Lord Cobham]] and Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], among others.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=51}} Those hoping for a change in government from James were disappointed at first when he kept Elizabeth's [[Privy Council]]lors in office, as secretly planned with Cecil,{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=51}} but James soon added long-time supporter [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Henry Howard]] and his nephew [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Thomas Howard]] to the Privy Council, as well as five Scottish nobles.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=51}}{{efn|The introduction of Henry Howard (soon Earl of Northampton) and of Thomas Howard (soon Earl of Suffolk) marked the beginning of the rise of the Howard family to power in England, which culminated in their dominance of James's government after the death of Cecil in 1612. Henry Howard, son of poet [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]], had been a diligent correspondent with James in advance of the succession (James referred to him as "long approved and trusted Howard"). His connection with James may have owed something to the attempt by his brother [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk]], to free and marry Mary, Queen of Scots, leading to his execution in 1572.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guy|2004|pp=461–468}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For details on the Howards, see ''The Trials of Frances Howard'' by David Lindley. Henry Howard is a traditionally reviled figure (Willson [1956] called him "A man of dark counsels and creeping schemes, learned but bombastic, and a most fulsome flatterer"{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=156}}) whose reputation was upgraded by Linda Levy Peck's 1982 biography ''Northampton''.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=6}} }}

In the early years of James's reign, the day-to-day running of the government was tightly managed by the shrewd Cecil, later [[Earl of Salisbury]], ably assisted by the experienced [[Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley|Thomas Egerton]], whom James made Baron Ellesmere and [[Lord Chancellor]], and by [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Thomas Sackville]], soon [[Earl of Dorset]], who continued as [[Lord Treasurer]].{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=51}} As a consequence, James was free to concentrate on bigger issues, such as a scheme for a closer union between England and Scotland and matters of foreign policy, as well as to enjoy his leisure pursuits, particularly hunting.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=51}}

James was ambitious to build on the [[personal union]] [[Union of the Crowns|of the Crowns of Scotland and England]] to establish a single country under one monarch, one parliament, and one law, a plan that met opposition in both realms.{{sfn|Croft|2003|pp=52–54}} "Hath He not made us all in one island," James told the [[English Parliament]], "compassed with one sea and of itself by nature indivisible?" In April 1604, however, the Commons refused his request to be titled "King of Great Britain" on legal grounds.{{efn|English and Scot, James insisted, should "join and coalesce together in a sincere and perfect union, as two twins bred in one belly, to love one another as no more two but one estate".{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=250}} }} In October 1604, he assumed the title "King of Great Britain" instead of "King of England" and "King of Scotland", though Sir [[Francis Bacon]] told him that he could not use the style in "any legal proceeding, instrument or assurance" and the title was not used on English statutes.{{sfn|Willson|1963|pp=249–253}} James forced the [[Parliament of Scotland]] to use it, and it was used on proclamations, coinage, letters, and treaties in both realms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=67}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|pp=249–253}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

James achieved more success in foreign policy. Never having been at war with Spain, he devoted his efforts to bringing the long [[Anglo–Spanish War (1585)|Anglo–Spanish War]] to an end, and [[Treaty of London (1604)|a peace treaty]] was signed between the two countries in August 1604, thanks to skilled diplomacy on the part of Robert Cecil and Henry Howard, now [[Earl of Northampton]], which James celebrated by hosting a great banquet.{{sfn|Croft|2003|pp=52–53}} Freedom of worship for Catholics in England, however, continued to be a major objective of Spanish policy, causing constant dilemmas for James, distrusted abroad for repression of Catholics while at home being encouraged by the Privy Council to show even less tolerance towards them.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=118}}

===Gunpowder Plot===
{{Main|Gunpowder Plot}}

A dissident Catholic, [[Guy Fawkes]], was discovered in the cellars of the parliament buildings on the night of 4–5 November 1605, the eve of the [[State Opening of Parliament|state opening]] of the second session of James's first English Parliament. He was guarding a pile of wood not far from 36 barrels of gunpowder with which Fawkes intended to blow up Parliament House the following day and cause the destruction, as James put it, "not only&amp;nbsp;... of my person, nor of my wife and posterity also, but of the whole body of the State in general".{{sfn|Stewart|2003|p=219}} The sensational discovery of the Gunpowder Plot, as it quickly became known, aroused a mood of national relief at the delivery of the king and his sons. Salisbury exploited this to extract higher subsidies from the ensuing Parliament than any but one granted to Elizabeth.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=64}} Fawkes and others implicated in the unsuccessful conspiracy were executed.

==King and Parliament==
{{Main|James I of England and the English Parliament}}

[[File:James I, VI by John de Critz, c.1606.png|thumb|left|upright|Portrait attributed to [[John de Critz]], c. 1606. [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]].]]

The co-operation between monarch and Parliament following the Gunpowder Plot was atypical. Instead, it was the previous session of 1604 that shaped the attitudes of both sides for the rest of the reign, though the initial difficulties owed more to mutual incomprehension than conscious enmity.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=63}} On 7 July 1604, James had angrily [[Parliamentary session|prorogued]] Parliament after failing to win its support either for full union or financial subsidies. "I will not thank where I feel no thanks due", he had remarked in his closing speech. "...&amp;nbsp;I am not of such a stock as to praise fools&amp;nbsp;... You see how many things you did not well&amp;nbsp;... I wish you would make use of your liberty with more modesty in time to come".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by {{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As James's reign progressed, his government faced growing financial pressures, due partly to creeping inflation but also to the profligacy and financial incompetence of James's court. In February 1610, Salisbury proposed a scheme, known as the [[Great Contract]], whereby Parliament, in return for ten royal concessions, would grant a lump sum of £600,000 to pay off the king's debts plus an annual grant of £200,000.{{sfn|Croft|2003|pp=75–81}} The ensuing prickly negotiations became so protracted that James eventually lost patience and dismissed Parliament on 31 December 1610. "Your greatest error", he told Salisbury, "hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=80}}; {{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|p=167}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=267}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The same pattern was repeated with the so-called "[[Addled Parliament]]" of 1614, which James dissolved after a mere nine weeks when the Commons hesitated to grant him the money he required.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=93}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=348}}.&lt;/ref&gt; James then ruled without parliament until 1621, employing officials such as the merchant [[Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex|Lionel Cranfield]], who were astute at raising and saving money for the crown, and sold baronetcies and other dignities, many created for the purpose, as an alternative source of income.{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=409}}

===Spanish match===
{{Main|Spanish match}}
Another potential source of income was the prospect of a Spanish dowry from a marriage between [[Charles I of England|Charles, Prince of Wales]], and [[Maria Anna of Spain|Infanta Maria Anna of Spain]].{{sfn|Willson|1963|pp=348, 357}} The policy of the [[Spanish match]], as it was called, was also attractive to James as a way to maintain peace with Spain and avoid the additional costs of a war.{{sfn|Schama|2001|p=59}} Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match—which may explain why James protracted the negotiations for almost a decade.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Phillipps Kenyon|Kenyon, J. P.]] (1978). ''Stuart England''. Harmondsworth, England: Penguin Books. pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy was supported by the Howards and other Catholic-leaning ministers and diplomats—together known as the Spanish Party—but deeply distrusted in Protestant England. When Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] was released from imprisonment in 1616, he embarked on a hunt for gold in South America with strict instructions from James not to engage the Spanish.{{sfn|Willson|1963|pp=369–370}} Raleigh's expedition was a disastrous failure, and his son Walter was killed fighting the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=104}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|pp=372–373}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On Raleigh's return to England, James had him executed to the indignation of the public, who opposed the appeasement of Spain.{{sfn|Willson|1963|p= 374–377}} James's policy was further jeopardised by the outbreak of the [[Thirty Years' War]], especially after his Protestant son-in-law, [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]], was ousted from [[Bohemia]] by the Catholic [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand II]] in 1620, and Spanish troops simultaneously invaded Frederick's [[Rhineland]] home territory. Matters came to a head when James finally called a Parliament in 1621 to fund a military expedition in support of his son-in-law.{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=408–416}} The Commons on the one hand granted subsidies inadequate to finance serious military operations in aid of Frederick,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|p=148}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=417}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the other—remembering the profits gained under Elizabeth by naval attacks on Spanish gold shipments—called for a war directly against Spain. In November 1621, roused by Sir [[Edward Coke]], they framed a petition asking not only for war with Spain but also for Prince Charles to marry a Protestant, and for enforcement of the anti-Catholic laws.{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=421}} James flatly told them not to interfere in matters of [[royal prerogative]] or they would risk punishment,{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=422}} which provoked them into issuing a statement protesting their rights, including freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;James quoted by {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=423}}: "We cannot with patience endure our subjects to use such anti-monarchical words to us concerning their liberties, except they had subjoined that they were granted unto them by the grace and favour of our predecessors."&lt;/ref&gt; Urged on by the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] and the Spanish ambassador [[Diego Sarmiento de Acuña, conde de Gondomar|Gondomar]], James ripped the protest out of the record book and dissolved Parliament.{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=243}}

In early 1623, Prince Charles, now 22, and Buckingham decided to seize the initiative and travel to Spain incognito, to win the infanta directly, but the mission proved an ineffectual mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|pp=118–119}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|pp=431–435}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The infanta detested Charles, and the Spanish confronted them with terms that included the repeal of anti-Catholic legislation by Parliament. Though a treaty was signed, the prince and duke returned to England in October without the infanta and immediately renounced the treaty, much to the delight of the British people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cogswell|2005|pp=224–225, 243, 281–299}}; {{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=120}}; {{harvnb|Schama|2001|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Disillusioned by the visit to Spain, Charles and Buckingham now turned James's Spanish policy upon its head and called for a French match and a war against the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] empire.{{sfn|Croft|2003|pp=120–121}} To raise the necessary finance, they prevailed upon James to call another Parliament, which met in February 1624. For once, the outpouring of anti-Catholic sentiment in the Commons was echoed in court, where control of policy was shifting from James to Charles and Buckingham,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krugler|2004|pp=63–64}}: "The aging monarch was no match for the two men closest to him. By the end of the year, the prince and the royal favourite spoke openly against the Spanish marriage and pressured James to call a parliament to consider their now repugnant treaties&amp;nbsp;... with hindsight&amp;nbsp;... the prince's return from Madrid marked the end of the king's reign. The prince and the favourite encouraged popular anti-Spanish sentiments to commandeer control of foreign and domestic policy".&lt;/ref&gt; who pressured the king to declare war and engineered the impeachment of [[Lord Treasurer]] [[Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex|Lionel Cranfield]], by now made [[Earl of Middlesex]], when he opposed the plan on grounds of cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=125}}; {{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|p=195}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of the Parliament of 1624 was ambiguous: James still refused to declare or fund a war, but Charles believed the Commons had committed themselves to finance a war against Spain, a stance that was to contribute to his problems with Parliament in his own reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=126}}: "On that divergence of interpretation, relations between the future king and the Parliaments of the years 1625–9 were to founder".&lt;/ref&gt;

==King and Church==
{{Main|James VI and I and religious issues}}
After the Gunpowder Plot, James sanctioned harsh measures to control [[Nonconformism|non-conforming]] English Catholics. In May 1606, Parliament passed the [[Popish Recusants Act 1605|Popish Recusants Act]], which could require any citizen to take an [[Oath of Allegiance of James I of England|Oath of Allegiance]] denying the Pope's authority over the king.{{sfn|Stewart|2003|p=225}} James was conciliatory towards Catholics who took the Oath of Allegiance,{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=228}} and tolerated crypto-Catholicism even at court.{{efn|A crypto-Catholic was someone who outwardly conformed to Protestantism but remained a Catholic in private.}} [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Henry Howard]], for example, was a crypto-Catholic, received back into the Catholic Church in his final months.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=162}} On ascending the English throne, James suspected that he might need the support of Catholics in England, so he assured the [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]], a prominent sympathiser of the old religion, that he would not persecute "any that will be quiet and give but an outward obedience to the law".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Akrigg|1984|pp=207–208}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|pp=148–149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Millenary Petition]] of 1603, the [[Puritan]] clergy demanded the abolition of confirmation, wedding rings, and the term "priest", among other things, and that the wearing of cap and [[surplice]] become optional.{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=201}} James was strict in enforcing conformity at first, inducing a sense of persecution amongst many Puritans;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=156}}; {{harvnb|Stewart|2003|p=205}}: "In seeking conformity, James gave a name and a purpose to nonconformity"; ''Basilikon Doron'' quoted by {{harvnb|Willson|1963|pp=201, 209}}: "In things indifferent, they are seditious which obey not the magistrates".&lt;/ref&gt; but ejections and suspensions from livings became rarer as the reign continued.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=158}} As a result of the [[Hampton Court Conference]] of 1604, a new translation and compilation of approved books of the Bible was commissioned to resolve discrepancies among different translations then being used. The [[Authorized King James Version]], as it came to be known, was completed in 1611 and is considered a masterpiece of Jacobean prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=157}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|pp=213–215}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is still in widespread use.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=157}}

In Scotland, James attempted to bring the Scottish Kirk "so neir as can be" to the English church and to reestablish [[episcopacy]], a policy that met with strong opposition from [[Presbyterianism|presbyterians]].{{efn|In March 1605, [[John Spottiswood|Archbishop Spottiswood]] wrote to James warning him that sermons against bishops were being preached daily in Edinburgh.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=164}} }} James returned to Scotland in 1617 for the only time after his accession in England, in the hope of implementing Anglican ritual. James's bishops forced his [[Five Articles of Perth]] through a General Assembly the following year, but the rulings were widely resisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=166}}; {{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|pp=185–186}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=320}}.&lt;/ref&gt; James left the church in Scotland divided at his death, a source of future problems for his son.{{efn|Assessments of the Kirk at James's death are divided.

James's sexuality is a matter of dispute.

Some biographers of James argue that the relationships were not sexual.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{citation |last=Lee |first=Maurice |year=1990 |title=Great Britain's Solomon: James VI and I in his Three Kingdoms |location=Urbana |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=0-252-01686-6 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; James's ''[[Basilikon Doron]]'' lists [[sodomy]] among crimes "ye are bound in conscience never to forgive", and James's wife Anne gave birth to seven live children, as well as suffering two stillbirths and at least three other miscarriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lockyer|1981|pp=19, 21}}; [[Alison Weir|Weir, Alison]] (1996), ''Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy'', Random House, {{ISBN|0-7126-7448-9}}, pp. 249–251.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Huguenot poet [[Théophile de Viau]] observed that "it is well known that the king of England / has union with the Duke of Buckingham".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://rictornorton.co.uk/jamesi.htm |title=Queen James and His Courtiers |last=Norton |first=Rictor |author-link=Rictor Norton |work=Gay History and Literature |date=8 January 2000 |accessdate=9 December 2015 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In the original: {{lang|fr|Et ce savant roy d'Angleterre / foutoit-il pas le Boukinquan}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url={{Google books|qzpkFJIo5GYC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |title=The Cabaret poetry of Théophile de Viau: Texts and Traditions |first=Claire Lynn |last=Gaudiani |pages=103–104 |year=1981 |place=Tübingen |publisher=Gunter Narr Verlag |isbn=978-3-87808-892-9 |accessdate=9 December 2015 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Buckingham himself provides evidence that he slept in the same bed as the King, writing to James many years later that he had pondered "whether you loved me now&amp;nbsp;... better than at the time which I shall never forget at Farnham, where the bed's head could not be found between the master and his dog".{{sfn|Lockyer|1981|p=22}} Buckingham's words may be interpreted as non-sexual, in the context of seventeenth-century court life,&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Bray|Bray, Alan]] (2003), ''The Friend'', University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|0-226-07180-4}}, pp. 167–170; Bray, Alan (1994), "Homosexuality and the Signs of Male Friendship in Elizabethan England", pp. 42–44, In: [[Jonathan Goldberg|Goldberg, Jonathan]] (editor), ''Queering the Renaissance'', Duke University Press, {{ISBN|0-8223-1385-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and remain ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Ackroyd|Ackroyd, Peter]] (2014), ''The History of England, Volume III: Civil War'', Macmillan, {{ISBN|978-0-230-70641-5}}, p. 45; Miller, John (2004), ''The Stuarts'', Hambledon, {{ISBN|1-85285-432-4}}, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Earl of Salisbury died in 1612, he was little mourned by those who jostled to fill the power vacuum.{{efn|Northampton assumed the day-to-day running of government business, and spoke of "the death of the little man for which so many rejoice and few do as much as seem to be sorry."{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=269}} }} Until Salisbury's death, the Elizabethan administrative system over which he had presided continued to function with relative efficiency; from this time forward, however, James's government entered a period of decline and disrepute.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=333}}: "Finances fell into chaos, foreign affairs became more difficult. James exalted a worthless favourite and increased the power of the Howards. As government relaxed and honour cheapened, we enter a period of decline and weakness, of intrigue, scandal, confusion and treachery."&lt;/ref&gt; Salisbury's passing gave James the notion of governing in person as his own chief Minister of State, with his young Scottish favourite Robert Carr carrying out many of Salisbury's former duties, but James's inability to attend closely to official business exposed the government to factionalism.{{sfn|Willson|1963|pp=334–335}}

The Howard party, consisting of Northampton, Suffolk, Suffolk's son-in-law [[William Knollys, 1st Earl of Banbury|Lord Knollys]], and [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Charles Howard, Earl of Nottingham]], along with [[Thomas Lake|Sir Thomas Lake]], soon took control of much of the government and its patronage. Even the powerful Carr fell into the Howard camp, hardly experienced for the responsibilities thrust upon him and often dependent on his intimate friend Sir [[Thomas Overbury]] for assistance with government papers.{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=349}}&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Francis Bacon]], speaking at Carr's trial, quoted by {{harvnb|Perry|2006|p=105}}: "Packets were sent, sometimes opened by my lord, sometimes unbroken unto Overbury, who perused them, registered them, made table-talk of them, as they thought good. So I will undertake the time was, when Overbury knew more of the secrets of state, than the council-table did."&lt;/ref&gt; Carr had an adulterous affair with [[Frances Carr, Countess of Somerset|Frances Howard, Countess of Essex]], daughter of the Earl of Suffolk, whom James assisted in securing an annulment of her marriage to free her to marry Carr.{{efn|The commissioners judging the case reached a 5–5 verdict, so James quickly appointed two extra judges guaranteed to vote in favour, an intervention which aroused public censure. When the son of one of the added commissioners ([[Thomas Bilson]]) was knighted after the annulment, he was given the nickname "Sir Nullity Bilson".{{sfn|Lindley|1993|p=120}} }}

In summer 1615, however, it emerged that Overbury had been poisoned. He had died on 15 September 1613 in the Tower of London, where he had been placed at the King's request.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barroll|2001|p=136}}: "Rumours of foul play involving Rochester and his wife with Overbury had, however, been circulating since his death. Indeed, almost two years later, in September 1615, and as James was in the process of replacing Rochester with a new favourite, George Villiers, the Governor of the Tower of London sent a letter to the king informing him that one of the warders in the days before Overbury had been found dead had been bringing the prisoner poisoned food and medicine"; {{harvnb|Lindley|1993|p=146}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|It is very likely that Overbury was the victim of a 'set-up' contrived by the earls of Northampton and Suffolk, with Carr's complicity, to keep him out of the way during the annulment proceedings. Overbury knew too much of Carr's dealings with Frances and he opposed the match with a fervour that made him dangerous, motivated by a deep political hostility to the Howards. It cannot have been difficult to secure James's compliance, because he disliked Overbury and his influence over Carr.{{sfn|Lindley|1993|p=145}} [[John Chamberlain (letter writer)|John Chamberlain]] reported that the King "hath long had a desire to remove him from about the lord of Rochester, as thinking it a dishonour to him that the world should have an opinion that Rochester ruled him and Overbury ruled Rochester".{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=342}} }} Among those convicted of the murder were Frances and Robert Carr, the latter having been replaced as the king's favourite in the meantime by Villiers. James pardoned Frances and commuted Carr's sentence of death, eventually pardoning him in 1624.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=91}} The implication of the King in such a scandal provoked much public and literary conjecture and irreparably tarnished James's court with an image of corruption and depravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1959|p=20}}: "Probably no single event, prior to the attempt to arrest the five members in 1642, did more to lessen the general reverence with which royalty was regarded in England than this unsavoury episode."&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent downfall of the Howards left Villiers unchallenged as the supreme figure in the government by 1619.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|pp=98–99}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=397}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:James I of England by Daniel Mytens.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Portrait by [[Daniel Mytens]], 1621]]
After about the age of fifty, James suffered increasingly from [[arthritis]], [[gout]] and [[kidney stone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=101}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|pp=378, 404}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also lost his teeth and drank heavily.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=101}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=379}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The King was often seriously ill during the last year of his life, leaving him an increasingly peripheral figure, rarely able to visit London, while Buckingham consolidated his control of Charles to ensure his own future.{{efn|Some historians (for example Willson) consider James, who was 58 in 1624, to have lapsed into premature senility;{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=425}} but he suffered from an agonising species of arthritis which constantly left him indisposed, as well as other ailments; and Pauline Croft suggests that James regained some control over his affairs in summer 1624, afforded relief by the warm weather. She sees his continuing refusal to sanction war against Spain as a deliberate stand against the aggressive policies of Charles and Buckingham.{{sfn|Croft|2003|pp=126–127}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=101}}: "James never became a cypher"; {{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|p=174}}: "During the last eighteen months of his life James fought a very effective rearguard action to preserve his control of foreign policy&amp;nbsp;... he never became a cypher."&lt;/ref&gt;}} One theory is that James may have suffered from [[porphyria]], a disease of which his descendant [[George III of the United Kingdom]] exhibited some symptoms. James described his urine to physician [[Théodore de Mayerne]] as being the "dark red colour of Alicante wine".&lt;ref&gt;[[John C. G. Röhl|Röhl, John C. G.]]; Warren, Martin; Hunt, David (1998), ''Purple Secret: Genes, "Madness" and the Royal Houses of Europe'', London: Bantam Press, {{ISBN|0-593-04148-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is dismissed by some experts, particularly in James's case, because he had kidney stones which can lead to blood in the urine, colouring it red.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Dean, Geoffrey (2002), ''The Turnstone: A Doctor's Story''., Liverpool University Press, pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1625, James was plagued by severe attacks of arthritis, gout, and fainting fits, and fell seriously ill in March with [[tertian ague]] and then suffered a stroke. He died at [[Theobalds House]] on 27 March during a violent attack of [[dysentery]], with Buckingham at his bedside.{{efn|A medicine recommended by Buckingham had only served to make the king worse, which led to rumours that the duke had poisoned him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|pp=127–128}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|pp=445–447}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} James's funeral on 7 May was a magnificent but disorderly affair.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Chamberlain (letter writer)|John Chamberlain]] quoted in {{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=129}} and {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=447}}: "All was performed with great magnificence, but&amp;nbsp;... very confused and disorderly."&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop [[John Williams (archbishop)|John Williams]] of Lincoln preached the sermon, observing, "King [[Solomon]] died in Peace, when he had lived about sixty years&amp;nbsp;... and so you know did King James". The sermon was later printed as ''Great Britain's Salomon'' {{sic}}.{{sfn|Croft|2003|pp=129–130}}

James was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]]. The position of the tomb was lost for many years until his lead coffin was found in the [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] vault in the 19th century, during an excavation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Stanley|first=Arthur|title=Historical Memorials of Westminster Abbey|year=1886|publisher=John Murray|location=London|pages=499–526|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Banqueting House 03 crop.jpg|thumb|On the ceiling of the Banqueting House, [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] depicted James being carried to heaven by angels.]]
James was widely mourned. For all his flaws, he had largely retained the affection of his people, who had enjoyed uninterrupted peace and comparatively low taxation during the [[Jacobean era]]. "As he lived in peace," remarked the [[Earl of Kellie]], "so did he die in peace, and I pray God our king [Charles I] may follow him".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=130}} The earl prayed in vain: once in power, [[Charles I of England|Charles]] and [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]] sanctioned a series of reckless military expeditions that ended in humiliating failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stewart|2003|p=348}}: "A 1627 mission to save the [[Huguenots]] of [[Siege of La Rochelle|La Rochelle]] ended in an ignominious siege on the [[Île de Ré|Isle of Ré]], leaving the Duke as the object of widespread ridicule."&lt;/ref&gt; James had often neglected the business of government for leisure pastimes, such as the hunt; and his later dependence on favourites at a scandal-ridden court undermined the respected image of monarchy so carefully constructed by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]].{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=129}}

Under James the [[Plantation of Ulster]] by English and Scots Protestants began, and the [[British colonisation of the Americas|English colonisation of North America]] started its course with the foundation of [[Jamestown, Virginia]], in 1607,{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=146}} and [[Cuper's Cove, Newfoundland]], in 1610. During the next 150 years, England would fight with Spain, the Netherlands, and France for control of the continent, while religious division in Ireland between Protestant and Catholic [[Segregation in Northern Ireland|has lasted for 400 years]]. By actively pursuing more than just a [[personal union]] of his realms, he helped lay the foundations for a unitary British state.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=67}}

According to a tradition originating with anti-[[House of Stuart|Stuart]] historians of the mid-17th-century, James's taste for [[political absolutism]], his financial irresponsibility, and his cultivation of unpopular favourites established the foundations of the [[English Civil War]]. James bequeathed Charles a fatal belief in the [[divine right of kings]], combined with a disdain for Parliament, which culminated in the execution of Charles and the abolition of the monarchy. Over the last three hundred years, the king's reputation has suffered from the acid description of him by Sir [[Anthony Weldon]], whom James had sacked and who wrote treatises on James in the 1650s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|pp=3–4}}: "Often witty and perceptive but also prejudiced and abusive, their status as eye-witness accounts and their compulsive readability led too many historians to take them at face value"; {{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|pp=1–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other influential anti-James histories written during the 1650s include: [[Sir Edward Peyton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Edward Peyton]]'s ''Divine Catastrophe of the Kingly Family of the House of Stuarts'' (1652); [[Arthur Wilson (writer)|Arthur Wilson]]'s ''History of Great Britain, Being the Life and Reign of King James I'' (1658); and [[Francis Osborne]]'s ''Historical Memoirs of the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James'' (1658).&lt;ref&gt;For more on the influence of [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] historians on the tradition of tracing Charles I's errors back to his father's reign, see {{harvnb|Lindley|1993|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Harris Willson]]'s 1956 biography continued much of this hostility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=6}}; {{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of historian [[Jenny Wormald]], Willson's book was an "astonishing spectacle of a work whose every page proclaimed its author's increasing hatred for his subject".{{sfn|Wormald|2011}} Since Willson, however, the stability of James's government in Scotland and in the early part of his English reign, as well as his relatively enlightened views on religion and war, have earned him a re-evaluation from many historians, who have rescued his reputation from this tradition of criticism.{{efn|In recent decades, much scholarship has emphasised James's success in Scotland (though there have been partial dissenters, such as [[Michael Lynch (historian)|Michael Lynch]]), and there is an emerging appreciation of James's successes in the early part of his reign in England.{{sfn|Croft|2003|pp=1–9, 46}} }}

Representative of the new historical perspective is the 2003 biography by [[Pauline Croft]]. Reviewer John Cramsie summarises her findings:&lt;blockquote&gt;Croft's overall assessment of James is appropriately mixed. She recognises his good intentions in matters like Anglo-Scottish union, his openness to different points of view, and his agenda of a peaceful foreign policy within his kingdoms' financial means. His actions moderated frictions between his diverse peoples. Yet he also created new ones, particularly by supporting colonisation that polarised the crown's interest groups in Ireland, obtaining insufficient political benefit with his open-handed patronage, an unfortunate lack of attention to the image of monarchy (particularly after the image-obsessed regime of Elizabeth), pursuing a pro-Spanish foreign policy that fired religious prejudice and opened the door for Arminians within the English church, and enforcing unpalatable religious changes on the Scottish Kirk. Many of these criticisms are framed within a longer view of James' reigns, including the legacy – now understood to be more troubled – which he left Charles I.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=John|last=Cramsie|title=The Changing Reputations of Elizabeth I and James VI &amp; I|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/334|work=Reviews and History: Covering books and digital resources across all fields of history|type=review no. 334|date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Titles and styles===
In Scotland, James was "James the sixth, King of Scotland", until 1604. He was proclaimed "James the first, King of England, France, and Ireland, [[Fidei defensor|defender of the faith]]" in London on 24 March 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Velde, Francois |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/brit-proclamations.htm#James1 |title=Proclamation by the King, 24 March 1603 |publisher=heraldica.org |accessdate=9 February 2013|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October 1604, James issued a proclamation at Westminster changing his style to "King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Velde, Francois |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/britstyles.htm#1604 |title=Proclamation by the King, 20 October 1604 |publisher=heraldica.org |accessdate=9 February 2013|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style was not used on English statutes, but was used on proclamations, coinage, letters, treaties, and in Scotland.{{sfn|Willson|1963|pp=252–253}} James styled himself "King of France", [[English claims to the French throne|in line with other monarchs of England between 1340 and 1800]], although he did not actually rule France.

===Arms===
As King of Scots, James bore the ancient [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|royal arms of Scotland]]: [[Or (heraldry)|Or]], a lion [[rampant]] [[Gules]] armed and langued [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]] within a double [[tressure]] flory counter-flory Gules. The arms were [[Supporter|supported]] by two unicorns [[Argent]] armed, crined and unguled Proper, gorged with a coronet Or composed of crosses patée and [[fleurs de lys]] a chain affixed thereto passing between the forelegs and reflexed over the back also Or. The [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] was a lion [[sejant]] affrontée Gules, imperially crowned Or, holding in the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] paw a sword and in the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] paw a sceptre both erect and Proper.&lt;ref name="pinches159"&gt;[[John Pinches|Pinches, John Harvey]]; Pinches, Rosemary (1974), ''The Royal Heraldry of England'', Heraldry Today, Slough, Buckinghamshire: Hollen Street Press, {{ISBN|0-900455-25-X}}, pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland under James was symbolised heraldically by combining their arms, supporters and [[Heraldic badge|badges]]. Contention as to how the arms should be [[Quartering (heraldry)|marshalled]], and to which kingdom should take precedence, was solved by having different arms for each country.&lt;ref name="pinches168"&gt;Pinches and Pinches, pp. 168–169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arms used in England were: Quarterly, I and IV, quarterly 1st and 4th Azure three fleurs de lys Or (for France), 2nd and 3rd Gules three lions [[Attitude (heraldry)#Passant|passant guardant]] in [[Pale (heraldry)|pale]] Or ([[Royal Arms of England|for England]]); II Or a lion rampant within a tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent ([[Coat of arms of Ireland|for Ireland]], this was the first time that Ireland was included in the royal arms).&lt;ref name="brooke-little"&gt;[[John Brooke-Little|Brooke-Little, J. P.]] (1978) [1950], ''Boutell's Heraldry'' Revised edition, London: Frederick Warne, {{ISBN|0-7232-2096-4}}, pp. 213, 215.&lt;/ref&gt; The supporters became: dexter a lion rampant guardant Or imperially crowned and sinister the Scottish unicorn. The unicorn replaced the [[Welsh Dragon|red dragon]] of [[Cadwaladr]], which was introduced by the Tudors. The unicorn has remained in the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|royal arms of the two united realms]]. The English crest and motto was retained. The compartment often contained a branch of the Tudor rose, with shamrock and thistle engrafted on the same stem. The arms were frequently shown with James's personal motto, ''Beati pacifici''.&lt;ref name="pinches168"/&gt;

The arms used in Scotland were: Quarterly, I and IV Scotland, II England and France, III Ireland, with Scotland taking precedence over England. The supporters were: dexter a unicorn of Scotland imperially crowned, supporting a tilting lance flying a banner Azure a saltire Argent ([[Flag of Scotland|Cross of Saint Andrew]]) and sinister the crowned lion of England supporting a similar lance flying a banner Argent a cross Gules ([[St George's Cross|Cross of Saint George]]). The Scottish crest and motto was retained, following the [[Scottish heraldry|Scottish practice]] the motto ''In defens'' (which is short for ''[[In My Defens God Me Defend]]'') was placed above the crest.&lt;ref name="pinches168"/&gt;

As [[Royal Badges of England|royal badges]] James used: the Tudor rose, the thistle (for Scotland; first used by [[James III of Scotland]]), the Tudor rose [[Dimidiation|dimidiated]] with the thistle ensigned with the royal crown, a harp (for Ireland) and a fleur de lys (for France).&lt;ref name="brooke-little"/&gt;

The Kanamara Matsuri is centered on a local [[penis]]-venerating shrine. The legend being that a jealous sharp-toothed demon hid inside the [[vagina]] of a young woman the demon fell in love with and bit off penises of two young men on their wedding nights.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/04/07/kanamara-matsuri-2014_n_5105892.html|title=Kanamara Matsuri 2014: What You Should Know About Japan's Penis Festival (NSFW PHOTOS)|publisher=huffingtonpost.ca|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that the woman sought help from a blacksmith, who fashioned an iron [[phallus]] to break the demon's teeth, which led to the enshrinement of the item.&lt;ref name="metropolis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.metropolis.co.jp/tokyotravel/tokyojapantravel/365/tokyojapantravelinc.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406163730/http://archive.metropolis.co.jp/tokyotravel/tokyojapantravel/365/tokyojapantravelinc.htm |archive-date=2010-04-06 |dead-url=yes |title=Metropolis - Japan Travel: Kawasaki - Heads up |accessdate=2014-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This legend in [[Ainu language]] was published as "The Island of Women" by [[Basil Hall Chamberlain]]&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, B. H. "The Island of Women" ''Aino Folk-Tales'', 1888. pp. [[s:Aino Folk-Tales#vii|vii]], [[s:Aino Folk-Tales#37|37]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kanayama Shrine was popular among [[prostitute]]s who wished to pray for protection from [[sexually transmitted infections]].&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/04/04/kanamara-matsuri-penis-festival_n_5087119.html|title=Kanamara Matsuri: When Does Japan's Penis Festival Start? (NSFW PHOTOS)|publisher=huffingtonpost.ca|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also said the shrine offers divine protections for business prosperity, and for the clan's prosperity; and for easy delivery, marriage, and married-couple harmony.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

The festival started in 1969.&lt;ref name=php&gt;[https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=UIKLK5rdt-wC&amp;pg=RA1-PA47 世界も驚くニッポン旅行100: テーマでめぐる!47都道府県ローカル旅] PHP研究所, Jul 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the festival has become something of a tourist attraction and is used to raise money for [[HIV]] research.&lt;ref name="heraldsun"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/travel/photos-fn2wzol2-1225975486025?page=4 |title=Kanamara-Matsuri {{!}} World's weirdest festivals |publisher=Herald Sun &lt;!--|archive-url=archive.is/kOBO9#selection-751.10-751.29 |archive-date=April 10, 2014--&gt;}} {{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the tournaments were recurring, but have not been held in the last two to three years and others were one-off tournament held for a special event.

The first ''Copa de Arena Mexico'' tournament was a one night, four team single-elimination tournament was held on December 10, 1999 and was also called ''Torneo Siglo XXI'' ("21st Century Tournament"). The tournament was won by "''[[Los Infernales|Los Guerreros del Infierno]]''" ([[El Satánico]], [[Rey Bucanero]] and [[Último Guerrero]]), a team name that Bucanero and Guerrero would later use when they split from El Satánico to form their own faction. The winners were given a trophy but no other tangible award was given as a result of the victory. The tournament included four teams who all teamed on a regular basis both before and after the tournament.&lt;ref name=CopaMexico99&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|chapter=Mexico: Copa de Arena Mexico|page=397|year=2000|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and last ''Copa de Arena Mexico'' tournament was a one night eight team single-elimination tournament, held on July 5, 2002 and was won by "Team Tall" ([[Black Warrior (wrestler)|Black Warrior]], [[Lizmark Jr.]], and [[Rayo de Jalisco Jr.]]). The win made Black Warrior the only wrestler to win the tournament more than once. The winners were given a trophy but no other tangible award was given as a result of the victory. Some of the teams in the tournament worked together on a regular basis, others were created for the tournament. Team Giant only consisted of two members, [[Giant Silva]] and [[Mr. Niebla]], due to the size of Giant Silva CMLL counted him as two wrestlers for this tournament and most of the matches he participated in.&lt;ref name="ByL2593"&gt;{{cite news|title=2002: considerar detrás|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|id=2593|date=January 19, 2003|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wrestling is a family tradition in [[Lucha libre]], with a large number of second or even third generation wrestlers following in the footsteps of their relatives.&lt;ref name=MondoFamily/&gt; [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]]  (CMLL) held a [[tag team]] tournament on September 1, 1995 to pay homage to the wrestling families by holding a tournament for second or third generation wrestlers. In a few cases the family relationship was not a blood relationship, but more of a storyline with the "Junior" wrestler either paying to use the name or being given the name by the "Senior". The winners got a trophy and no other tangible reward. The second generation concept led to CMLL creating the ''[[La Copa Junior]]'' tournament in early 1996.&lt;ref name=Junior1996&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/emll/second.html#1996|title=Copa Junior Tournament 1996|date=February 23 – March 31, 1996|accessdate=October 20, 2012|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CMLL Second Generation Tag Team Tournament was won by the team of [[Apolo Dantés]] and [[Emilio Charles Jr.]]&lt;ref name=2ndTag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/emll/second.html#1995|title=Copa Junior Tag Team Tournament 1995|date=September 1, 1995|accessdate=November 12, 2012|work=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mass sexual assault''' of women in public by [[Arab]] men has been documented in [[Egypt]] since 2005.{{refn|group=n|[[Amnesty International]], 2015: "The phenomenon of mob attacks was first documented in May 2005, when groups of men were reportedly hired by the authorities to attack women journalists taking part in a protest calling for the boycott of a referendum on constitutional reform.

In these assaults, assailants would encircle a woman while outer rings of men deter rescuers. The attackers regularly pretended to be there to help the women, adding to the confusion. Women reported being groped, stripped, beaten, bitten, penetrated with fingers, and raped.&lt;ref name=Amnesty2015/&gt;{{rp|38–41}} The attacks were described as the "circle of hell."{{refn|group=n|[[Amnesty International]], 2015: "Activists have called the attacks 'the circle of hell', referring to how the mob drags the woman or girl into the centre of the group while attacking her."&lt;ref name=Amnesty2015/&gt;{{rp|9}}{{pb}}

Commentators say the attacks reflect an [[Islamic]] [[Misogyny|misogynist]] ideology that penalizes women for leaving the house, seeks to terrorize them out of public life, and views sexual violence as a source of shame for the victim, not the attacker.&lt;ref name=Nazra2013&gt;Magda Adly, [http://nazra.org/sites/nazra/files/attachments/compilation-_of_sexual-violence_-testimonies_between_20111_2013_en.pdf "Sexual Assault and Rape in Tahrir Square and its Vicinity: A Compendium of Sources 2011–2013"], El-Nadeem Center for Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence and Torture, with the Nazra for Feminist Studies, and the New Woman Foundation, February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4–8}}

{{further|Rape in Egypt|Women in Egypt|Feminism in Egypt}}
Sexual harassment was barely discussed in Egypt before 2006. The [[Egyptian Center for Women's Rights]] sought to draw attention to it, but the public's response was that it was an American idea wrongly applied to Egyptian society.{{refn|group=n|From the start, ECWR [Egyptian Centre for Women's Rights] referred to the phenomenon of sexual harassment as ''el-taharruah el-ginsy'', which was met with confusion, embarrassment, anger, and most often denial. Salient elements of public feedback at the time were that taḥarrush did not exist in Egypt and that it was an American concept that could not be directly applied in the Egyptian context."&lt;ref name=Abdelmonem2015a&gt;{{cite journal |last = Abdelmonem |first = Angie |title = Reconceptualizing Sexual Harassment in Egypt: A Longitudinal Assessment of ''el-Taharrush el-Ginsy'' in Arabic Online Forums and Anti-Sexual Harassment Activism |journal = Kohl: A Journal for Body and Gender Research |volume = 1 |issue = 1 |pages = 23–41 |publisher = Coalition for Sexual and Bodily Rights in Muslim Societies |date = Summer 2015 |url = http://gsrc-mena.org/kohl/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Reconceptualizing-Sexual-Harassment-in-Egypt.pdf |ref = harv |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160113193756/http://gsrc-mena.org/kohl/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Reconceptualizing-Sexual-Harassment-in-Egypt.pdf |archivedate = 13 January 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}}}}

[[Mass sexual assault]] was first documented during the [[Egyptian constitutional referendum, 2005|Egyptian constitutional referendum]] on 25 May 2005, on what became known as "Black Wednesday," when women demonstrators were sexually assaulted by a group of [[agents provocateur]]s, groups of men who had arrived on buses, as police watched and did nothing to intervene.{{refn|group=n|''[[Al Akhbar (Egypt)|Al Akhbar]]'', 2012: "[T]here are indications that the practice of sexual harassment originated from the authorities themselves&amp;nbsp;... In May 2005, the police recruited paid gangs to sexually harass women taking part in marches in downtown Cairo.&amp;nbsp;... The human rights groups asserted that 'the assaults against women in the demonstrations happened under the watchful eyes of uniformed security officers, and often on their direct orders.' After this incident, sexual harassment spread across the country like wildfire."&lt;ref name=Kassab20Sept2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Slackman10June2005&gt;Slackman, Michael (10 June 2005).

The issue attracted more discussion following the [[Eid al-Fitr]] holiday in 2006, when on 24 October a crowd of young men who had been denied entry to a cinema in Cairo engaged in a five-hour-long mass sexual assault of women in [[Talaat Harb Street]].&lt;ref&gt;Sherifa Zuhur, "Women's Quest for Equality in Post-Revolutionary Egypt," in Claudia Derichs, Dana Fennert (eds.), ''Women's Movements and Countermovements'', Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bChQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36 36].{{pb}}

The crowd behind them is extremely large, a couple of hundred strong, and soon surrounds the girls (around 1'20). They then pass down a side-street, partially out of view, which gives Sherif time to spot a man in uniform&amp;nbsp;– a police officer?&amp;nbsp;– looking down the street at the commotion, who then gets back in his vehicle (1'50).

[[Amnesty International]] described a series of attacks that took place on January 25, 2013 against protesters in the vicinity of [[Tahrir Square]].  The victims of these attacks said they typically lasted from a few minutes to over an hour, and that the men were usually in their 20s and 30s. Victims were aged seven to 70.&lt;ref name=Amnesty2015&gt;[https://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/mde_120042015.pdf "Circles of Hell: Domestic, Public and State Violence Against Women in Egypt"], Amnesty International, January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41}}&lt;ref name=Amnesty2013&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/egyptreport-genderbasedviolenceintahrirsquare_0.pdf "Egypt: Gender-based violence against women around Tahrir Square"], Amnesty International, February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing the Tahrir Square attacks, women said they were often separated from friends by the crowd, or out alone, and encircled by a large group of men who groped their breasts, genitals and buttocks. Attempts were made to pull or cut their clothes off, and their bodies were  pulled in different directions as men move her through the crowd. Women regularly report digital penetration of the vagina and anus. Attackers have used sticks, knives and blades, and in several cases sharp objects have been inserted into the victim's vagina.&lt;ref name=Amnesty2015/&gt;{{rp|41}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = ''Anon'' | title = Testimony from a Survival of Gang Rape on Tahrir Square Vicinity (blog post) | url = http://nazra.org/en/2013/01/testimony-survival-gang-rape-tahrir-square-vicinity | publisher = Nazra for Feminist Studies | date = 26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One student protester described how a group of men formed a ring around her in Tahrir Square on 25 January 2013:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
The last thing I heard was "don't worry," followed by screaming&amp;nbsp;... At first they tried to rip my bag out of my hands; I then felt hands all over my body, tearing down my trousers and long jacket; they were undoing its clips.&amp;nbsp;... They pulled my trousers and pants down, but couldn’t get them all the way down because I was wearing boots that they couldn’t manage to get off&amp;nbsp;... I felt hands touch me from all directions, and I was moved, almost carried, inside the circle as people continued saying: "don’t worry." They were saying that while violating me&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=Amnesty2015/&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perpetrators regularly claim to be helping the women when in fact they are attacking them, which increases the difficulty for rescuers and leaves the women not knowing who to trust. Women testify to having heard attackers say: "Do not be afraid; I'm protecting you," or "you are like my sister, do not be afraid."&lt;ref name=Nazra2013/&gt;{{rp|6}} People genuinely trying to help find themselves being beaten and sexually assaulted too.&lt;ref name=Amnesty2015/&gt;{{rp|41}}

Volunteer groups in Cairo, including OpAntiSH ([[Operation Anti Sexual Harassment]]), organize "extraction teams" who push into the circles wearing padded clothing, helmets and gloves, and get the women out. Other OpAntiSH teams carry spare clothes and medical supplies, operate a hotline so that the extraction teams know where to go, and offer counselling and legal and medical help. They were called to 19 incidents on 25 January 2013 alone, and were able to respond to 15 of them.&lt;ref&gt;Chick, Kristen (1 February 2013).

Rescuers have described how assailants have set up makeshift tea stands in the crowd; in one case boiling water from a tea stand was thrown over rescuers who had formed a protective ring around a woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ema.revues.org/3536 Fernandez 2015], para.&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;/ref&gt; During an attack in Cairo in 2013, the attackers allowed an ambulance to reach the woman only when the driver told them she was dead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/mde_120042015.pdf Amnesty 2015], p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariz Tadros of the [[Institute of Development Studies]] notes that "social" - that is, non-politically-motivated - sexual assault in Egypt is a result of diverse motives, including pleasure, a desire to dominate women, and a "perceived sense of sexual deprivation" because marriage may be financially prohibitive.&lt;ref name=Tadros2013/&gt;{{rp|7}} Journalist [[Shereen El Feki]], author of ''Sex and the Citadel'' (2013), writing about sexual harassment in general (''taharrush jinsi''), blamed unemployment, social media and a "breakdown of family surveillance" because of overworked parents.&lt;ref&gt;El Feki 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;124.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one survey 60 percent of the highest educated women in Egypt blamed the victims (of general sexual harassment) and "provocative" clothing, as did 75 percent of the least educated women.&lt;ref&gt;El Feki, 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;126.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 UN survey, 75.7% of women who had been sexually harassed said it occurred while they were wearing conservative clothing without makeup. When asked about causes, female respondents cited "foreign pornographic programs" (97.2%), "non-enforcement of the religious principles" (95.5%) and "non-compliance of girls with religious values with regard to appearance" (94.3%). Male respondents cited "wearing tight clothes" (96.3%) and that the women "do not conform to religious ethics with regard to their appearance" (97.5%).&lt;ref name=unwomen2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgvn.de/fileadmin/user_upload/DOKUMENTE/English_Documents/Sexual-Harassment-Study-Egypt-Final-EN.pdf|title=Study on Ways and Methods to Eliminate Sexual Harassment in Egypt|publisher=UN Women| date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nehad Abu Komsan, head of the Egyptian Center for Women's Rights, argues that sexual harassment is a symptom of the country's political and economic oppression, and that men are "lashing out at those next down the line in the [[patriarchy]]."&lt;ref name=ElFeki2013&gt;[[Shereen El Feki|El Feki, Shereen]] (2013). ''Sex and the Citadel: Intimate Life in a Changing Arab World'', Doubleday Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|126}} Hussein el Shafie of OpAntiSH has argued that the attacks are like a "tear-gas bomb" to get women off the streets – not sexual but stemming from a sense of entitlement.&lt;ref name=Auger&gt;Auger, Bridgette (undated).

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
[A] general attitude of sexual entitlement prevails, that is, a belief that the bodies of women present in the context of demonstrations are safe territories for sexual attacks underlies nearly all testimonies. With testimonies that speak of hundreds of hands persistently raping women, with hundreds  more watching the brutal attacks, some while even smiling, it becomes clear that we are faced with an overwhelming challenge, namely a state and a society that have internalized sexual violence against women as the law of the land.&lt;ref name=Nazra2013/&gt;{{rp|8}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first jail sentence in Egypt for sexual harassment came in 2008 after a man molested a woman in the street from his car.&lt;ref&gt;Zuhur 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bChQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36 36]; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7682951.stm "Egyptian sexual harasser jailed"], BBC News, 21 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, two films&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Scheherazade, Tell Me a Story]]'' ([[Yousry Nasrallah]], 2009) and ''[[678 (film)|678]]'' (Muhammad Diyab, 2010)&amp;nbsp;– brought the issue of sexual assault to cinemas.&lt;ref name=Abdelmonem2015a/&gt;{{rp|26}}

The mass sexual assaults have been on the increase since the fall of [[Hosni Mubarak]] on 11 February 2011, the end of the 2011 revolution, particularly during protests in [[Tahrir Square]] and religious festivals.&lt;ref name=Dugan11Nov2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kassab20Sept2012/&gt;

According to Serena Hollmeyer Taylor and other researchers at the [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]], the revolution saw a drop in complaints of harassment.

Five hundred cases of mass sexual assault were documented between June 2012 and June 2014.&lt;ref name=Amnesty2015/&gt;{{rp|10}} An anti-harassment group, I Saw Harassment, reported four cases on 8 June 2014 alone, during President [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]]'s inaugural celebrations, while Operation Anti-Sexual Harassment reported ten. The ''New York Times'' wrote of the celebrations:

The attacks in Egypt, and the term ''taharrush'' ([[#Local terminology|"harassment" in Arabic]]), came to wider attention in 2016 when women in Europe reported having been sexually assaulted by groups of North African men during [[New Year's Eve]] celebrations. German police compared the attacks to the mass sexual assaults in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Nordrhein-Westfalen report, 10 Jan 2016"/&gt;

Most of the attacks took place in Cologne, Germany, where 359 women filed sexual-assault complaints.&lt;ref&gt;Herwartz, Christoph (20 January 2016).

According to a German local government report, the German federal police compared the attacks to "''taharrush gamea'' (collective sexual harassment in crowds)," a practice they said existed in Arab countries, as reported by the media during the Egyptian revolution.&lt;ref name="Nordrhein-Westfalen report, 10 Jan 2016"&gt;[http://www.mik.nrw.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Redakteure/Dokumente/Themen_und_Aufgaben/Schutz_und_Sicherheit/160111ssia/160111berichtmik.pdf "Bericht des Ministeriums für Inneres und Kommunales über die Übergriffe am Hauptbahnhof Köln in der Silvesternacht"], Ministerium für Inneres und Kommunales des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen, 10 January 2016, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–15.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} The transliteration, ''taharrush gamea'', followed the [[Egyptian Arabic phonology|Egyptian pronunciation]], ''taḥarrush gamāʿī'' (with a [[Hard and soft G|hard ⟨g⟩]]), rather than the [[Arabic phonology|standard pronunciation]], ''taḥarrush jamāʿī''.&lt;ref name=MayerNYT14Jan2016&gt;{{cite news |last=Mayer |first = Farhana | title = The Sexual Attacks on Women in Europe Reflect a Misogynistic Mind-Set That Must Be Dismantled |url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/01/14/pulling-in-the-welcome-mat-as-fear-of-attacks-rise/the-sexual-attacks-on-women-in-europe-reflect-a-misogynistic-mind-set-that-must-be-dismantled | work = The New York Times | date = 14 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''Die Welt'' on 10 January 2016, headlined "The phenomenon 'taharrush gamea' has arrived in Germany", made international news.&lt;ref name=Lutz10Jan2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lutz|first1=Martin|title=Das Phänomen "taharrush gamea" ist in Deutschland angekommen|trans-title=The phenomenon "taharrush gamea" has arrived in Germany|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article150813517/Das-Phaenomen-taharrush-gamea-ist-in-Deutschland-angekommen.html | work = Die Welt|date=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events sparked a debate about [[sexism]], [[racism]] and the [[European migrant crisis]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14678">'''Mean time between failures''' ('''MTBF''') is the predicted elapsed time between inherent [[failure]]s of a mechanical or electronic system, during normal system operation. MTBF can be calculated as the [[arithmetic mean]] (average) time between [[failure]]s of a system. The term is used for repairable systems, while '''mean time to failure''' ('''MTTF''') denotes the expected time to failure for a non-repairable system.&lt;ref name="lienig"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig, H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-55840-0_4|pp=49–56|chapter=Reliability Analysis|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The definition of MTBF depends on the definition of what is considered a [[failure]]. For complex, [[repairable]] systems, failures are considered to be those out of design conditions which place the system out of service and into a state for repair. Failures which occur that can be left or maintained in an unrepaired condition, and do not place the system out of service, are not considered failures under this definition.&lt;ref&gt;Colombo, A.G., and Sáiz de Bustamante, Amalio: ''Systems reliability assessment &amp;ndash; Proceedings of the Ispra Course held at the Escuela Tecnica Superior de Ingenieros Navales, Madrid, Spain, September 19&amp;ndash;23, 1988 in collaboration with Universidad Politecnica de Madrid'', 1988&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, units that are taken down for routine scheduled maintenance or inventory control are not considered within the definition of failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Defining Failure: What Is MTTR, MTTF, and MTBF?|url = http://blog.fosketts.net/2011/07/06/defining-failure-mttr-mttf-mtbf/|website = Stephen Foskett, Pack Rat|access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher the MTBF, the longer a system is likely to work before failing.

==Overview==
Mean time between failures (MTBF) describes the expected time between two failures for a repairable system. For example, three identical systems starting to function properly at time 0 are working until all of them fail. The first system failed at 100 hours, the second failed at 120 hours and the third failed at 130 hours. The MTBF of the system is the average of the three failure times, which is 116.667 hours. If the systems are non-repairable, then their [[Mean time between failures#Variations of MTBF|MTTF]] would be 116.667 hours.

In general, MTBF is the "up-time" between two failure states of a repairable system during operation as outlined here:

[[File:Time between failures.svg]]

For each observation, the "down time" is the instantaneous time it went down, which is after (i.e. greater than) the moment it went up, the "up time". The difference ("down time" minus "up time") is the amount of time it was operating between these two events.

By referring to the figure above, the MTBF of a component is the sum of the lengths of the operational periods divided by the number of observed failures:
:&lt;math&gt;
\text{MTBF} = \frac{\sum{(\text{start of downtime} - \text{start of uptime})}}{\text{number of failures}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In a similar manner, mean down time (MDT) can be defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\text{MDT} = \frac{\sum{(\text{start of uptime} - \text{start of downtime})}}{\text{number of failures}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Calculation ==
MTBF is defined by the arithmetic mean value of the [[reliability function]] ''R''(''t''), which can be expressed as the [[expected value]] of the [[density function]] ''ƒ''(''t'') of time until failure:&lt;ref name="birolini"&gt;Alessandro Birolini: ''Reliability Engineering: Theory and Practice''. Springer, Berlin 2013, {{ISBN|978-3-642-39534-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\text{MTBF} = \int_0^\infty R(t)\, dt = \int_0^\infty tf(t)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

Any practically-relevant calculation of MTBF or probabilistic failure prediction based on MTBF requires that the system is working within its "useful life period", which is characterized by a relatively constant [[failure rate]] (the middle part of the "[[bathtub curve]]") when only random failures are occurring.&lt;ref name="lienig" /&gt;

Assuming a constant failure rate results in a failure density function as follows:
&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \lambda e^{-\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;, 
which, in turn, simplifies the above mentioned calculation of MTBF to the reciprocal of the [[failure rate]] of the system&lt;ref name="lienig" /&gt;&lt;ref name="birolini" /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\text{MTBF} = \frac{1}{\lambda}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

The units used are typically hours or lifecycles. This critical relationship between a system's MTBF and its failure rate allows a simple conversion/calculation when one of the two quantities is known and an exponential distribution (constant failure rate, i.e., no systematic failures) can be assumed.

Once the MTBF of a system is known, the [[probability]] that any one particular system will be operational at time equal to the MTBF can be estimated.&lt;ref name="lienig" /&gt;
Under the assumption of a constant failure rate, any one particular system will survive to its calculated MTBF with a probability of 36.8% (i.e., it will fail before with a probability of 63.2%).&lt;ref name="lienig" /&gt; The same applies to the MTTF of a system working within this time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Reliability and MTBF Overview|url= http://www.vicorpower.com/documents/quality/Rel_MTBF.pdf |publisher= Vicor Reliability Engineering |accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
The MTBF value can be used as a system reliability parameter or to compare different systems or designs. This value should only be understood conditionally as the “mean lifetime” (an average value), and not as a quantitative identity between working and failed units.&lt;ref name="lienig" /&gt;

Since MTBF can be expressed as “average life (expectancy)”, many engineers assume that 50% of items will have failed by time ''t'' = MTBF. This inaccuracy can lead to bad design decisions. Furthermore, probabilistic failure prediction based on MTBF implies the total absence of systematic failures (i.e., a constant failure rate with only intrinsic, random failures), which is not easy to verify.&lt;ref name="birolini" /&gt; Assuming no systematic errors, the probability of failure during a duration, T, is calculated as exp^(-T/MTBF). 

MTBF value prediction is an important element in the development of products. Reliability engineers and design engineers often use reliability software to calculate a product's MTBF according to various methods and standards (MIL-HDBK-217F, Telcordia SR332, Siemens Norm, FIDES,UTE 80-810 (RDF2000), etc.). The Mil-HDBK-217 reliability calculator manual in combination with RelCalc software (or other comparable tool) enables MTBF reliability rates to be predicted based on design.

A concept which is closely related to MTBF, and is important in the computations involving MTBF, is the [[mean down time]] (MDT). MDT can be defined as mean time which the system is down after the failure. Usually, MDT is considered different from MTTR (Mean Time To Repair); in particular, MDT usually includes organizational and logistical factors (such as business days or waiting for components to arrive) while MTTR is usually understood as more narrow and more technical.

==MTBF and MDT for networks of components==

Two components &lt;math&gt;c_1,c_2&lt;/math&gt; (for instance hard drives, servers, etc.) may be arranged in a network, in [[Series and parallel circuits|''series'' or in ''parallel'']]. The terminology is here used by close analogy to electrical circuits, but has a slightly different meaning. We say that the two components are in series if the failure of ''either'' causes the failure of the network, and that they are in parallel if only the failure of ''both'' causes the network to fail. The MTBF of the resulting two-component network with repairable components can be computed according to the following formulae, assuming that the MTBF of both individual components is known:&lt;ref name="auroraconsultingengineering"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://auroraconsultingengineering.com/doc_files/Reliability_series_parallel.doc|title=Reliability Characteristics for Two Subsystems in Series or Parallel or n Subsystems in m_out_of_n Arrangement (by Don L. Lin)|last=|first=|date=|website=auroraconsultingengineering.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dr. David J. Smith|title=Reliability, Maintainability and Risk|edition=eighth|isbn=978-0080969022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{mtbf}(c_1 ; c_2) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\text{mtbf}(c_1)} + \frac{1}{\text{mtbf}(c_2)}} = \frac{\text{mtbf}(c_1)\times \text{mtbf}(c_2)}  {\text{mtbf}(c_1) + \text{mtbf}(c_2)}\;,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c_1 ; c_2&lt;/math&gt; is the network in which the components are arranged in series.

For the network containing parallel repairable components, to find out the MTBF of the whole system, in addition to component MTBFs, it is also necessary to know their respective MDTs. Then, assuming that MDTs are negligible compared to MTBFs (which usually stands in practice), the MTBF for the parallel system consisting from two parallel repairable components can be written as follows:&lt;ref name="auroraconsultingengineering" /&gt;&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;

\begin{align}\text{mtbf}(c_1 \parallel c_2) &amp;= \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\text{mtbf}(c_1)}\times\text{PF}(c_2,\text{mdt}(c_1))+\frac{1}{\text{mtbf}(c_2)}\times\text{PF}(c_1,\text{mdt}(c_2))} 
\\[1em]&amp;= \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\text{mtbf}(c_1)}\times\frac{\text{mdt}(c_1)}{\text{mtbf}(c_2)}+\frac{1}{\text{mtbf}(c_2)}\times\frac{\text{mdt}(c_2)}{\text{mtbf}(c_1)}} 
\\[1em]&amp;= \frac{\text{mtbf}(c_1)\times \text{mtbf}(c_2)}  {\text{mdt}(c_1) + \text{mdt}(c_2)}\;,

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c_1 \parallel c_2&lt;/math&gt; is the network in which the components are arranged in parallel, and &lt;math&gt;PF(c,t)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of failure of component &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; during "vulnerability window" &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

Intuitively, both these formulae can be explained from the point of view of failure probabilities. First of all, let's note that the probability of a system failing within a certain timeframe is the inverse of its MTBF. Then, when considering series of components, failure of any component leads to the failure of the whole system, so (assuming that failure probabilities are small, which is usually the case) probability of the failure of the whole system within a given interval can be approximated as a sum of failure probabilities of the components. With parallel components the situation is a bit more complicated: the whole system will fail if and only if after one of the components fails, the other component fails while the first component is being repaired; this is where MDT comes into play: the faster the first component is repaired, the less is the "vulnerability window" for the other component to fail.

Using similar logic, MDT for a system out of two serial components can be calculated as:&lt;ref name="auroraconsultingengineering" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{mdt}(c_1 ; c_2) = \frac{\text{mtbf}(c_1)\times \text{mdt}(c_2) + \text{mtbf}(c_2)\times \text{mdt}(c_1)}  {\text{mtbf}(c_1) + \text{mtbf}(c_2)}\;,&lt;/math&gt;
and for a system out of two parallel components MDT can be calculated as:&lt;ref name="auroraconsultingengineering" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{mdt}(c_1 \parallel c_2) = \frac{\text{mdt}(c_1)\times \text{mdt}(c_2)}  {\text{mdt}(c_1) + \text{mdt}(c_2)}\;.&lt;/math&gt;

Through successive application of these four formulae, the MTBF and MDT of any network of repairable components can be computed, provided that the MTBF and MDT is known for each component. In a special but all-important case of several serial components, MTBF calculation can be easily generalised into 
:&lt;math&gt;\text{mtbf}(c_1;\dots; c_n) = \left(\sum_{k=1}^n \frac 1{\text{mtbf}(c_k)}\right)^{-1}\;,&lt;/math&gt;
which can be shown by induction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ca/summers/Business/MTBFAllocAnalysis1.html|title=MTBF Allocations Analysis1|website=www.angelfire.com|access-date=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and likewise
:&lt;math&gt;\text{mdt}(c_1\parallel\dots\parallel c_n) = \left(\sum_{k=1}^n \frac 1{\text{mdt}(c_k)}\right)^{-1}\;,&lt;/math&gt;
since the formula for the mdt of two components in parallel is identical to that of the mtbf for two components in series.

== Variations of MTBF ==
There are many variations of MTBF, such as ''mean time between system aborts'' (MTBSA), ''mean time between critical failures'' (MTBCF) or ''mean time between unscheduled removal'' (MTBUR). Such nomenclature is used when it is desirable to differentiate among types of failures, such as critical and non-critical failures. For example, in an automobile, the failure of the FM radio does not prevent the primary operation of the vehicle.

It is recommended to use ''Mean time to failure'' (MTTF) instead of MTBF in cases where a system is replaced after a failure ("non-repairable system"), since MTBF denotes time between failures in a system which can be repaired.&lt;ref name="lienig" /&gt; 

MTTFd is an extension of MTTF, where MTTFd is only concerned about failures which would result in a dangerous condition. It can be calculated as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\text{MTTF} &amp; \approx \frac{B_{10}}{0.1n_\text{onm}}, \\[8pt]
\text{MTTFd} &amp; \approx \frac{B_{10d}}{0.1n_\text{op}},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''B''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of operations that a device will operate prior to 10% of a sample of those devices would fail and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;op&lt;/sub&gt; is number of operations. ''B''&lt;sub&gt;10d&lt;/sub&gt; is the same calculation, but where 10% of the sample would fail to danger. ''n''&lt;sub&gt;op&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of operations/cycles in one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B10d Assessment – Reliability Parameter for Electro-Mechanical Components|url=https://www.tuv.com/media/hungary/downloads_hu/B10d_EN.pdf|publisher=TUVRheinland|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kiev National Opera.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Taras Shevchenko]] Ukrainian National Opera House in Kyiv.]]
The '''Kyiv Opera''' group was formally established in the summer of 1867, and is the third oldest in Ukraine, after [[Odessa Opera]] and [[Lviv Opera]]. Today, the Kyiv Opera Company performs at the National Opera House of Ukraine named after [[Taras Shevchenko]] in [[Kyiv]].

==History==

===Early History: 1867 - 20th century===
Established in the summer of 1867 by [[Ferdinand Berger]] (? - 1875). Berger succeeded in inviting many talented singers, musicians, and conductors, and the city council (duma) had offered the newly created trouppe to use the City Theatre (constructed in 1856, architect I. Shtrom) for their performances. Officially, the theatre was named the City Theatre but was most commonly referred to as the Russian Opera. The day of the first performance, November 8 (October 27 old style), 1867 was made a city holiday. The performance of the opera ''[[Askold's Tomb]]'' by [[Alexey Verstovsky]] was the troupe's debut. The initial success is attributed to the vocal talents of that time of O. Satagano-Gorchakova, F. L'vov, M. Agramov but also to the captivating plot taken from some principal pages of the ancient history of the city.

Early performances were mostly Russian operas, including ''Ruslan and Ludmila'' by [[Mikhail Glinka]], ''[[Rusalka (Dargomyzhsky)|Rusalka]]'' by [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]], ''Maccabees'' by [[Anton Rubinstein]] and ''The Power of the Fiend'' by [[Alexander Serov|A. Serov]], as well as translated European operas including ''The Barber of Seville'' by [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]], ''The Marriage of Figaro'' by [[Mozart]], ''Der Freischütz'' by [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' by [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], and operas by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], which became the favorite of the Kievites.

On February 4, 1896, after a morning performance of ''Eugene Onegin'' by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], a fire erupted from an unextinguished candle in the theatre. The fire consumed the whole building within several hours. One of the largest musical libraries in Europe along with numerous costumes and stage props of many performances were lost during the fire. After the fire of the City Theatre, the troupe performed on other stages for several years, including Bergonie's Theatre (now the National Theatre of Russian Drama named after [[Lesya Ukrainka]]), Solovtsov's Theatre (now the National Theatre named after [[Ivan Franko]]) and even on the arena of the famous Krutikov's Circus.

===Early 20th century===
After the fire, the City Council had announced the international competition to design a new building for the Opera Theatre in Kyiv. The winning proposal was by [[Victor Schröter]]. The exterior was designed in Neo-Renaissance style and had accounted for the needs of the actors and the spectators. The interior was redesigned in a classical style and called ''Viennese Modern''. However, his greatest achievement is considered to be the stage - one of the largest in Europe designed to the latest engineering standards.

[[Image:Kyiv-teatr.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Kyiv City Theatre in the early 1900s.]]
[[File:500 000 karbovanets 1994 back.jpg|thumb|Opera depicted on Ukraine's [[Karbovanets#Third karbovanets|interim bank note]] in 1990s.]]

On {{OldStyleDate|September 29|1901|September 16}}, the solemn opening of the new premise of the theatre took place with a performance of cantata Kyiv by composer Wilhelm Hartweld (1859 - 1927) and a presentation of the opera ''Life for the Tsar'' by M. Glinka.

On {{OldStyleDate|14 September|1911|1 September}}, there was a performance of [[Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s [[The Tale of Tsar Saltan (Rimsky-Korsakov)|''The Tale of Tsar Saltan'']] at the [[Kiev Opera House]] in the presence of the Tsar and his two oldest daughters, the Grand Duchesses [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia|Olga]] and [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|Tatiana]]. The theater was occupied by 90 men posted as interior guards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexanderpalace.org/palace/stolypin-murder-1911-kiev.html]&lt;/ref&gt; During the intermission of a performance [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] [[Pyotr Stolypin]] was killed.
According to [[Alexander Spiridovich]], after the second act "Stolypin was standing in front of the ramp separating the parterre from the orchestra, his back to the stage. On his right were [[Vladimir Freedericksz|Baron Freedericks]] and [[Vladimir Sukhomlinov|Gen. Suhkomlinov]]." His personal body guard had gone to smoke. Stolypin was shot twice, once in the arm and once in the chest by [[Dmitry Bogrov]], a leftist revolutionary, trying to [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitate]] himself. Bogrov ran to one of the entries and was subsequently caught. &lt;!--Stolypin was reported to have coolly risen from his chair, removed his gloves and unbuttoned his jacket, exposing a blood-soaked waistcoat.&lt;ref&gt;O. Figes (1996) A People's Tragedy. The Russian Revolution 1891-1924, p. 22?&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; "He [Stolypin] turned toward the Imperial Box, then seeing the Tsar who had entered the box, he made a gesture with both hands to tell the Tsar to go back." The orchestra began to play "God Save the Tsar." The doctors hoped Stolypin would recover, but, despite never losing consciousness, his condition deteriorated. The next day&lt;!--after the shooting, or after his death?--&gt;, the distressed Tsar knelt at Stolypin's hospital bedside and kept repeating the words "Forgive me". Stolypin died three days later.

In the first decade of the 20th century, the Kyiv Opera Theatre attracted the most outstanding Ukrainian and Russian singers, including O. Petlyash, P. Tsecevich, K. Voronets, M. Medvedev, K. Brun, O. Mosin and O. Kamionsky and famous opera stars from the West often came on tours. Several unusual for the time performances took place on the stage: ''Die Walkure'' by [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], ''Sadko'' by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] and ''Mefistofele'' by [[Arrigo Boito]].

As Kyiv began to grow and with the conclusion of [[World War I]], the Kyiv Opera occupied a special place in the [[USSR]] and the world. The Kyiv Opera Theatre was considered to be one of the most prestigious in Ukraine and Russia. [[Kurt Adler]] was First Conductor from 1933-1935.

{{ancient Roman religion}}
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], the '''October Horse''' ([[Latin]] '''''Equus October''''') was an [[animal sacrifice]] to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] carried out on October 15, coinciding with the end of the [[Roman agriculture|agricultural]] and [[military campaign]]ing season.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Scheid]], ''An Introduction to Roman Religion'', translated by Janet Lloyd (Indiana University Press, 2003), pp. 51–52 [https://books.google.com/books?id=D6Sluj3NQz0C&amp;pg=PA51 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The rite took place during one of three horse-racing [[Roman festivals|festivals]] held in honor of Mars, the others being the two [[Equirria]] on February 27 and March 14.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], "The Origin of the ''[[Ludi Saeculares]]''," in ''Studies in Roman Literature, Culture and Religion'' (Brill, 1956), p. 224 [https://books.google.com/books?id=U9UUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA224 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two-horse [[Chariot racing|chariot races]] (''[[Biga (chariot)|bigae]]'') were held in the [[Campus Martius]], the area of Rome named for Mars, after which the right-hand horse of the winning team was transfixed by a [[Mars (mythology)#The spear of Mars|spear]], then sacrificed. The horse's head ''(caput)'' and tail (''cauda'') were cut off and used separately in the two subsequent parts of the ceremonies: two neighborhoods staged a fight for the right to display the head, and the freshly bloodied ''cauda'' was carried to the [[Regia]] for sprinkling the [[Sacred fire of Vesta|sacred hearth of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert E.A. Palmer]], ''Studies of the Northern Campus Martius in Ancient Rome'' (American Philosophical Society, 1990), pp. 16, 33, 35, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient references to the ''Equus October'' are scattered over more than six centuries: the earliest is that of [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]] (3rd century BC), who linked the sacrifice to the [[Trojan Horse]] and the Romans' claim to [[Troy|Trojan]] descent, with the latest in the [[Calendar of Philocalus]] (354 AD), where it is noted as still occurring, even as Christianity was becoming the dominant religion of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. Most scholars see an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] influence on the early formation of the ceremonies.

The October Horse is the only instance of horse sacrifice in Roman religion;&lt;ref&gt;C. Bennett Pascal, "October Horse," ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 85 (1981), p. 263. Two vague references in [[Ovid]] and [[Propertius]] are usually taken to refer to the October Horse, unless they preserve otherwise unknown rites.&lt;/ref&gt; the Romans typically sacrificed animals that were a normal part of their diet. The unusual ritual of the October Horse has thus been analyzed at times in light of other [[Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] forms of [[horse sacrifice]], such as the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] ''[[ashvamedha]]'' and the [[Horse sacrifice#Irish|Irish ritual described by Giraldus Cambrensis]], both of which have to do with kingship. Although the ritual battle for possession of the head may preserve an element from the early period when [[Kingdom of Rome|Rome was ruled by kings]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Litchfield West|M.L. West]], ''Indo-European Poetry and Myth'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 428 [https://books.google.com/books?id=CdFf8c3V2DAC&amp;pg=PA418 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; the October Horse's collocation of agriculture and war is characteristic of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]]. The sacred topography of the rite and the role of Mars in other equestrian festivals also suggest aspects of [[initiation ritual|initiation]] and rebirth ritual. The complex or even contradictory aspects of the October Horse probably result from overlays of traditions accumulated over time.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," p. 287ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The rite of the October Horse took place on the [[Ides (calendar)|Ides]] of October, but no name is recorded for a festival on that date.&lt;ref name="Pascal-p261"&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philologist|grammarian]] [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] describes it as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The October Horse is named from the annual sacrifice to Mars in the Campus Martius during the month of October. It is the right-hand horse of the winning team in the two-horse chariot races. The customary competition for its head between the residents of the [[Suburra]] and those of the [[Sacra Via]] was no trivial affair; the latter would get to attach it to the wall of the Regia, or the former to the [[Turris Mamilia|Mamilian Tower]]. Its tail was transported to the Regia with sufficient speed that the blood from it could be dripped onto the hearth for the sake of becoming part of the sacred rite ''([[res divina]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Festus 190 (edition of Lindsay). [[Plutarch]]'s description of the rite (''Roman Questions'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/E.html#97 97]) concurs with that of Festus. See Frederick E. Brenk, "An Imperial Heritage: The Religious Spirit of Plutarch of Chaironeia," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.36.1 (1987), p. 340, on Plutarch's interpretational efforts.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a separate passage,&lt;ref&gt;Festus 246 (Lindsay).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] [[antiquarian]] [[Verrius Flaccus]] adds the detail that the horse's head is adorned with bread. The [[Chronography of 354|Calendar of Philocalus]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that on October 15 "the Horse takes place at the Nixae," either an altar to birth deities ''([[di nixi]])'' or less likely an obscure landmark called the [[Ciconiae Nixae]].&lt;ref name="Pascal-p261" /&gt; According to Roman tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Reported by the Greek historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Roman Antiquities'' 5.13.2: "This field their ancestors had by a public decree consecrated to Mars as a meadow for horses and the most suitable drill-field for the youth to perform their exercises in arms."&lt;/ref&gt; the Campus Martius had been consecrated to Mars by their ancestors as horse pasturage and an equestrian training ground for youths.

The "sacred rite" that the horse's blood became part of is usually taken to be the [[Parilia]], a festival of rural character on April 21, which became the date on which the [[founding of Rome]] was celebrated.

==War and agriculture==
Verrius Flaccus notes&lt;ref&gt;Preserved by [[Paul the Deacon|Paulus]] in the epitome of [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] 246 L, as cited by Hendrik Wagenvoort, "On the Magical Significance of the Tail," in ''Pietas: Selected Studies in Roman Religion'' (Brill, 1980), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; that the horse ritual was carried out ''ob frugum eventum'', usually taken to mean "in thanks for the completed harvest" or "for the sake of the next harvest",&lt;ref&gt;Wagenvoort, "On the Magical Significance of the Tail," pp. 147–148.&lt;/ref&gt; since [[winter wheat]] was sown in the fall.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," p. 267, as noted in Roman farmers' almanacs ''([[menologia rustica]])''.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has been connected to the divine personification [[Bonus Eventus]], "Good Outcome,"&lt;ref name="Pascal-p285"&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; who had a temple of unknown date in the Campus Martius&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; and whom [[Varro]] lists as one of the [[List of Roman deities#Varro, De re rustica|twelve agricultural deities]].&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''De re rustica'' 1.1.4–6. Later Eventus came to represent success in general.&lt;/ref&gt; But like other ceremonies in October, the sacrifice occurred during the time of the army's return and reintegration into society, for which Verrius also accounted by explaining that a horse is suited for war, an ox for tilling.&lt;ref&gt;"A horse was sacrificed rather than an ox, because it is suited for war as the ox is for tending crops" ''(et equus potius quam bos immolabatur, quod hic bello, bos frugibus pariendis est aptus)'', as quoted by Wagenvoort, "On the Magical Significance of the Tail," p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans did not use horses as [[draft horse|draft animals]] for farm work,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Drews]], ''The Coming of the Greeks: Indo-European Conquests in the Aegean and the Near East'' (Princeton University Press, 1988, 1989), p. 152, notes that "Roman farm horses, alas, are as imaginary as unicorns."&lt;/ref&gt; nor [[Chariot tactics|chariots in warfare]], but [[Polybius]] specifies that the victim is a [[war horse]].&lt;ref&gt;Polybius 12.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual was held outside the ''[[pomerium]]'', Rome's sacred boundary, presumably because of its martial character,&lt;ref&gt;Fred K. Drogula, "''Imperium, potestas'', and the ''pomerium'' in the Roman Republic," ''Historia'' 56 (2007), p. 436, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; but agriculture was also an extra-urban activity, as [[Vitruvius]] indicates when he notes that the correct sacred place for [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]] was outside the city ''(extra urbem loco)''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitruvius]], ''[[De architectura]]'' 1.7.2; Pascal, "October Horse," p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome's early history, the roles of soldier and farmer were complementary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In early Rome agriculture and military activity were closely bound up, in the sense that the Roman farmer was also a soldier. … In the case of the October Horse, for example, we should not be trying to decide whether it is a military, or an agricultural festival; but see it rather as one of the ways in which the convergence of farming and warfare (or more accurately of farmers and fighters) might be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], John North, and Simon Price, ''Religions of Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 47–48 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2rtaTFYuM3QC&amp;pg=PA47 online] and 53.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This [[wikt:polyvalence|polyvalence]] was characteristic of the god for whom the sacrifice was conducted, since among the Romans Mars brought war and bloodshed, agriculture and virility, and thus both death and fertility within his sphere of influence.&lt;ref&gt;Wagenvoort, "On the Magical Significance of the Tail," p. 148. Further discussion in a [[Dumézil]]ian context by Wouter W. Belier, ''Decayed Gods: Origin and Development of Georges Dumézil's 'Idéologie Tripartite','' (Brill, 1991), pp. 88–89 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hs3BpWur0_4C&amp;pg=PA88 online.] On Mars' virility, R.B. Onians, ''The Origins of European Thought about the Body, the Mind, the Soul, the World, Time and Fate'' (Cambridge University Press, 1951), pp. 470–471. Onians connects the name of Mars to the Latin ''mas, maris'', "male" (p. 178). In antiquity, ''vis'' ("force, power") was thought to be related etymologically to ''vita'', "life." Varro (''De lingua latina'' 5.64, quoting [[Gaius Lucilius|Lucilius]]) notes that ''vis'' is ''vita'': "''vis'' drives us to do everything."&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Parilia and ''suffimen''===
The [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan poets]] [[Propertius]]&lt;ref&gt;Propertius 4.1.20: ''qualia nunc curto lustra novantur equo''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ovid]] both mention horse as an ingredient in the ritual preparation ''suffimen'' or ''suffimentum'', which the [[Vestals]] compounded for use in the [[lustrum|lustration]] of shepherds and their sheep at the Parilia. Propertius may imply that this horse was not an original part of the preparation: "the purification rites ''([[Lustratio|lustra]])'' are ''now'' renewed by means of the dismembered horse".&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," pp. 262, 267, 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid specifies that the horse's blood was used for the ''suffimen''.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'' 4.732f.: ''sanguis equi'' (line 733).&lt;/ref&gt; While the blood from the tail was dripped or smeared on the sacred hearth of Rome in October, blood or ashes from the rest of the animal could have been processed and preserved for the ''suffimen'' as well.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," pp. 276ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Although no other horse sacrifice in Rome is recorded, [[Georges Dumézil]] and others have attempted to exclude the ''Equus October'' as the source of equine blood for the Parilia.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," pp. 266, 268. Robert Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 2001; originally published in French 1998), pp. 69 and 79, also asserts that this was not the blood of the October Horse, as do some other scholars.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important ingredient for the ''suffimen'' was the ash produced from the [[holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust]] of an unborn calf at the [[Fordicidia]] on April 15, along with the stalks from which beans had been harvested.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'' 4.731–734; Daniel P. Harmon, "Religion in the Latin Elegists", ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' 2.16.3 (1986), p. 1958; [[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; One source, from [[late antiquity]] and not always reliable, notes that beans were sacred to Mars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ioannes Lydus]], ''De mensibus'' 4.42, as noted by Pascal, "October Horse," pp. 284–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Suffimentum'' is a general word for a preparation used for healing, purification, or warding off ill influence. In his treatise on veterinary medicine, [[Vegetius]] recommends a ''suffimentum'' as an effective cure for draft animals and for humans prone to emotional outbursts, as well as for driving off hailstorms, demons and ghosts ''(daemones'' and ''umbras)''.&lt;ref&gt;Vegetius, ''Ars Mulomedicina'' 3.12.4 (see also 1.20.3); J.N. Adams, ''Pelagonius and Latin Veterinary Terminology in the Roman Empire'' (Brill, 1995), p. 186. [[Pelagonius]] also uses the word.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The victim==
[[File:Cosa Mars horse 590003.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Coin with Mars and a bridled horse ([[Cosa]], Etruria, 273-250 BC)]]
[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|Sacrificial victims]] were most often domestic animals normally part of the Roman diet, and the meat was eaten at a banquet shared by those celebrating the rite.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Belayche, "Religious Actors in Daily Life: Practices and Related Beliefs," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 283; Pascal, "October Horse," pp. 268, 277.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horse meat]] was distasteful to the Romans, and [[Tacitus]] classes horses among "[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#profanum|profane]]" animals.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' 4.60 and ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' 2.24; Pascal, "October Horse," p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Inedible victims such as the October Horse and dogs were typically offered to [[chthonic]] deities in the form of a [[holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust]], resulting in no shared meal.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," p. 277; [[John Scheid]], "Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 267–268.&lt;/ref&gt; In Greece dog sacrifices were made to Mars' [[interpretatio graeca|counterpart]] [[Ares]] and the related war god [[Enyalios]]. At Rome, dogs were sacrificed at the [[Robigalia]], a festival for protecting the crops at which chariot races were held for Mars along with the namesake deity,&lt;ref&gt;Robigus (masculine) or Robigo (feminine), who may be an "indigitation" of Mars, or originally an epithet or divine name to "fix" the desired action of warding off crop disease; [[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; and at a very few other public rites.&lt;ref&gt;A dog was sacrificed at the [[Lupercalia]], an exceedingly complex festival. On the collocation of wolves (''lupus'' in Latin, one of Mars' primary sacred animals) and bands of male youth enacting violent fertility rituals, see [[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 80ff., particularly p. 85 on the interpretation of the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#Luperci|luperci]]'' as "an initiatory rite in which adolescents had to live wild, like wolves, before returning and being accepted as fully adult members of the community"; the goat, however, had become the most important animal of the festival in historical times.&lt;/ref&gt; Birth deities, however, also received offerings of puppies or bitches, and infant cemeteries show a high concentration of puppies, sometimes ritually dismembered.&lt;ref&gt;David and Noelle Soren, "Hecate and the Infant Cemetery at Poggio Gramignano," in ''A Roman Villa and a Late Roman Infant Cemetery'' («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 1999), p. 619–632, on the archaeology in relation to magical practices. Dog sacrifice was offered to the obscure Roman birth deity [[Mana Genita]], whose name suggests a link to the spirits of the dead called the [[Manes]]. Mana Genita is perhaps to be identified with the Genitalis invoked by [[Horace]] in his [[Carmen Saeculare|choral ode composed for the Saecular Games]] in 17 BC, and the Greek counterpart may be ''Genetyllis'',  Σ [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 1.1.5. See also Socrates of Argos, ''[[FGrH]]'' 310 F 4 ''apud'' Plutarch, ''Roman Questions'' 52.277B, on an [[Argive]] deity Eilioneia (= [[Eileithyia]]?). Discussed by [[Robert Parker (historian)|Robert Parker]], ''On Greek Religion'' (Cornell University Press, 2011), pp. 158–159. Puppies were regular offerings in rites characterized as "[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]]," that is, rituals undertaken on the initiative of an individual, sometimes secretly, that were not a part of public cult nor the private cult of one's ''[[gens]]'' (the ''[[sacra gentilicia]])'', household, or self celebrated regularly by all Romans.&lt;/ref&gt; Inedible victims were offered to a restricted group of deities mainly involved with the cycle of birth and death, but the reasoning is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hecate]], for instance, was a regular recipient of dog sacrifice, as a chthonic and a birth goddess, or invoked for magic; Parker, ''On Greek Religion'', pp. 158–159, citing also R. Gordon, ''Revista de historiographia'' 5.3 [2/2006], pp. 4–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of the horse to the war god is likewise not self-evident, since the Roman military was based on infantry. Mars' youthful armed priests the [[Salii]], attired as "typical representatives of the archaic infantry," performed their rituals emphatically on foot, with dance steps.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnaldo Momigliano]], "''Procum Patricium''," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 56 (1966), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[equestrian order]] was of [[Social class in ancient Rome|lesser social standing]] than the senatorial ''patres'', "fathers", who were originally the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] only.&lt;ref&gt;Momigliano, "''Procum Patricium''," pp. 16–24, points out that the ''equestres'', or "knights," were of lesser rank than the [[Roman senate|senators]], and that the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] cannot have originated as a mounted aristocracy: "Of course we are all used to visualizing our aristocrats as superior beings on horseback. This is the heritage from our Middle Ages. But the question is whether this mediaeval picture can be transferred to the Rome of the kings" (p. 16). The earliest Roman cavalry were supported by the state; their horses and the food for them were state-subsidized, and therefore horse-ownership and maintenance cannot be considered a sign of wealth in Rome to the extent that it was in Greece (p. 20). Momigliano argues that the cavalry were originally the bodyguard of the king: "When these landowners ('patres') got rid of the kings, they transformed themselves into the hereditary exclusive holders of the key positions of the State. As such they had to deal with the old equestrian bodyguard of the kings. By proper infusion of new blood, of new religious ideas and ceremonies, they subjected the cavalry to their control and made it a preserve of the rich. Their main preoccupation remained, however, the control of the infantry. … This of course does not exclude the employment of young members of the aristocracy in a cavalry paid by the state" (p. 23).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Magister equitum]]'', "Master of the Horse," was subordinate to the ''[[Roman dictator|Dictator]]'', who was forbidden the use of the horse except through special legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," citing Livy 23.14.2 and Plutarch, ''Fabius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Fabius_Maximus*.html#4 4.]&lt;/ref&gt; By the late Republic, the Roman cavalry was formed primarily from allies ''([[auxilia]])'', and [[Arrian]] emphasizes the foreign origin of cavalry training techniques, particularly among the [[Continental Celts|Celts]] of [[Gaul]] and [[Roman Spain|Spain]]. Roman technical terms pertaining to horsemanship and horse-drawn vehicles are mostly not Latin in origin, and often from [[Gaulish]].&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," p. 275; Joshua Whatmough, ''The Foundations of Roman Italy'' (London: Methuen, 1937), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under some circumstances, Roman religion placed the horse under an explicit ban. Horses were forbidden in the grove of [[Diana Nemorensis]], and the patrician [[Flamen Dialis]] was religiously prohibited from riding a horse.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," pp. 272, 275, 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Mars, however, was associated with horses at his [[Equirria]] festivals and the equestrian [[Lusus Troiae|"Troy Game"]], which was one of the events [[Augustus]] staged for the dedication of the [[Mars (mythology)#Temples and topography|Temple of Mars Ultor]] in 2 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen M. Coleman, "Euergetism in Its Place: Where Was the Amphitheatre in Augustan Rome?" in ''Bread and Circuses: Euergetism and Municipal Patronage in Roman Italy'' (Routledge, 2003), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horse sacrifice was regularly offered by peoples the Romans classified as "[[barbarian]]s," such as [[Scythians]],&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," pp. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; but also at times by Greeks. In [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], "horses in armor" were sacrificed as a lustration for the army.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/23*.html#10.17 23.10.17.]&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after describing the October Horse, Festus gives three other examples: the [[Laconia|Spartans]] sacrifice a horse "to [[Anemoi|the winds]]" on [[Taygetus|Mount Taygetus]];&lt;ref&gt;Noted also by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 2.34.2.&lt;/ref&gt; among the Sallentini,&lt;ref&gt;An uncertain ethnonym, perhaps the [[Messapii]], who were famed as horse breeders ([[Vergil]] calls their mythological progenitor [[Messapus]] ''equum domitor'', "tamer of horses," at ''[[Aeneid]]'' 7.691); see Pallottino, "Myths and Cults of the Ancient Veneti," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'', p. 50, and L.R. Palmer, ''The Latin Language'' (Oklahoma University Press, 1988, originally published 1954), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; horses were burnt alive for an obscure [[Jove]] Menzana;&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps related to ''mannus'', "pony," a [[loanword]] from [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]]; Francisco Marcos-Marin, "Etymology and Semantics: Theoretical Considerations apropos of an Analysis of the Etymological Problem of Spanish ''mañero, mañeria''," in ''Historical Semantics—Historical Word-Formation'' (de Gruyter, 1985), p. 381. Festus records a sacrifice made every eight years by the [[Illyrians]], who throw four horses into the sea; Parker, ''On Greek Religion'', p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; and every year the [[Rhodians]] dedicated a four-horse chariot ''([[quadriga]])'' to the Sun and cast it into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;See the free-ranging examples of religious horsemanship collected by John Pairman Brown, ''Israel and Hellas'', (de Gruyter, 2000), vol. 2, pp. 5–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''quadriga'' traditionally represented the sun, as the ''biga'' did the moon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isidore of Seville]], ''[[Etymologies]]'' 18.26. The three-horse chariot (''triga'', for which the equestrian exercise field called the [[Trigarium]] was named) was sacred to the chthonic gods ''([[di inferi]])'', because it represented the full span of life, childhood ''(infantia)'', the prime of life ''(iuventus)'', and old age ''(senectas)''. The earliest Roman coins picturing a ''biga'' showed it driven by Luna, the moon goddess.&lt;/ref&gt; A Persian horse-sacrifice to "[[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]] clothed in rays of light"&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'' 1.385.&lt;/ref&gt; was noted by Ovid and Greek sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Cyropaedia]]'' 8.3.24 and ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 4.5.34–5; [[Philostratus]], ''VA'' 1.21; Pausanias 3.20.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to cultures that offered a horse to the war god in advance to ask for success, the Roman horse sacrifice marked the close of the military campaigning season.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur M. Eckstein, ''Mediterranean Anarchy, Interstate War, and the Rise of Rome'' (University of California Press, 2006), pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Romans, horse- and chariot-races were characteristic of "old and obscure" religious observances such as the [[Consualia]] that at times propitiated chthonic deities. The horse races at the shadowy [[Taurian Games]] in honor of the underworld gods ''([[di inferi]])'' were held in the Campus Martius as were Mars' Equirria.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses,'' pp. 544, 558; Auguste Bouché-Leclercq, ''Manuel des Institutions Romaines'' (Hachette, 1886), p. 549; "Purificazione," in ''Thesaurus Cultus et Rituum Antiquorum'' (''[[Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae|LIMC]]'', 2004), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The horse had been established as a funerary animal among the Greeks and Etruscans by the Archaic period.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses: Arenas for Chariot Racing'' (University of California Press, 1986), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hendrik Wagenvoort]] even speculated about an archaic form of Mars who "had been imagined as the god of death and the underworld in the shape of a horse."&lt;ref&gt;Wagenvoort, "The Origin of the Ludi Saeculares," p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The chariot===
The two-horse [[chariot race]]s ''([[biga (chariot)|bigae]])'' that preceded the October Horse sacrifice determined the selection of the optimal victim. In a dual yoke, the right-hand horse was the lead or strongest animal, and thus the one from the winning chariot was chosen as the most potent offering for Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chariots have a rich symbolism in Roman culture, but the Romans never used chariots in war, though they faced enemies who did.&lt;ref&gt;Such as [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithradates of Pontus]]; ''Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare,'' p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; The chariot was part of Roman military culture primarily as the vehicle of the [[Roman triumph|triumphing general]], who rode in an ornamented four-horse car markedly impractical for actual war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], ''The Roman Triumph'' (Harvard University Press, 2007), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Roman racing practices were of Etruscan origin,&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; part of the Etruscan tradition of public games ''([[ludi]])'' and [[pompa circensis|equestrian processions]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank Bernstein, "Complex Rituals: Games and Processions in Republican Rome," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 223–224.&lt;/ref&gt; Chariot racing was imported from [[Magna Graecia]] no earlier than the 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

Images of chariot races were considered good luck, but the races themselves were magnets for [[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]] in attempts to influence the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Eva D'Ambra, "Racing with Death: Circus Sarcophagi and the Commemoration of Children in Roman Italy" in ''Constructions of Childhood in Ancient Greece and Italy'' (American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 2007), pp. 349–351; Nicole Belayche, "Religious Actors in Daily Life: Practices and Related Beliefs," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; One law from the [[Theodosian Code]] prohibits charioteers from using magic to win, on pain of death.&lt;ref&gt;Belayche, "Religious Actors," p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ornaments placed on horses were good-luck charms or devices to ward off malevolence, including bells, wolves' teeth, crescents, and [[Livestock branding|brands]].&lt;ref&gt;D'Ambra, "Racing with Death," p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; This counter-magic was directed at actual practices; binding spells ''([[curse tablet|defixiones]])'' have been found at race tracks.&lt;ref&gt;D'Ambra, "Racing with Death," pp. 348–349; Belayche, "Religious Actors," p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''defixio'' sometimes employed the spirits of the prematurely dead to work harm.&lt;ref&gt;D'Ambra, "Racing with Death," p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt; On [[hippodrome|Greek racetracks]], the turning posts were heroes' tombs or altars for propitiating [[Taraxippus|malevolent spirits]] who might cause harm to the men or horses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Nagy]], ''Greek Mythology and Poetics'' (Cornell University Press, 1990), pp. 219–220.&lt;/ref&gt;  The design of the turning posts ''(metae)'' on a Roman race course was derived from Etruscan funerary monuments.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses'', p. 15. One of the few specifics recorded about the horse races of the [[Taurian Games]], held like the races of the October Horse in the Campus Martius, is that they were run around ''metae'' in honor of the underworld gods ''([[di inferi]])''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maria Saal Achill erschlaegt Hektor 27052008 89.jpg|thumb|Imperial Roman funerary relief showing a spear-bearing Achilles in a [[Biga (chariot)#Mythological and ceremonial use|lunate ''biga'']], dragging the body of Hector, with a winged figure above]]
[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] attributes the invention of the two-horse chariot to the "[[Phrygians]]",&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 7.201.&lt;/ref&gt; an ethnic designation that the Romans came to regard as synonymous with "Trojan."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Brian Rose, "The Parthians in Augustan Rome," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 109.1 (2005), p. 34; E. Hall, "When Did the Trojans Turn into Phrygians?" ''Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik'' 73 (1988) 15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Greek narrative tradition, chariots played a role in [[Homeric epics|Homeric]] warfare, reflecting their importance among the historical [[Mycenaeans]]. By the time the Homeric epics were composed, however, fighting from chariot was no longer a part of Greek warfare, and the ''[[Iliad]]'' has warriors taking chariots as transportation to the battlefield, then fighting on foot.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare: Greece, the Hellenistic World, and the Rise of Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), vol. 1, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Chariot racing was a part of funeral games quite early, as the first reference to a chariot race in [[Western literature]] is as an event in the funeral games held for [[Patroclus]] in the ''Iliad''.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous scene from the ''Iliad'' involving a chariot is [[Achilles]] dragging the body of [[Hector]], the Trojan heir to the throne, three times around the tomb of Patroclus; in the version of the ''Aeneid'', it is the city walls that are circled. Variations of the scene occur throughout Roman funerary art.&lt;ref&gt;Nagy, ''Greek Mythology and Poetics'', pp. 219–220.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gregory Nagy]] sees horses and chariots, and particularly the chariot of Achilles, as embodying the concept of ''ménos'', which he defines as "conscious life, power, consciousness, awareness," associated in the Homeric epics with ''[[thumos|thūmós]],'' "spiritedness," and ''{{lang|grc|[[wikt:ψυχή|psychē]]}}'', "soul," all of which depart the body in death.&lt;ref&gt;Nagy, ''Greek Mythology and Poetics'', pp 87–89. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The gods endow both heroes and horses with ''ménos'' through breathing into them, so that "warriors eager for battle are literally 'snorting with ''ménos''.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Ménea pneiontes'' (μένεα πνείοντες): ''Iliad'' 2.536, 3.8, 11.508, 24.364; ''[[Odyssey]]'' 22.203, as cited and discussed by Nagy, ''Greek Mythology and Poetics'', pp. 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[metaphor]] at ''Iliad'' 5.296 compares a man falling in battle to horses collapsing when they are unharnessed after exertions.&lt;ref&gt;Nagy, ''Greek Mythology and Poetics'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Cremation frees the ''psychē'' from both ''thūmós'' and ''ménos'' so that it may pass into the afterlife;&lt;ref&gt;Nagy, ''Greek Mythology and Poetics'', pp. 89, 116.&lt;/ref&gt; the horse, which embodies ''ménos'', races off and leaves the chariot behind, as in the [[Chariot Allegory|philosophical allegory of the chariot]] from [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;Nagy, ''Greek Mythology and Poetics'', p. 88, citing also Jan Bremmer.&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropological term ''[[mana]]'' has sometimes been borrowed to conceptualize the October Horse's potency,&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Versnel, ''Triumphus: An Inquiry into the Origin, Development and Meaning of the Roman Triumph'' (Brill, 1970), p. 157; Pascal, "October Horse," pp. 276–277 for additional examples.&lt;/ref&gt; also expressed in modern scholarship as ''[[numen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," pp. 276–280.&lt;/ref&gt; The physical exertions of the hard-breathing horse in its contest are thought to intensify or concentrate this ''mana'' or ''numen''.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.J. Rose]], "A Suggested Explanation of Ritual Combats," ''Folklore'' (1925) 322–331, noted but considered "stretching a point" by Pascal, "October Horse," p. 280, though on p. 282 Pascal seems to think the hypothetical courier who takes the tail to the Regia enhances the tail's numinous power through his efforts.&lt;/ref&gt;

In honoring the god who presided over the [[Roman census]], which among other functions registered the eligibility of young men for military service, the festivals of Mars have a strongly [[lustrum|lustral]] character. A lustration was performed in the Campus Martius following the census. Although lustral ceremonies are not recorded as occurring before the chariot races of the Equirria or the October Horse, it is plausible that they were, and that they were seen as a test or assurance of the lustration's efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent J. Rosivach, "Mars, the Lustral God," ''Latomus'' 42.3 (1983), pp. 511 and 514, citing Wissowa on the likely lustral character of the races; Katja Moede, "Reliefs, Public and Private," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The head===
[[File:Procession Salian knight Altemps Inv8612.jpg|thumb|Funerary relief depicting the deceased riding a horse and pointing to his head where the ''[[Genius (mythology)|Genius]]'' resides (2nd century AD)]]
The significance of the October Horse's head as a powerful trophy may be illuminated by the ''caput acris equi'', "head of a spirited ('sharp') horse," which [[Vergil]] says was uncovered by [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] and her colonists when they began the [[Earthworks (engineering)|dig]] to found [[Carthage]]: "by this sign it was shown that the race ''([[gens]])'' would be distinguished in war and abound with the means of life."&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 1.444–445: ''Sic nam fore bello / egregiam et facilem victu per saecula gentem''; R.B. Onians, ''The Origins of European Thought about the Body, the Mind, the Soul, the World, Time and Fate'' (Cambridge University Press, 1951, 2000 reprint), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th-century agricultural writer [[Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius|Palladius]] advised farmers to place the skull of a horse or ass on their land; the animals were not to be "virgin," because the purpose was to promote fertility. The practice may be related to the effigies known as ''[[oscilla]]'', figures or faces&lt;ref&gt;Onians, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; that Vergil says were hung from pine trees by mask-wearing [[Ausones|Ausonian]] farmers of Trojan descent&lt;ref&gt;Vergil, ''Georgics'' 2.385–389; Christopher Nappa, ''Reading after Actium: Vergil's Georgics, Octavian, and Rome'' (University of Michigan, 2005), pp. 93–94. The Ausones made invocations ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#carmen|carmina]])'' to [[Bacchus]].&lt;/ref&gt; when they were sowing seed.&lt;ref&gt;The detail that they were planting seed is a note from the Vergil commentator traditionally identified as [[Marcus Valerius Probus|Probus]]; Onians, ''The Origins of European Thought'', p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of sexual vitality or fertility in the horse's head suggests its [[talisman]]ic potency.&lt;ref&gt;Onians, ''The Origin of European Thought'', p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; The substance ''[[hippomanes]]'', which was thought to induce sexual passion, was supposedly exuded from the forehead of a foal; [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] (''ca.'' 175–235 AD) says either the forehead or "loins."&lt;ref&gt;Onians, ''The Origin of European Thought'', p. 245, pointing out also Pliny's bizarre passage on ''hippomanes'' (''Natural History'' 28.44 (= 181) involving equine sex and magic.&lt;/ref&gt; Called ''amor'' by Vergil,&lt;ref&gt;''Quaeritur et nascentis equi de fronte revulsus / et matri praereptus amor'': ''Aeneid'' 4.515–516.&lt;/ref&gt; it is an ingredient in Dido's ritual preparations before her suicide in the ''[[Aeneid]]''.

On Roman funerary reliefs, the deceased is often depicted riding on a horse for his journey to the afterlife,&lt;ref&gt;These depictions are perhaps to be distinguished from Roman cavalrymen shown mounted and in their armor as mere representations of their occupation, as was common in funerary art. Even with an explicitly military subject, however, the image can have allegorical elements. A horseman spearing down an opponent may suggest his soul's ability to rise above death, just as he achieved victories in life. See Graham Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army of the First and Second Centuries A.D.'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1985, 1998, 3rd edition), p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes pointing to his head. This gesture signifies the ''[[Genius (mythology)|Genius]]'', the divine embodiment of the vital principle found in each individual conceived of as residing in the head, in some ways comparable to the Homeric ''thumos'' or the Latin ''numen''.&lt;ref&gt;Onians, ''The Origins of European Thought.'' pp. 126–128 ''et passim;'' Robert Schilling, "Genius," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'', p. 127; [[Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 3.607: "the forehead is [consecrated to] the Genius, hence we touch our forehead as we venerate the god"  ''(frontem genio, unde venerantes deum tangimus frontem).''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bread pendants====
Pendants of bread were attached to the head of the ''Equus October:'' a portion of the inedible sacrifice was retained for humans and garnished with an everyday food associated with Ceres and [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]]. The shape of the "breads" is not recorded. Equines decorated with bread are found also on the [[Vestalia|Feast of Vesta]] on June 9, when the asses who normally worked in the [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|milling and baking industry]] were dressed with garlands from which decorative loaves dangled.&lt;ref&gt;[[Propertius]] 4.1.21; Ovid, ''Fasti'' 6.311; Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome'', p. 74; Onians, ''The Origins of European Thought'', pp. 227, 471; Sarolta A.

Joy Littlewood, ''A Commentary on Ovid's'' Fasti'', Book 6'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. lviii–lx; 100, 104. Horses and asses were also garlanded, though not with bread, at the Consualia on August 21; H.H. Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ovid]], the ass was honored at the Vestalia as a reward for its service to the [[List of Roman deities#Mater and Pater|Virgin Mother]], who is portrayed in [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Augustan ideology]] as simultaneously native and Trojan.&lt;ref&gt;Geradine Herbert-Brown, "''Fasti:'' the Poet, the Prince, and the Plebs," in ''A Companion to Ovid'' (Blackwell, 2009), p. 133; Carole E. Newlands, ''Playing with Time: Ovid and the Fasti'' (Cornell University Press, 1995), p. 130ff.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[ithyphallic]] god [[Priapus]], an imported deity who was never the recipient of public cult,&lt;ref&gt;[[Elaine Fantham]], "Sexual Comedy in Ovid's ''Fasti'': Sources and Motivation," in ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 87 (1983), pp. 189, 201–207, and especially p. 202: "Priapus is an outsider to Roman public ritual with no place in any official fertility ceremonies." Priapus was a guardian of gardens, but the gardens he guards are not usually portrayed as lush. His perpetual erection results from sexual frustration, not potency; unlike satyrs, who are often but not always unsuccessful, Priapus never achieves sexual release, and thus lacks true generative power: Olender, "Priapus," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'', pp. 140–142.&lt;/ref&gt; was about to rape Vesta as she slept, the braying ass woke her. In revenge, Priapus thereafter demanded the ass as a customary sacrifice to him.&lt;ref&gt;Customary at [[Lampsacus]], where his cult originated; Steven J. Green, ''Ovid,'' Fasti ''1: A Commentary'' (Brill, 2004), pp. 184–185. He also received offerings of "junk" fish ([[Palatine Anthology]], 6.192), and imperfect or artificial fruit; [[Maurice Olender]], "Priapus," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 140. A wall painting at Pompeii shows the nocturnal offering of a pig to Priapus: Anthony King, "Mammals," in ''The Natural History of Pompeii'' (Cambridge University Press, 2002), p. 444; John R. Clarke, ''The Houses of Roman Italy, 100 B.C.–A.D. 250: Ritual, Space and Decoration'' (University of California Press, 1991), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[early Christian]] writer [[Lactantius]] says that the garland of bread pendants commemorates the preservation of Vesta's sexual integrity ''([[pudicitia]]).''&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''Divine Institutes'' 1.24.&lt;/ref&gt; Aelian recounts a myth in which the ass misplaces a ''[[pharmakos|pharmakon]]'' entrusted to him by the king of the gods, thereby causing humanity to lose its eternal youth.&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''De natura animalium'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Aelian/de_Natura_Animalium/6*.html#51 6.51 (in a Latin translation] of the original Greek; Maurice Olender, "Priapus," p.141.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amber horse Met 24.97.117.jpg|thumb|left|Horse head pendant in [[amber]] ''([[Italic peoples|Italic]], 5th century BC)]]
The symbolism of bread for the October Horse is unstated in the ancient sources. Robert Turcan has seen the garland of loaves as a way to thank Mars for protecting the harvest.&lt;ref name="Turcan-p79"&gt;Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Mars was linked to Vesta, the Regia, and the production of grain through several religious observances.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," p. 283 ''et passim,'' and Herbert-Brown, "''Fasti:'' the Poet, the Prince, and the Plebs," pp. 134–138, on Mars' relation to Vesta generally.&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Fasti (poem)|poem on the calendar]], Ovid thematically connects bread and war throughout the month of June (''[[Junius (month)|Iunius]]'', a name for which Ovid offers multiple derivations including [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and "youths", ''iuniores'').&lt;ref&gt;Littlewood, ''A Commentary on Ovid's'' Fasti'', Book 6,'' pp. lviii–lx.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately following the story of Vesta, Priapus, and the ass, Ovid associates Vesta, Mars, and bread in recounting the [[Battle of the Allia|Gallic siege of Rome]]. The [[Gauls]] were camped in the Field of Mars, and the Romans had taken to their last retreat, the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitoline]] [[Arx (Roman)|citadel]]. At an emergency council of the gods, Mars objects to the removal of the sacred talismans of Trojan Vesta which [[pignora imperii|guarantee the safety of the state]],&lt;ref&gt;''Iliacae transferri pignora Vestae'', in reference to the [[Palladium (mythology)|Palladium]] and [[Penates]] brought to Italy by the Trojan refugee Aeneas; one tradition had the Vestals withdrawing from the city during the siege. In the dual founding myth of Rome, Mars fathered [[Romulus and Remus]] with a priestess of Vesta, and [[Mars (mythology)#Sacred animals|his animals the wolf and the woodpecker]] nourished the twins. See Ariadne Staples, ''From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion'' (Routledge, 1998), pp. 63–64, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; and is indignant that the Romans, destined to rule the world, are starving. Vesta causes flour to materialize, and the process of breadmaking occurs miraculously during the night, resulting in an abundance ''([[ops]])'' of the gifts of Ceres. Jupiter wakes the sleeping generals and delivers an oracular message: they are to throw that which they least want to surrender from [[arx (Roman)|the citadel]] onto the enemy. Puzzled at first, as is conventional in receiving an oracle, the Romans then throw down the loaves of bread as weapons against the shields and helmets of the Gauls, causing the enemy to despair of starving Rome into submission.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'' 6.355–386 (see also Livy, 5.84.4). Ovid is providing an ''[[aition]]'' for the origins of the Altar of Iuppiter Pistor ("Jupiter the Miller"; a ''pistor'' is most essentially a pounder of ''far'', "wheat"), celebrated on the first day of the Vestalia, perhaps in relation to the Vestals' duty of preparing ''[[mola salsa]]'', the salted flour used in sacrifices. In February, the [[Quirinalia]] was the last day of the [[Fornacalia]], the "Oven Festival." Littlewood, ''A Commentary on Ovid's'' Fasti'', Book 6,'' pp. lviii–lx, lxxviii; 51, 113–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.G. Frazer]] pointed to a similar throwing away of food abundance as a background to the October Horse, which he saw as the embodiment of the "[[corn spirit]]". According to tradition, the fields consecrated to Mars had been appropriated by the Etruscan king [[Tarquinius Superbus]] for his private use. Accumulated acts of arrogance among the royal family led to the expulsion of the king. The overthrow of the monarchy occurred at harvest time, and the grain from the Campus Martius had already been gathered for [[threshing]]. Even though the tyrant's other property had been seized and redistributed among the people, the consuls declared that the harvest was under religious prohibition. In recognition of the new political liberty, a vote was taken on the matter, after which the grain and chaff were willingly thrown into the Tiber river.&lt;ref&gt;The story is told by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Roman Antiquities'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/5A*.html#13.Campus_Martius 5.13.] The Greek word ''exagistos'' is used to describe the harvest as the equivalent of Latin ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacer|sacer]]'', "belonging to a god" and hence prohibited for human use, either "sacred" or "accursed, made taboo." The story is an ''[[aition]]'' for how the [[Tiber Island]] was created.&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer saw the October Horse as a [[harvest festival]] in origin, because it took place on the king's farmland in the autumn.&lt;ref&gt;[[J.G. Frazer]], ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012 digital reissue of the 1913 edition), pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Since no source accounts for what happens to the horse apart from the head and tail, it is possible that it was reduced to ash and disposed of in the same manner as Tarquin's grain.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," pp. 277, 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The tail===
[[File:Altar Mars Venus Massimo n4.jpg|thumb|Cupids and a ''biga'', relief panel from a [[Trajan]]ic Altar of Venus and Mars, later rededicated to [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]]]]
[[George Devereux]] and others have argued that ''cauda'', or οὐρά ''(oura)'' in Greek sources, is a euphemism for the [[horse penis|penis]] of the October Horse, which could be expected to contain more blood for the ''suffimen''.&lt;ref&gt;George Devereux, "The ''Equus October'' Ritual Reconsidered," ''Mnemosyne'' 23 (1970) 297–201, and James H. Dee, "Propertius IV. 1. 20: ''Curtus equus'' and the ''Equus October''," ''Mnemosyne'' 26 (1973) 289, as summarized but rejected by Daniel P. Harmon, "Religion in the Latin Elegists," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.16.3 (1986) p. 1958. See also [[Walter Burkert]], ''[[Homo Necans]]'' (Berlin and New York, 1972), p. 69. J.N. Adams, ''The Latin Sexual Vocabulary'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1982), pp. 36–37, cautions that the only secure usage of ''cauda'' as slang for the penis is by [[Horace]], ''Sermones'' 1.2.45 and 2.7.49, and may be the poet's "''ad hoc'' [[metaphor]]." ''Cauda'' can also be spelled ''coda''.&lt;/ref&gt; The tail itself, however, was a magico-religious symbol of fertility or power. The practice of attaching a horse's tail to a helmet may originate in a desire to appropriate the animal's power in battle; in the ''Iliad'', [[Hector]]'s horse-crested helmet is a terrifying sight.&lt;ref&gt;Wagenvoort, "On the Magical Significance of the Tail," p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; In the iconography of the [[Mithraic mysteries]], the tail of the sacrificial bull is often grasped, as is the horse's tail in depictions of the [[Thracian horseman|Thracian Rider god]], as if to possess its power.&lt;ref&gt;Wagenvoort, "On the Magical Significance of the Tail," ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[pinax]] from [[ancient Corinth|Corinth]] depicts a dwarf holding his [[phallus]] with both hands while standing on the tail of a stallion carrying a rider; although the dwarf has sometimes been interpreted as the horse-threatening [[Taraxippus]], the phallus is more typically an [[apotropaic]] talisman ''([[fascinum]]'') to ward off malevolence.&lt;ref&gt;Wagenvoort, "On the Magical Significance of the Tail," p. 156, with [https://books.google.com/books?id=xWaOxU28Nn4C&amp;pg=PA152-IA5 image] p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Satyr]]s and [[silenus|sileni]], though later characterized as goat-like, in the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] period were regularly depicted with equine features, including a prominent horsetail; they were known for uncontrolled sexuality, and are often ithyphallic in art.&lt;ref&gt;Wagenvoort, "On the Magical Significance of the Tail," p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Satyrs are first recorded in Roman culture as part of ''ludi'', appearing in the preliminary parade ''([[pompa circensis]])'' of the first [[Ludi Romani|Roman Games]].&lt;ref&gt;T.P. Wiseman, "Satyrs in Rome? The Background to Horace's Ars Poetica," Journal of Roman Studies 78 (1988), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The tail of the [[Mars (mythology)#Sacred animals|wolf, an animal regularly associated with Mars]], was said by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] to contain ''amatorium virus,'' aphrodisiac power.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 8.22.83; Onians, ''The Origins of European Thought'', p. 472.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Phallic sexuality|phallic-like potency]] may be attributed to the October Horse's tail without requiring ''cauda'' to mean "penis," since the ubiquity of phallic symbols in Roman culture would make euphemism or substitution unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil rejected any phallic significance, as noted by Pascal, "October Horse," p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Trojan Horse===
[[File:Miniatur des Codex Vaticanus lat. 2761 Blatt 13r (detail).png|thumb|Laocoon spearing the Trojan Horse ''(Codex Vaticanus lat. 2761)'']]
[[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]] (3rd century BC) attempted to explain the ritual of the October Horse in connection with the [[Trojan Horse]]—an attempt mostly regarded by ancient and modern scholars as "hardly convincing."&lt;ref&gt;Brenk, "An Imperial Heritage," pp. 339–340. Pascal, "October Horse," p. 262, comments that "those ancient commentators who mention Timaeus's idea that the affair is an act of vicarious revenge for the ruse of the Trojan Horse have the good sense to scoff at it."&lt;/ref&gt; As recorded by [[Polybius]] (2nd century BC),

&lt;blockquote&gt;
he tells us that the Romans still commemorate the [[Trojan War|disaster at Troy]] by shooting (κατακοντίζειν, "to spear down") on a certain day a war-horse before the city in the Campus Martius, because the capture of Troy was due to the wooden horse — a most childish statement. For at that rate we should have to say that all barbarian tribes were descendants of the [[Troy|Trojans]], since nearly all of them, or at least the majority, when they are entering on a war or on the eve of a decisive battle sacrifice a horse, divining the issue from the manner in which it falls. Timaeus in dealing with the foolish practice seems to me to exhibit not only ignorance but pedantry in supposing that in sacrificing a horse they do so because Troy was said to have been taken by means of a horse.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/12*.html#4b 12.4.b–c.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plutarch (d. 120 AD) also offers a Trojan origin as a possibility, noting that the Romans claimed to have descended from the Trojans and would want to punish the horse that betrayed the city.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Roman Questions'' 97, without attributing Timaeus.&lt;/ref&gt; Festus said that this was a common belief, but rejects it on the same grounds as Polybius.&lt;ref&gt;Festus, 190 (Lindsay).&lt;/ref&gt;

Mars and a horse's head appear on opposite sides of the earliest Roman [[didrachm]], introduced during the [[Pyrrhic War]], which was the subject of Timaeus's book. [[Michael Crawford (historian)|Michael Crawford]] attributes Timaeus's interest in the October Horse to the appearance of this coinage in conjunction with the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Crawford (historian)|Michael H. Crawford]], ''Roman Republican Coinage'' (Cambridge University Press, 1974, 2001), vol. 1, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Burkert]] has suggested that while the October Horse cannot be taken as a sacrificial reenactment against the Trojan Horse, there may be some shared ritualistic origin. The Trojan Horse succeeded as a stratagem because the Trojans accepted its validity as a [[votum|votive offering]] or dedication to a deity, and they wanted to transfer that power within their own walls. The spear that the Trojan priest [[Laocoön]] drives into the side of the wooden horse is paralleled by the spear used by the officiating priest at the October sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''[[Homo Necans]]'' (Berlin and New York, 1972), pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spear and officiant==
Timaeus, who interpreted the October Horse in light of Rome's claim to Trojan origins, is both the earliest source and the only one that specifies a spear as the sacrificial implement.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', pp. 241–242.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mars (mythology)#The spear of Mars|The spear was an attribute of Mars]] in the way that Jupiter wielded the thunderbolt or [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] the [[trident]]. The spear of Mars was kept in the Regia, the destination of the October Horse's tail. Sacrificial victims were normally felled with a mallet and ''securis'' (sacrificial axe), and other implements would have been necessary for dismembering the horse.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," pp. 265–268.&lt;/ref&gt; A spear was used against the bull in a [[taurobolium]], perhaps as a remnant of the ritual's origin as a hunt, but otherwise it is a sacrificial oddity.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the sacrifice took place in the Campus Martius, during a religious festival celebrated for Mars, it is often assumed that the [[Flamen Martialis]] presided. This priest of Mars may have wielded a spear ritually on other occasions, but no source names the officiant over the October Horse rite.&lt;ref name="Pascal-p262-263"&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," pp. 262–263.&lt;/ref&gt;

==On the calendar==
The ''Equus October'' occurred on the [[Ides (calendar)|Ides]] of October. All Ides were sacred to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. Here as at a few other points in the calendar, a day sacred to Mars doubles up with that of another god.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Equus'' preceded the [[Armilustrium]] ("Purification of Arms") on October 19. Although most of Mars' festivals cluster in his namesake month of March ''([[Martius (month)|Martius]])'', ceremonies pertaining to Mars in October are seen as concluding the season in which he was most active.&lt;ref name="Turcan-p79" /&gt;

[[André Dacier]], an early editor of Festus, noted in regard to the October Horse the tradition that Troy had fallen in October.&lt;ref&gt;André Dacier (as Andreas Dacerius), ''Sex. Pompei Festi et Mar. Verrii Flacci de Verborum Significatione'' (Amsterdam, 1700), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; The October Horse figured in the elaborate efforts of the 19th-century chronologist [[Edward Greswell]] to ascertain the date of that event. Greswell assumed that the ''Equus October'' commemorated the date Troy fell, and after accounting for adjustments to the original [[Roman calendar]] as a result of the [[Julian calendar|Julian reform]], arrived on October 19, 1181 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Greswell, ''Origines Kalendariae Hellenicae: or, The History of the Primitive Calendar among the Greeks'' (Oxford University Press, 1862), vol. 6, pp. 540–547.&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival diametrically opposed to the October Horse on the calendar was the [[Fordicidia]] on the Ides of April. The two festivals were divided by six [[lunation]]s, with a near-perfect symmetry of days (177 and 178) between them in the two halves of the year. The peculiar sacrifice of unborn calves on the Fordicidia provided the other animal ingredient for the ''suffimen'' of the Parilia on April 21.&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo Magini, ''Astronomy and Calendar in Ancient Rome: The Eclipse Festivals'' («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 2001), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plutarch places the horse sacrifice on the Ides of December,&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Roman Questions'' 97.&lt;/ref&gt; presumably because it occurred in the tenth month, which in the original Roman calendar was December instead of October, as indicated by the month's name (from ''decem'', "ten").&lt;ref&gt;Frederick E. Brenk, "An Imperial Heritage: The Religious Spirit of Plutarch of Chaironeia," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.36.1 (1987), p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topography==
Most religious events at Rome were set in a single place, or held simultaneously in multiple locations, such as neighborhoods or private households. But like the ritual of the [[Argei]], the October Horse links several sites within Roman religious topography. The mapping of sites may be part of the ritual's meaning, accumulated in layers over time.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," pp. 285–286.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chariot races and sacrifice take place in the Campus Martius, formerly ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ager|ager]] Tarquiniorum'', Tarquin land,&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], 2.5.2; [[Martin Litchfield West|M.L. West]], ''Indo-European Poetry and Myth'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; an alluvial plain along the [[Tiber river|Tiber]] that was outside the ''[[pomerium]]'', Rome's sacred boundary. Religious rituals involving war, agriculture, and death are regularly held outside the ''pomerium''. The race seems to have been staged with temporary facilities on the [[Trigarium]], near the [[Tarentum (Campus Martius)|Tarentum]], the precinct within which the Altar of [[Dis pater|Dis]] and [[Proserpina]] was located.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses'', pp. 560, 577; Magini, ''Astronomy and Calendar in Ancient Rome,'' p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Father Dis was the [[interpretatio graeca|Roman equivalent]] of the Greek [[Pluto (mythology)|''Plouton'' (Pluto)]], and his consort Proserpina ([[Persephone]]) embodied the vegetative cycle of growth symbolizing the course of the human soul through birth, death, and rebirth into the afterlife, over which the couple presided in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries|mysteries]]. The cult may have been imported to Rome when the [[Saecular Games]] were instituted in 249 BC.&lt;ref&gt;H.D. Jocelyn, ''The Tragedies of Ennius'' (Cambridge University Press, 1967), p. 331, with reference to [[Kurt Latte]], ''Römische Religionsgeschichte'' (C.H. Beck, 1967, 1992), p. 246ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ad Nixas''===
[[File:Sarcofago con eroti aurighi, 2nda metà II sec. dc. 01.JPG|thumb|upright=1.7|Child's sarcophagus (2nd century AD) depicting boyish Cupids driving ''bigae'' at the [[circus (building)|circus]]]]
The sacrifice itself took place within the Tarentum ''ad Nixas'', probably an altar to the deities of birth ''([[di nixi]])'', invoked as ''[[Eileithyia|Ilithyis]]'' and given a nocturnal sacrifice in 17 BC at the Saecular Games, which originated at the site as the ''ludi tarentini''.&lt;ref&gt;G. Sauron, "Documents pour l'exégèse de la mégalographie dionysiaque de Pompeii," in ''Ercolano, 1738–1988: 250 anni di ricerca archeologica'' («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 1993), p. 358; [[Marcel Le Glay]], "Remarques sur la notion de ''[[Salus]]'' dans la religion romaine,"  ''La soteriologia dei culti orientali nell' imperio romano: Études préliminaires au religions orientales dans l'empire romain'', Colloquio internazionale Roma, 1979 (Brill, 1982), p. 442. On campaign, the Roman cavalry regularly set up altars to the "Mothers" ([[Matres and Matrones|''Matres'' or ''Matrones'']]) specified as ''Campestres'', "of the ''campus'' or equestrian field." This form of military devotion was characteristic of the Celtic and Germanic allies; R.W. Davies, "The Training Grounds of the Roman Cavalry," ''Archaeological Journal'' 125 (1968), p. 73 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Festus, the ''ludi tarentini'' were instituted in honor of Mars under Tarquinius Superbus.&lt;ref&gt;Festus, p. 440 in the edition of Lindsay, as noted by [[Calvert Watkins]], ''[[How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of Indo-European Poetics]]'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; Birth deities appear both in the epigraphic record of the 17 BC games and prominently in [[Horace]]'s ''[[Carmen Saeculare]]'', [[occasional poetry|composed for the occasion]] and performed by a children's choir: "In accordance with rite, open up full-term births, Ilithyia: watch over mothers and keep them calm, whether you are best called [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]] or [[Mana Genita|Genitalis]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace]], ''[[Carmen Saeculare]]'', lines 13–16: ''rite maturos aperire partus / lenis, Ilithyia, tuere matres, / sive tu Lucina probas vocari / seu Genitalis.''  ''Lucina'' is a title for both Juno and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] as birth goddesses, and ''Genitalis'' may refer to [[Mana Genita]], a goddess who determined whether infants were born alive or dead. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 20.58; [[H.J. Rose]], ''The Roman Questions of Plutarch'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1924, 1974), pp. 142, 192; David and Noelle Soren, ''A Roman Villa and a Late Roman Infant Cemetery'' («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 1999), p. 520; Simon Goldhill, ''Being Greek Under Rome: Cultural Identity, the Second Sophistic and the Development of Empire'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), pp. 106–107; Emily A McDermott, "Greek and Roman Elements in Horace's Lyric Program," ''Aufsteig under Niedergang der römischen Welt'' (1981), p. 1665. Mana Genita was known for receiving dog sacrifices.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Campus Martius continued in the Imperial era to be a place for equestrian and military training for youth. The Temple of Mars Ultor dedicated in 2 BC by Augustus in the Campus became the site at which young men sacrificed to conclude their [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|rite of passage]] into adulthood when assuming the ''[[toga virilis]]'' ("man's toga") around age 14.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]] 55.10.2; Nicole Belyache, "Religious Actors in Daily Life," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; The October Horse sacrifice for Mars at an altar for birth deities suggests his role as a patron to young warriors who undergo the symbolic rebirth of initiation ritual, a theme also of the equestrian [[Lusus Troiae|Troy Game]]. The [[emperor Julian]] mentions the sacrifice of a horse in Roman initiation rites, without specifying further.&lt;ref&gt;Julian, ''On the Mother of the Gods'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0656%3Aorgpage%3D176d 176D], in connection with dog sacrifices to Hecate among the Greeks and Romans, taken as a reference to the October Horse by Frazer, ''The Golden Bough'' (London, 1890), vol. 2, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; To prove themselves, younger, less experienced drivers usually started out with the two-horse chariots&lt;ref&gt;The ''bigarius'' is ''puerilis'' in ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 6.100078 = ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' 9348; ''infans'' in ''ILS'' 5300.&lt;/ref&gt; that were used in the October Horse race.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, "Apollo and Mars," pp. 147–148; Jean-Paul Thuillier, "Le cirrus et la barbe. Questions d'iconographie athlétique romaine," ''[[Mélanges de l'École française de Rome]], Antiquité'' 110.1 (1998), p. 377, noting that the "major and minor" races held for the [[Robigalia]] may be junior and senior divisions.&lt;/ref&gt; Chariot races are the most common scene depicted on the [[sarcophagi]] of Roman children, and typically show [[Cupid]]s driving ''bigae''.&lt;ref&gt;D'Ambra, "Racing with Death," p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities|Roman rituals of birth and death]] were closely related, given the high rate of [[infant mortality]] and [[death in childbirth]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Corbeill, "Blood, Milk, and Tears: The Gestures of Mourning Women," in ''Nature Embodied: Gesture in Ancient Rome'' (Princeton University Press, 2004), pp. 67–105; M. Golden, "Did the Ancients Care When Their Children Died?" ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 35 (1988) 152–163.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taurian Games]], horse races held in the Campus Martius to propitiate gods of the underworld ''([[di inferi]])'', were instituted in response to an epidemic of infant mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Festus, excerpts of Paulus, p. 479 in the edition of Lindsay; John Briscoe, ''A Commentary on Livy, Books 38–40'' (Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 294; Auguste Bouché-Leclercq, ''Histoire de la divination dans l'antiquité'' (Jérôme Millon, 2003 reprint, originally published 1883), p. 1024.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars think Roman conceptions of Mars were influenced by the Etruscan child-god [[Maris (mythology)|Maris and the centaur Mares]], ancestor of the [[Ausones]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Pallottino]], "Religion in Pre-Roman Italy," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 29; H.S. Versnel, "Apollo and Mars One Hundred Years after Roscher," in ''Visible Religion: Annual for Religious Iconography. Approaches to Iconology'' (Brill, 1985–86), pp. 147–148; Wagenvoort, "The Origin of the ''Ludi Saeculares''," p. 219 ''et passim''; [[John F. Hall|John F. Hall III]], "The Saeculum Novum of Augustus and its Etruscan Antecedents," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.16.3 (1986), p. 2574.&lt;/ref&gt; Maris is depicted with a cauldron symbolizing rebirth, and the half-man, half-horse Mares three times underwent death and rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, "Apollo and Mars,"  pp. 147–148.&lt;/ref&gt; In association with Etruscan-influenced horse-racing festivals, [[John F. Hall]] saw Mars as a god having "power over death."&lt;ref&gt;Hall, "The Saeculum Novum of Augustus," p. 2574.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ad Nixas'' may, however, refer to a landmark called the [[Ciconiae Nixae]] ("[[wikt:travail|Travailing]] Storks"), which did not exist during the [[Roman Republic|Republican period]]. In that case, the original site for the sacrifice was likely to have been the Altar of Mars ''(Ara Martis)'' in the Campus Martius,&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; the oldest center in Rome for the cultivation of Mars as a deity.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ritual bifurcation===
The dismemberment of the horse led to a ritual bifurcation into ceremonies involving the head and tail separately. The tail was speedily transported by foot&lt;ref&gt;Scholars generally assume that the tail was conveyed by a runner, not a horseman or vehicle; the texts specify only that the tail was transported speedily.&lt;/ref&gt; to the Regia. The route would have crossed east of the center of the Campus Martius, and along the outside of the [[Servian Wall]] to the [[Porta Fontinalis]] (in present-day Rome, to the northeast of the [[Altare della Patria]]). A monumental portico built in 193 BC connected the Porta Fontinalis to the Altar of Mars in the Campus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] 35.10.12; John E. Stambaugh, ''The Ancient Roman City'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988), p. 32; Daniel J. Gargola, ''Lands, Laws, and Gods: Magistrates and Ceremonies in the Regulation of Public Lands in Republican Rome'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1995), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Once within the walls, the route would have followed the [[Clivus Lautumiarum]] up to the [[Comitium]], then along the [[Via Sacra]] to the Regia, for about a mile.&lt;ref&gt;Magini, ''Astronomy and Calendar in Ancient Rome,'' p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The blood from the tail was then dripped or smeared onto the sacred hearth. This collocation of divine functions recalls the annual renewal of the fire of Vesta on March 1, the [[Mars (mythology)#Birth|"birthday" of Mars]], when laurel was hung on the Regia and New Year's Day originally was celebrated on the archaic Roman calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

The head became the object of contention between two factions, residents of the [[Via Sacra]] and of the [[Subura]]. The battle decided where the head would be displayed for the coming year. If the Suburan faction won, it would be mounted in their neighborhood on the Tower of the Mamilii ''([[Turris Mamilia]])''. If the residents of the Via Sacra won, the head would go to the Regia, formerly the residence of the king, as well as the destination of the tail.

The claim of the [[Mamilia (gens)|Mamilii]] to the head may be based on their family history, which connected them by marriage to the ruling dynasty of the Tarquins. A Mamilius who was the son-in-law of [[Tarquinius Superbus]], the last Etruscan king, had given him refuge after he was expelled from Rome and the monarchy abolished. Despite this questionable beginning, the Mamilii were later known for loyalty and outstanding service to the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," pp. 279–280. Dumézil claimed that the mock battle represented the Mamilii as traditional enemies of Rome, but Pascal criticizes this interpretation as "an improper emphasis," since the potential for an enemy to possess the talisman of the head would result in a bad omen for the state: "As inconceivably bad as if [[Guy Fawkes Night|Guy Fawkes were to escape the bonfire]]" (p. 280, note 89).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Subura had equine associations in the [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]]. [[Martial]] mentions mule teams on its steep slope, though normally traffic from draft animals was not permitted within Rome during daylight hours.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert E.A. Palmer]], "Silvanus, Sylvester, and the Chair of St. Peter," ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 122.4 (1978), p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription found there indicates that the muleteers sought the divine protection of [[Hercules in ancient Rome|Hercules]], [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]], and [[Epona]]. Silvanus had an association with Mars dating back to the archaic agricultural prayer preserved by [[Cato the Elder|Cato]]'s farming treatise, in which the [[Mars (mythology)#Mars Silvanus|two are invoked]] either as one or jointly to protect the health of livestock. Epona was the Celtic horse goddess,&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, "Silvanus," p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; the sole deity with a [[Gaulish]] name whose cult can be documented in Rome.

Exactly where the ceremonial struggle took place, or how, is unclear, but it implies a final procession to either site.&lt;ref name="Pascal-p285" /&gt;

==Modern interpretations==

===Corn spirit===
During the era of [[Wilhelm Mannhardt]], [[J.G. Frazer]] and the [[Cambridge Ritualists]], the October Horse was regarded as the embodiment of the "[[corn spirit]]", "conceived in human or animal form" in Frazer's view, so that "the last standing corn is part of its body—its neck, its head, or its tail." ("[[wikt:corn|Corn]]" here means "grain" in general, not "[[wikt:maize|maize]]".)&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Frazer, ''The Golden Bough'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012 edition of the original 1890 publication), pp. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Golden Bough'' (1890), Frazer regarded the horse's tail and blood as "the chief parts of the corn-spirit's representative," the transporting of which to the Regia brought the corn-spirit's blessing "to the king's house and hearth" and the community.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, ''The Golden Bough'', p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He conjectured that horses were also sacrificed at the grove of [[Diana Nemorensis]] at [[Ariccia|Aricia]], as a mythic retaliation because the resurrected [[Virbius]], the first divine "King of the Wood" (the priest called ''[[rex nemorensis]]''), had been killed by horses—an explanation also of why horses were banned from the grove. As early as 1908, [[William Warde Fowler]] expressed his doubts that the corn-spirit concept sufficiently accounted for all the ritual aspects of the ''Equus October''.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 245. See also critical discussion by Pascal, "October Horse," pp. 272–273.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dumézil and functionality===

[[Dumézil]] argued that the October Horse preserved vestiges of a [[Proto-Indo-European religion|common Indo-European rite]] of kingship, evidenced also by the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] ''[[ashvamedha]]'' and the [[Horse sacrifice#Irish|Irish inaugural sacrifice]] described by [[Giraldus Cambrensis]] as taking place in [[Ulster]] in the early medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Dumézil]], ''Archaic Roman Religion'' (1970), pp. 224–228; in connection to the Regia, ''The Destiny of a King'' (University of Chicago Press, 1973, 1988; originally published 1971 in French), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most striking similarity between the Vedic ritual and the Roman is that the sacrificial victim was the right-hand horse of a chariot team,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Drews]], ''The Coming of the Greeks: Indo-European Conquests in the Aegean and the Near East'' (Princeton University Press, 1988), p. 151; West, ''Indo-European Poetry and Myth'', p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; though not the winner of a race in the Vedic rite.&lt;ref name="Pascal-p268"&gt;Pascal, "October Horse," p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; The head in the ''ashvamedha'', signifying spiritual energy, was reserved as a talisman for the king afterwards; the middle of the horse embodied physical force; and the tail was grasped by the officiant and represented the fertility of livestock.&lt;ref name="Pascal-p268" /&gt; No race was involved in the Celtic ritual, either; the horse, a mare who seems to have been the sexual surrogate of the goddess of sovereignty, was consumed communally by king and people from a cauldron in which he was immersed and inaugurated. (In the  ''ashvamedha'', the gender of horse and human is reversed.) Both the chariot race and an implied cauldron of initiation (to the extent that the latter might be relevant to the October Horse through the [[wikt:comparanda|comparanda]] of the Troy Game and Mars' assimilation to the child-god Maris) are generally regarded as the elements of the Roman festival most likely to be Etruscan, and thus of [[Etruscan origins|uncertain value as to an Indo-European origin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Drews|Drews]], ''The Coming of the Greeks'', p. 151; Georges-Jean Pinault, "Gaulois ''Epomeduos'', le maître des chevaux," in ''Gaulois et Celtique Continental'' (Droz, 2007), p. 294ff.; Burkert, ''Homo Necans'', pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fundamental differences between the Roman rite and the Vedic and Celtic forms pose obstacles to situating the ''Equus October'' within the [[Trifunctional hypothesis|trifunctional schema]].&lt;ref&gt;Udo Strutynski, introduction to Georges Dumézil, ''Camillus: A Study of Indo-European Religion as Roman History'' (University of California Press, 1980), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''equus'' is sacrificed to the Roman god of war, not kingship. Dumézil's follower [[Jaan Puhvel]] deals with the Roman rite only glancingly in his essay "Aspects of Equine Functionality," exploring mainly the Vedic and Celtic evidence for an "Indo-European equine myth" that "involves the mating of a kingship-class representative with the hippomorphous transfunctional goddess, and the creation of twin offspring belonging to the level of the third estate."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaan Puhvel]], "Aspects of Equine Functionality," in  ''Analecta Indoeuropaea'' (Innsbruck, 1981), pp. 193 and 197. Puhvel finds the "transfunctional goddess" in Roman religion as ''[[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] Seispes Mater Regina'' ("Juno the Unblemished, Mother and Queen) whose [[Cult (religion)|cult]] was at [[Lanuvium]]. See also Miriam Robbins Dexter, "Consort Goddess," ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Puhvel finds few linkages between the October Horse and the ''ásvamedha'', primarily because the method of killing the horse differs so dramatically, and the crucial element of ritual mating is absent. He observes, however, that "the absence of the sexual element in Roman horse sacrifice is no surprise, for early Roman ritual is exceedingly nonerotic"—an avoidance he attributes to the Romans' desire to differentiate [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|their sexual probity]] from the supposed license of the Etruscans.&lt;ref&gt;Puhvel, "Aspects of Equine Functionality," pp. 188 and 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Homo Necans''===
In ''[[Homo Necans]]'', [[Walter Burkert]] saw the October Horse as a "sacrifice of dissolution" (hence his willingness to entertain the ancient tradition that associated it with the [[Trojan War|Fall of Troy]]), and the struggle for the head as an ''[[agon]]'', a competitive contest that vents violence and rage, as do funeral games.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Homo Necans'', pp. 53–54, 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Julius Caesar and human sacrifice===
In 46&amp;nbsp;BCE, discontent arose among the troops supporting [[Julius Caesar]] in the [[Caesar's Civil War|civil wars]]. His lavish public expenditures, they complained, came at their expense: Instead of raising the army's pay, Caesar was using his newly confiscated wealth for such displays as a silk canopy to shelter spectators at the games he staged. The disgruntled soldiers rioted. Caesar came upon them, and shocked them back into discipline by killing one on sight. According to [[Cassius Dio]], the sole source for the episode:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Two others were slain as a sort of ritual observance (''hierourgia,'' ἱερουργία). The true cause I am unable to state, inasmuch as the Sibyl made no utterance and there was no other similar oracle, but at any rate they were sacrificed in the Campus Martius by the ''[[College of Pontiffs|pontifices]]'' and the [[Flamen Martialis|priest of Mars]], and their heads were set up near the Regia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cassius Dio |title=Roman History |author-link=Cassius Dio |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/43*.html#24 |at=43.24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Both Wissowa&lt;ref&gt;Georg Wissowa, ''Religion und Kultus der Römer'', 2nd edition, p. 144f (as cited by Pascal, "October Horse," p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; and Dumézil&lt;ref&gt;Georges Dumezil, "Quaestiunculae indo-italicae 17: Le 'sacrifice humain' de 46 avant J.-C.," ''REL'' 41 (1963) 87-89, and ''La religion romaine archaique'' (Paris, 1966), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; read Dio's sardonic take on these events to mean that an actual sacrifice occurred with human victims replacing the October Horse.

'''Online film festivals''' are [[film festivals]] that are held entirely online. In some cases the films are shown for a certain amount of time where viewers can vote. But mostly the winners are selected by the festival organisation or a designated jury.

Top Shorts and The Monthly Film Festival are some leading online film festivals. Ranked in the top 10 Best and most reviewed festivals out of over 5000 of the world's best film festivals and among the first from the online film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;Top Shorts on FilmFreeway https://filmfreeway.com/festival/ts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TMFF on FilmFreeway https://filmfreeway.com/festival/tmff&lt;/ref&gt;

The first online film festival pioneered in the 1990s by the Webdance Film Festival.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

The rapid pace of technological advancement had a huge effect on film festivals moving them into the online space. Many new filmmakers are starting to produce and edit their films on computers rather than on celluloid. And many film lovers are looking to the Internet for the latest independent releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Watson |first=Stephanie |title=What are film festivals? |url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/question743.htm |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film festivals continue to be an important outlet for filmmakers who want to showcase their works and seek audiences and investors. Many of the major film festivals understand that an online component is going to become an important part of future festivals—and future films in general.

'''Online predators''' are individuals who commit [[child sexual abuse]] that begins or takes place on the [[Internet]].

==Conceptions==
Internet-facilitated sex crimes against minors involve deceit and begin with adults communicating with children over the Internet with the goal of coercing them into illegal sexual activity. Sometimes the sexual abuse happens face to face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/06aug/01158/home.html|title=Internet Safety: Keeping It Real|publisher=[[Oracle Thinkquest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahaparenting.com/parenting-tools|title=[CONTENT] - Parenting Tips|website=www.ahaparenting.com|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chat rooms]], [[instant messaging]], [[Internet forums]], [[social networking sites]], [[Mobile phone|cell phones]], and even [[video game console]]s have issues with online predations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Microsoft.com/protect/family/guidelines/predators.mspx |title=Online Predators: Help minimize the risk|publisher= Microsoft Corporation |date=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Williams| first = Pete| authorlink = Pete Williams (journalist)| coauthors =| title = MySpace, Facebook attract online predators| work =

Initial manipulation often involves introducing the minors to sexual activity, showing them pornography, and requesting sexually explicit information and pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lanning|first=Kenneth|date=2005|title=Compliant Child Victims: Confronting an Uncomfortable Reality|url=|journal=ASPAC Advisor|volume=|pages=14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This online predatory behavior does not often lead to offline contact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Even though it is the mainstream view that predators will use distinct tactics to meet victims, most actual in-person meetings do not involve any deception. In fact, the minors are usually complicit with perpetrators often using promises of love and romance to seduce victims to meet.&lt;ref&gt;Troup-Leasure K, Snyder HN. Statutory rape known to law enforcement. Juvenile Justice Bulletin; 2005 Aug.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laws ===
In Australia, the [[murder of Carly Ryan]] in February 2007 led to public opinion pressure which eventually resulted in nationwide legal changes, nicknamed "Carly's Law", being made in 2017 to help protect minors online.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/bd/bd1617a/17bd100|title=Criminal Code Amendment (Protecting Minors Online) Bill 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan, aged 15, was a victim of online [[Child grooming|grooming]] and predatory behaviour, which was considered unique at the time, given that Ryan was the first person in Australia (and possibly the world&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news.com.au/national/crime/todays-best-stories-from-true-crime-australia/news-story/c885a1599a946aab4f2c0436008b9790|title=Today’s top True Crime content|work=NewsComAu|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;) killed by an online paedophile.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/australia/the-australian-womens-weekly/20170907/281857233682330|title=My little girl was killed by an internet predator|last=Australian Woman’s Weekly|first=|date=2017-09-07|website=www.pressreader.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://casefilepodcast.com/case-91-carly-ryan/|title=Case 91: Carly Ryan – Casefile: True Crime Podcast|date=2018-08-04|work=Casefile: True Crime Podcast|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., some individuals have initiated actions against laws designed to protect children. ''[[Doe v. Shurtleff]]'', 628 F.3d 1217 (10th Cir. 2010), was a [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]] case assessing the constitutionality of [https://web.archive.org/web/20111228045556/http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE77/htm/77_27_002105.htm Utah Code Ann. § 77-27-21.5], a law that requires [[Sex offender registries in the United States|sex offenders to register]] their internet identifiers with the state in order to "assist in investigating kidnapping and sex-related crimes, and in apprehending offenders".&lt;ref name="courtop"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Doe v.

==Criticism==
Cases involving stalking, violence, abduction, rape and/or murder are very rare. Most online sex offenders are young adults who target teens and seduce victims into sexual relationships. They take time to develop the trust and confidence of teens, so the teens see these relationships as romances or sexual adventures. Nearly 75 percent of victims who met offenders face-to-face did so more than once. Most of these offenders are charged with crimes such as statutory rape for non-forcible sexual contact as the victims are, by law, [[Ages of consent in North America|too young to consent]]. The youth most vulnerable to online sex offenders have histories of sexual or physical abuse, family problems, and tendencies to take risks both on- and offline. A 2007 study found no cases of minors being targeted by internet predators on the basis of information they had posted on social networking sites. The research that concluded the statistic that "1 in 5 children are sexually solicited online"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.attorneygeneral.gov/uploadedfiles/crime/cybersafety.pdf|title=Pennsylvania attorney general: cybersafety|publisher=|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is being questioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/02/26/1322248 Spreading "1 in 5" Number Does More Harm Than Good], [[Slashdot]], Feb 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3866">'''Pavarana''' ({{lang-sa|'''Pravāraṇā'''}}) is a Buddhist [[Buddhist holidays|holy day]] celebrated on Aashvin [[full moon]] of the  [[lunar month]]. It marks the end of the 3 lunar months of [[Vassa]], sometimes called "Buddhist Lent." The day is marked in some Asian countries where [[Theravada Buddhism]] is practiced. On this day, each monk ([[Pali]]: ''[[bhikkhu]]'') must come before the community of monks (''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]'') and atone for an offense he may have committed during the Vassa.

Most [[Mahayana]] Buddhists do not observe Vassa, though many Son/Thien monks in Korea and Vietnam do observe an equivalent retreat of three months of intensive practice in one location. 

== Origins ==

In India, where Buddhism began, there is a three-month-long rainy season.  According to the [[Vinaya]] (Mahavagga, Fourth Khandhaka, section I), in the time of the Buddha, once during this rainy season, a group of normally wandering monks sought shelter by co-habitating in a residence.  In order to minimize potential inter-personal strife while co-habitating, the monks agreed to remain silent for the entire three months and agreed upon a non-verbal means for sharing alms.

After this rains retreat, when the Buddha learned of the monks' silence, he described such a measure as "foolish."  Instead, the Buddha instituted the Pavarana Ceremony as a means for dealing with potential conflict and breaches of disciplinary rules ([[Patimokkha]]) during the vassa season.  The Buddha said:

:'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that the Bhikkhus, when they have finished their Vassa residence, hold Pavâranâ with each other in these three ways: by what [offence] has been seen, or by what has been heard, or by what is suspected. Hence it will result that you live in accord with each other, that you atone for the offences (you have committed), and that you keep the rules of discipline before your eyes.

:'And you ought, O Bhikkhus, to hold Pavâranâ in this way:

:'Let a learned, competent Bhikkhu proclaim the following ñatti [motion] before the Samgha: "Let the Samgha, reverend Sirs, hear me. To-day is the Pavâranâ day. If the Samgha is ready, let the Samgha hold Pavâranâ."

:'Then let the senior Bhikkhu adjust his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, sit down squatting, raise his joined hands, and say: "I pronounce my Pavâranâ, friends, before the Samgha, by what has been seen, or by what has been heard, or by what is suspected; may you speak to me, Sirs, out of compassion towards me; if I see (an offence), I will atone for it. And for the second time, &amp;c. And for the third time I pronounce my Pavâranâ (&amp;c., down to) if I see (an offence), I will atone for it."

:'Then let (each) younger Bhikkhu adjust his upper robe . . . . (&amp;c.)'&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Oldenberg (1881), pp. 329-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1355">The '''Phoenicids''' are a minor [[meteor shower]], first noticed by observers in New Zealand, Australia, the Indian Ocean, and South Africa during an outburst of approximately 100 meteors an hour that occurred during December 1956. Like other meteor showers, the Phoenicids get their name from the location of their [[Radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]], which is in the constellation [[Phoenix (constellation)|Phoenix]]. They are active from 29 November to 9 December, with a peak occurring around 5/6 December each year,&lt;ref&gt;http://meteorshowersonline.com/showers/phoenicids.html&lt;/ref&gt; and are best seen from the Southern Hemisphere.

The Phoenicids appear to be associated with a stream of material from the disintegrating comet [[D/1819 W1 (Blanpain)]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Jenniskens and E. Lyytinen, METEOR SHOWERS FROM THE DEBRIS OF BROKEN COMETS: D/1819 W1 (BLANPAIN), 2003 WY25, AND THE PHOENICIDS.The Astronomical Journal, 130:1286–90, 2005 September&lt;/ref&gt;

A very minor meteor shower with a radiant in Phoenix also occurs in July; this shower is referred to as the '''July Phoenicids'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://meteorshowersonline.com/showers/july_phoenicids.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''round-robin letter''' or '''Christmas letter''' is a letter, typically included with a [[Christmas card]] and sent to multiple recipients at the end of the year, in which the writer describes the year's events for himself and/or his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Round Robins|url=http://www.debretts.com/etiquette/home-life/family-occasions/christmas/round-robins.aspx|work=Debrett's|publisher=Debrett's|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110090257/http://www.debretts.com/etiquette/home-life/family-occasions/christmas/round-robins.aspx|archivedate=2014-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The round-robin letter has been the subject of much ridicule, particularly from the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' journalist [[Simon Hoggart]], who compiled examples of the genre in his newspaper column, as well as writing the book ''The Hamster That Loved Puccini: The Seven Modern Sins of Christmas Round-robin Letters''. One example Hoggart cited read:
{{quote|"Harry was Jesus in the school ''Jesus Christ, Superstar''. This was the best production I have ever seen, youth or adult. Both boys, especially Harry, were physically and emotionally drained at the end. I was drained too… seeing your son crucified nightly is not an experience I would recommend."&lt;ref name=beeb/&gt;}}

Critics have drawn attention to a number of typical negative characteristics of the letters, including the airbrushing of bad news, the "excruciating" level of banal detail, and the implied egocentricity and boastfulness of the sender.&lt;ref name=beeb&gt;{{cite news|title=Why are round-robin letters so annoying?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7785410.stm|accessdate=10 January 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=22 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gawker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5880048/behold-the-most-obnoxious-christmas-letter-ever|title=Behold, the Most Obnoxious Christmas Letter Ever|last=Read|first=Max|work=Gawker|publisher=Gawker Media|date=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survival of the tradition in the face of such criticism has been termed "heroic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pritchett|first=Oliver|title=Three jeers for the round robin!|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/9750489/Three-jeers-for-the-round-robin.html|accessdate=10 January 2014|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student Volunteer Army===
Following the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes, Johnson founded the [[Student Volunteer Army]] to assist residents with the clean up of [[liquefaction]] caused by the earthquakes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/resource/0000128359 |title=Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) : 14 September 2010 |publisher=Parliament.nz |accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tina Law |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/6203771/Its-a-new-world-for-students |title=Kohan McNab &amp;#124; It's A New World For Students |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Student Volunteer Army was managed by a core team of 15 people and a wider administration of 70 people who managed the three core operations which the SVA focused on; battalions, squadrons and street teams.&lt;ref name="volunteerarmy.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volunteerarmy.org/about/|title=About – Volunteer Army Foundation|date=|publisher=Volunteerarmy.org|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 13,000 students volunteering per week.&lt;ref name="Listener"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listener.co.nz/commentary/sam-the-man/|title=Sam the man|date=18 April 2011|publisher=[[New Zealand Listener]]|accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:StudentArmy IlamSchool.jpg|thumb|StudentArmy IlamSchool in March 2011]]

===Disaster response and preparedness   ===
[[File:In Ishinomaki, Japan.JPG|thumb|Johnson in a Tsunami stricken home in Japan]]
In late April and early May 2011, Johnson spent two weeks in Japan following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] to set up a Student Volunteer Army at [[Waseda University]].&lt;ref name="Japan (Stuff)"&gt;{{cite news|last=McKenzie-McLean|first=Jo|title=Japan to use Christchurch volunteer model|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-earthquake/4986898/Japan-to-use-Christchurch-volunteer-model|accessdate=14 July 2011|newspaper=Stuff.co.nz|date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CIA Director George Tenet (left) and UN Ambassador John Negroponte look on from behind.  The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found that many of the allegations in the speech were not supported by the underlying intelligence.]]

The '''Senate Report on Iraqi WMD Intelligence''' (formally, the "Report of the Select Committee on Intelligence on the U.S. Intelligence Community's Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq") was the report by the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] concerning the [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. intelligence community]]'s assessments of Iraq during the time leading up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. The report, which was released on July 9, 2004, identified numerous failures in the intelligence-gathering and -analysis process. The report found that these failures led to the creation of inaccurate materials that misled both government policy makers and the American public.

The Committee's nine Republicans and eight Democrats agreed on the report's major conclusions and unanimously endorsed its findings. They disagreed, though, on the impact that statements on Iraq by senior members of the Bush administration had on the intelligence process.  The second phase of the investigation, addressing the way senior policymakers used the intelligence, was published on May 25, 2007.  Portions of the phase II report not released at that time include the review of public statements by U.S. government leaders prior to the war, and the assessment of the activities of Douglas Feith and the Pentagon's [[Office of Special Plans]].

== Background ==
After the 1991 [[Gulf War]], Iraq agreed to destroy its stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and dismantle its WMD programs. To verify compliance, UN inspection teams were to be given free access to the country. Over the next seven years, inspectors sometimes complained about non-cooperation and evasiveness by the Iraqi government. Iraqi officials in turn complained that some weapons inspectors were acting as spies for foreign intelligence agencies. In 1998, after a critical report on the Iraqi government's noncompliance was issued by UN weapons inspector [[Richard Butler (diplomat)|Richard Butler]], U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] announced that he would launch airstrikes on Iraqi targets (see [[Operation Desert Fox]]). Butler evacuated his inspectors and the bombing proceeded. After the bombing campaign, Iraq refused to allow weapons inspectors to re-enter the country.

After [[George W. Bush]] became president in January 2001, and especially after the [[September 11 attacks]], the U.S. government increased its attention on Iraq. In the first half of 2002, a series of public statements by President Bush and senior members of his administration indicated a willingness to use force, if necessary, to remove Saddam Hussein from power. On October 1, 2002, the CIA delivered a classified National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) assessing the threat represented by Iraq's WMD activities. Three days later, CIA Director George Tenet published an unclassified white paper on the subject of Iraq's WMD capabilities. Over the next two weeks, a [[Iraq Resolution|joint resolution authorizing the use of force]] was passed by both houses of Congress.

Over the next several months the U.S. conducted a diplomatic effort at the United Nations, seeking to obtain that body's approval for a new WMD inspection regime, and, potentially, for the use of force to overthrow the Iraqi government. The UN Security Council passed [[UN Security Council Resolution 1441|resolution 1441]] on November 8, 2002, calling on Iraq to make "an accurate full, final, and complete disclosure" of its WMD programs, and threatening "serious consequences" if it did not comply. In the wake of resolution 1441, Iraq allowed UN weapons inspectors to return to the country. While the inspections were taking place, the U.S. continued to lobby the members of the UN Security Council to pass a resolution explicitly authorizing the use of force against Iraq. As part of that effort U.S. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] gave a presentation to the UN on February 5, 2003, in which he detailed false intelligence gatherings provided by the Israeli government regarding Iraqi WMD. The USA was faced with the opposition of a majority of the Security Council's members, including Germany, France, and Russia, and afterwards abandoned the effort to obtain an explicit use-of-force authorization from the UN.

Bush addresses the nation from the Oval Office, March 19, 2003, to announce the beginning of [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Operation Iraqi Freedom]].

On March 20, 2003, the U.S. and its allies [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invaded Iraq]], an action that led to the overthrow of the government of Saddam Hussein.

Over the ensuing year, U.S. and allied forces searched for evidence supporting the pre-invasion claims about Iraqi WMD stockpiles and programs. The lead role in this search was played by the [[Iraq Survey Group]] (ISG), consisting of investigators from the U.S. Department of Defense and the CIA. Although scattered remnants of Iraq's WMD stockpiles from the time of the 1991 Gulf War were found, the ISG's final report concluded that Iraq did not possess significant WMD capabilities at the time of the invasion Iraq. The ISG also stated that Iraq had intended to restart all banned weapons programs as soon as multilateral sanctions against it had been dropped.

As these facts were emerging in June 2003, U.S. Senator [[Pat Roberts]] (R-KS), chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]], announced that the Committee, as part of its regular oversight responsibility, would conduct a "thorough and bipartisan review" of Iraqi WMD and ties to terrorist groups. On June 20, 2003, Senator Roberts and Senator John D. Rockefeller IV (D-WV), the Committee's vice chairman, issued a joint press release announcing that the committee would conduct a detailed review of the Iraqi WMD intelligence process, including the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title=Press Release |url=http://intelligence.senate.gov/030620.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030627215056/http://intelligence.senate.gov/030620.htm |archive-date=27 June 2003 |publisher=[[U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] |access-date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the quantity and quality of U.S. intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction programs, ties to terrorist groups, Saddam Hussein's threat to stability and security in the region, and his repression of his own people;
* the objectivity, reasonableness, independence, and accuracy of the judgments reached by the Intelligence Community;
* whether those judgments were properly disseminated to policy makers in the Executive Branch and Congress;
* whether any influence was brought to bear on anyone to shape their analysis to support policy objectives; and
* other issues we mutually identify in the course of the Committee's review.

== Committee membership at the time of the investigation ==

The following nine Republicans were members of the Committee at the time the investigation was launched: Committee Chairman [[Pat Roberts|C. Patrick Roberts]] (R-KS), [[Orrin G. Hatch]] (R-UT), [[Mike DeWine|R. Michael DeWine]] (R-OH), [[Kit Bond|Christopher S. "Kit" Bond]] (R-MO), [[Trent Lott|C. Trent Lott]] (R-MS), [[Olympia J. Snowe]] (R-ME), [[Chuck Hagel|Charles Hagel]] (R-NE), [[Saxby Chambliss|C. Saxby Chambliss]] (R-GA), and [[John W. Warner]] (R-VA).

The following eight Democrats made up the rest of the Committee: Vice-Chairman [[Jay Rockefeller|John D. "Jay" Rockefeller IV]] (D-WV),  [[Carl Levin]] (D-MI), [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-CA), [[Ron Wyden|Ronald L. Wyden]] (D-OR), [[Dick Durbin|Richard J. Durbin]] (D-IL), [[Evan Bayh|B. Evans "Evan" Bayh III]] (D-IN), [[John Edwards|Johnny R. "John" Edwards]] (D-NC),  and [[Barbara A. Mikulski]] (D-MD).

== Chronology of the investigation ==
In the course of the investigation, Committee staff reviewed more than 30,000 pages of documentation provided by the intelligence community. The Committee requested that it be supplied copies of the President's Daily Briefs (PDBs) concerning Iraq's WMD capabilities and ties to terrorism, but the White House denied that request. An article by journalist [[Murray Waas]] has described a specific controversy over the PDB for September 21, 2001, which allegedly said that the US intelligence community had "no evidence" linking Saddam Hussein to the September 11 attacks, and "scant credible evidence" that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with al Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationaljournal.com/about/njweekly/stories/2005/1122nj1.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516071522/http://nationaljournal.com/about/njweekly/stories/2005/1122nj1.htm |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Committee staff also interviewed more than 200 people, including intelligence analysts and senior officials with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], and other federal entities involved in intelligence gathering and analysis. The Committee also held a series of hearings on the intelligence concerning Iraqi WMD and ties to terrorism.

On February 12, 2004, Senators Roberts and Rockefeller [http://intelligence.senate.gov/040212.htm announced an expansion] of the scope of the investigation. The new elements added to the investigation were:

* ''the collection of intelligence on Iraq from the end of the Gulf War to the commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom;''
* ''whether public statements and reports and testimony regarding Iraq by U.S. Government officials made between the Gulf War period and the commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom were substantiated by intelligence information;''
* ''the postwar findings about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and weapons programs and links to terrorism and how they compare with prewar assessments;''
* ''prewar intelligence assessments about postwar Iraq;''
* ''any intelligence activities relating to Iraq conducted by the Policy Counterterrorism Evaluation Group (PCTEG) and the Office of Special Plans within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy; and''
* ''the use by the Intelligence Community of information provided by the Iraqi National Congress (INC).''

On June 17, 2004, Senators Roberts and Rockefeller [http://intelligence.senate.gov/040617.htm announced] that the completed report had been unanimously approved by the Committee's members, and that they were working with the CIA on the issue of declassification. The completed report, with blacked-out text ("redactions") made by the CIA, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/09/politics/09TEXT-IRAQ-INTEL.html?ex=1118635200&amp;en=9a4aaaccd18175f2&amp;ei=5070&amp;ex=1117598400&amp;en=34db54cb5d6c9b93&amp;ei=5070&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position= was released] on July 9, 2004. The report did not cover most of the new topics announced in the February 12, 2004, press release; instead, those topics were now to be covered in a separate report, to be completed later, covering "phase two" of the investigation.

== Phase I conclusions ==

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20071225161422/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/iraq.html 511-page report] focuses much of its attention on the October, 2002, classified National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) titled ''Iraq's Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction''. The report includes 117 formal conclusions, as well as supporting discussion and background information.

=== General conclusions on intelligence relating to Iraq's WMD and ties to terrorism ===
The report's first conclusion points to widespread flaws in the October 2002 NIE, and attributes those flaws to failure by analysts in the intelligence community:

:''Most of the major key judgments in the Intelligence Community's October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), Iraq's Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction, either overstated, or were not supported by, the underlying intelligence reporting. A series of failures, particularly in analytic trade craft, led to the mischaracterization of the intelligence.''

Subsequent conclusions fault the intelligence community for failing to adequately explain to policymakers the uncertainties that underlay the NIE's conclusions, and for succumbing to "group think," in which the intelligence community adopted untested (and, in hindsight, unwarranted) assumptions about the extent of Iraq's WMD stockpiles and programs. The committee identified a failure to adequately supervise analysts and collectors, and a failure to develop human sources of intelligence (HUMINT) inside Iraq after the departure of international weapons inspectors in 1998. It also cited the post-9/11 environment as having led to an increase in the intensity with which policymakers review and question threat information.

=== Niger and the Iraqi nuclear program ===
Section II of the report discussed the handling of intelligence indicating that Iraq might be attempting to purchase uranium from Niger. The report examined the role played by former ambassador Joseph Wilson in investigating the issue, and the way Wilson's assessment was communicated within the intelligence community. It also discusses the process whereby references to Iraq's uranium-procurement efforts were removed from some speeches at the behest of intelligence officials, but left in President Bush's 2003 State of the Union address.  The report concludes that prior to October, 2002, it was reasonable for the intelligence community to assess Iraq may have been attempting to obtain uranium from Africa.
{{See|Senate Reports of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq pertaining to Joseph C. Wilson's Niger Trip}}

Section III of the report discusses assessments of Iraq's domestic nuclear program. It focuses a significant amount of attention on the intelligence process that took place in the spring of 2001 regarding Iraq's attempts to purchase 60,000 high-strength aluminum tubes. The CIA concluded that the tubes could be intended for constructing centrifuges for a uranium-enrichment program (i.e., for a restarted Iraqi nuclear weapons program); analysts in the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense considered that to be unlikely.

The October 2002 NIE stated that Iraq appeared to be reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. The Committee's report concluded that this view was not supported by the underlying intelligence, and the report agreed with the opinion of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, expressed as an "alternative view" in the NIE, that the available intelligence did not make "a compelling case for reconstitution" of the Iraqi nuclear program. The committee reached several conclusions critical of poor communications between the CIA and other parts of the intelligence community concerning this issue.

{{see|Iraqi_aluminum_tubes#Report_of_the_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence}}

=== Biological weapons, chemical weapons, and delivery systems ===
The sections of the report concerned with assessments of Iraq's biological weapons programs, chemical weapons programs, and delivery systems contain extensive discussion of the problem of inadequate "human intelligence" for intelligence gathering in Iraq. There is discussion of "[[Curveball (informant)|CURVEBALL]]," an Iraqi defector who provided much of the information regarding Iraq's alleged mobile bioweapons labs, although much of the material in this part of the report has been redacted. The report concludes that the October 2002 NIE and other statements regarding Iraq's biological and chemical WMD and associated delivery systems were for the most part not supported by the underlying intelligence data supplied to the Committee.

Committee Chairman Pat Roberts told NBC's Tim Russert that "Curveball really provided 98 percent of the assessment as to whether or not the Iraqis had a biological weapon."&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/07/11/senate.pentagon/ CNN.com - Pentagon's prewar intelligence role questioned - Jul 11, 2004]. Edition.cnn.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt; This was in despite the fact that "nobody inside the U.S. government had ever actually spoken to the informant—except [for a single] Pentagon analyst, who concluded the man was an alcoholic and utterly useless as a source."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/5412317/site/newsweek ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614061657/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/5412317/site/newsweek |date=June 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After learning the intelligence provided by Curveball was going to be used as the "backbone" of the case for war, the Pentagon analyst wrote a letter to the CIA expressing his concerns. The Deputy of the CIA Counter Proliferation Unit quickly responded by saying:

''"Let's keep in mind the fact that this war's going to happen regardless of what Curve Ball said or didn't say. The Powers That Be probably aren't terribly interested in whether Curve Ball knows what he's talking about."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7369843/site/newsweek/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050506052027/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7369843/site/newsweek/ |date=May 6, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

One area where the Committee found that the intelligence community's reporting accurately reflected the underlying intelligence concerned Iraq's retention of Scud-type ballistic missiles, and its development of new types of short- and medium-range missiles. In the case of the NIE's reporting on Iraq's development of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), however, the Committee found that the reporting generally was not well-supported by the underlying intelligence, and overstated what was known concerning the likelihood that the Iraqi UAVs were intended for use as a delivery means for biological weapons.

=== Colin Powell's speech to the UN ===

Section VII of the Committee's report focuses on the intelligence behind Secretary of State Colin Powell's speech to the UN on February 5, 2003. The report describes the process whereby the CIA provided a draft of the speech to the National Security Council (NSC), and then, at the request of the NSC, worked to expand the speech with additional material, especially regarding Iraq's nuclear program. The report also describes the subsequent review made by Colin Powell and analysts from the State Department with analysts from the CIA. In the speech, Powell said that "every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are not assertions. What we're giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence." Despite this, the Committee concluded that "[m]uch of the information provided or cleared by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for inclusion in Secretary Powell's speech was overstated, misleading, or incorrect."

=== Pressure on analysts ===
The report partially looks at the question of whether pressure was brought to bear on intelligence analysts to get them to shape their assessments to support particular policy objectives. It recounts how Sen. Roberts made repeated public calls for any analysts who believed they had been pressured to alter their assessments to speak with the Committee about their experiences. The Committee also attempted to identify and interview several individuals who had described such pressure in media reports and government documents. The report says that the Committee did not find any evidence that administration officials tried to pressure analysts to change their judgments; however, an evaluation of the Bush Administration's use of intelligence was put off until "phase two" of the investigation. (Several Democratic committee members, although they voted to approve the report's conclusions, expressed reservations on this issue and Republicans also acknowledged that the issue of "pressure" would be examined during phase two; see below, in the discussion of the report's "additional views", for details.)

=== The October 2002 white paper ===
[[Image:Bush auth jbc.jpg|thumb|300px|right|President George Bush, surrounded by leaders of the House and Senate, announces the [[Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq]], October 2, 2002. Lawmakers debated and passed the resolution during the following two weeks, basing their votes in part on the information in the classified National Intelligence Estimate and the unclassified white paper on Iraqi WMD -- documents that the Senate report on pre-war intelligence found to have been deeply flawed.]]

A white paper titled "Iraq's Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction" was released by CIA Director George Tenet on October 4, 2002, three days after the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraqi WMD was released. In part, the white paper was a response to Congressional requests for an unclassified version of the information in the NIE, since that document was available only to a small group of lawmakers due to its classified nature. The white paper, although shorter and less-detailed than the NIE, was very similar to it in format and major conclusions. The Committee found that the white paper presented a significantly stronger characterization of the threat represented by Iraqi WMD than did the NIE, and that that stronger characterization was not supported by the underlying intelligence.

=== Iraq's alleged links to al-Qaeda ===
{{See|Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda}}

Several sections in the report examine topics relating to allegations of links between Iraq and terrorism. The Committee said that the intelligence community produced reasonable conclusions on this topic, although the Committee found gaps in the intelligence-gathering methods used [http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/13jul20041400/www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/pdf/s108-301/sec13.pdf (Page 350)].

Much of the Committee's investigation in this area concerned the CIA's preparation and distribution of a document titled ''Iraqi Support for Terrorism''. An initial version of this document was distributed to senior Bush administration officials in September, 2002; an updated version of the document was provided to Congress in January, 2003. The conclusion of CIA analysts was that although Saddam Hussein's government had likely had several contacts with al Qaeda during the 1990s, "those contacts did not add up to an established formal relationship." The CIA also attempted to determine the attitudes that Iraqi and al-Qaeda leadership held toward the possibility of working cooperatively with each other. The available intelligence in this area suggested that Iraqi and al-Qaeda leaders would be wary of working together.

The "most problematic area of contact between Iraq and al-Qaida were the reports of training in the use of non-conventional weapons, specifically chemical and biological weapons."  [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] had been present in Baghdad, and [[Ansar al-Islam]], an al-Qaeda affiliate organization that identified itself as the "sworn enemy" of Saddam Hussein had operated in northeastern Iraq in an area under Kurdish control. There was no evidence proving Iraqi complicity or assistance in an al Qaeda attack. The report criticized the CIA for its lack of human intelligence resources in Iraq to assess the country's ties with terrorism during the time prior to 2002.

In terms of pressure on analysts, the Committee said that after 9/11, "analysts were under tremendous pressure to make correct assessments, to avoid missing a credible threat, and to avoid an intelligence failure on the scale of 9/11." The Committee concluded that this resulted in assessments that were "bold and assertive in pointing out potential terrorist links," and that this pressure was more the result of analysts' own desire to be as thorough as possible, than of any undue influence by the administration, for which the Committee said they found no evidence. Several Democratic members of the Committee said in the report's "additional views" that the question had not been adequately explored.

== The report's "additional views" ==
The Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence voted unanimously to approve the finished report. There were, however, significant areas of disagreement, with those disagreements being expressed in the form of "additional views" attached at the end of the report proper.

=== Senators Roberts, Hatch, and Bond ===
In the first "additional view" attached to the report, Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS), joined by Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Christopher Bond (R-MO), presents two conclusions that Democratic members of the Committee were unwilling to include in the report, even though, according to Roberts, "there was no dispute with the underlying facts." Those two conclusions related to the actions of Joseph Wilson, the former ambassador who was sent to Niger in 2002 to investigate allegations that the Iraqi government was attempting to purchase "yellowcake" uranium, presumably as part of an attempt to revive Iraq's nuclear weapons program. The two conclusions were that the plan to send Wilson to investigate the Niger allegation was suggested by Wilson's wife, a CIA employee, and that in his later public statements criticizing the Bush administration, Wilson included information he had learned from press accounts, misrepresenting it as firsthand knowledge.

This additional view also discusses the question of pressure on analysts, and recommends caution in implementing reforms in the intelligence community.

=== Senators Rockefeller, Levin, and Durbin ===
Senators John D. Rockefeller (D-WV) (the Committee's vice-chairman), Carl Levin (D-MI), and Richard Durbin (D-IL), used their additional view to say that the report painted an incomplete picture, because the Committee had put off until phase two of the investigation the key question of "how intelligence on Iraq was used or misused by Administration officials in public statements and reports." Because of this, they said, "the Committee's phase one report fails to fully explain the environment of intense pressure in which Intelligence Community officials were asked to render judgments on matters relating to Iraq when policy officials had already forcefully stated their own conclusions in public."

=== Senators Chambliss, Hatch, Lott, Hagel, and Bond ===
The third additional view in the report is by Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), with Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Trent Lott (R-MS), Chuck Hagel (R-NE), and Christopher Bond (R-MO). It focuses on the issues of information sharing and Human Intelligence (HUMINT), and rebuts the allegation of "pressure" contained in the additional view by Senators Rockefeller, Levin, and Durbin.

=== Other additional views ===
Senator Olympia Snow (R-ME) wrote in her additional view that the Committee's report revealed poor management and a lack of accountability in the intelligence community, and she called for strong reforms.

Senator John Warner (R-VA) used his additional view to defend the integrity and professionalism of front-line intelligence analysts, and to emphasize that "there was no evidence that anyone involved in reaching intelligence judgments for this NIE was subjected to any pressure from their superiors or from policymakers to alter any of their judgments or analyses."

The additional view by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), was critical of the Bush administration, saying it "did not fairly represent the intelligence."

Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) was also critical of the Bush administration in his additional view, giving a list of public statements by senior members of the administration that misstated and exaggerated the underlying intelligence on Iraq.

Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL) focused on the need for greater accountability for the intelligence failures identified in the report.

Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) used her additional view to argue for a number of specific structural and procedural reforms in the intelligence community.

== "Phase two" of the investigation ==
At the time of the report's release (July 9, 2004), Democratic members of the committee [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38650-2004Jul9.html expressed the hope] that "phase two" of the investigation, which was to include an assessment of how the Iraqi WMD intelligence was used by senior policymakers, would be completed quickly. Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS) said of phase two, "It is a priority. I made my commitment and it will get done."

On March 10, 2005, during a [http://www.washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20050310-060505-9514r.htm question-and-answer session] after a speech he had given at the Woodrow Wilson Center, Senator Roberts said of the failure to complete phase two, "[T]hat is basically on the back burner." Senator John D. Rockefeller (D-WV), vice chairman of the Committee, made a statement later that day in which he said, "The Chairman agreed to this investigation and I fully expect him to fulfill his commitment.... While the completion of phase two is long overdue, the committee has continued this important work, and I expect that we will finish the review in the very near future."

In a statement regarding the release of the report of the [[Iraq Intelligence Commission|presidential WMD commission]] on March 31, 2005, Senator Roberts [http://intelligence.senate.gov/050331.htm wrote], "I don't think there should be any doubt that we have now heard it all regarding prewar intelligence. I think that it would be a monumental waste of time to replow this ground any further."

On April 10, 2005, Senators Roberts and Rockefeller appeared together on NBC's [http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7452510/ Meet the Press] program. In response to a question about the completion of phase two of the investigation, Roberts said, "I'm perfectly willing to do it, and that's what we agreed to do, and that door is still open.  And I don't want to quarrel with Jay, because we both agreed that we would get it done.  But we do have--we have Ambassador Negroponte next week, we have General Mike Hayden next week.  We have other hot-spot hearings or other things going on that are very important."

Moderator Tim Russert then asked Senator Rockefeller if he believed phase two would be completed, and he replied, "I hope so. Pat and I have agreed to do it. We've shaken hands on it, and we agreed to do it after the elections so it wouldn't be any sort of sense of a political attack. I mean that was my view; it shouldn't be viewed that way."

On August 2, 2005, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) released the text of a [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718042410/http://feinstein.senate.gov/05releases/r-intel-robrts.htm letter] she had sent to Senator Roberts, saying, in part, "I am increasingly dismayed by the delay in completing the Committee's 'Phase II' investigation into intelligence prior to the Iraq War.... I stand ready to participate in this investigation in any way possible."

On November 1, 2005, Senator Harry Reid (D-NV), the Senate minority leader, invoked a seldom-used provision of the Senate rules to place the body in a closed session. During a three-and-a-half hour discussion, agreement was reached on the creation of a six-member Senate panel to report by November 14 on "the intelligence committee's progress of the phase two review of the prewar intelligence and its schedule for completion."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/01/AR2005110101037.html GOP Angered by Closed Senate Session]. Washingtonpost.com (2005-11-02). Retrieved on 2013-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 2006, an article by journalist Alexander Bolton in the Congressional journal ''The Hill'' reported that Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS) was seeking to further divide the phase two report. Under Roberts' new approach, the following components of the report would be released relatively quickly: pre-war intelligence assessments of post-war Iraq, postwar findings in Iraq regarding WMD and ties to terrorism, and the use by US intelligence of information supplied by the Iraqi National Congress. Two components of the report would be delayed: whether public statements before the war by senior government officials were supported by the underlying intelligence, and the role played by the Department of Defense's Office of Special Plans in developing the prewar intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hillnews.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/042506/news4.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513050245/http://www.hillnews.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/042506/news4.html |date=May 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A September 7, 2006, article by journalist Jonathon Weisman in the ''Washington Post'' reported that the part of the phase two report comparing the Bush administration's public statements about Saddam Hussein with the evidence senior officials reviewed in private would not be released before the November 2006 election.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/06/AR2006090601920.html Panel Set to Release Just Part of Report On Run-Up to War]. Washingtonpost.com (2006-09-07). Retrieved on 2013-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two volumes of the phase II report were released on September 8, 2006: "[https://web.archive.org/web/20060921074629/http://intelligence.senate.gov/phaseiiaccuracy.pdf Postwar Findings about Iraq's WMD Programs and Links to Terrorism and How they Compare with Prewar Assessments]" and "[https://web.archive.org/web/20060921074654/http://intelligence.senate.gov/phaseiiinc.pdf The Use by the Intelligence Community of Information Provided by the Iraqi National Congress]."

After Democrats gained a majority in the Senate during the 2006 midterm election, chairmanship of the committee passed to Sen. [[Jay Rockefeller]] (D-WV). The former chair, Sen. [[Pat Roberts]] (R-KS) left the committee; the ranking Republican and vice chairman of the committee is now Sen. [[Kit Bond]] (R-MO).

On May 25, 2007, the committee released a volume of the phase II report titled, "[http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/prewar.pdf Prewar Intelligence Assessments About Postwar Iraq]". This volume of the report includes seven pages of conclusions regarding assessments provided by the intelligence community to U.S. government leaders prior to the Iraq war. The report concludes that the intelligence community had assessed that establishing a stable government in Iraq would be a "long, difficult, and probably turbulent challenge," that Iraqi society was deeply divided and would engage in violent conflict unless an occupying power took steps to prevent it, and that the war would increase the threat of terrorism, at least temporarily. The intelligence community also assessed that a U.S. defeat and occupation of Iraq would lead to a surge in political Islam and increased funding for terrorist groups, and that the war would not cause other countries in the region to abandon their WMD programs.

This volume of the report includes an appendix containing two previously classified reports by the National Intelligence Council (NIC) titled, "Regional Consequences of Regime Change in Iraq" and "Principal Challenges in Post-Saddam Iraq", as well as a long list of recipients within the government of NIC assessments on Iraq. The appendix also contains a number of "Additional Views" in which different members of the committee comment on the history of the committee's work in this area, and criticize what they characterize as the politicization of that work by members of the other party.

Phase II of the report was publicly released on Thursday June 5, 2008 [https://web.archive.org/web/20080611232451/http://intelligence.senate.gov/080605/phase2a.pdf whether statements by US Government officials were substantiated by intelligence reports].

This was a bi-partisan majority report (10-5) and "details inappropriate, sensitive intelligence activities conducted by the DoD's Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, without the knowledge of the Intelligence Community or the State Department." It concludes that the US Administration "repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated, contradicted, or even non-existent.  As a result, the American people were led to believe that the threat from Iraq was much greater than actually existed." These included President Bush's statements of a partnership between Iraq and Al Qa'ida, that Saddam Hussein was preparing to give weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups, and Iraq's capability to produce chemical weapons.

The Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Sen.[[Jay Rockefeller]], stated in [http://intelligence.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=298775 press release of report's publication]"It is my belief that the Bush Administration was fixated on Iraq, and used the 9/11 attacks by al Qa'ida as justification for overthrowing Saddam Hussein. To accomplish this, top Administration officials made repeated statements that falsely linked Iraq and al Qa'ida as a single threat and insinuated that Iraq played a role in 9/11.   Sadly, the Bush Administration led the nation into war under false pretenses. While the report highlights many of the problems with the intelligence and criticizes the Bush Administration for its handling of the lead up to the war and its reasons for doing so, the report also supports in many cases that claims made by the Bush Administration about Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction programs were "generally substantiated by the intelligence".

"There is no question we all relied on flawed intelligence.  But, there is a fundamental difference between relying on incorrect intelligence and deliberately painting a picture to the American people that you know is not fully accurate."

The Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Sen.[[Jay Rockefeller]] twice alleged that the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, or its former head [[Douglas Feith]] may have engaged in unlawful activities,&lt;ref name="senate1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://intelligence.senate.gov/080605/phase2b.pdf|title=Senate Report on Intelligence Activities Relating To Iraq Conducted By The Policy of Counterterrorism Evaluation Group and the Office of Special Plans Within The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611232445/http://intelligence.senate.gov/080605/phase2b.pdf|archivedate=2008-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase II of the report ''"found nothing to substantiate that claim; nothing unlawful about the "alleged" rogue intelligence operation in the PCTEG , nothing unlawful about the Office of Special Plans, and nothing unlawful about the so-called failure to inform Congress of alleged intelligence activities."''&lt;ref name="senate1"/&gt; The previous year, the chairman released a press statement claiming that it appeared that the office's were "not in compliance with the law."&lt;ref name="senate1"/&gt; Yet, rather than pursue these allegations, Rockfeller decided to pursue an issue unrelated to the intelligence, and unrelated to Iraq.&lt;ref name="senate1"/&gt; He pursued and inquiry of an exploratory meeting held in Rome in 2001 between two DOD officials and two Iranians.&lt;ref name="senate1"/&gt; Writing for the Minority Opinion as part of the report it was stated that ''"After four years of making unsubstantiated allegations of unlawful activities, the calculus appears to be that proclamations of "inappropriate" behavior will generate the desired headlines focusing only on the caustic words, rather than the lack of substance behind them. We hope that these additional views will help redirect that focus to the evidence, or lack thereof."''&lt;ref name="senate1"/&gt;

Despite House Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]]'s telling her caucus members "that impeachment is off the table; she is not interested in pursuing it,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/11/AR2006051101950.html

'''''The Governator''''' was a planned superhero franchise for children developed and produced by [[Stan Lee]] and co-developed with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].&lt;ref name=ew&gt;{{cite news|last1=Svetkey|first1=Benjamin|title=Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as 'The Governator'|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2011/03/30/arnold-schwarzenegger-the-governator-exclusive|accessdate=March 25, 2015|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Governator'' featured a fictionalized Schwarzenegger who after stepping down from his role as [[Governor of California]] became a superhero in order to fight crime. His real-life family and Brentwood home would have fictional counterparts with the home having an Arnold Cave under it as a base of operations. To assist in crime fighting, the cave would have high tech vehicles, super suits, gym and a group of sidekicks. One sidekick is his cyber security expert, Zeke Muckerberg, a teenage computer genius. The Govenator would go up against G.I.R.L.I.E. Men (Gangsters Imposters Racketeers Liars &amp; Irredeemable Ex-cons), his recurring supervillains.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; A recurring character shown in the trailer is an investigative reporter, voiced by [[Larry King]].&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

'''Tolkienmoot''' (also advertised as '''Tolkien Moot''' and '''TolkienMoot''' ([[camel case]])) originally began under the name of [[Merpcon]] in 2005. Always a convention focused on J.R.R. Tolkien and gaming in Middle-earth, as the venue expanded to include a broader array of game systems, guest speakers, and special events, it was decided to change the title to Tolkienmoot in 2009. The convention was founded, and continuous to be funded and run by Hawke Robinson,&lt;ref&gt;[https://ewu.academia.edu/HawkeRobinson Profile page and papers for Hawke Robinson]&lt;/ref&gt; founder of the Inland Empire Eä Tolkien Society&lt;ref&gt;[http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Inland_Northwest_Tolkien_Society Inland Northwest Tolkien Society]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sffandom.wordpress.com/2009/10/16/tolkien-society-smial-meets-in-spokane-wa-on-2nd-saturdays/ SF Fandom information about related Tolkien Smial]&lt;/ref&gt; an official Smial of the U.K. Tolkien Society, [[RPG Research]], [[Other Minds Magazine]], [[Middle-earth Radio]], [[Middle-earth Talk]], [[Eä RPG]], and other endeavours, as well as an active member of [[CAR-PGa]] (Committee for the Advancement of Role-Playing Games website), [[WSTRA]] (Washington State Therapeutic Recreation Association website), and others.

Tolkienmoot is a convention dedicated to fans of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth and beyond (Numenor, Arda, and all of Eä), with an emphasis on role-playing games using this setting. The event is held annually, usually during the summer months, in Spokane, Washington, USA, typically spanning from 3 to 5 days.

To date the convention remains open and free to the public, but has limited seating, so generally provides a first-come, first-served, RSVP system, though walk-ins are welcome, and plenty of seating is available for the guest speaker session, participants cannot be guaranteed a seat to participate in the games without a reservation in advance.

The first event began with MerpCon I in 2005, transitioning to Tolkienmoot in 2009, and continuing each year. As of 2015, Tolkien Moot takes place annually for 3+ days on the third weekend of July.

==Event details==
The event is focused on J.R.R. Tolkien and his works, with a special emphasis on gaming, especially tabletop paper and dice [[Role playing games]], using any role playing game system adapted or created for play in Middle-earth or any aspect of Tolkien's universe (Middle-earth, Endor, [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] or [[Eä]] depending on how broadly one's perspective is regarding the related works).

During the event, the Tolkienmoot website also enables remote participation, by providing the live webcams, streaming audio and video, and live real time chat rooms (using [[Internet Relay Chat]]), Skype, Google+ and similar technologies, interacting with the games, and especially with guest speakers by submitting questions and answers, in a very interactive format.

===Special Guests===
A number of MerpCon / Tolkienmoot guest speakers have been at each event, including noted Tolkien scholars, doctors, professors, and published authors.

"Hobbit Enthusiasts Converge on Spokane."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prlog.org/10850420-hobbit-enthusiasts-converge-on-spokane-august-13-15-for-tolkien-moot.html Hobbit enthusiasts converge on Spokane August 13-15 for Tolkien Moot]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkienmoot VII (2011) will also be held July 15–17 in Spokane, WA, USA, and simulcast online with participants engaged through real time chat, streaming audio, and streaming video. 2011 will be a smaller convention than previously as resources are being dedicated to a larger MerpCon/Tolkienmoot in 2012 attempting to take the convention to "the next level" further expanding the venue, but always keeping the root gaming in Tolkien-inspired settings.
The paper "Tolkien's Love of Trees and the Envirohnment" was first read and discussed at this moot, and later also read and discussed by the U.K. Tolkien Society at their annual Seminar series.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268239877_J.R.R._Tolkiens_Love_of_Trees_and_the_Environment_revised_the_U.K._Tolkien_Society This paper originally presented at Tolkien Moot and revised for U.K. Tolkien Society Seminar 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Theme for Tolkienmoot 2011 was "Trees".
The special broadcast guest speaker and talk show segments will be earlier  in the day so that more online participants from Europe and elsewhere will not have to be up at 2:00 am their time to participate.

TolkienMoot VIII (2012) held July 13–15.
The theme was "Hobbits".

Theme: No theme this year, each Game Master created their own campaign and characters.

Live-Action Role-Playing in Middle-earth:

Some of the campaigns over the years have been released incrementally with issues of [[Other Minds Magazine]], or on the Ea RPG website, the website also has a section dedicated to the Númenor Project.

Both on site and online attendance numbers have continued to increase over each year.

Different approaches to the guest speaker segments have been used. The opening speaking session is typically presented by the convention founder, with a "state of the union" discussion about the current state of Tolkien fandom, role-playing gaming community &amp; industry, and the RPG Research project updates. Other sessions have sometimes been in a format called "Raw Hobbit", hosted by Tolkien essayist and author [[Michael Martinez]] as an homage to [[William Shatner]]'s [[Shatner's Raw Nerve|Raw Nerve]] talk show. Other sessions have included the interactive "Tolkien Youth Panel", while still other sessions generally include notable guest speakers (see list) with local and online audience participation in follow-up Q&amp;A. The final sessions often overlap with episodes of [[Middle-earth Talk Radio]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middle-earthradio.com/talk-show The Middle-earth Radio Talk Show Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822202208/http://www.middle-earthradio.com/talk-show |date=2009-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a live broadcast from the third day of the event with live audience participation both locally and online.

The founders of Tolkienmoot are also the founders of an official [[smial]] of the U.K. [[Tolkien Society]], known as the [[Eä Tolkien Society]] based in Spokane, WA, USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tolkienscholars.org  The Eä Tolkien Society Smial Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role Playing Game Systems==
Tolkienmoot has always been intended to support multiple game systems set in Middle-earth (and beyond).

There are several other role playing gaming systems that have been under independent unofficial development and/or release for several years now, including:
* [[Ambarquenta]]
* [[Hitherlands]]
* [[Eä d20]]
* [[Eä RPGS]]

There are many projects that have adapted existing game systems to better fit into Middle-earth ranging from the early years of [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]], [[GURPS]], and [[Runequest]], to other systems that many claim are already meant indirectly for Middle-earth gaming, such as [[Harnmaster]].  Luke Crane's [[Burning Wheel]] system is reputedly also fitting for role playing in Middle Earth.  The system includes rules for playing non-humanoid creatures that were nonetheless given an (often maligned) intellect within the professor's universe such as Wolves and Great Spiders.

Tolkienmoot supports many role-playing game systems due to multiple game masters and a greater variety of participants' gaming background interests. A lot of the renewed interest may be due to the earlier releases of [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]], causing a revival of interest in role playing in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], and the current releases of PJ's [[The Hobbit]] movies.

Game systems now supported include:
* [[Adventures in Middle-earth]] ([[AiMe]]) - Official licensed [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] 5th Edition role-playing game in Middle-earth, combining The One Ring RPG with the d20 5e system.
* [[Cubicle7]]'s TOR RPG - [[The One Ring Roleplaying Game]] released 2011.
* [[Eä d20]] - Eä d20 Website (adaptation of [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] 3.5 and AD&amp;D 1st Editions to Middle-earth).
* [[Iron Crown Enterprises]]'s Middle-earth Role-playing - [[MERP]] - 2nd Edition.
* [[Decipher, Inc..]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]].
* [[Iron Crown Enterprises]]'s [[Rolemaster]] (adapted to Middle-earth).
* [[Iron Crown Enterprises]]'s [[High Adventure Role Playing|HARP]] (adapted to Middle-earth).
* [[Wizards of the Coast]]'s [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] [[d20 System|d20]] Version 3.5 (adaptation known as "[[Eä d20]]").
* [[Runequest]] the newly released revival of this system (adapted to Middle-earth).
* [[Basic Role Playing]] system adapted to Middle-earth.
* [[GURPS]] adapted to Middle-earth.
* [[Harnmaster]] tweaked for Middle-earth.
* [[Eä RPG]] Basic Rules (no in beta game testing, and used at the event).
* [[Eä RPG]] Standard Rules (now in alpha game testing, and soon to be used at the event).
* [[Savage Worlds]] RPG adapted to Middle-earth.

==Related Events==
So far Tolkienmoot is the only regular convention dedicated primarily or exclusively to role-playing gaming in J.R.R. Tolkien's world. There are a few other [[gaming conventions]] past, present, and planned in the near future that sometimes host a role-playing gaming session with a campaign set in Middle-earth in their events, usually just a room or small area.

The other conventions that have some Tolkien related gaming may sometimes include:

The '''Tramlines Festival''' is an annual music festival held in [[Sheffield]].&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tramlines.org.uk/frequently-asked-questions/ |title=Tramlines Frequently Asked Questions |work=Tramlines Festival |accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was originally free to attend, but now requires tickets. The line-up consists of national and local artists. The festival is curated and organised by a panel comprising local venue owners, promoters and volunteers.&lt;ref name="clash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/tramlines-festival-returns|title=Tramlines Festival Returns|work=ClashMusic|date=13 May 2010|accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the festival is inspired by the city's [[Sheffield Supertram|tram network]]. Tramlines held its first festival in 2009, which attracted 35,000 fans and was seen as a huge success, and 2010's event doubled that figure. The success of Tramlines Festival 2011 led to the event winning 'Best Metropolitan Festival' at the [[UK Festival Awards]].&lt;ref name="award2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festivalawards.com/latest/and-the-winners-are/|work=festival awards|title=…And the winners are…!|accessdate=7 March 2012|date=November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305210852/http://www.festivalawards.com/latest/and-the-winners-are/|archivedate=5 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venues==
The festival took place at over 70 venues and 4 main stages in the city centre, including Devonshire Green, [[The Leadmill]], The Viper Rooms, The Fat Cat, [[O2 Academy Sheffield]], [[Barkers Pool]], [[The University of Sheffield]], The Harley, The Bowery, the [[Peace Gardens]], Yellow Arch and the main stage at Ponderosa Park with a capacity of 8,000 until 2017. In January 2018 it was announced that the festival would be moving out of the city centre to a new venue in [[Hillsborough Park]], Sheffield and would consist of four stages including a main stage and that the new venue will allow the capacity at the main stage to be around 40,000.

==Festivals==

===2009===
Tramlines held its first festival in 2009. Notable artists such as [[Rolo Tomassi]], [[Just Jack]], [[Toddla T]], [[Pixie Lott]], [[Little Boots]], [[Example (rapper)|Example]], [[The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster]], [[The XX]] and [[Reverend and the Makers]], who headlined, played at the festival. The festival was a huge success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/headlines/Music-City-festival-39Sheffield-at.5498653.jp|title=Music City festival 'Sheffield at its best'|work=The Star|date=28 July 2009|accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; attracting 35,000 fans.&lt;ref name="echo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/headlines/Sheffield-Tramlines-back-on-track.6291743.jp|title=Sheffield Tramlines back on track with Echo and the Bunnymen|work=The Star|date=13 May 2010|accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organizers, as well as councillors and Sheffielders, praised the festival. The festivals popularity, along with positive reviews, led to the 2010 event being announced. The festival-goers had to queue to get wristbands, which gave them access to the different stages.

2009's festival recycled 400 litres of paper, 2080 litres of plastic and 560 litres of aluminium in the outdoor venues alone.&lt;ref name="main" /&gt; This led to an environmental campaign in 2010 in which the festival seeks to reduce its environmental impact.

===2010===
Tramlines Festival 2010 was held from 23 to 25 July.&lt;ref name="main" /&gt; 250 artists performed, and several venues were added, including [[Octagon Centre|Sheffield University's Octagon Centre]], [[Tudor Square]], [[The Leadmill]], [[O2 Academy Sheffield]], [[Sheffield Winter Garden|Winter Gardens]] and the main stage at [[Devonshire Green]] increased in capacity from 5,000 to 8,000. Headliners were [[Echo and the Bunnymen]], [[Mystery Jets]], [[Simian Mobile Disco]] DJ set, [[Professor Green]], [[Tinchy Stryder]], [[Future of the Left]], [[Darwin Deez]], [[Macka B]], [[The King Blues]], [[The Hoosiers]], [[Craig David]], [[Dum Dum Girls]], [[Annie Mac]] and [[Toddla T]].

The festival remained free, and the wristband system was scrapped, replaced with a first-come-first-served [[turnstile]] system. The festival attracted 65,000 people.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;&lt;ref name="efest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efestivals.co.uk/festivals/tramlines/2010/|work=efestivals|title=Tramlines '10|accessdate=7 July 2010|date=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; New events at the 2010 festival included a Youth Music Festival, Blues trail and a [[Ceilidh]].&lt;ref name="efest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mainthree"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tramlines.org.uk/page/3/|title=Tramlines Home Page, Page 3|accessdate=7 July 2010|work=Tramlines festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival also focussed on reducing its environmental impact in 2010. This pledge included a solar powered headphone disco on Devonshire Green, major recycling areas at all of the outdoor stages, and cheap accommodation via [[Unite Group|Unite]].&lt;ref name="main"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tramlines.org.uk/|title=Tramlines Home Page|work=Tramlines Festival|accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately twenty [[tropical cyclone]]s enter the [[Philippine Area of Responsibility]] yearly, an area which incorporates parts of the [[Pacific Ocean]], [[South China Sea]] and the Philippine Archipelago (with the exception of [[Tawi-Tawi]] province). Among these cyclones, ten will be typhoons, with five having the potential to be destructive ones.&lt;ref name="RapplerMar2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=de la Cruz|first1=Gwen|title=IN NUMBERS: Typhoons in the Philippines and the 2016 polls|url=http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/126001-typhoons-enter-philippines-fast-facts|accessdate=12 April 2017|work=Rappler|date=March 19, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Philippines is "the most exposed country in the world to tropical storms" according to a [[Time Magazine]] article in 2013.&lt;ref name="TimeNov2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Sophie|title=The Philippines Is the Most Storm-Exposed Country on Earth|url=http://world.time.com/2013/11/11/the-philippines-is-the-most-storm-exposed-country-on-earth/|accessdate=12 April 2017|work=Time|date=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Philippine languages]], [[typhoon]]s are called ''bagyo''.&lt;ref name="bag"&gt;Glossary of Meteorology. 
[http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Baguio Baguio.] Retrieved on 2008-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typhoons can hit the Philippines any time of year, with the months of June to September being most active, with August being the most active individual month and May the least active.  Typhoons move east to west across the country, heading north as they go.  Storms most frequently make landfall on the islands of [[Eastern Visayas]], [[Bicol region]], and northern [[Luzon]]&lt;ref name="TimeNov2013" /&gt; whereas the southern island and region of [[Mindanao]] is largely free of typhoons.

The deadliest overall tropical cyclone to impact the Philippines is believed to have been the [[1881 Haiphong typhoon|Haiphong typhoon]] which is estimated to have killed up to 20,000 people as it passed over the country in September 1881. In modern meteorological records, the deadliest storm was [[Typhoon Haiyan|Typhoon Yolanda]] (international name Haiyan), which became the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone ever recorded as it crossed the [[Visayas]] in central Philippines on November 7–8, 2013. The wettest known tropical cyclone to impact the [[archipelago]] was the July 14–18, 1911 [[cyclone]] which dropped over {{convert|2210|mm|in}} of rainfall within a 3-day, 15-hour period in [[Baguio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Meteorological Organization Operational Hydrology Report No. 1: Manual For Estimation of Probable Maximum Precipitation|author=J. L. H. Paulhaus|publisher=[[World Meteorological Organization]]|year=1973|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical cyclones usually account for at least 30&amp;nbsp;percent of the annual rainfall in the northern Philippines while being responsible for less than 10&amp;nbsp;percent of the annual rainfall in the southern islands.  PAGASA Senior Weather Specialist Anthony Lucero told the newsite [[Rappler]] that the number of destructive typhoons have increased recently but it is too early to call it a trend.&lt;ref name="RapplerMar2016" /&gt;

Tropical cyclones entering the [[Philippine Area of Responsibility]] are given a local name by the [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] (PAGASA), which also raises public storm signal warnings as deemed necessary.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ B2"&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division | title = Frequently Asked Questions: What are the upcoming tropical cyclone names? | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] | accessdate = 2006-12-11 | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/B2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pagasa&gt;Republic of the Philippines.

[http://www.gov.ph/laginghanda/the-philippine-public-storm-warning-signals/ The Modified Philippine Public Storm Warning Signals]. Retrieved November 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preparation and response to typhoons is coordinated by the [[National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council]] (NDRRMC). Each [[Philippine province]] and [[local government in the Philippines]] has a corresponding [[Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office]] (DRRMO).  Each provincial and local government is required to set aside 5% of its yearly budget for disaster  risk reduction, preparations, and response.&lt;ref name="RapplerMar2016" /&gt;

The frequency of typhoons in the Philippines have made the typhoons a significant part of everyday ancient and modern Filipino culture.&lt;ref name="TimeNov2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Sophie|title=The Philippines Is the Most Storm-Exposed Country on Earth|url=http://world.time.com/2013/11/11/the-philippines-is-the-most-storm-exposed-country-on-earth/|accessdate=12 April 2017|work=Time|date=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Bagyo'' (sometimes spelled ''bagyu'') is the word for "typhoon" or "storm" in most [[Philippine languages]], including [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Visayan languages|Visayan]], [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], [[Bicol language|Bicolano]], [[Hanunó'o language|Hanunó'o]], [[Aklanon language|Aklanon]], and [[Pangasinan language |Pangasinan]]. It is derived from [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]] *baRiuS, meaning "typhoon". [[Cognate]]s in other [[Austronesian languages]] include [[Sama language|Sama]] ''baliw'' ("wind"), [[Amis people|Amis]] ''faliyos'' or ''farios'' ("typhoon"); [[Saisiyat language|Saisiyat]] ''balosh'' ("typhoon"), [[Babuza people|Babuza]] ''bayus'' ("storm"), [[Puyuma people|Puyuma]] ''variw'', [[Bintulu]] ''bauy'' ("wind"), [[Kelabit people|Kelabit]] ''bariw'' ("storm wind"), and [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]] ''pakyo'' ("typhoon").&lt;ref name="truss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trussel2.com/acd/acd-s_b.htm#25175|title=*baRiuS|author=Robert Blust &amp; Stephen Trussel |date=2010|publisher=Austronesian Comparative Dictionary|accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storm naming conventions: local and international names==
The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] in Honolulu started monitoring and naming storms in the Western Pacific region in [[1945 Pacific typhoon season|1945]], originally using female names in English alphabetical order. That list was revised in [[1979 Pacific typhoon season|1979]] by introducing male names to be used in alternation with the female names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.typhoon2000.ph/names2.htm|title=Names|last=Padua|first=David Michael|date=|website=Typhoon2000|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippine Weather Bureau started naming storms within their area of responsibility in 1963, using female Filipino names ending in ng in native alphabetical order. The Bureau continued to monitor typhoons until the agency's abolition in 1972, after which its duties were transferred to the newly-established [[PAGASA]]. This often resulted in a Western Pacific cyclone carrying two names: an international name and a local name generally used within the Philippines. This two-name scheme is still followed today.

Beginning in [[2000 Pacific typhoon season|2000]], cyclone monitoring duties in the Western Pacific were transferred from the JTWC to the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]], the [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center|RSMC]] of the [[World Meteorological Organization]]. The international naming scheme of the typhoons was replaced with a sequential list of names contributed by 14 nations in the region, including the Philippines. The new scheme largely uses terms for local features of the contributing nation, such as animals, plants, foods and adjectives in the native language. The rotation of names is based on the alphabetical order of the contributing nations. The Philippines, however, would maintain its own naming scheme for its local forecasts. In [[2001 Pacific typhoon season|2001]], PAGASA revised its naming scheme to contain longer annual lists with a more mixed set of names.

Currently, the JMA and PAGASA each assign names to typhoons that form within or enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility. The JMA naming scheme for international use contains 140 names described above. The list is not restricted by year; the first name to be used in a typhoon season is the name after the last-named cyclone of the preceding season. The PAGASA naming scheme for Philippine use contains four lists, each containing twenty-five names arranged in alphabetical order. Every typhoon season begins with the first name in the assigned list, and the rolls of names are each reused every four years. An auxiliary list of ten names is used when the main list in a year had been exhausted. Not all Western Pacific cyclones are given names by both weather agencies, as JMA does not name tropical depressions, and PAGASA does not name cyclones outside the Philippine Area of Responsibility.

In the case of both weather agencies, [[List of retired Pacific typhoon names|names are retired]] when a typhoon carrying it caused severe or costly damage and loss of life. Retirement is decided by the agencies' committees, although [[List of retired Philippine typhoon names|in PAGASA's case]], names are routinely retired when the cyclone caused at least 300 deaths or ₱1 billion in damage in the Philippines. Retired names are replaced with another name for the next rotation, for JMA by the nation that submitted the retired name, and for PAGASA with a name sharing the same first letter as the retired name.

==Variability in activity==
On an annual time scale, activity reaches a minimum in May, before increasing steadily to June, and spiking from July to September, with August being the most active month for tropical cyclones in the Philippines. Activity reduces significantly in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.typhoon2000.ph/stormstats/PhilippineTyphoons1566-1900.pdf|title=Typhoons in the Philippine Islands, 1566-1900|author=Ricardo García-Herrera, Pedro Ribera, Emiliano Hernández and Luis Gimeno|publisher=David V. Padua|page=40|date=2003-09-26|accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most active season, since 1945, for tropical cyclone strikes on the island archipelago was [[1993 Pacific typhoon season|1993]] when nineteen tropical cyclones moved through the country (though there were 36 storms that were named by PAGASA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]|year=2009|url=http://www.typhooncommittee.org/41st/docs/TC2_MemberReport2008_PHILIPPINES1.pdf|title=Member Report Republic of the Philippines|work=[[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]]|publisher=[[World Meteorological Organization]]|accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was only one tropical cyclone which moved through the Philippines in [[1958 Pacific typhoon season|1958]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]|year=1959|title=1958|publisher=[[United States Navy]]|accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most frequently impacted areas of the Philippines by tropical cyclones are northern Luzon and eastern Visayas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Colleen A.

==Tropical Cyclone Warning Signals==
{{Philippine Tropical Cyclone Signals}}
The [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] (PAGASA) releases tropical cyclone warnings in the form of Tropical Cyclone Warning Signals.&lt;ref name=pagasa/&gt; An area having a storm signal may be under:
*TCWS #1 - Tropical cyclone winds of {{convert|30|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} to {{convert|60|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} are expected within the next 36&amp;nbsp;hours. (Note: If a tropical cyclone forms very close to the area, then a shorter lead time is seen on the warning bulletin.)
*TCWS #2 - Tropical cyclone winds of {{convert|61|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} to {{convert|120|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} are expected within the next 24&amp;nbsp;hours.
*TCWS #3 - Tropical cyclone winds of {{convert|121|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} to {{convert|170|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} are expected within the next 18&amp;nbsp;hours.
*TCWS #4 - Tropical cyclone winds of {{convert|171|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} to {{convert|220|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} are expected within 12&amp;nbsp;hours.
*TCWS #5 - Tropical cyclone winds greater than {{convert|220|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} are expected within 12&amp;nbsp;hours.

These Tropical Cyclone Warning Signals are usually raised when an area (in the Philippines only) is about to be hit by a tropical cyclone.  As a tropical cyclone gains strength and/or gets nearer to an area having a storm signal, the warning may be upgraded to a higher one in that particular area (e.g. a signal No. 1 warning for an area may be increased to signal #3).  Conversely, as a tropical cyclone weakens and/or gets farther to an area, it may be downgraded to a lower signal or may be lifted (that is, an area will have no storm signal).

Classes for Preschool are canceled when Signal No. 1 is in effect. Elementary and High School classes and below are cancelled under Signal No. 2 and classes for Colleges and Universities and below are cancelled under Signal Nos. 3, 4 and 5.

'''Zahurul Haq''' (9 February 1935 –  15 February 1969) was a [[Pakistan Air Force]] sergeant. He was one of the 35 persons accused in the [[Agartala Conspiracy Case]] in 1968. He was killed in custody and his death led to increase in [[1969 uprising in East Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=bpedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Islam |first=Sirajul |year=2012 |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]|chapter=Haq, Zahurul|chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Haq,_Zahurul |editor2-last= Rahman |editor2-first=S M Mahfuzur}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[Independence Day Award]] from the [[Government of Bangladesh]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/country/2-more-named-bangladesh-independence-day-award-2018-1550902|title=2 more named for Independence Award|date=2018-03-20|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-08-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Haq was born on 9 February 1935 in Sonapur, Sudharam (now [[Noakhali Sadar Upazila]]), [[Noakhali District|Noakhali]]. He completed his matriculation from [[Noakhali Zilla School]] in 1953 and intermediate from [[Jagannath College]].&lt;ref name=bpedia/&gt;

==Agartala Conspiracy Case==
In 1956, Haq joined [[Pakistan Air Force]] in 1956 and reached the rank of a sergeant. He was arrested in December 1967 in accusation of a conspiracy to cause an uprising in [[East Pakistan]] with the intention of bringing about the secession of the province from the rest of Pakistan. He was confined in [[Dhaka Central Jail]] and later, was transferred to [[Dhaka Cantonment]] in Kurmitola. In January 1968, Awami League leader [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]]'s name was added to the case.&lt;ref name=observer&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.observerbd.com/2015/02/15/72658.php|title=Sergeant Zahurul Haque dies|date=15 February 2015|accessdate=14 September 2017|newspaper=The Daily Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special tribunal was set headed by a West Pakistani Justice [[S. A. Rahman]], with two other Bengali judges Justice Mujibur Rahman Khan and Justice [[Maksum-ul-Hakim]].&lt;ref name=observer/&gt; [[Barrister Abul Khair Khan]] served on the legal panel in this Agartala Conspiracy Case as a lawyer for Sergeant Zahurul Haq&lt;ref&gt;http://epaper.thedailystar.net/index.php?opt=view&amp;page=1&amp;date=2018-08-31&lt;/ref&gt;. The final date for the case was set to 6 February 1969 and the date was deferred later.&lt;ref name=bpedia/&gt; On 15 February 1969, he was shot by a Pakistani [[Havildar]]. He was taken to the Combined Military Hospital and died at around 10 pm.&lt;ref name=bpedia/&gt;

==Legacy==
Haq's death led to more street protests and state guest house and other government buildings were burned down which led to the withdrawal of the Agartala Conspiracy Case on 22 February 1969. ''"February 15 Bahini"'', the first armed force was formed and consisted of student leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flags through the ages|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/lifestyle/special-feature/flags-through-the-ages-187219|publisher=The Daily Star|accessdate=14 September 2017|date=15 December 2015|first=Afsin|last=Ahmed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haq was a painter. Some of his paintings are displayed in [[Bangladesh National Museum]]. Sergeant Zahurul Haq Hall of the [[University of Dhaka]] is named after him.&lt;ref name=bpedia /&gt; BAF Zahurul Haq base, a [[Bangladesh Air Force]] base is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Three BAF officials injured in copter crash at Ctg airport|publisher=Dhaka Tribune|url=http://archive.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2015/may/14/three-baf-officials-injured-copter-crash-ctg-airport|accessdate=14 September 2017|date=14 May 2015|first=Tarek|last=Mahmud|location=Chittagong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haq's eldest brother, [[Aminul Haq (Attorney General)|Aminul Haque]] (d. 1995) became the [[Attorney General of Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/city/death-anniversary-1252786|title=Death anniversary|date=13 July 2016|accessdate=14 September 2017|newspaper=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;
