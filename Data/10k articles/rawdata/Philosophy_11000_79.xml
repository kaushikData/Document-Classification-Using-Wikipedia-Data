'''Alexander N. Chumakov''' ({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Никола́евич Чумако́в}}; born on October 1, 1950) is a Russian [[philosopher]], [[theory|theoretician]] of [[science]], scientific community organizer, and [[Expert|specialist]] in the fields of [[philosophy]] and the theory of [[Global studies|globalistics]].

== Biography ==
Alexander N. Chumakov was born in 1950 to a fisherman's family of Severnoe village, Caspian District, [[Astrakhan Oblast|Astrakhan region]], [[USSR]]. In 1972, he graduated from an industrial, technical college in the city of [[Khadyzhensk]] in [[Krasnodar Krai]]. Between 1972 and 1975, he worked as a bore-hole drilling master in the nuclear testing areas in [[Semey|Semipalatinsk]] and [[Novaya Zemlya]]. In 1975, he was accepted into the preparatory division of the Department of Philosophy of [[Moscow State University|Moscow State University (MSU)]], from which he graduated [[cum laude]] in 1981. He also completed his postgraduate studies at MSU, receiving his [[Candidate of Sciences]] in 1984 and his [[Doktor nauk|Doctor of Sciences]] in 1991. Chumakov's doctoral dissertation was on the topic of "Social and Philosophical Aspects of Global Problems." Since 1990, Chumakov has been the leading research fellow and head of the group "Global Studies" at the Institute of [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name= reference1/&gt; He became a full professor in 1993, and since 2008, has worked as a professor of the Department of Global Processes at MSU. He currently teaches several specialized courses at the university, including a course entitled "Globalistics"&lt;ref name= reference2/&gt; (Глобалистика, "[[global studies]]"). Since 2009, Chumakov has also worked as the chair of the Department of Philosophy at the [[Finance University under the Government of the Russian Federation]].&lt;ref name= reference4/&gt;

== Scientific achievements ==

There are four main schools philosophical thought in post-Soviet Russia, namely, [[Marxism]], [[postmodernism]], liberal Orthodoxy, and [[globalism]]. Alexander Chumakov is the leading Russian spokesman for [[globalism]], which he writes "represents a secular stream of thought that aims to formulate a worldview transcending the division between Russia and the West by providing a new philosophical basis for their integration and ultimate unity."&lt;ref name= reference9/&gt; A book review of his book, ''Philosophy of Globalization'', writes that Chumakov "devoted his career in philosophy to the study of [[globalization]] and authored more than 550 scientific works and seven scholarly books that have been published in Russian, English, German, French, Chinese, Polish and Czech."&lt;ref name= reference8/&gt;

In his writings, Chumakov "formulated the fundamental principles, which constitute the philosophical foundation of globalistics as a special field of philosophical knowledge."&lt;ref name= reference6/&gt; His analysis of [[globalization]] reveals that it "represents an objective historical process and does not depend on the positive (or negative) intentions of separate countries or nations."&lt;ref name= reference7/&gt; It centers on the conceptual triad of [[culture]], [[civilization]], and [[globalization]], which in Chumakov's works "are analyzed as fundamental characteristics of various cultural civilizational systems, characteristics that are closely connected with each other."&lt;ref name= reference5/&gt; Chumakov argues that real and productive dialogue among different nations is possible because the universal character of civilization serves as the unifying factor for humanity, "while cultural diversity is the basis of differentiation of various countries and nations."&lt;ref name=reference12/&gt;

== Scientific organizing activity ==
Chumakov has devoted a great deal of time to administrative and organizational activities in the fields of [[philosophy]], [[culture]], and [[education]]. Since 1991 he has served as the first vice-president of the Russian Philosophical Society. He has also been a member of the Executive Committee of the International Association of Professors of Philosophy since 2012, as well as an acting member of the Presidium of Russian Ecological Academy since 2013.&lt;ref name= reference3/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Alexander N Chumakov at Songshan Forum.jpg|thumb|right|Presentation at the scholarly forum in China|400 px]] --&gt;

In 2003, Chumakov organized a philosophical action that had great cultural significance in [[Russia]] and was widely publicized by the Russian media.&lt;ref name= reference10/&gt; During the 1920s the Soviet government expelled hundreds of prominent Russian intellectuals from the newly created [[Soviet Union]], including many philosophers. Most of them were transported by boat to [[Germany]] and [[Turkey]]. In Russian [[historiography]], this event is known as the "[[philosophers' ships]]." Eighty years following the event, Chumakov organized a symbolic return of the "philosophers' ships" back to the motherland, which became open to freedom of expression and independent investigation of truth. To this end, he rented a ship, the Maria Ermolova, which sailed on route from [[Novorossiysk]] to [[Istanbul]] and back to [[Novorossiysk]] with hundreds of Russian philosophers on board to take part in the XXI World Congress of Philosophy in [[Istanbul]] in 2003.&lt;ref name= reference11/&gt;

Chumakov participated in the last six [[World Congress of Philosophy|World Congresses of Philosophy]], in [[Brighton]] in 1988, in [[Moscow]] in 1993, in [[Boston]] in 1998, in [[Istanbul]] in 2003, in [[Seoul]] in 2008, and in [[Athens]] in 2013. Throughout the events, he delivered scholarly presentations, including plenary addresses, and also served as chair of various roundtables, panels, and sections. Chumakov was also one of the initiators and main organizers of the Russian philosophical congresses that have taken place every three years, starting in 1997 and up to the latest in 2015, which took place in [[Ufa]].&lt;ref name= reference3/&gt;

== Honors and awards ==
Chumakov was named laureate in the 2003 Russian publishers' "Book of the Year" contest in the nomination category of "Encyclopedist". He was awarded for the publication of his international encyclopedia, ''Global Studies'', which had been published in Russian and English languages.

In 2004, he was also named laureate of the international award named after N. K. Ba'bakov, bestowed by the [http://www.ifpa.ru International Fuel and Power Association (IFPA)] "for great accomplishments in resolving the problems of stable development of the power engineering and society."

In 2006, Chumakov received a diploma for co-authoring the fourth edition of the textbook "Philosophy", one of the "300 best textbooks for higher education in honor of the 300th anniversary of [[Saint-Petersburg]]."

In 2015, Chumakov became Doctor Emeritus of the [[Bashkir State University]]. In 2015 Chumakov also became a recipient of the International [[Gusi Peace Prize]].

Thus, it is often used to limit or contradict fault in a matter.

Other examples include:
*"The current world is in a state of chaos, but that's understandable, since humans have got a lot less organized, more stupid, and more populous".
*"The building was coming down anyway."

Between 1996 and 2004, Sosa was Provincial Superior of the [[Jesuits]] in Venezuela.&lt;ref name="gc36" /&gt; During the 35th [[General Congregation]] in 2008, he was appointed Counselor General by then-Superior General [[Adolfo Nicolás]].&lt;ref name="gc36" /&gt; In 2014, he joined the General Curia of the Society of Jesus in Rome as Delegate for Interprovincial Roman Houses of the Society of Jesus in Rome, which include institutions such as the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]], the [[Pontifical Oriental Institute]], the [[Vatican Observatory]], and ''[[La Civiltà Cattolica]]''.&lt;ref name="gc36" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.europapress.es/sociedad/noticia-venezolano-arturo-sosa-abascal-nuevo-superior-general-jesuitas-20161014125520.html|title=El venezolano Arturo Sosa Abascal, nuevo superior general de los Jesuitas|last=Press|first=Europa|date=2016-10-14|work=europapress.es|access-date=2018-10-22|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Venezuela, he was strongly committed to [[left-wing politics]], and was critical of the country's representative democracy in the 1990s. He supported the two coups d'état of [[Hugo Chavez]], though he later distanced himself from Chavez following human rights violations.&lt;ref name="la-croix"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.la-croix.com/Religion/Le-P-Arturo-Sosa-general-social-tete-jesuites-2016-10-16-1200796626 |title=Le P.

Sosa speaks Spanish, Italian and English, and understands French.&lt;ref name="gc36" /&gt;

===Superior General of the Society of Jesus===
{{Jesuit}}
On 14 October 2016, during the thirty-sixth [[General Congregation]] of the Society of Jesus, the assembly elected Sosa as the Order's thirty-first [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus|Superior General]] to succeed [[Adolfo Nicolás]].&lt;ref name="UCSFA"/&gt; He became the first Latin American to head the Jesuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Harris| first1=Elise| title=Venezuelan Fr. Arturo Sosa elected as new head of Jesuit order| url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/venezuelan-fr-arturo-sosa-elected-as-new-head-of-jesuit-order-75293/|accessdate=13 February 2017| agency=Catholic News Agency|date=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first address as Superior General, he said that Jesuits should look for "alternatives to overcome poverty, inequality and oppression" and also to collaborate with others "inside and outside the Church".&lt;ref name="la-croix" /&gt;

In 2017, in a visit to the Jesuit mission in [[Cambodia]], Sosa met with a group of Buddhist monks in the Buddhist-majority country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=We are united in our desire to promote peace and reconciliation, says Fr Sosa after first dialogue with Buddhists |url=https://www.sjapc.net/2017/07/we-are-united-our-desire-promote-peace-and-reconciliation-says-fr-sosa-after-first-dialogue/ |accessdate=21 October 2018 |work=sjapc.net |publisher=Jesuit Asia Pacific Congress |date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, commenting on the [[Fifteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops]], Sosa disagreed with the synod's description of secularization as "a dark phase that is in the process of being overcome", instead calling [[secularization]] a "[[Sign of the times (Catholic Church)|sign of the times]]" for the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Secularization can help the Church proclaim the Gospel, superior general of Jesuits says |url=https://www.catholicregister.org/home/international/item/28183-secularization-can-help-the-church-proclaim-the-gospel-superior-general-of-jesuits-says |accessdate=21 October 2018 |work=Catholic News Service |date=11 October 2018 |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
''[[The Catholic Herald]]'' criticised Sosa for being one of over 1,000 signatories of a 1989 letter welcoming Cuban President [[Fidel Castro]] to Venezuela in 1989, having repressed the [[Catholic Church in Cuba]] during his time in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://catholicherald.co.uk/news/2017/05/19/jesuit-superior-general-signed-letter-praising-fidel-castro-in-1989/|title=Jesuit Superior General ‘signed letter praising Fidel Castro in 1989’ {{!}} CatholicHerald.co.uk|date=19 May 2017|work=CatholicHerald.co.uk|access-date=2 June 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Francis biographer George Neumayr described Sosa as a "Marxist", "a Venezuelian communist, and modernist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://spectator.org/the-popes-marxist-head-of-the-jesuits/|title=The Pope’s Marxist Head of the Jesuits|date=2017-05-19|work=The American Spectator|access-date=2017-08-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, in response to [[Gerhard Ludwig Müller|Cardinal Müller]]'s argument that permitting the reception of [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Communion]] by the remarried contradicts Jesus's words in the Bible that marriage is indissoluble and Müller's insistence that those words are unchangeable, Sosa argued for a "reflection on what Jesus really said", and described the Gospel as "relative", being "written by human beings" and "accepted by (...) human beings".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rossoporpora.org/rubriche/interviste-a-personalita/672-gesuiti-padre-sosa-parole-di-gesu-da-contestualizzare.html|title=GESUITI/PADRE SOSA: PAROLE DI GESU'?

Contradicting Sosa's own claim that his views were "not relativism",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pecknold characterised Sosa's remarks as "historicist relativizing".&lt;ref name="aleteia"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pecknold |first1=C.C. |title=Suppressing Jesuits, Suppressing Jesus: Fr.

In June 2017, in an interview with [[El Mundo (Spain)|''El Mundo'']], Sosa said, “We have formed symbolic figures such as the devil to express evil. Social conditioning can also represent this figure, since there are people who act [in an evil way] because they are in an environment where it is difficult to act to the contrary.” This was criticised as contradicting the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] which teaches that the [[Devil]] is a real creature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://catholicherald.co.uk/news/2017/06/01/jesuit-superior-general-we-have-formed-symbolic-figures-such-as-the-devil-to-express-evil/|title=Jesuit superior general: ‘We have formed symbolic figures such as the devil to express evil’ {{!}} CatholicHerald.co.uk|date=1 June 2017|work=CatholicHerald.co.uk|access-date=2 June 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for Sosa later argued that Sosa was not denying church teaching, saying, "to say the devil symbolizes evil is not to deny the existence of the devil."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://catholicherald.co.uk/news/2017/06/08/spokesman-for-jesuit-chief-devil-remarks-must-be-read-in-context/|title=Spokesman for Jesuit chief: Devil remarks must be read in context {{!}} CatholicHerald.co.uk|date=2017-06-08|work=CatholicHerald.co.uk|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, in an interview with [[EWTN]], Sosa argued that "the pope is not the chief of the Church, he's the Bishop of Rome". This was opposed by Pecknold, who argued that it would be wrong to believe that Pope was "merely 'first among equals'", and insisted that the pope has "[[papal primacy|supreme authority]]" over all bishops and faithful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/jesuit-superior-says-pope-is-not-the-chief-of-the-church--what-did-he-mean-76169|title=Jesuit superior says pope is not the ‘chief’ of the Church- What did he mean?|work=Catholic News Agency|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tetsugyu Soin Ban''' ([{{nihongo|伴 鉄牛|Ban Tetsugyu}}{{nihongo|祖印|soin}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tetsugyuji.com/7.html|title=Tetsugyuji no enkaku to rekishi|trans-title=Development and history|language=ja, en|publisher=Tetsugyuji International Zen Center|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [Hanamaki]], Japan, 4 June 1910 – Tokyo, Japan, 21 January 1996) was a Japanese Zen master.
He was a disciple of the [[Sōtō|Soto Zen]] Master [[Harada Daiun Sogaku]], one of the first Zen teachers to open his doctrine to western students.

== Biography ==
Tetsugyu Soin Ban was ordained as a [[Soto Zen]] monk in 1917, [[Fuchizawa]], by Zen master Engaku Chimyo.

From 1931 to 1938 Ban trained at [[Hosshin-ji]] Monastery under Harada Daiun Sogaku, inheriting the Zen style of teaching that combines the Rinzai Zen use of koans with Soto Zen forms. Subsequently, Ban studied at [[Komozawa University]], where he graduated in 1941.

In 1947 Ban Tetsugyu Soin became ''Tanto'', or Head of Practice, of Hosshin-ji Monastery. One year later, he held the same position at Hoon-ji, a Rinzai temple in Kyoto. Ban received Dharma transmission from Harada Daiun Sogaku and founded the Soto Zen temple Tosho-ji, in Tokyo. In the following years, Ban also founded the Soto Zen temples Kannon-ji, in Iwate Prefecture and Tetsugyu-ji, in Oita Prefecture.

Tetsugyu Soin was one of the first Zen masters to open the doors of the Japanese Zen monastery to European and American disciples. One well-known disciple was [[Maura Soshin O'Halloran]], an Irish Buddhist nun who wrote about her Zen training at Kannon-ji and Tosho-ji in her diary ''Pure Heart, Enlightened Mind,'' in which she refers to Ban Roshi with the honorific title "Go-Roshi." Another disciple is the American Zen teacher [[Paul Tesshin Silverman]], who, succeeded Tetsugyu Soin as the abbot of Tetsugyu-ji in 1993, becoming the first western abbot of a Japanese monastery.

Tetsugyu Soin died on January 21, 1996, after a life dedicated to spreading Zen in Japan and beyond.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2260">The North American Biodynamic Association (formerly Biodynamic Farming &amp; Gardening Association) is a [[United States]]-based company that promotes [[Biodynamic agriculture]] system through educational and research programs and has headquarters in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]].

==History==
Biodynamic agriculture was inaugurated in 1924 by Austrian scientist Rudolf Steiner. It is the oldest, non-chemical agricultural movement and pre-dates organic agriculture by some twenty years. The Association was formed in 1938 in [[New York state]] with the support of [[Ehrenfried Pfeiffer]], a disciple of [[Rudolf Steiner]], when he immigrated to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;A.D. Paschoal, "Sustainable Agriculture: An Increasing Worldwide Concern and Reality", presented at ''Second International Conference on Kyusei Nature Farming, São Paulo, Brazil'' (October 1991).[http://www.infrc.or.jp/english/KNF_Data_Base_Web/PDF%20KNF%20Conf%20Data/C2-2-029.pdf Conference presentation]&lt;/ref&gt; It is organized as a [[501(c)#501.28c.29.283.29|501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organizations|non-profit organization]].

==Purpose==
The Association is a non-profit, membership organization and is open to the public. It has an educational focus and conducts conferences, workshops and seminars; publishes books and a quarterly journal, ''Biodynamics''; and supports regional, grass-roots membership groups. It provides several booklets with specific instructions on biodynamic methods, including the biodynamic preparations and composting.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Diver, ''Biodynamic Farming &amp; Compost Preparation'', Alternative Farming Systems Guide: ATTRA, February 1999.

'''Bolesław Prus''' (pronounced: [[File:Ltspkr.png]] [[Media:Pl-Bolesław Prus.ogg|[bɔ'lεswaf 'prus]]]; 20 August 1847&amp;nbsp;– 19 May 1912; actual name, '''Aleksander Głowacki''') is a leading figure in the history of [[Polish literature]]&lt;ref name="undoubtedly"/&gt; and [[History of philosophy in Poland#Positivism|philosophy]] and a distinctive voice in [[world literature]].&lt;ref name="literature"/&gt; He is generally known by his [[pen name]], Bolesław Prus.

As a 15-year-old Głowacki joined the Polish [[January Uprising|1863 Uprising]] against [[Imperial Russia]]. Shortly after his 16th birthday, he suffered severe battle injuries.  Five months later he was imprisoned for his part in the Uprising.  These early experiences may have precipitated the [[panic disorder]] and [[agoraphobia]] that would dog him through life, and shaped his opposition to attempting to regain Poland's independence by force of arms.

In 1872 at age 25, in [[Warsaw]], he settled into a 40-year journalistic career that highlighted science, technology, education, and economic and cultural development.  These societal enterprises were essential to the endurance of a people who had in the 18th century been [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned out of political existence]] by Russia, Prussia and Austria. Głowacki took his [[pen name]] "''Prus''" from the appellation of his family's [[Prus coat of arms|coat-of-arms]].

As a sideline he wrote [[short stories]].  Succeeding with these, he went on to employ a larger canvas; over the decade between 1884 and 1895, he completed four major [[novel]]s: ''[[The Outpost (Prus novel)|The Outpost]]'', ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'', ''[[The New Woman]]'' and ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]''.  ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'' depicts the romantic infatuation of a man of action who is frustrated by his country's backwardness.  ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', Prus' only [[historical novel]], is a study of [[political power]] and of the fates of nations, set in [[ancient Egypt]] at the fall of the [[20th Dynasty]] and [[New Kingdom]].

== Life ==

=== Early years ===
[[File:Hrubieszów, plebania, XVIII, XIX.jpg|thumb|200px|Prus' [[Hrubieszów]] birthplace]] 
[[File:Lublin Castle 5 Lublin 28.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Lublin Castle]], Prus' prison during [[January Uprising|1863–65 Uprising]]]]
Aleksander Głowacki was born 20 August 1847 in [[Hrubieszów]], now in southeastern Poland, very near the present-day border with [[Ukraine]].  The town was then in the Russian-controlled sector of partitioned Poland, known as the "[[Congress Poland|Congress Kingdom]]".  Głowacki was the younger son of Antoni Głowacki, an estate steward at the village of [[Żabcze]], in [[Hrubieszów County]], and Apolonia Głowacka, ''[[née]]'' Trembińska. In 1850, when the future ''Bolesław Prus'' was three years old, his mother died; the child was placed in the care of his maternal grandmother, Marcjanna Trembińska of [[Puławy]], and, four years later, in the care of his aunt, Domicela Olszewska of [[Lublin]]. In 1856 Prus was [[orphan]]ed by his father's death. In 1862 Prus' brother Leon, a teacher thirteen years his senior, took him to [[Siedlce]], then to [[Kielce]].&lt;ref name="Bolesław Prus"/&gt;

Soon after the outbreak of the Polish [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] against [[Imperial Russia]], 15-year-old Prus ran away from school to join the insurgents.&lt;ref name="Pieścikowski, Edward p. 147"&gt;Pieścikowski, Edward, ''Bolesław Prus'', p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;  He may have been influenced by his brother Leon, who subsequently became one of the insurrection's leaders. During the Uprising, Leon developed a mental illness that he would suffer from until his death in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Pieścikowski, Edward, ''Bolesław Prus'', p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 1863, twelve days after his sixteenth birthday, Prus took part in a battle against Russian forces at a village called Białka, four kilometers south of [[Siedlce]]. He suffered [[contusion]]s to the neck and [[gunpowder]] injuries to his eyes, and was captured unconscious on the battlefield and taken to hospital in Siedlce.&lt;ref name="tokarzówna"/&gt; This experience may have caused his subsequent lifelong [[agoraphobia]].&lt;ref name="Wspomnienia o Bolesławie Prusie (Reminiscences about Bolesław Prus)"/&gt;
[[File:Bolesław Prus fotografia Konrada Brandla 1871.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Prus: [[Warsaw University]] student]] 
Five months later, in early February 1864, Prus was arrested and imprisoned at [[Lublin Castle]] for his role in the Uprising. In early April a military court sentenced him to forfeiture of his nobleman's status and resettlement on imperial lands.  On 30 April, however, the Lublin District military head credited Prus' time spent under arrest and, on account of the 16-year-old's youth, decided to place him in the custody of his uncle Klemens Olszewski.  On 7 May Prus was released and entered the household of Katarzyna Trembińska, a relative and the mother of his future wife, Oktawia Trembińska.&lt;ref name="krystyna"/&gt;

Prus enrolled at a [[Lublin]] ''[[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' ([[secondary school]], where he was a student of Józef Skłodowski, grandfather of the future [[Nobel laureate]] [[Maria Skłodowska-Curie]]).&lt;ref name="robert"/&gt; Graduating on 30 June 1866, at nineteen he matriculated in the [[University of Warsaw|Warsaw University]] Department of Mathematics and Physics.&lt;ref name="Prus, 147"/&gt;  In 1868, poverty forced him to break off his university studies.&lt;ref name="Pieścikowski, Edward p. 147"/&gt;

In 1869 he enrolled in the Forestry Department at the newly opened Agriculture and Forestry Institute in [[Puławy]], a historic town where he had spent some of his childhood and which, 15 years later, would be the setting for his striking 1884 [[flash fiction|micro-story]], "[[Mold of the Earth]]", comparing human history with the mutual aggressions of blind, mindless colonies of molds that cover a boulder adjacent to the Temple of the Sibyl. Aleksander was soon expelled from the Institute for his attitude toward the martinet Russian-language instructor.&lt;ref name="Prus, 147"/&gt;

Henceforth he studied on his own while supporting himself mainly as a tutor.  As part of his program of self-education, he translated and summarized [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''Logic''.

In 1872 he embarked on a career as a newspaper [[columnist]], while working several months at the [[Evans, Lilpop and Rau]] Machine and Agricultural Implement Works in Warsaw.&lt;ref name="cikowski"/&gt; In 1873 Prus delivered two public lectures which illustrate the breadth of his scientific interests: "On the Structure of the Universe," and "[[s:On Discoveries and Inventions|On Discoveries and Inventions]]."&lt;ref name="cikowski1"/&gt;

=== Columnist ===
[[File:Boleslaw Prus.jpg|thumb|Prus]]
As a newspaper [[columnist]], Prus commented on the achievements of scholars and scientists such as [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Alexander Bain]], [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Henry Thomas Buckle]];&lt;ref name="szweykowski"/&gt; urged Poles to study science and technology and to develop industry and commerce;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Krystyna Tokarzówna and Stanisław Fita, ''Bolesław Prus, 1847–1912: Kalendarz życia i twórczości'' (Bolesław Prus, 1847–1912: A Calendar of His Life and Work), ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; encouraged the establishment of [[charitable organization|charitable institutions]] to benefit the underprivileged;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; described the fiction and nonfiction works of fellow writers such as [[H.G. Wells]];{{Ref label|a|a|none}} and extolled man-made and natural wonders such as the [[Wieliczka Salt Mine]],&lt;ref name="Prus' ''Pharaoh'' and the Wieliczka Salt Mine"/&gt; an 1887 [[solar eclipse]] that he witnessed at [[Mława]],&lt;ref name="Prus' ''Pharaoh'' and the Solar Eclipse"/&gt; planned building of the [[Eiffel Tower]] for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Paris Exposition]],&lt;ref&gt;Bolesław Prus, ''"Wieża paryska"'' ("The Paris Tower"), in ''Kurier Warszawski'' (Warsaw Courier), no. 59, 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nałęczów]], where he vacationed for 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;Bolesław Prus, ''"Z Nałęczowa"'' ("From Nałęczów"), in ''Kurier Codzienny'' (Daily Courier), no. 237, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt;

His "Weekly Chronicles" spanned forty years (they have since been reprinted in twenty volumes) and would help prepare the ground for the 20th-century blossoming of Polish [[Timeline of Polish science and technology|science]] and especially [[Polish School of Mathematics|mathematics]].{{Ref label|b|b|none}} "Our national life," wrote Prus, "will take a normal course only when we have become a useful, indispensable element of civilization, when we have become able to give nothing for free and to demand nothing for free."&lt;ref name="Bolesław Prus2"/&gt; The social importance of science and technology would recur as a theme in his novels ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'' (1889)&lt;ref&gt;[[Zygmunt Szweykowski]], ''Twórczość Bolesława Prusa'' (The Art of Bolesław Prus), pp. 170-71.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (1895).&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''Pharaoh'': Primer on Power", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XL, no. 3, 1995, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of contemporary thinkers, the one who most influenced Prus and other writers of the Polish "[[Positivism in Poland|Positivist]]" period (roughly 1864–1900) was [[Herbert Spencer]], the English [[sociologist]] who coined the phrase, "[[survival of the fittest]]." Prus would call Spencer "the [[Aristotle]] of the 19th century" and write: "I grew up under the influence of Spencerian [[evolution]]ary [[philosophy]] and heeded its counsels, not those of [[Idealist]] or [[Auguste Comte|Comtean]] [[philosophy]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Zygmunt Szweykowski]], ''Twórczość Bolesława Prusa'' (The Art of Bolesław Prus), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Prus interpreted "survival of the fittest," in the societal sphere, as involving not only competition but also cooperation; and he adopted Spencer's metaphor of [[Herbert Spencer#General influence|society as organism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Zygmunt Szweykowski]], ''Twórczość Bolesława Prusa'' (The Art of Bolesław Prus), pp. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;  He would use this metaphor to striking effect in his 1884 [[flash fiction|micro-story]] "[[Mold of the Earth]]," and in the introduction to his 1895 [[historical novel]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)#Themes|Pharaoh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''Pharaoh'': the Creation of a Historical Novel", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', 1994, no. 1, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Prus began writing regular weekly newspaper columns, his finances stabilized, permitting him on 14 January 1875 to marry a [[List of coupled cousins|distant cousin]] on his mother's side, Oktawia Trembińska.  She was the daughter of Katarzyna Trembińska, in whose home he had lived, after release from prison, for two years in 1864–66 while completing secondary school.&lt;ref name="wspomnienia"/&gt; The couple adopted a boy, Emil Trembiński (born 11 September 1886, the son of Prus' brother-in-law Michał Trembiński, who had died on 10 November 1888).&lt;ref name="kalendarz"/&gt;  Emil would be the model for Rascal in chapter 48 of Prus' 1895 novel, ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]''.&lt;ref name="tokarzówna5"/&gt; On 18 February 1904, aged seventeen, Emil fatally shot himself in the chest on the doorstep of an unrequited love.&lt;ref name="tokarzówna6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stepdaughter"/&gt;

It has been alleged that in 1906, aged 59, Prus had a son, Jan Bogusz Sacewicz.  The boy's mother was Alina Sacewicz, widow of Dr. Kazimierz Sacewicz, a socially conscious physician whom Prus had known at Nałęczów.  Dr. Sacewicz may have been the model for [[Stefan Żeromski]]'s Dr. Judym in the novel, ''Ludzie bezdomni'' (Homeless People)—a character resembling Dr. Stockman in [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play, ''[[An Enemy of the People]]''.&lt;ref name="futurological"/&gt;  Prus, known for his affection for children, took a lively interest in little Jan, as attested by a prolific correspondence with Jan's mother (whom Prus attempted to interest in writing). Jan Sacewicz would become one of Prus' major [[legatee]]s and an engineer, and die in a German camp after the suppression of the [[Warsaw Uprising]] of August–October 1944.&lt;ref name="pauszer"/&gt;
[[File:Herb Prus.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Prus coat of arms|Coat-of-arms]] that inspired the [[pen-name]] "Bolesław '''''Prus'''''"]]
Though Prus was a gifted writer, initially best known as a humorist, he early on thought little of his journalistic and literary work. Hence at the inception of his career in 1872, at age 25, he adopted for his newspaper columns and fiction the [[pen name]] "Prus" ("''[[Prus Coat of Arms|Prus I]]''" was his family [[coat-of-arms]]), reserving his actual name, Aleksander Głowacki, for "serious" writing.&lt;ref name="Bolesław Prus7"/&gt;

An 1878 incident illustrates the strong feelings that can be aroused in susceptible readers of newspaper columns. Prus had criticized the rowdy behavior of some Warsaw university students at a lecture about the poet [[Wincenty Pol]]. The students demanded that Prus retract what he had written.  He refused, and on 26 March 1878 several of them surrounded him outside his home, where he had returned shortly before in the company (for his safety) of two fellow writers; one of the students, Jan Sawicki, slapped Prus' face.&lt;ref name="tokarzówna8"/&gt; Police were summoned, but Prus declined to press charges.&lt;ref name="lorentowicz"/&gt;  Seventeen years later, during his 1895 visit to [[Paris]], Prus' memory of the incident was still so painful that he may have refused (accounts vary) to meet with one of his assailants, [[Kazimierz Dłuski]], and his wife [[Bronisława Dłuska]] ([[Marie Skłodowska Curie]]'s sister who 19 years later, in 1914, would scold [[Joseph Conrad]] for writing his novels and stories in English, rather than in [[Polish language|Polish]] for the benefit of Polish culture&lt;ref&gt;[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''[[Joseph Conrad]]:  A Life'', 2007, p. 463.&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="tokarzówna9"/&gt;  These curiously interlinked incidents involving the Dłuskis and the two authors perhaps illustrate the contemporary intensity of aggrieved Polish national pride.

In 1882, on the recommendation of an earlier editor-in-chief, the prophet of [[Positivism in Poland|Polish Positivism]], [[Aleksander Świętochowski]], Prus succeeded to the editorship of the [[Warsaw]] daily ''Nowiny'' (News). The newspaper had been bought in June 1882 by financier [[Stanisław Kronenberg]].  Prus resolved, in the best [[Positivism in Poland|Positivist]] fashion, to make it "an observatory of societal facts"—an instrument for advancing the development of his country. After less than a year, however, ''Nowiny''—which had had a history of financial instability since changing in July 1878 from a Sunday paper to a daily—folded, and Prus resumed writing [[column (newspaper)|columns]].&lt;ref name="kalendarz10"/&gt; 
&lt;ref name="cikowski11"&gt;Pieścikowski, Edward, ''Bolesław Prus'', 152.&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued working as a journalist to the end of his life, well after he had achieved success as an author of short stories and novels.&lt;ref&gt;Pieścikowski, Edward, ''Bolesław Prus'', p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fiction ===
[[File:Prus na frontopisie pierwszego wydania Lalki.jpg|thumb|125px|Prus, by [[Józef Holewiński|Holewiński]]. [[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] to first book edition of  ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'', 1890.]]

In time, Prus adopted the French Positivist critic [[Hippolyte Taine]]'s concept of the arts, including literature, as a second means, alongside the sciences, of studying reality,&lt;ref name="szweykowski12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="phenomenon"/&gt; and he devoted more attention to his sideline of [[short story|short-story writer]]. Prus' stories, which met with great acclaim, owed much to the literary influence of Polish novelist [[Józef Ignacy Kraszewski]] and, among English-language writers, to [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Mark Twain]].&lt;ref name="The History of Polish Literature"/&gt; His fiction would also be influenced by French writers [[Victor Hugo]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Alphonse Daudet]] and [[Émile Zola]].&lt;ref name="szweykowski13"/&gt;

Prus wrote several dozen stories, originally published in newspapers and ranging in length from [[flash fiction|micro-story]] to [[novella]].  Characteristic of them are Prus' keen observation of everyday life and sense of humor, which he had early honed as a contributor to humor magazines.&lt;ref name="szweykowski14"/&gt; The prevalence of themes from everyday life is consistent with the Polish Positivist artistic program, which sought to portray the circumstances of the [[populace]] rather than those of the [[Romantic hero]]es of an earlier generation.  The literary period in which Prus wrote was ostensibly a [[prose|prosaic]] one, by contrast with the [[poetry]] of the Romantics; but Prus' prose is often a [[prose poetry|poetic prose]].  His stories also often contain elements of [[fantasy]] or whimsy.  A fair number originally appeared in [[New Year]]'s issues of newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Tokarzówna, Krystyna; Stanisław Fita, ''Bolesław Prus, 1847-1912: Kalendarz życia i twórczości'', ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prus long eschewed writing [[historical fiction]], arguing that it must inevitably distort [[history]].  He criticized contemporary [[historical novel]]ists for their lapses in historic accuracy, including [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s failure, in the military scenes in his ''[[The Trilogy|Trilogy]]'' portraying 17th-century Polish history, to describe the [[logistics]] of warfare.  It would only be in 1888, when Prus was forty, that he would write his first historical fiction, the stunning short story, "[[A Legend of Old Egypt]]."  This story would, a few years later, serve as a preliminary sketch for his only historical novel, ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (1895).&lt;ref name="wspomnienia15"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Szweykowski, Zygmunt, ''"Geneza noweli 'Z legend dawnego Egiptu'"'' (The Genesis of the Short Story, "A Legend of Old Egypt"), in ''Nie tylko o Prusie: szkice'' (Not Only about Prus: Sketches), 1st ed., 1967, pp. 256-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually Prus would compose four [[novel]]s on what he had referred to in an 1884 letter as "great questions of our age":&lt;ref name="cikowski16"/&gt; ''[[The Outpost (Prus novel)|The Outpost]]'' (''Placówka'', 1886) on the Polish peasant; ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'' (''Lalka'', 1889) on the [[aristocracy]] and [[townspeople]] and on [[Ideal (ethics)|idealists]] struggling to bring about [[social reform]]s; ''[[The New Woman (novel)|The New Woman]]'' (''Emancypantki'', 1893) on [[feminism|feminist]] concerns; and his only [[historical novel]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (''Faraon'', 1895), on mechanisms of [[political power]].  The work of greatest sweep and most universal appeal is ''Pharaoh''.&lt;ref name="christopher"/&gt;  Prus' novels, like his stories, were originally published in newspaper [[serial (literature)|serialization]].&lt;ref&gt;Szweykowski, Zygmunt, ''Twórczość Bolesława Prusa'', ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After having sold ''Pharaoh'' to the publishing firm of Gebethner and Wolff, Prus embarked, on 16 May 1895, on a four-month journey abroad. He visited [[Berlin]], [[Dresden]], [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Stuttgart]] and [[Rapperswil]]. At the latter Swiss town he stayed two months (July–August), nursing his [[agoraphobia]] and spending much time with his friends, the promising young writer [[Stefan Żeromski]] and his wife Oktawia. The couple sought Prus' help for the [[Polish Museum, Rapperswil#Żeromski and Prus|Polish National Museum]], housed in the Rapperswil Castle, where Żeromski was librarian.&lt;ref name="Pieścikowski 157"/&gt;

The final stage of Prus's journey took him to [[Paris]], where he was prevented by his agoraphobia from crossing the [[Seine River]] to visit the city's southern [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]].&lt;ref name="Pieścikowski 157"/&gt; He was nevertheless pleased to find that his descriptions of Paris in ''The Doll'' had been on the mark (he had based them mainly on French-language publications).&lt;ref name="wspomnienia17"/&gt; From Paris he hurried home to recuperate at [[Nałęczów]] from his journey, the last that he would make abroad.&lt;ref name="Bolesław Prus18"/&gt;

=== Later years ===
[[File:Bolesław Prus (1897).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Portrait by [[Antoni Kamieński]], 1897, celebrating Prus' 25 years as journalist and fiction writer]]
Over the years, Prus lent his support to many charitable and social causes. But there was one event he would come to rue for the broad criticism it brought him:  his participation in welcoming Russia's [[tsar]] during [[Nicholas II]]'s 1897 visit to Warsaw.&lt;ref name="Bolesław Prus19"/&gt;  As a rule, Prus did not affiliate himself with [[political parties]], as this might compromise his journalistic objectivity.  His associations, by design and temperament, were with individuals and select worthy causes rather than with large groups.&lt;ref&gt;Tokarzówna, Krystyna; Stanisław Fita; Zygmunt Szweykowski, ed.; ''Bolesław Prus, 1847-1912: Kalendarz życia i twórczości'' (Bolesław Prus, 1847-1912: a Calendar of His Life and Work), 1969, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The disastrous [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] had persuaded Prus that society must advance through learning, work and commerce rather than through risky social upheavals. He departed from this stance, however, in 1905, when [[Imperial Russia]] experienced defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and Poles demanded autonomy and reforms. On 20 December 1905, in the first issue of a short-lived periodical, ''Młodość'' (Youth), he published an article, "''Oda do młodości''" ("Ode to Youth"), whose title harked back to an 1820 poem by [[Adam Mickiewicz]]. Prus wrote, in reference to his earlier position on revolution and strikes: "with the greatest pleasure, I admit it—I was wrong!"&lt;ref name="tokarzówna20"/&gt;
[[File:Bolesław Prus tomb.PNG|thumb|175px|Prus' tomb at Warsaw's [[Powązki Cemetery]], designed by his nephew, [[Stanisław Jackowski]]]]
In 1908 Prus serialized, in the Warsaw ''Tygodnik Ilustrowany'' (Illustrated Weekly), his novel ''Dzieci'' (Children), depicting the young revolutionaries, terrorists and anarchists of the day — an uncharacteristically humorless work. Three years later a final novel, ''Przemiany'' (Changes), was to have been, like ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'', a panorama of society and its vital concerns. However, in 1911-12 the novel had barely begun serialization in the ''Illustrated Weekly'' when its composition was cut short by Prus' death.&lt;ref name="Bolesław Prus21"/&gt;

Neither of the two late novels, ''Children'' or ''Changes'', is generally regarded as part of the essential Prus canon, and [[Czesław Miłosz]] has called ''Children'' one of Prus' weakest works.&lt;ref name="The History of Polish Literature22"/&gt;

Prus' last novel to meet with popular acclaim was ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', completed in 1895.  Depicting the demise of [[ancient Egypt]]'s [[Twentieth Dynasty]] and [[New Kingdom]] three thousand years earlier, ''Pharaoh'' had also reflected Poland's loss of independence a century before in 1795&lt;ref name="christopher23"/&gt;—an independence whose post-[[World War I]] restoration Prus would not live to see.

On 19 May 1912, in his Warsaw apartment at 12 Wolf Street (''ulica Wilcza 12''), near [[Triple Cross Square]], Prus' forty-year journalistic and literary career came to an end.&lt;ref name="cikowski24"/&gt;

The beloved [[agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] author was mourned by the nation he had striven, as soldier, thinker and writer, to rescue from oblivion.&lt;ref name="To samo ramię"/&gt; Thousands attended his 22 May 1912 funeral service at [[St. Alexander's Church, Warsaw|St. Alexander's Church]] on nearby [[Triple Cross Square]] (''Plac Trzech Krzyży'') and his interment at [[Powązki Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="reminiscences"/&gt;

Prus' tomb was designed by his nephew, the noted sculptor [[Stanisław Jackowski]]. On three sides it bears, respectively, the novelist's name, ''Aleksander Głowacki'', his years of birth and death, and his [[pen name]], ''Bolesław Prus''.  On the fourth side is the Polish-language inscription ''"Serce serc"'' ("Heart of hearts"), borrowed from the [[Latin]] ''"Cor cordium"'' on the tomb of English Romantic poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] in [[Rome]]'s [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome|Protestant Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="reminiscences25"/&gt; Below this inscription stands the figure of a little girl embracing the tomb — a figure emblematic of Prus' well-known empathy and affection for children.&lt;ref name="wspomnienia26"/&gt;&lt;ref name="klonowska"/&gt;

[[File:Kazimierz Palace, Warsaw University 4.JPG|thumb|180px|1982 plaque on [[Warsaw University]]'s [[Kazimierz Palace]], commemorating 1866–68 student Bolesław Prus]]
On 3 December 1961, nearly half a century after Prus' death, a museum devoted to him was opened in the 18th-century Małachowski Palace at [[Nałęczów]], near [[Lublin]] in eastern Poland. Outside the palace is a sculpture of Prus seated on a bench.  Another statuary monument to Prus at Nałęczów, sculpted by Alina Ślesińska, was unveiled on 8 May 1966.&lt;ref name="krystyna37"/&gt;  It was at Nałęczów that Prus vacationed for thirty years from 1882 until his death, and that he met the young [[Stefan Żeromski]]. Prus stood witness at Żeromski's 1892 wedding and generously helped foster the younger man's literary career.&lt;ref&gt;Pieścikowski, Edward, ''Bolesław Prus'', pp. 152, 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Prus espoused a [[positivist]] and [[Literary realism|realist]] outlook, much in his fiction shows qualities compatible with pre-[[January Uprising|1863-Uprising]] Polish [[Romantic literature]].  Indeed, he held the Polish [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]] in high regard.&lt;ref name="szweykowski27"/&gt; Prus' novels in turn, especially ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'' and ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', with their innovative composition techniques, blazed the way for the 20th-century Polish novel.&lt;ref name="Bolesław Prus28"/&gt;

Prus' novel ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'', with its rich realistic detail and simple, functional language, was considered by [[Czesław Miłosz]] to be the great Polish novel.&lt;ref name="The History of Polish Literature29"/&gt;

[[Joseph Conrad]], during his 1914 visit to Poland just as [[World War I]] was breaking out, "delighted in his beloved Prus" and read everything by the ten-years-older, recently deceased author that he could get his hands on.&lt;ref name="Conrad under Familial Eyes"/&gt;  He pronounced ''[[The New Woman (novel)|The New Woman]]'' (the first novel by Prus that he read) "better than [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]"—Dickens being a favorite author of Conrad's.&lt;ref name="Conrad under Familial Eyes30"/&gt; [[Czesław Miłosz|Miłosz]], however, thought ''[[The New Woman (novel)|The New Woman]]'' "as a whole... an artistic failure..."&lt;ref name="The History of Polish Literature31"/&gt; [[Zygmunt Szweykowski]] similarly faulted ''The New Woman'''s loose, tangential construction; but this, in his view, was partly redeemed by Prus' humor and by some superb episodes, while "The tragedy of Mrs. Latter and the picture of [the town of] Iksinów are among the peak achievements of [Polish] novel-writing."&lt;ref name="szweykowski32"/&gt;
 
''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', a study of [[political power]], became the favorite novel of Soviet dictator [[Joseph Stalin]], prefigured the fate of U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], and continues to point analogies to more recent times.&lt;ref name="Prus' ''Pharaoh'' and Curtin's Translation"/&gt;  ''Pharaoh'' is often described as Prus' "best-composed novel"&lt;ref name="redniowiecza"/&gt;—indeed, "one of the best-composed [of all] Polish novels."&lt;ref name="tyszkiewicz"/&gt;  This was due in part to ''Pharaoh'' having been composed complete prior to newspaper serialization, rather than being written in installments just before printing, as was the case with Prus' earlier major novels.&lt;ref&gt;Pieścikowski, Edward, ''Bolesław Prus'', p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Doll'' and ''Pharaoh'' are available in English versions.&lt;ref name="welsh"/&gt; ''The Doll'' has been translated into sixteen languages, and ''Pharaoh'' into twenty. In addition, ''The Doll'' has been filmed several times,&lt;ref&gt;including [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064570/] ''[[The Doll (1968 film)|The Doll]]'', directed by [[Wojciech Jerzy Has]], 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; and been produced as a 1977 [[television miniseries]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[:pl:Lalka (serial telewizyjny)|Lalka]]'', directed by [[:pl:Ryszard Ber|Ryszard Ber]], 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pharaoh'' was adapted into a [[Pharaoh (film)|1966 feature film]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060401/] ''[[Pharaoh (film)|Pharaoh]]'' (Internet Movie Database).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897-99 Prus [[Serial (literature)|serialized]] in the Warsaw ''Daily Courier'' (''Kurier Codzienny'') a [[monograph]] on ''[[Wikisource:The Most General Life Ideals|The Most General Life Ideals]]'' (''Najogólniejsze ideały życiowe''), which systematized ethical ideas that he had developed over his career regarding ''happiness'', ''utility'' and ''perfection'' in the lives of individuals and societies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zygmunt Szweykowski]], ''Twórczość Bolesława Prusa'' (The Art of Bolesław Prus), pp. 295-97 and ''[[passim]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In it he returned to the society-organizing (i.e., political) interests that had been frustrated during his ''Nowiny'' editorship fifteen years earlier. A book edition appeared in 1901 (2nd, revised edition, 1905). This work, rooted in [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian philosophy]] and [[Herbert Spencer#General influence|Herbert Spencer's]] view of society-as-organism, retains interest especially for [[philosophy|philosophers]] and [[social science|social scientists]].&lt;ref&gt;Pieścikowski, Edward, ''Bolesław Prus'', pp. 138-39, 161, 163-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Prus' learned projects remained incomplete at his death. He had sought, over his writing career, to develop a coherent theory of literary composition.  Notes of his from 1886-1912 were never put together into a finished book as he had intended.&lt;ref name="melkowski"/&gt;{{Ref label|c|c|none}}  His precepts included the maxim, "[[Noun]]s, nouns and more nouns." Some particularly intriguing fragments describe Prus' [[combinatorial]] [[calculation]]s of the millions of potential "individual types" of human [[character structure|characters]], given a stated number of "individual [[Trait theory|traits]]."&lt;ref name="melkowski34"/&gt;

A curious [[comparative literature|comparative-literature]] aspect has been noted to Prus' career, which paralleled that of his American contemporary, [[Ambrose Bierce]] (1842–1914). Each was born and reared in a rural area and had a "Polish" connection (Bierce, born five years before Prus, was reared in [[Kosciusko County, Indiana]], and attended [[high school]] at the [[county seat]], [[Warsaw, Indiana]]). Each became a [[war]] [[Casualty (person)|casualty]] with [[combat]] [[head trauma]]—Prus in 1863 in the Polish [[January Uprising|1863-65 Uprising]]; Bierce in 1864 in the [[American Civil War]]. Each experienced false starts in other occupations, and at twenty-five became a journalist for the next forty years; failed to sustain a career as editor-in-chief; achieved celebrity as a short-story writer; lost a son in tragic circumstances (Prus, an adopted son; Bierce, both his sons); attained superb humorous effects by portraying human egoism (Prus especially in ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', Bierce in ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]''); was dogged from early adulthood by a health problem (Prus, [[agoraphobia]]; Bierce, [[asthma]]); and died within two years of the other (Prus in 1912; Bierce presumably in 1914). Prus, however, unlike Bierce, went on from short stories to write novels.&lt;ref name="kasparek"/&gt;

In Prus' lifetime and since, his contributions to Polish literature and culture have been memorialized without regard to the nature of the political system prevailing at the time.  His 50th birthday, in 1897, was marked by special newspaper issues celebrating his 25 years as a journalist and fiction writer, and a portrait of him was commissioned from artist [[Antoni Kamieński]].&lt;ref name="Bolesław Prus35"/&gt;

The town where Prus was born, [[Hrubieszów]], near the present Polish-[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] border, is graced by an outdoor sculpture of him.

A 1982 plaque on [[Warsaw University]]'s administration building, the historic [[Kazimierz Palace#Warsaw University|Kazimierz Palace]], commemorates Prus' years at the University in 1866-68.  Across the street (''[[Krakowskie Przedmieście]]'') from the University, in [[Holy Cross Church, Warsaw|Holy Cross Church]], a 1936 plaque by Prus' nephew [[Stanisław Jackowski]], featuring Prus' profile, is dedicated to the memory of the "great writer and teacher of the nation."&lt;ref name="reminiscences36"/&gt;

On the front of Warsaw's present-day ''ulica Wilcza 12'', the site of Prus' last home, is a plaque commemorating the earlier, now-nonexistent building's most famous resident.  A few hundred meters from there, ''ulica Bolesława Prusa'' (Bolesław Prus Street) debouches into the southeast corner of Warsaw's [[Triple Cross Square]].  In this square stands St. Alexander's Church, where Prus' funeral was held.&lt;ref name="Bolesław Prus38"/&gt;

In 1937, plaques were installed at Warsaw's ''[[Krakowskie Przedmieście]]'' ''4'' and ''7'', where the two chief characters of Prus' novel ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'', Stanisław Wokulski and Ignacy Rzecki, respectively, were deduced to have resided.&lt;ref name="cikowski39"/&gt;  On the same street, in a park adjacent to the [[Hotel Bristol, Warsaw|Hotel Bristol]], near the site of a newspaper for which Prus wrote, stands a twice-life-size statue of Prus, sculpted in 1977 by [[Anna Kamieńska-Łapińska]];&lt;ref name="Bolesław Prus40"/&gt; it is some 12 feet tall, on a minimal pedestal as befits an author who walked the same ground with his fellow men.

Consonant with Prus' interest in commerce and technology, a Polish Ocean Lines [[cargo ship|freighter]] has been named for him.&lt;ref name="Bolesław Prus-2"/&gt;

For 10 years, from 1975 to 1984, Poles honored Prus' memory with a 10-''[[złoty]]'' coin featuring his profile.  In 2012, to mark the 100th anniversary of his death, the Polish mint produced three coins with individual designs:  in gold, silver, and an aluminum-zinc alloy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Three Polish Coins Honor Boleslaw Prus |url=http://news.coinupdate.com/three-coins-honor-boleslaw-prus-1599/ |publisher=Coin Update News |accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prus' fiction and nonfiction writings continue relevant in our time.&lt;ref&gt;Witness articles such as Aleksander Kaczorowski, ''"My z Wokulskiego"'' ("We [Descendants] of Wokulski) [protagonist of Prus' novel ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'']" in ''Plus Minus'', the ''[[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]]'' (Republic) Weekly [Magazine], no. 33 (1016), Saturday-Sunday, 18–19 August 2012, pp. P8-P9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==
{{refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} In a January 1909 newspaper column, Prus discussed [[H.G. Wells]]' 1901 book, ''[[Anticipations]]'', including Wells' prediction that by the year 2000, following the defeat of German [[imperialism]] "on land and at sea," there would be a [[European Union]] that would reach eastward to include the [[western Slavs]]—the [[Poland|Poles]], [[Czech Republic|Czechs]] and [[Slovakia|Slovaks]]. The latter peoples, along with the [[Hungary|Hungarians]] and six other countries, did in fact join the [[European Union]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="A Futurological Note: Prus on H.G. Wells and the Year 2000"/&gt;

'''b.''' {{Note label|b|b|none}} Prus was not alone in advocating the development of science and technology.  It was part of the spirit of the times.  The great Polish mathematician [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]] writes that in the period when Poland was under complete foreign rule (1795–1918) "It was a common belief that the cultivation of science and the growth of its potential would somehow guarantee the [survival] of the [Polish] nation."&lt;ref name="A Half Century of Polish Mathematics:  Remembrances and Reflections"/&gt;

'''c.''' {{Note label|c|c|none}}  In 1890 Prus wrote:  "When I was starting out as a writer, I wrote in part instinctively, in part by inadvertent imitation.  My productions were a collection of haphazard observations, put together no doubt against the backdrop of what I had read.  Every beginning author does the same.  To be sure, this kind of work was to me a great mortification. [...] Then I began asking older authors, and they told me that 'there are no rules, nor can there be any, for the art of novel-writing.' [...] Then [about 1880], brought to desperation, I set about trying to resolve for myself the question:  'Can literary art be reduced to general rules?'  After several years of observing and thinking, the matter began to get clearer for me, and as early as August 1886 I set down my first notes [...] and, God willing, I hope to publish a scientific theory of literary art.  I expect that it will contain some fairly new things."&lt;ref name="Bolesław Prus41"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4380">The '''Cassirer–Heidegger debate''' is an encounter between [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Ernst Cassirer]] in March 1929 in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]] concerning the significance of [[Kantian]] notions of freedom and rationality.
Cassirer argues that while Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' emphasizes human temporality and finitude, he also sought to situate human cognition within a broader conception of humanity. Cassirer challenges Heidegger's relativism by invoking the universal validity of truths discovered by the exact and moral sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schalow |first1=Frank |title=Revisiting the Heidegger–Cassirer Debate |journal=[[Comparative and Continental Philosophy]] |date=November 2012 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=307–315 |doi=10.1179/ccp.4.2.b536328017k87538 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/ccp.4.2.b536328017k87538 |accessdate=26 November 2018 |language=en |issn=1757-0638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=When Philosophy Mattered |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/81380/heidegger-cassirer-davos-kant |website=The New Republic |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamburg |first1=Carl H. |title=A Cassirer-Heidegger Seminar |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |date=1964 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=208–222 |doi=10.2307/2105394 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2105394?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Waite |first1=Geoffrey |title=On Esotericism: Heidegger and/or Cassirer at Davos |journal=Political Theory |date=1998 |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=603–651 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/191766?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of psychology, '''cognitive dissonance''' is the [[Stress (psychological)|mental discomfort]] (psychological stress) experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory [[belief]]s, [[idea]]s, or [[Value (ethics)|values]]. This discomfort is triggered by a situation in which a person’s belief clashes with new evidence perceived by that person. When confronted with facts that contradict personal beliefs, ideals, and values, people will find a way to resolve the contradiction in order to reduce their discomfort.&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1957"&gt;Festinger, L. (1957). ''A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance''. California: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Festinger | first1 = L. | year = 1962 | title = Cognitive dissonance | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 207 | issue = 4| pages = 93–107 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1062-93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance'' (1957), [[Leon Festinger]] proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency in order to mentally function in the [[Reality|real world]]. A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable, and so is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance, by making changes to justify the stressful behavior, either by adding new parts to the cognition causing the psychological dissonance, or by actively avoiding social situations and contradictory information likely to increase the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1957"/&gt;

== Relations among cognitions ==
To function in the [[reality]] of a modern society, human beings continually adjust the correspondence of their mental attitudes and personal actions; such continual adjustments, between cognition and action, result in one of three relationships with reality:&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1957"/&gt;
# Consonant relationship: Two cognitions or actions consistent with each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out to dinner, and ordering water rather than wine)
# Irrelevant relationship: Two cognitions or actions unrelated to each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out, and wearing a shirt)
# Dissonant relationship: Two cognitions or actions inconsistent with each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out, but then drinking more wine)

=== Magnitude of dissonance ===
The reduction of the [[psychological stress]] of cognitive dissonance is a function of the magnitude of the dissonance caused by the existential inconsistency, between two contradictory beliefs held by the person; or by the contradiction between the person's beliefs and an action he or she has taken.&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; Two factors determine the degree of psychological dissonance caused by two conflicting cognitions or by two conflicting actions:
# The importance of cognitions: The greater the personal value of the elements, the greater the magnitude of the dissonance in the relation.
# Ratio of cognitions: The proportion of dissonant-to-consonant elements.

== Reduction==
Cognitive dissonance theory proposes that people seek psychological consistency between their personal expectations of life and the existential [[reality]] of the world. To function by that expectation of existential consistency, people continually reduce their cognitive dissonance in order to align their cognitions (perceptions of the world) with their actions.

The creation and establishment of psychological consistency allows the person afflicted with cognitive dissonance to lessen his or her mental stress by actions that reduce the magnitude of the dissonance, realised either by changing with or by justifying against, or by being indifferent to the existential contradiction that is inducing the mental stress.&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1957"/&gt; In practice, people reduce the magnitude of their cognitive dissonance in four ways:
# Change the behavior or the cognition ("I'll eat no more of this doughnut.")
# Justify the behavior or the cognition, by changing the conflicting cognition ("I'm allowed to cheat my diet every once in a while.")
# Justify the behavior or the cognition by adding new cognitions ("I'll spend thirty extra minutes at the gymnasium to work off the doughnut.")
# Ignore or deny information that conflicts with existing beliefs ("This doughnut is not a high-sugar food.")

Three cognitive biases in particular are components of dissonance theory. The bias that one does not have any biases, the bias that one is "better, kinder, smarter, more moral, and nicer than average," and [[confirmation bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tavris |first1=Carol |authorlink1=Carol Tavris |last2=Aronson |first2=Elliot |authorlink2=Elliot Aronson |title=Why We Believe -- Long After We Shouldn't |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=51-53 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105182429/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/why_we_believe_long_after_we_shouldnt |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That a consistent psychology is required for functioning in the real world also was indicated in the results of ''The Psychology of Prejudice'' (2006), wherein people facilitate their functioning in the real world by employing human categories (i.e. sex and gender, age and race, etc.) with which they manage their social interactions with other people.

Likewise, the study ''Patterns of Cognitive Dissonance-reducing Beliefs Among Smokers: A Longitudinal Analysis from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey'' (2012) indicated that smokers use justification beliefs to reduce their cognitive dissonance about smoking tobacco and the negative consequences of smoking tobacco.

# Continuing smokers (Smoking and no attempt to quit since the previous round of study.)
# Successful quitters (Quit during the study and did not use tobacco from the time of the previous round of study.)
#Failed quitters (Quit during the study, but relapsed to smoking at the time of the study.)

To reduce cognitive dissonance, the participant smokers adjusted their beliefs to correspond with their actions:

# Functional beliefs ("Smoking calms me down when I am stressed or upset."; "Smoking helps me concentrate better."; "Smoking is an important part of my life."; and "Smoking makes it easier for me to socialize.")
# Risk-minimizing beliefs ("The medical evidence that smoking is harmful is exaggerated."; "One has to die of something, so why not enjoy yourself and smoke?"; and "Smoking is no more risky than many other things people do.")&lt;ref&gt;Fotuhi, Omid, et al.  Tobacco control (2012): tobaccocontrol-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paradigms==
There are four theoretic paradigms of cognitive dissonance, the mental stress people suffer when exposed to contradictory information that is inconsistent with their prior [[belief]]s, [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s, or [[Value (ethics)|values]]; (i) Belief Disconfirmation, (ii) Induced Compliance, (iii) Free Choice, and (iv) Effort Justification; which respectively explain: what happens after a person acts inconsistently, relative to his or her prior intellectual perspectives; what happens after a person makes decisions; and what are the effects upon a person who has expended much effort to achieve a goal. Common to each paradigm of cognitive-dissonance theory is the tenet: People invested in a given perspective shall—when confronted with disconfirming evidence—expend great effort to justify retaining the challenged perspective.

===Belief disconfirmation===
The disconfirmation (contradiction) of a belief, ideal, or system of values causes cognitive dissonance that can be resolved by changing the belief under contradiction; yet, instead of effecting change, the resultant mental stress restores psychological consonance to the person, by misperception, rejection, or refutation of the contradiction; seeking moral support from people who share the contradicted beliefs; or acting to persuade other people that the contradiction is unreal.&lt;ref&gt;Harmon-Jones, Eddie, "A Cognitive Dissonance Theory Perspective on Persuasion", in ''The Persuasion Handbook: Developments in Theory and Practice'', James Price Dillard, Michael Pfau, Eds. 2002. Thousand Oaks, California: Sage Publications, p.101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Kracht|Kracht, C.]], &amp; [[David Woodard|Woodard, D.]], [http://www.wehrhahn-verlag.de/index.php?section=abisz&amp;subsection=details&amp;id=577 ''Five Years, Vol. 1''] ([[Hannover]]: [[:de:Wehrhahn Verlag|Wehrhahn Verlag]], 2011), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early hypothesis of belief disconfirmation presented in ''[[When Prophecy Fails]]'' (1956) reported that faith deepened among the members of an apocalyptic religious cult, despite the failed prophecy of an alien spacecraft soon to land on Earth, to rescue them from earthly corruption. At the determined place and time, the cult assembled; they believed that only they would survive planetary destruction; yet the spaceship did not arrive to Earth. The disconfirmed prophecy caused them acute cognitive-dissonance: Had they been victims of a hoax? Had they vainly donated away their material possessions? To resolve the dissonance, between apocalyptic, end-of-the-world religious beliefs and earthly, [[Reality|material reality]], most of the cult restored their psychological consonance by choosing to hold a less mentally-stressful idea to explain the missed landing. That the aliens had given planet Earth a second chance at existence, which, in turn, empowered them to re-direct their religious cult to environmentalism; social advocacy to end human damage to planet Earth. Moreover, upon overcoming the disconfirmed belief by changing to global environmentalism, the cult increased in numbers, by successful [[proselytism]].&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L., Riecken, H.W., Schachter, S. ''When Prophecy Fails'' (1956). Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. p. 000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of ''The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference'' (2008) reported the belief disconfirmation occurred to the ''[[Chabad]]'' Orthodox Jewish congregation who believed that their [[Rebbe]] (Menachem Mendel Schneerson) was the Messiah. Yet, when he died of a stroke in 1994, instead of accepting that their Rebbe was not the Messiah, some of the congregants proved indifferent to that contradictory fact and continued claiming that [[Chabad messianism#The belief that Schneerson would still be the Messiah after his death|Schneerson was the Messiah]], and that he would soon return from the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, David (2008).

===Induced compliance===
{{see also|Forced compliance theory}}
In the ''Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance'' (1959), the investigators Festinger and [[Merrill Carlsmith]] asked students to spend an hour doing tedious tasks; e.g. turning pegs a quarter-turn, at fixed intervals. The tasks were designed to induce a strong, negative, mental attitude in the subjects. Once the subjects had done the tasks, the experimenters asked one group of subjects to speak with another subject (an actor) and persuade that impostor-subject that the tedious tasks were interesting and engaging. Subjects of one group were paid twenty dollars ($20); those in a second group were paid one dollar ($1); and those in the control group were not asked to speak with the imposter-subject.

[[File:Clark Stanley's Snake Oil Liniment.png|thumb|After performing dissonant behavior ([[lie|lying]]) a person might find external, consonant elements. Therefore, a [[snake oil]] salesman might find a psychological self-justification (great profit) for promoting medical falsehoods, but, otherwise, might need to change his beliefs about the falsehoods.]]

At the conclusion of the study, when asked to rate the tedious tasks, the subjects of the second group (paid $1) rated the tasks more positively than did the subjects in the first group (paid $20) and than did the subjects of the control group; the responses of the paid subjects were evidence of cognitive dissonance. The researchers, Festinger and Carlsmith, proposed that the subjects experienced dissonance, between the conflicting cognitions: "I told someone that the task was interesting" and "I actually found it boring." Moreover, the subjects paid one dollar were induced to comply, compelled to internalize the "interesting task" mental attitude because they had no other justification. The subjects paid twenty dollars were induced to comply by way of an obvious, external justification for internalizing the "interesting task" mental attitude and, thus, experienced a lesser degree of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Festinger | first1 = L. | last2 = Carlsmith | first2 = J.M. | year = 1959 | title = Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance | url = http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Festinger/index.htm | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 203–210 | doi=10.1037/h0041593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Forbidden Behaviour paradigm
In the ''Effect of the Severity of Threat on the Devaluation of Forbidden Behavior'' (1963), a variant of the induced-compliance paradigm, by [[Elliot Aronson]] and Carlsmith, examined [[self-justification]] in children.&lt;ref name="aronson1963"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aronson | first1 = E. | last2 = Carlsmith | first2 = J.M. | year = 1963 | title = Effect of the Severity of Threat on the Devaluation of Forbidden Behavior | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 66 | issue = 6| pages = 584–588 | doi = 10.1037/h0039901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the experiment, children were left in a room with a variety of toys, including a greatly desirable steam shovel, the forbidden toy. Upon leaving the room, the experimenter told one-half of the group of children that there would be severe punishment if they played with the steam-shovel toy; and told the second half of the group that there would be a mild punishment for playing with the forbidden toy. All of the children refrained from playing with the forbidden toy (the steam shovel).&lt;ref name= "aronson1963"/&gt;

Later, when the children were told that they could freely play with any toy they wanted, the children in the mild-punishment group were less likely to play with the steam shovel (the forbidden toy), despite removal of the threat of mild punishment. The children threatened with mild punishment had to justify, to themselves, why they did not play with the forbidden toy. The degree of punishment, in itself, was insufficiently strong to resolve their cognitive dissonance; the children had to convince themselves that playing with the forbidden toy was not worth the effort.&lt;ref name=aronson1963 /&gt;

In ''The Efficacy of Musical Emotions Provoked by Mozart's Music for the Reconciliation of Cognitive Dissonance'' (2012), a variant of the forbidden-toy paradigm, indicated that listening to music reduces the development of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name=MasatakaPerlovsky_MusicReducesCognitiveDissonance&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep00694|title=The Efficacy of Musical Emotions Provoked by Mozart's Music for the Reconciliation of Cognitive Dissonance|journal=[[Scientific Reports]]|volume=2|year=2012|last1=Masataka|first1=Nobuo|last2=Perlovsky|first2=Leonid |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep00694.pdf}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without music in the background, the control group of four-year-old children were told to avoid playing with a forbidden toy. After playing alone, the control-group children later devalued the importance of the forbidden toy; however, in the variable group, classical music played in the background, while the children played alone. In that group, the children did not later devalue the forbidden toy. The researchers, Nobuo Masataka and Leonid Perlovsky, concluded that music might inhibit cognitions that reduce cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="MasatakaPerlovsky_MusicReducesCognitiveDissonance"/&gt;

Moreover, music is a stimulus that can diminish post-decisional dissonance; in an earlier experiment, ''Washing Away Postdecisional Dissonance'' (2010), the researchers indicated that the actions of hand-washing might inhibit the cognitions that reduce cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee |first1=Spike W. S. |last2=Schwarz |first2=Norbert |title=Washing Away Postdecisional Dissonance|journal=Science|date=May 2010|volume=328|doi=10.1126/science.1186799 |pmid=20448177 |issue=5979 |pages=709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free choice===
In the study ''Post-decision Changes in Desirability of Alternatives'' (1956) 225 female students rated a series of domestic appliances and then were asked to choose one of two appliances as a gift. The results of a second round of ratings indicated that the women students increased their ratings of the domestic appliance they had selected as a gift and decreased their ratings of the appliances they rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brehm | first1 = J. | year = 1956 | title = Post-decision Changes in Desirability of Alternatives | doi = 10.1037/h0041006 | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 384–389 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of cognitive dissonance occurs to a person faced with making a difficult decision, wherein there always exist aspects of the rejected-object not chosen, which appeal to the person making the choice. The action of deciding provokes the psychological dissonance consequent to choosing X instead of Y, despite little difference between X and Y; thus, the decision "I chose X" is dissonant with the cognition that "There are some aspects of Y that I like." Moreover, the study ''Choice-induced Preferences in the Absence of Choice: Evidence from a Blind Two-choice Paradigm with Young Children and Capuchin Monkeys'' (2010) reports similar results in the occurrence of cognitive dissonance in human beings and in animals.&lt;ref name="Egan et al."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Egan | first1 = L.C. | last2 = Bloom | first2 = P. | last3 = Santos | first3 = L.R. | year = 2010 | title = Choice-induced Preferences in the Absence of Choice: Evidence from a Blind Two-choice Paradigm with Young Children and Capuchin Monkeys | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2009.08.014 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 204–207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Peer Effects in Pro-Social Behavior: Social Norms or Social Preferences?'' (2013) indicated that, in addition to internal deliberation, the structuring of decisions among people can influence how a person acts individually. That social preferences and social norms are related, and function in line with wage-giving among three persons. The actions of the first person influenced{{clarify|date=October 2015}} the wage-giving actions of the second person. That inequity aversion is the paramount concern of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/jeea.12015|pmid=28553193|title=Peer Effects in Pro-Social Behavior: Social Norms or Social Preferences?|journal=Journal of the European Economic Association|volume=11|issue=3|pages=548–573|year=2013|last1=Gächter|first1=Simon|last2=Nosenzo|first2=Daniele|last3=Sefton|first3=Martin|ssrn=2010940}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effort justification===
{{further|Effort justification}}
Cognitive dissonance occurs to a person when he or she voluntarily engages in (physically or ethically) unpleasant activities in effort to achieve a desired goal. The mental stress caused by the dissonance can be reduced by the person's exaggerating the desirability of the goal. In ''The Effect of Severity of Initiation on Liking for a Group'' (1956), to qualify for admission to a discussion group, two groups of people underwent an embarrassing initiation, of varied psychologic severity. The first group of subjects were to read aloud twelve sexual words considered obscene; the second group of subjects were to read aloud twelve sexual words not considered obscene.

Both groups then were given headphones to unknowingly listen to a recorded discussion about animal sexual behaviour, which the researchers designed to be dull and banal. As the subjects of the experiment, the groups of people were told that the animal-sexuality discussion actually was occurring in the next room. The subjects whose strong initiation required reading aloud obscene words evaluated the people of their group as more-interesting persons than the people of the group who underwent the mild initiation to the discussion group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aronson | first1 = E. | last2 = Mills | first2 = J. | year = 1956 | title = The Effect of Severity of Initiation on Liking for a Group | url = http://faculty.uncfsu.edu/tvancantfort/Syllabi/Gresearch/Readings/A_Aronson.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 177–181 | doi=10.1037/h0047195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, in ''Washing Away Your Sins: Threatened Morality and Physical Cleansing'' (2006), the results indicated that a person washing his or her hands is an action that helps resolve post-decisional cognitive dissonance because the mental stress usually was caused by the person's ethical–moral self-disgust, which is an emotion related to the physical disgust caused by a dirty environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = S.W.S. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = N. | year = 2010 | title = Washing Away Postdecisional Dissonance | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/328/5979/709 | journal = Science | volume = 328 | issue = 5979| page = 709 | doi=10.1126/science.1186799 | pmid=20448177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhong | first1 = C.B. | last2 = Liljenquist | first2 = K. | year = 2006 | title = Washing Away Your Sins: Threatened Morality and Physical Cleansing | doi = 10.1126/science.1130726 | journal = Science | volume = 313 | issue = 5792| pages = 1451–1452 | pmid=16960010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Likewise, the study ''The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making'' (2011) indicated that participants rated 80 names and 80 paintings based on how much they liked the names and paintings. To give meaning to the decisions, the participants were asked to select names that they might give to their children. For rating the paintings, the participants were asked to base their ratings on whether or not they would display such art at home.

The results indicated that when the decision is meaningful to the person deciding value, the likely rating is based on his or her attitudes (positive, neutral, or negative) towards the name and towards the painting in question. The participants also were asked to rate some of the objects twice and believed that, at session's end, they would receive two of the paintings they had positively rated. The results indicated a great increase in the positive attitude of the participant towards the liked pair of things, whilst also increasing the negative attitude towards the disliked pair of things. The double-ratings of pairs of things, towards which the rating participant had a neutral attitude, showed no changes during the rating period. Therefore, the existing attitudes of the participant were reinforced during the rating period, and the participants suffered cognitive dissonance when confronted by a liked-name paired with a disliked-painting.&lt;ref&gt;Jarcho, J. M., Berkman, E. T., &amp; Lieberman, M. D. (2011). “The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making”, ''Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience'', 6(4), 460–467. doi:10.1093/scan/nsq054

=== Unpleasant medical screenings ===
In the study ''Cognitive Dissonance and Attitudes Toward Unpleasant Medical Screenings '' (2016), the researchers Michael R. Ent and Mary A Gerend informed the study participants about a discomforting test for a specific (fictitious) virus called the "human respiratory virus-27". The study used a fake virus to prevent participants from having thoughts, opinions, and feeling about the virus that would interfere with the experiment. The study participants were in two groups; one group was told that they were actual candidates for the virus-27 test, and the second group were told they were not candidates for the test. The researchers reported, "We predicted that [study] participants who thought that they were candidates for the unpleasant test would experience dissonance associated with knowing that the test was both unpleasant and in their best interest—this dissonance was predicted to result in unfavorable attitudes toward the test."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ent|first=Michael R.|last2=Gerend|first2=Mary A.|date=September 2016|title=Cognitive Dissonance and Attitudes Toward Unpleasant Medical Screenings|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|volume=21|issue=9|pages=2075–2084|doi=10.1177/1359105315570986|issn=1461-7277|pmid=27535832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications==
=== Education ===
The management of cognitive dissonance readily influences the [[motivation]] of a student to pursue education.&lt;ref name="Aronson1995"&gt;Aronson, E. (1995).'' The Social Animal'' (1995), New York: W.H. Freeman and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The study ''Turning Play into Work: Effects of Adult Surveillance and Extrinsic Rewards on Children’s Intrinsic Motivation'' (1975) indicated that the application of the [[effort justification]] paradigm increased student enthusiasm for education with the offer of an external reward for studying; students in pre-school who completed puzzles based upon an adult promise of reward were later less interested in the puzzles than were students who completed the puzzle-tasks without the promise of a reward.&lt;ref name="LepperandGreene1975"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lepper | first1 = M.

The incorporation of cognitive dissonance into models of basic learning-processes to foster the students’ [[self-awareness]] of psychological conflicts among their personal beliefs, [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s, and [[values]] and the reality of contradictory facts and information, requires the students to defend their personal beliefs. Afterwards, the  students are trained to objectively perceive new facts and information to resolve the [[psychological stress]] of the conflict between reality and the student's value system.&lt;ref name="GuzzettiSnyderGlassandGamas1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guzzetti | first1 = B.J. | last2 = Snyder | first2 = T.E. | last3 = Glass | first3 = G.V. | last4 = Gamas | first4 = W.S. | year = 1993 | title = Promoting Conceptual Change in Science: A Comparative Meta-analysis of Instructional Interventions from Reading Education and Science Education | journal = Reading Research Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 116–159 | jstor=747886 | doi=10.2307/747886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[educational software]] that applies the derived principles facilitates the students’ ability to successfully handle the questions posed in a complex subject.&lt;ref name="GraesserBaggettandWilliams1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graesser | first1 = A.

=== Psychotherapy ===
The general effectiveness of [[psychotherapy]] and [[psychological intervention]] is partly explained by the theory of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="Cooper2007"&gt;Cooper, J. (2007). Cognitive Dissonance: 50 Years of a Classic Theory. London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; In that vein, [[social psychology]] proposed that the mental health of the patient is positively influenced by his and her action in freely choosing a specific [[therapy]] and in exerting the required, therapeutic effort to overcome cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="CooperAxsom1982"&gt;Cooper, J., &amp; Axsom, D. (1982). Integration of Clinical and Social Psychology. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; That effective phenomenon was indicated in the results of the study ''Effects of Choice on Behavioral Treatment of Overweight Children'' (1983), wherein the children's belief that they freely chose the type of therapy received, resulted in each overweight child losing a greater amount of excessive body weight.&lt;ref name="MendoncaBrehm1983"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mendonca | first1 = P.

In the study ''Reducing Fears and Increasing Attentiveness: The Role of Dissonance Reduction '' (1980), people afflicted with [[ophidiophobia]] (fear of snakes) who invested much effort in activities of little therapeutic value for them (experimentally represented as legitimate and relevant) showed improved alleviation of the symptoms of their [[phobia]].&lt;ref name="Cooper1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = J. | year = 1980 | title = Reducing Fears and Increasing Attentiveness: The Role of Dissonance Reduction | doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(80)90064-5 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 452–460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the results of ''Cognitive Dissonance and Psychotherapy: The Role of Effort Justification in Inducing Weight Loss'' (1985) indicated that the patient felt better in justifying his or her efforts and therapeutic choices towards effectively losing weight.

===Social behavior ===

Cognitive dissonance can be applied in social areas such as racism and racial hatred.  Acharya of Stanford, Blackwell and Sen of Harvard state CD increases when an individual commits an act of violence toward someone from a different ethnic or racial group and decreases when the individual does not commit any such act of violence. Research from Acharya, Blackwell and Sen shows that individuals committing violence against members of another group will develop hostile attitudes towards their victims as a way of minimizing CD. Importantly, the hostile attitudes may persist even after the violence itself declines (Acharya, Blackwell, Sen 2015). The application provides a social psychological basis for the constructivist viewpoint that ethnic and racial divisions can be socially or individually constructed, possibly from acts of violence (Fearon and Laitin, 2000). Their framework speaks to this possibility by showing how violent actions by individuals can affect individual attitudes, either ethnic or racial animosity (Acharya, Blackwell, Sen 2015).

=== Consumer behavior&lt;!-- This section is not an application of research, and is questionable regarding ethics --&gt; ===
Three  main conditions exist for provoking cognitive dissonance when buying: (i) The decision to purchase must be important, such as the sum of money to spend; (ii) The psychological cost; and (iii)  The purchase is personally relevant to the consumer. The consumer is free to select from the alternatives, and the decision to buy is irreversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gbadamosi|first=Ayantunji|title=Cognitive Dissonance: The Implicit Explication in Low-income Consumers' Shopping Behaviour for "Low-involvement" Grocery Products|journal=International Journal of Retail &amp; Distribution Management|date=January 2009|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1077–1095|doi= 10.1108/09590550911005038|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study ''Beyond Reference Pricing: Understanding Consumers' Encounters with Unexpected Prices '' (2003), indicated that when consumers experience an unexpected price encounter, they adopt three methods to reduce cognitive dissonance: (i) Employ a strategy of continual information; (ii) Employ a change in attitude; and (iii)  Engage in [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimisation]]. Consumers employ the strategy of continual information by engaging in bias and searching for information that supports prior beliefs. Consumers might search for information about other retailers and substitute products consistent with their beliefs. Alternatively, consumers might change attitude, such as re-evaluating price in relation to external reference-prices or associating high prices and low prices with quality. Minimisation reduces the importance of the elements of the dissonance; consumers tend to minimise the importance of money, and thus of shopping around, saving, and finding a better deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mullikin|first=Lindsey J|title=Beyond Reference Pricing: Understanding Consumers' Encounters with Unexpected Prices|journal=Journal of Products &amp; Brand Management|year=2003|volume=12|issue=3|pages=140–153|doi=10.1108/10610420310476906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
Cognitive dissonance theory might suggest that since votes are an expression of preference or beliefs, even the act of voting might cause someone to defend the actions of the candidate for whom they voted,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cognitive-dissonance-politics-prabhakar-mundkur/|title=Is there Cognitive Dissonance in Politics?|date=2016-07-11|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if the decision was close then the effects of cognitive dissonance should be greater.

This effect was studied over the 6 presidential elections of the United States between 1972 and 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beasley|first=Ryan K.|last2=Joslyn|first2=Mark R.|date=2001-09-01|title=Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Attitude Change in Six Presidential Elections|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0162-895X.00252/abstract|journal=Political Psychology|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=521–540|doi=10.1111/0162-895X.00252|issn=1467-9221}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was found that the opinion differential between the candidates changed more before and after the election than the opinion differential of non-voters. In addition, elections where the voter had a favorable attitude toward both candidates, making the choice more difficult, had the opinion differential of the candidates change more dramatically than those who only had a favorable opinion of one candidate. What wasn't studied were the cognitive dissonance effects in cases where the person had unfavorable attitudes toward both candidates. Since the U.S. 2016 election held historically high unfavorable ratings for both candidates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/22/politics/2016-election-poll-donald-trump-hillary-clinton/index.html|title=Poll: Trump, Clinton score historic unfavorable ratings|last=CNN|first=David Wright,|work=CNN|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; it might be a good case study to examine the cognitive dissonance effects in these instances.

From the perspective of ''The Theory of Cognitive Dissonance: A Current Perspective'' (1969), the lawyer might experience cognitive dissonance if his false statement about his guilty client contradicts his identity as a lawyer and an honest man.]]

=== Self-perception theory===
In ''The Gestalt Theory of Motivation'' (1960), the social psychologist [[Daryl Bem]] proposed the [[self-perception theory]] whereby people do not think much about their attitudes, even when engaged in a conflict with another person. The Theory of Self-perception proposes that people develop attitudes by observing their own behaviour, and concludes that their attitudes caused the behaviour observed by self-perception; especially true when internal cues either are ambiguous or weak. Therefore, the person is in the same position as an observer who must rely upon external cues to infer his or her inner state of mind. Self-perception theory proposes that people adopt attitudes without access to their states of mood and cognition.&lt;ref name="Heider, F. 1960"&gt;Heider, F. (1960). The Gestalt Theory of Motivation. Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, 8, pp. 145–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, the experimental subjects of the Festinger and Carlsmith study (''Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance'', 1959) inferred their mental attitudes from their own behaviour. When the subject-participants were asked: "Did you find the task interesting?", the participants decided that they must have found the task interesting, because that is what they told the questioner. Their replies suggested that the participants who were paid twenty dollars had an external incentive to adopt that positive attitude, and likely perceived the twenty dollars as the reason for saying the task was interesting, rather than saying the task actually was interesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bem | first1 = D.J. | year = 1965 | title = An Experimental Analysis of Self-persuasion|doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(65)90026-0 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 199–218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bem | first1 = D.J. | year = 1967 | title = Self-perception: An Alternative Interpretation of Cognitive Dissonance Phenomena | url = http://dbem.ws/SP%20Theory%20Cognitive%20Dissonance.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 74 | issue = 3| pages = 183–200 | doi=10.1037/h0024835 | pmid=5342882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of self-perception (Bem) and the theory of cognitive dissonance (Festinger) make identical predictions, but only the theory of cognitive dissonance predicts the presence of unpleasant [[arousal]], of psychological distress, which were verified in laboratory experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zanna | first1 = M. | last2 = Cooper | first2 = J. | year = 1974 | title = Dissonance and the Pill: An Attribution Approach to Studying the Arousal Properties of Dissonance | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1974-32359-001 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 703–709 | doi=10.1037/h0036651| pmid = 4833431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kiesler | first1 = C.A. | last2 = Pallak | first2 = M.S. | year = 1976 | title = Arousal Properties of Dissonance Manipulations | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1977-21057-001 | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 83 | issue = 6| pages = 1014–1025 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.83.6.1014| pmid = 996211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Theory of Cognitive Dissonance: A Current Perspective'' (1969), [[Elliot Aronson]] linked cognitive dissonance to the [[self-concept]]: That mental stress arises when the conflicts among cognitions threatens the person's positive self-image. This reinterpretation of the original Festinger and Carlsmith study, using the induced-compliance paradigm, proposed that the dissonance was between the cognitions "I am an honest person." and "I lied about finding the task interesting."&lt;ref name="Aronson, E. 1969 pp. 1–34"&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60075-1|chapter=The Theory of Cognitive Dissonance: A Current Perspective|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|volume=4|pages=1–34|year=1969|last1=Aronson|first1=Elliot|isbn=9780120152049|publisher=Academic Press|editor-first1=Leonard |editor-last1=Berkowitz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study ''Cognitive Dissonance: Private Ratiocination or Public Spectacle?'' (1971) reported that maintaining cognitive consistency, rather than protecting a private self-concept, is how a person protects his or her public [[self-image]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tedeschi | first1 = J.T. | last2 = Schlenker | first2 = B.R. | last3 = Bonoma | first3 = T.V. | year = 1971 | title = Cognitive Dissonance: Private Ratiocination or Public Spectacle? | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 26 | issue = 8| pages = 685–695 | doi = 10.1037/h0032110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the results reported in the study ''I’m No Longer Torn After Choice: How Explicit Choices Implicitly Shape Preferences of Odors'' (2010) contradict such an explanation, by showing the occurrence of revaluation of material items, after the person chose and decided, even after having forgotten the choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coppin | first1 = G. | last2 = Delplanque | first2 = S. | last3 = Cayeux | first3 = I. | last4 = Porcherot | first4 = C. | last5 = Sander | first5 = D. | year = 2010 | title = I'm No Longer Torn After Choice: How Explicit Choices Implicitly Shape Preferences of Odors | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 21 | issue = 8| pages = 489–493 | pmid = 20424088 | doi=10.1177/0956797610364115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Balance theory===
{{main|Balance theory}}
[[Fritz Heider]] proposed a motivational theory of attitude change that functions on the idea that humans are driven to establish and maintain psychological balance.  This drive is known as the consistency motive—the urge to maintain one's values and beliefs over time.
According to balance theory there are three things interacting: (1) you (P), (2) another person (O), and (3) an element (X).  These are each positioned at one point of a triangle and share two relations:&lt;ref name="Heider, F. 1960"/&gt;
# ''Unit relations'' – things and people that belong together based on similarity, proximity, fate, etc.
# ''Sentiment relations'' – evaluations of people and things (liking, disliking)

As people, human beings seek a balanced state of relations among three positions; 3 positives or 2 negatives, 1 positive:
 P = you
 O = John
 X = John's dog
::"I don't like John"
::"John has a dog"
::"I don't like the dog either"

People also avoid unbalanced states of relations; 3 negatives or 2 positives, 1 negative)
 P = you
 O = your child
 X = picture your child drew
::"I love my child"
::"She drew me this picture"
::"I love this picture"

===Cost–benefit analysis===
In the study ''On the Measurement of the Utility of Public Works'' (1969), [[Jules Dupuit]] reported that behaviors and cognitions can be understood from an economic perspective, wherein people engage in the systematic processing of comparing the costs and benefits of a decision. The psychological process of cost-benefit comparisons helps the person to assess and justify the feasibility (spending money) of an economic decision, and is the basis for determining if the benefit outweighs the cost, and to what extent. Moreover, although the method of cost-benefit analysis functions in economic circumstances, men and women remain psychologically inefficient at comparing the costs against the benefits of their economic decision.&lt;ref&gt;Dupuit, J. (1969). “On the Measurement of the Utility of Public Works”, ''Readings in Welfare''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-discrepancy theory===

[[E. Tory Higgins]] proposed that people have three selves, to which they compare themselves:

# ''Actual self'' – representation of the attributes the person believes him- or herself to possess (basic self-concept)
# ''Ideal self'' – ideal attributes the person would like to possess (hopes, aspiration, motivations to change)
# ''Ought self'' – ideal attributes the person believes he or she should possess (duties, obligations, responsibilities)

When these self-guides are contradictory psychological distress (cognitive dissonance) results. People are motivated to reduce [[self-discrepancy theory|self-discrepancy]] (the gap between two self-guides).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=3615707|year=1987|author1=Higgins|first1=E. T.|title=Self-discrepancy: A Theory Relating Self and Affect|journal=Psychological Review|volume=94|issue=3|pages=319–340|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.94.3.319|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/higgins/papers/HIGGINS%3DPSYCH%20REVIEW%201987.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074101/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/higgins/papers/HIGGINS%3DPSYCH%20REVIEW%201987.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Averse consequences vs. inconsistency===
During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio argued that dissonance was caused by aversive consequences, rather than inconsistency. According to this interpretation, the belief that lying is wrong and hurtful, not the inconsistency between cognitions, is what makes people feel bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60121-5|chapter=A New Look at Dissonance Theory|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|volume=17|pages=229–266|year=1984|last1=Cooper|first1=Joel|last2=Fazio|first2=Russell H.|isbn=9780120152179|editor-first=Leonard|editor-last= Berkowitz|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even when they feel they have not done anything wrong. For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when the consequences of their statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E. | last2 = Brehm | first2 = J.W. | last3 = Greenberg | first3 = J. | last4 = Simon | first4 = L. | last5 = Nelson | first5 = D.E. | year = 1996 | title = Evidence that the production of aversive consequences is not necessary to create cognitive dissonance | url = http://www.socialemotiveneuroscience.org/pubs/hj_etal96.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 70 | issue = 1| pages = 5–16 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the free-choice paradigm===
In the study ''How Choice Affects and Reflects Preferences: Revisiting the Free-choice Paradigm'' (2010) the researchers criticized the free-choice paradigm as invalid, because the rank-choice-rank method is inaccurate for the study of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = M.K. | last2 = Risen | first2 = J.L. | year = 2010 | title = How Choice Affects and Reflects Preferences: Revisiting the Free-choice Paradigm | doi = 10.1037/a0020217 | pmid = 20658837 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 99 | issue = 4| pages = 573–594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That the designing of research-models relies upon the assumption that, if the experimental subject rates options differently in the second survey, then the attitudes of the subject towards the options have changed. That there are other reasons why an experimental subject might achieve different rankings in the second survey; perhaps the subjects were indifferent between choices.

Although the results of some follow-up studies (e.g. ''Do Choices Affect Preferences? Some Doubts and New Evidence'', 2013) presented evidence of the unreliability of the rank-choice-rank method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2012.00983.x|title=Do Choices Affect Preferences?

===Action–motivation model===
The action–motivation model proposes that inconsistencies in a person's cognition cause mental stress, because psychologic inconsistency interferes with the person's functioning in the [[Reality|real world]]. Among the ways for coping, the person can choose to exercise a behavior that is inconsistent with his or her current attitude (a belief, an ideal, a value system), but later try to alter that belief to be consonant with a current behaviour; the cognitive dissonance occurs when the person's cognition does not match the action taken. If the person changes the current attitude, after the dissonance occurs, he or she then is obligated to commit to that course of behaviour.

The occurrence of cognitive dissonance produces a state of [[affect (psychology)|negative affect]], which motivates the person to reconsider the causative behaviour, in order to resolve the psychologic inconsistency that caused the mental stress.&lt;ref&gt;(Beckmann and Kuhl, 1984, Harmon-Jones, 1999, Harmon-Jones, 2000a, Jones and Gerard, 1967, McGregor et al., 1999 and Newby-Clark ''et al.'', 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; As the afflicted person works towards a behavioural commitment, the motivational process then is activated in the left [[frontal cortex]] of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beckmann | first1 = J | last2 = Kuhl | first2 = J | year = 1984 | title = Altering Information to Gain Action Control: Functional Aspects of Human Information Processing in Decision Making | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 224–237 | doi=10.1016/0092-6566(84)90031-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harmon-Jones, E. 1999. pp. 71"&gt;Harmon-Jones, E., 1999. “Toward an Understanding of the Motivation Underlying Dissonance Processes: Is Feeling Personally Responsible for the Production of Aversive Consequences Necessary to Cause Dissonance Effects?” in ''Cognitive Dissonance: Perspectives on a Pivotal Theory in Social Psychology''.

===Predictive dissonance model===
The predictive dissonance model proposes that cognitive dissonance is fundamentally related to the [[predictive coding]] (or predictive processing) model of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaaronen | first1 = R.O. | year = 2018 | title = A Theory of Predictive Dissonance: Predictive Processing Presents a New Take on Cognitive Dissonance | url = https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02218/full | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 9| issue = | pages = 1–15 | doi=10.1177/01461672002612004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A predictive processing account of the mind proposes that perception actively involves the use of a [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] hierarchy of acquired prior knowledge, which primarily serves the role of predicting incoming [[proprioception|proprioceptive]], [[interoception|interoceptive]] and [[exteroception|exteroceptive]] sensory inputs. Therefore, the brain is an inference machine which attempts to actively predict and explain its sensations. Crucial to this inference is the minimization of [[predictive coding|prediction error]]. The predictive dissonance account proposes that the motivation for cognitive dissonance reduction is related to an organism's active drive for reducing prediction error. Moreover, it proposes that human (and perhaps other animal) brains have evolved to selectively ignore contradictory information (as proposed by dissonance theory) to prevent the [[overfitting]] of their predictive cognitive models to local and thus non-generalizable conditions. The predictive dissonance account is highly compatible with the action-motivation model since, in practice, prediction error can arise from unsuccessful behavior.

== Neuroscience findings ==
=== Visualisation ===
The study ''Neural Activity Predicts Attitude Change in Cognitive Dissonance'' (2009) identified the neural bases of cognitive dissonance with [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI); the neural scans of the participants replicated the basic findings of the induced-compliance paradigm. When in the fMRI scanner, some of the study participants argued that the uncomfortable, mechanical environment of the MRI machine nevertheless was a pleasant experience for them; some participants, from an experimental group, said they enjoyed the mechanical environment of the fMRI scanner more than did the control-group participants (paid actors) who argued about the uncomfortable experimental environment.&lt;ref name="psych.ucsb.edu"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Veen | first1 = V. | last2 = Krug | first2 = M.K. | last3 = Schooler | first3 = J.W. | last4 = Carter | first4 = C.S. | year = 2009 | title = Neural Activity Predicts Attitude Change in Cognitive Dissonance | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26817210_Neural_Activity_Predicts_Attitude_Change_in_Cognitive_Dissonance/file/3deec51b8bf291652a.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 12 | issue = 11| pages = 1469–1474 | doi=10.1038/nn.2413| pmid = 19759538 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the neural scan experiment support the original theory of Cognitive Dissonance proposed by Festinger in 1957; and also support the psychological conflict theory, whereby the anterior cingulate functions, in counter-attitudinal response, to activate the dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and the anterior [[insular cortex]]; the degree of activation of said regions of the brain is predicted by the degree of change in the psychological attitude of the person.&lt;ref name="psych.ucsb.edu"/&gt;
[[File:MRI anterior cingulate.png|thumb|right|400px|The biomechanics of cognitive dissonance: MRI evidence indicates that the greater the psychological conflict signalled by the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], the greater the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance experienced by the person.]]

As an application of the free-choice paradigm, the study ''How Choice Reveals and Shapes Expected Hedonic Outcome'' (2009) indicates that after making a choice, neural activity in the [[striatum]] changes to reflect the person's new evaluation of the choice-object; neural activity increased if the object was chosen, neural activity decreased if the object was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharot | first1 = T. | last2 = De Martino | first2 = B. | last3 = Dolan | first3 = R.J. | year = 2009 | title = How Choice Reveals and Shapes Expected Hedonic Outcome | url = http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~tsharot/Sharot_JofN_2009.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 29 | issue = 12 | pages = 3760–3765 | doi = 10.1523/jneurosci.4972-08.2009 | pmid = 19321772 | pmc = 2675705 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110617053852/http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~tsharot/Sharot_JofN_2009.pdf | archivedate = 2011-06-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, studies such as ''The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making'' (2010)&lt;ref name=JarchoEtAl_NeuralBasisRationalization&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarcho|first1=Johanna M.|last2=Berkman|first2=Elliot T.|last3=Lieberman|first3=Matthew D.|title=The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making|journal=Social Cognitive Affective Neuroscience|year=2010|doi=10.1093/scan/nsq054|pmid=20621961|volume=6|issue=4|pages=460–467|pmc=3150852}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''How Choice Modifies Preference: Neural Correlates of Choice Justification'' (2011) confirm the neural bases of the psychology of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="Izuma et al."/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Qin | first1 = J. | last2 = Kimel | first2 = S. | last3 = Kitayama | first3 = S. | last4 = Wang | first4 = X. | last5 = Yang | first5 = X. | last6 = Han | first6 = S. | year = 2011 | title = How Choice Modifies Preference: Neural Correlates of Choice Justification | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.11.076 | pmid = 21130888 | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 240–246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making'' (2010) applied the free-choice paradigm to fMRI examination of the brain's decision-making process whilst the study participant actively tried to reduce cognitive dissonance. The results indicated that the active reduction of psychological dissonance increased neural activity in the right-[[inferior frontal gyrus]], in the medial fronto-parietal region, and in the [[ventral striatum]], and that neural activity decreased in the [[anterior insula]].&lt;ref name=JarchoEtAl_NeuralBasisRationalization /&gt; That the neural activities of [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] occur in seconds, without conscious deliberation on the part of the person; and that the brain engages in emotional responses whilst effecting decisions.&lt;ref name=JarchoEtAl_NeuralBasisRationalization /&gt;

=== Emotional correlations ===
The results reported in ''Contributions from Research on Anger and Cognitive Dissonance to Understanding the Motivational Functions of Asymmetrical Frontal Brain Activity'' (2004) indicate that the occurrence of cognitive dissonance is associated with neural activity in the [[Frontal cortex|left frontal cortex]], a brain structure also associated with the emotion of [[anger]]; moreover, functionally, anger motivates neural activity in the left frontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Harmon-Jones, 1999 and 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Applying a directional model of [[Motivation|Approach motivation]], the study ''Anger and the Behavioural Approach System'' (2003) indicated that the relation between cognitive dissonance and anger is supported by neural activity in the left frontal cortex that occurs when a person takes control of the social situation causing the cognitive dissonance. Conversely, if the person cannot control or cannot change the psychologically stressful situation, he or she is without a motivation to change the circumstance, then there arise other, negative emotions to manage the cognitive dissonance, such as socially inappropriate behavior.&lt;ref name="Harmon-Jones, E. 1999. pp. 71"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E | year = 2003 | title = Anger and the Behavioural Approach System | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 995–1005 | doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(02)00313-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E | year = 2004 | title = Contributions from Research on Anger and Cognitive Dissonance to Understanding the Motivational Functions of Asymmetrical Frontal Brain Activity | url = | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 67| issue = 1–2| pages = 51–76 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2004.03.003 | pmid = 15130525 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anterior cingulate cortex activity increases when errors occur and are being monitored as well as having behavioral conflicts with the self-concept as a form of higher-level thinking.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amodio | first1 = D.M | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E | last3 = Devine | first3 = P.G | last4 = Curtin | first4 = J.J | last5 = Hartley | first5 = S | year = 2004 | title = A Covert Neural signals for the control of unintentional race bias | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 88–93 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.01502003.x| pmid = 14738514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study was done to test the prediction that the left frontal cortex would have increased activity. University students had to write a paper depending on if they were assigned to a high-choice or low-choice condition. The low-choice condition required student to write about supporting a 10% increase in tuition at their university. The point of this condition was to see how significant the counterchoice may affect a person's ability to cope. The high-choice condition asked students to write in favor of tuition increase as if it was their choice and that it was completely voluntary. EEG was used to analyze students before writing the essay as dissonance is at its highest during this time (Beauvois and Joule, 1996). High-choice condition participants showed a higher level of the left frontal cortex than the low-choice participants. Results have shown that the initial experience of dissonance can be apparent in the anterior cingulate cortex, then the left frontal cortex is activated, which also activates the approach motivational system to reduce anger.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beauvois, J. L., Joule, R. V., 1996. A radical dissonance theory. London: Taylor and Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The psychology of mental stress ===
The results reported in ''The Origins of Cognitive Dissonance: Evidence from Children and Monkeys'' (2007) indicated that there might be [[Evolution|evolutionary force]] behind the reduction of cognitive dissonance in the actions of pre-school-age children and [[Capuchin monkey]]s when offered a choice between two like options, decals and candies. The groups then were offered a new choice, between the choice-object not chosen and a novel choice-object that was as attractive as the first object. The resulting choices of the human and simian subjects concorded with the theory of cognitive dissonance when the children and the monkeys each chose the novel choice-object instead of the choice-object not chosen in the first selection, despite every object having the same value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Egan | first1 = L.C. | last2 = Santos | first2 = L.R. | last3 = Bloom | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = The Origins of Cognitive Dissonance: Evidence from Children and Monkeys | url = http://courses.washington.edu/evpsych/Egan%20Santos%20Bloom%20-%20origins%20cog%20diss%20-%20Psy%20Sci%202007.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 18 | issue = 11| pages = 978–983 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.02012.x| pmid = 17958712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis of ''An Action-based Model of Cognitive-dissonance Processes'' (2015) proposed that psychological dissonance occurs consequent to the stimulation of thoughts that interfere with a goal-driven behavior. Researchers mapped the neural activity of the participant when performing tasks that provoked [[psychological stress]] when engaged in contradictory behaviors. A participant read aloud the printed name of a color. To test for the occurrence of cognitive dissonance, the name of the color was printed in a color different than the word read aloud by the participant. As a result, the participants experienced increased neural activity in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] when the experimental exercises provoked psychological dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harmon-Jones|first=E|last2=Harmon-Jones|first2=C|last3=Levy|first3=N|date=2015|title=An Action-based Model of Cognitive-dissonance Processes|doi=10.1177/0963721414566449|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=24|issue=3|pages=184–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study ''Cognitive Neuroscience of Social Emotions and Implications for Psychopathology: Examining Embarrassment, Guilt, Envy, and Schadenfreude'' (2014) identified neural correlations to specific social emotions (e.g. envy and embarrassment) as a measure of cognitive dissonance. The neural activity for the emotion of [[Envy]] (the feeling of displeasure at the good fortune of another person) was found to draw neural activity from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. That such increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex occurred either when a person's [[self-concept]] was threatened or when the person suffered embarrassment (social pain) caused by salient, upward social-comparison, by social-class [[snobbery]]. That social emotions, such as embarrassment, guilt, envy, and ''Schadenfreude'' (joy at the misfortune of another person) are correlated to reduced activity in the [[insular lobe]], and with increased activity in the [[Striatum|striate nucleus]]; those neural activities are associated with a reduced sense of [[empathy]] (social responsibility) and an increased propensity towards antisocial behavior (delinquency).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jankowski|first=K|last2=Takahashi|first2=H|date=2014|title=Cognitive Neuroscience of Social Emotions and Implications for Psychopathology: Examining Embarrassment, Guilt, Envy, and Schadenfreude|journal=Psychiatry &amp; Clinical Neurosciences|volume=68|issue=5|pages=319–336|doi=10.1111/pcn.12182|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260947954_Cognitive_neuroscience_of_social_emotions_and_implications_for_psychopathology_Examining_embarrassment_guilt_envy_and_schadenfreude}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modeling in neural networks ==
[[Artificial neural network]] models of cognition provide methods for integrating the results of empirical research and of cognitive dissonance and attitudes into a single model that explains the formation of psychological attitudes and the mechanisms to change such attitudes.&lt;ref name="read1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Read | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Vanman | first2 = E.J. | last3 = Miller | first3 = L.C. | year = 1997 | title = Connectionism, Parallel Constraint Satisfaction Processes, and Gestalt Principles: (Re)Introducing Cognitive Dynamics to Social Psychology | doi = 10.1207/s15327957pspr0101_3 | pmid = 15647127 | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 26–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the artificial neural-network models that predict how cognitive dissonance might influence a person's attitudes and behavior, are:

The '''Conseil de l'Entente''' ("Council of Accord" or "Council of Understanding") is a [[West Africa]]n regional co-operation forum established in May 1959 by [[Ivory Coast]], [[Niger]], [[Republic of Upper Volta|Upper Volta]] (now [[Burkina Faso]]) and [[Republic of Dahomey|Dahomey]] (now [[Benin]]), and joined in 1966 by [[Togo]].

The body grew out of the short-lived [[Sahel-Benin Union]], itself created by the four original Council members as a partial successor to the dissolved [[France|French]] regional colonial federation of [[French West Africa]].

Since 1966 the Council has possessed a permanent administrative Secretariat based in [[Abidjan]], the largest city of Ivory Coast. A Mutual Aid and Loan Guarantee Fund exists to assist poorer members from a common pool.

In [[law]], to '''distinguish''' a [[Legal case|case]] means a court decides the legal reasoning of a [[precedent]] case will not wholly apply due to [[Materiality (law)|materially]] different facts between the two cases. If distinguishing, two formal constraints must be apparent in the judgment of the later court: the expressed factors or relevant considerations in the ''[[Ratio_decidendi|ratio]]'' (legal reasoning) of the earlier case must be re-used or stated to apply but for an additional fact not envisaged by the earlier court, and the ruling in the later case must not expressly doubt (criticise) the result reached in the precedent case.

The ruling made by the judge or panel of judges must be based on the evidence at hand and the standard [[Binding Precedent|binding precedent]]s covering the subject-matter (they must be ''followed''). 

==Definition==

In [[law]], to '''distinguish''' a [[Legal case|case]] means a court decides the [[Holding (law)|holding]] or legal reasoning of a [[precedent]] case will not apply due to [[Materiality (law)|materially]] different facts between the two cases.&lt;ref&gt;Malleson, Kate and Moules, Richard. ''The Legal System.'' [[Oxford University Press]]. 2010. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZZmcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;q=%22if%20there%20are%20materially%20different%20facts%2C%20the%20court%20may%20distinguish%20the%20case%22 p.69]&lt;/ref&gt; Two formal constraints constrain the later court: the expressed relevant factors (also known as considerations, tests, questions or determinants) in the ''[[Ratio_decidendi|ratio]]'' (legal reasoning) of the earlier case must be recited or their equivalent recited or the earlier case makes an exception for their application in the [[obiter|circumstances otherwise it envisages]], and the ruling in the later case must not expressly doubt (criticise) the result reached in the precedent case.&lt;ref name="distinguish stanford"&gt;Lamond, Grant. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-reas-prec/index.html#PreLayDowRul "Precedent and Analogy in Legal Reasoning: 2.1 Precedents as laying down rules:] 2.1.2 The practice of distinguishing". ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.'' [[Stanford University]]. 2006-06-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling made by the judge or panel of judges must be based on the evidence at hand and the standard [[binding authority|binding authorities]] covering the subject-matter and areas of law cited in or plainly relevant to the dispute (they must be ''followed''). 

This means that a precedent will be dealt to (in English and Scottish law known instead as ''applied to'') a case with similar facts, in which a decision can then be distinguished based upon this, or it may be cited with approval but found to be inapplicable on bases reconcilable with the earlier decision's reasoning.

===Wide and narrow distinguishment===
Where a wide new class of distinguished cases is made, such as distinguishing all cases on [[privity (law)|privity of contract law]] in the establishment of the court-made [[tort]] of [[negligence]] or a case turns on too narrow a set of variations in facts ("turns on its own facts") compared to the routinely applicable precedent(s), such decisions are at high risk of being successfully overruled (by higher courts) on the bases respectively that:
#The lower court has invented the law&lt;ref&gt;See: http://www.law.uwa.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/1838186/Example_Development-of-law-negligence.pdf Development of the Law of Negligence in Australia, following Scottish specifically in the UK supreme court (House of Lords) which distinguished all cases on privity of contract, which apparently applied to most earlier observers before the new law in 1932 was fully formulated.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The lower court has failed to follow a binding precedent

==Examples==
''[[Balfour v Balfour]]'' (1919) and ''[[Merritt v Merritt]]'' (1970) were cases involving the enforceability of maintenance agreements. In each case a wife sued her husband, alleging [[breach of contract]].  The judge in Balfour held the claim could not be sustained without evidence of intention to create legal regulations, so there was no legally binding contract. By contrast, in Merritt v Merritt, the judge distinguished ''Balfour'', deciding that the facts were materially different in that: (i) the husband and wife were separated and no longer "in amity"; and (ii) the agreement was made '''after''' they had separated, and '''in writing'''.

In ''[[Read v Lyons]]'' 1947,&lt;ref&gt;''Read v Lyons'' [1947] AC 156  House of Lords[http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/cases/Read-v-Lyons.php]&lt;/ref&gt; (where a munitions worker was injured in a factory explosion), the court distinguished ''[[Rylands v Fletcher]]'' 1868 because in the present case, even though the defendant factory kept "dangerous things on the land for a non-natural user", there was '''no escape'''.

==Obiter followed==
Where an ''[[obiter dictum]]'' (a non-binding statement based on hypothetical facts) is subsequent followed and adopted, then the later case is said to "approve" that ''obiter'', and the earlier case may be marked "approved",  "followed", or "obiter followed".

'''''Divine Action and Modern Science''''' (2002) is a book written by Nicholas Saunders. It looks at [[Near East]]ern biblical and modern theological approaches to the idea of [[Divine Providence|divine action]], covering such questions as how divine action occurs, what its effects are, the relationship between divine and finite causation and complementarity versus [[mutually exclusive|mutual exclusivity]]. Saunders concludes that God is active in the physical world, but not as described by traditional accounts.&lt;ref&gt;David Atkinson, Words and works, ''[[Times Literary Supplement]],'' January 9, 2004 issue 5258 p27(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this book, Saunders differentiates between general and special divine action, with the former referring to the actions of God concerning the entirety of the natural order (initial creation and continual sustenance), and the latter pointing to the actions of God with regards to a particular time and place (such as a particular divine intervention or responses to prayer).

The author’s categorical disagreement with current endeavors to bring together special divine action (SDA) with quantum assumptions and chaos theory is reflected in the book, saying that people are still remotely far from a reasonable hypothesis of divine action in a world that is consonant with contemporary science. Nonetheless, Saunders presumes that God exists and is currently active in the world in a specific sense setting off new fundamental interactions in nature. The book’s writer further concedes that while people cannot ever seek to have inclusive comprehension of God’s action within the world, this should not be a reason for anyone to go to the opposite extreme and assert that God’s transcendence prohibits any evocative discussions of His actions.

== Key points ==
Essentially, ''Divine Action and Modern Science'' attempted to reconcile God and his actions with science. The book's main thesis is that Divine action should be considered an action upon and within nature. This being said, it is part of nature and, therefore, "the mechanics of describing such action, in some way, correlate with the mechanics of describing nature herself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epperson|first=Michael|date=October 2004|title=Book Review: Nicholas. Saunders,&amp;nbsp; Divine Action and Modern Science.|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/426996?journalCode=jr|journal=The Journal of Religion|language=en|volume=84|issue=4|pages=648–649|doi=10.1086/426996|issn=0022-4189|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saunders also drew from several theories on Divine Action such as those put forward by thinkers William Pollard, [[Nancey Murphy]], and [[Thomas M. Tracy|Thomas Tracy]], among others. In his discourse, the author – through the evidence provided by these scholars – concluded that for each Divine action, there is a scientific feasibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wesleywildman.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/docs/2003-Wildman-Review-of-Saunders-Divine-Action-and-Modern-Science.pdf|title=Divine Action and Modern Science|last=Wildman|first=Wesley|date=2002|website=Wesley Wildman|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the book claimed that a scientific explanation of the Divine action could revolutionize theological traditions, making it more relevant and tenable in light of our modern understanding of the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Divine Action and Modern Science|last=Saunders|first=Nicholas|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521801567|location=Cambridge|pages=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Douglas R. Groothuis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|r|oʊ|t|aɪ|s}} {{respell|GROH|tyce}}; born January 3, 1957) is Professor of [[Philosophy]] at [[Denver Seminary]]. Groothuis was a campus pastor for twelve years prior to obtaining a position as an associate professor of [[philosophy of religion]] and [[ethics]] at Denver Seminary in 1993. He was educated at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and the [[University of Oregon]]. He was married to Rebecca Merrill Groothuis until her death on July 6, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denver Seminary Faculty Page|url=http://www.denverseminary.edu/about-us/president-faculty-staff-board/faculty/dr-douglas-r-groothuis/|work=Denver Seminary Page|publisher=Denver Seminary|accessdate=January 14, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222024755/http://www.denverseminary.edu/about-us/president-faculty-staff-board/faculty/dr-douglas-r-groothuis/|archivedate=December 22, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary for Rebecca Merrill Groothuis at Horan &amp; McConaty|url=https://horancares.com/obits/rebecca-merrill-groothuis/|accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
During the late 1980s Groothuis emerged as a younger voice in [[evangelicalism]] with two books that described and analyzed [[New Age]] spirituality: ''Unmasking the New Age'' and ''Confronting the New Age''. In subsequent books he pursued specific topics in New Age spirituality such as claims that Jesus spent his adolescent years studying among Hindu and Buddhist teachers in India and Tibet in ''Revealing the New Age Jesus''. The phenomena of [[near-death experience]]s and the claims of [[Betty Eadie]] about the afterlife were the subject of his analysis in ''Deceived by the Light''.

In the 1990s, Groothuis began to write about the cultural shifts associated with [[postmodern philosophy]] in his book ''Truth Decay'', as well as to formulate responses to those shifts via [[Christian apologetics]]. He was also interested in human behavior and belief associated with the use of the Internet, and wrote of his theological concerns in ''The Soul in Cyberspace''. His interests in philosophy have also led him to write on topics like [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[epistemology]], the rationality of [[theism]], and book-length treatments of the philosophical ideas and methods of [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Jesus]]. In 2011, Groothuis published a comprehensive textbook on Christian apologetics.

In his teaching career at Denver Seminary, he has taught graduate courses in Christian Apologetics, Problems in Apologetics, Issues in Philosophy of Religion, Christian Ethics and Modern Culture, and Religious Pluralism, among many others. He is a member of the [[Society of Christian Philosophers]] and the [[Evangelical Philosophical Society]], has published twelve books and contributed to many others, and has written numerous articles, book reviews, and editorials. Articles have appeared in periodicals such as ''[[Christianity Today]]'', the ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]'', ''Philosophia Christi'', and ''Moody Monthly''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5399">'''Douglas Edison Harding''' (12 February 1909 &amp;ndash; 11 January 2007) was an English philosophical writer, mystic, spiritual teacher and author of a number of books, including ''On Having No Head, Zen and the Rediscovery of the Obvious''. He was born in [[Lowestoft]] in the county of [[Suffolk]] and raised in the Exclusive [[Plymouth Brethren]], a [[Christianity|Christian]] sect, from which he apostatised at the age of 21.

==Biography==
In 1943, aged 34, after some ten years of intense self-enquiry, study and writing, Harding had worked out that he was made of layers, like an onion. In other words, what he was depended on the range of the observer. As a result of his studies, Harding was convinced that he was human only at a certain range. Closer to, he was cellular, molecular, atomic... Further away he appeared as the human species, Life, the planet, the star, the galaxy... At very close range, therefore, he was almost nothing. It made sense to him therefore that at centre he was a mysterious 'nothingness'. Then, in 1943, he stopped thinking and speculating and simply looked back at himself. He noticed that from his own point of view he was headless. He was looking not out of two eyes but a 'single eye', a boundless openness – an openness that was self-evidently aware, and was also full of the whole world. Here was direct experience of his central identity, his True Self. No longer did he have to rely on speculation. Following this he spent the next 8 years exploring the scientific, philosophical, psychological, religious... implications of his discovery, presented in his book The Hierarchy of Heaven and Earth, described by C. S. Lewis (who wrote the preface) as "a work of the highest genius". This book was published by Faber &amp; Faber in 1952. After taking time off from his profession, Harding then returned to architecture. 

Harding continued to write, however, but it was not until 1964 that he clearly shared the experience of 'headlessness' with another person - his secretary. Following this, Harding gradually began to share 'Seeing' more widely. In the late 1960s and early 1970s Harding developed his 'experiments'. Harding described these experiments as 'a breakthrough' in terms of making easily available the experience of 'who we really are', our True Nature - which is No-thing and Everything. Harding was emphatic that people tested out his claims for themselves - "you are the sole and final authority on you". He rejected the role of 'guru', always pointing others back to themselves. "Look for yourself".  

As well as writing many books and articles, and developing his experiments, Harding also designed his Youniverse Explorer model, which beautifully and elegantly models the layers of our body/mind, from the galaxy to particles, and includes at the centre of all these layers a clear sphere, symbolising one's True Nature - one's No-face. 

Harding travelled widely, sharing Seeing. In the 1990s and early 2000s he travelled and gave workshops with his second wife, Catherine. 

Harding was married twice and had two sons and a daughter. He died at [[Nacton]] near [[Ipswich]], [[England]].

After graduating from [[Tokyo University]], he went to [[Princeton University|Princeton]] to study under [[Kurt Gödel]]. 
&lt;!-- Cite? He was one of the few people that Godel could feel comfortable with. --&gt; 
He later became a professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. Takeuti was president (2003–2009) of the [[Kurt Gödel Society]], having worked on the book ''Memoirs of a Proof Theorist: Godel and Other Logicians''.  His goal was to prove the consistency of the real numbers.  To this end, [[Takeuti's conjecture]] speculates that a [[sequent calculus|sequent]] formalisation of [[second-order logic]] has [[cut-elimination theorem|cut-elimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Takeuti|1953}}. An erratum to this article was published in the same journal (24:149–156, 1954).&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also known for his work on [[ordinal notation|ordinal diagrams]] with Akiko Kino.

'''George Henry Radcliffe Parkinson''' (1923-2015) (known as ‘Harry’), was a philosopher and historian of philosophy.

Parkinson was born in 1923 in [[Tientsin]], [[China]], to British parents. He was educated at [[Bradford Grammar School]] and [[Wadham College]], Oxford, where he obtained a First Class Honours degree in [[Literae Humaniores]] in 1949, and the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in 1952. In 1950 he was appointed Assistant Lecturer in Philosophy at the [[University of Reading]], under then Head of Department Professor H A Hodges, and he remained in the department until he retired. He was made a Professor there in 1974, served as Head of Department from 1983 to 1989, and was made an Emeritus Professor of Philosophy upon his retirement.

Best known for his work on the [[history of Philosophy]], perhaps particularly for his work on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], Parkinson was closely associated with the journal [[Studia Leibnitiana]] from its inception in 1969, and became one of its editors in 1988.

'''Guy Hocquenghem''' (10 December 1946&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Idier, ''Les Vies de Guy Hocquenghem. Sociologie d'une trajectoire à l'intersection des champs politiques, culturels et intellectuels français des années 1960 aux années 1980'', PhD of Sociology, University of Amiens (France), 2015&lt;/ref&gt; – 28 August 1988) was a French writer, philosopher, and [[Queer Theory|queer theorist]].

==Biography==
Guy Hocquenghem was born in the suburbs of Paris and was educated at the [[Lycée Lakanal]] in [[Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine|Sceaux]] and the [[Ecole Normale Supérieure]] in Paris. At the age of fifteen he began an affair with his high school philosophy teacher, [[René Scherer]]. They remained lifelong friends.&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who in Contemporary Gay and Lesbian History By Robert Aldrich, Garry Wotherspoon; p.191&lt;/ref&gt; His participation in the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968 student rebellion in France]] formed his allegiance to the [[Communist Party]], which later expelled him because of his homosexuality.

Hocquenghem taught philosophy at the [[University of Vincennes|University of Vincennes-Saint Denis, Paris]] and wrote numerous novels and works of theory. He was the staff writer for the French publication ''[[Libération]]''. Hocquenghem was the first [[gay man]] to be a member of the [[Front Homosexuel d'Action Révolutionnaire]] (FHAR), originally formed by [[lesbian]] separatists who split from the [[Mouvement Homophile de France]] in 1971. With filmmaker [[Lionel Soukaz]] (b. 1953), Hocquenghem wrote and produced a [[documentary film]] about gay history, ''[[Race d'Ep!]]'' (1979) the last word of the title being a play on the word ''pédé'', a French slur for gay men.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0219992/ Race d'Ep (1979)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Hocquenghem had a significant impact on leftist thinking in France, his reputation has failed to grow to international prominence. Only the first of his theoretical tracts, ''[[Homosexual Desire]]'' (1972) and his first novel, ''L'Amour en relief'' (1982) have been translated into English. Although ''Race d'Ep!'' was shown at [[The Roxie|Roxie Cinema]] in [[San Francisco]] in April 1980 and released in America as ''[[The Homosexual Century]]'', like Hocquenghem, the film is virtually unknown.

==Career==
Guy Hocquenghem's ''Homosexual Desire'' (1972, English translation 1978) may be the first work of [[Queer Theory]].  Drawing on the theories of [[desiring-production]] developed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in their ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'' project (1972-1980), Hocquenghem critiqued the influential models of the psyche and sexual desire derived from the psychoanalysts [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Sigmund Freud]].  The author also addressed the relation of [[capitalism]] to sexualities, the dynamics of desire, and the political effects of gay group-identities. Moreover, he repudiated the prospect of a new gay 'social organisation' of politics, along with the injunction to sacrifice oneself in the name of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Edelman, ''No Future:Queer Theory and the Death Drive'', Duke University Press, 2005, page 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The sociologist [[Jeffrey Weeks (sociologist)|Jeffrey Weeks]]'s 1978 preface to the first English translation of ''[[Homosexual Desire]]'' situates the essay in relation to the various, mostly French, theories of subjectivity and desire surrounding and influencing Hocquenghem's thought. It was republished in French in 2000.

''L'Après-Mai des faunes'' (1974) is the second and untranslated queer-theoretical text.

''Co-ire, album systématique de l'enfance'' (''Co-anger: systematic album of childhood'') (1976) examines childhood sexuality from a Marxist perspective, co-written with professor René Schérer. It is rumored that Schérer and Hocquenghem had an affair in 1959, when the latter was 15.

''Fin de section'' (1976) short story collection

''La Dérive homosexuelle'' (1977) is the third and yet to be translated queer-theoretical text.

''La Beauté du métis'' (1979) analyzed French anti-Arab feeling and homophobia.

''L'Amour en relief'' (1982) is Hocquenghem's first and most famous novel. A blind Tunisian boy explores French society and discovers the ways in which pleasure can form a resistance to totalitarianism. The novel gives context to homosexual desire as a resistance to [[white supremacy]] and [[racism]].

''La Colère de l'agneau'' (''The Wrath of the Lamb'') (1985) is an experiment in millenarian and apocalyptic narrative taking [[St. John the Evangelist]] as its subject.

''L'Âme atomique'' (''The Atomic Heart'') (1986) was written partly as a response to his deteriorating health, and again in collaboration with Schérer, this work espouses a philosophy composed of [[dandyism]], [[gnosticism]], and [[epicureanism]].

''Open letter to those who moved from Mao collars to [[Rotary International|Rotary]] wheels, Marseilles, Agone'' (1986) was republished in 2003 with a foreword by [[Serge Halimi]] {{ISBN|2-7489-0005-7}}

''Eve'' (1987) is a narrative which combines the story of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] with the description of the changes in the body from [[AIDS]]-related symptoms and written as Hocquenghem's own body deteriorated.

''Voyages et aventures extraordinaires du Frère Angelo'' (1988) explores the mind of an Italian monk accompanying the conquistadors to the New World.

==Death==
Hocquenghem died of AIDS related complications on 28 August 1988, aged 41.

'''Henry Laurie''' (1837/1838?–14 May 1922) was an Australian philosopher, a journalist, and the first professor of philosophy at the [[University of Melbourne]].&lt;ref name="AustBio"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Ann G.|title=Laurie, Henry (1837–1922)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/laurie-henry-7106|website=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurie was educated at the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he was strongly influenced by the philosopher [[Alexander Campbell Fraser]]. Laurie did not graduate from the university for health reasons, and then moved first to Canada, then to [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. In Australia, he became a journalist and contributed to the ''[[Warrnambool Examiner]]'', and subsequently edited the weekly newspaper, the ''[[Warrnambool Standard]]'', in partnership with a printer and journalist named William Fairfax. His interests remained literary and philosophical throughout.&lt;ref name="Grave"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grave|first1=S.A.|title=A History of Philosophy in Australia|date=1984|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=Queensland|isbn=0702216976|pages=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, he was offered the job of Chair of Mental and Moral Philosophy at Melbourne, having written two articles on philosophy. One, "A Plea for Philosophy", rebutted objections to the study of philosophy including those who were worried that the study of philosophy would "be antagonistic to the Christian faith". The second piece, "The Study of Mental Philosophy", also broadly advocated the study of philosophy and rebutted criticisms from those who said the endeavour was "useless or impossible". As a professor, Laurie kept his philosophical opinions to himself but was critical of the works of [[Herbert Spencer]]. His teaching of logic drew on [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]]'s writings.&lt;ref name="Grave" /&gt;

He received an honorary LL.D from [[St Andrew's University]] in 1886. On 11 January 1871, he married Frances, the daughter of [[William Spalding (writer)|William Spalding]]. They had three sons.&lt;ref name="AustBio" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1861">'''Hypotext''' is an earlier text which serves as the source of a subsequent piece of literature, or [[hypertext (semiotics)|hypertext]].&lt;ref name="Martin2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Bronwen|title=Key Terms in Semiotics|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|page=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ANBLPmfvSusC&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 August 2013|isbn=0-8264-8456-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]] could be regarded as the hypotext for [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

The word  was defined by the French theorist [[Gérard Genette]] as follows "Hypertextuality refers to any relationship uniting a text B (which I shall call the hypertext) to an earlier text A (I shall, of course, call it the ''hypotext''), upon which it is grafted in a manner that is not that of commentary."&lt;ref name="Genette1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Genette|first=Gérard |title=Palimpsests: Literature in the Second Degree|year=1997|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, a hypertext derives from hypotext(s) through a process which Genette calls transformation, in which text B "evokes" text A without necessarily mentioning it directly.  The hypertext may of course become original text in its own right.&lt;ref name="Allen2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Graham|title=The New Critical Idiom|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=Ch 3: Hypertextuality.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word has more recently been used in extended ways, for example, Adamczewski suggests that the [[Iliad]] was used as a ''structuring hypotext'' in [[Mark's Gospel]].&lt;ref name="Adamczewski2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adamczewski|first=Bartosz |title=Q Or Not Q?: The So-Called Triple, Double, and Single Traditions in the Synoptic Gospels|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-cs|ˈjan ˈɦus|lang|Cs-Jan_Hus.ogg}}; {{circa|1369}} – 6 July 1415),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fudge|first=Thomas|date=1998|title=Infoelix Hus: The Rehabilitation of a Medieval Heretic|url=https://e-publications.une.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository;jsessionid=28AA30F1BE556E9922FF3D9A4232E984/une:15441?f0=sm_subject%3A%22Christian+Studies+%28incl+Biblical+Studies+and+Church+History%29%22|journal=Fides et Historia|issue=30|volume=1|doi=|pmid= |pages=57–73|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes [[Anglicization|Anglicized]] as '''John Hus''' or '''John Huss''', also referred to in historical texts as ''Iohannes Hus'' or ''Johannes Huss'') was a [[Czechs|Czech]] theologian, philosopher, master, dean, and rector&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jan-Hus Encyclopedia Britannica - Jan Hus&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]] who became a church reformer, an inspirer of [[Hussitism]], a key predecessor to [[Protestantism]] and a seminal figure in the [[Bohemian Reformation]].

After [[John Wycliffe]], the theorist of ecclesiastical reform, Hus is considered the first church reformer, as he lived before [[Martin Luther|Luther]], [[John Calvin|Calvin]], and [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]]. His teachings had a strong influence on the states of Western Europe, most immediately in the approval of a reformed [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]] [[Christian denomination|religious denomination]], and, more than a century later, on [[Martin Luther]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Heiko Augustinus Oberman|author2=Eileen Walliser-Schwarzbart|title=Luther: Man Between God and the Devil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vuES0JdltfcC&amp;pg=PA54|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-10313-1|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was [[Burned at the stake#Historical usage|burned at the stake]] for [[heresy]] against the [[doctrine]]s of the [[Catholic Church]], including those on [[ecclesiology]], the [[Eucharist]], and other theological topics.

After Hus was executed in 1415, the followers of his religious teachings (known as [[Hussite]]s) rebelled against their Catholic rulers and defeated five consecutive papal [[crusades]] between 1420 and 1431 in what became known as the [[Hussite Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio.cz/en/article/11864 "Sigismund of Luxembourg"]. Radio Prague&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]] and the [[Margraviate of Moravia|Moravian]] populations remained majority [[Hussite]] until the 1620s, when a Protestant defeat in the [[Battle of the White Mountain]] resulted in the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] coming under [[Habsburg]] dominion for the next 300 years and [[Counter-Reformation|being subject to immediate and forced conversion in an intense campaign of return to Catholicism]].

==Early life==
Jan Hus was born in [[Husinec (Prachatice District)|Husinec]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]],  c. 1369. At an early age he traveled to [[Prague]], where he supported himself by singing and serving in churches.  His conduct was positive and his commitment to his studies was remarkable.&lt;ref name="cath"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07584b.htm Wilhelm, Joseph. "Jan Hus." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 29 Jun. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1393, Hus earned the degree of [[Bachelor of Arts]] at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], and he earned his master's degree in 1396. In 1400, he was ordained as a priest. In 1402 Hus began preaching inside the city demanding a reformation of the Church. He served as [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the University of Prague in 1402–03. He was appointed a preacher at the newly built Bethlehem Chapel around the same time. Hus was a strong advocate for the Czechs and the [[Philosophical realism|Realists]], and he was influenced by the writings of [[John Wycliffe]].  Although church authorities banned many works of Wycliffe in 1403, Hus translated ''Trialogus'' into [[Czech language|Czech]] and helped to distribute it.&lt;ref name="cath"/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Hus na kazatelne.jpg|thumb|left|Jan Hus preaching, illumination from a Czech manuscript, 1490s]]
Hus attacked the Church by denouncing the moral failings of clergy, bishops, and even the papacy from his pulpit. Archbishop [[Zbyněk Zajíc]] tolerated this, and even appointed Hus a preacher at the clergy's biennial synod. On 24 June 1405, [[Pope Innocent VII]], however, directed the Archbishop to counter Wycliffe's teachings, especially the doctrine of [[impanation]] in the [[Eucharist]]. The archbishop complied by issuing a [[synod]]al decree against Wycliffe, as well as forbidding any further attacks on the clergy.&lt;ref name="cath"/&gt;

In 1406, two Bohemian students brought to Prague a document bearing the seal of the [[University of Oxford]] and praising Wycliffe. Hus proudly read the document from his pulpit. Then in 1408, [[Pope Gregory XII]] warned Archbishop Zajic that the Church in Rome had been informed of Wycliffe's heresies and of the sympathies of King [[Wenceslaus IV]] for non-conformists. In response, the king and university ordered all of Wycliffe's writings surrendered to the archdiocesan chancery for correction. Hus obeyed, declaring that he condemned the errors in those writings.&lt;ref name="cath"/&gt;

===Papal Schism===
In 1408, the [[Charles University in Prague]] was divided by the [[Western Schism]], in which Gregory XII in Rome and [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] in [[Avignon]] both claimed the papacy. Wenceslaus felt Gregory XII might interfere with his plans to be crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. He denounced Gregory, ordered the clergy in Bohemia to observe a strict neutrality in the schism, and said that he expected the same of the University. Archbishop Zajíc remained faithful to Gregory. At the University, only the scholars of the Bohemian "nation" (one of the four governing sections), with Hus as their leader, vowed neutrality.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

====Kutná Hora Decree====
[[File:Jan Hus-Bible Martinicka.jpg|thumb|The oldest known representation of Jan Hus is from Martinická bible.]]

At the urging of Hus and other Bohemian leaders, Wenceslaus the Idle decreed in the Czech city of  [[Kutná Hora]] that the "Bohemian nation" would have three votes in University affairs, while the [[Bavaria]]n, [[Saxony|Saxon]], and [[Poland|Polish]] "nations" would have only one vote in total. As a consequence, between five thousand and twenty thousand foreign doctors, masters, and students left Prague in 1409. This exodus resulted in the founding of the [[University of Leipzig]], among others. Thus Charles University lost its international importance and became a strictly Czech school. The emigrants also spread news of the Bohemian heresies throughout the rest of Europe. Archbishop Zajíc became isolated, while Hus was at the height of his fame, becoming Rector of the University and enjoying the favour of the court. Wycliffe's doctrines also regained favour in Prague.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

====Antipope Alexander V====
In 1409, the [[Council of Pisa]] tried to end the schism by electing [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] as Pope, but Gregory and Benedict did not submit. (Alexander was declared an "[[antipope]]" by the [[Council of Constance]] in 1418.)

Hus, his followers, and Wenceslaus IV transferred their allegiance to Alexander V. Under pressure from king Wenceslaus IV, Archbishop Zajíc did the same. Zajíc then lodged an accusation of "ecclesiastical disturbances" against Wycliffites in Prague with Alexander V.

====Excommunication====
On 20 December 1409, Alexander V issued a [[papal bull]] that empowered the Archbishop to proceed against Wycliffism in Prague. All copies of Wycliffe's writings were to be surrendered and his doctrines repudiated, and free preaching discontinued. After the publication of the bull in 1410, Hus appealed to Alexander V, but in vain. The Wycliffe books and valuable manuscripts were burned, and Hus and his adherents were [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by Alexander V.

====Indulgences====
Archbishop Zajíc died in 1411, and with his death the [[Bohemian Reformation|religious movement in Bohemia]] entered a new phase, where the disputes concerning [[indulgences]] assumed great importance.

====Crusade against Naples====
Alexander V died in 1410 and was succeeded by [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] (also later declared an antipope). In 1411,  John XXIII proclaimed a [[crusade]] against King [[Ladislaus of Naples]], the protector of rival [[Pope Gregory XII]]. This crusade was preached in Prague as well. John XXIII also authorized [[indulgence]]s to raise money for the war. Priests urged the people on and these crowded into churches to give their offerings. This traffic in indulgences was to some a sign of the corruption of the church needing remediation.{{citation needed|reason=The anti-church?|date=July 2012}}

====Condemnation of indulgences and Crusade====
[[File:Jan Hus 2.jpg|thumb|right|Hus by an unknown artist, 16th century]]
Hus spoke out against indulgences, but he could not carry with him the men of the university. In 1412, a dispute took place, on which occasion Hus delivered his address ''Quaestio magistri Johannis Hus de indulgentiis''. It was taken literally from the last chapter of Wycliffe's book, ''De ecclesia'', and his treatise, ''De absolutione a pena et culpa''. Hus asserted that no Pope or bishop had the right to take up the sword in the name of the Church; he should pray for his enemies and bless those that curse him; man obtains forgiveness of sins by true repentance, not money. The doctors of the theological faculty replied, but without success. A few days afterward, some of Hus's followers, led by Vok Voksa z Valdštejna, burnt the [[Papal bull]]s. Hus, they said, should be obeyed rather than the Church, which they considered a fraudulent mob of adulterers and [[Simony|Simonists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc05/Page_415.html |pages=415–20 |title=Huss, John, Hussites |last=Schaff |first=Philip |date=1953 |encyclopedia=The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, three men from the lower classes who openly called the indulgences a fraud were beheaded. They were later considered the first martyrs of the [[Hussite]] Church. In the meantime, the faculty had condemned the forty-five articles and added several other theses, deemed heretical, which had originated with Hus. The king forbade the teaching of these articles, but neither Hus nor the university complied with the ruling, requesting that the articles should be first proven to be un-scriptural. The tumults at Prague had stirred up a sensation; papal legates and Archbishop Albik tried to persuade Hus to give up his opposition to the papal bulls, and the king made an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile the two parties.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

====Attempts at reconciliation====
King Wenceslaus IV made efforts to harmonize the opposing parties. In 1412, he convoked the heads of his kingdom for a consultation and, at their suggestion, ordered a [[synod]] to be held at [[Český Brod]] on 2 February 1412. It did not take place there, but in the palace of the archbishops at Prague, in order to exclude Hus from participation. Propositions were made to restore peace in the Church. Hus declared that Bohemia should have the same freedom in regard to ecclesiastical affairs as other countries &lt;!-- what other countries?? --&gt; and that approbation and condemnation should therefore be announced only with the permission of the state power. This was the doctrine of Wycliffe (''Sermones'', iii. 519, etc.).

There followed treatises from both parties, but no harmony was obtained. "Even if I should stand before the stake which has been prepared for me," Hus wrote at the time, "I would never accept the recommendation of the theological faculty." The synod did not produce any results, but the King ordered a commission to continue the work of reconciliation. The doctors of the university demanded approval of their conception of the Church, according to which the Pope is the head, the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] are the body of the Church, from Hus and his followers. Hus protested vigorously. The Hussite party seems to have made a great effort toward reconciliation. To the article that the Roman Church must be obeyed, they added only "so far as every pious Christian is bound". Stanislav ze Znojma and Štěpán Páleč protested against this addition and left the convention; they were exiled by the king, with two others.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==== Hus leaves Prague and appeals to Jesus Christ ====
By this time, Hus' ideas had become widely accepted in Bohemia, and there was broad resentment against the Church hierarchy. The attack on Hus by the Pope and Archbishop caused riots in parts of Bohemia. King Wenceslaus IV and his government took the side of Hus, and the power of his adherents increased from day to day. Hus continued to preach in the [[Bethlehem Chapel]]. The churches of the city were put under the ban, and the [[interdict]] was pronounced against [[Prague]]. To protect the city, Hus left and went into the countryside, where he continued to preach and write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/131christians/martyrs/huss.html |title=John Huss, Pre-Reformation Reformer |accessdate=8 November 2013 |publisher=Christianity Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Hus left Prague, he decided to take a step which gave a new dimension to his endeavors. He no longer put his trust in an indecisive King, a hostile Pope or an ineffective Council. On 18 October 1412 he appealed to Jesus Christ as the supreme judge. By appealing directly to the highest Christian authority, Christ himself, he bypassed the laws and structures of the medieval Church.&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite web |title=Magistri Ioannis Hus appelatio ad supremum iudicem |trans-title=Master John Hus, appeal to the final judge |language=Latin; Czech |url=http://etfuk.sweb.cz/hus.htm |website=etfuk.sweb.cz |accessdate=23 July 2015}}{{self-published inline|date=July 2018}}{{psc|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Bohemian Reformation]], this step was as significant as the [[The Ninety-Five Theses|95 theses]] posted in  Wittenberg by Martin Luther in 1517.

After Hus left Prague for the country, he realized what a gulf there was between university education and theological speculation on one hand, and the life of uneducated country priests and the laymen entrusted to their care on the other.&lt;ref name=summaryArt&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nodl|first1=Martin|editor1-last=Horníčková|editor1-first=Kateřina|editor2-last=Šroněk|editor2-first=Michal|title=Umění české reformace (1380 - 1620) [The Art of the Bohemian Reformation (1380-1620)]|date=2010|publisher=Academia|location=Praha|isbn=978-80-200-1879-3|pages=530–531|chapter=Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he started to write many texts in Czech, such as basics of the Christian faith or preachings, intended mainly for the priests whose knowledge of Latin was poor.&lt;ref name=smahel&gt;{{cite book |last1=Šmahel |first1=František |title=Jan Hus : život a dílo |trans-title=Jan Hus: Life and Work |language=Czech |date=2013 |publisher=Argo |location=Praha |isbn=978-80-257-0875-0 |page=143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Writings of Hus and Wycliffe=====
Of the writings occasioned by these controversies, those of Hus on the Church, entitled ''De Ecclesia'', were written in 1413 and have been most frequently quoted and admired or criticized, and yet their first ten chapters are but an epitome of Wycliffe's work of the same title, and the following chapters are but an abstract of another of Wycliffe's works (''De potentate papae'') on the power of the Pope. Wycliffe had written his book to oppose the common position that the Church consisted primarily of the clergy, and Hus now found himself making the same point. He wrote his work at the castle of one of his protectors in Kozí Hrádek, and sent it to Prague, where it was publicly read in the Bethlehem Chapel. It was answered by Stanislav ze Znojma and Štěpán z Pálče with treatises of the same title.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

After the most vehement opponents of Hus had left Prague, his adherents occupied the whole ground. Hus wrote his treatises and preached in the neighborhood of Kozí Hrádek. Bohemian Wycliffism was carried into Poland, Hungary, [[Croatia]], and Austria. But in January 1413, a general council in Rome condemned the writings of Wycliffe and ordered them to be burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Church Schism &amp; Corruption |last=Maseko |first=Achim Nkosi |publisher=Lulu |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4092-2186-9 |pages= }}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}{{self-published inline|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Council of Constance===
King Wenceslaus' brother [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Hungary]], who was "[[King of the Romans]]" (that is, head of the Holy Roman Empire, though not then Emperor), and heir to the Bohemian crown, was anxious to put an end to religious dissension within the Church. To put an end to the papal schism and to take up the long desired reform of the Church, he arranged for a general council to convene on 1 November 1414, at [[Konstanz]] (Constance). The [[Council of Constance]] (1414–1418) became the 16th ecumenical council recognized by the Catholic Church. Hus, willing to make an end of all dissensions, agreed to go to Constance, under Sigismund's promise of [[safe conduct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Truth Prevails: The Undying Faith of Jan Hus.

====Imprisonment and preparations for trial====
[[File:Hus (Lessing 1842).jpg|thumb|280px|Jan Hus at the Council of Constance]]

It is not known whether Hus knew what his fate would be, but he made his [[last will and testament|will]] before setting out. He started on his journey on 11 October 1414; on 3 November 1414, he arrived at Constance, and on the following day, the bulletins on the church doors announced that Michal z Německého Brodu would be opposing Hus. In the beginning, Hus was at liberty, under his safe-conduct from Sigismund, and lived at the house of a widow. But he continued celebrating Mass and preaching to the people, in violation of restrictions decreed by the Church. After a few weeks on 28 November 1414, his opponents succeeded in imprisoning him, on the strength of a rumor that he intended to flee. He was first brought into the residence of a canon and then, on 6 December 1414, into the prison of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monastery. Sigismund, as the guarantor of Hus's safety, was greatly angered and threatened the prelates with dismissal; however, the prelates convinced him that he could not be bound by promises to a heretic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fudge |first=Thomas |title=Jan Hus: Religious Reform and Social Revolution in Bohemia|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TYYAAwAAQBAJ |year=2010 |publisher=I.B.Tauris|pages=125–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 1414, John XXIII entrusted a committee of three bishops with a preliminary investigation against Hus. As was common practice, witnesses for the prosecution were heard, but Hus was not allowed an advocate for his defense. His situation became worse after the downfall of John XXIII, who had left Constance to avoid abdicating. Hus had been the captive of John XXIII and in constant communication with his friends, but now he was delivered to the bishop of Constance and brought to his castle, ''Gottlieben on the Rhine''.

[[File:Spiezer Chronik Jan Hus 1485.jpg|thumb|Spiezer Chronik (1485), Burning of Jan Hus at the stake in [[Konstanz]].]]

On 5 June 1415, he was tried for the first time, and for that purpose was transferred to a [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan]] monastery, where he spent the last weeks of his life. Extracts from his works were read, and witnesses were heard. He refused all formulae of submission, but declared himself willing to recant if his errors should be proven to him from the Bible. Hus conceded his veneration of Wycliffe, and said that he could only wish his soul might some time attain unto that place where Wycliffe's was. On the other hand, he denied having defended Wycliffe's doctrine of [[The Lord's Supper]] or the forty-five articles; he had only opposed their summary condemnation. King Sigismund admonished him to deliver himself up to the mercy of the Council, as he did not desire to protect a heretic.

At the last trial, on 8 June 1415, thirty-nine sentences were read to him, twenty-six of which had been excerpted from his book on the Church (''De ecclesia''), seven from his treatise against Palecz (Contra Palecz), and six from that against Stanislav ze Znojma (''Contra Stanislaum''). The danger of some of these doctrines to worldly power was explained to Sigismund to incite him against Hus. Hus again declared himself willing to submit if he could be convinced of errors. This declaration was considered an unconditional surrender, and he was asked to confess:
# that he had erred in the theses which he had hitherto maintained;
# that he renounced them for the future;
# that he recanted them; and
# that he declared the opposite of these sentences.

He asked to be exempted from recanting doctrines which he had never taught; others, which the assembly considered erroneous, he was not willing to revoke; to act differently would be against his conscience. These words found no favourable reception. After the trial on 8 June, several other attempts were purportedly made to induce him to recant, which he resisted.&lt;ref&gt;Di Mauro, Dennis.

====Condemnation====
[[File:Hus památník.jpg|thumb|220px|The monument in [[Konstanz]], where reformer Jan Hus was executed (1862)]]
The condemnation took place on 6 July 1415, in the presence of the assembly of the Council in the Cathedral. After the [[Solemn Mass|High Mass]] and Liturgy, Hus was led into the church. The [[Bishop of Lodi]] (then [[Giacomo Balardi Arrigoni]]) delivered an oration on the duty of eradicating heresy; then some theses of Hus and Wycliffe and a report of his trial were read.

====Refusals to recant====
An Italian prelate pronounced the sentence of condemnation upon Hus and his writings. Hus protested, saying that even at this hour he did not wish anything, but to be convinced from Scripture. He fell upon his knees and asked God with a soft voice to forgive all his enemies. Then followed his degradation — he was dressed in priestly vestments and again asked to recant; again he refused. With curses, Hus' ornaments were taken from him, his priestly [[tonsure]] was destroyed, and the sentence of the Church was pronounced, stripping him of all rights, and he was delivered to secular authorities. Then a tall paper hat was put upon his head, with the inscription "''[[Heresiarch|Haeresiarcha]]''" (i.e., the leader of a heretical movement). Hus was led away to the stake under a strong guard of armed men.

==Execution==
[[File:Jan Hus at the Stake.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Jan Hus at the [[Death by burning|stake]], Jena codex (c. 1500)]]
At the place of execution, he knelt down, spread out his hands, and prayed aloud. The executioner undressed Hus and tied his hands behind his back with ropes, and bound his neck with a chain to a stake around which wood and straw had been piled up so that it covered him to the neck. At the last moment, the imperial marshal, von Pappenheim, in the presence of the [[Louis III, Elector Palatine|Count Palatine]], asked Hus to recant and thus save his own life. Hus declined thus:

{{quote|God is my witness that the things charged against me I never preached. In the same truth of the Gospel which I have written, taught, and preached, drawing upon the sayings and positions of the holy doctors, I am ready to die today.&lt;ref&gt;Schaff, David Schley, ''John Huss: his life, teachings and death, after five hundred years'', (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1915), p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anecdotally, it has been claimed that the executioners had trouble intensifying the fire. An old woman then came to the stake and threw a relatively small amount of [[:wikt:brushwood|brushwood]] on it. Upon seeing her act, a suffering Hus then exclaimed, "''Sancta Simplicitas!''". The phrase's [[Czech language|Czech]] equivalent, "''Svatá prostota!''" ([[Vocative case#Czech|vocative form]]: "''Svatá prostoto!''", Translated "''Holy simplicity!''") is still used today when commenting on a person's foolish action coming from the belief that s/he is doing something righteous.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
It is said that when he was about to expire, he cried out, ''"Christ, son of the Living God, have mercy on us!"'' (a variant of the [[Jesus Prayer]]). Hus' ashes were later thrown into the [[Rhine River]] (as a means of preventing the veneration of his remains).

==Aftermath==

===Hussite Wars===
{{Main|Hussite Wars}}
[[File:Hussites.gif|thumb|right|300px|Evolution of the Hussite movement in the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] from 1419 to 1620, superimposed on modern borders]]
[[File:Jensky kodex Zizka.jpg|thumb|[[Jan Žižka]] leading troops of Hussites]]
[[File:Vrhání husitů do šachet.gif|thumb|Some two thousand of Hus' followers thrown into the [[Kutná Hora]] mines by pro-Catholic townsmen]]
Responding with horror to the execution of Hus, the people of Bohemia moved even more rapidly away from Papal teachings, provoking Rome to pronounce a [[crusade]] against them (1 March 1420): [[Pope Martin V]] issued a [[Papal bull]] authorising the execution of all supporters of Hus and Wycliffe. King Wenceslaus IV died in August 1419 and his brother, [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Hungary]], was unable to establish a real government in Bohemia due to the Hussite revolt.

The Hussite community included most of the Czech population of the Kingdom of Bohemia, and became a major military power. Under the leadership of [[Jan Žižka]] (c. 1360–1424) and later of [[Prokop the Great]] (ca. 1380 – 1434) - both  excellent commanders—the Hussites defeated the crusade and the three crusades that followed (1419–1434). Fighting ended after a compromise between the Utraquist Hussites and the Catholic [[Council of Basel]] in 1436. It resulted in the [[Basel Compacts]], in which the Catholic Church officially allowed Bohemia to practice its own version of Christianity (Hussitism). A century later, as much as ninety percent of the inhabitants of the [[Czech Crown lands]] still followed Hussite teachings.

===Hus's scholarship and teachings===
[[File:Luther und Hus-Abendmahl.jpg|thumb|Luther and Hus serving [[Communion under both kinds]] together, picture from 16th-century Saxony demonstrating the affinity of Lutherans with Hussites]]
Hus left only a few reformatory writings in the proper sense of the word, most of his works being polemical treatises against Stanislav ze Znojma and Štěpán Páleč. He translated Wycliffe's ''Trialogus'', and was very familiar with his works on the body of the Lord, on the Church, on the power of the pope, and especially with his sermons. There are reasons to suppose that Wycliffe's doctrine of the Lord's Supper ([[consubstantiation]] rather than [[transubstantiation]]&lt;ref&gt;Gotthard Victor Lechler, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHIJAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA381 ''John Wycliffe and His English Precursors,''] Religious Tract Society, 1904, p. 381ff&lt;/ref&gt;) had spread to Prague as early as 1399, with strong evidence that students returning from England had brought the work back with them. It gained an even wider circulation after it had been prohibited in 1403, and Hus preached and taught it, although it is possible that he simply repeated it without advocating it. But the doctrine was seized eagerly by the radical party, the [[Taborites]], who made it the central point of their system. According to their book, the Church is not the clerical hierarchy which was generally accepted as ‘the Church;’ the Church is the entire body of those who from eternity have been predestined for salvation. Christ, not the pope, is its head. It is no article of faith that one must obey the pope to be saved. Neither internal membership in the Church nor churchly offices and dignities are a surety that the persons in question are members of the true Church.

To some, Hus's efforts were predominantly designed to rid the Church of its ethical abuses, rather than a campaign of sweeping theological change. To others, the seeds of the Reformation are clear in Hus's and Wycliffe's writings. In explaining the plight of the average Christian in Bohemia, Hus wrote, "One pays for confession, for mass, for the sacrament, for indulgences, for churching a woman, for a blessing, for burials, for funeral services and prayers. The very last penny which an old woman has hidden in her bundle for fear of thieves or robbery will not be saved. The villainous priest will grab it." (Macek, 16) After Hus's death, his followers, known as [[Hussite]]s, split off into several groups including the [[Utraquists]], [[Taborite]]s and [[Sirotci|Orphans]].

===Apology of the Catholic Church===
Nearly six centuries later in 1999,  [[Pope John Paul II]] expressed "deep regret for the cruel death inflicted" on Hus and added "deep sorrow" for Hus' death and praised his "moral courage".  Cardinal [[Miloslav Vlk]] of the Czech Republic was instrumental in crafting John Paul II's statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Allen Jr. |first=John L. |date=15 September 2009 |title=The German shepherd bids farewell to a 'wolf in winter' |url=http://ncronline.org/news/german-shepherd-bids-farewell-wolf-winter |website=National Catholic Reporter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
[[File:Jan Hus Statue and Tyn Church, Old Town Square, Prague - 8190.jpg|thumb|[[Jan Hus Memorial]] at [[Old Town Square (Prague)|Old Town Square]] in [[Prague]] built in 1915]]
A century after the Hussite Wars began, as many as 90% of inhabitants of the [[Czech lands]] were Hussites (although in the [[Utraquist]] tradition following a joint Utraquist—Catholic victory in the Hussite Wars).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Václavík |first = David   | title = Náboženství a moderní česká společnost |trans-title=Religion and Modern Czech Society |language=Czech | publisher = Grada Publishing a.s. | year = 2010  | page=53 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1A5P3H2gT0sC&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Czech Republic|Bohemia]] was the site of [[Hussites|one of the most significant pre-reformation movements]],&lt;ref name="museeprotestant.org"&gt;[http://www.museeprotestant.org/en/notice/protestantism-in-the-republic-of-czechoslovakia/ Protestantism in Bohemia and Moravia (Czech Republic)]&lt;/ref&gt; there are only few Protestant adherents remaining in modern times;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=cs |url=http://www.czso.cz/sldb2011/eng/redakce.nsf/i/tab_7_1_population_by_religious_belief_and_by_municipality_size_groups/$File/PVCR071_ENG.pdf |title=Tab 7.1 Population by religious belief and by municipality size groups |publisher=Czso.cz |accessdate=2013-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221184947/http://www.czso.cz/sldb2011/eng/redakce.nsf/i/tab_7_1_population_by_religious_belief_and_by_municipality_size_groups/%24File/PVCR071_ENG.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=cs |url=http://www.czso.cz/sldb2011/eng/redakce.nsf/i/tab_7_2_population_by_religious_belief_and_by_regions/$File/PVCR072_ENG.pdf |title=Tab 7.2 Population by religious belief and by regions |publisher=Czso.cz |accessdate=2013-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104224923/http://www.czso.cz/sldb2011/eng/redakce.nsf/i/tab_7_2_population_by_religious_belief_and_by_regions/%24File/PVCR072_ENG.pdf |archivedate= 4 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly due to historical reasons such as persecution of Protestants by the [[Catholic]] [[Habsburgs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-470-29323-2 |first1=Hana |last1=Mastrini |title=Frommer's Prague &amp; the Best of the Czech Republic |year=2008 |edition=7th |publisher=Wiley |pages= }}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  particularly after the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620; restrictions during the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Communist rule]]; and also the ongoing [[secularization]].&lt;ref name="museeprotestant.org"/&gt;

Jan Hus was a key contributor to [[Protestantism]], whose teachings had a strong influence on the states of Europe and on [[Martin Luther]]. The [[Hussite Wars]] resulted in the Basel Compacts which allowed for a reformed church in the Kingdom of Bohemia—almost a century before such developments would take place in the Lutheran Reformation. [[Moravian Church|The Unitas Fratrum (or Moravian Church)]] considers itself a spiritual heir to many of Hus' followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitasfratrum.org/index.php/origin-growth-of-the-unitas-fratrum/ |title=The Origin &amp; Growth |website=Unitas Fratrum |accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hus' extensive writings earn him a prominent place in Czech literary history.

===Hus and Czech language===
Jan Hus introduced improvements into medieval Czech language, such as the [[diacritic]] including the "hook" [[háček]] (č,ě,š,ř,ž) (instead of digraph like "cz", "ie", "sch", "rz", "zs"), the "dot" above letters for strong accent, as well as the acute accent to mark long vowels (á,é,í,ó,ú), in order to represent each [[phoneme|sound]] by a single [[grapheme|symbol]]. Some sources mention documented use of the special symbols in Bible translations (1462), the Schaffhausen Bible, and handwritten notes in the bible. The symbol "ů" (instead of "uo") came later. The book ''Orthographia Bohemica'' (1406) may have been written by Jan Hus, or by another author from Charles University.

Today, the [[Jan Hus Memorial]] is located at the Prague [[Old Town Square]] ([[Czech language|Czech]] ''Staroměstské náměstí''), and there are many smaller memorials in other towns throughout the Czech Republic.

In New York City, a church in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]] (located at 153 Ocean Avenue), and a church and a theatre in [[Manhattan]] (located at 351 [[East 74th Street]]) are named for Hus: respectively the John Hus Moravian Church, the [[Jan Hus Presbyterian Church]] and the Jan Hus Playhouse. Although the Manhattan's church and theatre share a single building and management, the Playhouse's productions are usually non-religious or non-denominational.

A statue of Jan Hus was erected at the Union Cemetery in [[Bohemia, New York]] (on [[Long Island]]) by Czech immigrants to the New York area in 1893.

In contrast to the popular perception that Hus was a [[proto-Protestantism|proto-Protestant]], some Eastern Orthodox Christians have argued that his theology was far closer to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]]. Jan Hus is considered as a martyr saint in some jurisdictions of the [[Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name="husodox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journeytoorthodoxy.com/2011/11/19/jan-hus-jerome-of-prague-and-orthodoxy-in-czechia-slovakia/|title=Jan Hus, Jerome of Prague and Orthodoxy in Czechia &amp; Slovakia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]] claims to trace its origin to Hus, to be "neo-Hussite", and contains mixed Eastern Orthodox and Protestant elements. Hus has forever left his impact as a man whose life, teachings and beliefs transformed the church.

Hus was voted the greatest hero of Czech nation in a 2015 survey by Czech Radio. He received 19% of votes.&lt;ref name="Anketa: KDO JE PRO VÁS HRDiNA.CZ? HRDiNA.CZ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anketa: KDO JE PRO VÁS HRDiNA.CZ?|url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/hrdina/anketa|website=www.rozhlas.cz|accessdate=20 June 2017|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giovanni Caruana''' (1866–1923) was a Maltese [[lawyer]] and minor [[philosopher]]. He was mostly interested in the [[philosophy of law]] and in [[political economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, pp. 69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least two portraits of Caruana exist, both by the renowned early 20th century Maltese artist Edward Caruana Dingli. Both were displayed at an exhibition on Caruana Dingli at the National Museum of Fine Arts in Valletta, Malta, in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patrimonju.org/Gallery.aspx?id=209027&amp;subId=114402|title=Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti :: Edward Caruana Dingli (1876-1950) - Portraits, Views and Folkloristic Scenes|last=|first=|date=|website=www.patrimonju.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Caruana was likely born at his father's [[Valletta]] house at 266, St Paul's Street, in 1866. He was the son of an influential man, [[A.A. Caruana|Prof. Antonio Annetto Caruana]], who was an [[archeologist]], [[librarian]], Director of Education, and Rector of the [[University of Malta]].

Caruana studied law at the [[University of Malta]], and continued his studies in [[England]] and in [[Italy]]. He became professor of [[political economy]] at the [[University of Malta]] in 1889, and later Professor of Constitutional Law. In 1895 he was also appointed Professor of [[Civil law (common law)|Civil Law]]. His teaching career spanned over thirty years. He retired in 1921.

==Works==
Intellectually, [[liberalism]] was what seemed to preoccupy Caruana most. Amongst his various works, one is noteworthy for its philosophical value. It is '''''Dell’Influsso della Filosofia Moderna''''' (On the Influence of Modern Philosophy).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 167}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 28-page booklet in Italian was published in [[Malta]] in 1889 (Tipografia Industriale di Giov. Muscat, Salita Guardanmangia, Pietà). The title is augmented with the qualification ''sulla Scienza e le Discipline Economico-sociali e della loro presente direzione'' (on Science and the Economic-Social Disciplines, and their present direction).[[File:John Caruana - Dell'Influsso.jpg|thumb|''Dell’Influsso della Filosfia Moderna'' (1889) of John Caruana]]

The publication reproduces a talk which Caruana delivered at the opening of the academic year 1889/90 of the [[University of Malta]] and the Lyceum. The talk was made on October 1, 1889, at the [[National Library of Malta]], [[Valletta]], when he was only 23 years old.

Caruana’s talk is an outright attack on [[liberalism]]. The writing has no divisions, and continuously cites [[Aristotle]] and various political economists. [[Cicero]] is cited too. Caruana exemplifies his arguments by drawing upon the situation in [[England]]. He explains how there [[liberalism]] was arresting the development of science, the economy, and the social studies. Caruana exults [[England]] as the bulwark of civilisation, and castigates [[liberalism]] for failing to keep [[England]]’s scientific, economic and social pre-eminence on an upward and forward trajectory.

== Personal ==
Caruana was married to Giovanna Galizia, a daughter of the celebrated Victorian architect and civil engineer [[Emanuele Luigi Galizia]]. E.L. Galizia was a personal friend of Caruana's father, the archaeologist [[Antonio Annetto Caruana]]. One of Giovanna's brothers, Major James Galizia CBE, was Director of Public Works and then Treasury Secretary in Malta's early 20th century imperial administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=bvvFDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=major+james+galizia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dcDKM9GZpc&amp;sig=gmD_Egj6Mc1zqgqF700KuxOkwwY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHteaEoJbZAhVF2qQKHaL8AR0Q6AEIVzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=major%20james%20galizia&amp;f=false|title=The Economy of Modern Malta: From the Nineteenth to the Twenty-First Century|last=Galizia|first=Paul Caruana|date=2016-12-20|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137565983|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another brother, Godwin Galizia, was a noteworthy neo-Romanesque and neo-classical architect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20171001/life-features/The-rise-and-fall-of-the-Britannia-Circus-in-Floriana.659347|title=The rise and fall of the Britannia Circus in Floriana|last=Ltd|first=Allied Newspapers|work=Times of Malta|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caruana had ten children with Giovanna Galizia. Their first son, Anton Caruana Galizia, a prominent Maltese lawyer, was killed outside the Casino Maltese in a German bombing raid in 1942, that left 40 others dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://maltagc70.wordpress.com/tag/hms-cleopatra/|title=HMS Cleopatra {{!}} Malta: War Diary|website=maltagc70.wordpress.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daphne Caruana Galizia]], the Maltese journalist assassinated in a car bomb in 2017, was married to their grandson, Peter Caruana Galizia.

[[Image:Azor - Institutiones morales, 1600 - 4463891.tif|thumb|''Institutiones morales'', 1600]] '''Juan Azor''' (1535 – 19 February 1603) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[philosopher]] and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[priest]].

==Life==
Azor was born at [[Lorca, Spain|Lorca]] in the province of [[Murcia]], southern Spain. He entered the Society of Jesus on 18 March 1559, and went on to become professor of [[philosophy]] and later of [[theology]], both dogmatic and moral, at [[Piacenza]], [[Alcalá de Henares|Alcalá]], and [[Rome]]. He was a member of the first committee appointed by Father General Acquaviva to draw up the Jesuit ''[[Ratio Studiorum]]''.

==Works==
Azor was a man of wide learning, versed in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and history. He is best known for his work on moral theology, in three folio volumes: ''Institutionum Moralium, in quibus universae quaestiones ad conscientiam recte aut prave factorum pertinentes breviter tractantur pars 1ma'', the first volume of which appeared in Rome in 1600, the second six years later, and the last in 1611. The work met with flattering success in Rome and at all the Continental seats of learning, and was honored by a special Brief of [[Pope Clement VIII]]. Numerous editions were brought out at [[Brescia]], [[Venice]], [[Lyon]], [[Cologne]], [[Ingolstadt]], [[Paris]], [[Cremona]], and Rome. The work continued to hold its position during the succeeding centuries, was strongly recommended by [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet]] in his synodal statutes, and was held in regard by [[Alphonsus Ligouri]]. 

[[Jean-Pierre Gury]] speaks of Azor as a moderate [[Probabiliorist]]. There are extant in manuscript other works by Azor; in Rome, in the Jesuit archives, a commentary on the ''Canticle of Canticles''; at [[Würzburg]], an exposition of the [[Psalms]] and at Alcalá, several theological treatises on parts of the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]].

[[File:Juan Eusebio Nieremberg.jpg|thumb|right|Juan Eusebio Nieremberg.]]
'''Juan Eusebio Nieremberg''' (1595 &amp;ndash; 7 April 1658) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Jesuit]] and [[mysticism|mystic]].

Nieremberg was born and died in [[Madrid]], but his parents were German. He studied the classics at the Royal Court, he studied science at [[Alcalá de Henares|Alcalá]] and [[canon law]] at Salamanca.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Juan Eusebio Nieremberg y Otin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits) in 1614, and subsequently became lecturer on [[scripture]] at the Jesuit seminary in Madrid until his death.

He was highly esteemed in devout circles as the author of ''De la afición y amor de Jesus'' (1630), and ''De la afición y amor de María'' (1630), both of which were translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Latin]]. These works, together with the ''Prodigios del amor divino'' (1641), are now forgotten, but Nieremberg's version (1656) of the ''Imitation'' is still a favorite, and his eloquent [[treatise]], ''De la hermosura de Dios y su amabilidad'' (1649), is the last classical manifestation of [[mysticism]] in [[Spanish literature]].

Nieremberg has not the enraptured vision of [[Teresa of Avila|St. Theresa]], nor the philosophic significance of [[Luis de Leon]], and the unvarying sweetness of his style is cloying; but he has exaltation, unction, insight, and his book forms no unworthy close to a great literary tradition.

==Eponymy==
The Spanish botanists [[Ruiz y Pavón|Ruiz and Pavón]] (Hipólito Ruiz López and Jose Antonio Pavón y Jimenez) named an attractive plant in the tobacco family, ''[[Nierembergia]]'', after him in their ''Flora Peruvianae, et Chilensis Prodromus'' (1794).

'''Leopold Flam''' (16 March 1912 &amp;ndash; 29 September 1995) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] philosopher. Together with [[Alphonse De Waelhens]], [[Chaïm Perelman]] and Rudolf Boehm, he was one of leading philosophers of Belgium from the 1960s until the 1980s.

Born in [[Antwerp]], Flam studied social sciences, political history, philosophy and chemistry at the [[University of Ghent]] and obtained a PhD in history. During [[World War II]] he was imprisoned in the [[Dossin Barracks]] in [[Mechelen transit camp|Mechelen]] and in the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]]. After the war he became a professor at the [[Free University of Brussels]].
 
He founded the ''Vlaamse vereniging voor Wijsbegeerte'' (1959) (E: Flemish League for Philosophy), later of Aurora. He became director of the magazine ''Geschiedenis in het onderwijs'' (E: History in education).

Flam died at his home in [[Vilvoorde]], near Brussels, on 29 September 1995.

In the study of knowledge, Methodism refers to the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] approach where one asks "How do we know?" before "What do we know?" The term appears in [[Roderick Chisholm]]'s "The [[Problem of the Criterion]]", and in the work of his student, [[Ernest Sosa]] ("The Raft and the Pyramid: Coherence versus Foundations in the Theory of Knowledge"). Methodism is contrasted with [[Epistemological particularism|particularism]], which answers the latter question before the former.

Since the question "How do we know?" does not presuppose that we know, it is receptive to skepticism. In this way, Sosa claims, [[David Hume|Hume]] no less than [[Descartes]] was an epistemological Methodist.

'''Nidotherapy''', after ''nidus'' (Latin: nest) is the name of  'a collaborative treatment involving the systematic assessment and modification of the environment to minimise the impact of any form of mental disorder on the individual or on society'.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; It was introduced for patients with severe mental illness, mainly [[schizophrenia]], and [[personality disorders]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; who had failed to respond to conventional treatments and were usually antagonistic to services. The aim of nidotherapy is not to change the person but to create a better fit between the environment (in all its forms) and the patient. As a consequence the patient may improve but this is not a direct result of treatment but because a more harmonious relationship has been created with the environment.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; An essential part of nidotherapy is a full environmental analysis carried out from the patient's standpoint and with their full cooperation (provided they have the capacity) so that any changes recommended and implemented (the nidopathway) are understood and preferably owned by the patient instead of being imposed. Although nidotherapy has been classed as a [[psychotherapy]] it differs in not trying to alter the patient, only the environment.

Nidotherapy has been used mainly in the treatment of severe mental illness in [[assertive community treatment]] and [[community mental health services]].&lt;sup&gt;4-6&lt;/sup&gt;

There is no good evidence that nidotherapy is effective: it is still an experimental therapy.&lt;ref name=Cochrane2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chamberlain IJ, Sampson S |title=Nidotherapy for people with schizophrenia |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=3 |issue= |pages=CD009929 |year=2013 |pmid=23543583 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009929.pub2 |type=Systematic review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Nishi Amane'''|西 周||extra= March 7, 1829 – January 30, 1897}} was a philosopher in [[Meiji period]] [[Japan]] who helped introduce [[Western philosophy]] into mainstream Japanese education.


==As a founder of Dokkyo University==

==Early life==
Nishi was born in [[Tsuwano Domain]] of [[Iwami Province]] (present day [[Tsuwano, Shimane|Tsuwano city]], [[Shimane Prefecture]]) as the son of a ''[[samurai]]'' [[physician]] who practiced [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medicine]]. In 1853, after studying Confucianism at his domain school and in [[Osaka]], Nishi was sent to [[Edo]] to study ''[[rangaku]]'', with the goal of becoming an interpreter for conducting business with the outside world via Dutch traders based at [[Dejima]] in [[Nagasaki]], his duties also included the translation of European books into Japanese for review by a select group of government officials within the [[Tokugawa bakufu]]. In 1854 Nishi, as well as several fellow Japanese intellectuals of the time, denounced the Japanese [[Feudal|feudal system]] and their ''samurai'' status in favor of a pursuit of Western studies, as these intellectuals believed that the Japanese feudal system was incompatible with Western studies.&lt;ref name=Havens&gt;{{cite book|last=Havens|first=Thomas|title=Nishi Amane and Modern Japanese Thought|year=1970|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0691-03080-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nishi was then appointed by the government as a ''Yogakusha'' or specialist scholar of Western learning.  Aside from Nishi, the Yogakusha included [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]], [[Mori Arinori]], and [[Nakamura Masanao]], who were all schooled in [[kangaku]], a kind of traditional Chinese learning.&lt;ref name=Cooney&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooney|first=Owen|title=Shaping Modern Japan Through Kangaku: The Case of Nishi Amane|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10022/AC:P:11876|work=Masters Thesis|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, in 1857, Nishi was appointed a professor at the ''[[Bansho Shirabesho]]''.

With increasing foreign pressure on Japan to end its [[sakoku|national isolation policy]], in 1862 the Shogunate decided to send Nishi and [[Tsuda Mamichi]] to the [[Netherlands]] to learn western concepts of [[political science]], [[constitutional law]], and [[economics]].   They departed in 1863 with a Dutch physician Dr. [[J. L. C. Pompe van Meerdervoort]], who had set up the first teaching hospital for [[Medicine|western medicine]] in Nagasaki.

The two Japanese students were put in the care of Professor [[Simon Vissering]], who taught Political Economy, Statistics and Diplomatic History at the [[Leiden University|University of Leyden]]. They developed a genuine friendship with Vissering who was conscious of the long-standing friendship between Japan and the Netherlands. He felt that the students' desire for knowledge would make them likely future participants in Japan's modernization. Vissering, a member of ''La Vertu'' Lodge No, 7, [[Leiden|Leyden]] introduced them to [[Freemasonry]], of which they became the first Japanese adherents on October 20, 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Australian National Library: [http://nla.gov.au/nla.ms-ms6681  MS 6681, Papers of Harold S. Williams (1898-1987) §42, ''Freemasonry'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meiji philosopher==
Nishi returned to Japan in 1865, and was an active participant in the [[Meiji Restoration]]. He promoted contact with the West and Western intellectualism because he feared that in the long run, a domestic resistance to modernization and change in relation to contact with the West would be more destructive to Japan than any plausible repercussions of contact with the West.&lt;ref name=Havens /&gt;   While abroad, Nishi became enthralled with [[Western philosophy]] and discerned that this intellectual pursuit subsisted at the foundation of Western civilization, and thus upon his return, he aimed to spread the Western Philosophy he came into contact with in order to help bridge the intellectual gap between the East and the West.&lt;ref name=Havens /&gt;   Nishi brought back to Japan the philosophies of [[positivism]], [[utilitarianism]] and [[empiricism]], which he transmitted through his writing, lectures and participation in [[Mori Arinori]]'s ''[[Meirokusha]]'', and contributed numerous articles to its journal.  Through Nishi’s transmissions, positivism was able to thrive in [[Meiji Japan]] because it gave the Japanese people a chance for stabilization and understanding in a society and culture that was undergoing rapid revolutionary change. To Nishi, positivism was the Western counterpart to Eastern practical studies ''(jitsugaku)'', with an emphasis on a hierarchy of knowledge similar to that of [[Confucianism]].&lt;ref name=Havens /&gt; Nishi’s translations of utilitarianism were also taken to well during the restoration period because utilitarianism promotes the social over the individual, which is a concept that is easily reconcilable with a Confucian-trained mind in Meiji Japan.  Utilitarianism also assisted Japanese modernization because Nishi and others have applied it to the justification of an industrial and commercial economy.&lt;ref name=cmn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Havens|first=Thomas|title=Comte, Mill, and the Thought of Nishi Amane in Meiji Japan|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|date=February 1968|volume=27|series=2|pages=217–228|jstor=2051748 .|doi=10.2307/2051748}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As for empiricism, Nishi and the rest of the Yogakusha intellectuals became leading figures in the [[Meiji Enlightenment]] (''bummei kaika'', i.e. "civilization and enlightenment"&lt;ref name=cmn /&gt; ), in which they promoted empiricism and practical studies instead of abstract reasoning in order for each person to attain an understanding of truth.&lt;ref name=cmn /&gt;

In 1868, Nishi translated and published "International Law". He also published an [[encyclopedia]], The ''[[Hyakugaku Renkan]],'' patterned after the French encyclopedia of [[Auguste Comte]], while promoting the teachings of [[John Stuart Mill]]. Nishi’s encyclopedia essentially classified and categorized the intellectual realm of Western civilization, including topics such as literature, natural sciences,  mathematics, theology, and politics.  One of Nishi’s most significant topics in his encyclopedia was the importance of the study of history, as he believed history was an objective, scholarly discipline that was necessary for the understanding of all human relations and interactions.  In this way, learning should not just be for learning’s sake, as it does not serve a greater purpose if it is just to learn.  This argument stood in direct contradiction to the Confucian denial of the study of history as a progress of human events.&lt;ref name=Havens /&gt;  Subsequently, the most distinguished topic of Nishi’s encyclopedia is his elaboration on philosophy.  Nishi split the study philosophy into numerous subtopics, citing logic as the most important.&lt;ref name=Havens /&gt;  He rejected the deductive method traditionally used by [[Confucianism|Confucian scholars]] in favor of [[inductive logic]] as a more scientific way of learning. 
In 1873, Nishi helped to found Japan’s first scholarly society for solely academics (and not politics) known as the [[Meirokusha|Meiji Six Society]].  The goals of this society were to educate and enlighten the people because they believed Japan needed an enlightened populace in order to understand and live up to its political and moral responsibilities of modernization and restoration.&lt;ref name=thecase&gt;{{cite journal|last=Havens|first=Thomas|title=Scholars and Politics in Nineteenth-Century Japan: The Case of Nishi Amane|journal=Modern Asian Studies|year=1968|volume=2|series=4|pages=315–324|jstor=311711|doi=10.1017/s0026749x00001906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nishi felt that if the new state were to become enlightened as it should be, there would be no more conflict between political and scholarly obligations within the Meiji Six Society, and within Japanese society in general.&lt;ref name=thecase /&gt;  Nishi was unique in this society in that he maintained a view of Japanese modernization in which he reconciled traditional Confucianism with Western Philosophy and [[pragmatism]] together in order to ascertain the correct path for Japan to take.

In his ''Hyakuichi-Shinron'', published in 1874, he went so far as to reject Confucian ethics altogether as no longer appropriate for Japan, but was careful not to reject Japanese heritage. This publication was an original piece of Nishi scholarship that dealt with two main topics: the separation of politics and morals, and the distinction between human and physical principles.&lt;ref name=Havens /&gt;  In regards to the first topic, Nishi felt that the later Confucians who presumed that self-cultivation was all that was necessary for ruling society were wrong, but that the original Confucians who proclaimed that the morality taught had practical application in society were right.   What is more is that Nishi portrayed [[Confucius]] as a teacher of politics with a sideline of morality.&lt;ref name=Havens /&gt; Nishi attempted to sever the philosophical connection between morality and politics because he thought that although they obtained the same objective – to better people’s lives – they used different methods to obtain this objective, stemming from his belief that rightness was at the base of law, whereas goodness was at the base of morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minear|first=Richard| authorlink=Richard Minear|title=Nishi Amane and the Reception of Western Law in Japan|journal=Monumenta Nipponica|date=Summer 1973|volume=28|series=2|pages=151–175|jstor=2383861 .|doi=10.2307/2383861}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Nishi, morality is an omnipresent thing existing within every human activity, but law is strictly limited to its defined aspects of human relations.  Though morality must rely on the law within politics to keep order, it is morality, rather than the law, that will eventually penetrate and shape the people’s minds and values.&lt;ref name=Havens /&gt; Nishi concludes this first topic with the idea that when it comes to civilization, politics is the machinery and morality is the lubricant that is responsible for keeping the machinery running and intact.&lt;ref name=Havens /&gt; In the second topic, Nishi determines, for the first time in the East, the relationship and differences between human principles and physical principles.  He discerns that physical principles and laws are ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' prerequisites for the existence of society, whereas human principles and laws are ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' devices derived from these physical principles and laws.  Because human principles are ''a posteriori'', they have infinite possibilities of distinctions and greater flexibility in premonitions.&lt;ref name=Havens /&gt; Nishi considers morality and law to be human principles; however, that does not mean that he deems morality man-made; rather, there are feelings (not unlike the [[Mencius#The Four Beginnings .28or Sprouts.29|Mencian Sprouts]]) that exist in all humans, and it is up to human will to act upon those feelings of morality that are constant in human nature.  What Nishi’s discernment led to was the first expression in the East that human society was not, in fact, a product of the invariable structure of the universe.  In this way, Nishi opened up room for humans to divert the inevitability of the social hierarchy.&lt;ref name=Havens /&gt;

In ''Jinsei Sampo Setsu'' (1875) he urged all Japanese to seek the goals of health, knowledge and wealth, or what he called the “three treasures,"in place of Confucian subservience and frugality.  In order for society to maintain a balance of these three treasures, Nishi felt that individuals should not disrespect others’ treasures, and that individuals should assist others in acquiring their treasures, thus, if the three treasures were honored and preserved, all of society would be independent and free.&lt;ref name=Havens /&gt; Moreover, Nishi thought that the Japanese government should be responsible for promoting the pursuit of these three treasures in society as well, and in turn, the political and national strengthening within the [[Meiji Enlightenment]] would not require Western rule or governmental tactics.&lt;ref name=Havens /&gt; Nishi promoted that if policy were structured based on enhancing general happiness through an equal balance of domestic enforcement of law, diplomacy and military defense of society, encouragement of industry and finance, and obtainment of the state’s own three treasures, this would be the key to good government.&lt;ref name=Havens /&gt;

==Meiji bureaucrat==
While working at the Ministry of Military Affairs, Nishi helped in drafting the [[Conscription Ordinance of 1873]], which introduced universal [[conscription]] and laid the foundation for the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. In his lectures to the military, he emphasized discipline and obedience over seniority and hierarchy. These ideals found their way into the subsequent [[Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors]] in 1882.
 
In 1879 Nishi was made the head of the [[Tokyo Academy]], and by 1882 was a member of the ''[[Genrōin]].'' He became a member of the [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]] of the [[Diet of Japan]]  after the [[Japanese general election, 1890]].

He was ennobled with the title of ''danshaku'' ([[baron]]) in the ''[[kazoku]]'' peerage system. His grave is at Aoyama Cemetery in [[Tokyo]].

==Legacy==
[[Image:Nishi Amane poststamp.jpg|thumb|right|Nishi Amane]]
Nishi Amane is considered to be the father of [[Western philosophy]] in Japan.  Nishi was a tireless advocate of Western civilization as a role model for Japan's modernization, stressing the need to evolve without losing the Japanese character. He was responsible for using classical Chinese terminology to translate and/or transmit common terms used in Western Philosophy into Eastern dialect, and many of these philosophical words are currently in use today.&lt;ref&gt;Marra, Michael F. (2002). {{google books|VCcLEBldTagC|''Japanese hermeneutics,'' pp. 89–96.|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By using classical Chinese terminology, that is, something of cultural importance and tradition to [[Meiji Japan]], Nishi was able to generate enthusiasm for reform, as traditional [[Chinese characters]] were seen by the Eastern population as a notion of authority.&lt;ref name=tandr&gt;{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Alex|title=Traveling Sages: Translation and Reform in Japan and China in the Late Nineteenth Century|url=http://studiesonasia.illinoisstate.edu/seriesIV/documents/Alex_Murphy.pdf|work=Studies on Asia|publisher=Kenyon College|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Furthermore, it is the nature of [[Chinese characters]] to be combined in various ways to form [[neologisms]], as the characters often obtain multiple meanings and are capable of interchangeability.&lt;ref name=Cooney /&gt; The most notable term that Nishi was responsible for is the term {{nihongo||哲学|tetsugaku}} (in Japan, or ''zhéxué'' in China), which he coined in 1873, taken from the characters meaning "wisdom" and "learning".&lt;ref name=icp&gt;{{cite journal|last=Defoort|first=Carline|title=Is "Chinese Philosophy" a Proper Name?

Kyoto: Nichibunken.[https://www.academia.edu/6790886/What_is_Japanese_about_Japanese_Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; (''xīxián'', in Chinese, more specifically means “learning to become a wise and knowledgeable person.”&lt;ref name=mou&gt;{{cite book|last=Mou|first=Bo|title=History of Chinese Philosophy|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Canada|isbn=0-203-00286-5|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Though Nishi felt that Confucius for the East was comparable to [[Socrates]] for the West,&lt;ref name=Havens /&gt; in creating this term ''tesugaku'', Nishi was actually attempting to separate the notion of [[Western philosophy]] from the notion of [[Eastern thought]], as he believed the two to entail two different things.&lt;ref name=icp /&gt; Moreover, Nishi did not concur that philosophy even existed in the East, as he studied philosophy solely in the context of the Western style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Godart|first=George Clinton|title="Philosophy" or "Religion"? The Confrontation with Foreign Categories in Late Nineteenth Century Japan|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|date=January 2008|volume=69|series=1|pages=71–91|jstor=30139668|doi=10.1353/jhi.2008.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, regardless of Nishi’s personal beliefs on the definition of “philosophy”, it is still because of him that China and Japan have even been able to engage in the discourse of “philosophy.” &lt;ref name=Steben /&gt; In ''Hyakugaku Renkan'', Nishi concluded that because the discourse of philosophy is innately concerned with addressing and attacking theories of past writers and philosophers in order to portray new discoveries, the field of philosophy is constantly being made over.&lt;ref name=Havens /&gt; Under this light, Nishi opens up the possibility of vast Eastern participation in the discourse of philosophy, regardless of whether or not [[Eastern thought]] can be reconciled with [[Western philosophy|Western Philosophy]].  During his time, Nishi concurred that although the West was superior in the realm of philosophy, the East still had the means to become better equipped in philosophy, as he professed that philosophy was essential for making the East intellectually modernized.&lt;ref name=Havens /&gt;

He was honored on a 10-yen [[commemorative postage stamp]] in Japan in 1952.

{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2012}}
'''Open-source economics''' is an [[Platform (economics)|economic platform]] based on [[open collaboration]] for the production of software, services, or other products.

First applied to the [[open-source]] [[software industry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Josh Lerner|first=Jean Tirole|title=Some Simple Economics of Open Source|url=https://intranet.cs.aau.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/Education/Courses/2010/ENT/Lerner___Tirole_2002.pdf|work=The Journal of Industrial Economics|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; this economic model may be applied to a wide range of enterprises.

Some characteristics of open-source economics may include: work or investment carried out without express expectation of return; products or services produced through collaboration between users and developers; and no direct individual ownership of the enterprise itself.

As of recently there were no known commercial organizations outside of software that employ open-source economics as a structural base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lerner |first=Josh |first2=Jean |last2=Tirole |title=The Economics Of Technology Sharing: Open Source and Beyond |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |year=2005 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=99–120 |doi=10.1257/0895330054048678 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are organizations that provide services and products, or at least instructions for building such services or products, that use an open-source economic model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Global Village Construction Set|title=Open source ecology|url=http://opensourceecology.org/gvcs.php|work=Industrial Machines|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Arduino|title=Open-source electronics|url=http://www.arduino.cc/|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of open-source is based on user participation. "Networked environment makes possible a new modality of organizing production: radically decentralized, collaborative, and non-proprietary; based on sharing resources and outputs among widely distributed, loosely connected individuals who cooperate with each other without relying on either market signals or managerial commands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yochai|first=Benkler|title=The Wealth of Networks|url=http://www.congo-education.net/wealth-of-networks/ch-03.htm#3-1|work=Chapter 3|publisher=Yale University Press|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incentives ==

=== Individual incentives ===
While initially it might seem that contributing to open-source software goes against basic economic principles, there are several ways in which people are incentivized to contribute to open-source projects. Some reasons are not strictly economically beneficial to the contributor, but are related to leisure activities.&lt;ref name="linfo incentives"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.linfo.org/open_source_development_incentives.html|title=Incentives to Develop Free Software|website=www.linfo.org|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; People program as a hobby and are incentivized to contribute to open-source projects simply because they enjoy it. There are also altruistic reasons, such as creating a better world and donating one's time to a project one believes in. 

There are also several economic arguments for producing open-source software. A potential economic benefit is the enhancement of a person's reputation or resume.&lt;ref name="linfo incentives"/&gt; A top contributor to open-source software may get easier access to venture capital money or better access to jobs. Further, developing open-source software can be cheaper than purchasing commercial software, thereby saving a contributor money.&lt;ref name="linfo incentives"/&gt;

=== Corporate incentives ===
Corporations have several incentives to contribute to open-source projects, including talent acquisition. Some software developers are huge proponents of open-source software, and if they have used a company’s open-source software, or are aware of it, they may be more interested in working for that company.&lt;ref name="quora why"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-do-huge-profit-oriented-software-companies-contribute-to-open-source-software-when-it-is-akin-to-doing-charity-work-which-runs-against-their-commercial-instinct|title=Why do huge profit-oriented software companies contribute to open-source software when it is akin to doing charity work which runs against their commercial instinct? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Twitter created Bootstrap, an easy-to-use framework for designing websites. Bootstrap is very popular and is used by many people. Therefore, by open-sourcing Bootstrap, Twitter is able to increase brand awareness due to the large amount of people developing products with their software, which should help them attract talent. 

It is common for companies to not open-source core parts of their products that are critical for business, but helpful auxiliary processes and infrastructure.&lt;ref name="quora why"/&gt; This way, through open sourcing they get all the positive aspects of talent acquisition and branding, and do not give up market share. 

By making a product open-source, more people can contribute. These contributions can help develop the software faster, so it may also be beneficial for companies to open-source to get free help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.445.7134&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Understanding Best Practices in Free/Open Source Software Development|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect on corporations ==

=== Monopolies ===
Open-source software can help protect against monopolies. For example, the rise of Linux, an open-source computer operating system, helped prevent Microsoft from being considered a monopolist.&lt;ref name="brookings mono"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/microsoft-a-monopoly-no-more/|title=Microsoft, A Monopoly No More {{!}} Brookings Institution|date=2017-04-29|work=Brookings|access-date=2017-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft considered Linux to be their main competitor during the 1990s.&lt;ref name="brookings mono"/&gt; Many computer makers offer Linux or Windows for their users, and a large percentage of mobile phone and tablet operating systems are Android, which is a Linux variant. Not only are monopolies affected, but several other businesses with strongholds are affected. Microsoft office has open-source competitors such as Libre Office. Internet Explorer has Chrome and Firefox as open-source competitors.

=== Open-source for-profit businesses ===
Numerous companies have created businesses around open-source software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thevarguy.com/open-source-application-software-companies/top-50-open-source-companies-where-are-they-now|title=Top 50 Open Source Companies: Where Are They Now?|website=thevarguy.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do this by publishing all of their code open-source, then charging for training, certifications, add-ons, and other services. One example is Red Hat, which produces operating systems. Red Hat sells services such as 24/7 support, integration into company's products, and training.&lt;ref name="techcrunch redhat"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/13/please-dont-tell-me-you-want-to-be-the-next-red-hat/|title=Why There Will Never Be Another RedHat: The Economics Of Open Source|last=Contributor|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red Hat was the pioneer for the open source business model, and was valued at approximately $16 billion as of April 2017.&lt;ref name="techcrunch redhat"/&gt; Other examples include Mozilla, which created the web browser Firefox, and Google, which created Android, an open-source mobile operating system based on Linux.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7030">The '''Phoenix Affirmations''' is a set of twelve principles originally penned by a group of clergy and laypeople from [[Phoenix, Arizona]], in an attempt to articulate clearly the broad strokes of the emerging [[Christianity|Christian faith]].  Pastors, theologians,  and biblical scholars from every mainline denomination, with degrees from major seminaries and divinity schools, added input.  The first published commentary on The Phoenix Affirmations appeared in 2006 ([[Jossey-Bass]]), written by Dr. Eric Elnes.  According to [[Phyllis Tickle]], author of The Great Emergence, Elnes’ The Phoenix Affirmations: A New Vision for the Future of Christianity&lt;ref&gt;¹Elnes, Eric.  The Phoenix Affirmations:  A New Vision for the Future of Christianity.  (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Books, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; stands today as the clearest, most articulate presentation of [[Progressive Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;²Tickle, Phyllis.  The Great Emergence: How Christianity is Changing and Why. (Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 2008), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The Phoenix Affirmations have been widely adopted by Christian organizations who identify themselves as "progressive." &lt;ref&gt;E.g., The Center for Progressive Christianity publishes an [http://progressivechristianity.org/phoenix-affirmations-study-guide/ online study guide].  They serve as stated "[http://www.onfaithonline.tv/darkwoodbrew/about-dwb/ Core Values]" for the internet television program, [http://www.darkwoodbrew.org Darkwood Brew], as well as for progressive churches such as [http://countrysideucc.org/about-us/our-church/beliefs/ Countryside Community Church in Omaha, Nebraska].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Phoenix Affirmations take on a threefold structure, based on the Three Great Loves identified by [[Jesus]] and affirmed within [[Judaism]]:  Love of God, Love of Neighbor, and Love of Self.  
(Matthew 22:34-40//Mark 12:28-31//Luke 10:25-28; cf. Deuteronomy 6:5; Leviticus 19:18)
The Phoenix Affirmations are not meant to be a static set of principles to stand for all time.  The authors attached a version number to them—currently 3.8—indicating that the Affirmations are the product of continual modification and may be amended in the future in light of new awareness and deeper understanding of what is believed to be God’s call.  In contrast to a [[Creed]], the Affirmations are not meant to serve as a test of faith against which a person’s Christian commitments are to be verified.  Diana Butler Bass described the Phoenix Affirmations as follows: "Together, they spell out the theological basis of Protestant liberality: being open and humble, yet grounded in the biblical story of God's dream for humankind."&lt;ref&gt;Butler Bass, Diana. Christianity for the Rest of Us: How the Neighborhood Church is Transforming the Faith.  (New York: HarperCollins, 2006), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, some members of an organization called CrossWalk America&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcpc.org/template/page.cfm?page_id=101 CrossWalk America Joins Forces with TCPC]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; spent 5 months, walking 2,500 miles from Phoenix, AZ, to [[Washington, D.C.]], to deliver a set of The Phoenix Affirmations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcpc.org/template/page.cfm?page_id=102 Phoenix Affirmation Summary Version]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a [[Labor Day]] Rally.  This walk was the subject of the feature length film, The Asphalt Gospel&lt;ref&gt;The Asphalt Gospel (Creatista Productions, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the book, Asphalt Jesus: Finding A New Christian Faith Along the Highways of America,&lt;ref&gt;Elnes, Eric. Asphalt Jesus: Finding A New Christian Faith Along the Highways of America. (San Francisco: Jossey Bass Books, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; which also contains specific commentary on the Affirmations.

J. Shelby Spong, theologian and author, was present in Washington at the end of the walk.  Spong wrote:  “The Phoenix Affirmations call on Christians to love God in all of God’s expressions, to love our neighbors, including our neighbors who call God by a different name and even our neighbors who use the literal texts of the [[Bible]] as a weapon with which to attack the objects of their prejudice, and finally to love ourselves, just as we are, male, female, black, white, brown, gay, straight, [[transgender]], [[bisexual]], learned and unlearned, left-handed and right-handed, indeed in all of the rich variety of the human family. We are to stand as one against any religious system that encourages [[self-hatred]], that manipulates through guilt, or that presents God as a punishing parent who delights in our groveling before the throne of grace.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/18241.htm ³John Mark Ministries, John Shelby Spong and the Phoenix Affirmations]&lt;/ref&gt;

THE PHOENIX AFFIRMATIONS
Version 3.8

CHRISTIAN LOVE OF GOD INCLUDES:

1.  Walking fully in the Path of Jesus without denying the legitimacy of other paths that God may    provide for humanity.

2.  Listening for God’s Word, which comes through daily prayer and [[meditation]], studying the ancient testimonies which we call [[Scripture]], and attending to God’s present activity in the world.

3.  Celebrating the God whose Spirit pervades and whose glory is reflected in all of God’s Creation, including the earth and its [[ecosystem]]s, the sacred and secular, the Christian and non-Christian, the human and non-human.

4.  Expressing our love in worship that is as sincere, vibrant, and artful as it is scriptural.

CHRISTIAN LOVE OF NEIGHBOR INCLUDES:

5.  Engaging people authentically, as Jesus did, treating all as creations made in God’s very image, regardless of [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], age, physical or mental ability, nationality, or economic class.

6.  Standing, as Jesus does, with the outcast and oppressed, the denigrated and afflicted, seeking peace and justice with or without the support of others.

7.  Preserving religious freedom and the church’s ability to speak prophetically to government by resisting the commingling of church and state.

8.  Walking humbly with God, acknowledging our own shortcomings while honestly seeking to understand and call forth the best in others, including those who consider us their enemies.

CHRISTIAN LOVE OF SELF INCLUDES:

9.  Basing our lives on the faith that in Christ all things are made new and that we, and all people, are loved beyond our wildest imaginations—for eternity.

10.  Claiming the sacredness of both our minds and our hearts, and recognizing that faith and science, doubt and belief serve the pursuit of truth.

11.  Caring for our bodies and insisting on taking time to enjoy the benefits of prayer, reflection, worship, and recreation in addition to work.

12.  Acting on the faith that we are born with a meaning and purpose, a [[vocation]] and ministry that serve to strengthen and extend God’s realm of love.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3619">'''Pierre Hyacinthe Azaïs''' (1 March 1766 – 22 January 1845) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]].

==Life==
Azaïs was born at [[Sorèze]] and died at [[Paris]]. He spent his early years as a teacher and a village organist. At the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]] he viewed it with favor, but was soon disgusted at the violence of its methods. A critical pamphlet drew upon him the hatred of the revolutionists, and it was not until 1806 that he was able to settle in Paris. In 1809 he published his great work, ''Des Compensations dans les destines humaines'' (5th ed. 1846), which pleased [[Napoleon]] so much that he made its author professor at [[École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|St Cyr]]. In 1811 he became inspector of the public library at [[Avignon]], and from 1812 to 1815 he held the same position at [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]. The [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] government at first suspected him as a Bonapartist, but at length granted him a pension. From that time he occupied himself in lecturing and the publication of philosophical works.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In the ''Compensations'' he sought to prove that, on the whole, happiness and misery are equally balanced, and therefore that men should accept the government which is given them rather than risk the horrors of revolution. ''Le principe de l'inégalité naturelle et essentielle dans les destinées humaines conduit inevitablement au fanatisme revolutionnaire ou au fanatisme religieux.''; The principles of compensation and equilibrium are found also in the physical universe, the product of matter and force, whose cause is God. Force, naturally expansive and operating on the homogeneous atoms which constitute elemental matter, is subject to the law of equilibrium, or equivalence of action and reaction. The development of pheaomena under this law may be divided into three stagesthe physical, the physiological, the intellectual and moral. The immaterial in man is the expansive force inherent in him. Moral and political phenomena are the result of the opposing forces of progress and preservation, and their perfection lies in the fulfilment of the law of equilibrium or universal harmony. This may be achieved in seven thousand years, when man will vanish from the world. In an additional five thousand, a similar equilibrium will obtain in the physical sphere, which will then itself pass away.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In addition to his philosophical work, Azaïs studied music under his father, [[Pierre Hyacinthe Azaïs (1743-1796)]], professor of music at Sorèze and Toulouse, and composer of sacred music in the style of Gossec. He wrote for the ''Revue musicale'' a series of articles entitled ''Acoustique fondamentale'' (1831), containing an ingenious, but now exploded, theory of the vibration of the air.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The son's other works are: ''Système universel'' (8 vols., 1812); ''Du Sort de l'homme'' (3 vols., 1820); ''Cours de philosophie'' (8 vols., 1824), reproduced as ''Explication universelle'' (3 vols., 1826–1828); ''Jeunesse, maturité, religion, philosophie'' (1837); ''De la phrénologie, du magnétisme, et de la folie'' (1843).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

'''''Projet de communauté philosophe''''' (translated as '''''Project for a Philosophical Community''''') is a book written by the [[French people|French]] philosopher [[Victor d'Hupay]], published in 1777.

== Review == 
This book can be seen as a cornerstone in the history of [[communism]], as it describes for the first time how "communists" (people living in a "[[commune]]") should understand this philosophy. 
In this work, the author advises to 'share all economic and material products between inhabitants of the "commune", so that all may benefit from everybody's work'.&lt;ref name="Jean-Pierre Cassely, 2016"&gt;Cassely, 2016 : ''Aix insolite et secrète'' JonGlez {{pp.|192-193}} ([http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb45058387v references from the Bibliothèque nationale de France])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Restif de la Bretonne]], a contemporary and friend of d'Hupay, thus describes him as a "communist" in a 1785 publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hupay.fr/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131191812/http://www.hupay.fr/ |archivedate=2017-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grandjonc Jacques, 1983"&gt;Grandjonc Jacques,1983: ''Quelques dates à propos des termes communiste et communisme'' In: Mots, n°7, Octobre 1983 {{p.|146}} ([http://www.persee.fr/doc/mots_0243-6450_1983_num_7_1_1122 reference on the Persée library])&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was partly written in d'Hupay's own [[bastide]] in [[Meyreuil]], near [[Aix-en-Provence]], where he was determined to set his own commune and live by the communist philosophy, with neighbours and friends.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hupay.fr/pages/vie-d-hupay.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Right to Equal Protection''' is a concept that was introduced into the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] of the [[United States]] during the [[American Civil War]].  It is intended to protect the rights provided by the United States Constitution for all individuals regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, etc.  It is fundamentally based on the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] of the Constitution, intended to secure rights for former slaves.  The Constitution is claimed to uphold [[racial equality|racial]] and [[gender equality]], but until the 1950s, enforcing  [[slavery]], [[Racial segregation|segregation]], and [[gender inequality]] were major aspects of the history of the American federal government.

==Constitutional basis of equal rights==
In 1896, the [[United States Supreme Court]] determined that the "[[separate but equal]]" doctrine was constitutional in the case ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]].'' Although the Fourteenth Amendment abolished slavery, and intended to end [[racial segregation]], the Southern States initiated [[Jim Crow Laws]], which segregated people of color in public schools, public transportation, restaurants, etc.  The ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson meant that as long as facilities for both colored and white individuals were equal, it was constitutional.  In 1954, the ruling of Plessy v. Ferguson was overturned in the Supreme Court case ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]. ''The Supreme Court determined that the establishment of separate schools for whites and blacks inherently unequal, and as a result unconstitutional.  This ruling put an end to segregation on the basis of equal rights of protection.

These court cases however had no bearing on [[women's suffrage]] or equality.  The [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] of the United States Constitution legislates that neither the individual states of the United States nor its federal government may deny a citizen the right to vote because of the citizen's sex.

==Right to equal protection in the workplace==
In recent years equal protection of citizens within the workplace has become a major issue.  As a result of various amendments, citizens can not be discriminated against in work places based on terms of gender, ethnicity, race, height, or other similar differences.  For example, a potential employee who is unusually short and weak can not be denied a job in a police force based upon his size.

==Equal Rights Amendment==
An [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA), which would grant [[women's rights|equal rights to women]], has been a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution since 1972. Having failed to meet the deadline requirements for passage incorporated into the original proposed amendment, efforts to reintroduce and ratify similar amendments have come before Congress every year since 1982.

==Opposition to equal rights==
The very existence of equal rights, however, is controversial because it sets boundaries and makes clear the differences among citizens.  In order to declare something as equal, there must exist a comparison to something that is unequal.  In doing this, people are forced to compare equality in terms of education, wage, and many other controversial considerations.

'''Rudolf Otto''' (25 September 1869 – 6 March 1937) was an eminent [[Germany|German]] [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[theology|theologian]], [[philosophy|philosopher]], and [[comparative religion]]ist. He is regarded as one of the most influential [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]] in the early twentieth century and is best known for his concept of the ''[[numinous]]'', a profound emotional experience he argued was at the heart of the world's religions.&lt;ref name="adler-num"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adler|first1=Joseph|title=Rudolf Otto's Concept of the Numinous|url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln101/Otto.htm|publisher=[[Kenyon College]]|location=[[Gambier, Ohio]]|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his work started in the domain of [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Christian theology]], its main thrust was always apologetical, seeking to defend religion against [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] critiques.&lt;ref name="encyc-com"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Alles |first=Gregory D. |title=Otto, Rudolf |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion | location=[[Farmington Hills, Michigan]] |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Thomson Gale]] |date=2005 |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/otto-rudolf |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otto eventually came to conceive of his work as part of a science of religion, which was divided into the [[philosophy of religion]], the [[history of religion]], and the [[psychology of religion]].&lt;ref name="encyc-com"/&gt;

==Life==
Born in [[Peine]] near [[Hanover]], Otto was raised in a pious [[Christianity|Christian]] family.&lt;ref name="yourdiction"&gt;{{cite web|title=Louis Karl Rudolf Otto Facts|url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/louis-karl-rudolf-otto|website=YourDictionary.com|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the Gymnasium Andreanum in [[Hildesheim]] and studied at the universities of [[University of Erlangen|Erlangen]] and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], where he wrote his [[dissertation]] on [[Martin Luther]]'s understanding of the [[Holy Spirit]] (''Die Anschauung von heiligen Geiste bei Luther: Eine historisch-dogmatische Untersuchung''), and his [[habilitation]] on [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (''Naturalistische und religiöse Weltansicht''). By 1906, he held a position as [[professor|extraordinary professor]], and in 1910 he received an [[honorary doctorate]] from the [[University of Giessen]].

Otto's fascination with non-Christian religions was awakened during an extended trip from 1911-1912 through [[North Africa]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[British India]], [[China]], [[Japan]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Meland|first1=Bernard E.|title=Rudolf Otto {{!}} German philosopher and theologian|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rudolf-Otto|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online]]|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cited a 1911 visit to a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[synagogue]] as a key inspiration for the theme of the Holy he would later develop.&lt;ref name="yourdiction"/&gt; Otto became a member of the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|German parliament]] in 1913 and retained this position through the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; In 1917, he spearheaded an effort to simplify the system of weighting votes in [[Prussia]]n elections.&lt;ref name="encyc-com"/&gt; He then served in the post-war constituent assembly in 1918, and remained involved in the politics of the [[Weimar Republic]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

Meanwhile, in 1915, he became ordinary professor at the [[University of Breslau]], and in 1917, at the [[University of Marburg]]'s Divinity School, then one of the most famous [[Protestant]] [[seminary|seminaries]] in the world. Although he received several other calls, he remained in [[Marburg]] for the rest of his life. He retired in 1929 but continued writing afterward. On 6 March 1937, he died of [[pneumonia]], after suffering serious injuries falling about twenty meters from a tower in October 1936. There were lasting rumors that the fall was a [[suicide attempt]] but this has never been confirmed.&lt;ref name="encyc-com" /&gt; He is buried in the Marburg cemetery.

==Thought==
===Influences===
In his early years Otto was most influenced by the [[German idealist]] theologian and philosopher [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and his conceptualization of the category of the religious as a type of emotion or consciousness irreducible to ethical or rational [[epistemology|epistemologies]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; In this, Otto saw Schleiermacher as having recaptured a sense of holiness lost in the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Schleiermacher described this religious feeling as one of absolute dependence; Otto eventually rejected this characterization as too closely analogous to earthly dependence and emphasized the complete otherness of the religious feeling from the mundane world (see below).&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; In 1904, while a student at the [[University of Göttingen]], Otto became a proponent of the philosophy of [[Jakob Fries]] along with two fellow students.&lt;ref name="encyc-com"/&gt;

===Early works===
Otto's first book, ''Naturalism and Religion'' (1904) divides the world [[ontology|ontologically]] into the mental and the physical, a position reflecting [[Cartesian dualism]]. Otto argues [[consciousness]] cannot be explained in terms of physical or neural processes, and also accords it [[epistemology|epistemological]] primacy by arguing all knowledge of the physical world is mediated by personal experience. On the other hand, he disagrees with [[Descartes]]' characterization of the mental as a rational realm, positing instead that rationality is built upon a nonrational intuitive realm.&lt;ref name="encyc-com"/&gt;

In 1909, he published his next book, ''The Philosophy of Religion Based on Kant and Fries'', in which he examines the thought of [[Kant]] and Fries and from there attempts to build a philosophical framework within which [[religious experience]] can take place. While Kant's philosophy said thought occurred in a rational domain, Fries diverged and said it also occurred in practical and aesthetic domains; Otto pursued Fries' line of thinking further and suggested another nonrational domain of the thought, the religious. He felt intuition was valuable in rational domains like mathematics, but subject to the corrective of reason, whereas religious intuitions might not be subject to that corrective.&lt;ref name="encyc-com"/&gt;

These two early works were influenced by the [[rationalism|rationalist]] approaches of [[Immanuel Kant]] and Jakob Fries. Otto stated that they focused on the rational aspects of the divine (the "Ratio aeterna") whereas his next (and most influential) book focused on the nonrational aspects of the divine.&lt;ref name="friesian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ross|first1=Kelley|title=Rudolf Otto (1869-1937)|url=http://www.friesian.com/otto.htm|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Idea of the Holy''===
Otto's most famous work, ''The Idea of the Holy'', was first published in German in 1917 as ''Das Heilige - Über das Irrationale in der Idee des Göttlichen und sein Verhältnis zum Rationalen''. It was one of the most successful German theological books of the 20th century, has never gone out of print, and is now available in about 20 languages. The first English translation was published in 1923 under the title ''The Idea of the Holy: An Inquiry into the Non-Rational Factor in the Idea of the Divine and its Relation to the Rational''. Otto felt people should first do serious rational study of God, before turning to the non-rational element of God as he did in this book.&lt;ref name="friesian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="idea-holy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Otto|first1=Rudolf|title=The Idea of the Holy|date=1923|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-500210-5|url=https://archive.org/details/theideaoftheholy00ottouoft|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vii}}

In ''The Idea of the Holy'', Otto writes that while the concept of "the holy" is often used to convey moral perfection – and does entail this – it contains another distinct element, beyond the ethical sphere, for which he coined the term ''[[numinous]]'' based on the Latin word [[numen]] ("divine power").&lt;ref name="idea-holy"/&gt;{{rp|5–7}} (The term is [[etymology|etymologically]] unrelated to Immanuel Kant's ''[[noumenon]]'', a Greek term which Kant used to refer to an unknowable reality underlying sensations of the thing.) He explains the numinous as a "non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self". This mental state "presents itself as ''ganz Andere'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Otto|first=Rudolf|editor-first=Gregory D. |editor-last=Alles |title=Autobiographical and Social Essays |url=https://books.google.com/?id=D13tugwJcY0C&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=1996 |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |location=Berlin |id={{ISBN|3-11014519-7}} |isbn=978-3-110-14519-9|page=[https://books.google.com/?id=D13tugwJcY0C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=%22ganz+andere%22%22ganz+an%22%22ders+%5bwholly+other%5d%22 30].}}&lt;/ref&gt; wholly other, a condition absolutely ''[[sui generis]]'' and incomparable whereby the human being finds himself utterly abashed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Alice L.|last1=Eckardt|first2=A.

In other words, our ''X'' cannot, strictly speaking, be taught, it can only be evoked, awakened in the mind."&lt;ref name="idea-holy"/&gt;{{rp|7}} Chapters 4 to 6 are devoted to attempting to evoke the numinous and its various aspects. He writes:

{{Quote |The feeling of it may at times come sweeping like a gentle tide pervading the mind with a tranquil mood of deepest worship. It may pass over into a more set and lasting attitude of the soul, continuing, as it were, thrillingly vibrant and resonant, until at last it dies away and the soul resumes its “profane,” non-religious mood of everyday experience. [...] It has its crude, barbaric antecedents and early manifestations, and again it may be developed into something beautiful and pure and glorious. It may become the hushed, trembling, and speechless humility of the creature in the presence of—whom or what? In the presence of that which is a Mystery inexpressible and above all creatures.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="idea-holy"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}}}}

He describes it as a mystery ({{lang-la|[[wikt:mysterium#Latin|mysterium]]}}) that is at once terrifying (''[[wikt:tremendum|tremendum]]'') and fascinating (''[[wikt:fascinans|fascinans]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Otto, Rudolf (1996). [https://books.google.com/?&amp;id=D13tugwJcY0C&amp;q=%22mysterium+tremendum+et+fascinans%22 ''Mysterium tremendum et fascinans''].&lt;/ref&gt; Otto felt that the ''numinous'' was most strongly present in the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s, but that it was also present in all other religions.&lt;ref name="idea-holy"/&gt;{{rp|74}}

According to Mark Wynn in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', ''The Idea of the Holy'' falls within a paradigm in the philosophy of emotion in which emotions are seen as including an element of [[perception]] with intrinsic [[epistemology|epistemic]] value that is neither mediated by thoughts nor simply a response to [[physiology|physiological]] factors. Otto therefore understands [[religious experience]] as having mind-independent [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] content rather than being an internal response to belief in a divine reality. Otto applied this model specifically to religious experiences, which he felt were qualitatively different from other emotions.&lt;ref name="stan-encyc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Wynn |first1=Mark |title=Phenomenology of Religion |chapter=Section 2.1 Emotional feelings and encounter with God |chapterurl=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology-religion/#EmoFeeEncGod |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University |date=19 December 2016 |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later works===
In ''Mysticism East and West'', published in German in 1926, Otto compares and contrasts the views of the medieval German [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] [[Meister Eckhart]] with those of the influential [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu philosopher]] [[Adi Shankara]], the key figure of the [[Advaita Vedanta]] school.&lt;ref name="encyc-com"/&gt;

==Influence==
Otto left a broad influence on [[theology]], [[religious studies]], and [[philosophy of religion]] in the first half of the 20th century and beyond.

===Theology and spirituality===
[[Karl Barth]], an influential Protestant theologian contemporary to Otto, acknowledged Otto's influence and approved a similar conception of God as ''ganz Andere'' or ''totaliter aliter'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Webb|first=Stephen H.|authorlink=Stephen H. Webb |title=Re-figuring Theology. The Rhetoric of Karl Barth |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bF2JBCRWSdUC&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=1991 |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |location=[[Albany, New York]] |id={{ISBN|1-43842347-0}} |isbn=978-1-438-42347-0 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=bF2JBCRWSdUC&amp;&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%22Barth+did+approve+of+Rudolf+Otto's+description+of+God+as+the%22%22Wholly+Other%22%22(das+ganz+Andere+or+totaliter+aiiter)+—+a+term+upon+which+he+was+to+increasingly+depend+after+he+read+The+Idea+of+the+Holy+in+1919%22 87]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that fits into the [[apophatic theology]] tradition. Otto was also one of the very few modern theologians to whom [[C. S. Lewis]] indicates a debt, particularly to the idea of the ''numinous'' in ''[[The Problem of Pain]]''. In that book Lewis offers his own description of the numinous:

{{quote|Suppose you were told there was a tiger in the next room: you would know that you were in danger and would probably feel fear.  But if you were told "There is a ghost in the next room," and believed it, you would feel, indeed, what is often called fear, but of a different kind. It would not be based on the knowledge of danger, for no one is primarily afraid of what a ghost may do to him, but of the mere fact that it is a ghost.  It is "uncanny" rather than dangerous, and the special kind of fear it excites may be called Dread. With the Uncanny one has reached the fringes of the Numinous. Now suppose that you were told simply "There is a mighty spirit in the room," and believed it. Your feelings would then be even less like the mere fear of danger: but the disturbance would be profound. You would feel wonder and a certain shrinking—a sense of inadequacy to cope with such a visitant and of prostration before it—an emotion which might be expressed in Shakespeare's words "Under it my genius is rebuked." This feeling may be described as awe, and the object which excites it as the ''Numinous.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lewis, C.S. |author-link=C. S. Lewis |title=The Problem of Pain |url=https://books.google.com/?id=n5ONfyO5yBUC&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2009 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=FCd2myvV1oAC 1940] |location=New York City |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |isbn=978-0-007-33226-7 |id={{ISBN|0-00733226-2}} |pages=[https://books.google.com/?id=n5ONfyO5yBUC&amp;pg=PA5 5—6]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

German-American theologian [[Paul Tillich]] acknowledged Otto's influence on him,&lt;ref name="encyc-com"/&gt; as did Otto's most famous German pupil, Gustav Mensching (1901–1978) from [[Bonn University]].&lt;ref name="gooch"/&gt; Otto's views can be seen{{clarify|date=October 2016}} in the noted [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] theologian [[Karl Rahner]]'s [[Christian anthropology|presentation of man]] as a being of [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]]. More recently, Otto has also influenced the American [[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscan]] [[friar]] and inspirational speaker [[Richard Rohr]].&lt;ref name="rohr"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rohr |first1=Richard |title=Immortal Diamond: The Search for Our True Self |date=2012 |publisher=Jossey-Bass |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-1-118-42154-3 |accessdate=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|139}}

Otto's ideas have also exerted an influence on non-Christian theology and spirituality. They have been discussed by [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] theologians including [[Joseph Soloveitchik]] and [[Eliezer Berkovits]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eliezer Berkovits|Berkovits, Eliezer]], ''God, Man and History'', 2004, pp. 166, 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranian-American [[Sufi]] religious studies scholar and public intellectual [[Reza Aslan]] understands religion as "an institutionalized system of symbols and metaphors [...] with which a community of faith can share with each other their numinous encounter with the Divine Presence."&lt;ref name="aslan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aslan|first1=Reza|title=No god but God: The Origins, Evolution, And Future of Islam|date=2005|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|location=New York|isbn=1-4000-6213-6|page=xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further afield, Otto's work received words of appreciation from Indian independence leader [[Mohandas Gandhi]].&lt;ref name="gooch"/&gt; [[Aldous Huxley]], a major proponent of [[Perennial philosophy|perennialism]], was influenced by Otto; in ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' he writes:
{{quote|The literature of [[religious experience]] abounds in references to the pains and terrors overwhelming those who have come, too suddenly, face to face with some manifestation of the ''mysterium tremendum''. In theological language, this fear is due to the in-compatibility between man's egotism and the divine purity, between man's self-aggravated separateness and the infinity of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|title=The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell|year=2004|publisher=Harper Collins|pages=55|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Doors_of_Perception_and_Heaven_and_H.html?id=3t7_Df4e-6YC&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Religious studies, psychology, and philosophy===
In ''The Idea of the Holy'' and other works, Otto set out a paradigm for the [[Religious studies|study of religion]] that focused on the need to realize the religious as a non-reducible, original category in its own right. This paradigm was heavily criticized between approximately 1950 and 1990 but has seen a resurgence since then, as its phenomenological aspects have become more apparent. The eminent Romanian-American [[History of religions|historian of religion]] and philosopher [[Mircea Eliade]] used the concepts from ''The Idea of the Holy'' as the starting point for his own 1954 book, ''The Sacred and the Profane''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mircea |last=Eliade |authorlink=Mircea Eliade |title=The Sacred and the Profane.

[[Carl Gustav Jung]], the founder of [[analytic psychology]], applied the concept of the ''numinous'' to [[psychology]] and [[psychotherapy]], arguing it was therapeutic and brought greater self-understanding, and stating that to him religion was about a "careful and scrupulous observation... of the ''numinosum''".&lt;ref name="num-psych"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Agnel |first=Aimé |title=Numinous (Analytical Psychology) |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/christianity/christianity-general/numinous |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia.com]] |publisher=International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis |accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[Episcopalianism|Episcopal]] priest [[John A. Sanford]] applied the ideas of both Otto and Jung in his writings on religious psychotherapy.

The philosopher and sociologist [[Max Horkheimer]], a member of the [[Frankfurt School]], has taken the concept of "wholly other" in his 1970 book ''Die Sehnsucht nach dem ganz Anderen'' ("longing for the entirely Other").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Theodor W. |last1=Adorno |authorlink1=Theodor W.

The war veteran and writer [[Ernst Jünger]] and the historian and scientist [[Joseph Needham]] also cited his influence.

==Ecumenical activities==
Otto was heavily involved in ecumenical activities between [[Christian denominations]] and between Christianity and other religions.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; He experimented with adding a time similar to a [[Quaker]] [[moment of silence]] to the Lutheran [[liturgy]] as an opportunity for worshipers to experience the numinous.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Samue'''''|作務衣|}} is the work clothing of [[Japan]]ese [[Zen]] Buddhist monks, worn when engaged in [[samu (Zen)|samu]].

Made from [[cotton]] or [[linen]] and traditionally dyed brown or [[indigo dye|indigo]] to distinguish them from formal vestments, samue are worn by monks of most Japanese Buddhist traditions performing labour duty such as temple maintenance and field work.  

In modern times they have become popular as general casual or work wear. [[Shakuhachi]] players today, because of the instrument's historical association with Zen Buddhism, sometimes wear samue.

'''Saverius Pace''' (17th century) was a minor Maltese philosopher who specialised in physics.

==Life==
Little is known about the private life of Saverius Pace. Neither his dates of birth and death nor his birthplace in Malta are identified as yet. He might have lectured at the ''Collegium Melitense'' [[University of Malta|see]] in [[Valletta]]. Unfortunately, only one work of Pace survived.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, vol. II, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, no portrait of Pace is known to exist so far.

==Known works==
Pace’s only work which is still extant is '''''Elucidario in quatru libru Phisicoru Aristotelis''''' (''An Examination of the first four Books of Aristotle’s ‘Physics’''), written in 1649 (begun in May of that year).&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript is written in old Italian or Sicilian, and held at the [[National Library of Malta]], [[Valletta]], marked as MS. 1465. Its pages are not numbered.

The work is a detailed philosophical examination of the first four out of the eight books of Aristotle’s ''Physics''. Its division is typical of [[Scholasticism]], and hence organised in Articles and Conclusions.

A '''semantic class''' contains words that share a [[semantic feature]].  For example within nouns there are two sub classes, concrete nouns and abstract nouns. The concrete nouns include people, plants, animals, materials and objects while the abstract nouns refer to concepts such as qualities, actions, and processes. According to the nature of the noun, they are categorized into different semantic classes. Semantic classes may intersect. The intersection of ''female'' and ''young'' can be ''girl''.

{{Psychoanalysis}}
From 1952 to 1980 [[France|French]] [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] and [[psychiatrist]] [[Jacques Lacan]] gave an  annual [[seminar]] in [[Paris]]. The ''Books'' of the Seminar are edited by [[Jacques-Alain Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;The complete set of annual seminars is referred to collectively in French as the ''Séminaire'', and the practice of capitalising the "S" of Seminar has been retained in English to denote the full series and thereby distinguish the Parisian series from other ad hoc seminars. Cf. Macey, D. "Introduction" to The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1951, Lacan, then a member of the [[Paris Psychoanalytic Society]], initiated a series of weekly Wednesday meetings in his apartment on Rue de Lille, Paris. In 1952, the meetings were transferred to the [[Sainte-Anne Hospital Center|Sainte-Anne Hospital]] where Lacan worked as a consultant psychiatrist. ''Book I'' of the seminar&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Jacques. ''The Seminar Book I, Freud's Papers on Technique'', Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is the edited transcription of the 1953-1954 weekly lessons at Sainte-Anne, where the Seminar would be held until 1963.

The final seminar to be held at Sainte-Anne is published as ''Book X'' (''Anxiety'', 1962-1963). The single lesson delivered on 20 November 1963 and published as "Introduction to the Names-of-the-Father Seminar"&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Jacques. "Introduction to the Names-of-the-Father Seminar". ''Television/A Challenge to the Psychoanalytic Establishment'', pp. 81-95&lt;/ref&gt; is the introduction to a seminar that was never delivered, and which has thus been dubbed ''The Inexistent Seminar''.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Jacques-Alain "The Inexistent Seminar". ''Psychoanalytical Notebooks of the London Society'', issue 15&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the night before this lesson, Lacan had been informed that the SFP "had voted, in a complicated procedure, to refuse to ratify the motion striking Lacan's name from the list of the training analysts",&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Jacques. ''Television/A Challenge to the Psychoanalytic Establishment'', p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; thus stripping Lacan of the right to continue as a training analyst within the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]]. This institutional manoeuvre effectively brought to a close the early period of Lacan's teaching.&lt;!-- Note: text of quote above actually implies that Lacan was NOT stripped, because the motion to strip him was not ratified... --&gt;

The middle period of Lacan's teaching began two months later with ''[[The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis]]''. Hosted by the [[École Normale Supérieure]], under the patronage of the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences]], the Seminar now enjoyed "a much larger audience" and represented a "change of front".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Jacques. "Report on the 1964 Seminar". [[Hurly-Burly (journal)|''Hurly-Burly'']] '''5''', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; This series of lessons, now edited as ''Book XI'' of the Seminar, opens with the lesson "Excommunication" in which Lacan expands on the circumstances and implications of his exclusion from the IPA. The second lesson, "The Freudian Unconscious and Ours" sets the tone of his ensuing teaching by indicating potential points of discontinuity with respect to [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s oeuvre.

Lacan's yearly Seminar continued at the École normale supérieure until 1969. From autumn 1969 onwards, it was hosted by the [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University|Law Faculty]] at [[Place du Panthéon]].&lt;ref&gt;Grigg, Russell. "Translator's Note" to The Seminar Book XVII, ''The Other Side of Psychoanalysis'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; This series of seminars, the late period of Lacan's teaching, opened with ''The Other Side of Psychoanalysis'', now edited as ''Book XVII'' of the Seminar, and continued until the late seventies.

As Lacan's teaching moved into the phase known as the ''very late teaching of Lacan'', his declining health led to less regular appointments. Lacan's final public delivery on 12 July 1980, sometimes referred to as "The Caracas Seminar"&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Jacques. "Overture to the First International Encounter of the Freudian Field". ''Hurly-Burly'' '''6''' 17-20.&lt;/ref&gt; was not, as this title indicates, part of the Parisian series.

== Transcription ==
From the very first seminar at Sainte-Anne, the weekly sessions were recorded by a [[shorthand]] typist. For two decades, copies of these typescripts were the only available record of Lacan's oral teaching, Lacan himself having declined the various offers extended to him to have the typescripts edited into publishable volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Jacques-Alain, ''Entretien sur "Le séminaire" avec François Ansermet'', Navarin, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early seventies, Jacques-Alain Miller offered some indications as to what would constitute an effective editorial strategy and at Lacan's invitation drew up a transcription of the twenty lessons that made up the eleventh seminar, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis'' delivered in 1964. The result pleased Lacan, and [[François Wahl]] at Éditions du Seuil was happy to publish.

Seminar XI was published in 1973. In his "Postface", Lacan writes: "A transcription, now here is a word I am discovering thanks to the modesty of J. A. M., Jacques-Alain Miller by name: what gets read passes through the writing whilst surviving there intact".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Jacques "Postface to Seminar XI" ''Hurly-Burly'' '''7''' (2012) p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan had said to Miller, "we will sign it together", but Miller had preferred to opt for a more discreet "Text established by…", a nod to the editing credits to the Greek and Latin texts in the [[Collection Budé]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Jacques-Alain, ''Vie de Lacan'', (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Lacan and Wahl were keen for more seminars to be published and Lacan entrusted the task to Miller.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Jacques-Alain "Le démon de Lacan". ''Le diable probablement'' '''9''' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Four more books of the Seminar were published during Lacan's lifetime. The first to be translated into English was ''Book XI'', published by [[Hogarth Press]] in 1977 with a specially written preface. To date (2015), seventeen of the seminars have been published in French, several of which have also appeared in English translation. The remaining seminars have all been established by Miller and are currently awaiting publication. As of 2013, the Books of the Seminar will be published by Éditions de la Martinière.
