An '''antefix''' (from [[Latin]] ''antefigere'', to fasten before) is a vertical block which terminates the [[Tile#Roof tiles|covering tiles]] of a tiled roof. In grand buildings the face of each stone ante-fix was richly carved, often with the [[Palmette|anthemion]] ornament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Ante-fixae|volume=2|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; In less grand buildings moulded ceramic ante-fixes, usually [[terracotta]], might be decorated with figures or other ornament, especially in the Roman period. By this time they were found on many large buildings, including private houses.

==Etymology==
From Latin ''antefixa'', pl. of ''antefixum'', something fastened in front, from ''antefixus'', fastened in front: ''ante-'', ''ante-'' and ''fixus'', fastened, past participle of ''figere'', to ''fasten''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/antefix|title=antefix|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15353">'''Arnold Berleant''' (born 4 March 1932&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001/acref-9780199754663-e-090|title=Berleant, Arnold Jerome - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001/acref-9780199754663-e-090|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American scholar and author who is active both in philosophy and music.
[[File:AB Portrait.jpg|thumb|Arnold Berleant]]
Arnold Berleant was born in Buffalo, New York&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  He received his advanced musical education at the Eastman School of Music and his doctorate in philosophy at the State University of New York at Buffalo.  He is Professor of Philosophy (Emeritus) at Long Island University, former Secretary-General and Past President of the International Association of Aesthetics, and former Secretary-Treasurer of the American Society for Aesthetics.  His books and articles in philosophy focus on aesthetics, environmental aesthetics, and ethics.  Arnold Berleant is the founding editor of ''Contemporary Aesthetics'', an international on-line journal of contemporary aesthetic theory, research, and application.

==Life and work==

As a philosopher Berleant has written on important aspects of both aesthetic theory and the arts.  These include ontological and metaphysical issues, basic theoretical questions such as appreciation and aesthetic experience, and explorations of music, architecture, painting and literature.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Renee Conroy, “Berleant Review,” (Philadelphia, PA:  American Society for Aesthetics, Eastern Division, April 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  His first book, ''The Aesthetic Field:  A Phenomenology of Aesthetic Experience'' (1970), established the concept of the aesthetic field as a contextual framework within which questions in aesthetics and the arts can be most fully illuminated.  Much of his subsequent work has focused on environmental aesthetics, attending both to general issues and to specific kinds of environment.  The aesthetics of environment is a theme that he has elaborated and extended in much of his writing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Cheng Xiangzhan, “Environmental Aesthetics and Ecological Aesthetics:  Arnold Berleant’s Impact on Ecological Aesthetics in China,” Sztuka i Filozofia-Special Issue (forthcoming).&lt;/ref&gt;  ''In Art and Engagement'' (1991), Berleant exemplified the usefulness of the concept of the aesthetic field by applying it to a range of arts – landscape painting, architecture and environmental design, literature, music, dance, and film.&lt;ref&gt;American Society for Aesthetics, Summer 1991.  p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging from these original studies was the recognition that the different arts evoke experiences with their own claims to reality.  Moreover, these experiences exhibit an intense, active perceptual involvement that he calls “aesthetic engagement,” which belies the traditional claim of aesthetic disinterestedness.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The innovative concept of engagement leads to new perspectives on a variety of traditional esthetic topics, including metaphorical language, urban design, music, and metaphysics, and opens less traditional topics, such as virtual reality and social interaction to aesthetic analysis.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt;
The body of Berleant’s work challenges the traditional view of philosophical aesthetics, which posits “disinterestedness” as foundational in aesthetic experience.  Berleant draws upon both phenomenology and pragmatism for an opposing theory of aesthetic perception based on the notion of engagement.&lt;ref&gt;M. Feder-Marcus, Choice (American Library Association,  December, 1991), p. 255)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC)''' is an organization comprising universities located in North America that offer graduate programs in the field of art [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]]. Each association member's primary mission is to provide education and training in conservation through the awarding of an accredited degree. Since 1974, the conservation graduate programs have held an annual meeting at one of the member programs in order to give current students the opportunity to present current research to their peers.

==History==
[[File:Corning Museum of Glass.jpg|thumb|left|The Corning Museum of Glass, site of the first conference held by the North American graduate programs in conservation]]The first conference of North American graduate programs in the conservation of art and other cultural property was held in 1974 at the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] in response to a flood that damaged the museum's artifact and library collection on June 23, 1972. While only three percent of the museum's glass collection sustained damage, over half of the museum's library holdings were lost or severely devastated.&lt;ref name="ANAGPIC book"&gt;{{cite book|author=Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC)|title=North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property, Histories &amp; Alumni|date=2000|publisher=ANAGPIC|location=Buffalo, NY|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/anagpic/histalum_full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This five-day conference entitled, "Conservation Seminar on Glass and Library Materials," was organized by Dr. [[Robert H. Brill]], the Corning Museum's research scientist. For the first time, this conference brought together students, faculty, conservators, curators, and other museum specialists for several days of lectures and discussions on the field of conservation. Five American programs and a contingent from the Canadian Conservation Institute were in attendance; [[State University of New York at Oneonta|Cooperstown Graduate Program]], [[Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library|Winterthur]]/[[University of Delaware]], [[Intermuseum Conservation Association]], [[New York University]], [[Canadian Conservation Institute]], and the [[Fogg Art Museum]]. Since the Corning Museum conference, annual meetings have become an integral part of ANAGPIC as a way to provide insight into the quality of the education provided by each program represented. Notable conservation professionals also present lectures during the conferences that address a specific area of interest in conservation, such as "Extreme Conservation" at the 2014 ANAGPIC conference. These lectures provide students with powerful insight on important issues for their future careers.&lt;ref name="ANAGPIC book"/&gt;

The Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC) was founded in May, 1984 by the following organizations: Buffalo State College, State University of New York, Art Conservation Department; Harvard University Art Museums, Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies; New York University, Conservation Center, Institute of Fine Arts; Queen’s University, Art Conservation Program; Winterthur/University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation; The University of Texas at Austin, School of Information, Kilgarlin Center for Preservation of the Cultural Record.&lt;ref name="ANAGPIC Bylaws"&gt;{{cite web|author=Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC)|title=ANAGPIC Bylaws|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/anagpic/bylaws.htm|publisher=Conservation OnLine (CoOL)|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

The general purpose of the Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC) is to “help serve the need of the conservation field for well-trained professional conservators by aiding its member training programs to attain their educational objectives.”&lt;ref name="ANAGPIC Bylaws"/&gt;

In order for organizations to be eligible for membership, they must have provided conservation training for at least three consecutive years, and they must award a diploma, degree, or certificate formally acknowledged by their parent academic association. Within that parent institution, the member organization must be a distinct program, whose primary mission is conservation education and training. The program's curriculum must have substantial components of problem-solving in conservation and conservation science, and should conform to the AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice. The student to faculty ratio must also be no greater than ten students per faculty member, and these faculty members must have professional qualifications to teach conservation at a graduate level. This can be demonstrated through substantial professional recognition through the [[International Institute for Conservation]] of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC), the [[American Institute for Conservation]] of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC), or the Canadian Association of Professional Conservators (CAPC).&lt;ref name="ANAGPIC Bylaws"/&gt;

At least one meeting of the ANAGPIC is held annually, normally concurrent with the annual Conference of the Conservation Training Programs, at present held in late spring. Typically, each institution is represented by two student presenters. Other meetings can be called as necessary if agreed to by at least two-thirds of the membership. Each member organization is normally represented by the training program director/chairperson.&lt;ref name="ANAGPIC Bylaws"/&gt;

==Current members==

===Buffalo State College, SUNY, Art Conservation Department===
[[File:Rockwell hall.JPG|thumb|right|Rockwell Hall at Buffalo State College, where graduate courses in art conservation are held.]] Buffalo State College's Art Conservation Department was founded in 1970 as the Cooperstown Graduate Program in the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, affiliated with the State University of New York College at Oneonta and with the New York State Historical Association in Cooperstown. In 1983, the program transferred to Buffalo State College, and then relocated to its campus in 1987. Since its founding, Buffalo State offers a master of arts degree and certificate of advanced study in art conservation upon the completion of a three-year graduate program which trains conservators of fine art and material cultural heritage. This program accepts only 10 students per academic year. [[Buffalo State College|Buffalo State]] is the largest four-year college of arts and sciences in the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History - Art Conservation - Buffalo State |url=http://artconservation.buffalostate.edu/history |publisher=Buffalo State College |accessdate=21 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430053003/http://artconservation.buffalostate.edu/history |archivedate=30 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Buffalo State's campus also hosts the [[Burchfield Penney Art Center]] and located across the street from the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]].

===Harvard University Art Museums, Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies===

&lt;big&gt;'''Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;

The Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies provides analysis and treatments for the [[Harvard Art Museums]]’ collection, consisting of more than 250,000 objects in all media, ranging in date from [[classic antiquity|antiquity]] to the present. The Department of Technical Studies became the first institution in the United States to use scientific methods to study artists’ materials and techniques when it was founded in 1928 by Edward W. Forbes, director of Harvard University’s [[Fogg Museum]]. In 1994, the center was renamed the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies in honor of Philip A. and Lynn Straus, who were longtime benefactors of the Harvard Art Museums. In 1972, with the support from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the Straus Center began their Advanced-Level Training Program which provides formal hands-on training in the conservation of works on paper, paintings, and objects and sculpture, as well as in conservation science. They offer three 10-month fellowships each year in which fellows can refine their practical and analytical skills through the examination and treatment of works of art from the Harvard Art Museums' collections. Fellows also have the chance to publish their original research.&lt;ref name=Straus&gt;{{cite web|title=Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies|url=http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/study-research/straus|publisher=Harvard Art Museums|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York University, Conservation Center, Institute of Fine Arts===

The Conservation Center of the [[Institute of Fine Arts]] at [[New York University]] (NYU) was founded in 1960 with support from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. Since that time, the program has called for equal measures of art historical study, scientific training, and practical conservation experience. The goal was to produce a professional who would approach each object as an individual entity. The solution to an object's condition issues would be determined through research and study, unlike the tradesman restorer’s approach, which applied standard treatments to objects and problems.&lt;ref name="NYU History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Center|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/conservation/history.htm|publisher=Institute of Fine Arts, New York University|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other conservation graduate programs, NYU awards a four-year, dual-degree graduate program where students earn both their Master’s in art history and Advanced Certificate in conservation. The Conservation Center is also the oldest degree-granting conservation program in North America.

&lt;big&gt;'''Program Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''Art History, M.A. with Advanced Certificate in Conservation'''

*''First Year'' - Students gain an understanding of materials and technology, with a heavy emphasis on direct observation. No treatment is carried out during the first year, apart from simple treatment methodologies carried out in ''Principles of Conservation''. Students must also successfully pass a language translation exam within their first year of study, in the language of their choosing - French, German or Italian.
*''Second Year'' - Students complete core classes and begin training in their specialized area of study at the Conservation Center, as well as museums and private laboratories in NYC. Students also have the ability to pursue independent research projects in areas of particular interest to them.
*''Third Year'' - Students continue upper-level conservation treatment coursework in their area of concentration and complete any remaining requirements for the MA degree in art history, including the completion of the Master’s Thesis.
*''Fourth Year'' - Students complete a nine-month internship in their area of specialization at an established conservation institution. Students can complete this internship in the United States or abroad.

The '''Bedkhem Church''' (Other names: '''Bedghehem church''' or '''Beyt Lahm church''' or '''Bethlehem church''') is an [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] church in the [[New Julfa|Julfa]] quarter in [[Isfahan]], Iran. One of the most important historical churches of the city, it belongs to the [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] era. The church is located in the Julfa square near [[St. Mary Church, Isfahan|Saint Mary Church]]. The Bedkhem church was built by an [[Armenians|Armenian]] merchant named Khaje Petros. There are decorations and paintings on its walls depicting the life of Jesus. The 72 exquisite paintings, painted by Armenian artists, are presented in two rows. In the lower row the paintings are painted sequentially, but in the upper row each painting is in a separate frame.&lt;ref name="Rāhnamā 2004, p. 128"&gt;'{{cite book|title=Rāhnamā ye Safar be Ostān e Esfāhān(Travel Guide for the Province Isfahan)|publisher=Rouzane|isbn=964-334-218-2|author=Hosseyn Yaghoubi|editor=Arash Beheshti|page=128|language=Persian|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture and the gilded decorations of the church's [[dome]] are notable. Inside the church there are [[inscription]]s in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] which date back to 1627 and 1711. The inscriptions are installed in remembrance of those who performed charitable work for the church.&lt;ref name="Rāhnamā 2004, p. 128"/&gt;

On the southern [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] there is an inscription as follows:
:::''Pray for Khaje Petros, who was a good man, in the presence of God. He built this church by his own personal expenditure for the immortality of his name and his father's name (Vali Jan) and his mother's name (Shoushan) and his family's name in 1077'' (in the [[Armenian calendar]] which is 1627 in the [[Gregorian calendar]]).&lt;ref name="Rāhnamā 2004, p. 128"/&gt;

The church has three parts:&lt;ref name="Rāhnamā 2004, p. 128"/&gt; 
*The entrance with a [[balcony]], which seems to have been a special place for engaged girls.
*The chapel, above which is the [[dome]].
*The [[apse]]

The church has a [[rectangular]] [[plan (drawing)|plan]]. The doors are 31 m long and 14 m high. Its [[dome]] is 26 in height. Opposite the church, there is a [[courtyard]] with two entrances.&lt;ref name="Rāhnamā 2004, p. 128"/&gt;

'''Bird-and-flower painting''' (in [[chinese language|chinese]] 花鸟画) is a kind of [[Chinese painting]] named after its subject matter. Normally, most bird-and-flower paintings belong to the scholar-artist style of Chinese painting.

== History ==
[[File:Autumn flowers and white pheasants 秋花白鷴图.jpg|thumb|left|Bird-and-flower painting by [[Cai Han]] and Jin Xiaozhu, ''c''. 17th century.]]
According to Chinese tradition, bird-and-flower painting covers "flowers, birds, fish, and insects" (Traditional Chinese: 花鳥魚蟲, Simplified Chinese: 花鸟鱼虫 ''huā, niǎo, yú, chóng''). It can thus deal with a wide range of natural topics, including flowers (plants), fish, insects, birds, pets (dogs, cats) etc.

The ''huaniao hua'' (花鳥畫) or "bird-and-flower painting" is proper of 10th century China. The most representative artists are [[Huang Quan (painter)|Huang Quan]] 哳㥳 (c. 900&amp;nbsp;– 965) and [[Xu Xi (painter)|Xu Xi]] 徐熙 (937–975). They are the masters of two schools: the first school was led by Huang Quan (imperial painter). It is characterised by an "outline" method of brush work, with emphasis on bright colours filling a meticulously outline (''gongbi''). The other school was led by Xu Xi (never entered into officialdom) and typically used techniques associated with ink-and-wash painting.&lt;ref&gt;Marco, Meccarelli. 2015.  [https://www.academia.edu/20410225/Chinese_Painters_in_Nagasaki_Style_and_Artistic_Contaminatio_during_the_Tokugawa_Period_1603-1868_ "Chinese Painters in Nagasaki: Style and Artistic Contaminatio during the Tokugawa Period (1603–1868)"] Ming Qing Studies 2015, Pages 175–236.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kingfisher-iris.jpg|thumb|upright|''Kingfisher and iris'' ''kachō-e'' woodblock print by Ohara Koson (late 19th century)]]
The bird-and-flower motif started appearing in [[Japanese art]] around the [[Muromachi period]] of the 14th century, and developed its own distinct style. It also entered ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' woodblock printing, where it was known as ''kachō-e'' (花鳥絵). Especially the ''[[shin hanga]]'' movement produced a number of works with this motif starting in the [[Meiji era]]. Artists working with this were [[Ohara Koson]] (1877–1945) and [[Ito Sozan]] (1884–?), as well as [[Imao Keinen]] (1845–1924).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hanga.com/genre/kacho-e/|title=hanga gallery . . . torii gallery: Bird and Flower Prints|website=www.hanga.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3093764&amp;partId=1|title=Keinen kacho gafu 景年花鳥画譜 (Album of Bird-and-Flower Pictures by Keinen)|website=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1855, the '''Amateur Dramatic Club''' (or ADC) is the oldest university dramatic society in [[England]] – and the largest dramatic society in [[Cambridge]].

The club stages a diverse range of productions every term, many of them at the fully equipped [[ADC Theatre]] in Park Street, where they are the resident company. They also regularly stage shows at other Cambridge venues, annually at the Edinburgh Fringe and occasionally on tour abroad.

==History==

The Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club was officially founded during the Easter Vacation of 1855 by [[F. C. Burnand|F.C. Burnand]] and a group of his friends, who had acquired back rooms in the Hoop Hotel on Jesus Lane during the course of the previous year.
The university’s response to the project was reported to have been ‘unfavourable’, but this did nothing to dampen the enthusiasm of those involved.
The club’s first presentation was a series of short one act plays of varying quality, of which the club’s first minute book reports that ‘the receipts were scanty, but a start was effected’.

Over the course of the next five years, the society grew slowly but steadily.
A contribution of £5 from each of the club’s members allowed the club to pay for the renovation of their cramped and bare rooms, and in 1860 the new stage at the Hoop Hotel, roughly on the site of the current building, was opened.

Though the university’s approval was initially begrudging, attitudes towards the club changed over the course of the next 40 years, and by the beginning of the 20th century the club was a nationally renowned and respected group.
Tragedy struck in 1933 when the Hoop Hotel stage was destroyed in a fire.
Support flooded in, including messages of goodwill from the King, and a mere 18 months later a new building was opened by the club.
The [[ADC Theatre]], now the oldest university playhouse in the country, was reborn.

The club continued to run the theatre until it ran into financial difficulties in 1974 when the university took over the running of the theatre, as a department of the university leasing the building from the club for a nominal annual fee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adctheatre.com/potted.asp A Potted History of the ADC Theatre]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The CUADC puts on around 20 shows every year. These cover a huge range of subject matter and playwrights, from comic to tragic, from Chaucer to Stoppard via Shakespeare and Beckett to name just a few. Although many are performed at the 228-seater [[ADC Theatre]], where the club is the resident performing company, recent venues have also included the [[Corpus Christi Playroom]], The Octagon at St Chad’s, King's College Lawn and the [[The Holy Sepulchre, Cambridge|Round Church]].

Constitutionally, the club also has an obligation
&lt;blockquote&gt;to spread interest in the theory and practice of theatre, in all its aspects, by every possible means amongst those qualified to be members of the Club; to encourage the active involvement of the same regardless of previous experience; and to maintain interest in the running of the ADC Theatre.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To this end, the club puts on a programme of professional and student-run workshops for actors, directors and technicians as well as a series of late-night experimental pieces known as One Night Stands.

==Membership==
Anybody aged 17 or over, studying for a qualification at the [[University of Cambridge]], or who is engaged in full-time study at any other educational institution within Cambridge is eligible for ordinary membership.&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;[http://cuadc.org/about-us/constitution/ CUADC Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;
From time to time special membership may be conferred onto people who do not otherwise qualify for ordinary membership.
It is a requirement that anybody participating in a show put on by the club must have some class of membership status for insurance reasons.

==Committee==
The club is run on behalf of its members by a committee of fourteen students of the university.
The President usually must have been a member of the committee the previous year and is elected by that committee, all other roles are elected by club members at the AGM, held in Lent Term.
The committee is in charge of show selection and support, as well as organisation of one-off events such as the annual [[garden party]], annual dinner, and freshers' squash.&lt;ref name="constitution"/&gt;

There is also a senior treasurer, who, by university statutes, must be a senior member of the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/so/2008/chapter02-section17.html#heading2-19 Statutes and Ordinances of the University of Cambridge: Chapter Ii :  Matriculation, Residence, Admission to Degrees, Discipline  –  Discipline]&lt;/ref&gt; This post is currently held by Dr Richard Barnes, the vice-master of Emmanuel College and senior treasurer of Amalgamated Clubs.

'''''Carousel''''' is an [[internet marketing|online advertisement]] launched in April 2009 by [[Philips]] to promote [[Philips Cinema 21:9 TV|Philips Cinema 21:9]] [[LCD television]]s. The 139-second (2m19s) piece is a continuous tracking shot of a frozen moment after an [[Armored car (valuables)|armoured van]] heist gone wrong, with robbers dressed in clown masks holding a pitched battle with police officers inside a hospital. The campaign surrounding ''Carousel'' was led by the central Philips team at DDB in London and produced by  [[advertising agency]] [[Tribal DDB]] in [[Amsterdam]]. It was directed by [[Adam Berg (director)|Adam Berg]], with production contracted to [[London]]-based [[production company]] [[Stinkdigital]]. The ad went on to become a huge critical success, winning the advertising industry's most prestigious award: the Grand Prix at the [[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival]]. It is only the second online advertisement to win in the Film category, after [[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]]'s ''[[Evolution (advertisement)|Evolution]]'' in 2007. Scenes from ''Carousel'' were used in the [[music video]] for [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artist [[50 Cent]]'s [[single (music)|single]] "[[Ok, You're Right]]".

==Sequence==
After a credit sequence, ''Carousel'' opens on a police officer kneeling on a parked [[police car]]. The camera pans across and travels past an armoured van in mid-explosion. It continues to the entrance of a hospital, where two officers are engaged in a firefight with a criminal in a clown mask, while a further two are dragging a clown out of a [[station wagon]]. The camera passes into the hospital to a reception desk, where a clown is kicking an officer through a glass window while others come up behind him. The camera rotates upwards to reveal another clown/officer pair in midair after falling from a balcony above. The camera travels up to the second floor, through an explosion into a corridor filled with clowns and officers, with several civilians cowering against the floor. Passing a ward where more figures are shooting at each other, the camera reaches a clown carrying a sack of cash who has just been shot in the back, before panning right to reveal a team of officers around a man stripped to his underwear. The camera exits the window and returns to ground level, to the pointing officer on the car (revealed to be [[Philips Cinema 21:9 TV|number 219]]) at the start. It scrolls past the officer, who hides a clown mask and a sack of cash, revealing that he is in fact one of the criminals. The piece then begins a fresh loop from the beginning.

===Background and filming===
In January 2009, Philips announced its new [[Philips Cinema 21:9 TV|Philips Cinema 21:9]] line of [[LCD television]]s, promoting them as being the first production television whose proportions matched that of a [[Movie theater|cinema]] screen.&lt;ref&gt;"Philips premieres the ultimate home cinematic viewing experience with the Cinema 21:9 LCD TV", [[Philips]] ([[Press release]]), January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; To inform consumers about the product's features, Philips collaborated with their central agency team at DDB in London and [[advertising agency]] [[Tribal DDB]] in [[Amsterdam]] with a request to create an [[advertising campaign]] based around an educational website&lt;ref name="Boards3"&gt;Clarke, Christine; "[http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/magazine/20090601/adamberg.html Nobody Move] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916011605/http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/magazine/20090601/adamberg.html |date=September 16, 2011 }}", ''[[Boards (magazine)|Boards]]'', June 1, 2009.

At certain points during ''Carousel'', viewers can elect to switch to watching one of three short films blended into the tracking shot.&lt;ref name="Redrum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cannes"/&gt; When one of the films is selected, the effects which were added in post-production disappear, and the rigging used in production reappears. An actor portraying a member of the cast comes on to discuss an element of the filming or a feature of the product.&lt;ref name="Boards3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cannes"/&gt; In the first, the director of photography discusses the lighting techniques used in ''Carousel''. In the second, the director discusses the cinematic 21:9 aspect ratio and interacts with one of the extras. In the third, the VFX supervisor expands on the post-production process, and through a fake video-editing interface alters various aspects of the scene. The scripts for these short commentaries were written by Tribal DDB, with input from Stinkdigital and Redrum.&lt;ref name="Boards3"/&gt;

The [[soundtrack]] to ''Carousel'' was composed by [[Michael Fakesch]]. The music was altered for the Philips microsite by Stinkdigital so that, if users chose to move through the film at a different rate or in a different direction, the music would distort to match.&lt;ref name="Cannes"/&gt; Other features of the microsite included an [[Ambilight]] feature and the ability to switch at will between 21:9 and 16:9 aspect ratios.

Every [[sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] had his own [[monogram]], called the ''[[tughra]]'', which served as a royal symbol. A coat of arms in the European heraldic sense was created in the late 19th century. [[Hampton Court]] requested from the Ottoman Empire the coat of arms to be included in their collection. As the coat of arms had not been previously used in the Ottoman Empire, it was designed after this request, and the final design was adopted by Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] on 17 April 1882.

It included two flags: the red flag of the [[Ottoman dynasty]] with a [[star and crescent]], and the [[green in Islam#Muslim flags|green flag]] of the Islamic [[caliph]], largely obscured by a [[cornucopia]].

Behind the flags are a number of spears and other weapons.

Hanging beneath the lower flourish are the medals of five of the [[:Category:Military awards and decorations of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman decorations]], the depiction of which vary greatly between sources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3270">'''EU Talent Day''' is an observance of the [[European Union]] on [[Béla Bartók]]'s birthday who was a well-known composer in and outside of [[Europe]].

== History ==

The first European TalentDay was held on April 9, 2011. This coincided with the Hungarian [[EU Presidency|EU Presidential Conference]] on Talent Support, held in [[Budapest]] on April 7–9, 2011. Conference delegates proposed March 25, birthday of Béla Bartók, as EU TalentDay. This event,&lt;ref&gt;Hungarian EU Presidential Conference on Talent Support ; [BUDAPEST DECLARATION ON TALENT SUPPORT http://talentday.eu/content/budapest-declaration-talent-support] (April 9, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; written on the first EU TalentDay, includes the following points about the purpose of [[aptitude|talent]] development in the [[European Union]] and of EU TalentDay:

*Talent development has beneficial effects on the economies of individual nations, and of the European Union as a whole. 
*Talent support programmes may boost the self-esteem and social success of talented people.
*Talent support is becoming important in the social-economic progress of underprivileged people groups.
*Effective networking of groups facilitating talent development, as is now happening in Hungary, will be even more beneficial once extended across Europe.
*EU TalentDay can help to focus the attention of stakeholders and the European general public, and seeks recognition of talents support benefits and of best practices by the [[European Commission]], the [[European Council]] and the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;The final Written Declaration on the importance of talent support http://www.talentcentrebudapest.eu/content/wd-342012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eastern Group of Painters''' was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Artist collective|artists collective]] founded in 1938 in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. The group included Montreal artists whose common interest was painting and an [[art for art's sake]] aesthetic, not the espousal of a nationalist theory as was the case with the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] or the [[Canadian Group of Painters]]. The group’s members included [[Alexander Bercovitch]], [[Goodridge Roberts]], [[Eric Goldberg (artist)|Eric Goldberg]], [[Jack Humphrey|Jack Weldon Humphrey]], [[John Goodwin Lyman]], and [[Jori Smith]]. Goldberg and Lyman were both well represented by [[Max Stern (gallery owner)|Max Stern]]'s Dominion Gallery in Montreal.

By the late 1930s, many Canadian artists began resenting the quasi-national institution the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] had become. As a result of a growing rejection of the view that the efforts of a group of artists based largely in [[Ontario]] constituted a national vision or oeuvre, many artists - notably those in [[Quebec]] - began feeling ignored and undermined. The Eastern Group of Painters formed to counter this notion and restore variation of purpose, method, and geography to [[Art in Canada|Canadian art]].

[[John Goodwin Lyman|John Lyman]]'s [[Contemporary Arts Society]] (1939–48) (in French, ''Société d'art contemporain'') evolved out of the Eastern Group of Painters.

==Story==
At 34 years old, Elizabeth Gilbert was educated, had a home, a husband, and a successful career as a writer. She was, however, unhappy in her marriage and initiated a divorce. She then embarked on a rebound relationship that did not work out, leaving her devastated and alone. After finalizing her difficult divorce, she spent the next year traveling the world.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/books/review/26egan.html |title=Eat, Pray, Love |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |last=Egan |first=Jennifer |date=February 26, 2006 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She spent four months in Italy, eating and enjoying life ("Eat"). She spent three months in India, finding her [[spirituality]] ("Pray").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/view_one_review/2261|title=''Eat, Pray, Love'' (review)|author=|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=2011-10-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207001706/http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/view_one_review/2261|archivedate=December 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She ended the year in [[Bali, Indonesia]], looking for "balance" of the two and fell in love with a Brazilian businessman ("Love").&lt;ref name="WPost"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/09/AR2006020901684.html |title=Heart and Soul |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |last=Lichtenstein |first=Grace |date=February 12, 2006 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
Jennifer Egan of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Gilbert's prose as "fueled by a mix of intelligence, wit and colloquial exuberance that is close to irresistible", but said that the book "drags" in the middle. She was more interested in "the awkward, unresolved stuff she must have chosen to leave out", noting that Gilbert omits the "confusion and unfinished business of real life", and that "we know how the story ends pretty much from the beginning."&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

[[Oprah Winfrey]] enjoyed the book, and devoted two episodes of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' to it.&lt;ref name="NYPost"/&gt;

Maureen Callahan of the ''[[New York Post]]'' heavily criticized the book, calling it "[[narcissistic]] [[New Age]] reading", and "the worst in [[Orientalism|Western fetishization]] of Eastern thought and culture, assured in its answers to existential dilemmas that have confounded intellects greater than hers." In addition, she was critical of Oprah's focus on the book, as well as Oprah's fans who enjoy the book, asking why her fans are "indulging in this silliness", and why they aren't "clamoring for more weight when it comes to Oprah's female authors".&lt;ref name="NYPost"/&gt;

[[Katie Roiphe]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' agreed with Egan about the strength of Gilbert's writing. However, she described the journey as too fake: "too willed, too self-conscious". She stated that given the apparent artificiality of the journey, her "affection for ''Eat, Pray, Love'' is ... furtive", but that "it is a transcendently great beach book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2007/07/summer_reading.html |title=Summer Reading: Should you read the best-selling memoir Eat, Pray, Love? |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |last=Roiphe |first=Katie |date=July 3, 2007 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'''s Grace Lichtenstein stated that "The only thing wrong with this readable, funny memoir of a magazine writer's yearlong travels across the world in search of pleasure and balance is that it seems so much like a Jennifer Aniston movie."&lt;ref name="WPost"/&gt;

Lev Grossman of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', however, praised the spiritual aspect of the book, stating that "To read about her struggles with a 182-verse Sanskrit chant, or her (successful) attempt to meditate while being feasted on by mosquitoes, is to come about as close as you can to enlightenment-by-proxy." He did, however, agree with Roiphe that her writing occasionally seems to be "trying too hard to be liked; one feels the belabored mechanism of her jokes".&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1161222,00.html |title=The Year of Living Happily |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |last=Grossman |first=Lev |date=February 19, 2006 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lori Leibovich of [[Salon (website)|Salon]] agreed with several other reviewers about the strength of Gilbert's story telling. She agreed with Egan as well that Gilbert seems to have an unlimited amount of luck, saying "her good fortune seems limitless", and asking "Is it possible for one person to be this lucky?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/books/review/2006/02/23/gilbert |title=Lost and found |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |last=Leibovich |first=Lori |publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s Jessica Shaw said that "Despite a few cringe-worthy turns ... Gilbert's journey is well worth taking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1160265,00.html |title=Eat, Pray, Love |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |last=Shaw |first=Jessica |date=February 17, 2006 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Don Lattin of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' agreed with Egan that the story was weakest while she was in India, and questioned the complete veracity of the book.&lt;ref name="SFGate.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/reviews/books/EAT,_PRAY,_LOVE.DTL |title=Pilgrim wants it all in Italy, India, Indonesia |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |last=Lattin |first=Don |date=February 19, 2006 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Fisher of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' also praised Gilbert's writing, stating that "she describes with intense visual, palpable detail. She is the epic poet of ecstasy."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2006/02/19/short_takes_boston_globe |title=Eat, Pray, Love |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |last=Fisher |first=Barbara |date=February 19, 2006 |work=[[The Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2010, the feminist magazine ''[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]'' published a critical review and social commentary called "Eat, Pray, Spend". Authors Joshunda Sanders and Diana Barnes-Brown wrote that "''Eat, Pray, Love'' is not the first book of its kind, but it is a perfect example of the genre of priv-lit: literature or media whose expressed goal is one of spiritual, [[existential]], or philosophical enlightenment contingent upon women's hard work, commitment, and patience, but whose actual barriers to entry are primarily financial." The genre, they argued, positions women as inherently and deeply flawed, and offers "no real solutions for the astronomically high tariffs—both financial and social—that exclude all but the most fortunate among us from participating."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitchmagazine.org/article/eat-pray-spend "Eat, Pray, Spend"]. ''BitchMagazine.com''. Retrieved June 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parody==

[[Andrew Gottlieb]], an American comedy writer and producer, wrote a parody of Gilbert's Book, titled ''Drink, Play, Fuck: One Man's Search for Anything Across Ireland, Vegas and Thailand''. Gottlieb, in a 2010 interview with ''[[The New Yorker]]'', said, "I was mystified by the success of ''Eat, Pray, Love,'' and I felt that the book, and its Oprah-sanctioned ubiquity, needed to be made fun of."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2010/08/the-exchange-andrew-gottlieb.html "The Exchange: Andrew Gottlibe"].

'''Feria Maestros del Arte''' (English – Masters of Art Fair) is a non profit organization and annual three-day event held to support [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art]] in [[Chapala, Jalisco|Chapala]], [[Jalisco]], Mexico. Unlike other fairs of this type, invited participants are not charged booth fees or percentages, and are even afforded transport and accommodations with area families. The Feria has grown from thirteen artisan participants to over eighty, and the organization is legally recognized in Mexico and the United States.

==The organization==
The Feria Maestros del Arte is an annual event and non-profit organization dedicated to Mexican handcrafts and folk art.&lt;ref name=feriapage&gt;{{cite web |title= Mission, Vision, Values &amp; History |publisher=Feria Maestros del Arte |url= http://www.mexicoartshow.com/maestrosinfo.html |accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an organization, it is a recognized in both Mexico and the United States.&lt;ref name=llenaran&gt;{{cite news  |title= Llenarán de artesanía a Chapala |newspaper=Mural |location=Guadalajara |date=November 14, 2015  |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus is to support the continuing existence of Mexican folk art, which is disappearing in many places due to migration and industrialization.&lt;ref name=feriapage/&gt; Volunteers work to find artisans, raise funds,  set up and take down and all operations during the event.&lt;ref name=mexconnect&gt;{{cite web |author=Erin Cassin |title= Chapala's Feria Maestros del Arte: guardians of the folk art tradition |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |date=October 1, 2008|url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3005-chapala-s-feria-maestros-del-arte-guardians-of-the-folk-art-tradition |accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The event==
[[File:2015Feria022.JPG|thumb|150px|Participant in the 2015 fashion show coming off the stage]]
The Feria is held every year at the Chapala Yacht Club in Chapala, Jalisco. This town in noted for its position on [[Lake Chapala]] as well as being home to many American and Canadian retirees who live or winter here.&lt;ref name=recibe&gt;{{cite news  |title= Chapala recibe a los 'Maestros del Arte' |newspaper=Informador |location=Guadalajara |date=November 3, 2014|url= http://www.informador.com.mx/cultura/2014/559423/6/chapala-recibe-a-los-maestros-del-arte.htm |accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a three-day event held every November, with the main attraction being stalls of merchandise brought by Mexican artisans for sale. As of 2015, there are over 80 participating artisans, from various Mexican states, especially [[Chiapas handcrafts and folk art|Chiapas]], [[Oaxaca handcrafts and folk art|Oaxaca]], [[Michoacán handcrafts and folk art|Michoacán]] and [[Jalisco handcrafts and folk art|Jalisco]]. However, there have been representatives from as far north as [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and south to [[Yucatán]].&lt;ref name=recibe/&gt;&lt;ref name=preparate&gt;{{cite news  |title= Prepárate para la Feria Maestros del Arte en Chapala |newspaper=Siempre |location=Mexico City |date=November 10, 2014|url= http://www.siempre.com.mx/2014/11/preparate-para-la-feria-maestros-del-arte-en-chapala/ |accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jalgob&gt;{{cite web  |title= Expondrá Chapala arte popular mexicano |publisher=State of Jalisco |location=Mexico  |url= http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/en/prensa/noticias/17671|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wares vary from many kinds of pottery such as [[Ceramics of Jalisco|bruñido (burnished), petallillo]], pineapple forms from Michoacan, recreations of pre Hispanic pieces, [[Amate|amate paper]], alpaca cutlery, [[Alebrijes de Oaxaca|alebrijes]] from Oaxaca, wicker furniture, dolls, [[La Calavera Catrina|Catrina figures]] and numerous textiles, especially from Oaxaca and Chiapas.&lt;ref name=mexconnect/&gt;&lt;ref name=preparate/&gt; To date, the event has been popular mostly with foreign buyers, both living in and visiting Mexico, but it does attract a number of Mexican buyers as well. Many of the buyers are folk art collectors.&lt;ref name=preparate/&gt;&lt;ref name=doceanos&gt;{{cite news  |title= Doce años de Maestros del Arte en Chapala |newspaper=Semanario de Laguna |location=Chapala |date=November 13, 2014|url= http://semanariolaguna.com/5363/|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chapala051.JPG|thumb|left|Roberto D. Mejia demonstrating popotillo art at the Feria]]
The artisans who participated are invited by the organization and change each year.  These artisans are vetted by representatives of the Feria, with visits to workshops to see what is done, the quality and the make sure the wares are made by the artisans themselves.&lt;ref name=feriapage/&gt; Some are already well known in Mexican folk art circles, such as those featured in works such as the Grand Masters of Mexican Folk Art, but others are completely unknown.&lt;ref name=feriapage/&gt;&lt;ref name=recibe/&gt; Some are families who have done the craft for generations.&lt;ref name=feriapage/&gt;&lt;ref name=mexconnect/&gt; As the purpose is to support the artisans, participants are not charged booth fees or a percentage of sales.&lt;ref name=mexconnect/&gt; Transportation of artisans is paid for by the Feria as well, with the same being housed by volunteer families in their homes. These families are mostly expats living in and near Chapala, and they not only provide beds, but also food and social outlets.&lt;ref name=preparate/&gt;&lt;ref name=mexconnect/&gt;&lt;ref name=llenaran/&gt; The organization states that it helps to create inter-cultural bonds, and for many of the artisans, their first contact with the world outside their home.&lt;ref name=feriapage/&gt; Some of the artisans are illiterate and many never have been out of their hometowns.&lt;ref name=mexconnect/&gt;

The Feria also incorporates musical events, dance performances, food and beverage tastings and had had talks by folk art experts such as [[Marta Turok]], Susana Valadez and Marc Navarro. There have also been exhibitions of the making of objects and fashion shows to highlight the importance of traditional garments.&lt;ref name=mexconnect/&gt;

==History==
The idea for the Feria originated with Marianne Carlson, an American expat living in [[Chapala, Jalisco]], who went to tour seventeen craft villages around [[Lake Pátzcuaro|Lake Patzcuaro]] in 2002. There she found craft traditions unknown to most people, and which instead were only sold in local markets and fairs.&lt;ref name=feriapage/&gt;&lt;ref name=recibe/&gt;&lt;ref name=mexconnect/&gt;

She decided to organize a handcrafts and folk art fair in Chapala later that same year, with thirteen artisans participating.&lt;ref name=feriapage/&gt;&lt;ref name=recibe/&gt; The original idea was to begin it as a business, but after the first event, Carlson decided against this.&lt;ref name=feriapage/&gt;&lt;ref name=mexconnect/&gt;

Since it began, the event has grown in size, both in volunteers and participating artisans,&lt;ref name=mexconnect/&gt; having had artisans from sixteen of Mexico’s 32 federal entities.&lt;ref name=jalgob/&gt;&lt;ref name=alistan&gt;{{cite news  |title= Alistan la Feria Maestros del Arte en Chapala |newspaper=El Mexicano |location=Mexico City |date=November 10, 2014|url= http://www.oem.com.mx/elmexicano/notas/n3601830.htm |accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Feria association became a non-profit in 2008.&lt;ref name=preparate/&gt;

In 2012, the group sponsored the making of a giant [[cartonería]] (paper mache) alebrije by Alejandro Camacho of [[Xochimilco]] for the [[Mexico City Alebrije Parade|Mexico City Monumental Alebrije parade]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=preparate/&gt;&lt;ref name=jalgob/&gt;

'''''Forbidden: Undocumented and Queer in Rural America''''' is a 2016 documentary about Moises Serrano,&lt;ref name="serrano-op-ed"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Serrano|first1=Moises|title=Op-ed: Undocumented, Queer, and Bullied|url=http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2014/12/08/op-ed-undocumented-queer-and-bullied|accessdate=14 July 2016|work=The Advocate|date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who grew up [[queer]] and [[undocumented immigrant|undocumented]] in [[Yadkinville, North Carolina]].  Produced by director Tiffany Rhynard and editor Heather Mathews, the immigration reform documentary had its world premiere in Los Angeles at [[Outfest]] on July 12, 2016.&lt;ref name="isaac-tim"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Isaac|first1=Tim|title=Forbidden: Undocumented and Queer in Rural America Trailer - Living as an undocumented gay man in the American South - Big Gay Picture Show|url=http://www.biggaypictureshow.com/bgps/2016/06/forbidden-trailer-living-undocumented-gay-man-american-south/|accessdate=14 July 2016|work=Big Gay Picture Show|date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Moises Serrano ==

The subject of ''Forbidden'' is Moises Serrano.&lt;ref name="russell"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Russell|first1=John|title=He's Here, He's Queer, He's Undocumented. The "Forbidden" Story Of Moises Serrano|url=http://www.newnownext.com/hes-here-hes-queer-hes-undocumented-the-forbidden-story-of-moises-serrano/07/2016/|accessdate=14 July 2016|work=NewNowNext|publisher=Logo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When he was an infant, Serrano's parents fled [[Mexico]] in search of the [[American dream]]. Forbidden to live and love as an undocumented [[gay man]] in the country he calls home, Serrano saw only one option—to fight for justice.  He is just like the thousands of other young people growing up in the United States with steadfast dreams, however being gay and undocumented in the rural South presents tremendous challenges. This film chronicles Serrano’s work as an activist, traveling across his home state of [[North Carolina]] as a voice for his community, and trying to forge a legal path for their future.  

Serrano's journey illustrates the intersection of [[queer]] and [[immigrant]] issues, highlighting the challenges facing [[LGBT]] people growing up in the rural South, where racism and homophobia are not uncommon.  Part of the film takes place in the spring of 2016, when presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] invoked heated anti-immigrant rhetoric.  At the same time North Carolina passed discriminatory laws against the LGBT community.  ''Forbidden'' humanizes the issues of immigration and gay rights, demonstrating how one individual has the power to combat the destructive oppression of an entire group of people. 
 
In claiming his identity as undocumented, Serrano risked deportation for himself and his family.  His story demonstrates courage, conviction and an unyielding quest to challenge the circumstances in which he was born.  ''Forbidden'' has inspired many other undocumented people to speak out, tell their stories, and join with like-minded politicians to affect change to U.S. immigration policy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a78d9Gr--cE&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gaur''' ('today' in [[Basque language|Basque]]) was a Basque artistic group founded in 1966 by [[Amable Arias]], [[Rafael Ruiz Balerdi]], [[Nestor Basterretxea]], [[Eduardo Chillida]], [[Remigio Mendiburu]], [[Jorge Oteiza]], [[José Antonio Sistiaga]], and [[José Luis Zumeta]].&lt;ref name="Bilbao"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.museobilbao.com/in/exposiciones/amable-balerdi-basterretxea-chillida-mendiburu-oteiza-sistiaga-zumeta-243|title=Amable, Balerdi, Basterretxea, Chillida, Mendiburu, Oteiza, Sistiaga, Zumeta|publisher=Bilbao Fine Arts Museum|access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The avant-guard group, based in [[Gipuzkoa]], Spain, provided the springboard for a wide [[History of the Basques|Basque]] artistic movement with close links to influential social, cultural and political agents in the Basque Country opposed to Franco's dictatorship during the 70s and early 80s. 

The group launched with an exhibition on 28 April 1966 at the Barandiarán Gallery in [[San Sebastián]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dss2016.eu/en/news/item/2630-the-50th-anniversary-of-the-gaur-group-the-barandiaran-gallery-and-the-contemporary-art-in-the-exhibition-1966-gaur-konstelazioak-2016|title=The 50th anniversary of the Gaur Group, the Barandiaran Gallery and the contemporary art in the exhibition 1966 {{!}} Gaur Konstelazioak {{!}} 2016|work=dss2016.eu|publisher=San Sebastian 2016 – Donostia 2016|date=22 January 2016|access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogo.artium.org/dossieres/1/eduardo-chillida/obra/grupo-gaur|title=Grupo Gaur|trans-title=Gaur Group|publisher=Artium|access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It challenged the aesthetic moulds and artistic conventions prevailing during that period in Gipuzkoa, and the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] altogether. The artists founding the movement stirred at the rapid economic and social changes taking place at the moment, the virtually non-existent cultural scene, and the crisis of the Basque collective identity.

It stood out as the most prolific artistic group in a constellation of groups founded across all the Basque Country during the same period that made up the Basque Art School.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3161">'''"Genre-busting"''' is a term used occasionally in reviews of written work, music and visual art and refers to the author or artist's ability to cross over two or more established styles. For instance, in writing, to combine the horror [[genre]] with a [[Western (genre)|western]] or [[hard-boiled]] detective story with [[science fiction]]. In music the term may refer to a song combining styles or defying classification.

The sound of the term calls to mind other uses of "buster" such as "crime buster", "[[Gangbusters]]", "[[Ghostbusters]]", "[[No. 617 Squadron RAF|Dambusters]]", etc.

Creative people don't always feel comfortable working within an established category. So genre-busting within the publishing world has become a type of [[literary fiction]]. The publisher [[Atticus Books]] has gone so far as to declare, on their website: ''"We specialize in genre-busting literary fiction—i.e., titles that fall between the cracks of genre fiction and compelling narratives that feature memorable main characters."''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://atticusbooksonline.com/about |title=Atticus Books (about) |publisher=atticusbooksonline.com |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Video Movie Guide 1998'' stated in its foreword, "In past years, reviews in VMG have been broken down into genre categories. Now, by popular demand, we are listing all movies together in alphabetical order.... So many movies today mix genres... and there are no clear-cut categories anymore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Mick|last2=Porter|first2=Marsha|title=Video Movie Guide 1998|date=October 1997|isbn=978-0345424235|pages=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviewed in ''Mustard'' comedy magazine in 2005, writer [[Alan Moore]] said: "I mean, this is probably a bad thing to say to someone from a comedy magazine, but I don't like genre. I think that genre was made up by some spotty clerk in [[WH Smiths]] in the 1920s to make his worthless fucking job a little easier for him: "it'd be easier if these books said what they were about on the spine."" going on to say: "In the novel I'm writing, Jerusalem, there's an awful lot of funny stuff, and there's supernatural stuff; there's stuff in the prologue that's as good as [[Stephen King]] and it's just a description of my brother walking through a block of flats. It's horror. And there's social history, there's political stuff. Why not mix it all together? Because that's what life is actually like. We laugh, we cry, you know, we buy the t-shirt." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.mustardweb.org/04/page15.htm |title=The Mustard Interview |publisher=mustardweb.org |date=January 2005 |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last few years, Tehran Municipality has been drawing graffiti in order to beautify the city. A large number of governmental graffiti is about the [[Iranian Revolution]], [[Politics of Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran policies]] and The Politics of Resistance. Pro-democracy activists are also continuing a political graffiti campaign in Tehran. [[Islamic graffiti]] can also be seen around the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observers.france24.com/content/20100302-tehran-graffiti-war-green-movement-basij-militia-spray-paint-tags Tehran’s graffiti war].

[[File:Hadrians Wall map.svg|thumb|right|Location of Hadrian's Wall and the [[Antonine Wall]]]]
{{RomanMilitary}}

'''Hadrian's Wall''' ({{lang-la|Vallum Aelium}}), also called the '''Roman Wall''', '''Picts' Wall''', or ''Vallum Hadriani'' in Latin, was a defensive fortification in the [[Roman province]] of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], begun in AD 122 in the reign of the emperor [[Hadrian]]. It ran from the banks of the [[River Tyne, England|River Tyne]] near the North Sea to the [[Solway Firth]] on the [[Irish Sea]], and was the northern limit of the [[Roman Empire]], immediately north of which were the lands of the northern [[Ancient Britons]], including the [[Picts]].

It had a stone base and a stone wall. There were [[milecastle]]s with two [[Turret (Hadrian's Wall)|turrets]] in between. There was a fort about every five [[Mile#Roman mile|Roman miles]]. From north to south, the wall comprised a ditch, wall, [[Military Way (Hadrian's Wall)|military way]] and [[Vallum (Hadrian's Wall)|vallum]], another ditch with adjoining mounds. It is thought the milecastles were staffed with static [[garrison]]s, whereas the forts had fighting garrisons of infantry and cavalry. In addition to the wall's defensive military role, its gates may have been [[customs]] posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9558984/Brian-Dobson.html |title=Obituary: Brian Dobson |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=21 September 2012|access-date=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant portion of the wall still stands and can be followed on foot along the adjoining [[Hadrian's Wall Path]]. The largest Roman artifact anywhere, it runs a total of {{convert|73|mi|1|abbr=off}}  in [[northern England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hadrian's Wall: A horde of ancient treasures make for a compelling new Cumbrian exhibition|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/hadrians-wall-a-horde-of-ancient-treasures-make-for-a-compelling-new-cumbrian-exhibition-2301329.html|agency=The Independent|date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarded as a [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British cultural icon]], Hadrian's Wall is one of Britain's major ancient tourist attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More than 25,000 people see Hadrian's Wall lit up|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/8571921.stm|agency=BBC|date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designated as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040722025655/http://accessibility.english-heritage.org.uk/default.asp?wci=Node&amp;wce=8410|title=Hadrian's Wall - English Heritage|date=22 July 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, the [[Antonine Wall|Antonine wall]], thought by some to be based on Hadrian's wall (the Gillam hypothesis),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rohl|first1=Darrell, Jesse|title=More than a Roman Monument: A Place-centred Approach to the Long-term History and Archaeology of the Antonine Wall|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/9458/1/DarrellRohl_PhDThesis_2014.pdf?DDD6+#page=216|website=Durham Theses|publisher=Durham University. Available at Durham E-Theses Online ref: 9458|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was not declared a World Heritage site until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/tayside_and_central/7494680.stm "Wall gains World Heritage status"] BBC News. Retrieved 8 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/430|title=Frontiers of the Roman Empire|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a common misconception that Hadrian's Wall marks the boundary between England and Scotland. In fact Hadrian's Wall lies entirely within England and has never formed the [[Anglo-Scottish border]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.english-heritage.org.uk/30-surprising-facts-hadrians-wall/ English Heritage. ''30 Surprising Facts About Hadrian's Wall''] Retrieved 18 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is less than {{convert|0.6|mi|km|1|abbr=on}} south of the border with Scotland in the west at Bowness-on-Solway, in the east it is as much as {{convert|68|mi|km}} away.

==Dimensions==
Hadrian's Wall was 80 [[Roman mile]]s or {{convert|117.5|km|1|abbr=on}} long;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/hadrian_gallery_01.shtml |title=BBC – History – Hadrian's Wall Gallery |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1 January 2013 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; its width and height varied according to the construction materials available nearby. East of the [[River Irthing]], the wall was made from squared stone and measured {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} wide and {{convert|5|to|6|m|ft|abbr=off}} high, while west of the river the wall was originally made from [[Sod#As a building material|turf]] and measured {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide and {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=off}} high; it was later rebuilt in stone. These dimensions do not include the wall's ditches, [[berm]]s and forts. The central section measured eight Roman feet wide (7.8&amp;nbsp;ft or 2.4&amp;nbsp;m) on a {{convert|3|m|sing=on|abbr=on|0}} base. Some parts of this section of the wall survive to a height of {{convert|3|m|abbr=on|0}}.

Immediately south of the wall, a large ditch was dug, with adjoining parallel mounds, one on either side. This is known today as the [[Vallum (Hadrian's Wall)|Vallum]], even though the word ''Vallum'' in Latin is the origin of the English word ''wall'', and does not refer to a ditch. In many places – for example [[Limestone Corner]] – the Vallum is better preserved than the wall, which has been robbed of much of its stone.

==Route==
[[File:Hadrian's Wall map.svg|thumb|right|Route of Hadrian's Wall]]
[[File:Hadrian's wall at Greenhead Lough.jpg|thumb|right|Sections of Hadrian's Wall remain along the route, though much has been dismantled over the years to use the stones for various nearby construction projects.]]

Hadrian's Wall extended west from [[Segedunum]] at [[Wallsend]] on the [[River Tyne, England|River Tyne]], via [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] and [[Kirkandrews-on-Eden]], to the shore of the [[Solway Firth]], ending a short but unknown distance west of the village of [[Bowness-on-Solway]].&lt;ref name=collingwood&gt;{{cite book |first=David J|last=Breeze|title=Handbook to the Roman Wall |edition=14th – November 2006|date=November 2006 |publisher=Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne (1934) |isbn=978-0-901082-65-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[A69 road|A69]] and [[B6318 Military Road|B6318]] roads follow the course of the wall from [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], then along the northern coast of Cumbria (south shore of the [[Solway Firth]]).

Although the [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] ends near Bowness-on-Solway, this does not mark the end of the line of defensive structures. The system of [[milecastle]]s and [[Turret (Hadrian's Wall)|turrets]] is known to have continued along the [[Cumbria]] coast as far as Risehow, south of [[Maryport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Breeze|first=D.J.|chapter=Roman military sites on the Cumbrian coast|location=Kendal|publisher=Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian &amp; Archaeological Society on behalf of the Trustees of the Senhouse Roman Museum, Maryport|year=2004|title=Romans on the Solway : essays in honour of Richard Bellhouse|editor= R.J.A. Wilson and I.D Caruana, eds|pages=1–231, p.66–94|series=CWAAS Extra Series, vol.31|isbn=978-1873124390}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For classification purposes, the milecastles west of Bowness-on-Solway are referred to as [[Milefortlet]]s.

==Purpose of construction==
[[File:Hadrianswall2007.jpg|thumb|right|Hadrian's Wall facing east towards [[Crag Lough]]]]
Hadrian's Wall was probably planned before [[Hadrian]]'s visit to Britain in AD 122. According to restored sandstone fragments found in [[Jarrow]] which date from 118 or 119, it was Hadrian's wish to keep "intact the empire", which had been imposed on him via "divine instruction".&lt;ref name="Anthony Everitt"&gt;[[Anthony Everitt]], ''Hadrian and the Triumph of Rome'' (2009), Random House, Inc, 448 pages; {{ISBN|0-8129-7814-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hadrian's biographer wrote {{nobreak|"[Hadrian]}} was the first to build a wall 80 miles long to separate the Romans from the barbarians", reasons for the construction of the wall vary, and no recording of an exact explanation survives.&lt;ref name=script&gt;{{Cite book|author=Unknown|title=Scriptores Historiae Augustae|volume=Vita Hadriani|chapter=11.2|title-link=Augustan History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories have been presented by historians, mostly of an expression of Roman power and Hadrian's policy of defence before expansion. On his accession to the throne in 117, there was unrest and rebellion in [[Roman Britain]] and from the peoples of various conquered lands across the Empire, including [[Egypt]], [[Judea]], [[Libya]] and [[Mauritania]].&lt;ref name="Anthony Everitt"/&gt;

These troubles may have influenced Hadrian's plan to construct the wall as well as his construction of [[Limes|''limites'']] in other areas of the Empire, but to what extent is unknown. Scholars disagree over how much of a threat the inhabitants of northern Britain really presented and whether there was any economic advantage in defending and garrisoning a fixed line of defences like the Wall, rather than conquering and annexing what has become the [[Scottish Lowlands]] and defending the territory with a loose arrangement of forts.&lt;ref name="Anthony Everitt"/&gt;

The ''limites'' of Rome were never expected to stop tribes from migrating or armies from invading, and while a frontier protected by a palisade or stone wall would help curb cattle-raiders and the incursions of other small groups,&lt;ref name="Stephen Johnson 2004"&gt;Stephen Johnson (2004) Hadrian's Wall, Sterling Publishing Company, Inc, 128 pages, {{ISBN|0-7134-8840-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the economic viability of constructing and keeping guarded a wall {{convert|72|mi|km|adj=off}} long along a sparsely populated border to stop small-scale raiding is dubious.&lt;ref name="Anthony Everitt"/&gt;

Another possible explanation for the wall is the degree of control it would have provided over immigration, smuggling and customs.&lt;ref name="Anthony Everitt"/&gt; ''Limites'' did not strictly mark the boundaries of the empire: Roman power and influence often extended beyond the walls.&lt;ref name="Anthony Everitt"/&gt; People within and beyond the ''limites'' travelled through it each day when conducting business, and organised check-points like those offered by Hadrian's Wall provided good opportunities for taxation. With watch towers only a short distance from gateways in the ''limites'', patrolling legionaries could have kept track of entering and exiting natives and Roman citizens alike, charging customs dues and checking for smuggling.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Another theory is of a simpler variety{{mdash}}that Hadrian's Wall was partly constructed to reflect the power of Rome and was used as a political point by Hadrian. Once its construction was finished, it is thought to have been covered in plaster and then whitewashed: its shining surface reflected the sunlight and was visible for miles around.&lt;ref name="Anthony Everitt"/&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Corbridge stangate.jpg|thumb|left|Roman fort and town at [[Corbridge|Corstopitum]] viewed along the [[Stanegate]]]]

Construction started in AD 122&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Breeze|first1= D.J.|last2=Dobson|first2= B.|year=2000|title=Hadrian's Wall|edition=4|location= London|publisher= Penguin Books|page=86|isbn= 978-0140271829}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was largely completed in six years.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 271.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction started in the east, between milecastles four and seven, and proceeded westwards, with soldiers from all three of the occupying [[Roman legion]]s participating in the work. The route chosen largely paralleled the nearby [[Stanegate]] road from [[Luguvalium]] ([[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]) to [[Coria (Corbridge)|Coria]] ([[Corbridge]]), upon which were situated a series of forts, including [[Vindolanda]]. The wall in its central and best-preserved section follows a hard, resistant igneous [[diabase]] rock escarpment, known as the [[Whin Sill]].

The initial plan called for a ditch and wall with 80 small gated [[milecastle]] fortlets, one placed every Roman mile, holding a few dozen troops each, and pairs of evenly spaced intermediate [[turret]]s used for [[observation]] and signalling. However, very few milecastles are actually sited at exact Roman mile divisions: they can be up to 200 yards east or west because of landscape features or to improve signalling to the Stanegate forts to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Woolliscroft, D., 1989, "Signalling and the design of Hadrian's Wall", Archaeologia Aeliana 5th Series, Vol. XVII, pp. 5–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Local [[limestone]] was used in the construction, except for the section to the west of the [[River Irthing]] where turf was originally used instead, for unknown reasons; it was later rebuilt in stone. Milecastles in this area were also built from timber and earth rather than stone, but turrets were always made from stone. The Broad Wall was initially built with a clay-bonded rubble core and mortared dressed rubble facing stones, but this seems to have made it vulnerable to collapse, and repair with a mortared core was sometimes necessary.

The milecastles and turrets were of three different designs, depending on which [[Roman legion]] built them – inscriptions of the [[Legio II Augusta|Second]], [[Legio VI Victrix|Sixth]], and [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|Twentieth]] Legions, show that all were involved in the construction. The turrets were about {{convert|493|m|yd|abbr=off}} apart and measured 14.02 square metres (150.9 square feet) internally.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Construction was divided into lengths of about {{convert|5|mi|km}}. One group of each legion would excavate the foundations and build the milecastles and turrets and then other [[cohort (military unit)|cohorts]] would follow with the wall construction. The wall was finished in 128.

==="Broad Wall" and "Narrow Wall"===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
[[File:Hadrian's Wall Vallum - 2007-05-19.jpg|thumb|[[Vallum (Hadrian's Wall)|Vallum]] at Hadrian's Wall near Milecastle 42 (Cawfields)]]

Early in its construction, just after reaching the [[River Tyne|North Tyne]], the width of the wall was narrowed to {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} or even less (sometimes 1.8 metres) (the "Narrow Wall"). However, Broad Wall foundations had already been laid as far as the [[River Irthing]], where the Turf Wall began, demonstrating that construction worked from east to west. Many [[turrets]] and [[milecastle]]s were optimistically provided with wider stub "[[wing wall]]s" in preparation for joining to the Broad Wall, offering a handy reference for archaeologists trying to piece together the construction chronology.

Within a few years it was decided to add a total of 14 to 17 (sources{{which|date=May 2015}} disagree) full-sized forts along the length of the wall, including [[Vercovicium]] ([[Housesteads]]) and [[Banna (Birdoswald)|Banna]] ([[Birdoswald]]), each holding between 500 and 1,000 [[auxilia]]ry troops (no legions were posted to the wall). The eastern end of the wall was extended further east from [[Pons Aelius]] ([[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]) to [[Segedunum]] (Wallsend) on the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] estuary. Some of the larger forts along the wall, such as [[Cilurnum]] (Chesters) and [[Vercovicium]] (Housesteads), were built on top of the footings of milecastles or turrets, showing the change of plan. An inscription mentioning early [[Roman governors of Britain|governor]] [[Aulus Platorius Nepos]] indicates that the change of plans took place early on. Also, some time during Hadrian's reign (before 138) the wall west of the Irthing was rebuilt in sandstone to about the same dimensions as the limestone section to the east.

[[File:Hadrianswall-cross-section.png|thumb|right|Cross section of the works]]

After most of the forts had been added, the [[Vallum (Hadrian's Wall)|Vallum]] was built on the southern side. The wall was thus part of a defensive system which, from north to south, included:
* A row of forts built {{convert|5|to|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of the wall, used for scouting and intelligence (e.g. [[Bewcastle Roman Fort]])
* a [[glacis]] and a deep ditch
* a [[berm]] with rows of pits holding entanglements
* the curtain wall
* a later military road (the [[Military Way (Hadrian's Wall)|Military Way]])
* The [[Vallum]].

==={{anchor|Turf Wall}}Turf wall===
From [[Milecastle 49]] to the western terminus of the wall at Bowness-on-Solway, the curtain wall was originally constructed from turf, possibly due to the absence of limestone for the manufacture of mortar.&lt;ref name=handbookTW&gt;{{Cite book|first=David J|last=Breeze|title=Handbook to the Roman Wall |edition=14th – November 2006|publisher=Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne|year=1934|isbn=978-0-901082-65-7|pages=55–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the Turf Wall was demolished and replaced with a stone wall. This took place in two phases; the first (from the River Irthing to a point west of [[Milecastle 54]]), during the reign of Hadrian, and the second following the reoccupation of Hadrian's Wall subsequent to the abandonment of the [[Antonine Wall]] (though it has also been suggested that this second phase took place during the reign of [[Septimius Severus]]). The line of the new stone wall follows the line of the turf wall, apart from the stretch between Milecastle 49 and [[Milecastle 51]], where the line of the stone wall is slightly further to the north.&lt;ref name=handbookTW/&gt;

In the stretch around [[Milecastle 50TW]], it was built on a flat base with three to four courses of turf blocks.&lt;ref name="CumbWest220"&gt;{{Citation | last = Simpson | first = F G | last2 = Richmond | first2 = I A | last3 = St Joseph | first3 = K | year = 1935 | title = Report of the Cumberland Excavation Committee for 1934 | &lt;!--chapter = 2. The Turf Wall milecastle at High House--&gt; | journal = Transactions of the Cumberland &amp; Westmorland Antiquarian &amp; Archaeological Society | series = new series | volume = 35 | pages = 220–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; A basal layer of cobbles was used westwards from [[Milecastle 72]] (at Burgh-by-Sands) and possibly at [[Milecastle 53]].&lt;ref name="CumbWest262"&gt;{{Citation | last = Simpson | first = F G | last2 = MacIntyre | first2 = J | year = 1933 | title = Report of the Cumberland Excavation Committee for 1932 | &lt;!--chapter = 2.

At its base, the now-demolished turf wall was {{convert|6|m|ft}} wide, and built in courses of turf blocks measuring {{convert|18|inch|cm}} long by {{convert|12|inch|cm}} deep by {{convert|6|inch|cm}} high, to a height estimated at around {{convert|3.66|m|ft}}. The north face is thought to have had a slope of 75%, whereas the south face is thought to have started vertical above the foundation, quickly becoming much shallower.&lt;ref name=handbookTW/&gt;

===Standards===

Above the stone curtain wall's foundations, one or more footing courses were laid. Offsets were introduced above these footing courses (on both the north and south faces), which reduced the wall's width. Where the width of the curtain wall is stated, it is in reference to the width above the offset. Two standards of offset have been identified: Standard A, where the offset occurs above the first footing course, and Standard B, where the offset occurs after the third (or sometimes fourth) footing course.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{Citation|first=David J.|last=Breeze|title=Handbook to the Roman Wall |edition=14th – November 2006|publisher=Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne|year=1934|isbn=978-0-901082-65-7|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Garrison==
According to [[Sheppard Frere]], the garrison reflected the political rather than military purpose of the wall.  The wall provided the soldiers with an elevated platform from which they could safely observe movement of the local population.  It had "heavy provision of cavalry" which could sally out from any of the milestone gates though as mentioned earlier, the garrison was neither expected nor trained to the level necessary to defend a city wall.  Overall the fortifications appear to have required additional strengthening after the initial design and were stronger than their equivalent in Germany, probably reflecting local resentment.

Frere believes that the milecastles, which would have needed 1000–1500 men, were held by a patrolling garrison of [[Numerus (Roman military unit)|Numeri]], though he concedes that there are no inscriptions referring to Numeri in Britain at the time. Command headquarters was at [[Uxelodunum]] (nowadays called [[Stanwix]]) near Carlisle, where the [[Ala Gallorum Petriana]] was based.  A signalling system allowed communication in minutes between Stanwix and York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Britannia |date=1980 |publisher=Routlege &amp; Kegan Paul |author=Sheppard Frere |authorlink=Sheppard Frere |isbn=978-0-7100-8916-8 |pages=158–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further information on the garrisoning of the wall has been provided by the discovery of the [[Vindolanda tablets]], such as the record of an inspection on 18 May between AD 92 and AD 97 where only 456 of the full quota of 756 Dutch and Belgian troops were present, the rest being sick or otherwise absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Britain |date=2000 |publisher =BBC Worldwide Ltd |author=Simon Schama |authorlink=Simon Schama |isbn=978-0-563-38497-7|pages=34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Hadrian==
[[File:Leahill Turret 51B, looking East. Hadrian's Wall.JPG|left|thumb|Leahill 51B is a typical example of the many turrets built into the wall between the milecastles.]]
In the years after Hadrian's death in 138, the new emperor, [[Antoninus Pius]], essentially abandoned the wall, leaving it occupied in a support role, and began building a new wall called the [[Antonine Wall]], about {{convert|160|km|mi|-1}} north, in what later became known as the [[Scottish Lowlands]], across the isthmus running west-south-west to east-north-east, sometimes referred to as the [[Central Belt]] or [[Central Lowlands]]. This turf wall ran 40 Roman miles, or about {{convert|37.8|mi|km|abbr=on}}, and had significantly more forts than Hadrian's Wall. Antoninus was unable to conquer the northern tribes, so when [[Marcus Aurelius]] became emperor, he abandoned the Antonine Wall and reoccupied Hadrian's Wall as the main defensive barrier in 164. In 208–211, the Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] again tried to conquer [[Caledonia]] and temporarily reoccupied the Antonine Wall. The campaign ended inconclusively and the Romans eventually withdrew to Hadrian's Wall. [[Bede]], following [[Gildas]], wrote in [AD 730]:

{{quote|text= [the departing Romans] thinking that it might be some help to the allies [Britons], whom they were forced to abandon, constructed a strong stone wall from sea to sea, in a straight line between the towns that had been there built for fear of the enemy, where Severus also had formerly built a rampart.||Bede, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' Book I Chapter 12}}

Bede obviously identified Gildas' stone wall as Hadrian's Wall (actually built in the 120s) and he would appear to have deduced that the ditch-and-mound barrier known as the Vallum (just to the south of and contemporary with, Hadrian's Wall) was the rampart constructed by Severus. Many centuries would pass before just who built what became apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot-domesday.me.uk/s_wall.htm |title=Wall of Severus |publisher=Dot-domesday.me.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 4th century, barbarian invasions, economic decline and military coups loosened the Empire's hold on Britain. By 410, the estimated [[End of Roman rule in Britain]], the Roman administration and its legions were gone and Britain was left to look to its own defences and government.  Archaeologists have revealed that some parts of the wall remained occupied well into the 5th century. It has been suggested that some forts continued to be garrisoned by local Britons under the control of a [[Coel Hen]] figure and former [[dux]]. Hadrian's Wall fell into ruin and over the centuries the stone was reused in other local buildings. Enough survived in the 8th century for [[spolia]] from Hadrian's Wall to find their way into the construction of [[Jarrow Priory]].

[[File:clayton painting.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[William Bell Scott]]; the face of the centurion is that of [[John Clayton (Newcastle)|John Clayton]] (Painting at [[Wallington Hall]])]]

The wall fascinated [[John Speed]], who published a set of maps of England and Wales by county at the start of the 17th century. He described it as "the Picts Wall" (or "Pictes"; he uses both spellings). ''A map of Newecastle'' (sic), drawn in 1610 by William Matthew, described it as "Severus' Wall", mistakenly giving it the name ascribed by Bede to the Antonine Wall. The maps for [[Cumberland]] and [[Northumberland]] not only show the wall as a major feature, but are ornamented with drawings of Roman finds, together with, in the case of the Cumberland map, a [[cartouche (cartography)|cartouche]] in which he sets out a description of the wall itself.

===Preservation by John Clayton===
Much of the wall has now disappeared. Long sections of it were used for [[roadbuilding]] in the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-lakes.com/hadrians_wall.htm |title=Hadrian's Wall |website=English-lakes.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially by [[General Wade]] to build a military road (most of which lies beneath the present day B6318 "[[Military Road (Northumberland)|Military Road]]") to move troops to crush the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Jacobite insurrection]]. The preservation of much of what remains can be credited to [[John Clayton (Newcastle)|John Clayton]]. He trained as a lawyer and became [[town clerk]] of Newcastle in the 1830s. He became enthusiastic about preserving the wall after a visit to [[Cilurnum|Chesters]]. To prevent farmers taking stones from the wall, he began buying some of the land on which the wall stood. In 1834, he started purchasing property around Steel Rigg near [[Crag Lough]]. Eventually, he controlled land from [[Brunton, Northumberland|Brunton]] to Cawfields. This stretch included the sites of Chesters, [[Carrawburgh]], [[Housesteads]], and [[Vindolanda]]. Clayton carried out excavation at the fort at [[Cilurnum]] and at Housesteads, and he excavated some milecastles.

Clayton managed the farms he had acquired and succeeded in improving both the land and the livestock. His successful management produced a cash-flow, which could be invested in future restoration work. Workmen were employed to restore sections of the wall, generally up to a height of seven courses. The best example of the Clayton Wall is at Housesteads. After Clayton's death, the estate passed to relatives and was soon lost at gambling. Eventually, the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] began acquiring the land on which the wall stands. At [[Wallington Hall]], near Morpeth, there is a painting by [[William Bell Scott]], which shows a [[centurion]] supervising the building of the wall. The centurion has been given the face of John Clayton.

===World Heritage Site===
Hadrian's Wall was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1987, and in 2005 it became part of the transnational "[[Frontiers of the Roman Empire]]" World Heritage Site which also includes sites in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|title=Frontiers of the Roman Empire|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/430/|accessdate=26 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
[[File:Beacons lit along Hadrians Wall (geograph 4917923).jpg|thumb|right|In 2010, to commemorate the 1600th anniversary of the end of Roman rule in Britain, a series of 500 beacons were lit along the length of the wall]]

Although Hadrian's Wall was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, it remains unguarded, enabling visitors to climb and stand on the wall, although this is not encouraged, as it could damage the historic structure. On 13 March 2010, a public event [[Illuminating Hadrian's Wall]] took place, which saw the route of the wall lit with 500 beacons. On 31 August and 2 September 2012, there was a second illumination of the wall as a digital art installation called "Connecting Light", which was part of the [[2012 Cultural Olympiad|London 2012 Festival]].

===Hadrian's Wall Path===
{{Main|Hadrian's Wall Path}}
In 2003, a [[National Trail]] footpath was opened that follows the line of the wall from [[Wallsend]] to [[Bowness-on-Solway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/HadriansWall/ |publisher= National Trails |title=Hadrian's Wall Path|accessdate=26 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the fragile landscape, walkers are asked to follow the path only in summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/HadriansWall/text.asp?PageId=27 |publisher=Hadrians Wall Path National Trail |title=Every Footstep Counts – The Trail's Country Code|accessdate=26 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leahill Turret 51B, volunteer at 'Illuminating Hadrian's Wall' 2010.JPG|thumb|right|A volunteer stands inside [[Leahill Turret, Hadrian's Wall|Leahill Turret 51B]]]]

The only ancient source for its provenance is the ''[[Augustan History]]''. No sources survive to confirm what the wall was called in antiquity, and no historical literary source gives it a name. However, the discovery of the [[Staffordshire Moorlands Pan]] in Staffordshire in 2003 has provided a clue. This small enamelled bronze Roman ''trulla'' (ladle), dating to the 2nd century AD, is inscribed with a series of names of Roman forts along the western sector of the wall, together with a personal name and phrase: &lt;small&gt;MAIS COGGABATA VXELODVNVM CAMBOGLANNA RIGORE VALI AELI DRACONIS&lt;/small&gt;.

[[Bowness-on-Solway]] (&lt;small&gt;[[Mais (Bowness)|MAIS]]&lt;/small&gt;) is followed by Drumburgh-by-Sands (&lt;small&gt;[[Coggabata|COGGABATA]]&lt;/small&gt;), until now known only as &lt;small&gt;CONGAVATA&lt;/small&gt; from the late Roman document, the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]''. Next comes [[Stanwix]] (&lt;small&gt;[[Petriana|VXELODVNVM]]&lt;/small&gt;), then Castlesteads (&lt;small&gt;[[Camboglanna|CAMBOGLANNA]]&lt;/small&gt;). These are the four of the westernmost forts on Hadrian's Wall, excluding [[Aballava]] ([[Burgh by Sands]]).

&lt;small&gt;RIGORE&lt;/small&gt; (''rigōre'') is the [[ablative]] singular form of the Latin word ''rigor''. This can mean several things, but one of its lesser-known meanings is "straight line", "course", or "direction". This sense was used by Roman surveyors and appears on several inscriptions to indicate a line between places. So the meaning could be "according to the course".

There is no known word ''vali'', but ''vallum'' was the Latin word for an earthen wall, rampart, or fortification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2350146 |title=Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary, vallum |website=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern English usage ''vallum'' is applied to the ditch and adjoining mounds dug by the Roman army just south of the wall, but to the Romans a ''vallum'' was a wall and not a ditch (it is the source of the English word 'wall'). The genitive singular form of ''vallum'' is ''vallī'', so one of the most likely meanings is &lt;small&gt;VAL[L]I&lt;/small&gt;, "of the ''Wall''{{-"}}. Omitting one of a pair of [[Gemination#Latin_and_Romance_languages|doubled consonants]] is common on Roman inscriptions; moreover, an error in the transcription of a written note could be the reason: another similar bronze vessel, known as the [[Rudge Cup]] (found in Wiltshire in the 18th century) has VN missing from the name &lt;small&gt;VXELODVNVM&lt;/small&gt;, for example, although the letters appear on the Staffordshire Moorlands Pan. The Rudge Cup only bears fort names.

The name &lt;small&gt;AELI&lt;/small&gt; was Hadrian's ''[[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]'', his main family name, the ''[[Aelia (gens)|gens Aelia]]''. The Roman bridge and fort at [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] was called ''Pons Aelius''.

&lt;small&gt;DRACONIS&lt;/small&gt; can be translated as "[by the hand – or property] of Draco". It was normal for Roman manufacturers to give their names in the genitive ("of"), and "by the hand" would be understood. The form is common, for example, on [[Samian ware]].

The translation, therefore, could be:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mais, Coggabata, Uxelodunum, Camboglanna, according to the line of Aelian wall. [By the hand ''or'' The property] of Draco.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another possibility is that the individual's name was Aelius Draco, which would only leave us with an unspecified ''vallum'', "wall".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4650">'''Hysterical realism''', also called '''recherché postmodernism'''{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}, is a term coined in 2000 by English critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] to describe what he sees as a [[literary genre]] typified by a strong contrast between elaborately absurd prose, plotting, or characterization, on the one hand, and careful, detailed investigations of real, specific social phenomena on the other.

Wood introduced the term in an essay on [[Zadie Smith]]'s ''[[White Teeth]]'', which appeared in the July 24, 2000 issue of ''[[The New Republic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;James Wood, "[https://newrepublic.com/article/61361/human-all-too-inhuman Human, All Too Inhuman]," ''The New Republic Online''&lt;/ref&gt; Wood uses the term to denote the contemporary conception of the "big, ambitious novel" that pursues "vitality at all costs" and consequently "knows a thousand things but does not know a single human being."

He decried the genre as an attempt to "turn fiction into social theory," and an attempt to tell readers "how the world works rather than how somebody felt about something." Wood points to [[Don DeLillo]] and [[Thomas Pynchon]] as the forefathers of the genre, which continues, Wood says, in writers like [[David Foster Wallace]]. In response, [[Zadie Smith]] described ''hysterical realism'' as a "painfully accurate term for the sort of overblown, manic prose to be found in novels like my own ''White Teeth'' and a few others [Wood] was sweet enough to mention".&lt;ref name="how"&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith |first=Zadie |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/generalfiction/story/0,6000,568381,00.html |title=This is how it feels to me |publisher=The Guardian |date=2001-10-13 |accessdate=2007-03-21 }} and  [https://www.webcitation.org/5clsv4qWf?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/oct/13/fiction.afghanistan archived.]&lt;/ref&gt; Smith qualified the term, though, explaining that "any collective term for a supposed literary movement is always too large a net, catching significant dolphins among so much cannable tuna".

Wood's line of argument echoes many common criticisms of [[postmodernist]] art generally. In particular, Wood's attacks on DeLillo and Pynchon clearly echo similar criticisms other critics had already lodged against them a generation earlier. The "hysterical" prose style is often paired with "realistic"—almost journalistic—effects, such as Pynchon's depiction of 18th century [[Public Land Survey System|land survey]]s in ''[[Mason &amp; Dixon]]'', and [[Don DeLillo]]'s treatment of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] in ''[[Libra (novel)|Libra]]''.

There are two notable '''Ipswich Hoards'''. The first was a hoard of [[Anglo-Saxon]] coins discovered in 1863. The second was a hoard of six [[Iron Age]] [[gold]] [[torc]]s that was discovered in 1968 and 1969. The latter hoard has been described as second only to the [[Snettisham Hoard]] in importance as a hoard from the Iron Age, and is held at the [[British Museum]].

==First hoard (1863)==
The first hoard was found in an earthenware pot buried about {{convert|10|ft|m}} beneath the doorstep of the house at the corner of [[Old Buttermarket]] and St. Lawrence Lane in [[Ipswich]], which had previously belonged to numismatist [[James Conder]] (1763–1823), when it was demolished during road widening in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/features/coins_offer_up_clues_to_the_past_1_537702 Coins offer up clues to the past] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304064207/http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/features/coins_offer_up_clues_to_the_past_1_537702 |date=2012-03-04 }}, East Anglia Daily Times, 15 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported as consisting of 150 coins, although only 75 are known now. The coins were all silver pennies of the reign of [[Æthelred the Unready]], minted in London and Ipswich. It is tempting to associate this find with the ravaging of Ipswich which took place in 991. However clues in the coins indicate that the hoard may have been deposited between 979 and 985.&lt;ref name=metcalf&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RL8LMU_5tzcC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=%22ipswich+hoard%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dhpK1Gj1-S&amp;sig=p9ETBBpen8ZOxnLwPMIgRPiKKgE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6qZqTOXaLdSRjAf3lKWCAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ipswich%20hoard%22&amp;f=false An atlas of Anglo-Saxon and Norman coin finds, c.973-1086], David Michael Metcalf, p. 109, accessed August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second hoard (1968-9)==
[[File:5 Torcs from the Ipswich Hoard.jpg|thumb|5 Torcs from the Ipswich Hoard on display at the British Museum.]]

===Discovery===
Five neck ornaments called [[torc]]s were discovered in 1968 by the operator of a mechanical digger preparing ground for the construction of new housing in [[Belstead]], near Ipswich, for which the driver received £45,000;&lt;ref name=IpswichHoardDiscovery&gt;{{cite book|title=Treasure hoards of East Anglia and their discovery|page=14|publisher=Countryside Books|isbn=978-1-84674-147-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sixth torc of a slightly different design was discovered a year later by the owner of one of the newly completed houses when sorting though a pile of earth left by the building in his garden, for which he received £9,000.&lt;ref name=IpswichHoardDiscovery/&gt;

===Appearance===
The torcs were manufactured by twisting two strands of large diameter wire around each other and fashioning them into a near circle. The ends of the twisted wire are finished with terminal decorations. They are made from [[green gold]] as they have a lower proportion of silver in them than later finds, leading British Museum experts to date their manufacture to about 75 B.C. However the torcs may have been used by many generations before they were hoarded away.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt; The museum estimates that the maximum neck diameter of the people who wore these torcs was {{convert|18.7|cm|in}}.

These would have been created in wax around the ends of the wire. The wax is then coated, at least once, with a ceramic slurry and left to harden. The ceramic is then heated which allows the wax to leave and gold is poured into the cavity. This [[lost wax]] process allows the terminals to include a level of detail that was initially created on the wax. The terminals created for these torcs were hollow. Each of the torcs has a slightly different design for the left and right terminal.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/g/ipswich_hoard_gold_torcs.aspx Gold torcs from the Ipswich Hoard], British Museum, accessed 18 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
The 1968 finds are in room 50 of the British Museum, but there are also copies of these torcs in the [[Ipswich Museum]].&lt;ref name=shesh&gt;[http://www.sheshen-eceni.co.uk/icenian_gallery.html The Celtic Coin Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618053119/http://sheshen-eceni.co.uk/icenian_gallery.html |date=2006-06-18 }}, Sheshen Eceni, accessed 20 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3433">'''Liu Xiaofeng''' ({{zh|s=刘小枫}}, b. 1956) is a contemporary Chinese scholar and a professor at [[Renmin University of China]].  He has been considered the prototypical example of what is called a [[cultural Christian]] ({{zh|s=文化基督徒|p=wénhuà jīdūtú}}), meaning a believer who may lack a specific church identification or affiliation, and was, along with [[He Guanghu]], one of the main forerunners of the academic field of [[Sino-Christian Theology]] ({{zh|s=汉语神学|t=漢語神學|p=hànyǔ shénxué}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fällman|first=Fredrik|title=Salvation and Modernity: Intellectuals and Faith in Contemporary China|year=2008|publisher=University Press of America|location=Lanham, MA|isbn=9780761840909|pages=21–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in recent years, his interest has shifted from studies in [[Christian theology]] to the political theories of [[Leo Strauss]].

== Biography ==
Liu Xiaofeng was born in [[Chongqing]], [[China]], in April 1956.

He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in German language and literature at [[Sichuan International Studies University]] before beginning his [[Master of Arts]] in [[aesthetics]] at [[Peking University]] in 1982, completing it in 1985. He later received a scholarship to study at the [[University of Basel]] in [[Switzerland]] in April 1989, where he completed his [[Ph.D]] in [[Christian theology]] in 1993 on a theological investigation into [[Max Scheler|Max Scheler's]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and critique of modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Fällman, ''Salvation and Modernity'', 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also undertook an extensive translation effort of historical and contemporary Christian texts.  A modern writer commented, "Liu's writings have had a major impact in China not only on those Chinese who think of themselves as Christian, but on those who are interested in broad analysis of China in the context of the world's current cultural and philosophical era."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aikman|first=David|title=Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power|year=2003|publisher=Regnery Publishing, Inc.|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-59698-025-9|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his interpretation of Strauss and other modern Western thinkers has been criticized as one-sided and even deeply flawed; his defense of the Chinese Communist Party, and Mao Zedong in particular, does not go well together with Christianity, nor with Classical Western civilization as described by Strauss and his disciples &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marchal|first=Kai,|title=Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss in the Chinese-speaking World: Reorienting the Political|year=2017|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=978-1498536264|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He is a faculty member of Renmin University of China in the [[School of Liberal Arts]].

'''Ljubljana Graphic School''' is an internationally known group of artists whose art developed with [[Ljubljana Biennial of Graphic Arts]] and local [[Academy of Fine Arts in Ljubljana]].

The informal beginnings of the Ljubljana school of graphic arts are linked to the year 1955 and the first international graphic arts exhibition (later biennial). The endeavour for high technical perfection of the graphic print mainly carried out in the techniques of [[etching]] and [[aquatint]], the precision and the aspiration for the independence of printmaking as a medium were the main features of the group.

It still is Slovenia's most successful art brands that have established themselves on the international art scene.

'''Marbleizing''' or '''faux marbling''' is the preparation and finishing of a surface to imitate the appearance of polished [[marble]]. It is typically used in buildings where the cost or weight of genuine marble would be prohibitive. Faux marbling is a special case of faux painting used to create the distinctive and varied patterns of marble - the most imitated stone by far.

[[Image:Marble fresco - Capella dei Scrovegni - Padua 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Giotto]], [[Scrovegni Chapel]].]]

==History==
Faux stone painting was widely used in [[Pompeii]], but it really took off in Europe during the [[Renaissance]] with two schools of faux painting developing. The Italian school was loose and artistic, the French school was formal and realistic. It typically took an apprentice 10 years or more to fully master the art.

The sophistication of the techniques are such that visitors are frequently unable to distinguish between false and real marble in many churches, palaces and public buildings in Europe. The techniques were perfected by the 17th century and have been used in all styles of construction well into the 20th century, including [[Baroque]], [[palladian]], [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] and historical [[revival style]]s as well as [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]] buildings. Craftsmen who are able to replicate this work are still available, as evidenced, for example, by the extensive restorations of faux marble surfaces in important Eastern Europe buildings since 1990.

The art of marbling and graining reached its apogee in Britain between 1845 and 1870, and during this period the acknowledged master was [[Thomas Kershaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stewartmcdonald.co.uk/kershaw/kershaw.html| title = Thomas Kershaw 1819-1898 "Prince of Grainers &amp; Marblers"|accessdate = 2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thomas Kershaw==
Kershaw was born in Standish, Lancashire England in April 1819. At the age of 12 he was apprenticed to Mr. John Platt of Bolton who was paid the sum of £23 by Kershaw’s father in order that his son could be instructed in the craft of house painting. He worked 10 hours a day for six days a week. He completed his apprenticeship at the age of 21.
 
He achieved international fame, winning a number of the most prestigious awards at the major exhibitions of the age; The Great Exhibition, London, 1851 - a first prize medal; Exposition Universelle, Paris, 1855 - a first class medal; London Exhibition, 1862 - first prize.

Kershaw's work was so good that it was often considered to be indiscernible from the original. He undertook work in many large houses, mansions and stately homes throughout [[England]] and [[Wales]] and once declined an offer from the Russian Ambassador to imitate marbles on the interior of the Imperial Palace in [[St Petersburg]]. In 1858 he produced one of his important works in the Blue Room in [[Buckingham Palace]] where all the pillars were done in imitation marble.

==William Holgate==
In modern times, William Holgate (1931-2002) from Clitheroe, [[Lancashire]], was possibly the finest grainer and  marbler in the world since Thomas Kershaw held the title 150 years before.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} His achievements include the prestigious award known as the "Freedom of the City and Guilds of London" and he was very proud to be made "A Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Painter Stainers of Trinity Lane, London," on March 14, 1995. He was also given the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2001 Paris Salon. His apprentice and protégé, Andrew Johnstone continues his tradition.

==Techniques==
[[image:sch_mar_2.jpg|thumb|Example of a faux painting in antique verde marble]]
Other techniques for producing faux marble include [[Scagliola]], a costly process which involves the use of specially pigmented plasters, and [[terrazzo]]. For flooring, marble chips are imbedded in cement, then ground and polished to expose the marble aggregate.

Some professional faux finishers are very skilled and will use a variety of techniques to reproduce the colors, veining and luster of real marble or other building materials. However, many decorators will merely suggest the appearance of marble rather than accurately imitate a particular stone.

'''''Mein Kampf''''' ({{IPA-de|maɪ̯n kampf|lang}}, ''My Struggle'') is a 1925 autobiographical book by [[Nazi Party]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]].  The work describes the process by which Hitler became [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and outlines his [[Political views of Adolf Hitler|political ideology and future plans]] for Germany. Volume 1 of ''Mein Kampf'' was published in 1925 and Volume 2 in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;''Mein Kampf'' ''("My Fight"),'' Adolf Hitler (originally 1925–1926), Reissue edition (15 September 1998), Publisher: Mariner Books, Language: English, paperback, 720 pages, {{ISBN|978-1495333347}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was edited by Hitler's deputy [[Rudolf Hess]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=85}}&lt;ref&gt;Robert G.L. Waite, The Psychopathic God: Adolf Hitler, Basic Books, 1977, pp.237–243&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler began ''Mein Kampf'' while imprisoned for what he considered to be "political crimes" following [[Beer Hall Putsch|his failed Putsch in Munich]] in November 1923. Although Hitler received many visitors initially, he soon devoted himself entirely to the book. As he continued, Hitler realized that it would have to be a two-volume work, with the first volume scheduled for release in early 1925. The governor of [[Landsberg Prison|Landsberg]] noted at the time that "he [Hitler] hopes the book will run into many editions, thus enabling him to fulfill his financial obligations and to defray the expenses incurred at the time of his trial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heinz|first1=Heinz|title=Germany's Hitler|date=1934|publisher=Hurst &amp; Blackett|page=191|url=https://archive.org/details/GermanysHitler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Payne|first1=Robert|title=The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler|date=1973|publisher=Popular Library|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; After slow initial sales, the book was a bestseller in Germany after [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power |Hitler's rise to power]] in 1933.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=80–81}}

After Hitler's death, copyright of ''Mein Kampf'' passed to the state government of [[Bavaria]], which refused to allow any copying or printing of the book in Germany. In 2016, following the expiration of the copyright held by the Bavarian state government, ''Mein Kampf'' was republished in Germany for the first time since 1945, which prompted public debate and divided reactions from Jewish groups.

Hitler originally wanted to call his forthcoming book ''Viereinhalb Jahre (des Kampfes) gegen Lüge, Dummheit und Feigheit'', or ''Four and a Half Years (of Struggle) Against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice''.{{sfn|Bullock|1962|p=121}} [[Max Amann]], head of the Franz Eher Verlag and Hitler's publisher, is said to have suggested&lt;ref&gt;Richard Cohen.[https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/06/28/bookend/bookend.html "Guess Who's on the Backlist"].

== Analysis ==
In ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler used the main thesis of "the Jewish peril", which posits a Jewish conspiracy to gain world leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=32043&amp;amid=30237234 Mein Kampf – The Text, its Themes and Hitler's Vision], History Today&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative describes the process by which he became increasingly [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[militarism|militaristic]], especially during his years in Vienna. He speaks of not having met a [[Jew]] until he arrived in Vienna, and that at first his attitude was liberal and tolerant. When he first encountered the antisemitic press, he says, he dismissed it as unworthy of serious consideration. Later he accepted the same antisemitic views, which became crucial to his program of national reconstruction of Germany.

''Mein Kampf'' has also been studied as a work on [[political theory]]. For example, Hitler announces his hatred of what he believed to be the world's two evils: [[Communism]] and [[Judaism]].

In the book Hitler blamed Germany's chief woes on the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|parliament]] of the [[Weimar Republic]], the Jews, and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]], as well as [[Marxism|Marxists]], though he believed that Marxists, Social Democrats, and the parliament were all working for Jewish interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/meinkampf035176mbp|title=Mein Kampf|work=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced that he wanted to completely destroy the [[parliamentary system]], believing it to be corrupt in principle, as those who reach power are inherent [[opportunism|opportunists]].

===Antisemitism===
While historians dispute the exact date Hitler decided to [[Madagascar Plan|force the Jewish people to emigrate to Madagascar]], few place the decision before the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name=Browning2003p12&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher R. |last=Browning |authorlink=Christopher Browning |year=2003 |title=Initiating the Final Solution: The Fateful Months of September–October 1941 |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=53343660 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First published in 1925, ''Mein Kampf'' shows Hitler's personal grievances and his ambitions for creating a [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order]].

The historian [[Ian Kershaw]] points out that several passages in ''Mein Kampf'' are undeniably of a [[Genocide|genocidal]] nature.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw, Hitler 1889-1936 Hubris (1999), p.258&lt;/ref&gt;  Hitler wrote "the nationalization of our masses will succeed only when, aside from all the positive struggle for the soul of our people, their international poisoners are exterminated",&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, Volume One - A Reckoning, Chapter XII: The First Period of Development of the National Socialist German Workers' Party&lt;/ref&gt; and he suggested that, "If at the beginning of the war and during the war twelve or fifteen thousand of these Hebrew corrupters of the nation had been subjected to poison gas, such as had to be endured in the field by hundreds of thousands of our very best German workers of all classes and professions, then the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain."&lt;ref name="Yahil-1991"&gt;Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, Volume Two - A Reckoning, Chapter XV: The Right of Emergency Defense, p. 984, quoted in {{cite book |last=Yahlil |first=Leni |title=The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932–1945 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_aRvKpLUf0C&amp;pg=PA51 |accessdate=9 January 2016 |year=1991 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-504523-9 |page=51 |chapter=2. Hitler Implements Twentieth-Century Anti-Semitism |oclc=20169748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The racial laws to which Hitler referred resonate directly with his ideas in ''Mein Kampf''.  In the first edition of ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler stated that the destruction of the weak and sick is far more humane than their protection.  Apart from this allusion to humane treatment, Hitler saw a purpose in destroying "the weak" in order to provide the proper space and purity for the "strong".&lt;ref&gt;A. Hitler. Mein Kampf (Munich: Franz Eher Nachfolger, 1930), pg 478&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Lebensraum'' ("Living space")===
In the chapter "Eastern Orientation or Eastern Policy", Hitler argued that the Germans needed [[Lebensraum]] in the East, a "historic destiny" that would properly nurture the German people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2history.com/experts/Sir_Ian_Kershaw/Hitler_s_expansionist_aims|title=Hitler’s expansionist aims &gt; Professor Sir Ian Kershaw &gt; WW2History.com|website=ww2history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler believed that "the organization of a Russian state formation was not the result of the political abilities of the Slavs in Russia, but only a wonderful example of the state-forming efficacity of the German element in an inferior race."&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, Eastern Orientation or Eastern policy&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Mein Kampf'' Hitler openly stated the future German expansion in the East, foreshadowing [[Generalplan Ost]]:
{{quote|And so we National Socialists consciously draw a line beneath the foreign policy tendency of our pre-War period. We take up where we broke off six hundred years ago. We stop the endless German movement to the south and west, and turn our gaze toward the land in the east. At long last we break off the colonial and commercial policy of the pre-War period and shift to the soil policy of the future.

If we speak of soil in Europe today, we can primarily have in mind only Russia and her vassal border states.&lt;ref name="Fest2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joachim C. Fest|title=Hitler|date=1 February 2013|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-544-19554-X|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Hitler originally wrote ''Mein Kampf'' mostly for the followers of National Socialism, it grew in popularity after he rose to power. (Two other books written by party members, [[Gottfried Feder]]'s ''Breaking The Interest Slavery'' and [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]],'' have since lapsed into comparative literary obscurity, and no translation of Feder's book from the original German is known.)&lt;ref name="spiegel" /&gt; Hitler had made about 1.2 million Reichsmarks from the income of the book by 1933, when the average annual income of a teacher was about 4,800 Marks.&lt;ref name="spiegel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="taxes" /&gt; He accumulated a tax debt of 405,500 [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]] (very roughly in 2015 1.1 million [[Pound Sterling|GBP]], 1.4 million [[Euro|EUR]], 1.5 million [[United States dollar|USD]]) from the sale of about 240,000 copies before he became chancellor in 1933 (at which time his debt was waived).&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,druck-433526,00.html Mythos Ladenhüter] Spiegel Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taxes"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4105683.stm Hitler dodged taxes, expert finds] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler began to distance himself from the book after becoming chancellor of Germany in 1933. He dismissed it as "fantasies behind bars" that were little more than a series of articles for the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'', and later told [[Hans Frank]] that "If I had had any idea in 1924 that I would have become Reich chancellor, I never would have written the book."&lt;ref name="Ryback2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy W. Ryback|title=Hitler's Private Library: The Books that Shaped his Life|date=6 July 2010|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-7578-3|pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ''Mein Kampf'' was a bestseller in Germany during the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Guardian2016" /&gt; During Hitler's years in power, the book was in high demand in libraries and often reviewed and quoted in other publications. It was given free to every newlywed couple and every soldier fighting at the front.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt;  By 1939 it had sold 5.2 million copies in eleven languages.&lt;ref&gt;Mein Kampf work by Hitler. Encyclopædia Britannica. Last updated 19 February 2014. Retrieved 21 May 2015 from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/373362/Mein-Kampf&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, about 10 million copies of the book had been sold or distributed in Germany.

==Contemporary observations==
''Mein Kampf'', in essence, lays out the ideological program Hitler established for the German revolution, by identifying the Jews and "Bolsheviks" as racially and ideologically inferior and threatening, and "Aryans" and National Socialists as racially superior and politically progressive. Hitler's revolutionary goals included expulsion of the Jews from [[Greater Germany]] and the unification of German peoples into one Greater Germany. Hitler desired to restore German lands to their greatest historical extent, real or imagined.

Due to its [[racism|racist]] content and the historical effect of Nazism upon Europe during [[World War II]] and the [[Holocaust]], it is considered a highly controversial book. Criticism has not come solely from opponents of Nazism. [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] dictator and Nazi ally [[Benito Mussolini]] was also critical of the book, saying that it was "a boring [[wikt:tome|tome]] that I have never been able to read" and remarking that Hitler's beliefs, as expressed in the book, were "little more than commonplace clichés".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Denis Mack. 1983. ''Mussolini: A Biography''. New York: Vintage Books. p. 172 / London: Paladin, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

The German journalist [[Konrad Heiden]], an early critic of the Nazi Party, observed that the content of ''Mein Kampf'' is essentially a political argument with other members of the Nazi Party who had appeared to be Hitler's friends, but whom he was actually denouncing in the book's content – sometimes by not even including references to them.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

The American literary theorist and philosopher [[Kenneth Burke]] wrote a 1939 rhetorical analysis of the work, ''[[The Rhetoric of Hitler's "Battle"]]'', which revealed an underlying message of aggressive intent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uregina.ca/~rheaults/rhetor/2004/schmidt.pdf Uregina.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125085622/http://uregina.ca/~rheaults/rhetor/2004/schmidt.pdf |date=25 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American journalist [[John Gunther]] said in 1940 that compared to the autobiographies of [[My Life (Leon Trotsky autobiography)|Leon Trotsky]] or [[The Education of Henry Adams|Henry Adams]] ''Mein Kampf'' was "vapid, vain, rhetorical, diffuse, prolix. But it is a powerful and moving book, the product of great passionate feeling". He suggested that the book exhausted curious German readers, but its "ceaseless repetition of the argument, left impregnably in their minds, fecund and germinating".&lt;ref name="gunther1940"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n53/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers |location=New York| author=Gunther, John |authorlink=John Gunther| year=1940 | page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1940, British writer [[George Orwell]] reviewed a then-recently published uncensored translation of ''Mein Kampf'' for ''[[The New English Weekly]]''. Orwell suggested that the force of Hitler's personality shone through the often "clumsy" writing, capturing the magnetic allure of Hitler for many Germans. In essence, Orwell notes, Hitler offers only visions of endless struggle and conflict in the creation of "a horrible brainless empire" that "stretch[es] to [[Afghanistan]] or thereabouts". He wrote, "Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more grudging way, have said to people 'I offer you a good time,' Hitler has said to them, 'I offer you struggle, danger, and death,' and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet." Orwell's review was written in the aftermath of the 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], when Hitler made peace with USSR after more than a decade of vitriolic rhetoric and threats between the two nations; with the pact in place, Orwell believed, England was now facing a risk of Nazi attack and the UK must not underestimate the appeal of Hitler's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George. "Mein Kampf" review, reprinted in ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'', Vol 2., Sonia Orwell and Ian Angus, eds., Harourt Brace Jovanovich 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1943 book ''The Menace of the Herd'', Austrian scholar [[Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn]]&lt;ref&gt;Francis Stuart Campbell, pen name of [[Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn]] (1943), ''Menace of the Herd, or, Procrustes at Large'', Milwaukee, WI: The Bruce Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt; described Hitler's ideas in ''Mein Kampf'' and elsewhere as "a veritable ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of '[[Progressivism|progressive]]' thought"&lt;ref&gt;Kuehnelt-Leddihn, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; and betraying "a curious lack of original thought" that shows Hitler offered no innovative or original ideas but was merely "a ''virtuoso'' of commonplaces which he may or may not repeat in the guise of a 'new discovery.'"&lt;ref&gt;Kuehnelt-Leddihn, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's stated aim, Kuehnelt-Leddihn writes, is to quash individualism in furtherance of political goals:

{{quote|When Hitler and Mussolini attack the "western democracies" they insinuate that their "democracy" is not genuine. National Socialism envisages abolishing the difference in wealth, education, intellect, taste, philosophy, and habits by a leveling process which necessitates in turn a total control over the child and the adolescent. Every personal attitude will be branded—after communist pattern—as "[[bourgeois]]," and this in spite of the fact that the bourgeois is the representative of the most herdist class in the world, and that National Socialism is a basically bourgeois movement.

Hitler in ''Mein Kampf'' repeatedly speaks of the "masses" and the "herd" referring to the people. The German people should probably, in his view, remain a mass of identical "individuals" in an enormous sand heap or ant heap, identical even to the color of their shirts, the garment nearest to the body.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehnelt-Leddihn, pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his ''[[The Second World War (Churchill)|The Second World War]]'', published in several volumes in the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Winston Churchill]] wrote that he felt that after Hitler's ascension to power, no other book than ''Mein Kampf'' deserved more intensive scrutiny.&lt;ref name="ChurchillTheSecondWorldWar"&gt;''Winston Churchill: The Second World War''. Volume 1, Houghton Mifflin Books 1986, S. 50. "Here was the new Koran of faith and war: turgid, verbose, shapeless, but pregnant with its message."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later analysis==
The critic [[George Steiner]] has suggested that ''Mein Kampf'' can be seen as one of several books that resulted from the crisis of German culture following Germany's defeat in [[World War I]], comparable in this respect to the philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]]'s ''The Spirit of Utopia'' (1918), the historian [[Oswald Spengler]]'s ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' (1918), the theologian [[Franz Rosenzweig]]'s ''The Star of Redemption'' (1921), and the theologian [[Karl Barth]]'s ''[[The Epistle to the Romans (Barth)|The Epistle to the Romans]]'' (1922).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Steiner, George |title=Martin Heidegger |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1991 |pages=vii-viii |isbn=0-226-77232-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==German publication history==
While Hitler was in power (1933–1945), ''Mein Kampf'' came to be available in three common editions. The first, the ''Volksausgabe'' or People's Edition, featured the original cover on the dust jacket and was navy blue underneath with a gold [[swastika]] eagle embossed on the cover. The ''Hochzeitsausgabe'', or Wedding Edition, in a slipcase with the seal of the province embossed in gold onto a parchment-like cover was given free to marrying couples. In 1940, the ''Tornister-Ausgabe'', or Knapsack Edition, was released. This edition was a compact, but unabridged, version in a red cover and was released by the post office, available to be sent to loved ones fighting at the front. These three editions combined both volumes into the same book.

A special edition was published in 1939 in honour of Hitler's 50th birthday. This edition was known as the ''Jubiläumsausgabe'', or Anniversary Issue. It came in both dark blue and bright red boards with a gold sword on the cover. This work contained both volumes one and two. It was considered a deluxe version, relative to the smaller and more common ''Volksausgabe''.

The book could also be purchased as a two-volume set during Hitler's rule, and was available in soft cover and hardcover. The soft cover edition contained the original cover (as pictured at the top of this article). The hardcover edition had a leather spine with cloth-covered boards. The cover and spine contained an image of three brown oak leaves.

==English translations==
===Dugdale abridgement===
The first English translation was an abridgement by [[Edgar Dugdale]] who started work on it in 1931, at the prompting of his wife, Blanche. When he learned that the London publishing firm of [[Hurst &amp; Blackett]] had secured the rights to publish an abridgement in the United Kingdom, he offered it for free in April 1933. However, a local Nazi Party representative insisted that the translation be further abridged before publication, so it was held back until 13 October 1933, although excerpts were allowed to run in ''[[The Times]]'' in late July. It was published by Hurst &amp; Blackett as part of "The Paternoster Library".

In America, [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] secured the rights to the Dugdale abridgement on 29 July 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lankiewicz |first1=Donald |title=MEIN KAMPF in America: How Adolf Hitler Came to Be Published in the United States |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308733730_MEIN_KAMPF_in_America_How_Adolf_Hitler_Came_to_Be_Published_in_the_United_States |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only differences between the American and British versions are that the title was translated ''My Struggle'' in the UK and ''My Battle'' in America; and that Dugdale is credited as translator in the US edition, while the British version withheld his name. Both Dugdale and his wife were active in the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement; Blanche was the niece of [[Arthur Balfour|Lord Balfour]], and they wished to avoid publicity.

===Reynal and Hitchcock translation===
Houghton and Mifflin licensed [[Reynal &amp; Hitchcock]] the rights to publish a full unexpurgated translation in 1938. The book was translated from the two volumes of the first German edition (1925 and 1927), with notations appended noting any changes made in later editions, which were deemed "not as extensive as popularly supposed."&lt;ref name=RandHIntro8&gt;"Introduction," ''Mein Kampf''. New York: Reynal and Hitchcock, 1940; pg. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; The translation, made by a committee from the [[New School for Social Research]] headed by Alvin Johnson,&lt;ref&gt;Prefatory Note, ''Mein Kampf.'' New York: Reynal and Hitchcock, 1940; pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; was said to have been made with a view to readability rather than in an effort to rigidly reproduce Hitler's sometimes idiosyncratic German form.&lt;ref name=RandHIntro8 /&gt;

The text was heavily annotated for an American audience with biographical and historical details derived largely from German sources.&lt;ref name=RandHIntro8 /&gt; As the translators deemed the book "a propagandistic essay of a violent partisan", which "often warps historical truth and sometimes ignores it completely," the tone of many of these annotations reflected a conscious attempt to provide "factual information that constitutes an extensive critique of the original."&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to Reynal and Hitchcock edition, pg. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; The book appeared for sale on 28 February 1939.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Murphy translation===
One of the earlier complete English translations of ''Mein Kampf'' was by [[James Vincent Murphy|James Murphy]] in 1939. It was the only English translation approved by Nazi Germany. The version published by Hutchison &amp; Co. in association with Hurst &amp; Blackett, Ltd (London) in 1939 of the combined volumes I and II is profusely illustrated with many full page drawings and photographs. The opening line, "It has turned out fortunate for me to-day that [[destiny]] appointed [[Braunau am Inn|Braunau-on-the-Inn]] to be my birthplace," is characteristic of Hitler's sense of destiny that began to develop in the early 1920s. Hurst &amp; Blackett ceased publishing the Murphy translation in 1942 when the original plates were destroyed by German bombing, but it is still published and available in facsimile editions and also on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greatwar.nl/books/meinkampf/meinkampf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stackpole translation and controversy===
The small Pennsylvania firm of Stackpole and Sons released its own unexpurgated translation by [[William Soskin]] on the same day as [[Houghton Mifflin]], amid much legal wrangling. The [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled in Houghton Mifflin's favour that June and ordered Stackpole to stop selling their version,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, ''Houghton Mifflin Co. v. Stackpole Sons, Inc., et al.'', 104 Fed.2d 306 (1939); Note, 49 Yale L.J. 132 (1939).&lt;/ref&gt; but litigation followed for a few more years until the case was finally resolved in September 1941.

Among other things, Stackpole argued that Hitler could not have legally transferred his right to a copyright in the United States to Eher Verlag in 1925, because he was not a citizen of any country. ''Houghton Mifflin v. Stackpole'' was a minor landmark in American [[copyright law]], definitively establishing that [[stateless persons]] have the same copyright status in the United States that any other foreigner would.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/1939410104F2d306_1309/HOUGHTON%20MIFFLIN%20CO.%20v.%20STACKPOLE%20SONS,%20INC.|title=HOUGHTON MIFFLIN CO. v. STACKPOLE SONS, INC.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compilerpress.ca/CW/Library/Kampleman%20US%20&amp;%20International%20Copyright%20AJIL%201947.htm|title=Kampleman US &amp; International Copyright 1947|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the three months that Stackpole's version was available it sold 12,000 copies.

===Cranston translation and controversy===
Houghton Mifflin's abridged English translation left out some of Hitler's more antisemitic and militaristic statements. This motivated [[Alan Cranston]], an American reporter for [[United Press International]] in Germany (and later a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from California), to publish his own abridged and annotated translation. Cranston believed this version more accurately reflected the contents of the book and Hitler's intentions. In 1939, Cranston was sued by Hitler's publisher for [[copyright infringement]], and a Connecticut judge ruled in Hitler's favour. By the time the publication of Cranston's version was stopped, 500,000 copies had already been sold.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Today, the profits and proceeds are given to various charities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/10/mein_royalties.php/ Mein Royalties] Cabinet Magazine Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manheim translation===
[[Houghton Mifflin]] published a translation by [[Ralph Manheim]] in 1943. They did this to avoid having to share their profits with Reynal &amp; Hitchcock, and to increase sales by offering a more readable translation. The Manheim translation was first published in the United Kingdom by Hurst &amp; Blackett in 1969 amid some controversy.

===Official Nazi translation===
A previously unknown English translation was released in 2008, which had been prepared by the official Nazi printing office, the Franz Eher Verlag. In 1939, the [[Nazi propaganda]] ministry hired [[James Vincent Murphy|James Murphy]] to create an English version of ''Mein Kampf'', which they hoped to use to promote Nazi goals in English-speaking countries. While Murphy was in Germany, he became less enchanted with Nazi ideology and made some statements that the Propaganda Ministry disliked. As a result, they asked him to leave Germany immediately. He was not able to take any of his notes but later sent his wife back to obtain his partial translation.&lt;ref name="murphwife"&gt;Hitler's Mein Kampf in Britain and America: A Publishing History 1930–39; Barnes, James J.; Patience P.

There were three separate printings from August 1938 to March 1939, totaling 14,000; sales totals by 31 March 1939 were 10,345.

The Murphy and Houghton Mifflin translations were the only ones published by the authorised publishers while Hitler was still alive, and not at war with the U.K. and the U.S.

There was some resistance from Eher Verlag to Hurst and Blackett's Murphy translation, as they had not been granted the rights to a full translation. However, they allowed it ''de facto'' permission by not lodging a formal protest, and on 5 May 1939, even inquired about royalties. The British publishers responded on the 12th that the information they requested was "not yet available" and the point would be moot within a few months, on 3 September 1939, when all royalties were halted due to the state of war existing between Britain and Germany.

Royalties were likewise held up in the United States due to the litigation between Houghton Mifflin and Stackpole. Because the matter was only settled in September 1941, only a few months before a state of war existed between Germany and the U.S., all Eher Verlag ever got was a $2,500 advance from Reynal and Hitchcock. It got none from the unauthorised Stackpole edition or the 1943 Manheim edition.

==Current availability==
At the time of his suicide, Hitler's official place of residence was in [[Munich]], which led to his entire estate, including all rights to ''Mein Kampf'', changing to the ownership of the state of [[Bavaria]]. The government of Bavaria, in agreement with the federal government of Germany, refused to allow any copying or printing of the book in Germany. It also opposed copying and printing in other countries, but with less success. As per German [[copyright]] law, the entire text entered the [[public domain]] on 1 January 2016, 70 years after the author's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/urhg/__64.html § 64 Allgemeines], German Copyright Law. The copyright has been relinquished for the Dutch and Swedish editions and some English ones (though not in the U.S., see below).&lt;/ref&gt;

Owning and buying the book in Germany is not an offence. Trading in old copies is lawful as well, unless it is done in such a fashion as to "promote hatred or war." In particular, the unmodified edition is not covered by §86 [[StGB]] that forbids dissemination of means of propaganda of unconstitutional organisations, since it is a "pre-constitutional work" and as such cannot be opposed to the free and democratic basic order, according to a 1979 decision of the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Judgement of 25 July 1979 – 3 StR 182/79 (S); BGHSt 29, 73 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Most German libraries carry heavily commented and excerpted versions of ''Mein Kampf.'' In 2008, Stephan Kramer, secretary-general of the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]], not only recommended lifting the ban, but volunteered the help of his organization in editing and annotating the text, saying that it is time for the book to be made available to all online.&lt;ref&gt;"Jewish Leader Urges Book Ban End", ''Dateline World Jewry'', [[World Jewish Congress]], July/August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of restrictions or special circumstances apply in other countries.

===India===
Since its first publication in India in 1928, ''Mein Kampf'' has gone through hundreds of editions and sold over 100,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jungle-world.com/artikel/2013/33/48296.html|title=Archiv – 33/2013 – Dschungel – Über die Wahrnehmung von Faschismus und Nationalsozialismus in Indien|website=Jungle-world.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/mein-kampf-sales-india/|title=Hitler's "Mein Kampf" on India's best sellers list|website=RT.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
In the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], ''Mein Kampf'' has been published at least three times since 1992; the Russian text is also available on websites. In 2006 the [[Public Chamber of Russia]] proposed banning the book. In 2009 St. Petersburg's branch of the [[Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs]] requested to remove an annotated and hyper-linked Russian translation of the book from a historiography website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsru.com/russia/08jul2009/hrono.html A well-known historiography web site shut down over publishing Hitler's book], [[Newsru.com]], 8 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrono.info/libris/lib_g/meinkampf00.html|title=Моя борьба |accessdate=8 July 2009|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hitler, annotated and hyper-linked ed. by Vyacheslav Rumyantsev, archived from the [http://www.hrono.info/libris/lib_g/meinkampf00.html original] 12 February 2008; an [http://www.hrono.ru/dokum/192_dok/mein_kampf.html abridged version] remained intact.&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 April 2010, it was announced that ''Mein Kampf'' is outlawed on grounds of extremism promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/mein-kampf-banned-russia |title=Radio Netherlands Worldwide |access-date=27 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607053633/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/mein-kampf-banned-russia |archive-date=7 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
''Mein Kampf'' has been reprinted several times since 1945; in 1970, 1992, 2002 and 2010. In 1992 the Government of Bavaria tried to stop the publication of the book, and the case went to the [[Supreme Court of Sweden]] which ruled in favour of the publisher, stating that the book is protected by copyright, but that the copyright holder is unidentified (and not the [[State of Bavaria]]) and that the original Swedish publisher from 1934 had gone out of business. It therefore refused the Government of Bavaria's claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hagglundsforlag.se/forfattaredok/Hitler/Pressmed0324.htm|title=Hägglunds förlag|website=Hagglundsforlag.se|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331194349/http://www.hagglundsforlag.se/forfattaredok/Hitler/Pressmed0324.htm|archivedate=31 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The only translation changes came in the 1970 edition, but they were only linguistic, based on a new Swedish standard.

===Turkey===
''Mein Kampf'' was widely available and growing in popularity in [[Turkey]], even to the point where it became a bestseller, selling up to 100,000 copies in just two months in 2005. Analysts and commentators believe the popularity of the book to be related to a rise in nationalism and anti-U.S. sentiment.

===Online availability===
In 1999, the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] documented that major Internet booksellers such as [[Amazon.com]] and [[Barnes &amp; Noble|Barnesandnoble.com]] sell ''Mein Kampf'' to Germany. After a public outcry, both companies agreed to stop those sales to addresses in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BEYETTE|first=BEVERLY|title=Is hate for sale?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/05/news/cl-50757|newspaper=LA Times|date=5 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is currently available through both companies online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mein-Kampf-Adolf-Hitler/dp/0395925037/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404827908&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=0395925037|title=Mein Kampf: Adolf Hitler, Ralph Manheim: 9780395925034: Amazon.com: Books|work=amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/mein-kampf-adolf-hitler/1103285065?ean=9781480135581|title=Mein Kampf|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also available in various languages, including German, at the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/search.php?query=MEIN%20KAMPF%20AND%20mediatype%3Atexts|title=Internet Archive Search: MEIN KAMPF|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Murphy translation of the book is freely available on [[Project Gutenberg Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200601.txt|title=Mein Kampf - Project Gutenberg Australia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the January 2016 republication of the book in Germany, the book can be ordered at Amazon's German website.&lt;ref name="nyt-eddy" /&gt;

===2016 republication in Germany===
On 3 February 2010, the [[Institut für Zeitgeschichte|Institute of Contemporary History]] (IfZ) in Munich announced plans to republish an annotated version of the text, for educational purposes in schools and universities, in 2015, when the copyright currently held by the [[Bavaria]]n state government expires (2016). The book had last been published in Germany in 1945. A group of German historians argued that a republication was necessary to get an authoritative annotated edition by the time the copyright runs out, which might open the way for [[neo-Nazi]] groups to publish their own versions. "Once Bavaria's copyright expires, there is the danger of charlatans and neo-Nazis appropriating this infamous book for themselves," Wolfgang Heubisch said. The Bavarian government opposed the plan, citing respect for victims of the [[Holocaust]]. Its Finance Ministry said that permits for reprints would not be issued, at home or abroad. This would also apply to a new annotated edition. The republished book might be banned as Nazi propaganda. Even after expiration of the copyright, the Bavarian government emphasised that "the dissemination of Nazi ideologies will remain prohibited in Germany and is punishable under the penal code".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/mein-kampf-to-see-its-first-postwwii-publication-in-germany-1891347.html |title='Mein Kampf' to see its first post-WWII publication in Germany |date=6 February 2010 |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212000803/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/mein-kampf-to-see-its-first-postwwii-publication-in-germany-1891347.html |archivedate=12 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Associated Press]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/02/05/world/AP-EU-Germany-Mein-Kampf.html |title=Historians Hope to Publish 'Mein Kampf' in Germany |date=5 February 2010 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Kulish |date=4 February 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/05/world/europe/05germany.html |title=Rebuffing Scholars, Germany Vows to Keep Hitler Out of Print |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Nancy |last1=Isenson |author2=[[Reuters]] |date=4 February 2010 |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5216209,00.html |title=German institute seeks to reprint Hitler's 'Mein Kampf' |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,676019,00.html |title=The Kampf for 'Mein Kampf': Annotated Version of Hitler Polemic in the Works |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 December 2013 the Bavarian government cancelled its financial support for an annotated edition. The Institute of Contemporary History (IfZ) in Munich, which is preparing the translation, announced that it intended to proceed with publication after the copyright expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25346140 | work=BBC News | title=Bavaria abandons plans for new edition of Mein Kampf | date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IfZ scheduled an edition of ''Mein Kampf'' for release in 2016.&lt;ref name=rt-Anti-Hitler&gt;{{cite web |last1=Logwin|first1=Pierre |title='Anti-Hitler' Mein Kampf?

Richard Verber, vice-president of the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]], stated in 2015 that the board trusted the academic and educational value of republishing. “We would, of course, be very wary of any attempt to glorify Hitler or to belittle the Holocaust in any way,” Verber declared to ''[[The Observer]]''. “But this is not that. I do understand how some Jewish groups could be upset and nervous, but it seems it is being done from a historical point of view and to put it in context.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/26/hitler-main-kampf-wary-welcome-british-jews|title=British Jews give wary approval to the return of Hitler’s Mein Kampf|author=Vanessa Thorpe|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An annotated edition of ''Mein Kampf'' was published in Germany in January 2016 and sold out within hours on Amazon's German site.&lt;ref name="nyt-eddy"&gt;{{cite web |title='Mein Kampf,' Hitler's Manifesto, Returns to German Shelves |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/09/world/europe/mein-kampf-hitler-germany.html |last=Eddy |first=Melissa |website=The New York Times |date=2016-01-08 |accessdate=2016-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's publication led to public debate in Germany, and divided reactions from Jewish groups, with some supporting, and others opposing, the decision to publish.&lt;ref name="Guardian2016"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/08/copies-of-hitlers-mein-kampf-go-on-sale-in-germany-for-first-time-in-70-years |title=High demand for reprint of Hitler's Mein Kampf takes publisher by surprise |author= |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; German officials had previously said they would limit public access to the text amid fears that its republication could stir neo-Nazi sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35209185|title=Copyright of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf expires|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bookstores stated that they would not stock the book.

==Sequel==
{{Main article|Zweites Buch}}
After the party's poor showing in the 1928 elections, Hitler believed that the reason for his loss was the public's misunderstanding of his ideas. He then retired to Munich to dictate a sequel to ''Mein Kampf'' to expand on its ideas, with more focus on foreign policy.

Only two copies of the 200-page manuscript were originally made, and only one of these was ever made public. The document was neither edited nor published during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]] and remains known as ''[[Zweites Buch]]'', or "Second Book". To keep the document strictly secret, in 1935 Hitler ordered that it be placed in a safe in an air raid shelter. It remained there until being discovered by an American officer in 1945.

The authenticity of the document found in 1945 has been verified by Josef Berg, a former employee of the Nazi publishing house Eher Verlag, and [[Telford Taylor]], a former brigadier general of the United States Army Reserve and Chief Counsel at the Nuremberg war-crimes trials.

In 1958, the ''Zweites Buch'' was found in the archives of the United States by American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]]. Unable to find an American publisher, Weinberg turned to his mentor – [[Hans Rothfels]] at the Institute of Contemporary History in Munich, and his associate [[Martin Broszat]] – who published ''Zweites Buch'' in 1961. A pirated edition was published in English in New York in 1962. The first authoritative English edition was not published until 2003 (''[[Zweites Buch|Hitler's Second Book: The Unpublished Sequel to Mein Kampf]],'' {{ISBN|1-929631-16-2}}).

'''María del Carmen''' "'''Menchu'''" '''Álvarez del Valle''' (born 16 January 1928) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] radio journalist and paternal grandmother of the Queen of Spain, [[Queen Letizia of Spain|Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano]].

==Biography==
Considered one of the most popular voices of [[Asturias|Asturian]] radio, Menchu Álvarez del Valle has two sisters: Flora (born 1921) and María Sol, "Marisol del Valle" (born 1935), Doctor of the [[Complutense University of Madrid]] and also a radio journalist and audiovisual communication teacher. Her mother was named Plácida del Valle Arribas (1900–1993), and her father, Eulalio Álvarez de la Fuente (1897–1983), was a typographer and editor.

She was born in [[Santander, Spain|Santander]], and has lived in [[Oviedo]] since age 16. She has worked in radio since she was very young, starting with Radio Asturias. In 1947 she joined Radio Oviedo (later REM), followed by La Voz del Principado, {{ill|Radiocadena Española|es}}, and finally [[Radio Nacional de España]]. For 42 years she was a successful announcer, as well as creator of new radio shows such as  ''Coser y cantar'' and ''Rumbo a la gloria''. She retired in 1990.

'''''Nine Kinds of Naked''''' is [[Tony Vigorito]]'s second novel. Published in 2008 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nine Kinds of Naked|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qCuQohmSpUYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nine+Kinds+of+Naked&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sBXuUPiyMej62AXO94CACg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA|work=Google Books|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the major themes of the book revolve around the Jungian concept of [[synchronicity]], [[chaos theory]], and the [[Butterfly Effect]].  [[Tornadoes]] and [[hurricanes]], representative of chaos, propel the storyline across its twelve centuries.

== Plot introduction ==

Vigorito wrote this book as an experiment in literary synchronicity, starting with the title and inventing the entire story day by day according to the synchronicities of his daily experience.  What emerged was an exploration of the Butterfly Effect, as what initially appears to be a chaotic storyline eventually relents into a tightly-interconnected series of events linked across time, space, and meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kern|first=Amber|title=Nine Kinds of Naked|newspaper=Austin Monthly|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salamon|first=Jeff|title=The invisible texture of everyday life: An interview with Tony Vigorito|newspaper=The Austin-American Statesman|date=October 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters and plot summary==

'''Diablo''' is serving a brief jail term in [[Normal, Illinois]].  One day, he happens to idly toss a playing card—the Joker—across his cell.  From the scarce draft of the spinning card, a powerful tornado eventually forms that touches the lives of all the major characters, intersecting their lives in synchronistic fashion.

'''Billy''', the guard who released Diablo from jail, gave a ride to Diablo, who was hitchhiking outside the jail.  Caught in the same tornado, Billy is torn from the driver's seat and tossed into the sky.  Five years later, just after quitting a job, Diablo almost runs Billy down with his car.  Billy now calls himself '''Billy Pronto''' and insists that he can only speak in the present tense.

'''Special Agent J.J. Speed''' is a CIA agent and a former priest who changed his life after the tornado struck the Church in Normal, Illinois, at which he was conducting Mass.  The tornado stripped him of his priestly vestments (along with the clothing of everyone else in the congregation) and sent them sailing into the sky.  Twenty years later, stuck in a dead-end assignment in [[Playa del Carmen]], Mexico, he happens across his priestly scarf—definitive as it was embroidered with his initials—being sold by a street vendor.  He is shortly reassigned to [[New Orleans]].

'''Elizabeth Wildhack''' is a dropout philosopher and a New Orleans stripper.  She is the daughter of '''Bridget Snapdragon''', who gave birth to her during the tornado that struck the Church in Normal, Illinois, just before her body disappeared into the sky.  Elizabeth eventually meets Diablo, who has been selling seashell pipes on [[Bourbon Street]] for the last fifteen years, ever since he quit his job and Billy Pronto began haunting him.

A year prior to their meeting, and two days after a thermonuclear bomb test in the [[Rub al-Khali]], an overnight [[hypercane]] formed in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  New Orleans, still raw from [[Hurricane Katrina]] years back, flees its path, but the world is soon startled to discover that this anomalous hypercane is not moving, taking up an apparently stable position in the Gulf.  This hypercane is the latest incarnation of the tornado initially spun from Diablo’s playing card, which had been a dust devil in the Rub al-Khali gradually dissipating into nothing before the thermonuclear explosion caused it to grow in strength.

Woven throughout the larger story is '''Clovis''', runaway serf from the 9th century who stumbles upon the mythical [[Golden Bough]], a scene which Bridget Snapdragon happened to paint on the kitchen wall while pregnant with Elizabeth.  Possessed of the Golden Bough, Clovis is thereby granted solitary access to the underworld - the world beneath the illusions of time and meaning.  Existing outside of time, he aspects the [[trickster]], and amuses himself by orchestrating tremendous coincidences.

== Critical reception ==

Nine Kinds of Naked met with generally favorable reviews, with ''The Sacramento Book Review'' calling it "part quirky love story, part philosophical manifesto, and part metaphysical mystery...",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Strong|first=Sunshine|title=Nine Kinds of Naked|url=http://www.1776productions.com/SBR_October_08.pdf|work=Sacramento Book Review|accessdate=October 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008061622/http://www.1776productions.com/SBR_October_08.pdf|archivedate=2011-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Chicago Sun-Times'' calling it "startlingly original,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Champion|first=Edward|title=Linguistic Gymnastics Abound in "Naked'|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|date=November 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Texas Monthly'' calling it "a crisp, sardonic voice,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shea|first=Mike|title=Nine Kinds of Naked|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/preview/2008-10-01/bookrev3|accessdate=10 January 2013|newspaper=Texas Monthly|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Daily Texan'' calling it "a lyrical adventure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinez|first=Andres|title=Austin writer's novel combines lyrical prose with a surreal plot|newspaper=The Daily Texan|date=October 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Publisher's Weekly'', however, observed that "the book’s time shifts, innumerable eccentricities, chaotic narrative and 400 pages are enough to wear a reader out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nine Kinds of Naked|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-15-603123-3|accessdate=10 January 2013|newspaper=Publisher's Weekly|date=August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trivia ==

This story takes place in the same fictional universe as Tony Vigorito's first novel, ''[[Just a Couple of Days]]''.  This is evidenced by intersecting scenes involving T-shirts displaying the message "Argue Naked."

'''''October Sky ''''' (the title on the mass market movie tie-in version of the best-selling '''''The Rocket Boys''''') is the first [[memoir]] in a series of four, by [[Homer Hickam|Homer Hickam Jr.]] It is a story of growing up in a mining town, and a boy's pursuit of [[amateur rocketry]] in a coal mining town. It won the W.D. Weatherford Award in 1998, the year of its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.berea.edu/appalachiancenter/weatherford/pastwinners.asp | title = Weatherford Award | accessdate = August 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is one of the most often picked community/library reads in the United States. It is also studied in many school systems around the world. ''October Sky'' was followed by ''[[The Coalwood Way]]'' (2000), ''[[Sky of Stone]]'' (2002), and ''[[Carrying Albert Home]]'' (2015).

''Rocket Boys'' was made into a film in 1999, titled ''[[October Sky]]'' (an [[anagram]] of "Rocket Boys"). The book was then re-published as ''October Sky'' shortly afterwards.

== Plot summary ==
Homer "Sonny" Hickam Jr. lives in a small coal mining town in [[West Virginia]] named [[Coalwood, West Virginia|Coalwood]]. Sonny, after seeing the Russian satellite [[Sputnik]], decides to join the American team of rocket engineers called the Missile Agency when he graduates from school. (Note: In the book ''Rocket Boys'', the main character is always called Sonny. In the movie ''October Sky'', he is called Homer.) Sonny's older brother, Jim Hickam, excels at football and expects to get a college football scholarship. Sonny, however, is terrible at sports and has no special skill that would get him "out of Coalwood". Sonny's mother is afraid that he will have to work in the mines after high school.	
Sonny's first attempt at rocketry (which occurred when he was 14) consists of a flashlight tube and model airplane body as a casing.  It is fueled by flash powder from old cherry bombs. It explodes violently, destroying his mother's fence. After that, Sonny enlists the help of [[Quentin Wilson (engineer)|Quentin Wilson]], [[Roy Lee Cooke]], Sherman Siers, Jimmy "O'Dell" Carroll, and Billy Rose to help build rockets while forming the BCMA ([[Big Creek Missile Agency]]). Their first real rocket, powered by [[black powder]], is named Auk 1. This an allusion to the [[great auk]], which is a flightless seabird that became [[extinction|extinct]] in the mid-19th century. Auk 1 flies six feet before the solder melts, and the nozzle, a washer, separates from the casement. They call themselves "Rocket Boys" and call the place where they are launching their rockets "Cape Coalwood", in honor of [[Cape Canaveral]].	
The Rocket Boys enjoy mixed success during their three-year rocket launching campaign (1957 to 1960). They employ several fuel mixtures including [[rocket candy]] and a mixture called "zincoshine", which is composed of zinc dust and sulfur, along with alcohol from [[moonshine]], supplied by a local [[Rum-running|bootlegger]], as a binder for the mixture. They launch a total of 35 rockets, all sequentially numbered Auk I–XXXI. (There are five different Auk XXIIs.) 	
They also win a [[Science fair|National Science Fair]] gold medal for their rockets, for their project titled "A Study of Amateur Rocketry Techniques."

== Characters ==

* '''[[Homer Hickam|Homer "Sonny" Hickam Jr.]]''' is the author and narrator of the memoir. He is 8 years old at the beginning of the story but is in high school for most of the book, and he serves as the leader of the Rocket Boys. He is nearsighted and wears glasses, and he plays in the school band.	
* '''Elsie Hickam''' is Homer Hickam's wife and the mother of Jim and "Sonny" Hickam. She has a tense relationship with her husband through most of the story. She is supportive of Sonny's rocket building, and often finds herself at odds with her husband, Homer Sr., about the rocket building. She often tells Sonny, "Don't blow yourself up." She works on a mural of [[Myrtle Beach]] throughout the memoir.	
* '''Homer Hickam Sr.''' is Elsie Hickam's husband and the father of Jim and "Sonny" Hickam. He is the hard-headed mine foreman in Coalwood. He takes his job very seriously, going out of his way to help miners in distress. He is almost always at odds with the union leader, John Dubonnet, who dated Elsie when they were all in high school together. Homer Sr. seems to not care about Sonny's affairs as much as he does Jim's; Sonny points this out in the book much to Homer Sr.'s chagrin. He has a spot on his lung that is the common miner's disease, black lung ([[Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis]]), but refuses to quit work, although most men who are discovered to have this illness are forced into retirement, but allowed to stay in Coalwood.	
* '''Jim Hickam''' is Homer Hickam Jr.'s older brother and the son of Elsie and Homer Hickam. He is a star athlete, which leads to him having several conflicts with "Sonny" over how Homer seems to favor Jim over "Sonny". He dates the girl Sonny is in love with, Dorothy Plunk, but later dumps her like he does with many of his girlfriends.	
* '''[[Quentin Wilson (engineer)|Quentin Wilson]]''' is one of the more intelligent members of the Rocket Boys, the one who does the most math. Quentin carries a suitcase stuffed with books wherever he goes and finds excuses to get out of gym class. He is excitable and often confounds the other members and townspeople with his advanced vocabulary.	
* '''Jimmy "O'Dell" Carroll''' is small and excitable, the most emotional member of the group. His father drives the town garbage truck, allowing O'Dell access to many useful items, frequently scrounged to further the group's efforts. He is always scheming of ways of making money, from the failed iron scrap attempt—which took an entire summer, yielded a net loss of one dollar, not counting the destruction of borrowed equipment and almost killing Sonny—to the profitable harvesting of [[ginseng]].	
* '''Sherman Siers''' has a weakened left leg as a result of polio, but does not let it slow him down. He is also the most observant and practical member of the team. At the age of twenty-six, Sherman died unexpectedly of a heart attack.	
* '''[[Roy Lee Cooke]]''' is Sonny's best friend. He teaches Sonny something about girls. In the follow-up memoir titled ''The Coalwood Way'', it is revealed that he is known as The Big Creek Lovemaster. Roy Lee also knows the moonshiner in town, John Eye, who provides the boys with the alcohol needed for their special propellant they call Zincoshine. On page 302, Roy Lee states that if they were successful in flying the rocket, "She wouldn't be able to get out of her panties fast enough," (referring to a cheerleader)
* '''Willie "Billy" Rose''' is a member of the Rocket Boys who joins the group about a year after it is founded. He has excellent eyesight and can find rockets very well. He is the best runner in the group.	
* '''[[Freida J. Riley|Miss Riley]]''' is a chemistry and physics teacher at Big Creek High School who inspires the Rocket Boys to compete in the National Science Fair. She gives Sonny a book called ''[[Principles of Guided Missile Design]]'' that is extremely useful to the Rocket Boys in the future. She also orchestrates the Rocket Boys' entry into the National Science Fair. She is diagnosed with [[Hodgkin's Lymphoma]] shortly before Sonny leaves for the science fair. At first her affliction goes into remission, but later she dies of her disease.	
* '''Jake Mosby''' is a womanizing alcoholic who helps the BCMA in paying off debts. Jake is a mining engineer. He also introduces them to a writer of a small newspaper, Basil Oglethorpe. He later settles down a bit and starts dating Miss Riley for a period of time, trying to be dependable for her. He is a veteran of the [[Korean War]], and compares the BCMA's rocket launches to his war experiences.	
* '''Basil Oglethorpe''' is the writer of a small newspaper called the ''[[McDowell County Banner]]''. He is in charge of the BCMA's publicity.	
* '''Mr. Ferro''' is in charge of a group of company machinists who help the BCMA build their rockets.	
* '''Mr. Caton''' is a machinist in Mr. Ferro's team. He is the main builder of the BCMA's rockets.	
* '''Dorothy Plunk''' is Sonny's dream girl; he even describes her as "God's Perfection" at one point in the memoir. While Sonny spends most of his time infatuated with her, although she still spends time with him, Dorothy only wants a friend relationship and goes out with other boys. For a large section of the book, Sonny ignores her, because she started a relationship with his brother Jim. She was also the valedictorian of Sonny's graduating high school class and got the spot Sonny wanted in a calculus class because her grades were higher.
* '''Valentine Carmina''' is an older girl who likes Sonny. Ultimately, it is implied she has sex with him in the backseat of a car on the same night Dorothy breaks his heart.  Homer later describes the event as her pity to him.	
* '''Mr. Isaac Bykovski''' is a worker in the mine who helps Sonny with his first rockets. Homer Sr. makes him work in the mine as punishment for helping Sonny. Later, Homer Sr. offers him his job back in the machine shop, but Bykovski does not accept the offer because he made more money in the mine. He is later killed in a mine collapse while operating a loader.	
* '''Geneva Eggers''' is a middle-aged woman who was rescued as a baby by Homer Hickam Sr. when her house was on fire. The rest of her family was still in the house when it went up in flames but she was the only one whom Homer Sr. saw. Everyone else in her family perished. It is implied that after the fire, she turned to prostitution in order to support herself. During the novel, she invites Sonny into her home when he almost freezes to death on a December night and gives him a new set of clothes. Sonny feels uncomfortable changing in front of her and, sensing the hesitation, she replies, "Oh, come on. You ain't gonna show me nothin' I ain't already seen too many times."
* '''Buchanan "Buck" Trant ''' is a football player who hates Sonny. He insults Sonny and even starts to tear down "[[Cape Coalwood]]."

'''Organizational space''' describes the influence of the spatial environment on the [[health]], the [[mind]], and the [[behavior]] of humans in and around [[organizations]]. It is an area of scientific research in which [[interdisciplinarity]] is a central perspective. It draws from [[management]], [[organization]] and [[architecture]] (Dale and [[Gibson Burrell|Burrell]], 2008) added with knowledge from, for instance, [[environmental psychology]] (Evans and Mitchell, 1998), [[social medicine]] (Macintyre et al., 2002), or [[spatial science]] (Festinger et al., 1950). In essence, it may be regarded as a special field of expertise of [[organization studies]] and [[change management (people)|change management]] applied to architecture. The knowledge area is related to [[evidence-based design]] in which the influence of the spatial environment on patient's [[health]], [[healing]], and [[customer satisfaction]] are being researched in [[health care]]. It is also related to practice-based areas of management such as [[facility management]] which is primarily devoted to the maintenance and care of commercial or institutional buildings and to [[property management]] in which the operation of [[real estate]] is central. Sometimes it is also referred to as [[organizational architecture]]. The scientific field of organizational space must be distinguished from [[social architecture]] in which the development of [[information and communication technologies]] is central and also different from [[space science]] which is concerned with the study of the [[universe]].

== Spatial, physical and built environment ==
This research strand distinguishes three different [[Environment (systems)|environments]]: the spatial environment from the [[physical environment]] and the [[built environment]]. 
* Spatial environment: the total context in which [[human]]s in and around [[organization]]s function.
* Physical environment: all [[Tangible property|tangible]] physical [[Entity|entities]] in and around organizations.
* Built environment: that what is commonly understood as [[architecture]] and that what is permanently fixed to it.

== Organizational-spatial cycle of change ==
The coherence between the organization and its spatial environment may be regarded as an interwoven [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] cyclical [[flux]] from contingencies, intermediates, performances to interventions (Mobach, 2009). The [[Contingency theory|contingencies]] are the [[organizations|organizational]], [[architecture|architectural]], [[Technology|technological]], and [[Natural environment|natural]] conditions under which organization function. In the end they influence the performance of an organization, but first they mix in the [[Mediation (statistics)|intermediates]]. In this way humans in and around organizations will, for instance, notice these contingencies and will give them meaning (Clegg and Kornberger, 2006; Van Marrewijk and Yanow, 2010). Moreover, the contingencies will also influence [[social network|social contact]] (Becker, 1981; Steele, 1973) and the degree to which a spatial environment can be functional (Sharles, 1923). Subsequently, the intermediates influence different [[Performance management|performances]], for instance, the [[health]], the [[mind]], and the [[behavior]] of people in and around [[organizations]]. The spatial environment can cause [[illness]], such as with the [[sick building syndrome]] (EPA, 1991), but it can also positively influence the vitality of people or the recovery after an operation (Ulrich, 1984). The performances can provoke managerial intervention. In turn, these interventions will change the contingencies, and by doing so, change the elements, relations, and properties of the conditions under which people function.

Designed by Percy Thomas Partnership.&lt;br /&gt;Built 2002–4.]]'''Percy Thomas Partnership''' was the trading name of the award-winning British [[architectural]] practice established some time between 1965 and 1973 as the successor to a series of earlier partnerships originally set up by [[Percy Thomas]] (1883–1969) in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]] in 1911/12. Percy Thomas and the Percy Thomas Partnership put their name to a number of landmark buildings in the United Kingdom including the [[Wales Millennium Centre]], Cardiff. It opened offices overseas and completed a number of prestigious buildings in Hong Kong. 

Percy Thomas Partnership came to an end in 2004 when they went into [[Administration (law)|administration]] and were bought by [[Capita Group]].

==History==

[[File:Clifton, Catholic cathedral church of Ss. Peter and Paul - geograph.org.uk - 854098.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Clifton Cathedral, Bristol. Designed by Percy Thomas Partnership. Built 1970–73.]]
[[Percy Thomas|Percy Edward Thomas]] was born in the [[North East England|northeast of England]] in 1883, but was well-travelled and started work as at a young age in Cardiff, Wales.&lt;ref name="NLW Biog"&gt;National Library of Wales ''Dictionary of Welsh Biography'' [http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-THOM-EDW-1883.html?query=percy+thomas&amp;field=content THOMAS, Sir PERCY EDWARD (1883–1969)] retrieved 2011-10-14&lt;/ref&gt; He was articled to study architecture, and won the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] architecture competition in 1903.&lt;ref name="NLW Biog" /&gt; He returned to England to work, but began collaborating with Ivor Jones of Cardiff, in architectural competitions. In 1911 they won the competition to design Cardiff's new Technical College (now known as the [[Bute Building]]), and Thomas returned to Cardiff to work in partnership with Jones.&lt;ref name="NLW Biog" /&gt;
  
Percy Thomas's architectural practice was set up in 1911/12.&lt;ref&gt;Capita website (Media) [http://www.capita.co.uk/media/Pages/Capita_Symonds_acquires_Percy_Thomas_Architects.aspx Capita Symonds acquires Percy Thomas Architects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406021654/http://www.capita.co.uk/media/Pages/Capita_Symonds_acquires_Percy_Thomas_Architects.aspx |date=2012-04-06 }}, Press release issued 16 June 2004 (retrieved 2011-10-14)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HK History"&gt;PTP Architects (HK) website, [http://www.ptp-architects.com.hk/history/index.html HISTORY] (retrieved 2011-10-26).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s and 1930s the practice won a large number of commissions to design important civic buildings in Wales and England, including county offices for [[Glamorgan]] and [[Carmarthenshire]], Lord Davies' [[Temple of Peace, Cardiff|Temple of Peace]], [[Guildhall, Swansea|Swansea Civic Centre]], [[Aberystwyth University]] campus and a redesign of London's [[Euston Station]].&lt;ref name="NLW Biog" /&gt; 

The partnership with Ivor Jones was amicably dissolved in 1937.&lt;ref name="NLW Biog" /&gt;  

In 1946 Percy Thomas was knighted. In the same year Percy Thomas's son Norman joined the practice&lt;ref name="NLW Biog" /&gt; – which became known as Sir Percy Thomas &amp; Son.

In 1952 William Marsden and Wallace Sweet joined the practice.&lt;ref name="NLW Biog" /&gt; John Francis Vergette joined (in [[Swansea]]) in 1955.&lt;ref name="JFV obit"&gt;RIBAJournal.com [http://www.ribajournal.com/index.php/feature/article/obituary_april_2010/ Obituary: John Francis Vergette FRIBA 1930–2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330165300/http://www.ribajournal.com/index.php/feature/article/obituary_april_2010/ |date=2012-03-30 }} (retrieved 2011-10-18)&lt;/ref&gt;

Percy Thomas became seriously ill in 1962, retiring from the company in 1963.&lt;ref name="NLW Biog" /&gt;

In 1965 Sir Percy Thomas &amp; Son were commissioned to design a new Roman Catholic cathedral, [[Clifton Cathedral]], for the city of [[Bristol]]. The architect was Ronald Weeks A.R.I.B.A. Dipl Arch.&lt;ref name="Cathedral DandC"&gt;Clifton Cathedral website [http://www.cliftoncathedral.org.uk/about/guide2.html THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE CATHEDRAL CHURCH OF Ss. PETER AND PAUL, CLIFTON] (viewed 2011-10-14)&lt;/ref&gt; Percy Thomas died in 1969.  [[Clifton Cathedral]] was consecrated in 1973, by which time the architectural practice was known as Percy Thomas Partnership.&lt;ref name="Cathedral DandC" /&gt;

John Vergette became Chairman and Chief Executive of Percy Thomas Partnership. He founded the [[Royal Society of Architects in Wales]] (RSAW) and was president 1971–73.&lt;ref name="JFV obit" /&gt;

PRP eventually had six offices in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="HK History" /&gt; as well as offices in Malaysia, Hong Kong and elsewhere.

One of Percy Thomas Partnership's last works was the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] in Cardiff (2004). It was designed by [[Jonathan Adams (architect)|Jonathan Adams]], who had joined the practice in 1998. The award selectors for the [[Gold Medal (National Eisteddfod of Wales)|Wales National Eisteddfod Gold Medal]] for Architecture 2005 described the building as "a special place which will provide a focal point for the unique culture, identity and talents of Wales... The large mass of the building has been successfully formed into an impressive edifice as opposed to an oppressive monolith... In terms of texture, colour, selection of materials and spatial experience this is a feast to be enjoyed".&lt;ref name="WM awards article"&gt;thefreelibrary.com ''[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+awards+pile+up+for+Wales%27+delightful+%27armadillo%27.-a0134658283 The awards pile up for Wales' delightful 'armadillo']''.

A '''photo blanket''' is a large, rectangular piece of fabric displaying images, pictures, or designs, often with bound edges, used as a [[blanket]] or decorative object.  Historically photo blanket were made of thick cloth depicting people, objects, and symbols intended to tell a story or reveal historical events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/blanket.html Encarta (North American) Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The photo blanket has a history nearly as long as the history of clothing itself.  For thousands of years, people around the world used blankets as a form of communication through storytelling, honoring dead, and a well-respected form of art.

Ancient [[Egyptians]] weaved colored threads and sometimes even gold into a fabric (usually linen) or by painting with inks and dyes on [[papyrus]] cloth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eternalegypt.org Eternal Egypt]&lt;/ref&gt;  The cloth (blanket) would often form pictures to tell stories and to honor prominent people or one of the multiple gods of their culture.

[[Navajo people|Navajo]] tribes used special [[indigo dye]] from Mexico and other [[vegetal dyes]] to color multi-ply yarns and weave them into three main types of blankets - a [[serape]] (a shoulder covering blanket that is longer than it is wide), a [[saddle blanket]] (a blanket that was folded in half under a horse’s saddle for extra cushioning), and a chief's blanket (a shoulder blanket that was made wider than it was long).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianterritory.com Indian Territory]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[People of Nepal|Nepalese]] rug makers - one of the most respected jobs in their society - would use luxurious silks, wools, and hemp to create beautiful works or art.  Using vertical looms and fibers dyed with [[natural dye|natural vegetal dyes]], they form several different types of knots together for a soft and evenly tufted finish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lecaflor.co.uk/pdfs/tiger.pdf   Bringing New Life to an Ancient Craft]&lt;/ref&gt;

For hundreds of years, tribes throughout [[Indonesia]] and [[Africa]] have used a dye and resist technique called [[batik]] to create intricate patterns and pictures.  During the past two or three centuries batik has become one of the principal means of expression of the spiritual and cultural values of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://discover-indo.tierranet.com/batikpag.htm Discover Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt;  Once again used as a form of storytelling and passing down history, picture fabrics and blankets have been an integral part of their culture.

[[Culture of Asia|Asian cultures]] have used weaving and blankets for the same purposes, using gold and other precious metals woven into their cloths and blankets.  As an important artistic form, it conveys the history and myths of a culture through [[iconography]] and pictures.

Throughout history, photo blankets have been an ever present and fundamental key to communication, decoration, and tradition.  Today’s photo blankets have changed to modern techniques and more efficient manufacturing, but the primary meaning has remained very similar.  People display meaningful photos that represent memories and reveal history.  Adding text or symbols communicate [[language]] and add to the blanket’s storytelling aspect.

== Uses ==
Photo blankets are used throughout the home for displaying pictures and images as objects of decor, for warmth, or to be given and received as gifts.

Uses in home decor include furniture coverings and as decorative displays of a design or [[photograph]].  Photo blankets can be used to cuddle up for warmth either in or outdoors.  They are often given as wedding, birthday, [[Christmas]], baby, or anniversary gifts to individuals or couples displaying memorable pictures, dates and quotes on them.

== Types ==
There are three main types of photo blankets - woven photo blankets, knitted photo blankets, and dyed photo blankets.

A woven photo blanket is made on a [[jacquard loom]] using digital software that scans a picture, creates a pattern and then creates a woven picture blanket using various colored yarns that interlace at 90 degree angles (see [[weaving|weave]]).  Woven photo blankets, comes in two varieties; an afghan photo blanket and a tapestry photo blanket.  The yarn used in the weave of an afghan photo blanket is the same thickness in both horizontal and vertical directions while a tapestry photo blanket is manufactured with yarn of two different diameters. In a tapestry photo blanket the thinner of the two yarns; i.e., the warp, actually consists of 6-8 different color strands of yarn which are combined in various ways, based on a photo, to re-create the colors as accurately as possible (even black and white).  

A knitted photo blanket is made by a machine that uses a similar scanning and pattern process, but instead of weaving the yarns together, knits them together in a looping technique (see [[knit]]).  Often knitted photo blankets consist of limited colors due to the knitting process and the continuous thread forming loops in the process.

A dyed photo blanket is the newest type of photo blanket and is made by printing dye onto fabric from a digital image (see [[dye sublimation]]).  This type allows for unlimited colors and has the sharpest picture clarity of the three.  

Each process creates a permanent picture, with varying degrees of softness, color and clarity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18699">In [[English Renaissance|Renaissance]] [[London]], '''playing company''' was the usual term for a company of [[actor]]s. These companies were organized around a group of ten or so [[shareholder]]s (or "sharers"), who performed in the plays but were also responsible for management.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of the legal complications involved in the share structure, see: [[Susan Baskervile]]; [[Richard Baxter (actor)|Richard Baxter]]; [[Robert Dawes]].&lt;/ref&gt; The sharers employed "hired men"{{snd}} that is, the minor actors and the workers behind the scenes. The major companies were based at specific theatres in [[London]]; the most successful of them, [[William Shakespeare]]'s company the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], had the open-air [[Globe Theatre]] for summer seasons and the enclosed [[Blackfriars Theatre]] in the winters. The [[Admiral's Men]] occupied the [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]] in the 1590s, and the [[Fortune Playhouse|Fortune Theatre]] in the early 17th century.

Less fortunate companies spent most of their existences touring the provinces; when [[Worcester's Men]] gained official permission to perform in London in [[1602 in literature|1602]], they were, in a manner of speaking, "coming in from the cold" of a life of constant touring.

==Origins==
The development of theatre in England in the 16th and 17th centuries was not an isolated phenomenon; similar developments occurred simultaneously in other European countries, to greater or lesser degrees. The same broad factors influenced English actors as those that affected actors in neighboring countries, especially Scotland, France, Denmark, and states in northern Germany like Saxony and the Rhineland Palatinate.&lt;ref&gt;English actors toured Denmark and Saxony in 1586&amp;ndash;87, and reached as far as Sweden in 1592. Connections between English and Scottish theatre developed strongly after the Scottish King James assumed the English throne in 1603.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet conditions in other societies also differed significantly from those in England; the following discussion applies specifically to England in the 16th century and 17th century.

In the later [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and early [[Renaissance]] periods, wealthy and powerful English noble houses sometimes maintained a troupe of half a dozen "players", just as noblemen kept [[jester]]s or jugglers for entertainment. English theatre benefited greatly from the predilection for theatricality displayed by the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudors]]. [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] kept a company of players called the "Lusores Regis", which probably consisted of four men and a boy who were used to swift costume changes and multiple roles.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Thomson, "England" in ''The Cambridge Guide to Theatre'', Martin Banham, ed.; Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1998; p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early period the difference between players, [[Acrobatics|acrobat]]s and other entertainers was not hard and fast. A troupe of players, however, was more costly to keep than a jester; players (who usually had other household duties as well) could defray expenses by touring to various cities and performing for profit{{snd}} a practice that began the evolution away from the medieval model of noble patronage and toward the commercial and capitalistic model of modern entertainment. It is from the scattered records of such touring, and from occasional performances at the English Royal Court, that our very limited knowledge of [[English Renaissance theatre]] in the early and middle 16th century derives.

One curious development of this era was the development of companies of pre-pubescent boy actors. The use of the [[boy player]] in companies of adult actors to play female parts can be traced far back in the history of [[medieval theatre]], in the famous [[mystery play]]s and [[morality play|moralities]]; the employment of casts of boys for entire dramatic productions began in the early 16th century, which utilized the boys' choirs connected with cathedrals, churches, and schools. In time the practice took on a professional aspect and companies of child actors would play an important role in the development of drama through the [[Elizabethan era]] and into the [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] and [[Caroline era|Caroline]] periods that followed. (See: [[Children of the Chapel]]; [[Children of Paul's]]; [[Beeston's Boys]]; [[King's Revels Children]].)

==Costs==
The playing companies did not need to spend money on scenery, and their stage props were often basic (necessarily, since every company made a substantial portion of its income by touring, and some companies toured consistently with no home theatre).&lt;ref&gt;A partial exception to the rule of simplicity in stage props: companies that maintained stable long-term residences in London theatres, like the Admiral's Men and the King's Men, accumulated stores of props. Henslowe's catalogue of the Admiral's props is quoted more than once in the scholarly literature; see Gurr, ''Shakespearean Stage,'' pp. 187-8. Still, most plays were performed with a minimum of the simplest properties.&lt;/ref&gt; Their costs in costumes, however, were high: actors playing kings, cardinals, princes, and noblemen had to look the part. Companies had hundreds of pounds of value invested in their costumes, in "glaring satin suits" and "sumptuous dresses"&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, ''Shakespeare Companion,'' p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}} "cloaks in scarlet with gold laces and buttons, and in purple satin adorned with silver;" doublets of "carnation velvet, flame, ginger, red and green; and women's gowns in white satin and cloth of gold."&lt;ref&gt;Gurr, ''Shakespearean Stage,'' p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1605, Edward Alleyn estimated that his share in the "apparell" of the [[Admiral's Men]] was worth £100{{snd}} and Alleyn was one of nine sharers in the company at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, ''Elizabethan Stage,'' Vol. 2, pp. 186–7; see also pp. 184–5.&lt;/ref&gt; When a company got itself into financial difficulties, the members sometimes had to pawn their costumes, as [[Pembroke's Men]] did in the plague year of 1593.

In 1605 the actor [[Augustine Phillips]] left specific pieces of his wardrobe to an apprentice in his last will and testament{{snd}} including his "mouse-colored" velvet hose, purple cloak, white taffeta doublet, and black taffeta suit. To a modern sensibility, this may sound quaint and odd; but when "a doublet and hose of seawater green satin cost £3",&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; the monetary value of Phillips' items was not negligible. Actors could face serious penalties for appropriating the costumes of their companies. [See [[Robert Dawes]] for an example.] (The players could defray some of their costs in the used clothing market. As an example, the King's Men bought discarded items of Gondomar's wardrobe for the actor playing the Black Knight in ''[[A Game at Chess]]''. &lt;ref&gt;Melissa D. Aaron, ''Global Economics: A History of the Theatre Business, the Chamberlain's/King's Men, and Their Plays, 1599–1642,'' Newark, DE, University of Delaware Press, 2003; p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Often, "eminent lords and knights at their decease" would leave articles of their finery to their servants{{snd}} much of it "unseemly" for servingmen and women to wear. Such garments would end up the property of the actors.)&lt;ref&gt;Gurr, ''Shakespearean Stage,'' pp. 194, 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second major cost lay in play scripts. In the years around 1600, playwrights could be paid as little as £6 to £7 per play (or about the price of two suits).&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet since the companies acted a constantly changing repertory, they needed an abundant supply of plays. [[Philip Henslowe]]'s Diary records dozens of titles for the 1597&amp;ndash;1603 period; when [[Worcester's Men]] were setting up for their first London season in 1602, they purchased a dozen new plays from Henslowe's stable of house playwrights, to supplement their existing stock.

The sharers in the company also paid wages to their hired men and boys. Wages differed somewhat over time and from company to company and case to case; but the general average minimum was 1 [[shilling]] per man per day, the same wage as that of an artisan worker. Boys cost perhaps half as much, though they were often maintained under some version of an apprenticeship arrangement, which could vary widely in details.

==Scheduling==
Performances at the public theatres were generally allowed six days per week; the theatres were closed on Sundays and major religious holidays like [[Good Friday]]. Other restrictions were laid upon the players, some of which they evaded as consistently as they could. They were supposed to cease playing entirely during [[Lent]]{{snd}} but violated this stricture regularly. In the spring of 1592, for example, the [[Lord Strange's Men]] played daily at the [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]] right through Lent. After 1623, companies circumvented the Lenten restriction through the simple expedient of paying bribes to Sir [[Henry Herbert (Master of the Revels)|Henry Herbert]], the [[Master of the Revels]].

One restriction that the players observed, one that was too serious to violate, was the prohibition enforced whenever [[bubonic plague]] rose from endemic to epidemic levels. Through much of the English Renaissance period, the theatres were shut down when the death figures in the plague bill (the weekly mortality report for London and some suburban parishes) rose above a certain level. In 1604 that cut-off number was set at 30 per week; in 1607 it was raised to 40. A serious epidemic closed the theatres almost entirely from June 1592 through April 1594; 11,000 Londoners died of plague in 1593. (The plague tended to abate in the colder weather of winter; the theatres opened for short seasons during the winter months of those years.) 1603 was another bad plague year, with 30,000 deaths in London; the theatres were closed from March 1603 to perhaps April 1604.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, pp. 371–2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other serious epidemics caused theatre closures in 1625 (for eight months, to October) and from May 1636 to October 1637. These periods of closure were always traumatically difficult for the acting troupes; some survived by touring cities and towns outside London...and some didn't survive at all.

==The Elizabethan Age==
The explosion of popular drama that began when [[James Burbage]] built the first fixed and permanent venue for drama, [[The Theatre]], in [[1576 in literature|1576]] was the one great step away from the medieval organizational model and toward the commercial theatre; but that evolution was, at best, a "work in progress" throughout the English Renaissance. Throughout this period, troupes of actors needed to maintain the patronage of a noble household. The prevailing legal system in England&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, a 1572 Act amending the Tudor Poor Law, which criminalized minstrels, bearwards, fencers and "Comon Players in Enterludes" who did not enjoy noble patronage. Halliday, ''Shakespeare Companion,'' p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; defined "masterless men" who traveled about the country as vagabonds, and subjected them to treatments of varying harshness. Local authorities tended to be more hostile than welcoming toward players; the Corporation of London, from the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London|Lord Mayor]] and aldermen down, was famously hostile to acting troupes, as were the [[Puritan]]s. Noble patronage was, at the very least, the legal fig leaf that allowed professional players to function in society.

In some cases, more so toward the end of the period, noble patronage was nothing more than that legal fig leaf; a company of actors was an independent entity, financially and otherwise. Conversely, some noblemen were beneficent patrons of their players. The Lords Hunsdon{{snd}} [[Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon]] (c. 1524&amp;ndash;96), and his son [[George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon]] (1547&amp;ndash;1603){{snd}} were valuable protectors of their own company, and, when they served in the office of [[Lord Chamberlain]] (1585&amp;ndash;96 and 1597&amp;ndash;1603 respectively), of English drama as a whole.

That company of Hunsdon's, known to posterity as The Lord Chamberlain's Men, was organized somewhat like a modern joint-stock commercial company (the concept of which was just beginning to evolve in this era) at its re-formation in [[1594 in literature|1594]], after the long plague closure. The company had a small number of partners or shareholders, who pooled their funds to pay expenses and in turn shared the profits, in what was largely a de facto democratic way (at least for the sharers, if not for the hired men and apprentices they employed). Their main rivals, the Admiral's Men, suffered in contrast under a less ideal version of capitalist organization: [[Philip Henslowe]] functioned more like a blend of big-business autocrat, landlord, and loan shark. He managed multiple companies of actors and built and owned several theatres, and controlled players (sharers included) and playwrights by doling out payments and loans. (The silver lining in this cloud is that Henslowe's surviving financial records provide a wealth of detailed knowledge about the theatre conditions in his era that is unparalleled by any other source.) Other companies varied between these extremes of organization. ([[Francis Langley]], builder of the [[The Swan (theatre)|Swan Theatre]], operated much as Henslowe did, though less successfully, and for a shorter time.)     

Drama in the age of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] was at best an organized disorder; suppression of individual companies, and even the profession as a whole, for political reasons was not unknown. [See: ''[[The Isle of Dogs (play)|The Isle of Dogs]]''.] Local residents sometimes opposed theatres in their neighborhoods. Individual companies of actors struggled and failed and recombined; tracking the changes has been the obsession of scholars and the bane of students. 

Yet the drama was also enormously popular, from the Queen and Court down to the commonest of the common people; indeed, the odd polarity of the theatre audience in this period, with the High and the Low favoring the drama, and the middle class generally more hostile with the growth of Puritan sentiments, is a surprising and intriguing phenomenon. Theatres proliferated, especially (though not exclusively) in neighborhoods outside the city's walls and the Corporation's control{{snd}} in [[Shoreditch]] to the north, or the [[Bankside]] and Paris Garden in [[Southwark]], on the southern bank of the [[River Thames]]: the [[Curtain Theatre|Curtain]], the [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose]], the [[The Swan (theatre)|Swan]], the [[Fortune Playhouse|Fortune]], the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]], the [[Blackfriars Theatre|Blackfrairs]]{{snd}} a famous roster.

==The Jacobean and Caroline Eras==
King [[James I of England|James]], "VI and I", was passionately fond of drama; and theatrical activity at Court accelerated from the start of his reign. Consider the following figures.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In roughly the last decade of Elizabeth's reign, 1594&amp;ndash;1603, there were 64 theatrical performances at Court, for an average of 6 or 7 a year:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|Chamberlain's Men
|32
|-
|Admiral's Men
|20
|-
|other adult companies
| 5
|-
|boys' companies
| 7
|-
|}

Compare a total of 299 for a somewhat longer period in the first portion of James' reign, 1603&amp;ndash;16, an average of more than 20 per year:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|King's Men
|177
|-
|Prince Henry's Men
| 47
|-
|other adult companies
| 57
|-
|boys' companies
| 18
|-
|}

The major companies acquired royal patronage: the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] became the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], and the [[Admiral's Men]] became Prince Henry's Men, under the patronage of the King's eldest son. A company of [[Queen Anne's Men]] was built out of the pre-existent [[Oxford's Men|Oxford's ]] and [[Pembroke's Men]], companies that were largely devoted to touring the provinces in the previous reign. In 1608 a company was organized under the title of the King's second son, the eight-year-old Charles; this company, the Duke of York's Men, was called [[Prince Charles's Men]] after Prince Henry unexpectedly died in 1612.

Companies continued to form, evolve, and dissolve in the early Jacobean era{{snd}} the [[King's Revels Children]], the [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]]; but by the midpoint of James' reign, around the time of Shakespeare's death in [[1616 in literature|1616]], the dramatic scene had generally stabilized into four important companies. These were: the King's Men, at the Globe and Blackfriars Theatres; [[Admiral's Men|Palsgrave's Men]] (formerly the Admiral's and Prince Henry's Men), at the Fortune; [[Prince Charles's Men]], at the [[Hope Theatre|Hope]]; and [[Queen Anne's Men]], at the [[Red Bull Theatre]].

Theatrical evolution continued, sometimes tied to the lives and deaths of royal patrons. Queen Anne's Men disbanded with the death of [[Anne of Denmark]] in 1619; the accession of a new queen in 1625 saw the creation of [[Queen Henrietta's Men]]. Occasionally there were other new companies like [[Beeston's Boys]], and new theatres like the [[Salisbury Court Theatre|Salisbury Court]]. The two prolonged closings of the London theatres due to plague, in 1625 and 1636&amp;ndash;37, caused significant disruption in the acting profession, with companies breaking apart, combining and re-combining, and switching theatres, in a dizzying confusion. (Only the King's Men were exempt.) Political suppressions also came along in the Stuart era, though they affected only single offending companies{{snd}} until a general political suppression closed the theatres from [[1642 in literature|1642]] to [[1660 in literature|1660]], and brought the age of [[English Renaissance theatre]] to its end.

'''''Reason and Morality''''' is a 1978 book about [[ethics]] by the philosopher [[Alan Gewirth]], in which the author attempts to develop a rational foundation for morality, beginning from the premise that every rational agent must have freedom and well-being. The book, which received positive reviews, is famous and has received much attention. It is the work for which Gewirth is best known. However, some philosophers have criticized Gewirth's arguments. Gewirth responded to many of the criticisms made of his work. Gewirth's work is defended by the legal scholar [[Deryck Beyleveld]] in ''The Dialectical Necessity of Morality'' (1991).

==Summary==
{{expand section|date=October 2018}}
Gewirth discusses the rational justification of moral principles.{{sfn|Gewirth|1981|page=ix}}

==Publication history==
''Reason and Morality'' was first published in 1978 by the [[University of Chicago Press]].{{sfn|Gewirth|1981|page=iv}}

==Reception==
===Mainstream media===
''Reason and Morality'' received a positive review from Robert Hoffman in ''[[Library Journal]]''.{{sfn|Hoffman|1978|page=464}} The book was also discussed in ''Choice'' from H. Oberdiek and J. M. Betz.{{sfn|Obderiek|1990|page=1694}}{{sfn|Betz|1996|page=534}}

Hoffman wrote that the book was "ambitious and careful" and "eminently worth reading."{{sfn|Hoffman|1978|page=464}}

===Academic journals===
''Reason and Morality'' received a positive review from the philosopher [[Loren Lomasky]] in ''[[The Philosophical Quarterly]]''.{{sfn|Lomasky|1981|pages=248–253}} The book was also reviewed by E. M. Adams in ''[[The Review of Metaphysics]]'',{{sfn|Adams|1980|pages=579–592}} and received discussions from Richard Brooks in the ''Journal of Legal Education'',{{sfn|Brooks|1981|pages=287–305}} the philosopher [[Marcus George Singer]] in ''Ratio Juris'',{{sfn|Singer|2000|pages=177–195}} Ari Kohen in ''[[Human Rights Review]]'',{{sfn|Kohen|2005|pages=49–75}} Eric Reitan in ''[[Social Theory and Practice]]'',{{sfn|Reitan|2006|pages=415–438}}  Brian K. Powell in ''[[Dialogue: Canadian Philosophical Review]]'',{{sfn|Powell|2009|pages=373–386}} Rutger Claassen and Marcus Düwell in ''[[Ethical Theory and Moral Practice]]'',{{sfn|Claassen|Düwell|2013|pages=493–510}} and Anna-Karin Margareta Andersson in the ''[[Journal of Medical Ethics]]''.{{sfn|Andersson |2016|pages=242–245}}

Lomasky found some of Gewirth's arguments to be flawed, believed that Gewirth failed to establish the "rationally necessary supreme substantive principle" of morality, and noted that it "has been suggested that the universalisation extending the proscription against interference as a normative rule incumbent upon all agents is invalid." He also questioned "the concept of having a right to non-interference", arguing that it was doubtful that the fact that people want freedom and well-being logically supported the claim that people have rights to these things. However, he agreed with Gewirth's view that the purposive and voluntary nature of action shows that it has a "normative structure", and believed that a view of morality similar to Gewirth's might be defensible. He concluded that Gewirth's book was "an essential resource for all subsequent explorations" of the issues it discussed.{{sfn|Lomasky|1981|pages=248–253}}

Brooks credited Gewirth with providing "a complex and detailed brief for an individualist, humanist, ethical position" and presenting "a logical linkage between the system and legal decision making relevant to law students."{{sfn|Brooks|1981|pages=287–305}} Singer wrote that the book was "justly famous" and a "masterful treatise", and that it was praised by the philosopher [[Henry Babcock Veatch]]. According to Singer, the book became the focus of an "immense volume of commentary", with Gewirth's idea of prudential rights being especially controversial, having received criticism from Singer himself, as well as other authors. He noted that Gewirth had responded to the commentary on his work and that [[Deryck Beyleveld]], in ''The Dialectical Necessity of Morality'' (1991), discussed criticisms of it and defended Gewirth's views, though in his opinion Beyleveld was not successful in defending Gewirth's view of prudential rights. He argued that while Gewirth book was original and brilliant, it had the defect that Gewirth's outlook excluded the possibility of reasonable disagreement about moral issues.{{sfn|Singer|2000|pages=177–195}}

Kohen wrote that Gewirth's ideas had received nearly as much attention as those advanced by the philosopher [[John Rawls]] in ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971). He noted that Gewirth, assisted by Beyleveld, had responded to many of his critics, but argued that Gewirth failed to provide an adequate "secular foundation for the idea of human rights." He criticized Gewirth's view "that self-contradiction represents the most compelling argument against violating human rights". He also argued that "an agent might accept the first part of Gewirth’s theory about his own generic rights and reject without
contradiction the second part about universalizing those rights" and that "Gewirth’s prospective purposive agents are too far removed from the real world in which human rights are actually in play." He drew on the ideas of the psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] to criticize Gewirth's work.{{sfn|Kohen|2005|pages=49–75}} Powell suggested that there was a "decisive objection" to Gewirth's views, which he compared to those of the philosophers [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Karl-Otto Apel]].{{sfn|Powell|2009|pages=373–386}} Claassen and Düwell compared Gewirth's views to those of the philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]]. They noted that Gewirth's approach to morality "has been widely discussed with regard to its basic assumptions and the strengths and weaknesses of its justification" and that it has been "applied to discourses about human rights, political philosophy, economy, and bioethics".{{sfn|Claassen|Düwell|2013|pages=493–510}}

===Evaluations in books===
The philosopher [[Jan Narveson]], writing in ''The Libertarian Idea'' (1988), noted that ''Reason and Morality'' was an important work. However, he considered Gewirth's moral theory open to criticism. Narveson argued that while, according to Gewirth, rational agents must acknowledge a certain set of rights because those rights are required for their "purpose-fulfilling actions", such actions do not require rights but only "enough noninterference by others". He also rejected Gewirth's view that rational agents must acknowledge these rights for all in order to claim them for themselves, arguing that, in a person's capacity as a rational agent, they want only noninterference from others, and that this does not logically require them to accept "the duties entailed by wholehearted acceptance" of the rights Gewirth sees as following from people's need to engage in "purpose-fulfilling actions".{{sfn|Narveson|2001|page=171}}

James P. Sterba, writing in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'' (2005), stated that ''Reason and Morality'' is the work for which Gewirth is best known.{{sfn|Sterba|2005|page=339}}

[[Image:RIVERSIDE ROMEO &amp; JULIET POSTER SMALL revised.jpg|thumb|right|Poster: Riverside Shakespeare Company's inaugural parks tour of ''Romeo &amp; Juliet''. Peter Siiteri, Stuart Rudin, Eloise Watt. (1977)]]

The '''Riverside Shakespeare Company''' of New York City was founded in 1977 as a professional ([[Actors' Equity Association|AEA]]) theatre company on the [[Upper West Side]] of New York City, by W. Stuart McDowell and Gloria Skurski. Focusing on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] plays and other classical repertoire, it operated through 1997.

==Establishment and heritage==
[[File:Midsummer Night's Dream - Riverside.jpg|thumb|''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', with Eric Hoffmann as Puck. Summer 1978]]
Founded with a core of graduates from the [[University of California at Berkeley]],&lt;ref&gt;The graduates from the University of California at Berkeley included Stuart McDowell, Gloria Skurski, Mary Skinner, Peter Siiteri, Kent Odell, John Jonas, Bob Helsel, and Dan Southern.&lt;/ref&gt; the Riverside Shakespeare Company of New York City opened its first production, ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', in August 1977 in [[Riverside Park (Manhattan)|Riverside Park]]. It then commenced a free parks tour through Manhattan, performing in [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]], [[John Jay Park]], [[Fort Tryon Park]], and [[Columbia University]]. The production was directed by McDowell.&lt;ref&gt;With fight choreography by Joel Leffert and music by Michael Moore, featuring Peter Siiteri, Dan Southern, Mary Skinner, Kent Odell and Eric Hoffmann, Jim Brewster, Stuart Rudin and Eloise Watt, Lisa Kramer, Harriet Bigus, Marilyn Beck, Douglas Stone, Warrington Winters, and [[Victor Argo]], all of whom became founding members.&lt;/ref&gt;

An opening-night announcement in ''The New York Times'' read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Riverside Shakespeare Company is taking up where Joseph Papp left off this summer by presenting free Shakespeare in the park.... The production will be done in traveling minstrel style, evocative of Shakespeare's time.  Beforehand, to set the period mood, performers will be scattered around the park – jugglers, fencers, singers, poetry readers.  Then a fanfare will call the players to the stage, and the tale of star-cross'd lovers will begin.&lt;ref&gt;"Shakespeare on the Drive", ''The New York Times'', August 19, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The inaugural production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' was a two-hour version, trimmed to incorporate extensive swordplay, an extended ballroom dance scene, and [[pantomime]], such as the appearance to Juliet of Tybalt's ghost. Each performance was also timed to end with the setting of the sun in mid August.  Performances were preceded by the entire company of actors and musicians entertaining the audience with a ''Greenshow'' – a preshow spoof of the production to follow, that served the dual purpose of building a comedic, physical bridge between actor and audience, and of establishing a physical, spontaneous style of acting that incorporated the performance environment into the show. This drew on the roots of the company – and of Shakespeare – in the rich heritage of [[Commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref&gt;The tradition of the ''Greenshow'', with which Riverside began its first production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' in 1977 and continued for each of its subsequent parks tours, had been established for company members as a key part of outdoor Shakespeare performance by Carlo Mazonne-Clementi, renowned master of Commedia dell'arte, and Jane Hill, the  co-founders of the ''Dell'Arte School of Mime and Comedy'' (now known as the [[Dell'Arte International School of Physical Theatre]]) in Blue Lake California, where McDowell and Southern had acted and trained as part of the inaugural summer festivals established by Mazzone and Hill during the summers of 1973–1974.  According to Michael Fields, Company Producing Artistic Director of the current Dell'Arte School, Carlo Mazzone-Clementi "...brought to the United States a living breathing theatrical form that changed, moved, inspired and transformed generations of performers."  It was this intensive form of physicalization that characterized the carefree ''Greenshows'' and a performance style that became hallmarks of Riverside's subsequent outdoor productions. "Behind the Mask: Carlo Mazzone-Clementi, 1920–2000", Bob Doran, ''The North Coast Journal'', Nov 16, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following autumn, the company began a series of readings of the works of Shakespeare, reading through the entire canon the first year.  Growing out of this, the company  inaugurated a series of free radio broadcasts of Shakespeare's works on the New York public radio station, [[WBAI]].   A board of directors was soon formed under the guidance of founding chairperson, Elena Scotti of [[Lincoln Center]].  At its founding in 1977, the Riverside Shakespeare Company became New York City's only year-round professional Shakespeare company dedicated to the performance of the works of Shakespeare, his contemporaries, and Commedia dell'arte.&lt;ref&gt;Three years after the founding of Riverside Shakespeare, ''Show Business'' noted that "Going into its third season as New York's only year-round Shakespeare producer, Riverside has established a fine reputation for producing high-quality classic theatre." ''Show Business'', Thursday, August 30, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:RIVERSIDE TWELFTH NIGHT POSTER 2 SMALL.jpg|thumb|130px|right|''Twelfth Night'' (1977)
: Eric Hoffmann, Bob Helsel, Kieron Murphy, Peter Siiteri]] --&gt;
During its inaugural 1977–1978 season, after its parks tour of ''Romeo &amp; Juliet'', the Riverside Shakespeare Company presented a free 'Equity library tour' of ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', directed by Gloria Skurski, with music by Michael Moore,&lt;ref&gt;With original music by Michael Moore and costumes by Sherry Amott. Featuring Peter Siiteri, Eloise Watt, Mary Skinner, and Eric Hoffmann, who were joined by Frank Fico, Bob Helsel, Ellen Martin, Jim Maxson, Kieron Murphy, Howard Shalwitz, and Tim Snay.&lt;/ref&gt; which then had an extended run [[Off Broadway]] at the [[Manhattan Theatre Club]] Stage 73. Judy Thrall, in the ''Heights/Inwood Press of North Manhattan'' reviewed the production of ''Twelfth Night'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some theatre companies – those which start out with talented and intelligent actors – are born great.  Some companies – those which start out with diffident, inexperienced people who soon mature with their art – achieve greatness.  And some companies – those which start out untrained and unguided – can, with the advent of a brilliant force, have greatness thrust upon them.  In the first hyperbolic category is one of the city's newest theater groups, the Riverside Shakespeare Company.... Now the group is well on its way to becoming an important theatrical force in Upper Manhattan and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;"A Troupe Born to Greatness" by Judy Thrall, ''Heights/Inwood Press of North Manhattan'', Nov 11, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===First Folio production of the complete ''Hamlet''===
[[Image:RIVERSIDE-HAMLET-OPHELIA-2.jpg|thumb|160px|The complete ''Hamlet'' with Kaeren Peregrin as Ophelia, 1978]]
In the spring of 1978, the company mounted the complete ''[[Hamlet]]'' on the courtyard roof of Riverside Church in Manhattan in late afternoon.  The success of this production enabled the company to remount its ''Hamlet'' – this time lit by torches in the late evening – on the main ''University Walk'' before the Low Library at [[Columbia University]], using a large stage surrounded by sheets of steel, erected to create a reflective environment for both the voice and the torch illumination.&lt;ref name="Ari Panagako 1978"&gt;Ari Panagako, "Dandy Hamlet Bows Uptown", ''Heights/Inwood Press of North Manhattan'', June 14, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The production was designed and directed by W. Stuart McDowell and featured Peter Siiteri as Hamlet.&lt;ref&gt;The cast also included Dan Southern, Stuart Rudin, Eric Hoffmann, Jim Maxson, Kieron Murphy, Jim Brewster, Michael Arabian, Kaeren Peregrin, Robert Lanchester, Leslie Blake and John Rowe. Original music was composed and played by Michael Moore and costumes were by Vernon Yates.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riverside's ''Hamlet'' marked its first ''[[First Folio]] Production'', in which the entire text of Shakespeare's play was presented in a lively, action-filled production, enabling the company to mount the complete ''Hamlet'' in under three hours.  A ''Greenshow'' also preceded each outdoor performance, entertaining the audience as they arrived in a spoof of the play to follow, which was staged by "the Players" en route to "Elsinore".

The torchlit performance of ''Hamlet'' at Columbia University was reviewed by ''Heights/Innwood Newspaper of North Manhattan'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Siiteri's sly innuendoes and elegant gestures as Hamlet were put to good use.  His reactions in his father's ghost and in Ophelia's death had traces of the vulnerability and humanity seen in the finest Hamlets.  Others in the cast ranged from very good to superb. Kaeren Peregrin as Ophelia gave a chilling "mad scene".  Robert Lanchester as Claudius was delightfully depraved, and Frank Fico as Polonius was wonderfully amusing without turning the endearing and gentleman into a buffoon.  Bravo also to John Rowe as Laertes.... All of the actors projected magnificently without the aid of microphones – and this in the open air!&lt;ref name="Ari Panagako 1978"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Expanded tour of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''===
[[File:Midsummer - Riverside.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' at Carl Schurz Park, Manhattan, 1978. The set utilized a series of sheet steel walls to project the natural voice.]]
In its second summer, 1978, the company presented a popular free tour of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', with Eric Hoffmann as Puck, Karen Hurley as Titania, and Eric Conger as Oberon, directed by Gloria Skurski.&lt;ref&gt;Also featuring Eloise Watt, Kent Odell, Mary Skinner, and Jim Brewster, as well as Stuart Rudin, Ronald Lew Harris, Larry Attile, Jim Aucoin, Robert Cendella, Sarah Fairfax, Lisa Kramer, Mike Logan, and Arland Russell.&lt;/ref&gt; An original score by Deborah Awner was performed by the touring group "Brass".&lt;ref&gt;With an original score composed by Debra Awner for strings and brass and performed live by the touring group "Brass", with costumes, puppets, and make-up designed by renowned Muppet designer Sherry Amott.&lt;/ref&gt; The production continued the tradition of un-miked Shakespeare, making use of a sheet-steel touring set for natural amplification of both actors and musicians.&lt;ref name="Erika Munk 1978"&gt;"Outdoor Performances in New York" by Erika Munk, ''The Village Voice'', August 23, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

The parks tour of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was expanded to play locations in three [[boroughs of New York City]], including [[Wave Hill (New York)|Wave Hill]] in the Bronx, which became a favorite annual summer performing site for the company.

In what was becoming a Riverside tradition, each performance was preceded a half hour before curtain by a "Greenshow" of Commedia entertainment, by the cast and musicians on the stage and throughout the audience.&lt;ref&gt;"Midsummer Thoroughly Enjoyable", by Ari Panagako, ''Heights Inwood Press of North Manhattan'', August 22, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Erika Munk of the ''Village Voice'' wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Shakespeare at the Delacorte always disappoints me because it's overmiked and not in tune with park life; but I saw a charming ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' by the Riverside Shakespeare Company: no mikes, no lights, no seats; only clever placement at the bottom of Soldier and Sailors Monument to give the audience a view from the steps; broad acting and old-fashioned projection so that everyone could follow; an ability to capitalize on the audience's pre-disposition to enjoy itself; the flexibility to deal with dogs, kids, jets, and drunks; and splendid timing – the play ended as the sun went down.&lt;ref name="Erika Munk 1978"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''As You Like It'' at Manhattan Theatre Club's Stage 73===
[[Image:RIVERSIDE AS YOU LIKE IT final flat.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''As You Like It'': Robert Boyle, Timothy Hall, Margo Gruber, Caryn West, 1978]]
The following fall the company staged ''[[As You Like It]]'' at the [[Manhattan Theatre Club]]'s Stage 73, featuring Robert Boyle, Timothy Hall, Margo Gruber and Caryn West – all making their New York stage debut; with Kent Odell, Jim Maxson, Stuart Rudin, Ken Grantham, Timothy Hall, Peter Jensen, Kenneth Lane, Gannon McHale, Sheri Meyers, Uriel Menson, Brock Seawell, Daniel Tamm, and David Robert Westfall (stage manager), and directed by Eric Hoffmann, with set designed by David Lockner, costumes by Deborah Otte, lighting by Nat Cohen, and music by Deborah Awner.

Hoffmann set Shakespeare's most pastoral play with an autumnal setting in Colonial American, using leaves gathered from Central Park, which gradually filled the stage with knee-deep piles of leaves, and underscored with original guitar music played by Robert Mamary and Joseph Poshek. The production was acclaimed for its creative setting in this bucolic, pre-American revolutionary time, in which Amiens, played by Larry Kirchgaessner, became a Native American in the American forest of Arden.&lt;ref&gt;"Remounting the Classics", by Donald R. Wilson, ''Soho Weekly News'', November 2, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production was attended by [[Mildred Natwick]], who became the company's first member of its Board of Advisors, soon to be followed by [[Helen Hayes]].  At this production, it was announced that the company's ultimate goal was "to build a replica of Shakespeare's Globe Theater on the banks of the Hudson River in New York City."&lt;ref&gt;Program for the Riverside Shakespeare Company's ''As You Like It'', November 10, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York premiere of the "madrigal comedy" ''L'Amfiparnaso''===
The production of ''[[As You Like It]]'' was joined at Stage 73 by the New York premiere of the Commedia dell'arte scenario, the 16th century "madrigal comedy" by [[Orazio Vecchi]], ''L'Amfi Parnasso'', directed by Dan Southern featuring company members performing with Renaissance music arranged and played by the chamber group ''The Western Wind''.  This production was the company's first purely Commedia dell'arte style production, and featured the use of hand-crafted leather masks, improvisation, stylized movement and comic [[lazzi]].

===''Twelfth Night'' at Riverside Church===
In April 1979, the theatre company mounted a new production of ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', set in an [[Art Nouveau]] style, directed by John Clingerman, with Andrew Achsen, Kristin Rudrud, Stuart Cohen, Alison Edwards, Beata Jachulski, Will Lecki, Scott Parson, [[Bruce Altman]], and Ted Polites, staged in the round (with audiences on four sides) in the lower chamber of Riverside Church in Manhattan, featuring music by Deborah Awner.  This production was one of many that the theatre company opened on Shakespeare's birthday, April 23; this time, the production was inaugurated by a special celebration, culminating with the reading of a Shakespearean sonnet by the pastor of Riverside Church, fellow Bardophile, Rev. [[William Sloan Coffin]].&lt;ref&gt;This production of ''Twelfth Night'' in 1979 proved to be one of only two staged at Riverside Church; the company was named not after the church, but the park where it began its first production in 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The professional Shakespeare company at Columbia University==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:RIVERSIDE MUCH ADO 1.jpg|thumb|right|160px|''Much Ado About Nothing'' (1979): Margo Gruber and Gannon McHale]] --&gt;
From 1978 to 1980, the Riverside Shakespeare Company was the professional Equity theater company in residence at [[Columbia University]] under the sponsorship of Andrew B. Harris and internationally renowned Shakespeare scholar [[Bernard Beckerman]], with audition, construction, storage and rehearsal spaces in Prentice Hall on West 125th Street west of Broadway, just a stone's throw from the Hudson River.  A core company of twelve to fifteen professional actors were often complemented with Columbia University students both backstage and onstage as performers, working as student apprentices within the company, not unlike Shakespeare's company 400 years before.

===''Much Ado'' at Manhattan Theatre Club's Stage 73===
Early in 1979 the company produced ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' directed by Gloria Skurski  with original music by Deborah Awner, with Margo Gruber and Gannon McHale, and Timothy Oman, Jim Brewster, Robert Boyle, Ronald Lew Harris, David Florek, Arland Russell, Daniel Tam and Leigh Podgorski, at [[Manhattan Theatre Club]]'s Stage 73. The production was set in the roaring 20's, as if F. Scott Fitzgerald had imagined the meeting of Beatrice and Benedict at a festive garden party on Cape Cod.

The production of ''Much Ado About Nothing'' was staged as the first part of a double bill, followed by a glass of wine and then, on the same stage with a quick change of scenery, by Niccolo Machiavelli's ''[[The Mandrake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Show Business'', June 30, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Folio production of ''Henry IV, Part One''===
The company then mounted its first History Play by Shakespeare.  In the late spring of 1979, after two months rehearsal of the armies of King Henry and Hotspur on the rooftop of Columbia University's Prentice Hall in southern Harlem, the company opened its third annual outdoor production of free Shakespeare, a major Equity staging of the complete ''[[Henry IV, Part One]]''.  This was Riverside's second ''First Folio Production'', mounted on a replica of Shakespeare's [[Globe Theater]], constructed on the courtyard roof Prentise Hall at West 125th and Broadway, and transported and erected on the main campus Quad of [[Columbia University]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:RIVERSIDE-HENRY-IV-PHOTO-35.jpg|thumb|right|160px|''Henry IV, Part I'', with Nicholas Schatzki, Dan Southern, Gay Reed, and John Hiller, 1979]] --&gt;

The cast featured Dan Southern as Hotspur and Jason Moehring as Hal, with Eric Hoffmann as Falstaff and William Hanauer as King Henry, and a cast of forty including Jim Brewster, Mary Skinner, Vit Horejs, David Murray Jaffe, Kathleen Monteleone, Jason Moehring, Julia Murray, Gay Reed, John Miller and Lois Tibbetts, with music by Deborah Awner played by a live orchestra.

For this production, the company built a replica of Shakespeare's [[Globe Theater]] outdoors, surrounded by trees on the southeast corner of the Columbia University Quad; the production was directed by W. Stuart McDowell and performed at night without microphones in this perfect acoustic environment, on a set designed and built by Dorian Vernacchio, costumes by Kenneth M. Yount, fight choreography for broadsword, halberd, dagger and mace, by Joel Leffert.

The reviewer of ''Show Business'', Ted Bank, noted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Riverside Shakespeare Company has injected this chronicle history with all the pageantry and spectacle it calls for, and the result is exciting theatre.... What makes ''Henry IV, Part One'' so delightful is that Riverside Shakespeare Company has taken pains to bring historical detail into the production.  Going into its third season as New York's only year-round Shakespeare producer, Riverside has established a fine reputation for producing high-quality classic theatre."&lt;ref&gt;''Show Business'', August 30, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The popularity of ''Henry IV, Part IV'' at Columbia University enabled the company to extend the run by remounting the entire production [[Off Broadway]] indoors at the American Theatre for Actors in midtown Manhattan in the fall of 1979.

==Tom Hanks and Michael Wolff in Machiavelli's ''The Mandrake''==
[[File:RIVERSIDE THE MANDRAKE 20 HANKS.jpg|thumb|180px|''The Mandrake'' with [[Tom Hanks]] as Callimaco, 1979]]

In 1979 the Riverside Shakespeare Company mounted Niccolo Machiavelli's Renaissance farce, ''[[The Mandrake]]'', in the large second floor auditorium of the ''Casa Italiana'' of Columbia University located at West 117th and Amsterdam Avenue.

The ''Casa Italiana'', which had recently been designated by the Landmarks Preservation Commission, proved an ideal setting for production: Riverside's Florentine set was surrounded by the Florentine architecture, wrought iron chandeliers, and Italian antiques, some donated by Premier Benito Mussolini when the building was erected in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;The room where the theatre company erected its stage for ''The Mandrake'' has been described as "a long auditorium with rusticated plaster work in imitation of stone and a coffered ceiling" in the article "Streetscapes: Casa Italiana; Renovating a Campus Curio", by Christopher Gray, ''The New York Times'', April 12, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Performing in the style of Commedia dell'arte, with masks and fanciful commedia costumes, the cast included Arland Russell, Mark Cavalieri, Jeff Cameron, [[Tom Hanks]], Susan Kay Logan, Perla Armanasco and Michael Goldner.  In this production [[Tom Hanks]] played the lead role of the scoundrel Callimaco – in his first and only stage production in New York City until making his Broadway debut in [[Nora Ephron]]'s "[[Lucky Guy (play)|Lucky Guy]]" in spring 2013.

The production of ''The Mandrake'' was cast and rehearsed in the company's fourth floor facility of Columbia University's Prentise Hall in southern Harlem, and was directed by company member Dan Southern (then Daniel O. Smith),&lt;ref&gt;Daniel O. Smith subsequently became known as Dan Southern when he became a member of the Actors' Equity Association.&lt;/ref&gt; The production was played with authentic leather masks and fanciful costumes conceived and constructed by Broadway designer Jane Stein, period sets – including a raked checkerboard stage – designed and built by Gerard Bourcier, lighting (which incorporated the wrought iron chandeliers of the Casa Italiana) by John B. Forbes, and produced by Gloria Skurski and W. Stuart McDowell.  In the ''Heights/Inwood Press of North Manhattan'' review of March 14, 1979, Jan Rucquoi noted that:
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:RIVERSIDE THE MANDRAKE 10 SMALL with TITLE SEPIA.jpg|thumb|180px|''The Mandrake'' with Susan Kay Logan and Michael Goldner, 1979]] --&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A delightfully produced, fast-paced farce happened uptown on Columbia University's Campus, in the Casa Italiana.... In ''The Mandrake'' the audience is often brought into the confidence of the actors who unmask themselves to do so.&lt;ref name="Jann Racquoi 1979"&gt;Review by Jann Racquoi, ''Heights/Inwood Press of North Manhattan'', March 14, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The leather masks designed by Stein were often used inventively to comic effect, with actors sometimes removing them for an inner monologue, as in Hanks' portrayal of Callimaco, in which he conversed to himself while holding his quarter mask to one side.

''The Mandrake'' was accompanied by an original jazz score composed (and with a running improvised narration) by pianist-composer-orchestra leader [[Michael Wolff (musician)|Michael Wolff]].  According to the ''Heights/Inwood Press of North Manhattan'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The music composed for the play had a Brechtian feel to it, enriching the play and setting the mood of high jinks and fun.  Also, the fanciful costumes, works of art in themselves, with their overblown appliqued ornamentation, were a delightful asset to the production.&lt;ref name="Jann Racquoi 1979"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The production of ''The Mandrake'' opened on March 2, 1979 at the Casa Italiana, and was stage managed by Nancy Consentino Minckler and produced by W. Stuart McDowell and Gloria Skurski, in association with Columbia University.

===''The Mandrake'' at Stage 73, and on tour through New York City===
Later that year, the success of Riverside's production of ''The Mandrake'' enabled the company to remount the show with the company's new production of ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' as a late night double bill in repertory at [[Manhattan Theatre Club]]'s Stage 73.  With the departure of Hanks to the west coast at the end of the run at the Casa Italiana, Dan Southern took over the role of Callimaco for the late night cabaret-like performances.&lt;ref&gt;"''The Mandrake'' and ''Much Ado About Nothing''", by Ted Bank, ''Show Business'', June 10, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to its two indoor stagings, ''The Mandrake'' was revived for several outdoor engagements, performed on a two-wheel cart with simple cloth backdrop, beginning with the dedication of the ''Shakespeare Garden'' in the Brooklyn, hosted by [[Joseph Papp]], [[Estelle Parsons]] and W. Stuart McDowell.  The role of Callimaco was assumed by the play's director, Dan Southern. A small cart stage with canvas backdrop was used. The openness of staging, in natural sunlight and without the trappings and concealments of an indoor theatre, was typical of the performance style of ''Commedia dell'arte'', in which the audience members are constantly made aware of the artifice of the production, and thereby become participants in the theatrical event

As in the Riverside tradition of the ''Greenshow'', the production of ''The Mandrake'' – whether indoors or outside in a park – relied on broad physicalization, improvisation, and comic [[lazzi]], as well as interacting with the audience in the manner of Commedia dell'arte.  ''The Mandrake'', under Southern's direction, proved one of Riverside's most successful ''Commedia'' productions to date, and helped the company to realize its goal of bringing the work of Shakespeare, his contemporaries and Commedia dell'arte to as broad an audience as possible.  It also helped to further the reputation of the company as a versatile classical theatre company in New York City.

Early in the summer of 1980, the Riverside Shakespeare Company moved into residence in West Park Presbyterian Church, at the corner of West 86th and Amsterdam, where it established [[The Shakespeare Center]], dedicated to the year round training for the performance of the works of Shakespeare, his contemporaries, and Commedia dell'arte. Professional actor Andrew Achsen played a key role in securing the site in the church, of which he was a member, together with the pastor of West Park, Rev. Robert Davidson.  The Theatre of The Shakespeare Center was reconstructed from materials from the demolition of Broadway's [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Helen Hayes Theatre]] and the set of Broadway's ''[[Nicholas Nickleby (play)|Nicholas Nickleby]]'' through funds raised by efforts of cast members from the Broadway production of ''Nicholas Nickleby'' from the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]. The Shakespeare Center of the Riverside Shakespeare Company was officially dedicated in the fall of 1982 by [[Joseph Papp]] and [[Helen Hayes]] in a ceremony attended by [[Gloria Foster]], [[Milo O'Shea]], [[Barnard Hughes]], [[Sam Waterston]], [[Mildred Natwick]], and [[Peter Brook]].&lt;ref&gt;"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand", by Patricia O'Haire, ''The New York Daily News'', Sep 13, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The church, West Park Presbyterian Churck, where The Shakespeare Center was established will quite possibly be renovated or demolished, to make room for a new high rise apartment building.  See "Controversy over Condo Development at Church", in ''The New York Times'', Sunday, March 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
The Shakespeare Center became the home for numerous Equity Riverside productions, beginning with ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' in 1980, directed by W. Stuart McDowell, assisted by Jay King, with Robert Walsh, Arleigh Richards, George House, Barbara Tirrell, Joe Meek, Gay Reed, Curtis Watkins, Dan Johnson, Obie Story, James McGuire, Jim Maxson, Christopher Cull, Timothy Oman, and, as the Nurse, Scottish folk singer and comedian Fredi Dundee.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:RIVERSIDE-HENRY-V-2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''Henry V'': Frank Muller, Lee Croghan, 1984.]] --&gt;

''Romeo &amp; Juliet'' was followed by ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' with Freda Kavanagh, Deanna Deignan, Kay Colburn and Catherine Schmidt, and J. C. Hoyt, Timothy Doyle, Timothy Oman, [[Madeleine Potter]], and Peter Siiteri, directed by Clingerman with music by Deborah Awner, which [[Mel Gussow]] of the ''New York Times'' called "a charming chamber piece."&lt;ref&gt;Review by Mel Gussow, ''The New York Times'', May 10, 1981, and "Shakespeare in New York City", by Maurice Charney and Arthur Ganz, ''The Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol. 33, No. 2 (Summer, 1982), pp. 218–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed by a Commedia dell'arte production of ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'' directed by Dan Southern produced [[Off Broadway]] in the American Theatre for Actors, with music by Bob Rosen, with Ronald Lew Harris, Jim Maxson, Joe Meek, Amy Aquino, Allison Edwards, Dennis Pfister, and J. C. Hoit.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', August 3, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the company produced a subscription season in 1980–1981 at The Shakespeare Center, it also mounted a series of free performances of Shakespeare plays and scenes across town at the Citicorp Center, entitled ''Riverside Shakespeare Salutes Shakespeare at Citicorp'', which included ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' directed by Jere O'Donnell, ''Love's Labour's Lost'' directed by Timothy Minor, ''The Will to Power: Scenes of Ambition and Political Intrigue'', directed by Ken Grantham, and a popular compilation of romantic scenes from the Bard, ''This Bud of Love: Scenes of Awakening Love'', directed by John Clingerman.  These were also broadcast on New York's public radio station, [[WBAI]].

Meanwhile at ''The Shakespeare Center'', the company opened its next season with ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' directed by Timothy Oman, assisted by Linda Mason, associate director, and Maureen Clarke, Riverside's resident text coach, with music by Sanchie Borrow, scenic and lighting design by Norbert U. Kolb, fight direction by Conal O'Brien, and costumes by David Pearson, featuring [http://www.frankmullerhome.com/photos.html Frank Muller] and Lee Croghan, with Dene Nardi, Norma Fire, Ronald Lew Harris, Pat Kennerly, Gay Reed, and Gene Santarelli.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', May 6, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York premiere of ''The Three Cuckolds''===
In February 1981 the company mounted the New York Premiere of the Commedia dell'arte farce ''The Three Cuckolds'' with Perla Armanasco, Jim Brewster, Ronald Lew Harris, David Murray Jaffe, Joe Meek, Jim Maxson, and Jane Badgers, Lloyd Davis, Jr. (as an "outstanding" Arlecchino),&lt;ref name="Marily Stasio 1981"&gt;"Delightful Cuckolds" by Marily Stasio, ''The New York Post'', February 11, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Oded Carmi and Marla Buck, directed by Dan Southern with an original score by Michael Canick, sepia drops depicting contemporary New York street scenes by Dorian Vernacchio costumes by Barbara Weiss and masks by Paul Mantell, about which [[Marilyn Stasio]] of the ''New York Post'' wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The resident company under Daniel O. Smith's stage direction, has enthusiastically caught the outrageous spirit of that venerable theater form.... The stock characters of ''commedia'' – from the bulbous-nosed clowns, the ''zanni'', to that nimble trickster Arlecchino – are all authentically masked, padded and caricatured.  And the cast's high level of comic energy makes them perfectly ridiculous.... In keeping with the improvisational tradition of ''commedia'', the production injects a contemporary tone into the material ... including a graffiti mural, which is wittier than the stuff you read on the IRT.  And somebody tossed off a Nancy Reagan joke that tickled me.&lt;ref name="Marily Stasio 1981"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The production of ''The Three Cuckolds'' was performed in a broad farcical style with numerous contemporary references, and extensive use of acrobatics, such as a backflip performed by Jim Brewster on his entrance as the young lover.  ''The Three Cuckolds'' proved so popular,&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Post'', February 11, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; that it was later mounted as an [[Off Broadway]] touring production, and was the first Riverside production seen by Joseph Papp, leading eventually to an ongoing sponsorship by the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] beginning with ''Edward II'' (see below), and subsequent Riverside summer touring productions.

===New York premiere of Brecht's ''The Life of Edward II of England''===
{{See also|The Life of Edward II of England}}

Beginning in 1982 [[Joseph Papp]] and the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] became the principal sponsors of the company, starting with the Riverside Shakespeare Company's production of the New York Premiere of [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s adaptation of [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[The Life of Edward II of England]]'' in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;"Brecht; Another Production", ''The New York Times'', February 6, 2000.  The New York premiere was authorized by [[Stefan Brecht]] and by Bertha Case, literary representative for the Brecht estate in America, in 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; also sponsored by the [[Goethe House]] of New York, and by Marta Feuchtwanger (widow of Brecht's acknowledged co-author [[Lion Feuchtwanger]]&lt;ref&gt;"I wrote this play with Lion Feuchtwanger"; Dedication page from ''Leben Eduards des Zweiten von England'', 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The New York premiere of ''Edward II'' was grounded on interviews McDowell had made in Germany with cast members – [[Erwin Faber]] and Hans Schweikart – of the original Munich production of 1924, which had been Brecht's debut as stage director.  In the original 1924 production, Brecht developed many of his "new staging and dramaturgical techniques" for what came to be known as [[epic theatre]], and which eventually profoundly impacted 20th century theatre.&lt;ref&gt;John Willett, ''The Theatre of Bertolt Brecht: A Study from Eight Aspects''. Third rev. ed. (Methuen, 1967) 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Elements from Brecht's original production became a springboard for interpreting the script, seventy-eight years later.&lt;ref&gt;See "Acting Brecht: The Munich Years", by W. Stuart McDowell, in ''The Brecht Sourcebook'', Carol Martin, Henry Bial, editors (Routledge, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Riverside Shakespeare production featured an original score composed by Michael Canick for percussion and played by percussionist Noel Council above and to the side of the audience in the side tower that had been erected within the theatre of [[The Shakespeare Center]] of the newly renovated theatre.  The score made use of snare and kettledrums, of xylophones and castanets, as well as natural percussion sounds made by the cast, using rattles and hand-held pea-pods played during the transitions between scenes, all intended to give an environment of sound intended to augment and draw focus to various narrative lines throughout the production.

[[Image:RIVERSIDE SHAKESPEARE EDWARD II 15 SMALL.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''The Life of Edward II'' with Dan Southern and Timothy Oman, 1982.]]
The Riverside production of ''Edward II'' featured Dan Southern and Timothy Oman in the roles of Gaveston and King Edward, with Andrew Achsen, Larry Attille, Christopher Cull, Michael Franks, Margo Gruber, Dan Johnson, Joe Meek, Jason Moehring, Gay Reed, Count Stovall, Patrick Sullivan and Jeffery V. Thompson, directed by McDowell, with assistant director Jeannie H. Woods, with sets and lights by Dorian Vernacchio, costumes by David Robinson, with hand-hewn wooden props designed and built by Valerie Kuehn.

According to singer/writer [[William Warfield]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I've never seen a classical theatre production by this company before, and I thought it was truly exceptional.  As unimpassioned as most so-called entertainment is, the only saving grace is that artists still band together on honest endeavors, such as this.... ''Edward II'' was brilliant. ''Edward II'' was visually stunning, and imaginatively directed production of a play that has great relevance today.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warfield]], February 6, 1982, New York City; quoted with permission from the author.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Opening night, a special panel of scholars on German theatre and the drama of the Weimar Republic in particular was presented in the theatre before the play, including a display of photos from the original Munich production.  In keeping with Brecht's original production, a ''Weimar Cabaret'' followed the production, with cast member Andrew Achsen serving as host.

==Subscription season at the Shakespeare Center==

===''Richard III'' with brass and chorus===

The next season (1982–1983) in the newly renovated theatre on West 86th Street began with ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', about which Marilyn Stasio of ''The New York Post'' wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Riverside Shakespeare Company has opened its season with a ''Richard III'' that handsomely advances its suit for support as a year-round professional Shakespeare ensemble worth taking seriously.  The production has been mounted in observance of the 500th anniversary of that infamous monarch's feverish rise to power.  J. Kenneth Campbell makes his entrance hump-first, from an obviously symbolic hole in the ground, and grabs us from the moment he launches into his wintry discontents. Campbell not only loves his character, he loves his ''words'', articulating with the lusty relish of a voluptuary set loose in a seraglio.  It's a joy to watch him.&lt;ref&gt;"Campbell Conquers Richard III: Riverside's Richard III" by Marilyn Stasio, ''The New York Post'', November 16, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' was directed by John Clingerman, with an original musical score by Joe Church played by the ''New York City Brass Quintet'' and large chorus recorded especially for this production, about which ''Backstage'' wrote, "Particular mention should be made of the music, conducted by Joseph Church with the New York City Brass Quintet and a large chorus contributed to the fifteenth century ambience and aided in unifying the production.".&lt;ref&gt;Review by Murile Broadman in ''Backstage'', December 24, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production featured stage and screen veteran [[J. Kenneth Campbell]] in the title role, Marya Lowery, Richard Hoyt-Miller, Scott Parson, Maggie Scott, Mary McTigue, and Ann Ducati, sets by Tom Newman, costumes by Randolf Pearson, lighting by Richard Lund, extensive combat choreography by Joel Leffert, and stage managed by Mary Ellen Allison.

===The complete ''The Winter's Tale'' in a blizzard===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:THE WINTERS TALE 2.jpg|thumb|170px|''The Winter's Tale'' with [[Tonya Pinkins]], Beatrix Porter, Eric Hoffmann, and Scott Parson, 1983.]] --&gt;
In early 1983, Riverside Shakespeare Company mounted its third ''First Folio Production'', an uncut staging of ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', with Eric Hoffmann as Autolycus and Tony Award-winning actress [[Tonya Pinkins]] in her New York stage debut as "Mopsa – a shepherdess", with Marya Lowry and Timothy Oman as Hermione and Leontes, C. B. Anderson, Franklin Brown, Sally Kay Brown, Lee Croghan, Christopher Cull, Virginia Downing, Freda Kavanaugh, Beatrix Porter, and Richie Devaney.  The production was directed by W. Stuart McDowell, with costumes by Randolph Pearson, original music by Joseph Church, choreography by Beatrix Porter, text coaching by Maureen Clarke, and was stage managed by Mary Ellen Allison.

The production combined modern (Grace Kelly's Monaco) and historical (pastoral 18th century England) periods in a concept centered around a magical transformation that takes place when Mamillius begins to recount "the winter's tale" to his mother, Hermione.  The concept arose from the moment in the ''First Folio'' text when Mamillius is asked to "tell's a Tale," to which the boy responds with "There was a man ... dwelt by a Church-yard...."

According to the Riverside program, McDowell's interpretation posited that these eight words – the entirety of "the winter's tale" – are nothing less than a prophecy concerning Leontes, Mamillius' father, who would some day virtually dwell by a graveyard, mourning the passing of Hermione and Mamillius (Act III, Sc. ii. Leontes: "Once a day I'll visit/The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there/Shall be my recreation...") – whose deaths he causes in the subsequent parable told by Mamillius. Both Hermione and story-teller Mamillius (who also played the role of Time in the Riverside production) are resurrected magically at the play's end, as his "sad tale...best for Winter" draws to a conclusion, and the purpose of the lad's tale has been fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;The director noted in the program that "In searching for the meaning of the story that Mamillius starts to tell, but is interrupted by his half-crazed father, I could find none: no historical or dramaturgical resource revealed what exactly ''The Winter's Tale'' was, or who the man in the story was who 'dwelt by a Church-yard.'  At the same time, I found it fascinating – although undoubtedly a curious accident – that Mamillius's 'Tale for Winter' begins at the top of a new page turn in the ''First Folio'', as if the playwright – several years after his death – is somehow telling us of a transformative moment in this, one of the Bard's most fantastical tales.  That's when it occurred to me that the man who dwelt by a churchyard was none other than the father, Leontes, grieving the prophesied loss of his wife and son.  The rest of the play, from that moment on, is Mamillius' prophesy, a 'sad tale' that's 'best for Winter'." Program for the Riverside Shakespeare Company production of ''The Winter's Tale'', February 25, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

During rehearsals for ''The Winter's Tale'' the company was virtually stranded in the theatre during the blizzard that hit New York City in mid-February 1983.  The technical crew building the set had to spend the night in [[The Shakespeare Center]], marooned there while they finished the elaborate, magical stage for production.  Fortunately, the deli just outside the theatre – [[Barney Greengrass]]: "the Sturgeon King" – was open the next day, providing the crew with bagels and coffee in the morning.  Shakespeare's tale of Winter proved a fitting production for New York's year-round Shakespeare company to be socked in while the city nearly ground to a halt.

After the opening on February 24, Riverside's ''The Winter's Tale'' was broadcast on New York's [[WBAI]], before which it was described as, "An exceptional production of one of the Bard's seldom-produced scripts...brilliant."&lt;ref&gt;''WBAI'' broadcast, February 23, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the ''New York Shakespeare Bulletin'' it was observed that "Riverside's responsible rendering of the text should win them a ''Julio Romano'' statue that will never walk away."&lt;ref&gt;"Sunny Winter", in ''The New York Shakespeare Society Bulletin'', March 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Taming of the Shrew''===
[[Image:RIVERSIDE-SHREW-3.jpg|thumb|right|160px|''Taming of the Shrew'', Diane Ciesla, Dan Southern, 1983]]
Later that year the company mounted ''[[Taming of the Shrew]]'' in 1983 directed by Robert Mooney with music by Joseph Church and set designs by Kevin Lee Allen, with Diane Ciesla and Dan Southern, and Ronald Lew Harris, Eric Hoffmann, Joe Meek, and Robert Mooney.  About this production, Sy Isenberg of ''Bulletin of the New York Shakespeare Society'' wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This production of ''The Taming of the Shrew'' really cares...I cannot think of a piece in recent memory that has been so deliciously cast.  The whole cast is swimmingly on their toes.  As the primary lovers not meant for each other Diane Ciesla and Daniel Southern are dazzling...The couple's subsequent extravagances are part of a complicated mating dance at once witty, slapstick and tender, balanced at the end between ritual and reality. In its warmth, elegance and festivity, this ''Kate'' kisses us all.&lt;ref&gt;"''The Taming of the Shrew'': A Review", by Sy Isenberg, ''Bulletin of the New York Shakespeare Society'', May 1983, Vol. 1, No. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''The Tempest'' with Bertram Ross===
The next season opened with a full stage production of ''[[The Tempest]]'' with Bertram Ross – longtime leading dance partner with [[Martha Graham]] and co-director of the Graham dance company&lt;ref&gt;Bertram Ross's background as Martha Graham's partner and co-director of her company for nearly 25 years earned him a position of enviable stature in the world of dance. He created over 35 leading roles in the Graham repertory and is indelibly associated with the roles of Saint Michael in "Seraphic Dialogue", Agamemnon and Orestes in "Clytemnestra", Adam in "Embattled Garden", Oedipus in "Night Journey" and, perhaps most of all, the Preacher in "Appalachian Spring." Mr. Ross' accomplishments in dance have been acknowledged by critics and audiences around the globe. See "SAD NEWS – Bertram Ross Passes After Long Illness", on ''Stu Hamstra's Hotline'', April 20, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; – as Prospero, and featuring Eric Hoffmann, Ronald Lew Harris, Joe Meek, Kathleen Bishop, Ellen Cleghorne, Alexander Cook, Herman Petras, John Reese, and Laurine Towler as Ariel, directed by Robert Mooney, with dance choreography by Shela Xoregos set to music by Joe Church, and sets by Kevin Lee Allen. Bertram Ross, who has been called the "dance legend and archetype male Graham dancer", used his considerable dance experience and technique and deep voice to create a memorable Prospero, using movement choreographed by Xoregos, who molded Prospero and Ariel into a "moving duo of poetic form."&lt;ref&gt;"When a 'Saint' Emanated Threads of Light", Peter Sparling, ''The Dance Insider'', April 22, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern dress ''CAESAR!'' and historic ''The History of King Lear''===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:CAESAR POSTER 10 small.jpg|thumb|200px|'' CAESAR!'' with Herman Petras as Caesar, 1984]] --&gt;
In 1984 the company presented a [[modern dress]] version of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', entitled ''CAESAR!'' set in contemporary Washington, directed by McDowell, inspired by interviews conducted with company members of Orson Welles's famous 1937 Broadway production of ''[[Caesar (Mercury Theatre)|Caesar]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Interviews were conducted by the director, W. Stuart McDowell, with [[Stefan Schnabel]], cast member in Orson Welles' ''Julius Caesar'', and [[Sam Leve]], set designer for Welles' famous "Fascist" production of 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; with set by Kevin Lee Allen, with Assistant Director Maureen Clarke and Jane Badgers, director of marketing &amp; P.R, and featuring music by Michael Canick.

The production featured [[Obie Award]]–winner [[Harold Scott, Director|Harold Scott]],&lt;ref&gt;For a biography of this distinguished stage actor and director, see [[Harold Scott, Director]].&lt;/ref&gt; and Marya Lowry, with Michael Cook, Andy Achsen, Ronald Lew Harris, Paul Hebron, Sonja Lanzener, Jim Maxson, Joe Meek, Robert Walsh and Herman Petras as Caesar.

The production proved immensely popular with audiences, setting, as it did, Shakespeare's play in contemporary Washington, D.C. in a country on the verge of making its popular leader president for life. The production of ''CAESAR'', revised, was subsequently optioned by [[Samuel H. Scripps]] for a Broadway production at the Virginia Theatre, scheduled to premiere on the 50th anniversary of the Mercury Theatre production, on November 11, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;See Harry Haun, ''The New York Daily News'', June 24, 1987: "Something else to look forward to in '88 is an election year reading of Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar.'' Just as Orson Welles played it contemporary (Mussolini's Italy) in his historic Mercury production of '38, director Stuart McDowell will move the play forward another 50 years, setting against a backdrop of the '88 campaigns.  It's for Broadway, and there've been ongoing discussions with [[Ellen Burstyn]], [[Philip Bosco]], [[Treat Williams]], [[Ossie Davis]], et al. to participate in this all-star edition.  Rehearsals start September 22..." See also "Season Preview: Theatre, Epic Legends, American Accents", by Mel Gussow, ''The New York Times'', August 30, 1987.  The Broadway remounting of this production, sponsored and designed by [[Samuel H. Scripps]], under the General Management of Kevin Dowling, with verse and text work by [[Cicely Berry]] and directed by W. Stuart McDowell, did not take place.  Instead, in the same season, the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] inaugurated its Shakespeare Marathon [[Off Broadway]], with an historical toga-clad production of ''Julius Caesar'' with [[Martin Sheen]] as Brutus, and [[Al Pacino]] as Marc Antony.&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan for the production was reflected on its poster:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''It's America.''&lt;br/&gt;
''It's 1984.''&lt;br/&gt;
''It's the political horror show for our times.''&lt;ref&gt;From the Riverside Shakespeare Company poster, (above) 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Responding to the production, Sy Syna of ''The New York Tribune'' wrote: "Riverside's ''CAESAR!'' is not only a rock solid production, it is surprisingly a good one."&lt;ref&gt;Sy Syna, ''The New York Tribune'', March 14, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  Reviewing the Riverside production, Herbert Mitgang of the ''New York Times'' wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The famous Mercury Theater production of ''Julius Caesar'' in modern dress staged by [[Orson Welles]] in 1937 was designed to make audiences think of Mussolini's Blackshirts – and it did. The Riverside Shakespeare Company's lively production makes you think of timeless ambition and anti-libertarians anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Mitgang, "Stage: Modern Caesar", ''The New York Times'', March 14, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''The History of King Lear''===
In 1985 the Riverside Shakespeare Company presented the New York premiere of ''[[The History of King Lear]]'', adapted with a happy ending by 18th-century English Poet Laureate, [[Nahum Tate]], from William Shakespeare's ''[[King Lear]]''.  The production was directed by W. Stuart McDowell, produced by Andrew B. Harris, who had joined Riverside as its executive director at the beginning of the season.

The production featured a complete, original score for harpsichord and orchestra by John Aschenbrenner, fights choreographed by Richard Raether, lighting by Sam Scripps, and a period wind machine in the wings.  The Riverside production displayed a harpsichord to one side, as if in the wings, and a wind machine to the other – both visible to the audience.

Tate's adaptation of ''The History of King Lear'', which restored the authentic legend of the ancient king, was written without a Fool, added a confidante and a romance for Cordelia and Edgar, and culminated with the triumph of good over evil with the restoration of Lear to the throne with Kent and Gloucester at his side, and the marriage of Cordelia to Edgar.

Like Tate's other immensely popular "happy ending" version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (which was a central part of the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of ''[[Nicholas Nickleby (play)|Nicholas Nickleby]]'') Tate's equally popular adaptation of Shakespeare's ''King Lear'' was the only performed version of ''King Lear'' for over 150 years, beginning in the late 17th century when Tate wrote his adaptation, through the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Wells]], "Introduction" from ''King Lear'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2000, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riverside mounted this historical piece in an 18th-century setting, with authentic period costumes by Ellen Seeling on a set designed by Norbert Kolb.  The production featured Barbara Tirrell, [http://www.frankmullerhome.com/photos.html Frank Muller] and Margo Gruber as Goneril, Edmund and Regan, with Eric Hoffmann as Lear, Dan Daily as Kent, Freda Kavanagh as Cordelia, Don Fischer as Edgard, and Saunder Finard, Sandra Protor Gray, Buck Hobbs, E. F. Morrill, Gene Santarelli, and Richard Willis.&lt;ref&gt;"Tate's ''Lear'' at Riverside", by Mel Gussow, ''The New York Times'', April 5, 1985, and "''King Lear'' for Optimists", by Howard Kissel, ''Women's Wear Daily'', March 22, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reviewer for ''The New York City Tribune'' wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Riverside Shakespeare production of ''The History of King Lear'' includes a raked stage designed by Norbert Kolb, gorgeous costumes by Ellen Seeling, a visible stage hand operating the wind machine and handing on props, a maestro conducting John Aschenbrenner's lively score composed mostly for harpsichord with several interpolated songs including one by Garrick, and a whole panoply of 18th century theater devices, including a hysterical use of tableaux to open and close scenes, and hilarious [[asides]] including one when Edmund (deliciously played by Frank Muller) is hard at it with one of the rival sisters.... Shakespearean adaptations occur in any era.  This one, besides putting a leer in ''Lear'' was a helluva lot of fun!&lt;ref&gt;"Tate gives happy ending to bard's tragic saga" by Sy Syna, ''The New York City Tribune'', Wednesday, March 20, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Riverside Shakespeare tours produced by Joseph Papp==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:COMEDY-OF-ERRORS-POSTER-4.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Comedy of Errors'': Connor Smith, Andrew Achsen, 1982]] --&gt;

In 1982, Riverside Shakespeare Company began a series of expanded tours of Free Summer Shakespeare made possible through sponsorship by [[Joseph Papp]] and the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]].  These were all produced under an [[Off Broadway]] contract with the [[Actors' Equity Association]], and, with broadened marketing, proved exceedingly popular with audiences at these extended venues.

===''The Comedy of Errors''===
The first of these was a tour – to twelve different parks in four boroughs – of Shakespeare's raucous ''[[A Comedy of Errors]]'' directed by Gloria Skurski, with costumes by Barbara Weiss, on a touring set designed by Dorian Vernacchio.  The cast featured Connor Smith and Andrew Achsen, and Ronald Lew Harris, Karen Jackson, Dan Johnson, Erin Lanagan, Trip Plymale, Mel Winkler and Dan Woods. The production featured a magician, a belly dancer accompanied by a lively percussion score composed and played by Michael Canick, and a very broad comedic performance style that proved extremely popular with its audiences. Opening night Joseph Papp arrived with an enormous basket of fruit for the cast to thank them for their performance in 90 degree heat.&lt;ref&gt;See "Welcome to the Public Theater, [http://www.publictheater.org/view.php?mode=eventdisplay&amp;eventid=525&amp;past=1&amp;returnURL=%2Fcelebrating%2Fpast_view.php%3Fdecade%3D1980 Comedie of Errors, The (1982)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The Basin Street Bard"===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:RIVERSIDE GREENSHOW MERRY WIVES FINAL 1983.jpg|thumb|150px|''The Merry Wives of Windsor'': [[Anna Deavere Smith]], Joseph Reed, 1983]] --&gt;
The following summer the company mounted a music-filled production of ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' set in old, post-Civil War New Orleans and directed by Timothy Oman, with Maureen Clarke as assistant director, featuring ragtime music by Deena Kaye.  The cast featured [[Anna Deavere Smith]] in her New York stage debut playing Mistress Quickly as a "Cajun voodoo woman"&lt;ref&gt;"''Wives of Windsor'' make merry in city parks", by Patricia O'Haire, ''The New York Daily News'', July 26, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; and Joseph Reed as Falstaff, with Douglas Broyles, Dan Daily, Norma Fire, Paul Hebron, Michael Landsman, Sonja Lanzener, Warren Sweeney, Shelly Desai, and stage managed by Mary Ellen Allison.&lt;ref&gt;See "Welcome to the Public Theater". [http://www.publictheater.org/view.php?mode=eventdisplay&amp;eventid=552&amp;past=1&amp;returnURL=%2Fcelebrating%2Fpast_view.php%3Fdecade%3D1980 Merry Wives of Windsor, The (1983)].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hands of composer and keyboard player Deena Kaye, the Riverside production of ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' verged on becoming a full-fledged musical, with numerous tunes played by the ragtime band.  According to Nan Robertson in ''The New York Times'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;An eight piece ragtime band and Mardi Gras high jinks underscored the slapstick performance, which sometimes evoked the spastic look and ricky-tick musical accompaniment of a very early silent flicker movie.  The cast is costumed as 19th-century Southern belles, beaux and bums, the last group being the disreputable lecherous but appealing Falstaff.  During the intermission, a barroom quartet singing "A Woman is only a Woman, but a Good Cigar is a Smoke" brought down the house.... This is the second season under the aegis of Joseph Papp.... The company is now calling its production of ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' an "evening with the Basin Street Bard."&lt;ref&gt;"'The Merry Wahvs of Windzuh' [sic] Tours City", by Nan Robertson, ''The New York Times'', July 15, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Clive Barnes]], in his first review of a Riverside Shakespeare production, wrote in the ''New York Post'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Riverside Shakespeare owes its name to the fact that it started operations in Riverside Park, so it was a sort of homecoming for them when I caught the company in a glade in that park just by 82nd Street...The production is modern and carefree – the kind of innovative Shakespeare that [Joseph] Papp himself favors, and appropriate for a bright summer evening, with people [[Squatting position|squatting]] on the grass, many of them enjoying an alfresco picnic.  Director Timothy Oman has placed the play in New Orleans soon after the Civil War.  The idea works quite well.  The play is preceded by a sort of Mardi Gras revel, and in the intermission we are regaled with a few vaudeville songs of the period, including a somewhat odd barbershop quartet.... This is one of the most purely farcical of Shakespeare's plays, and it stands up well to the present knockabout, roustabout treatment it receives from these Riverside players.&lt;ref&gt;"Merry wives cavort in Riverside Park" by Clive Barnes, ''New York Post'', July 26, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:RIVERSIDE GREENSHOW MERRY WIVES RIGHT REVISED 1983.jpg|thumb|right|110px|''Greenshow'', 1983]]

===The Riverside Greenshow===
For each of these summer tours sponsored by [[Joseph Papp]] and the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]], the traditional ''Greenshow''  performed before each outdoor touring production—which involved live musicians and the entire cast often performing Commedia-like spoofs of the performance to follow – became the festive call of the audience to the stage, and an important part of Riverside's performance tradition.

===''Romeo and Juliet'' on the mobile stage===
The next summer, in 1984, the Riverside Shakespeare Company mounted a summer parks tour of its third production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' directed by John Clingerman with music by Michael Roth played by percussionist David Nicholson, fight choreography by Robert Walsh, on a set designed by Kevin Lee Allen and costumes by Cecilia A. Frederichs, with Michael Golding, Constance Boardman, Saul Stein, Todd Jamieson and Jeff Shoemaker.

[[Image:RIVERSIDE R&amp;J 2004 POSTER 2 SMALL.jpg|thumb|100px|Poster for the 1984 5-borough Parks Tour]]

It takes six stagehands using hydraulic lift and plenty of muscle, several hours to rig the contents into the Verona of Shakespeare's love-stricken youth.... "It's sunset Shakespeare", said W. Stuart McDowell, the Riverside's artistic director, "designed to be performed in natural light the way it was in Shakespeare's time."&lt;ref name="Shakespeare 1984"&gt;"On the Road again, with free Shakespeare", Paul D. Colford, ''Newsday'', June 11, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The production opened at the Bandshell in New York's [[Central Park]] to an audience estimated at over a thousand (according to ''Newsday'').&lt;ref&gt;Above article in ''Newsday'', June 11, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first time Riverside Shakespeare Company had ventured into New York's [[Central Park]] – the traditional territory of the New York Shakespeare Festival. Opening on June 6, 1984 saw a "Gala Benefit" hosted by [[Lucille Lortel]], Richard Horner and Lynne Stuart. Opening night, [[Joseph Papp]] joined W. Stuart McDowell on the touring stage, and inaugurated the five borough tour in a special ceremony in which Mr. Papp compared Riverside's tour with the former tours of the NYSF:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They're a marvelous bunch of actors.  And they have what it takes for this sort of thing—They carry things on their backs...We used to make deals with local gangs.  One time I remember well.  I told this kid that he had to move because he was backstage.  He said to me, "This ain't backstage; it's first base!"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in the above ''Newsday'' article, June 11, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The old mobile unit could not withstand the rigors of a month-long, outdoor tour of transporting "fair Verona" to the five boroughs of New York City. The second weekend, the {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on}} long mobile unit dropped its rear axle at the intersection of 42nd and 9th while the truck was crossing midtown Manhattan.  The mobile unit had to be permanently retired, but the tour continued with select pieces of scenery, such as Juliet's balcony, and the production continued to play to exceptionally large audiences across the five boroughs.&lt;ref name="Shakespeare 1984"/&gt;

===''The Taming of the Shrew''===
In 1985, the company mounted a very Italian version of ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' with music by Frank Lindquist, and a set design by Kevin Lee Allen and costumes by Howard Behar, with Norma Fire, Paul Hebron, Sonja Lanzener, David Adamson, Paul Hebron, Vincent Niemann, Gene Santarelli, Laurine Towler, Joseph Reed, Michael Preston, and David Carlyon, who was also Clown Master. It was directed by Maureen Clarke, who during these years had been serving as Resident Text Coach for the company. Opening night was rained-out – a condition surprisingly encountered by Riverside tours only infrequently; the opening night performance was played in the main sanctuary of West Park Presbyterian Church.  ''Shrew'' then went on to tour all five boroughs in blazing heat, attracting large audiences for this lively show.&lt;ref&gt;See "Welcome to the Public Theater".

==The Riverside School for Shakespeare and the First Folio==
[[Image:RIVERSIDE SHAKESPEARE COMPANY RAUL JULIA 1983 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Raúl Juliá]] at the Riverside School for Shakespeare, 1983]]

To train actors, directors, and teachers in the performance of the classic text of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, the company began its professional training program, The Riverside School for Shakespeare, in the fall of 1980, at [[The Shakespeare Center]], headed by John Clingerman.

Actor training classes were offered by company members with professional performance experience and training in the classics: in verse, [[stage combat]], movement and Commedia dell'arte.  Among the teaching staff were Marya Lowery, Robert Walsh, Maureen Clarke, Eric Hoffmann, Joel Leffert, John Carroll, Robert Mooney, Peter Siiteri, Dan Southern and Timothy Oman.  Numerous special guests offered workshops, such as [[Raúl Juliá]], [[Barnard Hughes]], [[Roger Rees]], and [[Paul Rogers (actor)|Paul Rogers]].

The Riverside Shakespeare Company also began to host residencies for actor training with verse by noted Shakespeare teachers [[Cicely Berry]] (in her first such workshops in New York City), and Patrick Tucker from the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] for training American actors in use of Shakespeare's [[First Folio]] as a cornerstone of professional stage performance.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Tucker, the author of ''Secrets of Acting Shakespeare: The Original Approach'' (Routledge Press, November 2001), brought his first ''Acting Shakespeare'' workshop to New York City in the early 1980s, hosted by the Riverside Shakespeare Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Backstage'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Initiated in the fall of 1980, The Riverside School for Shakespeare has been expanded to train actors in areas of Renaissance language, thought, movement as well as stage combat and other Renaissance performance styles, focusing on the preparation of the serious professional actor for the performance of Shakespearean and other Renaissance dramas.  The RSC actor training program has been set up by RSC's Artistic Director, W. Stuart McDowell, and by the program's director, John Clingerman.  The courses will cover the breadth of Renaissance stage acting, offered by a staff of instructors with professional experience gained through work with the only Shakespeare company performing year-round in N.Y.C.&lt;ref&gt;''Backstage'', March 13, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The First Folio===
It has been acknowledged (in the Introduction to first popular paperback reissue of Shakespeare's [[First Folio]]) that Patrick Tucker's intensive workshops first produced in New York by the Riverside Shakespeare Company in 1982 lead to a resurgence of interest in the First Folio by actors, teachers and directors in New York City, and to an awakening to the possibilities of playing Shakespeare from cue scripts, eventually leading to the popular reissue of Folio texts now widely used in this country.&lt;ref&gt;''The First Folio of Shakespeare'', Introduction by Doug Mostin, Applause Books, 1995, p. vii.  Also see [[First Folio]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Shakespeare Project''==

[[Image:RIVERSIDE SHAKESPEARE PROJECT 3.jpg|thumb|140px|[[The Shakespeare Project|Shakespeare Project]], C. Ravenscroft, 1983]]

In October 1983, the Riverside Shakespeare Company launched [[The Shakespeare Project]], New York City's first major residency of actors from the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] – with Edwin Richfield (of the RSC's highly acclaimed ''The Greeks''), Heather Canning (of [[Paul Scofield]]'s ''Macbeth''), Christopher Ravenscroft (from the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''[[Nicholas Nickleby (play)|Nicholas Nickleby]]'', Jennie Stoller and John Kane (the later two from [[Peter Brook]]'s landmark production of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'') – conducting workshops and seminars and performing ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', Dylan Thomas' ''[[Under Milk Wood]]'', and the New York premiere of [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''The Tarnished Phoenix'', with a host committee of Henry Guettel, Leonard Bernstein, José Ferrer, Helen Hayes, Bernard Hughes, Bernard Jacobs, John V. Lindsay, Joshua Logan, and George Plimpton.

As [[Christopher Ravenscroft]] said on opening night of [[The Shakespeare Project]], "I would really like to tell the Americans that they already have the talent and the technique.  All they need is the practice to take the horror out of Shakespeare."&lt;ref&gt;"Riverside Opens Its Shakespeare Center", by Marily Stasio, ''The New York Post'', October 22, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

During these years, the Riverside Shakespeare Company and The Shakespeare Center gained support from numerous major benefits staged for the theatre company by [[Jeremy Irons]], [[Sinéad Cusack]], [[Roger Rees]], [[Nicol Williamson]], [[Andre Gregory]], [[Raúl Juliá]], [[Jim Dale]], and by Tony Award-nominee [[Edward Petherbridge]], (from the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s ''[[Nicholas Nickleby (play)|Nicholas Nickleby]]'') in his one-person show, ''Acting Natural''. In the early 1980s, Riverside's board of directors was headed by Judith Radasch, followed by  Donna Lindsay-Goodwin.  Riverside's Advisory Board during this period included Shakespeare scholars Dr. Marvin Rosenberg and Dr. Bernard Beckerman, as well as noted stage directors and actors Zoe Caldwell, José Ferrer, Ruth Gordon, Helen Hayes, John Hirsch, Barnard Hughes, Mary Beth Hurt, Raúl Juliá, Garson Kannin, Stacey Keach, Joshua Logan, Mildred Natwick, Trevor Nunn, Roger Rees, Milo O'Shea, Sam Waterston and Joanne Woodward.

==Riverside presents ''A Christmas Carol'' with Helen Hayes==
[[Image:RIVERSIDE SHAKESPEARE COMPANY A CHRISTMAS CAROL WITH HELEN HAYES 1985 SMALL.jpg|thumb|right|90px|[[Helen Hayes]], ''Christmas Carol'']]
In 1985, [[Helen Hayes]] appeared in an all-star benefit performance for the Riverside Shakespeare Company of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', with Miss Hayes in her return to the New York stage as Narrator, featuring [[Len Cariou]] as Scrooge, [[Bille Brown]] of the Royal Shakespeare Company, MacIntyre Dixon, [[Celeste Holm]], [[Raúl Juliá]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Harold Scott, Director|Harold Scott]], [[Carole Shelley]], and [[Fritz Weaver]], staged with an original score for the Brass Quintet by W. Stuart McDowell, sung by the Children's Choir from the Anglo-American School of Manhattan, and an original script by Bille Brown, at the [[Symphony Space]] on the Upper Westside of Manhattan.

In 1986 the popular benefit presentation of ''A Christmas Carol'' was remounted, again with [[Helen Hayes]], at the [[Marquis Theatre]] on Broadway, featuring [[F. Murray Abraham]] as Scrooge, with [[Ossie Davis]], [[June Havoc]], [[Rex Smith]], [[Jean Marsh]], MacIntyre Dixon, [[Alec Baldwin]], and the choir of the Anglo-American School, produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small.&lt;ref&gt;"F. Murray Abraham To Say, 'Bah, Humbug'", ''New York Times'', November 27, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

===And beyond===
W. Stuart McDowell&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wright.edu/tdmp/mcdowell/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; left Riverside in 1986 to found McDowell/Scripps Productions with arts benefactor, [[Samuel H. Scripps]], and is now Chair of the Department of Theatre Dance and Motion Pictures at [[Wright State University]] in Dayton, Ohio. Gloria Skurski&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thinktv.org/education/educ_contact.html&lt;/ref&gt; went on to a career in television, joining the staff of [[CBS News]] as Associate Producer in 1984, and is now director of educational and broadcast services for PBS ThinkTV of Dayton Ohio.

Beginning in 1986, the Riverside Shakespeare Company was led by Robert Small, followed by Timothy W. Oman, who moved the company to permanent [[Off Broadway]] status at Playhouse 91, located on East 91st Street on the upper Eastside of [[Manhattan]], where it was subsequently led by Gus Kaikkonen.  In its second decade, until it disbanded in 1997, the Riverside Shakespeare Company produced a number of shows with distinguished actors and directors such as [[Henderson Forsythe]], [[Beth Fowler]], David Edward Jones, [[Charles Keating (actor)|Charles Keating]], Laurie Kennedy, [[Robert Sean Leonard]], [[Stephen McHattie]], [[Austin Pendleton]], and [[Stuart Vaughan]].

During its fifteenth year, the theatre company was praised in the weekly publication ''[[The Nation]]'' for producing "the most dependably accomplished performances of Shakespeare's plays regularly available in New York City."&lt;ref&gt;''The Nation'', September 27, 1991, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its twenty years of work as a theatre and educational training center, the Riverside Shakespeare Company presented over one hundred Equity productions, benefits and radio broadcasts of works by Shakespeare, Marlowe, Brecht, Machiavelli, and Shaw, as well as premieres of plays and Commedia dell'arte scenari.  Its educational programs provided training for hundreds of actors, directors and teachers and students.  Over its two decades Riverside productions were seen and heard by over one hundred thousand people throughout the five boroughs of New York City.

==Riverside Shakespeare reunion, 2008==
[[Image:RIVERSIDE REUNION GROUP PHOTO SMALL 3.jpg|thumb|right|160px|2008 reunion]]On March 24, 2008, the first annual reunion of former Riverside Shakespeare Company actors, directors, composers, and designers was held at the Marriott Marquis, in New York City.

Present at the reunion were company members Kevin Lee Allen, Kieron Murphy, Scott Parson, Jim Maxson, Gloria Skurski, Margo Gruber, W. Stuart McDowell, Michael Canick, Andrew Achsen, Herman Petras, Robert Mooney, Eric Hoffmann, and Dan Southern (aka Dan Smith).

Also present were Lisa Graham Parson, Pedro Ruiz, Cindy Ratzlaff, Charles Borkas, and photographer Claire McDowell.

'''Simone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|_|ˈ|b|oʊ|ˌ|v|w|ɑr}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/de_beauvoir,_simone|title=de Beauvoir, Simone|work=[[Oxford American Dictionary]]|access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|simɔn də bovwaʁ|lang|Fr-Simone de Beauvoir.ogg}}; 9 January 1908 – 14 April 1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]]. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both [[feminist existentialism]] and [[feminist theory]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford"&gt;Bergoffen, Debra, "Simone de Beauvoir", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and [[monograph]]s on philosophy, politics and social issues. She was known for her 1949 treatise ''[[The Second Sex]]'', a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary [[feminism]]; and for her novels, including ''[[She Came to Stay]]'' and ''[[The Mandarins]]''. She was also known for her lifelong relationship with French philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

==Early years==
===Family===
Simone de Beauvoir was born in Paris on 9 January 1908. Her parents were Georges Bertrand de Beauvoir, a legal secretary who once aspired to be an actor,&lt;ref name = "IEP Biography"&gt;Mussett, Shannon. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/beauvoir/#H1 Simone de Beauvoir Biography on the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]. Retrieved 11 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and Françoise de Beauvoir (née Brasseur), a wealthy banker's daughter and devout Catholic. Simone's sister, [[Hélène de Beauvoir|Hélène]], was born two years later. The family struggled to maintain their bourgeois status after losing much of their fortune shortly after [[World War I]], and Françoise insisted that the two daughters be sent to a prestigious convent school. De Beauvoir herself was deeply religious as a child, at one point intending to become a nun. She lost her faith in her early teens and remained an [[atheism|atheist]] for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name = Thurman&gt;Thurman, Judith. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/books/excerpt-introduction-second-sex.html Introduction to Simone de Beauvoir’s ''The Second Sex'']. Excerpt published in ''The New York Times'' 27 May 2010. Retrieved 11 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
De Beauvoir was intellectually precocious, fuelled by her father's encouragement; he reportedly would boast, "Simone thinks like a man!"&lt;ref&gt;Bair, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her family's straitened circumstances, de Beauvoir could no longer rely on her [[dowry]], and like other middle-class girls of her age, her marriage opportunities were put at risk. De Beauvoir took this opportunity to do what she always wanted to do while also taking steps to earn a living for herself.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"&gt;Roberts, Mary Louise. "Beauvoir, Simone de." In ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History''. Oxford University Press, 2008. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195148909.001.0001/acref-9780195148909-e-90 Source]. Retrieved 3 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

After passing baccalaureate exams in mathematics and philosophy in 1925, she studied mathematics at the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]] and literature/languages at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Institut Sainte-Marie|fr}}. She then studied philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and after completing her degree in 1928, she wrote her ''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis) on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] for [[Léon Brunschvicg]] (the topic was "Le concept chez Leibniz" ["The Concept in Leibniz"]).&lt;ref&gt;Margaret A. Simons (ed.), ''Feminist Interpretations of Simone de Beauvoir'', Penn State Press, Nov 1, 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; De Beauvoir was only the ninth woman to have received a degree from the Sorbonne at the time, due to the fact that French women had only recently been allowed to join higher education.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"/&gt;

De Beauvoir first worked with [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], when all three completed their practice teaching requirements at the same secondary school. Although not officially enrolled, she sat in on courses at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in preparation for the ''[[agrégation]]'' in philosophy, a highly competitive postgraduate examination which serves as a national ranking of students. It was while studying for the ''agrégation'' that she met ''École Normale'' students [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Paul Nizan]], and [[René Maheu]] (who gave her the lasting nickname "Castor", or beaver).&lt;ref name = "IEP Biography" /&gt;  The jury for the ''agrégation'' narrowly awarded Sartre first place instead of de Beauvoir, who placed second and, at age 21, was the youngest person ever to pass the exam.&lt;ref&gt;Menand, Louis. [http://www.newYorker.com/archive/2005/09/26/050926crbo_books?currentPage=all "Stand By Your Man"]. ''The New Yorker'', 26 September 2005. Retrieved 11 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing of her youth in ''Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter'' she said:
"...my father's individualism and pagan ethical standards were in complete contrast to the rigidly moral conventionalism of my mother's teaching. This disequilibrium, which made my life a kind of endless disputation, is the main reason why I became an intellectual."&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter'', Book One&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle years==
[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir at the Balzac Memorial]]
From 1929 to 1943, de Beauvoir taught at the [[lycée]] level until she could support herself solely on the earnings of her writings. She taught at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Montgrand|fr}} ([[Marseille]]), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Jeanne-d'Arc (Rouen)|fr}}, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Molière (Paris)|fr}} (1936–39).&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Oliver (ed.), ''French Feminism Reader'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2000, p. 1; ''Bulletin 2006 de l'Association amicale des anciens et anciennes élèves du lycée Molière'', 2006, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

During October 1929, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and de Beauvoir became a couple and, after they were confronted by her father, Sartre asked her to marry him.&lt;ref&gt;Bair, pp. 155–56&lt;/ref&gt; One day while they were sitting on a bench outside the Louvre, he said, "Let's sign a two-year lease".&lt;ref&gt;Bair, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of her life, de Beauvoir said, "Marriage was impossible. I had no dowry." So they entered a lifelong relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Bair, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/10/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety |location=London |work=The Guardian  | first=Lisa | last=Appignanesi | title=Our relationship was the greatest achievement of my life | date=10 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre and de Beauvoir always read each other's work. Debate continues about the extent to which they influenced each other in their existentialist works, such as Sartre's ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' and de Beauvoir's ''She Came to Stay'' and "Phenomenology and Intent". However, recent studies of de Beauvoir's work focus on influences other than Sartre, including [[G. W. F. Hegel|Hegel]] and Leibniz.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford" /&gt; The [[Neo-Hegelianism|Neo-Hegelian]] revival led by [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Jean Hyppolite]] in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers, including Beauvoir and Sartre, to discover Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Tidd, ''Simone de Beauvoir'', Psychology Press, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Bauer, ''Simone de Beauvoir: Philosophy, and Feminism'', Columbia University Press, 2012, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Nelson Algren NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Waist high portrait of middle aged man reading|Algren in 1956]]
Beginning in 1929, de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre were partners for fifty-one years until his death in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour-Jones 2008, p. Back cover&lt;/ref&gt; De Beauvoir chose never to marry or set up a joint household and she never had children. This gave her the time to advance her education and engage in political causes, to write and teach, and to have lovers.&lt;ref name=Schneir&gt;{{cite book|author=Schneir, Miriam|title=Feminism in Our Time|year=1994|publisher=Vintage Books|page=5|isbn=0-679-74508-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps her most famous lover was American author [[Nelson Algren]] whom she met in Chicago in 1947, and to whom she wrote across the Atlantic as "my beloved husband."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-09-27/entertainment/9809270154_1_beauvoir-novelist-nelson-algren-simone|title=Simone de Beauvoir's Love Letters to Nelson Algren|last=|first=|date=|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algren won the National Book Award for ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm (novel)|The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' in 1950, and in 1954, de Beauvoir won France's most prestigious literary prize for ''[[The Mandarins]]'' in which Algren is the character Lewis Brogan.

De Beauvoir was bisexual and her relationships with young women were controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rodgers, Nigel|author-link1=Nigel Rodgers|author2=Thompson, Mel|author-link2=Mel Thompson|title=Philosophers Behaving Badly|year=2004|publisher=London: [[Peter Owen Publishers]]|isbn=072061368X|page=~186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former student [[Bianca Lamblin]] (originally Bianca Bienenfeld) wrote in her book ''Mémoires d'une jeune fille dérangée'' (English: ''Memoirs of a Disturbed Young Lady''), that, while she was a student at Lycée Molière, she had been sexually exploited by her teacher de Beauvoir, who was in her 30s at the time.&lt;ref&gt;''Mémoires d'une jeune fille dérangée'' (1994, LGF – Livre de Poche; {{ISBN|978-2-253-13593-7}}/2006, Balland; {{ISBN|978-2-7158-0994-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1943, de Beauvoir was suspended from her teaching job, due to an accusation that she had seduced her 17-year-old lycée pupil [[Natalie Sorokin]]e in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;''Tête-à-tête: Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre'', Hazel Rowley, HarperCollins, 2005, pp. 130–35, {{ISBN|0-06-052059-0}};{{ISBN|978-0-06-052059-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorokine's parents laid formal charges against de Beauvoir for debauching a minor and as a result she had her license to teach in France permanently revoked.&lt;ref&gt;''Intellectuals: From Marx and Tolstoy to Sartre and Chomsky'', Paul Johnson, Harper Perennial, 1988, pp. 238–38, {{ISBN|978-0-06-125317-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable works==

===''She Came to Stay''===
De Beauvoir published her first novel ''[[She Came to Stay]]'' in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/beauvoir/|title=Beauvoir, Simone de {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a fictionalised chronicle of her and Sartre's sexual relationship with [[Olga Kosakiewicz]] and [[Wanda Kosakiewicz]]. Olga was one of her students in the Rouen secondary school where de Beauvoir taught during the early 1930s. She grew fond of Olga. Sartre tried to pursue Olga but she rejected him, so he began a relationship with her sister Wanda. Upon his death, Sartre was still supporting Wanda. He also supported Olga for years, until she met and married [[Jacques-Laurent Bost]], a lover of de Beauvoir.

In the novel, set just before the outbreak of [[World War II]], de Beauvoir creates one character from the complex relationships of Olga and Wanda. The fictionalised versions of Beauvoir and Sartre have a [[ménage à trois]] with the young woman. The novel also delves into de Beauvoir and Sartre's complex relationship and how it was affected by the ménage à trois.

''She Came to Stay'' was followed by many others, including ''[[The Blood of Others]]'', which explores the nature of individual responsibility, telling a love story between two young French students participating in the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] in World War II.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/beauvoir/ Simone de Beauvoir&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existentialist ethics===
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir &amp; Jean-Paul Sartre in Beijing 1955.jpg|thumb|Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre in [[Beijing]], 1955]]
In 1944 de Beauvoir wrote her first philosophical essay, ''Pyrrhus et Cinéas'', a discussion of an existentialist ethics. She continued her exploration of existentialism through her second essay ''[[The Ethics of Ambiguity]]'' (1947); it is perhaps the most accessible entry into [[Existentialism|French existentialism]]. In the essay, de Beauvoir clears up some inconsistencies that many, Sartre included, have found in major existentialist works such as ''Being and Nothingness''. In ''The Ethics of Ambiguity'', de Beauvoir confronts the existentialist dilemma of absolute freedom vs. the constraints of circumstance.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford" /&gt;

===''Les Temps modernes''===
{{main|Les Temps modernes}}
At the end of World War II, de Beauvoir and Sartre edited ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', a political journal which Sartre founded along with [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and others. De Beauvoir used ''Les Temps Modernes'' to promote her own work and explore her ideas on a small scale before fashioning essays and books. De Beauvoir remained an editor until her death.

===Sexuality, existentialist feminism and ''The Second Sex''===
''[[The Second Sex]]'', first published in 1949 in French as ''Le Deuxième Sexe'', turns the existentialist mantra that ''[[existence precedes essence]]'' into a feminist one: "One is not born but becomes a woman".&lt;ref&gt;Beauvoir, The Second Sex, 267&lt;/ref&gt; With this famous phrase, Beauvoir first articulated what has come to be known as the [[sex-gender distinction]], that is, the distinction between biological sex and the social and historical construction of gender and its attendant stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/feminism-gender/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Mari|last=Mikkola|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=3 January 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The fundamental source of women's oppression" Beauvoir notes, "is its historical and social construction as the quintessential" Other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/beauvoir/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Bergoffen|first=Debra|date=2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Beauvoir defines women as the "second sex" because women are defined in relation to men. Aristotle referred that women are "female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities". De Beauvoir also points out that St. Thomas referred to the woman as the "imperfect man", the "incidental" being.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/ethics/de-beauvoir/2nd-sex/introduction.htm|title=Simone de Beauvoir The Second Sex, Woman as Other 1949|first=Simone de|last=Beauvoir|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Beauvoir asserted that women are as capable of choice as men, and thus can choose to elevate themselves, moving beyond the '[[immanence]]' to which they were previously resigned and reaching '[[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]', a position in which one takes responsibility for oneself and the world, where one chooses one's freedom.

Chapters of ''The Second Sex'' were originally published in ''Les Temps modernes'',&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi 2005, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; in June 1949. The second volume came a few months after the first in France.&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi 2005, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; It was very quickly published in America due to the quick translation by [[Howard Parshley]], as prompted by [[Blanche Knopf]], wife of publisher [[Alfred A. Knopf]]. Because Parshley had only a basic familiarity with the French language, and a minimal understanding of philosophy (he was a professor of biology at [[Smith College]]), much of de Beauvoir's book was mistranslated or inappropriately cut, distorting her intended message.&lt;ref name="Moi, Toril 2002"&gt;Moi, Toril 'While We Wait: The English Translation of "The Second Sex" in Signs 27(4) (summer, 2002), pp. 1005–35.&lt;/ref&gt; For years, Knopf prevented the introduction of a more accurate retranslation of de Beauvoir's work, declining all proposals despite the efforts of existentialist scholars.&lt;ref name="Moi, Toril 2002"/&gt; Only in 2009 was there a second translation, to mark the 60th anniversary of the original publication. Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier produced the first integral translation in 2010, reinstating a third of the original work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/books/review-the-second-sex-by-simone-de-beauvoir/article1615327|title=Review: The Second Sex, by Simone de Beauvoir|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the chapter "Woman: Myth and Reality" of ''The Second Sex'',&lt;ref&gt;Beauvoir, Simone de. "Woman: Myth and Reality".&lt;br&gt;** in Jacobus, Lee A. (ed.). ''A World of Ideas''. Bedford/St. Martins, Boston 2006. 780–95.&lt;br&gt;** in Prince, Althea, and Susan Silva Wayne. ''Feminisms and Womanisms: A Women's Studies Reader''. Women's Press, Toronto 2004 p.&amp;nbsp;59–65.&lt;/ref&gt; de Beauvoir argued that men had made women the "Other" in society by application of a false aura of "mystery" around them. She argued that men used this as an excuse not to understand women or their problems and not to help them, and that this stereotyping was always done in societies by the group higher in the hierarchy to the group lower in the hierarchy. She wrote that a similar kind of oppression by hierarchy also happened in other categories of identity, such as race, class and religion, but she claimed that it was nowhere more true than with gender in which men stereotyped women and used it as an excuse to organize society into a [[patriarchy]].

Despite her contributions to the feminist movement, especially the French women's liberation movement, and her beliefs in women's economic independence and equal education, de Beauvoir was initially reluctant to call herself a feminist.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"/&gt; However, after observing the resurgence of the feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, de Beauvoir stated she no longer believed a socialist revolution to be enough to bring about women's liberation. She publicly declared herself a feminist in 1972 in an interview with ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fallaize|first=Elizabeth|title=Simone de Beauvoir: A critical reader|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415147033|page=6|edition=Digital print }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the manuscript pages of ''Le Deuxième Sexe'' were published. At the time her adopted daughter, [[Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir]], a philosophy professor, described her mother's writing process: Beauvoir wrote every page of her books longhand first and only after hired typists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/books/review/simone-de-beauvoir-second-sex-manuscript.html|title=Revisiting Simone de Beauvoir's ''The Second Sex'' as a Work in Progress|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Mandarins'' ===
[[File:Algren house Miller.jpg|thumb|Dunes cottage where Algren and de Beauvoir summered in [[Miller Beach]], Indiana]] 
Published in 1954, ''The Mandarins'' is set after the end of World War II and won her France's highest literary prize, the ''[[Prix Goncourt]]''. The book follows the personal lives of philosophers and friends among Sartre's and de Beauvoir's intimate circle, including her relationship with American writer [[Nelson Algren]], to whom the book was dedicated. Algren was outraged by the frank way de Beauvoir described their sexual experiences in both ''The Mandarins'' and her autobiographies. Algren vented his outrage when reviewing American translations of de Beauvoir's work. Much material bearing on this episode in de Beauvoir's life, including her love letters to Algren, entered the public domain only after her death.

==Later years==
[[File:Núñez-Beauvoir-Sartre-Che Guevara.jpg|thumb|left| [[Antonio Núñez Jiménez]], de Beauvoir, [[Sartre]] and [[Che Guevara]] in Cuba, 1960]]
De Beauvoir wrote popular travel diaries about time spent in the United States &lt;ref&gt;de Beauvoir, "America Day by Day", Carol Cosman (Translator) and Douglas Brinkley (Foreword), Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999. {{ISBN|9780520210677}}&lt;/ref&gt; and China and published essays and fiction rigorously, especially throughout the 1950s and 1960s. She published several volumes of short stories, including ''The Woman Destroyed'', which, like some of her other later work, deals with aging.

1980 saw the publication of ''[[When Things of the Spirit Come First]]'', a set of short stories centred around and based upon women important to her earlier years.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt; Though written long before the novel ''She Came to Stay'', de Beauvoir did not at the time consider the stories worth publishing, allowing some forty years to pass before doing so.

[[Sartre]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]] had a longstanding feud, which led Merleau-Ponty to leave ''Les Temps Modernes''. De Beauvoir sided with Sartre and ceased to associate with Merleau-Ponty. In de Beauvoir's later years, she hosted the journal's editorial meetings in her flat and contributed more than Sartre, whom she often had to force to offer his opinions.

De Beauvoir also notably wrote a four-volume autobiography, consisting of: ''Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter''; ''The Prime of Life''; ''Force of Circumstance'' (sometimes published in two volumes in English translation: ''After the War'' and ''Hard Times''); and ''All Said and Done''.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

In the 1970s de Beauvoir became active in France's [[women's liberation movement]]. She wrote and signed the [[Manifesto of the 343]] in 1971, a manifesto that included a list of famous women who claimed to have had an abortion, then illegal in France. Some argue most of the women had not had abortions, including Beauvoir. Signatories were diverse as [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Delphine Seyrig]] and de Beauvoir's sister Poupette. In 1974, abortion was legalised in France.

Her 1970 long essay [[La Vieillesse]] (''The Coming of Age'') is a rare instance of an intellectual meditation on the decline and solitude all humans experience if they do not die before about the age of 60.

In an interview with [[Betty Friedan]], de Beauvoir said: "No, we don’t believe that any woman should have this choice. No woman should be authorised to stay at home to bring up her children. Society should be totally different. Women should not have that choice, precisely because if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one. It is a way of forcing women in a certain direction."&lt;ref&gt;“A Dialogue with Simone de Beauvoir,” in Betty Friedan, It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women’s Movement (New York: Random House, 1976), pp. 311–12
&lt;/ref&gt;

In about 1976 de Beauvoir and Sylvie Le Bon made a trip to New York City in the United States to visit [[Kate Millett]] on her farm.&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi 2005, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Sartre+Beauvoir grave.JPG|right|thumb|De Beauvoir's and Sartre's grave at the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]]]]

In 1981 she wrote ''La Cérémonie Des Adieux'' (''A Farewell to Sartre''), a painful account of Sartre's last years. In the opening of ''Adieux'', de Beauvoir notes that it is the only major published work of hers which Sartre did not read before its publication.

She contributed the piece "Feminism – alive, well, and in constant danger" to the 1984 anthology ''[[Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology]]'', edited by [[Robin Morgan]].&lt;ref name="global"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.vsc.edu/lscfind/Record/154795/TOC#tabnav |title=Table of Contents: Sisterhood is global : |publisher=Catalog.vsc.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Sartre died in 1980, de Beauvoir published his letters to her with edits to spare the feelings of people in their circle who were still living. After de Beauvoir's death, Sartre's adopted daughter and literary heir Arlette Elkaïm would not let many of Sartre's letters be published in unedited form. Most of Sartre's letters available today have de Beauvoir's edits, which include a few omissions but mostly the use of pseudonyms. De Beauvoir's adopted daughter and literary heir [[Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir|Sylvie Le Bon]], unlike Elkaïm, published de Beauvoir's unedited letters to both Sartre and Algren.

De Beauvoir died of [[pneumonia]] on 14 April 1986 in Paris, aged 78.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/women/article-9014010 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213135908/http://www.britannica.com/women/article-9014010 |archivedate=13 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried next to Sartre at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.

:''For the Scottish Society of Women Artists, see [[Visual Arts Scotland]].''
The '''Society of Women Artists (SWA)''' is a British art body dedicated to celebrating and promoting fine art created by women.

It was founded as the '''Society of Female Artists''' (SFA) in about 1855, offering women artists the opportunity to exhibit and sell their works. Annual exhibitions have been held in London since 1857, with some wartime interruptions.

== History ==
Particularly during the 19th century, the British art world was dominated by the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy (RA)]], founded in 1768. Two of the 34 named founders were women painters: [[Angelica Kauffman]] (1741–1807) and [[Mary Moser]] (1744–1819).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/striving-after-excellence-victorian|title="Striving after excellence": Victorian women and the fight for arts training – Blog – Royal Academy of Arts|website=www.royalacademy.org.uk|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until 1922 that other female artists were admitted to the academy. [[Annie Swynnerton]], a member of the Society of Women Artists since 1889, was elected as the first female associate member of the Royal Academy and in 1936, [[Dame Laura Knight]] became the first female elected full member of the Royal Academy. 

A woman's place in society was perceived as passive and governed by emotion. And in the 1850s, the idea that women could be artists was hotly debated by John Ruskin and other critics in various journals. Ruskin wrote to Sophia Sinnett in 1858 "You must resolve to be quite a great paintress; the feminine termination does not exist, there never having been such a being as yet as a lady who could paint.”&lt;ref&gt;''Cook and Wedderburn, The Life, Letters and Complete Works'', London, 1903 etc., vol. 14, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were not considered as serious contributors to the field of art and had great difficulty in obtaining a public showing. Their education in the arts was limited and they had been excluded from the practice of drawing from the nude figure since the Royal Academy was founded. However, Ruskin later revised his opinion of women artists after seeing [[Elizabeth Thompson]]'s ''The Roll Call'' at the Royal Academy in 1874. After much debate and petitioning, in December 1883, the Royal Academy Schools agreed to provide life classes "for the study of the partially draped figure" to female students but it was a further 10 years before women were admitted to these classes. It was at this time that life classes for women were becoming more widely available across the country. 

Nevertheless, British women artists proved themselves capable of working both individually and in collaboration and consequently, gained greater credibility. In order to progress and find opportunities to exhibit, they began to form their own organisations. One of the most significant of those bodies was the '''Society of Female Artists''', founded around 1855. Initially, membership was granted to women who had exhibited with the Society and who earned their livelihood through art.

===Society of Female Artists (c. 1855 – c. 1869)===

In 1855, English biographer [[Harriet Grote]] (1792–1878) and opera singer [[Jenny Lind]] (1820–1887) were cited as founder members of the SFA, with the society's first headquarters located at the [[Architectural Association]] in Conduit Street, London.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Elizabeth, ''The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide 1866–1928'', Routledge, 1999, p253 &lt;/ref&gt; The society was initially managed by a committee, and, although its members were sometimes listed in early catalogues, no presiding officer was ever named. Early members included [[Rosa Bonheur]] and Elizabeth Thompson.&lt;ref name="jisc.ac.uk"&gt;https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/files/womensart/0031.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

The society's first exhibition, held at 315 Oxford Street, London between 1 June and 18 July 1857, became the focus of debate with regard to the role of women in art. The exhibition comprised 358 works by 149 female artists, the predominant genre being landscapes. In May 1857, prior to the opening, ''[[The Art Journal]]'' and ''[[The Spectator]]'' were supportive of the exhibition. The then secretary stated in ''The Art Journal'' (1 June 1857): "The Committee are (sic) gratified to announce that the success of their first Exhibition has fully exceeded their expectations”.&lt;ref&gt;Nunn, Pamela Geraldine, ''The Mid Victorian Woman Artist 1850–1879'', PhD Thesis, University College London, 1982, p167-173&lt;/ref&gt; The Society then held annual exhibitions in London showing work of women artists (except in the years 1912–1914, 1919 and 1940–1946). 

Until 1863, the annual exhibition received controversial reviews, probably as exhibits were chosen on a liberal and amicable basis. This was addressed in 1865, when their lack of professionalism led to a reorganisation of the Society under the patronage of the Duchess of Cambridge and consequently it was renamed the '''Society of Lady Artists'''.&lt;ref name="vam.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/archives/unit/ARC61705|title=V&amp;A Archives|website=www.vam.ac.uk|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society has received royal patronage since 1865 (the current patron is [[HRH Princess Michael of Kent]]).

In 1867 Mrs. [[Madeline Marrable]], a prolific watercolourist and oil painter, joined the committee.

=== Society of Lady Artists (c 1869 – 1899) ===
The Society's earliest records were lost or destroyed during [[World War II]] at the Society's headquarters at 195 Piccadilly, London (the Society's catalogues and remaining papers dating from 1929 are now housed in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] Library). As a result, there is some debate as to exactly when the Society was renamed from the SFA to the SLA. Secondary sources of reference suggest 1869,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.society-women-artists.org.uk/history.html|title=History|website=www.society-women-artists.org.uk|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other sources suggest it was 1873.&lt;ref name="jisc.ac.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vam.ac.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/societies/society-women-artists|title=Society of Women Artists – Artist Biographies|website=www.artbiogs.co.uk|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Marrable became the first president of the society. In 1899, the mid-Victorian persona was discarded and the 20th century was embraced by the society with a new name, the '''Society of Women Artists''' (SWA).

=== Society of Women Artists (1899 – present) ===

The society has had many notable artists among its members. Dame Laura Knight, the first woman Royal Academician, was elected president in 1932 and retained that office until she retired in 1968 to become a Patron.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell Orr, Clarissa, ''Women in the Victorian Art World'', Manchester University Press, Manchester &amp; New York, 1995, p55&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrator [[Mabel Lucie Atwell]] and Suzanne Lucas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.the-saleroom.com/en-gb/auction-catalogues/tamlyn-and-son/catalogue-id-2772909/lot-7213053|title=Biography Suzanne Lucas  (1915 &amp;#8211; 2008) M.B.E Medaille de la France  FLS PRMS FPSBA SWA HSF|first=|last=the-saleroom.com|website=www.the-saleroom.com|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; past President of the Society of Botanical Artists and the first woman president of Royal Miniature Society (now known as [[Royal Society of Miniature Painters, Sculptors and Gravers]]), were also members. Current members include [[Daphne Todd]], the first female President of the [[Royal Society of Portrait Painters]] from 1994–2000 and winner of the [[BP Portrait Award]] 2010, portraitist [[June Mendoza]], and [[Philomena Davidson]], first woman President of the [[Royal British Society of Sculptors]].
 
Many SWA members are also members of other well-established societies, such as the [[Royal Society of British Artists]], the [[Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours]], [[The Pastel Society]], and the [[Society of Equestrian Artists]].

The SWA collated a four-volume dictionary of the society's exhibitors to 1996. The society's archive was given to the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]’s Archive of Art and Design in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Baile De Laperriere, Charles, ''The Society of Women Artists exhibitors 1855–1996 : a dictionary of artists and their works in the annual exhibitions of The Society of Women Artists'', 4 volumes, Hilmarton Press, Wiltshire, c1996, p5, {{ISBN|0-904722-30-9}} {{ISBN|978-0-904722-30-7}} http://www.lutterworth.com/pub/dictionary%20women%20artists%20intro.pdf retrieved 02-01-2017&lt;/ref&gt; Only the RA and the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] produce such records. Today, the mechanics of running the society can be viewed on their [http://www.society-women-artists.org.uk/ website].

== Membership ==

Membership of the SWA is composed of a maximum of 150 members. They promote new artists and encourage non-members to show their work at their annual exhibition.

The first step towards becoming a member is to submit six works regularly (although a maximum of four will be hung) for the Annual Open Exhibition. These are considered by a selection committee, and if judged exceptional, the artist is elected to become an associate member (ASWA), subject to space within the society. Associate members become eligible for election to full membership in the following year.

Currently, the SWA collaborates with [[Breast Cancer Now]], the UK’s largest breast cancer charity, created by the merger of Breast Cancer Campaign and Breakthrough Breast Cancer. Each year a special reception is held during the annual exhibition, here members donate works that are auctioned and the proceeds from the sales are presented to the charity.

=== Demonstrations and workshops ===

During the annual exhibition and within the gallery, member artists provide a series of informal demonstrations to the public. Special workshops are also led by members and held within the [http://www.mallgalleries.org.uk/learning/learning-centre Learning Centre at the Mall Galleries].

'''Matthew Bourne's ''Swan Lake''''' was first staged at [[Sadler's Wells]] theatre in London in 1995. The longest running ballet in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], it has been performed in the UK, Los Angeles, Europe, Russia, Australia, South Korea, Japan, Israel and Singapore.&lt;ref name=programme-2006&gt;"The History of Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake", from the programme from Matthew Bourne's ''Swan Lake'' at [[Sadler's Wells]], London, 13 December 2006 – 21 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The story is based on the Russian [[Romanticism|romantic]] ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', from which it takes the music by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] and the broad outline of the plot. [[Matthew Bourne|Bourne]]'s rendering is best known for having the traditionally female parts of the swans danced by men.

==Synopsis==
This synopsis is derived from programme notes and the synopsis provided on the DVD.&lt;ref  name=bourne-1996&gt;{{citation|last=Bourne|first=Matthew (dir.)|author-link=Matthew Bourne|publication-date=1996|title=Swan Lake [DVD]|publication-place=New York, N.Y.|publisher=NVC Arts: Warner Music Vision}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The plot of the ballet revolves around a young [[crown prince]], his distant mother, and his desire for freedom, represented by a swan.

===Act I===
In the prologue, the Prince, as a child, is awakened by a nightmare of a swan. The Prince's mother comes in to comfort him, but becoming nervous by the situation's intimacy, leaves.

'''Scene 1''' opens with the Prince being prepared for a day of official duties by chambermaids and valets.

In '''Scene 2''', arrayed in his [[dress uniform|full dress uniform]], the Prince becomes bored by a boat christening, a ribbon cutting, and other official tasks. His mother prods him to keep up appearances, even as she devotes more attention to the soldiers than she does to him. During this scene, there is a transition from the child actor playing the young Prince to the identically-dressed adult dancer who portrays the grown Prince. This now-adult Prince is introduced to a girl called "the Girlfriend". Although the girl seems foisted on him by von Rothbart, the [[Private Secretary]],&lt;ref&gt;Named as such in the DVD synopsis, thus identifying him with the sorcerer in the original scenario.&lt;/ref&gt; the Prince prefers her to his duty-bound life.

In '''Scene 3''', the Queen, one of her admiring soldiers, the Private Secretary, the Prince, and the Girlfriend all appear in a theatre box, where they watch a ballet that is staged for the actual audience as well as for the characters. The ballet's backdrop (from a design for Castle Falkenstein by [[Christian Jank]]), ornate costumes, and acting parody the romantic ballets of which the original ''Swan Lake'' was an example. The Girlfriend's responses to the dance, and her eventual dropping her purse from the royal box, annoy the Queen and von Rothbart.

'''Scene 4''' finds the Prince drinking in his private chambers in front of a mirror, to his mother's shock. A nearly violent ''[[pas de deux]]'' ensues in which he pleads for her attention and love, while she rebukes him.

The Prince then goes into the streets and into the Swank Bar, a 1970s-style disco, in '''Scenes Five and Six'''. Here is where the choreography veers from classical ballet, with jazz forms and [[modern dance]] dominating. The Prince gets into a fight with sailors at the bar, and he is thrown out into the street. In '''Scene Seven''', he sees the Girlfriend being paid off by von Rothbart, and he is totally shattered to discover that the only person who appeared to love him is a fake. This increases his desperation and he vows to kill himself.

While sitting in the street at the end of '''Scene Seven''' the Prince imagines a group of swans flying towards him but the vision disappears. It is the first flash of the Prince's descent into mental turmoil.

===Act II===
Distraught and disappointed that he will never find affection, the Prince writes a suicide note and goes to throw himself into a lake at a public park inhabited by swans. He is saved by a vision in which he encounters the lead Swan, who had appeared to him in his dreams. Initially rejected by the lead Swan, the Prince is gradually accepted and eventually taken into his arms, realizing what the Prince now knows he always desired. The Prince is elated and abandons his plan to kill himself.  This Act contains the most talked-about element of the ballet in which bare-chested, male dancers play the swans, and it contains a very sensual ''pas de deux'' between the lead Swan and the Prince.

===Act III===
'''Scene 1''' begins with princesses from various European nations and their escorts arriving at the palace gates for a grand ball. The Girlfriend sneaks in amongst them.

'''Scene 2''' takes place in a [[Fascism|proto-fascist]] ballroom where gigantic torchieres gripped by fists recall those of [[Jean Cocteau]]'s ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|La Belle et la Bête]]''. It commences with the arrival of the Queen and the Prince and some formal dancing, but quickly degenerates into a debauched party of drinking and lascivious come-ons. Into this arrives the charismatic and sexually aggressive son of von Rothbart,&lt;ref&gt;Also named in the DVD synopsis.&lt;/ref&gt; the Private Secretary, in black leather pants, who intensifies the sexual tension even further by flirting with every woman present, including the Queen. Each woman finds herself drawn to him and actively participates in the mutual, sometimes lewd, flirtation.

Just as in the original ''Swan Lake,'' where customarily (although not always) one ballerina performs the roles of both the white swan (Odette) and the black swan (Odile), the same ballet dancer performs the white Swan and the black-clad young von Rothbart in this version. The Prince sees something of his beloved Swan in the son, and he is very attracted to his bravado and animal magnetism but shocked by his lewdness, especially towards his mother. During [[Grinding (dance)|bump and grind]] group numbers and a sequence of national dances, it becomes clear that the Queen is powerfully attracted to von Rothbart's son. His father, the Private Secretary, looks on with an increasingly triumphant approval. The Prince also tries to approach young von Rothbart, only to be rebuffed. The Prince retreats into his mind and imagines dancing intimately with him, but the Prince's confusion interrupts the fantasy, and the son's movements turn from love to violence.

The Prince imagines the Queen and young von Rothbart flaunting their growing physical affection for each other. They join with the other guests at the ball to laugh and ridicule him because of his growing distress. The Queen and young von Rothbart end their dancing with an embrace and passionate kissing. The Prince, in his fury, violently separates them and is rewarded by outrage from both and a slap from his mother.  Overwhelmed by conflicted feelings, the Prince produces a pistol and threatens to shoot his mother. In an ensuing scuffle the Girlfriend tries to dissuade the Prince, while the Private Secretary draws a pistol and points it at the Prince. As shots ring out, the Girlfriend and the Prince fall to the ground, but only the Girlfriend has been hit. She lies unconscious and the Prince is dragged away, while the Queen throws herself into young von Rothbart's arms. He gives the pistol he had taken from the Prince to his father, the two of them laughing.

===New DVD Issued in 2010 Contains Major Revisions to the Plot in Act Three, Scene Two===

The plot has evolved over the 15 years since the debut.  The most conspicuous change Bourne  made was to remove the subplot of the von Rothbart conspiracy to put his son on the throne.  The Private Secretary now becomes just a functionary (no longer a von Rothbart counterpart, nor villain) and the Stranger is no longer shown conspiring with him.  The identity of the Stranger becomes even more vague and Bourne prefers to leave him and his relationship with the Prince up to the individual interpretation of the viewer.

===Act IV===
In the final act, the Prince, regarded as having lost his mind, is confined to an asylum in a room with a high barred window, and is treated by a doctor and a team of nurses wearing masks that resemble the Queen's face, in a scene reminiscent of his dressing at the beginning of the ballet.  The Queen visits but, again, she is still unable to fully express love for her son.

The Prince crawls into bed and appears to sleep. However, he begins writhing as he dreams of the troupe of swans emerging from under and behind, dancing around him. He wakes from his nightmare, checking under his bed and around his room for swans. His tortured expression and jerky movements convey the Prince in turmoil. His lead Swan then slowly emerges from within the Prince's bed. The Swan dances with the Prince and assures him of his continued affection. But, the rest of the swans turn on the lead Swan when he makes it clear that he values his relationship with the Prince more than he does them. They separate the two and begin attacking the Prince before the Swan leaps in to save him. The Swan embraces the Prince and envelops him in his wings. The swans' fury increases and their next attack dismembers the Swan, who then disappears. Heartbroken and despondent, the Prince wails and collapses onto the bed. The Queen then finds her dead son's body and breaks down in sobs. However, in death the Prince and the Swan are reunited; as shown by a tableau depicting the lead Swan tenderly holding the young Prince in his arms.

==Imagery and innovation==
The original ''Swan Lake'' was based on the story of [[Ondine (mythology)|Ondine]], a German myth with a theme common in [[Romanticism]] that was adapted by [[Hans Christian Andersen]] for his story ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''. Ondine was a beautiful and immortal water nymph. The only threat to her eternal happiness was if she fell in love with a mortal and bore his child, as she would then lose her immortality. Ondine duly fell in love with a dashing knight, Sir Lawrence, and they were married, the knight pledging unfailing love and faithfulness to her with his every waking breath. A year after their wedding Ondine bore Lawrence a son. From that moment she began to age. As Ondine’s beauty faded, Lawrence lost interest in her.

One afternoon Ondine was walking near some stables when she heard the familiar snoring of her husband. When she entered the stable, she saw Sir Lawrence lying in the arms of another woman. Kicking her husband awake, she cursed him such that he would have breath so long as he remained awake, but if he ever fell asleep his breath would be taken from him and he would die.

According to Alastair Macaulay (formerly chief dance critic of ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' and chief theatre critic of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', now chief dance critic for ''[[The New York Times]]''), the Ondine myth is said to be an image of psycho-sexual distress: the nymph is a forlorn image of repressed virginity, anxious that she will never achieve womanly fulfillment, while her feminine nemesis that leads her husband astray represents the confident seductive power that threatens her hopes. The story is double-edged: the human [[protagonist]], in loving the nymph, transgresses against his own kind and may be punished. If, having betrayed her once, he returns to her, her kiss will bring him death; in fact, it may be this love-in-death that the man desires most.&lt;ref name=macaulay-2006&gt;Alastair Macaulay, "Swan Lake: The Matthew Bourne version", from the programme from Matthew Bourne's ''Swan Lake'', above.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourne's ''Swan Lake'' radically reinterprets the myth. The focus of the ballet is turned away from the Ondine character to the man – the Prince. It is the Prince who struggles against repression and hopes for liberty, and who needs love to make him safe.&lt;ref name=macaulay-2006/&gt; In addition, it is not the mortal who is unfaithful to the nymph. Rather, it is the Swan who (in Act Two) expresses love for the Prince, betrays him in the form of the Stranger (Act Three), and finally returns to him (Act Four). However, as in the Ondine myth, the sin of betrayal cannot be [[:wikt:expiate|expiated]] except in death.

==Politics==
Much has been made of Bourne's decision to cast men as the swans. The original ballet is a standard in the European tradition of romanticized female–male love. The heroine, the swan princess Odette, is portrayed as powerless but lovely in accordance with conventional [[gender role]]s, and her hero is portrayed as a hunter who alone has the power to save her. Having a man in the role of lead Swan suggests that the Prince's struggle has repressed [[Same-sex relationship|gay love]] at its core, and changes the realm of the plot from magical to psychological. The fierce, bird-like [[choreography]] given to the swan corps re-interprets the [[archetype]] of the swan as a pretty, feminine bird of gentle grace. According to Bourne, "The idea of a male swan makes complete sense to me. The strength, the beauty, the enormous wingspan of these creatures suggests to the musculature of a male dancer more readily than a ballerina in her white tutu."&lt;ref name=programme-2006/&gt;

However, the same central themes carry through both works.  Both are about doomed, forbidden love, and both feature a Prince who wishes to transcend the boundaries of everyday [[Convention (norm)|convention]] through that love. Both themes have strong ties to the life of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], the ballet's composer, whose  homosexuality caused a number of complications in his life.

==The score==
In order to accommodate his revised scenario, Bourne somewhat altered Tchaikovsky's score, reordering several numbers and omitting others. For example, No. 5 has been moved in its entirety from Act One to Act Three, where it follows the (reordered) national dances. Act Three has been trimmed by leaving out most of No. 19 and all of the following ''pas de deux''.&lt;ref&gt;''Swan Lake'' [DVD] programme notes, above.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Dagger''''' ({{lang-sr|Нож, Nož}}; which means ''Knife'') is a 1999 Serbian [[war film]] directed by [[Miroslav Lekić]]. The film was written by Miroslav Lekić, [[Slobodan Stanojević]] and Igor Bojović. The plot is based on [[Vuk Drašković]]'s novel of the same name.

The main motive of the film is the eventually disclosed nonsense of ethnic division in Bosnia, pointing out to the same historical origin of both opposed ethnic groups, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims - Orthodox Christians and Sunni Muslims, respectively. Set in the 1960s and observed from the point of view of Alija Osmanović, a young Muslim medical student raised by a single mother, his entire family slaughtered and his baby brother kidnaped by Serbs in Second World War, as the aftermath of Jugovići (Christian) and Osmanovići (Muslim) violent family feud, he learns not only that Osmanovići were once but a branch of Jugovići family who converted to Islam during the Turkish rule, but that, unbeknownst to his mother, he himself was a baby taken from Jugovići, after the massacre of Jugovići on Christmas Eve in 1942. Both families now extinct, and Alia as the descendant of both, torn between two cultures and two identities, he struggles to maintain his inner peace, desperately searching for his long lost step-brother and fighting the prejudices against the love relationship he has with a Serbian colleague student.

Based on true events of World War II and being centered on the atrocious crimes committed to Serbs during World War II, and the particular families of Jugovići and Osmanovići.

In 1999, the film was screened at the 13th Montenegro Film Festival, and gained five featured awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmskifestivalhercegnovi.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=21|title=13. filmski festival|year=1999|work=Montenegro Film Festival|publisher=Freshidea|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="the dagger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monteroyalpictures.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=62&amp;lang=en|title=The Dagger|year=2011|work=Monte Royal|publisher=© Monte Royal Pictures International|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also earned the “Fipresci Award” for Directing, five acting awards in the Niš Film Festival and the “Crystal Star” at the Brussels Film Festival.&lt;ref name="the dagger" /&gt;

'''''The Rain People''''' is a 1969 film directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. Alongside [[Shirley Knight]], leading players are [[James Caan]] and [[Robert Duvall]], both of whom would later work with Coppola in ''[[The Godfather]]''. Future film director and Coppola friend [[George Lucas]] worked as an aide on this film, and made a short making-of documentary film, ''[[Filmmaker (film)|Filmmaker]]'', about it. The film also won the [[Golden Shell]] at the 1969 [[San Sebastián International Film Festival|San Sebastian Film Festival]].

The film received mixed initial reviews, but modern reception is more often positive.

The current DVD release from Warner Archive appears to be from a 16mm print.

==Plot summary==
Housewife Natalie Ravenna (Shirley Knight) decides that she needs a break from marriage after discovering she is pregnant. She meanders across the United States trying to deal with the notion of being responsible. Along the way she meets a man oddly named Killer (James Caan) with a past he is not ready to reveal. It leads Natalie to ask: should she stay with Killer or return to her husband Vinny? Things are further complicated when Natalie gets involved with a handsome but lonely highway patrolman Gordon (Robert Duvall).

==Production==
The film served as a vehicle for Duvall and Caan, who at the time roomed with each other and were doing a few films together. Later, they and Coppola teamed for the film ''[[The Godfather]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Reception==
[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film four stars out of four and compared Natalie Ravenna's quest to that of the [[Peter Fonda]] character in ''[[Easy Rider]]'', and called them both "lineal descendants of the most typical American searcher of them all, [[Huckleberry Finn]]." He concluded: "It's difficult to say whether his film is successful or not. That's the beautiful thing about a lot of the new, experimental American directors. They'd rather do interesting things and make provocative observations than try to outflank [[John Ford]] on his way to the Great American Movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=''The Rain People'' |date=September 19, 1969 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19690919/REVIEWS/909190301/1023 |accessdate=February 9, 2013 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 [[File:Thomas-german-reed.jpg|thumb|right|German Reed]]'''Thomas German Reed''' (27 June 1817 &amp;ndash; 21 March 1888) was an English composer, musical director, actor, singer and theatrical manager of the [[Victorian era]].  He was best known for creating the [[German Reed Entertainment]]s, together with his actress wife, a genre of musical plays that made theatre-going respectable at a time when the stage was considered disreputable.

While acting as organist and chapel-master at chapels in London, and also as musical director and performer at [[West End theatre]]s in the 1830s and 1840s, Reed tried his hand at producing opera.  He married [[Priscilla Horton]], a noted singer, actress and dancer, in 1844.  By 1851, he was managing opera productions at various theatres in London and on tour.   In 1855, Reed and his wife began to present and perform in "Mr. and Mrs. German Reed's Entertainments", consisting of brief, small-scale, family-friendly [[comic opera]]s. In the early and mid-Victorian era, the respectable middle classes regarded the theatre in general as sinful.  Therefore, the Reeds shrewdly called their establishment the "Gallery of Illustration" and their productions "entertainments" to emphasize their refined propriety.

In addition to comic classics like ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', the Reeds usually presented new works by English writers such as [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]], [[William Brough (writer)|William Brough]] and [[Gilbert Arthur à Beckett|Gilbert à Beckett]].  His composers included [[Frederic Clay]], [[Arthur Sullivan]], [[George Macfarren]] and [[Alfred Cellier]], as well as himself. Reed retired in 1871 after an injury, and his son Alfred took over the entertainments with his mother.

==Life and career==
Reed was born in [[Bristol]], the son of Thomas Reed (1795–1871), a musician, and his wife, Frances, ''née'' German (1796–1839). He studied music with his father and made his debut at the age of ten as a pianist and singer at the [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] Theatre.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Stedman, Jane W. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23278 "Reed, (Thomas) German (1817–1888)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, Jan 2008, accessed 1 February 2013 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to London where Thomas Reed was appointed conductor at the [[Haymarket Theatre]].&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Woodbridge Wilson, Frederic. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/10942 "Reed, Thomas German"],  Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 31 January 2013 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young Reed played, sang and acted at the theatre.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; In 1832, German Reed became an organist at the Roman Catholic Chapel in [[Sloane Street]] and assistant to his father, who moved to be conductor at the [[Garrick Theatre (Leman St)|Garrick Theatre]].&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Reed, Thomas German}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His work at the theatre included scoring and adapting new operas, including ''[[Fra Diavolo]]'' in 1837.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  He also gave private music lessons.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

[[File:A Sensation Novel.jpg|left|thumb|German Reed and [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[A Sensation Novel]]'', 1871]]
In 1838, German Reed was appointed chapel-master at the Royal Bavarian Chapel and also became musical director at his father's former employer, the Haymarket Theatre, where he continued to work until 1851 with the exception of a temporary closure in 1843, during which he produced [[Giovanni Pacini|Pacini]]'s opera ''[[Saffo (opera)|Sappho]]'' at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  During these years, he met  Priscilla Horton, a successful and popular [[contralto]] and actress who had been performing on the stage in London since the age of ten.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  They married in 1844.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  In 1851, Reed was engaged to assist in the production of opera at the [[Surrey Theatre]] and later managed Sadler's Wells Opera for a season and also conducted the music at the [[Olympic Theatre]], as well as touring extensively in the British provinces.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In the spring of 1855, at [[Queen's Theatre, Long Acre|St. Martin's Hall]], German Reed and his wife presented the first performance of "Miss P. Horton's Illustrative Gatherings," musical theatre.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; These performances usually consisted of one or two brief [[comic opera]]s designed for a minimal number of characters and performed with either the piano and [[Pump organ|harmonium]] or a small ensemble of musicians.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  They eventually became "Mr. and Mrs. German Reed's Entertainments", presented at the [[Royal Gallery of Illustration]] in [[Regent Street]], beginning in 1856, and later at [[St. George's Hall (London)|St. George's Hall]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;  At a time when the respectable middle classes regarded the theatre in general as sinful and even dangerous places of naughty humour, alcohol and prostitution, the Reeds called their establishment the "Gallery" of Illustration, rather than a "theatre", and their productions "entertainments" or "illustrative gatherings", rather than plays, [[extravaganza]]s, or [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]].  ''[[The Times]]'' characterised the works as "extravaganza of the more refined order."&lt;ref&gt;"Obituary: Thomas German Reed", ''The Times'', 26 March 1888, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Reed  and his wife almost always appeared in these pieces, and on the few occasions when they did not, the box-office receipts suffered.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

[[File:A-dream-of-venice.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Reed (in top hat) with his wife and [[John Orlando Parry|John Parry]] and Susan Galton in ''A Dream in Venice'' at the Royal Gallery of Illustration, April 1867.]]
Reed became the lessee of St. George's Hall in 1867, and there he initially produced and conducted ''[[The Contrabandista]]'' by [[Arthur Sullivan]] and [[F. C. Burnand]], ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' and other English operas in small-scale productions, as well as non-musical plays.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  Around the same time, at the Gallery of Illustration, he presented works with libretti by, among others, [[W. S. Gilbert]], [[William Brough (writer)|William Brough]], [[Gilbert Arthur à Beckett|Gilbert à Beckett]], [[Robert Reece]] and [[Arthur Law (playwright)|Arthur Law]]. His composers included [[Frederic Clay]], [[George Macfarren]], [[Alfred Cellier]] and [[Hamilton Clarke]] as well as Sullivan and Reed himself.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He wrote the scores for more than a dozen of the entertainments, and is described by the museum curator Fredric Woodbridge Wilson as "an imaginative and effective writer of music for the stage".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Little of Reed's music survives. A few individual songs were published, but the scores of the entertainments were not. The autograph of the music for ''Our Island Home'' is preserved in [[The Morgan Library &amp; Museum]], New York, but no other scores are known to be extant.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

When the lease on the Gallery of Illustration ended in 1873, the German Reed entertainments moved to St. George's Hall.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; After falling from his horse when hunting, Reed had retired in 1871; his son Alfred (1847–1895) took over the entertainments with his mother, continuing with the entertainments after her retirement in 1879, until 1895.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

German Reed died at St. Croix, Upper [[East Sheen]], [[Surrey]] at the age of 70.  He was buried in [[Old Mortlake Burial Ground]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1640">The '''Théâtre-Musée des Capucines''', also known as the '''Théâtre musée des Capucines-Fragonard''', is a private museum dedicated to [[perfume]], and located in the [[2nd arrondissement of Paris]] at 39, boulevard des Capucines, [[Paris]], [[France]]. It closes on Sundays; admission is free.

The museum was created in 1993 by the Fragonard perfume company within a former theater, the [[Théâtre des Capucines]], dating to 1889. It exhibits 19th-century copper distilling apparatus, [[alembic]]s, [[laboratory flask|flask]]s, pots-pourris, and perfume roasters, as well as the animals and plants that provide raw materials for perfumes. A collection of perfume bottles illustrates 3000 years of perfume making.

The '''tongue map''' or '''taste map''' is a [[common misconception]] that different sections of the [[tongue]] are exclusively responsible for different [[basic taste]]s. It is illustrated with a schematic map of the tongue, with certain parts of the tongue labeled for each taste. Although widely taught in schools, this was scientifically disproven by later research; all taste sensations come from all regions of the tongue, although different parts are more sensitive to certain tastes.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news|date=November 10, 2008 |title=The Claim: The tongue is mapped into four areas of taste |first=Anahad |last=O'Connor |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/health/11real.html?_r=1 |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v442/n7105/abs/nature05084.html |title=The cells and logic for mammalian sour taste detection |first1=Angela |last1=Huang |first2=Xiaoke |last2=Chen |first3=Mark |last3=Hoon |first4=Jayaram |last4=Chandrashekar |first5=Wei |last5=Guo |first6=Dimitri |last6=Tränkner |first7=Nicholas |last7=Ryba |first8=Charles |last8=Zuker |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/nature05084 |volume=442 |pages=934–938 |date=August 24, 2006 |accessdate=June 24, 2011 |issue=7105 |pmid=16929298 |pmc=1571047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The theory behind this map originated from a paper written by Harvard psychologist [[D.P Hanig]], which was a translation of a German paper, ''Zur Psychophysik des Geschmackssinnes'', which was written in 1901.&lt;ref name="Haenig"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hänig |first=David |year=1901 |url=http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/library/data/lit4562 |title=Zur Psychophysik des Geschmackssinnes |journal=[[Philosophische Studien]] |volume=17 |pages=576–623 |accessdate=July 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unclear representation of data in the former paper suggested that each part of the tongue tastes exactly one basic taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/health/060829_bad_tongue.html |first=Christopher |last=Wanjek |title=The Tongue Map: Tasteless Myth Debunked |date=August 29, 2006|work=Livescience.com |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= David V. Smith |author2=Robert F. Margolskee |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-taste-map-all-wrong |date=March 2001 |journal=[[Scientific American]] |title=The Taste Map: All Wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper showed minute differences in threshold detection levels across the tongue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Jacob M. Andersen |url=http://brushflossandmouthwash.com/mythbusting-tongue-map/ |date=Jan 2015 |journal=[[ASDA]] |title=Mythbusting The Tongue Map}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these differences were later taken out of context and the minute difference in threshold sensitivity was misconstrued in textbooks as a difference in sensation.&lt;ref name=mistake&gt;[http://wwwalt.med-rz.uni-sb.de/med_fak/physiol1/LDM/chemotopic_1.htm The Chemotopic Organization of Taste] wwwalt.med-rz.uni-sb.de {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718005301/http://wwwalt.med-rz.uni-sb.de/med_fak/physiol1/LDM/chemotopic_1.htm |date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some parts of the tongue may be able to detect a taste before the others do, all parts are equally capable of conveying the [[qualia]] of all tastes. Threshold sensitivity may differ across the tongue, but intensity of sensation does not.&lt;ref name=mistake/&gt;

The same paper included a taste bud distribution diagram that showed a "taste belt".&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwalt.med-rz.uni-sb.de/med_fak/physiol1/LDM/chemotopic_2.htm Chemotopic representation of the human tongue according to Hänig (1901)] wwwalt.med-rz.uni-sb.de {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718005324/http://wwwalt.med-rz.uni-sb.de/med_fak/physiol1/LDM/chemotopic_2.htm |date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Virginia Collings investigated the topic again, and confirmed that all the tastes exist on all parts of the tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collings |first=V. B. |year=1974 |title=Human Taste Response as a Function of Locus of Stimulation on the Tongue and Soft Palate |journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics |volume=16 |pages=169–174 |doi=10.3758/bf03203270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taste belt ==
The misinterpreted 2013 diagram in the article that sparked this myth shows human taste buds distributed in a "taste belt" along the inside of the tongue.

Prior to this, A. Hoffmann had concluded, in 1875, that the dorsal center of the human tongue has practically no fungiform papillae and taste buds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoffmann |first=A. |date=1875 |title=Über die Verbreitung der Geschmacksknospen beim Menschen |language=de |trans-title=On the spread of taste buds in humans |journal=Archiv für pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und für klinische Medicin |volume=62 |pages=516–530 |doi=10.1007/bf01928657}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was this finding that the diagram describes.

'''Vicki Fowler''' is a fictional character from the BBC [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by Emma Herry from the character's birth in 1986 to 1988, [[Samantha Leigh Martin]] from 1988 to 1995, and [[Scarlett Alice Johnson]] from 2003 to 2004. She is the daughter of [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]) and [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]). The character is born in the serial, conceived in a controversial storyline about teenage pregnancy. Exploiting a [[whodunnit]] angle, at the time of the first showing, viewers were not initially told who was the father, and press interest in the fledgling show escalated as journalists attempted to guess. The audience finally discovered his identity in October 1985 in episode 66. Written by series co-creator/script-editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, it was considered a landmark episode in the show's history. Early suspects were [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) and [[Kelvin Carpenter]] ([[Paul J. Medford]]), but then four possible suspects are seen leaving the Square early in the episode: [[Tony Carpenter]] ([[Oscar James]]), [[Ali Osman]] ([[Nejdet Salih]]), [[Andy O'Brien (EastEnders)|Andy O'Brien]] ([[Ross Davidson]]), and Den Watts. As Michelle waits by their rendezvous point, a car pulls up and the fluffy white legs of the soap landlord's poodle [[Roly]] leap out of a car to give it all away: Den Watts is the father of Michelle's baby.&lt;ref name="first10years"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this storyline the programme started to appear in newspaper [[cartoon]]s as it moved more and more into the public mainstream.&lt;ref name="insidestory"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|author2=Holland, Tony |authorlink2=Tony Holland |title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders - The Inside Story]] |year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|isbn=0-563-20601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vicki's character was written out in 1995, after Susan Tully, who played Vicki's mother Michelle, decided to leave the soap. After an eight-year absence, she was reintroduced by Executive Producer [[Louise Berridge]] in 2003 as a rebellious teenager. Her reintroduction was part of the soap's attempt to rebuild the Watts clan, a successful family headed by Den, that featured prominently in the 1980s. Johnson quit the role in 2004. The media was generally critical about the character upon her return due to her American accent and its sudden disappearance. During the character's original stint, a storyline featuring Vicki being kidnapped was criticised due to its coincidental airing alongside the real-life abduction and [[Murder of James Bulger|murder of toddler James Bulger]].

==Storylines==

===1986–1995===
16-year-old Michelle Fowler gets pregnant in 1985 after a one-night stand with her best friend [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]]'s ([[Letitia Dean]]) father, [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]). Her family decide Michelle should have an abortion but she refuses, keeping the baby but keeping the father's name a secret. Vicki, named in honour of her great-grandparents [[Lou Beale]] ([[Anna Wing]]) and Lou's late husband Albert, is born in 1986 and Den is allowed to hold her but he and Michelle agree that he should keep his distance so nobody guesses he is her father. Michelle raises Vicki with her fiance, [[Lofty Holloway]] ([[Tom Watt]]), who she marries after jilting him at the altar, although Den provides for Vicki secretly. After [[Sue Osman]] ([[Sandy Ratcliff]]) realises that she has had a [[phantom pregnancy]], she is devastated and suggests to Michelle that she lets her and [[Ali Osman]] ([[Nejdet Salih]]) adopt Vicki, which infuriates Michelle. Vicki's grandmother, [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]), realises Den is Vicki's father when she sees him give money to Michelle and slaps him. Lofty begins to pressure Michelle to let him adopt Vicki and have another child, but their marriage soon breaks down after Michelle has an abortion and Michelle refuses to name Vicki's father upon Lofty's departure. When Den is shot and presumed dead, Michelle tells Sharon that Vicki is her half-sister and Sharon is devastated whilst Arthur is furious. Vicki survives meningitis but [[Dr Legg]] ([[Leonard Fenton]]) fails to diagnose it, reuniting Michelle and Sharon.

Michelle decides to go on the run with [[Clyde Tavernier]] ([[Steven Woodcock]]) after he is accused of murdering [[Eddie Royle]] ([[Michael Melia]]), taking Vicki and [[Kofi Tavernier]] (Marcel Smith), Clyde's son, with them. Michelle and Clyde are caught by the police when trying to flee the country and Vicki and Kofi are sent to a children's home, but are later collected by their grandmothers. Vicki is kidnapped when an old woman, [[Audrey Whittingham]] (Shirley Dixon), takes her from outside her school. A national police investigation is launched and Vicki is returned home safely. When Michelle is shot by [[Dougie Briggs]] (Max Gold), Vicki discover she is Sharon's half-sister when she stays with Sharon and her husband, [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) and the following day, Sharon explains things to Vicki. Michelle is furious with Sharon about Vicki knowing. The truth about Vicki's paternity spreads and Michelle's aunt, [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), is upset about not being told by Michelle herself, finding out from [[Mandy Salter]] ([[Nicola Stapleton]]). In October 1995, Michelle and 9-year-old Vicki leave Walford for [[Birmingham, Alabama]], in the [[United States]].

===2003–2004===
A teenage Vicki returns to Walford in February 2003 when she runs away from home. She has been arguing regularly with Michelle and it is decided that she can stay in Walford. After clashing with her grandmother Pauline, Vicki moves in with Sharon. Manipulative and mischievous, Vicki does as she pleases. Just weeks later, she discovers that she and Sharon have a half-brother, [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]) - and persuades him to move to Walford. When she becomes pregnant by [[Spencer Moon]] ([[Christopher Parker]]), Sharon, who believes she is infertile, offers Vicki £10,000 to give her the baby to bring up as her own. Spencer wants to be a father but Vicki terminates the pregnancy.

Dennis soon tells Vicki that Den, who had supposedly died in 1989, is alive and living in [[Spain]], and she brings him back to the Square to reunite with his family. She's horrified to discover that Sharon and Dennis have started a romantic relationship. Although they aren't biologically related, Vicki cannot accept it and rebels by dating [[Ash Ferreira]] ([[Raji James]]), which ends when he realizes that she is using him to get at her siblings. Eventually, Vicki and Den's objections take their toll on Sharon and Dennis and they end the relationship.

In 2004, an 18-year-old Vicki starts a relationship with her 46-year-old college lecturer, [[Tommy Grant (EastEnders)|Tommy Grant]] ([[Robert Cavanah]]); her family, particularly stepmother [[Chrissie Watts]] ([[Tracy-Ann Oberman]]), are outraged. Tommy feigns love for Vicki and they talk about leaving Walford to go travelling. Knowing that Tommy is untrustworthy, Chrissie attempts to seduce him. After a brief kiss, Chrissie strips him naked in the toilets of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], on the promise that she will soon join him. She steals his clothes and forces Vicki to see him for the lying cheat he is. Vicki is devastated and initially furious with Chrissie but eventually realizes she had her best interests at heart.

During a family meal on Christmas Day 2004, Sharon and Dennis announce that they have resumed their romantic relationship, only for Dennis's girlfriend [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]) to announce that she is pregnant. Sharon decides to go to America alone and persuades Dennis to stay with Zoe and their baby. Den talks to Sharon alone, trying to persuade her to stay. Vicki overhears him say he does not love Vicki as much as he loves Sharon. Deciding she cannot live with such a father, Vicki decides to return to her mother in America. It is later revealed that she has moved to Australia and reunited with Spencer. In January 2014, Sharon tells Spencer's brother, [[Alfie Moon]] ([[Shane Richie]]), that they need someone to help them open a bar in Sydney, so Alfie goes there for a few weeks to work with them.

==Creation and development==

===Conception and childhood characterisation===
The conception of Vicki Fowler in 1985 was one of the first controversial storylines featured in ''EastEnders'' since its inception that February, as it involved the pregnancy of a schoolgirl, [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]). Exploiting a [[whodunnit]] angle, viewers were not initially told who was the father, and press interest in the fledgling show escalated as journalists attempted to guess. The audience finally discovered his identity in October 1985 on episode 66. Written by series co-creator/script-editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, it was considered a landmark episode in the show's history. Four possible suspects were seen leaving the Square early in the episode: [[Tony Carpenter]] ([[Oscar James]]), [[Ali Osman]] ([[Nejdet Salih]]), [[Andy O'Brien (EastEnders)|Andy O'Brien]] ([[Ross Davidson]]), and Den Watts ([[Leslie Grantham]]). As Michelle waited by their rendezvous point, a car pulled up and the fluffy white legs of the soap landlord's poodle [[Roly]] leapt out of a car and gave it all away: Den Watts had fathered Michelle's baby.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; After this storyline the programme started to appear in newspaper [[cartoon]]s as it moved more and more into the public mainstream.&lt;ref name="insidestory"/&gt;

Baby Emma Henry originated the role and played Vicki until 1988, when her parents moved to Scotland. The role was recast to Samantha Leigh Martin, who learned to call Susan Tully "Mummy Shell" and referred to [[Letitia Dean]] who played her mum's best friend, "Daddy [[Sharon Rickman|Sharon]]".&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|The EastEnders Handbook]] |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=978-0-563-36292-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tully has commented, "What's lovely about working with Samantha is that she's always happy. When it comes to work, she knows it's playing a pretend game, she knows my real name but she knows to call me 'Mummy Shell' when the cameras are running. If she isn't involved for a couple of weeks, I like to visit her at home, so she's always relaxed with me."&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt; Tully worried about this when it came to filming scenes in 1989 where Vicki contracted meningitis and was hospitalised and placed in an incubator with tubes attached to her body.&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt; Tully said, "[Samantha] has seen me in all kinds of situations but I didn't know how she'd cope if I cried over her".&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt; At Tully's suggestion, the BBC built a hospital room with minimal equipment and a consultant was present to make sure the BBC had the details correct and that neither the viewers or Samantha would be too distressed.&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt; Tully insisted that the child was not present when she had to film scenes of Michelle sobbing over the incubator.&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt;

In 1995, after 9 years onscreen being featured in various plot lines such as kidnapping, Vicki was written out of ''EastEnders'', moving to America with Michelle.&lt;ref name="return"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20021201/ai_n12857959/?tag=content;col1|title=Dirty Den love child returning|publisher=[[Sunday Mirror]]|date=1 December 2002|accessdate=12 August 2009 | first=Ben | last=Dowell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recast (2003)===
In 2002, Executive Producer [[Louise Berridge]] decided to reintroduce the character 8 years after she had last appeared. Auditions were held to cast the role to a professional actor; however, auditionees were not informed which character they were auditioning for. The first audition was a group workshop of 30 auditionees, who were asked to perform improvisations. After whittling down potential actors from 500 to 4,&lt;ref name="watts"/&gt; the second stage of the audition process was an interview with ''EastEnders''' Casting Director. The auditionees were asked to perform a monologue in front of a camera and do a screen test with one of the actors already in the show, [[Christopher Parker]], who played [[Spencer Moon]].&lt;ref name="int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/backstage/cast/interviews/interview_content/interview_scarlett_johnson.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040909030737/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/backstage/cast/interviews/interview_content/interview_scarlett_johnson.shtml |title=Scarlett Johnson (Vicki Fowler) |publisher=[[BBC Online]] |archivedate=9 September 2004 |accessdate=7 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 17-year-old actress [[Scarlett Johnson]] was cast: "At the second audition they gave me a monologue to read, but they'd been really careful about it. They hadn't said what the character's name was, they didn't give away anything in the monologue that might tell me who I was auditioning for. So I didn't know until I got the part who I was going to be playing--I'd been guessing for ages!" Asked how she felt when she knew she was playing Vicki Fowler, a character linked to the show's early history who is the daughter of 2 prominent original characters, Johnson said: "I felt very honoured, but it was quite scary. I knew there'd be a lot of people out there with expectations of what she'd be like. But it's good fun actually. It means you don't have to introduce yourself to everyone. You can really play with that [...] My family are ''EastEnders'' addicts, we've watched it our whole lives. I remember the first Vicki, I remember Michelle and I definitely remember Dirty Den! My knowledge of the show really helped a lot, because I didn't have to do any research into the character. When I joined the show, I felt like I was meeting the actors for a second time. I'd already met them in my home on TV, then I had to actually meet them in real life!"&lt;ref name="int"/&gt; The character made her reappearance in January 2003, turning up unexpectedly at her grandmother [[Pauline Fowler|Pauline's]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) house.&lt;ref name="return"/&gt;

To signify the character's 8 years living in America, Johnson was required to use an American accent while playing Vicki. She was given a voice coach and a sheet of American phrases to practice weekly. She commented, "It is hard work, but it's becoming second nature now. As soon as I know that I'm Vicki, the accent just comes with it."&lt;ref name="int"/&gt; After 6 months in the role, Vicki dropped the American accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/legacygallery/gallery-4896/EastEnders-Exits.html?selectedImage=41485|title=EastEnders Exits|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson explained the reason for the change in 2004: "The producers knew that I had to have an American accent when I came into the show because my character had been living in America but it's not the kind of accent that you'd want to have for a long time on a show like ''EastEnders''. It's not something that's going to fit in for a long period of time. What would have been perfect would have been to have it gradually fade out, but as you film 8 episodes at a time, this would be nigh on impossible. The decision was made that in the story Vicki was coming to terms with the fact that she wanted to live in London so therefore she was going to make a conscious effort to fit in with everyone around her and blend in with London life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/threecounties/read_this/2004/01/scarlett_johnson.shtml|title=Scarlett woman in the Square!|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reintroduction of Vicki was part of the producers' plan to reform the Watts family, including the resurrection of Vicki's father Den, who had been presumed dead for 14 years. Discussing working with Leslie Grantham, who played Vicki's "iconic" father Den, Johnson said, "I was 2 when he left ''EastEnders'' [in 1989] so I never witnessed the hype surrounding him. I'm very aware of the legend. How could I not be? My only concern was that he should take me seriously [and] It's been fabulous. I can't wait for our scenes to be shown. They're really edgy and no one does edgy better than Leslie. It's been a massive challenge but I think the results are incredibly hard-hitting. ''EastEnders'' is becoming more like a serial drama than a soap. It's so well-written."&lt;ref name="watts"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20030713/ai_n12872325/?tag=content;col1|title=They said you've got the job as Dirty Den's love child..I said no|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=13 July 2003|accessdate=12 August 2009 | first=Richard | last=Barber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
Vicki has been described as a "little madam" and a rebel.&lt;ref name="watts"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/tv_film/newsid_3573000/3573682.stm|title=Vicki Fowler to leave EastEnders |publisher=[[CBBC]]|date=17 August 2004|accessdate=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An ''EastEnders'' source commented, "Vicki has inherited a lot of her dad Den's traits - she is going to be a right handful".&lt;ref name="return"/&gt; Johnson has said, "Everyone loves to hate her, but I rather like that. I'd be more upset if she was nondescript. At least I provoke a passionate response in people. It's great being a bad girl."&lt;ref name="watts"/&gt;

===Departure (2004)===
In August 2004, the BBC announced that Johnson had decided to quit her role as Vicki.&lt;ref name="quit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3572978.stm|title=EastEnders' Vicki to leave show|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=17 August 2004|accessdate=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She commented, "I've had a really good two years, enjoyed all the experiences but it's time to move on".&lt;ref name="quit"/&gt; A spokesman for the soap said, "It’s her decision to go. We’d like to thank her for all her fantastic work and wish her the very best of luck."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/93292/Vicki-to-quit-the-Square.html|title=Vicki to quit the Square |work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=17 August 2004|accessdate=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson filmed her final scenes in October and her departure coincided with that of Vicki's half-sister, Sharon ([[Letitia Dean]]).&lt;ref name="quit"/&gt;  Vicki departed on the Christmas Day episode of 2004. 12.3 million viewers watched the episodes that involved the Watts family's disbandment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4126341.stm|title=BBC wins Christmas ratings fight |publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=26 December 2004|accessdate=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media reports claimed that there were plans to bring Vicki back the following year, played by a new actress; this proved to be false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20040829/ai_n12905860/?tag=content;col1|title=Fowler play as Vicki returns|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=29 August 2004|accessdate=12 August 2009 | first=Suzanne | last=Kerins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her character was notably absent at the funerals of Vicki's father Den in September 2005, her brother Dennis in January 2006, and her grandmother Pauline in January 2007.

Following her departure from ''EastEnders'', Johnson was more candid in her reasons for leaving: "I've had a great time but it got to the point where I was sat in bed at night thinking: 'Tomorrow will my character be crying, getting drunk or having an argument?'. It soon became physically exhausting and draining [...] I don't think the producers were very happy when I said I wanted to leave. I was still very new and they had just set up the new Watts dynasty but no-one could have made me change my mind. When I said to the producers I wanted to go they told me they might have to recast Vicki. I don't mind. Life goes on and EastEnders goes on. I wouldn't want to go back at the moment - but never say never."&lt;ref name="glad"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/I'm+so+glad+I've+left+EastEnders%3b+ALBERT+SQUARE+BEAUTY+SCARLETT...-a0126477958|title=I'm so glad I've left EastEnders|publisher=The People|date=26 December 2004 | first=Caroline|last=Barrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
According to author Hilary Kingsley, the scenes in ''EastEnders''' early years that showed toddler Vicki  "chattering happily" with the baby actor who played her uncle [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]] ([[Jon Peyton Price]]) were viewer favourites.&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt; ''EastEnders'' was criticised in 1993 for featuring a storyline about child abduction at an inappropriate time. In the storyline, 6-year old Vicki was abducted, leaving Michelle frantic with worry. In what has been described as a "coincidence of ill-timing," the storyline was screened at the same time as the real-life abduction and murder of 2-year-old [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]]. The BBC was forced to transmit a health warning prior to the airing of the episodes, announcing that the storyline would be "resolved positively."&lt;ref name="bulger"&gt;{{cite book |author= Lesley Henderson|title= Social issues in television fiction |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8l_TcZfmuDoC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=eastenders+james+bulger#v=onepage&amp;q=eastenders%20james%20bulger&amp;f=false|year=2007|publisher=Performing Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, ''Social Issues in Television'', a senior, nameless script editor opined that the abduction storyline sought to engage the audience at the expense of any parent's realistic concerns: "We get it wrong when we take the easy route like the kidnap snatch with Vicki. My argument about this was that I am a father but have never had my kids snatched. If I'm just sitting at home and my children are out late at night and they say they're going to be back at midnight and they don't come back, you immediately think they're dead and you start to worry. If they'd actually been snatched, it would have affected my entire life forever. I would never have recovered from it. I would have been frightened every time one of them left my side. Therefore the consequence of running a storyline like that is immense. If we were being totally responsible about it the fallout on Michelle would have been, well I just don't think she would have been the same person again."

The character received media criticism due to her American accent upon her reintroduction in 2003.&lt;ref name="watts"/&gt; Johnson said, "I knew that would happen because I'm the only character who speaks differently. I haven't taken any of that to heart."&lt;ref name="watts"/&gt; However, when the accent was altered from American to British, this received criticism too with Ian Hyland from the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' describing it as "hilarious" and branding the character "Go Away Again Vicki".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20030921/ai_n12876517/?tag=content;col1|title=TV WEEK: EastEnders|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=21 September 2003|accessdate=30 July 2009 | first=Ian | last=Hyland}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He added, "Presumably the producers decided the reason viewers found her so annoying was her whiny American voice. Try again, guys."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20030928/ai_n12877277/?tag=content;col1|title=LISA GETS ON MY PIP|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=23 September 2003|accessdate=30 July 2009 | first=Ian | last=Hyland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon her departure in 2004, Johnson was also critical about her character's alternating accent: "When I took the job they weren't sure what accent they wanted Vicki to have and about a week before they told me it should be American. I did that for a few months and then one day out of the blue I arrived on set and they told me they wanted me to change to Cockney. It was the producer's decision. I was as stunned as everyone else - all the criticism was perfectly justified. It's probably the most stupid decision they could have made. People assumed I was slipping out of the accent - but it was nothing to do with me. I've taken a lot of stick. But it doesn't bother me because I know the truth."&lt;ref name="glad"/&gt;

A proportion of viewers responded negatively when Vicki was shown to have an abortion. Johnson claims she received abusive letters from fans of the show and that she was stopped in the street twice by older women who told her "it was quite wrong [...] to have got rid of the baby. I found that awkward at the time. But, gradually, I came to realise it was rather flattering. Those women believed in my character so completely they forgot she wasn't real. So now I think I must have been doing a good job."&lt;ref name="watts"/&gt; Johnson has since been critical of the storylines given to her character describing them as weak.&lt;ref name="glad"/&gt;

The '''Youra Potsherds''' (or '''Gioura Potsherds''') are [[ceramic]] fragments dated to 6000 BC – 5500 BC discovered during systematic explorations in the "Cyclops Cave" at the uninhabited [[Gioura|islet of Youra]] (20 miles from [[Alonissos]]) in the northern [[Sporades]], an [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] archipelago off the coast of [[Thessaly]] in [[Greece]]. These fragments were discovered in 1992 by [[Adamantios Sampson]], Inspector of Antiquities, during a project whose more general purpose was to clarify the prehistoric occupation sequence in the area, with an emphasis on the pre-pottery sequences from the Late [[Pleistocene]], especially two thick areas of deposits: Late Aegean [[Neolithic]] Ib and Early Neolithic II. 

Some of the incisions on the potsherds bear some apparent resemblance to letter shapes. Adamantios Sampson notes that the "vase bear[s] incised unidentifiable symbols. It is possible that it echoes evidence on an Aegean Neolithic 'script' or 'proto-script', a very fashionable subject of discussion in Greece, after similar finds in [[Lake Orestiada|Kastoria lake]], East [sic] Macedonia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gr/h/2/eh251.jsp?obj_id=1624 Cave of Cyclope], Greek Ministry of Culture; for the finds in Kastoria, or [[Lake Orestiada]], see the [[Dispilio Tablet]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adamantios Sampson, [http://www.magnesia-tourism.gr/%CE%95%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82%CE%A4%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CF%8C%CF%82/%CE%91%CF%81%CF%87%CE%B1%CE%B9%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82%CE%A4%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CF%8C%CF%82/%CE%A3%CF%80%CE%AE%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%9A%CF%8D%CE%BA%CE%BB%CF%89%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%93%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%8D%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82%CE%91%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%BD%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%85.aspx Magnisia Peripheral Unit: Cave of Cyclope, Youra, Alonnessos], ([http://www.magnesia-tourism.gr/%CE%91%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%B5%CF%81%CF%8E%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B1/tabid/91/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/52/language/en-US/Default.aspx signed from author at greek edition)]&lt;/ref&gt;
