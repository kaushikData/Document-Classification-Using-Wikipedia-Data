On 4 April 1975,&lt;ref group="Notes" name="DateNote"/&gt; a [[Lockheed C-5A Galaxy]] participating in [[Operation Babylift]] crashed on approach during an emergency landing at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base]], [[South Vietnam]]. The cause was ascribed to loss of flight control due to explosive decompression and structural failure. The accident marked the second operational loss and first fatal crash for the C-5 Galaxy fleet, and is the deadliest accident involving a U.S. military aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Background ==
Early in April 1975, with much of South Vietnam overrun by [[North Vietnam]]ese forces, the administration of US President [[Gerald Ford]] began instituting the evacuation of American citizens. To avoid alarming the host country, U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam [[Graham Martin]] authorized Americans to be flown out under several conditions, one of which was [[Operation Babylift]], in which American caregivers were paired with South [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] orphans.&lt;ref&gt;''Nixon, Ford, and the Abandonment of South Vietnam'', J. Edward Lee and Toby Haynsworth, McFarland and Company, {{ISBN|0-7864-1302-6}}, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
On the afternoon of Friday, 4 April 1975, C-5A, AF Ser. No. 68-0218, making the first flight of Operation Babylift, departed Tan Son Nhut Air Base for [[Clark Air Base]] in the [[Republic of the Philippines|Philippines]]. This first group of orphans would then transfer to charter flights and be welcomed by President Ford upon arriving in the United States at San Diego, California. At 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. the C-5A was over the [[South China Sea]] about {{convert|13|nmi|km}} off [[Vũng Tàu]],&lt;ref name="babylift" /&gt; South Vietnam, flying a heading of 136 degrees and climbing to an altitude of {{convert|23000|ft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. At that moment the locks on the rear loading ramp failed, causing the cargo door to open explosively. This caused [[explosive decompression]], temporarily filling the cabin with a whirlwind of fog and debris. The blowout severed control cables to the tail, causing two of four hydraulic systems to fail, including those for the rudder and elevator,&lt;ref name="LastFlight"/&gt; and leaving the flight control with only the use of one [[aileron]], [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoilers]], and power.

The pilot, [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Dennis "Bud" Traynor, and copilot, Captain Tilford Harp, attempted to regain control of the airplane, and to perform a 180&amp;nbsp;degree turn in order to return to Tan Son Nhut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/1991/August%201991/0891valor.aspx Valor: A Galaxy of Heroes], Air Force Magazine, August 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft began to exhibit [[phugoid]] oscillations, but the crew countered them and maintained a controlled descent of about {{convert|250|to|260|kn|km/h|lk=in}}. They were able to bring the plane to {{convert|4000|ft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} and begin the approach to Tan Son Nhut's runway 25L. While turning on final approach, the plane's descent rate suddenly began to increase rapidly.  The crew increased power to the engines in an attempt to arrest the descent, but despite their efforts, the plane touched down at 4:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. in a rice paddy, and skidded for a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m), became airborne again for another half-mile (800&amp;nbsp;m), crossing the [[Saigon River]], then hit a dike and broke up into four pieces. The fuel caught fire and some of the wreckage was set ablaze.

Survivors struggled to extricate themselves from the wreckage. The crash site was in a muddy rice paddy near the Saigon River, one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) from the nearest road. Fire engines could not reach the site, and helicopters had to set down some distance from the wreckage. About 100 South Vietnamese soldiers deployed around the site, which was near the site of an engagement with the [[Viet Cong]] the previous night. Out of 328 people on board, the death toll included 78 children, 35 [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam#Defence Attaché Office|Defence Attaché Office]] employees and 11 U.S. Air Force personnel; there were 173 survivors.&lt;ref name="LastFlight"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmSApdkHyWIC|page=29|title=Last Flight From Saigon|publisher=Diane Publishing|isbn=1-4289-8211-6|volume=IV|journal=USAF Southeast Asia Monograph Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the surviving orphans were eventually flown to the United States. The dead orphans were cremated and were interred at the cemetery of the St. Nikolaus Catholic Church in [[Pattaya]], Thailand.&lt;ref name="babylift"&gt;Commander in Chief Pacific Command History: Appendix III: Babylift, Carl O. Clever, CINCPAC Hawaii, 1976.  The Vietnam Center and Archive, Item 2132501008, accessed 28 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The accident would also "stand as the single largest loss of life" in the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]]'s history until the [[September 11 attacks]] because among the crash fatalities were five female DIA employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=THE VIETNAM CAULDRON: Defense Intelligence in the War for Southeast Asia|first=Michael B.|last=Petersen|url=http://www.dia.mil/Portals/27/Documents/About/History/Number%202%20The%20Vietnam%20Cauldron.pdf|series=Defense Intelligence Historical Perspectives, Number 2|year=2012|publisher=Defense Intelligence Agency: Historical Research Division|pages=34–35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aftermath ===
Some members of the [[United States Congress]] called for a grounding of C-5s. In the end, the fleet was put under severe operational restrictions for several months while the cause was established. The U.S. Air Force Accident Investigation Board attributed the survival of any on board to Captain Traynor{{'}}s unorthodox use of power and his decision to crash-land while the aircraft allowed some control. Captains Traynor and Harp, who both survived, were awarded the [[Air Force Cross (United States)|Air Force Cross]] for extraordinary valor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=3484|title=Dennis W Traynor Air Force Cross|publisher=Military Times Hall of Valor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=3452|title=Tilford W Harp Air Force Cross|publisher=Military Times Hall of Valor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-seven medals were awarded to crew members or their next of kin. USAF Flight Nurse, 1st Lieutenant Regina Aune, received the [[Cheney Award]] for 1975.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/109577/two-af-nurses-heroes-of-operation-babylift/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/information/heritage/person.asp?dec=&amp;pid=123006467 |title=Colonel Regina Aune |publisher=US Air Force |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912041251/http://www.af.mil/information/heritage/person.asp?dec=&amp;pid=123006467 |archivedate=12 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
[[File:ILA 2008 PD 061.JPG|thumb|right|Rear doors of a C5 Galaxy]]
Given the explosive manner in which the rear doors failed, sabotage was initially suspected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.super70s.com/Super70s/Tech/Aviation/Disasters/75-04-04(C5Vietnam).asp|title=C5 Crashes in Vietnam During Operation Babylift|author=Patrick Mondout}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the components were looted from the crash site, thereby complicating the investigation; the U.S. Air Force paid a bounty for parts from the wreckage to recover them from the local populace. The [[United States Navy]] [[amphibious cargo ship]] {{USS|Durham|LKA-114}}, [[frigate]] {{USS|Reasoner|FF-1063}}, and [[command ship]] {{USS|Blue Ridge|LCC-19}} were assigned to search for the flight data recorder in the South China Sea.&lt;ref name="babylift" /&gt; The recorder was found, and U.S. Navy ships and helicopters also discovered wreckage from the doors in the South China Sea as well as the body of a C-5 crewmember.&lt;ref name="babylift" /&gt;

When the rear doors were eventually recovered from the sea, investigation determined that some of the locks had not engaged properly. Maintenance records showed that locks had been cannibalized for spares, then subsequently improperly refitted so that not all the door locks were engaging correctly. Accounts also indicated the initial maintenance inspection noticed 5 of the 7 locks were not operating and failed the aircraft for flight.  With external organizational pressure to get the flight airborne, a second off-shift maintenance team was called in.  They subsequently missed the locks during inspection and the aircraft was cleared for flight. Furthermore, the flight crew confirmed that they had encountered difficulty closing the doors before take-off. As the air pressure differential increased with altitude, the few locks that were working correctly were unable to bear the load, and the door failed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19750404-0 Lockheed C-5A Galaxy Accident description] Aviation Safety Network 16 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatization==
The story of the disaster was featured on the seventh season of the [[Cineflex|Canadian made]], internationally distributed documentary series ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]'', in the episode [[List of Mayday episodes#ep53|"Operation Babylift"]].&lt;!--- various countries use various series and episode names, which is fully and properly covered at the links --&gt;

The '''2011 FIA European Truck Racing Championship''' was a multi-event motor racing championship for production based trucks held across Europe. The championship features a mix of professional motor racing teams and privately funded amateur drivers competing in highly modified versions of two-axle [[tractor unit]]s which conform to the technical regulations for the championship. It was the 27th European Truck Racing Championship season and began at [[Donington Park]] on April 22, with the finale at [[Circuit de la Sarthe#Bugatti Circuit|Le Mans]] on October 9 after ten events. The championship was won by Jochen Hahn, taking his first title.

==Teams and drivers==

'''Acute stress reaction''' (also called '''acute stress disorder''', '''psychological shock''', '''mental shock''', or simply '''shock''') is a [[psychology|psychological]] condition arising in response to a terrifying or [[Psychological trauma|traumatic event]], or witnessing a traumatic event that induces a strong [[emotional response]] within the individual. It should not be confused with the unrelated circulatory condition of [[shock(circulatory)|shock/hypoperfusion]]. Acute stress reaction (ASR) may develop into delayed stress reaction (better known as [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]], or PTSD) if stress is not correctly managed. ASR is characterized by re-living and avoiding reminders of an aversive event, as well as generalized [[hypervigilance]] after initial exposure to a traumatic event. ASR is differentiated from PTSD as a disorder that precedes it, and if symptoms last for more than one month, it will develop into PTSD. It can thus be thought of as the acute phase of PTSD.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17588928.2014.996212 |pmid=25599382 |title=Acute stress disorder modifies cerebral activity of amygdala and prefrontal cortex |journal=Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=39–43 |year=2015 |last1=Reynaud |first1=Emmanuelle |last2=Guedj |first2=Eric |last3=Trousselard |first3=Marion |last4=El Khoury-Malhame |first4=Myriam |last5=Zendjidjian |first5=Xavier |last6=Fakra |first6=Eric |last7=Souville |first7=Marc |last8=Nazarian |first8=Bruno |last9=Blin |first9=Olivier |last10=Canini |first10=Frédéric |last11=Khalfa |first11=Stephanie }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
The ''DSM-IV'' specifies that ASD must be accompanied by the presence of dissociative symptoms, which largely differentiates it from PTSD.

Dissociative symptoms include a sense of numbing or detachment from emotional reactions, a sense of physical detachment, such as seeing oneself from another perspective, decreased awareness of one’s surroundings, the perception that one’s environment is unreal or dreamlike, and the inability to recall critical aspects of the traumatic event (dissociative amnesia).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Acute Stress Disorder: A Handbook Of Theory, Assessment, And Treatment |last=Bryant |first=R. |last2=Harvey |first2=A. |publisher=American Psychological Association |year=2000 |isbn= |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=3–40, 87–134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the characteristic dissociative symptoms, Acute Stress Disorder from the DSM-5 can present from four other distinct symptom clusters such as&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;:

* Intrusion Symptom Cluster
** recurring and distressing dreams, flashbacks, and/or memories related to the traumatic event.
** intense/prolonged psychological distress or somatic reactions to internal or external traumatic cues.
* Negative Mood Cluster
** a persistent inability to experience positive emotions such as happiness, loving feelings, or satisfaction.
* Avoidance Symptom Cluster
** the avoidance of distressing memories, thoughts, feelings, or external reminders of said distressing memories, thoughts, and feelings of, or closely associated to traumatic event.
* Arousal Symptom Cluster
** Sleep disturbances, hypervigilance, difficulties with concentration, easy to startle, and irritability/anger/aggression.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Causes ==
There are several theoretical perspectives on trauma response, including cognitive, biological, and psychobiological. While the theories are PTSD-specific, they are still useful in understanding ASD, as both share many symptoms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Acute stress disorder (abbreviated ASD, and not to be confused with [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorder]]) is the result of a [[Psychological trauma|traumatic event]] in which the person experiences or witnesses an event that causes the victim/witness to experience extreme, disturbing, or unexpected fear, stress, or pain, and that involves or threatens serious injury, perceived serious injury, or death to themselves or someone else. A study of rescue personnel after exposure to a traumatic event showed no gender difference in acute stress reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1534765606294557 |title=Gender differences and acute stress reactions among rescue personnel 36 to 48 hours after exposure to traumatic event |journal=Traumatology |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=139–42 |year=2006 |last1=Ben-Ezra |first1=Menachem |last2=Essar |first2=Nir |last3=Saar |first3=Ronen }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acute stress reaction is a variation of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).

A recent study found that a ''single'' stressful event may cause long-term consequences in the brain.  This result calls the traditional distinction between the effects of acute vs chronic stress into question.&lt;ref name="pmid 27698433"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/mp.2016.175 |pmid=27698433 |laysummary=http://neurosciencenews.com/brain-changes-stress-event-5589/ |laysource=Neuroscience News |laydate=November 23, 2016 |title=Acute stress is not acute: Sustained enhancement of glutamate release after acute stress involves readily releasable pool size and synapsin I activation |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |volume=22 |issue=9 |pages=1226–1227 |year=2016 |last1=Musazzi |first1=L |last2=Tornese |first2=P |last3=Sala |first3=N |last4=Popoli |first4=M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathophysiology ==
Stress is characterized by specific physiological responses to aversive or noxious stimuli.

[[Hans Selye]] was the first to coin the term “general adaptation syndrome”, to suggest that stress induced physiological responses proceed through the stages of alarm, resistance, and exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8199583 |pmc=2560943 |year=1993 |author1=Butler |first1=G |title=Definitions of stress |journal=Occasional paper (Royal College of General Practitioners) |issue=61 |pages=1–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system gives rise to a specific set of physiological responses in response to physical or psychological stress. The body’s response to stress is also termed “fight-or-flight response”, and it is characterized by an increase in blood flow to skeletal muscles, the heart and brain, a rise in heart rate and blood pressure, as well as dilation of pupils, and an increase in the amount of glucose released by the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vander's Human Physiology: The Mechanisms Of Body Function |last=Widmaier |first=Eric P. |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-259-60779-0 |location=Boston |page=182 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The onset of an acute stress response is associated with specific physiological actions in the sympathetic nervous system, both directly and indirectly through the release of [[adrenaline]] and to a lesser extent [[noradrenaline]] from the [[adrenal medulla|medulla]] of the [[adrenal gland]]s. These catecholamine [[hormone]]s facilitate immediate physical reactions by triggering increases in heart rate and breathing, constricting blood vessels. An abundance of catecholamines at neuroreceptor sites facilitates reliance on spontaneous or intuitive behaviors often related to combat or escape.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Normally, when a person is in a serene, unstimulated state, the "firing" of neurons in the [[locus ceruleus]] is minimal. A novel stimulus, once perceived, is relayed from the [[sensory cortex]] of the brain through the [[thalamus]] to the [[brain stem]]. That route of signaling increases the rate of noradrenergic activity in the locus ceruleus, and the person becomes alert and attentive to the environment.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

If a stimulus is perceived as a threat, a more intense and prolonged discharge of the locus ceruleus activates the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (Thase &amp; Howland, 1995). The activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to the release of [[norepinephrine]] from nerve endings acting on the heart, blood vessels, respiratory centers, and other sites. The ensuing physiological changes constitute a major part of the acute stress response. The other major player in the acute stress response is the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]]. Stress activates this axis and produces neurobiological changes. These chemical changes increase the chances of survival by bringing the physiological system back to homeostasis. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsigos|first=Constantine|last2=Chrousos|first2=George P|date=October 2002|title=Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, neuroendocrine factors and stress|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-3999(02)00429-4|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|volume=53|issue=4|pages=865–871|doi=10.1016/s0022-3999(02)00429-4|issn=0022-3999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The autonomic nervous system controls all automatic functions in the body and contains two subsections within it that aids in response to an acute stress reaction. These two subunits are the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic response is colloquially known as the "[[Fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]]" response, indicated by accelerated pulse and respiration rates, pupil dilation, and a general feeling of anxiety and hyper-awareness.  This is caused by the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal glands. The epinephrine and norepinephrine strike the beta receptors of the heart, which feeds the heart sympathetic nerve fibers in order to increase the strength of heart muscle contraction; as a result more blood gets circulated, increasing the heart rate and respiratory rate. The sympathetic nervous system also stimulates the skeletal system and muscular system in an effort to pump more blood to those areas to handle the acute stress. Simultaneously the sympathetic nervous system inhibits the digestive system and the urinary system in order to optimize blood flow to the heart, lungs, and skeletal muscles. This plays a role in the alarm reaction stage. The para-sympathetic response is colloquially known as the "rest and digest" response, indicated by reduced heart and respiration rates, and more obviously by a temporary loss of consciousness if the system is fired at a rapid rate. The parasympathetic nervous system stimulates the digestive system and urinary system in order to send more blood to those systems to increase the process of digestion. In order to do this, it must inhibit the cardiovascular system and respiratory system in an effort to optimize blood flow to the digestive tract causing low heart and respiratory rates. Parasympathetic plays no role in acute stress response (VanPutte Regan Russo 2014).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Wilderness and Rescue Medicine |last=Isaac |first=Jeffrey E. |last2=Johnson |first2=David E. |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-7637-8920-6 |location=Burlington, MA |pages=27–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that patients with ASD have overactive right amygdalae and pre-frontal cortices, both structures that are involved in the fear-processing pathway.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Diagnosis==
According to the DSM 5, symptom presentation must last for 3 days in order for a diagnosis of ASD to be made. If symptoms persist past 1 month, the diagnosis of PSTD is explored.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5 ed.)|last=American Psychiatric Association|first=|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|year=2013|isbn=|location=Arlington, VA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There must be a clear temporal connection between the impact of an exceptional stressor and the onset of symptoms; onset is usually within a few minutes or days but may occur up to one month after the stressor. In addition, the symptoms show a mixed and usually changing picture; in addition to the initial state of "daze," depression, anxiety, anger, despair, overactivity, and withdrawal may all be seen, but no one type of symptom predominates for long; the symptoms usually resolve rapidly in those cases where removal from the stressful environment is possible; in cases where the stress continues or cannot by its nature be reversed, the symptoms usually begin to diminish after 24–48 hours and are usually minimal after about 3 days.&lt;ref name="Mental-Health-Matters.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mental-health-matters.com/disorders/anxiety-disorders/acute-stress |title=Acute Stress Disorder&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2013-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726172815/http://www.mental-health-matters.com/disorders/anxiety-disorders/acute-stress |archive-date=2013-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''DSM-5'' specifies there is a higher prevalence rate of ASD in females compared to males due to higher risk of experiencing traumatic events and neurobiological gender differences in stress response that increase the risk of ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5 ed.)|last=American Psychiatric Association|first=|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|year=2013|isbn=|location=Arlington, VA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
This disorder may resolve itself with time or may develop into a more severe disorder such as PTSD. However, results of Creamer, O'Donnell, and Pattison's (2004) study of 363 patients suggests that a diagnosis of acute stress disorder had only limited predictive validity for PTSD. Creamer et al. did find that re-experiences of the traumatic event and arousal were better predictors of PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0005-7967(03)00141-4 |pmid=14975772 |title=The relationship between acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder in severely injured trauma survivors |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=315–28 |year=2004 |last1=Creamer |first1=Mark |last2=o'Donnell |first2=Meaghan L |last3=Pattison |first3=Phillipa }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early pharmacotherapy may prevent the development of posttraumtic symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14573324 |year=2003 |author1=Vaiva |first1=G |title=Immediate treatment with propranolol decreases posttraumatic stress disorder two months after trauma |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=54 |issue=9 |pages=947–9 |last2=Ducrocq |first2=F |last3=Jezequel |first3=K |last4=Averland |first4=B |last5=Lestavel |first5=P |last6=Brunet |first6=A |last7=Marmar |first7=C. R |doi=10.1016/s0006-3223(03)00412-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, early trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TFCBT) for those with a diagnosis of ASD can protect an individual from chronic PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kornør|first=Hege|last2=Winje|first2=Dagfinn|last3=Ekeberg|first3=Øivind|last4=Weisæth|first4=Lars|last5=Kirkehei|first5=Ingvild|last6=Johansen|first6=Kjell|last7=Steiro|first7=Asbjørn|date=September 2008|title=Early trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy to prevent chronic post-traumatic stress disorder and related symptoms: A systematic review and meta-analysis|url=|journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume=8|pages=8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have been conducted to assess the efficacy of counselling and psychotherapy for people with ASD. Cognitive behavioral therapy which included exposure and cognitive restructuring was found to be effective in preventing PTSD in patients diagnosed with ASD with clinically significant results at 6 months follow-up. A combination of relaxation, [[cognitive restructuring]], imaginal exposure, and in vivo exposure was superior to supportive counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Lambert |editor1-first=M.J. |year=2004 |title=Bergin and Garfield's Handbook of Psychotherapy and Behavioral Change |location=New York |publisher=Wiley }}{{page needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mindfulness]] based stress reduction programs also appear to be effective for stress management.&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/2156587214543143 |pmid=25053754 |title=Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction as a Stress Management Intervention for Healthy Individuals |journal=Journal of Evidence-Based Complementary &amp; Alternative Medicine |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=271–86 |year=2014 |last1=Sharma |first1=Manoj |last2=Rush |first2=Sarah E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a wilderness context where counseling, psychotherapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy is unlikely to be available, the treatment for acute stress reaction is very similar for the treatment of [[cardiogenic shock]], [[Shock (circulatory)|vascular shock]], and [[hypovolemic shock]]; that is, allowing the patient to lie down, providing reassurance, and removing the stimulus for the occurrence of the reaction.  In traditional shock cases, this is generally the relieving of pain from injuries or the stopping of blood loss.  In an acute stress reaction, this may be pulling a rescuer away from the emergency to calm down, or blocking the sight of an injured friend from a patient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
== History ==
The term ASR was first used to describe the symptoms of soldiers during [[World War I]] and [[World War II|II]], and it was therefore also termed [[combat stress reaction]] (CSR). Approximately 20% of U.S. troops displayed symptoms of CSR during WWII, and it was assumed to be a temporary response of healthy individuals to witnessing or experiencing traumatic events. Symptoms include depression, anxiety, withdrawal, confusion, paranoia and sympathetic hyperactivity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[American Psychological Association|APA]] officially included the term ASD in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]]'' in 1994, and prior to that, symptomatic individuals within the first month of trauma were diagnosed with [[adjustment disorder]]. According to the ''DSM IV'', ASR refers to the symptoms experienced right after exposure to a traumatic event, up until 48 hours after it. In contrast, ASD is defined by symptoms experienced after 48 hours of the event, up until one month past the event. Symptoms experienced for longer than one month are consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Air battle over Merklín''' was an air-to-air engagement between [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] and [[United States Air Forces in Europe|USAFE]] air units over the Czech village of [[Merklín (Plzeň-South District)|Merklín]], in the [[Bohemian Forest]], on 10 March 1953. During the action Czech pilot [[Jaroslav Šrámek]], flying a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]], shot down one of a pair of [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet|American F-84E]] Thunderjets (from [[53d Fighter Squadron|53rd Fighter Bomber Squadron]], [[36th Wing|36th Fighter-Bomber Wing]]). The American pilot, Lt. Warren G.Brown ejected from the aircraft, which crash-landed in German territory, approximately 35 kilometres (22&amp;nbsp;mi) from the border, and survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_303.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023142316/http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_303.shtml |archivedate=23 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Coilin O'Connor |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/czech-fighter-pilot-recalls-cold-war-dogfight |title=Radio Prague - Czech fighter pilot recalls Cold War dogfight |publisher=Radio.cz |date=2004-10-04 |accessdate=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Waterhouse''' (March 4, 1754, [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]] – October 2, 1846, [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]]) was a [[physician]], co-founder and [[professor]] of [[Harvard Medical School]]. He is most well known for being the first doctor to test the [[smallpox vaccine]] in the United States, which he carried out on his own family.&lt;ref name="hno.harvard.edu"&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/05.20/waterhouse.html The Beginning of the End of Smallpox&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===

Waterhouse was born into a [[Quakers|Quaker]] family, although he never adopted the religion as his own.&lt;ref name="brown.edu"&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=W0070 Encyclopedia Brunoniana | Waterhouse, Benjamin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Timothy Waterhouse, a chair maker who also served on the Governor's Council, and Hannah Waterhouse.&lt;ref name="faqs.org"&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/health/bios/70/Benjamin-Waterhouse.html Benjamin Waterhouse Biography (1754-1846)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Born and raised in Rhode Island, his medical career began at age 16, when he apprenticed for a doctor in his hometown. At age 21, he left the United States to study medicine in Europe at several notable institutions, such as with Dr. [[John Fothergill (physician)|John Fothergill]] in [[London]], [[England]]. He was also educated in [[Edinburgh]] at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]]. He matriculated Oct. 28, 1778 at the [[Leiden University]]&lt;ref&gt;Album Studiosorum Academiae Lugduno Batavae MDLXXV-MDCCCLXXV, kol. 1128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Index to English speaking students who have graduated at Leyden university / by Edward Peacock, F.S.A. - London : For the Index society, by Longmans, Green &amp; co. 1883, p. 102, 1129.&lt;/ref&gt; and received at the same University his medical degree Apr. 19, 1780.&lt;ref&gt;Bronnen tot de geschiedenis der Leidsche Universiteit, zesde deel, 10 February 1765-21 February 1796: Catalogus promotorum ex die 14. Februarii anni 1765 / P.C. Molhuysen. - 's-Gravenhage : Martinus Nijhoff, ...., p. 108*.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R.W. Innes Smith 1932, p. 242"&gt;English-speaking students of medicine at the University of Leyden / R.W. Innes Smith. - Edinburgh/London : Oliver and Boyd, 1932, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; The title description of his thesis is: Dissertatio medica De sympathia partium corporis humani, ejusque, in explicandis et curandis morbis necessaria consideratione ... - Lugduni Batavorum : Th. Koet, 1780. - 38 p. ; 25&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Bibliotheca Medica Neerlandica, vol.

Innes Smith 1932, p. 242"/&gt; 
While living in [[Holland]], he roomed with future U.S. president [[John Adams]].&lt;ref name="hno.harvard.edu"/&gt;

===Medical career===
After returning to the United States in 1782, Waterhouse joined the faculty of the new medical school at Harvard as one of three professors, including [[John Warren (surgeon)|John Warren]] and Aaron Dexter, in the area of Theory and Practice of Physic. He was also elected that same year as a Fellow at [[Brown University|Rhode Island College]] (now "Brown University").&lt;ref name="brown.edu"/&gt; He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1795.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter W|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterW.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814, Waterhouse resigned his Harvard professorship after opposing a plan to establish the Medical School in Boston and attempting to found a rival medical school.&lt;ref name="brown.edu"/&gt;

====Smallpox vaccine====
Waterhouse first wrote to then-President [[John Adams]], his former roommate, hoping to spread the word about cowpox vaccinations preventing smallpox.  When he found President Adams unresponsive, he wrote a letter to Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]] entitled "A prospect of exterminating the smallpox."&lt;ref name="historyofvaccines.org"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/smallpox#EVT_000055| title = History of Vaccines Website – Waterhouse Brings Vaccination to the States | date=3 November 2010 | accessdate=3 November 2010| publisher=[[College of Physicians of Philadelphia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Jefferson replied with a letter dated Christmas Day, 1800, and soon offered his support. Once Jefferson became President the following year, Waterhouse introduced [[Edward Jenner]]'s method of cowpox vaccination in the United States.&lt;ref name="historyofvaccines.org"/&gt; He attempted to maintain a monopoly over the cowpox vaccine, for both financial reasons and to protect the vaccine from incompetent or fraudulent physicians. Waterhouse made the first vaccinations in the United States on four of his children. He commissioned a controlled experiment at the Boston Board of Health in which 19 vaccinated and 2 unvaccinated boys were exposed to the smallpox virus. The vaccinated boys demonstrated immunity and the 2 unvaccinated boys succumbed to the disease.&lt;ref name="faqs.org"/&gt;

===Personal life===
In 1788, he married Elizabeth Oliver, with whom he had six children. She died in childbirth in 1815. In 1819, he married Louisa Lee; no children resulted from this marriage.&lt;ref name="faqs.org"/&gt;

Waterhouse was a prickly character, with a tendency to become involved in controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Constance E. The New England Quarterly 82, no. 1 (2009): 198-200. http://www.jstor.org/stable/20474721.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military service===
Waterhouse had a commission in the [[U.S. Army]] during the [[War of 1812]] in the days before military physicians were accorded rank. He held the position of "Hospital Surgeon", in 1818 he was promoted to "Post Surgeon", and in 1821 he was honorably discharged.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, Edgar Erskine (1943), ''Victories of Army Medicine: Scientific Accomplishments of the Medical Department of the United States Army'', [[J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.|J. B. Lippincott Company]], pg 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years and death===
[[Image:Benjamin Waterhouse grave.jpg|right|thumb|Waterhouse's grave in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]]]]

Throughout the 1820s, Waterhouse was a strong supporter of [[Samuel Thomson]]'s medical system. He died in his home in Cambridge in 1846, and was survived by his wife Louisa. He is interred at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]], where Louisa erected a small monument in his honor.

Sundararajan and directed by Virendra Desai. Produced by Sagar Movietone, and based on the life of the [[Carnatic music]]ian [[Tyagaraja]], Mathirimangalam Natesa Iyer, Kamala and Seetha appeared in the leading roles. The film's success at the box office was largely attributed to its music.&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/cinema-columns/bhaktha-sri-thyagaraja-1937/article6092747.ece | title=Bhaktha Sri Thyagaraja (1937) | work=[[The Hindu]] | date=7 June 2014 | accessdate=23 October 2016 | last=Guy | first=Randor | authorlink=Randor Guy | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024104139/http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/cinema-columns/bhaktha-sri-thyagaraja-1937/article6092747.ece | archivedate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''Bhaktha Sri Thyagaraja'', alternatively known as ''Sri Thiagaraja Charitham'', was based on the life of the [[Carnatic music]]ian [[Tyagaraja]].&lt;ref name=hindu /&gt; It was produced by the [[Mumbai|Bombay]]-based Sagar Movietone. Director Virendra Desai was not fluent in Tamil, so T. P. Kalyanarama Sastry, a lawyer from Chennai who was also involved in film production, worked as an associate director. An attorney from Chennai, M. P. Sundararajan wrote the screenplay. His son M. P. S. Pranatharthiharan, played a child's role in the film. On-location filming took place at the [[Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala|Tirupathi Venkateshwara Temple]].&lt;ref name=hindu /&gt; The final length of the film was {{Convert|14533|feet|metres}}.&lt;ref name=book /&gt;

==Soundtrack==
There were 32 songs in the film. The [[Raga|ragas]] used in the film include [[Todi (raga)|Thodi]], [[Nata (raga)|Naata]], [[Bowli]], [[Kapi (raga)|Kapi]], [[Kalyani (raga)|Kalyani]], [[Atana]], [[Kanada (raga group)|Kaanada]], [[Bilahari]], Neelambari and Nalinakanthi. Almost all the songs were in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. Mathirimangalam Natesa Iyer, an Carnatic musician, sang most of the songs. There were two songs in Tamil: one by a group sung by the thieves who were waiting to way-laid Tyagaraja. The other Tamil song "Sivano" is a translation of Tygaraja's popular kruthi "Evareni".&lt;ref name=hindu /&gt;

== Reception ==
According to film historian [[Randor Guy]], the film was a box office success mainly because of the music. He stated the film would be remembered for "The classic compositions of Saint Thyagaraja rendered by Natesa Iyer and the on-screen narration by Virendra Desai."&lt;ref name="hindu" /&gt;

'''''Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventures''''' is a 1990 [[animated television series]] [[Spin-off (media)|spinoff]] from the 1989 [[Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure|film of the same title]], following the misadventures of two [[time travel|time-travelling]] [[slacker]]s as they travel into the distant past and future. It is part of the [[Bill &amp; Ted (franchise)|''Bill &amp; Ted'' franchise]].

==Overview==
The first season of the animated series was produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]] and aired on [[CBS]] in 1990, with [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Alex Winter]], [[George Carlin]], and [[Bernie Casey]] reprising their film roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Networks Juggle Saturday Morning TV Lineups | date = April 11, 1990 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-11/entertainment/ca-1291_1_morning-schedule | work = Los Angeles Times | agency = [[United Press International]] | access-date = 2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the second season in 1991, the animated series switched production companies and networks, now airing on [[Fox Kids]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Fine-tuning cartoons for young and old | date = September 6, 1991 | work = Providence Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; and produced by [[DIC Entertainment]]. As [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] was also planning on airing a new live-action version series with the same name,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Rick | last = DuBrow | title = Fox Network Goes Out on a Limb Again | date = May 22, 1991 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1991-05-22/entertainment/ca-2250_1_fox-network | work = Los Angeles Times | access-date = 2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cast was replaced, and the leads were now voiced by Evan Richards and Christopher Kennedy, the actors who respectively portrayed Bill and Ted on the [[Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventures (1992 TV series)|short-lived 1992 live-action television series]]. The new episodes introduced a "Squint" phone booth that could take Bill and Ted into literature, television shows, and (after shrinking them) inside the human body. The new show had trouble catching on, and after one more season, the animated ''Bill &amp; Ted'' series was cancelled.

'''''Camille Claudel''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with a book and lyrics by [[Nan Knighton]] and music by [[Frank Wildhorn]], their second musical. It is based on the life of the real-life [[France|French]] [[sculpture|sculptor]] and graphic artist [[Camille Claudel|of the same name]]. The musical premiered at [[Goodspeed Musicals]] in 2003.
 
== Plot ==
The show's opening scene is in 1913, when Camille was removed from society, then flashes back to 1881 and onward. The plot focuses on Claudel's career and her tempestuous relationship with [[Auguste Rodin]], for whom she was a source of inspiration, a model, a confidante, and a lover. The show opens with Camille's love for her true passion - sculpting ("In the Stone"). The musical features Camille's sometimes troubling relationship with both her father (who had actually helped her) and brother, [[Paul Claudel]]. Despite not being a male, she insists she be allowed to be enrolled at Le Salon ("Not a Man"), yet she still manages to work and learn under Rodin. Act 1 concludes with Camille deciding she no longer needs Rodin, and attempts to live and create on her own, only to have Rodin tell her that she would be nothing without him ("Taking Back My Life"). 

Act II opens with Rodin reflecting on what he has done, and ailing with amiss for Camille ("A Trembling Man"). Camille now spends a lot of time with her father, and the two discuss older times and are at harmony ("Snow Falls"). When Paul realizes Camille's downward spiral into the unknown and her relations with Rodin, he attempts to save her and turn her to God, such as he had had his own conversion ("Field of Angels"). Instead, Camille cannot seem to understand why no one believes in her - including her family ("What's Never Been Done Before"). Rodin eventually rekindles his love with Camille, but the love is never returned ("Learning How to Love You"). After several more years, Camille's family decides that she is no longer stable (both emotionally &amp; financially); they announce that her father has passed days earlier, and she is devastated that they did not tell her. Although she fights with Paul that she is not meant to be there, Paul and her mother send her to an insane asylum, where she comes to peace with the news of her father ("Snow Falls (Reprise)"). At the end of Act II, which switches to modern times, where Camille, now alone, reflects on the life she has lived ("Gold").

== Productions ==
The world premiere was staged by [[Goodspeed Musicals]] in August through September 2003, in a "developmental run". Directed by Gabriel Barre and choreographed by Mark Dendy, the cast featured [[Linda Eder]] in the title role, [[Michael Nouri]] as [[Auguste Rodin]], Matt Bogart as Paul Claudel and [[Milo O'Shea]] as Camille's father.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/81510-Wildhorn-and-Knightons-Camille-Claudel-the-Musical-Ends-Sept-7-at-Goodspeed "Wildhorn and Knighton's 'Camille Claudel', the Musical, Ends Sept. 7 at Goodspeed"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013144636/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/81510-Wildhorn-and-Knightons-Camille-Claudel-the-Musical-Ends-Sept-7-at-Goodspeed# |date=2012-10-13 }} playbill.com,  September 7, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical was presented in a "chamber-style" form; the cast was minimum, and they attempted to do the most they could with small scale sets. Orchestrations (by Kim Scharnberg) were also on a smaller scale. Instead of bringing in statues, they used dancers to perform, and many of the scenes were strictly dancing for the statues (sometimes accompanied by music). ''The Waltz'' was one of these. There were also many book-scenes/moments, more than a common Wildhorn musical. The creators have denounced calling this a "tragedy," but rather a celebration of the life of Camille.

In 2004 it was presented in the form of a 45-minute reading at The National Alliance for Musical Theatre's 16th Annual Festival of New Musicals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://namt.org/event%20archives/festival-history-2004.aspx "16th Annual Festival of New Musicals, 2004"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501085710/http://www.namt.org/event%20archives/festival-history-2004.aspx# |date=2012-05-01 }} namt.org, accessed March 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A studio demo recording was made in 2004, with no plans for a release. That demo also included songs recorded in 2001 with Linda Eder as Camille and Guy LeMonnier as Rodin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanknighton.com/projects/camille/recordings_demo.shtml "Recordings-Camille Claudel Demo Tracks"] nanknighton.com, accessed March 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical has been consistently worked upon, with productions that were hoped for Europe and regional theatres across the United States. However, in 2007, author Nan Knighton has said that while there are certain opportunities still available, there were no immediate plans to bring ''Camille'' anywhere.

The musical opened in Tokyo in December 2011, titled '''''GOLD - Rodin and Camille'''''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanknighton.com/ " 'Camille Claudel' Premiered in Japan"] nanknighton.com, accessed March 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recordings ==
No cast recording have been released. In 2004, a studio demo recording was made, starring Linda Eder and the majority of the world premiere cast. While it was originally thought that the recording would be released (nearly all of Wildhorn's musicals have released a concept album prior to a major production), this did not happen.

The musical features the Linda Eder single "Gold," which was included on two of her solo albums: ''Gold'' and ''Broadway, My Way''. The song was performed at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]], UT, and was covered by [[Brandi Burkhardt]] at several European concerts with Frank Wildhorn.

==Stabbing==
Due to [[firearm ownership law in China|strict gun control laws in China]], knives are usually the weapon of choice in violent crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/world/worldnow/la-man-slashes-22-children-near-china-school-20121214,0,6383015.story | title = Man slashes 22 children near China school | author = John Hannon | date = 14 December 2012 | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The attack on the children occurred at the entrance of the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://presstv.com/detail/2012/12/15/278109/22-schoolchildren-stabbed-in-china/|title=Mentally challenged man stabs 22 schoolchildren in China|work=Press TV|date=14 December 2012|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Min first targeted the elderly woman, aged 85, who lived next to the school. He went to her house at around 7 a.m., stole one of her knives and attacked her head. The woman's daughter said an argument had occurred.&lt;ref name=xinhua/&gt; At around 7:40&amp;nbsp;a.m., Min pursued the children with the knife he had stolen from the elderly woman's house and slashed them, many on their heads.&lt;ref name=xinhua&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-12/14/c_132041711.htm|title=22 students stabbed in central China attack|agency=Xinhua News Agency|date=14 December 2012|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Xinhua'' reported that some of the children had had fingers or ears cut off in the knife attack.&lt;ref name="China-calls"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/15/china-calls-for-no-delay-on-gun-controls-in-u-s/ | title = China Calls for ‘No Delay’ on Gun Controls in U.S. | author = Mark Mcdonald | date = 15 December 2012 | work = [[International Herald Tribune]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Min was restrained at the primary school, and transferred to police custody.&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt; The victims were treated at three hospitals.&lt;ref name=xinhua/&gt; Two of the children were  taken to hospitals located outside [[Guangshan County]]  to receive better care.&lt;ref name="Henan injures"&gt;{{cite news

==Perpetrator==
The suspect was initially identified to be Min Yingjun ({{zh|s=闵应军 |t=閔應軍 |p=Mǐn Yìngjūn}}); however, later reports identified the perpetrator to be a different man, Min Yongjun ({{zh|s=闵拥军 |t=閔擁軍 |p=Mǐn Yōngjūn |links=no}}), of the same village as Min Yingjun.&lt;ref name="jrj"&gt;[http://money.jrj.com.cn/2012/12/17093614829777.shtml 闵应军：河南22名学生被砍 凶犯闵应军实为"闵拥军" ]&lt;/ref&gt; He is reported to have had a long history of [[epileptic seizures]],&lt;ref name="jrj"/&gt; and to have been influenced by the [[2012 phenomenon|2012 doomsday phenomenon]]. This has recently been propagated in China by the [[Oriental Lightning]] cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/17/us-china-doomsday-idUSBRE8BG0ES20121217|title=China detains 93 for doomsday rumors: Xinhua|first=Sui-Lee|last=Wee|editor1-first=Robert|editor1-last=Birsel|agency=Reuters|date=2012-12-17|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
The [[Guangshan County]] government established an emergency response team for the incident.&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt;  The coverage of the incident in local media was tightly controlled, with Beijing usually restricting coverage of such sensitive topics to dissuade copycat attacks,&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt; and an article in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported a backlash by Chinese citizens due to the lack of coverage of the school stabbings.&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt; An article in [[The Associated Press]] similarly wrote that a possible reason why authorities wanted to restrict the news was to either "prevent encouraging others or to play down the crime to keep blame off the government."&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;

Officials detained 52 people for spreading doomsday rumours, such as distributing leaflets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.shanghaidaily.com/article/?id=519288&amp;type=National | title = School hacker obsessed with doomsday | date = 17 December 2012 | author = Li Qian | publisher = [[Shanghai Daily]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December, the suspect was arrested and charged with the crime of endangering public safety by dangerous means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpd.com.cn/n10216060/n10216148/c15116724/content.html 河南光山砍伤学生嫌疑人闵拥军被批准逮捕], cpd.com.cn&lt;/ref&gt;

Six officials were fired. The reason for the dismissals have not been announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20121218/as-china-school-stabbing/ | title = 6 Chinese officials fired after school stabbing | agency = Associated Press | publisher = The Huffington Post | date = 18 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Some commentaries situated the knife attacks in the wider context of China's social and economic transformation, noting the inadequacies in the country’s health care system for diagnosing and treating citizens suffering psychiatric distress and illnesses.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last= Liu| first= Melinda| title=Not Just Sandy Hook: China’s Terrifying Knife Attacks| url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/15/not-just-sandy-hook-china-s-terrifying-knife-attacks.html| newspaper=The Daily Beast| date=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Chenpeng school attack was followed by the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] in the United States hours later&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.china-xian.com/sh/fzsh/201212/1534635.htm |script-title=zh:闵拥军砍伤22名学生 中国36岁男子闵拥军落网 - 名城西安 |publisher=China-xian.com |date=15 December 2012 |accessdate=15 December 2012 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://americanlivewire.com/22-students-in-china-stabbed-in-elementary-school-attack-by-36-year-old-villager-min-yingjun/ |title=22 Students In China Stabbed In Elementary School Attack by 36-year-old Villager Min Yongjun |publisher=American Live Wire |accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; comparisons were drawn between the two. The difference in gun control laws between the two countries was used to explain the disparity in casualties of the school attacks by journalists and politicians, including U.S. Representative [[Jerrold Nadler|Jerry Nadler]],&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/evanosnos/2012/12/china-watches-newtown-guns-american-credibility.html | title = China Watches Newtown: Guns and American Credibility | author = Evan Osnos |authorlink = Evan Osnos| magazine = [[The New Yorker]] | date = 15 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/15/gun-control-jerry-nadler_n_2307340.html | first= Michael |last= McAuliff | title = On Gun Control, Jerry Nadler Explains What Congress Could Do Right Now | date = 15 December 2012 | work = [[The Huffington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an article in the [[Associated Press]] noted that despite the different outcomes, an underlying commonality between the attacks was the increased frequency of school attacks because, "attackers often seek out the vulnerable, hoping to amplify their outrage before they themselves often commit suicide."&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5izvHNVyzzEe08iLX7PD_jXND3pvQ?docId=031a85c4f4064ac59a3d2575d09e4bfe |title=Schools and students are targets worldwide |first= Charles |last= Hutzler |agency=Associated Press |date=15 December 2012 |accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparisons were also drawn between the incident handling by the local and national governments involved. The lack of coverage by Chinese state-run news channels, and the lack of any emotional response from the Chinese government at all levels were contrasted to the detailed US media coverage and US President [[Barack Obama]]'s national speech, including his commitment to tackle the underlying issues.&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://ibnlive.in.com/news/china-highlights-contrasting-gun-law/310895-70.html | title = China highlights contrasting gun law | author = Jamil Anderlini | agency = [[Financial Times]] | publisher = [[CNN-IBN]] | date = 16 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2248054/China-stabbing-22-children-elderly-woman-stabbed-outside-primary-school-Chinese-knifeman.html | title = 22 children and elderly woman stabbed outside primary school by Chinese knifeman | work= [[Daily Mail]] | first= Phil |last= Vinter | date = 14 December 2012 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.morningwhistle.com/html/2012/PoliticsSociety_1217/216109.html | date=17 December 2012 | author= Xu Weiwei | title= Knife attack on school injures 23 kids in China | work=Morning Whistle | accessdate= 18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Footage==
The local police released footage from a security camera showing the attacker barging into the school and attacking a student. The video was noted and analysed by many news agencies, and contributed significantly to the widespread coverage of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese Police Release Video of School Stabbing|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/chinese-police-release-video-school-stabbing-18013111#.UNNAyW_AdNM|accessdate=20 December 2012|newspaper=AP|date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WATCH: Shocking video of stabbing spree at Chinese school|url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/WOR-TOP-watch-shocking-video-of-stabbing-spree-at-chinese-school-4119067-NOR.html|accessdate=20 December 2012|newspaper=Daily Bhaskar|date=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifteenth iteration of the conference was held in Seattle.  The theme of this conference was [[equiveillance]], the balance between [[surveillance]] and [[sousveillance]].  The equiveillance theme was reflected in the Opening Keynote Address, a panel discussion on equiveillance, and a pre-keynote sousveillance workshop, as well as a sousveillance performance.&lt;ref&gt;http://wearcam.org/cfp2005/&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with this theme, every conference attendee received a sousveillance system consisting of a "maybecamera" attached to each conference bag.  Some of the 500 conference bags contained cameras transmitting live 24/7 video whereas others contained no camera, but merely the familiar camera dome.  A third category of conference bag included some with a subtle but visible flashing red light behind the dome.  Not all of the wireless web cameras had flashing red lights, and some of the flashing red lights were dummy devices that did not transmit video.  The bags that did transmit video also updated various video displays around the conference hall, visible to conference attendees.

The twenty-first annual CFP Conference in 2011, "Computers, Freedom, and Privacy: The Future is Now", was held at the Georgetown Law Center in Washington, DC June 14–16. Among the questions and issues explored were: What is social media’s role in the charged democracy movement in the Middle East and North Africa; How can technology and social media support human rights, What is the impact of mobile personal computing technology on freedom and privacy? Are the courts, policy and decision makers ready to address freedom and privacy in a 24-7 connected world? Are our leaders techs savvy enough to make good legal and policy decisions regarding the deployment of [[smart grid]], e-health records, the spread of consumer location based advertising? Cybersecurity, cloud computing, net neutrality, federated ID, ubiquitous surveillance: Are they passing fads or here to stay? &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfp.org/2011/wiki/index.php/Main_Page&lt;/ref&gt;

His fixation with trains has led McCollum to frequently impersonate MTA employees or a related entity, for which he has been jailed numerous times. McCollum has been rejected for employment by MTA on numerous occasions, although he is reported to know more about the trains, schedules, procedures and rail operations than any current employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Orphan Diseases: New Hope for Rare Medical Conditions |author=Murphy, Wendy B |year=2002 |publisher=Twenty-First Century Books |isbn=0-7613-1919-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable arrests==

According to McCollum's mother, his interest with the [[New York City Subway]] system started in his youth, when subway motormen permitted him to drive trains.&lt;ref name="Donohue Moore 2013"/&gt; McCollum was first arrested in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Top 10 Imposters | website=TIME.com | date=2009-05-26 | url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1900621_1900618_1900590,00.html | accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; at age 15, when he drove an in-service New York City Subway [[E (New York City Subway service)|E train]] for six stops.&lt;ref name="Donohue Moore 2013"&gt;{{cite web | last=Donohue | first=Pete | last2=Moore | first2=Tina | title=Transit bus thief released from prison after 2010 swipe | website=NY Daily News | date=2013-12-25 | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/transit-thief-released-prison-lock-trains-buses-article-1.1557950 | accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was in jail at [[Rikers Island]], he wrote to the [[New York City Department of Correction]] and asked if he could drive one of their buses.&lt;ref name="Donohue Moore 2013"/&gt; By the mid-1990s, McCollum "had become a minor cult figure", particularly after the MTA posted thousands of [[wanted poster]]s in trains and stations so that riders could report sightings. Occasionally, McCollum would appear as transit employees named "Morning" or "Manning", who riders invariably experienced as friendly and helpful.&lt;ref name="Osborne"&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome|author=Osborne, Lawrence|first=|publisher=Copernicus|year=2002|isbn=0-387-95307-8|location=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000, McCollum had been jailed 19 times for transit-related crimes. That year he pleaded guilty to charges of forgery and burglary for signing out a train according to proper MTA procedure to perform customary duties (extinguishing track fires, supervising maintenance), and then signing it back in. He was sentenced to a minimum of {{frac|2|1|2}} to 5 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/30/nyregion/judge-clearly-not-amused-sentences-a-subway-impostor.html |title=Judge, Clearly Not Amused, Sentences... |date=March 31, 2001 |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-08-01 |first=Dean E. |last=Murphy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, McCollum was apprehended at a [[Long Island Rail Road]] yard with the keys to an [[M-7 (railcar)|M-7 railcar]] in his pocket. They had been given to him by his MTA friends who had given him their shifts, but he pleaded guilty to attempting to steal a locomotive and was sentenced to three years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queensda.org/Press%20Releases/2005%20Press%20Releases/04-April/04-06-2005.htm |title=Darius McCollum sentencing release |date=April 6, 2005 |publisher=[[Queens]] District Attorney's Office |accessdate=2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was released from [[Sing Sing]] in 2006, he was reimprisoned for breaking parole after he was found in possession of railroad property.&lt;ref name="Landry, Bernice"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/media/2008/dark-end-of-the-spectrum-episode-2.ram |title=CBC Ideas: The Dark End of The Spectrum, Part II |author=Landry, Bernice |date=July 31, 2009 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 2008, McCollum, now 43, was arrested again. He was wearing a hardhat and carrying a knapsack, flashlight and gloves with an MTA logo. He was dressed in the blue T-shirt and work pants typically worn by track workers and was arrested as he tried to enter a restricted area of a midtown station.&lt;ref name=nyd20080614/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt20080614/&gt; McCollum was charged with criminal impersonation, criminal trespass and possession of burglary tools—a hammer and screwdriver tucked in his backpack.

McCollum was released from the [[Downstate Correctional Facility]] on July 3, 2007—nine months after his arrest for violating parole by returning to the city from [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=nyd20080614/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt20080614/&gt; He was arrested at [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] on October 5, 2008, for impersonating a [[Long Island Rail Road]] employee and answering passengers' questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/10/06/2008-10-06_railroad_buff_derailed_again_26th_bust_f.html |title=Railroad buff derailed again, 26th bust for man cops say impersonated fed |author=Donohue, Pete |work=New York Daily News |date=October 6, 2008 |accessdate=October 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 31, 2010, McCollum was arrested for the 27th time and charged with grand larceny and possession of stolen property in connection with the theft of a private bus from a [[Trailways of New York]] terminal in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]&lt;ref name=nyp20100831&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/subway_car_stealer_busted_for_stealing_cz8BCyoV04Ai8fdnMfyF5L |title=Transit bandit busted for stealing bus, cuffed carrying Koran |author=Cartwright, Lachlan |work=New York Post |date=August 31, 2010 |accessdate=September 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905005607/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/subway_car_stealer_busted_for_stealing_cz8BCyoV04Ai8fdnMfyF5L |archivedate=September 5, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to police, McCollum allegedly boarded the bus at approximately 6:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. that morning and discovered the keys left in the ignition. McCollum is accused of then commandeering the bus, with the theft reportedly going unnoticed for two hours as McCollum drove around [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] and [[Jamaica, Queens]]. McCollum was taken into custody without incident. Police stated McCollum is "very smart, he's not a dumb guy" and that he was a "gentleman" during arrest and processing.&lt;ref name=nyp20100831/&gt;&lt;ref name=g20100831/&gt; At the time of his arrest, he had spent 18 years—more than a third of his life—in jail for transit-related offenses.&lt;ref name=g20100831&gt;{{cite web |author=Ben Yakas |url=http://gothamist.com/2010/08/31/1_subway_superfan_darius_mccollum_a.php |title=#1 Subway Superfan Darius McCollum Arrested For Stealing Bus |publisher=Gothamist |date=2010-08-31 |accessdate=2013-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231030014/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/31/1_subway_superfan_darius_mccollum_a.php |archivedate=2013-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Donohue Moore 2013"/&gt; In 2013, McCollum pleaded guilty to stealing the Trailways bus. On December 24 of that year, McCollum was released on [[parole]] and was to voluntarily enter [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/nyc-transit-impostor-released-jail-21334798|title=U.S. News - National News|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms of the parole, which lasted until August 24, 2015, required that he does not operate a motor vehicle.&lt;ref name="Donohue Moore 2013"/&gt;

On November 11, 2015, McCollum was arrested for stealing a Greyhound bus from the [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]] in [[Manhattan]]. He drove the [[GPS]]-equipped bus for approximately 2 hours until his arrest at approximately  4&amp;nbsp;p.m. in [[Gowanus, Brooklyn]]. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', McCollum said, “I’m stealing a plane next” after his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rojas |first1=Rick |title=Repeat Train Thief Steals Bus at Port Authority, Police Say |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/nyregion/repeat-train-thief-steals-bus-at-port-authority-police-say.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0 |accessdate=12 November 2015 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times |date=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his parents, who moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, believe McCollum should leave New York to avoid the temptation of the trains,&lt;ref name="Haberman"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/nyregion/12nyc.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |title=Back in Prison, Guilty Mainly of a Fixation |author=Haberman, Clyde |date=April 12, 2005 |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; parole conditions have until recently repeatedly restricted McCollum to remain in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/article382503.ece |title=On the wrong track |author=Knight, Sam |date=April 18, 2005 |publisher=The Times |accessdate=2007-11-07 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggestions from his parents and [[autism]] advocates that the MTA find a way to hire McCollum in some capacity, in the manner of [[Frank Abagnale]], are rejected by transit officials, who fear legal liability and anti-disability stigma.&lt;ref name="Haberman"/&gt; In January 2018, McCollum took a [[plea bargain]] in which he agreed to go to a [[Psychiatric hospital|psychiatric institution]] for an "indefinite" period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2018/01/08/transit-bandit-agrees-to-plea-deal-will-head-to-psych-ward/|title=Transit bandit agrees to plea deal, will head to psych ward|date=2018-01-08|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-01-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

After McCollum used an [[insanity defense]] based on Asperger’s, he became a [[folk hero]] to people with [[autism spectrum disorder]], especially children, celebrated for his “rebellion against what autistics often call the dreary world of the '[[neurotypical]]s'”. In spite of his diagnosis from several psychiatrists, during at least two criminal proceedings, this defense was denied as the judge ruled he was “capable of controlling his impulses”.&lt;ref name="Osborne"/&gt;

A ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper’s Magazine]]'' article on McCollum by Jeff Tietz was a finalist in profile writing for the 2003 [[American Society of Magazine Editors]] awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter=The Boy Who Loved Transit |title=The Best American Magazine Writing 2003 |editor=[[American Society of Magazine Editors]] |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |year=2003 |isbn=0-06-056775-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2003 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe]], Paperhat Productions of New York mounted a play by Director [[Jude Domski]] called ''Boy Steals Train'', based on McCollum’s life and letters McCollum wrote to Domski, and described as “pointing a shaming collective finger at a judiciary that refuses to recognize Darius's condition”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/otherresources/fringe/fringe03-10.htm  "Reviews from the 2003 Edinburgh Fringe"],&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/08/19/btdef19.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2003/08/19/ixartleft.html |title=Edinburgh reports:  American dreamers |author=Cavendish, Dominic |date=August 19, 2003 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2007-11-06 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was awarded a Fringe First by ''[[The Scotsman]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburghfestivals.co.uk/reviews.cfm?id=858032003&amp;sid=2508 |title=Winners in the limelight |publisher=Edinburgh Festivals |work=The Scotsman |author=Eaton, Andrew |date=8 August 2003 |accessdate=2007-11-08 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the troupe won a Best Ensemble Acting Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sffringe.org/media/edinburgh.html |title=Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2003, Bravehearts Only |author=Weinert, Laura |publisher=BackStageWest |date=August 2003 |accessdate=2007-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325185737/http://www.sffringe.org/media/edinburgh.html |archivedate=2008-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His story was also made into a BBC radio play, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20050814/ai_n14884010 |title="RADIO CHOICE: Afternoon Play: Boy Steals Train Monday, 2.15pm BBC", '&amp;#39;Independent on Sunday'&amp;#39; (London), August 14, 2005 |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCollum appears in Episode 2 of “The Dark End of The Spectrum,” a two-hour, two-part, radio documentary that aired on [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]’s radio show ''[[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]]'' on June 2, 2008 and again on July 24 (Part 1) and July 31 (Part 2), 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/features/dark-end-spectrum/index.html |title=The Dark End of The Spectrum |publisher=[[CBC Radio One]] |accessdate=12 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127083730/http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/features/dark-end-spectrum/index.html |archivedate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Denis Avey''' (11 January 1919 – 16 July 2015) was a British veteran of the Second World War who was held as a prisoner of war at [[Auschwitz]]. Whilst there, he saved the life of Jewish prisoner Ernst Lobethal, by smuggling cigarettes to him.&lt;ref name="Ariel"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ex-bbc.net/Ariel/Arielwk11.2010.pdf |title=How a BBC investigation found genuine ‘Hero of the Holocaust’ |first=Rob |last=Broomby |journal=[[Ariel (newspaper)|Ariel]] |page=5 |date=16 March 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For that he was made a [[British Hero of the Holocaust]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/130682/response/323026/attach/html/3/121019%20FoI%20F0006216%20Peter%20Nockolds.doc.html |title=Qualification of Award of British Hero of the Holocaust Award 2010 |first=Keith |last=Harrison |work=whatdotheyknow.com |date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also said that he exchanged uniforms with a Jewish prisoner and smuggled himself into Auschwitz to witness the treatment of Jewish inmates, whose camp was separate from but adjoined that of British POWs. His claim has been challenged.&lt;ref name="newstatesman"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/guy-walters/2011/11/avey-book-holocaust-auschwitz |title=The curious case of the 'break into Auschwitz' |first=Guy |last=Walters |journal=[[New Statesman]] |date=17 November 2011 |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Witness to Auschwitz"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/qb5jd/witness-to-auschwitz |title=Witness to Auschwitz |first=Alison |last=Graham |work=[[Radio Times]] |year=2014 |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His memoir ''[[The Man who Broke into Auschwitz]]'', written with Rob Broomby, was published in 2011.

==Life (until retirement)==
Avey was born in [[Essex]], outside London, in 1919. As a boy, he learned boxing, was head boy at school and studied at Leyton technical college. He joined the army in 1939 at the age of 20, and fought in the desert campaigns of North Africa in the 7th Armoured Division, known as the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|"Desert Rats"]]. He was captured by the Germans while attacking [[Rommel]]'s forces near [[Tobruk]], [[Libya]], and saw his best friend killed next to him.&lt;ref name=Broomby2/&gt; He claims to have escaped to Greece by crossing the Mediterranean Sea floating on top of a packing crate, but was recaptured after landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-306-81965-0 |title=Nonfiction Book Review: The Man Who Broke into Auschwitz: A True Story of World War II by Denis Avey with Rob Broomby |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=1 June 2014 |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being retaken prisoner, he was placed in the E715 prison camp for British soldiers, next door to the [[Auschwitz]] concentration camp where Jews were imprisoned. He was there from 1943 until January 1945. While there he befriended a Jewish inmate of Auschwitz, Ernst Lobethal, from the adjoining Jewish section. He obtained cigarettes from Ernst's sister, who had escaped from Germany to Britain on a [[Kindertransport]] before the war. He secretly passed the cigarettes to Ernst who would use them as currency to help him survive.

{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote=With that simple exchange between the two of us I had given away the protection of the Geneva Convention: I'd given my uniform, my lifeline, my best chance of surviving that dreadful place, to another man ... If I was caught, the guards would have shot me out of hand as an imposter. No question at all.|source=Denis Avey&lt;ref&gt;Avey, Denis. ''The Man Who Broke into Auschwitz'', Hodder &amp; Stoughton, U.K. (2011) pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Avey also says that he twice exchanged uniforms with a Jewish inmate to smuggle himself into the inmate's camp in order to witness for himself the actual treatment of Jews, which he could see was completely different from the treatment of British POWs. While  British POWs were forced to work six days a week, they could use their free time to play football and basketball.&lt;ref name=JC/&gt; And while their conditions were dreadful, according to one British inmate, "they were as nothing compared to what the Jews next door went through."&lt;ref name=JC/&gt; Avey agreed, and describes the plight of the Jews:

{{quote|I am telling you I know without exaggeration, nearly 200,000 prisoners in Auschwitz were worked to death. Not killed. Were worked to death and they claimed total innocence. They lived for no more than 4 months. They were clubbed and beaten every day without any justification whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordchabad.org/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/1115143/jewish/PoW-Denis-Avey.htm Lecture by Denis Avey], Oxford Chabad Society&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Avey explained to ''The Daily Telegraph'' during an interview that he was the type that needed to see things for himself:

{{quote|My mates didn’t want me to do it but they agreed because they realised I was going to do it, and that was that. I had watched people being murdered literally every day and I knew someone would have to answer for it. I wanted to get in and identify the people responsible.&lt;ref name=Dolan/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11828297/Denis-Avey-Auschwitz-witness-obituary.html "Denis Avey, Auschwitz witness - obituary"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 27 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He was aware that he was taking "a hell of a chance," and states: "When you think about it in today's environment it is ludicrous, absolutely ludicrous.

Avey escaped during the "[[death marches (Holocaust)|death marches]]" in April 1945 which followed the Nazis' evacuation of Auschwitz. Although suffering from [[tuberculosis]] caught in the camp, Avey broke away undetected, then made his way through [[Silesia]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=Broomby2&gt;Avey, Denis and Broomby, Rob.[https://docs-books.com/2014/06/30/the-man-who-broke-into-auschwitz-by-denis-avey-with-rob-broomby/comment-page-1/ "THE MAN WHO BROKE INTO AUSCHWITZ by Denis Avey with Rob Broomby"], June 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IWM"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dolan/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; During the march Avey saw an estimated 15,000 dead prisoners, recalling that "the road was littered with corpses."&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; He eventually ran into Americans who helped get him back to England, and to his family who assumed he had died.&lt;ref name=MGI/&gt;

After he returned to England, Avey spent the next year and a half hospitalized with tuberculosis.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; Afterwards, when he tried to report what he saw in Auschwitz, he encountered resistance and indifference.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; From then on, he chose to not to speak of it again to anyone:

{{quote|In 1947, I went to the military authorities to submit my information about Auschwitz. Their eyes glazed over. I wasn’t taken seriously. I was shocked, especially after the risks I’d taken. I felt completely disillusioned, and traumatised as well. So from then on I bottled it up, and tried to piece my life back together.&lt;ref name=MGI/&gt;}}

British author [[Sir Martin Gilbert]] explains that by 1947, after the [[Nuremberg Trials|war trials]] were finished, "people just wanted to get on with their lives." Average citizens were not interested in discussing the war anymore, nor were they interested in hearing war stories from veterans or former POWs like Avey. "It must have been very painful," says Gilbert.&lt;ref name=MGI/&gt;

{{quote box|align=left|width=25em|quote=Despite the danger, I knew I had to bear witness. As Albert Einstein said: the world can be an evil place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing. I’ve never been one to do nothing.|source= —  Denis Avey&lt;ref name=bookinfo&gt;[http://the-man-who-broke-into-auschwitz.tumblr.com/ Denis Avey story], ''The Man Who Broke into Auschwitz'' information page&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Besides tuberculosis, Avey suffered from  [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]] (PTSD) before it was recognized as a medical illness, an illness few people were aware of.&lt;ref name=Broomby2/&gt; For the following years he battled with nightmares, jumpiness, and an inability to speak about his POW experiences. He suffered from a violent temper, stomach pains, and loss of memory.&lt;ref name=Broomby2/&gt;  From a beating during his incarceration, he also lost vision in one eye which became cancerous and required being replaced with a glass eye.&lt;ref name=Broomby2/&gt; The cause of the beating, Avey said, came when he cursed an [[SS officer]] who was beating a Jew in the camp. The officer took his pistol butt and gave Avey a blow directly on his eye.&lt;ref name=MGI&gt;Simons, Jacob Wallace. [http://mginews.com/content/view/623/2/ "British PoW Who Broke Into Auschwitz — and Survived"], ''The Times'', Feb. 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When war crime prosecutors later sought Avey's testimony for the [[Nuremberg Trials]], they were unable to locate him.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; He kept the traumatic events about his wartime past a complete secret from everyone, including his first and second wives, along with his daughter. "I knew there was something," said his wife, Audrey. "Naturally, you ask questions. But I never got an answer."&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; Avey explains: "The sad irony was that I went in there to find out the truth, so I could tell everybody about the horrors of the Nazi regime. But I was so traumatised at my whole experience of the Auschwitz camps it took me 60 years to be able to recount the horrors I saw."&lt;ref name=Dolan/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news| first=Rob |last=Broomby |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8382457.stm |work=BBC News |title=The man who smuggled himself into Auschwitz |date=29 November 2009 |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He first began disclosing these events when invited to appear on the [[BBC]] to talk about war pensions. His memories began tumbling out, shocking the television hosts who were unable to believe what they were hearing. As a result, the BBC began production of a documentary, discovering the name of the young Jewish prisoner Avey had befriended in Auschwitz, Ernst Lobethal."&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/03/world/la-fg-pow-auschwitz3-2010apr03 "Bearing Witness to Nazi Horror"] ''Los Angeles Times'', April 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked why he risked his life to infiltrate the Jewish sections of the concentration camp, he states that he needed to see for himself "the unspeakable things being done to the Jews at Auschwitz." At the age of 91, he reflects back on this episode:

{{quote|You know the word "conjecture"? It's never been in my vocabulary. I wanted to know exactly what was happening inside there. ... I knew there had to be eventually a reckoning to all this. ... I don't feel like a hero. I'm embarrassed, ... I had certain ideals that I grew up with.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;}}

He had assumed that Ernst had died during the death march, but did track down and meet Ernst's sister, Susanne, who also thought he died.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; She had escaped to England before war broke out in 1939.&lt;ref name=Dolan/&gt;

Years later, Susanne learned that her brother had actually survived, in part thanks to Avey, and had lived in America with his new family until his death.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; While he never got to meet Ernst, he said that his surviving was "bloody marvellous."&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Ernst, like Avey, refused to burden anyone with his own suffering and never talked about Auschwitz until very late in life. But, says Avey, "I, too, have left it late. I will always regret not tracking Ernst down while he was alive. If I’d known he was living in America, I would have gone and found him, without doubt. But I am proud to have played a small part in helping one man through the obscenity of Auschwitz."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-sunday-telegraph/20110320/284124972787090/TextView "Auschwitz Wasn't Inhuman, It Was Bestial"], ''Sunday Telegraph'', March 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Avey married twice and pursued a career in engineering, which culminated in him building a factory near Newcastle. He retired to [[Bradwell, Derbyshire]].

==Recognition==
After retirement he became active amongst ex-POWs seeking compensation for wartime imprisonment&lt;ref&gt;All information from Denis Avey's autobiography ''The Man who Broke into Auschwitz.''&lt;/ref&gt; and began to talk about these experiences.  In 2001 he described these in an interview with the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London, where he stated that he had obtained cigarettes for Ernst and also gave the name of Ernst's sister Susanne. He also stated that he had exchanged uniforms with a bunkmate of Ernst and entered Birkenau in the company of Ernst.&lt;ref name="IWM"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80020527 |title=Denis George Avey interview (22065) |first=Smith |last=Lyn E. |work=Imperial War Museum |date=16 July 2001 |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avey got details about events inside Birkenau which he sent home to his mother and sister in code. His mother sent two letters regarding this to the War Office but never received a reply.&lt;ref name="IWM"/&gt; He was interviewed on BBC [[Radio Derby]] in 2003. In 2005 the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported that Avey claimed to have swapped uniforms with Ernst and entered Birkenau where he witnessed prisoners being sent to the gas chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Brit+who+broke+IN+to+Auschwitz.-a0127524827 |title=Brit who broke IN to Auschwitz |first=Jane |last=Kerr |work=Free Online Library |date=24 January 2005 |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|align=left|width=25em|quote=I knew in my gut that these swine would eventually be held to account. Evidence would be vital. Of course, sneaking into the Jewish camp was a ludicrous idea. It was like breaking into Hell. But that's the sort of chap I was. Reckless.|source= —  Denis Avey&lt;ref name=MGI/&gt;}}

In May 2009 the British Government announced the establishment of the [[British Hero of the Holocaust]] award. That autumn Rob Broomby, a reporter from the [[BBC]], who had known of Avey's story for some years, was able to trace Ernst's sister in [[Birmingham]]. He learned that Ernst had in fact survived the death march and emigrated to the United States where he lived to the age of 77.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Broomby also discovered that before his death, Ernst had recorded a video testimony of his experiences in Auschwitz, in which he mentions the British soldier whom he knew as "Ginger" who obtained cigarettes. This "Ginger" was Avey. [[BBC Television]] subsequently broadcast a documentary which included an emotional reunion between Avey and Susanne, where Avey sees Ernst's video testimony for the first time and realises that his cigarettes saved his life.&lt;ref name="Ariel"/&gt;

Although Lobethal – now Lobet – made no mention on the video of having swapped uniforms with Avey, the documentary did include Avey's account of an exchange with an unnamed prisoner. An article by Broomby published at the time of the first broadcast suggested that he and the BBC had accepted the "break-in" story as also confirmed.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Denis Avey was then received by British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] to mark [[International Holocaust Remembrance Day]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/26395/brown-signs-holocaust-memorial-book |title=Brown signs Holocaust memorial book |first=Robyn |last=Rosen |work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] |date=22 January 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 he was named a British Hero of the Holocaust by the British Government&lt;ref name=Telegraph9Mar2010&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/britainatwar/7402443/Britons-honoured-for-holocaust-heroism.html |title=Britons honoured for holocaust heroism |publisher=The Telegraph |date=9 March 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5o6rljVNN?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/britainatwar/7402443/Britons-honoured-for-holocaust-heroism.html |archivedate=9 March 2010 |location=London |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; for having saved Ernst's life.

The following week Avey signed a book contract with [[Hodder and Stoughton]] to write his story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.janeturnbull.co.uk/news/news.php?title=denis-avey%26%23039%3Bs-story-pre-empted-by-hodder&amp;entry_id=1268819845 |title=Denis Avey's story pre-empted by Hodder |first=Jane |last=Turnbull |work=janeturnbull.co.uk |date=17 March 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book appeared in April 2011 with a foreword by Sir [[Martin Gilbert]]. The book, ''[[The Man who Broke into Auschwitz]]'', went on to be a best-seller and has been translated into a number of languages.

==Reactions by others==

Before publication of his book, reaction from the mainstream media to his story was favourable. Subsequently, [[Guy Walters]], writing in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', doubted that Avey broke into Auschwitz as he claimed.&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1375018/Denis-Avey-broke-Auschwitz-expose-Holocaust-account-insult.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Guy | last=Walters | title=Did this British PoW really smuggle himself into Auschwitz to expose the Holocaust... or is his account pure fantasy and an insult to millions who died there? | date=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walters pointed out how hard it would have been to do without being caught, the absence of witness confirmation, and the length of Avey's silence, when his declared motive for entering the camp had been to report about his findings after the war.

Brian Bishop, a British POW interviewed by Walters, while he did not claim to know Avey, stated "I can’t understand how he did it. To do something like that you need to have several people helping on both sides — our side and the Jewish side."&lt;ref name="dailymail"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.auschwitz.org/m/index.php?option=com_contact&amp;task=view&amp;contact_id=11&amp;Itemid=4 |title=Auschwitz-Birkenau - Contact |work=Państwowe Muzeum Auschwitz-Birkenau w Oświęcimiu |year=2014 |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar doubt about the feat was expressed by Ron Jones, another British POW, who also found it hard to believe that Avey, a tall, fit, strong Englishman, could have passed himself off alongside "starving six-stone Jews."&lt;ref name=JC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejc.com/arts/books/114937/kicking-out-falsehoods |title=Kicking out falsehoods |first=Robert |last=Low |newspaper=Jewish Chronicle |date=20 January 2014 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, British historian Lyn Smith, who interviewed Avey for the [[Imperial War Museum]] in 2001,&lt;ref name="IWM"/&gt; insisted that he was an "utterly reliable witness," and defended Avey in the face of these doubts, saying "It's pitiful what happened to him." She included Avey in her book ''Heroes of the Holocaust''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/58419/holocaust-historian-defends-man-who-broke-auschwitz |title=Holocaust historian defends man who broke into Auschwitz |first=Simon |last=Round |work=The Jewish Chronicle |date=17 November 2011 |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avey's publisher accepted that in his interview with Smith, Avey's recollections could be confused, but this was understandable given the stress suffered and that he was only then beginning to unburden himself after so many decades of silence.

[[Yad Vashem]] considered Avey for the honour [[Righteous among the Nations]], but said it was unable to grant the award because it was unable to substantiate his account of the prisoner swap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/26/arts-auschwitz-book-idUSLDE73P12520110426 | work=Reuters | title=Veteran defends disputed story of Auschwitz heroics | date=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hodder.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hodder.co.uk/Assets/WorkAssets/ReadingGuides/NOTES%20ON%20SOURCES%20final%20PDF%20for%20thirteenth%20reprint%20of%20Auschwitz.pdf |title=Full text of updated Notes section to Avey's book |work=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |year=2014 |accessdate=20 September 2014 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014 Avey was reported as too ill to respond to further enquiries.  He died on 16 July 2015 at Newholme Hospital in Bakewell, Derbyshire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article4506621.ece Denis Avey]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edenfest''' was 3-day concert that took place July 12–14, 1996 at [[Mosport Park]], in [[Bowmanville]], Ontario, Canada.

The concert sold over 70,000 tickets total for the 3 day event and was attended by another estimated 20,000 people who walked into the concert site after the outside security broke down. This festival that included music as well as multiple other types of performers was held by Eden Entertainment Group based in Buffalo, New York. The concert was one of the first major concerts to be streamed live over the internet. This event was the largest rock festival held in Canada to date. Artists that performed include [[The Tragically Hip]], [[The Cure]], [[Porno for Pyros]], [[Bush (band)|Bush]], [[Live (band)|Live]], [[the Goo Goo Dolls]], [[Ani DiFranco]] and over 50 other performers. The event was considered a creative success; however, the promoter of the event, Mark Drost, was plagued with financial problems due to several forces beyond his control, including the security breakdown. Edenfest was scheduled to go on for 10 consecutive years at the Mosport site; the promoter was unfortunately bankrupted by the event, and thus, it did not continue past 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gerichter |first=Daniel |date=January 15, 2015 |title=Remembering Eden Fest's 1996 meltdown|url=http://www.aux.tv/2015/01/remembering-1996s-eden-musicfest-meltdown/ |newspaper=AUX Music Network|location=Toronto |publisher=Blue Ant Media |accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/507915/eden-fest-is-a-gas-gas-gas-gravity-kills-a-knock-out/|title=Eden Fest Is A Gas Gas Gas; Gravity Kills A Knock-Out!|publisher=MTV News|date=July 14, 1996|accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/507922/eden-fest-attracts-50000-plus-fans/|title=Eden Fest Attracts 50,000-Plus Fans|publisher=MTV News|date=July 15, 1996|accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=July 14, 1996|title=Edenfest Hip Happening; Second Day of Three-Day Music Festival Closes with Tragically Hip|newspaper=The Toronto Sun|location=Toronto|publisher=Sun Media|url=http://janesaddiction.org/tour/show/janes-addiction/1996-07-13/499/|accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Grant |first=Keran |date=July 13, 1996 |title=It's a rock 'n' roll paradise |newspaper=The Toronto Sun |location=Toronto |publisher=Sun Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Balzan |first=Chelsea |date=July 17, 1996 |title=No surprise disappoints many|url=http://images.ourontario.ca/Partners/Whitby/002452204p12.pdf |newspaper=Whitby Free Press |location=Whitby |publisher= |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''elevator game''' is an [[urban legend]] ritual game from [[Japan]] and [[South Korea|Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Abir|title=9 Creepy And Paranormal Games That Are Not For The Faint Hearted|url=http://www.storypick.com/horror-games/|website=Storypick|accessdate=3 February 2017|date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Original rules"&gt;{{cite web|last1=anab7205|title=me리엠의 MAD 블로그 : 네이버 블로그|url=http://blog.naver.comchongll0752/anab7205/1100966790website=Naver|accessdate=4 February 2017|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is purported to allow those who take part in the chance to visit an alternate dimension, or communicate with spirits from another world. One hypothesis
behind the strange behaviors and disappearance of [[Elisa Lam]] was that she was attempting to play the elevator game.&lt;ref name="World of Wonder"&gt;{{cite web |last=St. James |first=James |title=The Elevator Game and the BONE-CHILLING DEATH of Elisa Lam |url=http://worldofwonder.net/disappearance-elisa-lam/ |publisher=[[World of Wonder (production company)|World of Wonder]] |accessdate=January 30, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YpSunvEm?url=http://worldofwonder.net/disappearance-elisa-lam/ |archivedate=May 27, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle ==
Players should locate an elevator in a building with 10 floors, ride it alone and visit different floors in a specific order, with special instructions not to trust, look, or speak, with a lady who enters on the fifth floor joining you on the elevator.&lt;ref name="Hayes 2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thoughtcatalog.com/daniel-hayes/2016/05/602743/|title=If You’re Brave Enough, Here Are The Instructions From An Obscure Korean Elevator ‘Game’ That Might Take You To Another World|last1=Hayes|first1=Daniel|date=20 May 2016|website=Thought Catalog|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative world ===
The only person in the [[otherworld]] is the participant that plays the game. According to the [[ritual]], the building is identical; except that all the lights are out and the only thing the player would see outside is a red cross.

=== Travel back ===
The ritual states that to return to the [[world]] that the player comes from, the player must use the same elevator. However, this may be difficult as you may be confused or the elevator goes farther away the closer you get. The steps must be done in the same sequence up to the fifth floor. Then the final button will return the player to the tenth floor, but the player must press another button in between and the first floor button to go to the first floor. The game rules ask the player to check for small things to be sure they are back in the real world and offer steps to do if the player considers this is not the case.&lt;ref name="Hayes 2016" /&gt;

=== The Fifth Floor Woman ===
At the 5th floor, a mysterious woman may enter the elevator and try to lure the player. According to the rules of the game, the girl must not be talked to or acknowledged in any way. She is a spirit looking to misguide the player into bringing them into a different realm.&lt;ref name="Original rules" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hayes 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://theghostinmymachine.com/2014/06/25/the-most-dangerous-games-elevator-to-another-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

The website's critical consensus reads, "''Escape at Dannemora''{{'}}s slow pace demands patience, but those willing to wait will be rewarded with a chilling mystery that provides the perfect showcase for its talented cast -- especially a nearly unrecognizable and unbearably moving performance from Patricia Arquette."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/escape_at_dannemora/s01|title=Escape at Dannemora (2018) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|accessdate=November 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 78 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/escape-at-dannemora|title=Escape at Dannemora reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=November 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''First Fruits''' festivals of the [[Nguni people]]s in Southern Africa&lt;ref&gt;Snedegar, Keith, [First Fruit Celebrations among the Nguni Peoples of Southern Africa: An Ethnoastromical Interpretation], ''Science History Publications'', 1998. Retrieved 2011/03/18.&lt;/ref&gt; are a type of sacrificial ceremony of giving the first fruits in a harvest to [[God]], or the gods who are believed to be responsible for the abundance of food. It was performed by the high priests of the kingdom and the king was always in attendance. Traditionally it marked a time of prosperity, in the good harvests experienced after the seasonal agricultural period. 

It also brought the nation together, unifying it at a time of merry making and quashing fears of famine.
The tradition is still practiced mainly in the kingdoms of [[KwaZulu-Natal]] and [[Swaziland]]. These ceremonies are headed by the kings of the tribes, namely [[Mswati III|King Mswati the third]] in Swaziland, celebrated as [[Incwala]], and [[Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu|King Goodwill Zwelithini]] of the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] nation, celebrated as [[Umkhosi Wokweshwama]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3274">The '''Katrina PeopleFinder Project''' was set up in early September, 2005 in response to the dozens of groups collecting "lost and safe" lists for people affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Erin | last=Holmes |publisher = [[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)]]|title=Hersey teen helping build victim database | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-136090291.html|date=2005-09-10|accessdate=2007-06-19}} membership required&lt;/ref&gt; It provided  a [[Call centre|virtual messaging center]] using [[skype]] as well as creating "a uniform standard for collecting, compiling, data-entering", and "searching information on people affected by Hurricane Katrina".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://worldchanging.com/archives/003437.html | title=KatrinaWiki, Katrina PeopleFinder: Distributed Technology Responses to Disaster | publisher=World Changing | year=2005 | accessdate=January 28, 2012 | author=Gertz E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was conceived on Friday, September 2 with the establishment of the KatrinaHelp Wiki. Volunteers manually entered 15,200 records in less than 24 hours&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://worldchanging.com/archives/003437.html | title=KatrinaWiki, Katrina PeopleFinder: Distributed Technology Responses to Disaster | publisher=World Changing | year=2005 | accessdate=January 28, 2012 | author=Gertz E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and data entry was stopped with over 90,000 entries (when no new entries were apparent) by Tuesday, September 7. Dozens of technologists and thousands of volunteers had helped make it happen.

The Katrina PeopleFinder Project is an example of a [[nonprofit technology]] initiative implemented entirely by [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s.  Over 4000&amp;nbsp;people donated their time as [[Data entry clerk|data entry]] crew members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Pamela LiCalzi | last=O'Connell | title=Internet Matchmaking: Those Offering Help and Those Needing It| publisher=[[New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/14/giving/14oconnell.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ei=5070&amp;en=3854a0b6d5a88420&amp;ex=1182398400 | date=2005-11-14 | accessdate=2007-06-19}}subscription required&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation ==
As had happened in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], a multitude of sites had been independently gathering lists of survivors or missing-persons requests.  This project set up a system for entering data according to a standard format (PeopleFinder Interchange Format, also known as PFIF), and reached out to the other sites gathering this information to encourage them to use the same database and avoid duplicating effort.

==People Finder Interchange Format==
{{main|People Finder Interchange Format}}
The People Finder Interchange Format (PFIF) is an [[XML]] format used for exchanging information about  individuals found or identified in the aftermath of a disaster.  It was created quickly following the devastation of Hurricane Katrina as part of the Katrina PeopleFinder Project, in September, 2005. PFIF is an example of a [[nonprofit technology]] initiative implemented entirely by volunteers. [[Google Person Finder]] is based on PFIF.

'''Melvin Mouron Belli''' (July 29, 1907&amp;nbsp;– July 9, 1996)&lt;ref name=IMDb&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0068956|section=bio}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a prominent [[United States|American]] lawyer known as "The King of Torts" and by insurance companies as "Melvin Bellicose." He had many celebrity clients, including [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]], [[Errol Flynn]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Jim Bakker]] and [[Tammy Faye Messner|Tammy Faye Bakker]], [[Martha Beall Mitchell|Martha Mitchell]], [[Maureen Connolly]], [[Lana Turner]], [[Tony Curtis]], and [[Mae West]]. He won during his legal career over $600 million in damages for his clients.&lt;ref name=IMDb /&gt; He was also the attorney for [[Jack Ruby]], who shot [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] for the assassination of President [[John F. Kennedy]].

==Early life==
Belli was born in the [[California Gold Rush]] town of [[Sonora, California]], in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada foothills]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; His parents were of Italian ancestry from Switzerland.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}} His grandmother, Anna Mouron, was the first female pharmacist in California. By the 1920s, the family had moved to the city of [[Stockton, California]] where Belli attended Stockton High School.

Belli graduated from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1929. After traveling around the world, he received his law degree from the [[Berkeley Law|Boalt Hall School of Law]] at Berkeley in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100002246806&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Starr| first = Kevin| authorlink = Kevin Starr| title = Golden Dreams: California In An Age Of Abundance 1950-1963
| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2009| location = New York| pages = 101| isbn = 978-0-19-515377-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Following his admission to the California bar, his first job was posing as a hobo for the [[Works Progress Administration]] and riding the rails to observe the [[Great Depression|Depression]]'s impact on the country's [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] population. His first major legal victory came shortly after graduation, in a personal injury lawsuit representing an injured [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] gripman. Over insurance lawyers' objections, Belli brought a model of a cable car intersection, and the gear box and chain involved in the accident, to demonstrate to jurors exactly what had happened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bellisociety.org/bio.html Biography at the Melvin Belli Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides his personal injury cases, which earned for him his byname "King of Torts,"&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Belli was instrumental in setting up some of the foundations of modern [[consumer rights]] law, arguing several cases in the 1940s and 1950s that formed the basis for later lawsuits and landmark litigation by such figures as [[Ralph Nader]]. Belli argued (in cases such as ''[[Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co.]],'' in 1944, which arose from an incident in which a restaurant manager from [[Merced, California]] was injured by an exploding [[Coca-Cola]] bottle) that all products have an [[implied warranty]], that it is to be foreseen that products will be used by a long chain of people, not just the direct recipient of the manufactured product, and that negligence by a defendant need not be proven if the defendant's product is defective.

In his book ''Ready for the Plaintiff,'' Belli noted examples of negligence cited by himself and other personal-injury lawyers to win in court—for example, a colleague in [[Florida]], who showed how a builder violated a building code in [[Miami Beach]] concerning the use of wooden shims in construction of outside walls (forbidden by the municipal code because of the effect of the ocean salt and air). The facing was a slab of [[Vitreous marble]], whose adhesion was eventually weakened by the climate; it fell off the side of the building and injured a passerby, who sued the builder. After winning a court case, Belli would raise a [[Jolly Roger]] flag over his [[Montgomery Street]] office building in the [[Barbary Coast, San Francisco, California|Barbary Coast]] district of [[San Francisco]] (which Belli claimed had been a Gold Rush-era brothel) and fire a cannon, mounted on his office roof, to announce the victory and the impending party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sfweekly.com/2000-04-12/news/battle-belli/|title= Battle Belli|author= Davis, Lisa|date= 12 April 2000|work= |publisher= [[San Francisco Weekly]]|accessdate= 12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his best-known case, Belli represented [[Jack Ruby]], for free, after Ruby shot and killed [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]. Belli attempted to prove that Ruby was legally insane and had a history of mental illness in his family. On Saturday, March 14, 1964, Ruby was convicted of "murder with malice", and received a [[death sentence]]. Immediately thereafter, Ruby and his siblings fired Belli as they also hired and fired several other lawyers during the case. In late 1966, Ruby's conviction was overturned with help from other defense lawyers on the grounds that he did not receive a fair trial and a retrial was scheduled outside of [[Dallas]], but Ruby died of cancer before the retrial could take place. Belli became very critical of FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 1969 a man called San Francisco police, identifying himself as the serial killer known as [[Zodiac Killer|The Zodiac]], and agreed to call talk show host [[Jim Dunbar]] on Dunbar's morning television talk show, ''[[A.M. San Francisco]]'' if either Belli or attorney [[F. Lee Bailey]] were present on air. The police contacted Belli and Dunbar to arrange this in the hopes of capturing the individual. As promised, the suspect called, spoke a few words, and then hung up, repeating this activity 54 times over the next two hours.&lt;ref&gt;Whiting, Sam (June 27, 2000). [http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Last-Call-Innovator-Jim-Dunbar-retiring-after-3240279.php "Last Call / Innovator Jim Dunbar retiring after 37 years at KGO Newstalk radio"]. ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Belli received a letter from the Zodiac that same year.&lt;ref name=ZodiacUnmasked&gt;{{cite book| last = Graysmith| first = Robert| authorlink = Robert Graysmith| title = Zodiac Unmasked: The Identity of America's Most Elusive Serial Killer Revealed| publisher = Berkley Books| year = 2002| location = New York| pages = 13| isbn = 0-425-18332-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belli's firm filed for bankruptcy protection in December 1995. Belli was representing 800 women in a [[class action lawsuit]] against breast implant manufacturer [[Dow Corning]]. Belli won the lawsuit, but when Dow Corning declared bankruptcy, Belli had no way to recover the $5 million his firm had advanced to doctors and expert witnesses.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In the 1960s, Belli was among the leading members of the California plaintiffs bar who helped establish the California Trial Lawyers Association, which in the mid-1990s was renamed the [http://www.caoc.org Consumer Attorneys of California]. The organization was established to help set standards and foment on-going legal education to help consumers have a better chance in court against the powerful legal teams amassed by the insurance companies and big corporations that typically were the defendants in accident, personal injury and other consumer lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Preston|first=J.G.|title=A Day in Palm Springs|url=https://www.caoc.org/temp/ts_612687F4-02CD-13C9-5404591CBF11127A61268813-F12E-6219-6DE7A167186CFBDD/1102f-pg12-Preston.pdf|work=Forum magazine|publisher=Consumer Attorneys of California|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Woodard-Belli.jpg|right|thumb|[[David Woodard]] and Belli rehearsing oratory for "[[The War Prayer]]" in 1996]]

==In media==
Belli executive produced ''[[Tokyo File 212]]'' (1951), Hollywood's first film to be shot entirely in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tokyo File 212|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=50894|accessdate=10 May 2015|publisher=American Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured [[Florence Marly]] and Robert Peyton in key roles.{{Sfn|Wallace|1955|p=239}}

Belli appeared in "[[And the Children Shall Lead]]", a 1968  episode of the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' series. In it he appears as "Gorgan, the Friendly Angel", an evil being who corrupts a group of children, one of whom was played by his son Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/belli-melvin |title=Belli, Melvin |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=startrek.com |publisher=CBS Entertainment |accessdate=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared in the [[Albert and David Maysles]] documentary ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]'' (1970), which featured his representation and facilitation of The Rolling Stones' staging of the disastrous December 6, 1969, [[Altamont Free Concert]]. Belli enjoyed his frequent television and movie appearances; in 1965, he told [[Alex Haley]], interviewing him for ''[[Playboy]]'', that he "might have been an actor" if he had not become an attorney.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In 1986 he played a criminal defense lawyer in an episode of the TV series ''[[Hunter (1984 U.S. TV series)|Hunter]]'' entitled "True Confessions."&lt;ref name=IMDb/&gt;

In 1996 Belli recited the oratory to [[David Woodard]]'s brass fanfare setting of [[Mark Twain]]'s "[[The War Prayer]]" at Old First Church in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.ws/spruancegallery/projects/davidwoodard/davidwoodard.html David Woodard—"The War Prayer"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Belli was played by [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] in the 2007 film ''[[Zodiac (film)|Zodiac]]'', in the scene that depicted Belli's conversation with the Zodiac suspect on ''A.M. San Francisco''.&lt;ref name=ZodiacUnmasked/&gt;

==Author==
Belli was the author of several books, including the six-volume ''Modern Trials'' (written between 1954 and 1960) which has become a classic textbook on the demonstrative method of presenting evidence. Belli's unprecedented&amp;nbsp;— and some thought undignified&amp;nbsp;— use of graphic evidence and expert witnesses later became common courtroom practice. His autobiography, ''My Life on Trial'' is an account of his life and the noteworthy events he was involved in during his career. He also wrote the introduction to "847.0 The Whiplash Injury" by L. Ted Frigard, D.C. published in 1970. Dr. Frigard had helped Belli with his pain through chiropractic care.

==Personal life==
Belli was married six times and divorced five.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=King of Torts' Belli dead at 88:Flamboyant lawyer who pioneered product liability, personal injury law|author=Jim Herron|publisher=San Francisco Examiner|date=1996-07-10|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1996/07/10/NEWS2814.dtl&amp;hw=melvin+belli&amp;sn=004&amp;sc=774}}&lt;/ref&gt; His marriage to his fifth wife, the former Lia Georgia Triff, ended with a scandalous and acrimonious divorce proceeding in 1991. Belli accused his ex-wife of having an affair with archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] and of throwing one of his dogs off the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. He was fined $1,000 for repeatedly calling her "El Trampo". At one point, Belli was ejected from the courtroom after accusing the judge of sleeping with his former wife's lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/02/news/melvin-belli-court-lion-fighting-in-his-own-lair.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm Melvin Belli: Court Lion Fighting in His Own Lair] - [[New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was ultimately compelled to pay her an estimated $15 million. She later married a self-styled Romanian prince, [[Paul Lambrino]]. Belli married his sixth wife, Nancy Ho, on March 29, 1996.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; His youngest child, Melia, from fifth wife Lia, became an art history scholar, and is currently an assistant professor of Asian art history at the University of Texas at Arlington.&lt;ref name=melia&gt;{{cite news|title=Melia Belli bio |url=http://artsci.wustl.edu/~artarch/sections/faculty/belli.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603045639/http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~artarch/sections/faculty/belli.html |archivedate=June 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Belli died of complications from [[pancreatic cancer]], at his home in [[San Francisco]], on July 9, 1996, aged 88.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; His death came suddenly, and in the presence of his wife Nancy. ''[[The New York Times]]''' quoted his publicist [[Edward Lozzi]] saying, "He was sitting; he just stopped breathing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/10/us/melvin-belli-dies-at-88-flamboyant-lawyer-relished-his-role-as-kingof-torts.html | work=The New York Times | first=Richard | last=Severo | title=Melvin Belli Dies at 88; Flamboyant Lawyer Relished His Role as Kingof Torts | date=July 10, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, he had three sons, three daughters, twelve grandchildren, and two dogs.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He is buried in Odd Fellows Cemetery in Sonora, California, his birthplace.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''Military rites''' are honors presented at a [[funeral]] for a member of a [[military]] or [[police]] force. These rites, which are performed (usually) at the [[funeral#Burial service|burial]], include the firing of rifles, presenting of a flag and or bugle calls. In Australia and New Zealand a Poppy Service is often held for members of the Armed Forces. This includes a short reading by a member of the [[Returned Services League of Australia]] or, in New Zealand, the Returned Services Association, the laying of red [[Poppy (flower)|poppies]] on the coffin by all present, the playing of the [[Last Post]] (or [[Taps]] in the United States and [[Reveille]] and recitation of the [[Ode of Remembrance]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2863">'''New political thinking''' (or simply '''"new thinking"''') was the doctrine put forth by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as part of his reforms of the [[Soviet Union]]. Its major elements were deideologization of international politics, abandoning the concept of [[class struggle]], priority of universal human interests over the interests of any class, increasing interdependence of the world, mutual security based on political rather than military instruments, which constituted a significant shift from the previous principles of the [[Foreign relations of the Soviet Union|Soviet foreign politics]].&lt;ref name=daho&gt;[https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/1989-02-01/gorbachevs-new-thinking "Gorbachev's New Thinking"], by David Holloway, ''Foregn Affairs'', vol.68 no.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usdos&gt;[https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/rd/108225.htm "Gorbachev and New Thinking in Soviet Foreign Policy, 1987-88"], [[USDOS]] archive &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/russia/17.htm New Thinking: Foreign Policy under Gorbachev], in: Glenn E. Curtis, ed. ''Russia: A Country Study'', Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1996. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Gorbachev published the book ''[[Perestroika]] and New Political Thinking''&lt;ref&gt;Горбачев М. С. Перестройка и новое мышление для нашей страны и всего мира — М.: ИПЛ, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and in  December 1988 he presented the doctrine of new thinking in his speech to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=daho/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1991-2/warsaw-pact-dissolves/warsaw-pact-dissolves-texts/gorbachev-speaks-to-the-un/ Excerpts from the Address by Mikhail Gorbachev], 43rd U.N. General Assembly Session, December 7, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The "new thinking" was of vital necessity for the Soviet Union to shut down the costly [[Cold War]] competition in order to continue internal economic reforms of ''perestroika''.&lt;ref name=usdos/&gt; 

Notable steps in this direction included  [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]], Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, stopped support of communist movements around the world and loosened grip over the [[Eastern Europe]] by replacing the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] with [[Sinatra Doctrine]].&lt;ref name=usdos/&gt;

In 1990 Gorbachev was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Peace]] "for his leading role in the peace process". 

The overall effect of these developments was the end of the Cold War, the breakdown of the [[Soviet Empire]] and ultimately of the Soviet Union itself. &lt;ref name=usdos/&gt;

The [[meteor shower]] of the '''Pegasids''' occurs between the 7 and 13 July. It is a weak meteor shower that has its maximum around July 9 having a [[Zenithal Hourly Rate|ZHR]] of only 3 meteors per hour. The meteors have, however, an atmosphere entry speed of about 70&amp;nbsp;km/s.

The [[Radiant (meteor shower)|Radiant]] of the Pegasids is in the [[Constellation (astronomy)|constellation]] of [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]], around 5 degrees to the west of the [[star]] [[Alpha Pegasi|α Pegasi]]. The origin of this meteor shower is probably the [[comet]] [[C/1979 Y1 (Bradfield)]].&lt;ref name="mdc"&gt;[http://www.ta3.sk/IAUC22DB/MDC2007/Roje/pojedynczy_obiekt.php?kodstrumienia=00175 Meteor Data Center]&lt;/ref&gt; C/1979 Y1 has an orbital period of 300 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=1979Y1&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Central Europe]], the best time to watch them is the second half of the night, as the radiant reaches at that time a sufficient height over the [[horizon]].

'''''Peter Pan''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] based on [[J. M. Barrie]]'s 1904 play ''[[Peter Pan (play)|Peter Pan]]'' and Barrie's own [[novelization]] of it, ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''. The music is mostly by [[Mark Charlap|Mark "Moose" Charlap]], with additional music by [[Jule Styne]], and most of the lyrics were written by [[Carolyn Leigh]], with additional lyrics by [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]].

The original 1954 [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] production, starring [[Mary Martin]] as Peter and [[Cyril Ritchard]] as Captain Hook, earned [[Tony Awards]] for both stars. It was followed by [[NBC]] telecasts of it in 1955, 1956, and 1960 with the same stars, plus several rebroadcasts of the 1960 telecast. In 2014, the musical was broadcast on NBC featuring several new numbers, and starring [[Allison Williams (actress)|Allison Williams]] and [[Christopher Walken]]. The show has enjoyed several revivals onstage.

==Background and original 1954 production==
Several productions of [[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]] were staged early in the 20th century, starting in London in 1904, starring [[Nina Boucicault]] as Peter&lt;ref&gt;Duke of York's Theatre. "Peter Pan.", Reviews, ''The Times'', 28 December 1904&lt;/ref&gt; and on Broadway in 1905, starring [[Maude Adams]]. In a nod to the original play, and the [[pantomime]] tradition it derives from, the title role of [[Peter Pan]] in the musical is usually played by a woman, including [[Mary Martin]], [[Sandy Duncan]] and [[Cathy Rigby]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Pilkington, Angel M. [http://www.bard.org/education/studyguides/PeterPan/panmyth.html "Peter Pan: Myth and Fantasy",] ''Midsummer Magazine'', 2000, reprinted at the Utah Shakespearean Festival website, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer [[Edwin Lester]], founder and director of the [[Los Angeles Civic Light Opera]], acquired the American rights to adapt ''Peter Pan'' as a play with music for [[Mary Martin]]. The show was not successful in its pre-Broadway West Coast tour, so director [[Jerome Robbins]] hired lyricists [[Comden and Green]] and composer [[Jule Styne]] to add more songs, including "Never Never Land," "Distant Melody" and several other numbers, turning the show into a full-scale musical.&lt;ref name=Kenrick&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicals101.com/1950bway4.htm|title=Mary Martin: "Do You Believe?"| last=Kenrick| first=John|date=1996–2003|work=History of The Musical Stage|publisher=Musicals101.com| pages=1950s Part IV: The Great Dames|accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical, instead of using Barrie's original ending, in which Peter simply let Wendy and the other children return home, includes an additional scene that Barrie had written later and titled ''An Afterthought'' (later included by Barrie in his 1911 novelization ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''). In this ending, Peter returns after many years to take Wendy back to Never Never Land for spring cleaning. He finds that he has been away so long that Wendy is now an adult, married woman with a daughter. Despondent at first, he is delighted when Wendy's daughter Jane offers to be his new mother, and instead takes her with him.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/155972160X&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical premiered at the [[Curran Theatre]] in [[San Francisco]] on July 19, 1954. The initial four-week run was followed by an eight-week engagement in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ovrtur.com/production/2881500 "Peter Pan: Original Broadway Production (1954)"], Ovrtur.com, accessed March 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The show opened on Broadway on October 20, 1954 at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] for a planned limited run of 152 performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2470|title=Peter Pan|accessdate=25 December 2008|author=IBDB database|publisher=The Broadway League}}&lt;/ref&gt; The busy 1954 Broadway season also included ''[[The Boy Friend (musical)|The Boy Friend]]'', ''[[Fanny (musical)|Fanny]]'', ''[[Silk Stockings]]'' and ''[[Damn Yankees]]''. While still in tryouts, a deal was made for ''Peter Pan'' to be broadcast on the [[NBC]] [[anthology series]] ''[[Producers' Showcase]]'' on March 7, 1955, which ensured that it was a financial success despite the limited run. The revised score and [[Tony Award]]-winning performances by Martin and [[Cyril Ritchard]] made the musical a critical success, and tickets sold out throughout the Broadway run. The show closed on February 26, 1955 to prepare for the television broadcast.&lt;ref name=Kenrick/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Bruce K. ''The Peter Pan Chronicles: The Nearly 100 Year History of the Boy that Wouldn't Grow Up''. Birch Press: 1993, pp. 213–14&lt;/ref&gt;

A Broadway cast album was made of the songs, and it is still in print today.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Television productions==
In 1954, [[Fred Coe]], production manager for [[NBC]] in New York, began work on ''[[Producers' Showcase]]'', a 90-minute anthology series that aired every fourth Monday for three seasons. One aim of the series was to broadcast expensive color spectaculars to promote the new color television system developed by NBC's parent company [[RCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/coefred/coefred.htm |title=COE, FRED |accessdate=22 December 2008|author=Tino Balio |publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mary Martin Peter Pan.JPG|thumb|left|Martin as ''[[Peter Pan]]'']] 
On March 7, 1955, NBC presented ''Peter Pan'' live as part of ''Producers' Showcase'' (with nearly all of the show's original cast) as the first full-length Broadway production on color TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/P/htmlP/peterpan/peterpan.htm|title=Peter Pan |accessdate=22 December 2008|author=Tinky "Dakota" Weisblat|publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications. There are errors in this article, one of them implying that Lynn Fontanne narrated the first telecast, when Patricia Wheel narrated it. Ms. Fontanne narrated the 1960 telecast.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show attracted a then-record audience of 65-million viewers, the highest ever up to that time for a single television program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://novia.net/~ereitan/rca-nbc_firsts.html|title=RCA-NBC Firsts in Color Television|accessdate=22 December 2008|author=Ed Reitan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219060637/http://novia.net/~ereitan/rca-nbc_firsts.html|archivedate=19 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=coefred&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Martin and Cyril Ritchard had already won [[Tony Award]]s for their stage performances, and Martin won an [[Emmy Award]] for the television production. It was so well received that the musical was restaged live for television (again on ''Producers' Showcase'') on January 9, 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=peter+pan&amp;p=1&amp;item=B:53039|title=PRODUCERS' SHOWCASE: PETER PAN {TAPE 1 OF 2} (TV) |accessdate=22 December 2008|publisher=The Paley Center for Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these broadcasts were produced live and in color, but only black-and-white [[kinescope]] recordings survive.

''Peter Pan'' was restaged on December 8, 1960,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/dvd/release/DVCRiDHJN0mJGG|title=Peter Pan (1960)|accessdate=22 December 2008|author=MovieWeb|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414235413/http://www.movieweb.com/dvd/release/DVCRiDHJN0mJGG|archivedate=14 April 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; this time in a 100-minute version rather than 90 minutes (not counting the commercials),&lt;ref name="IMDb"/&gt; and with a slightly different cast because the original children had outgrown their roles. ''Producers' Showcase'' had long since gone off the air, so the 1960 production was intended as a "stand alone" special instead of an episode of an anthology series. Act II was split into two acts, for a total of five acts instead of three, to allow for more commercial breaks. This version was [[videotape]]d in color at NBC's Brooklyn studio. Martin was also starring in Broadway's ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' at the time. The production was directed for television by [[Vincent J. Donehue]], who received a Director's Guild Award for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nypl.org/research/manuscripts/the/thedonehue1.xml|title=Inventory of the Vincent J. Donehue Papers, 1946–1965|accessdate=22 December 2008|author=Elisabeth Elkind|publisher=The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Foy]] re-created the signature flying sequences he had staged for the 1954 Broadway production and the two Producers' Showcase broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Mary "My Heart Belongs", pp. 203–210, William Morrow and Co., Inc. 1976 {{ISBN|0-688-03009-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This 1960 version was rebroadcast in 1963, 1966 and 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054176/|title=Peter Pan (1960)|accessdate=22 December 2008|author=The Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video tape of that production was restored and rebroadcast by NBC on March 24, 1989, then again on March 31, 1991, after which it went to the [[Disney Channel]], where it was shown several times more. Beginning in 1989, the program was slightly cut to make room for more commercial time. Eliminated completely was a dance that Liza (the Darling family maid) and the animals of Neverland perform to an orchestral version of ''Never Never Land''.  Also eliminated was Mary Martin's curtain speech at the end thanking NBC for making the program possible, which, in the 1960, 1963, and 1966 telecasts led directly into the closing credits. Gone also was the [[intertitle]] bearing the credit ''Peter Pan: Act III'', but not the other intertitle credits, so that the show seemed to be performed in three acts, just as in the stage version.

This 1960 production of ''Peter Pan'' was released on [[VHS]] home video in 1990 and on DVD on October 19, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JZHL|title=Peter Pan (1960)|accessdate=22 December 2008|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the three Mary Martin television versions of ''Peter Pan'' was telecast from a theatre with a live audience. All three were performed in the NBC studios. In 2000, [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] presented a TV production of the Broadway show, starring [[Cathy Rigby]], recorded in front of a live audience.&lt;ref name=A&amp;E&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3AinQhTjR8 ''Peter Pan'' (2000 A&amp;E TV presentation starring Cathy Rigby)] on YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDbCathy&gt;{{IMDb title|0255873|Peter Pan (2000 A&amp;E TV production starring Cathy Rigby)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, NBC broadcast ''[[Peter Pan Live!]]'', a new production of the musical starring [[Allison Williams (actress)|Allison Williams]] as Peter, [[Christopher Walken]] as Captain Hook, [[Kelli O'Hara]] as Mrs. Darling, [[Christian Borle]] as Mr. Darling/Smee and [[Minnie Driver]] as the adult Wendy.&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew. http://www.playbill.com/article/girls-star-lands-coveted-title-role-in-nbcs-peter-pan-live-com-325758 "''Girls'' Star Lands Coveted Title Role in NBC's ''Peter Pan Live!''"], ''Playbill'', July 30, 2014, accessed May 17, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Critical reviews were mixed, with many reviewers expressing relief that the broadcast was not a disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Hetrick, Adam.

==Later revivals==
The show was revived in 1979 on Broadway at the [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]], produced by Nancy and Ronnie Horowitz, starring [[Sandy Duncan]] and [[George Rose (actor)|George Rose]], and ran for 554 performances. Duncan was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical|Best Actress Tony]], and the show was nominated for [[Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical|Best Revival of a Musical]].&lt;ref name="tonyawards.com"&gt;http://www.tonyawards.com/p/tonys_search&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tonyawards.com"/&gt;

A third Broadway production was mounted in 1990, originally at the Lunt-Fontanne, running for 45 performances. A return engagement opened 10 months later, this time at the [[Minskoff Theatre]], running for an additional 48 performances. Both engagements starred former Olympic gymnast [[Cathy Rigby]] as Peter; the first co-starred Stephen Hanan and the second [[J. K. Simmons]]. The production was nominated for Best Revival of a Musical at the 1991 Tonys, and Rigby was nominated for Best Actress. Rigby returned to Broadway as Peter Pan in 1998 at the [[Marquis Theatre]], with [[Paul Schoeffler]] co-starring. This production ran for 48 performances. A return engagement with the same stars opened in 1999 at the [[George Gershwin Theatre]] and ran for 166 performances. This engagement was nominated for the 1999 Tony for Best Revival of a Musical.&lt;ref name="tonyawards.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255873/&lt;/ref&gt;
It was then recorded at the [[La Mirada, California|La Mirada Theater]] for broadcast in October 2000 on the [[A&amp;E Network]].&lt;ref name=A&amp;E/&gt; The video release cuts the program to about 96 minutes and was shot using eight cameras, produced by Line By Line Productions for McCoy/Rigby Entertainment, directed by Gary Halvorson and produced by Marc Bauman. Designers of the production were John Iacovelli (set), Shigeru Yaji (costumes) and Martin Aronstein (lights). Flying illusions are by [[ZFX Inc]]. Craig Barna is the musical director.  It reconceived the potentially offensive "Ugg-a-Wugg" song about Native Americans as a percussive dance number.  The flying effects were changed to include some flights that were not practical to do in the theatrical version, such as the somersault flips during "I'm Flying", and electronically erasing the wires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/54219-Rigbys-Peter-Pan-Flies-Into-Homes-on-AE-Oct-8-On-Video-and-DVD-Oct10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611065644/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/54219-Rigbys-Peter-Pan-Flies-Into-Homes-on-AE-Oct-8-On-Video-and-DVD-Oct10 |archivedate=2013-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Noseworthy]] is the only male actor to have played Peter Pan on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]; he was an [[understudy]] in the revue ''[[Jerome Robbins' Broadway]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005276/bio Jack Noseworthy] at the IMDB database&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
'''The Darling Nursery'''

As Mr. and Mrs. Darling prepare for an evening out, two of their children, Wendy and John, play at being their parents. When Mrs. Darling notices Michael is left out, she gets him into the game and joins in with all of them ("1, 2, 3") watched by the dog Nana,  their [[nursemaid]]. When Mr. Darling comes in to have his tie tied, he questions having a dog as a nursemaid, but Mrs. Darling defends her. The previous week, while the children slept, Nana saw a boy in the room who flew out of the window before she could catch him, leaving behind his shadow, which Mrs. Darling has put away in a drawer. In spite of this, Mr. Darling insists on Nana spending the night downstairs. Mrs. Darling and the children sing a [[lullaby]] ("Tender Shepherd").
[[File:Mary Martin Peter Pan Broadway.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Peter Pan ([[Mary Martin]]) shows the Darling children he can fly; [[Kathy Nolan]] plays Wendy (1954)]]
The children fall asleep. A [[fairy]], [[Tinker Bell]], and Peter Pan fly in through the window to look for his shadow. Wendy is woken up by the boy's cries when he is unable to re-attach his shadow and helps him by sewing it back on. Peter is thrilled when his shadow is re-attached ("I've Gotta Crow") and tells her that he lives in Neverland ("Never Never Land") with the Lost Boys. Wendy wakes her brothers up, and Peter invites them all to Neverland, and promises to teach them to fly. Peter happily launches himself into the air ("I'm Flying").

Peter sprinkles the children with fairy dust and tells them to "think lovely thoughts" ("I'm Flying – Reprise"). The children follow Peter, but Michael goes back when maid Liza comes into the room, giving her some of his fairy dust and inviting her to come to Neverland with them.

===Act II===
'''Never Land'''

Peter's "Lost Boys" are standing outside their underground lair, wondering when he will return, when they hear Captain Hook and his pirates ("Pirate Song"). The boys hide. Hook tells Smee, his right-hand man, that he wants to kill Peter, because he cut off his hand and threw it to a [[crocodile]], which has since then developed a taste for Hook and follows him around. Luckily for Hook, the crocodile has swallowed a clock that ticks and alerts Hook to its presence. Hook accidentally stumbles upon the entrance to the hideout, and summons Smee and his men to provide background music while he plans the Boys' demise ("Hook's [[Tango music|Tango]]"), a rich cake with poisonous icing. Hook suddenly hears a loud tick-tock; the crocodile appears but Hook escapes. The pirates flee, and the Boys reappear, thinking they are safe. Suddenly, a group of "Indians" appears, led by Tiger Lily ("Indians"). They leave the Boys alone, and go on hunting the pirates.

The Lost Boys suddenly spot Wendy in the sky and taking her for a bird, one of them shoots an arrow. Peter, Michael and John land to find the arrow lodged in her heart, although she isn't dead. The Lost Boys build a house around her, hoping that she will become their mother ("Wendy"), to which, when she wakes up, she agrees. Hook plants the cake, but Wendy doesn't let the children eat it as she knows it wouldn't be good for them; instead, she tells the Boys stories. Hook is infuriated that the Boys have found a mother. He plots to kidnap Wendy and the Boys, while Smee and the pirates play a "[[Tarantella]]". After the pirates leave for their ship, Liza arrives and dances with the animals of Neverland while Peter keeps watch outside the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people = Mary Martin (actor) |date = 1960-12-08 |title = Peter Pan |medium = Videotape |publisher =National Broadcasting Company/GoodTimes Home Video Corporation |location = New York |isbn = 1-55510-505-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days pass with everyone having adventures. One day in the forest, after Peter leads the Boys in their anthem ("I Won't Grow Up"), they almost run into the pirates, who have captured Tiger Lily and tie her to a tree. Peter hides and mimics Hook's voice, ordering the men to release her. When Hook arrives, he is enraged and demands that the "spirit of the forest" speak to him. Peter tricks them all into thinking he is Hook, and that the real Hook is a codfish. Hook asks the "spirit" to reveal its true identity. Peter obliges, pretending to be a "beautiful lady" ("Oh, My Mysterious Lady") and Hook and his pirates try to ambush Peter, but they are chased away by Tiger Lily and her tribe of Native Americans.

Back at the hideout, Tiger Lily and her tribe are almost shot by the Boys, until Peter reveals the truce between them. They smoke a peace pipe and vow eternal friendship ("Ugg-a-Wugg"). Tiger Lily and her Indians leave to stand guard around the house above. Wendy asks Peter to sing the Boys a lullaby ("Distant Melody"). Michael and John want to return home, and Wendy admits to being homesick, too. The Boys wish they had parents, and Wendy offers hers to all of them. Everyone is excited about being adopted, except Peter, who says he will not go because he knows he will grow up if he does. Wendy tells him she will come back once a year to do his [[spring cleaning]].

The pirates attack and subdue the Indians. They give Peter a fake all-clear signal, so Peter sadly sends Wendy, her brothers, and the Lost Boys on their way. Before she leaves, Wendy sets out Peter's "medicine" for him to take before bed. After she tearfully leaves, Peter, who pretended not to care, throws himself on a bed and cries himself to sleep.  As they leave the underground house, Wendy and the boys are captured by the pirates. Hook then sneaks into the lair and poisons Peter's medicine. Tinker Bell awakens Peter, tells him of the ambush, and warns him about the poison, but he waves her off as he prepares for a rescue. Desperate, she drinks the poison herself. Dying, she tells Peter that if every boy and girl who believes in fairies would clap their hands, she would live. Peter [[Breaking the fourth wall|asks the audience]] to believe and clap their hands. They do, and Tinker Bell is saved. Peter grabs his sword and heads off to rescue Wendy and the Boys.

===Act III===
'''The Jolly Roger'''

Hook revels in his success ("Hook's [[Waltz]]"). As the plank is prepared, Hook hears the tick-tock of the crocodile and panics. It is actually Peter with a clock, and while Hook cowers Peter and the Boys help the Indians, the animals and Liza onto the ship and hide. Peter hides in a closet and kills two pirates Hook sends in. A third pirate, Starkey, refuses to obey Hook's order to go in and jumps overboard. The pirates then carry the Boys in, and the Boys pretend to be afraid as they are carried in. Peter disguises himself as a pirate, and the pirates think the "doodle-doo" (named so because Peter still crows after killing the pirates) killed all the Boys. Hook believes the ship is now cursed, and everyone thinks Wendy is the source. The pirates push Wendy to the plank. Peter ditches his disguise and the Indians and animals attack, as well as the Boys who are alive and armed. The pirates are all defeated, and Peter challenges Hook to a duel and defeats him. Hook threatens to blow up the ship with a bomb, but runs into the real crocodile (whom Peter also brought on the ship). Peter catches the dropped bomb and tosses it in the sea after Hook slides down the plank (which is shaped like a slide) with the crocodile chasing behind him. As Peter puts his fingers in his ears, the bomb explodes and Hook is either blown to smithereens or is eaten by the crocodile. Everyone sings Peter's praises ("I've Gotta Crow" [reprise]). Before the Darling children and the Lost Boys go to London, Liza asks Peter to teach her to crow ("I Gotta Crow" [2nd reprise]).

Back home, the Darlings sit by the nursery window night after night, hoping for the return of their children. The children silently reappear and sing to their mother ("Tender Shepherd" [reprise]). The Darlings happily agree to adopt the Lost Boys ("We Will Grow Up"). Wendy promises to wait for Peter, hoping that one day he will return for her.

Years pass, and Peter returns to the nursery, surprising a much older Wendy, who no longer expected him. He has come to take her to Neverland for Spring cleaning, but she declines as she is now grown up; married with a daughter of her own, Jane. Peter starts to cry, and Wendy leaves the room at the sound of her husband's offstage voice. Jane awakes and, like her mother before her, asks, "Boy, why are you crying?" Peter introduces himself, but Jane knows all about him from her mother's stories. She has been waiting for him to come take her to Neverland and to learn to fly. Peter, now happy again, throws fairy dust on her, but as they are about to leave, Wendy tries to stop them, saying, "Oh, if only I could go with you!" In the most poignant moment of the show, Peter answers with a sad but understanding smile, "You can't. You see, Wendy ... you're too grown up". And so Wendy reluctantly lets Jane go, "just for Spring cleaning." Her daughter and the "boy who wouldn't grow up" fly off into the night as Wendy watches from the window. ("Finale: Never Never Land [Reprise]")

'''Republic Day''' ({{lang-kz|'''Республика күні''', '''Respwblïka küni'''}}), observed on 16 December, is a [[Kazakhstan#Public holidays|public holiday in Kazakhstan]], celebrating the independence of the country from the [[Soviet Union]].

In the waning days of Soviet rule, individual [[republics of the Soviet Union]] sought greater autonomy. The Soviet Union agreed in early 1990 to give up its monopoly of political power. Following the lead of the [[Lithuanian SSR]], the [[Russian SFSR]] and others, the [[Kazakh SSR]] declared its sovereignty on 25 October 1990, and [[Kazakhstan]] subsequently became independent on 16 December 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed.

'''Robert Serber''' (March 14, 1909 – June 1, 1997) was an American physicist who participated in the [[Manhattan Project]]. Serber's lectures explaining the basic principles and goals of the project were printed and supplied to all incoming scientific staff, and became known as ''[[The Los Alamos Primer]]''. The ''[[New York Times]]'' called him “the intellectual midwife at the birth of the atomic bomb.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
He was born in [[Philadelphia]] as the eldest son of David Serber and Rose Frankel in a Jewish family.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/serber-robert.pdf p.4, 7, 9&lt;/ref&gt; He married Charlotte Leof (26 Jul 1911 – 1967) in 1933, the daughter of his stepmother's uncle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/serber-robert.pdf p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Rose Serber died in 1922 and David married Charlotte's cousin Frances Leof in 1928. He earned his [[B.S.]] in [[engineering physics]] from [[Lehigh University]] in 1930 and earned his [[Ph.D.]] in [[physics]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] with [[John Van Vleck]] in 1934. 

Shortly before receiving his doctorate, Serber was selected for a [[National Academies|National Research Council]] [[postdoctoral fellowship]] and planned on conducting research at [[Princeton University]] with [[Eugene Wigner]]. However, after spontaneously enrolling at the [[University of Michigan]]'s physics summer school, he changed his plans and went to work with [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. For the next four years, he shuttled with Oppenheimer between Berkeley and the [[California Institute of Technology]], where Oppenheimer held a secondary faculty appointment. In 1938, he took one of the era's few tenure-track professorships in physics at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], where he stayed until he was recruited for the [[Manhattan Project]].

==Manhattan Project==
He was recruited for the Manhattan Project in 1941, and was in [[Project Alberta]] on the dropping of the bomb. When the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] was first organized, Oppenheimer decided not to compartmentalize the technical information among different departments. This increased the effectiveness of the technical workers in problem solving, and emphasized the urgency of the project in their minds, now they knew what they were working on. So it fell to Serber to give a series of lectures explaining the basic principles and goals of the project. These lectures were printed and supplied to all incoming scientific staff, and became known as ''[[The Los Alamos Primer]]'', LA-1. It was declassified in 1965. Serber developed the first good theory of bomb assembly hydrodynamics.

[[File:Agnew RobertSerber.jpg|right|thumb|325px|Serber on Tinian in 1945, just before the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]
Serber's wife [[Charlotte Serber]] was appointed by Oppenheimer to head the technical library at Los Alamos, where she was the only wartime female section leader.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/07/30/the-bomb-and-its-makers/ The bomb and its makers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Serber created the code-names for all three design projects, the "[[Little Boy]]" (uranium gun), "[[Thin Man nuclear bomb|Thin Man]]" (plutonium gun), and "[[Fat Man]]" (plutonium implosion), according to his reminiscences (1998). The names were based on their design shapes; the "Thin Man" would be a very long device, and the name came from the [[Dashiell Hammett]] [[The Thin Man|detective novel]] and [[The Thin Man (film)|series of movies]] of the same name; the "Fat Man" bomb would be round and fat and was named after [[Sydney Greenstreet]]'s character in ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (from [[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|Hammett's novel]]). "Little Boy" would come last and be named only to contrast to the "Thin Man" bomb. This differs from the unsupported theory, now abandoned, that "Fat Man" was named after Churchill and "Thin Man" after Roosevelt (see Links).

Serber was to go on the camera plane for the Nagasaki mission, "[[Big Stink (B-29)|Big Stink]]", but it left without him when group operations officer Major James I. Hopkins ordered him off the plane as he had forgotten his parachute, reportedly after the B-29 had already taxied onto the runway. Since Serber (who was commissioned as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in the [[United States Army]] for the mission and thus technically outranked Hopkins) was the only crew member who knew how to operate the high-speed camera, Hopkins had to be instructed by radio from Tinian on its use. Serber was with the first American team to enter [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] to assess the results of the atomic bombing of the two cities.

==Post-war work==
In 1948, Serber had to defend himself against anonymous accusations of disloyalty, mostly because his wife Charlotte's family were Jewish intellectuals with [[socialist]] leanings, and also because he tried to remove politics from discussions of the feasibility of the fusion bomb, leading to arguments with [[Edward Teller]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/manhattan-project-library-charlotte-serber-oppenheimer-fbi Michael Waters, ''The Librarian Who Guarded the Manhattan Project’s Secrets'']&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had been cleared of any potential wrongdoing at a subsequent hearing that year, he was denied a prerequisite security clearance for a Japanese physics conference in 1952, precipitating his refusal to join a Teller-chaired [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] advisory group.&lt;ref&gt;https://nuclearweaponarchive.org/News/Serberobit.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nevertheless, Serber went on to consult numerous labs, businesses, and commissions, including [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (where he worked one day a week during the academic year and occasional summers for twenty years) and [[Fermilab]]. Although largely bereft of any ideology, he refused to join [[JASON (advisory group)|JASON]] because of his previous clearance issues and opposition to the [[Vietnam War]].

In 1951, he became a professor of physics at [[Columbia University]]. He served as chair of the department from 1975 until his retirement as [[professor emeritus]] in 1978.

In 1972 Serber was awarded the [[J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Winners, the blue ribbon encyclopedia of awards |last=Walter |first=Claire |year=1982 |page= 438|publisher=Facts on File Inc.|isbn=9780871963864 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Serber is recipient of Oppenheimer Prize |url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/25/4/10.1063/1.3070824 |journal=Physics Today |publisher=American Institute of Physics |date=April 1972 |page= |doi=10.1063/1.3070824 |access-date=1 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Serber is interviewed in the Oscar-nominated documentary, ''[[The Day After Trinity]]'' (1980). In the 1989 movie dramatization of the Manhattan Project, ''[[Fat Man and Little Boy]]'', the role of Robert Serber is played by [[H. David Politzer]], a professor of theoretical physics at Caltech.  Politzer was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2004.

Serber died June 1, 1997 at his home in Manhattan from complications following surgery for brain cancer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Freeman, Karen, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/02/us/robert-serber-88-physicist-who-aided-birth-of-a-bomb.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Robert%20Serber&amp;st=cse "Robert Serber, 88, Physicist Who Aided Birth of A-Bomb"]; ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 2, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saga balloon 2007 1.jpg|thumb]]
The {{nihongo|'''Saga International Balloon Fiesta'''|佐賀インターナショナルバルーンフェスタ|Saga Intānashonaru Barūn Fesuta}} is held at the beginning of November every year in [[Saga Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. In 2014 it took place between October 30 and November 3.
 
The fiesta is held just outside [[Saga, Saga|Saga City]], along the Kase River. It has grown from a gathering of 5 hot air balloons to a competition where over 3500 people volunteer, and has gained a reputation as one of the top ballooning competitions in the world. It is also a popular time for tourists as the [[Karatsu Kunchi]] Festival is held at the same time in [[Karatsu City]]. Since 1980 the launch site has been visited by over 10 million spectators.

For the duration of the event, a temporary [[Kyushu Railway Company|JR]] station ([[Balloon Saga Station]]) ferries passengers between Saga City and [[Kubota, Saga|Kubota]]. 

==History==
The fiesta started in 1978 in [[Amagi, Fukuoka|Amagi City]], [[Fukuoka Prefecture]], as a smaller ballooning event, the ''Balloon Fiesta in Kyushu.'' In 1980 the Fiesta was moved to the outskirts of Saga City, where there is more room. In 1984 it became an international competition and was given its present name; in the same year the first Japanese National Hot Air Balloon Championship was held, and balloonists from all over Japan came to the grounds.

Since 1984 there have been approximately 640 balloons from overseas participants (nearly 3000 crew and pilots). In 1990 the first Pacific Championship was held in Saga. Between 1990 and 1996 women from around the world gathered to participate in the Ladies World Cup. Saga was the first place to have a competition of this kind.

Beginning in 1992 a category for special shaped balloons, called ''Balloon Fantasia'' was created. Also started at this time was the ''La Montgolfier Nocturne (The Night of Hot Air Balloons)''; tethered inflated balloons light their burners in a choreographed manner, illuminating their unique shapes.  This is a highlight of the fiesta.

In November 1997 the 13th Hot Air Balloon World Championships were again held in Saga. With numbers rarely seen outside of the [[United States]], this event was attended by over 38 countries and territories. There were 112 balloons present for the World Championship and together with the balloons that were competing in the [[Honda]] Grand Prix ''Final Battle'', Balloon Fantasia, and official balloons there were 170 balloons flying through the skies of Saga.

In 1997, special days during the Fiesta were established for people to experience the balloons. These include ''Heartful Day'', a day geared toward handicapped members of the community; and ''Kids Day'', a hot air balloon classroom for children.

In the United States, sexual harassment in education is an unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature that interferes with a student’s ability to learn, study, work or participate in school activities. It is a form of [[discrimination]] under [[Title IX]] of the Education Amendments of 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/sexhar01.html ed.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shakespeare in the Park''' (or '''Free Shakespeare in the Park''') is a theatrical program that stages productions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] plays at the [[Delacorte Theater]], an open-air theater in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]]. The theater and the productions are managed by [[The Public Theater]] and tickets are distributed free of charge on the day of the performance. Originally branded as the '''New York Shakespeare Festival''' (NYSF) under the direction of [[Joseph Papp]], the institution was renamed in 2002 as part of a larger reorganization by the Public Theater.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/492441/Shakespeare_and_Central_Park_Shakespeare_Under_and_With_the_Stars&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festival was originally conceived by director-producer [[Joseph Papp]] in 1954. Papp began with a series of Shakespeare workshops, then moved on to free productions on the [[Lower East Side]]. Eventually, the plays moved to a lawn in front of [[Great Lawn and Turtle Pond, Central Park|Turtle Pond]] in Central Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richardson|first1=Haley|title=Joseph Papp and Shakespeare in the Park, 1962 &amp; 1965|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/142852-joseph-papp/|website=WNYC|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, parks commissioner [[Robert Moses]] demanded that Papp and his company charge a fee for the performances to cover the cost of "grass erosion." A court battle ensued. Papp continued to fight Moses, winning his enduring respect and the quote "well, let's build the bastard a theater." Following this, Moses requested funds from the city for the construction of an amphitheater in the park. In 1961, the [[Delacorte Theater]] was built. The first performance held in the theater in 1962 was Shakespeare's ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', starring [[George C. Scott]] and [[James Earl Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blank|first1=Matthew|title=PHOTO SPECIAL: 50 Years of Shakespeare in the Park at the Delacorte|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/photo-special-50-years-of-shakespeare-in-the-park-at-the-delacorte-com-194706|website=Playbill|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

===Location and allure===
The [[Delacorte Theater]] is an open-air amphitheater located on the southwest corner of the Great Lawn in Central Park, closest to the entrance at 81st Street and Central Park West. It was built in 1961 and named for George T. Delacorte, Jr., who donated money for its creation. [[Belvedere Castle]] and Turtle Pond provide a backdrop for the shows at the Delacorte.  As shows at the Delacorte begin in the early evening, shows usually start in daylight; as the play rolls on, the sun sets and the audience is drawn into the illuminated action on the stage. Since 1962 the Public has had the privilege of its exclusive use.

===Ticket distribution===
[[File:Awaiting Shakespeare CP jeh.jpg|thumb|Awaiting tickets]]

Tickets to Shakespeare in the Park are free and tickets for a given performance are distributed the same day by various methods:
*Central Park distribution – Up to two tickets per person are distributed outside the Delacorte Theater. The line for tickets forms when the park opens at 6 a.m. and grows until tickets are distributed at noon. A separate line is available for senior citizens 65 and older with valid I.D. The ADA Accessible line is intended for patrons with disabilities and can be joined by checking in with staff at the box office the morning of a performance who will provide, as availability dictates, tickets in locations suited to various individual needs.
*Downtown Lottery - A limited number of vouchers for that evening's performance are distributed through an in-person lottery at the Public Theater. Lottery entries are accepted between 11 am and 12 pm and winners are drawn while supplies last.
*Borough distribution – A limited number of vouchers for specific performances are distributed at locations throughout New York City's five boroughs on certain days during the run of a production. Each person in line is allowed two vouchers and each voucher is good for one ticket for that evening’s performance. Vouchers must be exchanged for tickets at the Delacorte Theater box office that same day from 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Tickets cannot be exchanged in the event the performance is rained-out which is a possibility. A performance will never be cancelled before the scheduled start time and may continue in the rain if it is deemed safe by the production staff. Late seating is at the discretion of management and may not be granted until 30–40 minutes into the show.&lt;ref&gt;http://publictheater.org/Programs--Events/Shakespeare-in-the-Park/Free-Ticket-Distribution-in-the-Park/&lt;/ref&gt;
*TodayTix – In 2015, the Public introduced its partnership with the app TodayTix.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.todaytix.com/us/nyc/lottery/shakespeare-in-the-park/&lt;/ref&gt; App users can log on and apply for the virtual lottery for that day's show. Winners are notified between 12 pm and 2:30 pm.

Shakespeare in the Park also offers specific performances throughout the summer for patrons with hearing and/or vision loss including Sign Language interpreted performances, audio-described performances, and open-captioned performances.

===Productions===

{{main article|List of Shakespeare in the Park productions at the Delacorte Theater}}

Each summer since the Delacorte's opening has seen between one and three works produced, with two works being standard since 1973. The plays of Shakespeare account for about four-fifths of the works produced, and, except for 1977 and 1980, each summer's line-up has included at least one work by Shakespeare (or, in the case of 1970, one work adapted from Shakespeare). Non-Shakespeare productions have included plays such as [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' and [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' and musicals such as ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]]'', ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona (musical)|Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'', and ''[[Drood|The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'', the latter two having made their world debuts at the Delacorte.

The 2017 production of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' stirred up controversy over the similarities between President [[Donald Trump]] and the production's portrayal of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]. Despite the fact that the play, which revolves around the murder of Caesar, is widely viewed as a cautionary tale against political violence and "the use of antidemocratic means to defend a democracy",&lt;ref name="Pallotta"&gt;Frank Pallotta, [http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/12/media/julius-caesar-public-theater-shakespeare/index.html Trump-like 'Julius Caesar' isn't the first time the play has killed a contemporary politician], CNN (June 12, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Paulson |first1=Michael |last2=Deb |first2=Sopan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/theater/donald-trump-julius-caesar-public-theater-oskar-eustis.html |title=How Outrage Built Over a Shakespearean Depiction of Trump |date=June 12, 2017 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paulson|first1=Michael|title=Two Protesters Disrupt 'Julius Caesar' in Central Park|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/17/theater/julius-caesar-central-park-trump-protesters.html|accessdate=June 17, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=June 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; commentators objected to what they characterized as the murder of a stand-in for President Trump.

===Funding===
The Public Theater is heavily reliant on private donors. In 2005, the theater company was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation]], which was made possible through a donation by then-NYC Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/nyregion/06donate.html|title=City Groups Get Bloomberg Gift of $20 Million|author=Sam Roberts|work=The New York Times|date=July 6, 2005|accessdate=January 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity and acclaim==
Many plays from the summer festival have gone on to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], including [[Wilford Leach]]'s staging of ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood (musical)|The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'' from the 1984–1985 season and ''[[The Tempest]]'' from the 1995–1996 season. The festival has also attracted many well-known actors, such as [[Meryl Streep]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Martin Sheen]], and [[Al Pacino]] – the latter two of whom appeared as Brutus and Marc Antony in a toga-clad historical production of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', directed by Stuart Vaughan in 1987, in the first of the NYSF's Shakespeare Marathon. Since its inception, the festival has become popular with both New York natives and visitors to the city, and while the Delacorte Theater has 1,872 seats, prospective theatergoers can expect to sit in line for hours before the early afternoon ticket distribution. Approximately 80,000 people attend Shakespeare in the Park every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc24.org/2005/centralpark/art/shakespeare.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205013448/http://www.nyc24.org/2005/centralpark/art/shakespeare.html |archivedate=December 5, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}, nyc24.org; accessed February 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsorship of other theatres==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
Over the years, the New York Shakespeare Festival supported other theatre companies throughout New York, helping to foster the growth of [[Off-Broadway]], as well as specific theatre programs and projects.  Among these companies that benefited from NYSF during critical periods of their development was the [[Theatre for a New Audience]]. The Theatre for a New Audience developed a number of productions sponsored by the NYSF, including ''A Midsummer Nights Dream'', presented at the Ansbacher Theatre, and through this sponsorship, the company was able to grow and expand its outreach to new audiences.  Another such company was the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]]. The Festival, under Papp's leadership, sponsored several Riverside Shakespeare Company productions at a critical stage in its development, beginning with Riverside's New York premiere production of Brecht's ''[[The Life of Edward II of England|Edward II]]'' in 1982 at [[The Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side (dedicated by Joseph Papp in 1982), followed by [[Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] parks tours of free Shakespeare throughout the five boroughs of New York City, much as the NYSF had done for years before. Riverside Shakespeare Company summer parks tour of Free Shakespeare sponsored by the NYSF began with ''A Comedy of Errors'' in 1982, followed by ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'', featuring [[Anna Deavere Smith]] in her New York stage debut as Mistress Quickly, ''Romeo and Juliet'', and ''The Taming of the Shrew''. During the NYSF period of support, the Riverside Shakespeare Company expanded greatly, offering for the first time [[The Shakespeare Project]] in 1983, and serving a wide range of audiences in the five boroughs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4538">'''Swedish Dancesport Federation''' ('''DSF''') administers all [[dancesport]] in [[Sweden]]. The [[Voluntary association|association]] was formed on February 25, 1968, and is one of 68 different sports federations in Sweden. DSF became a member of the [[Swedish Sports Confederation]] (RF) in 1977, which administers all [[sports in Sweden]]. Apart from this membership Swedish Dancesport Federation also is a member of the [[International Dancesport Federation]] (IDSF) from June 19, 2011 known as the [[IDSF|World DanceSport Federation]] (WDSF) and the [[World Rock'n'Roll Confederation]] (WRRC). The office lies in [[Farsta]], [[Stockholm]].

==Overview==
Swedish Dancesport Federation covers approximately 38,500 members in 156 associated [http://www.danssport.org/web/index.asp?page=75 danceclubs] (2008), from [[Kiruna]] in the very north of Sweden to [[Malmö]] in the south.

Swedish Dancesport Federation is divided into 9 regions. These regional dancesport federations are more often called [[district]]s.

The presidium is selected from the [[annual general meeting]]. The presidium comprises the federation's chairman and six general members, and three deputies selected from the annual meeting. In order to support the activities, the organisation is divided in different committees, whose members are elected by the presidium.
These committees are; Dance BRR (Bugg and Rock'n'Roll dances), Dance Tendance, Information-PR, Youth, Jurisprudence, District-Central Projects and Line Dance.

[[Dancesport]] within the association is divided in three dance categories. Namely [[Ballroom dancing]] (Tendance), [[Swing dance]]s or as called in [[Sweden]] Bugg and Rock'n' Roll dances (in short terms just [[BRR dances]]) besides [[Line dance]]. Ballroom covers five Latin dances ([[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha-Cha-Cha]], [[Samba]], [[Rhumba|Rumba]], [[Paso Doble]] and [[Jive (dance)|Jive]]), and five [[International Standard (dance)|Standard]] dances ([[Slow Waltz]], [[Tango (ballroom)|Tango]], [[Slow Foxtrot]], [[Viennese Waltz]] and [[Quickstep]]). BRR dances covers [[Bugg]], [[Double bugg]], [[Lindy Hop]] ([[Jitterbug]]), [[Boogie Woogie]] and [[Rock and Roll (dance)|Rock'n'Roll dance]].

The danceclubs, associated to Swedish Dancesport Federation, arranges each year approximately 75-100 [[dance competition]]s around Sweden. In order to see dance competitions one can view the eventcalendar on the Swedish Dancesport Federation's [[webpage]]. The dance couples is divided into several age groups (children, youth, junior, main and senior), and in different classes (A, B, C, D, and E), where A is the highest level (elite). On dance competitions in Sweden all ages and a majority of the classes often occur. Common is however, that dance competitions are separate for Line dance, Ballroom dances and BRR-dances. District championships and Swedish championships are arranged annually in all [[List of DanceSport dances|dances]], as well as Swedish Championships for danceclubs (teams).

International dance competitions like Nordic championships is also arranged annually between the Nordic countries, beside European championships and World championships in all dancesport styles, where Sweden are represented by the [[national team]] in BRR dances and the national team in Tendance. National team in Line dance is not yet appointed. One annually reappeared world ranking competition, Gothenburg International, with top-ranked dance couples participating from all over the world in Ballroom dance and Latin, is also arranged in Sweden.

The Swedish Dancesport Federation administers the following dance styles:

'''[[BRR dances|BRR]]''' - [[Lindy Hop]], [[Boogie-woogie (dance)|Boogie Woogie]], [[Rock and Roll (dance)|Rock'n'Roll]], [[Bugg]], [[Double bugg]]

'''[[Ballroom dancing|Ballroom]]''' (Tendance) - [[Latin dance|Latin]], [[International Standard (dance)|Standard]]

'''[[Line dance]]'''

'''[[Formation dance]]'''

"'''Talk About the Passion'''" is a song by the American [[alternative rock]] band [[R.E.M.]], released as the second single released from its debut album ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'' in 1983. It was released in Europe only, on [[12"]] vinyl. This song failed to follow up on the success of "[[Radio Free Europe (song)|Radio Free Europe]]" released earlier in the year, as it did not chart. A live performance at [[Larry's Hideaway]], [[Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]], from July 9, 1983 was released on the 2008 Deluxe Edition reissue of Murmur.

"Talk About the Passion" is a "hunger song", although the only direct reference in the song is to "empty mouths".  [[Michael Stipe]] has stated, "Talk About the Passion" was a song about hunger but the lyrics weren't clear enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Bowler | first =Dave |author2=Dray, Bryan  | title =R.E.M.

The song contains a line in [[French language|French]]—"Combien de temps?", which means "How much time?" or "For how long?" The song also includes the line "Combien reaction?", which is a blend of English and French that can be taken to mean, "How much reaction?"

The song was included on R.E.M.'s first [[I.R.S. Records]] greatest hits album, ''[[Eponymous (album)|Eponymous]]'', and released as the only single from that album in 1988.

The '''Arriaga antzokia''' in Basque or '''Teatro Arriaga''' in Spanish is an [[opera house]] in [[Bilbao]], [[Spain]]. It was built in [[Neo-baroque]] style by architect [[Joaquín Rucoba]] in 1890, the same architect that built the [[Bilbao City Hall|city hall]]. It is named after [[Juan Crisóstomo Arriaga|Juan Crisóstomo de Arriaga]], known in his time as the "Spanish Mozart".

The theater was rebuilt in 1985 after severe flooding destroyed it in August 1983.

'''''The Third Eye''''' is a book published by [[Harvill Secker|Secker &amp; Warburg]] in November 1956. It was originally claimed that the book was written by a [[Tibet]]an monk named [[Lobsang Rampa]]. On investigation the author was found to be a British plumber named Cyril Henry Hoskin (1910-1981), who claimed that his body was occupied by the [[spirit]] of a [[Tibet]]an monk named Tuesday Lobsang Rampa. The book is considered a [[hoax]].&lt;ref&gt;Yapp, Nick. (1993). ''Hoaxers and Their Victims''. Robson. pp. 140-166. {{ISBN|978-0860517818}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dodin, Thierry. (1996). ''Imagining Tibet: Perceptions, Projections, and Fantasies''. Wisdom Publications. pp. 196-200. {{ISBN|978-0861711918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

The story of ''The Third Eye'' begins in Tibet during the reign of the [[13th Dalai Lama]]. Tuesday Lobsang Rampa, the son of a [[Lhasa]] aristocrat, takes up theological studies and is soon recognised for his prodigious abilities. As he enters adolescence, the young Rampa undertakes increasingly challenging feats until he is recognised as a crucial asset to the future of an independent Tibet. Tibet's [[Lama]]s had foretold a future in which China would attempt to reassert its authority, and Rampa is operated upon to help him preserve his country. A [[third eye]] is drilled into his forehead, allowing him to see human [[aura (paranormal)|auras]] and to determine people's hidden motivations.

With his third eye, Rampa can serve as an aide in the Dalai Lama's court and spy on visitors to the court as they are being received. The visitors upon whom Rampa spies include the scholar Sir Charles Alfred Bell, deemed by Rampa as naive but benevolent. In contrast, Rampa and others are certain that Chinese visitors are nefarious and are soon to attempt to bring conquest and destruction to Tibet. Tibet must then prepare for an invasion. During the story, Rampa meets [[yeti]]s, and at the end of the book he encounters a mummified body that was him in an earlier incarnation.  He also takes part in an initiation ceremony in which he learns that during its early history the planet Earth was struck by another planet, causing Tibet to become the mountain kingdom that it is today.  The popularity of the book led to two sequels, ''The Doctor from Lhasa'' and ''The Rampa Story'', and Lobsang Rampa wrote over a dozen books in all.

==Controversy==

Although it is claimed by the author to be an authentic autobiography of Rampa's education as a [[monk]] born in [[Tibet]], the book's emphasis on the [[occult]] made scholars doubtful about its origins. The book includes a description of a surgical operation similar to [[trepanation]] in which a [[third eye]] is drilled into the forehead of Rampa, allegedly in order to enhance his [[psychic]] powers. After the book became a bestseller, [[Heinrich Harrer]], explorer and Tibetologist, hired the private detective Clifford Burgess to investigate the background of the author.&lt;ref&gt;Tibballs, Geoff. (2006). ''The World's Greatest Hoaxes''. Barnes &amp; Noble. pp. 27-29. {{ISBN|978-0760782224}} "A number of Tibetan scholars, including explorer Heinrich Harrer who had personally tutored the Dalai Lama, remained convinced that the book was pure fiction, containing, as it did, certain statements inconsistent with Buddhist beliefs. So they hired private detective Clifford Burgess to delve into the background of Tuesday Lobsang Rampa. What Burgess came up with was Cyril Hoskins, a man who had never been anywhere near Tibet, had no real knowledge of the country's language or indeed of Buddhism and had certainly never had a hole drilled in his forehead. Any expertise had been gleaned from reading books in London libraries."&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1958 the results of the investigation were published in the ''[[Daily Mail]]''. The author of the book turned out to be a man named Cyril Henry Hoskin, who came from [[Plympton]] in [[Devon]] and was the son of a plumber.  Hoskin had never been to Tibet and spoke no Tibetan. When interviewed by the British press, Hoskin (who had legally changed his name to Carl Kuon So in 1948) admitted that he had written the book. He claimed in his 1960 book ''The Rampa Story'' that his body had been taken over by the Tibetan monk's [[spirit]] after falling out of an apple tree in the garden of his home. Hoskin always maintained that his books were true stories and denied any suggestions of a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Guinness Book of Fakes, Frauds and Forgeries |first= Richard |last= Newnham |year= 1991 |isbn= 0851129757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==
Although detractors regard the book as a myth of Cyril Hoskin's own creation, ''The Third Eye'' and its sequels remain the most popular publications claiming to represent life in Tibet.  The dismissal of the book as a fabrication by scholars did not undermine its popularity, despite the lack of records of Rampa ever having lived and its depiction of events that are not found in the standard literature describing life in a Tibetan monastery.

[[Gordon Stein]] in ''Encyclopedia of Hoaxes'' (1993) has written:

{{quote|When Tibetan Scholars examined ''The Third Eye'', they spotted a number of obvious errors. For example, the Tibetan highlands are not at 24,000 feet altitude, but rather at 14,000 feet... Also his statement that apprentices must memorize every page of the ''Kan-gyur'' (or ''Bkah Hygur'') to pass a test is false. Not only is this book of Buddhist Sutras not memorized, it is not even read by apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Stein|Stein, Gordon]]. (1993). ''Encyclopedia of Hoaxes''. Gale Group. pp. 5-6. {{ISBN|0-8103-8414-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5692">A '''tour manager''' (or '''concert tour manager''') is the person who helps to organize the administration for a schedule of appearances of a [[musical ensemble|musical group (band) or artist]] at a sequence of [[Music venue|venue]]s (a [[concert tour]]). In general, [[road manager]]s handle small to medium-sized tours, and tour managers are used on large-scale tours.

The performances on a concert tour are booked by the act’s [[Talent agent#Music agents|booking agent]], who works with [[Promoter (entertainment)|concert promoters]] to place the act in suitable venues and [[Music festival|festivals]] in a time frame and territory agreed with the act’s [[Talent manager|management]]. Individual concert promoters negotiate the financial, technical and hospitality requirements of the artist  and make an offer to the booking agent for the show. The tour is announced and tickets put on sale when agreement is reached on the tour dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waddell|last2=Barnet|last3=Berry|title=This Business of Concert Promotion and Touring: A Practical Guide to Creating, Selling, Organizing, and Staging Concerts|publisher=Billboard Books|location=New York|year=2007|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As modern concert touring involves complex financial, legal and technical arrangements, the booking agent or artist manager hire a concert tour manager to organize the logistics. Concert tour managers are usually [[freelancer]]s working on a tour-by-tour basis.

==Duties==

The tour manager is given the itinerary for the tour by the booking agent. Working from this itinerary, the tour manager handles the following activities.

===Financial===
The itinerary includes information about the potential ticket income (fees) for each show. Using this information the tour manager can produce a budget for the tour, calculating costs for crew wages, [[per diem]]s, accommodation, transport, sound, lighting and video equipment, visas and work permits, rehearsals and other expenses such as booking agent commissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|title=The Tour Book|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Boston|year=2007|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weekly reports are submitted to the business manager. Tour manager are on financial stabilities due to them being ahead of the whole tour.

===Advancing===
Advancing is the process of contacting each promoter and venue to ensure the entire [[Rider (theater)|artist's technical and hospitality demands]] (the ''rider'') are met and to resolve any problems the promoter or venue can foresee. The artist's rider covers catering, production (sound, lights, stagehands needed), security, general show, and legal issues. During the advancing process the tour manager checks contact names and addresses, arrival times, equipment load-in times, sound check and performance times, any supporting/opening acts, and live music curfews.

This information is collated into a "tour book" which is issued to the band and crew.

===On the road===
The tour manager travels with the band on the tour. The job on the road varies depending on the type and success level of the act. A tour manager's day-to-day workload can include:&lt;ref&gt;One for the Road: How to Be a Music Tour Manager by Mark Workman&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Women of Krusha e Madhe.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The Women of Krusha e Madhe "Drita e Krushes"]]

'''The Women of Krusha e Madhe''' ({{IPA|/ˈkruʃa e maðe/}}; {{lang-sq|Gratë e Krushës së Madhe}}; {{lang-sr|Жене у Великој Круши}}) are known as the Widowed Women of [[Kosovo]] because of the [[Massacre at Krusha e Madhe|massacre]] that occurred in their village. Throughout the dates 25, 26 and 27 of March in 1999 during the [[Kosovo War]], most of the men were killed from the [[Military of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav Army]]. The women and children fled [http://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=501645&amp;fid=3574&amp;c=kosovo Krushe e Madhe] and headed to the Albanian border. Once the war was over and they returned, their entire village was flat because all their houses, schools, etc. had been burned to the ground.

These women who were now the heads of households decided to change their fate and become the income generators of the village. Not only did they bring in money for their families, but also drastically developed Krusha and its economy. When they returned, they lived in extreme poverty and horrible living conditions but through opening small businesses and continuously expanding their market share, they managed to get out of it. Although this village still needs growth and improvement.&lt;ref name="Helvetas"&gt;[http://easterneurope.helvetas.org/en/projects/kosovo/rural_employment_kosovo/], Helvetas Swiss Intercooperation (2002)Skills for Rural Employment Kosovo&lt;/ref&gt;  Maximum dexterity has been given by the women towards trying to help their families have a better life and seeing the village’s economy thrive.

===Location and population===

Krusha e Madhe is located in the municipality of [[Orahovac|Rahovec]], Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mcgill.ca/trauma-globalhealth/notes/kosovoindependence], Bittersweet Celebrations in Kosovo Trauma and Global Health Program McGill University. (n.d.).&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be the second biggest village in Kosovo.
The population of Krusha e Madhe is estimated to be around 7,000 citizens.&lt;ref name="koha-net"&gt;[http://www.koha.net/arkiva/?page=1,3,102847 Krusha e Madhe themelon kooperativën bujqësore], Koha.NET - Arkivi. (n.d.).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economy ===

The agricultural areas of Krusha e Madhe are rich with an overall of 630 hectares of fertile land.&lt;ref name="koha-net" /&gt; The fertile lands of Krusha e Madhe impact the economy. More than 16 hectares of the land are used for planting different vegetables, including 6 hectares of peppers, 2 hectares of potatoes, 2 hectares of onions and cucumbers, and other vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazetatribuna.com/?FaqeID=6&amp;LajmID=12977], Gazeta Tribuna. (n.d.).&lt;/ref&gt; An agricultural cooperative is currently open, which is mostly renowned for processed vegetables. Through it, farmers aim to increase the market share of vegetables in Kosovo and in neighboring countries.&lt;ref name="koha-net" /&gt; In general, Kosovo is rich with fertile land in which different vegetables and fruits are cultivated. Thus, Kosovo tends to be a country with a variety of traditional recipes and common vegetables such as [[ajvar]], pickles, cheese and other dairy products. After the war and [[Massacre at Krusha e Madhe]] in 1999, the women of Krusha e Madhe formed multiple women’s associations and presented themselves to the marketplace by selling pickles alone at the beginning. Afterwards, they managed to expand their market share by opening micro-enterprises such as Apetiti, "Krushe" cooperative, and Drita e Krushes. These small businesses are supplied with processed vegetables and other traditional.

The people of Krusha e Madhe have witnessed one of the greatest war disasters of the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999. The interesting yet tragic fact about the [[Massacre at Krusha e Madhe]] is that most, if not all, of the men there were killed and most of their bodies have still not been found.&lt;ref name="HumanRights"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/Kosovo/Kosovo-Massacres4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607200233/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/Kosovo/Kosovo-Massacres4.htm |archivedate=2009-06-07 |df= }}, Human Rights Watch (1999). Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/Kosovo/Kosovo-Massacres4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607200233/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/Kosovo/Kosovo-Massacres4.htm |archivedate=2009-06-07 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War crimes===

The war in Krusha e Madhe is noted to be a massacre due to the population indictment against the [[Serbian Armed Forces|Serbian Military]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/kosovo/5084374/Kosovo-War-Thousands-killed-as-Serb-forces-tried-to-keep-control-of-province.html], Tweedie , N. (2009). Kosovo War.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1999, the village of Krusha e Madhe has been attacked by the Serbian armed forces and most of the territory was destroyed.  At first, it started with the residents of Krusha e Madhe being forced to leave their own village and once they did, the houses of these villagers were all burnt to their roots. The Serbian army ordered the male villagers to gather and line up. The men ranged from the age of 14 to 73.&lt;ref name="HumanRights" /&gt; Afterwards, their houses, personal documents, and valuables were burned. Most importantly, all of these men were Killed. Their families (women and children) were forced to leave the place and head to the forests near the village. Many immediately went in the direction of the country of [[Albania]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/354561.stm], BBC News (2001). Milosevic Indictment. Massacre at Krusha e Madhe&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casualties and missing people===

Two years after the devastation of the resident, there has been an exhibition held in Krusha e Madhe in which everything experienced from these villagers was presented. In this event, the massacre was being presented with different pictures, real skeletons, and executed bodies. There have been statistical data about this massacre and the overall number of these deaths throughout the dates 25, 26 and 27 March 1999. According to BBC news&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; approximately 105 Kosovo Albanian males were murdered by the Serbian Police and 793 houses were burned down. However, there are also a lot of people missing whose bodies were never found, so the number of casualties totals up to 241 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mcgill.ca/trauma-globalhealth/notes/kosovoindependence Bittersweet Celebrations in Kosovo], McGill University&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there were 8 massive graves, 2 crematoriums and many other individual graves.&lt;ref name="Historitetmerrit"&gt;[http://www.eastview.com/russian/books/product.asp?SKU=2134553B&amp;f_locale=&amp;active_tab=2], Gashi, S. (2001). Histori te tmerrit 1998 - 1999 : dosje krimesh te luftes, rrefime te grave.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, today there are 139 widows and approximately 500 children left as orphans.&lt;ref name="Historitetmerrit" /&gt;

Based on reports from [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and many other press accounts, Krusha e Madhe is considered to be one of the most damaged villages as a result of the 1999 war in Kosovo, and it is known to be the village of widowed women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/Under_Orders_En_Combined.pdf], Human Rights Watch. (2001). UNDER ORDERS War Crimes in Kosovo.&lt;/ref&gt; The women, in absence of their men, had to become the heads of households and protect their families. Years after the war, their houses were finally rebuilt, which was the first step towards recovery.&lt;ref name="Konushevci"&gt;[http://www.evropaelire.org/content/article/24922858.html Konushevci, A. (2013, March 8). Krushë: Lufta e gruas për të mbijetuar.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments and businesses==

After the war, some of the women of Krusha e Madhe established an association called “Widowed Women” (Grate e Veja) which initially wanted to focus on finding missing people from the region. After it received no attention or support, the women of the association decided to get to work and provide for their families. They started doing work that used to be done by the men like planting the soil and farming. The association quickly became well-known and was changed to the “Krusha” agricultural cooperative which sold vegetables and processed (canned) ones. As the requests multiplied, so did the number of workers and productions. There are currently around 25 women who work full-time with the help of almost a hundred others who contribute in different ways. Out of the 25 women, 23 of them are widows whose husbands are either missing or were killed during the Massacre of Krusha e Madhe. Today, the cooperative supplies 28 markets around Kosovo with different products that are based on traditional recipes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botasot.info/aktuale/214356/krushe-lufta-e-gruas-per-te-mbijetuar/], Bota Sot (2013, February 8) Lufta e gruas për të mbijetuar - Aktuale - Bota Sot&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although, even with the cooperative’s success, many of the families of Krusha still need social assistance to get by. This is mainly because the work they do is seasonal (when the crops grow). 
Women of Krusha e Madhe have changed their own fate. Before the women of this place changed the state of it and developed its economy, extreme poverty and horrible life conditions were the norm.  They gave their absolute maximum to help their families live a better, secure life.

The Rahovec municipality, [http://www.mbpzhr-ks.net/ Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Rural Development (MAFRD)], [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], and other sponsors, were all supporters of a workshop for farmers and the growing of their crops. Around €80,000 were invested in this workshop and 30 women of Krusha who are widows are hired full-time to work with the crops. The workshop's opening was on May 30, 2011 in Krusha e Madhe with various politicians and donors present.&lt;ref name="Rahovec"&gt;[http://kk.rks-gov.net/rahovec/Lajmet/Ne-Krushe-te-Madhe--u-hap-fabrika-per-perpunimin-e.aspx], Rahovec Municipality Webpage (2011, May 11) Në Krushë të Madhe u hap fabrika për përpunimin e perimeve&lt;/ref&gt; This investment in the village’s agriculture is considered to be one of the best initiatives by the MAFRD to help female farmers who suffered during the war provide a more secure future for their families. In this workshop, the village residents learn to take care of crops, use them to create final products, and then sell them in the markets. Before this project, the women of Krusha e Madhe worked by hand, but now, with donations from different organizations and ministries, they can work faster and more efficiently with the use of different machines.&lt;ref name="Rahovec"/&gt;  These investments are a huge success as Krusha e Madhe is a leader in the selling of vegetables like pickles, tomatoes, peppers, potatoes etc. It is also known for the production of [[ajvar]], a widely popular type of relish in Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Helvetas"/&gt; The opening of the new production line which included ajvar was made possible by additional donations from USAID and Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Rural Development (MAFRD).&lt;ref&gt;[http://oneworldsee.org/sq/content/realizimi-i-planeve-te-biznesit-fituesit-te-gares-biznes-planet-ne-prizren-dhe-gjakove], Dyrmishi E.

Purchases and sales presented in the following table (Table 1) describe the detailed flow of "Ola" Enterprise and women processors from Krushe. One can clearly see the usefulness of this type of business model since the gross profit justifies the investments made initially.

===Drita e Krushes===

In 1999, the women of Krusha e madhe were left without homes and with no source of income. One of the first initiatives to help these women was from Ms. Ola Syla,&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:zIMG9g6eivAJ:www.gtrc-rks.org/data/other/VLERAT%25C3%258BGRAVETKOSOV%25C3%258BS.pdf+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk, Vlera te Grave te Kosoves]&lt;/ref&gt; the founder and manager of an NGO called "Drita e Krushes"&lt;ref name="Drita"&gt;[http://www.undp.org/content/dam/kosovo/docs/womenPub/Enterpreneurs_W.pdf], UNDP, &amp; Women Business Association (2010). Women’s Entrepreneurship Report. Twins - Pristina.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Drita e Krushes" representatives traveled from Prishtina to Krusha e Madhe for many times ever since 1999, in order to help the women who were left widows after the massacre of Krusha.  At first, they had to set up a non-governmental organization (NGO) in which the assistance would be donations from different international organizations. These projects were donor drive since the women of Krusha e Madhe had no previous experience in entrepreneurship. With the aids given, the goods were initially transported from Krusha e Madhe to the citizens of Prishtina. For four years, the goods were ordered from familiar people of heads of the organization and it got popular in that manner. However, this way of exporting goods was not efficient enough. With the help of Swiss InterCoropration the women of Krusha were supplied with jars to use for the processed vegetables. They were placed on shelves in a store which was opened in Prishtina in 2001. At that period, the production of processed vegetables was promoted and once it started, the business had great success. First they started off with a small room where 20 employees were hired and only 300&amp;nbsp;kg of peppers were available. Looking at the fact that these were sold out very fast, the quantity of production had to increase. In 2002, the women participated in the AgroKos fair, which is an agricultural fair which aims to give farmers the opportunity to present their crops and products. For their traditional recipes, the women of Krusha won the gold medal.&lt;ref name="Drita"/&gt;

For seven years in a row, "Drita e Krushes" was the only business in Kosovo selling traditional products and processed vegetables which were made in rural areas. In 2004, the business which was opened in Prishtina expanded with a depot and a working space due to the funds collected from donations. In this year, the store had 300 women employed working on the products. The women received a wage monthly and this income was used in a very beneficial way to develop their lives.&lt;ref name="Drita"/&gt;

In the initial phases of “Drita e Krushes”, its representatives in association with Helvetas Swiss Intercooperation organized various informal trainings for the women in the organization. This skills development program in Krusha had three main intervention strategies: Opportunity Groups (learning groups), Private Sector training and Supply Chain linkages.&lt;ref name="Helvetas"/&gt; The trainings were very basic and tackled matters like sanitation maintenance, reading and writing, and working with the machines donated from the organizations mentioned above.&lt;ref name="Helvetas"/&gt; The purpose of all this is to deliver enhanced services to developing communities, unemployed people, and private, small businesses like those in Krusha e Madhe.

===“Grate e veja” (The Widowed Women)===

In 2005, Fahrije Hoti from Krusha e Madhe, whose husband is still on the missing persons list, initiated an organization called “Grate e Veja” (The widowed Women), to seek assistance on investigation of the missing persons. However, achieving minimal results on revealing the fate of missing persons, the women of Krusha e madhe had to get back to their primary duties such as nurturing their children, normalize their life and generate income. In the same year, they started operating under the name of the organization, planting and renewing their lands. Soon they started producing traditional recipes and conserving winter food. With the demands rising, this organization expanded its producing capacities and started hiring more women.&lt;ref name="Konushevci" /&gt; This was important because with the help of various organizations, families of Krusha e Madhe could live their lives again with better life conditions.

===Association of the Widowed Women “Krusha”===

In 2010, “Grate e veja” was transformed in the agricultural cooperative called “Krusha", an independent non-profit organization (NGO). Its profits and any other income generated are used to support those in financial need and further expand their NGO. The main offices of “Krusha” are located in the village of Krusha e Madhe and in the Municipality of Rahovec. The official representative of this organization is Fahrije Hoti and there are in overall five members that make up the organization’s board. In addition, “Krusha” has both permanent and seasonal workers.&lt;ref name="Hoti"&gt;[http://ruralgrant.kdc-kosova.org/mod2.php?bnr=1, Hoti, F. (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Agricultural Fields in Krusha e Madhe (Fushat Bujqesore ne Krushen e Madhe).jpg|thumb|Fields in Krusha e Madhe used to grow different crops and vegetables.]]

===The objectives of “Krusha”===

One of the primary goals of “Krusha” organization is to create the necessary conditions for the widowed women to run their businesses on their own. So far, positive results are seen regarding the development of women’s organizational and entrepreneurial skills. This has helped them to be engaged in cultivating their agricultural goods and be able to manage the economical as well as financial aspects of their businesses.&lt;ref name="Hoti"/&gt; One of the many projects of “Krusha” organization involved enabling women to receive driving licenses so that they would be more independent in terms of moving freely from the village to other business destinations. In addition, with the unique traditional recipe, this cooperative has managed to supply its products to approximately 28 markets in numerous cities of Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Hoti"/&gt;

The '''17th World Youth Day 2002''' (''WYD2002'') was a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] youth festival held July 23-July 28, 2002, in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]. [[World Youth Day]] is a celebration of faith begun by [[Pope]] [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] held on an international level every two to three years, and WYD2002 was the 10th such event.  Although WYD is designed for Catholics, it attracts sizable numbers of youths from other faiths and denominations and was presented as a multi-faith celebration of young people from all over the world.

As the event is ultimately an expression of faith, and a critical expression of faith is through service to others, World Youth Day 2002 had the support of some 25,000 volunteers; and some 100,000 pilgrims themselves spent three hours each on one of 750 service projects.

The groundswell of Catholic spirituality following World Youth Day 2002 in Canada led to the establishment of Canada's first national Catholic television network, [[Salt + Light Television]]. [[Thomas Rosica|Fr. Thomas Rosica]], who was the National Director of WYD2002, is also the founder and [[Chief Executive Officer]] of this new television station.

For the third time (after [[World Youth Day 1987|Buenos Aires 1987]] and [[World Youth Day|Denver 1993]]) the World Youth Day was celebrated in the [[Américas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aciprensa.com/noticias/la-jmj-vuelve-a-america-el-papa-francisco-hizo-anuncio-oficial-68464|title=VIDEO: ¡La JMJ vuelve a América!

The Chief Executive Officer and National Director of these WYD was Father [[Thomas Rosica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saltandlighttv.org/about/rosica.php?language=fr|title=Père Thomas M.

==The choice of Toronto by John Paul II==
The Pope announced the decision to organize the [[World Youth Day|WYD]] in Toronto during the Angelus of August 20, 2000 held on the large esplanade of Tor Vergata at the end of the [[World Youth Day 2000]]. These are his words:

"Before I dissolve this great and beautiful assembly, I wish to announce that the next World Youth Meeting will take place in Toronto, Canada, in the summer of the Duemilayue. As I now invite the young people of the world to walk towards that goal, I address a special greeting to the Canadian Delegation, who wanted to be present at this celebration to collect the delivery of the future commitment. On them and on the assignment I assume today I invoke the protection of the Blessed Virgin."

==Theme==

The theme of the event was a fragment from [[Jesus]]' speech on the [[Mount of Beatitudes]]:

"You are the salt of the earth ... you are the [[Light of the World|light of the world]]". ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:13-14).

Be yourself a shining example that leads many others to the kingdom of Christ, the kingdom of truth, justice and peace. "

Pope John Paul II

==Days in the Diocese==
{{Rquote|right|You are young, and the Pope is old, 82 or 83 years of life is not the same as 22 or 23. But the Pope still fully identifies with your hopes and aspirations... I have seen enough evidence to be unshakably convinced that no difficulty, no fear is so great that it can completely suffocate the hope that springs eternal in the hearts of the young. You are our hope, the young are our hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20020728_xvii-wyd_en.html|title=Apostolic Voyage to Toronto: Mass for the celebration of the 17th World Youth Day in Downsview Park, Toronto: Homily (July 28, 2002) - John Paul II|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Pope John Paul II]]}}It was also Pope John Paul II's last World Youth day.

World Youth Day 2002 solidified ''Days of the Diocese'', held in various dioceses - with the majority in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] and [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Ontario]] - as a major component leading up to the actual WYD Celebrations.

The scale is massive:  Days of the Diocese involved the participation of 35 of Canada's 72 dioceses. Events in various communities welcomed pilgrims from all over the world with music, prayers, and cathechetical sessions.

The week-long World Youth Day Celebrations involved the use of some 129 Catholic churches and 7 halls at Exhibition Place, 10 stages (as well as Downsview Park and 5 other parks in Toronto), 30 seminars, 10 prayer experiences, 300 vocational or service group exhibits, 10 cultural gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdp.ca/Downsview_Park_Remembers_Pope_John_Paul_II.1085.0.html|title=Memorial Garden at Downsview Park|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==John Paul II's Last WYD==
With deteriorating health, there was speculation that the Pope would not be able to attend the celebrations.

At his arrival address, he thanked the local, provincial, and federal levels of the Canadian government for supporting the idea of hosting WYD. He recalled his previous Apostolic Journeys to the country and acknowledged that he does not have the same physical strength he once had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2002/july/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20020723_wyd-arrival-toronto_en.html|title=Apostolic Voyage to Toronto: Welcome Ceremony - Lester B. Pearson International Airport, Toronto (July 23, 2002) - John Paul II|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope John Paul II participated by being present at all the major events of the week. While not being able to participate in person, he did view the Friday [[Stations of the Cross]] via television coverage by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]].&lt;ref name="WayoftheCross"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EWFlberUBM|title=WYD Toronto 2002 - Way of the Cross|first=|last=Salt and Light|date=2 August 2012|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He led the Saturday evening vigil and presided over the [[Holy Mass]] on the Sunday, delivering a homily which focused on entrusting the future of the Church to the youth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewtn.com/wyd2002/news_articles/wyd_numbers.htm ewtn.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theme song==

==Attendance and afterwards==
A crowd of over 800,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109032611/http://www.salesianos.org.py/noticias.php?id=188|title=Salesianos De Don Bosco|date=9 November 2011|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 850,000 youths from all over the world was in attendance for these events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/wyd2002/news_articles/wyd_numbers.htm|title=World Youth Day 2002- Toronto|website=www.ewtn.com|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a presence below expectations, mainly due to the international conflict that was shaken America and especially the [[United States]] for the attack of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]].

One of the results of the WYD on Canadian soil was the creation of [[Salt + Light Television]], a bilingual Catholic television network broadcast throughout the country that produces several original programs in both English and French. Father Thomas Rosica, who was the national [[Technical director|director]] of the [[World Youth Day]] 2002, is also the founder and [[Chief executive officer|executive officer]] of this television channel.
