'''''A Cat in the Brain''''' (Italian: '''''Un gatto nel cervello'''''; also known as '''''Nightmare Concert''''' and '''''I volti del terrore''''') is a 1990 Italian [[horror film|horror]] film written and directed by the "Italian godfather of gore" [[Lucio Fulci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2004/great-directors/fulci/ |title=Lucio Fulci |author=Patricia MacCormack |date=22 April 2004 |work=[[Senses of Cinema|sensesofcinema.com]] |accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Cat in the Brain'' is one of Lucio Fulci's final films and is notable for self-reflexively summing up his career. The film is a [[meta-film]] in which the director appears playing himself, a tortured horror filmmaker who is driven by the violent visions that he experiences both behind the camera and off the set.&lt;ref name="UK"/&gt; Feeling like he's losing his grip on reality and disturbed by murderous fantasies, Fulci consults a psychotherapist. The "shrink" exploits the director's vulnerabilities to his own murderous ends.&lt;ref name="Cinefantastique"&gt;[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2009/03/cat-in-the-brain-1990-dvd-review/ "Cat in the Brain (1990) - DVD Review" by Drew Fitzpatrick, Cinefanastique, March 31, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; 

''A Cat in the Brain'' has been called the horror film equivalent of [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[8½]]'', using cynical, [[Grand Guignol]] humour.&lt;ref name="Cinefantastique"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HorrorView"&gt;[http://www.horrorview.com/Reviews/C/Cat%20in%20the%20Brain%20Uncut.htm Horrorview: "Cat in the Brain" (UK release review)]&lt;/ref&gt; Juxtaposing gory horror clips from several of his own past horror films which he either directed and/or produced, Lucio Fulci shot a wrap-around segment featuring his own plot and used Vincenzo Tomassi's film editing (as well as his own voice over) to create the storyline – a personal insight into the effects of horror filmmaking on the psyche.&lt;ref name="UK"&gt;[http://www.thespinningimage.co.uk/cultfilms/displaycultfilm.asp?reviewid=579 The Spinning Image UK "Cat in the Brain" a review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SexGore"&gt;[http://www.sexgoremutants.co.uk/catbrain.html SexgoremutantsUK - "Cat in the Brain" (UK DVD review) by Alan Simpson]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

Haunted by his own bloody horror film visions and with news of real life murders happening in Rome, splatter [[film director]] Lucio Fulci (playing himself) seeks the advice of a [[psychiatrist]].&lt;ref name="UK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SexGore"/&gt;

Dr. [[Lucio Fulci]] (more or less playing himself) is a former medical doctor-turned director of gory horror films. He wraps up shooting for the day on his latest film 'Touch of Death' with Brett Halsey playing the human monster/cannibal of women. Fulci leaves the [[Cinecittà]] Studios for a local restaurant down the street. A young friendly waiter recognizes him and suggests his typical meal: a fillet of steak, or steak tartare. Fulci cannot look at the sample plates of meat without having flashbacks to the cannibalistic scene he'd been filming earlier. Shaken, he leaves the restaurant without ordering a meal. Later, while checking an effects shot from another movie, Fulci irritably snaps at a technician to get a plate of animal eyeballs out of his sight.

Returning home to his row house in an old suburb of Rome, the troubled director tries to sleep, but the noise of a handyman's chainsaw outside keeps him awake with recollections of his own recently shot chainsaw mayhem. In a rage, Fulci storms outside and smashes a hatchet into cans of paint belonging to the handyman. The spilled red paint reminds Fulci of the acid/blood scene in 'The Beyond'.

Fulci walks from his home and discovers that one of his neighbors is a psychiatrist. Meanwhile, Professor Egon Swharz (David L. Thompson) is arguing with his wife Katya (Melissa Lang). Their bitter routine row is interrupted by the intercom buzzing where his secretary Nurse Lilly (Judy Morrow) informing him of this latest walk-in. Professor Swharz walks in and accepts Fulci into his books for a session. After walking out of the reception area, Nurse Lilly immediately phones a friend saying "guess who just walked in as a patient!" Swhartz discusses Fulci's recent problems and suggests that he's "breaking down the barrier, the boundary between what you film and what's real."

The next day at Cinecittà, Fulci's producer Filippo (Shilett Angel) tells him that the pace has to be stepped up on filming. Fulci is revealed to making two films at the same time: 'The Touch of Death', and 'Ghosts of Sodom'. Robert Egon, the young actor playing the Nazi seducer in the later film, approaches Fulci in a corridor to discuss his role. "Your presence should make a deadly impression", says Fulci. "You are after all a symbol of death. And you've also the whole horror of the Nazis. Get me?" Fulci talks the actors through the seduction scene in 'Ghost of Sodom'. When the filming is done, Fulci staggers out into a corridor muttering, "Sadism, Nazism; is there any point any more?"

No sooner has Fulci left the set when his producer steers him into a studio suite for an interview with a Munich news crew. The sight of the tall, blond, German lady reporter's long legs triggers a vision of sexual abandon in Nazi Germany (from the film 'Ghosts of Sodom') When Fulci recovers from his vision, he finds himself outside again with his producer saying, "Lucio, you must stop! Stop, in the name of God!" Filippo informs the confused director that he has just run amuck, smashed the TV crews camera and tried to rip the interviewer's clothes off.

Professor Swharz calls Fulci for another consultation after he had watched all of his films. He suggests using hypnosis. Once Fulci is under, the Professor's true colors are revealed. He switches on a buzzer device and describes a mad scheme: "You'll do everything I tell you when you hear this sound. Your mind will make you live scenes you think are real. You will slowly be possessed by madness. You'll think you've committed terrible crimes." After the session is over, Fulci leaves unable to remember anything. Swharz then embarks on a killing spree, starting with the murder of a local prostitute that evening. Fulci arrives on the scene after the police show up and thinks he committed the murder. Running away, his car breaks down en route to a film location shoot. When he arrives at a cemetery where a nighttime Gothic scene is to be filmed, he finds that his assistant director, and Filippo his producer, have started filming without him.

Back home the following morning, Fulci tries to relax, but with each simple action, he is plagued by memories and visions of screen violence from his movies. Fleeing his house, he goes for a drive. But Swharz follows him and commits three more murders, first a couple in a remote boathouse, and the groundskeeper who witnesses him. Fulci arrives on the scene forcing Swharz to hide, and again Fulci thinks he committed the murders. Getting back into his car for a drive down a long country road, Fulci hallucinates about running over a tramp (from the movie 'Touch of Death'). After returning home, Fulci phones the police station to speak to his friend Inspector Gabrielli (Jeoffrey Kennedy) intending to make a "confession." But he learns that Gabrielli is on vacation.

After another visit to Professor Swharz is of little help to cure him of his waking nightmares, Fulci decides to drive over to Inspector Gabrielli's house in the hope of speaking to him. Swharz follows him there with the buzzer device. Fulci lets himself into his friend's house, and immediately suffers from visions of Gabrielle's family being stabbed, chainsawed, and decapitated. Fulci staggers outside to be greeted by the returning policeman, who reassures the flaky director that his family are safely on holiday in Sardinia. When Fulci expresses his visions to Gabrielli and that he may have killed some people, the cheerful police detective responds, "If you're trying to create a sensation like you do in your films, this time you've goofed."

Meanwhile, Professor Swharz can stand no more of his wife's bland contempt for him and his practice. So, the insane psychiatrist strangles her to death by ripping out a wire from his wife's piano and nearly decapitates her with it. Swharz then heads out again to tail Fulci, who under the influence of hypnosis again, suffers through one more blast of violent imagery and faints in the middle of a field. He comes round the next morning to discover a cat digging up the loosely buried remains of another Swharz victim. As Fulci scrapes soil from the dead features, Inspector Gabrielli appears behind him. Before Fulci can protest his innocence, Gabrielli informs him that Swharz has been shot dead by his men who were tailing Fulci which he ordered after their conversation the previous day, who caught the mad psychiatrist in the act.

Several months later, Fulci and the beautiful Nurse Lilly sail on his sailboat, 'Perversion' (named from his first thriller movie). Fulci looks furtively around and follows the young woman into the cabin-quarters. Suddenly, the sound of a chainsaw revs up, followed by her terrified screams. Fulci emerges from the cabin a minute later with a basket of her body parts and attaches the severed fingers onto fishing hooks which he casually casts into the water. Just when it appears that Fulci is really a crazed killer after all, it is revealed that this 'killing' is the very last shot of his newest film, 'Nightmare Concert', captured by a film crew sailing alongside. Bidding goodbye to his colleagues, Fulci happily sails out of the harbor with his very-much alive leading lady. (An alternate version features a bloodcurdling scream dubbed onto the soundtrack from below deck after Fulci and the girl sail away from the dock, hinting that Fulci really ''was'' a maniacal killer.)

== Production ==
{{expand section|date=June 2018}}
The film was composed almost entirely in post-production, assembled from clips from Lucio Fulci's past horror films. The wrap-around segments featuring Lucio Fulci were largely shot in and around Rome's famous [[Cinecittà Studios]], home of master Italian filmmaker [[Federico Fellini]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;br&gt;
The film has two different endings, depending on what country it is being shown in. &lt;br&gt;
Brett Halsey said in an interview that he didn't even know he was in the film until quite some time after the film was released. Fulci had used clips of Halsey from an earlier film ''Touch of Death'' without ever notifying Halsey. Halsey said it kind of spoiled his previously good relationship with Fulci, because he felt that Fulci should've paid him something for doing that, even if it was just a small token payment.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was written in response to two letters sent by Das, seeking support from the famous [[Russians|Russian]] author and thinker for India's independence from British colonial rule. The letter was published in the Indian newspaper ''[[Free Hindustan]]''.  The letter caused the young [[Mohandas Gandhi]] to write to the world-famous Tolstoy to ask for advice and for permission to reprint the ''Letter'' in Gandhi's own South African newspaper, ''[[Indian Opinion]]'', in 1909. Mohandas Gandhi was stationed in South Africa at the time and just beginning his lifelong activist career. He then translated the letter himself, from the original English copy sent to India, into his native [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]].&lt;ref name=gandhi/&gt;

In "A Letter to a Hindu", Tolstoy argued that only through the principle of love could the Indian people free themselves from colonial British rule. Tolstoy saw the law of love espoused in all the world's religions, and he argued that the individual, [[nonviolent]] application of the law of love in the form of [[protests]], [[Strike action|strikes]], and other forms of peaceful resistance were the only alternative to violent revolution. These ideas ultimately proved to be successful in 1947 in the culmination of the [[Indian Independence Movement]].

In this letter, Tolstoy mentions the works of [[Swami Vivekananda]]. This letter, along with Tolstoy's views, preaching, and his book ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'', helped to form Mohandas Gandhi's views about nonviolent resistance.&lt;ref name=gandhi/&gt;

The letter introduced Gandhi to the ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]] moral literature, the [[Tirukkuṛaḷ]], which Tolstoy referred to as the [[Hindu language|Hindu]] Kural.&lt;ref name="tirukkuṛaḷ"&gt;{{cite web

'''Abdul-Rahman bin Nasir al-Barrak''' ({{lang-ar|عبد الرحمن بن ناصر البراك}}, born 1933 or 1934&lt;ref&gt;[http://albarrak.islamlight.net/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1364&amp;Itemid=45, "About Sheikh", Hijri calendar birthdate 1352] albarrak.islamlight.net&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Saudi]] [[Salafi]] cleric. 

In 1994, al-Barrak and other Saudi clerics were mentioned by name and praised by [[Osama bin Laden]] for opposing then-[[Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia|Grand Mufti]] [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz]] in his [[s:Open Letter to Shaykh Bin Baz on the Invalidity of his Fatwa on Peace with the Jews|Open Letter to Shaykh Bin Baz on the Invalidity of his Fatwa on Peace with the Jews]].

==Fatwas==

Al-Barrak has drawn attention for issuing controversial [[fatwa]]s, or religious edicts. One such fatwa called for strict [[gender segregation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-46408620100223?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true Saudi cleric backs gender segregation with fatwa], Reuters, 2010-02-23&lt;/ref&gt;  The fatwa states, "Whoever allows this mixing ... allows forbidden things, and whoever allows them is a [[kafir]] and this means defection from Islam ... Either he retracts or he must be killed ... because he disavows and does not observe the [[Sharia]]."

In March 2008, al-Barrak issued a fatwa that two writers for the newspaper ''[[Al Riyadh (newspaper)|Al Riyadh]]'', Abdullah bin Bejad al-Otaibi and Yousef Aba al-Khail, should be tried for [[apostasy]] for their "heretical articles" regarding the categorization of "unbelievers" and put to death if they did not repent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL15492468, Top Saudi cleric calls for writers' deaths] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002631/https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL15492468%2C |date=2016-03-04 }} Reuters, 2008-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Act of Abjuration''' ({{lang-nl|Plakkaat van Verlatinghe}}, literally 'placard of [[wikt:abjuration|abjuration]]') is the [[declaration of independence]] by many of the [[provinces of the Netherlands]] from the allegiance to [[Philip II of Spain]], during the [[Dutch Revolt]].

Signed on 26 July 1581 in [[The Hague]], the Act formally confirmed a decision made by the [[States General of the Netherlands]] in [[Antwerp]] four days earlier. It declared that all magistrates in the provinces making up the [[Union of Utrecht]] were freed from their oaths of allegiance to their lord, Philip, who was also King of Spain. The grounds given were that Philip had failed in his obligations to his subjects, by oppressing them and violating their ancient rights (an early form of [[social contract]]). Philip was therefore considered to have forfeited his thrones as ruler of each of the provinces which signed the Act.

The Act of Abjuration allowed the newly-independent territories to govern themselves, although they first offered their thrones to alternative candidates. When this failed in 1587 by, among other things, the Deduction of [[François Vranck]] the provinces became a republic in 1588.

During that period the largest parts of Flanders and Brabant and a small part of Gelre were recaptured by Spain. The partial recapture of these areas to Spain led to the creation of Staats-Vlaanderen, Staats-Brabant, Staats-Overmaas and Spaans Gelre.

==Background==
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2016}}
[[File:Map Union of Arras and Utrecht 1579-en.svg|thumb|left|The Union of Utrecht]]
The [[Seventeen Provinces]] of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] were united in a personal union by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain Charles V]] with the incorporation of the duchy of [[Guelders]] in his Burgundian territories in 1544. They were constituted as a separate entity with his [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]]. His son, King [[Philip II of Spain]], inherited these provinces on Charles' abdication in 1555. But this actually meant that he assumed the feudal title of each individual province, as [[Duchy of Brabant|Duke of Brabant]], [[County of Holland|Count of Holland]] etc. There never was a single, unified state of the Netherlands, though the  provinces were all represented in the [[States General of the Netherlands]], since the Great Charter or Privilege of [[Mary of Burgundy]] of 10 February 1477.

In the [[Dutch Revolt]], from 1568 several of these provinces rose in rebellion against Philip. At first they pretended just to have revolted against his [[viceroy]]s, successively [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|the Duke of Alba]], [[Luis de Zúñiga y Requesens]], [[John of Austria]], and [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|the Duke of Parma]], while the [[stadtholder]]s appointed by the provincial estates continued to pretend they represented Philip. This pretence was wearing thin, however, by the  time of the [[Pacification of Ghent]] in 1576. When Don Juan attacked Antwerp and Namur in 1577, the States General, as the provincial estates did with the non-royalist stadtholders, appointed [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Matthias]], Philip's nephew, as viceroy, without Philip's consent.&lt;ref group=note&gt;There were now two competing viceroys, therefore, whose writ was only recognised in the provinces they controlled.&lt;/ref&gt; Matthias was young and inexperienced, and brought no resources of his own to the battle with Philip. This became a serious problem, after the Duke of Parma started to make serious inroads against the tenuous unity of the Pacification with his [[Union of Arras]] of a number of southern Provinces, which the rebellious northern provinces answered with their own [[Union of Utrecht]], both in 1579. Each union formed its own Estates General. [[William the Silent]], the leader of the Dutch Revolt, therefore decided that the rebellious Netherlands should look for an overlord who could bring useful foreign allies. [[Francis, Duke of Anjou]], the younger brother and heir-presumptive of King [[Henry III of France]], was such a man. He did not wish to be someone else's viceroy, especially not of the Habsburg king. The rebel States General therefore offered him the sovereignty of the Netherlands, which he accepted by the [[Treaty of Plessis-les-Tours]]. (Holland and Zeeland did not join in the offer.) Meanwhile, Matthias was bought off with a generous annuity.

==Act of Abjuration==
[[File:SA 4911-Anno 1581. De afzwering van Filips II.jpg|thumb|300px|The signing of the Act in a 19th-century painting]]
This, however, presented a problem: the magistrates of the cities and rural areas, and the provincial states themselves, had sworn allegiance to Philip. Oaths of allegiance were taken very seriously during this era. As long as the conflict with Philip could be glossed over these magistrates could pretend to remain loyal to the king, but if a new sovereign was recognised, they had to make a choice. The rebellious States General decided on 14 June 1581 to officially declare the throne vacant,&lt;ref name="gachard-388"&gt;Gachard, p. 388{{fcn|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of Philip's behaviour, hence the Dutch name for the Act of [[Abjuration]]: "Plakkaat van Verlatinghe", which may be translated as "Placard&lt;ref group=note&gt;The States General published their Acts by hanging them up in public places as placards. The name for the means of publication became commingled with the name for the Act itself.&lt;/ref&gt; of Desertion." This referred not to desertion of Philip by his subjects, but rather, to a suggested desertion of the Dutch "flock" by their malevolent "shepherd," Philip.

A committee of four members – Andries Hessels, ''greffier'' (secretary) of the [[States of Brabant]]; Jacques Tayaert, [[pensionary]] of the city of [[Ghent]]; Jacob Valcke, pensionary of the city of Ter Goes (now [[Goes]]); and Pieter van Dieven (also known as Petrus Divaeus), pensionary of the city of [[Mechelen]] – was charged with drafting what was to become the Act of Abjuration.&lt;ref name="gachard-388" /&gt; The Act prohibited the use of the name and seal of Philip in all legal matters, and of his name or arms in minting coins. It gave authority to the Councils of the provinces to henceforth issue the commissions of magistrates. The Act relieved all magistrates of their previous oaths of allegiance to Philip, and prescribed a new oath of allegiance to the States of the province in which they served, according to a form prescribed by the States General.&lt;ref group=note&gt;A close reading of the text of the Act does not show an actual "Oath of [[Abjuration]]" as one would expect from the sometimes used English expression for the Act; cf. the text of the Act in any of the external links.&lt;/ref&gt; The actual draft seems to have been written by an ''audiencier''&lt;ref group=note&gt;The official who received petitions to the States General and drafted its Placards.&lt;/ref&gt; of the States General, Jan van Asseliers.&lt;ref&gt;Gachard, p. 590; however, see Martin van Gelderen, ''The Political Thought of the Dutch Revolt, 1555–1590'', 1992 Cambridge University Press,  p. 150, fn. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was remarkable for its extensive Preamble, which took the form of an ideological justification, phrased as an indictment (a detailed list of grievances) of King Philip. This form, to which the [[American Declaration of Independence]] bears striking resemblance, has given rise to speculations that [[Thomas Jefferson]], when he was writing the latter, was at least partly inspired by the Act of Abjuration.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Lucas, "The 'Plakkaat van Verlatinge': A Neglected Model for the American Declaration of Independence", in Rosemarijn Hofte and Johanna C. Kardux, eds., ''Connecting Cultures: The Netherlands in Five Centuries of Transatlantic Exchange'' (Amsterdam, 1994), 189–207.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "UWM06291998"&gt;{{cite news|author=Barbara Wolff |title=Was Declaration of Independence inspired by Dutch? |url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/3049 |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] |date=1998-06-29 |accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Preamble was based on ''[[Vindiciae contra tyrannos]]'' by [[Philippe de Mornay]], and other works of [[monarchomachs]] may have been sources of inspiration also.&lt;ref&gt;Ger van der Tang, ''Grondwetsbegrip en grondwetsidee: Notion Et Idee de Constitution'', 1998 Kluwer, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The rebels, in their appeal to public opinion, may have thought it more important to quote "authoritative" sources and refer to "ancient rights" they wished to defend. By deposing a ruler for having violated the [[social contract]] with his subjects, they were the first to apply these theoretical ideas. Historian [[Pieter Geyl]] described the Act of Abjuration as a "rather splendid, albeit late, expression of the sturdy medieval tradition of liberty," and noted that while the principles expressed in the act were derived from [[Calvinism]], the document lacked a purely religious argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Geyl |first=Pieter |authorlink=Pieter Geyl |date=1959 |title=Geschiedenis van de Nederlandse stam |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/geyl001gesc01_01/geyl001gesc01_01_0017.php |page=272 |accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order of appearance, these provinces are mentioned in the declaration: the Duchies of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Guelders]], the Counties of [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[County of Holland|Holland]] and [[County of Zeeland|Zeeland]], and the Lordships of [[Lordship of Frisia|Frisia]], [[Lordship of Mechelen|Mechelen]] and [[Lordship of Utrecht|Utrecht]]. The provinces of [[Lordship of Overijssel|Overijssel]] (which included [[County of Drenthe|Drenthe]]) and [[Lordship of Groningen|Groningen]] also seceded but are not separately mentioned as they strictly speaking were not separate entities but parts of Utrecht and Guelders, respectively. Large parts of Flanders and Brabant were later occupied again by the Spanish king.

==Aftermath==
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2016}}
Many magistrates refused to take the new oath and preferred to resign from their offices. The Act therefore had the consequence of bringing about a wholesale change in the political makeup of many rebellious cities in the Netherlands, strengthening the radicals. Philip, of course, did not recognise the Act, nor the sovereignty of the Duke of Anjou.&lt;ref group=note&gt;He was quick to react to the affront by outlawing William of Orange and putting a price on his head&lt;/ref&gt; The Duke himself was not satisfied with his limited powers and he made an attempt to subjugate a number of cities, including Antwerp; the latter instead attacked his forces in what became known as the [[French Fury]]. This caused the States General to start looking for a different sovereign. After a first attempt to interest [[Elizabeth I of England]] in assuming sovereignty did not succeed, [[William the Silent]] was asked to assume the "vacant" title of Count of Holland, but he was assassinated in 1584, before the arrangements could be finalised. After the [[Treaty of Nonsuch]] Elizabeth agreed to send aid to the Dutch rebels after all, though without assuming sovereignty. Under the provisions of the treaty, [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]] was appointed Governor-General of the Netherlands. However, like the "reign" of the Duke of Anjou, this proved to be a disappointment. After Leicester's departure in 1587 the States General decided to assume sovereignty themselves, thereby making the seven&lt;ref group=note&gt;By this time the reconquest of the Southern Netherlands by the Duke of Parma had removed Flanders, Mechelen, and Brabant as members of the northern Union.&lt;/ref&gt; United Provinces a republic.

'''Alcatraz Library''' was a [[library]] for inmates at [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]]. It was located at the end of D-Block. On entering Alcatraz, every inmate received a library card&lt;ref name="MacDonaldNadel2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Donald|last2=Nadel|first2=Ira|title=Alcatraz: History and Design of a Landmark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wfQWSJLKXdoC&amp;pg=PA52|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=15 February 2012|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=978-1-4521-0153-8|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a catalog of books found in the library.

Other authors include [[Jack London]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Washington Irving]], [[Zane Grey]], [[Hamilton Garland]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], [[Daniel Defoe]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Cervantes]] and magazines such as ''[[Adventure to Time]]'', ''[[Better Homes and Gardens (magazine)|Better Homes and Gardens]]'' and ''[[Library Digest]]''.&lt;ref name="AH30"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/rock/rock-030.htm|title=For Desperate or Irredeemable Types United States Federal Penitentiary Alcatraz|publisher=A History of Alcatraz Island, 1847-1972, Historic Resources Study|accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A law library was later added to A-Block.&lt;ref name="A101"/&gt;

The '''Alliance of European National Movements''' ('''AENM''') is a [[European political party]] that was formed in [[Budapest]] on 24 October 2009 by a number of [[ultranationalist]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] parties from countries in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Far-right European parties forge alliance | url = http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/politics-parties.13f | website = eubusiness.com | date = 2009-10-25 | quote=A handful of European nationalist political parties have formed an alliance to represent them in Brussels... ... Negotiations are underway with like-minded Austrian, British, Spanish and Portuguese parties. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AENM's founding members were [[Jobbik]] (the alliance was established during their sixth party congress), France's [[National Front (France)|National Front]], Italy's [[Tricolour Flame]], Sweden's [[National Democrats (Sweden)|National Democrats]] and Belgium's [[National Front (Belgium)|National Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = European nationalist parties form alliance | url = http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1090191&amp;lang=eng_news | publisher = [[Taiwan News]] (source: [[Associated Press]]) | date = 2009-10-24 | quote =Hungary's Jobbik, France's National Front, Italy's Three-Color Flame, Sweden's National Democrats and Belgium's National Front formed the Alliance of European National Movements on Saturday and say they expect parties from Britain, Austria, Spain and Portugal to join them soon.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2011, [[Marine Le Pen]], the new French National Front leader, resigned from AENM and joined the [[European Alliance for Freedom]] (EAF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontnational.com/2012/01/marine-le-pen-en-autriche/|title=Marine Le Pen en Autriche|work=Front National|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Jobbik has cut all its affiliation with AENM and the president of AENM [[Béla Kovács (politician, 1960)|Béla Kovács]] left Jobbik.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jobbik.com/statement_of_jobbik_on_aenm|title=Statement of Jobbik on AENM|date=2018-02-20|work=jobbik.com|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In November 2009, the [[British National Party]] claimed that AENM had been extended to nine parties,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = BNP in alliance with nationalists | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8356284.stm | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 2009-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this information was not confirmed by AENM President [[Bruno Gollnisch]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="Bruno Gollnisch"/&gt;

At a press conference held in Strasbourg on 16 June 2010, the political leadership of AENM was confirmed as follows: President [[Bruno Gollnisch]], Vice President [[Nick Griffin]], Treasurer [[Béla Kovács (politician, 1960)|Béla Kovács]] and Secretary General Valerio Cignetti.&lt;ref name="9PartiesBNP"&gt;[http://www.bnp.org.uk/news/alliance-european-national-movements-expands-9-parties "Alliance of European National Movements Expands to 9 Parties,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019193441/http://www.bnp.org.uk/news/alliance-european-national-movements-expands-9-parties |date=2013-10-19 }} British National Party.

At the end of 2011 the [[National Rally (France)|National Front]] withdrew from AENM and joined the [[European Alliance for Freedom]]. However, Gollnisch an Jean-Marie Le Pen maintained their position in the organisation.

In October 2013, Marine Le Pen requested that Gollnisch and Jean-Marie Le Pen leave their positions in the AENM in order to join the more moderate EAF and so unify the French National Front under the EAF banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/10400740/Frances-FN-to-team-up-with-other-far-Right-parties-for-European-elections.html|title=France's FN to team up with other far Right parties for European elections|date=23 October 2013|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine Le Pen has tried to "de-demonize" the party, i.e. to give it a more acceptable image. Cooperation with the openly racist and antisemitic parties present in AENM was seen as contradictory to these aims. On November 7, the two declared they have followed the request and left AENM. This also meant the end of Gollnisch's term as the AENM's chairman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtl.fr/actualites/info/politique/article/fn-jean-marie-le-pen-obeit-a-sa-fille-et-quitte-le-parti-pan-europeen-7766551739|title=FN : Jean-Marie Le Pen "obéit" à sa fille et quitte le parti pan-européen|work=RTL.fr|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a place occupied by Béla Kovács since January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribunadeeuropa.com/?p=18105 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108211726/http://www.tribunadeeuropa.com/?p=18105 |archivedate=2014-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 2013, Svoboda lost its observer status after a conflict with other member groups over its policies towards ethnic minorities in the West of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The old and new European friends of Ukraine’s far-right Svoboda party  | url = https://www.academia.edu/4402918/The_old_and_new_European_friends_of_Ukraine_s_far-right_Svoboda_party  | website = searchlightmagazine.com | date = 2013-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Svoboda maintained its informal affiliation with the group until March 2014, when it announced its withdrawal of its observer status from AENM citing several members of the alliance making "statements supporting the Russian sponsored separatist forces and support for the Russian Armed Forces occupation of Ukrainian territory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.svoboda.org.ua/news/events/00010596/|title=Oleh Tiahnybok withdraws Svoboda's membership within the Alliance of European National Movements|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Béla Kovács, leader of the alliance, had served as an observer at the [[Donbass parliamentary elections, 2014|2014 Donbass parliamentary election]].

In [[parapsychology]], an '''apparitional experience''' is an anomalous  experience characterized by the apparent perception of either a living being or an inanimate object without there being any material stimulus for such a perception. The person experiencing the apparition is awake, excluding [[dream]] visions from consideration.

In academic discussion, the term "apparitional experience" is to be preferred to the term "[[ghost]]" in respect of the following points:
# The term ghost implies that some element of the human being survives death and, at least under certain circumstances, can make itself perceptible to living human beings. There are other competing explanations of apparitional experiences.
# Firsthand accounts of apparitional experiences differ in many respects from their fictional counterparts in literary or traditional [[Ghost story|ghost stories]] and [[List of ghost films|films]] (see below).
# The content of apparitional experiences includes living beings, both human and animal, and even inanimate objects.{{sfn|Bennett|1939}}

== History of the concept ==

Attempts to apply modern scientific or investigative standards to the study of apparitional experiences began with the work of [[Edmund Gurney]], [[Frederic W. H. Myers]] and [[Frank Podmore]],&lt;ref&gt;Gurney, E., Myers, F.W.H. and Podmore, F. (1886). ''Phantasms of the Living'', Vols. I and II. London: Trubner and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; who were leading figures in the early years of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (founded in 1882).  Their motive, as with most of the early work of the Society,&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick, Eleanor; Johnson, Alice; and others (1894). Report on the Census  of Hallucinations,  London: ''Proceedings of the Society  for Psychical Research'', Vol. X.&lt;/ref&gt; was to provide evidence for human survival after death.  For this reason they had a particular interest in what are known as ‘crisis cases’.  These are cases in which a person reports having a hallucinatory experience, visual or otherwise, which apparently represents someone at a distance, this experience subsequently being considered to have coincided with that person’s death, or a significant life event of some kind.  If the temporal coincidence of the crisis and the distant apparitional experience cannot be explained by any conventional means, then in [[parapsychology]] the presumption is made that some as yet unknown form of communication, such as [[telepathy]] (a term coined by Myers&lt;ref&gt;Myers, F.W.H. (1903). ''Human Personality and its Survival of Bodily Death''. London: Longmans Green. Reissued: Charlottesville, VA: Hampton Roads, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;) has taken place.

While it may be said that the work of Gurney and his colleagues failed to provide convincing evidence for either telepathy or survival of death, the large collection of firsthand written accounts which resulted from their methods may nevertheless be regarded as providing a valuable body of data concerning the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[hallucinations in the sane]].

A notable later discussion of apparitional experiences was that of [[G. N. M. Tyrrell]],{{sfn|Tyrell|Price|1943}} also a leading member of the Society for Psychical Research of his day.  Tyrrell accepted the hallucinatory character of the experience, pointing out that it is virtually unknown for firsthand accounts to claim that apparitional figures leave any of the normal physical effects, such as footprints in snow, that one would expect of a real person.{{sfn|Tyrell|Price|1943|pp=53—60}}  However, Tyrrell develops the idea that the apparition may be a way for the unconscious part of the mind to bring to consciousness information that has been paranormally acquired – in crisis cases, for example.  He introduces an evocative metaphor of a mental ‘stage-carpenter’,{{sfn|Tyrell|Price|1943|pp=101—103}} behind the scenes in the unconscious part of the mind, and constructing the quasi-perceptual experience that eventually appears on the stage of consciousness, so that it embodies paranormal information in a symbolic way, a person drowning at a distance appearing soaked in water, for example.

The study and discussion of apparitions developed in a different direction in the 1970s, with the work of [[Celia Green]] and [[Charles McCreery]].{{sfn|Green|McCreery|1975}} They were not primarily interested in the question of whether apparitions could shed any light on the existence or otherwise of telepathy, or in the survival question; instead they were concerned to analyse a large number of cases with a view to providing a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of the different types of experience, viewed simply as a type of anomalous perceptual experience or [[hallucination]].

One of the points that was highlighted by their work was point (2) listed above, namely that ‘real-life’ accounts of apparitional experiences differ markedly from the traditional or literary ghost story. These are some of the more notable differences, at least as indicated by their own collection of 1800 firsthand accounts:

* Subjects of apparitional experiences are by no means always frightened by the experience; indeed they may find them soothing or reassuring at times of crisis or ongoing stress in their lives.{{sfn|Green|McCreery|1975|pp=200—203}}
* Spontaneous apparitional experiences tend to happen in humdrum or everyday surroundings, and under conditions of low central nervous system arousal, most often in the subject’s own home - while doing housework, for example.  By contrast, subjects who visit reputedly haunted locations in hopes of ‘seeing a ghost’ are more often than not disappointed.{{sfn|Green|McCreery|1975|p=123}}
* Apparitions tend to be reported as appearing solid and not transparent; indeed they may be so realistic in a variety of ways as to deceive the percipient as to their hallucinatory nature; in some cases the subject only achieves insight after the experience has ended.{{sfn|Green|McCreery|1975|pp=150—155}}
* It is unusual for an apparitional figure to engage in any verbal interaction with the percipient; this is consistent with the finding that the majority of such experiences only involve one sense (most commonly the visual).{{sfn|Green|McCreery|1975|pp=95—101}}

== Psychological implications ==

===Psychological theories of perception===

Apparitional experiences have relevance to psychological theories of [[perception]], and in particular to the distinction between top-down and bottom-up approaches (cf. article on [[Top-down and bottom-up design]]).  Top-down theories, such as that of [[Richard Langton Gregory]], who conceives of perception as a process whereby the brain makes a series of hypotheses about the external world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gregory | first1 = R. L. | year = 1980 | title = Perceptions as hypotheses | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 290 | issue = 1038| pages = 181–97 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1980.0090}}&lt;/ref&gt; stress the importance of central factors such as memory and expectation in determining the phenomenological content of perception; while the bottom-up approach, exemplified by the work of [[James J. Gibson]], emphasises the role of the external sensory stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, J.J. (1950). ''The Perception of the Visual World''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparitional experiences would seem to lend support to the importance of central factors, since they represent a form of quasi-perceptual experience in which the role of external stimuli is minimal or possibly non-existent, while the experience nevertheless continues to be phenomenologically indistinguishable from normal perception, at least in some cases.{{sfn|Bennett|1939|pp=173—177}}

===The concept of schizotypy===

The interest of apparitional experiences to psychology has acquired an added dimension in recent years with the development of the concept of [[schizotypy]] or psychosis-proneness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eysenck | first1 = H.J. | year = 1992 | title = The definition and measurement of psychoticism | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 757–785 | doi=10.1016/0191-8869(92)90050-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is conceived of as a dimension of personality,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Claridge, G. and Beech, T. (1995). ‘Fully and quasi-dimensional constructions of schizotypy.’ In Raine,  A.,  Lencz, T.,  and Mednick,  S.A., Schizotypal Personality.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; continuously distributed throughout the normal population, and analogous to the dimensions of [[extraversion]] or [[neuroticism]].  As long as mental illness is regarded under the disease model, according to which a person either does or does not ‘have’ [[schizophrenia]] or [[manic depression]], just as a person either does or does not have syphilis or tuberculosis, then to talk of the occurrence of an apparitional or hallucinatory experience in a normal person is either an [[oxymoron]], or to be taken as an indication of latent or incipient [[psychosis]].  If, on the contrary, a dimensional view of the matter is taken, it becomes easier to conceive of how normal people, more or less high on the putative schizotypy dimension, might be more or less prone to anomalous perceptual experiences, without their ever tipping over into psychosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cf | first1 =  | last2 = McCreery | first2 = C. | last3 = Claridge | first3 = G. | year = 2002 | title = Healthy schizotypy: the case of out-of-the-body experiences | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 141–154 | doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(01)00013-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green and McCreery’s identification of a class of what they called ‘reassuring apparitions’{{sfn|Green|McCreery|1975|pp=200—203}} is of particular interest in this regard, as it suggests that the experiencing of hallucinations may even have an [[adaptive]] effect in certain subjects, making them better able to cope with adverse life events.  This would fit with the model of schizotypy as essentially a normal dimension of personality, and might help to explain why the proneness to anomalous perceptual experiences has apparently not been ‘weeded out’ by the process of [[natural selection]].

== Philosophical implications ==

===Direct realism===

Apparitional experiences also have implications for the [[philosophy of perception]].  The occurrence of hallucinations, that is, perceptual experiences 'having the character of sense perception, but without relevant or adequate sensory stimulation […]',&lt;ref&gt;Drever, (1952). ''A Dictionary of Psychology''. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; have long been one of the standard objections to the philosophical theory of [[direct realism]]. According to this theory we are in some sense in direct contact with the external world when we seem to be perceiving it, and not merely in direct contact with some mediating representation in our mind, such as a sense-datum or an image, which may or may not correspond to external reality.  The psychologist J.J. Gibson, referred to above, became an advocate of the philosophical theory of direct realism.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, J.J. (1979). ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception.''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hallucinatory experiences reported by sane people do not pose any new problem in principle for the theory of direct realism, other than that posed already by the more widely discussed hallucinations reported by people in a state of psychosis or under other abnormal conditions such as [[sensory deprivation]].  However, they do pose the problem in a particularly stark way, for the following reasons:

* ''Scepticism about the status of verbal reports:''
In the case of hallucinations reported to have occurred in pathological or abnormal states there is some scope for uncertainty about the accuracy, or even the meaning, of the percipient’s verbal report. Horowitz,{{sfn|Horowitz|1964|pp=513—523}} for example, summarising his experience of questioning chronic schizophrenic patients about their visual experiences during painting sessions, wrote:

'It was necessary to persist beyond initial verbal descriptions of their hallucinations, and insist that the patient describe and draw what he had seen. Initial descriptions of "vicious snakes" might then be drawn and redescribed as wavy lines. "Two armies struggling over my soul" arose from the subjective experience of seeing moving sets of dots. "Spiders" might be reduced, when the patient stated and drew what he actually saw, to a few radiating lines.  In drawings of their hallucinations patients could often distinguish between those forms which duplicated what they saw with their eyes from those forms which were what they "made out of it".'{{sfn|Horowitz|1964|p=513}}

Such difficulties of interpretation are much less obvious in the case of written reports by ostensibly normal subjects, in good health and not medicated at the time of the experience.

* ''Extreme realism of the experience:''
As mentioned above, at least some of the apparitional experiences reported by normal subjects appear to mimic normal perception to such a degree that the subject is deceived into thinking that what they are experiencing actually is normal perception.  Similar close mimicking of normal perception is reported by some of the subjects of a [[lucid dream]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Green, C.E. (1968). ''Lucid Dreams''. London: Hamish Hamilton, pp. 70-78.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[out-of-body experiences]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Green, C.E. (1968). ''Out-of-the-Body Experiences''. London: Hamish Hamilton, pp. 71-80.&lt;/ref&gt; which therefore pose similar problems for the theory of direct realism.

===Representationalism===

Apparitional experiences appear ''[[prima facie]]'' more compatible with the philosophical theory of [[direct and indirect realism|representationalism]].  According to this theory, the immediate objects of experience when we are perceiving the world normally are representations of the world, rather than the world itself.  These representations have been variously called [[sense-data]] or images. In the case of an apparitional experience one might say that the subject is aware of sense-data or images which happen not to correspond to, or represent, the external world in the normal way.

The philosophical implications of hallucinatory experiences in the sane are discussed by McCreery.&lt;ref&gt;McCreery, C. (2006). "Perception and Hallucination: the Case for Continuity." ''Philosophical Paper No. 2006-1''. Oxford: Oxford Forum.[http://www.celiagreen.com/charlesmccreery/perception.pdf Online PDF]
&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues that they provide empirical support for the theory of representationalism rather than direct realism.

'''Auschwitz concentration camp''' was a network of [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration]] and [[extermination camp]]s built and operated by [[Nazi Germany]] in [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|occupied Poland]] during [[World War II]]. It consisted of '''{{no wrap|Auschwitz I}}''' (the original concentration camp), '''Auschwitz II–Birkenau''' (a combined concentration/extermination camp), {{no wrap|[[Monowitz concentration camp|Auschwitz III–Monowitz]]}} (a labor camp to staff an [[IG Farben]] factory), and 45 satellite camps.

Auschwitz I was first constructed to hold Polish political prisoners, who began to arrive in May 1940. The first extermination of prisoners took place in September 1941. Auschwitz II–Birkenau went on to become a major site of the Nazis' [[Final Solution to the Jewish Question]] during the [[Holocaust]]. From early 1942 until late 1944, transport trains delivered [[Jews]] to the camp's [[gas chamber]]s from all over [[German-occupied Europe]], where they were killed en masse with the [[cyanide]]-based poison [[Zyklon B]], originally developed to be used as a [[pesticide]]. An estimated 1.3 million people were sent to the camp, of whom at least 1.1&amp;nbsp;million died. Around 90 percent of those were Jews; approximately one in six Jews killed in the Holocaust died at the camp.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=298}}{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=383}} Others deported to Auschwitz included 150,000 [[Poles]], 23,000 [[Romani people|Romani]] and [[Sinti]], 15,000 [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Soviet prisoners of war]], 400 [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and tens of thousands of others of diverse nationalities, including an unknown number of [[homosexual]]s.{{sfn|Hoare|2015}} Many of those not killed in the gas chambers died of starvation, forced labor, infectious diseases, individual executions, and [[Nazi human experimentation|medical experiments]].

In the course of the war, the camp was staffed by 7,000 members of the German ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS), approximately 12 percent of whom were later convicted of [[war crime]]s. Some, including camp commandant [[Rudolf Höss]], were executed. The [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] did not act on early reports of atrocities at the camp, and their failure to bomb the camp or its railways [[Auschwitz bombing debate|remains controversial]]. At least 802 prisoners attempted to escape from Auschwitz, 144 successfully, and on 7 October 1944 two ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' units, consisting of prisoners assigned to staff the gas chambers, launched a brief, unsuccessful uprising.

As [[Red Army|Soviet troops]] approached Auschwitz in January 1945, most of its population was sent west on a [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death march]]. The prisoners remaining at the camp were liberated on 27 January 1945, a day now commemorated as [[International Holocaust Remembrance Day]]. In the following decades, survivors such as [[Primo Levi]], [[Viktor Frankl]], and [[Elie Wiesel]] wrote memoirs of their experiences in Auschwitz, and the camp became a dominant symbol of the Holocaust. In 1947 Poland founded the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]] on the site of Auschwitz I and II, and in 1979 it was named a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].

==History==

===Background===

The ideology of [[Nazism]] brought together elements of [[antisemitism]], [[racial hygiene]], and [[eugenics]], and combined them with [[pan-Germanism]] and territorial expansionism with the goal of obtaining more ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (living space) for the Germanic people.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=7}} Immediately after the [[Nazi seizure of power]] in Germany, acts of violence perpetrated against Jews became ubiquitous.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=33–35}} The [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], passed on 7 April 1933 excluded most Jews from the legal profession and the civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of the right to practise.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=38–39}} Harassment and economic pressure were used by the regime to encourage Jews to leave the country voluntarily.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=67–69}} Their businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise in newspapers, and deprived of government contracts. [[German Jews]] were subjected to violent attacks and boycotts.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=41}}

In September 1935, the [[Nuremberg Laws]] were enacted. These laws prohibited marriages between Jews and people of Germanic extraction, extramarital relations between Jews and Germans, and the employment of German women under the age of 45 as domestic servants in Jewish households.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=346}} The Reich Citizenship Law stated that only those of Germanic or related blood were defined as citizens. Thus Jews and other minority groups were stripped of their German citizenship.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=544}} The laws were expanded on 26 November 1935 to include [[Romani people]] and [[Afro-Germans]]. This supplementary decree defined Gypsies as "enemies of the race-based state", the same category as Jews.{{sfn|Majer|2003|p=102}} By the start of [[World War II]] in 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Palestine, the United Kingdom, and other countries.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=127}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=555}}

[[Nazi Germany]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] in September 1939. German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered that the Polish leadership and intelligentsia be destroyed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=144}} Approximately 65,000 civilians, who were viewed as being inferior to the [[Aryan race|Aryan]] [[master race]], were killed by the end of 1939. In addition to leaders of Polish society, the Nazis killed Jews, prostitutes, Romani, and the mentally ill.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=15}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=430–432}} SS-''[[Obergruppenführer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]], then head of the [[Gestapo]], ordered on 21 September that [[Polish Jews]] should be rounded up and concentrated into cities with good rail links. Initially the intention was to deport the Jews to points further east, or possibly to [[Madagascar Plan|Madagascar]].{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=148–149}} Two years later, in an attempt to obtain new territory, Hitler [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]],{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=7}} intending to deport or kill the Jews and [[Slavs]] living there.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=132}}

===Auschwitz I===

[[File:Map of Auschwitz and environs, 1944.jpg|thumb|Map showing the location of the three main camps (1944). Prisoners: yellow; facilities: blue-gray]]

After this part of Poland was [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|annexed by Nazi Germany]], [[Oświęcim]] (Auschwitz) was located administratively in [[Germany]], [[Province of Upper Silesia]], [[Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz]], Landkreis Bielitz. It was first suggested as a site for a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] for Polish prisoners by ''[[SS-Oberführer]]'' [[Arpad Wigand]], an aide to [[Higher SS and Police Leader]] for Silesia, [[Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski]]. Bach-Zelewski had been searching for a site to house prisoners in the Silesia region, as the local prisons were filled to capacity. [[Richard Glücks]], head of the [[Concentration Camps Inspectorate]], sent former [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] commandant [[Walter Eisfeld]] to inspect the site, which already held sixteen dilapidated one-story buildings that had once served as an Austrian and later Polish Army barracks and a camp for transient workers.{{sfn|Dwork|van Pelt|2002|p=166}} ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]], head of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS), approved the site in April 1940, intending to use the facility to house political prisoners. SS-''[[Obersturmbannführer]]'' (lieutenant colonel) [[Rudolf Höss]] oversaw the development of the camp and served as the first commandant. SS-''[[Obersturmführer]]'' (senior lieutenant) [[Josef Kramer]] was appointed Höss's deputy. Auschwitz I, the original camp, became the administrative center for the whole complex.{{sfn|Gutman|1994|pp=10, 16}}{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=22–23}}

Local residents were evicted, including 1,200 people who lived in shacks around the barracks. Around 300 Jewish residents of Oświęcim were brought in to lay foundations. From 1940 to 1941, 17,000 Polish and Jewish residents of the western districts of Oświęcim were expelled from places adjacent to the camp. The Germans also ordered [[Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany|expulsions of Poles]] from the villages of [[Broszkowice]], [[Babice, Oświęcim County|Babice]], [[Brzezinka]], [[Rajsko, Oświęcim County|Rajsko]], [[Pławy]], [[Harmęże]], [[Bór, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Bór]], and Budy to the [[General Government]].{{sfn|Oswiecim 60th Anniversary}} German citizens were offered tax concessions and other benefits if they would relocate to the area.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=63}} By October 1943, more than 6,000 Reich Germans had arrived.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=72}} The Nazis planned to build a model modern residential area for incoming Germans, including schools, playing fields, and other amenities. Some of the plans went forward, including the construction of several hundred apartments, but many were never fully implemented.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=67, 69}} Basic amenities such as water and sewage disposal were inadequate, and water-borne illnesses were commonplace.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=73}}

The first prisoners (30 German criminal prisoners from the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]) arrived in May 1940, intended to act as functionaries within the prison system. The [[first mass transport to Auschwitz concentration camp]], which included Catholic prisoners, suspected members of the resistance, and 20 Jews, arrived from the prison in [[Tarnów]], Poland, on 14 June 1940. They were interned in the former building of the Polish Tobacco Monopoly, adjacent to the site, until the camp was ready.{{sfn|Gutman|1994|pp=10, 16}}{{sfn|Nagorski|1995}}

The inmate population grew quickly as the camp absorbed Poland's intelligentsia and dissidents, including the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish underground resistance]]. By March 1941, 10,900 were imprisoned there, most of them Poles.{{sfn|Gutman|1994|pp=10, 16}} By the end of 1940, the SS had confiscated land in the surrounding area to create a {{convert|40|km2|adj=on}} "zone of interest" surrounded by a double ring of electrified barbed wire fences and watchtowers.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=27}} Like other Nazi concentration camps, the gates to Auschwitz I displayed the motto ''[[Arbeit macht frei]]'' ("Work brings freedom").{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=9}}

===Auschwitz II-Birkenau{{anchor|Birkenau}}===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Treblinka extermination camp]] --&gt;
[[File:Birkenau25August1944.jpg|thumb|American surveillance photo of Birkenau (1944). South is at the top in this photo.]]

The victories of [[Operation Barbarossa]] in the summer and fall of 1941 against Hitler's new enemy, the Soviet Union, led to dramatic changes in Nazi anti-Jewish ideology and the profile of prisoners brought to Auschwitz.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=260–262, 264–265, 270}} Construction on Auschwitz II-Birkenau began in October 1941 to ease congestion at the main camp. ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]], head of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS), intended the camp to house 50,000 [[prisoners of war]], who would be interned as forced laborers. Plans called for the expansion of the camp first to house 150,000 and eventually as many as 200,000 inmates.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=89}} An initial contingent of 10,000 Soviet prisoners of war arrived at Auschwitz I in October 1941, but by March 1942 only 945 were still alive, and these were transferred to Birkenau, where most of them died from disease or starvation by May.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=94}} By this time the Nazis had decided to annihilate the Jewish people,{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=313–314}} so Birkenau was changed to a labor camp–[[extermination camp]].{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=94}}{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=282–283}} The [[Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum]] estimates that 1.3 million people, 1.1 million of them Jewish, were sent to the camp during its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Number of deportees by ethnicity | publisher = [[Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum]] | url = http://auschwitz.org/en/history/the-number-of-victims/number-of-deportees-by-ethnicity | access-date = 16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief of construction of Auschwitz II-Birkenau was [[Karl Bischoff]]. Unlike his predecessor, he was a competent and dynamic bureaucrat who, in spite of the ongoing war, carried out the construction deemed necessary. The Birkenau camp, the four [[crematorium|crematoria]], a new reception building, and hundreds of other buildings were planned and constructed. Bischoff's plans called for each barrack to have an occupancy of 550 prisoners (one-third of the space allotted in other Nazi concentration camps). He later changed this to 744 prisoners per barrack. The SS designed the barracks not so much to house people as to destroy them.{{sfn|BBC Television|2005}}

The first [[gas chamber]] at Birkenau was the "red house" (called Bunker 1 by SS staff), a brick cottage converted into a gassing facility by tearing out the inside and bricking up the windows. It was operational by March 1942.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=96}} A second brick cottage, the "white house" or Bunker 2, was converted some weeks later.{{sfn|Rees|2005|pp=97, 101}}{{sfn|Piper|1994c|p=161}} These structures were in use for mass killings until early 1943.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=98}} Himmler visited the camp in person on 17 and 18 July 1942. He was given a demonstration of a mass killing using the gas chamber in Bunker 2 and toured the building site of the new [[IG Farben]] plant being constructed at the nearby town of [[Monowitz]].{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=106}}

In early 1943, the Nazis decided to greatly increase the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II, which had been designed as a mortuary with morgues in the basement and ground-level incinerators, was converted into a killing factory by installing gas-tight doors, vents for the [[Zyklon B]] (a highly lethal [[cyanide]]-based [[poison]]) to be dropped into the chamber, and ventilation equipment to remove the gas thereafter.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=100–101}} It went into operation in March. Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the start as gassing centers, were also constructed that spring. By June 1943, all four crematoria were operational. Most of the victims were killed using these four structures.{{sfn|Rees|2005|pp=168–169}}

===={{anchor|Gypsy camp}}{{anchor|Theresienstadt family camp}}{{anchor|Family camp}}{{anchor|Family camps}}Family camps====
{{main|Theresienstadt family camp|Gypsy camp (Auschwitz)}}
A separate camp for Roma known as the ''Zigeunerfamilienlager'' (Gypsy Family Camp) was set up at Auschwitz II-Birkenau; unlike other arrivals, the Romani prisoners were not subject to selection and families were allowed to remain together. The first transport of German Gypsies arrived on 26 February 1943, and was housed in Section B-IIe of Auschwitz II. Approximately 23,000 Gypsies had been brought to Auschwitz by 1944, 20,000 of whom died there.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=248}} One transport of 1,700 Polish Sinti and Roma were killed in the gas chambers upon arrival, as they were suspected to be ill with [[spotted fever]].{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=110}} Gypsy prisoners were used primarily for construction work.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=110}} Thousands died of typhus and [[Noma (disease)|noma]] due to overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, and malnutrition.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=248}} Between 1,400{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=251}} and 3,000{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=111}} prisoners were transferred to other concentration camps. On 2 August 1944, the SS cleared the Gypsy camp; the surviving population (estimated at 2,897 to 5,600) was then killed en masse in the gas chambers.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=251}}{{sfn|Epstein|2015|p=165}}

The [[Theresienstadt family camp]], which existed between September 1943 and July 1944, served a different purpose. The SS deported 17,500 Jews from [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] to Auschwitz, but allowed them to remain alive temporarily and send letters to friends and relatives to cast doubt on reports of the [[Final Solution]], both at Theresienstadt and in the wider world. On 8 March 1944, the remaining Jews from the first two transports in September were murdered; this was the largest massacre of Czechoslovak citizens in history. News of the liquidation reached the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] which initiated diplomatic manoeuvers to save the remaining Jews. However, after [[Maurice Rossel#Theresienstadt visit|the Red Cross visited Theresienstadt]] in June 1944 and concluded that no Jews were deported from Theresienstadt, about 3,500 Jews were removed from the family camp to other sections of Auschwitz. The remaining 6,500 were murdered in the gas chambers between 10 and 12 July 1944.{{sfn|Jahn|2007|pp=112–115}}{{sfn|Terezín Initiative|2011}}{{sfn|Fleming|2014|pp=231–232}}

===Auschwitz III===
{{Main|Monowitz concentration camp}}

[[File:FARBEN DWORY.png|thumb|Detailed map of [[Monowitz Buna Werke|Buna Werke]], [[Monowitz]], and nearby subcamps]]
After examining several sites for a new plant to manufacture buna, a type of [[synthetic rubber]] essential to the war effort, chemicals manufacturer IG Farben chose a site near the towns of [[Dwory II|Dwory]] and Monowice (Monowitz in German), about {{convert|7|km}} east of Auschwitz I and {{convert|3|km}} east of the town of Oświęcim.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=45}} Financial support in the form of tax exemptions was available to corporations prepared to develop industries in the frontier regions under the Eastern Fiscal Assistance Law, passed in December 1940. In addition to its proximity to the concentration camp, which could be used as a source of cheap labor, the site had good railway connections and access to raw materials.{{sfn|Hilberg|1994|pp=81–82}} In February 1941, Himmler ordered that the Jewish population of Oświęcim should be expelled to make way for skilled laborers that would be brought in to work at the plant. All Poles able to work were to remain in the town and were forced to work building the factory.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=49}} Himmler visited in person in March and decreed an immediate expansion of the parent camp to house 30,000 persons. Development of the camp at Birkenau began about six months later.{{sfn|Hilberg|1994|p=82}} Construction of IG Auschwitz began in April, with an initial force of 1,000 workers from Auschwitz I assigned to work on the construction. This number increased to 7,000 in 1943 and 11,000 in 1944.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=51}} Over the course of its history, about 35,000 inmates in total worked at the plant; 25,000 died as a result of malnutrition, disease, and the physically impossible workload.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=51, 53, 55}} In addition to the concentration camp inmates, who comprised a third of the work force, IG Auschwitz employed slave laborers from all over Europe.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=52}}

At first, the laborers walked the seven kilometers from Auschwitz I to the plant each day, but as this meant they had to rise at 03:00, many arrived exhausted and unable to work. The camp at Monowitz (also called Monowitz-Buna or Auschwitz III) was constructed and began housing inmates on 30 October 1942, the first concentration camp to be financed and built by private industry.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=53}} In January 1943 the ''ArbeitsausbildungLager'' (labor education camp) was moved from the parent camp to Monowitz. These prisoners were also forced to work on the building site.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=53}} The SS charged IG Farben three Reichsmarks per hour for unskilled workers, four for skilled workers.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=57}} Although the camp administrators expected the prisoners to work at 75 percent of the capacity of a free worker, the inmates were only able to perform 20 to 50 percent as well.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=53}} Site managers constantly threatened inmates with transportation to Birkenau for death in the gas chambers as a way to try to increase productivity.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=56}} Deaths and transfers to the gas chambers at Birkenau reduced the prisoner population of Monowitz by nearly a fifth each month; numbers were made up with new arrivals.{{sfn|Krakowski|1994|p=57}} Life expectancy of inmates at Monowitz averaged about three months. Though the factory had been expected to begin production in 1943, shortages of labor and raw materials meant start-up had to be postponed repeatedly.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=52, 56}} The plant was almost ready to commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=129}}

===Subcamps===
{{Further|List of subcamps of Auschwitz}}
Various other German industrial enterprises, such as [[Krupp]] and [[Siemens-Schuckert]], built factories with their own subcamps.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=57}} There were 45 such satellite camps, 28 of which served corporations involved in the armaments industry. Prisoner populations ranged from several dozen to several thousand.{{sfn|Gutman|1994|pp=17–18}} Subcamps were built at [[Blechhammer]], [[Jawiszowice]], [[Central Labour Camp Jaworzno|Jaworzno]], [[Będzin|Lagisze]], [[Mysłowice]], [[Trzebinia]], and other centers as far afield as the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]].{{sfn|Gutman|1994|p=18}}{{sfn|Piper|1994a|p=45}}{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=58}} Satellite camps were designated as ''Aussenlager'' (external camp), ''Nebenlager'' (extension or subcamp), or ''Arbeitslager'' (labor camp).{{sfn|Gutman|1994|p=17}} Industries with satellite camps included coal mines, foundries and other metal works, chemical plants, and other industries.{{sfn|Gutman|1994|p=18}}

Prisoners were also made to work in forestry and farming.{{sfn|Gutman|1994|p=18}} Budy was a farming subcamp where prisoners worked 12-hour days, often in the fields, but sometimes tending animals, cleaning ponds, digging ditches, and making compost. Human ashes from the crematorium were mixed with sod and manure to make the compost. The prisoner barracks at Budy also housed workers from nearby work sites, like the fish farm in [[Plawy]]. Meals at the worksite included herbal tea and a piece of bread with margarine or jam. The evening meal was a soup of [[rutabaga]], [[rye]], and [[nettle]]s.{{sfn|Megargee|2009|pp=233–234}} Incidents of sabotage to decrease production took place in some subcamps, including Charlottengrube, [[Gliwice|Gleiwitz II]], and [[Rajsko, Oświęcim County|Rajsko]].{{sfn|Dunin-Wasowicz|1980|p=139}}

===Evacuation and death marches===
[[File:Child survivors of Auschwitz.jpeg|thumb|Young survivors at the camp, liberated by the [[Red Army]] in January 1945]]
In mid-1944, about 130,000 prisoners were present in Auschwitz when the SS started to move about half of them to other concentration camps.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=415}} In November 1944, with the Soviet Red Army approaching through Poland, Himmler ordered gassing operations to cease across the Reich. The crematorium IV building was dismantled,{{sfn|Lachendro|2017|loc=''Evacuation''}} and the ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' were ordered to begin removing evidence of the killings, including the mass graves.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=123–124}} The SS destroyed written records, and in the final week before the camp's liberation, burned or demolished many of its buildings.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=126–27}} The plundered goods from the 'Canada' barracks at Birkenau together with building supplies were transported to the German interior.{{sfn|Lachendro|2017|loc=''Evacuation''}} On 20 January, the overflowing warehouses were set ablaze. On the same day, the gas chambers as well as crematoria II and III at Birkenau were blown up.{{sfn|Lachendro|2017|loc=''Evacuation''}} The raging fires lasted for several days. On 26 January 1945, the last crematorium V at Birkenau was demolished with explosives just one day ahead of the Soviet attack.{{sfn|Lachendro|2017|loc=''Evacuation''}}

Himmler ordered the evacuation of all camps in January 1945, charging camp commanders with "making sure that not a single prisoner from the concentration camps falls alive into the hands of the enemy."{{Sfnm|Friedlander|2009|1p=648|Longerich|2010|2p=415|2loc=according to Longerich, the order to shoot all prisoners who could not keep up with the marching pace came from [[HSSPF]] Breslau, Heinrich Schmauser}} On 17 January, 56,000–58,000 Auschwitz detainees, of whom two-thirds were Jews, were evacuated under guard, largely on foot, in severe winter conditions.{{Sfnm|Longerich|2010|1p=415|Lachendro|2017|2loc=''Evacuation''}} Thousands of them died in the subsequent [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death march]] west towards [[Wodzisław Śląski]].{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=125–6}} The guards shot all prisoners who were unable to march at the imposed pace. [[Peter Longerich]] estimates that a quarter of the detainees were thus killed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=415}} A column of inmates reached [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp]] complex. Throughout February, the terribly overcrowded main camp at Gross-Rosen was cleared, and all 44,000 inmates were moved further west. An unknown number died in this last journey.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=415–416}} In March 1945, Himmler ordered that no more prisoners should be killed, as he hoped to use them as hostages in negotiations with the Allies.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=416}} Approximately 20,000 Auschwitz prisoners made it to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] in Germany, where they were liberated by the British in April 1945.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=265}}

===Liberation{{anchor|Liberation}}===
When Auschwitz was liberated on 27 January 1945 by the [[322nd Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|322nd Rifle Division]] of the [[Red Army]], the soldiers found 7,500 prisoners alive and over 600 corpses. Among items found by the Soviet soldiers were 370,000 men's suits, 837,000 women's garments, and {{convert|7.7|tonnes|ST}} of human hair.{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=188–90}}{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=128}} The camp's liberation received little press attention at the time. In historian [[Laurence Rees]]' opinion, this was due to three factors: the previous discovery of similar crimes at [[Majdanek concentration camp]], competing news from the [[Yalta Conference|Allied summit at Yalta]], and the Soviet Union's interest, for propaganda purposes, in minimizing attention to Jewish suffering.{{sfn|Rees|2005|pp=261–62}} Due to the vast extent of the camp area, at least four divisions took part in liberating the camp: 100th Rifle Division (established in [[Vologda|Vologda, Russia]]), [[322nd Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|322nd Rifle Division]] ([[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky, Russia]]), 286th Rifle Division ([[Leningrad]]), and 107th Motor Rifle Division ([[Tambov|Tambov, Russia]]).{{sfn|Norin|2015}}

[[File:Auschwitz-Birkenau abgebrannte Barracken.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of barracks at Birkenau. Stoves and chimneys are all that remains of most of them]]

Auschwitz II-Birkenau was liberated by the Red Army at around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 27 January 1945, and the main camp (Auschwitz I) two hours later. Military trucks loaded with bread arrived the next day.{{sfn|Lachendro|2017|loc=''Liberation''}} Volunteers began to offer first aid and improvised assistance the following week.{{sfn|Lachendro|2017|loc=''Liberation''}} In early February, the [[Polish Red Cross]] hospital opened in blocks 14, 21, and 22 at Auschwitz I, headed by Dr. Józef Bellert and staffed by 30 volunteer doctors and nurses from [[Kraków]], along with around 90 former inmates.{{sfn|Lachendro|2017|loc=''PRC''}} The critically injured patients – estimated at several thousands – were relocated from Birkenau and Monowitz to the main camp. Some orphaned children were immediately adopted by Oświęcim residents, while others were transferred to Kraków, where a number of them were adopted by Polish families. Others were placed in an orphanage at [[Harbutowice, Silesian Voivodeship|Harbutowice]].{{sfn|Lachendro|2017|loc=''PRC''}}

The hospital cared for more than 4,500 patients (most of them Jews) from 20 countries, suffering from [[starvation]], alimentary [[dystrophy]], [[gangrene]], [[necrosis]], internal [[haemorrhaging]], and [[typhoid fever]].{{sfn|Lachendro|2017|loc=''PRC''}} At least 500 patients died. Assistance was provided by volunteers from Oświęcim and [[Brzeszcze]], who donated money and food, cleaned hospital rooms, delivered water, washed patients, cooked meals, buried the dead, and transported the sick in horse-drawn carts between locations.{{sfn|Lachendro|2017|loc=''PRC''}} Securing enough food for thousands of former prisoners was a constant challenge. The hospital director personally went from village to village to collect milk.{{sfn|Lachendro|2017|loc=''PRC''}}

In June 1945 the Soviet authorities took over Auschwitz I and converted it to a POW camp for German prisoners. The hospital had to move beyond the camp perimeter into former administrative buildings, where it functioned until October 1945.{{sfn|Lachendro|2017|loc=''PRC''}}

Early on, many barracks at Birkenau were taken apart by civilians who used the materials to rebuild their own homes, levelled out in the construction of Auschwitz II. The poorest residents sifted the crematoria ashes in search of nuggets from melted gold, before the warning shots were fired.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=294|loc=chpt. 6: from testimony of Józefa Zielińska forced to live in a chicken coop with her family upon returning: "it was poverty that forced us to do such a thing" she said: "that's sacrilege"}} The POW camp for the German prisoners of war was used by the Soviet [[NKVD]] until 1947.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=131}} In the two years, the Soviets dismantled and exported the IG Farben factories to the USSR.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=130}}{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=293}} Meanwhile, Soviet and Polish investigators worked to document the war crimes of the SS.{{sfn|Strzelecki, ''Liberation''}} After the site became a museum in 1947, exhumation work lasted for more than a decade.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=132}} [[Antoni Dobrowolski]], the oldest known survivor of Auschwitz, died aged 108 on 21 October 2012, in [[Dębno]], Poland.{{sfn|CBS News|2012}}

===Trials of war criminals===
[[File:AuschwitzGallows2006.JPG|thumb|Gallows in Auschwitz I where [[Rudolf Höss]] was executed on 16 April 1947]]
Camp commandant Rudolf Höss was pursued by the [[British Intelligence Corps]], who arrested him at a farm near [[Flensburg]], Germany, on 11 March 1946. Höss confessed to his role in the mass killings at Auschwitz in his memoirs and in his trial before the [[Supreme National Tribunal]] in [[Warsaw]], Poland. He was convicted of murder, returned to Auschwitz and hanged at the site of his crimes on 16 April 1947.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=138–139}}{{sfn|Rees|2005|pp=289–291}}

Around 12 percent of Auschwitz's 6,500 staff who survived the war were eventually brought to trial. Poland was more active than other nations in investigating war crimes, prosecuting 673 of the total 789 Auschwitz staff brought to trial.{{sfn|Rees|2005|pp=295–96}} On 25 November 1947, the [[Auschwitz Trial]] began in [[Kraków]], when Poland's [[Supreme National Tribunal]] brought to court 40 former Auschwitz staff. The trial's defendants included commandant [[Arthur Liebehenschel]], women's camp leader [[Maria Mandel]], and camp leader [[Hans Aumeier]]. The trials ended on 22 December 1947, with 23 death sentences, 7 life sentences, and 9 prison sentences ranging from three to fifteen years. [[Hans Münch]], an SS doctor who had several former prisoners testify on his behalf, was the only person to be acquitted.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=138–39}}

Other former staff were hanged for war crimes in the [[Dachau Trials]] and the [[Belsen Trial]], including camp leaders [[Josef Kramer]], [[Franz Hössler]], and [[Vinzenz Schöttl]]; doctor [[Friedrich Entress]]; and guards [[Irma Grese]] and [[Elisabeth Volkenrath]].{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=140}} The [[Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials]], held in [[West Germany]] from 20 December 1963 to 20 August 1965, convicted 17 of 22 defendants, giving them prison sentences ranging from life to three years and three months.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=146–149}} [[Bruno Tesch]] and [[Karl Weinbacher]], the owner and the chief executive officer of the firm [[Tesch &amp; Stabenow]], one of the suppliers of Zyklon B, were executed for knowingly supplying the chemical for use on humans.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=744}}

==Command and control==
{{Main|SS command of Auschwitz concentration camp}}
Camp guards were members of the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverbände]]'' ([[Totenkopf|Death's Head]] Units).{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=503}} Around 7,000 SS personnel in total were posted to Auschwitz during the war.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=40}} Of these, 4 percent of SS personnel were officers and 26 percent were non-commissioned officers, while the remainder were rank-and-file members.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=134}} Approximately three in four SS personnel worked in security. Others worked in the medical or political departments, in the camp headquarters, or in the economic administration, which was responsible for the property of dead prisoners.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=134}} SS personnel at the camp included 200 women, who worked as guards, nurses, or messengers.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=40–41}} The overall command authority for the entire camp was Department D (the [[Concentration Camps Inspectorate]]) of the ''[[SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt]]'' (SS Economics Main Office; SS-WVHA).{{sfn|Guterman|2008|p=28}}

[[File:Rudolf Höß.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Rudolf Höss]] (1901–1947), the first commandant of Auschwitz]]
Auschwitz was considered a comfortable posting by many SS members, due to its many amenities and the abundance of slave labor.{{sfn|Friedlander|2009|p=509}}{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=158}} Of the various prisoner groups, SS officers preferred [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] for household slaves because of their nonviolent behavior.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=160}} Höss lived with his wife and children in a villa just outside the camp grounds. Other SS personnel were also initially allowed to bring fiancees, wives, and children to live at the camp, but when the SS camp grew more crowded, Höss restricted further arrivals. Facilities for the SS personnel and their families included a library, swimming pool, coffee house, and a theater that hosted regular performances.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=40–41}}

Some prisoners—usually Aryan—were assigned positions of authority, such as ''Blockschreiber'' ("block clerk"), ''Funktionshäftling'' ("functionary"), ''[[Kapo (concentration camp)|Kapo]]'' ("head" or "overseer"), and ''Stubendienst'' ("barracks orderly"). They were considered members of the camp elite, and had better food and lodgings than the other prisoners. The ''Kapos'' in particular wielded tremendous power over other prisoners, whom they often abused.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=7}}{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=35–36}} Very few ''Kapos'' were prosecuted after the war, due to the difficulty in determining which ''Kapo'' atrocities had been performed under SS orders and which had been individual actions.{{sfn|Wittmann|2003|pp=519–20}}

About 120 SS personnel were assigned to the gas chambers and lived on site at the crematoria.{{sfn|Nyiszli|2011|pp=41, 70}} Several SS personnel oversaw the killings at each gas chamber, while the bulk of the work was done by the mostly Jewish prisoners known as ''[[Sonderkommando]]s'' (special squads).{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=102}}{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=290}} ''Sonderkommando'' responsibilities included guiding victims to the gas chambers and removing, looting, and cremating the corpses.{{sfn|Friedlander|2009|pp=307–08}}

The ''Sonderkommando'' were housed separately from other prisoners, in somewhat better conditions. Their quality of life was further improved by access to the goods taken from murdered prisoners, which ''Sonderkommandos'' were sometimes able to steal for themselves and to trade on Auschwitz's black market.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=294}} Hungarian doctor Miklós Nyiszli reported that the ''Sonderkommando'' numbered around 860 prisoners when the Hungarian Jews were being killed in 1944.{{sfn|Nyiszli|2011|p=41}} Many ''Sonderkommandos'' committed suicide due to the horrors of their work; those who did not generally were shot by the SS in a matter of weeks, and new ''Sonderkommando'' units were then formed from incoming transports. Almost none of the 2,000 prisoners placed in these units survived to the camp's liberation.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=103–104}}

The prisoners' day began at 4:30 am (an hour later in winter) with morning roll call. Dr. [[Miklós Nyiszli]] describes roll call as beginning 3:00 am and lasting four hours. The weather was cold in Auschwitz at that time of day, even in summer. The prisoners were ordered to line up outdoors in rows of five and had to stay there until 07:00, when the SS officers arrived.{{sfn|Nyiszli|2011||pp=25–26}} Meanwhile, the guards would force the prisoners to squat for an hour with their hands above their heads or levy punishments such as beatings or detention for infractions such as having a missing button or an improperly cleaned food bowl. The inmates were counted and re-counted.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=33}} The prisoners assigned to Mengele's staff slept in a separate barracks and were awoken at 07:00 for a roll call that only took a few minutes.{{sfn|Nyiszli|2011|p=27}} Nyiszli describes how even the dead had to be present at roll call, standing supported by their fellow inmates until the ordeal was over. When he was a prisoner in 1944–45, five to ten men were found dead in the barracks each night.{{sfn|Nyiszli|2011|p=26}} Anyone who was ill was sent to the hospital for a determination as to whether or not they would recover quickly; those who failed this assessment were killed by lethal injection. {{sfn|Langbein|1980|p=279}} Mengele made weekly visits to the hospital barracks and sent to the gas chambers any prisoners who had not recovered after two weeks in bed.{{sfn|Astor|1985|p=78}}

After roll call, the ''[[Kommando]]'', or work details, walked to their place of work, five abreast, wearing striped camp fatigues, no underwear, and ill-fitting wooden shoes without socks.{{sfn|Gutman|1994|pp=20–21}} A prisoner's orchestra (such as the [[Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz]]) was forced to play cheerful music as the workers left the camp. ''Kapos'' were responsible for the prisoners' behavior while they worked, as was an SS escort. The working day lasted 12 hours during the summer and a little less in the winter. Much of the work took place outdoors at construction sites, gravel pits, and lumber yards. No rest periods were allowed. One prisoner was assigned to the latrines to measure the time the workers took to empty their bladders and bowels.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=33}}{{sfn|Gutman|1994|pp=20–21}}

Sunday was not a work day, but the prisoners did not rest; they were required to clean the barracks and take their weekly shower.{{sfn|Gutman|1994|p=21}} Prisoners were allowed to write (in German) to their families on Sundays. Inmates who did not speak German would trade some of their bread to another inmate for help composing their letters. Members of the SS censored the outgoing mail.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=34}}

A second mandatory roll call took place in the evening. If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered, regardless of the weather conditions, even if it took hours. After roll call, individual and collective punishments were meted out, depending on what had happened during the day, before the prisoners were allowed to retire to their blocks for the night and receive their bread rations and water. Curfew was two or three hours later. The prisoners slept in long rows of wooden bunks, lying in and on their clothes and shoes to prevent them from being stolen.{{sfn|Gutman|1994|p=21}}

According to Nyiszli, "Eight hundred to a thousand people were crammed into the superimposed compartments of each barracks. Unable to stretch out completely, they slept there both lengthwise and crosswise, with one man's feet on another's head, neck, or chest. Stripped of all human dignity, they pushed and shoved and bit and kicked each other in an effort to get a few more inches' space on which to sleep a little more comfortably. For they did not have long to sleep".{{sfn|Nyiszli|2011|p=25}}

The types of prisoners were distinguishable by triangular pieces of cloth, called ''[[Nazi concentration camp badge|Winkel]]'', sewn onto on their jackets below their prisoner number. Political prisoners had a red triangle, Jehovah's Witnesses had purple, criminals had green, and so on. The nationality of the inmate was indicated by a letter stitched onto the ''Winkel''. Jews had a [[Yellow badge|yellow triangle]], overlaid by a second ''Winkel'' if they also fit into a second category.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=31}} Uniquely at Auschwitz, prisoners were tattooed with their prisoner number, on the chest for Soviet prisoners of war and on the left arm for civilians.{{sfn|Gutman|1994|p=20}}{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=91}} A racial hierarchy existed, with German prisoners at the top. Next were non-Jewish prisoners from other countries. Jewish prisoners were at the bottom.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=32}}

Prisoners received a hot drink in the morning, but no breakfast, and a thin meatless vegetable soup at noon. In the evening they received a small ration of moldy bread. Most prisoners saved some of the bread for the following morning.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=35}} Nyiszli notes the daily intake did not exceed 700 calories, except for prisoners being subjected to live medical experimentation, who were better fed and clothed.{{sfn|Nyiszli|2011|pp=57, 102}} Sanitary arrangements were poor, with inadequate latrines and a lack of fresh water.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=34}} In Auschwitz II-Birkenau, latrines were not installed until 1943, two years after camp construction began.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=94}} The camps were infested with vermin such as disease-carrying lice, and the inmates suffered and died in epidemics of typhus and other diseases.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=94}} [[Noma (disease)|Noma]], a bacterial infection occurring among the malnourished, was a common cause of death among children in the Gypsy camp.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=111}}

[[File:Auschwitz I death block 11 04.jpg|thumb|Block 11]]
[[Block 11]] of Auschwitz I was the prison within the prison, where violators of the numerous rules were punished. Some prisoners were made to spend the nights in [[standing cell]]s. These cells were about {{convert|1.5|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}, and held four men; they could do nothing but stand, and were forced during the day to work with the other prisoners. Prisoners sentenced to death for attempting to escape were confined in a dark cell and given neither food nor water while being left to die. {{sfn|Lachendro, ''Punishments and executions''}}

In the basement were the "dark cells", which had only a very tiny window and a solid door. Prisoners placed in these cells gradually suffocated as they used up all the oxygen in the cell; sometimes the SS lit a candle in the cell to use up the oxygen more quickly. Many were subjected to hanging with their hands behind their backs for hours, even days, thus dislocating their shoulder joints.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=26}}

Self-identifying Jews made every effort to observe Jewish tradition in the camps, despite the danger. Jews held it important to keep track of the [[Hebrew calendar]], which was the key to determining the dates of the holy holidays, the [[Sabbath]], and the [[Torah]] excerpts to be read each Sabbath. No watches, calendars, or clocks were allowed in the camps. Jewish calendars were rare amongst prisoners, as being in possession of one or making one was dangerous. Only two Jewish calendars made in Auschwitz survived to the end of the war. Prisoners kept track of the days in other ways, such as obtaining information from newcomers.{{sfn|Rosen|2014|p=18}}

[[File:Grs Oppeln 8508.jpg|thumb|A [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]] "Güterwagen" (goods wagon), one type of rail car used for deportations]]

On 31 July 1941, [[Hermann Göring]] gave written authorization to Heydrich, Chief of the [[RSHA|Reich Main Security Office]] (RSHA), to prepare and submit a plan for ''Die Endlösung der Judenfrage'' (the [[Final Solution]] of the [[Jewish question]]) in territories under German control and to coordinate the participation of all involved government organizations.{{sfn|Browning|2004|p=315}} The resulting ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'' (General Plan for the East) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, for use as slave labor or to be murdered.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=416}} In addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis also planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the [[Hunger Plan]]. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|pp=162–163, 416}}

Plans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe—eleven million people—were formalized at the [[Wannsee Conference]] on 20 January 1942. Some would be [[Extermination through labor|worked to death]] and the rest would be killed.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=555–556}} Initially the victims were killed with [[gas vans]] or by ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' firing squads, but these methods proved impracticable for an operation of this scale.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=256–57}} By 1942, killing centers at Auschwitz, [[Sobibór extermination camp|Sobibór]], [[Treblinka]], and other Nazi extermination camps replaced ''Einsatzgruppen'' as the primary method of mass killing.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=279–80}}

The first mass exterminations at Auschwitz took place in early September 1941, when 900 Soviet prisoners of war and ill inmates were killed by gathering them in the basement of Block 11 and gassing them with Zyklon B.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=88}} This building proved unsuitable for mass gassings, so the site of the killings was moved to the crematorium at Auschwitz I (Crematorium I, which operated until July 1942). There, more than 700 victims could be killed at once.{{sfn|Piper|1994c|pp=158–59}} In order to keep the victims calm, they were told they were to undergo disinfection and de-lousing. They were ordered to undress outside and then were locked in the building and gassed. After its decommissioning as a gas chamber, the building was converted to a storage facility and later served as an air raid shelter for the SS.{{sfn|Piper|1994c|pp=159–60}} The gas chamber and crematorium were reconstructed after the war using the original components, which remained on site. Some 60,000 people were killed at Crematorium I.{{sfn|Dwork|van Pelt|1997|p= 364}}{{sfn|Young|2009|p=56}}

Mass exterminations were moved to two provisional gas chambers (Bunkers 1 and 2), where the killings continued while the larger Crematoria II, III, IV, and V were under construction. Bunker 2 was temporarily reactivated from May to November 1944, when large numbers of Hungarian Jews were exterminated.{{sfn|Piper|1994c|pp=158–59}} In summer 1944 the capacity of the crematoria and outdoor incineration pits was 20,000 bodies per day.{{sfn|Piper|1994c|p=174}} A planned sixth facility—Crematorium VI—was never built.{{sfn|Piper|1994c|p=175}}

Prisoners were transported from all over German-occupied Europe by rail, arriving in daily convoys.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=104–105}} By July 1942, the SS were conducting "selections". Incoming Jews were segregated; those deemed able to work were sent to the selection officer's right and admitted into the camp, and those deemed unfit for labor were sent to the selection officer's left and immediately gassed.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=100}} The group selected to die, about three-quarters of the total,{{efn|name=Hungarians|Of the Hungarians who arrived in the summer of 1944, 85 percent were killed immediately.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=109}}}} included almost all children, women with small children, all the elderly, and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit.{{sfn|Levy|2006|pp=235–37}}

After the selection process was complete, those too ill or too young to walk to the crematoria were transported there on trucks or killed on the spot with a bullet to the head.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=127}}{{sfn|Piper|1994c|p=169}} The belongings of the arrivals were seized by the SS and sorted in an area of the camp called "Canada", so called because Canada was seen as a land of plenty. Many of the SS at the camp enriched themselves by pilfering the confiscated property.{{sfn|Rees|2005|pp=172–75}}
[[File:Aushwitz- hundreds of thousands walked down these steps.JPG|thumb|left|Destroyed gas chamber at Auschwitz]]
SS officers told the victims they were to take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel.{{sfn|Piper|1994c|pp=169–170}} The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute.{{sfn|Piper|1994c|p=162}} The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor.{{sfn|Piper|1994c|p=170}}{{sfn|Lifton|Hackett|1994|p=304}} After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes in the side of the chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes.{{sfn|Piper|1994c|p=170}} Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could still be heard over the engines.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=83}}

''Sonderkommando'' wearing gas masks then dragged the bodies from the chamber. The victims' glasses, artificial limbs, jewelry, and hair were removed, and any dental work was extracted so the gold could be melted down.{{sfn|Piper|1994c|p=171}} The corpses were burned in the nearby incinerators, and the ashes were buried, thrown in the river, or used as fertilizer.{{sfn|Piper|1994c|p=171}}

The gas chambers worked to their fullest capacity from April to July 1944, during the [[History of the Jews in Hungary#Occupation and deportation|massacre of Hungary's Jews]]. Hungary was an ally of Germany during the war, but it had resisted turning over its Jews until Germany invaded that March.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=407}} A rail spur leading directly into Birkenau was completed that May to deliver the victims closer to the gas chambers.{{sfn|Hellman|Meier|Klarsfeld|1981|p=viii}} From 14 May until early July 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews, half of the pre-war population, were deported to Auschwitz, at a rate of 12,000 a day for a considerable part of that period.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=408}} The incoming volume was so great that the SS resorted to burning corpses in open-air pits as well as in the crematoria.{{sfn|Dwork|van Pelt|1997|pp=337–343}} The last mass transports to arrive in Auschwitz were 60,000–70,000 Jews from the [[Łódź Ghetto]], some 2,000 from Theresienstadt, and 8,000 from [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovakia]].{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=109}}{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=655}} The last selection took place on 30 October 1944.{{sfn|Piper|1994c|p=174}}

German doctors performed a wide variety of experiments on prisoners at Auschwitz. SS doctors tested the efficacy of [[X-rays]] as a [[forced sterilization|sterilization]] device by administering large doses to female prisoners. Prof Dr [[Carl Clauberg]] injected chemicals into women's [[uterus]]es in an effort to glue them shut. [[Bayer]], then a subsidiary of IG Farben, bought prisoners to use as [[Human subject research|research subjects]] for testing new drugs.{{sfn|Rees|2005|pp=178–179}} Prisoners were also deliberately infected with spotted fever for vaccination research and exposed to toxic substances to study the effects.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=114–15}}

The most infamous doctor at Auschwitz was [[Josef Mengele]], known as the "Angel of Death". Particularly interested in research on [[identical twins]], Mengele performed cruel experiments on them, such as inducing diseases in one twin and killing the other when the first died to perform comparative autopsies. He also took a special interest in dwarfs, and he deliberately induced [[Noma (disease)|noma]] in twins, dwarfs, and other prisoners to study the effects.{{sfn|Rees|2005|pp=180–82}}

[[Kurt Heissmeyer]] took twenty Jewish children from Auschwitz to use in [[pseudoscientific]] medical experiments at the [[Neuengamme concentration camp]].{{efn|For "pseudo-scientific", see Kater, Michael H (2000).

A [[Jewish skeleton collection|skeleton collection]] was obtained from among a pool of 115 Jewish Auschwitz inmates, chosen for their perceived stereotypical racial characteristics.{{efn|Sievers wrote in a letter in June 1943: "Altogether 115 persons were worked on, 79 were Jews, 30 were Jewesses, 2 were Poles, and 4 were Asiatics. At the present time these prisoners are segregated by sex and are under quarantine in the two hospital buildings of Auschwitz."{{sfn|Nuremberg Trial|1946}} }} [[Rudolf Brandt]] and [[Wolfram Sievers]], general manager of the ''[[Ahnenerbe]]'' (a Nazi research institute), were responsible for delivering the skeletons to the collection of the Anatomy Institute at the [[Reichsuniversität Straßburg|Reich University of Strasbourg]] in the [[Alsace]] region of [[Occupied France]]. The collection was sanctioned by Himmler and under the direction of [[August Hirt]]. Ultimately 87 of the inmates were shipped to [[Natzweiler-Struthof]] and killed in August 1943. Brandt and Sievers were later convicted in the [[Doctors' Trial]] in Nuremberg.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=232–234}}

===Death toll===
[[File:Auschwitz Resistance 282 cropped.JPG|thumb|right|Clandestine photo taken by a member of the ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' of undressed women on their way to the gas chamber]]

Many of the very young and very old were murdered immediately upon arrival and were never registered.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=133–134}} ]]

The exact number of victims at Auschwitz is difficult to fix with certainty, because many prisoners were never registered and much evidence was destroyed by the SS in the final days of the war.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=133–134}} As early as 1942, Himmler visited the camp and ordered that "all mass graves were to be opened and the corpses burned. In addition the ashes were to be disposed of in such a way that it would be impossible at some future time to calculate the number of corpses burned."{{sfn|Friedlander|2009|p=404}}

Shortly following the camp's liberation, the Soviet government stated that four million people had been killed on the site, a figure now regarded as greatly exaggerated.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=132–133}} While under interrogation, Höss said that [[Adolf Eichmann]] told him that two and a half million Jews had been killed in gas chambers and about half a million more had died of other causes.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=133}} Later he wrote, "I regard the figure of two and a half million as far too high. Even Auschwitz had limits to its destructive possibilities".{{sfn|Höss|2000|pp=193–194}} [[Gerald Reitlinger]]'s 1953 book ''The Final Solution'' estimated the number killed to be 800,000 to 900,000,{{sfn|Reitlinger|1953|p=499}} and [[Raul Hilberg]]'s 1961 work ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'' estimated the number killed to be a maximum of 1,000,000 Jewish victims.{{sfn|Hilberg|1961|p=958}} French chemist and author [[Jean-Claude Pressac]] estimates that between 631,000 and 711,000 were killed at Auschwitz, of whom 470,000 to 550,000 were gassed.{{sfn|Pressac|Pieper|1995|p=202}}

In 1983, French scholar George Wellers was one of the first to use German data on deportations to estimate the number killed at Auschwitz, arriving at a figure of 1,471,595 deaths, including 1.35&amp;nbsp;million Jews and 86,675 Poles.{{sfn|Piper|1994b|p=67}} A larger study started by [[Franciszek Piper]] used timetables of train arrivals combined with deportation records to calculate at least 960,000 Jewish deaths and at least 1.1 million total deaths,{{sfn|Piper|1994b|pp=71–72}} a figure adopted as official by the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]] in the 1990s.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=136}}{{efn|The museum's website shows a tally of 1 million Jews, 70–75,000 Poles, 21,000 Roma, 15,000 Soviet POWs, and 10–15,000 others killed, for a total of approximately 1.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Overall numbers by ethnicity or category of deportee | publisher = Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum | url = http://auschwitz.org/en/history/the-number-of-victims/overall-numbers-by-ethnicity-or-category-of-deportee | access-date = 16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Piper stated that a figure of as many as 1.5 million total deaths was possible.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=136}}

By nation, the greatest number of Auschwitz's Jewish victims were from Hungary, accounting for 438,000 deaths, followed by [[Polish Jews]] (300,000 deaths), French (69,000), Dutch (60,000), and Greek (55,000).{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=134}} Fewer than one percent of Soviet Jews murdered in the Holocaust were killed in Auschwitz, as German forces had already been driven from Russia when the killing at Auschwitz reached its peak in 1944.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=275}} Approximately 1 in 6 Jews killed in the Holocaust died at the camp.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=383}}

The next largest group of victims were non-Jewish Poles, who accounted for 70,000 to 75,000 deaths. Twenty-one thousand Roma and Sinti were killed, along with 15,000 Soviet POWs and 10,000 to 15,000 peoples of other nations.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=134}} Around 400 Jehovah's Witnesses were imprisoned at Auschwitz, at least 152 of whom died.{{sfn|Wontor-Cichy, ''Jehovah's Witnesses''}} An estimated 5,000 to 15,000 gay men prosecuted under German Penal Code Section 175 (proscribing sexual acts between men) were detained in concentration camps of which an unknown number were sent to Auschwitz; of those sent to Auschwitz 80 percent died.{{sfn|Hoare|2015}}

==Escapes, resistance, and the Allies' knowledge of the camps==
{{See also|Resistance movement in Auschwitz|Witold Report|The Polish White Book|Responsibility for the Holocaust#The Holocaust: What the Allies knew}}
Resistance groups were organised within the camp. Activities included acquiring additional food supplies, undertaking sabotage, and organising escape attempts. An armed uprising was planned for early 1942, but it never took place.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=39–40}} Inmates were at times able to distribute information to the outside world via messages used in shortwave radio transmissions. The [[Polish government-in-exile]] in London first reported the gassing of prisoners on 21 July 1942.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=116}} These reports were for a long time disregarded as exaggerated or unreliable by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], Germany's opponents in the West.{{sfn|Davies|1996|p=1023}} Information regarding Auschwitz was also available to the Allies during the years 1940–43 by the accurate and frequent reports of Polish [[Home Army]] (Armia Krajowa) Captain [[Witold Pilecki]]. Pilecki was the only known person to volunteer to be imprisoned at Auschwitz concentration camp, spending 945 days there. He gathered evidence of genocide and organized resistance structures known as [[Związek Organizacji Wojskowej]] (ZOW) at the camp.{{sfn|Pilecki biography}} His first report was smuggled to the outside world in November 1940, through an inmate who was released from the camp.{{sfn|Lewis|1999|p=391}} He eventually escaped on 27 April 1943, but his personal report of mass killings was dismissed as exaggeration by the Allies, as were his previous reports.{{sfn|Davies|1996|p=1023}}

The first information about Auschwitz concentration camp was published in winter 1940–41 in the Polish underground newspapers ''{{illm|Polska Żyje|pl}}'' (Poland Lives) and ''[[Biuletyn Informacyjny]]'' (Newsletter).{{sfn|Bartoszewski|1970|p=123}} From 1942, members of the [[Bureau of Information and Propaganda]] of the Warsaw area [[Home Army]] published in occupied Poland a few brochures based on the accounts of escapees. The first of these was a fictional memoir "Oświęcim. Pamiętnik więźnia" (Auschwitz: Diary of a prisoner), written by [[Halina Krahelska]] and published in April 1942 in Warsaw.{{sfn|Krahelska|1985}} Also published in 1942 were the books ''Auschwitz: obóz śmierci'' (Auschwitz: Camp of Death) written by [[Natalia Zarembina]],{{sfn|Zarembina|2008}} and ''W piekle'' (In Hell) by [[Zofia Kossak-Szczucka]], the Polish writer, social activist and founder of [[Żegota]].{{sfn|Kossak-Szczucka|1942}}

In 1943, the ''[[Kampfgruppe Auschwitz]]'' (Combat Group Auschwitz) was organized with the aim of sending out information about what was happening.{{sfn|Mais|Engel|Fogelman|2007|pp=73}} ''Sonderkommandos'' buried notes in the ground, hoping they would be found by the camp's liberators.{{sfn|Nyiszli|2011|p=124}} The group also smuggled out photographs of corpses and preparations for mass killings in mid-1944.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=121}}

The attitude of the Allies changed with receipt of the detailed, 32-page [[Vrba–Wetzler report]], compiled by two Jewish prisoners, [[Rudolf Vrba]] and [[Alfréd Wetzler]], who escaped on 7 April 1944. This report finally convinced Allied leaders that mass killings were taking place in Auschwitz.{{sfn|Linn|2006}} Details from the Vrba-Wetzler report were released to the Swiss press by diplomat [[George Mantello]] and printed on 6 June by ''[[The New York Times]]''.{{sfn|Kárný|1994|p=561}} Auschwitz Plans originating with the Polish government were provided to the UK foreign ministry in August 1944.{{sfn|UK National Archives}} A Polish report about Auschwitz titled "Oswiecim, Camp of Death (Underground Report)" with a foreword by [[Florence Jaffray Harriman]] was published in English by the Polish Labor Group in New York in March 1944, before the camp's liberation. Gassing of prisoners from 1942 was described in this report.{{sfn|Zarembina|Harriman|1944|pp=5–6}}

Slovak rabbi [[Michael Dov Weissmandl]] was the first to suggest, in May 1944, that the Allies [[Auschwitz bombing debate|bomb the rails leading to Auschwitz]].{{sfn|Kitchens|2000|pp=80–81}} At one point British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] ordered that such a plan be prepared, but he was told that precision bombing the camp to free the prisoners or disrupt the railway was not technically feasible.{{sfn|Biddle|2000|p=35}} Although the rails were never bombed, an intercepted cable mentioning the proposal convinced Hungarian regent [[Miklós Horthy]] that the Allied bombing of Budapest was connected to the deportation of the Hungarian Jews and was a major factor in his decision to stop the deportation in July 1944.{{sfn|Bauer|1994|p=182}} In 1978, historian [[David Wyman]] published an essay titled "Why Auschwitz Was Never Bombed", arguing that the [[United States Army Air Forces]] had the capability to attack Auschwitz and should have done so; books by [[Bernard Wasserstein]] and [[Martin Gilbert]] raised similar questions about British inaction.{{sfn|Neufeld|2000|pp=1–2}} Since the 1990s, other historians have argued that Allied bombing accuracy was not sufficient for Wyman's proposed attack, and that [[counterfactual history]] is an inherently problematic endeavor.{{sfn|Neufeld|2000|pp=4–5, 9–10}} The controversy over this decision has lasted to the present day in both countries.{{sfn|Neufeld|2000|pp=1–2}}

===Individual escape attempts===

At least 802 prisoners attempted to escape from the Auschwitz camps, mostly Polish or Soviet prisoners fleeing from work sites outside the camp.{{sfn|Swiebocki, ''The resistance movement''}} 144 were successful. The fates of 331 of the escapees are unknown.{{sfn|''Sixty-Third Anniversary''|2005}} A common punishment for escape attempts was death by starvation; the families of successful escapees were sometimes arrested and interned in Auschwitz and prominently displayed to deter others. If someone did manage to escape, the SS picked ten people at random from the prisoner's block and starved them to death.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=141}}

A daring escape from Auschwitz was staged on 20 June 1942 by four Polish prisoners: Eugeniusz Bendera (an auto mechanic at the camp),{{sfn|Zawadzki|2012}} [[Kazimierz Piechowski]], Stanisław Gustaw Jaster, and Józef Lempart.{{sfn|Piechowski|Kłodecka-Kaczyńska|Ziółkowski|2003|p=99}} After breaking into a warehouse, the four dressed as members of the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverbände]]'' (the SS units responsible for concentration camps), armed themselves, and stole an SS staff car, which they then drove unchallenged through the main gate.{{sfn|Rees|2005|pp=144–145}}

On 24 June 1944, a Belgian-Polish Jew, [[Mala Zimetbaum]], escaped with her Polish boyfriend, Edek Galiński, dressed in a stolen prisoner-guard uniform. They were later recaptured, tortured, and executed by the SS.{{sfn|Gilbert|1987|pp=695–697}} On 21 July 1944, inmate [[Jerzy Bielecki (Auschwitz survivor)|Jerzy Bielecki]], dressed in an SS uniform and using a faked pass, managed to cross the camp's gate together with his Jewish girlfriend, Cyla. Both survived the war.{{sfn|Stahl, JFR}}

===''Sonderkommando'' revolt===
[[File:Auschwitz Birkenau Krematorium IV - 05.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of Crematorium IV, blown up in the revolt]]
The ''Sonderkommando'' units were aware that as witnesses to the killings, they themselves would eventually be killed to hide Nazi crimes.{{sfn|Friedlander|2009|p=581}} Though they knew that it would mean their deaths, the ''Sonderkommandos'' of Birkenau ''Kommando'' III staged an uprising on 7 October 1944, following an announcement that some of them would be selected to be "transferred to another camp"—a common Nazi ruse for the murder of prisoners.{{sfn|Friedlander|2009|p=581}}{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=120}} The ''Sonderkommandos'' attacked the SS guards with stones, axes, and makeshift hand grenades, which they also used to damage Crematorium IV and set it afire. As the SS set up machine guns to attack the prisoners in Crematorium IV, the ''Sonderkommandos'' in Crematorium II also revolted, some of them managing to escape the compound.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=120}}{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=257}} The rebellion was suppressed by nightfall.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=121}}

Ultimately, three SS guards were killed — one of whom was burned alive by the prisoners in the oven of Crematorium II{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=257}} — and 451 ''Sonderkommandos'' were killed.{{sfn|Długoborski|Piper|2000|p=187}}{{sfn|Langbein|1994|p=501}} Hundreds of prisoners escaped, but were all soon captured and executed, along with an additional group who participated in the revolt.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=257}} Crematorium IV was destroyed in the fighting, and a group of prisoners in the gas chamber of Crematorium V was &lt;!-- temporarily spared? - did they escape? --&gt;spared in the chaos.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=121}}{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=257}}

In the decades since its liberation, Auschwitz has become a primary symbol of the Holocaust. Historian [[Timothy D. Snyder]] attributes this to the camp's high death toll as well as to its "unusual combination of an industrial camp complex and a killing facility", which left behind far more witnesses than single-purpose killing facilities such as [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]] or [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]].{{sfn|Snyder|2010|pp=382–383}} The [[United Nations General Assembly]] has designated 27 January, the date of the camp's liberation, as [[International Holocaust Remembrance Day]].{{sfn|International Holocaust Remembrance Day|2013}} In a speech on the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation, German chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] described Auschwitz as the "darkest and most horrific chapter of German history".{{sfn|''The Independent''|1995}}

Notable memoirists of the camp include [[Primo Levi]], [[Elie Wiesel]], and [[Tadeusz Borowski]].{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=383}} In ''[[If This Is a Man]]'', Levi wrote that the concentration camps represented the epitome of the totalitarian system:
{{quote|[N]ever has there existed a state that was really "totalitarian."&amp;nbsp;... Never has some form of reaction, a corrective of the total tyranny, been lacking, not even in the Third Reich or Stalin's Soviet Union: in both cases, public opinion, the magistrature, the foreign press, the churches, the feeling for justice and humanity that ten or twenty years of tyranny were not enough to eradicate, have to a greater or lesser extent acted as a brake. Only in the ''Lager'' [camp] was the restraint from below non-existent, and the power of these small [[satrap]]s absolute.{{sfn|Gutman|1994|p=5}} }}

Elie Wiesel wrote about his own imprisonment at Auschwitz in ''[[Night (book)|Night]]'' (1960) and other works, and became a prominent spokesman against ethnic violence. In 1986, he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].{{sfn|Norwegian Nobel Committee|1986}} Camp survivor [[Simone Veil]] was later elected President of the [[European Parliament]], serving from 1979 to 1982.{{sfn|''Women in World History''|2002}} Two Auschwitz victims—[[Maximilian Kolbe]], a priest who volunteered to die by starvation in place of a stranger, and [[Edith Stein]], a Jewish convert to Catholicism—were later named saints of the [[Catholic Church]].{{sfn|''Boston Globe''|2005}}

On 2 July 1947, the Polish government passed a law, establishing a state memorial to the victims of Nazism on the site of the camp.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=132}} In 1955, an exhibition opened, displaying prisoner [[mug shot]]s; hair, suitcases, and shoes taken from murdered prisoners; canisters of Zyklon B pellets; and other objects related to the killings.{{sfn|Permanent exhibition – Auschwitz I}} [[UNESCO]] added the camp to its list of [[World Heritage Site]]s in 1979.{{sfn|UNESCO, ''World Heritage List''}} In 2011, the museum drew 1,400,000 visitors.{{sfn|Number of visitors}}

Pope [[John Paul II]] celebrated [[Mass (Roman Rite)|mass]] over the train tracks leading to the camp on 7 June 1979. In the decades following his visit, controversies erupted over a group of [[Carmelite]] nuns founding a convent on the site and [[Auschwitz cross|erecting a large cross]] originally used in the pope's mass. Protesters objected to what they saw as Christianization of the site, while others argued that the cross's presence effectively recognized the camp's Catholic victims.{{sfn|Carroll|2002}}

On 4 September 2003, three [[Israeli Air Force]] [[F-15 Eagle]]s performed a fly-over of Auschwitz-Birkenau during a ceremony at the camp below. The flight was led by Major-General [[Amir Eshel]], the son of Holocaust survivors.{{sfn|Katz|2008}} On 27 January 2015, some 300 Auschwitz survivors and other guests gathered under a giant tent at the entrance to Auschwitz II Birkenau to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the camp's liberation. Attendees included president of the [[World Jewish Congress]] [[Ronald Lauder]], film director [[Steven Spielberg]], and world leaders such as Polish president [[Bronisław Komorowski]] and King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands]]. As the number of remaining survivors decreases each year, the attendance at the event is unlikely to be surpassed at future major anniversaries.{{sfn|BBC News|2015}}

Museum curators consider visitors who pick up items from the ground to be thieves, and local police will charge them as such. The maximum penalty is a prison sentence of ten years.{{sfn|BBC|2016}} On 22 June 2015, two British youths from the [[The Perse School|Perse School]] were convicted of theft after picking up buttons and shards of decorative glass they found on the ground near the area where camp victims' confiscated personal effects were stored. The boys, both 17 years old, received probation and were fined £170, but later appealed the sentence. Curators said that similar incidents happen once or twice a year.{{sfn|BBC News|2015a}}{{sfn|BBC|2016}}

It also includes the history and mechanical principles of some of the inventions and projects. From catapults to rockets, this book describes accessible ways to create these at home or in the classroom. In addition to recreational use by individuals, teacher's guides have been developed and science fair projects designed around this book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backyard-ballistics.com/pdfs/backyard_ballistics_plan_5.pdf Backyard Ballistics Teacher's Guide 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.home-school.com/Articles/kaboom-superior-science-on-a-shoestring.html Homeschool article on inexpensive science curriculum 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been cited in several educational and scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;Mungen, C.E., Internal Ballistics of a Pneumatic Potato Cannon.

Its test version was released on 20 April 2006, and within three weeks the encyclopedia had grown to more than 90,000 articles, surpassing the number in [[Chinese Wikipedia]]. {{As of|2018|August}}, Baidu Baike has more than 15.4 million articles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Baidu]] officially states that Baidu Baike serves as an online encyclopedia as well as information storage space for netizens.

==Conception==
Baidu's William Chang said at WWW2008, the conference of the [[World Wide Web Consortium]], "There is, in fact, no reason for China to use Wikipedia ... It's very natural for China to make its own products."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13908_3-9926474-59.html  |title=Baidu's William Chang: 'No reason for China to use Wikipedia' |accessdate=2008-06-22  |author=Graham Webster |date=2008-04-22 |publisher=CNET News}}&lt;/ref&gt; When searching with the search engine [[Baidu]], the link of the corresponding entry in Baidu Baike, if exists, will be put as the first result or one of the first results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.163.com/11/0224/09/6TL9GE5A000915BF.html|title=《互动百科诉百度"垄断"》|work=孙超逸|publisher=网易|accessdate=2011-02-23}} (Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==

=== Front page ===
The current front page of Baidu Baike was put into use on 6 September 2012. At the top of the page the slogan "Let all humanity learn the world equally," as well as current information on the number of users and entries. On the bottom-left of the front page selected contents are presented; the bottom right contains announcements, plans and projects, etc. The front page information usually includes current hot topics, often related to featured news. Beside those hot topics, there are also one-sentence summaries of the news. Other than the front page, Baidu Baike also includes channels such as nature, culture, geography, and special topics such as core-users, digital museums, etc.

=== Registration ===
All editors need to register an account before editing, and administrators filter all but the simplest edits before they go public.&lt;ref name=PCWORLD/&gt; A phone number registered in mainland China is needed to register a new an account.

=== Entries ===
The entry pages of Baidu Baike include calling cards, texts, and other supporting information. An earlier version allowed users to comment on pages, but this feature was removed after September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hi.baidu.com/baikeguanfang/item/bc6799f7f3cd722d753c4c79|title=《词条浏览页升级啦》|accessdate=2009-09-14|work=|publisher=百度百科公告}}在这次升级中评论被读者推荐代替，这篇文章后的评论中即有用户询问评论区为何取消，例如31楼、37楼和39楼&lt;/ref&gt; The main language used is Chinese, written using the [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified script]]; posts written in Traditional Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, or Japanese are [[machine translation|automatically translated]].

====Calling cards and texts====
Baike calling cards contain two parts - the description of an entry and the basic information. The former is similar to the preface of an article, which provides a general introduction to the whole text; the latter uses a table to summarize basic information and statistics. Both are edited separately from the main body of the article. The main texts are limited to 40,000 bits, which is equivalent to 20,000 Chinese characters.&lt;!-- {{Clarify span|There are two possible levels of title, and the system will give a content accordingly.|date=January 2016}}--&gt; At the end of the article is the declaration of exemption. The earlier version of the entry can only contain one image, but now 20 images and 20 albums can be included in an article. The entry can also link to a Baidu map, dynamic screenshots, and videos. Information cited is listed beneath the main text, which does not distinguish footnotes from other details. However, the images cited do not specify the source, but contain image directories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%99%BE%E5%BA%A6%E7%99%BE%E7%A7%91%EF%BC%9A%E8%AF%8D%E6%9D%A1%E5%90%8D%E7%89%87|title=百度百科：词条名片|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%99%BE%E5%BA%A6%E7%99%BE%E7%A7%91%EF%BC%9A%E5%9F%BA%E6%9C%AC%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF%E6%A0%8F|title=百度百科：基本信息栏|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2018|reason=No source about texts}}

====Supporting information====
Most pieces of supporting information are located at the bottom or the right of the page, except scientific terms, which are pushed to the top. Usually, supporting information is automatically generated by the system, with some edited by hand. &lt;!--{{Clarify span|Pieces of supporting information are presented as modules, such as scientific terms, Douban film commentaries, etc.|date=January 2016}}--&gt;
Supporting information on the right of the page contains personal information, statistics, today in history, contribution of honor, current trends, and pop-links. Statistics include the number of page views, the number of editors, latest updates, creators information, etc. Editors who contribute complex articles are also mentioned and honoured.&lt;ref name="注"&gt;参见 [http://www.baidu.com/search/baike_help.html#复杂编辑 复杂编辑的定义]。&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=January 2016}} &lt;!--{{clarify span|user ID who has made excellent editing, and its links. The honor gives different kinds of medals. Current trends are used to present some current activities, and the pop-links are of advertisement, which generate some profits form Baidu company.|date=January 2016}}--&gt;

A user can see a database, the Baidu Dictionary, and related entries at the bottom of each article. &lt;!--{{clarify span|users recommendation, collaborated editors|date=January 2016}}--&gt; Celebrities' articles have appended databases that list their single songs, albums, and videos. &lt;!--{{Clarify span|When terms or phrases are listed in one product of Baidu, Baike will also give links to the explanation.|date=January 2016}}--&gt; The user recommendations section is used to collect feedback about the article. &lt;!--{{Clarify span|or the number of votes to "this entry is helpful to me".|date=January 2016}}--&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

====Encyclopaedia titles====
{{citation needed span|When an editor makes a edit that is approved, the editor's account receives a certain amount of experience points based on the complexity of the edit, (1 for the simplest edits, 5 for a complex edit). When an editor successfully completes a requested task, the editor receives experience points and a predetermined number of wealth points, which can be used to make purchases on Baidu.|date=April 2018}} Editors are divided into 15 levels with corresponding 'Encyclopaedia titles' ({{lang|zh-hans|百科头衔}}) based on their accumulated experience points. In 2012, the names of the titles were changed from modern corporate sounding titles to titles reminiscent of the Chinese [[Imperial examination]] and Confucian scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://baike.baidu.com/item/百科头衔/4704319|title= 百科头衔|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2018}}

== Scope ==

===Contents and categories===
Unlike a traditional encyclopedia, the information on Baidu Baike is broader, similar to [[Chinese Wikipedia]] and [[Hudong|Hudong.com]]. Baidu Baike also includes food recipes, film products, internet programs, and video games as well as its encyclopedic content. However, unlike Chinese Wikipedia, Baidu Baike never gives a strict definition of the difference between an encyclopedia entry and a [[dictionary]] entry. There are also many explanations on diction and common phrases.

In addition to articles, Baidu Baike includes several special pages:
*A Sandbox (编辑实验) entry, which gives users a chance to practice editing.
*Help, which provides terminologies, basic settings, regulations, user titles, etc.
*User page, which is called "Baidu Authorized ID", and is similar to the one on Wikipedia. However, these are viewed as an encouragement for advanced users, and rarely does anyone have the privilege to make their own page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://bbs.baidu.com/f?kz=980891185|title=2011年百科权威认证ID名单公示 |author=百科领航员|date=2011-01-20 |publisher= 百度贴吧 |language= Chinese |accessdate=2011-02-20 |quote= 这次一共有15名同学进入公示名单 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baidu Baike holds open policies on the addition of entries, and support categorized search functions. The categorization is based on the characteristics of an entry but not the quality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baidu.com/search/baike_help.html#百科词条结构|title=百科词条结构|accessdate=2010-08-15|publisher=百度百科帮助}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is no limit to categorization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28836">[[File:John 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Gospel according to John]] - a text showing chapter and verse divisions ([[King James Version]])]]

The [[Bible]] is a compilation of many [[books of the Bible|shorter books]] written at different times by a variety of authors, and later assembled into the [[biblical canon]]. Since the early 13th century, most copies and editions of the Bible present all but the shortest of these books with divisions into [[chapter (books)| chapters]], generally a page or so in length. Since the mid-16th century editors have further subdivided each chapter into verses - each consisting of a few short lines or sentences. Sometimes a sentence spans more than one verse, as in the case of {{bibleref2|Ephesians|2:8–9|9}}, and sometimes there is more than one sentence in a single verse, as in the case of {{bibleref2|Genesis|1:2|9}}.

As the chapter and verse divisions did not appear in the original texts, they form part of the [[paratext]] of the Bible.

The Jewish divisions of the Hebrew text differ at various points from those used by Christians.  For instance, in Jewish tradition, the ascriptions to many [[Psalms]] are regarded as independent verses or parts of the subsequent verses, making 116 more verses, whereas established Christian practice treats each Psalm ascription as independent and unnumbered.  Some chapter divisions also occur in different places, e.g. Hebrew Bibles have  {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|5:27–41|HE}} where Christian translations have {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|6:1–15|NIV}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==History==
[[File:Isaiah Wall.jpg|thumb|left|"...they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more." ~ [[Isaiah 2:4]] KJV (Bible verse across the street from the [[United Nations Building]] in [[New York City]])]]

===Chapters===
Early manuscripts of the biblical texts did not contain the chapter and verse divisions in the numbered form familiar to modern readers.  In antiquity Hebrew texts were divided into paragraphs ([[parashot]]) that were identified by two letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. [[Pe (letter)|Peh פ]] indicated an "open" paragraph that began on a new line, while [[Samekh|Samekh ס]] indicated a "closed" paragraph that began on the same line after a small space.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Würthwein, ''The Text of the Old Testament'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1998), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; These two letters begin the Hebrew words open ('''''p'''atuach'') and closed ('''''s'''agoor''), and are, themselves, open פ and closed ס. The earliest known copies of the [[Book of Isaiah]] from the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] used parashot divisions, although they differ slightly from the [[Masoretic text|Masoretic]] divisions.&lt;ref name=Wurthwein-2&gt;Würthwein, ''The Text of the Old Testament'', n. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; (This is different from the use of consecutive letters of the Hebrew alphabet to structure certain poetic compositions, known as [[acrostic]]s, such as several of the [[Psalms]] and most of the [[Book of Lamentations]].)

The [[Hebrew Bible]] was also divided into some larger sections.  In Israel the [[Torah]] (its first five books) were divided into 154 sections so that they could be read through aloud in weekly worship over the course of three years. In Babylonia it was divided into 53 or 54 sections ([[Parashat ha-Shavua]]) so it could be read through in one year.&lt;ref name=Wurthwein-2/&gt;  The [[New Testament]] was divided into topical sections known as ''kephalaia'' by the fourth century. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] divided the gospels into parts that he listed in tables or ''canons''. Neither of these systems corresponds with modern chapter divisions.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt and Barbara Aland, ''The Text of the New Testament'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans and Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1989), pp. 252 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  (See fuller discussions below.)

Chapter divisions, with titles, are also found in the 9th century Tours manuscript, Paris Bibliothèque Nationale MS Lat. 3, the so-called Bible of Rorigo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanaregia.eu/en/manuscripts/paris-bibliotheque-nationale-france-mss-latin-3/en|title=Europeana Regia - Paris Bibliothèque nationale de France MSS Latin 3|first=Europeana Regia|last=Consortium|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archbishop [[Stephen Langton#Chapters of the Bible|Stephen Langton]] and Cardinal [[Hugo de Sancto Caro]] developed different schemas for systematic division of the Bible in the early 13th century. It is the system of Archbishop Langton on which the modern chapter divisions are based.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07175a.htm Hebrew Bible] article in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''The early versions of the New Testament: Their origin, transmission and limitations'', Oxford University Press (1977), p.347. Cited in [http://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2013/06/21/stephen-langton-and-the-modern-chapter-divisions-of-the-bible/ Stephen Langton and the modern chapter divisions of the bible] by British translator Roger Pearse, 21 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

While chapter divisions have become nearly universal, editions of the Bible have sometimes been published without them.  Such editions, which typically use thematic or literary criteria to divide the biblical books instead, include [[John Locke|John Locke's]] ''Paraphrase and Notes on the Epistles of St. Paul'' (1707),&lt;ref&gt;London: Awnsham and John Churchill, 1707&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell's]] ''The Sacred Writings'' (1826),&lt;ref&gt;1826; repr.

===Verses===
Since at least 916 the [[Tanakh]] has contained an extensive system of multiple levels of section, paragraph, and phrasal divisions that were indicated in [[Masoretic]] vocalization and [[cantillation|cantillation markings]].&lt;!-- page 75 --&gt; One of the most frequent of these was a special type of punctuation, the ''[[sof passuq]]'', symbol for a full stop or sentence break, resembling the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] (:) of English and Latin orthography. With the advent of the printing press and the translation of the [[Bible]] into English, Old Testament versifications were made that correspond predominantly with the existing Hebrew full stops, with a few isolated exceptions. Most attribute these to Rabbi [[Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus]]'s work for the first Hebrew [[Bible concordance]] around 1440.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, G.F. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3259119 The Vulgate Chapters and Numbered Verses in the Hebrew Bible], pages 73–78 at [[JSTOR]]. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3259119?seq=3 page 75]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person to divide New Testament chapters into verses was Italian Dominican biblical scholar [[Santi Pagnini]] (1470–1541), but his system was never widely adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bible: A History|author1=Miller, Stephen M. |author2=Huber, Robert V. |year=2004|publisher=Good Books|isbn=1-56148-414-8|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; His verse divisions in the New Testament were far longer than those known today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://tools.pitts.emory.edu/Printer/|title = Pitts Theology Library Exhibit on the Verses of the New Testament|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Estienne]] created an alternate numbering in his 1551 edition of the Greek New Testament&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblestudymagazine.com/interactive/chaptersverses/ "Chapters and Verses: Who Needs Them?,"] Christopher R. Smith, Bible Study Magazine (July–Aug 2009): 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; which was also used in his 1553 publication of the Bible in French. Estienne's system of division was widely adopted, and it is this system which is found in almost all modern Bibles. Estienne produced a 1555 Vulgate that is the first Bible to include the verse numbers integrated into the text. Before this work, they were printed in the margins.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first English New Testament to use the verse divisions was a 1557 translation by [[William Whittingham]] (c. 1524–1579). The first Bible in English to use both chapters and verses was the [[Geneva Bible]] published shortly afterwards in 1560. These verse divisions soon gained acceptance as a standard way to notate verses, and have since been used in nearly all English Bibles and the vast majority of those in other languages.  (Nevertheless, some Bibles have removed the verse numbering, including the ones noted above that also removed chapter numbers; a recent example of an edition that removed only verses, not chapters, is [[The Message (Bible)|''The Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language'']] by [[Eugene H. Peterson]].)&lt;ref&gt;Colorado Springs: NavPress, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish tradition==
{{Main article|Tanakh#Chapters and verse numbers, book divisions}}
The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Masoretic text]] of the Bible notes several different kinds of subdivisions within the biblical books:

===Verse endings===
{{Main article|Sof passuk}}
Most important are the verse endings. According to the [[Talmud]]ic tradition, the division of the text into verses is of ancient origin.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, ''Nedarim'' 37b&lt;/ref&gt; In Masoretic versions of the Bible, the end of a verse is indicated by a small mark in its final word called a ''silluq'' (which means "stop"). Less formally, verse endings are usually also indicated by two horizontal dots following the word with a ''silluq''.

===Parashiyot===
{{main article|Parashah}}
The Masoretic textual tradition also contains section endings called ''[[Parashah|parashot]]'', which are usually indicated by a space within a line (a "closed" section) or a new line beginning (an "open" section). The division of the text reflected in the ''parashot'' is usually thematic. Unlike chapters, the ''parashot'' are not numbered, but some of them have special titles.

In early manuscripts (most importantly in [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]] Masoretic manuscripts, such as the [[Aleppo codex]]), an "open" section may also be represented by a blank line, and a "closed" section by a new line that is slightly indented (the preceding line may also not be full). These latter conventions are no longer used in Torah scrolls and printed [[Hebrew Bible]]s. In this system, the one rule differentiating "open" and "closed" sections is that "open" sections must ''always'' start at the beginning of a new line, while "closed" sections ''never'' start at the beginning of a new line.

===Sedarim===
Another division of the biblical books found in the Masoretic text is the division of the ''[[Seder (Bible)|sedarim]]''. This division is not thematic, but is almost entirely based upon the ''quantity'' of text. For the [[Torah]], this division reflects the triennial cycle of reading that was practiced by the Jews of the Land of Israel.

==Christian versions==
The Byzantines also introduced a concept roughly similar to chapter divisions, called ''kephalaia'' (singular ''kephalaion'', literally meaning ''heading'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetextofthegospels.com/2016/04/kephalaia-ancient-chapters-of-gospels.html |title=Kephalaia: The Ancient Chapters of the Gospels |last=Snapp | first=James |date=15 April 2016 |accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system, which was in place no later than the 5th century, is not identical to the present chapters. Unlike the modern chapters, which tend to be of roughly similar length, the distance from one ''kephalaion'' mark to the next varied greatly in length both within a book and from one book to the next.  For example, the [[Sermon on the Mount]], comprising three chapters in the modern system, has but one ''kephalaion'' mark, while the single modern chapter 8 of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] has several, one per miracle.  Moreover, there were far fewer ''kephalaia'' in the [[Gospel of John]] than in the [[Gospel of Mark]], even though the latter is the shorter text. In the manuscripts, the ''kephalaia'' with their numbers, their standard titles (''titloi'') and their page numbers would be listed at the beginning of each biblical book; in the book's main body, they would be marked only with arrow-shaped or asterisk-like symbols in the margin, not in the text itself.

The titles usually referred to the first event or the first theological point of the section only, and some ''kephalaia'' are manifestly incomplete if one stops reading at the point where the next ''kephalaion'' begins (for example, the combined accounts of the miracles of the [[Daughter of Jairus]] and of the [[Christ healing the bleeding woman|healing of the woman with a haemorrhage]]  gets two marked ''kephalaia'', one titled ''of the daughter of the synagogue ruler'' at the beginning when the ruler approaches Jesus and one titled ''of the woman with the flow of blood'' where the woman enters the picture – well before the ruler's daughter is healed and the storyline of the previous ''kephalaion'' is thus properly concluded). Thus the ''kephalaia'' marks are rather more like a system of bookmarks or links into a continuous text, helping a reader to quickly find one of several well-known episodes, than like a true system of chapter divisions.

Cardinal [[Hugh of St Cher|Hugo de Sancto Caro]] is often given credit for first dividing the [[Latin Vulgate]] into chapters in the real sense, but it is the arrangement of his contemporary and fellow cardinal [[Stephen Langton]] who in 1205 created the chapter divisions which are used today. They were then inserted into Greek manuscripts of the New Testament in the 16th century. [[Robert Estienne]] (Robert Stephanus) was the first to number the verses within each chapter, his verse numbers entering printed editions in 1551 (New Testament) and 1571 (Hebrew Bible).&lt;ref name = "Examiner"&gt;[http://www.theexaminer.org/history/chap6.htm The Examiner].&lt;/ref&gt;

The division of the Bible into chapters and verses has received criticism from some traditionalists and modern scholars. Critics state that the text is often divided in an incoherent way, or at inappropriate rhetorical points, and that it encourages citing passages out of context. Nevertheless, the chapter and verse numbers have become indispensable as technical references for Bible study.

Several modern publications of the Bible have eliminated numbering of chapters and verses. [[Biblica]] published such a version of the [[NIV]] in 2007 and 2011. In 2014, [[Crossway Books|Crossway]] published the [[ESV]] Reader's Bible and ''[[Bibliotheca (Bible)|Bibliotheca]]'' published a modified ASV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zylstra |first=Sarah Eekhof |title=Introducing the Bible! Now with Less! |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |date=25 July 2014 |accessdate=23 August 2014 |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/july-web-only/bibliotheca-readers-bible.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects such as Icthus&lt;ref name="Icthus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icthusapp.com|title=Icthus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; also exist which strip chapter and verse numbers from existing translations.

=={{anchor|Statistics}}Protestant Bible statistics==
The number of words can vary depending upon aspects such as whether the Hebrew alphabet in Psalm 119, the superscriptions listed in some of the Psalms, and the subscripts traditionally found at the end of the Pauline epistles, are included.
Except where stated, the following apply to the [[King James Version]] of the Bible in its modern 66-book Protestant form including the New Testament and the [[protocanonical]] Old Testament, not the [[deuterocanonical books]].

===Chapters===
* There are 929 chapters in the [[Old Testament]].
** 187 chapters in the Pentateuch
** 249 chapters in the Historical books
** 243 chapters in the Poetic books ("Wisdom")
** 183 chapters in the Major prophets
** 67 chapters in the Minor prophets
* There are 260 chapters in the [[New Testament]]. 
** 89 chapters in the Gospels
** 28 chapters in Acts
** 87 chapters in the Pauline Epistles (excluding Hebrews)
** 34 chapters in the General Epistles (including Hebrews)
** 22 chapters in Revelation
* This gives a total of 1,189 chapters (on average, 18 per book).
* Psalm 117, the shortest chapter, is also the middle chapter of the Bible, being the 595th Chapter.&lt;ref name=midbible&gt;[http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/midbible.html The Center of the Bible] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828035123/http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/midbible.html |date=August 28, 2005 }} at BreakTheChain.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleverse||Psalm|119|ESV}} is the longest chapter of the Bible.
* Five books are a single chapter: Obadiah, Philemon, 2 &amp; 3 John, Jude. In many printed editions, the chapter number is omitted for these books, and references just use the verse numbers.

===Verses===
* There are 23,145 verses in the Old Testament and 7,957 verses in the New Testament. This gives a total of 31,102 verses,&lt;ref name="blueletterbiblebooks"&gt;[https://www.blueletterbible.org/study/misc/66books.cfm Study Resources: The Books of the Bible] at BlueLetterBible.org&lt;/ref&gt; which is an average of a little more than 26 verses per chapter.
* Contrary to popular belief, Psalm 118 does not contain the middle verse of the Bible. The King James Version has an even number of verses (31,102), with the two middle verses being {{bibleverse||Psalm|103:1–2|KJV}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblebelievers.com/believers-org/kjv-stats.html King James Bible Statistics] at BibleBelievers.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleref|John|11:35|NASB}} ("[[Jesus wept]]") is the shortest verse in most English translations. Some translations — including the New International Version, New Living Translation, New Life Version, Holman Christian Standard Bible and New International Reader's Version — render {{bibleverse||Job|3:2|HE}} as "He said". However, that is a translators' condensation of the Hebrew which literally translated is: "And Job answered and said."
&lt;!-- non English stats --&gt;
* The shortest verse in the [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Greek New Testament]] is {{bibleverse||Luke|20:30|NASB}} ("και ο δευτερος", "And the second") with twelve letters, according to the [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott and Hort]] text. In the [[Textus Receptus]], the shortest verse is {{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|5:16|NASB}} ("παντοτε χαιρετε", "Rejoice always") with fourteen letters,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=5585 First Thessalonians 5:12–28], [[John Walvoord]] at Bible.org&lt;/ref&gt; since [[Robert Estienne|Stephanus]]' rendering of Luke 20:30 includes some additional words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybible.info/LXX_WH-IGNT-KJV/Luke%2020:30 Luke 20:30 και ο δευτερος – and the second] with interlinear Greek-English and KJV&lt;br&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2020:30&amp;version=TR1550;WHNU Luke 20:30], in the 1550 [[Robert Estienne|Stephanus]] New Testament and the 1881 [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott-Hort]] New Testament.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleref|Isaiah|10:8|ESV}} ("''Dicet enim''") is the shortest verse in the Latin [[Vulgate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinvulgate.com/verse.aspx?t=0&amp;b=27&amp;c=10 Isaias 10] at LatinVulgate.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleverse||Esther|8:9|ESV}} is the longest verse in the Masoretic Text. The discovery of several manuscripts at [[Qumran]] (in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]) has reopened what is considered the most original text of 1 Samuel 11; if one believes that those manuscripts better preserve the text, several verses in 1 Samuel 11 surpass Esther 8:9 in length.

[[File:Effectivenessofcontraceptives.png|thumb|450px|Effectiveness of contraceptive methods with respect to birth control. Only condoms are useful to prevent [[sexually transmitted infections]]]]There are many different methods of [[birth control]], which vary in what is required of the user, side effects, and effectiveness. It is also important to note that not each type of birth control is ideal for each user. Outlined here are the different types of barrier methods, [[spermicide]]s, or [[coitus interruptus]] that must be used at or before every act of intercourse. Immediate contraception, like physical barriers, include [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragms]], [[cervical cap|caps]], the [[contraceptive sponge]], and [[female condom]]s may be placed several hours before intercourse begins (note that when using the female condom, the penis must be guided into place when initiating intercourse). The female condom should be removed immediately after intercourse, and before arising.&lt;sup&gt;[[Comparison of birth control methods#cite note-CT19thEdCh19-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Some other female barrier methods must be left in place for several hours after sex. Depending on the form of spermicide used, they may be applied several minutes to an hour before intercourse begins. Additionally, the male condom should be applied when the penis is erect so that it is properly applied prior to intercourse.

With an insertion of an IUD (intrauterine device), female or male sterilization, or hormone implant, there is very little required of the user post initial procedure; there is nothing to put in place before intercourse to prevent pregnancy.&lt;sup&gt;[[Comparison of birth control methods#cite note-plannedparenthood.org-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Intrauterine methods require clinic visits for installation and removal or replacement (if desired) only once every several years (5-12), depending on the device. This allows the user to be able to try and become pregnant if they so desire, upon removal of the IUD. Conversely, sterilization is a one-time, permanent procedure. After the success of surgery is verified (for vasectomy), no subsequent action is usually required of users.

Implants provide effective birth control for three years without any user action between insertion and removal of the implant.  Insertion and removal of the Implant involves a minor surgical procedure. Oral contraceptives require some action every day. Other hormonal methods require less frequent action - weekly for the patch, twice a month for vaginal ring, monthly for combined injectable contraceptive, and every twelve weeks for [[Medroxyprogesterone acetate|MPA]] shots. Fertility awareness-based methods require some action every day to monitor and record fertility signs. The [[lactational amenorrhea method]] (LAM) requires breast feeding at least every four to six hours.

==User dependence==
Different methods require different levels of diligence by users.  Methods with little or nothing to do or remember, or that require a clinic visit less than once per year are said to be ''non-user dependent'', ''forgettable'' or ''top-tier'' methods.&lt;ref name="Hatcher20th"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hatcher |editor1-first=Robert A. |editor2-first=James |editor2-last=Trussell |editor3-first=Anita L. |editor3-last=Nelson | name-list-format = vanc |title=Contraceptive Technology |publisher=Ardent Media |location=New York |year=2011 |edition=20th |isbn=978-1-59708-004-0}}{{page needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intrauterine methods, implants and sterilization fall into this category.&lt;ref name="Hatcher20th" /&gt;  For methods that are not user dependent, the actual and perfect-use failure rates are very similar.

Many hormonal methods of birth control, and LAM require a moderate level of thoughtfulness. For many hormonal methods, clinic visits must be made every three months to a year to renew the prescription.  The pill must be taken every day, the patch must be reapplied weekly, or the ring must be replaced monthly.  Injections are required every 12 weeks.  The rules for LAM must be followed every day.  Both LAM and hormonal methods provide a reduced level of protection against pregnancy if they are occasionally used incorrectly (rarely going longer than 4–6 hours between breastfeeds, a late pill or injection, or forgetting to replace a patch or ring on time).  The actual failure rates for LAM and hormonal methods are somewhat higher than the perfect-use failure rates.

Higher levels of user commitment are required for other methods.&lt;ref name=WHOTable&gt;{{cite report|title = Helping women understand contraceptive effectiveness | first1 = Kathleen Henry | last1 = Shears | first2 = Kerry Wright | last2 = Aradhya | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.fhi.org/NR/rdonlyres/eoabicg5w53xarcybsiefba5ruvr6r2dnkws7vj2hr3ndzv225gkvw2oxtkdlxzcl5yr3q3iok4kid/Mera08091.pdf | date = July 2008 | publisher = Family Health International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrier methods, coitus interruptus, and spermicides must be used at every act of intercourse.   Fertility awareness-based methods may require daily tracking of the menstrual cycle. The actual failure rates for these methods may be much higher than the perfect-use failure rates.&lt;ref name="trussell2007body"&gt;{{cite book | last =Trussell | first = James |editor1-last=Hatcher |editor1-first=Robert A. |editor2-first=James |editor2-last=Trussell |editor3-first=Anita L. |editor3-last=Nelson | name-list-format = vanc |year=2007 |chapter=Contraceptive Efficacy |title=Contraceptive Technology |edition=19th |pages= |location=New York |publisher=Ardent Media |isbn=0-9664902-0-7 |chapterurl=http://www.contraceptivetechnology.org/table.html}}{{page needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- NOTE: this reference is to the same work as is referred to in the table, but the table has a separate reference list, so do not remove the body of this reference --&gt;

==Side effects==
Different forms of birth control have different potential side effects.  Not all, or even most, users will experience side effects from a method.

The less effective the method, the greater the risk of the side-effects associated with pregnancy.

Minimal or no other side effects are possible with coitus interruptus, fertility awareness-based, and LAM. Some forms of periodic abstinence encourage examination of the cervix; insertion of the fingers into the vagina to perform this examination may cause changes in the vaginal environment. Following the rules for LAM may delay a woman's first post-partum menstruation beyond what would be expected from different breastfeeding practices.

Barrier methods have a risk of allergic reaction.  Users sensitive to latex may use barriers made of less allergenic materials - polyurethane condoms, or silicone diaphragms, for example.  Barrier methods are also often combined with spermicides, which have possible side effects of genital irritation, vaginal infection, and urinary tract infection.

Sterilization procedures are generally considered to have low risk of side effects, though some persons and organizations disagree.&lt;!--

After IUD insertion, users may experience irregular periods in the first 3–6 months with Mirena, and sometimes heavier periods and worse menstrual cramps with ParaGard.  However, "ninety-nine percent of IUD users are pleased with them".  A positive characteristic of IUDs is that fertility and the ability to become pregnant returns quickly once the IUD is removed.&lt;ref name="plannedparenthood.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/iud-4245.htm|title=Planned Parenthood IUD Birth Control - Mirena IUD - ParaGard IUD|work=|accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Because of their systemic nature, hormonal methods have the largest number of possible side effects.&lt;!--

===Sexually transmitted disease prevention===

{{main article|safe sex}}

[[condom|Male]] and [[female condom]]s provide significant protection against [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STD) when used consistently and correctly.  They also provide some protection against [[cervical cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Winer RL, Hughes JP, Feng Q, O'Reilly S, Kiviat NB, Holmes KK, Koutsky LA | title = Condom use and the risk of genital human papillomavirus infection in young women | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 354 | issue = 25 | pages = 2645–54 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16790697 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa053284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogewoning2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hogewoning CJ, Bleeker MC, van den Brule AJ, Voorhorst FJ, Snijders PJ, Berkhof J, Westenend PJ, Meijer CJ | title = Condom use promotes regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and clearance of human papillomavirus: a randomized clinical trial | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 107 | issue = 5 | pages = 811–6 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14566832 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.11474 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Condoms are often recommended as an adjunct to more effective birth control methods (such as [[IUD]]) in situations where STD protection is also desired.&lt;ref name=DualProtection&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cates W, Steiner MJ | title = Dual protection against unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections: what is the best contraceptive approach? | journal = Sexually Transmitted Diseases | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 168–74 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11875378 | doi = 10.1097/00007435-200203000-00007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other barrier methods, such as [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] may provide limited protection against infections in the upper genital tract.  Other methods provide little or no protection against sexually transmitted diseases.

==Effectiveness calculation==
Failure rates may be calculated by either the [[Pearl Index]] or a [[decrement table|life table method]].  A "perfect-use" rate is where any rules of the method are rigorously followed, and (if applicable) the method is used at every act of intercourse.

Actual failure rates are higher than perfect-use rates for a variety of reasons:
* mistakes on the part of those providing instructions on how to use the method
* mistakes on the part of the method's users
* conscious user non-compliance with method.
* insurance providers sometimes impede access to medications (e.g. require prescription refills on a monthly basis)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trussell J, Wynn LL | title = Reducing unintended pregnancy in the United States | journal = Contraception | volume = 77 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18082659 | doi = 10.1016/j.contraception.2007.09.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, someone using oral forms of hormonal birth control might be given incorrect information by a health care provider as to the frequency of intake, or for some reason not take the pill one or several days, or not go to the pharmacy on time to renew the prescription, or the pharmacy might be unwilling to provide enough pills to cover an extended absence.

==Effectiveness==
The table below color codes the '''typical-use''' and '''perfect-use''' [[failure rate]]s, where the failure rate is measured as the expected number of pregnancies per year per woman using the method:
:{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background:#e0ffff"
| style="text-align:right;"| Blue || style="text-align:right;"| under &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1% || lower risk
|- style="background:#e0ffe0"
| style="text-align:right;"| Green || style="text-align:right;"| up to &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5% ||  
|- style="background:#ffffc0"
| style="text-align:right;"| Yellow || style="text-align:right;"| up to 10% ||   
|- style="background:#fda;"
| style="text-align:right;"| Orange || style="text-align:right;"| up to 20% || 
|- style="background:#fcc;"
| style="text-align:right;"| Red || style="text-align:right;"| over 20% || higher risk
|- style="background:#dcdcdc"
| style="text-align:right;"| Grey || style="text-align:right;"| no data || no data available
|}

For example, a failure rate of 20% means that 20 of 100 women become pregnant during the first year of use. Note that the rate may go above 100% if all women, on average, become pregnant within less than a year. In the degenerated case of all women becoming pregnant instantly, the rate would be infinite.

In the '''user action required''' column, items that are ''non-user dependent'' (require action once per year or less) also have a blue background.

Some methods may be used simultaneously for higher effectiveness rates. For example, using condoms with spermicides the estimated perfect use failure rate would be comparable to the perfect use failure rate of the implant.&lt;ref name="Hatcher20th" /&gt;  However, mathematically combining the rates to estimate the effectiveness of combined methods can be inaccurate, as the effectiveness of each method is not necessarily independent, except in the perfect case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kestelman P, Trussell J | title = Efficacy of the simultaneous use of condoms and spermicides | journal = Family Planning Perspectives | volume = 23 | issue = 5 | pages = 226–7, 232 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1743276 | doi = 10.2307/2135759 | jstor = 2135759 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a method is known or suspected to have been ineffective, such as a condom breaking, [[emergency contraception]] (ECP) may be taken up to 72 to 120 hours after [[sexual intercourse]]. Emergency contraception should be taken shortly before or as soon after intercourse as possible, as its efficacy decreases with increasing delay.  Although ECP is considered an emergency measure, levonorgestrel ECP taken shortly before sex may be used as a primary method for woman who have sex only a few times a year and want a hormonal method, but don’t want to take hormones all the time.&lt;ref name=shelton&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shelton JD | title = Repeat emergency contraception: facing our fears | journal = Contraception | volume = 66 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–7 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12169375 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-7824(02)00313-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Failure rate of repeated or regular use of LNG ECP is similar to rate for those using a barrier method.&lt;ref name="WHO ECP Effectiveness"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Efficacy and side effects of immediate postcoital levonorgestrel used repeatedly for contraception.

By comparison, in the US, method related costs vary from nothing to about $1,000 for a year or more of reversible contraception.

During the initial five years, vasectomy is comparable in cost to the IUD. Vasectomy is much less expensive and safer than tubal ligation.

Since ecological breastfeeding and fertility awareness are behavioral they cost nothing or a small amount upfront for a thermometer and / or training. Fertility awareness based methods can be used throughout a woman's reproductive lifetime.

Not using contraceptives is the most expensive option. While in that case there are no method related costs, it has the highest failure rate, and thus the highest failure related costs. Even if one only considers medical costs relating to preconception care and birth, any method of contraception saves money compared to using no method.

The most effective and the most cost-effective methods are long-acting methods. Unfortunately these methods often have significant up-front costs, requiring the user to pay a portion of these costs prevents some from using more effective methods.&lt;ref name=Cleland&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cleland K, Peipert JF, Westhoff C, Spear S, Trussell J | title = Family planning as a cost-saving preventive health service | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 364 | issue = 18 | pages = e37 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21506736 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1104373 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contraception saves money for the public health system and insurers.

[[Image:The Encyclopædic Dictionary.jpg|right|thumb|Title page from the 1894 four volume version of [[Robert Hunter (Encyclopædist)|Robert Hunter]]'s ''The Encyclopædic Dictionary''.]]
An '''encyclopedic dictionary''' typically includes a large number of short listings, arranged alphabetically, and discussing a wide range of topics.  Encyclopedic dictionaries can be general, containing articles on topics in many different fields; or they can specialize in a particular field, such as art, biography, law, medicine, or philosophy. They may also be organized around a particular academic, cultural, ethnic, or national perspective.

Historically, the term has been used to refer to any encyclopedic reference book (that is, one comprehensive in scope), which was organized alphabetically, as with the familiar dictionary.  (The term ''dictionary'' preceded ''encyclopedia'' in common usage by about two centuries.)  To convey their alphabetic method of organization and to contrast that method with other systems for classifying knowledge, many early encyclopedias were titled or sub-titled "a dictionary of arts and sciences" or something similar.

However, it later developed into a somewhat distinct class of reference books. While there are similarities to both dictionaries and encyclopedias, there are important distinctions as well:  

* A dictionary is primarily focused on words and their definition, and typically provides limited information, analysis of different forms, and an etymology (in more complete dictionaries) for the word defined.  Hence, while it may offer a definition, it may leave the reader still lacking in understanding the meaning or import of a term, and how the term relates to a broader field of knowledge.  
* An encyclopedia, on the other hand, seeks to discuss each subject in more depth and convey the accumulated knowledge on that subject.  This characteristic is especially true of those encyclopedias with long monographs on particular subjects, such as the first ten editions of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.  While often organized alphabetically, some encyclopedias were not.  Usually, more of the discussion may be organized around a field (such as law) or a topic (such as the Scottish enlightenment), and less on the alphabetic terminology related to that discussion.  An encyclopedia also often includes many maps and illustrations, as well as bibliography and statistics.

Compared to a dictionary, the encyclopedic dictionary offers a more complete description and a choice of entries selected to convey a range of knowledge.  Compared to an encyclopedia, the encyclopedic dictionary offers ease of use, through summarized entries and in some cases more entries of separate terms; and often reduced size, and the reduced publishing and purchase cost that implies.

The question of how to structure the entries, and how much information to include, are among the core issues in organizing reference books.  As different approaches are better suited to different uses or users, all three approaches have been in wide use since the end of the 18th century.

The title of the volume may not be a good indication of which type of reference it is, as commercial concerns may have affected the publisher's selection of a title.

== History ==
[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary 054.jpg|thumb|Illustration of [[fossil]]s from Brockhaus and Efron's ''Encyclopedic Dictionary'' (1890—1907)]]

The encyclopedic dictionary evolved from the dictionary.  John Harris subtitled his landmark ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' a "universal English dictionary of Arts and Sciences"; it was the first English-language, alphabetically ordered collection of knowledge.

The 18th-century encyclopedists, in turn, dramatically expanded the depth and, in some cases, substantially revised the organization of the encyclopedic dictionary to create the early major encyclopedias, the French ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' and later the British ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.  However, such comprehensive works were costly and difficult to produce, and to keep current; and the detailed entries were not ideal for some reference uses.  The first version of the German ''[[Conversations-Lexikon mit vorzüglicher Rücksicht auf die gegenwärtigen Zeiten|Conversations-Lexikon]]'' (1796–1808) was just 2,762 pages in six volumes, and while that work was later expanded, its format using numerous, less lengthy entries served as the principal model for many 19th-century encyclopedias and encyclopedic dictionaries. 

The principal English-language encyclopaedic dictionary of the nineteenth century was the 7-volume in 14 eponymous work by Robert Hunter (1823–1897), published by Cassell in 1879–88, and reprinted many times up to 1910, including (1895) as the mass-circulation ''Lloyd's Encyclopaedic Dictionary''. Hunter was assisted by zoology author Henry Scherren and a small team of domestic assistants at his house in Loughton. In the US, the dictionary was reissued with a variety of titles.

The '''Estonian Free Party''' ({{lang-et|Eesti Vabaerakond}}) is an [[Estonia]]n  [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] political party founded in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31681293|title=Estonia ruling party wins election|date=2015-03-02|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chairman of the party is [[Kaul Nurm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vabaerakond valis uueks esimeheks Kaul Nurme |url=https://www.err.ee/865342/fotod-vabaerakond-valis-uueks-esimeheks-kaul-nurme |language= Estonian |website=[[Eesti Rahvusringhääling|ERR]] |access-date=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party gained 8 seats after passing the 5-percent threshold in the [[Estonian parliamentary election, 2015|2015 Estonian parliamentary elections]].

==History==
The [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] Estonian Free Party Founding Group was founded in January 2014. Originally it was to be founded by two organizations, [[Free Patriotic Citizen]] and [[Better Estonia]], but the latter decided to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.delfi.ee/news/paevauudised/eesti/vik-ja-parem-eesti-asutavad-uue-erakonna-loomiseks-mtu?id=67666033 |title= VIK ja Parem Eesti asutavad uue erakonna loomiseks MTÜ |date= 23 January 2014 |publisher= [[Delfi (web portal)|Delfi]] |language= Estonian |access-date= 20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://uudised.err.ee/v/eesti/2f004fa6-0c0a-47f1-9dff-cee0f907bee9 |title= Ühenduste Vaba Isamaaline Kodanik ja Parem Eesti teed läksid lahku |date= 17 February 2014 |first=Merili |last=Nael |publisher= [[Eesti Rahvusringhääling]] |language= Estonian |access-date= 20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estonian Free Party was officially established on 20 September 2014, and [[Andres Herkel]] was elected as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.postimees.ee/2927133/vabaerakond-valis-esimeheks-andres-herkeli |title= Vabaerakond valis esimeheks Andres Herkeli |date= 20 September 2014 |publisher= [[Postimees]] |language= Estonian |access-date= 20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party attracted numerous public figures, including former head of the [[Estonia Defence Forces|Defense Forces]] Admiral [[Tarmo Kõuts]], actor [[Ain Lutsepp]], and [[Jüri Adams]], a former government minister who was one of the main writers of the [[Constitution of Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.err.ee/v/politics/ad3cd7e3-9244-48ce-986d-571c9894221a |title= Free Party Made Official |date= 8 October 2014 |publisher= [[Eesti Rahvusringhääling]] |access-date= 20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Estonian parliamentary election, 2015|2015 Estonian parliamentary elections]], the Estonian Free Party received 49,883 votes, constituting 8.7 percent of the total, which garnered it 8 seats in the 101-member parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.postimees.ee/3108019/reform-wins-estonia-s-parlt-elections-six-parties-secure-seats |title= Reform wins Estonia's parlt elections, six parties secure seats |date= 2 March 2015 |publisher= [[Postimees]] |access-date= 20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Estonian Free Party's candidate for [[Prime Minister of Estonia|prime minister]], [[Artur Talvik]], who received the most votes of all the Estonian Free Party candidates, was not a member of the party himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.err.ee/v/politics/78db7ea2-ea01-48f1-a5ea-8864d25813bc |title= Rõivas most popular PM candidate |date= 23 February 2015 |first=Juhan-Markus |last=Laats |publisher= [[Eesti Rahvusringhääling]] |access-date= 22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="soonvald"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.delfi.ee/news/riigikogu2015/videod/video-vabaerakonna-parteitu-esikoneleja-artur-talvik-meile-uritati-oosel-pai-teha-sest-arvatakse-et-oleme-lihtne-partner?id=70915651 |title= VIDEO: Vabaerakonna parteitu esikõneleja Artur Talvik: meile üritati öösel pai teha, sest arvatakse, et oleme lihtne partner |date= 2 March 2015 |first=Urmo |last=Soonvald |publisher= [[Delfi (web portal)|Delfi]] |language= Estonian |access-date= 22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Estonian Free Party participated in coalition talks together with the [[Estonian Reform Party]], [[Social Democratic Party (Estonia)|Social Democratic Party]], and [[Pro Patria and Res Publica Union]], but were left out of the coalition because their proposals to change the tax system were considered unacceptable. The Estonian Reform Party's unwillingness to reduce the state funding for political parties was cited as an issue by the Estonian Free Party.&lt;ref name="tambur"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.err.ee/v/politics/9a422178-b0ea-461e-b208-7ead215b88cd |title= Coalition talks to continue between three parties, Free Party to go into opposition |date= 23 March 2015 |first=Silver |last=Tambur |publisher= [[Eesti Rahvusringhääling]] |access-date= 20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==
Commentators have argued, that the Estonian Free Party lacks a clear ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://epl.delfi.ee/news/eesti/on-keegi-nainud-vabaerakond-otsib-oma-maailmavaadet?id=72205049 |title= On keegi näinud?

The party advocates raising the personal [[income tax]], while on the other hand also raising the non-taxable basic exemption to support the poorer majority of taxpayers. The party's program also includes increased taxes on alcohol, tobacco, and confectionery. In economic policy, the party supports a relatively liberal approach, especially to support small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://uudised.err.ee/v/eesti/eab2aebb-cccd-4e68-94a4-f000035e8b03 |title= Galerii: Vabaerakond kinnitas valimisprogrammi ja nimekirjad |date= 11 January 2015 |first=Allan |last=Rajavee |publisher= [[Eesti Rahvusringhääling]] |language= Estonian |access-date= 22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party has advocated reduction of state funding of political parties.&lt;ref name="tambur"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3665">The '''European Thesaurus on International Relations and Area Studies''' (abbreviated: European Thesaurus) is a multilingual, interdisciplinary [[thesaurus]] covering the subject fields of [[International Relations]] and [[Area Studies]]. The European Thesaurus consists of about 8.200 [[Index term|descriptors]] organised in 24 subdomains. To enhance the access to the thesaurus’ controlled vocabulary the descriptors are arranged both alphabetically as well as systematically. The semantic relationships (equivalence, hierarchy, association) between all individual descriptors have been established. The European Thesaurus is intended to be used primarily in bibliographic databases for [[Subject indexing|indexing]] and [[Information retrieval|retrieval]] of professional literature from the relevant domains. The European Thesaurus can, in addition, even serve as a terminological reference work and/or as a translation tool in international affairs matters.

The European Thesaurus was developed by an international working group in the framework of a terminology cooperation project carried out by the European Information Network on International Relations and Area Studies (EINIRAS).

The European Thesaurus is available in nine languages: Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian, Spanish. A Greek version is currently being translated.

At present the European Thesaurus is applied by academic organisations and research institutes in Germany  (German Information Network International Relations and Area Studies – database ''World Affairs Online'' –), the Czech Republic ([[Institute of International Relations Prague]]) and Poland (Polish Institute of International Affairs, Warsaw). The European Thesaurus is updated regularly.

The European Thesaurus is publicly accessible via the academic internet portal IREON (''International RElations and area studies ONline'').

==Background==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}Western Mining Corporation was selling its 40% stake in the Kupe gas field, for which Fletcher Challenge Energy and Electricity Corporation were interesting in buying. ECNZ was particularly interested as it was planning to convert the Huntly power station with gas.

Both companies entered into an agreement that if one of them purchased the WMC share, that they would split the gas between them.

The contract was called a Heads of Agreement (HoA), but it left several matters unresolved, "to use all reasonable endeavors to agree to a full sale and purchase agreement within 3 months of the date of this agreement".

Later however, after a substantial drop in power prices, ECNZ decided to not convert the power plant.

As a result, FCE applied successfully to the High Court to make ECNZ enter into an agreement with them. ECNZ defended the issue on the basis that there was lack of certainty making the contract unenforceable.

==Held==
The court of appeal ruled that there was not a legally binding contract

{{distinguish|GNSS navigation software}}
A '''software GNSS receiver''' is a [[Global navigation satellite system|GNSS]] receiver that has been designed and implemented following the philosophy of [[Software-defined radio]].

A GNSS receiver, in general, is an electronic device that receives and digitally processes the signals from a GNSS satellite constellation in order to provide position, velocity and time (of the receiver).

GNSS receivers have been traditionally implemented in hardware: a ''hardware GNSS receiver'' is conceived as a dedicated chip that have been designed and built (from the very beginning) with the only purpose of being a GNSS receiver.

In a software GNSS receiver, all digital processing is performed by a general purpose [[microprocessor]]. In this approach, a small amount of inexpensive hardware is still needed, known as the ''[[RF front end|frontend]]'', that digitizes the signal from the satellites. The microprocessor can then work on this ''raw'' digital stream to implement the GNSS functionality.

== Hardware vs. software GNSS receivers==
When comparing ''hardware'' vs ''software'' GNSS receivers, a number of pros and cons can be found for each approach:

* Hardware GNSS receivers are in general more efficient from the point of view of both computational load and power consumption since they have been designed in a highly specialized way with the only purpose of implementing the GNSS processing.
* Software GNSS receivers allow a huge flexibility: many features of the receiver can be modified just through software. This provides the receiver with adaptive capabilities, depending on the user's needs and working conditions. In addition, the receiver can be easily upgraded via software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/receiver-design/real-time-software-receivers-8812 Real-Time Software Receivers], GPS World, September 1, 2009 by Pierre-André Farine, Marcel Baracchi-Frei, Grégoire Waelchli, Cyril Botteron&lt;/ref&gt;
* Under some assumptions, Software GNSS receivers can be more profitable for some applications, as long as sufficient computational power is available (and can be shared among multiple applications). For example, the microprocessor of a [[smartphone]] can be used to provide GNSS navigation with the only need of including a frontend (instead of a full, more expensive, hardware receiver).

Currently, most of the GNSS receiver market is still ''hardware''. However, there already exist operational solutions based on the software approach able to run on low-cost microprocessors. Software GNSS receivers are expected to increase their market share or even take over in the near future, following the development of the computational capabilities of the microprocessors ([[Moore's law]]).

&lt;/ref&gt;
The archive encourages education of and research by anyone interested in learning about any aspects of the LGBT community.  The organization sponsors meetings for the dissemination of information and display of collected materials.

==History==
GCAM began meeting in July 1999 and officially incorporated in May 2000.  The initial opening of the museum doors occurred Friday, June 16, 2000, in a small shared warehouse space on Capitol Street.
&lt;ref name=formed/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2005, GCAM officially closed its museum to focus on preserving the history of the community.

&lt;/ref&gt;
Later, GCAM moved into an office at the Montrose Center with an ongoing exhibit space there on the public walls of the space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11536">'''JT''' (Jupiter Tesselation) is an ISO-standardized 3D data format and is in industry used for [[product visualization]], [[collaboration]], [[CAD data exchange]], and in some also for long-term data retention. It can contain any combination of approximate (faceted) data, boundary representation surfaces ([[NURBS]]), [[Product Manufacturing Information|Product and Manufacturing Information]] (PMI), and [[Metadata]] (textual attributes) either exported from the native [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] system or inserted by a [[Product data management|product data management (PDM)]] system.

== Overview ==
JT files are used in product lifecycle management (PLM) software programs and their respective CAD solutions, by engineers and other professionals that need to analyze the geometry of complex products. The format and associated software is structured so that extremely large numbers of components can be quickly loaded, shaded and manipulated in real-time. Because all major 3D CAD formats are supported, a JT assembly can contain a mixture of any combination which has led to the term "multi-CAD".  As JT is typically implemented as an integral part of a PLM solution, the resulting multi-CAD assembly is managed such that changes to the original CAD product definition files can be automatically synchronized with their associated JT files resulting in a multi-CAD assembly that is always up-to-date.

Because JT files are inherently "lightweight" (~1-10% of the size of a CAD file) they are ideal for internet collaboration.  With the growing trend toward globalization, more companies are leveraging resources wherever they are available in the world.  Collaboration using JT allows companies to send 3D visualization data to suppliers and partners much more easily than sending the associated "heavy" CAD files.  In addition, real-time, on-line collaboration is easier because the amount of information sent back-and-forth across the internet is reduced.  Finally, JT provides an inherent security feature such that intellectual property does not have to be shared with inappropriate parties.  As indicated above, JT can contain any combination of data such that the right amount of information can be shared without exposing the underlying proprietary design definition information.

JT is often used for [[Digital mockup]] (DMU) work, which allows engineers to validate that a product can be assembled without interferences long before a physical prototype could be produced. This "spatial validation" is enabled by precise measurements and cross-sectioning as well as sophisticated clearance/interference detection. Leveraging JT for digital mockup allows users to reduce or eliminate costly physical prototypes and enables decision-making to occur much earlier in the development process.

Finally, JT is used as a [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] interoperability format for exchanging design data for [[Collaborative Product Development]], where JT files are created by translating data from CAD systems such as [[NX (Unigraphics)]], [[Creo Elements/Pro]], [[I-DEAS]], [[Solid Edge]], [[CATIA|Catia]], [[Microstation]] or [[Autodesk Inventor]].

== History and status in standardization ==
JT was originally developed by [[Engineering Animation, Inc.]] and [[Hewlett Packard]] as the DirectModel toolkit (initially Jupiter). JT is the abbreviation for Jupiter Tesselation. When EAI was purchased by [[UGS Corp.]], JT became a part of UGS’s suite of products. Early in 2007 UGS announced the publication of the JT data format easing the adoption of JT as a master 3D format. Also in 2007, UGS was acquired by [[Siemens AG]] and became [[Siemens PLM Software]]. JT is the common interoperability format in use across all of Siemens PLM Software and has been adopted as the long term data archival format across all of Siemens.

On 2009 September 18 the [[ISO]] stated officially that the JT specification has been accepted for publication as an ISO Publicly Available Specification (PAS). End of August 2010 the Ballot for the new Work Item Proposal for JT as ISO International Standard was started by [[ProSTEP iViP]]. ProSTEP iViP thereby aimed on the one hand to publish the JT file format specification as ISO Standard and, on the other hand, to harmonize this undertaking with the new [http://www.ap242.org/ STEP AP 242] development, so that JT and [[ISO 10303|STEP]] (especially STEP AP 242 XML) can be used together to assure major benefits within industrial data exchange scenarios.
 
On 2012 December, JT has been officially published as ISO 14306:2012 (ISO JT V1)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=60572  ISO 14306:2012 - JT file format specification for 3D visualization.], as 15. December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; as a 3D visualization format, based on version 9.5 of JT specifications released by Siemens PLM Software. Through this publication via ISO, for the first time a completely neutral and royalty-free specification of JT was available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&amp;objId=17010889&amp;objAction=Open&amp;nexturl=%2Flivelink%2Flivelink%3Ffunc%3Dll%26objId%3D17011200%26objAction%3Dbrowse%26viewType%3D1 JT Patent Statement and Licensing Declaration], as of 23 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning of 2013, in ISO the specification of ISO JT V2 was started. The ISO/DIS 14306 V2&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=62770 ISO/DIS 14306 V2 - JT file format specification for 3D visualization.], as 27 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; was accepted by ISO in November 2016. The publication as ISO International Standard is expected within the first half of 2017. Main difference between V1 and V2 is the incorporation of a STEP B-rep as an additional B-rep segment.

For providing additional functionalities and innovations required by industry, [[ProSTEP iViP]] and [[Verband der Automobilindustrie|VDA]] decided mid of 2015 to specify a so-called JT Industrial Application Package (JTIAP),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prostep.org/de/mediathek/veroeffentlichungen/empfehlungen-standards.html#c1064 PSI 14-1: JT Industrial Application Package.], as 30 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a JT file format specification completely compatible to ISO 14306 (V1 as well as the future V2) and currently existing JT-Open-based implementations. Thereby, JTIAP provide a more comprehensive compression algorithm ([[Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm|LZMA]]), specifies XT B-rep as recommended representation of exact geometry and allows the neutral and royalty-free implementation of JT.

== Large model rendering ==
JT was created to support the interactive display of very large [[assembly modelling|assemblies]] (i.e. those containing tens of thousands of components). The JT file format is capable of storing an arbitrary number of faceted representations with varying levels of detail (LODs). When the whole product is displayed on the computer screen the hosting application displays only a simple, coarse, model. However, as the user zooms into a particular area, progressively finer representations are loaded and displayed. Over time, unused representations are unloaded to save memory.

== Data model ==
The JT data model is capable of representing a wide range of engineering data. This data can be very lightweight, holding little more than facet data or it can be quite rich, containing complete NURBS geometry representations along with product structure, attributes, meta data and [[Product Manufacturing Information|PMI]]. It also supports multiple tessellations and level-of-detail (LOD) generation.

* Product Structure - assembly, part, instance
* Facet - polygon, polygon set
* Lighting - light set, point light, infinite light
* Textures
* Precise Geometry and Topology - point, curve, surface, face, loop, edge, vertex
* Boundary representation (B-rep) could used either JT B-rep and XT B-rep (Parasolid) format, STEP B-rep will be supported by ISO JT V2
* Geometry Primitives - [[box]], [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], [[pyramid]], [[sphere]]
* [[Product Manufacturing Information]] (PMI) - [[GD&amp;T]], 3D annotations
* Attributes / Properties - text, integer, float, date, layers

== File structure ==
The relationship of product structure hierarchy to exported JT file structure is arbitrary. Any node in the hierarchy may be specified as the start of a new JT file. Thus, product structure may be represented in a variety of JT file configurations.

JT supports common product structure-to-file structure mappings. These include: 
* Per part - All assembly nodes in a product structure hierarchy are stored in a single JT file, and each part node in the hierarchy is stored in an individual JT file in a subdirectory that is of the same name as the assembly JT file. 
* Fully shattered - Each product structure node in the hierarchy is stored in an individual JT file. 
* Monolithic - All product structure is stored in a single JT file.
* PLMXML - An open XML-based file format, specified by [[Siemens PLM Software]]. A PLMXML-structure could link to the model data in another file (an External Representation), or the data can be embedded within the Representation element in the XML file (an InternalRepresentation). 
* STEP AP 242 XML - An ISO Standard, with allows to represent assembly, meta, kinematic data etc. and to link to the model data as external references (leaves on a STEP-tree). In global automotive industry, for realizing cross-company data exchange scenarios the application of STEP AP 242 XML and JT is recommended.
Client applications may use these mappings, or choose to define their own custom mapping.

== Compression ==
To help shrink the storage and transmission bandwidth requirements of 3D models, JT files may take advantage of compression. Use of compression is transparent to the user of the JT data, and a given model may be composed of JT files using different compression settings (including none).

To date, the JT file format has evolved through two forms of compression, exposed in JT Open Toolkit as standard and advanced compression. These differ in that the former employs a simple, [[lossless compression]] algorithm, while the latter employs a more sophisticated, domain-specific compression scheme supporting lossy geometry compression. Client applications are encouraged to take advantage of advanced compression over standard compression, as attainable compression ratios are much greater. Support for standard compression is maintained only in the interest of backward compatibility with legacy JT file viewing applications.

The compression form used by a JT file is related to the JT file format version in which it was written. This version is readily viewable by opening a JT file in a text editor and looking at its ASCII header information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3762">'''John Russell Harper''', [[Order of Canada|OC]], [[Royal Society of Canada|FRSC]] (April 13, 1914 &amp;ndash; November 17, 1983) was an eminent [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Art history|art historian]] who is considered to have pioneered the field of art history in Canada.

Harper was born at [[Caledonia, Ontario]] and worked for some time as a primary school teacher before studying at the Ontario School of Art from 1938 to 1940. During [[World War II]] he served, alongside his future wife Mary Elizabeth Goodchild, as a [[radar]] mechanic for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] in Canada and England. After the war, he enrolled at the [[University of Toronto]] and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1948 and an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1950 in art and archeology.

In the 1950s, he became the chief cataloguer of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], and in 1951, he moved to [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], to work for the [[New Brunswick Museum]].

After archaeological fieldwork for the Department of [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada]], he reported in 1959 on the potential for restoration of the fortress at [[Louisbourg, Nova Scotia]].

From 1959 to 1963, he was the curator of Canadian art at the [[National Gallery of Canada]], and from 1965 to 1968 the chief curator of the McCord Museum of [[McGill University]]. From 1965 until his retirement in 1979 he lectured as a professor of art history at [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]].

Beginning in the 1960s, he specialized in the study of Canadian painting. His 1966 ''Painting in Canada: a History'' was the first comprehensive overview of the field. Subsequent works include the ground-breaking studies on [[Paul Kane]] (''Paul Kane's Frontier'', 1971) and [[Cornelius Krieghoff]] (''Krieghoff'', 1979). His later interests centred on Canadian [[folk art]].

Harper was a member of the board of the Journal of Canadian Art History from 1974 through 1983, and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Literature from the [[University of Guelph]] in 1972 and Doctor of Fine Arts from the [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University]] in 1982.  Among other awards he was made a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] in 1974; and also in that year became an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]].

[[File:Josephine Butler - portrait.jpg|thumb|In 1901 Josephine Butler wrote "There is a new edition of ''Who's Who''&amp;nbsp;– in which I see put down a list of things I have written, &amp; it appals me even to read it! No wonder I am tired."&lt;ref name="UoL: Biblio" /&gt;]]

[[Josephine Butler]] (1828–1906) was an English [[feminism|feminist]] and [[social reform]]er in the [[Victorian era]]. She was especially concerned with the welfare of [[prostitute]]s although she campaigned on a broad range of [[women's rights]]. In 1864 her daughter Eva fell {{convert|40|ft|m}} from the top-floor bannister onto the stone floor of the hallway in her home; she died three hours later.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|pp=45–46}} The death led Butler to begin a career of campaigning that ran until the end of her life; she later wrote that after the death she "became possessed with an irresistible urge to go forth and find some pain keener than my own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself.&amp;nbsp;... It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool."{{sfn|Butler|1892|p=183}} Her targets included [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|obtaining the vote]], the right to better education and the end of [[coverture]] in British law, although she achieved her greatest success in leading the movement to repeal the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]], legislation that attempted to control the spread of [[Sexually transmitted infection|venereal diseases]], particularly in the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy]]. She was also opposed to the forced medical examination of prostitutes—a process she described as "surgical" or "steel rape".{{sfn|Summers|1999|p=1}}{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} Her campaigning led to the suspension of the practice in April 1883, and the Acts were formally repealed in three years later.{{sfnm|1a1=Jordan|1y=2001|1pp=213–15|2a1=Mathers|2y=2014|2pp=141–43}}

Butler's first full-length publication was ''Memoir of John Grey of Dilston'', detailing the life of her father, [[John Grey (land agent)|John Grey]], which she wrote following his death.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=89}} She also wrote a [[monograph]] of her husband [[George Butler (1819–1890)|George]] in 1892 after his death two years previously.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=259}} In 1878 Butler published a third biography, this time of [[Catherine of Siena|Catharine of Siena]], which Glen Petrie—Butler's biographer—wrote was probably her best work.{{sfn|Petrie|1971|p=185}} Another historian, Judith Walkowitz, considers the work as providing Butler with a "historical justification for her own political activism".{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} Over a period of at least 40 years Butler wrote over 90 books and pamphlets, mostly in support of her campaigning work; because of her campaigning on mainland Europe, some of Butler's works—based on her speeches—were written in French and German, and were published in France, Germany and Switzerland.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}}{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=117}}

{{original research|date=April 2014}}
'''Kvenland''', known as ''Cwenland'', ''Qwenland'', ''Kænland'' or similar terms in medieval sources, is an ancient name for an area in [[Fennoscandia]] and [[Scandinavia]]. Kvenland, in that or nearly that spelling, is known from an [[Old English language|Old English]] account written in the 9th century, which used the information provided by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] adventurer and traveler [[Ohthere of Hålogaland|Ohthere]], and from [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] sources, primarily [[Iceland]]ic. One possible additional source was written in the modern-day area of [[Norway]] &amp;mdash; all the known Nordic sources date to the 12th and 13th centuries. Other possible references to Kvenland by other names or spellings are also discussed on this page.

==Old English Orosius==
A Norwegian adventurer and traveler named [[Ohthere of Hålogaland|Ohthere]] visited [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|England]] around 890 CE. [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred of Wessex]] had his stories written down and included them in his [[Old English language|Old English]] version of a world history written by the [[Hispania Tarraconensis|Romano-Hispanic]] author [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. Ohthere's story contains the only contemporary description about Kvenland that has survived from the 9th century:&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/iallt2003/oldenglish/OEparagraph-5.html Online edition of Ohthere's description of Kvenland]. A more faithful edition of the original text is in Thorpe, B., ''The Life of Alfred The Great Translated From The German of Dr. R. Pauli To Which Is Appended Alfred's Anglo-Saxon Version of Orosius'', Bell, 1900, pp. 250-52. Note that in translations here the names of places, countries and people have been harmonized to forms used in Wikipedia, while forms used in the text are presented in parentheses.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Ohthere] said that the Norwegians' (Norðmanna) land was very long and very narrow ... and to the east are wild mountains, parallel to the cultivated land. Finnas inhabit these mountains ... Then along this land southwards, on the other side of the mountain (''sic''), is [[Sweden]] ... and along that land northwards, Kvenland (Cwenaland). The Kvens (Cwenas) sometimes make depredations on the Northmen over the mountain, and sometimes the Northmen on them; there are very large [freshwater] [[wikt:mere|meres]] amongst the mountains,&lt;ref name=geond_da_moras&gt;Given the context, "geond", with a range of possible meanings in "throughout", "over" and "as far as", is best understood as "amongst"; and "moras", with a range of possible meanings in "[[Moorland|moors]]" or "mountains", is best understood as "mountains", though "moors" may be intended. The word ''mór [] m (-es/-as)'' used in the original text can be translated as moor, morass, swamp; hill, mountain. See e.g. {{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~modean52/oeme_dictionaries.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091005071901/http://home.comcast.net/~modean52/oeme_dictionaries.htm |archivedate=2009-10-05 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Kvens carry their ships over land into the meres, and thence make depredations on the Northmen; they have very little ships, and very light.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As is emphasized in the text, Ohthere's account was an oral statement, made to King Alfred, and the section dealing with Kvenland takes up only two sentences. Ohthere's information on Kvens may have been second-hand, since, unlike in his other stories, Ohthere does not emphasize his personal involvement in any way. Ohthere's method of locating Kvenland can be interpreted to mean that Kvenland was located in and around the northern part of the modern-day Sweden and in the mid-western part of the modern-day Finland, when the difference in the Viking compass is taken into consideration (see more further below). Other, somewhat later sources call the land adjacent to the northern part of Norway "Finnmark."&lt;ref&gt;For example Egil's Saga.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohthere's ''Finnas'' may be a reference to the [[Sami people]], but not all historians agree on this.&lt;ref name="Kyösti Julku, 1986"&gt;Julku, Kyösti: ''Kvenland - Kainuunmaa''. With English summary: ''The Ancient territory of Kainuu''. Oulu, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ohthere does not give any name for the area where his "Finnas" lived, he gives a lengthy description of their lives in and around Northern Norway, without mentioning Kvens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/iallt2003/oldenglish/OEparagraph-3.html Ohthere's description of Sami people]. Earlier in the text Ohthere is reported to have said that "that land is very long north from thence, but it is all [[wikt:waste|waste]], except in a few places, where the Finnas dwell here and there".&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohthere's mention of the "large [freshwater] meres" and of the Kvens' boats are of great interest. The meres are said to be "amongst the mountains", the words used in the text being ''geond þa moras''.&lt;ref name=geond_da_moras/&gt; Ohthere may be referring to the Southern Norwegian lake district, which is also referred to in ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]''. This way, the reference would have included [[Mjøsa|Lake Mjøsa]], an area which is known to have been inhabited at that time: the Orkneyinga saga tells how these inhabitants were attacked by men from Kvenland.&lt;ref name=orkneyinga/&gt;

The mention of the "very light ships" (boats) carried overland has a well-documented ethnographic parallel in the numerous [[portage]]s of the historical river and lake routes in Fennoscandia and Northern Russia. According to the philologist Irmeli Valtonen, "[the] text does not give us a clear picture where the ''Cwenas'' are to be located though it seems a reasonable conclusion that they lived or stayed somewhere in the modern-day areas of Northern Sweden or Northern Finland."&lt;ref&gt;Irmeli Valtonen: A Land beyond Seas and Mountains: A Study of References to Finland in Anglo-Saxon Sources. A paper in the book ''Suomen varhaishistoria'' [Proto-history of Finland]. Edited by Kyösti Julku. Rovaniemi 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Kven" briefly appears later in King Alfred's ''Orosius''. The [[Kven Sea]] is mentioned as the northern border for the ancient [[Germany]], and Kvenland is mentioned again, as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... the Swedes (Sweons) have to the south of them the arm of the sea called East (Osti), and to the east of them [[Sarmatians|Sarmatia]] (Sermende), and to the north, over the wastes, is Kvenland (Cwenland), to the northwest are the Sami people (Scridefinnas), and the Norwegians (Norðmenn) are to the west.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/kerr/vol01chap01sect06to11.html Geography of Alfred]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term ''Sarmatism'' was first used by [[Jan Długosz]] in his 15th century work on the history of Poland.&lt;ref name="sarmatian review"&gt;Andrzej Wasko, [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/497/wasko.html Sarmatism or the Enlightenment]: The Dilemma of Polish Culture, ''[[Sarmatian Review]]'' XVII.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Długosz was also responsible for linking the Sarmatians to the [[prehistory of Poland]], and this idea was continued by other chroniclers and historians such as [[Marcin Bielski]], [[Marcin Kromer]] and [[Maciej Miechowita]].&lt;ref name="sarmatian review"/&gt; Miechowita's ''Tractatus de Duabus Sarmatiis'' became influential abroad, and for some time it was one of the most widely used reference works on the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name="sarmatian review"/&gt;

The Viking compass is believed to have had a 45 degree rotation of [[cardinal direction|cardinal points]].&lt;ref name=viking_compass&gt;See e.g. Weibull, Lauritz. ''De gamle nordbornas väderstrecksbegrepp''. Scandia 1/1928; Ekblom, R. ''Alfred the Great as Geographer''. Studia Neuphilologia. 14/1941-2; Ekblom, R. ''Den forntida nordiska orientering och Wulfstans resa till Truso''. Förnvännen. 33/1938; Sköld, Tryggve. ''Isländska väderstreck''. Scripta Islandica. Isländska sällskapets årsbok 16/1965.&lt;/ref&gt; If the territories listed in King Alfred's ''Orosius'' are examined with that in mind, the Norwegians would be to the northwest of Sweden, and the Sami people would be to the north. These points are correct after rotation based on the difference between the Viking and modern compasses. Kvenland is then situated to the northeast of Sweden and might be placed somewhere around the present-day Swedish [[Norrland]] or the western part of the present-day Finland. The information of Kvenland being situated "over the wastes", northwards from the Viking-period "Sweden" (corresponding roughly to the south-central part of present-day Sweden) matches the idea of Kvenland extending to Norrland.&lt;ref name="Kyösti Julku, 1986"/&gt; There is no "[[Finland]]" mentioned anywhere either in the original or the updated version of Orosius' history.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==''Hversu Noregr byggdist'' and ''Orkneyinga saga''==
{{ Details|Kings of Kvenland}}
Three medieval [[Iceland]]ic accounts discuss Kvenland. They are ''[[Egils saga]]'' and the more legendary ''[[Hversu Noregr byggdist]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/ice/is3/is316.htm Hversu Noregr byggdist]. See also [http://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/fornjot.htm original text].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]''.&lt;ref name=orkneyinga&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041019215759/http://www.northvegr.org/lore/oldheathen/064.php Orkneyinga saga]. See also [http://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/fornjot.htm original text].&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''Hversu Noregr byggdist'', Kvens made sacrifices to Thorri, who "ruled over Gothland, Kvenland (Kænlandi) and Finland."  According to ''Orkneyinga saga'', [[Fornjót]] was "a king" who "reigned over Gotland, which we now know as Finland and Kvenland."  

A DNA study conducted on the prehistoric skeletal remains of four individuals from Gotland supports the area having been ethnically interconnected with Finland and Kvenland during the primeval era, just as suggested by ''Hversu Noregr byggdist'' and ''Orkneyinga saga'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The hunter-gatherers show the greatest similarity to modern-day Finns", says Pontus Skoglund, an evolutionary geneticist at Uppsala University in Sweden.&lt;ref name=nature.com&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/ancient-swedish-farmer-came-from-the-mediterranean-1.10541#/comments DNA study published in nature.com on April 26, 2012. Pontus Skoglund on prehistoric Gotlanders: "The hunter-gatherers show the greatest similarity to modern-day Finns."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Recent archaeological discoveries made in Finland have further emphasized the close ties between Gotland and modern-day  Finland during the primeval era. In the late spring of 2013, a [[Merovingian]] period (600-800 AD) silver plate, believed to be a piece of a sword scabbard, was discovered in [[Rautjärvi]], Finland. The origin of the silver plate has been traced to Gotland, based on its style of ornamentation. According to Jukka Luoto of the Museum of South Karelia, "this indicates that these areas have independently conducted trade with Gotland."&lt;ref name="Rautjärvi_1"&gt;Yle News, [http://yle.fi/uutiset/amatooriarkeologit_ovat_tehneet_kevaalla_huikeita_loytoja/6672965 "Amateur archaeologists have made huge discoveries during the springtime]," published on June 4, 2013 (in Finnish).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rautjärvi_2"&gt;Yle News, [http://yle.fi/uutiset/mystinen_hopealevy_loytyi_rautjarvelta_-_historia_uusiksi/6664045 "Mystical silver plate discovered in Rautjärvi may change history writing]," published on May 30, 2013 (in Finnish).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Orkneyinga saga'' contains a realistic description of [[Nór]] traveling from Kvenland to Norway. Based on the saga's internal chronologies, this would have happened around the 6th or 7th century CE,{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} but the dating is very insecure. Locations of Kvenland, Finland and Gotland are given rather exactly:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"to the east of the gulf that lies across from the White Sea (Gandvík); we call that the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] (Helsingjabotn)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heimskringla.no/original/fornaldersagaene/fundinnnoregr.php The text in the original language.] {{webarchive|url=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20070508173441/http%3A//www.heimskringla.no/original/fornaldersagaene/fundinnnoregr.php |date=2007-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The saga is correct in placing the Gulf of Bothnia "across" (i.e., "on the other side of" the isthmus between the two seas) from the [[White Sea]]. The saga does not say that Kvenland was on the coast, but just east of the Gulf.[[File:Map orkneyinga.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A possible location of Kvenland and Nór's route to the fjord of Trondheim. Kvenland can be placed elsewhere east of Gulf of Bothnia, as well. The selected location on the map is the one with most archaeological finds. Most interpretations locate Kvenland in the less well researched northern coastal area on the Bothnian Bay.]]
[[File:Europe 814.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Kvenland in 814 AD. Old Norse sagas suggest that Kvenland covered the entire Fennoscandian area.]]
This is how Nór started his journey to Norway:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But Nor, his brother, waited until snow lay on the moors so he could travel on snow-shoes. He went out from Kvenland and skirted the Gulf, and came to that place inhabited by the men called Sami (Lapps);&lt;ref&gt;It is not sure if this is a reference to Sami people or some other group. Finnic-based "Lapp" does not appear in any other saga. It became a common name for Sami people only later in Middle Ages, and Norwegians never really adopted it.&lt;/ref&gt; that is beyond Finnmark.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Having traveled for a while, Nór was still "beyond Finnmark." After a brief fight with Sami people (Lapps), Nór continued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But Nor went thence westward to the Kjolen Mountains and for a long time they knew nothing of men, but shot beasts and birds to feed to themselves, until they came to a place where the rivers flowed west of the mountains. &amp;mdash; Then he went up along the valleys that run south of the fjord. That fjord is now called Trondheim.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Starting somewhere on the eastern coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, Nór had either gone all the way up and around the Gulf, or skied across; it was winter, and the gulf might have been frozen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bell.lib.umn.edu/map/OLAUS/carta.html Olaus Magnus map of Scandinavia 1539 CE]. Taking benefit from the frozen Gulf of Bothnia was still habitual in the 16th century, as described in the map, see section F.&lt;/ref&gt; Nór ended up attacking the area around [[Trondheim]] in central Norway and later the lake district in the south, conquering the country and uniting it under his rule. There is no mention of Kvenland after that. Again only a handful of words are devoted to Kvenland, mainly telling where it was.

Nór's journey from Kvenland to Norway is missing from ''Hversu'', which in fact does not even mention that Nór came from Kvenland at all, only stating: "Norr had great battles west of the Keel". The journey may have been lifted from some other context and added to ''Orkneyinga saga'' in a later phase by an unknown author who wanted to make the saga more adventurous. 
==Egil's saga==
''[[Egils saga]]'' is an epic [[Icelandic saga]] possibly by [[Snorri Sturluson]] (1179-1241 CE), who may have written it between 1220 and 1240 CE. The saga covers a long period, starting in Norway in 850 CE and ending around 1000 CE. It contains a short description of Egil's uncle Thorolf Kveldulfsson co-operating with a Kvenland king, [[Faravid]], against invading Karelians. Rather accurate geographical details about Kvenland's location are given in chapter XIV:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/egil/egil15.htm Egil's Saga, Chapter XIV]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Finmark is a wide tract; it is bounded westwards by the sea, wherefrom large firths run in; by sea also northwards and round to the east; but southwards lies Norway; and Finmark stretches along nearly all the inland region to the south, as also does [[Hålogaland]] outside. But eastwards from [[Namdalen]] (Naumdale) is [[Jämtland]] (Jamtaland), then [[Hälsingland]] (Helsingjaland) and Kvenland, then Finland, then [[Karelia]] (Kirialaland); along all these lands to the north lies Finmark, and there are wide inhabited fell-districts, some in dales, some by lakes. The lakes of Finmark are wonderfully large, and by the lakes there are extensive forests. But high fells lie behind from end to end of the Mark, and this ridge is called Keels.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like ''Hversu Noregr byggdist'', ''Egils saga'' clearly separates Finland and Kvenland, listing them as neighboring areas. However, Finland is not listed in any of the saga's surviving versions, indicating that it might be a later addition by someone who did not recognize Kvenland any more. The saga says "eastwards from Namdalen is Jämtland", but actually the direction is southeast. Also Hälsingland is southeast, not east, of Jämtland. Since it is widely assumed that the Viking compass had a 45 degree rotation of cardinal points, the saga's "east" seems to correspond to the contemporary southeast.&lt;ref name=viking_compass/&gt;

In chapter XVII Thorolf goes to Kvenland again:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/egil/egil18.htm Egil's Saga, Chapter XVII]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;That same winter Thorolf went up on the fell with a hundred men; he passed on at once eastwards to Kvenland and met king Faravid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Had Thorolf gone up to the mountains around his homeland Namdalen and then straight "eastwards", i.e., southeast, he would have first reached Jämtland and then Hälsingland. These are the same lands that were listed earlier in the saga. If the passage about going "southwest" is taken literally and directly, continuing from Hälsingland across the Gulf of Bothnia Thorolf would have arrived in the southwestern tip of present-day Finland, the center of Finland's Viking period population (see map).
Again, as with ''Ohthere'', Sami people and Kvens are not discussed at the same time. The saga tells how Norwegians taxed the Sami people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/egil/egil11.htm Egil's Saga, Chapter X]&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no indication in the saga that the Kvens would have competed with the Norwegians for control of the Sami or lived near or among them. Much debate has taken place concerning whether the saga provides truthful information of Iron Age Kvenland by mentioning that the Kvens had a real-sounding 'king' and a 'law' to divide the loot.

Besides Old English Orosius, Hversu Noregr byggdist, Orkneyinga saga and Egil's saga, Kvenland or Kvens are very briefly mentioned in four [[Iceland]]ic texts from the same era. One of the texts may have been written in [[Norway]].

=== ''Norna-Gests þáttr'' ===
''[[Norna-Gests þáttr]]'' has a brief mention of the king of [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]], [[Sigurd Hring]] (ruling in the mid-8th century), fighting against the [[Curonians]] and the Kvens:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sigurd Ring (Sigurðr) was not there, since he had to defend his land, Sweden (''Svíþjóð''), since Curonians (''Kúrir'') and Kvens (''Kvænir'') were raiding there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/sagas_oi/017.php Norna-Gests þáttr, chapter 7.].

=== ''Historia Norwegiae'' ===
''[[Historia Norwegiae]]'' was written sometime between 1160 and 1175 CE in an unknown location. It contains a list of peoples in the North:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But towards north many pagan tribes—alas!—stretch from the east behind Norway, namely [[Karelians]] (Kiriali) and Kvens (Kwæni), corneous Sami people (cornuti Finni) and both peoples of [[Bjarmaland|Bjarmia]] (utrique Biarmones). But what tribes dwell behind them, have we no certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Storm, Gustav. ''Monumenta Historica Norwegiae'', pages 73-75. See also page 204. Translation provided here is by the author of the article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Icelandic Annals''===
The [[Icelandic Annals]] have a late mention of Kvens clearly active in the North. Around 1271 CE, the following is said to have happened:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then Karelians (Kereliar) and Kvens (Kvænir) pillaged widely in [[Hålogaland]] (Hálogaland).&lt;ref&gt;''Íslenzkir annáler sive Annales Islandici ab anno Christi 809 ad annum 1430'', pages 140-141. Translation provided here is by the author of the article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Possible other sources==
In some pre-medieval and medieval texts, it is not clear which groups of people the authors are referring to by the titles used. According to historians, terms used for either the Kvens, Finns and/or Sami in texts written during the 1st millennium AD include the following:

* ''Aeni'', ''Aeningia'' (in reference to ''Fenningia'') - by [[Pliny the Elder]] c. 77 AD;&lt;ref name="Jaakkola, Jalmari, 1956, page 303"&gt;Jaakkola, Jalmari: ''Suomen varhaishistoria'' ("Proto-history of Finland").

In the Old Norse language the word "Finn" (''finnr'') referred to the [[Sami people]], though, and not the [[Finnish people]], and the word still has that same meaning in [[Bokmål]] (one of the two official standards of the Norwegian language).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nob-ordbok.uio.no/perl/ordbok.cgi?OPP=+finn&amp;ant_bokmaal=5&amp;ant_nynorsk=5&amp;bokmaal=+&amp;ordbok=bokmaal Oslo University online Norwegian dictionary]. Retrieved 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Skridfinne'' ("skiing Finn") and ''finne'' also referred to the Sami people, and not the Finnish people, in both the other Scandinavian languages, Latin (''scricfinni/finni'') and Greek (''{{lang|grc|σκριϑίφινοι}}/{{lang|grc|φίννοι}}'') during mediaeval times. &lt;ref&gt;[http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/show.phtml?filenr=1/250/124.html Svenska Akademins Ordbok 1924]. [[University of Gothenburg]] Språkdata project. Retrieved 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===''Germania''===

According to Finnish historian Kyösti Julku the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribe [[Sitones]] mentioned in [[Tacitus|Tacitus']] [[Germania]] in 98 CE lived in the area in northern Fennoscandia claimed to be ''Kvenland'', saying "There can be no confusion about the geographical location of the Sitones."&lt;ref name="Kyösti Julku, 1986, page 51"/&gt;

==Different interpretations==

===Kvenland and Kainuu===
Kvenland has generated many theories about its origin, the location of Kvenland east of the [[Bay of Bothnia]] has, however, been an unchanging feature of most interpretations since the 17th century, when the Swedish historians [[Johannes Messenius]] and [[Olaus Rudbeckius]] first noted the concept of Kvenland in Old Norse sources. In 1650, Professor Michael Wexionius from [[Turku]] became the first to associate Kvenland with the Finnish ''[[Kainuu]]''. In the 18th century the Finnish historian [[Henrik Gabriel Porthan]], among others, focused attention on the ''Ohthere'' passage mentioning the ''Cwenas''. Whereas Porthan suggested that the ancient Kvens may have been Swedish, many others came to view the Kvens as an ancient Finnish tribe.&lt;ref name="Olavi Korhonen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tacitus&gt;[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/tacitus/005.php Tacitus' Germania.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julku, Kyösti: Kvenland - Kainuunmaa. With English summary: ''The Ancient territory of Kainuu''. Oulu, 1986. See pages 11-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays Kainuu is a name of an inland province in northeastern Finland. In the past the name Kainuu was often used of the more western coastal area around the [[Bay of Bothnia]], even up to the 19th century. In the early ''Umesaami'' dictionaries the terms ''Kainolads'' and ''Kainahalja'' described Norwegian and Swedish men and women respectively.&lt;ref&gt;''Lexicon Lapponicum'', 1768&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kvenland and Pohjola===

In a theory somewhat closely related to the Kainuu theory, Kvenland has also been associated with the legendary [[Pohjola]].&lt;ref name="Kyösti Julku, 1986"/&gt; Pohjola is an other-worldly country in Finnish mythology, ruled by a fierce witch called [[Louhi]].&lt;ref name="Kyösti Julku, 1986"/&gt; Pohjola is best known from the ''[[Kalevala]]'', a 19th-century Finnish work of [[epic poetry]] compiled by [[Elias Lönnrot]] from [[Karelian language|Karelian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] oral [[folklore]] and [[Finnish mythology|mythology]], collected largely in the Finnish region of [[Kainuu]].&lt;ref name="Overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=160078&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US|accessdate=15 August 2010 |title=Kalevala: the Finnish national epic|author=Anneli Asplund|author2=Sirkka-Liisa Mettom|date=October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different interpretations of the origins of the mythical Pohjola exist. Some include parts of [[Lapland (region)|Lapland]] and the ancient Kainuu (same as Kvenland according to common view today&lt;ref name="Kyösti Julku, 1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olavi Korhonen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jorma Koivulehto, 1995"/&gt;) in Kalevala's Pohjola. Some point out a similarity with the name ''Pohjanmaa'' ([[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]] in English), a region in western Finland.

===Other interpretations===
An original view has been provided by a Finnish historian and Helsinki University professor, [[Matti Klinge]], who has placed Kvenland/Kainuu not only in southern Finland, but around the Baltic Sea as a kind of Finnish-Swedish "maritime confederation". Klinge has presented a hypothesis of Kvenland as a naval power on the Baltic, located on both the present-day Finnish and Swedish sides of the Gulf of Bothnia as well as in some of the surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;Klinge, Matti. ''Muinaisuutemme merivallat'' (1983). The book is in Finnish, also published in Swedish as ''Östersjövärlden'' (1984) and in English as ''Ancient Powers of the Baltic Sea'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The folklorist and professor of literature Väinö Kaukonen calls it "fantastic fabulation" and a "dream-wish".&lt;ref&gt;Kaukonen, Väinö: ''Kalevala Lönnrotin runoelmana II. Tosiasioita ja kuvitelmia''. [The [[Kalevala]] as an epic of [[Elias Lönnrot]]. Facts and imaginations.] Snellman-instituutin julkaisuja 7. Kuopio 1988. See pages 200 - 209.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Professor Emeritus in Archeology at the University of Turku, Unto Salo has also concluded that "Kvens/Kainulainens" were men of Satakunta in Southern Finland.&lt;ref&gt;Unto Salo,  Faravidin retket ja Satakunnan organisoituminen rautakaudella 
(Faravid 27/2003)&lt;/ref&gt; There is archeological evidence linking Satakunta and Lapland (for example types of skis) but skipping the areas between which suggests that expeditions were undertaken from Satakunta to the North during the late Viking Age. Further, toponomy suggests that there were regular routes used by the people of Satakunta to get to the North. Lastly, haapio, a type of a very light dugout boat was used extensively in Satakunta and would have been ideal for such expeditions. Unto Salo speculates that the name Haaparanta ("Aspen shore") in the Northern Sweden (county of Norrbotten) would have been given due to presence of asps needed to build haapios.
Originally Kvenland was more likely situated in the Southern-Ostrobothnia but when this habitation disappeared in the early 9th century for unknown reasons, the Norwegians continued to apply the term Kven to the men of Satakunta and Häme who inherited the Northern trade and taxation. &lt;ref&gt;Pentti Virrankoski,  Kainu - Pohjanmaan rautakautinen kansa 
(Faravid 2/1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Woman Land===

Different views exist of why ancient scholars have made references to Kvenland as an area dominated by women. Some have suggested that there may have been misinterpretations of terminology. Whatever the etymological origin of the element ''kven'', it effortlessly translates to "woman" in [[Old Norse]]. Proto-Germanic *''kwinōn'', *''kunōn'', *''kwēni-z'' and *''kwēnō'' for "woman" developed into ''kona'', ''kvǟn'', ''kvān'', ''kvɔ̄n'', ''kvendi'', ''kvenna'' and ''kvinna'' in Old Norse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&amp;basename=\data\ie\germet&amp;text_recno=257&amp;root=config Etymology of kwen.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is plausible that this led learned speakers of Old Norse to identify Kvenland with the land of the [[Amazons]] in Greek legend; [[Adam of Bremen]], for example, often mentions Amazons in writing of the far North.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rudolf Simek]], "Monstra septentrionalia: Supernatural Monsters of the Far North in Medieval Lore", in ''Imagining the Supernatural North'', ed. Eleanor Rosamund Barraclough, Danielle Marie Cudmore, and Stefan Donecker, Edmonton: University of Alberta, 2016, {{ISBN|978-1-77212-267-1}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;55–75, pp.&amp;nbsp;60–61, 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among sources used in the related debate by historians is the following statement of [[Tacitus]] from c. 98 CE:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Upon the Suiones, border the people Sitones; and, agreeing with them in all other things, differ from them in one, that here the sovereignty is exercised by a woman. So notoriously do they degenerate not only from a state of liberty, but even below a state of bondage."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to a view shared by many historians{{weasel-inline|date=July 2015}}, the term ''Sitones'' (Kvens&lt;ref name="Kyösti Julku, 1986, page 51"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olavi Korhonen"/&gt;) shares etymological roots with [[Old Sigtuna|Sigtuna]], which much later had a Latin spelling ''Situne''.&lt;ref&gt;''Svenskt Diplomatorium I nr 852. Originalbrev''. [[Pope Alexander III]]'s address to king [[Knut Eriksson]] and [[Jarl (title)|Jarl]] [[Birger Brosa]] in the 1170s.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gottfried Reichard took this view in his edition of the ''Germania''; ''Pauly's Real-Encyclopädie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft in alphabetischer Ordnung'', ed. August Pauly, Christian Walz and W.S. Teuffel, Volume 6.1 ''Pra - Stoiai'', Stuttgart: Metzler, 1852, {{oclc|165378771}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=y7tKAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1226&amp;dq=Sitones,+Sigtuna,+Reichard&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Eqi2UefyMKq6igLqzoGYAQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Sitones%2C%20Sigtuna%2C%20Reichard&amp;f=false p. 1226] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Anthon, ''A classical dictionary containing an account of the principal proper names mentioned in ancient authors and intended to elucidate all the important points connected with the geography, history, biography, mythology, and fine arts of the Greeks and Romans: Together with an account of coins, weights, and measures, with tabular values of the same'', New York: Harper, 1841, repr. 1869, {{oclc|52696823}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EHsMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1244&amp;dq=Sitones,+Sigtuna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JqS2Ue7IM8rwigLtiYCwBw&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Sitones%2C%20Sigtuna&amp;f=false p. 1244].&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Disas saga]]'', the Sitones were ruled by a queen. According to a common view, the "queen" of the Sitones either derives from or is a possible linguistic confusion of an [[Old Norse]] term used for "woman", which shares linguistic origins with the term used in reference to the [[Origin of the name Kven|Kvens]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gudmund Schütte]], tr. Jean Young, ''Our Forefathers, the Gothonic Nations: A Manual of the Ethnography of the Gothic, German, Dutch, Anglo-Saxon, Frisian and Scandinavian Peoples'', Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1929&amp;ndash;33, {{oclc|2084026}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u3A3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Sitones,+queen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6p-2UceZDeiyigLe-4CQCA&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Sitones%2C%20queen&amp;f=false p. 126].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gwyn Jones (author)|Gwyn Jones]], ''A History of the Vikings'', 2nd ed.

[[Thomas William Shore]]. First edition, 1906.  Reissued by Kennikat Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1075 AD, in ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]]'', the German chronicler [[Adam of Bremen]] calls Kvenland Women's Land, stating the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Meanwhile Swedes (Sueones), who had expelled their bishop, got a divine revenge. And at first King's son called Anund, whose father had sent him to enlarge his kingdom, after arriving to Women's Land (''patriam feminarum''), whom we consider to be Amazons, was killed along with his army from poison, that they had mixed to the spring water. (III 15)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"After that come the Swedes (Sueones) that rule wide areas up until the "Land of Women" (terram feminarum). Living east of these are said to be Wizzi, Mirri, Lamiy, Scuti and Turci up until the border of Russia (Ruzziam)." (IV 14) &lt;ref name="Kyösti Julku, 1986"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the related debate references are sometimes also made to the Finnish epic ''[[Kalevala]]'', according to which [[Pohjola]] was ruled by a woman called [[Louhi]] or ''Pohjan-akka''. The ancient Norse knew the Northern ruler-goddesses by the names ''gýgjar'' (singular: ''[[Jötunn|gýgr]]'') and ''íviðjur'' (singular: ''íviðja'').  There is also a reference to a northern land of women in an Icelandic manuscript from the 14th century, which describes a ''kuenna land'' ("woman land").

===Different theories on the origins of the Kvens===
In 1958, a Finnish historian, politician and [[University of Helsinki]] professor, [[Kustaa Vilkuna]], suggested that Kainuu or Kvenland was originally in Southern Finland, on the Gulf of Bothnia and covering just northern [[Southwest Finland]] and coastal [[Satakunta]].&lt;ref&gt;Vilkuna, Kustaa. ''Kvenland. Missä ja mikä?'' (1958). Book is in Finnish, Swedish translation published in 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; A small local area called as "[[Kalanti]]" (''Kaland'' in Swedish) would have been a remnant of the earlier name Kvenland. Because of the trading and tribute-taking expeditions as well as settlement expansion of the kainulaiset, the territorial concept of Kainuu was gradually moved northward. 

Another mid-20th-century historian, Professor [[Jalmari Jaakkola]], considered the Kvens or ''kainulaiset'' as long-range hunters and tribute-takers coming from [[Pirkanmaa|Upper Satakunta]], from the inland region surrounding the present-day city of [[Tampere]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaakkola, Jalmari: ''Suomen varhaishistoria''. [Proto-history of Finland]. Helsinki 1935, second edition 1958&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was supported by Professor Armas Luukko.&lt;ref&gt;''Pohjois-Pohjanmaan ja Lapin historia'' II [History of Northern Ostrobothnia and Lapland, II.] Oulu 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Professor Pentti Virrankoski of the [[University of Turku]] presented a hypothesis according to which Kainuu was originally the sedentary Iron Age settlement in [[Southern Ostrobothnia]]. After the settlement was supposedly destroyed by tribal warfare during the early 9th century, the ''kainulaiset'' became dispersed along the western coasts of Finland, leaving only place-names and some archaeological finds as permanent traces.&lt;ref&gt;A paper by Pentti Virrankoski in the journal ''Faravid'', 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the [[University of Oulu]] professor [[Jouko Vahtola]] pointed out that there is no evidence of the name ''Kainuu'' being of Western Finnish origin and considered it to have Eastern Finnish roots. However, he suggested a common Germanic etymology for the names Kainuu and Kvenland. Like most of his predecessors, Vahtola viewed Kainuu/Kvenland as the name of the coastal Ostrobothnia, meaning roughly "low-lying land". Based on the archaeological knowledge of the north, Vahtola did not believe that there was a separate Iron Age tribe called Kvens. He considered the Kvens to be mainly [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastians]] hunting and trading in northern [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnia]], thus partially reproducing the view of Jaakkola and Luukko (Upper Satakunta being a part of traditional Tavastia).&lt;ref&gt;Vahtola, Jouko. ''Tornionlaakson historia I''. Kveenit, kainulaiset. Malungs boktryckeri AB, Malung, Sweden. 1991. See page 216.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is nowadays widely adopted in Finland, Sweden and Norway, and it is cited in many studies and popular works. 

In 1995 the Finnish linguist Jorma Koivulehto gave support for the theory of common etymological roots of the names ''Kainuu'' and ''Kvenland''. He suggests a new etymology meaning roughly "marine gap-land", the "marine gap" being the northern sea-route on the Bothnian Gulf.&lt;ref name="Jorma Koivulehto, 1995"&gt;Jorma Koivulehto. Ala-Satakunnan Kainu ja pohjoisen Kainuu. [The ''Kainu'' of Western Satakunta and the ''Kainuu'' of the north.] A paper in the book ''Kielen ja kulttuurin Satakunta''. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing archaeological fieldwork in northern Finland has cast some doubts on the idea of Kvenland having almost no sedentary settlements. Encouraged by the new findings, Professor Kyösti Julku of Oulu University presented a theory of the Kvens being early permanent Finnish inhabitants of Northern Finland and Norrbotten (a part of modern-day Sweden).&lt;ref name="Kyösti Julku, 1986"/&gt;

Some Swedish historians have suggested that the ancient Kvens were actually a Scandinavian and not a Finnish group, but these views have little support nowadays. The Swedish archaeologist Thomas Wallerström suggests that the Kvens/kainulaiset was a collective name for several [[Finnic peoples|Finnic]] groups participating in the west-east fur-trade, not just southern Finns but ancestors of [[Karelians]] and [[Vepsians]] as well. In this case, the land of the Kvens would have extended from the Bothnian Gulf in the west to the [[Lake Onega]] in the east.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Wallerström: ''Norrbotten, Sverige och medeltiden. Problem kring makt och bosättning i en europeisk periferi''. Lund Studies in Medieval Archaeology 15:1. 1995. With English summary: Norrbotten, Sweden and the Middle Ages. Problems concerning Power and Settlement on a European Periphery. See pages  213-238.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kvenland and Kvens later in historical time==

In 1328, Tälje Charter ("Tälje stadga") - the oldest known record written in Swedish - mention the [[Birkarls]] ("bircharlaboa"). Based on the information revealed, the [[Birkarls]] then inhabited areas, e.g., in Northern Hälsingland, which covered the western coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, and from there all the way up and around the gulf to Oulu River. Tälje Charter is a state treaty ratified between the Kvens and the Swedish crown, in which the king of Sweden guarantees the Brkarl Kvens trading and tax-collecting rights as chief enforcement officers (Swedish term: ''Fogde'') in the North.&lt;ref name=LAPPONIA&gt;''Schefferus bok LAPPONIA (LAPPLAND''), published in 1673 in Latin. A translation from Latin last printed in 1995 by Wallerström in Sweden. Page 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1539 map [[Carta Marina]], [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Olaus Magnus]] places Birkarl Kvens ("Berkara Qvenar") on the Norwegian North Atlantic cost, roughly in the middle in between the [[archipelago]] of [[Lofoten]] and the modern-day city of [[Tromsø]]. In his 1555 ''[[Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus]]'' (A Description of the Northern Peoples), he also mentions both terms: the Finnish traders who commuted between and inhabited the general area of [[Tornio]] and the modern-day area of [[Norway]] are said to have been called ''Kvens''.&lt;ref name="Kyösti Julku, 1986"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vahtola, Jouko. ''Tornionlaakson historia I''. Kveenit, kainulaiset. Malungs boktryckeri AB, Malung, Sweden. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest remaining [[Norway|Norwegian]] tax records, stored at the National Archival Services of Norway (''Riksarkivet''), dating to the mid-16th century, also mention Kvens.&lt;ref name="Niemi"&gt;Niemi, E. (1994). ''Kvenene og staten – et historisk riss. I: Torekoven Strøm (ed.)''. Report from the seminar ”Kvenene – en glemt minoritet?”, on Nov. 14, 1994, at the University of Tromsø / Tromsø Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Today, the term ''Kven'' is used in Norway in reference to the descendants of Finnish-speaking people who have inhabited or migrated to the present-day area of Norway anytime before World War II. Migration waves from the 16th century onward have brought Finnish settlers to [[Northern Norway]] from the modern-day areas of Northern Sweden and Northern Finland, mostly from the northern coastal areas of the [[Bay of Bothnia]].

==Modern reappearance of the terms "Kvenland" and "Kvens"==
Repeated claims about there in mediaeval times having existed a '''country''' named ''Kvenland'', populated by a [[Finnish language|Finnish-speaking]] people named ''Kvens'', have reappeared in modern times in northern Sweden and northern Finland, amid claims that the "Kvens" not only are '''an''' indigenous people in northern Sweden and Finland, but '''the''' indigenous people there. Claims that are directly connected to a struggle over the rights to hunt and fish in very large areas in northern [[Fennoscandia]], between the [[Sami people]], who are the recognised indigenous people of the area, and the Swedish- and Finnish-speaking population there. There are, however, no documented or in any other way proven connection between the people in northern Sweden and Finland who now claim to be ''Kvens'', and the geographical area, and people who lived there, that in mediaeval times were referred to as ''Kvenland'' and ''Kvens''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lennartlundmark.se/file/kvaner.pdf/kvaner.pdf Myten om kvänernas rike.

'''LGBT themes in mythology''' occur in [[mythologies]] and [[religious]] [[narrative]]s that include stories of [[romance (love)|romantic]] affection or [[sexuality]] between figures of the same sex or that feature divine actions that result in changes in [[gender]]. These myths are forms of [[LGBT]] ([[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]]) expression, and modern conceptions of [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]] and gender have been applied to them. Many mythologies ascribe [[homosexuality]] and [[gender fluidity]] in humans to the action of gods or of other supernatural interventions.

The presence of LGBT themes in [[Western world|Western]] mythologies has become the subject of intense study. The application of [[gender studies]] and [[queer theory]] to non-Western mythic tradition is less developed, but has grown since the end of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Cabezón, p. vii, Introduction"&gt;

Myths often include being gay, bisexual, or transgender as symbols for sacred or mythic experiences.&lt;ref name=connerix/&gt; Devdutt Pattanaik writes that myths "capture the collective unconsciousness of a people", and that this means they reflect deep-rooted beliefs&lt;ref&gt;

The status of mythology varies by [[culture]]. Myths are generally believed to be literally true within the society that created them and deemed erroneous or fictitious elsewhere. Cultures may regard myths as containing psychological or archetypal truths. Myths have been used to explain and validate the [[Social organisation|social institutions]] of a particular culture,&lt;ref name=Pequigney1&gt;Pequigney (2002), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to educate the members of that culture. This societal role has been posited for stories that included same-sex love, which educate people as to the correct attitude to adopt toward same-sex [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] and gender constructions.&lt;!-- eg. see Classical (Narcissus) or Norse (Loki) mythologies --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman &amp; Haggerty, p.527, "Mythology, Nonclassical"&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the beginning of [[Recorded History|recorded history]] and in a multitude of cultures, myths, folklore and [[Religious text|sacred texts]] have incorporated themes of same-sex [[eroticism]] and [[gender identity]].&lt;ref name=connerix&gt;Conner Sparks (2002), p. ix, "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt; Myths often include homosexuality, bisexuality or transgenderism as a symbol for sacred or mythic experiences.&lt;ref name=connerix/&gt; Homoeroticism or gender variance in myths have been analysed according to modern conceptions of LGBT identities and behaviours, for example, deities that disguise themselves as, or adopt behaviors traditional to, the opposite gender for a given culture may be called transgender, and beings with no [[Sex organ|reproductive organs]] or both male and female organs may be called [[androgynous]] or [[intersex]]. Individual myths have been denoted "queer" for rejecting an [[heteronormative]] and [[gender binary|binary]] view of gender.&lt;ref name=Pattanaik3&gt;Pattanaik (2001), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The queer interpretations may be based on only indirect evidence, such as an unusually close same-sex friendship or dedication to chastity. These have been criticised for ignoring cultural context or mis-applying modern or Western preconceptions,&lt;ref name=Pattanaik16&gt;Pattanaik (2001), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; for example in assuming that celibacy means only avoiding penetration or reproductive sex (hence allowing homoerotic sex), while ignoring the widespread beliefs in the spiritual potency of semen that mandate an avoidance of all sex.&lt;ref name=Pattanaik16/&gt;

The presence of LGBT themes in Western mythologies has long been recognised, and the subject of intense study. The application of gender studies and queer theory to non-Western mythic tradition is less developed, but has been growing since the end of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Cabezón, p. vii, Introduction"/&gt; Devdutt Pattanaik writes that myths "capture the collective unconsciousness of a people", and that this means they reflect deep-rooted beliefs about variant sexualities that may be at odds with repressive social mores.&lt;ref name=Pattanaik3/&gt;

Many mythologies ascribe homosexuality and gender variance in humans to the action of gods or other supernatural interventions. This include myths in which gods teach people about same-sex sexual practices by example, as in Aztec or Hawaiian mythology&lt;ref&gt;Edwin, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; or myths that explain the cause for transgenderism or homosexuality, such as the story in which Prometheus accidentally creates some people with the wrong genitalia while drunk, or instances of reincarnation or possession by a spirit of the opposite gender in Voodoo.

It is common in polytheistic mythologies to find characters that can change gender, or have aspects of both male and female genders at the same time. Sexual activity with both genders is also common within such pantheons, and is compared to modern bisexuality or pansexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (2004), "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt; The creation myths of many traditions involve sexual, bisexual or androgynous motifs, with the world being created by genderless or hermaphrodite beings or through [[Sexual intercourse|sexual congress]] between beings of the opposite or same apparent gender.&lt;ref&gt;Penczak (2003), p. 34, "In the beginning-Creation Myths"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greek mythology]] features male same-sex love in many of the constituent myths. These myths have been described as being crucially influential on Western LGBT literature, with the original myths being constantly re-published and re-written, and the relationships and characters serving as icons.&lt;ref name=Pequigney1/&gt; In comparison, lesbianism is rarely found in classical myths.&lt;ref&gt;Compton, p. 97, "Rome and Greece: Lesbianism"&lt;/ref&gt;

The love goddess [[Aphrodite]] and gods in her retinue, such as the [[Erotes (mythology)|Erotes]]: [[Eros]], [[Himeros]] and [[Pothos (mythology)#Pothos|Pothos]] are sometimes considered patrons of homosexual love between males.&lt;ref name=conner64&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 64, "Aphrodite"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 133, "Erotes"&lt;/ref&gt; Eros is also part of a triad of gods that played roles in homoerotic relationships, along with Heracles and Hermes, who bestowed qualities of Beauty (and Loyalty), strength, and eloquence, respectively, onto male lovers.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 132, "Eros"&lt;/ref&gt; In the poetry of [[Sappho]], Aphrodite is identified as the patron of lesbians.&lt;ref name=conner64/&gt; [[Aphroditus]] was an androgynous Aphrodite from Cyprus, in later mythology became known as [[Hermaphroditus]] the son of Hermes and Aphrodite.

In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphosis]]'' [[Iphis (Cretan)|Iphis]] has a sex change.

According to Book XII of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'', the [[Lapith]] hero of [[Thessaly]], Caeneus,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/OvidMetamorphoses12.html|title=OVID, METAMORPHOSES 12 - Theoi Classical Texts Library|website=www.theoi.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a transgender man. He was originally known as Caenis, daughter of [[Atrax (mythology)|Atrax]].

===Norse===
[[File:Freyr by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|right|"Freyr" (1901) by Johannes Gehrts.]]
The sagas in the [[Old Norse language]] include no stories of gay or lesbian relationships, nor direct reference to LGBT characters, but they do contain several instances of revenge enacted by men accused of being a passive partner in intercourse, which was considered "unmanly" behavior and thus a threat to a man's reputation as a leader or warrior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/iceland.html |title=&gt;&gt; social sciences &gt;&gt; Iceland |publisher=glbtq |accessdate=16 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714120806/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/iceland.html |archivedate=14 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of this, it has been suggested that [[Freyr]], a [[List of Norse gods|Norse god]] of fertility, may have been worshiped by a group of homosexual or effeminate priests, as suggested by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in his ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil, Georges. From Myth to Fiction: the Saga of Hadingus. Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]]. 1970. (p115)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Odin]] is mentioned as a practitioner of ''[[seiðr]]'', a form of magic considered shameful for men to perform, so was reserved for women.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
It is possible that the practice of ''seiðr'' involved passive sexual rites, and Odin was taunted with this fact.&lt;ref name=viklady&gt;[http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/gayvik.shtml Viking Answer Lady Webpage – Homosexuality in Viking Scandinavia]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2011}}

In addition, some of the Norse gods were capable of changing sex at will, for example [[Loki]], the [[Trickster|trickster god]], frequently disguised himself as a woman. In one myth, he turned himself into a [[mare]] and, after having sex with the [[stallion]] [[Svaðilfari]], he gave birth to a [[foal]]. Comparison of a man to a child-bearing woman was a common insult in Scandinavia, and some myths say that Loki is bisexual.&lt;ref name=viklady/&gt;

Odin was known to use magic only available to women and once seduced the goddess Rind in the guise of a leech woman.

===Celtic===
In [[Celtic mythology]], no direct representation of gay or lesbian relationships exist.&lt;ref name=Chereci121&gt;Cherici, pp. 21 &amp; 121&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek and Roman commentators attribute sexual activity between males, including [[pederasty]], to pre-Christian Celtic tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell (1980), p. 183, Percy (1996), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Peter Chicheri argues in ''Celtic sexuality: power, paradigms, and passion'' that homosexual affection was severely punished in Celtic culture due to influence from Christianity,&lt;ref name=Chereci75&gt;Cherici, pp. 75 &amp; 146&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests that any non-procreative sexual experience was subsequently expunged from mythic tales.&lt;ref name=Chereci21&gt;Cherici, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern readings of texts have inferred LGBT themes, for example, the heroes and foster-brothers [[Cúchulainn]] and [[Ferdiadh]] have been interpreted as having a (bi)sexual relationship.&lt;ref name=cassel116/&gt; When forced to fight each other, Ferdiadh mentions their sharing beds, and they are said to have found each other after the first day of conflict and kissed. After three days, Cúchulainn defeats Ferdiadh by piercing his anus with his "mysterious weapon" ''[[Gáe Bulg]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Celts |last=Chadwick |first=Nora |page=268 |year=2001 |publisher=Folio Society |location=London |asin=B0019ZD9Y4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecile O'Rahilly, ''Táin Bó Cúailnge Recension 1'', [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]], 1976, pp. 195–208 [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T301012/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecile O'Rahilly, ''Táin Bó Cúalnge from the Book of Leinster'', Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1967, pp. 211–234 [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T301035/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The tale has led to comparisons to Greek "warrior-lovers", and Cúchulainn's reaction to the death of Ferdiadh in particular compared to Achilles' lament for Patrocles.&lt;ref name=cassel116&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 116 "Cú chulainn and Ferdiadh"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Fourth Branch of the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' of [[Welsh mythology]], [[Gwydion]] helps his brother [[Gilfaethwy]] rape [[Goewin]], [[Math ap Mathonwy|Math]]'s foot-holder. Gwydion and Gilfaethwy sneak back to Math's court where Gilfaethwy rapes Goewin. When Math hears of this, he [[Shapeshifting|turns]] his nephews into a series of mated pairs of animals; Gwydion becomes a [[stag]] for a year, then a [[pig|sow]] and finally a [[wolf]]. Gilfaethwy becomes a [[deer|hind]] deer, a [[boar]] and a she-wolf. Each year they must mate and produce an offspring which is sent to Math: [[Hyddwn]], [[Hychddwn]] and [[Bleiddwn]]; after three years Math releases his nephews from their punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 159, "Gilfaethwy and Gwydion"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chinese mythology]] has been described as "rich in stories about homosexuality".&lt;ref name=GLBTQchinese1&gt;Xiaomingxiong (2002), p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The mythological stories and folklore of China reflect ancient Chinese perspectives toward homosexuality, rather than modern views. These myths are greatly influenced by [[Religion|religious beliefs]], particularly [[Taoist]] and  [[Confucian]], and later incorporated [[Buddhist]] teachings.&lt;ref name=GLBTQchinese1/&gt;

The pre-Confucian and pre-Taoist tradition of China was predominately shamanistic. Male same-sex love was believed to have originated in the mythical south, thus homosexuality is sometimes still called "Southern wind". From this period, numerous spirits or deities were associated with homosexuality, bisexuality and transgenderism. These include [[Chou Wang]], [[Lan Caihe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Eberhard|first=Wolfram|title=A Dictionary of Chinese Symbols: Hidden Symbols in Chinese Life and Thought|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London|year=1986|isbn=0-415-00228-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/journals/jras/1916-21.htm |title=The Eight Immortals |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shan Gu]], and [[Yu the Great]], and [[Gun (Chinese)|Gun]].&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 12, "Chinese [[Shamanism]]..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Homosexual encounters are common in Chinese folk stories. The animal spirits or fairies often choose same-sex partners, usually young men or boys.&lt;ref name=GLBTQchinese2&gt;Xiaomingxiong (2002), p.2&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Xiaomingxiong]], one exception to this age preference is the [[dragon]], a powerful mythological beast. [[Chinese dragons]] "consistently enjoy[s] sexual relationships with older men", one example being in the tale of "Old Farmer and a Dragon", in which a sixty-year-old farmer is forcibly sodomised by a passing dragon, resulting in wounds from penetration and bites that require medical attention.&lt;ref name=GLBTQchinese2/&gt;

Despite the later literature of some Taoist schools disapproval of homosexuality,&lt;ref&gt;The Ultra Supreme Elder Lord's Scripture of Precepts(太上老君戒經), in "The Orthodox Tao Store"(正統道藏)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Great Dictionary of Taoism"(道教大辭典), by Chinese Taoism Association, published in China in 1994, {{ISBN|7-5080-0112-5}}/B.054&lt;/ref&gt;[[Tu Er Shen]] is a deity in [[Chinese folklore]] who manages the love and sex between homosexual men. His name literally means "[[rabbit]] deity". According to "The Tale of the Rabbit God" in the ''[[Zi Bu Yu]]'', Tu Er Shen was originally a man called [[Hu Tianbao]], who fell in love with a handsome young imperial inspector of the [[Fujian|Fujian Province]]. One day Hu Tianbao was caught peeping on the inspector, at which point he confessed his reluctant affections for the other man. The imperial inspector had Hu Tianbao [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by beating. Since his crime was one of love, underworld officials decided to right the injustice by delegating Hu Tianbao as the god and safeguarder of homosexual affections.&lt;ref&gt;Szonyi, Michael "The Cult of Hu Tianbao and the Eighteenth-Century Discourse of Homosexuality." [[Late Imperial China]] – Volume 19, Number 1, June 1998, pp. 1–25, [[Johns Hopkins University|The Johns Hopkins University]] Press&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, the priest Lu Wei-ming (盧威明) founded a temple in [[Yonghe City]], [[Taiwan]] that worships Tu'er Shen and provides spiritual comfort for homosexual Taoists.&lt;ref&gt;"Taoist homosexuals turn to the Rabbit God: The Rabbit Temple in Yonghe enshrines a deity based on an historic figure that is believed to take care of homosexuals" BY Ho Yi, STAFF REPORTER, ''Taipei Times,'' Sunday, October 21, 2007, Page 17 [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2007/10/21/2003384192]&lt;/ref&gt;

For thousands of years, male homosexuality was referred to in literature by alluding to two semi-legendary figures from the early [[Zhou Dynasty]]. The first was [[Mizi Xia]] and the [[Homosexuality in China#Terminology in China|half-eaten peach]] which he shared with his lover, the actual historical figure, [[Duke Ling of Wei]]. The second was [[Lord Long Yang]], who convinced an unnamed King of [[Wei (Spring and Autumn Period)|Wei]] to remain faithful to him by comparing himself to a small fish which the King might throw back if a larger fish came along. While both Mizi Xia and Lord Long Yang may have actually existed, nothing is known about them beyond their defining stories, and their presence in Chinese literature was very much that of legendary characters who served as [[archetypes]] of homosexual love.&lt;ref&gt;Hinsch, Bret.  (1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve. Published by the University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese===
According to [[Japanese folklore]] and [[Japanese mythology|mythology]], homosexuality was introduced into the world by [[Shinu No Hafuri]] and his lover [[Ama No Hafuri]]. These were servants of a primordial goddess, possibly the [[Solar deity|sun goddess]] [[Amaterasu]]. Upon the death of Shinu, Ama [[Suicide|committed suicide]] from grief, and the couple were buried together in the same grave.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 305, "Shinu No Hafuri"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homosexualities|last=Murray |first=Stephen O.|page=72 |year=2000|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=US |isbn=978-0-226-55194-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some tellings of the story, the sun did not shine on the burial place until the lovers were disinterred and buried separately, although whether the offense to the sun was due to the homosexual relationship is not stated.&lt;ref name=long67&gt;{{Cite book|title=Men, homosexuality, and the Gods: an exploration into the religious significance of male homosexuality in world perspective|last=Long|first=Ronald Edwin |year=2004|publisher=Haworth Press|isbn=978-1-56023-152-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another tale, Amaterasu retreats from conflict with her brother [[Susanoo-no-Mikoto|Susanoo]] into a [[Amano-Iwato|cave]], depriving the Earth of sunlight and life. In order to coax Amaterasu from the cave, the deity of humour and dance, [[Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto|Ame No Uzume]], performs a bawdy sexual dance that involved exposing her breast and vulva, and inviting Amaterasu to admire them. On Amaterasu's stepping out of the cave, the transgender kami [[Ishi Kore Dome No Kami|Ishi Kori Dome]] held up a magical mirror, and the combination of the dance and her reflection fascinate Amaterasu so much that she does not notice other spirits closing the cave entrance behind her.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 50, "Amaterasu Omi Kami"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 186, "Ame No Uzume"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 186, "Ishi Kore Dome No Kami"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shinto]] gods are involved in all aspects of life, including the practice of [[shudo]] (traditional [[pederasty]]). An overarching patron deity of male-male love and sex, "Shudō Daimyōjin", exists in some [[folk Shinto]] sects, but is not a part of the standard Shinto pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Pflugfelder, Gregory |title=Cartographies of Desire: Male-Male Sexuality in Japanese Discourse, 1600–1950 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=2000|isbn=0-520-20909-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other kami associated with same-sex love or gender variance include:  [[Shirabyōshi]], female or [[transmasculine]] kami, represented as half-human, half-snake. They are linked to Shinto priests of the same name, who are usually female (or occasionally transgender men) and perform [[Ceremonial dance|ritual dances]] in traditional men's clothing;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 305 "Shirabyoshi"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yama-no-Kami|Ōyamakui]], a transgender mountain spirit that protects industry and childbearing;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 259, "Oyamakui"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Inari (mythology)|Inari]], the kami of agriculture and rice, who is depicted as various genders, the most common representations being a young female food goddess, an old man carrying rice, and an androgynous [[bodhisattva]].&lt;ref name=Smyers8&gt;Smyers, Karen Ann.

[[Hindu mythology]] has many examples of deities changing gender, manifesting as different genders at different times, or combining to form [[androgynous]] or [[hermaphroditic]] beings. Gods change sex or manifest as an [[Avatar]] of the opposite sex in order to facilitate sexual congress.&lt;ref name=conner305&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 305, "Shiva"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=conner67&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 67, "Ardhararishvara "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanita69&gt;Vanita, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanita94&gt;Vanita, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vanita94" /&gt;&lt;ref name=BLSmith5&gt;Smith, B.L., p. 5, ''Legitimation of Power in South Asia''&lt;/ref&gt; Non-divine beings also undergo sex-changes through the actions of the gods, as the result of curses or blessings, or as the natural outcome of [[reincarnation]].

Hindu mythology contains numerous incidents where sexual interactions serve a non-sexual, sacred purpose; in some cases, these are same-sex interactions. Sometimes the gods condemn these interactions but at other times they occur with their blessing.&lt;ref name=Pattanaik99&gt;Pattanaik (2001), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanitu100&gt;Vanita &amp; Kidwai (2001), pp. 100–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to stories of gender and sexual variance that are generally accepted by mainstream Hinduism, modern scholars and [[queer]] [[activist]]s have highlighted LGBT themes in lesser known texts, or inferred them from stories that traditionally are considered to have no homoerotic subtext. Such analyses have caused disagreements about the true meaning of the ancient stories.&lt;ref name=Greenberg307&gt;Greenberg, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanitu&gt;Vanita &amp; Kidwai (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist===
{{See also|LGBT topics and Buddhism}}
In general, [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist scripture]] does not distinguish same-sex sexual activity from heterosexual activity, both being seen as non-conducive to spiritual growth.&lt;ref name=Greenberg303&gt;Greenberg (2007), p. 303, "Homosexuality in Buddhism"&lt;/ref&gt; Many Buddhist moral laws arise from traditional tales and legends, and this is also the case with the Buddhist view of LGBT people. For example, the monastic rules that prohibit LGBT clergy in some sects come from interpretation of the epic [[Mahavagga]]. In the Pandakavathu section of this work, tales about "pandaka" (sexually or gender variant people) are related. In one such story, a Pandaka first approaches a group of monks, then a group of novices, and finally elephant keepers asking those in each group to "defile" them. Although rejected each time and driven away, the encounters create an ethos of [[innuendo]] about the monks, leading the [[Buddha]] to bar pandakas from the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Cabezón, pp. 207–208&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Daienin Kannon.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Guanyin statue in Daienin&lt;br /&gt;[[Mount Koya|Mt. Koya]], Japan]]
According to Cabezón and Greenberg, this stricture is not applied to lay people, and many Buddhist stories include positive portrayals of non-sexual same-sex relationships. These are particularly common in the "[[Jātaka]]" stories ([[Folklore of India|Indian folklore]] tales of Buddha's previous lives), in which the Buddha almost always has a devoted male companion. In some tales they would even be reincarnated together as animal pairs "ruminating and cuddling together, very happy, head to head, muzzle to muzzle, horn to horn".&lt;ref name=Greenberg303/&gt; Although not shown as sexual, these relationships between men are loving, and contrast with the difficult marriages to shrewish wives in many stories. Harvey however, disagress and states that this is a reference to brotherly love and not a platonic relationship.&lt;ref name=Greenberg303/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = harvey | first = peter | title = An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-511-80080-1 | pages=421-}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional [[Thailand|Thai]] [[Theravada Buddhism]], accounts propose that "homosexuality arises as a [[Karma|karmic]] consequence of violating Buddhist proscriptions against heterosexual misconduct" in a previous incarnation&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Peter (1995). ''Thai Buddhist accounts of male homosexuality and AIDS in the 1980s''. The Australian Journal of Anthropology, Vol.6 No.3, pp.140–153. December 1995. [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-EPT/anth.htm Text online]&lt;/ref&gt; Thai Buddhist's also believe the disciple [[Ānanda]] to have been reincarnated a number of times as a female, and in one previous life to have been transgender.&lt;ref name=Greenberg303/&gt; Ānanda is popular and charismatic, and known for his emotionality. In one story of one of his previous lives, Ānanda was a solitary [[yogi]] that fell in love with a [[naga (mythology)|Nāga]], a serpent king of Indian folklore, who took the form of a handsome youth. The relationship became sexual, causing Ānanda to regretfully break off contact, to avoid distraction from spiritual matters.&lt;ref name=Greenberg303/&gt;

According to one legend, male same-sex love was introduced into Japan by the founder of the True Word ([[Shingon]]) sect of Japanese esoteric Buddhism, [[Kūkai]]. Historians however, point that this is probably not true, since Kūkai was an enthusiastic follower of monastic regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Cabezón, pp. 215–217&lt;/ref&gt; Some Bodhisattvas change sexes in different incarnations, which causes some to associate this to homosexuality and transgenderism. [[Guanyin]],&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 198, "Kannon"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Both sexes in some traditions. https://books.google.com/books?id=WDekApY7Y94C&amp;pg=PA26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 208, "Guan Yin"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avalokiteśvara]],&lt;ref name=conner7&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 7, "Buddhism"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] are known to have different gender representations.&lt;ref name=conner7/&gt;

===Philippines===

In pre-colonial Philippines, particularly in the colonies and kingdoms, account of the Death god, Sidapa. Sidapa is depicted as robust and handsome and he fought the god of war, Macanduc, and the goddess of the tides to obtain the lover he pursued: a boy.The god of death pursued one of the comely lunar deity: Bulan the boy moon. Their relationship is the perfect example of [[Pederasty]]. The myth tells how the god of death, who was lonely, saw the beauty of the moons and desired them, but he had competition. He battled and defeated the other gods and goddess. He romantically pursued the boy moon who resides in the heavens. The god of death ordered the mermaids and birds to sing praises for the boy moon. He also asked the flowers to makes sweet perfumes and nectar for Bulan, and lastly, he gave light to the fireflies so the boy moon could descend to where they could meet. Stories say that Bulan was so fair that the vicious mermaids became gentle and that the fishes and birds forgot to fly and swim. Sidapa took the boy moon to be his child bride and, as legends say and most natives still believe, they reside together sleeping in each other's arms in Mt. Majaas, in the province of Antique

==African mythologies==

===West African, Yoruba and Dahomean (Vodun)===
{{See also|LGBT themes in African diasporic mythologies}}
The celestial [[creator deity]] of [[Dahomey mythology]] is [[Mawu-Lisa]], formed by a merger of the twin brother and sister gods Lisa (the moon) and Mawa (the sun). In combined form, they presented as intersex or transgender (with changing gender).&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 228, "Mawu-Lisa"&lt;/ref&gt; Other androgynous gods include [[Nana Buluku]], the "Great mother" that gave birth to Lisa and Mawa and created the universe, and contains both male and female essences.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 247, "Nanan-bouclou"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Akan people]] of Ghana have a pantheon of gods that includes personifications of [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]]. These personification manifest as androgynous or transgender deities, and include [[Abrao(deity)|Abrao]] (Jupiter),&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 40, "Abrao"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aku(deity)|Aku]] (Mercury),&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 47, "Aku"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Awo(deity)|Awo]] (Moon).&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 79, "Awo"&lt;/ref&gt;

Possession by spirits is an integral part of [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] and other African spiritual traditions. The possessed are usually women, but can also be men, and both genders are regarded as the "bride" of the deity while possessed. The language used to describe possession has a sexual and violent connotation but unlike in Yoruba-derived American religions, there is no link assumed between possession and homosexual or gender variant activity in [[everyday life]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray &amp; Roscoe (2001), pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zimbabwean===
The mythology of the [[Shona people]] of Zimbabwe is ruled over by an androgynous creator god called [[Mwari]], who occasionally splits into separate male and female aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 243, "Mwari"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egyptian===
Few records of homosexuality exist in [[Egyptian mythology]],&lt;ref&gt;Murray Roscoe (1997), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; and the written and pictorial works are reticent in representing sexualities.&lt;ref name=Haggerty422&gt;Haggerty, p.422&lt;/ref&gt; The sources that do exist indicate that same-sex relations were regarded negatively, and that penetrative sex was an aggressive act of dominance and power, shameful to the receiver, a common view in the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean basin]] area.&lt;ref name=Haggerty423&gt;Haggerty, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt;

The most well-known example of this occurs in the power-struggle between the sky-god [[Horus]], and his uncle [[Set (mythology)|Set]], the destructive god of the desert. Set's attempts to prove his superiority include schemes of seduction, in which he compliments Horus on his buttocks and tries to anally penetrate him. Unknowingly failing, Set ejaculates between Horus's thighs, allowing Horus to collect his semen to use against him.&lt;ref name=Haggerty422/&gt; Set believes that he has conquered Horus by having "performed this aggressive act against him".&lt;ref name=Haggerty423/&gt; Horus subsequently throws it in the river, so that he may not be said to have been inseminated by Set. Horus then deliberately spreads his own semen on some lettuce, which was Set's favorite food (the Egyptians thought that lettuce was phallic). After Set has eaten the lettuce, they go to the gods to try to settle the argument over the rule of Egypt. The gods first listen to Set's claim of dominance over Horus, and call his semen forth, but it answers from the river, invalidating his claim. Then, the gods listen to Horus' claim of having dominated Set, and call his semen forth, and it answers from inside Set.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theologywebsite.com/etext/egypt/horus.shtml Theology website: The 80 Years of Contention Between Horus and Seth]&lt;/ref&gt; The association with an evil god such as Set reinforces the negativity of homosexual relationships, even for the active, participant.&lt;ref name=Haggerty423/&gt;

At least some authors, however, have interpreted an at least more neutral message. In some versions, the act between Horus and Set was consensual, if improper, and Set's consumption of Horus' seed produced [[Thoth]]'s lunar disc, thus being somewhat positive in outcome.&lt;ref&gt;http://epistle.us/hbarticles/ancientegypt1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Set was not demonised until very late in Egyptian history, and the sexual act has been recorded since the first versions.

Human fertility was a major aspect of Egyptian mythology, and was often entwined with the crop fertility provided by annual flooding of the river Nile.&lt;ref name=Haggerty423/&gt; This connection was shown in iconography of Nile-gods, such as [[Hapy]], god of the Nile River, and [[Wadj-wer]], god of [[Nile Delta|the Nile Delta]], who although male were depicted with female attributes such as pendulous breasts, symbolizing the fertility the river provides.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 170, "Hapy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Many female pharaohs and goddesses were depicted with male genitalia and it is known a few took male descriptions.

Isis and her sister Nephthys are considered to possibly be a couple, both having children with Osiris and Wadjet the scorpion goddess is also associated with her. Isis also appeared in the Greek myth of Iphis, allowing two women to marry.

==Mythologies of Oceania==

===Australian Aboriginal===
The [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous population]] of [[Australia]] have a shamanistic religion, which includes a pantheon of gods. The [[rainbow serpent]] god [[Ungud]] has been described as androgynous or transgender. Shaman identify their erect penises with Ungud, and his androgyny inspires some to undergo ceremonial subincision of the penis.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 329, "Ungud"&lt;/ref&gt; Angamunggi is another transgender rainbow-serpent god, worshipped as a "giver of life".&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 58, "Angamunggi"&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Australian mythological beings include [[Labarindja]], blue-skinned wild women or "demon women" with hair the colour of smoke.&lt;ref&gt;Róheim (2008), p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; Stories about them show them to be completely uninterested in romance or sex with men, and any man forcing his attention upon them could die, due the "evil magic in their vaginas". They are sometimes depicted as gynandrous or intersex, having both a penis and a vagina. This is represented in ritual by having their part played by men in women's clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 211, "Labarindja"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polynesian: Hawaiian and Maori===
Polynesian religions feature a complex pantheon of deities. Many of these gods refer to their companions of either sex as "aikane", a term encompassing passionate friendship and sexual-love, often in bisexual contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 46, "Aikane"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MorrisCook&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Robert J.|title=Aikāne: Accounts of Hawaiian Same-Sex Relationships in the Journals of Captain Cook's Third Voyage (1776-80)|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|year=1990|volume=19|issue=4|pages=21–54|url=http://www.robertjmorris.net|doi=10.1300/j082v19n04_03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wahineomo]], a goddess of [[Hawaiian mythology]] whose name means "thrush woman", is depicted in relationships with other goddesses [[Hi'iaka]] and [[Hopoe]].&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 344, "Wahineomo"&lt;/ref&gt; When Hi'iaka was suspected of infidelity with her sister [[Pele (Goddess)|Pele]]'s husband, the volcano goddess Pele killed Hi'iaka's beloved Hopoe by covering her in lava.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 246, "Pele"&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Wahineomo and Hopoe, Hi'iaka had lesbian relationships with the fern goddess [[Pauopalae]] and Pele-devotee [[Omeo]].&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 263, "Pauopalae"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 254, "Omeo"&lt;/ref&gt; Omeo was part of the retinue that brought the bisexual Prince [[Lohiau]] to Pele after his death. During his life Lohiau was the lover of both the female Pele and male [[Paoa]].&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 214, "Lohiau"&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Polynesian LGBT gods include the gay couple [[Pala-Mao]] and [[Kumi-Kahi]],&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 260, "Pala-Mao"&lt;/ref&gt; and the bisexual goddess [[Haakauilanani]], who was both servant and lover of the "Earth mother" creator goddess [[Rangi and Papa|Papa]] and her husband [[Wakea]].&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 261, "Papa"&lt;/ref&gt; Non-divine LGBT characters also exist in [[Polynesian mythology]], such as the (male) shaman [[Pakaa]] and his chief and lover [[Keawe-Nui-A-'umi]],&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 260, "Pakaa"&lt;/ref&gt; and the famed fisherman [[Nihooleki]], who was married to a woman but also had a relationship with the pig god [[Kamapua'a]].&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 249, "Nihooleki"&lt;/ref&gt; Kamapua'a was also responsible for sending the love-god [[Lonoikiaweawealoha]] to seduce Pele's brother gods [[Hiiakaluna]] and [[Hiiakalalo]], hence distracting them from attacking him.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 217, "Lonoikiaweawealoha"&lt;/ref&gt; Kamapua'a's other male lovers included [[Limaloa]], the bisexual god of the sea and mirages.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 215, "Limaloa"&lt;/ref&gt;

Hi'iaka, a daughter or sister of Pele had several female lovers including Hopoe, Omeo, Wahineʻomaʻo, and Pauo-Palae

===Pacific Island: Celebes, Vanuatu, Borneo and the Philippines===
Third gender, or gender variant, spiritual intermediaries are found in many Pacific island cultures, including the [[bajasa]] of the Toradja Bare'e people of [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], the [[bantut]] of the [[Taosug]] people of the south [[Philippines]], and the [[bayoguin]] of the pre-Christian Philippines. These shamans are typically biologically male but display feminine behaviours and appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 81, "Bajasa"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 82, "Bantut"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 85, "Bayoguin"&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-Christian Philippines had a [[Polytheism|polytheistic religion]], which included the transgender or hermaphroditic gods [[Bathala]] and  [[Malyari]], whose names means "Man and Woman in One" and "Powerful One" respectively; these gods are worshipped by the Bayagoin.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 84, "Bathala"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 225, "Malyari"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Big Nambas]] of [[Vanuatu]] have the concept of divinely approved-of homoerotic relationships between men, with the older partner called the "dubut". This name is derived from the word for shark, referring to the patronage of the shark-human hydrid creator god [[Qat (deity)|Qat]].&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 90, "Big Nambas"&lt;/ref&gt;

Among their pantheon of deities, the [[Ngaju people|Ngaju]] [[Dayak people|Dayak]] of [[Borneo]] worship [[Mahatala-Jata]], an androgynous or transgender god. The male part of this god is [[Mahatala]], who rules the Upperworld, and is depicted as a [[hornbill]] living above the clouds on a mountain-top; the female part is [[Jata]], who rules the Underworld from under the sea in the form of a water-snake. These two manifestations are linked via a jewel-encrusted bridge that is seen in the physical world as a rainbow. Mahatala-Jata is served by "balian", female hierodules, and "basir" transgender shamans metaphorically described as "water snakes which are at the same time hornbills".&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 224, "Mahatala-Jata"&lt;/ref&gt; Similar transgender shamans, the "manang bali", are found in the [[Iban people|Iban Dayak]] people. Girls fated to become manang bali may first dream of becoming a woman and also of being summoned by the god/dess [[Menjaya Raja Manang]] or the goddess [[Ini (goddess)|Ini]].&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 225, "Manang bali"&lt;/ref&gt; Menjaya Raja Manang began existence as a malegod, until his [[Sengalang Burong|brother]]'s wife became sick. This prompted Menjara into becoming the world's first healer, allowing her to cure her [[sister-in-law]], but this treatment also resulted in Menjara changing into a woman or androgynous being.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 230, "Menjaya Raja Manang"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythologies of the Americas==
[[File:Xochipilli 6.jpg|thumb|right|Image of [[Xochipilli]], the Aztec god of homosexuality]]

===Maya and Aztec===
The Mayan god [[Chin (Mayan god)|Chin]], reported from the sixteenth century, is said to have introduced [[homoeroticism]] into the Mayan culture and subsequently became associated with same-sex love. His example inspired noble families to purchase young men as lovers for their sons, creating legal relationships akin to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 110, "Chin"&lt;/ref&gt; An important Mayan deity best known from the Classical period (200-900 AD), the so-called [[Tonsured Maize God]], is often depicted in [[Maya art]] as an effeminate young man associated with art and dance, and is thought to have constituted a 'third gender'.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Looper, 'Women-Men (and Men-Women): Classic Maya Rulers and the Third Gender', in Traci Ardren ed., ''Ancient Maya Women'', pp. 171–-202. Walnut Creek (Cal.): Altamira Press 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xochipilli]] ('Flower Prince') was the god of [[art]], games, beauty, [[dance]], [[flower]]s, [[maize]], and song in [[Aztec mythology]], and also the patron of homosexuals and homosexual prostitutes {{dubious|date=July 2018}} .&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;Greenberg, David. ''The Construction of Homosexuality.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-226-30628-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This role  "suggests a complex set of associations including the role of entertainer, the love of exotic foods and perfumes, male gender variance, and same-sex eroticism".&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 351, "Xochipilli"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native American and Inuit===
{{See also|Two-spirit}}
In Inuit shamanism, the first two humans were Aakulujjuusi and Uumarnituq, both male. This same-sex couple desired company and decided to mate. This sexual encounter resulted in pregnancy for Uumarnituq. As he was physically not equipped to give birth, a spell was cast that changed his sex, giving him a vagina capable of passing the child. The now-female Uumarnituq was also responsible for introducing war into the world via magic, in order to curb overpopulation.&lt;ref&gt;Penczac (2003), p. 39, "Aakulujjuusi and Uumarnituq"&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess [[Sedna (mythology)|Sedna]] is an [[Inuit]] creator deity, with dominion of marine animals. She is depicted as [[gynandrous]] or hermaphroditic in some myths, and is served by [[Two-Spirit|two-spirit]] shamans. Other myths show Sedna as a bisexual or lesbian, living with her female partner at the bottom of the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Penczac (2003), p. 51, "Sedna"&lt;/ref&gt;

Many stories of Native Americans include Coyote seducing apparently lesbian couples, usually much to his detriment in the end. Other great spirits will sometimes take over a female body if no other presents itself when they wish to seduce a beautiful young woman.

===Voodoo===
[[File:Samedi.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Baron Samedi, a bisexual lwa.]]
{{See also|Haitian Vodou and sexual orientation|LGBT themes in African diasporic mythologies#Voodoo}}
A large number of spirits or deities ([[Loa|lwa]]) exist in [[Haitian Vodou|Haitian]] and [[Louisiana Voodoo]]. These lwa may be regarded as families of individuals or as a singular entity with distinct aspects, with links to particular areas of life.

Some lwa have particular links with magic, [[ancestor worship]] or death such as the [[Ghede]]s and Barons. A number of these are further particularly associated with transgenderism or same-sex interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 157, "Ghede"&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[Ghede Nibo]], a spirit caring for those who die young. He is sometimes depicted as an effeminate [[drag queen]] and inspires those he inhabits to lascivious sexuality of all kinds, especially transgender or lesbian behaviour in women.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 157, "Ghede Nibo"&lt;/ref&gt; Ghede Nibo's parents are [[Baron Samedi]] and [[Maman Brigitte]]; Baron Samedi is the leader of the Ghedes and Barons and is depicted as bisexual dandy or occasionally transgender, wearing a [[top-hat]] and [[frock coat]] along with a women's skirts and shoes. Samedi has a tendency toward "lascivious movements" that cross gender boundaries and also imply a lust for [[anal sex]].&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 83, "Baron Samedi"&lt;/ref&gt;

Other barons displaying gay behaviour are Baron Lundy and Baron Limba, who are lovers and teach a type of homoerotic nude wrestling at their school, believed to increase magical potency.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 83, "Baron Limba" &amp; "Baron Lundy"&lt;/ref&gt; Baron Oua Oua, who often manifests with a childlike aspect, has been called the baron "most closely linked to homosexuality" by Voodoo practictioners.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 83, "Baron Oua Oua"&lt;/ref&gt;

Another lwa, [[Erzulie]], is associated with love, sensuality and beauty. Erzulie can manifest aspects that are LGBT-related, including transgender or amazonian traits, in addition to traditionally feminine guises. When inhabiting men, these aspects can result in transgender or homoerotic behaviour, whereas they may result in lesbianism or [[Misandry|anti-male]] sentiment in women. Erzulie Freda is seen as the protector of gay men, and Erzulie Dantor is associated with lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 135, "Erzulie"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Santería and Candomblé===
{{See also|LGBT themes in African diasporic mythologies#Santería and Candomblé|l1=LGBT themes in Santería and Candomblé mythologies}}
[[Santería]] and [[Candomblé]] are syncretic religions derived from Yoruba diasporic beliefs and [[catholicism]], most prevalent in South Americas, including [[Cuba]] and [[Brazil]]. Their mythologies have many similarities to that of Yoruba, and contains a pantheon of [[Orísha]]s (spirits), comparable to (and often identified with) the lwa of Voodoo.

In one Cuban Santería "pataki", or mythological story, the [[sea god]]dess [[Yemaha]] is tricked into incestuous sex with her son [[Shango]]. To hide her shame at this event, she banished her other two sons, [[Inle (Santería)|Inle]] and [[Abbata]], to live at the bottom of the ocean, additionally cutting out Inle's tongue and making Abbata deaf. As a result of their isolation and loneliness, Inle and Abbata become passionate friends and then lovers, able to communicate empathically. This pataki is used to explain the origin of incest, [[muteness]], and [[deafness]] in addition to homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 39, "Abbata"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Eastern mythologies==

===Mesopotamian (Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, Assyrian), Phoenician, and Canaanite===
The ancient regions of [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Canaan]] were inhabited by a succession of overlapping civilisations: [[Sumer]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Akkadia]], [[Babylonia]], [[Assyria]]. The mythologies of these people were interlinked, often containing the same stories and mythological gods and heroes under different names.

The Sumerian [[creation myth]], "The Creation of Man", from circa [[20th century BC|2000 BCE]], lists a number of physically differing people created by the goddess [[Ninmah]].&lt;ref group=n name=y&gt;Ninmah (Sumerian: "Great Queen") has many names, and is identified with [[Ninhursag]] (Sumerian: "Lady of the mountain"), [[Nintu]] (Akkadian: "Lady of Birth"), [[Belet-ili]] (Babylonian: Lady of the gods), Aruru, Mami, Mamma. (Dalley (1998), p. 326)&lt;/ref&gt; These included "the woman who cannot give birth" and "the one who has no male organ or female organ", which have been regarded as being third gender or androgynous. [[Enki]], the supreme god, is accepting of these people and assigns them roles in society as "naditu" (priestesses) and "girsequ" (servants to the king).&lt;ref name=murray67&gt;Murray &amp; Roscoe (1997), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; The Akkadian mythical epic ''[[Atrahasis]]'' contains another iteration of this story, in which Enki specifically requests that Nintu create a "third-category" of people that includes third-gender people, barren women, and an "infant-stealing demon".&lt;ref name=murray67/&gt;&lt;ref group=n name=y/&gt;

In ancient Mesopotamia, worship of the goddess Inanna included "soothing laments" sung by third gender priests called "[[Gala (priests)|gala]]".&lt;ref group=n name=Ishtar/&gt; According to [[First Babylonian Dynasty|old Babylonian]] texts, these priests were created specifically for this purpose by the god Enki. Some gala took female names, and the word itself means "penis+anus", hinting at their androgynous status.&lt;ref name=murray65&gt;Murray &amp; Roscoe (1997), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural practice, or "me", of androgynous, third-gender or homoerotically inclined priests were part of those said to have been stolen by Innana from Enki in "[[Ishtar#Descent into the underworld|The Descent of Innana]]" myth.&lt;ref name=murray65/&gt; In the Babylonian ''[[Erra (god)|Erra]]'' myth, the gender of the "kurggaru" and "assinnu" priests was supernaturally changed by the goddess [[Ishtar]], making them feminine.&lt;ref group=n name=Ishtar&gt;Inanna (Sumerian) is identified with Ishtar (Babylonian), [[Astarte]] (Phoenician), [[Atargatis]] (Syrian) and in later texts Aphrodite (Greek).&lt;/ref&gt;  The changes may also facilitate possession by the goddess, causing a psychological change or prompting physical castration.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (2002), p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between the semi-divine hero Gilgamesh and his "intimate companion" Enkidu in the Sumerian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' has been interpreted as a sexual one by some modern scholars. Enkidu was created as a companion to Gilgamesh by the goddess Aruru, and civilised by a harlot.&lt;ref group=n name=y/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 159, "Gilgamesh and Enkidu"&lt;/ref&gt; As Gilgamesh and Enkidu were of similar ages and status, their relationship has been seen as relatively egalitarian, in contrast with the typically pederastic mode of [[ancient Greece]] or Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Murray &amp; Roscoe (1997), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
{{See also|LGBT topics and Zoroastrianism}}
[[Zoroastrianism]] has been said to have a "hatred of male anal intercourse". This is reflected in its mythology: When [[Ahriman]], the "Spirit of Aridity and Death" and "Lord of Lies", seeks to destroy the world, he engages in self-sodomy. This homosexual self intercourse causes an "explosion of evil power" and results in the birth of a host of evil minions and demons.&lt;ref&gt;Long, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Ahriman has also been regarded as the patron of men who partake of homosexual sex.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), pp. 45, "Ahriman"&lt;/ref&gt; However, this negative portrayal of homosexuality in Zoroastrianism is not found in the [[Gathas]], their original holy book which is said to be the direct sayings of the prophet [[Zoroaster]].

[[File:David and Jonathan.jpg|150px|thumb|David and Jonathan in "La Somme le Roy" (1290 CE)]]

===Biblical===
{{See also|The Bible and homosexuality|LGBT topics and Judaism}}
The story of [[David and Jonathan]] has been described as "biblical Judeo-Christianity's most influential justification of homoerotic love".&lt;ref name=Gayhistories326&gt;Haggerty, p.380&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between David and Jonathan is mainly covered in the [[Old Testament]] First [[Book of Samuel]], as part of the story of David's ascent to power. The mainstream view found in modern [[biblical exegesis]] argues that the relationship between the two is merely a close [[platonic love|platonic]] [[friendship]].&lt;ref&gt;DeYoung, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martti Nissinen, Kirsi Stjerna, Homoeroticism in the Biblical World, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has recently been a tradition of interpreting the love between David and Jonathan as romantic or sexual.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, John. ''Same-sex Unions in Premodern Europe.'' New York: Vintage, 1994. (pp. 135–137)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halperin, David M. ''One Hundred Years of Homosexuality.'' New York: Routledge, 1990. (p. 83)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''When Heroes Love:. The Ambiguity of Eros in the Stories of Gilgamesh and David'' (New York &amp; Chichester, [[Columbia University Press]], 2005), pp. 165–231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Homosexuality and Liminality in the Gilgamesh and Samuel'' (Amsterdam, Hakkert, 2007), pp. 28–63&lt;/ref&gt;

Another biblical hero, [[Noah]], best known for his building an [[Noah's Ark|ark]] to save animals and worthy people from a divinely caused [[deluge (mythology)|flood]], later became a wine-maker. One day he drinks too much wine, and fell asleep naked in his tent. When his son [[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]] enters the tent, he sees his father naked, and Canaan, One of Ham's sons is [[Curse of Ham|cursed]] with banishment. In Jewish tradition, it is also suggested that Ham had anal sex with Noah or castrated him.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks p. 250, "Noah"&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth and Naomi are often thought to have been a couple, Ruth only remarrying to satisfy the law at the time and ensure her and Naomi's safety. When Ruth gave birth the women of the town said that the baby was Naomi's. To this day the vow Ruth made to Naomi is used in many lesbian weddings.

[[Saints Sergius and Bacchus]]: Sergius and Bacchus's close relationship has led many modern commentators to believe they were lovers. The most popular evidence for this view is that the oldest text of their martyrology, in the [[Greek language]], describes them as "erastai", or lovers.&lt;ref name=Boswell&gt;Boswell, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[John Boswell]] considered their relationship to be an example of an early Christian [[same-sex marriage|same-sex union]], reflecting his contested view of [[History of Christianity and homosexuality|tolerant early Christian attitudes toward homosexuality]].&lt;ref name=Boswell /&gt; The official stance of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] is that the ancient Eastern tradition of [[Adelphopoiesis|adelphopoiia]], which was done to form a "brotherhood" in the name of God, and is traditionally associated with these two saints, had no sexual implications. In a similar matter regarding paired male saints, [[Saints Cosmas and Damian]] have been referred as potentially originally having homoerotic overtones, and that later Christian traditions added them being brothers to conceal that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jordan, Mark D. |title=The silence of Sodom: homosexuality in modern Catholicism |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=2000 |isbn=0-226-41041-2}} on the nature of "brotherly love", p.174&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Sebastian is a long-standing [[gay icon]].&lt;ref name=QUEER&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/subjects_st_sebastian.html |title=Subjects of the Visual Arts: St. Sebastian |work=[[glbtq.com]] |accessdate=1 August 2007 |year=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901002221/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/subjects_st_sebastian.html |archivedate= 1 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of his strong, shirtless physique, the symbolism of the arrows penetrating his body, and the look on his face of rapturous pain have intrigued artists (gay or otherwise) for centuries, and began the first explicitly gay cult in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=QUEER/&gt; Richard A.

===Islamic and Pre-Islamic Arabian===
{{See also|LGBT topics and Islam}}

[[Islamic mythology|Islamic folk beliefs]] remain common, such as the myths surrounding the [[Genie|Jinn]], long-lived shapeshifting spirits created from “smokeless fire” ([[Quran]] 15:27) and which correspond to the second group of angels who were created on the 5th day of Creation in the Jewish Qabalistic text, the [[Bahir]] (“The Illumination”) which were created from “flameless fire”. Some believe their shapeshifting abilities allow them to change gender at will but this is not consistent throughout the Islamic world although their ability to fly and travel exceedingly fast are consistent traits of the Jinn. The word Jinn means "hidden from sight" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]] |last=Wehr |first=Hans |authorlink=Hans Wehr |year=1994 |edition=4 |publisher=Spoken Language Services |location=Urbana, Illinois |isbn=978-0-87950-003-0 |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they are sometimes considered to be led by Shaytaan (Arabic for “Satan”) (who is the [[Devil (Islam)|Devil]] also known in Islam as Iblis “he who causes despair”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]] |last=Wehr |first=Hans |authorlink=Hans Wehr |year=1980 |edition=3 |publisher=Librairie du Liban |location=Beirut, Labanon|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;), representing powers of magic and rebellion, and posing as bringers of wealth as the devil acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 191, "Jinn"&lt;/ref&gt;

These traits are associated with the Jinn on account of Shaytaan's rebellion against the order of Allah to acknowledge Adam's ability to be superior to the Jinn and his refusal to bow down stating that “he was created from fire and Adam was created from clay”.([[Quran]] 7:11-12). The ability of the Jinn to travel to the heavens and listen to the discussion of angels and bring back what they overhear and relay it to seers and oracles has linked them with magic ([[Quran]] 72:8-10).

Jinn are served Al-Jink and [[Mukhannathun]], transgender and homoerotically-inclined wanderers with entertainment and spiritual functions.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 50, "Al-jink"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 240, "Mukhannathun"&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Arabic mythology|pre-Islamic Arabic]] and [[Oikoumene]] cultures, third-gender individuals, such as Mukhannathun were worshippers in widespread Goddess cults.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Roscoe (1997), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; These cults revered a trio of goddesses: Al-lāt, Al-Uzza, and Manāt [[Al-lāt]], [[Al-Uzza]], and [[Manāt]].&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), pp. 225–226, "Manat"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 50, "Al-lat"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 51, "Al-Uzza"&lt;/ref&gt; which in pre-Islamic Arabia were believed to be daughters of Allah but were denounced as false idols by Muhammad and the [[Quran]] (53:19-23).{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Arabian mythology also contains magical sex-changing springs or fountains, such as Al-Zahra. Upon bathing in or drinking from Al-Zahra, a person will change sex.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 51, "Al-Zahra"&lt;/ref&gt; The folklore of [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]], in northern [[Pakistan]] often includes same-sex relationships in which the "beloved" is a handsome younger man or boy.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Roscoe (1997), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ely Cathedral Exterior, Cambridgeshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|Ely Cathedral Exterior, Cambridgeshire]]The '''Lands and Liberties of the Church at Ely''' was a 1080 court case and an appeal, where the [[Abbott of Ely]] sought recovery of lands that had been taken at [[Norman Conquest|the Conquest]],&lt;ref&gt;Liber Eliensis 251; Publisher: Anglican Christian Society https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.35112203930609;view=1up;seq=93 p22].&lt;/ref&gt; 14 years beforehand.

The liberty of [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] was established in (King) Edgar's charters for the refounded monastery in 970. Edward the Confessor reiterated the liberties in 1052 and then William the Conqueror restated them.&lt;ref&gt;E. Miller, 'The Ely Land Pleas in the reign of William I', E.H.R. lxii (1947), 455.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wherever the church of Ely had lands, it had its own courts where defendants in cases of theft could vouch to warranty. Severing of a hand and death were among the common penalties for significant theft.&lt;ref&gt;Trinity College. Camb. O. 2. 1, f. 115a.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court case can be viewed as a part of a large collection of [[pleading]]s against a process of [[Norman conquest of England#Elite replacement|Norman]]ization that within a [[decade]] saw 64[[percent|%]] of land in [[England]] consolidated into the hands of just 150 individuals, and many of the [[nobility]] and churches deprived of their estates.

The span of the record includes the creation of the [[Apostolic Camera]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Apostolic Camera}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the effects of the [[Gregorian Reform]].&lt;ref name="l940"&gt;Levillain, 2002, p. 940.&lt;/ref&gt; The work constitutes the "latest and most authoritative of a series of attempts, starting in the eleventh century, to keep an accurate record of the financial claims of the Roman church".&lt;ref name="robinson262"/&gt; According to historian J.

The document has its roots in the ''[[Gelasian polyptych|Polyptych]]''  of [[Pope Gelasius I]], created at the end of the 5th century and continued for the next four centuries.&lt;ref name="l940"/&gt; The ''Liber Censuum'' proper was assembled in 1192 by Cencius Camerarius (future [[Pope Honorius III]]), [[papal chamberlain]] to [[Pope Clement III]] and [[Pope Celestine II]], and his assistant, [[William Rofio]], the clerk of the [[papal camera]],&lt;ref name="robinson261"/&gt; compiling information contained in the ''[[Collectio canonum]]'' of [[Deusdedit of San Pietro in Vincoli|Cardinal Deusdedit]] (1087), the ''[[Liber politicus]]'' of the [[Canon (priest)|Canon of St. Peter]] [[Benedict (given name)|Benedict]] (c. 1140), dossiers of the former chamberlain [[Boso Breakspeare|Boson]] (1149–1178), and the ''Gesta pauperis scolaris'' of [[Albinus (cardinal)|Cardinal Albinus]] (1188).&lt;ref name="l940"/&gt; Albinus' ''Gesta'' was the "most ambitious" of the ''Liber Censuum'' predecessor records, containing—according to Albinus—"whatever I knew or found in books of antiquities or what I myself heard and saw concerning the [[St. Peter|rights of St. Peter]]".&lt;ref name="robinson262"/&gt; The ''Liber Censuum'' also incorporates information from a contemporary general census and rent table of church properties organized by [[diocese]], the ''[[Ordo romanus]]'' (a description of religious ceremonies), as it pertains to the distribution of payments to the curia during such ceremonies, and works of pontifical history such as the ''[[Liber pontificalis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Levillain, 2002, p. 940-941.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest documentary evidence for the use of such a document of papal property rights goes back even earlier to an 1163/1164 letter from [[Pope Alexander III]] to the abbot of [[Lagny-sur-Marne]] requesting an annual payment of one ounce of gold, owed according to "a certain work among the books of the apostolic see".&lt;ref name="robinson262"/&gt; Although this specific claim dated to the time of [[Pope Urban II]], the abbot rejected it and there is no evidence Alexander III pursued it further.&lt;ref name="robinson262"/&gt; Such incidences are likely what Cencius refers to in the preface of the ''Liber Censuum'' as the "no little damage and loss" incurred by the church as a result of earlier records being "incomplete and neither written nor arranged authentically".&lt;ref name="robinson262"/&gt; Furthermore, the ''Liber Censuum'' was compiled at a time when the [[papal patrimony]] was threatened by the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Staufen]] emperor and individual payments from sources throughout the continent were being reduced by the evasiveness of payers and the inefficiency of the [[apostolic camera]].&lt;ref name="robinson262"/&gt;

==Contents==
The eighteen volumes of the ''Liber Censuum'' are divided between: census and rent tables (vol. 1-7), lists of bishoprics and monasteries directly administered by the Holy See (vol. 8), the ''[[Mirabilia]]'', a mythical description of the city of [[Rome]] (vol. 9),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Mirabilia Urbis Romæ}}&lt;/ref&gt; a version of the ''Ordo romanus'' (vol. 10-11), pontifical chronicles (vol. 12-13), and a [[chartulary]] (vol. 14-18).&lt;ref name="l941"&gt;Levillain, 2002, p. 941.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dating of the ''Liber Censuum'' to 1192 comports with the date given in the work's prologue, although this date may only be accurate for the record of taxes owed to the Holy See.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton and Duggan, 2003, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''Vita Gregorii IX'' was inserted into the codex of the ''Liber Censuum'' between 1254 and 1265, likely during the tenure of [[Pope Gregory IX]]'s nephew Niccolò as ''camerarius'' between 1255 and 1261.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews et al., 2004, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original version of the ''Liber Censuum'' by Cardinal Cencius begins:
:''Incipit liber censuum Rom. Eccl. a Centio Camerario compositus, secundum antiquorum patrum Regesta et memorialia diversa. A. incarn. dni MCXCII. Pont. Celestini Pp. III. A. II.''&lt;ref name="greg645"/&gt;

The ''Liber Censuum'' described itself as an authoritative list of "those monasteries, hospitals [...] cities, castles, manors [...] or those kings and princes belonging to the jurisdiction and property of St. Peter and the holy Roman church and owing ''census'' and how much they ought to pay".&lt;ref name="robinson261"&gt;Robinson, 1990, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of the rights recorded in the ''Liber Censuum'' is difficult to quantify exactly, and in any case, unlikely to have been paid in full.&lt;ref name="morris215"&gt;Morris, 1991, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; V. Pfaff, estimating historical [[exchange rate]]s, assessed the value of the revenue cited in the ''Liber Censuum'' as 1,214 gold ounces, a sum that would comprise less than 5% of [[Richard I of England]]'s annual income.&lt;ref name="morris215"/&gt; The ''Liber Censuum'', however, does not include several sources of papal revenue, in particular those collected [[in kind|in-kind]] and the revenues of the [[Churches of Rome|Basilicas of Rome]].&lt;ref name="morris215"/&gt;

==Later editions and legacy==
Papal historians regard the ''Liber Censuum'' as well-organized compared to the works which preceded it, and it includes empty spaces for anticipated updating.&lt;ref name="l941"/&gt; The intent was to allow future ''camerarii'' to add future entries "until the end of the world".&lt;ref name="robinson261"/&gt; The original version of the ''Liber Censuum'' was identified by Paul Fabre in the [[Vatican Library]] (''ms Vat. Lat.'' 8486), with its blank spaces having been exhausted during the pontificate of Cencius (who was elected [[Pope Honorius III]]) and five new volumes having been added to the beginning and end of the document.&lt;ref name="l941"/&gt; A new version of the ''Liber Censuum'' was compiled by Cardinal [[Nicholas Roselli]] (d. 1362) in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds et al., 2004, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1228 version of the ''Liber censuum'' in the library of [[Florence]] (''ms Riccard.'' 228) was updated through the [[Avignon Papacy]].&lt;ref name="l941"/&gt; By the end of the 13th century the addition of the dossiers of the cities of the [[Papal States]] and other papal biographies swelled the document to thirty-three volumes.&lt;ref name="l941"/&gt; A copy of the ''Liber censuum'', along with a [[papal tiara|tiara]], was given by [[Antipope Clement VIII]] to the [[papal legate|legate]] of [[Pope Martin V]] in 1429 as a sign of submission.&lt;ref name="l941"/&gt;

Modern, edited versions of the ''Liber Censuum'', reconstructed as their editors though the original codex of Cencius would have appeared, have been produced by Fabre and [[Louis Duchesne]] (1910).&lt;ref name="robinson262"&gt;Robinson, 1990, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Fabre's identification of other portions of the ''Liber Censuum'', for example the alleged acquiescence of King [[Harthacanute]] to ecclesiastical taxation, are more controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Peterspence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MoMA PS1''' is one of the largest art institutions in the [[United States]] dedicated solely to [[contemporary art]]. It is located in the [[Long Island City]] neighborhood in the borough of [[Queens]], [[New York City]]. In addition to its exhibitions, the institution also organizes the Sunday Sessions performance series, the Warm Up summer music series, and the Young Architects Program with the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. MoMA PS1 has been affiliated with the Museum of Modern Art since January 2000 and, {{as of|2013|lc=yes}}, attracts about 200,000 visitors a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/facelift-struggling-queens-museum-article-1.1502072|title=Facelift for Queens Museum|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding===
What would become MoMA PS1 was founded in 1971 by [[Alanna Heiss]] as the Institute for Art and Urban Resources Inc.,&lt;ref name="MoMA PS1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Profile |url=http://momaps1.org/about/ |website=MoMA PS1 |quote="MoMA PS1 was founded in 1971 by Alanna Heiss as the Institute for Art and Urban Resources Inc."|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an organization with the mission of turning abandoned, underutilized buildings in New York City into artist studios and exhibition spaces.

Recognizing that New York was a worldwide magnet for contemporary artists, and believing that traditional museums were not providing adequate exhibition opportunities for site-specific art, in 1971 Heiss established a formal, alternative arts organization with architecture/theater critic [[Brendan Gill]] called The Institute for Art and Urban Resources, and began renovating abandoned buildings in New York City.

In 1976, Heiss opened the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in a deserted Romanesque Revival public school building, exponentially increased the organization's exhibition and studio capacity. This building, dating from 1892, served as the first school in Long Island City until 1963, when the First Ward school it housed was closed due to low attendance and the building was turned into a warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5-UCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24 | title=Long Island City | page=24 | magazine=[[New York Magazine]] | publisher=[[Google Books]] | date=11 August 1980 | accessdate=1 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1997, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center reopened to the public after a three-year, $8.5 million renovation project designed by Los Angeles-based architecture firm Frederick Fisher &amp; Partners.&lt;ref name="Louie"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Louie |first1=Elaine |title=CURRENTS; THE NEW P.S. 1: CONTEMPORARY ART, BUT THE BUILDING'S THE STAR |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/02/garden/currents-the-new-ps-1-contemporary-art-but-the-building-s-the-star.html |accessdate=17 July 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=October 2, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carol Vogel 1999"&gt;Carol Vogel (February 2, 1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/02/arts/a-museum-merger-the-modern-meets-the-ultramodern.html A Museum Merger: The Modern Meets The Ultramodern] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[[Roberta Smith]] (October 31, 1997), [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/31/arts/art-review-more-spacious-and-gracious-yet-still-funky-at-heart.html Art Review: More Spacious and Gracious, Yet Still Funky at Heart] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The building's facilities were increased from 84,000 to 125,000 square feet in order to include a large outdoor gallery, a dramatic entryway, and a two-story project space.

In February 1999, P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center and the Museum of Modern Art announced their institutional merger, which was stated to take 10 years and designed to preserve P.S. 1 as a center of independent experimentation and exploration.

In 2008, following the completion of a 10-year merger process with MoMA, Alana Heiss retired as director of P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center after 36 years.&lt;ref name="Museum of Modern Art {{!}} MoMA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/research-and-learning/research-resources/archives/ps1_chronology|title=Museum of Modern Art {{!}} MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art|language=en|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Klaus Biesenbach]] was named Director of the renamed MoMA PS1. Biesenbach first joined at PS1 as a curator in 1997, and subsequently held the positions of Curator in MoMA's Department of Film and Media and Chief Curator of MoMA's Department of Media and Performance Art.&lt;ref name="Museum of Modern Art {{!}} MoMA"/&gt; Biesenbach left the museum for the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Los Angeles in July 2018.&lt;ref name="artn"&gt;{{cite news |title=MoMA PS1’s Klaus Biesenbach, a Champion of the Avant-Garde and Celebrities Alike, Will Now Lead MOCA LA |url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/klaus-biesenbach-director-la-moca-1326776 |accessdate=11 September 2018 |work=artnet news |date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affiliation with the Museum of Modern Art===
MoMA PS1 and the [[Museum of Modern Art]] formalized their affiliation in January 2000.&lt;ref name="MoMA PS1"/&gt;
New York City, which owns the MoMA PS1 building, endorsed the merger.&lt;ref name="Carol Vogel 1999"/&gt; The principal objective of MoMA's partnership with MoMA PS1 is to promote the enjoyment, appreciation, study, and understanding of contemporary art to a wide and growing audience. Collaborative programs of exhibitions, educational activities, and special projects allow both institutions to draw on their respective strengths and resources and to continue shaping a cultural discourse. The two institutions also integrated their development, education, marketing, financial planning and membership departments.&lt;ref name="Carol Vogel 1999"/&gt; To mark the 10th anniversary of the merger between the former P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center and MoMA, the museum changed its name to MoMA PS1 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (April 29, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/30/arts/design/30vogel.html Tweaking a Name in Long Island City] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

From its inception, MoMA PS1 has championed the innovative and the experimental. The premiere exhibition, ''Rooms'', held in June 1976, featured the works of 78 artists, many of whom created site-specific installations in the former classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;''Rooms P.S. 1, June 9–26'' (New York: The Institute for Art and Urban Resources Inc., 1977), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Rooms'', the sculptor [[Alan Saret]] cut a tiny hole in one wall, creating an almost heavenly aureole of light at one end of the third-floor hallway.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The museum has featured the works of the artists [[Janet Cardiff]], [[David Hammons]], [[Kimsooja]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=im Sooja: A Needle Woman  July 1–September 16, 2001 |url=http://momaps1.org/exhibitions/view/24 |website=MoMA PS1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilma af Klint]], [[Donald Lipski]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]], [[Alan Saret]], [[Katharina Sieverding]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Tracy 168|Michael Tracy]], [[Franz West]], [[Maria Lassnig]], [[Judy Rifka]], and [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]].

'''Warm Up''' is MoMA PS1's music series summer event. The series is housed within the architectural installation created by the winner of the annual Young Architects Program. Together, the music, architecture and exhibition program provide a unique multi-sensory experience for music fans, artists, and families alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Corsini|first1=Rachel|title=MoMA PS1 Warms Up Summer in a Cool Way  Read more: Brooklyn Downtown Star – MoMA PS1 warms up summer in a cool way|url=http://brooklyndowntownstar.com/pages/full_story/push?article-MoMA+PS1+warms+up+summer+in+a+cool+way%20&amp;id=8707130|accessdate=23 November 2014|agency=Brooklyn Downtown Star|date=July 9, 2010|quote=PS1's Warm Up parties aren't just parties, however; they are an "experimental exhibition at the museum," said Cindy Hinant, a volunteer coordinator. Not that it isn't a blast, with beer available to those of legal drinking age. You won't find Budweiser here, though. They serve Original Sin Hard Cider and Magic Hat #9, a welcome change from the norm that speaks to the theme of serving the indie community.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warm Up was conceived in 1997 as a summer-long dance party to bring new audiences to MoMA PS1 and Long Island City, Queens. The series runs every Saturday from July through early September and draws thousands of local and international visitors each day.

Highlights from the series include a notable group of international DJs and live music ensembles: DJ Harvey, [[Groove Collective]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[Mad Professor]], [[Richie Hawtin]], [[François K]], [[Fischerspooner]], [[Kid Koala]], [[Arto Lindsay]], [[Scissor Sisters]], [[Luke Vibert]], [[Solange Knowles|Solange]], [[Jamie XX]], [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]], [[Arca (musician)|Arca]], [[Black Dice]], [[Four Tet]], [[DJ Premier]], [[Richie Hawtin|Ritchie Hawtin]], [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]], Venus X, Mattis With, Naomi Zeichner, Dean Bein, Matt Werth, and many more.

==Management==

Under chairwoman [[Agnes Gund]], the MoMA PS1's board of directors includes the artists [[Cindy Sherman]] and [[Mickalene Thomas]], art historian [[Diana Widmaier Picasso|Diana Widmaier-Picasso]], fashion designer Adam Kimmel, and art collectors [[Adrian Cheng]], [[Peter Norton]], and [[Julia Stoschek]].&lt;ref&gt;Leon Neyfakh (February 24, 2010), [http://observer.com/2010/02/new-blood-for-ps1s-board-of-directors/ New Blood for P.S.1′s Board of Directors] ''[[New York Observer]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibitions at MoMA PS1 are made possible by the Annual Exhibition Fund, which draws donations from the trustees. As owner of the MoMA PS1 building, New York City paid 85 percent of its renovation costs in 1997, with the rest coming from private donors. The city also contributes one-third to one-half of MoMA PS1's total annual operating budget of $1.5 million to $2 million.&lt;ref name="Carol Vogel 1999" /&gt;

'''Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen''' ({{IPA-nl|myˈzeːjɵm ˈbɔimɑns fɑn ˈbøːnɪŋə(n)}})&lt;ref&gt;In isolation, ''van'' is pronounced {{IPA-nl|vɑn|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[art museum]] in [[Rotterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]]. It is located at the [[Museumpark]] in the district [[Rotterdam Centrum]], close to the [[Kunsthal]] and the [[Natural History Museum Rotterdam|Natural History Museum]].

The museum opened in 1849. It houses the collections of [[Frans Jacob Otto Boijmans]] (1767–1847) and [[Daniël George van Beuningen]] (1877–1955). In the collection, ranging from [[Medieval art|medieval]] to [[contemporary art]], are works of [[Rembrandt]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Salvador Dalí]].

In 2013, the museum had 292,711 visitors and was the [[List of most visited museums in the Netherlands|14th most visited museum]] in the Netherlands.

==History==
The museum was established in 1849&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; as ''Museum Boymans'' with the collection of Frans Jacob Otto Boijmans (1767–1847). The painter and art dealer, [[Arie Johannes Lamme]], was named the museum's first Director. Much of the museum's original collection was destroyed in a fire in 1864.

The collection of businessman [[Daniël George van Beuningen]] (1877–1955) was added in 1958, at which point the museum acquired the name ''Museum Boymans-van Beuningen''. The spelling was changed to ''Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen'' in 1996.

The museum has a diverse collection ranging from [[Medieval art|medieval]] to [[contemporary art]], with somewhat of a focus on [[Dutch art]]. Much of the collection came to the museum through the two private collections mentioned above, but many others have contributed throughout the years.

Among the best-known artists that are exhibited in the permanent exhibition of the museum are [[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[René Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Willem de Kooning]], and [[Yayoi Kusama]].

The collection also includes one of the richest assembly of works on paper (etchings, drawings, lithographs, etc.) in the world from the Middle Ages to the present times.

'''MusicBrainz''' is a project that aims to create an [[open data]] music database that is similar to the [[freedb]] project. MusicBrainz was founded in response to the restrictions placed on the [[CDDB|Compact Disc Database]] (CDDB), a database for software applications to look up audio CD ([[compact disc]]) information on the Internet. MusicBrainz has expanded its goals to reach beyond a compact disc [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] (this is information about the performers, artists, songwriters, etc.) storehouse to become a structured open online database for music.&lt;ref&gt;Highfield, Ashley. "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/speeches/stories/highfield_iea.shtml Keynote speech given at IEA Future Of Broadcasting Conference]", [[BBC]] [[News release|Press Office]], 2007-06-27. Retrieved on 2008-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Swartz | first1 = A. | authorlink = Aaron Swartz| doi = 10.1109/5254.988466 | title = MusicBrainz: A semantic Web service | journal = IEEE Intelligent Systems | volume = 17 | pages = 76–77 | year = 2002 | url = http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/771/papers/ieeeIntelligentSystems/webservices/musicBrainz.pdf| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MusicBrainz captures information about artists, their recorded works, and the relationships between them. Recorded works entries capture at a minimum the album title, track titles, and the length of each track. These entries are maintained by volunteer editors who follow community written [[MusicBrainz:Style Guideline|style guidelines]]. Recorded works can also store information about the release date and country, the CD ID, [[cover art]], [[acoustic fingerprint]], free-form annotation text and other metadata. {{As of|2018|09|21}}, MusicBrainz contained information about roughly 1.4 million artists, 2 million releases, and 19 million recordings.&lt;ref name=statistics&gt;{{cite web | title = Database Statistics | publisher = MusicBrainz | url = https://musicbrainz.org/statistics | accessdate = 2018-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; End-users can use software that communicates with MusicBrainz to add [[ID3 tag|metadata tag]]s to their digital media files, such as [[FLAC]], [[MP3]], [[Ogg Vorbis]] or [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]].

== Cover Art Archive ==
MusicBrainz allows contributors to upload cover art images of releases to the database; these images are hosted by '''Cover Art Archive''' (CAA), a joint project between [[Internet Archive]] and MusicBrainz started in 2012. Internet Archive provides the bandwidth, storage and legal protection for hosting the images, while MusicBrainz stores metadata and provides public access through the web and via an [[Application programming interface|API]] for third parties to use. As with other contributions, the MusicBrainz community is in charge of maintaining and reviewing the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Fabian Scherschel |title=MusicBrainz and Internet Archive create cover art database |date={{date|2012-10-10}} |publisher=The H |url=http://h-online.com/-1727322 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207234912/http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/MusicBrainz-and-Internet-Archive-create-cover-art-database-1727322.html|archivedate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cover art is also provided for items on sale at [[Amazon.com]] and some other online resources, but CAA is now preferred because it gives the community more control and flexibility for managing the images.

== Fingerprinting ==
Besides collecting metadata about music, MusicBrainz also allows looking up recordings by their [[acoustic fingerprint]]. A separate application, such as [[MusicBrainz Picard]], must be used for this.

=== Proprietary services ===
In 2000, MusicBrainz started using [[Relatable]]'s patented TRM (a [[recursive acronym]] for TRM Recognizes Music) for acoustic fingerprint matching. This feature attracted many users and allowed the database to grow quickly. However, by 2005 TRM was showing scalability issues as the number of tracks in the database had reached into the millions. This issue was resolved in May 2006 when MusicBrainz partnered with MusicIP (now [[AmpliFIND]]), replacing TRM with MusicDNS.&lt;ref name="musicdns_announcement"&gt;{{cite press release | title=New fingerprinting technology available now! | date=2006-03-12|publisher=MusicBrainz community blog | url=http://blog.musicbrainz.org/archives/2006/03/new_fingerprint.html | accessdate=2006-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; TRMs were phased out and replaced by MusicDNS in November 2008.

In October 2009 MusicIP was acquired by [[AmpliFIND]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amplifindmusicservices.com/news/press/amplified-music-aims-to-liberate-your-music.php AmpliFIND Music Services: News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055804/http://www.amplifindmusicservices.com/news/press/amplified-music-aims-to-liberate-your-music.php |date=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some time after the acquisition, the MusicDNS service began having intermittent problems.

=== AcoustID and Chromaprint ===
Since the future of the free identification service was uncertain, a replacement for it was sought. The Chromaprint acoustic fingerprinting algorithm, the basis for [[AcoustID]] identification service, was started in February 2010 by a long-time MusicBrainz contributor Lukáš Lalinský.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxygene.sk/2010/07/introducing-chromaprint/ |title=Introducing Chromaprint – Lukáš Lalinský |publisher=Oxygene.sk |date=2010-07-24 |accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; While AcoustID and Chromaprint are not officially MusicBrainz projects, they are closely tied with each other and both are open source. Chromaprint works by analyzing the first two minutes of a track, detecting the strength in each of 12 [[pitch class]]es, storing these 8 times per second. Additional post-processing is then applied to compress this fingerprint while retaining patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://oxygene.sk/2011/01/how-does-chromaprint-work/ |title=How does Chromaprint work? – Lukáš Lalinský |journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=995–1004 |doi=10.1109/TIFS.2009.2034452 |date=2011-01-18 |accessdate=2018-04-10|last1=Jang |first1=Dalwon |last2=Yoo |first2=Chang D |last3=Lee |first3=Sunil |last4=Kim |first4=Sungwoong |last5=Kalker |first5=Ton }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AcoustID search server then searches from the database of fingerprints by similarity and returns the AcoustID identifier along with MusicBrainz recording identifiers if known.

== History ==
mySupermarket.co.uk launched as a UK-based supermarket shopping and price comparison site in October 2006, using data on four of the main supermarkets [[Sainsbury's]], [[Tesco]], [[Asda]] and [[Ocado]].&lt;ref name=guardian06&gt;Jill Papworth (21 October 2006) [https://www.theguardian.com/money/2006/oct/21/consumernews.moneysupplement/print "Cheaper shopping? Now it's in the bag"], ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 25 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, the company launched a mySupermarket.com for the United States market.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/10/grocery-comparison-site-mysupermarket-launches-u-s-megastore-for-finding-best-prices-across-amazon-walmart-target-more/Grocery Comparison Site mySupermarket Launches U.S. Megastore]. TechCrunch.com (10 June 2013).

In November 2014 "Insights" was launched, a real-time dashboard to track product sales and market share across UK supermarkets. The tool allowed marketers to track performance and make changes daily to their campaigns rather than waiting for post-season analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Suppliers and retailers sign up for mySupermarket insight tool|url = http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/channels/online/suppliers-and-retailers-sign-up-for-mysupermarket-insight-tool/510841.article|publisher = TheGrocer.co.uk|accessdate = 10 November 2015 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, the company launched mySupermarket SHOPS, an online shop offering wares from more than 100 local and independent UK retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MySupermarket unveils new online marketplace featuring independent grocers|url = http://www.talkingretail.com/category-news/supermarket/mysupermarket-unveils-new-online-marketplace-featuring-independent-grocers/|website = Talking Retail|accessdate = 27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
mySupermarket Limited is a private company, owned by a group of investors and mySupermarket employees. In May 2007, mySupermarket.co.uk received a £3&amp;nbsp;million investment from venture capitalist firms, [[Greylock Partners]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greylock.com/news/newsPortfolio_release.cfm?Id=678 Greylock Partners – News]. Greylock.com. Retrieved 1 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pitango]].  These funds were earmarked for structured marketing of the site to increase its regular users.&lt;ref&gt;Gaelle Walker, New funds to drive growth of price comparison website, The Grocer, 19 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, mySupermarket.co.uk received an investment of $10&amp;nbsp;million from British advertising and public relations company [[WPP plc|WPP]] and existing investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = WPP Makes Big Leap into E-Commerce, Leads On $10 Million mySupermarket Investment|url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/19/wpp-makes-big-leap-into-e-commerce-leads-on-10-million-mysupermarket-investment/|website = TechCrunch|accessdate = 10 November 2015|first = Ingrid|last = Lunden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==

The '''NASA Human Exploration Rover Challenge''', prior to 2014 referred to as the '''Great Moonbuggy Race''', is an annual competition for high school and college students to design, build, and race human-powered, collapsible vehicles over simulated lunar/Martian terrain.  [[NASA]] sponsors the competition, first held in 1994, and, since 1996, the [[U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center]] hosts.&lt;ref name="FactSheet"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/pdf/633342main_The_19th_Annual_NASA_Great_Moonbuggy_Race.pdf | title=Official NASA Great Moonbuggy Race Fact Sheet | publisher=NASA | accessdate=April 5, 2013 | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AboutRovers"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/roverchallenge/competition/index.html | title=About NASA Human Exploration Rover Challenge | accessdate=April 11, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411220023/http://www.nasa.gov/roverchallenge/competition/index.html | archivedate=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students created vehicles dubbed "moonbuggies" to face challenges similar to those engineers at NASA's [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] addressed in preparation for [[Apollo 15]]. On that mission, on July 31, 1971, the first [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] extended the range of astronauts on the moon to allow for further exploration than was otherwise possible.  Two other rovers were sent to the moon on subsequent missions.&lt;ref name="FactSheet"/&gt;

With the 2014 changes in the contest, the motivation changed to mimicking design challenges faced by engineers designing rovers for future exploration missions to a variety of celestial bodies.&lt;ref name="AboutRovers"/&gt;

[[File:1994 Moonbuggy Race Puerto Rico over boulders.jpg|thumb|The first two events were held at the original track used for testing lunar rover candidates.  Here, the team from Puerto Rico navigates boulders.]]
The first race, in 1994, was held on July 16, the 25th anniversary of the [[Apollo 11]] launch.  It featured six college teams who competed on the same course as had been used to test the lunar rovers previously.  The [[University of New Hampshire]] finished first, in 18 minutes 55 seconds for the {{convert|1.4|mi|adj=on}} course with twelve obstacles. The prize was a trip for six team members to see a [[Space Shuttle]] launch. Other teams from the [[University of Puerto Rico at Humacao]], [[Texas A &amp; M University]], the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]], [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] and [[Indiana University]]/[[Purdue University at Indianapolis]] participated.&lt;ref name="MS940720"&gt;{{cite news | title=Moon Buggy Race was Wheeling Task for Students | work=Marshall Star | date=July 20, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent races have been held in April.  In 1996, the competition was moved to a {{convert|.75|mi|adj=on}} course at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center; high school teams also began competing.

== Rules ==
The rules change year by year, but are largely summarized thus:&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://moonbuggy.msfc.nasa.gov/rules.html | title=Moonbuggy Rules and Penalties | publisher=NASA | accessdate=April 6, 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215233414/http://moonbuggy.msfc.nasa.gov/rules.html | archivedate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2014 Rules"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/roverchallenge/rules/index.html#.U0hkXHVdWD0 | title=Rover Challenge Rules | publisher=NASA | accessdate=April 11, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411215701/http://www.nasa.gov/roverchallenge/rules/index.html | archivedate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A team of at most six people designs, builds, and races the same vehicle.&lt;ref name="2014 Rules"/&gt;
* Two of the six must ride and propel the vehicle through the course.&lt;ref name="Time10"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1981287,00.html | title=NASA's Great Moonbuggy Race | publisher=Time | work=Time.com | year=2010 | accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Riders must be one male and one female.&lt;ref name="Time10"/&gt;
* The moonbuggy (pre-2014) must fit into a {{convert|4|ft|adj=on}} cube and be no more than 4&amp;nbsp;ft wide.&lt;ref name="Greenemeier"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=nasa-moon-buggy-race-2009 | title=Slide Show: Students Gear Up for NASA's Annual Moon Buggy Race | publisher=Scientific American | date=April 3, 2009 | accessdate=2013-04-07 | author=Greenemeier, Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 2014, the rover constraint was a {{convert|5|ft|adj=on}} cube.
* The vehicle needs to carry a simulated [[high-gain antenna]], camera, and other instrumentation which must consume at least {{convert|1|ft3|l}}.&lt;ref name="2014 Rules"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenemeier"/&gt;
* Various other dimensional and safety criteria apply.
* Time penalties are assessed for touching the ground, avoiding obstacles, and other rule violations.&lt;ref name="2014 Rules"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time10"/&gt;
*Since 2016, the teams have to design and fabricate their own non-pneumatic tyres/wheels. Purchasing a commercially available product will lead to disqualification.

== Course ==
[[File:2012 Great Moonbuggy Race Course Map.png|thumb|Since 1996, the course winds through the rocket park at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.  This map shows the 2012 course.]]
The course is designed to test rovers for stability over varying simulated lunar or extraterrestrial terrain—bumpy, sloped, and rocky—including some tight turns.&lt;ref name="Greenemeier"/&gt; The first course was the actual track used by Mobility Test Articles, auditioning versions of Lunar Roving Vehicles that were used on the moon. For the third race the course was moved a few miles, to the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center. There, the track has taken varying paths through the rocket park and around the permanent lunar crater feature at the museum. Each year, the obstacles change slightly.&lt;ref name="FactSheet"/&gt;

[[File:2013 Great Moonbuggy Race obstacle preparation.jpg|thumb|An obstacle for the 2013 contest awaits final preparations.  Tires form small craters and gravel substitutes for moon surface material.]]
The obstacles are constructed of discarded tires, plywood, some 20 tons of gravel and five tons of sand, all to simulate lunar craters, basins, and [[rille]]s.&lt;ref name="Greenemeier"/&gt; The contest is challenging: in 2009, 29 of 68 teams competing did not complete the race.&lt;ref name="CNet09"/&gt; Sometimes the placement of the obstacle is an issue, with some teams hitting obstacles too fast after a downhill stint.&lt;ref name="HT10"/&gt;

Before students tackle the race course, their vehicles must pass inspection. At the team's start time, the two riding students must carry the buggy, collapsed to fit in a {{convert|5|ft|adj=on}} cube (pre-2014 a {{convert|4|ft|adj=on}} cube), for {{convert|20|ft|m}}, then expand the rover and ride it across the obstacles and along the track, avoiding cones marking the edges of the course, bales of hay, and other obstructions, while successfully navigating the modest hills of the terrain and obstacles. After the race, another inspection assesses the condition of the vehicle, with time penalties if parts are missing.&lt;ref name="rules"/&gt;

== Contestants ==
Contestants are high school and university students largely from the United States, including Puerto Rico. Teams have also come from Canada, Mexico, India, Germany, and Romania to participate.&lt;ref name="Greenemeier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HT09"/&gt;

== Awards ==
Numerous awards are offered each year, some with significant prizes.  First place college winners have received trips to Shuttle launches and cash prizes, while others have received weekends at Space Camp. In 2009, there were 11 categories for special recognition with 19 recipients thereof.  Consistent from the beginning have been awards for fastest time and for best design.  Other awards acknowledge simplicity of design, safety, tenacity, team spirit, improvement over previous years' entries, and exceptional new entries.&lt;ref name="NASA09"/&gt;

== Winners ==
This list gives winners for time(ᵗ) and design(ᵈ) awards which have been consistently offered since the start.  Awards were often also given for other categories but they are not included here in the interest of readability.

A '''Navy List''' or '''Naval Register''' is an official list of [[navy|naval]] officers, their ranks and seniority, the ships which they command or to which they are appointed, etc., that is published by the government or naval authorities of a country.

==Background==
The Navy List fulfills an important function in [[international law]] in that warships are required by article 29 of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] to be commanded by a [[commissioned officer]] whose name appears in the appropriate service list.{{why|date=June 2016}}

Past copies of the Navy List are also important sources of information for historians and genealogists.

The Navy List for the Royal Navy is no longer published in hard-copy.

The [[Royal Navy]] (United Kingdom) publishes annual lists of active and reserve officers, and biennial lists of retired officers. The equivalent in the [[United States Navy]] is the Naval Register, which is updated online on a continuous basis.  When a ship is removed from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] in the United States, or from a Naval List of any other country, the ship is said to be "[[:wikt:stricken|stricken]]".&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OydzBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37 Small United States and United Nations Warships in the Korean War]'', p. 37 (McFarland, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resources ==
Good sources of historical data on the [[Royal Navy]] ''Navy Lists'' are
*The Naval Historical Branch, Portsmouth Naval Base.
*The Central Library Portsmouth, Guildhall Square.
*[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]], Kew, that has an almost complete set including unpublished editions produced during the Second World War for internal use by the Admiralty.
*The Caird Library of the [[National Maritime Museum]] has in its collection bound monthly lists published by the Admiralty, and the concurrently published Steel's lists

The current editor of the Navy List is Cliona Willis

[[File:UNITED NATIONS - PREAMBLE TO THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS - NARA - 515901.jpg|right|thumb|[[Preamble to the United Nations Charter|Preamble]] to the {{no wrap|Charter of the United Nations}}]]
[[File:Constitution of India.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Preamble to the [[Constitution of India]]. It is the longest written constitution of any sovereign country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=India's Constitution. S. Chand &amp; Co.|last=|first=|publisher=S. Chand &amp; Co.|year=1997|isbn=81-219-0403-X|location=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''preamble''' is an introductory and expressionary statement in a document that explains the document's purpose and underlying philosophy.  When applied to the opening paragraphs of a statute, it may recite historical facts pertinent to the subject of the statute.  It is distinct from the [[long title]] or [[enacting formula]] of a law. 

In [[parliamentary procedure]] using [[Robert's Rules of Order]], a preamble consists of "Whereas" clauses that are placed before the resolving clauses in a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] (formal written [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 107|edition = 11th|display-authors = etal|ref = harv|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O8zExFMa0SkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, preambles are not required to be placed in resolutions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Robert's Rules of Order, including such background information may not be helpful in passing the resolution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Legal effect==
While preambles may be regarded as unimportant introductory matter, their words may have effects that may not have been foreseen by their drafters.

In [[France]], the preamble to the [[constitution of the Fifth Republic]] of 1958 was considered ancillary and therefore non-binding until a major jurisprudential reversal by the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] in a decision of 16 July 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Decision no. 71-44 DC, known as "Liberté d'association": http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/english/case-law/decision/decision-no-71-44-dc-of-16-july-1971.135366.html&lt;/ref&gt; This decision, which began with the words "Having regard to the constitution and its preamble," affected a considerable change of French constitutional law, as the preamble and the texts it referred to, the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man]] of 1789 and the preamble to the [[French Fourth Republic|constitution of the Fourth Republic]], took their place alongside the constitution proper as texts understood as being invested with constitutional value.

In [[Canada]], the preamble to the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] was cited by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the [[Provincial Judges Reference]], to increase guarantees to [[judicial independence]]. In [[India]], the Supreme Court frequently rules unconstitutional amendments which violate the [[Basic Structure]] of the Constitution, especially its Preamble. The Bosnian [[Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Constitutional Court]], particularly citing the case law of the Supreme Court of Canada, also declared that the provisions of the preamble of the Bosnian [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Constitution]] are invested with a normative force thereby serving as a sound standard of judicial review for the Constitutional Court.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, U-5/98 (Partial Decision Part 3), para. 26, [[Sarajevo]], 1 July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to concern over its potential effects, the draft preamble of the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]], in 2002, caused much controversy because of the possible inclusion of a [[Constitutional references to God|reference to the Christian heritage of Europe]].  Likewise, in [[Australia]] in 1999, a [[Australian referendum, 1999 (Preamble)|referendum]] on whether to adopt a new preamble was accompanied by a promise that the preamble, if adopted, could not be enforceable by the courts, as some were concerned with how the preamble could be interpreted and applied.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, Jeffrey.  "The Preamble, Judicial Independence and Judicial Integrity."  ''FORUM Constitutionnel'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''''S v Swanepoel''''' (2006), Swanepoel appeared with three other accused on charges of [[murder]], [[Kidnapping|abduction]], [[robbery]] with [[Aggravation (law)|aggravating circumstances]], [[housebreaking]] and theft, and various charges relating to the [[Weapon possession|unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition]]. At his appearance in the [[magistrate]]'s court, Swanepoel indicated that the date decided for the [[High Courts of South Africa|high-court]] [[trial]] did not suit him. He then launched the present application, and asked for an order postponing the trial for at least seven months to enable him to earn money to pay for the services of an advocate of his own choice.

The court held that to expect a court to wait for seven months to begin with the trial so that the accused could find work in order to earn an [[income]] to pay for the fees of a legal representative was beyond the limits of acceptability, as the criminal process could not be made dependent on the accused's earning ability.

Therefore the application was dismissed.

'''Teylers Tweede Genootschap''' (English: '''Teylers Second Society'''), also known as the ''Wetenschappelijk Genootschap'' (Scientific Society) is one of the two societies founded within the [[Teylers Stichting]] with the purpose to promote and award prizes for research. They were the result of the testament of the Dutch 18th-century merchant [[Pieter Teyler van der Hulst]]. The Second Society is focused on art and science, while the First Society is focused on theology.

==History==
Both societies were founded in 1778, and the specific areas of interest to the Second society are Physics, Biology, Literature, History, the study of Art, and Numismatics. The society has six members, and the first members appointed in 1778 by Teyler himself were:
* [[Gerrit Willem van Oosten de Bruijn]]
* [[Cornelis Elout]]
* [[Jan Bosch (1778 - 1780)|Jan Bosch]]
* [[Johannes Enschedé (1708-1780)|Johannes Enschedé]]
* [[Jean le Clé]]
* [[Bernardus Vriends]]

The first task of the new society was to commission a prize medal and set up a prize contest. Like the first society, they ordered a medal from [[Johann Georg Holtzhey]] and the allegory on the front of the medal shows an all-eeing eye in a halo, with a symbolic representation of the five arts (from left to right: history (folio), poetry (lyre), physics (globe and compass), drawing (brush and palette) and numismatics (coin and medal tableau). The text around the edge means ''All sciences that relate to human civilization, have a certain common bond''. The reverse side of the medal leaves room for the date and the winner's name.

The idea was to discuss theory and present a question each year for the prize medal to be awarded. During the first ten years, only four prize medals were awarded, though five papers were published (in 1802 Jan Nieuwenhuis did not win a medal, but his paper appeared in the "Verhandelingen"). Sometimes just a gold medal was awarded, and sometimes both gold and silever medals were awarded, but often there were no contestants at all. The first gold medal winner was [[Martinus van Marum]], who won the first prize in 1778 with his paper "Phlogisteerde en niet-phlogisteerde lucht" challenging [[phlogiston theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GnNMAAAAYAAJ Van Marum's paper in the first edition of the ''Verhandelingen''] in [[Google books]]&lt;/ref&gt; He replaced Elout the next year and became conservator of the physics cabinet.

Bosch was replaced by [[Jean Gijsbert Decker]] in 1780, and Enschedé was replaced by [[Willem Anne Lestevenon]] in the same year.

The society still promotes research with prize medals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/index.php?item=18 Current society members and contests] on the [[Teylers Museum]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Australian Bird Guide'''''&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/959551110|title=The Australian bird guide|last=Menkhorst|first=Peter||authorlink=Peter Menkhorst|publisher=|others=Rogers, Danny I., Clarke, Rohan, Davies, J. N. (Jeff N.), Marsack, Peter, Franklin, Kim,|year=|isbn=978-0-643-09754-4|location=Clayton, Vic|pages=|oclc=959551110}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Guide) was published by [[CSIRO Publishing]] in 2017 and took almost 8 years to produce. The lead author is [[Peter Menkhorst]] along with Danny Rogers and Rohan Clarke. Original illustrations are by Jeff Davis, Peter Marsack and Kim Franklin.

The guide covers a total of 936 species that comprise 747 breeding residents or regular migrants, 29 introduced species and 160 vagrants. These birds are grouped as marine and costal birds, freshwater birds and terrestrial birds and then taxonomically.

Weighing in at almost 1.5 kilograms and with dimensions of 24.6&amp;nbsp;cm by 17.2&amp;nbsp;cm and 3.4&amp;nbsp;cm thick with 576 pages the size and weight of this book makes it more practical as a reference book than a field guide. However, it is structured as a field guide and the authors call it a field guide in the text (see Acknowledgements page 2 and page 3 as examples).

== Description ==
The Guide starts with a two-page visual reference guide giving the page where each bird can be found and is then followed by an alphabetical quick reference guide. Both are useful in assisting in locating the required page for bird identification. In addition there is an extensive index at the back of the book.

This is then followed by details on how the guide was constructed, their sources of information and specifically what area and species were covered. This is followed by sections on identifying birds and on birding in Australia.&amp;nbsp;

Before the detailed description of species commences there is a guide for birders to the evolution and classification of birds. While this may not be expected in such a work this section “it will get birders thinking”.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.birdguides.com/reviews/the-australian-bird-guide/|title=The Australian Bird Guide - BirdGuides|last=Pearson|first=Alan|date=|website=www.birdguides.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This section was written by Dr Leo Joseph of the [[Australian National Wildlife Collection]], [[CSIRO]] (Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation).

The Guide provides detailed maps indicating where a species or sub-species are likely to occur and shading to help identify where the birds are most likely to occur. Several of the reviewers highlighted this feature as a major positive of the guide&lt;ref name="Watson"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chriswatson.com.au/blog/the-australian-bird-guide|title=The Australian Bird Guide|last=Watson|first=Chris|date=|work=|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''10,000 Bird'' review considered the 2 field guides with this feature the best available.&lt;ref name="Pearson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="birds"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.10000birds.com/the-australian-bird-guide-a-review.htm|title=10,000 Birds   {{!}}  The Australian Bird Guide: A Review|last=Schulman|first=Donna Lynn|date=|website=www.10000birds.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__FORCETOC__

== Reviews ==
The Foreword to ''The Australian Bird Guide'' was written by Paul Sullivan, Chief Executive of [[BirdLife Australia|Birdlife Australia]], Australia’s peak ornithological body. This foreword states that the authors and artists of this book are considered leaders in their field and that the details of species and sub-species is a first for Australian birds. It also describes how the maps are derived from data collected by thousands of people over many decades to give some of the best distribution  maps seen in Australian Guides.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;

Booktopia sees the ''Australian Bird Guide'' as "the most comprehensive field guide to Australian birds ever seen", and is effusive about its colour plates and comprehensive species accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.booktopia.com.au/the-australian-bird-guide-peter-menkhorst/prod9780643097544.html|title=Booktopia review of The Australian Bird Guide|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the guide by Chris Watson, Bafta-winning wildlife sound recordist&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/06/wildlife.birdsong|title=Wildlife sound recordist Chris Watson chooses his top 10 bird songs|last=Wyse|first=Pascal|last2=Aldred|first2=Jessica|date=2008-06-07|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; was predominantly positive and includes an interview with Rohan Clark, one of the authors, which helps to understand why this new guide was developed when Australia has a significant number of existing guides. However, it does point out that some of the plates have colour problems and the reviewer is not a fan of including written bird calls. Watson finished the review with “In all truth, this could be the most pointless review I’ve ever written. Everyone is going to buy this book and everyone is going to love it. Enjoy!”&lt;ref name="Watson"/&gt;

Watson asked Clark in the interview if a smartphone app was being considered and he replied that it was a decision of CSIRO Publishing.

Alan Pearson from the ''British Bird Guides'' also reviewed the book and while he did mention the size of the book, overall he was also very enthusiastic about the guide. While the Chris Watson review was critical of the written bird sounds this review thought they had been done very well. Pearson was also critical that the birds full length (size range) was not provided rather it provides wing size, bill length and weight.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;

Donna Lynn Schulman reviewed this Guide for ''10,000 Birds'' and at the same time compared this guide to the most popular existing Australian bird guides. The author thought that the  Australian Bird Guide edged out ''The Field Guide to the Birds of Australia, 9th edition'' by Graham Pizzey and Frank Knight, edited by Sarah Pizzey (2012).&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="Pizzy"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/505187991|title=The field guide to the birds of Australia|last=Pizzey|first=Graham,|publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|others=Knight, Frank, Pizzey, Sarah|year=2012|isbn=9780732291938|edition= Ninth |location=Sydney, NSW ; New York, NY|pages=|oclc=505187991}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;The review thought the index of the Guide was not as good as the Pizzey and Knight guide. The reviewer preferred the Guide because of the “currency of information, denseness of text, and quality and quantity of illustrations. They also state that because of the difference in emphasis of the different guides there are many reasons to own more than one of the guides.&lt;ref name=birds/&gt; This review looked at the following guides in its review:

==Collections overview==

The collections are organized into four interlinked areas.

===Bingham Technology Collection===
The Bingham Technology Collection has grown from the original gift of 2,000 vintage cameras donated by Dr. Robert Bingham in 1973 to a current count of 10,000 cameras, viewing devices, and photographic apparatus. In 1975, ''[[Popular Photography]]'' declared that UCR's Bingham Camera Collection was second only to the [[George Eastman Museum|George Eastman House]] Collection in Rochester, New York, and the collection of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

The collection holds four synoptic subsets of camera technology: The Kibbey [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss-Ikon]] Collection; Curtis [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] Collection; Wodinsky [[Exacta|Ihagee-Exacta]] Collection and the Teague [[Kodak Brownie]] Collection. Other significant artifacts include a Lewis daguerrean camera, a [[Simon Wing]] multi-lens [[Collodion process|wet plate]] camera, a fully functioning [[Caille Bros.]] Cail-O-Scope, and a [[megalethoscope|Ponti megalethoscope]]. As the most complete and actively used camera collection in the western states, this resource is highly valued by photography scholars, other museums, film/video producers, book/magazine publishers, regional schools, and photo clubs.

===University Print Collection===
The University Print Collection was founded in 1979 when several community patrons purchased a remarkable collection of photographic master prints from [[Friends of Photography]]. Currently, the collection exceeds 20,000 images that were created by over 1,000 photographers, including 7,000 [[Ansel Adams]] negatives. The University Print Collection includes quantities of vintage [[daguerreotype]]s, 1840s [[calotype]] negatives, Civil War era [[ambrotype]]s, and commercial [[tintype]]s as well as images from popular culture (1840s–present).

A major subset of the University Print Collection is the Keystone-Mast Collection, which comprises over 250,000 original [[stereograph|stereoscopic]] negatives and 100,000 paper prints. The original glass and film negatives form a vital primary record of worldwide social, cultural, industrial, agricultural historicity between 1860 and 1950. The visual online catalogs of the Keystone-Mast Collection have been available on the UCR/CMP website since 2001. A [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) Preservation and Access Grant primarily funded these online catalogs.

Additional funding, by [[Institute for Museum and Library Services]] (IMLS), supports the MOAC project to create catalogs served on the [[California Digital Library]].

===UCR/CMP Study Center Library===
UCR/CMP Study Center Library and Roy McJunkin Imaging Center are interlinked research areas containing 10,000 photography monographs, manuscript materials, artists books, technical literature, exhibition catalogs, salon annuals and runs of photography periodicals, a copy stand, plus a full complement of expanding computer technology.  International scholars, the education communities, and the museum staff utilize these research areas.

===Digital Virtual Collection===
The Digital Virtual Collection is the digitized content of the museum’s collection. Since 1994 when the Museum first went online, UCR/CMP has added over 13,000 pages of content that include over 400 themed micro-sites and 9 major finding aids. Ongoing grants and initiatives have enabled the museum to continue work on the website and allowed for continued digitization of artifacts found in the museums collections.

Frequently referred to as ''The Green Book'' due to its green cover, the '''Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook''' is a publication of the [[United States Department of Justice]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].  The manual instructs law enforcement officers on the proper method for filling out the monthly [[Uniform Crime Reports]] returns for police records and statistics.

==History==
The Committee on Uniform Crime Records, established by the [[International Association of Chiefs of Police]] (IACP) in 1927, published the first version of the manual in 1929.  At that time, the manual defined Part I and Part II offenses and well as the Return A – Monthly Return of Offenses Known to the Police.  The most recent revision of the manual was published in 2004.

The '''Western Development Museum''' is a network of four [[museum]]s in [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]] preserving and recording the social and economic development of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]]. The museum has branches in [[Moose Jaw]], [[North Battleford]], [[Saskatoon]] and [[Yorkton]]. Respectively, each branch  focuses on a different theme: [[transportation]], [[agriculture]], [[economy]], and [[people]]. The museum is affiliated with the [[Canadian Museums Association]], the [[Canadian Heritage Information Network]], and [[Virtual Museum of Canada]].

==History==
Originally started as a grass-roots movement, the museum was founded with the passage of the Western Development Museum Act in 1949. The first home for the museum in 1949 was a refurbished hangar in North Battleford. Later the same year a similar structure in Saskatoon was converted into a second location for the museum. A third hangar was procured in Yorkton in 1951 and was likewise converted. In 1972, the first purpose-built buildings were constructed to house new locations for the museums in Yorkton and Saskatoon, followed by the addition of a new museum in Moose Jaw in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://wdm.ca/AboutUs/history.htm |title =About the WDM - History and Timeline |publisher =Western Development Museum |accessdate = 2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moose Jaw – History of Transportation==
[[File:Avro Anson bomber trainer.JPG|thumb|right|[[Avro Anson]] bomber trainer]]
The Moose Jaw location of the museum is dedicated to all facets of transportation. (coordinates:{{coord| 50.4197|N|105.5305|W|display=inline}})

This branch offers a specific focus on aviation, which is appropriate given its proximity to [[CFB Moose Jaw]].&lt;ref name="MJWDM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wdm.ca/mj.html|title = About the History of Transportation WDM|accessdate = 2009-01-13|last = Western Development Museum|authorlink = |year = n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The aviation exhibits include a dedicated [[Snowbirds]] aerobatic team display. The aircraft collection includes such exhibits as an [[American Aerolights Eagle]] [[Ultralight aircraft (Canada)|ultralight]], an [[Avro Anson]] bomber trainer, [[Canadair CT-114 Tutor]] in [[Snowbirds]] markings, [[Canadair T-33|Canadair T-33A Silver Star]], [[Fairchild PT-19|Fairchild M63A3 Cornell]], and a [[Canadair T-33]] [[ejection seat]].&lt;ref name="MJWDM" /&gt;

The museum also has the Western Development Museum Short Line, a {{RailGauge|3ft|lk=on}} [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] railway outdoors on the property that utilizes the only operating steam locomotive in [[Saskatchewan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steamlocomotive.info/vlocomotive.cfm?Display=1967|title=Steam Locomotive Information|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North Battleford – Heritage Farm &amp; Village==
[[File:North Battleford SK - grain elevator.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Pioneer village scene in North Battleford]]
The North Battleford branch of the museum has displays relating to both farm and village aspects of pioneer life. The large barn is home to a number of farm animals. The museum demonstrates how farmers worked the land in the 1920s. The location has a pioneer village, which includes a grain elevator, a co-operative store, several churches, businesses, and homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdm.ca/nb.html |title=Western Development Museum – North Battleford |publisher=Wdm.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; (coordinates:{{coord| 52.7538|N|108.2584|W|display=inline}})

The former [[Saskatchewan Wheat Pool]] grain elevator No. 889 is from [[Keatley, Saskatchewan]] and was moved to the museum grounds in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsoptimist.ca/wdm-s-iconic-elevator-needs-help-1.1578931|title=WDM's iconic elevator needs help|author=Leslee Newman, WDM Curatorial Centre|work=Battlefords News-Optimist|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saskatoon – 1910 Boomtown==

The Saskatoon branch of the WDM was originally located on 11th Street on the city's west side, where it hosted an annual festival called "Pion-Era". The Saskatoon WDM relocated to its current site on the [[Prairieland Park]] grounds in the early 1970s. (coordinates:{{coord| 52.0950|N|106.6733|W|display=inline}}) For many years the Saskatoon branch was associated with the Saskatoon Exhibition and was instrumental in the fair being renamed "Pioneer Days", which incorporated Pion-Era. By the 1980s, the WDM and the Exhibition began to distance themselves from each other and by the 1990s the WDM was no longer a part of the exhibition, which in turn all but eliminated any remaining Pion-Era elements; Pioneer Days became "The Ex" and, later, simply "Saskatoon Exhibition".
The Saskatoon WDM is noted for its indoor recreation of a 1910-era "[[boomtown]]". Actual buildings from the era, combined with recreations, are kept in a [[climate control|climate-controlled]] environment and filled with [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] of the time. Buildings on site include a [[Homestead (buildings)|homestead]], a [[police station]], a [[bank]], a [[newspaper]] office (with working [[printing press]]), a [[saddle]] shop, a [[general store]], and a [[Dentistry|dentist's office]], to name a few. The museum also includes displays of [[vintage]] [[automobile]]s and [[farm equipment]]. The Saskatoon branch also has convention facilities and is home to the [[Saskatchewan Agricultural Hall of Fame]]. In 2005, the Saskatoon WDM underwent major [[renovation]]s to its exhibit halls in celebration of Saskatchewan's [[centennial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdm.ca/stoon.html |title=Western Development Museum – Saskatoon |publisher=Wdm.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yorkton – Story of People==
The Yorkton branch of the museum is focused on the immigrant experience. The Yorkton branch includes scenes illustrating the cultural roots of many of the groups who settled in western Canada, such as Ukrainians, English, Swedes, Germans, Doukhobors and Icelanders, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdm.ca/yk.html |title=Western Development Museum – Yorkton |publisher=Wdm.ca |date=2013-06-25 |accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; (coordinates:{{coord| 51.2177|N|102.4841|W|display=inline}})

==Major Artifacts==

* A replica of the [[Canadian Vickers Vedette]] is under construction by the Saskatchewan Western Development Museum. In 2003, the WDM acquired part of an original hull, which is displayed as an artifact in condition as found. With plans loaned from the [[Western Canada Aviation Museum]], a group of volunteers from the [[Vintage Aircraft Restorers]] undertook the construction. In 2014, the VAR Vendette Project won a Ninety-Nines Canadian Award in Aviation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdm.ca/mj/vedette.htm|title=Western Development Museum - Moose Jaw - Exhibits - Vintage Aircraft Restorers|work=wdm.ca|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationmuseum.eu/World/North_America/Canada/Saskatchewan/Moose_Jaw/Western_Development_Museum_photo/Vickers_Vedette_V_replica_wings.htm|title=Vickers Vedette V replica wings - Western Development Museum|work=aviationmuseum.eu|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wdm.ca/mj/var.htm|title=Western Development Museum - Moose Jaw - Exhibits - Vintage Aircraft Restorers|work=wdm.ca|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
