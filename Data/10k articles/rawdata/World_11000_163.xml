The '''Ahfad al-Rasul Brigades''' ({{lang-ar|ألوية أحفاد الرسول}} ''Al-wīat Aḥfād ar-Rasūl'', "Grandsons of [[Muhammad|the Prophet]] Brigades") was a [[Syria]]n [[Syrian opposition|rebel group]] fighting against the Syrian government in the [[Syrian Civil War]]. It was funded by the [[Qatar]]i government.&lt;ref name="CAP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/report/2013/05/14/63221/the-structure-and-organization-of-the-syrian-opposition/|title=The Structure and Organization of the Syrian Opposition|publisher=[[Center for American Progress]]|date=14 May 2013|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Basma Atassi|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/12/syrian-fighter-defects-qaeda-linked-group-201312158517493207.html|title=Syrian fighter defects to Qaeda-linked group - Features|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=19 May 2014|date=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and member groups==

Its notable subgroups included the Justice Battalion, the Golan Martyrs Battalion, the Golan Hawks Battalion, the [[Mountain Hawks Brigade|Falcons of Mount Zawiya Brigade]],&lt;ref name="ISW"/&gt; and the Qalamoun Liberation Front.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/security/2013/09/syria-christians-maaloula-jihadists-opposition-army.html|title=Syrian Christian Village Besieged by Jihadists|work=Al-Monitor|author=Sohaib Enjrainy|date=5 September 2013|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910235822/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/security/2013/09/syria-christians-maaloula-jihadists-opposition-army.html|archive-date=2013-09-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August 2013, the group had coopted some 50 groups from across Syria; however, it was strongest in [[Idlib Governorate]].&lt;ref name="ctc270813"/&gt; Its leader, [[Colonel]] Ziad Haj Obaid, was on the Arms Committee of the [[Supreme Military Council (Syria)|Supreme Military Council]].&lt;ref name="ISW"/&gt; The [[Allahu Akbar]] Brigade, based in [[al-Bukamal]] in the [[Deir ez-Zor Governorate]], was also part of Ahfad al-Rasul. In July 2013, [[Al Jazeera]] reported that the Allahu Akbar Brigade consisted of around 800 fighters.&lt;ref name=defect/&gt;

==History==
On 11 October 2012, the Ahfad al-Rasul Brigades, in coordination with [[Ansar al-Islam]], conducted a bombing of Syrian military compounds west of the [[Umayyad Square]] in [[Damascus]].&lt;ref name=bomb/&gt;

In December 2012, the Ahfad al-Rasul Brigades [[capital punishment in Syria|executed]] a [[Syrian Army]] officer on allegations of [[heresy]]. By this time, the group was described as a [[Salafist jihadist]] group independent from the [[Free Syrian Army]].&lt;ref name=heresy/&gt;

In July 2013, the Ahfad al-Rasul Brigades, along with [[Ahrar al-Sham]] and the [[Kurdish Islamic Front]], announced that they would fight alongside with [[al-Qaeda]]'s [[al-Nusra Front]] against the [[People's Protection Units]] (YPG) in northern Syria.&lt;ref name=aq/&gt;

In August 2013, clashes erupted between the Ahfad al-Rasul Brigades and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] in the city of [[Raqqa]]. On 13 August, ISIL [[suicide bomber]]s detonated 4 [[car bomb]]s at the Ahfad al-Rasul Brigades' headquarters at the Raqqa [[train station]], killing 6 Ahfad al-Rasul fighters, including two commanders, Abu Mazin&lt;ref name=vice/&gt; and Fahd al-Kajwan, and 6 civilians.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3ksalser.com/?page=view_articles&amp;id=01e647c702b3e0e34916cab98ce7ac50|title=The death of the commander of the descendants of the Prophet and the civilians in the bombing that targeted the train station in Al-Raqqa|work=Aksalser|date=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the next day, ISIL fighters fully captured the headquarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsdeeply.com/syria/articles/2013/08/16/in-raqqa-islamist-rebels-form-a-new-regime|title=In Raqqa, Islamist Rebels Form a New Regime|work=[[Syria Deeply]]|author=Alison Tahmizian Meuse|date=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clashes also erupted in [[al-Thawrah|Tabqa]].&lt;ref name=death/&gt; By 17 August, ISIL had defeated Ahfad al-Rasul in Raqqa and expelled it from the city.&lt;ref name=vice/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aksalser.com/?page=view_articles&amp;id=34f248008e9def7744ca1759b91d5c4a&amp;ar=843842874|title="The Grandfather of the Apostle" announces the end of its operations against the "State of Islam in Iraq and the Levant"|work=Aksalser|date=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[inter-rebel conflict during the Syrian Civil War|fighting]] soon spread to the [[Deir ez-Zor Governorate]], and tensions also rose between Ahfad al-Rasul and the al-Nusra Front. In November 2013, [[Saddam al-Jamal]], commander of Ahfad al-Rasul's Allahu Akbar Brigade, defected to ISIL.&lt;ref name=defect/&gt; Following al-Jamal's defection, 4 subunits of Ahfad al-Rasul also defected to ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2013/12/4_battalions_from_qa.php|title=4 battalions from Qatar-backed Islamist brigade defect to wage ‘armed jihadist struggle’|work=Long War Journal|author=Bill Roggio|date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 2014, the Ahfad al-Rasul Brigades was described as defunct, with many subunits rebranding themselves as members of the [[Syrian Revolutionaries Front]].&lt;ref name="CEIP"&gt;{{cite web|author=Aron Lund|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/syriaincrisis/?fa=54522|title=Syria’s Southern Spring Offensive|publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|date=14 February 2014|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latakia Governorate]]-based Brigade of the Chargers, formerly part of Ahfad al-Rasul, received [[BGM-71 TOW]] [[anti-tank missile]]s in early 2014, and became the [[1st Coastal Division]] in late 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://syriainbrief.wordpress.com/2018/01/02/the-cias-tow-program-a-list-of-rebel-groups-involved/|title=The CIA's TOW program: A list of rebel groups involved|work=Syria in Brief|date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports appeared in early 2017 that possible remnants of the Ahfad al-Rasul Brigades have reappeared as the Army of Grandsons in the northern [[Aleppo Governorate]] to fight ISIL as part of [[Operation Euphrates Shield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/badly_xeroxed/status/834120150077026306|title=Коуди Роша on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|access-date=2017-02-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Après toi'''" ([[French language|French]] for "After you") was the winning song of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972]] performed in [[French Language|French]] by [[Greece|Greek]] singer [[Vicky Leandros]], representing [[Luxembourg]]. The song was co-written by Leandros' father Leandros Papathanasiou, also known as [[Leo Leandros]], under his [[pseudonym]] ''Mario Panas''. This was Vicky Leandros' second entry in the Contest. In 1967 she had finished fourth with "[[L'amour est bleu]]" (better known under its English title "Love is Blue") which subsequently went on to become a worldwide hit when covered by French orchestra leader [[Paul Mauriat]].

"Après toi" is a dramatic [[ballad]], with the singer telling her lover what will happen to her once he has finally left her for someone else; "After you I will be nothing but the shadow of your shadow".

The song was performed seventeenth on the night (following [[Belgium]]'s [[Serge &amp; Christine Ghisoland]] with "[[À la folie ou pas du tout]]" and preceding the [[Netherlands]]' [[Sandra Reemer|Sandra]] &amp; [[Dries Holten|Andres]] with "[[Als het om de liefde gaat]]"). By the close of voting, it had received 128 points, placing it first in a field of 18.

Vicky Leandros also recorded the song in an [[English language]] version "Come What May" which was widely released around the world . In South Africa it was a number one hit. In Britain and Ireland it reached number two in the charts of both countries . Leandros also recorded the song in Italian ("Dopo Te"), German ("Dann kamst du"), Spanish ("Y Despues"), Greek ("Mono Esi") and Japanese ("Omoide Ni Ikiru ").

"Après toi" was succeeded as Contest winner in 1973 by [[Anne-Marie David]] singing "[[Tu te reconnaîtras]]", also for [[Luxembourg]].

As with "L'amour est bleu", "Après toi" has been afforded a number of translated cover versions including "Jak mám spát" (Czech) recorded by [[Helena Vondráčková]], "Keď si sám" (Slovak) recorded by [[Eva Kostolányiová]], "Rakastan saavuthan" (Finnish) recorded by [[Carola Standertskjöld]], "Posle tebe" (Serbian) recorded by [[Lola Novaković]], "Vắng bóng người yêu" (Vietnamese) recorded by [[Thanh Lan]], "Si te vas" (Spanish) recorded by [[Paloma San Basilio]], "Vad än sker" (Swedish) recorded by [[Ann-Louise Hanson]] and "След теб" (Bulgarian, ''"Sled teb"''), recorded by [[Lili Ivanova]].

The English version "Come What May" was covered by [[Filipina]] singer [[Pilita Corrales]] on her 1976 album ''Live At The Riveira With Pilita Amado Vol. 2''.

'''Austria–United Kingdom relations''', or '''Austrian-British relations''', are [[foreign relations]] between [[Austria]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

==History==

Relations between the Austrian Empire and England were established in the [[Middle Ages]], formal relations began in 1799. The two nations were enemies during the First World War and the Second World War. The United Kingdom and Austria now have warm relations. Both countries are full members of the [[European Union]].

According to the [[2001 UK Census]], some 20,000 Austrian born people were living in the UK, which is actually a drop of around 5% from 1991, despite this there are also large but unknown numbers of British born people of Austrian descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/born_abroad/countries/html/austria.stm |title=BBC Born Abroad, Austria |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomacy==
The Austrian ambassador to the United Kingdom is [[Martin Eichtinger]], he took up his post in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ambassador|url=http://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/embassy/london/the-embassy/the-ambassador.html|website=Austrian Foreign Ministry|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British ambassador to Austria is {{:List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Austria}} who took up his post in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/change-of-her-majestys-ambassador-to-austria-and-uk-permanent-representative-to-the-united-nations-in-vienna |title=Change of Her Majesty’s Ambassador to Austria and UK Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Vienna |publisher=Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office |date=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austria has an embassy in London and five honorary consulates (in [[Birmingham]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Manchester]], [[Grand Cayman]] and [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Austrian Representations|url=http://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/embassies-consulates/search-for-austrian-representations/|website=Austrian Foreign Ministry|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom has an embassy in [[Vienna]] and 4 honorary consulates in [[Bregenz]], [[Graz]], [[Innsbruck]], and [[Salzburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK and Austria|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/world/austria|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chad National Museum''' (''Musée national du Tchad'') is the [[national museum]] of [[Chad]]. It is located in the capital city of [[N'Djamena]], near [[Kempinski Hotel N'Djamena]]. The [[museum]] was established on October 6, 1962 in temporary quarters under the name of Chad National Museum, [[Fort-Lamy]], reflecting the earlier, colonial name of Chad's capital. In 1964, it moved to the former town hall, near the [[Place de l'Indépendance]].

At the time of the Chad National Museum's establishment, it had four rooms for prehistory, protohistory, archives, folk arts, crafts and traditions.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Jean-Paul Lebeuf|year = 1965|title = The Chad National Museum, Fort-Lemy|journal = Museum (UNESCO)|volume = XVIII|issue = 3 (The Role of Museums in Contemporary Africa)|pages = 150–153|url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001273/127389eo.pdf#11593|format = PDF|accessdate = 2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prehistory room, at least in 1965, included items related to [[Oldowan|pebble culture]], including material from the [[Amgamma]] cliff, [[Paleolithic]] implements, axes with helve-holes, nether millstones, and quartz and obsidian [[arrowheads]]. The museum at one time included a full-sized [[ochre]] reproduction of a hunting scene from the first millennium B.C. Its collection also included baked bricks, some attributed to [[Boulala]] and [[Babalia]] people. These items were discovered at the [[Bouta-Kabira]] sanctuary including human masks, bronze objects and bone tools.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Jean-Paul Lebeuf|year = 1965|title = The Chad National Museum, Fort-Lemy|journal = Museum (UNESCO)|volume = XVIII|issue = 3 (The Role of Museums in Contemporary Africa)|pages = 150–153|url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001273/127389eo.pdf#11593|format = PDF|accessdate = 2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of its artifacts have been lost due to the instability in the country. It has a notable collection of [[musical instruments]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sibmas.org/idpac/africa/tdn001.html#2 N'Djamena, Chad SIBMAS International Directory of Performing Arts Collections and Institutions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203309/http://www.sibmas.org/idpac/africa/tdn001.html#2 |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Chanteur de charme"''' ([[English Language|English]] translation: "Crooner") was the [[France|French]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988]], performed in [[French Language|French]] by [[Gérard Lenorman]].

The song was performed nineteenth on the night (following [[Italy]]'s [[Luca Barbarossa]] with "[[Vivo (Ti scrivo)]]" and preceding [[Portugal]]'s [[Dora (singer)|Dora]] with "[[Voltarei]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 64 points, placing 10th in a field of 21.

As befits the title, the song is a ballad, with Lenorman singing about the subject matter that [[crooner]]s traditionally sing about. That is to say, he sings about the subject matter ''itself'', rather than singing the type of song usually associated with the style. Indeed, he likens the songs themselves to ''"these stories of three times nothing, which rhyme badly, which do good"'' and later adds that ''"Nothing has ever prevented us from setting to music, those endlessly repeated clichés, romantic feelings"'' and remarks that his heart ''"stupidly proposes on the first page of a paper"''.

It was succeeded as [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|French representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1989|1989 Contest]] by [[Nathalie Pâque]] with "[[J'ai volé la vie]]".

Prior to its uniform adoption of [[proportional representation]] in 1999, the [[United Kingdom]] used [[plurality voting system|first-past-the-post]] for the [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]] in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]. The [[European Parliament constituency|European Parliament constituencies]] used under that system were smaller than the later regional constituencies and only had one [[Member of the European Parliament]] each. 

The constituency of '''Cheshire East''' was one of them.

From 1979 to 1984, it consisted of the [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|Westminster Parliament constituencies]] of [[Crewe (UK Parliament constituency)|Crewe]], [[Hazel Grove (UK Parliament constituency)|Hazel Grove]], [[Knutsford (UK Parliament constituency)|Knutsford]], [[Macclesfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Macclesfield]], [[Newton (UK Parliament constituency)|Newton]], [[Runcorn (UK Parliament constituency)|Runcorn]], and [[Warrington (UK Parliament constituency)|Warrington]].  From 1984 to 1994, it consisted of Congleton, Crewe and Nantwich, Macclesfield, Staffordshire Moorlands, Tatton, Warrington North, and Warrington South.  From 1994 to 1999, it consisted of Altrincham and Sale, Halton, Macclesfield, Manchester Wythenshawe, Tatton, Warrington North, and Warrington South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/ |title=David Boothroyd's United Kingdom Election Results |accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Council of the Notariats of the European Union''' ('''CNUE''') is a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit organisation]] of [[notary public|notaries]] from 22 European countries. The CNUE is the official body representing the notariat in dealings with the institutions of the [[European Union]]. Speaking for the profession, it expresses the joint decisions of its members to the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notaries-of-europe.eu/about-us/overview |title=Page title - CNUE |publisher=Notaries-of-europe.eu |date=2006-01-01 |accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Conference of the Presidents of the Notariats of the six founding countries of the [[European Economic Community]] (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) was founded in Paris in 1976, with its memorandum of understanding signed under the auspices of and within the framework of the [[International Union of Notaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notaries-of-europe.eu/news/latest/2013/cnue-anniversary |title=20th Anniversary - CNUE |publisher=Notaries-of-europe.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the Conference of the Presidents became the Permanent Conference of the Notariats of the European Community, thereby affirming its nature as a supranational association of notaries. In 1995, it became the Conference of the Notariats of the European Union (CNUE), and then adopted its current name of Council of the Notariats of the European Union on January 1, 2006. In 1996 the CNUE introduced a one-year presidency system, following the model of other European institutions.

Since 1992, the CNUE has been constantly evolving, in terms of both its internal structure and its functions. Over the years the CNUE has become progressively larger, first with the addition of Spain, Portugal, and Austria. Nine additional notariats became members in 2004 in parallel with the enlargement of the EU, enabling the organisation to make a significant leap from 10 to 19 members. Bulgaria and Romania joined in 2007, bringing the number of member notariats to 21 of the 27 EU Member States. On July 1, 2013, the Croatian notariat also joined the CNUE.

== Members ==
The CNUE represents the Latin-type notariats of all EU Member States familiar with this institution:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanlawinstitute.eu/membership/institutional-observers/council-of-the-notariats-of-the-european-union-cnue/ |title=ELI » Council of the Notariats of the European Union (CNUE) |publisher=Europeanlawinstitute.eu |date=2006-01-01 |accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkish notariat (Turkiye Noterler Birligi) gained observing member status in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notaries-of-europe.eu/news/latest/2013/turkey-member |title=Turkey - CNUE |publisher=Notaries-of-europe.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European notariats are represented in the CNUE by the presidents of the national notarial bodies. The CNUE is supervised by a President, the CNUE's spokesperson, who has tenure for one year, renewable for one year.

== Mission ==
The CNUE's mission is to promote the notariat as a cornerstone of preventive justice. It contributes actively to any decision-making processes of the European institutions. This involves areas including the legal aspects of citizenship and running a business, access to justice and consumer protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notaires.fr/notaires/le-conseil-des-notariats-de-l-union-europeenne-cnue |title=Le Conseil des Notariats de l'Union européenne (CNUE) &amp;#124; Notaires de France |publisher=Notaires.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the CNUE keeps its members updated on developments in European legislation and any initiatives taken by the EU institutions. It also assists in the continuous training of notaries in [[European Union law]].

The CNUE does not, however, limit itself only to following EU work; it also makes proposals. It implements projects with a European dimension involving all its members, with the aim of constructing the area of justice, freedom and security expected by European citizens.

'''"Donne-moi une chance"''' ([[English language|English]] translation: "Give me a chance") was the [[Luxembourg]]ish entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993]], performed in [[French language|French]] and [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] by the duo [[Modern Times (band)|Modern Times]]. The song was the third ever [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourgish entry]] to feature lyrics in the Luxembourgish language, in this case however only partly.

The song is an up-tempo, [[rock music|rock]]-influenced number, with the vocalists pleading with each other to ''"Give me a chance to tell you"'' about how they feel while on a romantic date. Modern Times also recorded the song in English, as "Heaven Only Knows".

The song was performed fifteenth on the night (following [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s [[Niamh Kavanagh]] with "[[In Your Eyes (Niamh Kavanagh song)|In Your Eyes]]" and preceding [[Slovenia]]'s [[1X Band]] with "[[Tih deževen dan]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 11 points, placing 20th in a field of 25.&lt;ref name="Big in Eurovision"/&gt;

The song remains the last Luxembourgish representative at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], as after the 1993 Contest Luxembourg opted to stop competing.&lt;ref name="Big in Eurovision"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/story/top-10-entries-from-luxembourg|title=Luxembourg: Small in size, big in Eurovision|author=Victor Escudero|date=19 November 2017|publisher=Eurovision TV|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42814">In [[diplomatic history]], the "'''Eastern Question'''" refers to the strategic competition and political considerations of the European [[Great Powers]] in light of the political and economic instability in the [[Ottoman Empire]] from the late 18th to early 20th centuries. Characterized as the "[[sick man of Europe]]", the relative weakening of the empire's military strength in the second half of the eighteenth century threatened to undermine the fragile [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] system largely shaped by the [[Concert of Europe]]. The Eastern Question encompassed myriad interrelated elements: Ottoman military defeats, Ottoman institutional insolvency, the ongoing Ottoman political and economic modernization programme, the rise of ethno-religious nationalism in its provinces, and Great Power rivalries.&lt;ref&gt;Theophilus C. Prousis. Review of Macfie, A. L., ''The Eastern Question, 1774-1923''. HABSBURG, H-Net Reviews. December, 1996. [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=712]&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the Eastern Question is normally dated to 1774, when the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)]] ended in defeat for the Ottomans. As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire was believed to be imminent, the European powers engaged in a power struggle to safeguard their military, strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. [[Imperial Russia]] stood to benefit from the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]]; on the other hand, [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[History of the United Kingdom|Great Britain]] deemed the preservation of the Empire to be in their best interests. The Eastern Question was put to rest after [[World War I]], one of the outcomes of which was the [[collapse of the Ottoman Empire|collapse and division of the Ottoman holdings]].
 
==Background==
{{main article|International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)}}
[[File:Ottoman empire.svg|thumb|300px|At the height of its power (1683), the [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled territory in the Near East and North Africa, as well as Central and Southeastern Europe.]]

The Eastern Question emerged as the power of the Ottoman Empire began to decline during the 18th century. The Ottomans were at the height of their power in 1683, when they lost the [[Battle of Vienna]] to the combined forces of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and Austria, under the command of [[John III Sobieski]]. Peace was made much later, in 1699, with the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]], which forced the Ottoman Empire to cede many of its Central European possessions, including those portions of Hungary which it had occupied. Its westward expansion arrested, the Ottoman Empire never again posed a serious threat to Austria, which became the dominant power in its region of Europe. The Eastern Question did not truly develop until the [[History of the Russo-Turkish wars|Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the 18th century.

==Napoleonic Era==
{{main article|Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|Anglo-Turkish War (1807–09)}}
[[File:Athosbattle.jpg|thumb|300px|''Russian Fleet after the [[Battle of Athos]]'', by [[Aleksey Bogolyubov]] (1824–96)]]

The Napoleonic era (1799–1815) brought some relief to the faltering Ottoman Empire. It distracted Russia from further advances. [[Napoleon I]] himself invaded Egypt, but his army was trapped there when the British sank the French fleet. A peace interlude in 1803 allowed the army to return to France.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Cole, ''Napoleon's Egypt: Invading the Middle East'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

To secure his own domination and to render the rest of Europe virtually powerless, Napoleon established an alliance with Russia by concluding the [[Treaties of Tilsit|Treaty of Tilsit]] in 1807. Russia undertook to aid Napoleon in his war against Britain; in turn, the Emperor of Russia would receive the Ottoman territories of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]. If the Sultan refused to surrender these territories, France and Russia were to attack the Empire, and the Ottoman domains in Europe were to be partitioned between the two allies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Anderson, ''The Eastern Question, 1774–1923: A Study in International Relations'' (1966) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Napoleonic scheme threatened not only the Sultan, but also Britain, Austria and Prussia, which was almost powerless in the face of such a potent alliance. The alliance naturally proved accommodating to the Austrians, who hoped that a joint Franco-Russian attack, which would probably have utterly devastated the Ottoman Empire, could be prevented by diplomacy; but if diplomatic measures failed, the Austrian minister [[Klemens von Metternich]] decided that he would support the partition of the Ottoman Empire—a solution disadvantageous to Austria, but not as dangerous as a complete Russian takeover of Southeastern Europe.

An attack on the Empire, however, did not come to pass, and the alliance concluded at Tilsit was dissolved by the [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1812. Following Napoleon's defeat by the Great Powers in 1815, representatives of the victors met at the [[Congress of Vienna]], but failed to take any action relating to the territorial integrity of the decaying Ottoman Empire. This omission, together with the exclusion of the Sultan from the [[Holy Alliance]], was interpreted by many as supportive of the position that the Eastern Question was a Russian domestic issue that did not concern any other European nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Alison Phillips|title=The confederation of Europe: a study of the European alliance, 1813–1823, as an experiment in the international organization of peace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K2BJAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA234|year=1914|publisher=Longmans, Green|pages=234–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serbian revolution==
{{See also|Serbian revolution|}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Uprising.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The takeover of [[Belgrade]], 1806]] --&gt;
'''Serbian revolution''' or ''Revolutionary Serbia'' refers to the [[Révolution nationale|national]] and [[social revolution]] of the [[Serbs|Serbian people]] between 1804 and 1815, during which Serbia managed to fully emancipate from the [[Ottoman Empire]] and exist as a sovereign European [[nation-state]], and a latter period (1815–1833), marked by intense negotiations between [[Belgrade]] and [[Ottoman Empire]]. The term was invented by a famous German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] in his book ''Die Serbische Revolution'', published in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold von Ranke, ''A History of Serbia and the Serbian Revolution'' (1847)&lt;/ref&gt; These events marked the foundation of [[Principality of Serbia|modern Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;L. S. Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'' (London: Hurst and Co., 2000), p. 248-250.&lt;/ref&gt; While the first phase of the revolution (1804–1815) was in fact a war of independence, the second phase (1815–1833) resulted in official recognition of a [[Principality of Serbia|suzerain Serbian state]] by the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] (the Ottoman government), thus bringing the revolution to its end.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview see Wayne S. Vucinich, "Marxian Interpretations of the First Serbian Revolution." ''Journal of Central European Affairs''  (1961) 21#1: 3–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolution took place by stages:  the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804–13), led by [[Karađorđe Petrović]]; [[Hadži Prodanova buna|Hadži Prodan's revolt]] (1814); the [[Second Serbian Uprising]] (1815) under [[Miloš Obrenović]]; and official recognition of the Serbian state (1815–1833) by the Porte.

''[[The Proclamation]]'' (1809) by [[Karađorđe]] in the capital [[Belgrade]] represented the peak of the revolution. It called for unity of the [[Serbs|Serbian nation]], emphasizing the importance of freedom of religion, [[Serbian history]] and formal, written rules of law, all of which it claimed the [[Ottoman Empire]] had failed to provide. It also called on Serbs to stop paying the [[Jizya|jizya tax]] to the Porte.

The ultimate result of the uprisings was Serbia's [[suzerainty]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Principality of Serbia]] was established, governed by its own Parliament, Government, Constitution and its own royal dynasty.  Social element of the revolution was achieved through introduction of the bourgeois society values in Serbia, which is why it was considered the world's easternmost bourgeois revolt, which culminated with the abolition of [[feudalism]] in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nb.rs/view_file.php?file_id=57&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the [[Miloš Obrenović#Later rule|first constitution in the Balkans]] in 1835 ([[Miloš Obrenović#Later rule|later abolished]]) and the founding in 1808 of its first university, [[University of Belgrade|Belgrade's Great Academy]], added to the achievements of the young Serb state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bg.ac.rs/en_istorijat.php University of Belgrade&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1833, Serbia was officially recognized as a tributary to the Ottoman Empire and as such, acknowledged as a hereditary monarchy. Full independence of the Principality was internationally recognized during the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;John K. Cox, ''The History of Serbia'' (2002) pp 39–62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek Revolt==
{{main article|Greek War of Independence|Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)}}
[[File:Vasilika.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Vassilika]] in 1821 marked an early turning point in the war.]]
The Eastern Question once again became a major European issue when the [[Greece|Greeks]] declared independence from the Sultan in 1821. It was at about this time that the phrase "Eastern Question" was coined. Ever since the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, there had been rumours that the Emperor of Russia sought to invade the Ottoman Empire, and the Greek Revolt seemed to make an invasion even more likely. The British foreign minister, [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh]], as well as the Austrian foreign minister, Metternich, counselled the Emperor of Russia, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], not to enter the war. Instead, they pleaded that he maintain the [[Concert of Europe]] (the spirit of broad collaboration in Europe which had persisted since Napoleon's defeat). A desire for peaceful co-operation was also held by Alexander I, who had founded the Holy Alliance. Rather than immediately putting the Eastern Question to rest by aiding the Greeks and attacking the Ottomans, Alexander wavered, ultimately failing to take any decisive action.

Alexander's death in 1825 brought [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] to the Imperial Throne of Russia. Deciding that he would no longer tolerate negotiations and conferences, he chose to intervene in Greece.  Britain also soon became involved, interested in imposing its will on a newly formed Greek state in part to prevent it becoming a wholly Russian vassal. The spirit of [[Romanticism]] that then dominated Western European cultural life also made support for Greek independence politically viable.  France too aligned itself with the Greeks, but Austria (still worried about Russian expansion) did not. Outraged by the interference of the Great Powers, the Ottoman Sultan, [[Mahmud II]], denounced Russia as an enemy of [[Islam]], prompting Russia to declare war in 1828. An alarmed Austria sought to form an anti-Russian coalition, but its attempts were in vain.

As the war continued into 1829, Russia gained a firm advantage over the Ottoman Empire. By prolonging hostilities further, however, Russia would have invited Austria to enter the war against her and would have resulted in considerable suspicion in Britain. Therefore, for the Russians to continue with the war in hopes of destroying the Ottoman Empire would have been inexpedient.  At this stage, the King of France, [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], proposed the partition of the Ottoman Empire among Austria, Russia and others, but his scheme was presented too belatedly to produce a result.

Thus, Russia was able to secure neither a decisive defeat nor a partition of the Ottoman Empire. She chose, however, to adopt the policy of degrading the Ottoman Empire to a mere dependency. In 1829, the Emperor of Russia concluded the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] with the Sultan; his empire was granted additional territory along the Black Sea, Russian commercial vessels were granted access to the [[Dardanelles]], and the commercial rights of Russians in the Ottoman Empire were enhanced. The Greek War of Independence was terminated shortly thereafter, as Greece was granted independence by the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)|Treaty of Constantinople]] in 1832.

==Muhammad Ali of Egypt==
{{main article|Muhammad Ali of Egypt}}
[[Image:ModernEgypt, Muhammad Ali by Auguste Couder, BAP 17996.jpg|right|thumb|[[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]]]]
Just as the Greek Revolt was coming to an end, a conflict broke out in the Ottoman Empire between the Sultan and his nominal [[viceroy]] in [[Egypt]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mehmet Ali]]. The modern and well trained Egyptians looked as though they could conquer the entire empire.  The Tsar of Russia, in keeping with his policy of reducing the Ottoman Sultan to a petty vassal, offered to form an alliance with the Sultan. In 1833, the two rulers negotiated the [[Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi]], in which Russia achieved the aim of securing complete dominance over the Ottomans. The Russians pledged to protect the Empire from external attacks; in turn, the Sultan pledged to close the Dardanelles to warships whenever Russia was at war. This provision of the Treaty raised a problem known as the "Straits Question". The agreement provided for the closure for all warships, but many European statesmen mistakenly believed that the clause allowed Russian vessels. Britain and France were angered by the misinterpreted clause; they also sought to contain Russian expansion. The two kingdoms, however, differed on how to achieve their objective; the British wished to uphold the Sultan, but the French preferred to make Muhammad Ali (whom they saw as more competent) the ruler of the entire Ottoman Empire. Russian intervention led the Sultan to negotiate a peace with Muhammad Ali in 1833, but war broke out once again in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammad ‘Ali'' (Cambridge University Press, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sultan Mahmud II died the same year, leaving the Ottoman Empire to his son [[Abdulmejid I]] in a critical state: the Ottoman army had been significantly defeated by the forces of Muhammad Ali. Another disaster followed when the entire Turkish fleet was seized by the Egyptian forces. Great Britain and Russia now intervened to prevent the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, but France still continued to support Muhammad Ali. In 1840, however, the Great Powers agreed to compromise; Muhammad Ali agreed to make a nominal act of submission to the Sultan, but was granted hereditary control of Egypt.

The only unresolved issue of the period was the Straits Question. In 1841, Russia consented to the abrogation of the Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi by accepting the [[London Straits Convention]]. The Great Powers — Russia, Britain, France, Austria and Prussia — agreed to the re-establishment of the "ancient rule" of the Ottoman Empire, which provided that the Turkish straits would be closed to all warships whatsoever, with the exception of the Sultan's allies during wartime.  With the Straits Convention, the Russian Emperor Nicholas I abandoned the idea of reducing the Sultan to a state of dependence, and returned to the plan of partitioning Ottoman territories in Europe.

Thus, after the resolution of the Egyptian struggle which had begun in 1831, the weak Ottoman Empire was no longer wholly dependent on Russia but was dependent on the Great Powers for protection. Attempts at internal reform failed to end the decline of the Empire. By the 1840s, the Ottoman Empire had become the "[[sick man of Europe]]", and its eventual dissolution appeared inevitable.

==Revolutions of 1848==
{{main article|Revolutions of 1848}}
After the Great Powers reached a compromise to end the revolt of Mehmet Ali, the Eastern Question lay dormant for about a decade until revived by the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. Although Russia could have seized the opportunity to attack the Ottoman Empire—France and Austria were at the time occupied by their own insurrections—it chose not to. Instead, Emperor Nicholas committed his troops to the defence of Austria, hoping to establish goodwill to allow him to seize Ottoman possessions in Europe later.

After the Austrian Revolution was suppressed, an Austro-Russian war against the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent. The Emperors of both Austria and Russia demanded that the Sultan return Austrian rebels who had sought asylum in the Empire, but he refused. The indignant monarchs withdrew their ambassadors to the [[Ottoman Porte|Sublime Porte]], threatening armed conflict. Almost immediately, however, Britain and France sent their fleets to protect the Ottoman Empire. The two Emperors, deeming military hostilities futile, withdrew their demands for the surrender of the fugitives.  The short crisis created a closer relationship between Britain and France, which led to a joint war against Russia in the Crimean War of 1853–56.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848–1918'' (1954) pp 33–35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimean War==
{{main article|Crimean War}}
A new conflict began during the 1850s with a religious dispute. Under treaties negotiated during the 18th century, France was the guardian of Roman Catholics in the Ottoman Empire, while Russia was the protector of Orthodox Christians. For several years, however, Catholic and Orthodox monks had disputed possession of the [[Church of the Nativity]] and the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. During the early 1850s, the two sides made demands which the Sultan could not possibly satisfy simultaneously. In 1853, the Sultan adjudicated in favour of the French, despite the vehement protestations of the local Orthodox monks.&lt;ref&gt;Orlando Figes, ''Crimea: The Last Crusade'' (2010); also published as ''The Crimean War: A History'' (2010)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor Nicholas of Russia dispatched [[Aleksandr Sergeyevich Menshikov|Prince Menshikov]], on a special mission to the Porte. By previous treaties, the Sultan was committed "to protect the Christian religion and its Churches", but Menshikov tried to negotiate a new treaty, under which Russia would be allowed to interfere whenever it deemed the Sultan's protection inadequate. At the same time, however, the British government sent [[Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe]], who learnt of Menshikov's demands upon arriving. Through skillful diplomacy, Lord Stratford convinced the Sultan to reject the treaty, which compromised the independence of the Ottomans. Shortly after he learned of the failure of Menshikov's diplomacy, Nicholas marched into Moldavia and Wallachia (Ottoman principalities in which Russia was acknowledged as a special guardian of the Orthodox Church), with the pretext that the Sultan failed to resolve the issue of the Holy Places. Nicholas believed that the European powers would not object strongly to the annexation of a few neighbouring Ottoman provinces, especially given Russian involvement in suppressing the Revolutions of 1848.

Britain, seeking to maintain the security of the Ottoman Empire, sent a fleet to the Dardanelles, where it was joined by another fleet sent by France. Yet the European powers hoped for a diplomatic compromise. The representatives of the four neutral Great Powers—Britain, France, Austria and Prussia—met in [[Vienna]], where they drafted a note which they hoped would be acceptable to Russia and the Empire. The note was approved by Nicolas but rejected by Sultan Abd-ul-Mejid I, who felt that the document's poor phrasing left it open to many interpretations. Britain, France and Austria were united in proposing amendments to mollify the Sultan, but their suggestions were ignored in the Court of [[Saint Petersburg]]. Britain and France set aside the idea of continuing negotiations, but Austria and Prussia held hope for diplomacy despite the rejection of the proposed amendments. The Sultan proceeded to war, his armies attacking the Russian army near the Danube. Nicholas responded by despatching warships, which destroyed the entire Ottoman fleet at [[Battle of Sinop|Sinop]] on 30 November 1853, allowing Russia to land and supply its forces on the Ottoman shores fairly easily. The destruction of the Ottoman fleet and the threat of Russian expansion alarmed both Britain and France, who stepped forth in defence of the Ottoman Empire. In 1854, after Russia ignored an Anglo-French ultimatum to withdraw from the Danubian Principalities, Britain and France declared war.

Emperor Nicholas I presumed that Austria, in return for the support rendered during the Revolutions of 1848, would side with him, or at the very least remain neutral. However, Austria felt threatened by the Russian troops in the nearby Danubian Principalities. When Britain and France demanded the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Principalities, Austria supported them; and, though it did not immediately declare war on Russia, it refused to guarantee its neutrality. When, in the summer of 1854, Austria made another demand for the withdrawal of troops, Russia (fearing that Austria would enter the war) complied.

Though the original grounds for war were lost when Russia withdrew her troops from the Danubian Principalities, Britain and France continued hostilities. Determined to address the Eastern Question by ending the Russian threat to the Ottoman Empire, the allies posed several conditions for a ceasefire, including that Russia should give up its protectorate over the Danubian Principalities; that Russia should abandon any right to interfere in Ottoman affairs on the behalf of Orthodox Christians; that the Straits Convention of 1841 was to be revised; and finally, all nations were to be granted access to the river Danube. As the Emperor refused to comply with these "Four Points", the [[Crimean War]] proceeded.

Peace negotiations began in 1856 under the Emperor Nicholas I's successor, [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. Under the ensuing [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the "Four Points" plan proposed earlier was largely adhered to; most notably, Russia's special privileges relating to the Danubian Principalities were transferred to the Great Powers as a group. In addition, warships of all nations were perpetually excluded from the Black Sea, once the home to a Russian fleet (which had been destroyed during the war). The Emperor of Russia and the Sultan agreed not to establish any naval or military arsenal on that sea coast. The Black Sea clauses came at a tremendous disadvantage to Russia, for it greatly diminished the naval threat it posed to the Ottomans. Moreover, all the Great Powers pledged to respect the independence and territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire.

The Treaty of Paris stood until 1871, when France was crushed in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. While Prussia and several other German states united into a powerful [[German Empire]], [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] was deposed in the formation of the [[French Third Republic]]. Napoleon had opposed Russia over the Eastern Question in order to gain the support of Britain. But the new French Republic did not oppose Russian interference in the Ottoman Empire because that did not significantly threaten French interests. Encouraged by the decision of France, and supported by the German minister [[Otto von Bismarck|Otto, Fürst von Bismarck]], Russia denounced the Black Sea clauses of the treaty agreed to in 1856. As Britain alone could not enforce the clauses, Russia once again established a fleet in the Black Sea.

==Great Eastern Crisis (1875–78)==
{{main article|Great Eastern Crisis}}
{{see also|Herzegovina uprising (1875–1877)|April Uprising|Constantinople Conference|Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878}}

Britain, France, and Austria opposed the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] because the Ottoman Empire gave Russia too much influence in the [[Balkans]], where insurrections were frequent. After many attempts, a diplomatic settlement was reached at the [[Congress of Berlin]], and the new [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]] revised the earlier treaty. Germany's [[Otto von Bismarck]] presided over the Congress, acting as an "honest broker".&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor, The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848–1918 (1954) pp 228–54&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, the territory of [[Herzegovina]] rebelled against the Sultan, in the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875-1878)|Herzegovinian rebellion]] in the Province of Bosnia, and Bulgaria rebelled in the [[April Uprising]]. The Great Powers believed they should intervene to prevent a bloody war in the Balkans. The first to act were the members of the [[League of the Three Emperors]] (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia), whose common attitude toward the Eastern Question was embodied in the Andrassy Note (named for the Hungarian diplomat [[Julius Andrassy|Julius, Count Andrassy]]). The Note, seeking to avoid a widespread conflagration in Southeastern Europe, urged the Sultan to institute various reforms, including granting religious liberty to Christians. A joint commission of Christians and Muslims was to be established to ensure the enactment of appropriate reforms. With the approval of Britain and France, the Note was submitted to the Sultan, and he agreed on 31 January 1876. But the Herzegovinian leaders rejected the proposal, pointing out that the Sultan had already failed his promises of reforms.

Representatives of the Three Emperors met again in Berlin, where they approved the [[Berlin Memorandum]]. To convince the Herzegovinians, the Memorandum suggested that international representatives be allowed to oversee the institution of reforms in the rebelling provinces. But before the Memorandum could be approved by the Porte, the Ottoman Empire was convulsed by internal strife, which led to the deposition of Sultan Abdul-Aziz. The new Sultan, [[Murad V]], was himself deposed three months later due to his mental instability, bringing [[Abdul Hamid II]] to power. In the meantime, the hardships of the Ottomans had increased; their treasury was empty, and they faced insurrections not only in Herzegovina and Bulgaria, but also in [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]. Still, the Ottoman Empire managed to crush the insurgents in August 1876. The result incommoded Russia, which had planned to take possession of various Ottoman territories in Southeastern Europe in the course of the conflict.

After the uprisings were largely suppressed, however, rumours of Ottoman atrocities against the rebellious population shocked European sensibilities. Russia now intended to enter the war on the side of the rebels. Another attempt for peace was made by delegates of the Great Powers (who now numbered six due to the rise of Italy) assembled at the [[Constantinople Conference]] in 1876. However, the Sultan refused to allow international representatives to oversee the reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1877, the Great Powers again made proposals to the Ottoman Empire which were rejected.

[[File:SouthEast Europe 1878.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|South-East Europe after the [[Congress of Berlin]], 1878]]

Russia declared war on 24 April 1877. Its chancellor [[Alexander Gorchakov|Prince Gorchakov]] had effectively secured Austrian neutrality with the [[Reichstadt Agreement]], under which Ottoman territories captured in the course of the war would be partitioned between the Russian and Austria-Hungarian Empires, with the latter obtaining Bosnia and Herzegovina. Britain, though still fearing the Russian threat to British dominance in Southern Asia, did not involve itself in the conflict. However, when Russia threatened to conquer Constantinople, [[British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]] urged Austria and Germany to ally with him against this war aim. As a result, Russia sued for peace through the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], which stipulated independence to Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro, autonomy to Bulgaria, reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina; the ceding [[Dobruja]] and parts of [[Armenia]] and a large indemnity to Russia. This would give Russia great influence in Southeastern Europe, as it could dominate the newly independent states. To reduce these advantages to Russia, the Great Powers (especially Britain), insisted that the treaty be heavily revised.

At the [[Congress of Berlin]], the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]] adjusted the boundaries of the new states in the Ottoman Empire's favour. Bulgaria was divided into two states (Bulgaria and [[Eastern Rumelia]]), as it was feared that a single state would be susceptible to Russian domination. Ottoman cessions to Russia were largely sustained. Bosnia and Herzegovina, though still nominally within the Ottoman Empire, were transferred to [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Austrian control]]. The Ottoman island of [[Cyprus]] was given to Britain via a secret agreement between Britain and the Ottoman Empire. These final two procedures were predominantly forced by Disraeli, who was famously described by [[Otto von Bismarck]] as "The old Jew, that is the man", after his level-headed Palmerstonian approach to the Eastern Question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Concise Dictionary of Foreign Quotations |last=Lejeune |first=Anthony |year=2002 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=1-57958-341-5 |page=139 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KLz2QEdQaoC&amp;pg=PA139 |accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany and the Ottoman Empire==
{{Further|Baghdad Railway}}
Germany drew away from Russia and became closer to Austria-Hungary, with whom she concluded the [[Dual Alliance, 1879|Dual Alliance]] in 1879. Germany also closely allied with the Ottoman Empire. Germany took over the re-organisation of the Ottoman military and financial system; in return, it received several commercial concessions, including permission to build the [[Baghdad Railway]], which secured for them access to several important economic markets and had the potential for German entry into the Persian Gulf area controlled by Britain. Germany was driven not only by commercial interests, but also by an imperialistic and militaristic rivalry with Britain.  Meanwhile Britain agreed to the [[Entente Cordiale]] with France in 1904, thereby resolving differences between the two countries over international affairs. Britain also reconciled with Russia in 1907 with the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]].&lt;ref&gt;Sean McMeekin, ''The Berlin-Baghdad Express: The Ottoman Empire and Germany's Bid for World Power'' (2012) [https://www.amazon.com/Berlin-Baghdad-Express-Ottoman-Empire-Germanys/dp/0674064321/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Young Turk Revolution==
{{main article|Young Turk Revolution}}

In April 1908, the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (more commonly called the [[Young Turks]]), a political party opposed to the despotic rule of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]], led [[Young Turk Revolution|a rebellion against the Sultan]]. The pro-reform Young Turks deposed the Sultan by July 1909, replacing him with the ineffective [[Mehmed V]]. This began the [[Second Constitutional Era]] of the Ottoman Empire.

In the following years, various constitutional and political reforms were instituted, but the decay of the Ottoman Empire continued.

==Bosnian Crisis==
{{main article|Bosnian crisis}}

In October 1908, Austria-Hungary's plans for the [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] were opposed by Serbia, which sought Russian assistance. Russia, however, could not comply; a defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] had devastated her, and Germany threatened to support Austria-Hungary during a war. Britain and France, who were not directly concerned by the annexation, did not become involved. Thus unaided, Serbia was forced to renounce her opposition to the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

[[File:Gmp logo.png|thumb|Global Marshall Plan Initiative Logo]]
The '''Global Marshall Plan Initiative''' views itself as an integrative organizational platform for a "world in balance". Composed of a network of more than 5000 supporters from all levels of society, brought together from politics, economics and [[civil society]], the Initiative is based on five core goals for fair [[globalization]]. Through its network-like character, it is organized through even hierarchies and without a centre. Everyone is invited to actively participate and take action with their circles and the accompanying opportunities to implement a World in Balance!

The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to establish a framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy – a global Eco-Social Market Economy.

== Origins  ==
[[File:Al Gore, Vice President of the United States, official portrait 1994.jpg|thumb|Al Gore - Author of "Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit"]]
The idea of a [[Global Marshall Plan]] was first published in 1990 by U.S. politician, entrepreneur and environmentalist [[Al Gore]] in his book “Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit”. The choice of name deliberately recalls the historical [[Marshall Plan]] after the Second World War (officially: European Recovery Program), a symbol for [[hope]], [[solidarity]] and [[peace]].

The idea of a Global Marshall Plan was not new but had already been endorsed in the 1990s by personalities from a variety of sectors: [[Kofi Annan]], [[Al Gore]], [[Hans Küng]], [[Susan George (political scientist)|Susan George]], Mikhail Gorbachov, His Royal Highness Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, [[George Soros]], Lutz Wicke, [[Georg Winter (manager)|Georg Winter]] and many others (Global Contract). As early as the beginning of the 1990s an ecological Marshall Plan was established by prominent personalities such as journalist Franz Alt and German Green politician Joscka Fisher. Along with many other supporters, they called for the establishment of an eco-social market economy, 100 billion DM put towards the environment every year and a Kerosin tax.

As the world increasingly finds itself in a difficult, unsustainable situation as a result of rapid globalization, both in terms of environmental issues, [[poverty]] and unequal distribution, as well as the disproportionate cultural balance, on 16 May 2003 representatives from 16 [[civil society]] organizations revived the original idea for a global Marshall Plan as a movement for [[world peace]], [[sustainability]] and [[justice]], and at the Frankfurt airport, the Global Marshall Plan initiative was launched. Since the initiative should be organized as a network, i.e. locally and without hierarchies, the coordination of tasks and activities was assigned to different people and institutions: the coordination of content was taken up by Prof. Dr. Franz-Josef Radermacher as Head of FAW/n, politicians, and Josef Riegler, with particular importance on an EU level and the Eco-Social Forum Europe. The coordination, initiation and promotion of supporters’ activities internationally were assigned the Global Contract Foundation and Frithjof Finkbeiner. Due to the enormous positive response and the wide range of activities, this commission was soon transferred to the Global Marshall Plan Foundation.

The long-term goal of the initiative is to establish a global eco-social market economy and alter the current failing global framework to lead to long-lasting peace and [[sustainability]]. From the beginning, the founders set themselves the goal to develop the initiative as openly as possible and also to win over the support of the economy. All actors and parts of the global society should find that in the Global Marshall Plan one-sided organization can constructively be prevented. The initiative aims to provide the great possible support to the world to ensure that plan is continually developed in its substance, quality, implementation and coverage.

In a series of lectures in 2003-4, the initiative was refined further and eventually the first report on the Global Marshall Plan Initiative (“Global Marshall Plan – A Planetary Contract for a global Eco-Social Market Economy) was compiled to be published in September 2004.

In the meantime, more and more members of the [[European Parliament]] and national parliaments began to back the initiative. Soon organizations from the civil society and the economy followed, as well as the first university. The initiative was also received very well internationally. The initiative has grown into a network made up of over 5000 individual supporters, organizations as well as numerous federal states and communities.

Believing that change will come from the centre of society, supporters raise awareness of the issues surrounding globalization and motivate those around them for the implementation of fair globalization. Lectures are an essential part of spreading the word. By raising awareness and informing, alliances are formed and pressure is created from “[[Business development|bottom-up]]”. Those motivated are trained through multiplier training in Global Marshall Plan Academies.

== Self-understanding ==
Material prosperity of mankind has never before experienced such an increase. Nevertheless poverty, deprivation and the resulting illnesses are still alarmingly widespread. The increasing overexploitation of nature, wasted limited [[resources]] and expected catastrophic climate consequences linked to [[pollution]] will present mankind in the next 30 years with their biggest challenge yet.

Unsustainable consumption of developing countries, poverty and [[population growth]] are among the key problems. Many hundreds of millions of people do not benefit from the positive effects of ongoing globalization, which has further increased the income gap between rich industrial nations and the poorest developing countries. The spread of [[AIDS]] and looming population growth also accelerate this.

Any effort to overcome this unsustainable development will be four times more difficult in the future, or even impossible, if a fundamental turnaround is not set in place soon.

The Global Marshall Plan Initiative wants to strengthen these turnarounds. With the self-understanding of a network-style movement for a World in Balance, positively aligned powers from politics, economics, science and civil society are brought together in a wide alliance based on the key requirements of fair globalization. This relies on the simultaneous pursuit of “bottom-up” and “top-down” approach, thus raising awareness and lobbying.

Through lectures, information events and publications, more people and groups are continually informed about the absolute necessity and the possibility of a global Eco-Social framework, so that political change comes from the centre of society. At the same time, support for the Global Marshall Plan and a global Eco-Social Market Economy is acquired from national, European and international decision makers through a direct approach.

== Goals  ==
The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to make a substantial contribution to a global eco-social market economy. This eco-social Marshall Plan would include realistic perspectives:

* to overcome the degrading poverty of half of mankind, which long has been identified as chief cause of the existing world problems
* to successfully establish global ecological and social standards for a [[sustainable development]]
* to overcome the deep cultural frustration and humiliation experienced by the majority of the world’s civilization and at the same time to eliminate the explosive environment that generates international [[terrorism]] and endangers global security
* for a new economic miracle which specifically boosts the human potential of more than three billion people (which until now has been laying absolutely idle). This would ultimately bring use to the whole human race
* to create fair globalisation
* and to accomplish [[human rights]] and human dignity for everyone.

According to the initiative, a Global Marshall Plan could also allow attractive new perspectives for many other problems caused by an unbalanced globalization. Possible impacts for example could be:

* The wealth and therefore the wages would increase in developing countries, so that the wage pressure in the economies of traditional industrialised countries will drop. The increased demand on the worlds market would also then contribute to a heightened job security in industrialised countries.
* An implementation of ecological goals would be far more realistic than is currently the case, since because poverty is, as the argument goes, one of the reasons for environmental damages in the poorest countries. Who would fight for daily survival, will be hardly convinced of environmental protection. In most parts of the world the implementation of ecological goals can only be realistic when they are directly linked to active promotion of social and ecological development.
* The model of an open, peaceful, democratic, constitutional and educated civil society, which many see as best guarantee for a good and dynamic future perspective, would be brought forward by the eco-social Marshall Plan.

The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to globally link appropriate order processes with competitive mechanisms to create value added systems by combining potential, resources and [[infrastructure]] with well planned, institutional solutions. A global eco-social market economy would therefore create the right balance between competitive economy, social solidarity and ecological sustainability.

== The logic of the plan ==
Central to the logic of a plan is the following basic principle, as introduced by the Global Marshall Plan Initiative:

[[Investments]], coordinated market openings and co-financing provide the harmonization that results in social and ecological standards. A form of targeted global overcoming of poverty should therefore emerge that will release especially strong new economic stimuli for the regions concerned, as well as for the whole global economy. By combining new growth with clear ecological standards at the same time a strong environmental approach to economic activities should be encouraged.

According to initiative, the new economic, ecological and social perspectives would have a strong impulse for the inner peace of the global community, which in turn is important for a lasting and sustained growth of economy.

It is also assumed that the positive effects of a Global Marshall Plan would also consequently increase the pull on governments, who so far have been averse to the eco-social movement. It would reinforce the pressure on these governments to give space for these developments, to reduce corruption and boost [[Good Governance]]. Good Governance signifies a well working guidance and control system of a political social unit as a state or a community. The principles often include terms such as transparency, efficiency, participation, responsibility, constitutional state, democracy and justice often belong to the principles.

Especially important is that the Global Marshall Plan overcomes old clashes of interests and that it achieves an unusually wide support.

One of the surprising intermediate results of the present process is that it is supported by commercial and industrial enterprises and their federations as well as severe critics of the previous form of globalisation and representatives from the “North” and “South”. Several well known representatives of all main political movements, all civil sectors and global acting networks of civil society argued vehemently for the initiative. The existing approaches and ideas of the initiative could open is a real prospect to bridge the wide social gap.

== Key requirements for a world in balance ==
Elements of the Global Marshall Plan, including the five interrelated building blocks of the plan, have already been mentioned in previous UN summits, European policy and demands from various [[NGO]]s and institutions. The five building blocks, which are continually adapted to the current challenges, form the starting point and at the same time the foundation of the initiative.

=== Further development and implementation of the UN Millennium Development Goals ===
In September 2000 the [[United Nations]] (UN) came together at the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] to discuss the most important challenges in the coming decade. In the final [[Millennium Declaration]], globalization was highlighted as one of the most important current issues.

In this declaration, the 192 [[UN member states]] committed themselves to the concrete [[Millennium Development Goals]], which should help to ensure everyone benefits from globalization.

The UN Millennium Development Goals represent the beliefs of the initiative – the first intermediate step towards fair world order and to sustainable development. It is unlikely that the goals will be achieved by 2015. Many problems have even worsened, highlighting a glaring failure of the international community. If anything, this should be all the more incentive to updates the goals and meet them promptly.

=== Achieving the 0.7% target and raising an additional necessary funds ===
A series of appropriate and necessary declarations and agreements (such as the above-mentioned Millennium Development Goals) have been only previously implemented to an extremely discouraging extent. If the apparent gap between declaration of intent and ability to act is not soon overcome, we are threatened with an escalation of global problems. Especially worrying is the looming crisis of confidence in decision-making processes on all levels and inability to enact policies in general.

The phase of understanding must therefore immediately be followed by a phase of decisive implementation. This involves not only the delivery mechanism (see 5.4) but also all questions of financing.

The financial means needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals lies, after an analysis from the UNO, at around US$50 billion per year plus some $20 billion for the provision of public goods and humanitarian missions. Considering the current situation significantly more resources are needed for development aid and the implementation of the MDGs. By enforcing the 0.7% GNP target, which the United Nations has been aiming at for decades, the means to finance [[development aid]] would be available.

In comparison:

The percentage volume of the US Marshall Plan after the Second World War was 1.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) of the USA – over a time period of 4 years.
 
Global military spending in 2004 amounted to around $1000 billion excluding the cost for the Iraq War. The Iraq War has already cost an additional several hundred billion US dollars.

These numbers illustrate that the proposed Global Marshall Plan on the stated level is by all means financeable.

=== Fair taxation on the global value-added processes ===
As well as market openings and new delivery mechanisms, global development also requires the above-mentioned financial means for international cooperation. Despite the principal way of using national budgets to provide the necessary funds, it would be easier, from a fundamental and procedural point of view, to find another way to allocate these funds.

On the one hand, national budgets are not directly charged, but on the other hand, the generated funds could be better separated from the national interests of donating countries, and it is easier to move forward together when everyone moves at the same pace. Since in the past self-contained national interests have repeatedly affected the efficiency of measures for development cooperation and consequently the public reputation of such programs has significantly decreased. An improvement in finding new means of financing could prove critical both politically as well as for the public acceptance of a Global Marshall Plan.

Therefore, the initiative urges that for regulatory reasons, due to improved governance action, for increased transparency, and in particular for better controls on the world finance sectors, tax on global value-added processes and the use of Global Commons must be systematically established. Examples of these include a global [[financial transactions tax]], the trade with CO2 emissions allowances in context of [[climate justice]] and a kerosene tax. The following are some examples:

==== Financial transactions tax ====
Another proposal to finance a Global Marshall Plan, which also has support from numerous experts, is a tax on global financial transactions. The [[financial transaction tax]] (FTT) is currently on the verge of a breakthrough in the [[European Union|EU]].

Critics of this idea are concerned that as a result of the tax, the “[[collective intelligence]]” in control of highly sensitive financial flows would be charged. On the contrary, in the recent excesses and “bubbles” of international capital, financial markets and the [[New Economy]], this intelligence has proved to be not all that far reaching. However it is in any case only a cautious use of these instruments and this suggested only on a global level.

A cautious start could be, for example, a global financial transaction tax of initially 0.01% If this proves to be positive, the value could be increased to 0.02%. With this, $30–40 billion could be raised each year.

However it must be acknowledged that such a global tax would require the establishment of new international structures that would possess the necessary authority as well as the effective sanctions.

==== Other considerations ====
In addition to the two presented financing options, the establishment of a Global Climate Certificate System (GCCS), a Future Bond, an [[International Finance Facility]] and a Kerosene Tax are also being discussed.

Other important considerations include the debt of development countries, closing offshore tax havens, which deprive national tax systems of some $50 billion every year, dismantling protectionist structures as well as discussions on an international cartel authority.

=== Fair, global partnerships and effective appropriation of funds ===
A fair partnership in development assistance on all levels and an adequate cash flow are the requirements for a sustainable future perspective for the entire world. Promoting Good Governance, subsidiaries, rationality, education, combating corruption, as well as an appropriation of funds, coordinated and directed at a grass-roots level, are considered crucial for self-regulated development (e.g. micro-financing).

To be able to develop the desired effect and gain broad and sustained support of global civil society but also to find the economy and politics, earlier mistakes in development cooperation must be avoided in the implementation of the Global Marshall Plan.

The overcoming of global [[market fundamentalism]] and the realization of a global eco-social market economy should be made possible by establishing a better framework for the global economy in a fair global agreement. The most appropriate way appears to primarily be the relationship between ethic, economic, ecological, social, cultural and democratic standards with such a programme.

The standards and codes of practice are related to (co)financing programmes. The allocation of funds must not be influenced through short-term economic interests of rich countries or through short-term power interests of elites in poor countries. This can best be achieved through a consistent focus on the mentioned standards, an associated accountability, an active and transparent involvement of industry and the organisation of civil society.

The first phase of the Global Marshall Plan seeks for the application of the following standards which have already been agreed on by UN member states:

Basic economic, social and cultural human rights, which are largely congruent with the core standards of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), such as organisational rights, [[gender equality]], prohibition of [[child labour]] etc.

Standards of international environmental and conservation agreements such as the Convention on Bio-diversity, [[CITES]] (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or the Washington Convention) and the [[Kyoto Protocol]].
 
Ignoring some of these standards represents, in many areas, the most important competitive economic advantages for less developed countries. The example of EU enlargement shows however that agreements on the application of common high standards and protection levels can be achieved, if accompanied by a co-financing of the development of weaker partners by developed countries is ensured. This coupling is profitable for all involved.

Previously the most effective ways of enforcing standards on a global level were held by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). However the organisation has received criticism like hardly any other. This is mainly because, in accordance with their mandate, they primarily promote the reduction of trade barriers and in doing so, discounts ecological, social and cultural aspects.

In the long-term, however, the WTO could still be reformed into a sustainable institution with trade regulations associated with the above-mentioned standards towards a fair, balanced and sustainability-oriented economic system. This should provide all elements of the prospective framework for non-compliance with the same legal action and sanction options. The equality of trade, environmental and social standards through a link with the WTO is one of the central concerns of the initiative.

Alternative considerations concerning the enforceability of ecological and social standards focus on strengthening a reformed UN and more efficient means of enforcing social standards within the ILO or human rights.

Every level, from the individual and local, to the national and global, has its own, essential function in a globalised world. One accomplishment of the tasks according to the principle of subsidiarity (principle that states matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest or least centralized competent authority) is essential for an efficient implementation of a Global Marshall Plan and requires a lot of changes, since the political decision-making structures of today are still far from fulfilling the needs of the growing world society.

Knowledge transfers, empowerment, investments directed at education and health must be central to the effort. Important aspects to achieve a reasonable regulatory framework and a self-regulated development include:

* Fair cooperation based on partnerships on all levels
* Strengthening of decision-making and organisation opportunities for partner countries
* Promoting Good Governance and fighting corruption
* Appropriation of funds, coordinated and directed at a grass-roots level, e.g. micro-credit
* and adequate funding

The ideology that the luck is on the side of the fittest, thus essentially stating that poverty is caused by itself, dismisses the many dimensions of poverty and neglects its causes which lie not finally in the unequal property and power structures that have maintained poverty and dependence for centuries.

A worldwide expansion of “Western” development and suppressing our unsustainable, undesirable development does not lead to worldwide wealth in any way, but to cultural impoverishment as well as the destruction of our natural resources.

==== From development aid to development cooperation ====
The arrogance of the Western civilisation, which is perceived by people as humiliating, degrading and threatening, provokes anti-Western sentiment and provides the breeding ground for hate and violence. There are also unfairly distributed opportunities and a lack of balance of interests.

Combating the misery in the world is not just a handout, but humanitarian duty and peace policy is also in our best interests. These days widespread human security can not be achieved when we’re against one another, only when we’re with one another. In addition it is necessary to build mutual trust, to accept those in disadvantaged countries as equal partners and to allow contributions from international negotiation and decision-making processes.

==== Application of funds ====
Given the above considerations, the Global Marshall Plan Initiative sees the following principles and suggestions for the application of funds as particularly noteworthy:

* The specific development programmes should be coordinated by the appropriated specialized organisations and programmes of the United Nations. The role of the United Nations must be strengthened.
* The example of the already established financing organisation “[[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]]” should be observed to see whether establishing such financing organisation in the UN’s own interaction with the economy and civil society is helpful to the key objectives of the Global Marshall Plan.
* Provided that funds are acquired from world trade tax, it would be worth considering investing this initially into development goals in every economic sector so that income accumulated in these sectors would increase agreement from the economy.
* An essential tool in the application of funds should be the public tender of proposed programmes from NGOs to maintain the best cost-income ratio in healthier competition.
* Projects should have clear priority, which are based on entrepreneurial potential of local people – for example small credit banks and development schools where locals are trained by aid workers.
* In technology transfers, the choice of promoted projects should be orientated above all towards those that teach largest possible number of locals the skills, so they are able to cope on their own as quickly and efficiently as possible.

The search for particularly successful, socially efficient and ecological projects and those success criteria should be defined and promoted as new international research priority. In this way the efficiency of many current forms of development assistance could be substantially increased.

=== Framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy: a global Eco-Social Market Economy ===
With the gradual implementation of a global Eco-Social Market Economy, a framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy will be established and the global market fundamentalism will be overcome. Functioning Global Governance structures need to reform existing institutions and policies (e.g. United Nations, World Trade Organization and World Finance Sector), as well as their coherent linkup to create a functioning whole.

== Next stages ==
Currently the initiative for a Global Marshall Plan is supported by more than 5000 individuals, 200 organisations, all Austrian federal states as well as some German states and prominent public figures. In many European and non-European countries the first national and regional structures have been established. From the 19–20 April 2008 representatives from numerous local and regional groups from Germany met in Erfurt to discuss establishing a national initiative with the purpose of a new governance structure of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative. As a result, an Erfurt Declaration was accepted, which expresses the will to establish an umbrella organisation to house the local, regional and national groups. As to not contract initiative’s own understanding of its network-like character and open design, the establishment of a national organisation has recently been abandoned. People can belong to numerous organisations, get involved in local groups informally or organize a club. There should not be a national organisation or governing body.

As an international initiative, the goals are strategic: implementing a Global Marshall Plan and developing a broad public awareness of globally responsible action. Only an increased awareness and an improved understanding can be a reliable basis to lead the initiative to become better known and to create fairer globalization.

The Global Marshall Plan Initiative addresses this with their ideas and suggestions aimed at different audiences:

* To all people in the world to contribute to the initiative with their knowledge, experiences and ideas
* To religious organisations as well as the media and artists to spread the ideas of the Global Marshall plan and create awareness
* To interested groups as well as in NGO organised civil societies. The goal is to join forces and fight for a fair, sustainable globalization together.
* To science. All disciplines are invited to help to develop the Global Marshall Plan with detailed and interdisciplinary established projects.
* To the economy to make the Global Marshall Plan one its own concerns to create a socially fair and ecologically responsible economic development
* To governments and parliaments of nation states to officially support the Global Marshall Plan and to develop it through discussion with other actors. This new quality of global action and problem-solving ability lies in the long-term interests of all countries.
* To the [[European Union]] as an important bearer of hope for the project and for many people in the entire world. The EU member states are faced with the historical opportunity to make the transition from former colonial powers to partners of efficient and comprehensively understood development policies. The EU can and should courageously develop an alternative to current forms of globalisation and consistently advocate them in international negotiations.
* To the UN and its programmes and specialized organisations that play a central role in the implementation of these projects. Initiatives to reform the UN in the direction of greater efficiency, competency and funding are supported by the initiative.
* To the [[G8]] to place combating poverty not as short-term measures such as aid and debt relief in the foreground, but to fight structural poverty through a reform of global regulations and institution at their roots.

Shortly after establishing the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, Karolin and Frithjof Finkbeiner founded the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. From them on, the foundation took over from the duties originally assigned to the Global Contract Foundation of an international coordination office of the initiative. Since the foundation has acted as secretariat for the initiative, taking care of the proper application of logos, networking actors and promoting many innovative projects with the help of numerous supporters. Alongside the support of the children’s initiative [[Plant-for-the-Planet]], which is active in more than 193 countries, it is possible to organize more international conferences, as for example the Commons Forum, and train around 40 participants through the multiplier training of the Global Marshall Plan Academy that take places yearly.

Some of the more than 200 organizations that support the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, set up a coordination circle for the initiative in December 2010 in Munich and took over the political and content related duties that had until then been shared out between others. The coordination circle develops strategic and content positions of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, decides which projects to support, works on further development of content and is responsible for the yearly initiative meeting. Since November 2011 members have busied themselves with the development of a list of demands for the financial crisis. The current paper can be downloaded from the initiative’s website.

The current projects of the initiative are the University Days: Eco-Social Market Economy and Sustainability, a collaborative project between the initiative and 5 other organizations, as well as other multiplier training through the internationalisation and offer of other formats within the Global Marshall Plan Academy. Both projects are supported by the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. The foundation of one of three project offices finances the University Days, for the Global Marshall Plan the organizational administration. The support and maintenance of local activities through the coordination office, the coordination and communication of speakers and lecturers are additional important component of the commitment of the initiative.

=== Supporters ===
Supporters of the initiative include [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]], Hubert Weinzierl (BUND), [[Rita Süssmuth]], Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker, Franz Josef Radermacher, [[Jakob von Uexküll]], Ulrich Martin Drescher, Renée Ernst, [[Sandra Maischberger]] (all from Germany), Josef Riegler, [[Franz Fischler]] (Austria), Prince El Hassan bin Talal (Jordan), [[Vandana Shiva]] (India), [[Jane Goodall]] (UK) and approximately 5000 supporters from Germany and Austria.

The supporting organisations include the [[Club of Rome]], the Eco-Social Europe, the German Federal Association of Economic Development and Foreign Economic Affairs, [[AIESEC]] Germany and Austria, Cap Anamur/German Emergency Doctors, [[VENRO]] (umbrella organisation of development non-governmental organisations), UN Millennium Campaign Germany as well as all the federal states of Austria.

In January 2007 the state parliament of Thuringia became the first national parliament in Germany to commit the goals of the Global Marshall Plan. The parliament paper (Parliament paper 4/2658) also requested the Thuringia state government to support the development of a concrete package of measures for the implementation of the Global Marshall Plan and to raise awareness with prominent example projects and information events in Thuringia as well reporting on progress every three years in state parliament. Since November 2007 the city of Munich has also supported the Global Marshall Plan.

An up-to-date list of supports can be found on the Global Marshall Plan website.

== On a local level ==
Since Spring 2004, a year after the initiative was founded, the local and university groups were founded by supporters in numerous places. The members of these groups stand together for a World in Balance to support the goal of a fairer world. Again and again new like-minded people are brought together by getting involved in their area.

The members of predominantly German-speaking areas (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) as well as international operating local groups and individual contact points operate projects for raising awareness. Through bottom-up activities, supporters clear up to those around them topics such as the [[climate crisis]], global poverty and other inequalities to contribute actively towards the necessary changes. With the active announcement of the Global Marshall Plan the supporters understand as lobbying for the common goal – a World in Balance – and act from the centre of society, pressurizing politics and the economy.

The Global Marshall Plan University Group was brought to life in 2004 as the first local group. They already organised series of lectures with personalities such as nobel prize winner [[Muhammad Yunus]] and was an incentive and model for other local groups. Currently there are more than 33 contact points worldwide, 23 of which are in German speaking countries acting locally.

'''Global distillation''' or the '''grasshopper effect''' is the [[geochemistry|geochemical]] process by which certain chemicals, most notably [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs), are transported from warmer to colder regions of the [[Earth]], particularly the [[polar regions|poles]] and mountain tops. Global distillation explains why relatively high concentrations of POPs have been found in the [[Arctic]] environment and in the bodies of animals and people who live there, even though most of the chemicals have not been used in the region in appreciable amounts.&lt;ref name="UNEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/Repository/CHM-general/UNEP-POPS-CHM-GUID-RIDDING.English.PDF|title=Ridding the world of POPs: A guide to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants|date=April 2005 |publisher=[[United Nations Environment Programme]] |accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
The global distillation process can be understood using the same principles that explain [[distillation]]s used to make [[liquor]] or purify chemicals in a laboratory. In these processes, a substance is [[evaporation|vapourised]] at a relatively high temperature, and then the vapour travels to an area of lower temperature where it condenses. A similar phenomenon occurs on a global scale for certain chemicals. When these chemicals are released into [[the environment]], some evaporates when ambient temperatures are warm,  blows around on winds until temperatures are cooler, and then [[condensation]] occurs. Drops in temperature large enough to result in deposition can occur when chemicals are blown from warmer to cooler climates, or when seasons change.  The net effect is atmospheric transport from low to high [[latitude]] and [[altitude]]. Since global distillation is a relatively slow process that relies on successive evaporation/condensation cycles, it is only effective for [[volatility (chemistry)|semi-volatile]] chemicals that break down very slowly in the environment, like [[DDT]], [[polychlorinated biphenyls]], and [[lindane]].

==Effect of global distillation==
Several studies have measured the effect, usually by correlating the concentrations of a certain chemical in air, water, or biological specimens from various parts of the world with the latitude from which the samples were collected. For example, the levels of PCBs, [[hexachlorobenzene]], and lindane measured in water, lichens, and tree [[Bark (botany)|bark]] have been shown to be greater in higher latitudes.&lt;ref name="pmid7569923"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simonich SL, Hites RA |title=Global distribution of persistent organochlorine compounds |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=269 |issue=5232 |pages=1851–4 |date=September 1995 |pmid=7569923 |doi=10.1126/science.7569923}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The effect is also used to explain why certain [[pesticides]] are found in Arctic and high altitude samples even though there is no agricultural activity in these areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.nps.gov/air/Studies/air_toxics/docs/2008FinalReport/08_FactSheet_LoRes_smIm_letter.pdf|title=Western Airborne Contaminants Project - Results|last=|first=|date=2008|website=National Park Service Air Resources Division|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and why [[indigenous peoples]] of the Arctic have some of the highest [[body burden]]s of certain POPs ever measured. Recent studies conclude that for many pollutants slower degradation in colder temperatures is a more important factor in accounting for their accumulation in cold region than global distillation.&lt;ref&gt;Schenker, Scheringer, Hungerbühler: ''Do Persistent Organic Pollutants reach a thermodynamic equilibrium in the global environment?'' [[Environmental Science &amp; Technology]], 2014, {{doi|10.1021/es405545w}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fabio Bergamin: ''[https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2014/04/the-result-of-slow-degradation.html The result of slow degradation]'', ETH News, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helen Sofie Dohlmann''' (21 October 1870 – 27 May 1942?) was a Danish sculptor.

==Biography==
Dohlmann was born in [[Copenhagen]] in 1870. She studied with [[Paul Dubois (sculptor)|Paul Bartlee]] and [[Jean Antoine Injalbert]] in [[Paris]] and later with [[Stephan Sinding]] in Copenhagen. She also studied painting with [[Richard E. Miller|Richard Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gravsted.dk/person.php?navn=helendohlmann|title=Helen Dohlmann|language=Danish|website=kendtegravsteder.dk|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kunstmus.dk/pl/Kunstopgaver_Det_syv%C3%A5rige_barn__Vejen_Kunstmuseum_198.aspx|title=Helen Dohlmann (1870-1942): "Forladt”", 1904. Gips|language=Danish|publisher=Vejsen Kunstmuseum|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of her earliest works, ''Sorg, sarkofag med figur'', was exhibited at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in Paris where it received a ''Mention Honorable'' It was later exhibited at [[Charlottenborg Palace|Charlottenborg]] and in [[Munich]]. She participated in several competitions for public monuments in Denmark. Her works include a bust of hospital director H.V.S. Gredsted  at the former [[Copenhagen Municipal Hospital]], now part of [[University of Copenhagen]]'s [[City Campus (University of Copenhagen)|City Campus]].

She remained unmarried and is buried at Solbjerg Park Cemetery in [[Frederiksberg]].

'''"Keep Me Warm"''' (original Finnish title '''"Älä mene pois"''' - "Don't Go Away") was the [[Finland|Finnish]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974]], performed in [[English Language|English]] by [[Carita Holmström|Carita]].

The song was performed first on the night (preceding the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Olivia Newton-John]] with "[[Long Live Love (Olivia Newton-John song)|Long Live Love]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 4 points, placing 13th in a field of 17.

The song is sung from the perspective of a young woman asking a "friend" to stay with her and "keep me warm". She suggests that she can do the same for him, and there is a general implication that she wants there to be a relationship between the two of them.

It was succeeded as [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Finnish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975 Contest]] by [[Pihasoittajat]] with "[[Old Man Fiddle]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="923">'''Korpralskap''' is a [[Sweden|Swedish]]/[[Finland|Finnish]] military unit of 25 men split into four rote with six man each that existed during the 17th and 18th century—quite similar to a platoon today. The unit was led by a [[Korpral]] and in turn consisted of four rotes of six men each. Each rote was led by a rotemaster. 
A foot (infantry) company consisted of two [[Pike (weapon)|piker]] and four [[musketeer]] korpralskaps.

==Formation==
During marching the unit was formed into four columns with the [[Korpral]] at the right side of the front. Rotemasters marched in front of each rote and communicated with the Korpral.

'''Mong Kok District''' ({{Zh|t=旺角區|y=Wohng Gok Kēui}}) was one of the [[districts of Hong Kong|districts]] of [[Hong Kong]], covering the areas of [[Mong Kok]] and [[Tai Kok Tsui]] in [[Kowloon]]. In 1994, the district was merged with [[Yau Tsim District]], which covered [[Tsim Sha Tsui]], [[Tsim Sha Tsui East]], [[Yau Ma Tei]], [[King's Park, Hong Kong|King's Park]] and [[Kwun Chung]]), to form [[Yau Tsim Mong District]].

Mong Kok District had one of the highest population densities in the world, as it once attained 130,000 people per square kilometre. As the district was smaller than 1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the actual population never reached the raw figure.  Mong Kok was the smallest district with the highest population density in Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

The aim of NOMESCO is as follows. 
To be responsible for the co-ordination of the health statistics in the Nordic countries.
To initiate new projects, partly to improve comparisons of statistics, and partly to ensure the most rational use of Nordic expert knowledge in the field.
To inform about Nordic statistical activities, mainly by publishing annual statistics as well as the results of special projects, surveys, etc.
To co-ordinate and take part in international statistical collaboration, including activities in the Baltic countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="958">'''Prince Henry's Battery''' was an artillery battery built in [[Gibraltar]] during the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1761–63)|Anglo-Spanish War of 1762–63]], adjoining the [[Prince of Wales Lines]]. They mounted three 32-pdr guns with two more 18-pdrs, six 12-pdrs and three 4-pdrs on the Lines. After 1841, the battery was rebuilt as a retired battery as part of a mid-19th century remodelling of Gibraltar's southern defences. They were eventually built over in 1859–60 when the [[Prince of Wales Batteries]] were constructed on the same site.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hughes|Hughes &amp; Migos]], p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;

His works are important sources for the history of [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Xinjiang]].&lt;ref&gt;Khālidī, Frank, Usmanov, ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Khālidī was born in [[Ayagoz]], Kazakhstan, to a [[Chala Kazakh]] family, though he referred to himself as a "Noghay" - a Volga-Ural Muslim, or [[Tatars|Tartar]],&lt;ref&gt;Khālidī, Frank, Usmanov, x.&lt;/ref&gt; as his father was a native of the [[Kazan]] area. His mother was a native of Ayagoz.&lt;ref name=k2&gt;Karmysheva, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied in several [[madrasa]]s, first in his hometown of Ayagoz, then in [[Semipalatinsk]], Lepsi, and [[Bukhara]]. By 1871 he attained the rank of [[imam]], and by 1874 was the imam of a [[mosque]] in [[Tacheng]].&lt;ref&gt;Khālidī, Frank, Usmanov, xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Khālidī's writings utilize several Turkic languages, including [[Tatar]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]], and vernacular [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]].&lt;ref name=k1/&gt; As such, studying and translating his works can be difficult for even experienced scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Khalidi, Frank, Usmanov, and Nathan Light.

'''Sky Cinema''' is a German set of movie channels owned by [[Sky Deutschland]].

The Sky Cinema package includes eleven Sky-branded channels:
*'''Sky Cinema''', the premium channel with 20 television premieres per month.
*'''Sky Cinema +1''', Sky Cinema with an hour delay.
*'''Sky Cinema +24''', Sky Cinema with 1 day delay.
*'''Sky Cinema Action''' with action, horror and sci-fi movies.
*'''Sky Cinema Comedy''' with various kinds of comedy movies.
*'''Sky Cinema Emotion''' with love stories, romantic comedies and dramas.
*'''Sky Cinema Nostalgie''' with classic movies from the 1930s to the 1970s.
*'''Sky Cinema Hits''' with blockbusters from all times.
*'''Sky Cinema HD''', '''Sky Cinema +1 HD''', '''Sky Cinema +24 HD''', '''Sky Cinema Hits HD''' and '''Sky Cinema Action HD''' with movies in high-definition.
Movies are broadcast in the 16:9 widescreen format with both German and original audio, when available.
In order to watch movies in high-definition, you also have to pay for '''Sky HD''', another set of programs. By booking this set, the channels fitting into the other booked sets, such as '''Sky Sport''' are decrypted as well.

==History==
===Origins===
The different channels in the package mostly have their origins in the analogue Premiere channel which started broadcasting in 1991 and the movie channels of the [[DF1]] platform started in 1996. The movie package on the DF1 platform consisted of ''Cine Action'', ''Cine Comedy'', ''Romantic Movies'', ''Star*Kino'' and ''Western Movies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.df1.de/pakete/moviestart.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970716210316/http://www.df1.de/pakete/moviestart.htm|title=Die DF1 Moviekanäle|archivedate=16 July 1997|publisher=DF1|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When DF1 and Premiere merged to form the platform "Premiere World" in October 1999, it movie package, which was called "Movie World", consisted of the ''Premiere'' channel and ''[[13th Street]]'' as well as the former DF1 channels ''Star*Kino'', ''Cine Action'', ''Cine Comedy'', ''Sci Fantasy'' and ''Romantic Movies'' while '' Western Movies'' closed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiereworld.de/presse/news/archiv/archive/08_20_99.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010717104543/http://www.premiereworld.de/presse/news/archiv/archive/08_20_99.asp|archivedate=17 July 2001|title=PREMIERE WORLD setzt mit Programm und Präsentation neue Maßstäbe für das digitale Fernsehen|date=20 August 1999|publisher=Premiere World|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This structure remained until July 2001 when Premiere World relaunched their packages and brought all the channels they owned under the Premiere umbrella brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvb-online.de/premiere/premiere.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510161954/http://www.dvb-online.de/premiere/premiere.htm |archivedate=10 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Premiere'' was extended to three channels: ''Premiere 1'', ''Premiere 2'' and ''Premiere 3''
*''Star*Kino'' renamed ''Premiere Star''
*''Cine Comedy'' renamed ''Premiere Comedy''
*''Sci Fantasy'' renamed ''Premiere Sci-fi''
*''Cine Action'' renamed ''Premiere Action''
*''Romantic Movies'' was closed down and replaced with ''Premiere Action-X'', a sister channel of ''Premiere Action''

In May 2002, "Premiere World" became simply "Premiere". At the same time, the themed movie channel were replaced by the numbered movie screens ''Premiere 4'' through ''Premiere 7'' while ''Premiere Action-X'' closed.

On 1 August 2006, the channels were overhauled again. ''Premiere 1'' to ''Premiere 4'' became part of a package called "Premiere Blockbuster", which also included [[Disney Channel Germany|Disney Channel]]. ''Premiere 5'', ''Premiere 6'' and ''Premiere 7'' were closed down and replaced by ''Premiere Filmclassics'' and ''Premiere Filmfest''. They became part of a package called "Premiere Entertainment", which also included [[Premiere Serie]], [[Premiere Krimi]] and [[Premiere Nostalgie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://info.sky.de/inhalt/de/medienzentrum_news_uk_20062006_angebot.jsp|title=Premiere ab 1. August mit neuen Preisen und Angeboten: Premium-Abonnements bereits ab 9,99 Euro pro Monat|date=20 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Premiere Blockbuster" and "Premiere Entertainment" merged and became "Premiere Film" in on 1 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2008/05/15/premiere-simplifies-package-structure/|title=Premiere simplifies package structure|date=15 May 2008|publisher=broadbandtvnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 relaunch===
On 4 July 2009, Premiere was relaunched and became Sky Deutschland. All Premiere channels were renamed. The movie channels got the following names:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sky.de/web/cms/de/kundencenter_news_neuesender.jsp|title=Neue Sender und Sendernamen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Premiere 1'' splited to two channels: ''Sky Cinema'' and ''Sky Action''
*''Premiere 2'' became ''Sky Cinema +1''
*''Premiere 3'' became ''Sky Cinema +24''
*''Premiere 4'' became ''Sky Comedy''
*''Premiere Filmclassics'' became ''Sky Cinema Hits'', now "Sky Hits"
*''Premiere Filmfest'' became ''Sky Emotion''
*''Premiere Nostalgie'' became ''Sky Nostalgie''

The Premiere Film channels were sold with [[Disney Channel Germany|Disney Channel]] and [[Fox Channel (Germany)|Fox Channel]]. When Sky was relaunched, those two channels were moved to the Sky Welt package, while the [[MGM (TV channel)|MGM Channel]] and [[Disney Cinemagic]] took their place. [[Premiere Krimi]] was moved to the Sky Welt package and became [[Sky Krimi]].

With the relaunch, the channels adopted the searchlights-themed graphics, used by the British [[Sky Movies]] channels since 2007, with the logos replaced by those of German counterparts. Sky Cinema uses Sky Movies Premiere's ident, while Sky Action uses Sky Movies Action &amp; Thriller's, Sky Emotion uses Sky Movies Drama's, Sky Nostalgie uses Sky Movies Classics', Sky Comedy uses Sky Movies Indie's (not the Sky Movies Comedy's), and Sky Cinema Hits uses the original idents of Sky Movies HD 1 and 2.

When the channels where rebranded, there was only one high-definition simulcast channel, Sky Cinema HD. It was joined by two more HD simulcasts on 13 August 2010, Sky Cinema Hits HD and Sky Action HD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/201007147078/sky-deutschland-expands-hd-offer.html|title=Sky Deutschland expands HD offer|date=14 July 2010|publisher=RapidTVNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Swissinfo headquarters.jpg|thumb|The swissinfo.ch building in Bern.]]

'''SWI swissinfo.ch''' is a ten-language news and information platform produced by the [[Swiss Broadcasting Corporation]]. Its content is Swiss-centred, with top priority given to in-depth information on politics, the economy, the arts, science, education and direct democracy. Switzerland's international political, economic and cultural relations are other key points of focus. The website has ten language versions (German, French, Italian, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, Chinese and Japanese).

== History ==
In the mid-1990s, economic circumstances forced swissinfo.ch to take a new strategic direction. The internet was advancing fast, heralding a new era for the producing journalists and the Swiss Radio International (SRI) audience alike. The German, French, English and Portuguese sites went online in 1999. The Italian, Japanese and Spanish sites followed in 2000, with Arabic going live on 1 February 2001 and Chinese in September of the same year. Within just two years, the internet platform for expatriate Swiss was already better known than SRI's short-wave radio services.

On 21 March 2005, the Board of Directors of SRG SSR decided to reduce the swissinfo.ch service significantly. At the time, the decision was not final and still had to be confirmed by the regulatory body – the Federal Office of Communications – and the [[Swiss Federal Council]]. That decision was expected in the autumn of 2005. SRG SSR's intention to cut swissinfo.ch back to a minimum triggered an enormous response from users and readers. There was widespread lack of understanding for the move. The SRG SSR plan for the future was to produce a reduced service in English only. This service was to be integrated into SR DRS. Only specific information for Swiss people living abroad would be provided in Switzerland's national languages. One journalist would be responsible for each language, and the service would be produced by one of the existing SRG SSR enterprise units. In the end, the public had their way. In the summer of 2007, the Federal Council issued swissinfo.ch with a new charter to provide a specific and clearly defined internet-focused news, information and entertainment service.

Peter Schibli became the new editor-in-chief of swissinfo.ch on 1 January 2008. Schibli, who holds a doctorate in law, succeeds Christoph Heri, who retired on 31 March 2008 after a 30-year media career, the last six years of which were spent with the swissinfo.ch editorial team. The new editor-in-chief is charged with fulfilling the content aspects of the Federal Council charter and with positioning swissinfo.ch as a leading nine-language news and information platform for both expatriate Swiss and an international audience with an interest in Switzerland. In November 2008, Schibli became the director of swissinfo.ch. The new editor-in-chief Christophe Giovannini worked for swissinfo.ch from November 2008 until February 2015. In 2013, swissinfo.ch welcomed Russian as 10th language of the information platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=swissinfo.ch - ab 2013 auch auf Russisch|url=http://www.presseportal.ch/fr/pm/100001296/100718591?langid=1?langid=1|website=Presseportal|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, Larissa M. Bieler started as the new editor-in-chief. Today more than 100 persons from 14 nations are working for swissinfo.ch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Annual report SWI swissinfo.ch|url=http://www.annualreportswissinfo.ch|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special features ==
swissinfo.ch's themed dossiers offer a high-quality complement to its websites. Produced specifically for an international audience, these multimedia dossiers examine and present current issues in detail. There is also a special section for expatriate Swiss that gives information on forthcoming referenda and elections. swissinfo.ch is also active on different social media channels: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc.

== Services ==
In addition to the websites, information can be called up from or downloaded to mobile devices. The headline service automatically updates computer desktop headlines from the swissinfo.ch homepages. Headlines can also be linked via live news feeds directly to other websites. In March 2017 swissinfo.ch launched a new app (for iOS and Android).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Out now: the new swissinfo.ch app|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/time-to-download_out-now--the-new-swissinfo-ch-app/42969018|website=swissinfo.ch|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bengalis}} 
'''United Bengal''' is a political ideology for a unified [[Bengali language|Bengali-speaking]] nation in [[South Asia]]. The ideology developed among [[Bengali nationalism|Bengali nationalists]]  after the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|first partition of Bengal]] in 1905. The [[British Raj|British]]-ruled [[Bengal Presidency]] was divided into [[Western Bengal]] and [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] to weaken the [[Bengali nationalism|independence movement]]; after much protest Bengal was reunited in 1911.

The United Bengal proposal was the bid made by the [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[Prime Minister of Bengal|Prime Minister]] [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]] and nationalist leader [[Sarat Chandra Bose]] to found a united and independent nation-state of [[Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Christophe Jaffrelot|title=A History of Pakistan and Its Origins|date=2004|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=9781843311492|page=42|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Q9sI_Y2CKAcC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=sarat+Shaheed+Suhrawardy+plan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NsbKDgrCEj&amp;sig=pdqbZUm6AkmTUiWik6EjIXd7tfs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4amyVI3eIMLkuQT5v4KQBg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sarat%20Shaheed%20Suhrawardy%20plan&amp;f=false|ref=scb1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scb2&gt;{{cite web|title=Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy : His Life|url=http://thedailynewnation.com/news/34685/huseyn-shaheed-suhrawardy--his-life.html|website=thedailynewnation.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was floated as an alternative to the [[1947 Partition of Bengal|partition of Bengal]] on [[Communalism|communal]] lines. The initiative failed owing to [[British diplomacy]] and communal conflict between [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] that eventually led to the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|second partition of Bengal]].

==History==
As the Hindu-Muslim conflict escalated and the demand for a separate Muslim state of [[Pakistan]] became popular among Indian Muslims, the partition of India on communal lines was deemed inevitable by mid-1947. To prevent the inclusion of Hindu-majority districts of [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] in a Muslim [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]], the [[Indian National Congress]] and the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] sought the partition of these provinces on communal lines.
Bengali nationalists such as [[Sarat Chandra Bose]], [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]], Kiran Shankar Roy, [[Abul Hashim]], Satya Ranjan Bakshi and [[Fazlul Qadir Chaudhry]] sought to counter partition proposals with the demand for a united and independent state of Bengal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kabir|first1=Nurul|title=Colonialism, politics of language  and partition of Bengal PART XVI|url=https://sites.google.com/site/bdguiber/home/6-english/bangladesh/colonialism-politics|accessdate=14 August 2016|work=The New Age|publisher=The New Age|date=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press statement on 27 April 1947  [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]] said:

{{quote|text=Let us pause for a moment to consider what Bengal can be if it remains united. It will be a great country, indeed the richest and the most prosperous in India capable of giving to its people a high standard of living, where a great people will be able to rise to the fullest height of their stature, a land that will truly be plentiful. It will be rich in agriculture, rich in industry and commerce and in course of time it will be one of the powerful and progressive states of the world. If Bengal remains united this will be no dream, no fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text of Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy’s Press Statement in 27 April 1947 ( United Bengal )|url=http://www.bangladeshbd.org/historical-documents/text-of-huseyn-shaheed-suhrawardys-press-statement-in-27-april-1947-united-bengal/|website=BangladeshBD.org|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Ideological visions for a “Greater Bengal” included the regions of [[Northeast India]]. Suhrawardy and Bose sought the formation of a coalition government between the Bengali [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] and the [[Bengal Provincial Muslim League]]. Proponents of the plan urged the masses to reject communal divisions and uphold the vision of a united Bengal. In a press conference held in [[Delhi]] on April 27, 1947, Suhrawardy presented his plan for a united and independent Bengal and Abul Hashim issued a similar statement in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] on April 29. A few days later, Sarat Chandra Bose put forward his proposals for a "Sovereign Socialist Republic of Bengal."
[[File:Map of Bengal.svg|thumb|East Bengal and West Bengal.]] [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], the President of the [[All-India Muslim League]] and later Founding Father of [[Pakistan]], showed his support for the proposal along with [[Mahatma Gandhi]], but the [[Indian National Congress]] aggressively opposed it.

==Proposal==
With the support of the British governor of the Bengal province, [[Frederick Burrows]], Bengali leaders issued the formal proposal on May 20:

#Bengal would be a Free State. The Free State of Bengal would decide its relations with the rest of India.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Misra|first1=Chitta Ranjan|title=United Bengal Movement|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=United_Independent_Bengal_Movement|website=Banglapedia|publisher=Bangladesh Asiatic Society|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The Constitution of the Free State of Bengal would provide for election to the Bengal Legislature on the basis of a joint electorate and adult franchise, with reservation of seats proportionate to the population among Hindus and Muslims. The seats set aside for Hindus and Scheduled Caste Hindus would be distributed amongst them in proportion to their respective population, or in such manner as may be agreed among them. The constituencies would be multiple constituencies and the votes would be distributive and not cumulative. A candidate who got the majority of the votes of his own community cast during the elections and 25 percent of the votes of the other communities so cast, would be declared elected. If no candidate satisfied these conditions, that candidate who got the largest number of votes of his own community would be elected.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
#On the announcement by His Majesty's Government that the proposal of the Free State of Bengal had been accepted and that Bengal would not be partitioned, the present Bengal Ministry would be dissolved. A new interim Ministry would be brought into being, consisting of an equal number of Muslims and Hindus (including Scheduled Caste Hindus) but excluding the Chief Minister. In this Ministry, Chief Minister would be a Muslim and the Home Minister a Hindu.
#Pending the final emergence of a Legislature and a Ministry under the new constitutions, Hindus (including Scheduled Caste Hindus) and Muslims would have an equal share in the Services, including military and police. The Services would be manned by [[Bengalis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
#A Constituent Assembly composed of 30 persons, 16 Muslims and 14 non-Muslims, would be elected by Muslim and non-Muslim members of the Legislature respectively, excluding Europeans.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Failure==
The proposal made no mention of Bengal's status in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] if it were to become independent or whether it would accept [[dominion]] status as was done later with the [[Union of India]], the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] and [[Ceylon]] or sever all ties with the United Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Opposition===
On May 12, 1947 [[Abul Hashim]] and [[Sarat Chandra Bose|Sarat Bose]] met [[Mahatma Gandhi]] to discuss the United Bengal scheme and received his blessings. However, the day afterward, on May 13, 1947, the president of the Indian National Congress, [[J. B. Kripalani|JB Kripalini]], dismissed any notions to "save the unity of Bengal". In reply to the plea, made by [[Ashrafuddin Chowdhury]], a Muslim [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[peasant]] leader from [[Tippera]], Kripalini wrote: "All that the Congress seeks to do today is to rescue as many areas as possible from the threatened domination of the League and Pakistan. It wants to save as much territory for a Free Indian Union as is possible under the circumstances. It therefore insists upon the division of Bengal and [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] into areas for [[India|Hindustan]] and [[Pakistan]] respectively".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://sites.google.com/site/bdguiber/home/6-english/bangladesh/colonialism-politics|title=Agrarian Bengal: Economy, Social Structure and Politics: 1919-1947|last=Bose|first=Sugata|publisher=Cambridge University Press, First Indian Edition in association with Orient Longman,|year=1987|isbn=|location=[[Hyderabad]]|pages=230–231|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and the Congress issued statements rejecting the notion of an independent Bengal on May 28 {{dubious|date=September 2014}} and June 1 respectively. The [[Communist Party of India|communists]] also rejected such notions&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mukhopadhay|first1=Keshob|title=An interview with prof.

When the Congress agreed to the partition of [[Punjab]], the [[Hindu Mahasabha]], fearing a Muslim majority, dropped its aspirations for a [[Akhand Bharat|United India]] and started to oppose the notion of independent Bengal fierecely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bandyopadhyay |first=Sekhar |year=2009|url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=9Qd5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=COngress+and+Hindus+opposed+United+Bengal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xmyDXXH7iR&amp;sig=h86RPa9wtAjE5Yl06RONteIoxIM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=COngress%20and%20Hindus%20opposed%20United%20Bengal&amp;f=false

With aggravating Hindu-Muslim tensions and the opposition of the Congress and Muslim League leadership, on June 3 British [[Viceroy of India|viceroy]] [[Lord Louis Mountbatten]] announced plans to partition India and consequently Punjab and Bengal on communal lines, burying the demand for an independent Bengal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 2016, [[Madhuri Bose]], niece of [[Sarat Chandra Bose|Sarat]] and [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] claimed in her book [[''The Bose Brothers"]], [[Sarat Chandra Bose|Sarat Bose]] held the Congress more responsible of the failure of the idea than the Muslim League since Jinnah was a supporter of the proposal.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bdnews24.com/neighbours/2016/01/28/book-by-madhuri-bose-throws-new-light-on-united-bengal-plan|title=Book by Madhuri Bose throws new light on 'United Bengal' plan|last=|first=|date=28 January 2016|work=|publisher=BDNews24.com|newspaper=BDNews24.com|access-date=29 April 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
