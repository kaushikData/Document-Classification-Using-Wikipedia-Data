The {{nihongo|'''Adachi Museum of Art'''|足立美術館|Adachi Bijutsukan}} opened in [[Yasugi, Shimane|Yasugi]], [[Shimane Prefecture]], [[Japan]] in 1970. It houses a collection of modern [[Japanese art]], including paintings by [[Taikan Yokoyama]], and has a celebrated garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov-online.go.jp/pdf/hlj_img/vol_0022et/28-29.pdf |title=Japanese gardens and masterpiece paintings in beautiful harmony |publisher=[[Japan Tourism Agency]] |accessdate=31 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420050118/http://www.gov-online.go.jp/pdf/hlj_img/vol_0022et/28-29.pdf |archivedate=20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its 6 gardens and around 1,500 exhibits of Japanese paintings, pottery, and other works of art occupy the 165,000 square-meter area. Adachi Museum of Art earned the top rating of three stars in Michelin Green Guide Japan because of its elegance. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://planetyze.com/en/japan/shimane/adachi-museum-of-art|title=Adachi Museum of Art  - Shimane Travel Guide {{!}} Planetyze|website=Planetyze|language=en|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2675">'''Alfred Joseph Clements''' (1858 – 6 January 1938) was the Organiser and secretary of the [[Conway Hall Ethical Society|South Place]] 
Sunday Concerts in London for over 50 years, from 1887–1938.&lt;ref name="Conway Hall"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfred J.

In 1901, he was a printer, living with his wife Dora Mary Clements née Varian at 10 Leighton Crescent, Kentish Town, London.&lt;ref name="1901 census"&gt;{{cite web|title=1901 England Census|url=http://interactive.ancestry.co.uk/7814/LNDRG13_157_158-0308/2235749|work=1901 census|publisher=Ancestry.co.uk|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Clements died on 6 January 1938, he was living at 8 Finchley Way, Finchley London. Probate of his will was to his widow, Dora Mary Clements, and his effects totalled £995 10s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England &amp; Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858-1966|url=http://interactive.ancestry.co.uk/1904/31874_221782-00833/2175138|publisher=Ancestry.co.uk|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is commemorated by a gold inlaid relief plaque at [[Conway Hall]], London.  Both Clements and his wife are named in the Book of Remembrance in the Musicians’ Chapel at [[St Sepulchre-without-Newgate]].

A prize was established in his name. In 1947, this prize was won by [[Peter Racine Fricker]] for his Wind Quintet, which was first performed at Conway Hall on 27 February 1947 by the Brain Wind Ensemble, joined by [[George Malcolm (musician)|George Malcolm]], and first broadcast in 1949.&lt;ref name="GambleLynch2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Gamble|author2=William C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2596">'''Algorithmic mechanism design (AMD)''' lies at the intersection of economic [[game theory]] and [[computer science]].

[[Noam Nisan]] and Amir Ronen, from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], first coined "Algorithmic mechanism design" in a research paper published in 1999.&lt;ref name="nisan"&gt;{{citation
 | last1 = Nisan | first1 = Noam | author1-link = Noam Nisan

It combines ideas such as utility maximization and mechanism design from [[economics]], rationality and [[Nash equilibrium]]  from game theory, with such concepts as [[complexity]] and algorithm design from [[discrete mathematics]] and theoretical [[computer science]]. Examples of topics include networking,  [[peering]], online auctions and exchanges, online advertising, and search engine's page ranking.

Algorithmic mechanism design differs from classical economic mechanism design in several respects. It typically employs the analytic tools of [[theoretical computer science]], such as [[worst case analysis]] and [[approximation ratio]]s, in contrast to classical mechanism design in economics which often makes distributional assumptions about the agents. It also considers computational constraints to be of central importance: mechanisms that cannot be efficiently implemented in polynomial time are not considered to be viable solutions to a mechanism design problem. This often, for example, rules out the classic economic mechanism, the [[Vickrey–Clarke–Groves auction]].

[[File:Billy Whitlock.jpg|thumb|1846 illustration of Whitlock]]

'''William M. "Billy" Whitlock''' (1813&amp;ndash;1878) was an American [[blackface]] performer. He began his career in entertainment doing blackface [[banjo]] routines in [[circus]]es and [[dime show]]s, and by 1843, he was well known in New York City. He is best known for his role in forming the original [[minstrel show|minstrel]] troupe, the [[Virginia Minstrels]].

==Early career==

Whitlock was born in New York City in 1813. He worked as a [[typesetting|typesetter]] for a religious journal, then went to work for the ''[[New York Herald]]''. Whitlock claimed to have met America's pre-eminent [[banjo]]ist, [[Joel Sweeney]], in 1838 and to have taken some banjo lessons from him. He joined [[P. T. Barnum|P. T. Barnum's]] circus in 1839, where he began his blackface act.

By 1840, Whitlock was performing [[circus]]es, museums, and variety shows and had taken the epithet "King of Banjo players, and the Emperor of Extravaganza Singers".&lt;ref&gt;18 July 1840. Announcement from Vauxhall Gardens in the ''[[New York Morning Herald]]''. Quoted in Nathan 65.&lt;/ref&gt; He paired with [[John Diamond (blackface performer)|John Diamond]] for a time, playing [[banjo]] and singing while Diamond danced. Frank Lynch eventually replaced Diamond, though he took "Frank Diamond" as his stage name. Whitlock also partnered with Dan Gardner, who would dress in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] as Whitlock's character "Sambo Squash" made romantic overtures.

This playbill, written in the stereotyped [[African American Vernacular English]] that characterized blackface entertainment, describes Whitlock's basic act:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now dat Massa Whitlock plays so partic'lar combustious, and will sing dat 'fecting song of [[Jenny Get Your Hoe Cake Done|Jinny git your Hoe Cake done]]! and dat first rate ballad of [[Jim Along Josey]]! defying all de niggers in de world to charm de people after dat same manner. Dis very partic'lar nigga will jump, dance, and knock his heels in a way dat Mademoiselle [[Fanny Elssler]] neber did, neber can and neber will do.&lt;ref&gt;5 June 1840. Playbill, [[National Theatre, Boston (1836)|National Theatre, Boston]]. Quoted in Nathan 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many years later, Whitlock claimed that his Negro impersonations were based on reality. He would "quietly steal off to some negro hut to hear the darkeys sing and see them dance, taking with him a jug of whiskey to make them all the merrier."&lt;ref&gt;13 April 1878. ''[[New York Clipper]]''. Quoted in Emerson 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virginia Minstrels==

In early 1843, Whitlock became one of the founding members of the  [[Virginia Minstrels]]. Whitlock's version of the group's founding holds that Whitlock asked [[Musical styles (violin)#Fiddle|fiddler]] [[Dan Emmett]] to practice with him. They did so on a few occasions, but during one such session, [[Frank Brower]] dropped by unannounced and decided to join in on  [[bones (instrument)|bones]]. [[Richard Pelham]] soon followed with his [[tambourine]].&lt;ref&gt;13 April 1878. ''New York Clipper''. Quoted in Nathan 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virginia Minstrels put on a full [[minstrel show]] at the New York [[Bowery Amphitheatre]] on 6 February 1843. Whitlock was the most famous of the foursome,&lt;ref&gt;Nathan 115.&lt;/ref&gt; but soon all four names became well known as they toured New York and Boston. Whitlock's banjo was long-necked and four-stringed, though a fifth was added by 1844. He played the instrument by striking the strings with his fingernail.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitlock also did a "Locomotive Lecture", a predecessor to the [[stump speech (minstrelsy)|stump speech]], wherein he feigned a complete lack of knowledge about steam engines and the railroad. Whitlock wrote some music, as well; his "[[Miss Lucy Long]]" became a hit for both the Virginia Minstrels and [[Christy's Minstrels]].&lt;ref&gt;Emerson 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitlock and the troupe left for [[Liverpool]], England, on 21 April. They performed several minstrel shows in the British Isles, but they broke up after a performance on 14 July 1843, possibly due to low profits. Whitlock returned to New York City with the group's manager, [[George Wooldridge]].

==Later career==

Back in America, Whitlock returned to his circus blackface act. For a time, he joined [[T. G. Booth]], [[Cool White]], and [[Barney Williams]] as a member of the [[Kentucky Minstrels]].

On 28 July 1845, Whitlock joined Emmett, [[Bryant's Minstrels|Jerry Bryant]], Dan Gardner, and [[Charles "Charlie" White|Charles White]] to form the Operatic Brothers and Sisters. The group put on a week of outdoor performances in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]. On 23 October, he performed at a [[Benefit concert|benefit]] along with Emmett, Gardner, and other prominent blackface entertainers. His last public blackface performance was at a circus in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Stark 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burn the Floor''' is a live dance show which has performed around the world, including on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in New York City and the [[West End of London|West End]] in London. Since 1997, Burn the Floor has performed in over 130 countries worldwide. The show has also featured several alumni of various international versions of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' and ''[[So You Think You Can Dance]]''.

==Origin==
In 1997, [[Elton John]]'s 50th birthday party included a 10-minute performance from a group of [[ballroom dancers]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Pacheko Culture Monster, Elton" /&gt;--&gt; The birthday party is credited with starting the idea for Burn the Floor.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Pacheko Culture Monster, Elton" /&gt;--&gt; Following John's party, [[Australian]] producer Harley Medcalf spent two years developing the idea.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Pacheko Culture Monster, Elton" /&gt;--&gt; Medcalf brought a showcase of ballroom dance to an Elton John Aids fundraiser two years later.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Pacheko Culture Monster, Elton" /&gt;--&gt; Among the talent Medcalf recruited for his stage show included a choreographer, [[Anthony Van Laast]], and Australian ballroom dancers [[Jason Gilkison]] and Peta Roby.&lt;ref name="Pacheko Culture Monster, Elton"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pacheko|first1=Patrick|title=Culture Monster Post|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/08/elton-john-was-just-turning-50-when-burn-the-floor-the-dance-show-which-opens-at-the-longacre-theatre-today-began-its.html|accessdate=25 July 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2 August 2009|ref=Pacheko Culture Monster Elton}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, the show played a two night stint at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in [[New York City, United States of America|New York City]].&lt;ref name="Kisselgoff NY Times 2000 Review"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kisselgoff|first1=Anna|title=DANCE REVIEW; Arthur Murray Must Be Fox-Trotting in His Grave|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/07/movies/dance-review-arthur-murray-must-be-fox-trotting-in-his-grave.html|accessdate=25 July 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=7 April 2000|ref=Kisselgoff NY Times 2000 Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York Times]] said of the production, "Look past the show's brassy facade, with its rock-show production values and attitude (mock ecstasy is the usual facial expression), and there is some complex footwork in what is essentially a suite of deliberately souped-up social dances."&lt;ref name="Kisselgoff NY Times 2000 Review" /&gt;

==Early years==
In 2001, Jason Gilkison took over the role of [[choreographer]].&lt;ref name="Pacheko Culture Monster, Elton" /&gt; By 2005, an Australian workshop of the show was named "Jason Gilkison's Ballroom."&lt;ref name="Not your grandmother's chacah" /&gt;
Through the course of several tours, the production tinkered with what worked.&lt;ref name="Not your grandmother's chacah" /&gt; Growing into a large production requiring seven vehicles to move from city to city, the tour's creative team began to realize that they preferred the show more stripped down and focused on the dancers.&lt;ref name="Not your grandmother's chacah"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pacheko|first1=Patrick|title='Burn the Floor': Not your grandmother's cha-cha|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/02/entertainment/ca-burn-the-floor2|accessdate=25 July 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2 August 2009|ref=Not your grandmother's chacha}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gilkison, 
“The goal was to streamline it, make it more theatrical, reinvent it with the help of the dancers, who had their own ideas of how to make it more contemporary."&lt;ref name="Pacheko Culture Monster, Elton" /&gt;

'''Chad Valley''' is a long-established brand of [[toy]]s in the United Kingdom owned by [[Sainsbury's]].

== History ==
[[File:Thinktank Birmingham - object 1984S03753.00015(1).jpg|thumb|A tin-plate Chad Valley toy truck, displaying their royal warrant.]]
The company has its roots in a printing business established by Anthony Bunn Johnson in [[Birmingham]] in the early 19th century. Under the management of his son Joseph and grandson Alfred the company moved to the suburb of [[Harborne]], in the valley of a stream called the [[Chad Brook]], giving its name to the [[Chad Valley, Birmingham|Chad Valley]] district, from which the company name is derived.

Chad Valley made a decision to expand their range to [[soft toy]]s before World War I. They mass-produced their new [[Teddy bear]]s in Harborne&lt;ref name=Woolworths&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woolworthsmuseum.co.uk/Toys-EarlyCV.html|title=Toys for Toffs - the early history of Chad Valley|accessdate=2015-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 the company received a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|royal warrant]] as 'Toymakers to H.M. The Queen'.&lt;ref name=Grace /&gt; When Princess Elizabeth acceded to the throne in 1952 the warrant was changed to read 'Toymakers to H.M. Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother'.&lt;ref name=Woolworths /&gt;

The company moved away from manufacturing toys in the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Instead they produced goods to help the war effort such as wooden instrument cases, cases for the barrels of anti-aircraft guns, hospital beds and electrical coils and starters.&lt;ref name=Grace&gt;{{cite web|title=Chad Valley Co|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Chad_Valley_Co|website=Grace's Guide|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945 the company resumed toy production. [[Tin toy|Tin plate toys]] were produced for the first time although manufacture was outsourced to Metal Box Ltd, a company with the skills and machinery needed to produce printed toys. This new tin plate range was such a success that in 1946 the company moved production in-house. They purchased the Birmingham metalworking company AS Cartwright Ltd to cut and fold metal, Winfield Ltd to produce clockwork mechanisms and Barronia Metals Ltd and True to Type Products Ltd to produce precision engineering equipment.&lt;ref name=ToyPrice&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Chad Valley|url=http://www.toypriceguide.co.uk/the-history-of-chad-valley/|website=Toy Price Guide|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The radio broadcaster [[Kenneth Horne]] was Chairman and Managing Director of the company from 1956 to 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Barry (2006). ''Round Mr Horne: The Life of Kenneth Horne''. Aurum Press. p. 180. {{ISBN|1-84513-123-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was one of the UK's leading toymakers for most of the 20th century, by 1960 it was operating seven factories and employing over 1,000 people. In the 1970s however it closed several factories and cuts were made in staffing and production, 1975 saw only two factories remaining. The company was taken over by [[Palitoy]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=Grace /&gt;

The brand name was bought by [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]] in 1988 and remained in use until that company's closure due to insolvency. [[Home Retail Group]], the parent company of retailers [[Homebase]] and [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]], purchased the brand for £5 million on 20 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090120-709556.html |title=Home Retail Signs Deal To Buys Chad Valley Toy Brand For GBP5M |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=2009-01-20 |accessdate=2009-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121121133/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090120-709556.html |archivedate=21 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chad Valley brand is now available exclusively at [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]]. In March 2016 [[Sainsbury's]] bought Home Retail Group and Chad Valley became a brand of Sainsbury's.

'''Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KBE}} (16 April 1889 – 25 December 1977) was an English  comic actor, filmmaker, and composer&lt;!--see talk page before adding or removing occupations--&gt; who rose to fame in the era of [[silent film]]. Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona "[[the Tramp]]" and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the [[film industry]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cousins|1p=72|2a1=Kemp|2pp=8, 22|3a1=Gunning|3p=41|4a1=Sarris|4p=139|5a1=Hansmeyer|5p=3}} His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the [[Victorian era]] until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy.

Chaplin's childhood in [[London]] was one of poverty and hardship. As his father was absent and his mother struggled financially, he was sent to a [[workhouse]] twice before the age of nine. When he was 14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring [[music hall]]s and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19, he was signed to the prestigious [[Fred Karno]] company, which took him to America. Chaplin was scouted for the film industry and began appearing in 1914 for [[Keystone Studios]]. He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base. Chaplin directed his own films from an early stage and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the [[Essanay Studios|Essanay]], [[Mutual Film|Mutual]], and [[First National Pictures|First National]] corporations. By 1918, he was one of the best-known figures in the world.

In 1919, Chaplin co-founded the distribution company [[United Artists]], which gave him complete control over his films. His first [[Feature length|feature-length]] was ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'' (1921), followed by ''[[A Woman of Paris]]'' (1923), ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' (1925), and ''[[The Circus (film)|The Circus]]'' (1928). He refused to move to [[sound film]]s in the 1930s, instead producing ''[[City Lights]]'' (1931) and ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' (1936) without dialogue. Chaplin became increasingly political, and his next film, ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940), satirised [[Adolf Hitler]]. The 1940s were a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin, and his popularity declined rapidly. He was accused of [[Communism|communist]] sympathies, while his involvement in a [[paternity suit]] and marriages to much younger women caused scandal. An [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation was opened, and Chaplin was forced to leave the United States and settle in Switzerland. He abandoned the Tramp in his later films, which include ''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]'' (1947), ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' (1952), ''[[A King in New York]]'' (1957), and ''[[A Countess from Hong Kong]]'' (1967).

Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of his films. He was a perfectionist, and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture. His films are characterised by [[slapstick]] combined with [[pathos]], typified in the Tramp's struggles against adversity. Many contain social and political themes, as well as autobiographical elements. In 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation for his work, Chaplin received an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Academy Award]] for "the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century". He continues to be held in high regard, with ''The Gold Rush'', ''City Lights'', ''Modern Times'', and ''The Great Dictator'' often ranked on industry lists of the greatest films of all time.

==Biography==
===1889–1913: Early years===

====Background and childhood hardship====
Charles Spencer Chaplin was born on 16 April 1889 to [[Hannah Chaplin]] (born Hannah Harriet Pedlingham Hill) and [[Charles Chaplin Sr]]. There is no official record of his birth, although Chaplin believed he was born at [[East Street]], [[Walworth]], in [[South London]].{{sfn|Robinson|p=10}}{{refn|An [[MI5]] investigation in 1952 was unable to find any record of Chaplin's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Whitehead |first=Tom |date=17 February 2012 |title=MI5 Files: Was Chaplin Really a Frenchman and Called Thornstein? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/9086510/MI5-files-Was-Chaplin-really-a-Frenchman-and-called-Thornstein.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |accessdate=11 April 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424011812/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/9086510/MI5-files-Was-Chaplin-really-a-Frenchman-and-called-Thornstein.html |archivedate=24 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaplin biographer David Robinson notes that it is not surprising that his parents failed to register the birth: "It was easy enough, particularly for music hall artists, constantly moving (if they were lucky) from one town to another, to put off and eventually forget this kind of formality; at that time the penalties were not strict or efficiently enforced."{{sfn|Robinson|p=10}} In 2011 a letter sent to Chaplin in the 1970s came to light which claimed that he had been born in a Gypsy caravan at [[Black Patch Park]] in [[Smethwick]], Staffordshire.

Chaplin's childhood was fraught with poverty and hardship, making his eventual trajectory "the most dramatic of all the rags to riches stories ever told" according to his authorised biographer [[David Robinson (film critic)|David Robinson]].{{sfn|Robinson|p=xv}} Chaplin's early years were spent with his mother and brother Sydney in the London district of [[Kennington]]; Hannah had no means of income, other than occasional nursing and dressmaking, and Chaplin Sr. provided no financial support.{{sfn|Robinson|p=16}} As the situation deteriorated, Chaplin was sent to [[Lambeth Workhouse]] when he was seven years old.{{refn|Hannah became ill in May 1896, and was admitted to hospital. Southwark Council ruled that it was necessary to send the children to a workhouse "owing to the absence of their father and the destitution and illness of their mother".{{sfn|Robinson|p=19}}|group=note}} The council housed him at the [[Central London District School]] for [[Pauperism|paupers]], which Chaplin remembered as "a forlorn existence".{{sfn|Chaplin|p=29}} He was briefly reunited with his mother 18 months later, before Hannah was forced to readmit her family to the workhouse in July 1898.

In September 1898, Hannah was committed to the 'London County Council Asylum with provision for Croydon,' commonly known as 'Cane Hill Asylum', which was in 1930 renamed [[Cane Hill Hospital|Cane Hill Mental Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ezitis.myzen.co.uk/canehill.html | title=Lost_Hospitals_of_London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She had developed [[psychosis]] seemingly brought on by an infection of [[syphilis]] and malnutrition.{{sfn|Weissman|2009|pp=49–50}} For the two months she was there, Chaplin and his brother Sydney were sent to live with their father, whom the young boys scarcely knew.{{sfn|Chaplin|pp=15, 33}} Charles Sr. was by then a severe alcoholic, and life there was bad enough to provoke a visit from the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]].{{sfn|Robinson|p=27}} Chaplin's father died two years later, at 38 years old, from [[cirrhosis]] of the liver.{{sfn|Robinson|p=36}}

Hannah entered a period of remission but, in May 1903, became ill again.{{sfn|Robinson|p=27}} Chaplin, then 14, had the task of taking his mother to the infirmary, from where she was sent back to Cane Hill.{{sfn|Robinson|p=40}} He lived alone for several days, searching for food and occasionally sleeping rough, until Sydney – who had enrolled in the Navy two years earlier – returned.{{sfnm|1a1=Weissman|1y=2009|1p=6|2a1=Chaplin|2pp=71–74|3a1=Robinson|3p=35}} Hannah was released from the asylum eight months later,{{sfn|Robinson|p=41}} but in March 1905, her illness returned, this time permanently. "There was nothing we could do but accept poor mother's fate", Chaplin later wrote, and she remained in care until her death in 1928.{{sfnm|1a1=Chaplin|1p=88|2a1=Robinson|2pp=55–56}}

====Young performer====
[[File:Chaplin in Sherlock Holmes.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A teenage Chaplin in the play ''[[Sherlock Holmes (play)|Sherlock Holmes]]'', in which he appeared between 1903 and 1906]]

Between his time in the poor schools and his mother succumbing to mental illness, Chaplin began to perform on stage. He later recalled making his first amateur appearance at the age of five years, when he took over from Hannah one night in [[Aldershot]].{{refn|According to Chaplin, Hannah had been booed off stage, and the manager chose him – as he was standing in the wings – to go on as her replacement. He remembered confidently entertaining the crowd, and receiving laughter and applause.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=17|2a1=Chaplin|2p=18}}|group=note}} This was an isolated occurrence, but by the time he was nine Chaplin had, with his mother's encouragement, grown interested in performing. He later wrote: "[she] imbued me with the feeling that I had some sort of talent".{{sfn|Chaplin|p=41}} Through his father's connections,{{sfn|Marriot|p=4}} Chaplin became a member of the [[The Eight Lancashire Lads|Eight Lancashire Lads]] [[Clog dance|clog-dancing]] troupe, with whom he toured English music halls throughout 1899 and 1900.{{refn|The Eight Lancashire Lads were still touring until 1908; the exact time Chaplin left the group is unverified, but based on research, A. J. Marriot believes it was in December 1900.{{sfn|Marriot|p=213}}|group=note}} Chaplin worked hard, and the act was popular with audiences, but he was not satisfied with dancing and wished to form a comedy act.{{sfn|Chaplin|p=44}}

In the years Chaplin was touring with the Eight Lancashire Lads, his mother ensured that he still attended school but, by age 13, he had abandoned education.{{sfn|Louvish|p=19}}&lt;!-- mother --&gt;{{sfn|Robinson|p=39}}&lt;!-- abandoned --&gt; He supported himself with a range of jobs, while nursing his ambition to become an actor.{{sfn|Chaplin|p=76}} At 14, shortly after his mother's relapse, he registered with a theatrical agency in London's [[West End of London|West End]]. The manager sensed potential in Chaplin, who was promptly given his first role as a newsboy in [[Harry Arthur Saintsbury]]'s ''Jim, a Romance of Cockayne''.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=44–46}} It opened in July 1903, but the show was unsuccessful and closed after two weeks. Chaplin's comic performance, however, was singled out for praise in many of the reviews.{{sfnm|1a1=Marriot|1pp=42–44|2a1=Robinson|2pp=46–47|3a1=Louvish|3p=26}}

Saintsbury secured a role for Chaplin in [[Charles Frohman]]'s production of ''[[Sherlock Holmes (play)|Sherlock Holmes]]'', where he played Billy the pageboy in three nationwide tours.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=45, 49–51, 53, 58}} His performance was so well received that he was called to London to play the role alongside [[William Gillette]], the original Holmes.{{refn|William Gillette co-wrote the ''Sherlock Holmes'' play with [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], and had been starring in it since its New York opening in 1899. He had come to London in 1905 to appear in a new play, ''Clarice''. Its reception was poor, and Gillette decided to add an "after-piece" called ''The Painful Predicament of Sherlock Holmes''. This short play was what Chaplin originally came to London to appear in. After three nights, Gillette chose to close ''Clarice'' and replace it with ''Sherlock Holmes''. Chaplin had so pleased Gillette with his performance in ''The Painful Predicament'' that he was kept on as Billy for the full play.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=59–60}}|group=note}} "It was like tidings from heaven", Chaplin recalled.{{sfn|Chaplin|p=89}} At 16 years old, Chaplin starred in the play's West End production at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] from October to December 1905.{{sfn|Marriot|p=217}} He completed one final tour of ''Sherlock Holmes'' in early 1906, before leaving the play after more than two-and-a-half years.{{sfn|Robinson|p=63}}

====Stage comedy and vaudeville====
Chaplin soon found work with a new company, and went on tour with his brother – who was also pursuing an acting career – in a [[Sketch comedy|comedy sketch]] called ''Repairs''.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=63–64}} In May 1906, Chaplin joined the juvenile act ''Casey's Circus'',{{sfn|Marriot|p=71}} where he developed popular [[burlesque]] pieces and was soon the star of the show. By the time the act finished touring in July 1907, the 18-year-old had become an accomplished comedic performer.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=64–68|2a1=Chaplin|2p=94}} He struggled to find more work, however, and a brief attempt at a solo act was a failure.{{refn|Chaplin attempted to be a "Jewish comedian", but the act was poorly received and he performed it only once.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=68|2a1=Marriot|2pp=81–84}}|group=note}}

[[File:Chaplin Karno advert.jpg|thumb|Advertisement from Chaplin's American tour with the [[Fred Karno]] comedy company, 1913]]

Meanwhile, Sydney Chaplin had joined [[Fred Karno]]'s prestigious comedy company in 1906 and, by 1908, he was one of their key performers.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=71|2a1=Kamin|2p=12|3a1=Marriot|3p=85}} In February, he managed to secure a two-week trial for his younger brother. Karno was initially wary, and considered Chaplin a "pale, puny, sullen-looking youngster" who "looked much too shy to do any good in the theatre."{{sfn|Robinson|p=76}} However, the teenager made an impact on his first night at the [[London Coliseum]] and he was quickly signed to a contract.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=76–77}} Chaplin began by playing a series of minor parts, eventually progressing to starring roles in 1909.{{sfn|Marriot|pp=103, 109}} In April 1910, he was given the lead in a new sketch, ''Jimmy the Fearless''. It was a big success, and Chaplin received considerable press attention.{{sfnm|1a1=Marriot|1pp=126–128|2a1=Robinson|2pp=84–85}}

Karno selected his new star to join the section of the company, one that also included [[Stan Laurel]], that toured North America's [[vaudeville]] circuit.{{sfn|Robinson|p=88}} The young comedian headed the show and impressed reviewers, being described as "one of the best pantomime artists ever seen here".{{sfn|Robinson|pp=91–92}} His most successful role was a drunk called the "Inebriate Swell", which drew him significant recognition.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=82|2a1=Brownlow|2p=98}} The tour lasted 21 months, and the troupe returned to England in June 1912.{{sfn|Robinson|p=95}} Chaplin recalled that he "had a disquieting feeling of sinking back into a depressing commonplaceness" and was, therefore, delighted when a new tour began in October.{{sfnm|1a1=Chaplin|1pp=133–134|2a1=Robinson|2p=96}}

===1914–1917: Entering films===
====Keystone====

Six months into the second American tour, Chaplin was invited to join the New York Motion Picture Company. A representative who had seen his performances thought he could replace [[Fred Mace]], a star of their [[Keystone Studios]] who intended to leave.{{sfn|Robinson|p=102}} Chaplin thought the Keystone comedies "a crude mélange of rough and rumble", but liked the idea of working in films and rationalised: "Besides, it would mean a new life."{{sfn|Chaplin|pp=138–139}} He met with the company and signed a $150-per-week (${{Inflation|US|150|1913|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars){{Inflation-fn|US}} contract in September 1913.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=103|2a1=Chaplin|2p=139}}

Chaplin arrived in Los Angeles, home of the Keystone studio, in early December 1913.{{sfn|Robinson|p=107}} His boss was [[Mack Sennett]], who initially expressed concern that the 24-year-old looked too young.{{sfn|Chaplin|p=141}} He was not used in a picture until late January, during which time Chaplin attempted to learn the processes of filmmaking.{{sfn|Robinson|p=108}} The [[Film reel|one-reeler]] ''[[Making a Living]]'' marked his film acting debut and was released on 2 February 1914. Chaplin strongly disliked the picture, but one review picked him out as "a comedian of the first water".{{sfn|Robinson|p=110}} For his second appearance in front of the camera, Chaplin selected the costume with which he became identified. He described the process in his autobiography:

{{quote|"I wanted everything to be a contradiction: the pants baggy, the coat tight, the hat small and the shoes large&amp;nbsp;... I added a small moustache, which, I reasoned, would add age without hiding my expression. I had no idea of the character. But the moment I was dressed, the clothes and the makeup made me feel the person he was. I began to know him, and by the time I walked on stage he was fully born."{{sfn|Chaplin|p=145}}{{refn|Robinson notes that "this was not strictly true: the character was to take a year or more to evolve its full dimensions and even then – which was its particular strength – it would evolve during the whole rest of his career".{{sfn|Robinson|p=114}}|group=note}}}}

The film was ''[[Mabel's Strange Predicament]]'', but "[[the Tramp]]" character, as it became known, debuted to audiences in ''[[Kid Auto Races at Venice]]'' – shot later than ''Mabel's Strange Predicament'' but released two days earlier.{{sfn|Robinson|p=113}} Chaplin adopted the character as his screen persona and attempted to make suggestions for the films he appeared in. These ideas were dismissed by his directors.{{sfn|Robinson|p=120}} During the filming of his eleventh picture, ''[[Mabel at the Wheel]]'', he clashed with director [[Mabel Normand]] and was almost released from his contract. Sennett kept him on, however, when he received orders from exhibitors for more Chaplin films.&lt;ref&gt;Chaplin, C. (1964). ''My Autobiography''. New York: Simon and Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; Sennett also allowed Chaplin to direct his next film himself after Chaplin promised to pay $1,500 (${{Inflation|US|1500|1913|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) if the film was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Robinson|p=121}}

''[[Caught in the Rain]]'', issued 4 May 1914, was Chaplin's directorial debut and was highly successful.{{sfn|Robinson|p=123}} Thereafter he directed almost every short film in which he appeared for Keystone,{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=5}} at the rate of approximately one per week,{{sfn|Kamin|p=xi}} a period which he later remembered as the most exciting time of his career.{{sfn|Chaplin|p=153}} Chaplin's films introduced a slower form of comedy than the typical Keystone farce,{{sfn|Robinson|p=113}} and he developed a large fan base.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=125|2a1=Maland|2y=1989|2pp=8–9}} In November 1914, he had a supporting role in the first [[feature length]] comedy film, ''[[Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914 film)|Tillie's Punctured Romance]]'', directed by Sennett and starring [[Marie Dressler]], which was a commercial success and increased his popularity.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=127–128}} When Chaplin's contract came up for renewal at the end of the year, he asked for $1,000 a week (${{Inflation|US|1000|1913|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) – an amount Sennett refused as too large.{{sfn|Robinson|p=131}}

====Essanay====
[[File:Chaplin and Purviance in Work.jpg|thumb|Chaplin and [[Edna Purviance]], his regular leading lady, in ''[[Work (1915 film)|Work]]'' (1915)]]

The [[Essanay Studios|Essanay Film Manufacturing Company]] of Chicago sent Chaplin an offer of $1,250 a week with a signing bonus of $10,000. He joined the studio in late December 1914,{{sfn|Robinson|p=135}} where he began forming a stock company of regular players, including [[Leo White]], [[Bud Jamison]], Paddy McGuire and Billy Armstrong. He soon recruited a leading lady – [[Edna Purviance]], whom Chaplin met in a cafe and hired on account of her beauty. She went on to appear in 35 films with Chaplin over eight years;{{sfn|Robinson|pp=138–139}} the pair also formed a romantic relationship that lasted into 1917.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=141, 219}}

Chaplin asserted a high level of control over his pictures and started to put more time and care into each film.{{sfnm|1a1=Neibaur|1p=23|2a1=Chaplin|2p=165|3a1=Robinson|3pp=140, 143}} There was a month-long interval between the release of his second production, ''[[A Night Out (1915 film)|A Night Out]]'', and his third, ''[[The Champion (1915 film)|The Champion]]''.{{sfn|Robinson|p=143}} The final seven of Chaplin's 14 Essanay films were all produced at this slower pace.{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=20}} Chaplin also began to alter his screen persona, which had attracted some criticism at Keystone for its "mean, crude, and brutish" nature.{{sfn|Maland|1989|pp=6, 14–18}} The character became more gentle and romantic;{{sfn|Maland|1989|pp=21–24}} ''[[The Tramp (film)|The Tramp]]'' (April 1915) was considered a particular turning point in his development.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=142|2a1=Neibaur|2pp=23–24}} The use of pathos was developed further with ''[[The Bank (1915 film)|The Bank]]'', in which Chaplin created a sad ending. Robinson notes that this was an innovation in comedy films, and marked the time when serious critics began to appreciate Chaplin's work.{{sfn|Robinson|p=146}} At Essanay, writes film scholar [[Simon Louvish]], Chaplin "found the themes and the settings that would define the Tramp's world."{{sfn|Louvish|p=87}}

During 1915, Chaplin became a cultural phenomenon. Shops were stocked with Chaplin merchandise, he was featured in cartoons and comic strips, and several songs were written about him.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=152–153|2a1=Kamin|2p=xi|3a1=Maland|3y=1989|3p=10}} In July, a journalist for ''[[Motion Picture Magazine]]'' wrote that "Chaplinitis" had spread across America.{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=8}} As his fame grew worldwide, he became the film industry's first international star.{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1p=74|2a1=Sklar|2p=72}} When the Essanay contract ended in December 1915,{{sfn|Robinson|p=149}}{{refn|After leaving Essanay, Chaplin found himself engaged in a legal battle with the company that lasted until 1922. It began when Essanay extended his last film for them, ''[[Burlesque on Carmen]]'', from a two-reeler to a feature film (by adding out-takes and new scenes with [[Leo White]]) without his consent. Chaplin applied for an injunction to prevent its distribution, but the case was dismissed in court. In a counter-claim, Essanay alleged that Chaplin had broken his contract by not producing the agreed number of films and sued him for $500,000 in damages. In addition, the company compiled another film, ''[[Triple Trouble (1918 film)|Triple Trouble]]'' (1918), from various unused Chaplin scenes and new material shot by White.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=149–152}}|group=note}} Chaplin – fully aware of his popularity – requested a $150,000 signing bonus from his next studio. He received several offers, including [[Universal Studios|Universal]], [[Fox Film|Fox]], and [[Vitagraph Studios|Vitagraph]], the best of which came from the [[Mutual Film|Mutual Film Corporation]] at $10,000 a week.{{sfn|Robinson|p=156}}

====Mutual====

Freuler, the studio president, explained: "We can afford to pay Mr. Chaplin this large sum annually because the public wants Chaplin and will pay for him."{{sfn|Robinson|p=159}}

Mutual gave Chaplin his own Los Angeles studio to work in, which opened in March 1916.{{sfn|Robinson|p=164}} He added two key members to his stock company, [[Albert Austin]] and [[Eric Campbell (actor)|Eric Campbell]],{{sfn|Robinson|pp=165–166}} and produced a series of elaborate two-reelers: ''[[The Floorwalker]]'', ''[[The Fireman (1916 film)|The Fireman]]'', ''[[The Vagabond (film)|The Vagabond]]'', ''[[One A.M.

Chaplin was attacked in the British media for not fighting in the [[World War I|First World War]].{{sfn|Robinson|p=185}} He defended himself, revealing that he would fight for Britain if called and had registered for the American draft, but he was not summoned by either country.{{refn|The British embassy made a statement saying: "[Chaplin] is of as much use to Great Britain now making big money and subscribing to war loans as he would be in the trenches."{{sfn|Robinson|p=186}}|group=note}} Despite this criticism Chaplin was a favourite with the troops,{{sfn|Robinson|p=187}} and his popularity continued to grow worldwide. ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' reported that the name of Charlie Chaplin was "a part of the common language of almost every country", and that the Tramp image was "universally familiar".{{sfn|Robinson|p=210}} In 1917, professional Chaplin imitators were so widespread that he took legal action,{{sfn|Robinson|pp=215–216}} and it was reported that nine out of ten men who attended costume parties dressed as the Tramp.{{sfn|Robinson|p=213}} The same year, a study by the [[Boston Society for Psychical Research]] concluded that Chaplin was "an American obsession".{{sfn|Robinson|p=213}} The actress [[Minnie Maddern Fiske]] wrote that "a constantly increasing body of cultured, artistic people are beginning to regard the young English buffoon, Charles Chaplin, as an extraordinary artist, as well as a comic genius".{{sfn|Robinson|p=210}}

===1918–1922: First National===
[[File:Poster - A Dog's Life 01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''[[A Dog's Life]]'' (1918). It was around this time that Chaplin began to conceive the Tramp as "a sort of [[Pierrot]]", or sad clown.]]

In January 1918, Chaplin was visited by leading British singer and comedian [[Harry Lauder]], and the two acted in a short film together.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYf7O4kzGJQ Chaplin] "Charlie Chaplin meets Harry Lauder - Rare Archival Footage", Roy Export Company Ltd., Association Chaplin via YouTube. Retrieved November 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutual was patient with Chaplin's decreased rate of output, and the contract ended amicably. With his aforementioned concern about the declining quality of his films because of contract scheduling stipulations, Chaplin's primary concern in finding a new distributor was independence; Sydney Chaplin, then his business manager, told the press, "Charlie [must] be allowed all the time he needs and all the money for producing [films] the way he wants&amp;nbsp;... It is quality, not quantity, we are after."{{sfn|Robinson|p=221}} In June 1917, Chaplin signed to complete eight films for [[First National Pictures|First National Exhibitors' Circuit]] in return for $1&amp;nbsp;million (${{Inflation|US|1|1917|r=1|fmt=c}} million today).{{sfn|Schickel|p=8}} He chose to build his own studio, situated on five acres of land off [[Sunset Boulevard]], with production facilities of the highest order.{{sfnm|1a1=Chaplin|1p=203|2a1=Robinson|2pp=225–226}} It was completed in January 1918,{{sfn|Robinson|p=228}} and Chaplin was given freedom over the making of his pictures.&lt;ref name="BFI first national"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chaplin.bfi.org.uk/resources/bfi/biog/biog.php?fid=biog7 |title=Independence Won: First National |publisher=British Film Institute |work=Charlie Chaplin |accessdate=5 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324095424/http://chaplin.bfi.org.uk/resources/bfi/biog/biog.php?fid=biog7 |archivedate=24 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[A Dog's Life]]'', released April 1918, was the first film under the new contract. In it, Chaplin demonstrated his increasing concern with story construction and his treatment of the Tramp as "a sort of [[Pierrot]]".{{sfn|Chaplin|p=208}} The film was described by [[Louis Delluc]] as "cinema's first total work of art".{{sfn|Robinson|p=229}} Chaplin then embarked on the [[Liberty bond#Sales difficulties and the subsequent campaign|Third Liberty Bond]] campaign, touring the United States for one month to raise money for the Allies of the First World War.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=237, 241}} He also produced a short [[propaganda]] film at his own expense, donated to the government for fund-raising, called ''[[The Bond]]''.{{sfn|Robinson|p=244}} Chaplin's next release was war-based, placing the Tramp in the trenches for ''[[Shoulder Arms]]''. Associates warned him against making a comedy about the war but, as he later recalled: "Dangerous or not, the idea excited me."{{sfn|Chaplin|p=218}} He spent four months filming the 45-minute-long picture, which was released in October 1918 with great success.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=241–245}}

====United Artists, Mildred Harris, and ''The Kid''====
After the release of ''Shoulder Arms'', Chaplin requested more money from First National, which was refused. Frustrated with their lack of concern for quality, and worried about rumours of a possible merger between the company and [[Famous Players-Lasky]], Chaplin joined forces with [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Mary Pickford]], and [[D. W. Griffith]] to form a new distribution company – [[United Artists]], established in January 1919.{{sfnm|1a1=Chaplin|1pp=219–220|2a1=Balio|2p=12|3a1=Robinson|3p=267}} The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control.{{sfn|Robinson|p=269}} Chaplin was eager to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with First National. They refused and insisted that he complete the final six films owed.{{sfn|Chaplin|p=223}}

[[File:Chaplin The Kid 2 crop.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'' (1921), with [[Jackie Coogan]], combined comedy with drama and was Chaplin's first film to exceed an hour.]]

Before the creation of United Artists, Chaplin married for the first time. The 16-year-old actress [[Mildred Harris]] had revealed that she was pregnant with his child, and in September 1918, he married her quietly in Los Angeles to avoid controversy.{{sfn|Robinson|p=246}} Soon after, the pregnancy was found to be false.{{sfn|Robinson|p=248}} Chaplin was unhappy with the union and, feeling that marriage stunted his creativity, struggled over the production of his film ''[[Sunnyside (film)|Sunnyside]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=246–249|2a1=Louvish|2p=141}} Harris was by then legitimately pregnant, and on 7 July 1919, gave birth to a son. Norman Spencer Chaplin was born malformed and died three days later.{{sfn|Robinson|p=251}} The marriage ended in April 1920, with Chaplin explaining in his autobiography that they were "irreconcilably mismated".{{sfnm|1a1=Chaplin|1p=235|2a1=Robinson|2p=259}}

Losing the child, plus his own childhood experiences, are thought to have influenced Chaplin's film, which turned the Tramp into the caretaker of a young boy.&lt;ref name="BFI first national"/&gt;{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=252|2a1=Louvish|2p=148}} For this new venture, Chaplin also wished to do more than comedy and, according to Louvish, "make his mark on a changed world."{{sfn|Louvish|p=146}} Filming on ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'' began in August 1919, with four-year-old [[Jackie Coogan]] his co-star.{{sfn|Robinson|p=253}} ''The Kid'' was in production for nine months until May 1920 and, at 68 minutes, it was Chaplin's longest picture to date.{{sfn|Robinson|p=261}} Dealing with issues of poverty and parent–child separation, ''The Kid'' was one of the earliest films to combine comedy and drama.{{sfn|Chaplin|pp=233–234}} It was released in January 1921 with instant success, and, by 1924, had been screened in over 50 countries.{{sfn|Robinson|p=265}}

Chaplin spent five months on his next film, the two-reeler ''[[The Idle Class]]''.{{sfn|Robinson|p=269}} Following its September 1921 release, he chose to return to England for the first time in almost a decade.{{sfn|Robinson|p=282}} He then worked to fulfil his First National contract, releasing ''[[Pay Day (1922 film)|Pay Day]]'' in February 1922. ''[[The Pilgrim (1923 film)|The Pilgrim]]'' – his final short film – was delayed by distribution disagreements with the studio, and released a year later.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=295–300}}

===1923–1938: Silent features===
====''A Woman of Paris'' and ''The Gold Rush''====

Having fulfilled his First National contract, Chaplin was free to make his first picture as an independent producer. In November 1922, he began filming ''[[A Woman of Paris]]'', a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers.{{sfn|Robinson|p=310}} Chaplin intended it to be a star-making vehicle for Edna Purviance,{{sfn|Robinson|p=302}} and did not appear in the picture himself other than in a brief, uncredited cameo.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=311–312}} He wished the film to have a realistic feel and directed his cast to give restrained performances. In real life, he explained, "men and women try to hide their emotions rather than seek to express them".{{sfn|Robinson|pp=319–321}} ''A Woman of Paris'' premiered in September 1923 and was acclaimed for its innovative, subtle approach.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=318–321}} The public, however, seemed to have little interest in a Chaplin film without Chaplin, and it was a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]].{{sfn|Louvish|p=193}} The filmmaker was hurt by this failure – he had long wanted to produce a dramatic film and was proud of the result – and soon withdrew ''A Woman of Paris'' from circulation.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=302, 322}}

[[File:Chaplin the gold rush boot.jpg|thumb|left|The Tramp resorts to eating his boot in a famous scene from ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' (1925).]]

Chaplin returned to comedy for his next project. Setting his standards high, he told himself "This next film must be an epic! The Greatest!"{{sfn|Louvish|p=195}} Inspired by a photograph of the 1898 [[Klondike Gold Rush]], and later the story of the [[Donner Party]] of 1846–47, he made what Geoffrey Macnab calls "an epic comedy out of grim subject matter."{{sfnm|1a1=Kemp|1p=64|2a1=Chaplin|2p=299}} In ''[[The Gold Rush]]'', the Tramp is a lonely [[prospecting|prospector]] fighting adversity and looking for love. With [[Georgia Hale]] as his new leading lady, Chaplin began filming the picture in February 1924.{{sfn|Robinson|p=337}} Its elaborate production, costing almost $1 million,{{sfn|Robinson|p=358}} included [[location shooting]] in the [[Truckee Range|Truckee mountains]] with 600 extras, extravagant sets, and [[special effect]]s.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=340–345}} The last scene was shot May 1925 after 15 months of filming.{{sfn|Robinson|p=354}}

Chaplin felt ''The Gold Rush'' was the best film he had made.{{sfn|Robinson|p=357}} It opened in August 1925 and became one of the highest-grossing films of the silent era with a U.S. box-office of $5 million.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=358|2a1=Kemp|2p=63}} The comedy contains some of Chaplin's most famous sequences, such as the Tramp eating his shoe and the "Dance of the Rolls".{{sfnm|1a1=Kemp|1pp=63–64|2a1=Robinson|2pp=339, 353|3a1=Louvish|3p=200|4a1=Schickel|4p=19}} Macnab has called it "the quintessential Chaplin film".{{sfn|Kemp|p=64}} Chaplin stated at its release, "This is the picture that I want to be remembered by".{{sfn|Vance|2003|p=154}}

====Lita Grey and ''The Circus''====
[[File:Lita Grey.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lita Grey]], whose bitter divorce from Chaplin caused a scandal]]

While making ''The Gold Rush'', Chaplin married for the second time. Mirroring the circumstances of his first union, [[Lita Grey]] was a teenage actress, originally set to star in the film, whose surprise announcement of pregnancy forced Chaplin into marriage. She was 16 and he was 35, meaning Chaplin could have been charged with [[statutory rape]] under California law.{{sfn|Robinson|p=346}} He therefore arranged a discreet marriage in Mexico on 25 November 1924.{{sfnm|1a1=Chaplin and Vance|1p=53|2a1=Vance|2y=2003|2p=170}} Their first son, [[Charles Chaplin Jr.|Charles Spencer Chaplin, Jr.]], was born on 5 May 1925, followed by [[Sydney Chaplin (American actor)|Sydney Earl Chaplin]] on 30 March 1926.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=355, 368}}

It was an unhappy marriage, and Chaplin spent long hours at the studio to avoid seeing his wife.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=350, 368}} In November 1926, Grey took the children and left the family home.{{sfn|Robinson|p=371}} A bitter divorce followed, in which Grey's application – accusing Chaplin of infidelity, abuse, and of harbouring "perverted sexual desires" – was leaked to the press.{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1p=220|2a1=Robinson|2pp=372–374}}{{refn|In her memoirs, Lita Grey later claimed that many of her complaints were "cleverly, shockingly enlarged upon or distorted" by her lawyers.{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=96}}|group=note}} Chaplin was reported to be in a state of nervous breakdown, as the story became headline news and groups formed across America calling for his films to be banned.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=372–374|2a1=Louvish|2pp=220–221}} Eager to end the case without further scandal, Chaplin's lawyers agreed to a cash settlement of $600,000{{snds}}the largest awarded by American courts at that time.{{sfn|Robinson|p=378}} His fan base was strong enough to survive the incident, and it was soon forgotten, but Chaplin was deeply affected by it.{{sfnm|1a1=Maland|1y=1989|1pp=99–105|2a1=Robinson|2p=383}}

Before the divorce suit was filed, Chaplin had begun work on a new film, ''[[The Circus (film)|The Circus]]''.{{sfn|Robinson|p=360}} He built a story around the idea of walking a tightrope while besieged by monkeys, and turned the Tramp into the accidental star of a circus.{{sfn|Robinson|p=361}} Filming was suspended for 10 months while he dealt with the divorce scandal,{{sfn|Robinson|pp=371, 381}} and it was generally a trouble-ridden production.{{sfn|Louvish|p=215}} Finally completed in October 1927, ''The Circus'' was released in January 1928 to a positive reception.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=382}} At the [[1st Academy Awards]], Chaplin was given a special trophy "For versatility and genius in acting, writing, directing and producing ''The Circus''".&lt;ref name="circus"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Pfeiffer |first=Lee |title=The Circus – Film by Chaplin [1928] |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Circus |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=9 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905164503/http://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Circus |archivedate= 5 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its success, he permanently associated the film with the stress of its production; Chaplin omitted ''The Circus'' from his autobiography, and struggled to work on it when he recorded the score in his later years.{{sfnm|1a1=Brownlow|1p=73|2a1=Louvish|2p=224}}

By the time ''The Circus'' was released, Hollywood had witnessed the introduction of [[sound film]]s. Chaplin was cynical about this new medium and the technical shortcomings it presented, believing that "talkies" lacked the artistry of silent films.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=389|2a1=Chaplin|2p=321}} He was also hesitant to change the formula that had brought him such success,{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=465|2a1=Chaplin|2p=322|3a1=Maland|3y=2007|3p=29}} and feared that giving the Tramp a voice would limit his international appeal.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=389|2a1=Maland|2y=2007|2p=29}} He, therefore, rejected the new Hollywood craze and began work on a new silent film. Chaplin was nonetheless anxious about this decision and remained so throughout the film's production.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=389|2a1=Maland|2y=2007|2p=29}}

[[File:Chaplin City Lights still.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''[[City Lights]]'' (1931), regarded as one of Chaplin's finest works]]

When filming began at the end of 1928, Chaplin had been working on the story for almost a year.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=398|2a1=Maland|2y=2007|2pp=33–34, 41}} ''[[City Lights]]'' followed the Tramp's love for a blind flower girl (played by [[Virginia Cherrill]]) and his efforts to raise money for her sight-saving operation. It was a challenging production that lasted 21 months,{{sfn|Robinson|p=409|ps=, records the date filming ended as 22 September 1930.}} with Chaplin later confessing that he "had worked himself into a neurotic state of wanting perfection".{{sfn|Chaplin|p=324}} One advantage Chaplin found in sound technology was the opportunity to record a musical score for the film, which he composed himself.{{sfn|Chaplin|p=324}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charliechaplin.com/biography/articles/205-Chaplin-as-a-composer |title=Chaplin as a composer |publisher=CharlieChaplin.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705021919/http://www.charliechaplin.com/biography/articles/205-Chaplin-as-a-composer |archivedate= 5 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaplin finished editing ''City Lights'' in December 1930, by which time silent films were an anachronism.{{sfn|Robinson|p=410}} A preview before an unsuspecting public audience was not a success,{{sfn|Chaplin|p=325}} but a showing for the press produced positive reviews. One journalist wrote, "Nobody in the world but Charlie Chaplin could have done it. He is the only person that has that peculiar something called 'audience appeal' in sufficient quality to defy the popular penchant for movies that talk."{{sfn|Robinson|p=413}} Given its general release in January 1931, ''City Lights'' proved to be a popular and financial success – eventually grossing over $3 million.{{sfnm|1a1=Maland|1y=2007|1pp=108–110|2a1=Chaplin|2p=328|3a1=Robinson|3p=415}} The [[British Film Institute]] cites it as Chaplin's finest accomplishment, and the critic [[James Agee]] hails the closing scene as "the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies".&lt;ref name="bfi great features"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chaplin.bfi.org.uk/resources/bfi/biog/biog.php?fid=biog9 |title=United Artists and the Great Features |publisher=British Film Institute |work=Charlie Chaplin |accessdate=21 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406094725/http://chaplin.bfi.org.uk/resources/bfi/biog/biog.php?fid=biog9 |archivedate= 6 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Maland|2007|pp=10–11}} ''City Lights'' became Chaplin's personal favourite of his films and remained so throughout his life.{{sfn|Vance|2003|p=208}}

====Travels, Paulette Goddard, and ''Modern Times''====
''City Lights'' had been a success, but Chaplin was unsure if he could make another picture without dialogue. He remained convinced that sound would not work in his films, but was also "obsessed by a depressing fear of being old-fashioned."{{sfn|Chaplin|p=360}} In this state of uncertainty, early in 1931, the comedian decided to take a holiday and ended up travelling for 16 months.{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1p=243|2a1=Robinson|2p=420}}{{refn|Chaplin left the United States on 31 January 1931, and returned on 10 June 1932.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=664–666}}|group=note}} He spent months travelling Western Europe, including extended stays in France and Switzerland, and spontaneously decided to visit Japan.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=429–441}} The day after he arrived in Japan, Prime Minister [[Inukai Tsuyoshi]] was assassinated by ultra-nationalists in the [[May 15 Incident]]. The group's original plan had been to provoke a war with the United States by assassinating Chaplin at a welcome reception organised by the prime minister, but the plan had been foiled due to delayed public announcement of the event's date.{{sfn|Silverberg|pp=1–2}}

[[File:Modern Times poster.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' (1936), described by Jérôme Larcher as a "grim contemplation on the automatization of the individual"{{sfn|Larcher|p=64}}]]

In his autobiography, Chaplin recalled that on his return to Los Angeles, "I was confused and without plan, restless and conscious of an extreme loneliness". He briefly considered retiring and moving to China.{{sfn|Chaplin|pp=372, 375}} Chaplin's loneliness was relieved when he met 21-year-old actress [[Paulette Goddard]] in July 1932, and the pair began a relationship.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=453|2a1=Maland|2y=1989|2p=147}} He was not ready to commit to a film, however, and focused on writing a [[Serial (literature)|serial]] about his travels (published in ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'').{{sfn|Robinson|p=451}} The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin, including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and he became increasingly interested in world affairs.{{sfn|Louvish|p=256}} The state of labour in America troubled him, and he feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels. It was these concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film.{{sfnm|1a1=Larcher|1p=63|2a1=Robinson|2pp=457–458}}

''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' was announced by Chaplin as "a satire on certain phases of our industrial life."{{sfn|Louvish|p=257}} Featuring the Tramp and Goddard as they endure the [[Great Depression]], it took ten and a half months to film.{{sfn|Robinson|p=465}} Chaplin intended to use spoken dialogue but changed his mind during rehearsals. Like its predecessor, ''Modern Times'' employed sound effects but almost no speaking.{{sfn|Robinson|p=466}} Chaplin's performance of a gibberish song did, however, give the Tramp a voice for the only time on film.{{sfn|Robinson|p=468}} After recording the music, Chaplin released ''Modern Times'' in February 1936.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=469–472, 474}} It was his first feature in 15 years to adopt political references and social realism,{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=150}} a factor that attracted considerable press coverage despite Chaplin's attempts to downplay the issue.{{sfn|Maland|1989|pp=144–147}} The film earned less at the box-office than his previous features and received mixed reviews, as some viewers disliked the politicising.{{sfnm|1a1=Maland|1y=1989|1p=157|2a1=Robinson|2p=473}} Today, ''Modern Times'' is seen by the British Film Institute as one of Chaplin's "great features,"&lt;ref name="bfi great features"/&gt; while David Robinson says it shows the filmmaker at "his unrivalled peak as a creator of visual comedy."{{sfn|Schneider|p=125}}

Following the release of ''Modern Times'', Chaplin left with Goddard for a trip to the Far East.{{sfn|Robinson|p=479}} The couple had refused to comment on the nature of their relationship, and it was not known whether they were married or not.{{sfn|Robinson|p=469}} Some time later, Chaplin revealed that they married in [[Guangzhou|Canton]] during this trip.{{sfn|Robinson|p=483}} By 1938, the couple had drifted apart, as both focused heavily on their work, although Goddard was again his leading lady in his next feature film, ''The Great Dictator''. She eventually divorced Chaplin in Mexico in 1942, citing incompatibility and separation for more than a year.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=509–510}}

===1939–1952: Controversies and fading popularity===
====''The Great Dictator''====
[[File:The Great Dictator still cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Chaplin satirising [[Adolf Hitler]] in ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940)]]

The 1940s saw Chaplin face a series of controversies, both in his work and in his personal life, which changed his fortunes and severely affected his popularity in the United States. The first of these was his growing boldness in expressing his political beliefs. Deeply disturbed by the [[Fascism#International impact of the Great Depression and the buildup to World War II|surge of militaristic nationalism]] in 1930s world politics,{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=485|2a1=Maland|2y=1989|2p=159}} Chaplin found that he could not keep these issues out of his work.{{sfn|Chaplin|p=386}}  Parallels between himself and [[Adolf Hitler]] had been widely noted: the pair were born four days apart, both had risen from poverty to world prominence, and Hitler wore the same [[toothbrush moustache]] as Chaplin. It was this physical resemblance that supplied the plot for Chaplin's next film, ''[[The Great Dictator]]'', which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism.{{sfnm|1a1=Schickel|1p=28|2a1=Maland|2y=1989|2pp=165, 170|3a1=Louvish|3p=271|4a1=Robinson|4p=490|5a1=Larcher|5p=67|6a1=Kemp|6p=158}}

Chaplin spent two years developing the script,{{sfn|Chaplin|p=388}} and began filming in September 1939 – six days after Britain declared war on Germany.{{sfn|Robinson|p=496}} He had submitted to using spoken dialogue, partly out of acceptance that he had no other choice, but also because he recognised it as a better method for delivering a political message.{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=165}} Making a comedy about Hitler was seen as highly controversial, but Chaplin's financial independence allowed him to take the risk.{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=164}} "I was determined to go ahead," he later wrote, "for Hitler must be laughed at."{{sfn|Chaplin|p=387}}{{refn|Chaplin later said that if he had known the extent of the Nazi Party's actions he would not have made the film; "Had I known the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made ''The Great Dictator''; I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis."{{sfn|Chaplin|p=388}}|group=note}} Chaplin replaced the Tramp (while wearing similar attire) with "A Jewish Barber", a reference to the Nazi party's belief that he was Jewish.{{refn|Speculation about Chaplin's racial origin existed from the earliest days of his fame, and it was often reported that he was a Jew. Research has uncovered no evidence of this, and when a reporter asked in 1915 if it was true, Chaplin responded, "I have not that good fortune." The Nazi Party believed that he was Jewish and banned ''The Gold Rush'' on this basis.

''The Great Dictator'' spent a year in production and was released in October 1940.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=505, 507}} The film generated a vast amount of publicity, with a critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'' calling it "the most eagerly awaited picture of the year", and it was one of the biggest money-makers of the era.{{sfn|Maland|1989|pp=169, 178–179}} The ending was unpopular, however, and generated controversy.{{sfnm|1a1=Maland|1y=1989|1p=176|2a1=Schickel|2pp=30–31}} Chaplin concluded the film with a five-minute speech in which he abandoned his barber character, looked directly into the camera, and pleaded against war and fascism.{{sfnm|1a1=Maland|1y=1989|1p=179–181|2a1=Louvish|2p=282|3a1=Robinson|3p=504}} Charles J.

====Legal troubles and Oona O'Neill====
In the mid-1940s, Chaplin was involved in a series of trials that occupied most of his time and significantly affected his public image.{{sfn|Maland|1989|pp=197–198}} The troubles stemmed from his affair with an aspirant actress named [[Joan Barry (American actress)|Joan Barry]], with whom he was involved intermittently between June 1941 and the autumn of 1942.{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=200}} Barry, who displayed obsessive behaviour and was twice arrested after they separated,{{refn|In December 1942, Barry broke into Chaplin's home with a handgun and threatened suicide while holding him at gunpoint. This lasted until the next morning, when Chaplin was able to get the gun from her. Barry broke into Chaplin's home a second time later that month, and he had her arrested. She was then prosecuted for [[wikt:vagrant|vagrancy]] in January 1943 – Barry had been unable to pay her hotel bills, and was found wandering the streets of Beverly Hills after taking an overdose of [[barbiturate]]s.{{sfn|Maland|1989|pp=198–201}}|group=note}} reappeared the following year and announced that she was pregnant with Chaplin's child. As Chaplin denied the claim, Barry filed a [[paternity suit]] against him.{{sfn|Maland|1989|pp=198–201}}

The director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), [[J. Edgar Hoover]], who had long been suspicious of Chaplin's political leanings, used the opportunity to generate negative publicity about him. As part of a [[smear campaign]] to damage Chaplin's image,{{sfn|Nowell-Smith|p=85}} the FBI named him in four [[indictment]]s related to the Barry case. Most serious of these was an alleged violation of the [[Mann Act]], which prohibits the transportation of women across state boundaries for sexual purposes.{{refn|According to the prosecutor, Chaplin had violated the act when he paid for Barry's trip to New York in October 1942, when he was also visiting the city. Both Chaplin and Barry agreed that they had met there briefly, and according to Barry, they had sexual intercourse.{{sfn|Maland|1989|pp=204–205}} Chaplin claimed that the last time he was intimate with Barry was May 1942.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=523–524}}|group=note}} The historian [[Otto Friedrich]] has called this an "absurd prosecution" of an "ancient statute",{{sfn|Friedrich|pp=190, 393}} yet if Chaplin was found guilty, he faced 23 years in jail.{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=215}} Three charges lacked sufficient evidence to proceed to court, but the Mann Act trial began in March 1944. Chaplin was [[acquittal|acquitted]] two weeks later.{{sfn|Maland|1989|pp=204–205}} The case was frequently headline news, with ''[[Newsweek]]'' calling it the "biggest public relations scandal since the [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]] murder trial in 1921."{{sfn|Maland|1989|pp=214–215}}

[[File:Oona O'Neill - 1943.jpg|upright|thumb|Chaplin's fourth wife [[Oona O'Neill]], to whom he was married from 1943 until his death. The couple had eight children.]]

Barry's child, Carol Ann, was born in October 1944, and the paternity suit went to court in February 1945. After two arduous trials, in which the prosecuting lawyer accused him of "[[moral turpitude]]",{{sfn|Louvish|p=xiii}} Chaplin was declared to be the father. Evidence from blood tests which indicated otherwise were not admissible{{refn|Carol Ann's [[blood group]] was B, Barry's was A, and Chaplin's was O. In California at this time, blood tests were not accepted as evidence in legal trials.{{sfn|Maland|1989|pp=205–206}}|group=note}}, and the judge ordered Chaplin to pay child support until Carol Ann turned 21. Media coverage of the paternity suit was influenced by the FBI, as information was fed to the prominent gossip columnist [[Hedda Hopper]], and Chaplin was portrayed in an overwhelmingly critical light.{{sfnm|1a1=Frost|1pp=74–88|2a1=Maland|2y=1989|2pp=207–213|3a1=Sbardellati and Shaw|3p=508|4a1=Friedrich|4p=393}}

The controversy surrounding Chaplin increased when, two weeks after the paternity suit was filed, it was announced that he had married his newest [[protégée]], 18-year-old [[Oona O'Neill]] – daughter of the American playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]].{{sfn|Louvish|p=135}} Chaplin, then 54, had been introduced to her by a film agent seven months earlier.{{refn|Chaplin and O'Neill met on 30 October 1942 and married on 16 June 1943 in [[Carpinteria, California]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chaplin|1pp=423–444|2a1=Robinson|2p=670}}  Eugene O'Neill disowned his daughter as a result.{{sfn|Sheaffer|pp=623, 658}}|group=note}} In his autobiography, Chaplin described meeting O'Neill as "the happiest event of my life", and claimed to have found "perfect love".{{sfn|Chaplin|pp=423, 477}} Chaplin's son, Charles Jr., reported that Oona "worshipped" his father.{{sfn|Robinson|p=519}} The couple remained married until Chaplin's death, and had eight children over 18 years: [[Geraldine Chaplin|Geraldine Leigh]] (b. July 1944), [[Michael Chaplin (actor)|Michael John]] (b. March 1946), [[Josephine Chaplin|Josephine Hannah]] (b. March 1949), [[Victoria Chaplin|Victoria]] (b. May 1951), [[Eugene Chaplin|Eugene Anthony]] (b. August 1953), Jane Cecil (b. May 1957), Annette Emily (b. December 1959), and [[Christopher Chaplin|Christopher James]] (b. July 1962).{{sfn|Robinson|pp=671–675}}

====''Monsieur Verdoux'' and communist accusations====
[[File:Monsieur Verdoux poster.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]'' (1947), a dark comedy about a serial killer, marked a significant departure for Chaplin. He was so unpopular at the time of release that it flopped in the United States.]]

Chaplin claimed that the Barry trials had "crippled [his] creativeness", and it was some time before he began working again.{{sfn|Chaplin|p=426}} In April 1946, he finally began filming a project that had been in development since 1942.{{sfn|Robinson|p=520}} ''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]'' was a [[black comedy]], the story of a French bank clerk, Verdoux (Chaplin), who loses his job and begins marrying and murdering wealthy widows to support his family. Chaplin's inspiration for the project came from [[Orson Welles]], who wanted him to star in a film about the French [[serial killer]] [[Henri Désiré Landru]]. Chaplin decided that the concept would "make a wonderful comedy",{{sfn|Chaplin|p=412}} and paid Welles $5,000 for the idea.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=519–520}}

Chaplin again vocalised his political views in ''Monsieur Verdoux'', criticising [[capitalism]] and arguing that the world encourages mass killing through wars and [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]].{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1p=304|2a1=Sbardellati and Shaw|2p=501}} Because of this, the film met with controversy when it was released in April 1947;{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1pp=296–297|2a1=Robinson|2pp=538–543|3a1=Larcher|3p=77}} Chaplin was booed at the premiere, and there were calls for a boycott.{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1pp=296–297|2a1=Sbardellati and Shaw|2p=503}} ''Monsieur Verdoux'' was the first Chaplin release that failed both critically and commercially in the United States.{{sfn|Maland|1989|pp=235–245, 250}} It was more successful abroad,{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=250}} and Chaplin's screenplay was nominated at the [[20th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]].{{sfn|Louvish|p=297}} He was proud of the film, writing in his autobiography, "''Monsieur Verdoux'' is the cleverest and most brilliant film I have yet made."{{sfn|Chaplin|p=444}}

The negative reaction to ''Monsieur Verdoux'' was largely the result of changes in Chaplin's public image.{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=251}} Along with damage of the Joan Barry scandal, he was publicly accused of being a [[communist]].{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=538–539|2a1=Friedrich|2p=287}} His political activity had heightened during World War II, when he campaigned for the opening of a Second Front to help the [[Soviet Union]] and supported various Soviet–American friendship groups.{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=253}} He was also friendly with several suspected communists, and attended functions given by Soviet diplomats in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Maland|1989|pp=221–226, 253–254}} In the political climate of 1940s America, such activities meant Chaplin was considered, as Larcher writes, "dangerously [[progressivism|progressive]] and amoral."{{sfnm|1a1=Larcher|1p=75|2a1=Sbardellati and Shaw|2p=506|3a1=Louvish|3p=xiii}} The FBI wanted him out of the country,{{sfn|Sbardellati|p=152}} and launched an official investigation in early 1947.{{sfn|Maland|1989|pp=265–266}}{{refn|Chaplin had already attracted the attention of the FBI long before the 1940s, the first mention of him in their files being from 1922. J. Edgar Hoover first requested that a Security Index Card be filed for Chaplin in September 1946, but the Los Angeles office was slow to react and only began active investigation the next spring.{{sfn|Maland|1989|pp=265–266}} The FBI also requested and received help from [[MI5]], particularly on investigating the false claims that Chaplin had not been born in England but in France or Eastern Europe, and that his real name was Israel Thornstein. The MI5 found no evidence of Chaplin being involved in the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Norton-Taylor |first=Richard |date=17 February 2012 |title=MI5 Spied on Charlie Chaplin after the FBI Asked for Help to Banish Him from US |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/feb/17/mi5-spied-on-charlie-chaplin |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=17 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKhi5Htg?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2009/nov/05/charlie-chaplin-ebay-reel-tin |archivedate=18 November 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

Chaplin denied being a communist, instead calling himself a "peacemonger",{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1pp=xiv, 310|2a1=Chaplin|2p=458|3a1=Maland|3y=1989|3p=238}} but felt the government's effort to suppress the ideology was an unacceptable infringement of [[civil liberties]].{{sfn|Robinson|p=544}} Unwilling to be quiet about the issue, he openly protested against the trials of [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] members and the activities of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]].{{sfn|Maland|1989|pp=255–256}} Chaplin received a [[subpoena]] to appear before HUAC but was not called to testify.{{sfnm|1a1=Friedrich|1p=286|2a1=Maland|2y=1989|2p=261}} As his activities were widely reported in the press, and [[Cold War]] fears grew, questions were raised over his failure to take American citizenship.{{sfnm|1a1=Larcher|1p=80|2a1=Sbardellati and Shaw|2p=510|3a1=Louvish|3p=xiii|4a1=Robinson|4p=545}} Calls were made for him to be deported; in one extreme and widely published example, Representative [[John E. Rankin]], who helped establish HUAC, told [[United States Congress|Congress]] in June 1947: "[Chaplin's] very life in Hollywood is detrimental to the moral fabric of America. [If he is deported]&amp;nbsp;... his loathsome pictures can be kept from before the eyes of the American youth. He should be deported and gotten rid of at once."{{sfn|Robinson|p=545}}

====''Limelight'' and banning from the United States====
[[File:Limelight promo crop.jpg|thumb|''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' (1952) was a serious and autobiographical film for Chaplin: his character, Calvero, is an ex [[music hall]] star (described in this image as a "Tramp Comedian") forced to deal with his loss of popularity.]]

Although Chaplin remained politically active in the years following the failure of ''Monsieur Verdoux'',{{refn|In November 1947, Chaplin asked [[Pablo Picasso]] to hold a demonstration outside the US embassy in Paris to protest the deportation proceedings of Hanns Eisler, and in December, he took part in a petition asking for the deportation process to be dropped. In 1948, Chaplin supported the unsuccessful presidential campaign of [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]]; and in 1949 he supported two peace conferences and signed a petition protesting the [[Peekskill Riots|Peekskill incident]].{{sfn|Maland|1989|pp=256–257}}|group=note}} his next film, about a forgotten vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] London, was devoid of political themes. ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplin's childhood and the lives of his parents, but also to his loss of popularity in the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Maland|1y=1989|1pp=288–290|2a1=Robinson|2pp=551–552|3a1=Louvish|3p=312}} The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=293}}

Filming began in November 1951, by which time Chaplin had spent three years working on the story.{{sfn|Louvish|p=317}}{{refn|''Limelight'' was conceived as a novel, which Chaplin wrote but never intended for publication.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=549–570}}|group=note}} He aimed for a more serious tone than any of his previous films, regularly using the word "melancholy" when explaining his plans to his co-star [[Claire Bloom]].{{sfn|Robinson|p=562}} ''Limelight'' featured a cameo appearance from [[Buster Keaton]], whom Chaplin cast as his stage partner in a pantomime scene. This marked the only time the comedians worked together.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=567–568}}

Chaplin decided to hold the world premiere of ''Limelight'' in London, since it was the setting of the film.{{sfn|Louvish|p=326}} As he left Los Angeles, he expressed a premonition that he would not be returning.{{sfn|Robinson|p=570}} At New York, he boarded the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}} with his family on 18 September 1952.{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=280}} The next day, [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]] [[James P. McGranery]] revoked Chaplin's [[re-entry permit]] and stated that he would have to submit to an interview concerning his political views and moral behaviour in order to re-enter the US.{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=280}} Although McGranery told the press that he had "a pretty good case against Chaplin", Maland has concluded, on the basis of the FBI files that were released in the 1980s, that the US government had no real evidence to prevent Chaplin's re-entry. It is likely that he would have gained entry if he had applied for it.{{sfnm|1a1=Maland|1y=1989|1pp=280–287|2a1=Sbardellati and Shaw|2pp=520–521}} However, when Chaplin received a cablegram informing him of the news, he privately decided to cut his ties with the United States:

{{quote|Whether I re-entered that unhappy country or not was of little consequence to me. I would like to have told them that the sooner I was rid of that hate-beleaguered atmosphere the better, that I was fed up of America's insults and moral pomposity...{{sfn|Chaplin|p=455}}}}

Because all of his property remained in America, Chaplin refrained from saying anything negative about the incident to the press.{{sfn|Robinson|p=573}} The scandal attracted vast attention,{{sfn|Louvish|p=330}} but Chaplin and his film were warmly received in Europe.{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=280}} In America, the hostility towards him continued, and, although it received some positive reviews, ''Limelight'' was subjected to a wide-scale boycott.{{sfn|Maland|1989|pp=295–298, 307–311}} Reflecting on this, Maland writes that Chaplin's fall, from an "unprecedented" level of popularity, "may be the most dramatic in the history of stardom in America".{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=189}}

[[File:ManoirdeBan.jpg|thumb|[[Manoir de Ban]], Chaplin's home in [[Corsier-sur-Vevey]], Switzerland]]

Chaplin remained a controversial figure throughout the 1950s, especially after he was awarded the [[World Peace Council prizes|International Peace Prize]] by the communist-led [[World Peace Council]], and after his meetings with [[Zhou Enlai]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]].{{sfnm|1a1=Maland|1y=1989|1p=318|2a1=Robinson|2p=584}} He began developing his first European film, ''[[A King in New York]]'', in 1954.{{sfn|Robinson|p=585}} Casting himself as an exiled king who seeks asylum in the United States, Chaplin included several of his recent experiences in the screenplay. His son, Michael, was cast as a boy whose parents are targeted by the FBI, while Chaplin's character faces accusations of communism.{{sfn|Louvish|pp=xiv–xv}} The political satire parodied HUAC and attacked elements of 1950s culture – including consumerism, plastic surgery, and wide-screen cinema.{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1p=341|2a1=Maland|2y=1989|2pp=320–321|3a1=Robinson|3pp=588–589|4a1=Larcher|4pp=89–90}} In a review, the playwright [[John Osborne]] called it Chaplin's "most bitter" and "most openly personal" film.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=587–589}}

Chaplin founded a new production company, Attica, and used [[Shepperton Studios]] for the shooting.{{sfn|Robinson|p=585}} Filming in England proved a difficult experience, as he was used to his own Hollywood studio and familiar crew, and no longer had limitless production time. According to Robinson, this had an effect on the quality of the film.{{sfnm|1a1=Epstein|1p=137|2a1=Robinson|2p=587}} ''A King in New York'' was released in September 1957, and received mixed reviews.{{sfnm|1a1=Lynn|1p=506|2a1=Louvish|2p=342|3a1=Maland|3y=1989|3p=322}} Chaplin banned American journalists from its Paris première and decided not to release the film in the United States. This severely limited its revenue, although it achieved moderate commercial success in Europe.{{sfn|Robinson|p=591}} ''A King in New York'' was not shown in America until 1973.{{sfn|Louvish|p=347}}{{sfn|Vance|2003|p=329}}

====Final works and renewed appreciation====
[[File:Chaplin family 1961.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Chaplin with his wife Oona and six of their children in 1961]]

In the last two decades of his career, Chaplin concentrated on re-editing and scoring his old films for re-release, along with securing their ownership and distribution rights.{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=326}} In an interview he granted in 1959, the year of his 70th birthday, Chaplin stated that there was still "room for the Little Man in the atomic age".{{sfn|Robinson|pp=594–595}} The first of these re-releases was ''[[The Chaplin Revue]]'' (1959), which included new versions of ''A Dog's Life'', ''Shoulder Arms'', and ''The Pilgrim''.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=594–595}}

In America, the political atmosphere began to change and attention was once again directed to Chaplin's films instead of his views.{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=326}} In July 1962, ''The New York Times'' published an editorial stating that "we do not believe the Republic would be in danger if yesterday's unforgotten little tramp were allowed to amble down the gangplank of a steamer or plane in an American port".{{sfn|Lynn|pp=507–508}} The same month, Chaplin was invested with the [[honorary degree]] of [[Doctor of Letters]] by the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[Durham University|Durham]].{{sfn|Robinson|pp=598–599}} In November 1963, the Plaza Theater in New York started a year-long series of Chaplin's films, including ''Monsieur Verdoux'' and ''Limelight'', which gained excellent reviews from American critics.{{sfnm|1a1=Lynn|1p=509|2a1=Maland|2y=1989|2p=330}} September 1964 saw the release of Chaplin's memoirs, ''[[My Autobiography (Chaplin)|My Autobiography]]'', which he had been working on since 1957.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=602–605}} The 500-page book, which focused on his early years and personal life, became a worldwide best-seller, despite criticism over the lack of information on his film career.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=605–607|2a1=Lynn|2pp=510–512}}

Shortly after the publication of his memoirs, Chaplin began work on ''[[A Countess from Hong Kong]]'' (1967), a romantic comedy based on a script he had written for Paulette Goddard in the 1930s.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=608–609}} Set on an ocean liner, it starred [[Marlon Brando]] as an American ambassador and [[Sophia Loren]] as a stowaway found in his cabin.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=608–609}} The film differed from Chaplin's earlier productions in several aspects. It was his first to use [[Technicolor]] and the [[widescreen]] format, while he concentrated on directing and appeared on-screen only in a cameo role as a seasick steward.{{sfn|Robinson|p=612}} He also signed a deal with [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] and appointed his assistant, Jerome Epstein, as the producer.{{sfn|Robinson|p=607}} Chaplin was paid $600,000 director's fee as well as a percentage of the gross receipts.{{sfn|Vance|2003|p=330}} ''A Countess from Hong Kong'' premiered in January 1967, to unfavourable reviews, and was a box-office failure.{{sfn|Epstein|pp=192–196}}{{sfnm|1a1=Lynn|1p=518|2a1=Maland|2y=1989|2p=335}} Chaplin was deeply hurt by the negative reaction to the film, which turned out to be his last.{{sfn|Epstein|pp=192–196}}

Chaplin suffered a series of minor strokes in the late 1960s, which marked the beginning of a slow decline in his health.{{sfn|Robinson|p=619}} Despite the setbacks, he was soon writing a new film script, ''[[The Freak]]'', a story of a winged girl found in South America, which he intended as a starring vehicle for his daughter, Victoria.{{sfn|Robinson|p=619}} His fragile health prevented the project from being realised.{{sfn|Epstein|p=203}} In the early 1970s, Chaplin concentrated on re-releasing his old films, including ''The Kid'' and ''The Circus''.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=620–621}} In 1971, he was made a [[Legion of Honour|Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].{{sfn|Robinson|p=621}} The following year, he was honoured with a special award by the [[Venice Film Festival]].{{sfn|Robinson|p=625}}

In 1972, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] offered Chaplin an Honorary Award, which Robinson sees as a sign that America "wanted to make amends". Chaplin was initially hesitant about accepting but decided to return to the US for the first time in 20 years.{{sfn|Robinson|p=621}} The visit attracted a large amount of press coverage and, at the Academy Awards gala, he was given a twelve-minute standing ovation, the longest in the Academy's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/charlie-chaplin-prepares-for-return-to-united-states-after-two-decades |title=Charlie Chaplin Prepares for Return to United States after Two Decades |publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks |accessdate=7 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKhzGYBk?url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/charlie-chaplin-prepares-for-return-to-united-states-after-two-decades |archivedate=18 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=347}} Visibly emotional, Chaplin accepted his award for "the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century".{{sfn|Robinson|pp=623–625}}

====Death====
[[File:Charles Chaplin Grave in Corsier-sur-Vevey.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Chaplin's grave in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland]]
By October 1977, Chaplin's health had declined to the point that he needed constant care.{{sfn|Robinson|p=629}} In the early morning of 25 December 1977, Chaplin died at home after suffering a stroke in his sleep.&lt;ref name="EugeneChaplin"/&gt; He was 88 years old.

==Filmmaking==
===Influences===
Chaplin believed his first influence to be his mother, who entertained him as a child by sitting at the window and mimicking passers-by: "it was through watching her that I learned not only how to express emotions with my hands and face, but also how to observe and study people."{{sfn|Robinson|p=18}} Chaplin's early years in music hall allowed him to see stage comedians at work; he also attended the Christmas pantomimes at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]], where he studied the art of clowning through performers like [[Dan Leno]].{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=71–72|2a1=Chaplin|2pp=47–48|3a1=Weissman |3y=2009|3pp=82–83, 88}}  Chaplin's years with the Fred Karno company had a formative effect on him as an actor and filmmaker. Simon Louvish writes that the company was his "training ground",{{sfn|Louvish|p=38}} and it was here that Chaplin learned to vary the pace of his comedy.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=86–87}} The concept of mixing pathos with slapstick was learnt from Karno,{{refn|[[Stan Laurel]], Chaplin's co-performer at the company, remembered that Karno's sketches regularly inserted "a bit of sentiment right in the middle of a funny music hall turn."{{sfn|Robinson|pp=86–87}}|group=note}} who also used elements of absurdity that became familiar in Chaplin's gags.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=86–87}}&lt;ref&gt;A round-table [http://www.nrk.no/skole/?page=search&amp;mediaId=14092 Chaplin Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828075402/https://www.nrk.no/skole/?page=search&amp;mediaId=14092 |date=28 August 2016 }} in 1952, first broadcast on BBC Radio on 15 October 1952. (In Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; From the film industry, Chaplin drew upon the work of the French comedian [[Max Linder]], whose films he greatly admired.{{sfnm|1a1=Lynn|1pp=99–100|2a1=Brownlow|2p=22|3a1=Louvish|3p=122}} In developing the Tramp costume and persona, he was likely inspired by the American vaudeville scene, where tramp characters were common.{{sfn|Louvish|pp=48–49}}

===Method===
[[File:Chaplin Studios postcard.jpg|thumb|A 1922 image of [[Charlie Chaplin Studios]], where all of Chaplin's films between 1918 and 1952 were produced]]

Chaplin never spoke more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, claiming such a thing would be tantamount to a magician spoiling his own illusion.{{sfn|Robinson|p=606}} Little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime,{{sfn|Brownlow|p=7}} but research from film historians – particularly the findings of [[Kevin Brownlow]] and [[David Gill (film historian)|David Gill]] that were presented in the three-part documentary ''[[Unknown Chaplin]]'' (1983) – has since revealed his unique working method.{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1p=103|2a1=Robinson|2p=168}}

Until he began making spoken dialogue films with ''The Great Dictator'', Chaplin never shot from a completed script.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=173, 197, 310, 489}} Many of his early films began with only a vague premise – for example "Charlie enters a health spa" or "Charlie works in a pawn shop."{{sfn|Robinson|p=169}} He then had sets constructed and worked with his stock company to improvise gags and "business" using them, almost always working the ideas out on film.{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1p=103|2a1=Robinson|2p=168}} As ideas were accepted and discarded, a narrative structure would emerge, frequently requiring Chaplin to reshoot an already-completed scene that might have otherwise contradicted the story.{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1p=168|2a1=Robinson|2pp=166–170, 489–490|3a1=Brownlow|3p=187}} From ''A Woman of Paris'' onward Chaplin began the filming process with a prepared plot,{{sfn|Louvish|p=182}} but Robinson writes that every film up to ''Modern Times'' "went through many metamorphoses and permutations before the story took its final form."{{sfn|Robinson|p=460}}

Producing films in this manner meant Chaplin took longer to complete his pictures than almost any other filmmaker at the time.{{sfn|Louvish|p=228}} If he was out of ideas, he often took a break from the shoot, which could last for days, while keeping the studio ready for when inspiration returned.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=234–235|2a1=Cousins|2p=71}} Delaying the process further was Chaplin's rigorous perfectionism.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=172, 177, 235, 311, 381, 399|2a1=Brownlow|2pp=59, 75, 82, 92, 147}} According to his friend [[Ivor Montagu]], "nothing but perfection would be right" for the filmmaker.{{sfn|Brownlow|p=82}} Because he personally funded his films, Chaplin was at liberty to strive for this goal and shoot as many takes as he wished.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=235, 311, 223|2a1=Brownlow|2p=82}} The number was often excessive, for instance 53 takes for every finished take in ''The Kid''.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=746|2a1=Maland|2y=1989|2p=359}} For ''The Immigrant'', a 20 minute-short, Chaplin shot 40,000 feet of film – enough for a feature-length.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=201|2a1=Brownlow|2p=192}}

{{Quote box

}}

Describing his working method as "sheer perseverance to the point of madness",{{sfn|Louvish|p=225}} Chaplin would be completely consumed by the production of a picture.{{sfnm|1a1=Brownlow|1p=157|2a1=Robinson|2pp=121, 469}} Robinson writes that even in Chaplin's later years, his work continued "to take precedence over everything and everyone else."{{sfn|Robinson|p=600}} The combination of story improvisation and relentless perfectionism – which resulted in days of effort and thousands of feet of film being wasted, all at enormous expense – often proved taxing for Chaplin who, in frustration, would lash out at his actors and crew.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=371, 362, 469, 613|2a1=Brownlow|2pp=56, 136|3a1=Schickel|3p=8}}

Chaplin exercised complete control over his pictures,{{sfn|Robinson|p=606}} to the extent that he would act out the other roles for his cast, expecting them to imitate him exactly.{{sfnm|1a1=Bloom|1p=101|2a1=Brownlow|2pp=59, 98, 138, 154|3a1=Robinson|3p=614}}  He personally edited all of his films, trawling through the large amounts of footage to create the exact picture he wanted.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=140, 235, 236}} As a result of his complete independence, he was identified by the film historian [[Andrew Sarris]] as one of the first [[Auteurism|auteur]] filmmakers.{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=353}} Chaplin did receive help, notably from his long-time cinematographer [[Roland Totheroh]], brother Sydney Chaplin, and various [[assistant director]]s such as [[Harry Crocker]] and [[Charles Reisner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chaplin.bfi.org.uk/programme/essays/collaborators.html |title=Chaplin's Writing and Directing Collaborators |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=27 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214092650/http://chaplin.bfi.org.uk/programme/essays/collaborators.html |archivedate=14 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style and themes===
[[File:The Kid scenes.ogv|thumb|upright=1.15|A collection of scenes from ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'' (1921), demonstrating Chaplin's mixture of slapstick, pathos, and social commentary]]

While Chaplin's comedic style is broadly defined as [[slapstick]],{{sfn|Robinson|p=212}} it is considered restrained and intelligent,{{sfn|Brownlow|p=30}} with the film historian Philip Kemp describing his work as a mix of "deft, balletic physical comedy and thoughtful, situation-based gags".{{sfn|Kemp|p=63}} Chaplin diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing the pace and exhausting each scene of its comic potential, with more focus on developing the viewer's relationship to the characters.{{sfn|Robinson|p=113}}{{sfn|Mast|pp=83–92}} Unlike conventional slapstick comedies, Robinson states that the comic moments in Chaplin's films centre on the Tramp's attitude to the things happening to him: the humour does not come from the Tramp bumping into a tree, but from his lifting his hat to the tree in apology.{{sfn|Robinson|p=113}} Dan Kamin writes that Chaplin's "quirky mannerisms" and "serious demeanour in the midst of slapstick action" are other key aspects of his comedy,{{sfn|Kamin|pp=6–7}} while the surreal transformation of objects and the employment of [[In-camera effect|in-camera]] trickery are also common features.{{sfnm|1a1=Mast|1pp=83–92|2a1=Kamin|2pp=33–34}}

Chaplin's silent films typically follow the Tramp's efforts to survive in a hostile world.{{sfn|Louvish|p=60}} The character lives in poverty and is frequently treated badly, but remains kind and upbeat;{{sfnm|1a1=Kemp|1p=63|2a1=Robinson|2pp=211, 352|3a1=Hansmeyer|3p=4}} defying his social position, he strives to be seen as a gentleman.{{sfn|Robinson|p=203}} As Chaplin said in 1925, "The whole point of the Little Fellow is that no matter how down on his ass he is, no matter how well the jackals succeed in tearing him apart, he's still a man of dignity."{{sfn|Weissman|2009|p=47}} The Tramp defies authority figures{{sfn|Dale|p=17}} and "gives as good as he gets",{{sfn|Weissman|2009|p=47}} leading Robinson and Louvish to see him as a representative for the underprivileged – an "[[everyman]] turned heroic saviour".{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=455, 485|2a1=Louvish|2p=138|2ps= (for quote).}} Hansmeyer notes that several of Chaplin's films end with "the homeless and lonely Tramp [walking] optimistically&amp;nbsp;... into the sunset&amp;nbsp;... to continue his journey".{{sfn|Hansmeyer|p=4}}

{{Quote box
|bgcolor=#E0E6F8
 |quote = "It is paradoxical that tragedy stimulates the spirit of ridicule&amp;nbsp;... ridicule, I suppose, is an attitude of defiance; we must laugh in the face of our helplessness against the forces of nature – or go insane."{{sfn|Robinson|pp=334–335}}

}}

The infusion of [[pathos]] is a well-known aspect of Chaplin's work,{{sfnm|1a1=Dale|1pp=9, 19, 20|2a1=Louvish|2p=203}} and Larcher notes his reputation for "[inducing] laughter and tears".{{sfn|Larcher|p=75}} Sentimentality in his films comes from a variety of sources, with Louvish pinpointing "personal failure, society's strictures, economic disaster, and the elements."{{sfn|Louvish|p=204}} Chaplin sometimes drew on tragic events when creating his films, as in the case of ''The Gold Rush'' (1925), which was inspired by the fate of the Donner Party.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=334–335}} Constance B. Kuriyama has identified serious underlying themes in the early comedies, such as greed (''The Gold Rush'') and loss (''The Kid'').{{sfn|Kuriyama|p=31}} Chaplin also touched on controversial issues: immigration (''The Immigrant'', 1917); illegitimacy (''The Kid'', 1921); and drug use (''Easy Street'', 1917).{{sfn|Mast|pp=83–92}} He often explored these topics ironically, making comedy out of suffering.{{sfn|Louvish|pp=137, 145}}

Social commentary was a feature of Chaplin's films from early in his career, as he portrayed the underdog in a sympathetic light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor.{{sfn|Robinson|p=599}} Later, as he developed a keen interest in economics and felt obliged to publicise his views,{{sfn|Robinson|p=456}} Chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films.{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=159}} ''Modern Times'' (1936) depicted factory workers in dismal conditions, ''The Great Dictator'' (1940) parodied [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] and ended in a speech against nationalism, ''Monsieur Verdoux'' (1947) criticised war and capitalism, and ''A King in New York'' (1957) attacked [[McCarthyism]].{{sfn|Larcher|pp=62–89}}

Several of Chaplin's films incorporate autobiographical elements, and the psychologist [[Sigmund Freud]] believed that Chaplin "always plays only himself as he was in his dismal youth".{{sfn|Weissman|1999|pp=439–445}} ''The Kid'' is thought to reflect Chaplin's childhood trauma of being sent into an orphanage,{{sfn|Weissman|1999|pp=439–445}} the main characters in ''Limelight'' (1952) contain elements from the lives of his parents,{{sfn|Bloom|p=107}} and ''A King in New York'' references Chaplin's experiences of being shunned by the United States.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=588–589}} Many of his sets, especially in street scenes, bear a strong similarity to Kennington, where he grew up. [[Stephen M. Weissman]] has argued that Chaplin's problematic relationship with his mentally ill mother was often reflected in his female characters and the Tramp's desire to save them.{{sfn|Weissman|1999|pp=439–445}}

Regarding the structure of Chaplin's films, the scholar [[Gerald Mast]] sees them as consisting of sketches tied together by the same theme and setting, rather than having a tightly unified storyline.{{sfn|Mast|pp=123–128}} Visually, his films are simple and economic,{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1p=298|2a1=Robinson|2p=592}} with scenes portrayed as if set on a stage.{{sfnm|1a1=Epstein|1pp=84–85|2a1=Mast|2pp=83–92|3a1=Louvish|3p=185}} His approach to filming was described by the art director [[Eugène Lourié]]: "Chaplin did not think in 'artistic' images when he was shooting. He believed that action is the main thing. The camera is there to photograph the actors".{{sfn|Robinson|p=565}} In his autobiography, Chaplin wrote, "Simplicity is best&amp;nbsp;... pompous effects slow up action, are boring and unpleasant&amp;nbsp;... The camera should not intrude."{{sfn|Chaplin|p=250}}  This approach has prompted criticism, since the 1940s, for being "old fashioned",{{sfnm|1a1=Brownlow|1p=91|2a1=Louvish|2p=298|3a1=Kamin|3p=35}} while the film scholar Donald McCaffrey sees it as an indication that Chaplin never completely understood film as a medium.{{sfn|McCaffrey|pp=82–95}} Kamin, however, comments that Chaplin's comedic talent would not be enough to remain funny on screen if he did not have an "ability to conceive and direct scenes specifically for the film medium".{{sfn|Kamin|p=29}}

===Composing===
[[File:Charlie Chaplin playing the cello 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|Chaplin playing the cello in 1915]]

Chaplin developed a passion for music as a child and taught himself to play the piano, violin, and cello.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=411|2a1=Louvish|2pp=17–18}} He considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important,{{sfn|Robinson|pp=382}} and from ''A Woman of Paris'' onwards he took an increasing interest in this area.{{sfn|Robinson|p=411}} With the advent of sound technology, Chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack – composed by himself – for ''City Lights'' (1931). He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950s to his death, he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films.{{sfn|Vance|2000|p=xiii}}

As Chaplin was not a trained musician, he could not read sheet music and needed the help of professional composers, such as [[David Raksin]], [[Raymond Rasch]] and [[Eric James (arranger)|Eric James]], when creating his scores. Musical directors were employed to oversee the recording process, such as [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]] for ''City Lights''.{{sfn|Slowik|p=133}} Although some critics have claimed that credit for his film music should be given to the composers who worked with him, Raksin – who worked with Chaplin on ''Modern Times'' – stressed Chaplin's creative position and active participation in the composing process.{{sfn|Raksin and Berg|pp=47–50}} This process, which could take months, would start with Chaplin describing to the composer(s) exactly what he wanted and singing or playing tunes he had improvised on the piano.{{sfn|Raksin and Berg|pp=47–50}} These tunes were then developed further in a close collaboration among the composer(s) and Chaplin.{{sfn|Raksin and Berg|pp=47–50}} According to film historian [[Jeffrey Vance]], "although he relied upon associates to arrange varied and complex instrumentation, the musical imperative is his, and not a note in a Chaplin musical score was placed there without his assent."&lt;ref name="VarietyVance"&gt;Vance, Jeffrey (4 August 2003). "Chaplin the Composer: An Excerpt from Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema". ''Variety'' Special Advertising Supplement, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaplin's compositions produced three popular songs. "[[Smile (Charlie Chaplin song)|Smile]]", composed originally for ''Modern Times'' (1936) and later set to lyrics by [[John Turner (lyricist)|John Turner]] and [[Geoffrey Parsons (lyricist)|Geoffrey Parsons]], was a hit for [[Nat King Cole]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="VarietyVance"/&gt; For ''Limelight'', Chaplin composed "Terry's Theme", which was popularised by [[Jimmy Young (broadcaster)|Jimmy Young]] as "[[Eternally (Charles Chaplin song)|Eternally]]" (1952).{{sfn|Kamin|p=198}} Finally, "[[This Is My Song (1967 song)|This Is My Song]]", performed by [[Petula Clark]] for ''A Countess from Hong Kong'' (1967), reached number one on the UK and other European charts.&lt;ref&gt;Hennessy, Mike (22 April 1967). "Chaplin's 'Song' Catches Fire in Europe". ''Billboard'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaplin also received his only competitive Oscar for his composition work, as the ''Limelight'' theme won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] in 1973 following the film's re-release.&lt;ref name="VarietyVance"/&gt;{{refn|Although the film had originally been released in 1952, it did not play for one week in Los Angeles because of its boycott, and thus did not meet the criterion for nomination until it was re-released in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weston |first=Jay |title=Charlie Chaplin's Limelight at the Academy After 60 Years |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-weston/charlie-chaplin-limelight_b_1938236.html |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=10 April 2012 |accessdate=2 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513093513/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-weston/charlie-chaplin-limelight_b_1938236.html |archivedate=13 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

In 1998, the film critic [[Andrew Sarris]] called Chaplin "arguably the single most important artist produced by the cinema, certainly its most extraordinary performer and probably still its most universal icon".{{sfn|Sarris|p=139}} He is described by the British Film Institute as "a towering figure in world culture",&lt;ref name="BFIChaplinproject"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chaplin.bfi.org.uk/ |title=Charlie Chaplin |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=7 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622161153/http://chaplin.bfi.org.uk/ |archivedate=22 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was included in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of the "[[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 Most Important People of the 20th Century]]" for the "laughter [he brought] to millions" and because he "more or less invented global recognizability and helped turn an industry into an art".&lt;ref name="time 100"&gt;{{cite news|title=TIME 100: Charlie Chaplin|url= http://www.time.com/time/time100/artists/profile/chaplin.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110523194732/http://www.time.com/time/time100/artists/profile/chaplin.html|archivedate=23 May 2011|publisher=Time Magazine|first=Joshua|last=Quittner|date=8 June 1998|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image of the Tramp has become a part of cultural history;{{sfn|Hansmeyer|p=3}} according to Simon Louvish, the character is recognisable to people who have never seen a Chaplin film, and in places where his films are never shown.{{sfn|Louvish|p=xvii}} The critic [[Leonard Maltin]] has written of the "unique" and "indelible" nature of the Tramp, and argued that no other comedian matched his "worldwide impact".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/leonardmaltin/chaplinfirst_last_and_always |title=Chaplin – First, Last, And Always |publisher=Indiewire |website= |accessdate=7 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525165601/http://blogs.indiewire.com/leonardmaltin/chaplinfirst_last_and_always# |archivedate=25 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Praising the character, [[Richard Schickel]] suggests that Chaplin's films with the Tramp contain the most "eloquent, richly comedic expressions of the human spirit" in movie history.{{sfn|Schickel|p=41}} Memorabilia connected to the character still fetches large sums in auctions: in 2006 a bowler hat and a bamboo cane that were part of the Tramp's costume were bought for $140,000 in a Los Angeles auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5116474.stm |title=Record Price for Chaplin Hat Set |publisher=BBC |work= |accessdate=7 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423104143/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5116474.stm |archivedate=23 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a filmmaker, Chaplin is considered a pioneer and one of the most influential figures of the early twentieth century.{{sfnm|1a1=Cousins|1p=72|2a1=Kemp|2pp=8, 22|3a1=Gunning|3p=41|4a1=Sarris|4p=139|5a1=Hansmeyer|5p=3}} He is often credited as one of the medium's first artists.{{sfnm|1a1=Schickel|1pp=3–4|2a1=Cousins|2p=36|3a1=Robinson|3pp=209–211|4a1=Kamin|4p=xiv}} Film historian [[Mark Cousins (film critic)|Mark Cousins]] has written that Chaplin "changed not only the imagery of cinema, but also its sociology and grammar" and claims that Chaplin was as important to the development of comedy as a genre as [[D. W. Griffith|D.W. Griffith]] was to drama.{{sfn|Cousins|p=70}} He was the first to popularise feature-length comedy and to slow down the pace of action, adding pathos and subtlety to it.{{sfn|Schickel|pp=7, 13}}&lt;ref name="silent clowns"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Charlie Chaplin|series=Silent Clowns|credits=Presented by [[Paul Merton]], directed by Tom Cholmondeley|network=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|station=[[BBC Four]]|date=1 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his work is mostly classified as slapstick, Chaplin's drama ''A Woman of Paris'' (1923) was a major influence on [[Ernst Lubitsch]]'s film ''[[The Marriage Circle]]'' (1924) and thus played a part in the development of "sophisticated comedy".{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1pp=398–399|2a1=Robinson|2p=321|3a1=Louvish|3p=185}} According to David Robinson, Chaplin's innovations were "rapidly assimilated to become part of the common practice of film craft."{{sfn|Robinson|p=321}} Filmmakers who cited Chaplin as an influence include [[Federico Fellini]] (who called Chaplin "a sort of [[Adam]], from whom we are all descended"),{{sfn|Robinson|p=632}} [[Jacques Tati]] ("Without him I would never have made a film"),{{sfn|Robinson|p=632}} René Clair ("He inspired practically every filmmaker"),{{sfn|Robinson|p=631}} [[Michael Powell]],{{sfn|Brownlow|p=77}} [[Billy Wilder]],&lt;ref name="story of film"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Episode 2|series=[[The Story of Film: An Odyssey]]|credits=[[Mark Cousins (film critic)|Mark Cousins]]|network=[[Channel 4]]|station=[[More4]]|date=10 September 2011|time=27:51–28:35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vittorio De Sica]],{{sfn|Cardullo|pp=16, 212}} and [[Richard Attenborough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attenborough Introduction |url=http://chaplin.bfi.org.uk/programme/attenborough.html |work=Charlie Chaplin |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=11 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105202221/http://chaplin.bfi.org.uk/programme/attenborough.html |archivedate= 5 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian filmmaker [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] praised Chaplin as "the only person to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt.

Chaplin also strongly influenced the work of later comedians. [[Marcel Marceau]] said he was inspired to become a mime artist after watching Chaplin,&lt;ref name="silent clowns"/&gt; while the actor [[Raj Kapoor]] based his screen persona on the Tramp.&lt;ref name="story of film"/&gt; Mark Cousins has also detected Chaplin's comedic style in the French character [[Monsieur Hulot]] and the Italian character [[Totò]].&lt;ref name="story of film"/&gt; In other fields, Chaplin helped inspire the cartoon characters [[Felix the Cat]]{{sfn|Canemaker|pp=38, 78}} and [[Mickey Mouse]],{{sfn|Jackson|pp=439–444}} and was an influence on the [[Dada]] art movement.{{sfn|Simmons|pp=8–11}} As one of the founding members of United Artists, Chaplin also had a role in the development of the film industry. Gerald Mast has written that although UA never became a major company like [[MGM]] or [[Paramount Pictures]], the idea that directors could produce their own films was "years ahead of its time".{{sfn|Mast|p=100}}

In the 21st century, several of Chaplin's films are still regarded as classics and among the greatest ever made. The 2012 ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' poll, which compiles "top ten" ballots from film critics and directors to determine each group's most acclaimed films,
saw ''City Lights'' rank among the critics' top 50, ''Modern Times'' inside the top 100, and ''The Great Dictator'' and ''The Gold Rush'' placed in the top 250.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Greatest Films Poll: Critics Top 250 Films |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/critics |work=Sight &amp; Sound |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=31 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207035347/http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/critics |archivedate= 7 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The top 100 films as voted on by directors included ''Modern Times'' at number 22, ''City Lights'' at number 30, and ''The Gold Rush'' at number 91.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Directors' Top 100 Films |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/directors |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=8 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209010504/http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/directors |archivedate= 9 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Every one of Chaplin's features received a vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Greatest Films Poll: All Films |work=Sight &amp; Sound |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/films |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=31 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205070805/http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/films |archivedate= 5 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the [[American Film Institute]] named ''City Lights'' the 11th [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|greatest American film of all time]], while ''The Gold Rush'' and ''Modern Times'' again ranked in the top 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AFI's 100 Years&amp;nbsp;... 100 Movies – 10th Anniversary Edition |url=http://www.afi.com/100Years/movies10.aspx |publisher=American Film Institute |accessdate=8 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818175815/http://www.afi.com/100Years/movies10.aspx |archivedate=18 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Books about Chaplin continue to be published regularly, and he is a popular subject for media scholars and film archivists.{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1p=xvi|2a1=Maland|2y=1989|2pp=xi, 359, 370}} Many of Chaplin's film have had a [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray|Blu-Ray]] release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DVDs, United States |url=http://www.charliechaplin.com/en/us/dvds |publisher=Charlie Chaplin |accessdate=23 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224103005/http://www.charliechaplin.com/en/us/dvds |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}

==History==
[[File:Vikrambhai and amma .jpg|thumb|Founder of Darpana Academy Dr. Vikram Sarabhai and Mrinalini Sarabhai]]

The Darpana Academy of Performing Arts was founded in Ahmedabad, [[Gujarat]], [[India]] by [[Vikram Sarabhai]] and his wife [[Mrinalini Sarabhai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Darpana Academy Official Blog|url=http://darpanaacademy.blogspot.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = In conversation with danseuse Mallika Sarabhai |work= The Hindu | url = http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/dance/in-conversation-with-danseuse-mallika-sarabhai/article7814196.ece |first=G.

The work in using arts foe social change began at Darpana in the 1960s. Darpana’s puppeteers started working with the central ministry of rural development in teaching village women the use of smokeless stove. The theatre department then run by [[Kailash Pandya]] created a play called Ma to rally people to the war effort. [[Mrinalini Sarabhai]], in a radical departure from the spiritual core of the classical [[Bharat Natyam]] used the style to talk of the horror of dowry violence. Over the years two departments were established to focus the work of using the arts for change. Darpana for Dvelopment in 1980, today run by actor activist [[Jignesh Patel]], and Darpana Communication in 2001 run by film maker [[Yadavan Chandran]]. In addition, in 2009 CRANTI(Citizens Resource and Action Initiative)was formed to give practical guidance to citizen to use the laws and tools available to them to fight their own battles, and to train people in the use of the Right To Information Act to solve daily problems of access and justice, run by Bharatsinh Jhala. 
During the last three decades, these departments have worked on over 51 projects all over India, reaching out to over 12.5 million people. The work has been in areas ranging from [[public health]], [[women’s empowerment]], [[gender issues and education to the environment]], [[human rights]], [[communal harmony]], [[good governance]], citizen’s participation in democracy, race, [[gender and disability]]. Through the use of television and film, theatrical and [[street performances]], [[quizzes]] and [[debates]], [[puppets]] and [[board games]]. They have been able to effectively talk about a range of sensitive issues from [[women and violence]], to [[religious intolerance]], the [[Natural environment|environment]], [[human rights]], [[corruption]] and [[justice]].

The academy received [[UNESCO]] sponsorship to offer Artist Residency programs in 1999-2000 and 2005-2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rapport Du Directeur General Sur Les Activites Du Fonds International Pour La Promotion De La Culture (1998-1999)|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001170/117026f.pdf|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|page=9|language=French|date=27 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bursaries for Artists Program UNESCO-Aschberg 2005-2006|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001376/137683m.pdf|publisher=[[UNESCO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = India - Darpana Academy of Performing Arts|work= UNESCO| url = http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=7211&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html | accessdate = 2016-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201932/http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=7211&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-date=3 March 2016

==Activities==
[[File:Darpana Academy .jpg|thumb|dance academy]]
The academy offers courses in Indian classical dance [[Bharatanatyam]], Indian Classical Vocal, [[Mridangam]], Violin and Flute, puppetry and martial art [[ Kalaripayattu]]. Its departments range from performance and teaching of the arts, to the use of performance and arts as development communication, through face-to-face impact and software production.

The Drama Section, under acting duo [[Kailash Pandya]] and [[Damini Mehta]], is responsible for more than 100 productions of a wide variety. 

Darpana attracted young writers and staged their first scripts, making them an integral part of production efforts. Some of the names can be mentioned as [[Madhu Rye]], [[Labhshankar Thakar]], [[Shrikant Shah]], [[Subhash Shah]], [[Chinu Modi]], and [[Hasmukh Baradi]]. It also conducted theatre-training courses for over two decades.

Its research wing, Janvak, published monographs like Goverdhan Panchal's on [[Bhavai]]. Darpana has also built an experimental thrust auditorium, Natrani, reminiscent of Greek amphitheatres, on the banks of the river Sabarmati.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1878">'''Dinosauria Park''' ({{lang-el|Ο Κόσμος των Δεινοσαύρων}}, ''O Kosmos ton Dinosauron'') is a [[dinosaur]] [[Amusement park|park]] located near the town of [[Gournes]] in [[Crete]], [[Greece]], 15&amp;nbsp;km east of the city of [[Heraklion]]. The park features some fossil replicas and several [[animatronics|animatronic]] dinosaur models. Dinosaur models are displayed along an approximately 500 metre long walk, each accompanied by an information board.
The Dinosauria Park started as an idea in 2013 and was first housed in GOURNES ΔΕΚΚ, located in the former American Base. There were hosted 30 different dinosaur species from all periods of the Mesozoic era and other prehistoric animals.

In 2014 the exhibits were transferred to their own space, following intensive efforts to be found in their natural environment and to "revive"! In the large family of dinosaurs new species were added and new sections, such as dinosaurs General Hospital, where young and old fans of dinosaurs can see a dinosaur hatches and begins his life in the park. In the space for creative activities, all become children again, trying to find as many dinosaurs may in tidal area, and playing various "dinosaur games" made in space.

For the visitors there is the opportunity to watch themed films released in 5D and 7D Cinema.

Finally the visitor can enjoy tasty delicacies in Dino Snack Bar where a certified Playground by TUV organisation Hellas and enjoy endless hours of fun and pleasure.

'''''Golddigger''''' ({{lang-hu|Az aranyásó}}) is a [[1914 in film|1914]] [[cinema of Hungary|Hungarian film]] directed by [[Michael Curtiz]].
''Goldigger'' is about the [[California Gold Rush]]. Xarkrow, the lead character, leaves his home in Fortanska, a fictional city in [[Hungary]], to go to California to dig for gold in the hills of the Sierra Nevada. While there he strikes it rich with great gold. This causes a female loan shark named Ygretta Roselettokopf of San Francisco to try to seduce him for his money; this concept gives a double meaning to the title of the film. After his climatic battle with gold warden Amadeus Krone he shouts his famous and compelling line "I come to Californee for find of gold, not to have fight with you." Following the defeat of Krone in their heated pistol and gilded fist battle, Ygretta Roselettokopf returns with important news. She tells Xarkrow that she had only been hounding him for his money because Krone had tricked her out of her prized and famous show beagle, Grildboffnklad, and that "If the Hungarian Swine was not eliminated, Grildboffnklad will be." After rescuing the beloved Grildboffnklad from a rapidly falling mine cart set ablaze, Xarkrow and Ygretta accidentally touch hands and meet eyes, falling in love. The romantic and favorite line "If more loving for you, mine heart there would be too many" is spoken here. The two then return to Xarkrow's home town of Fortanska with their newfound riches and become married. Come the following credits, it is revealed that Amadeus Krone's son named Ivantarkle "Harpsichord" Krone takes up his father's left behind position. After learning the fate of his father, he darkly says, "I come to Hungary not for find of gold, but to have fight of you, Xarkrow." It is unknown if the foreshadowed sequel will ever make its big film debut.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3107">'''The Grand Union''' was an [[dance improvisation|improvisational]] [[dance group]] based in [[New York City]] from 1970 to 1976.  It grew out of Yvonne Rainer dance company, and her piece ''Continuous Project - Altered Daily''.  Rainer's sole authority as choreographer began to slip in early 1970 when the dancers, at her invitation, began to bring in their own materials for the piece.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yvonne Rainer|Rainer, Yvonne]]. ''Feelings are Facts'', chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;  By late 1970, new members had joined the group and the materials were improvised to a much greater extent.  The company, which was still often billed as "Yvonne Rainer and Dancers" in the beginning, chose "The Grand Union" as a name to avoid any obvious associations with dance in order to inoculate themselves against charges that what they were doing was not properly ''dance''.&lt;ref name=gordon /&gt; To avoid problems with the [[Grand Union (supermarket)|supermarket chain of the same name]], the group used the legal name "Rio Grand Union".&lt;ref&gt;[[Yvonne Rainer|Rainer, Yvonne]].

* [[Yvonne Rainer]]

Others who performed as guests or rehearsed with the group include:

About 6 to 9 dancers would appear for each performance, which generally lasted about 2 hours.&lt;ref name=gordon&gt;[[David Gordon (choreographer)|Gordon, David]].

Published in "TCG Focus: Combining Forces" in ''Theatre Communications'' (January 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, David Gordon, one of the regular performers, described one concert in Ohio:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[A]n audience of 200 showed up ... [A]fter the first half-hour, there were approximately 150 people left, and after the second half-hour there were 100 people and by the time performance ended there were somewhere between 12 and 20 people left,  And those few people who stayed around at the end, asked us where we were going next. "You don't know what this means to us out here," they said.  "You don't know what you've done, how you've changed our lives." ... It took me awhile to understand that if 180 people walk out, it isn't the end of the world &amp;ndash; if the 20 people left have the best time they've ever had.&lt;ref name=gordon /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9081">The '''history of German journalism''' dates to the 16th century. Germany invented printing, and produced its first newspapers in the 16th century. However, Germany was divided into so many competing states that before [[Unification of Germany|unification]] in 1871, no newspaper played a dominant role.

==Early developments==
Merchants in [[early modern Europe]] exchanged financial and commercial news, and some started regular newsletters for their clients. One example of this type of merchant was the 16th-century German financiar, [[Fugger]]. He not only received business news from  his correspondents, but also sensationalist and gossip news as well. It is evident in Fugger's correspondence with his network that fiction and fact were both significant parts of early news publications.  16th century Germany also saw subscription-based, handwritten news. Those who subscribed to these publications were generally low-level government officials and also merchants. They could not afford other types of news publications, but had enough money to pay for a subscription, which was still expensive for the time.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Häberlein, ''The Fuggers of Augsburg: Pursuing Wealth and Honor in Renaissance Germany'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th and 17th century, there appeared numerous printed news sheets summarizing accounts of battles, treaties, kings, epidemics, and special events. In 1609 [[Johann Carolus]] published the first regular newspaper in [[Strasbourg]], comprising brief news bulletins. By the 1620s, numerous major cities had newspapers of 4 to 8 pages appearing at irregular intervals; all were strictly censored. The first daily newspaper appeared in 1660 in Leipzig. [[Prussia]] increasingly became the largest and most dominant of the German states, but it had weak newspapers that were kept under very tight control. Advertising was forbidden, and budgets were very small.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth E. Olson, ''The History Makers: The Press of Europe from hits Beginnings through 1965'' (1967) pp. 99–134&lt;/ref&gt;

The term newspaper became common in the 17th century. However, in Germany, publications that we would today consider to be newspaper publications, were appearing as early as the 16th century. They were discernibly newspapers for the following reasons: they were printed, dated, appeared at regular and frequent publication intervals, and included a variety of news items (unlike single item news mentioned above). The first newspaper according to modern definitions was the ''Strasbourg Relation'', in the early 17th century. German newspapers, like avisis, were organized by the location from which they came, and by date. They differed from avisis in that they employed a distinct and highly illustrated [[title page]], and they applied an overall date to each issue.

The emergence of the new media branch was based on the [[spread of the printing press]] from which the publishing press derives its name. Historian Johannes Weber says, "At the same time, then, as the printing press in the physical, technological sense was invented, 'the press' in the extended sense of the word also entered the historical stage. The phenomenon of publishing was born. The German-language ''Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien'', printed from 1605 onwards by [[Johann Carolus]] in Strasbourg, was the first newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Weber, "Strassburg, 1605: The origins of the newspaper in Europe." ''German History'' 24#3 (2006) pp. 387–412.&lt;/ref&gt;

==German Confederation, 1815–1867==
{{further information|History of Germany#German Confederation, 1815–1867}}
A large number of newspapers and magazines flourished. A typical small city had one or two newspapers; Berlin and Leipzig had dozens. The audience was limited to perhaps five percent of the adult men, chiefly from the aristocratic and middle classes, who followed politics. Liberal papers outnumbered conservative ones by a wide margin. Foreign governments bribed editors to guarantee a favorable image.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore S. Hamerow, ''The Social Foundations of German Unification, 1858-1871: Ideas and Institutions'' (1969) pp. 284–91&lt;/ref&gt; Censorship was strict, and the government issued the political news they were supposed to report. After 1871, strict press laws were used by [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] to shut down the Socialist, and to threaten hostile editors. There were no national newspapers. Editors focused on political commentary, but also included a nonpolitical cultural page, focused on the arts and high culture. Especially popular was the serialized novel, with a new chapter every week. Magazines were politically more influential, and attracted the leading intellectuals as authors.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth E. Olson, ''The history makers: The press of Europe from its beginnings through 1965'' (LSU Press, 1966) pp. 99–134&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weimar Republic ==
The republic's constitution along with other social forces and the earlier Reich press law of 1874 gave rise to a dispersed, energetic and pluralistic press with a wide range of political opinion after the Great War. The [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-Anzeiger '' Generalanzeiger ''] and the [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulevardzeitung '' Boulevardblatt ''] established consumer bases decades earlier. Wire news service and newspaper commercial lending by Ruhr industrial interests sought to influence editorial opinion prior to the Great War and during the republic. &lt;ref&gt;Eksteins, Modris.

Oxford Historical Monographs series. pp. 78-79. {{ISBN|0-19-821862-1}}. &lt;/ref&gt;

==1945–1990==
In 1945 the occupying powers took over all newspapers in Germany and purged them of Nazi influence. The American occupation headquarters, the [[Office of Military Government, United States]] (OMGUS) began its own newspaper based in Munich, ''[[Die Neue Zeitung]]''. It was edited by German and Jewish émigrés who fled to the United States before the war. Its mission was to encourage democracy by exposing Germans to how American culture operated. The paper was filled with details on American sports, politics, business, Hollywood, and fashions, as well as international affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica C.E.

'''''Hughie''''' is a short two-character play by [[Eugene O’Neill]] set in the lobby of a small hotel on a West Side street in midtown New York during the summer of 1928. The play is essentially a long monologue delivered by a small-time hustler named Erie Smith to the hotel’s new night clerk Charlie Hughes, lamenting how Smith’s luck has gone bad since the death of Hughie, Hughes' predecessor. [[Eugene O’Neill|O’Neill]] wrote ''Hughie'' in 1942, although it did not receive its world premiere until 1958, when it was staged in Sweden at the Royal Dramatic Theatre with [[Bengt Eklund]] as Erie Smith. It was first staged in English at the Theater Royal in [[Bath, England]] in 1963 with [[Burgess Meredith]] as Erie.&lt;ref name="Hughie: Robards' Monte Cristo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoneill.com/library/laconics/2/2b.htm |title=Hughie: Robards' Monte Cristo? |publisher=Eoneill.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was first presented on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1964 starring [[Jason Robards]] as Erie and directed by [[José Quintero]]. Robards received a [[Tony Award]] nomination for his performance, and revived the production in 1975 in [[Berkeley, California]] with [[Jack Dodson]] as Charlie Hughes. Robards and Dodson returned to perform it at the Hyde Park Festival Theatre in 1981 and the Trinity Repertory Theatre in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] in 1991,&lt;ref name="Hughie: Robards' Monte Cristo"/&gt;  also televising their performances in 1984 for [[PBS]].

''Hughie'' has been produced on Broadway three times since the 1964 Robards/Quintero production. In 1975 it was paired in repertory with another short play, ''[[Duet (play)|Duet]]'', this time with [[Ben Gazzara]] as Erie (who also won a Tony Award nomination for the role), and in 1996 by the [[Circle in the Square Theatre]] in a production directed by and starring [[Al Pacino]]. The designers for that production were [[David Gallo]] (sets), Donald Holder (lights),  Candice Donnelly (costumes) and John Gromada (sound). The [[Goodman Theater]] in Chicago put on the play in January and February 2010, with [[Brian Dennehy]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodmantheatre.org/season/production.aspx?tess%3D3283 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228223835/http://www.goodmantheatre.org/season/production.aspx?tess=3283 |archivedate=2010-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production was variously well-reviewed, with emphasis on Dennehy's strong performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oleksinski |first=Johnny |url=http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/the_theater_loop/2010/01/hughie-and-krapps-last-tape-at-the-goodman-push-pull-and-the-passage-of-time.html |title=Theater Loop - chicagotribune.com |publisher=Leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/theater/24cncdennehy.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newcitystage.com/2010/01/25/review-hughie-krapp%E2%80%99s-last-tapegoodman-theatre/ |title=Review: Hughie &amp; Krapp’s Last Tape/Goodman Theatre |publisher=Newcity Stage |date=2010-01-25 |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was revived in 2013 at the [[Shakespeare Theatre Company]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] with [[Richard Schiff]] as Erie.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shakespearetheatre.org/plays/details.aspx?id=347&amp;source=l&lt;/ref&gt; It returned for a fourth time to Broadway with [[Forest Whitaker]] as Erie Smith in February 2016.

Sir '''Ian Bruce Hope Hunter''' (2 April 1919{{spaced ndash}}5 September 2003) was a British [[impresario]] of classical music. Known as 'Mr. Festival' to many in the arts world,&lt;ref name="HunterObituaryTelegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt; Hunter was one of the most important figures in a post-[[World War II]] cultural renaissance in the United Kingdom.  From the mid-1950s, following the death of [[Harold Holt (impresario)|Harold Holt]], he headed the [[music management]] agency Harold Holt Ltd,&lt;ref name="HunterLebrecht"/&gt; which joined with Lies Askonas Ltd in the late 1990s to form Askonas Holt.&lt;ref name="WIPO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AskonasHolt"/&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Hadley Wood]], [[Middlesex]], Hunter began his career in 1947, as assistant to artistic director [[Rudolf Bing]] at the very first [[Edinburgh Festival]]. He succeeded Bing as the festival's director in 1950, remaining in the position through 1955. He served as the director of numerous other festivals, including the Bath Festival from 1948 to 1968, the City of London Festival from 1962 to 1980, the Brighton Festival from 1967 to 1983, and festivals in Windsor and Hong Kong.   "Festivals," he once said, "are like sudden [[fireworks]] in a dark sky."&lt;ref name="Bullamore"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;  "Characteristic of Hunter's capacity for thinking big was the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Arts Festival of 1965. In preparing it he visited 23 countries, and it was held simultaneously, over two weeks, in London, Glasgow, [[Cardiff]] and [[Liverpool]]. Dance was strongly featured: [[Caribbean]], [[African dance|African]] and [[Dance in India|Indian]] groups rubbed friendly shoulders with classical companies from Australia and Canada. [[Jazz]] jostled with the classics. [[Yehudi Menuhin|Menuhin]] shared a platform with [[Ravi Shankar]]. Balloons were released and fireworks rocketed."&lt;ref name="TimesLondonObit"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hunter was also a talent manager, celebrated as chairman of Harold Holt Ltd. (now Askonas Holt Ltd.) from 1953 to 1988. He died in [[Balcombe, West Sussex]] at the age of 84.

'''Impacts of Native American gaming''' can be positive or negative, depending on the tribe and its location.  In the 1970s, various Native American tribes took unprecedented action to initiate [[Native American gaming|Native gaming]] enterprises.&lt;ref name="Harvard 2008"&gt;Harvard. The State of the Native Nations. New York: Oxford UP, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  In doing so, they created not only a series of legal struggles between the federal, state, and tribal governments but also a groundbreaking way to revitalize the Native American economy.  Native American gaming has grown from [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]] parlors to high-stakes gaming and is surrounded by controversy on many different levels.  There are disputes concerning [[tribal sovereignty]], negative effects of gaming, and a loss of Native American culture.&lt;ref name="Cattelino, Jessica R 2008"&gt;Cattelino, Jessica R. High Stakes: Florida Seminole Gaming and Sovereignty. Durham: Duke UP, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] was passed in 1988 in order to secure collaboration between the states and tribes and also in order for the federal government to oversee gaming operations.  Native American gaming has proven to be extremely lucrative for several tribes, but it has also been unsuccessful in some instances.  Native American gaming is contingent upon and only beneficial to its respective [[Indian reservation|reservation]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvard. The State of the Native Nations. New York: Oxford UP, 2008. Print.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Success==
Gaming can be extremely successful because it stimulates the [[Economics of gambling|economy]], increases [[tourism]] to reservations, reduces [[unemployment]], raises incomes, and increases tribal independence while reducing dependence upon [[United States welfare state|welfare]].  Native American gaming has created over 300,000 jobs in the United States.&lt;ref name="NIGA RESPONDS TO TIME ARTICLE"&gt;{{cite web | title=NIGA RESPONDS TO TIME ARTICLE | date=December 10, 2002 | first=Ernest L. | last=Stevens, Jr. | publisher=Minnesota Indian Gaming Association | url=http://www.mnindiangaming.com/template.cfm?view=news_detail&amp;releaseID=32 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530052033/http://www.mnindiangaming.com/template.cfm?view=news_detail&amp;releaseID=32 | archivedate=May 30, 2006 | accessdate=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tribes in only 30 states are eligible to operate gaming enterprises because 16 states have no federally recognized tribes, and five states ([[Massachusetts]], [[Texas]], [[Missouri]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Utah]]) prohibit Native American gaming.&lt;ref name="Darian-Smith, Eve 2004"&gt;Darian-Smith, Eve. New Capitalists: Law, Politics, and Identity Surrounding Casino Gaming on Native American Land. Belmont: Thomson Wadsworth, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 224 of the 550 tribes in 28 states operate the 350 Native American gaming enterprises nationwide,&lt;ref name="Waldman, Carl 2009"&gt;Waldman, Carl. ''Atlas of The North American Indian''. 3rd ed. New York: Infobase, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  and 68% of Native Americans belong to a tribe with gaming operations.&lt;ref name="Harvard 2008"/&gt; According to the [[Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development]], these enterprises earned $19.4 billion in 2005.  As compared to the $4.5 billion earned by Native American gaming revenues in 1995, Native American gaming enterprises have shown substantial growth in just ten years.  These enterprises, earning $19.4 billion a year, account for 25.8% of the nation's{{which|date=July 2015}} $75 billion revenue (brought in by the total gaming enterprises in the country).&lt;ref name="Harvard 2008"/&gt; In addition, Native American gaming is the source of 400,000 jobs, and the profits from the enterprises often go toward programs that create jobs.&lt;ref name="Waldman, Carl 2009"/&gt;  For example, 75% of the profit generated by Cherokee Nation Enterprises in 2005 was given to the Jobs Growth Fund, a fund that expands businesses within the [[Cherokee Nation]] to create more jobs.&lt;ref&gt;SMITH 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Revenues, by law, must go toward improving reservation communities.  The [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] requires that revenues go toward:  tribal government operations, promotion of the welfare of the tribe and its citizens, economic development, support of charitable organizations, and compensation to local non-Native governments for support of services provided by those governments.&lt;ref name="Harvard 2008"/&gt;  Tribes have boosted their [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] status in the past several years by improving their [[infrastructure]], but due to the lack of federal and state funding, have only been able to do so as a result of gaming enterprises.  For instance, tribes often build [[casino]]-related facilities that draw visitors such as hotels, conference centers, entertainment venues, [[golf course]]s, and [[RV park]]s.  Once a reservation has established a strong economic foundation, it can draw in businesses that are unrelated to gaming.  A common trend is that casinos stimulate the economy, and other business sustain it.  For instance, the [[San Manuel Band of Mission Indians]] built in a [[Bottled water|water bottling]] plant on the reservation and, along with three other tribes, invested in a hotel in [[Washington, D.C.]]  The [[Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska]] are involved in a number of  businesses; some of which are Internet media, home manufacturing, used autos, and gas stations.  The [[Morongo Band of Mission Indians]], a small band in California, has opened a [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]] station, [[A&amp;W Restaurants|A&amp;W]] drive-in, [[Coco's Bakery|Coco's Restaurant]], a water bottling plant, and a fruit orchard operation.  In addition to involvement in private corporations, Native nations have enough sustainability to bolster government programs.  Some of these projects include, but are not limited to:  providing law enforcement, fire fighters, schools, translators for emergency response, college scholarships, assistance with mortgage down payments, protection for endangered species, monitorship for water quality, care for elders, police cars, foster-care improvements, and health clinics.&lt;ref name="Harvard 2008"/&gt;

Tribes sometimes distribute funds on a per capita basis in order to directly benefit its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Waldman, Carl. Atlas of The North American Indian. 3rd ed. New York: Infobase, 2009. Print. 281&lt;/ref&gt;  Because "per caps" have sometimes shown negative effects such as a dependence on tribal government, low attendance in school, and an unwillingness to work, some tribes have experimented with decreasing per caps as punishment.  To clarify, the [[Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation Tribal Council]] deducted at least $100 from families' per caps with children with low school attendance.  This ordinance resulted in a 30% increase in graduation rates in just 3 years, a substantial increase.  Furthermore, the [[Las Vegas Paiute Nation]] deducts funding for jail from the offender's per capita because the Nation itself does not have a jail and must rent it from other governments.  Punishments such as these provide an incentive for morality as well as financial assistance from the per caps themselves.&lt;ref name="Harvard 2008"/&gt;

States also benefit from Native American gaming enterprises.  States cannot tax reservations, but they can, under IGRA, negotiate a compact and demand compact payments.  Tribes usually pay approximately or less than 10% of profit to states in order to compensate for strains put on the state.  It is estimated that the state of [[Michigan]] earned $325 million from tribes spanning from 1993-2003.&lt;ref name="Harvard 2008"/&gt;

It is required by law for a tribe to agree to a state compact if they request one, but the IGRA says nothing about local governments.  However, many tribes do negotiate with local governments.  They place a strain on traffic and emergency services, and it is not uncommon for a tribe to compensate for that.  Native Americans pay $50 million annually to local governments across the nation.  In addition, non-Natives hold 75% of the 300,000 jobs that belong to Native American gaming.&lt;ref name="NIGA RESPONDS TO TIME ARTICLE"/&gt;

With gaming profits, the [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation|Creek Nation of Oklahoma]] has built its own hospital staffed by Native American doctors and nurses.&lt;ref name="Darian-Smith, Eve 2004"/&gt;  Other tribes establish health clinics, [[dialysis]] centers, and fitness centers to deal with the problem of [[Native American disease and epidemics]].  Many tribes work toward securing hope for the future by improving schools.  The [[Mille Lacs Band]] of [[Ojibwe]] built two schools that teach fluency in English as well as [[Ojibwe language]].&lt;ref name="NIGA RESPONDS TO TIME ARTICLE"/&gt;

==Failure==
There have been many past attempts to revitalize Native American economies, but most of them have failed.  Two of the more successful ventures, besides gaming, include selling [[gasoline]] and [[cigarette]]s for a much lower price than can be found off the reservation.  Tribes are able to sell cheaper goods because there is no state tax.  Lower prices draw in non-Natives from off-reservation sites, and tribes are able to earn a considerable profit.  [[Seminole]] annual income grew from $600,000 in 1968 to $4.5 million in 1977.  Smokeshops account for most of this substantial increase.  Less effective efforts by the Seminole Nation to boost the economy include cattle raising, craft selling, and [[alligator wrestling]].&lt;ref name="Cattelino, Jessica R 2008"/&gt; Cattle operations are popular among the Seminole tribe:  with their 7,000 head herd, Seminoles are the largest cattle operators in the state of [[Florida]] and the twelfth largest in the United States.  However, cattle operations are not overwhelmingly successful because they have been known to benefit the individual rather than the tribe.  In addition, cattle operations led to government dependency and debt.  Another economic endeavor is craft sales.  Some individuals create traditional Seminole crafts and sell them, but this market does not leave a huge impact on the tribal economy.  Instead, it benefits the individual as a supplementary income.  Alligator wrestling is yet another moneymaker but is not relied upon.  Alligator wrestling originated in the 1920s and became synonymous with Seminole culture.  It has been denigrated as exploitative, though, and is quite risky.  Consequently, alligator wrestling has become less prevalent with the growing popularity of Native American gaming.&lt;ref name="Cattelino, Jessica R 2008"/&gt;

If a Native American casino is unsuccessful, its failure is often linked to its geographic location.  The size of a tribe is usually insignificant.  This argument follows the logic of a free market economy.  Tribes with a strong economic base find it easier to draw in new businesses and consumers.  Tribes in remote locations suffer because they lack a consumer base to support new and existing businesses.&lt;ref name="NIGA RESPONDS TO TIME ARTICLE"/&gt;  For example, the [[Morongo Band of Mission Indians]] is very small, but their gaming enterprises are overwhelmingly successful.  In contrast, the [[Sioux Nation]], a very large nation, has struggled to achieve success with gaming enterprises.  Regardless of its thousands of members and approximately 12 gambling halls, the Sioux Nation is unable to benefit from gaming enterprises because it is too isolated from potential customers.  Another example is found in [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]].  Four tribes in San Diego County had ambitious plans for a $100 million-plus resort and convention center but preemptively scaled back this idea because they are in an inconvenient location.  Far away from other civilization and in close proximity to each other, the tribes concluded their chances of an overwhelming success were slim.&lt;ref name="Darian-Smith, Eve 2004"/&gt;

The [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]], the second largest reservation in the United States, suffers from extreme [[poverty]].  It is the poorest county in the United States and has attempted to revitalize its economy through the gambling industry.  However, these attempts have failed.  Its casino created a mere 80 jobs,&lt;ref name="NIGA RESPONDS TO TIME ARTICLE"/&gt; but this figure is insignificant since the unemployment rate on the reservation is up to 95%.  The reservation has higher unemployment, [[diabetes]], [[infant mortality]], [[teen suicide]], dropout, and [[alcoholism]] rates than the country on a whole.  Many homes are dilapidated, overcrowded, and without water, plumbing, and electricity.  Pine Ridge's failed attempts are predictable considering the closest major city, [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], is 350 miles away.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Stephanie M. "WAMBLI HO, VOICE OF THE EAGLES: SPECIAL REPORT." Native Village. 2002. Web. 11 Oct. 2009. &lt;Nativevillage.org&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on native cultures ==

With Native American gaming has come the image of a "rich Indian." This depiction contrasts other images of Native Americans portrayed as savage, pure, connected to nature, and spiritual.  The reality (that some Native Americans are powerful [[entrepreneur]]s) contradicts the notion of what a Native American is "supposed to be."  "Rich Indian" propaganda even circulated in response to Proposition 5 in California in 1998&lt;ref name="Darian-Smith, Eve 2004"/&gt; that perpetuated the stereotype that "the only good Indian is a poor Indian."&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times, October 27, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Noble savage}}

Eve Darian-Smith and others have asserted that the impact of gaming on Indian culture in general is a loss of a [[cultural myth]]. According to [[Ronald Wright]], these ideas are based on [[stereotype]]s and are "construed by the dominant society in an effort to control and justify the enduring inequalities and injustices that permeate our legal system and social landscape."&lt;ref name="Darian-Smith, Eve 2004"/&gt; One perspective is that Native American gaming is not so much damaging Native culture as it is merely changing a cultural myth, the way the general population perceives Native Americans.  Additionally, Native American gaming can be viewed as a means to rejuvenate and preserve tribal culture.  For instance, many tribes use revenues generated from gaming toward museums and cultural centers.  Tribes are not only able to fund themselves independently but can also afford to preserve their individual histories.&lt;ref name="Darian-Smith, Eve 2004"/&gt;

==Controversy==

===Morality of Native American gaming===
{{cleanup-rewrite|the content is almost completely off-topic|section|date=March 2014}}
There is some controversy of Native American gambling because it is argued that it contributes to a moral decay.  Gambling, it is argued, promotes crime and pathological behavior.&lt;ref name="Darian-Smith, Eve 2004"/&gt;  [[Gambling addiction]]s as well as drug and alcohol abuse are sometimes associated with Native American gaming.  In 1962, the total estimated sums in the United States totaled $2 billion.  This figure jumped to $18 billion in 1976, to $80 billion in 1985, and to $400 billion in 1993.  In 2000, the total estimated sums wagered in the United States was $866 billion.  In 2000, the commercial take was 10%, so the gaming industry earned approximately $70 billion, even accounting for the fact that gamblers win some money back.  That is over three times the $22 billion in total revenues generated by all other forms of entertainment combined: tickets to movies, plays, concerts, performances, and sports events. Moreover, Native American gaming contributes to only a fraction of [[gambling in the United States]].  Native American casinos bring in only 17% of gambling revenue, while non-Native casinos raise 43%.&lt;ref name="Darian-Smith, Eve 2004"/&gt;

===''TIME'' magazine controversy===

In late 2002, ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine printed a special report entitled "Indian Casinos:  Wheel of Misfortune" that infuriated Native Americans nationwide.  Ernie Stevens, Jr., Chairman of the National Indian Gaming Association, wrote a letter to the editor of ''TIME'' in response to the report.&lt;ref name="NIGA RESPONDS TO TIME ARTICLE"/&gt;

==Native American gaming in popular culture==
Native American gaming has appeared many times in literature.  The first appearance of Native American gaming was in [[John Rollin Ridge]]'s 1854 novel ''[[The Life and Adventures of Joaquin Murieta]]''.  [[Mourning Dove (author)|Christal Quintasket]] wrote about Native American gaming in her 1927 novel ''[[Cogewea, the Half-Blood]]''.  [[Gerald Vizenor]] writes on this theme in ''[[Bearheart: The Heirship Chronicles]],'' ''[[The Heirs of Columbus]]'', and ''Dead Voices''.  [[Leslie Marmon Silko]] wrote a 1977 novel called ''[[Ceremony (Silko novel)|Ceremony]]'' that focuses on gambling.  [[Louise Erdrich]], a prominent Native American author, wrote ''[[Love Medicine]]'', ''[[Tracks (novel)|Tracks]]'', and ''The Bingo Palace''.  Traditional, ritual gaming is a common theme in these pieces of literature and provide literary, rather than fact-based, accounts of Native American gaming.&lt;ref&gt;Pasquaretta, Paul. Gambling and Survival in Native North America. Tucson: The University of Arizona, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Korea Communications Commission''' ({{ko-hhrm|대한민국 방송통신위원회|大韓民國 放送通信委員會|Daehanminguk Bangsongtongsin Wiwonhoe}}) is a [[South Korea]]n [[media regulation]] agency modeled after the [[Federal Communications Commission]] of the [[United States of America]]. It was established on February 29, 2008, combining the former ''Korean Broadcasting Commission'' and the [[Ministry of Information and Communication (South Korea)|Ministry of Information and Communication]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalmediapolicy.net/node/1054 Korea Communications Commission] at globalmediapolicy.net&lt;/ref&gt; The five members of the Commissioners make a decision. The current Chairman, among the five Commissioners, is Choi Sung-joon.

==Comprehensive programming==
The KCC approved four newspapers companies, [[Chojoongdong]] (Chosun Ilbo, Joongang Ilbo, and Donga Ilbo) media cartel and Maeil Economics, to engage in the comprehensive programming for television channels on December 31, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = (News Focus) Entry of new cable broadcasters heralds media big bang | date = 2010-12-31 | url = http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2010/12/31/41/0302000000AEN20101231005700315F.HTML | work = Yonhap News | accessdate = 2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has given more financial and political power to the right-wing conservative media groups in South Korea. Even before KCC's approval, this had generated concerns about the potential politically biased journalistic movement akin to the United States of America's [[Fox News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Moon-young | last = Lee | title = "Fox News phenomenon" likely to permeate S.Korea, media experts say | date = 2010-12-01 | url = http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/451609.html | work = The Hankyoreh | accessdate = 2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KCC-approved comprehensive programming could potentially destroy the fair media practices starting in 2012 when the new television channels affect the domestic journalist scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jeong-min (정민) | last = Ryu (류) | script-title=ko:‘황소개구리’ 종편, 언론생태계 파괴할 ‘잡식 본색’ | date = 2010-12-01 | url = http://www.mediatoday.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=96558 | work = Media Today | accessdate = 2011-08-26 | language = Korean | quote = &lt;nowiki&gt;[국회 언론관계법 날치기 2년]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 약탈적 광고경쟁 시대 우려 … 각종 특혜제도 요구에 정부는 맞장구}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Comprehensive Programming channel were criticized for the lack of quality programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jun-yeong (준영) | last = Yang (양) | script-title=ko:`졸속 종편` 시청률 고작 0.3~0.6% | date = 2011-12-02 | url = http://www.hankyung.com/news/app/newsview.php?aid=2011120218841&amp;nid=004&amp;ltype=1 | work = Hankyung | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also criticized for opening the television channels on December 1, 2011, when there were a growing outrage against Lee Myung-bak in the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Seok-hun (석훈) | last = U (우) | script-title=ko:조중동 '종편' 망하게 하는 법, 간단합니다 | date = 2011-12-04 | url = http://www.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/view/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0001665100&amp;CMPT_CD=P0000 | work = OhMyNews | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative factors later made a negative first impression of the new TV channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Hun-gil (훈길) | last = Choi (최) | script-title=ko:애국가 시청률도 안 나온 조중동 방송 어쩌나 | date = 2011-12-03 | url = http://www.mediatoday.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=98907 | work = Media Today | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second day TV Chosun by Chosun Ilbo on December 2, 2011, was met with numerous criticisms on politically biased news captions, criticizing the remarks on the female novelist, [[Gong Ji-young]], and reception issues that split the televised screen into two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Hyeon-ho (현호) | last = Cho (조) |author2=Jeong Sang-guen (정상근) |author3=Oh Gyeong-hui (오경희) |script-title=ko:종편, 이번엔 자막사고…공지영 비난 방송 | date = 2011-12-04 | url = http://www.mediatoday.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=98906 | work = Media Today | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first day of TV Chosun showed [[Kang Ho Dong]] on a negative light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = In-gyeong (인경) | last = Yu (유) | script-title=ko:"강호동이 야쿠자… 김연아가 앵커…" 도 넘었다 | date = 2011-12-02 | url = http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201112022130085&amp;code=940705 | work = Kyunghyang Shinmun | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frequency==
The KCC had suggested a unified mobile frequency interface with Japan's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = In-yeong (인영) | last = Choi (최) | script-title=ko:방통위, 日과 주파수 공동이용 논의 | date = 2010-12-11 | url = http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2011/12/11/0200000000AKR20111211032800017.HTML | work = Yonhap News | accessdate = 2011-12-11 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
* Unlike the Federal Communications Commission, the Korea Communications Commission is not an independent agency, but a subordinate organization of the [[Blue House]] and the [[President of South Korea]], which could exercise unfair regulatory practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = 도헌 (Do-heon) | last = 반 (Ban) | script-title=ko:대통령 직속이니 맘대로 하실라 | date = 2008-01-28 | url = http://www.sisapress.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=45322 | work = SisaINLive | accessdate = 2011-02-14 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On December 21, 2010, the KCC controversially announced that it is planning to create a guideline about monitoring the internet content in case of a tense political situation; automatically deleting any online anti-governmental message that could lead to [[internet censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = 재섭 (Jae-seop) | last = 김 (Kim) | title = &lt;nowiki&gt;[단독]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 정부, ‘긴장상황’때 인터넷글 무단삭제 추진 | date = 2010-12-22 | url = http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/it/455022.html | work = [[The Hankyoreh]] | accessdate = 2011-01-09 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Fitch Ratings]] negatively commented about the KCC's decision to allow tariff discounts for the South Korean telecommunication companies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/30/markets-ratings-southkorea-telecomoperat-idUSWNA489420110330 FITCH negative regulatory environment to continue for South Korean telecoms] 2011-03-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.heraldm.com/common/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20110330000764 英 피치 "최시중 방통위원장 연임은 통신사에 부정적"] Maeil Economics&lt;/ref&gt;
*KCC was not able to properly fine [[Apple Inc.]] for its illegal collection of GPS location data of Korean iPhone users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2011/08/03/0200000000AKR20110803170900017.HTML 애플에 과태료 300만원…'솜방망이'처벌 논란] 2011-08-03 Yonhap News&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leisureland Fair''' is a defunct amusement park in [[Langwarrin, Victoria]], [[Australia]] which operated from 1984 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frankston-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/religious-group-brings-site-to-life/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228221353/http://frankston-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/religious-group-brings-site-to-life/ |archivedate=2010-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now a housing estate with the only reference to it being a street named after it. The amusement park was situated on a large plot of land with a steam train which would take passengers from the carpark to the park itself.

The park consisted of a large number of attractions including a custom built steel [[roller coaster]], [[log flume]], waterslides, mini golf, a function centre and various other rides. The park was then sold on to a religious group who developed the site into housing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frankston.vic.gov.au/library/scripts/objectifyMedia.aspx?file=pdf/185/29.pdf&amp;siteID=3&amp;str_title=PS131%20-%2016%20February%202009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The only remaining part of Leisureland Fair is the now abandoned Function Centre, otherwise known as The Castle. The property is now under private ownership and was once the main terminus for the amusement park, situated in the centre of the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cranbourne-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/castle-becomes-a-temple/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323183600/http://cranbourne-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/castle-becomes-a-temple/ |archivedate=2011-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inductions were first held in 2013: [[Manuel Alejandro]], [[José Ángel Espinoza]], [[José Feliciano]], [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Armando Manzanero]], [[Concha Valdés Miranda]], and [[Roberto Cantoral]] were the first songwriters to be inducted. The latter was posthumously inducted.&lt;ref name="billboard"/&gt; Mexico is the country with the most songwriters inducted with twelve.

'''Luna Park''' was an amusement park near [[Leipzig, Germany]] that existed from 1912 to 1932. It was built around the [[Auensee|Auensee lake]], a former [[gravel pit]]. The park featured a [[Roller_coaster#Scenic_railways|scenic railroad]] ride, a [[hippodrome]], a [[dance hall]], restaurants, and a public beach. Immensely popular prior to the onset of [[World War I]], Luna Park's fortunes waned in the latter 1920s and early 1930s as the effects of the [[Great Depression]] encircled the world. The park ceased operating as a commercial enterprise on January 13, 1932.

The main restaurant stayed open, even after the close of the park, which eventually became (1941) property of the city of Leipzig.

[[File:Micromouse Green Giant V1.3.jpg|thumb|Micromouse robot]]
'''Micromouse''' is an event where small [[robot]] [[mouse|mice]] solve a 16 × 16 [[maze]]. It began in the late 1970s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.micromouseonline.com/micromouse-book/history/&lt;/ref&gt;, although there is some indication of events in 1950. Events are held worldwide, and are most popular in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[United States|U.S.]], [[Japan]], [[Singapore]], [[India]] , [[South Korea]] and becoming popular in subcontinent countries such as [[Sri Lanka]].

The maze is made up of a 16 by 16 grid of cells, each 180&amp;nbsp;mm square with walls 50&amp;nbsp;mm high&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/micromouse/Rules/Maze_Solver_Rules.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. The mice are completely [[autonomous robot]]s that must find their way from a predetermined starting position to the central area of the maze unaided. The mouse will need to keep track of where it is, discover walls as it explores, map out the maze and detect when it has reached the goal. Having reached the goal, the mouse will typically perform additional searches of the maze until it has found an optimal route from the start to the center. Once the optimal route has been found, the mouse will run that route in the shortest possible time. 

Competitions &lt;ref&gt;http://micromouseusa.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ukmars.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and conferences &lt;ref&gt;https://ukmars.org/index.php/Minos&lt;/ref&gt; are still run regularly.

== Half-Size Micromouse ==
A new version of Micromouse called the Half Size Micromouse has been introduced for 30th All Japan Micromouse Competition 2009 &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bszRuwK3yIs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN5vYrrSdKQ&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead of a 16 × 16 maze the new competition uses up to a 32 × 32 maze. Cell and wall dimensions have been reduced by half&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntf.or.jp/mouse/micromouse2010/rulehalf-EN.html&lt;/ref&gt;, providing a new challenge. 

There have been half-size competitions in Europe in Hungary in 2015&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pcbway.com/project/sponsor/The_first_Half_size_Micromouse_competition_in_Europe.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK in 2018&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsHbhUYqG0I&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maze Solving == 

Mice can use various [[Search algorithm|searching algorithms]].  Common search algorithms use variations of the Bellman [[Flood fill|Flood-fill]] method [http://www.micromouseonline.com/micromouse-book/mazes-and-maze-solving/solving-the-maze/#axzz1uapduejO], [[Dijkstra's algorithm]], [[A*]] search algorithm among various [[graph traversal]] and [[tree traversal]] algorithms. 

== Performance ==

Mice can run at over three meters per second, depending on the maze design. Some of the best micromouse builders are Kato-san [http://blog.livedoor.jp/robolabo/], Ng Beng Kiat [https://sites.google.com/site/ngbengkiat/] and Nakashima-san [http://homepage1.nifty.com/hfd01577/index.html]. The current world record is 3.921 seconds [http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/diy/meet-the-new-worlds-fastest-micromouse] and is held by Ng Beng Kiat.

Performance in recent years has improved considerably. As of 2015, winning mice are likely to run with forward acceleration and braking well over 10&amp;nbsp;[[Metre_per_second_squared|m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.micromouseonline.com/2017/08/03/micromouse-hard-acceleration/&lt;/ref&gt;. Cornering is possible with centripetal accelerations as high as 2g. Micromice are among the highest performing autonomous robots.

Most recently, robots are being equipped with a fan to create a partial vacuum under the mouse while it is running&lt;ref&gt;http://www.micromouseonline.com/2017/10/11/taiwan-micromouse-intelligent-robot-contest-2017/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.micromouseonline.com/2018/02/18/more-suck-less-slip/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://hackaday.com/2008/11/26/vacuum-micromouse/&lt;/ref&gt;. The additional downforce available has made possible a huge improvement in performance. Compared to a non-fan mouse, the newer robots are likely to be able to achieve centripetal accelerations of 6g or more. Straight line accelerations can easily exceed 2.5g.

'''Midnight leagues''' are a series of initiatives starting in the 1990s with [[midnight basketball]] and expanding into other sports, notably [[association football]], where vulnerable urban youth could assemble during the night, and keep themselves off the streets while engaging with sports alternatives to drugs and crime.

[[Juvenile_delinquency|Youth crime]] rates usually peak during night hours. Empirically, a 2006 study of the 1990-1994 period when urban midnight basketball programs were first initiated as a crime-prevention strategy, found that—while confounding factors were likely involved—property crime rates fell more rapidly in cities that were early adopters of the original midnight basketball model than in other American cities in the same period.&lt;ref name=Hartmann2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hartmann|first1=Douglas|last2=Depro|first2=Brooks|title=Rethinking Sports-Based Community Crime Prevention: A Preliminary Analysis of the Relationship Between Midnight Basketball and Urban Crime Rates|journal=Journal of Sport and Social Issues|date=May 2006|volume=30|issue=2|pages=180–196|doi=10.1177/0193723506286863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production notes==
The series was produced for NBC by McCadden Enterprises, Inc. in association with [[United Artists Television]]. The series [[executive producer]] was comedian [[George Burns]].  The theme song was the Tin Pan Alley standard "Yes Sir, That's My Baby", sung by a male voice.

==Reception==
''Mona McCluskey'' appeared on Thursday nights against [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'' and the second half-hour of [[CBS]]'s two-hour ''[[CBS Thursday Night Movie|Thursday Night Movie]]''. It failed to win its time slot and was cancelled by NBC, with its last episode airing in April 1966.

'''Moose cavalry''' are military units of cavalrymen mounted on [[moose]] (Eurasian elk, ''Alces alces alces'') rather than the more usual horses.  There are legends that state that the [[Mansi people]] of Western Siberia rode moose into battle but there is no evidence of this.  In 17th-century Sweden [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]] trialled the use of moose as a replacement for horses, which had to be imported.  However they proved susceptible to disease, hard to feed and fearful of the sound of gunfire.  The use of moose cavalry by the Soviets in the  [[Winter War]] of 1939 and 1940 is also reported but seems to stem from a 2010 ''Popular Mechanics'' [[April Fools' Day]] article.

== Russia ==
Legends state that the [[Mansi people]] of Western Siberia rode into battle mounted on moose.  The antlers of the animals are said to have been painted red.  No evidence of such use has been found.&lt;ref name=rt/&gt;  In the 18th-century [[Catherine the Great]] is said to have outlawed the domestication of the moose out of fear that dissidents exiled to Siberia might use them as mounts in any armed rebellion against her.

The moose (Eurasian elk, ''Alces alces alces'') had been used in Sweden to draw the sleighs of the Royal couriers since at least the reign of [[Charles IX of Sweden|Charles IX]].&lt;ref name=jackson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jackson |first1=Kevin |title=Moose |date=2009 |publisher=Reaktion Books |isbn=9781861896285 |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eZTxAQAAQBAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They proved effective in this role, able to travel around 230 miles in a day.&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;  As a development of this role [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]] (1660–1697) trialled the use of moose cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sweden Now |journal=Sweden Now |date=1975 |page=129 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gj3hAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=17 September 2018 |publisher=Ingenjorsforlaget |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geist |first1=Valerius |title=Deer of the World: Their Evolution, Behaviour, and Ecology |date=1998 |publisher=Stackpole Books |isbn=9780811704960 |page=242 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcWZX-IMEVkC&amp;pg=PA242|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The intention was to replace the horses of one of his cavalry regiments with moose, to avoid the need to import horses as was the contemporary practice.&lt;ref name=geist&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geist |first1=Valerius |title=Moose: Behavior, Ecology, Conservation |date=1999 |publisher=Voyageur Press |isbn=9780896584228 |page=133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kVsQAQAAMAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=andrews/&gt;  It was anticipated that the animals would cause fear in the horses of enemy cavalry, allowing formations to be broken without the need for artillery or musketry.&lt;ref name=geist/&gt;  The idea was presented to the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in Stockholm.&lt;ref name=andrews&gt;{{cite news |last1=Andrews |first1=Laurel |title=Of moose and men: A brief history of domesticated moose in Alaska |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529185612/https://www.adn.com/wildlife/article/moose-and-men-brief-history-domesticated-moose-alaska/2016/01/03/ |accessdate=17 September 2018 |work=Alaska Dispatch News |date=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During training it was found that the moose was too fearful an animal to allow itself to be ridden into battle, taking fright at the sound of gunfire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Boundary Waters Journal |date=2001 |publisher=Boundary Waters Publishing |page=48 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfAsAQAAMAAJ |accessdate=17 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were also said to be of too peaceful a nature for the purpose.&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;  Moose were also more susceptible to disease than horses and there was difficulty in feeding the animals which were used to foraging across large areas rather than being fed on fodder in pasture.&lt;ref name=geist/&gt;

== April Fools' Day hoax ==
Some news outlets have reported that [[Joseph Stalin]] attempted to introduce the moose as a replacement for horses in Soviet cavalry regiments based in the northern parts of the country during the 1930s.&lt;ref name=andrews/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc2004/&gt;  The story is thought to have been popularised by a 2010 [[April Fools' Day]] article published in the Russian language edition of ''[[Popular Mechanics]]''.&lt;ref name=pm&gt;{{cite news |title=Боевые лоси Советской армии появились в музее! (подлинная история) |url=https://www.popmech.ru/weapon/379732-boevye-losi-sovetskoy-armii-poyavilis-v-muzee-i-da-eto-byla-shutka/#part2 |accessdate=17 September 2018 |work=Popular Mechanics (Russia) |date=31 July 2017 |language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article claimed that 1,500 moose cavalrymen were trained for service in the [[Winter War]] of 1939 and 1940.&lt;ref name=rt/&gt; Machine guns were supposedly mounted to the antlers of the moose.&lt;ref name=pm/&gt;  Among the more outlandish claims was that the start of the war was postponed to avoid clashing with the moose mating season and that the animals could distinguish between the Russian and Finnish languages at a distance of over a kilometre.&lt;ref name=rt&gt;{{cite news |title=Finnish media fall for ‘Soviet battle moose’ hoax, probed by regulator |url=https://www.rt.com/news/410868-finnish-media-moose-cavalry/ |accessdate=17 September 2018 |work=RT International |date=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The article included several photographs supposedly showing members of the moose cavalry unit.  These were in fact posed by members of ''Popular Mechanics''' publishing house dressed in reproduction Red Army uniforms with the moose superimposed in [[Image editing|post-processing]].  A graphics artist, Vitas Chernyauskas, mocked-up the front cover of an instruction manual for the unit, based on contemporary Soviet documents and this was also included in the article.&lt;ref name=pm/&gt;

The hoax article was widely reproduced in Russian media over the following years, often without the April Fools' Day disclaimer carried in the original article.&lt;ref name=rt/&gt;&lt;ref name=pm/&gt;  Posters on military history forums often claimed to have seen, or even read, copies of the fictional instruction manual.&lt;ref name=pm/&gt;  The coverage in newspapers, satirical sites and social media meant that the story gained a measure of credence as a historical fact.&lt;ref name=pm/&gt;  Moose were later successfully domesticated in Soviet Russia but as livestock, for their milk and antlers.&lt;ref name=rt/&gt;

In 2017, a war museum in [[Lakhdenpokhya]], Karelia, Russia showcased the doctored photographs from the ''Popular Mechanics'' article in an exhibition as a recent discovery of historic documents.&lt;ref name=rt/&gt;&lt;ref name=pm/&gt;  The exhibition claimed that the "war moose" had been trained by the Soviet army for four years.&lt;ref name=pm/&gt;  

The story, sourced from the museum exhibition, was covered by the Finnish national public broadcaster [[Yle]] in a television broadcast and as an online news article in June 2017.&lt;ref name=rt/&gt;  Yle was informed of the errors in the story by a member of the public but only issued a correction one month later.  As a consequence they were investigated by the Finnish media regulator the [[Council for Mass Media in Finland]] for failures in fact-checking and responding to the error report.&lt;ref name=rt/&gt;&lt;ref name=cmmf&gt;{{cite web |title=JSN:n langettava päätös Ylelle |url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9944785 |website=Yle UutisetE |publisher=Julkisen sanan neuvosto (Council for Mass Media in Finland) |accessdate=17 September 2018 |language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The erroneous story is still available on the Yle website, including the doctored images from ''Popular Mechanics'', but with a disclaimer and link to the Council for Mass Media's findings.&lt;ref name=cmmf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Suomen armeijan luolaan Venäjällä tehty sotamuseo paljastaa puna-armeijan salaisen aseen: sotahirvet |url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9686135 |accessdate=18 September 2018 |work=Yle Uutiset |language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some information relating to Soviet moose cavalry trials that pre-dates the 2010 hoax.  In 2004 the manager of the [[Kostroma Moose Farm]], where the Soviets domesticated the moose for milk production in the 1940s, claimed that the trials were carried out in the 1930s.  He claimed that "Stalin thought elk could replace horses in cavalry regiments based in the north ... but this did not work out, and the idea was abandoned".&lt;ref name=bbc2004&gt;{{cite news |last=Liss |first=Artyom |title=Russia's elk prove tough to tame |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3557085.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=26 September 2018 |date=22 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''My Teenage Dream Ended''''' is the debut book and album by [[Farrah Abraham]]. Abraham came to prominence in the [[MTV]] reality TV show ''[[Teen Mom]]''.

==Production==
In August 2012, Abraham released the autobiography ''My Teenage Dream Ended'', published by [[MTV Press]]. The book chronicles her teenage pregnancy and the problems she faced during the time, including her drug use, the arrest of her father, and the death of her daughter's father, Derek Underwood.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; The musical album, produced by Fredrick M. Cuevas, is a companion work to her autobiography; each of the ten songs shares a title with a chapter of her book.&lt;ref name="Wetpaint"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bonner |first=Mehera |url=http://www.wetpaint.com/teen-mom/articles/farrah-abraham-releases-her-debut-album-listen-to-every-track-now|title=Farrah Abraham Releases Her Debut Album|publisher=WetPaint |date=August 13, 2012 |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was a success making number 11 on ''[[the New York Times]]'' bestseller list.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite web |last=Durham |first=Jessica |url=http://www.booksnreview.com/articles/791/20120823/my-teenage-dream-ended-farrah-abraham-lands-on-new-york-times-bestseller-list-reveals-drug-abuse-and-one-night-stands.htm|title='My Teenage Dream Ended:' Farrah Abraham Lands On New York Times Bestseller List; Reveals Drug Abuse and One-Night Stands|publisher=Books &amp; Review |date=August 23, 2012 |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abraham recorded her vocals for the album to a [[click track]], while the production of the music was handled separately.&lt;ref name="Fader"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2017/11/21/farrah-abraham-album-producer-interview|title=Farrah Abraham's pop music should make her an avant-garde icon|work=[[The Fader]]|last=Cooper|first=Duncan|date=November 21, 2017|accessdate=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Fader]]'', Cuevas stated: "Like, she'd heard it before and approved it for that song, but as she was recording we never had the music on."&lt;ref name="Fader"/&gt; Abraham also wanted the [[Auto-Tune]] effects on her vocals to sound "edgy", so worked with Cuevas to make them more aggressive.&lt;ref name="Fader"/&gt; The album's first single, "Finally Getting Up from Rock Bottom", was released on August 3, 2012, through ''[[In Touch Weekly]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;http://starcasm.net/archives/169126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
The accompanying album received an overwhelmingly negative response. It has been widely criticized for its extensively [[autotune]]d vocals and bland production. Her single "On My Own" was derided as one of the worst works of pop music ever made, eclipsing [[Rebecca Black]]'s "[[Friday (Rebecca Black song)|Friday]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetrendguys.com/2012/08/30/farrah-abraham-made-the-worst-song-and-music-video-of-all-time/|title=Farrah Abraham Made the Worst Song and Music Video of All Time?|publisher=The Trend Guys|date=August 30, 2012 |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist website [[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] called the lead and sole single, "Finally Getting up from Rock Bottom", "the most horrible combination of sounds to ever be assembled in the history of audio recording", suggesting that while Farrah may have kept her baby, the song should have been [[abortion|aborted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrissey|first=Tracie Egan|title=Teen Mom Farrah Abraham Releases the Worst Song You Will Ever Hear.

But despite garnering mockery in the popular media, the arrhythmic and cheaply digitized presentation of deeply confessional lyrics was bewildering enough to lead some to instead view it as a contemporary example of [[outsider art]].&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{cite web |last=Moore |first=David Cooper |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/09/the-scary-misunderstood-power-of-a-teen-mom-stars-album/262237/|title=The Scary, Misunderstood Power of a 'Teen Mom' Star's Album|work=The Atlantic |date=September 12, 2012 |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fact"&gt;{{cite web |last=Macpherson |first=Alex |url=http://www.factmag.com/2012/09/27/my-teenage-dream-ended|title=My Teenage Dream Ended: Album Review|publisher=Fact |date=September 27, 2012 |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="io9"&gt;{{cite web |last=Freeman |first=Phil |url=http://io9.com/5940002/the-secret-cyborg-genius-of-mtv-teen-moms-farrah-abraham|title=The Secret Cyborg Genius of MTV Teen Mom's Farrah Abraham |publisher=io9 |date=September 3, 2012 |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'', Andrew Nosnitsky called it a "haunting and fascinating mess of outsider pop music".&lt;ref name=Wire&gt;''The Wire'' '''345''', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', David Cooper Moore suggested that the album "is to teen angst what ''[[Eraserhead]]'' was to domestic angst", making it "a dark and compelling experiment in abstracting and compressing the vicissitudes of 'high school drama.'"&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt; ''[[The Village Voice]]'' compared it to critically acclaimed [[Witch house (music genre)|witch house]] band [[Salem (Michigan band)|Salem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Maura|title=Farrah Abraham: The Salem Of Teen Mom?|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/08/farrah_abraham_getting_up_from_rock_bottom.php|publisher=Village Voice|accessdate=March 5, 2013|date=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' ranked it 32 on their list of best albums of the year.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/nov/26/guardian-best-albums-2012-40-21 |title=Best albums of 2012: 40-21 |work=The Guardian |date=November 26, 2012 |accessdate=January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 review for [[Charli XCX]]'s ''[[Pop 2 (mixtape)|Pop 2]]'' mixtape, Meaghan Garvey of ''[[Pitchfork (magazine)|Pitchfork]]'' retrospectively summarized: "Sweepingly ridiculed as one of 2012's worst albums, that judgment, five years later, feels wildly narrow-minded. It is a baffling work, to be sure: frantic layers of dubstep, EDM, witch-house, and breakbeats seem to run in the opposite direction as Abraham's absurdly AutoTuned narratives about surviving the death of her husband. [...] After my first full spin of ''Pop 2'', I couldn't shake the thought: 'This sounds like Farrah, but good.'"&lt;ref name="Pitchfork"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/charli-xcx-pop-2/|title=Charli XCX: Pop 2 Album Review|work=[[Pitchfork (magazine)|Pitchfork]]|last=Garvey|first=Meaghan|date=December 20, 2017|accessdate=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''News Probe'''''&lt;ref&gt;新聞調查&lt;/ref&gt; is a documentary television programme in [[China Central Television]] that has aired since 1996. It attempts to investigate various news, issues, and scandals, aiming to reveal the social problems and the insufficiencies of state policies. Its Chinese title, ''Xinwen Diaocha'', means "News Investigations". Together with '''Oriental Horizon''' (東方時空), '''Focus Report''' (焦點訪談)and '''Tell It Like It Is''' (實話實說) News Probe shares the similar reputation in documentary television programmes in China.

==Mission==
===General mission of CCTV News Programs===
*Authority (權威)
*Reality (真實)
*Richness (豐富)
*Liveliness (鮮活)

===Additional mission of News Probe===
*Reporting the happening history and finding out the news in the news (正在發生的歷史，新聞背後的新聞)
*Encourage viewers to develop their own understanding of China problems
*Cultivate new generation of China being more sensitive and critical to diverse problems and dilemma
*Allow the audience to acquire a global horizon while viewing different issues in relation to other countries
*Initiate reform for societal progress

==Development==
The maiden broadcast of 'Oriental Horizon'(東方時空) on May 1, 1993 signified the start of the broadcast of [[Political criticism|commentary]] programme on current affairs. One year later, on April 1, 1994, a similar programme [http://www.cctv.com/program/jdft/01/index.shtml Focus Report](焦點訪談), which means a talk show on the hottest topics, was broadcast. At the prime time of 9p.m. on May 17, 1996, the first episode of News Probe-- "Hongzhi Ban"(宏志班) was broadcast. The programme 'News Probe' is produced as a result of the ongoing development of such kind of programme. The founders of 'News Probe' expected this programme to report in a much detailed, in-depth, objective, systematic and authoritative way.

During the past developmental years, the production team found a position for the program. News Probe is thus aired as an investigative doucumentary, not only a commentary one.

The reason of setting up this position is due to the vast competitions from other news programmes in CCTV. Focus Report(焦點訪談) provides detailed and universal description for different news events while 'Oriental Horizon'(東方時空) is good at rousing audiences' emotion during news reporting. Besides, the broadcasting time of News Probe is beyond all these news programs. Therefore, what News Probe can do is to provide innovative reporting methods so as to raise audiences' interests. As a result, an investigative reporting style was developed.

At the earlier stage of the program, the criteria on choosing the program topic are known as the slogan of "Sanxing" (三性), which means whether the topic is worth reporting, editing into program and investigating. However, in most cases, the three criteria are separately considered and only part of them are fulfilled. Afterwards, four methods of choosing a topic have been developed, known as the investigation on the theme, consensus, event and the inside skinny. 

Being an investigative documentary, the News Probe raised the slogan of "hunting the truth", which consists of 2 layers of meaning. Firstly, to 
uncover the inside skinny which is concealed by some people or organizations, and those secret incidents which harm the public interest. News Probe thus also includes some reports involving wrongdoings by governmental departments, such as corruption in the Chinese Police. Secondly, News Probe also aimed at providing deep discussion on the complex problems that being investigated. 

The production crew does not aim at generating any conclusion for each episode. Instead, it allows the audience to make their own judgements after viewing the programs.

Since News Probe has been developed into an investigative documentary, it has its own characteristics:
*The reporters of News Probe must cultivate a sense of investigation
*The core part of the program is the process of investigation but not only the description of the event
*The investigation process is initiated by the suspension of reporters on certain events, and it ends when the suspension is proved.

To cut in short, the performance of the reporters during the investigation process determines the quality of the investigative documentary, therefore, reporters should be able in appling different methods depended on different situations in order to carry out a good programme .

Reporters of the programme must also reach several criteria of the production crew. They must be:
*rational in order to investigate the events in objective manners;
*able to exchange ideas and examine issues at the same time;
*able to look into issues in audiences point of view;
*fair to all the parties involved in the events and should be unbiased to certain parties; and
*able to raise questions towards every parts of the events

==Reporting Style==
''News Probe'' based on the framework of “Investigative” Reporting. Investigative means from unknown to known, marching toward the darkness. Investigators intervene into internal parts of the incidents and find out the truth systematically. They need to stand in an objective position and base on real evidences. 
(refer to the second publication of ''News Probe'': 目擊歷史﹕新聞調查幕後的故事)

Through continuously questioning and criticizing a range of social issues, News Probe has developed its unique style and made people aware of the blind spots of China, where sometimes also report affairs of China in connection with other countries. By reporting on social issues such as the proliferation of AIDS and [[SARS]] in China, the problem of [[Greenhouse effect]], pollution in China and Germany (which is an episode in 1997), via interviewing the people involved, and by questioning everything, the objectives of the program are thus reached. 

Investigation of each episode is initiated by reporters' suspect towards the events. The reporters then start the investigation together with the production crew. Apart from reporters' own finding of the stories, the general public can also tell the secret incidents through contacting the production crew directly, via the use of mail, news [[hotline]] and email. 

Apart from interviewing the involved parties, crews of ''News Probe'' also investigate issues by different methods, such as consulting powerful institutions (for example, they have consulted India Wildlife Conservation Society, Wildlife Protection Organization, India Wildlife Trade Association, International Convention on the Trading of Endangered species and Asia Wild Life Trade Research Committees in the episode of "The death of Tibetan antalope") and people, referring to reference books, studying the issue’s history etc. These empirical methods enable News Probe to investigate issues in an objective and unbiased manner. 

The programme itself is a report of the truth and is a reveal of the process of investigation made by crew. Each episode includes the discovery of the problems, the investigatory work done by the reporters and the crew, the evidence collected and all the way down to the exposure of the truth.

==Basic composition of an episode==
*Narration: Process of the incidents and the truth
*Figure description: Experience of the main characters and description on his/her disposition
*Investigation: Internal and external reasons

==Production Mechanism==
The production crew of the program includes the following posts (in hieratical order):

==Topic criteria==

*it must have special characteristics which can reflect some social changes

Length of the program: about 40 minutes each episode

==Transmission area==

==Example episode==
Name: [http://www.cctv.com/program/xwdc/20031210/100314.shtml Pay for innocent](無罪的代價)

The government prosecuted a businessman, called Chan Yuen-Ho, over bribes. After his three-year imprisonment, the government released him because of lack of evidence.

''News Probe'' resolved to find out the inside story of the case. After interviewing the involved people, they found that the government prosecuted Chan Yuen-Ho because Chan was inobedient in taking advice and orders from the government. He rejected the government's advice of stopping external investment in his company.

Chan was insistent on his innocence and appealed to the high court continuously. He was released after three years of prison life. However, his company went bankrupt during these three years.

===Evaluation on the example===
''News Probe'' has been a pioneer, providing a rare voice to investigate the
actions of the Chinese government. It has courage to interview the involved officials by asking to-the-point questions and let audience know the actions of the China government. 
It has allowed formerly voiceless persons to speak, and their Web site has allowed viewers to have their opinion heard. In this case, it gives a valuable opportunity for Chan Yuen-Ho to fight for the just response from the government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4397">[[File:Padlocked newspaper.jpg|thumb|300px|The doorway of the newspaper "La Clarté", weekly French-language newspaper of the Communist Party of Canada, padlocked by the police in Montreal in 1937.]]
The '''Padlock Law''' (officially called "Act to protect the Province Against Communistic Propaganda") ('''French:''' "La loi du cadenas" / "Loi protégeant la province contre la propagande communiste", 1 [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] Ch. 11) was an Act of the province of Quebec, passed on March 17, 1937 by the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] government of [[Maurice Duplessis]], that was intended to prevent the dissemination of [[communist propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=Conrad|title=Duplessis|date=1977|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart|location=Toronto|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act made it illegal to "use [a house] or allow any person to make use of it to propagate [[Communism]] or [[Bolshevism]] by any means whatsoever" as well as the printing, publishing or distributing of "any newspaper, periodical, pamphlet, circular, document or writing, propagating Communism or Bolshevism." A violation of the Act subjected such property to being ordered closed by the Attorney General - "padlocked" - against any use whatsoever for a period of up to one year, and any person found guilty of involvement in prohibited media activities could be incarcerated for three to thirteen months.

[[File:News. Communistic Literature BAnQ P48S1P02676.jpg|thumb|left|Men reading confiscated literature in [[Montreal City Hall]], 1938]] The law was extremely vague; it did not define Communism or Bolshevism in any concrete way.  It denied both the [[presumption of innocence]] and [[freedom of speech]] to individuals. There were also concerns that the law would be used in order to arrest individual activists from international [[trade union]]s. Two union leaders were nearly arrested in that period.&lt;ref&gt;Rouillard, Jacques (1989). ''Le syndicalisme québécois : Deux siècles d'histoire.'' Montréal: Éditions Boréal, at page 68. {{ISBN|2-89052-243-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it was applied frequently against a range of radical leftist groups, allegations that Duplessis used it against political opponents, including the left-wing [[United Jewish Peoples' Order]] in 1950, reports that it was used against the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] are incorrect: the authorities typically used municipal by-laws, such as the one featured in [[Saumur v. The City of Quebec]].

The federal government under [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] could have used its power of [[disallowance and reservation|disallowance]] to nullify the Padlock Law, as it had done to overturn equally controversial laws that had been passed by [[Alberta]]'s [[Alberta Social Credit Party|Social Credit government]] around the same time.  However, King chose not to intervene in Quebec.  The most likely reason is that King did not want to alienate rural voters in Quebec, who continued to support the Liberals federally even as they supported the Union Nationale provincially.

In the 1957 decision of ''[[Switzman v. Elbling]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] struck down the law as unconstitutional because it not only violated the constitutional right to free speech, but because provincial governments did not have the power to legislate in the field of criminal law.

'''Pal Mickey''' is a discontinued [[interactivity|interactive]] [[stuffed toy]] developed by [[The Walt Disney Company]] and previously sold at [[Walt Disney World]]. Pal Mickey was discontinued and no new stock is available for purchase as of October 2008. 

The toy is a ten-inch (26.5&amp;nbsp;cm) plush model of [[Mickey Mouse]], soft and easy for children to hold. Inside, it contains a [[microprocessor]], a speaker, three AA batteries, three squeeze sensors (one in each hand and one in its belly), and an [[infrared]] receiver in its nose. A loop on the back of its head fits a clip or a [[lanyard]] hook for ease of carrying.

Pal Mickey was sold for use at the four [[theme park]]s at Walt Disney World Resort: the [[Magic Kingdom]], [[Epcot]], [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]], and [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]]. Guests could previously purchase Pal Mickey at various on site hotel gift shops, all four theme parks, and [[Downtown Disney (Walt Disney World)|Downtown Disney]]. It communicates invisibly with more than four hundred infrared transmitters around these parks. It will periodically giggle and vibrate to indicate that it has information to provide; when its belly or hand is squeezed, it will speak up with information about the immediate area, parade and showtime reminders, tips on what costumed walkaround characters may be nearby, and attractions with short queue times. It "remembers" where it has been so as to avoid repeating itself.

If it is squeezed when it has no tips to provide or when it is not at a park, it will tell jokes and play simple games. The toy is programmed with over seven hundred pre-recorded phrases. On September 2014, Disney ceased supporting Pal Mickey at the parks. &lt;ref name=pm2014&gt;[http://www.wdwmagic.com/other/mymagicplus/news/22sep2014-pal-mickey-support-to-end-this-week.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;.  As of July 2017 Pal Mickey continues to automatically provide information about its immediate area, but no longer provides updates on character meet and greets or parade and showtime reminders.

==Versions==
The original version of Pal Mickey (commonly referred to as "1.0") was introduced in May 2003. It was dressed in red shorts with white buttons, white gloves, and yellow shoes. It sold for US$50, with rentals available for $8 per day plus a $50 deposit to return it by noon the following day; if not returned, that deposit was forfeited and the toy was considered sold. This version of the toy came with a clip. The rental program was discontinued at the end of 2004.

The "Happiest Celebration On Earth" version of the toy (commonly referred to as "2.0") was introduced on May 5, 2005 with the start of the [[Happiest Homecoming on Earth|Happiest Celebration on Earth]] events. It is priced at US$65. It is dressed in red shorts with gold buttons, white gloves, and yellow shoes; it wears a [[tailcoat]] and a gold [[bowtie]], both of which fasten with [[velcro]]. It comes with a clip and a lanyard for carrying it. This version improves on the original in many small ways, such as by having a louder speaker, and it is able to sing Disney songs and ask Disney character trivia questions. Permanently attached to its right hand is a golden medallion; squeezing its right hand will make Mickey giggle and will make a "Happiest Celebration on Earth Glow Medallion" (sold during 2005) light up.

In September 2006, the "Pal Mickey Sorcerer Costume" (commonly referred to as "3.0") replaced the previous version of the toy. This Pal Mickey is dressed in a (removable) blue Sorcerer Mickey hat, red robe, and blue shorts (sewn on over Mickey's red shorts, which have white buttons like the first release). It does not have the medallion on its hand.

A [[Spanish language]] version of Pal Mickey was also available.

Four costumes for the toy were made available in early 2006. The costumes are "Mickey Mouse Club", "Pin Trading", "Safari", and "Rain Wear", and sell for US$10 each. In October 2006, "Pirate Cap'n" and "Santa Mickey" costumes were made available for US$12 each. The "Santa Mickey" sold out during December 2006 and was not available for order through the WDW Mail Order department. However, it returned for the 2007 Holiday season.

The toy was discontinued in fall 2008. The toy continued to work until September 2014.  At that point Disney stopped servicing the infrared technology to focus more on their RFID technology used in their magic bands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wdwmagic.com/other/mymagicplus/news/22sep2014-pal-mickey-support-to-end-this-week.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games==
The original version of the toy provided a choice of three games, triggered by squeezing both of its hands at the same time.

*''That Isn't Here:'' Pal Mickey will choose a theme park and will speak the names of park attractions, and the player has to squeeze the toy's hand or tummy depending on whether or not that attraction is in the chosen park. If Pal Mickey is used within any of the four Walt Disney World theme parks, Pal Mickey will automatically select the theme park that it is already in and will keep selecting the park until the person either turns off Pal Mickey or leaves the park.
*''Mickey Says:'' Similar to [[Simon Says]]. The player must only follow Pal Mickey's direction if it is preceded by "Mickey says".
*''Fast Friends:'' Pal Mickey will speak the names of Disney characters, and the player must respond to each in a specific way. For example, "when I say Goofy, squeeze my left hand" or "when I say the name of someone who can fly, squeeze my right hand."

These games are added in the "Happiest Celebration on Earth" and later versions of the toy, for a total of six games. The above three games are triggered by squeezing the toy's tummy and right hand at the same time; the below three games are triggered by squeezing its tummy and left hand at the same time.

*''Follow Me:'' Similar to ''[[Simon (game)|Simon]]''. The player has to repeat a sequence of actions as directed by Pal Mickey, with one additional action being added to the sequence each time.
*''Try 'n' Keep Up:'' The player must react quickly to Pal Mickey's directions.
*''Repeating Myself:'' Pal Mickey will speak the names of Disney characters, and the player must squeeze its tummy if it repeats a name it has already said.

==Technical information==

Pal Mickey's electronics and batteries are encased in plastic housings (the original version's housing is black or white, the second version's is yellow, and the third version's is white) which can be accessed by unzipping the back of the toy. Beneath the zipper is an on/off switch which enables or disables the toy's squeeze and infrared sensors to prolong battery life.

The toys are shipped with batteries installed, and they are set to "demo mode" while they are on store shelves: they ignore infrared signals, and squeezing them will make them recite a sample of tips as if they were near park attractions.

It has been reported that the infrared transmitters in the parks are able to identify individual Pal Mickey toys and roughly track their locations as they are carried around, thereby letting Disney collect information about guests' progress through the parks. If this is true, the information collected would be anonymous, since nothing identifies a specific Pal Mickey as belonging to a specific person or family. However this is very useful as it shows a general pattern for families, who are Disney's main target audience. Most guest with a Pal Mickey are likely to have children, therefore this shows what attractions are and aren't popular with younger visitors. Nothing has been said about whether they will expand this idea to the other Disney Resorts.

{{Rights}}
The '''right of publicity''', often called '''personality rights''', is the right of an individual to control the commercial use of his or her name, image, likeness, or other unequivocal aspects of one's [[personal identity|identity]]. It is generally considered a property right as opposed to a personal right, and as such, the validity of the right of publicity can survive the death of the individual (to varying degrees depending on the jurisdiction).

==Classification==
Personality rights are generally considered to consist of two types of rights: the right of publicity, or to keep one's image and likeness from being commercially exploited without permission or contractual compensation, which is similar to the use of a [[trademark]]; and the [[right to privacy]], or the right to be left alone and not have one's personality represented publicly without permission. In [[common law]] jurisdictions, '''publicity rights''' fall into the realm of the [[tort]] of [[passing off]]. [[United States]] [[jurisprudence]] has substantially extended this right.

A commonly cited justification for this doctrine, from a policy standpoint, is the notion of [[natural rights]] and the idea that every individual should have a right to control how, if at all, his or her "persona" is commercialized by third parties.  Usually, the motivation to engage in such commercialization is to help propel sales or visibility for a product or service, which usually amounts to some form of [[commercial speech]] (which in turn receives the lowest level of judicial scrutiny). If an individual violates this right they will have to go through a lawsuit.{{clarify|date=February 2017}}

==Civil law and common law jurisdictions==
[[Image:Map of the Legal systems of the world (en).png|thumb|Legal systems of the world: civil law in blue, common law in red.]]

In contrast with common law jurisdictions, most [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions have specific civil code provisions that protect an individual's image, personal data and other generally private information.  Exceptions have been carved out of these general, broad privacy rights when dealing with news and public figures. Thus, while it may violate an ordinary citizen's privacy to speak about their medical records, one is generally allowed to report on more intimate details in the lives of celebrities and politicians.

Unlike most common law jurisdictions the personality rights in civil law are generally inheritable, thus one can make a claim against someone who invades the privacy of a deceased relative if the memory of their character is besmirched by such publication.

[[Image:Common law world.png|thumb|
{{Legend|#000075|Common law}}
{{Legend|#0075FF|Mixed systems using elements of common law}}
{{Legend|#A3A3A3|Civil, customary and/or religious law &lt;small&gt;(see map above)&lt;/small&gt;}}]]

Personality rights have developed out of [[common law]] concepts of [[property]], [[trespass]] and intentional [[tort]].  Thus personality rights are, generally speaking, judge-made law, though there are [[jurisdiction]]s where some aspects of personality rights are statutory. In some jurisdictions, publicity rights and privacy rights are not clearly distinguished, and the term publicity right is generally used. In a publicity rights case the issue to decide is whether a significant section of the public would be misled into believing (incorrectly) that a commercial arrangement had been concluded between a [[plaintiff]] and a [[defendant]] under which the plaintiff agreed to the advertising involving the image or reputation of a famous person. The actionable misrepresentation requires a suggestion that the plaintiff has endorsed or licensed the defendant's products, or somehow can exercise control over those products. This is done by way of the [[tort]] of [[passing off]].

The meaning of the law is best illustrated by principal cases on the subject.

==Country-specific jurisdictions==

===Australia===
In Australia, false association or endorsement is actionable via the law of [[passing off]], not a separate law of "right of personality". The ''Henderson'' case&lt;ref&gt;''Henderson v Radio Corp Pty Ltd'', (1960) 60 SR(NSW) 576, [1969] RPC 218&lt;/ref&gt; was a decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales (both the first instance and appellate jurisdiction). The plaintiffs were [[ballroom dance]]rs and they sued the defendant in passing off alleging it wrongfully published their photograph on the cover of a gramophone record entitled ''Strictly for Dancing: Vol. 1''. An injunction was granted on the ground that the use suggested the plaintiffs recommended or approved of the defendant's goods, or had some connection with the goods.

However, in the 1988 case of ''Honey v Australian Airlines'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Re Gary Honey v Australian Airlines Limited and House of Tabor Inc|link=|court=FCA|num=177|year=1989|parallelcite=|date=18 May 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Honey, a well known Australian athlete failed in his attempt to get a damages award after [[Australian Airlines]] used a photograph of him in action on a poster without his permission.  The judge held, in essence, that the poster depicted excellence in general rather than a particular person.

===Canada===

====Statutory protection====
The provinces of [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], and [[Saskatchewan]] have enacted privacy legislation dealing with personality rights, which have the following traits:{{sfn|Conroy|2012|pp=4{{endash}}7}}

#An appropriation of personality can be achieved through the use of a person’s name, likeness, or voice (but British Columbia has a more restrictive definition).
#The plaintiff must be identified or identifiable by the use made of his persona.
#An action for the appropriation of personality can only succeed where the defendant intended to commit the wrong (but British Columbia has no "intention" requirement).
#The defendant’s use of the plaintiff’s persona must have resulted in a gain or advantage for the defendant (but British Columbia has a more restrictive definition, relating only to commercial gain).
#An appropriation of personality is actionable without proof of damages.
#The right of action for appropriation of personality is extinguished upon the death of the person whose privacy was violated.
#The following constitute statutory defences in all four provinces: (i) that the plaintiff consented to the use of his persona; (ii) that the use of the plaintiff’s persona was incidental to the exercise of a lawful right of defence of person or property; (iii) that the use was authorized or required under a provincial law or by a court, or any process of a court; and (iv) that the act was that of a peace officer acting in the course of his or her duties. The Manitoba Act provides additional defences.

====Common law provinces====
Canadian common law recognizes a limited right to personality. It was first acknowledged in the 1971 Ontario decision of ''[[Krouse v. Chrysler Canada Ltd.]]'', where the Court held that where a person has marketable value in their likeness and it has been used in a manner that suggests an endorsement of a product then there is grounds for an action in appropriation of personality. This right was later expanded upon in ''[[Athans v. Canadian Adventure Camps]]'' (1977) where the Court held that the personality right included both image and name.

In ''[[Gould Estate v. Stoddart Publishing Co. Ltd.]]'' (1998), the Ontario Court of Appeal concluded that simply writing &lt;u&gt;about&lt;/u&gt; somebody, even for the purpose of generating a profit, does not constitute appropriation of personality.

The general tort of appropriation of personality is still in development, but it is currently{{when|date=June 2017}} being argued that it will be recognized in all common law provinces,{{sfn|Conroy|2012|p=10}} with certain characteristics:{{sfn|Conroy|2012|pp=11{{endash}}14}}

#''Athans'' confirms that there is "a proprietary right in the exclusive marketing for gain of his personality, image and name..."
#There is always a requirement that the plaintiff be identifiable.
#An action for appropriation of personality will have to be intentional for a plaintiff to recover at common law.
#There is a requirement that the defendant must have acted for the purpose of commercial gain, but ''Gould'' suggests that this may be restricted to "endorsement-type situations".
#It is a matter of uncertainty whether the common law tort of appropriation of personality is actionable ''[[per se (terminology)|per se]]'' or whether damages must be shown.
#Privacy rights are extinguished upon death, but personality rights are inheritable.
#A defendant will not be liable for an appropriation of personality at common law where: (i) he has consented to the use of his persona; (ii) the use made of his personality rights was merely incidental to another purpose; or (iii) the publication constituted a matter of public interest.

====Quebec====
In 1994, the new ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]'' introduced new provisions that enshrine the right to privacy as an attribute of personality:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|3}}, {{cite CCQ|36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|
'''3.''' Every person is the holder of personality rights, such as the right to life, the right to the inviolability and integrity of his person, and the right to the respect of his name, reputation and privacy. These rights are inalienable.

...

'''36.''' The following acts, in particular, may be considered as invasions of the privacy of a person:

:(1) entering or taking anything in his dwelling;
:(2) intentionally intercepting or using his private communications;
:(3) appropriating or using his image or voice while he is in private premises;
:(4) keeping his private life under observation by any means;
:(5) using his name, image, likeness or voice for a purpose other than the legitimate information of the public;
:(6) using his correspondence, manuscripts or other personal documents.
}}

In ''[[Aubry v Éditions Vice-Versa Inc]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] also affirmed that under Quebec's ''[[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]]'' privacy provisions, a photographer can take photographs in public places but may not publish the picture unless permission has been obtained from the subject, except where the subject appears in an incidental manner, or whose professional success depends on public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Aubry v Éditions Vice-Versa Inc|link=Aubry v Éditions Vice-Versa Inc|year=1998|court=scc|num=817|format=canlii|pinpoint=par. 55{{en dash}}59|parallelcite=[1998] 1 SCR 591|date=1998-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relevant provisions of the ''Charter'' are:

{{cquote|
'''4.'''  Every person has a right to the safeguard of his dignity, honour and reputation.

'''5.'''  Every person has a right to respect for his private life.
}}

Therefore, the following general characteristics may be drawn:{{sfn|Conroy|2012|pp=15{{endash}}17}}

#An appropriation of personality can be realized through the use of a person’s name, likeness, or voice.
#The plaintiff must be recognizable in order  an appropriation of personality to be actionable.
#There is no need for the courts to look for an element of intent.
#Distinctions based on commercial purposes are irrelevant, and inconsistent with s 9.1 of the Quebec ''Charter''.
#The plaintiff is required to show that she suffered damage through the appropriation of her personality rights.
#Quebec law may allow an action to be taken by the estate of a deceased person, provided that it can be proved that there is a patrimonial aspect at stake.
#A defendant will not be liable for an appropriation of personality under Quebec law where: (i) the plaintiff expressly or impliedly consented to the appropriation of his personality; (ii) the use of the individual’s persona is incidental to another purpose; (iii) the appropriation of personality is authorized by law; or (iv) the publication is a matter of public interest.

===Cyprus===
In [[Cyprus]], people depicted in photographs can oppose their use in advertisements and their publication in magazines, even if it was taken in a public place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dataprotection.gov.cy/dataprotection/dataprotection.nsf/All/819392DD9D123E4CC225750B00379242?OpenDocument |script-title=el:Γραφείο Επιτρόπου Προστασίας Δεδομένων Προσωπικού Χαρακτήρα - Αποφάσεις |language=el |publisher=Dataprotection.gov.cy |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
In [[Denmark]], the [[Danish Penal Code]] chapters 26 and 27, provides certain personality rights. The governmental Danish Data Protection Agency, has made a declaration regarding publication on the Internet of pictures taken of persons in a public area:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datatilsynet.dk/borger/internettet/billeder-paa-internettet/ Datatilsynet: Billeder på internettet] (in Danish)&lt;/ref&gt;
:''The predominant point of reference, is that any publication of a portrait photograph requires consent [of the person depicted]. The reasoning for this, is that such a publication might provide the depicted person with discomfort, possibly with other information such as name, of the publication for all with access to the internet, and the considerations of this discomfort is judged as more important than a possible interest in publication.''
A portrait photograph is defined as a photograph, with the purpose of depicting one or more specific person(s). The personality rights however may be contracted for persons who are generally accepted as public persons.

===France===
In [[France]] personality rights are protected under article 9 of the French civil code.  While publicly known facts and images of public figures are not generally protected, use of someone's image or personal history has been held actionable under French law. The most famous case in recent history is perhaps the publication of the book on [[François Mitterrand]] called ''Le Grand Secret''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gubler|first= Claude|year= 2005|title= Le Grand Secret|trans-title=|url= https://www.amazon.fr/Le-grand-secret-Claude-Gubler/dp/2268053849|language= fr|location= |publisher= Éditions du Rocher|isbn= 978-2-26805384-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Mitterrand's doctor published a book that not only revealed private facts about Mitterrand's life, but also revealed medical confidences protected by [[Physician–patient privilege|doctor–patient privilege]].

===Germany===
In [[Germany]] personality rights are protected under the German civil code, where the concept of an "absolute person of contemporary history" allows the depiction of individuals who are part of history but still gives them some protection of their rights of privacy outside the public sphere. A succinct statement of the German law can be found in the following judicial statement from the ''[[Marlene Dietrich]] case'':

{{cquote|
The general right of personality has been recognised in the case law of the Bundesgerichtshof since 1954 as a basic right constitutionally guaranteed by Arts 1 and 2 of the Basic Law and at the same time as an "other right" protected in civil law under § 823 (1) of the BGB (constant case law since BGHZ 13, 334, 338 - readers' letters). It guarantees as against all the world the protection of human dignity and the right to free development of the personality. Special forms of manifestation of the general right of personality are the right to one's own picture (§§ 22 ff. of the KUG) and the right to one's name (§ 12 of the BGB). They guarantee protection of the personality for the sphere regulated by them (reference omitted).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Marlene Dietrich Case|vol= |reporter= BGH|opinion= 1 ZR 49/97|pinpoint= |court= |date= 1 December 1999|url= http://www.utexas.edu/law/academics/centers/transnational/work_new/german/case.php?id=726|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

===Greece===
The relevant Greek laws include 57 AK and 2472/1997. As regarding photography:
* '''Taking a picture of a person in a public space:''' Requires consent. Taking a photo or video of someone or drawing them in a painting constitutes an illegal act by itself according to Article 57 of the Greek Civil Code (57 ΑΚ, 57 Αστικός Κώδικας) even without any publication of the resulting photo, video or drawing. The law assumes that consent has been provided silently if the depicted person has been paid for the photography session. The law also provides some exceptions for persons of ''contemporary history''.&lt;ref name="greek57ak"&gt;http://greeklaws.com/pubs/uploads/2795.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the law 2472/1997 also applies in many circumstances, even in photographing political rallies in public places or in photographing the police; Greece also requires photographers to obtain a government permit before photographing people participating in political protests in public places.&lt;ref name="greekpolice"&gt;{{cite web|author=e-Lawyer |url=http://elawyer.blogspot.gr/2009/12/blog-post_8090.html |title=E-Lawyer: Λήψη φωτογραφιών σε δημόσιες συναθροίσεις παρουσία αστυνομίας |publisher=Elawyer.blogspot.gr |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Publishing pictures of a person in a public space:''' Requires consent.&lt;ref name="greek57ak" /&gt; The publication of photographs of identifiable police officers beating civilians in public places may be against the law 2472/1997 and as such these images should be turned to the authorities for review.&lt;ref name="greekpolice" /&gt;
* '''Commercial use of a published picture of a person in a public space:''' Requires consent.&lt;ref name="greek57ak" /&gt;

===Guernsey===
The relevant Guernsey law was enacted on 3 December 2012 under the name of [http://www.guernseylegalresources.gg/article/104749/Image-Rights-Bailiwick-of-Guernsey-Ordinance-2012 Image Rights Bailiwick of Guernsey Ordinance 2012] and allows for the registration of a personality right, together with images associated with that personality. Images are widely defined and can be any number of personal attributes, such as likeness, mannerisms, gestures, voice, nickname etc.

Personalities able to register fall into 5 categories, namely sole, joint, group, legal and fictional character. In addition, humans can be registered up to 100 years after the date of death, making the law very favourable for estate managers and trustees.

===Hong Kong===
In [[Hong Kong]], as in most other common law jurisdictions, there is no separate "personality right", and false association or endorsement is actionable under the law of passing off. The main case on this point relates to [[Cantopop]] singer/actor [[Andy Lau]] and [[Hang Seng Bank]] over the allegedly unauthorized use of Lau's image on [[credit card]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Hong Kong case|litigants=Lau Tak Wah Andy v. Hang Seng Bank Limited|list=HCA|number=3968|year=1999|date=29 April 1999|id=21956|hklii=648|pinpoint=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has led to the observation that only limited personality rights exist in this jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Peter K. Yu|year= 2010|title= No Personality Rights for Pop Stars in Hong Kong?|ssrn= 1672311|journal= |publisher= [[Drake University Law School]]|series= Drake University Law School Research Paper|issue= 12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jamaica===
In a 1994 case involving the estate of [[Bob Marley]], the [[Supreme Court of Jamaica]] acknowledged a property right of personality which survived his death.&lt;ref&gt;''Robert Marley Foundation v Dino Michelle Ltd'' (1994), Supreme Court of Jamaica, No. CL R-115 of 1992 (unreported), noted in {{cite journal |author1 = B.

While personality rights are said to exist to some extent by a Korean attorney,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://klawguru.com/2014/02/21/personality-rights-under-korean-law/|title=Personality Rights under Korean Law|date=21 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; cases filed to enforce such rights against shopping malls have been unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kdramastars.com/articles/14310/20140115/personality-rights-song-seung-hun-wins-but-jang-dong-gun-loses-litigation-why.htm|title=‘Personality Rights’ Song Seung Hun Wins But Jang Dong Gun Loses Litigation, Why?|first=|last=kdramastars.com|date=15 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohkpop.com/208495/can-korean-stars-have-celebritys-personality-rights |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722005210/http://www.ohkpop.com/208495/can-korean-stars-have-celebritys-personality-rights |archivedate=2015-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Republic of China===
In the [[People's Republic of China]], rights of personality are established by statute.
According to article 99 and 100 of  the [[General Principle of Civil Law (China)|General Principle of Civil Law]] of the People's Republic of China, the right of name and the right of image are protected. It is prohibited to use another's image for commercial use without that person's consent.
In the new{{when|date=October 2014}} Tort Liabilities Law, the right of privacy is mentioned for the first time in the legislation.

===South Africa===
In [[South Africa]] personality rights are protected under the [[South African law of delict]] and the [[Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa|Bill of Rights]], which also provides for [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and [[freedom of association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burchell|first=Jonathan|title=The Legal Protection of Privacy in South Africa: A Transplantable Hybrid|url=http://www.ejcl.org/131/art131-2.pdf|date=March 2009|work=Electronic Journal of Comparative Law|accessdate=30 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207084836/http://www.ejcl.org/131/art131-2.pdf|archivedate=7 December 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; After much uncertainty concerning the recognition of [[image rights]] in [[South Africa]], the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]] provided clarity in the landmark case of ''Grütter v Lombard''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZASCA/2007/2.html|title=Grütter v Lombard and Another (628/05) [2007] ZASCA 2; [2007] 3 All SA 311 (SCA) (20 February 2007)|website=www.saflii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2007 4 SA 89 (SCA).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/11380578/Image_Rights_in_South_Africa Cornelius, Steve. "Image Rights in South Africa" 2008/3-4 ''International Sports Law Journal'' 71.]&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, a person's right to identity is violated if the attributes of that person is used without permission in a way which cannot be reconciled with the true image of that person.&lt;ref&gt;''O'Keeffe v Argus Printing and Publishing Co Ltd'' 1954 3 SA 244 (C).&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the unauthorized use of a person's image, this kind of infringement also entails some kind of misrepresentation concerning the individual, such as that the individual approves or endorses a particular product or service or that an attorney is a partner in a firm, while this is not the case.  Secondly, the right to identity is violated if the attributes of a person is used without authorization by another person for commercial gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAWCHC/2009/173.html|title=Wells v Atoll Media (Pty) Ltd and Another (11961/2006) [2009] ZAWCHC 173; [2010] 4 All SA 548 (WCC) (9 November 2009)|website=www.saflii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAGPJHC/2011/56.html|title=Kumalo v Cycle Lab (Pty) Ltd (31871/2008) [2011] ZAGPJHC 56 (17 June 2011)|website=www.saflii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the unauthorized use of the individual's image, such use also primarily entails a commercial motive which is exclusively aimed at promoting a service or product or to solicit clients or customers.  The mere fact that the user may benefit or profit from any product or service in respect of which the individual's attributes have incidentally been used, is not in itself sufficient.  This violation of the right to identity therefore also entails unauthorized use of the individual's attributes with a commercial purpose, whether it is done by means of advertisement or the manufacture and distribution of merchandise covered with the attributes of the individual. Personality rights are not absolute and it goes without saying that the use of a person's attributes must be unlawful before a plaintiff will succeed with any claim.  With the use of a person's image, the personality rights, privacy, [[human dignity]] and [[freedom of association]] of the individual must often be weighed against the user's right to [[freedom of expression]].  The use of a person’s image can be justified on the grounds of consent, truth and public interest, fair comment and jest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/11380508/Commercial_Appropriation_of_a_Persons_Image Cornelius, Steve. "Commercial Appropriation of a Person's Image" 2011 ''Potchefstroom Electronic Law Journal'' 182.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the agency (Spanish) Data Protection for the collection and dissemination on Internet of images of a person without their consent may be a serious breach of the Data Protection Act which would be punishable by a minimum fine of 60,000 euros.  According to ''El Mundo'' Data Protection Agency decided to investigate ex officio by the mere distribution of the image of a person on the Internet without their consent.&lt;ref&gt;Article by Paloma Días Sotero, El Mundo, p.&amp;nbsp;33, February 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, the right of publicity is a [[state law]]-based right, as opposed to federal, and recognition of the right can vary from state to state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightofpublicity.com/statutes|title=Statutes|publisher = rightofpublicity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale underlying the right of publicity in the [[United States]] is rooted in both privacy and economic exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Beebe|first1= Barton|last2= Cotter|first2= Thomas |last3= Lemley|first3= Mark|last4= Menell|first4= Peter|last5= Merges|first5= Robert|year= 2011|title= Trademarks, Unfair Competition, and Business Torts|url= |location= |publisher= Aspen Publishers|isbn= 978-0-73558877-6|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rights are based in tort law, and the four causes of action are: 1) Intrusion upon physical solitude; 2) public disclosure of private facts; 3) depiction in a false light; and 4) appropriation of name and likeness.  Typically, but by no means exclusively, the right of publicity is manifest in advertising or merchandise.  In states without a specific right of publicity statute, the right of publicity may still be recognized via common law.  The right of publicity has evolved rapidly, with a history of reported cases in the United States and worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightofpublicity.com|title=Right of publicity informational resource website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the broadest definition, the right of publicity is the right of every individual to control any commercial use of his name, image, likeness, or some other identifying aspect of identity, limited (under U.S. law) by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. The right of publicity can be referred to as '''publicity rights''' or even '''personality rights.''' The term "right of publicity" was coined by Judge [[Jerome Frank (lawyer)|Jerome Frank]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Haelan Laboratories, Inc. v. Topps Chewing Gum, Inc.|vol= 202|reporter= F.2d|opinion= 866|pinpoint= |court= 2d Cir.|date= 1953|url= http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/202/866/216723/|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of recognition of this right in the U.S. is largely driven by [[statute]] or [[case law]]. Because the right of publicity is primarily governed by state (as opposed to federal) law, the degree of recognition of the right of publicity varies significantly from one state to the next.  The [[Lanham Act]] governs federal protection of personality rights, and the doctrine has much in common with the laws defining federal protection of trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|1125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, an individual’s identity could be considered their personal “mark”, the misappropriation of which is sufficient to constitute infringement. In addition, both trademark and publicity rights appear to be designed somewhat to combat infringement for the sake of consumers, granting a cause of action for false descriptions, false representations, and false endorsement claims. Just as there is a cause of action for implying a certain brand sponsors a product when it really does not, there is a cause an action if a celebrity’s identity is used to imply endorsement for a product they are not, in actuality, affiliated with. Courts will typically consider eight factors when weighing a false endorsement claim, in order to determine the likelihood of consumer confusion:

#the strength of his mark.
#the degree of similarity between the two marks.
#the proximity of the products/services.
#the likelihood that the prior owner will bridge the gap.
#actual confusion.
#the defendant's good faith in adopting its own mark.
#the quality of the defendant's product.
#the sophistication of the buyers.

These eight factors have their origins in the case ''[[Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elects.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elect. Corp.|vol= 287|reporter= F.2d|opinion= 492|pinpoint= |court= 2d Cir.|date= 1961|url= http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tmcases/polaroid.htm|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are similarly used by courts to analyze false endorsement claims by celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;As seen in cases such as {{cite court |litigants= Waits v.

[[Indiana]] is believed to have the most far-reaching right of publicity statutes in the world, providing recognition of the right for 100 years after death, and protecting not only the usual "name, image and likeness," but also [[signature]], [[photograph]], [[gesture]]s, distinctive appearances, and mannerisms.  There are other notable characteristics of the Indiana law, though most of the major movement in right of publicity emanates from [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[California]], with a significant body of case law which suggest two potentially contradictory positions with respect to recognition of the right of publicity.

Some states recognize the right through statute and some others through common law. California has both statutory and common-law strains of authority protecting slightly different forms of the right. The right of publicity is a property right, rather than a tort, and so the right may be transferable to the person's heirs after their death. The [[Celebrities Rights Act]] was passed in [[California]] in 1985 and it extended the personality rights for a celebrity to 70 years after their death. Previously, the 1979 ''[[Lugosi v. Universal Pictures]]'' decision by the [[California Supreme Court]] held that [[Bela Lugosi]]'s personality rights could not pass to his heirs.&lt;ref name=findlaw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.findlaw.com/1998/Feb/1/130405.html |title=Lugosi v. Universal Pictures, 603 P.2d 425 (Cal. 1979). |accessdate=2007-02-14 |quote=In this decision preceding (and precipitating) the Legislature's enactment of Section 990, the California Supreme Court held that rights of publicity were not descendible in California. Bela Lugosi's heirs, Hope Linninger Lugosi and Bela George Lugosi, sued to enjoin and recover profits from Universal Pictures for licensing Lugosi's name and image on merchandise reprising Lugosi's title role in the 1930 film, "Dracula." The California Supreme Court faced the question whether Bela Lugosi's film contracts with Universal included a grant of merchandising rights in his portrayal of Count Dracula, and the descendibility of any such rights. Adopting the opinion of Justice Roth for the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, the court held that the right to exploit one's name and likeness is personal to the artist and must be exercised, if at all, by him during his lifetime. Lugosi, 603 P.2d at 431.  |publisher=[[FindLaw]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Who Can Inherit Fame? |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952724,00.html |quote=Ten years later, the son and the widow of [[Bela Lugosi]], star of the Dracula films, tried to take this doctrine a step further. They argued that this right was essentially property and therefore should pass on to heirs. In a California suit, they asked the courts to stop [[Universal Pictures]] from merchandising 70 Dracula products, ranging from jigsaw puzzles to belt buckles, and sought compensation based on the profits. Citing the First Amendment, Universal replied that the design of merchandise is a form of free speech that should not be restrained by anyone's heirs. Besides, said Universal's lawyer, Robert Wilson, Lugosi "attained fame and fortune because the company made and distributed the movies he starred in." After eleven years of wrangling, a trial judge decided in favor of the Lugosis, giving them $70,000 and barring Universal from merchandising Lugosi's likeness. ... In December the California Supreme Court reversed the Lugosi decision. |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= July 7, 1980 |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1977, in the case of ''[[Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co.]]'', the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] did not [[wikt:Immunity|immunize]] a [[television station]] from liability for broadcasting [[Hugo Zacchini]]'s [[human cannonball]] act without his consent.  This was the first, and so far the only, U.S. Supreme Court ruling on rights of publicity. {{citation needed|date=February 2011}}
*In September 2002, [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Nicole Kidman]] sued luxury cosmetics company [[Sephora]] for allegedly using a picture of them without permission in a brochure promoting [[perfume]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2270558.stm|title=Cruise and Kidman sue over ad|publisher=BBC News|date=September 20, 2002|accessdate=June 19, 2012|quote=Cruise and Kidman claim the unauthorised use of their image for the advert had made them ‘involuntary models without pay’. [...] They are seeking damages for violation of the Lanham Act, a US law designed to protect against trademark infringement and unfair competition such as false advertising.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In October 1990, actor [[Crispin Glover]] filed a lawsuit against [[Universal Studios]] for both the unauthorized use of his likeness and the use of footage of him from ''[[Back to the Future]]'' in ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]''; his permission had not been sought for the latter and he received no payment. After a motion to dismiss was overruled, the case was settled for an undisclosed amount. The [[Screen Actors Guild]] changed its rules to prohibit its members from unauthorized mimicking of other SAG members.
*A recent example is [[John Dillinger]]'s rights of publicity, as seen in ''Phillips v. Scalf'', a 2003 [[Indiana Court of Appeals]] case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Phillips v. Scalf|vol= 778|reporter= N.E.2d|opinion= 480|pinpoint= |court= Ind.

Scalf, the grandnephew of the 1930s [[gangster]] and bank robber John Dillinger, in using without authorization Dillinger’s name, image, and likeness in connection with the restaurant. In a later case, a U.S. district court ruled in 2011 that Indiana's publicity rights statute did not protect people who died before the law's enactment in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Dillinger LLC v.

*In March 2003, eight members of the cast of ''[[The Sopranos]]'' alleged that electronics retailer [[Best Buy]] used their images in newspaper ads without permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/04/business/fi-sopranos4|title='Sopranos' Take Shot at Ad in Court|last=Bates|first=James|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 4, 2003|accessdate=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the July 2003 case of ''[[ETW Corp. v. Jireh Publishing]]'', however, a painting of the [[golf]]er [[Tiger Woods]] and others is protected by the [[US Constitution]]'s [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and treads neither on the golfer's [[trademark]]s nor publicity rights. Similarly in the July 2003 case of ''[[Jonah Hex#Lawsuit|Johnny and Edgar Winter v. DC Comics]]'', a depiction of [[blues music]] duo the Winter brothers in a comic book as worms called the Autumn Brothers obtained First Amendment protection from publicity rights suit. In May 2005, ''[[Toney v. Oreal USA Inc.]]'' clarified the distinction between the purview of copyright versus the nature of publicity rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Toney v.

*In 2008, a federal judge in California ruled that [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s rights of publicity were not protectable in California.  The court reasoned that since Monroe was domiciled in New York at the time of her death, and New York does not protect a celebrity's deceased rights of publicity, her rights of publicity ended upon her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=The New Grave Robbers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/28/opinion/28madoff.html?_r=1&amp;hpw=&amp;pagewanted=all |quote=In a case involving Marilyn Monroe, the California Legislature even created a retroactive right of publicity, establishing new private property interests in the identities of the long dead.

*In the 2009 case of ''[[James "Jim" Brown v. Electronic Arts, Inc.]]'', the District Court of the Central District of California dismissed athlete [[Jim Brown]]'s theory of false endorsement under the [[Lanham Act]] and determined that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protects the unauthorized use of a trademark in an artistic work when the mark has artistic relevance to the work and does not explicitly mislead as to the source or content of the work. Applying this test, the court found a lack of implied endorsement and held that the First Amendment protected Electronic Arts in its use of a virtual football player that resembled Mr. Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://206.204.99.39/media/brown.pdf|title=''James "Jim" Brown v.

Associated with the proletarian arts movement in Japan, it primarily used small gauge films such as [[16mm film]] and [[9.5mm film]] to record demonstrations and workers' lives and show them in organized events or, using mobile projection teams, at factories and mines. It also published its own journals. Most of its films were [[documentaries]] or [[newsreels]], but Prokino also made [[fiction films]] and [[animated films]]. Prominent members included [[Akira Iwasaki]] and [[Genjū Sasa]], although in its list of supporters one finds such figures as [[Daisuke Itō (film director)|Daisuke Itō]], [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Shigeharu Nakano]], [[Tomoyoshi Murayama]], [[Kiyohiko Ushihara]], [[Kogo Noda]], [[Takiji Kobayashi]], [[Sōichi Ōya]], [[Fuyuhiko Kitagawa]], [[Tokihiko Okada]], [[Matsuo Kishi]], [[Kiyoshi Miki]], [[Denmei Suzuki]], [[Teppei Kataoka]], and [[Shigeyoshi Suzuki (film director)|Shigeyoshi Suzuki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3214">A '''rigger''' is one who works on ropes, booms, lifts, hoists and the like for a stage production, film, or television show.

The term "rigger" originally referred to a person who attended to the [[rigging]] of a sailing ship.  In the age of sail, trading followed seasonal patterns with ships leaving port at set times of the year to make the most of winds.  When not at sea sailors would seek employment ashore.  Their skill with ropes and booms found use in the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgarena.com/archives/interviews/jeremie/jeremie.html cgarena.com, Interview with Jeremie Passerin - Rigging Supervisor at Blur Studio]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original canvas backdrops used in the theatre moved with ropes and pulleys, being developed from techniques used for [[sail]]s.  It is from these roots that modern [[fly system]]s emerged.  This also gave rise to the tradition in British theatres of never [[Whistling#Superstition|whistling on stage]] as the riggers would use the same whistled instructions on stage as they did aboard ship. A misplaced whistle could be taken as an instruction to the riggers to change the set.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.animationmentor.com/why-a-great-rigger-is-an-animators-best-friend/  animationmentor.com Why a Great Rigger is an Animator’s Best Friend, By: Ozgur Aydogdu] &lt;/ref&gt;

The term rigger is still used for people backstage in [[theatre]]s, the [[road crew]] for a live [[concert]], [[convention (meeting)|convention]]s and [[trade show]]s, and by extension to similar jobs such as those who are responsible for fastening chain motors (like [[CM Lodestar]]) by wire rope to the structural steel of a building.&lt;ref&gt;Uva's Rigging Guide for Studio and Location, By Michael Uva, Sabrina Uva&lt;/ref&gt;

With the birth of the [[film]] industry, just as stage actors adapted their techniques to the new medium so did those back stage. The complexity of the new environment giving rise to specializations such as those in the film industry who rig scaffolding for film sets and camera rigs; also termed as a standby rigger if they are on site and 'on call' all of the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmfilm.com/Crew_Position_Glossary.aspx?dirElementId=bc0af813426943ffa06192f9e3a74e9f nmfilm.com, Glossary of Industry Job Positions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wire riggers==
In the theater and [[film industry]], a '''wire rigger''' is a worker in the [[special effects]]/stunts [[film crew]] who "flies" [[actor]]s.  They are responsible for rigging special harnesses to attached wires which in turn are run through a series of "blocks" ([[pulley]]s) to a control area where a wire rigger raises, lowers or traverses an actor wearing the harness.  Wire riggers also rig up rails along which travels a "skate" from which the wire is attached.  Many plays and feature films (e.g. [[Peter Pan]], [[Harry Potter]], [[Superman]]) use this technique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodstuntcoordinator.com/blog-post/stunt-wire-rigging/ hollywoodstuntcoordinator.com, Wire riggers]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Spirit Folk'''" is the 137th episode of the American [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' airing on the [[UPN]] network. It is the 17th episode of the [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 6)|sixth season]].

==Plot==
The crew continues to enjoy the Fair Haven [[holodeck]] program. After Lt. [[Tom Paris]]'s suggestion, the holoprogram is set to run continuously, but over time, the strain put on the holotechnology begins to cause problems. The hologram characters begin to realize that the visitors are capable of changing the world at will (normally, holograms' programming makes them oblivious to non-in-world aspects). Scared by this, the villagers begin to suspect that the crew is a group of spirit folk that came to destroy Fair Haven. [[Kathryn Janeway|Captain Janeway]] manages to elude her boyfriend, Michael the barkeeper, but nevertheless asks Tom and his friend [[Harry Kim (Star Trek)|Ensign Harry Kim]] to figure out the problems with the Fair Haven program. The two establish that the subroutines to make the holograms unaware of things outside their program have malfunctioned due to prolonged operation. When Tom and Harry enter the program to fix it, however, they are captured and held hostage by the holograms, who begin to try to make Tom and Harry spill secrets about the spirit folks. [[Doctor (Star Trek)|The Doctor]] (who has been playing the role of a village priest) enters the holodeck using his mobile emitter (to avoid being influenced by the damaged holo-program) but is soon deprived of it and tied with Tom and Harry. Michael, determined to find his girlfriend, puts the emitter on. Janeway, thinking that it's the Doctor who's wearing it, orders that he be transported to the bridge. At this point, Janeway can no longer (completely) deceive Michael. She explains to him that her crew are on a spaceship on a long journey, and that they enjoy the occasional visit to peaceful Fair Haven. They afterwards reenter the holodeck and convince the other characters that the crew had no hostile intentions.

This story arc is begun in the previous Season Six episode of ''[[Fair Haven (Star Trek: Voyager)|Fair Haven]]'', the other Voyager episode featuring the town.

'''''Star Trek Memories''''' is the first of two volumes of autobiography dictated by [[William Shatner]] and transcribed by MTV editorial director [[Christopher Kreski]].

In the book, published in 1993, Shatner interviews several cast members of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' with the notable exception of [[James Doohan]]. He was surprised by the reaction of his fellow actors, who spoke negatively of their experiences with him on the show.

==Contents==
The book begins at the start of production on ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'', with the work on the original pilot, "[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]", and described the difficulties that some of the producer's decisions caused the production. Shatner goes on to describe the production of the show, and the aftermath of its cancellation. He interviews other members of the cast who on occasion speak negatively of their experiences on the show, except for [[James Doohan]], who refused to meet with him.&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news|last1=Van Matre|first1=Lynn|title=Shatner's Not-so-joyful Reminiscences Of `Star Trek'|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-11-01/features/9311010146_1_star-trek-memories-shows-castoff-props-first-interracial-smooch|accessdate=October 19, 2014|work=Chicago Tribune|date=November 1, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also spoke to [[Bjo Trimble]], one of the most famous ''Star Trek'' fans.&lt;ref name=trimble&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trimble|first1=Bjo|last2=Trimble|first2=John|title=Guest Blog: Bjo &amp; John Trimble Say "Shatner's The Man"|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/guest-blog-bjo-john-trimble-say-shatners-the-man|publisher=Star Trek.com|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative reaction of some of the cast members to him when he wrote ''Star Trek Memories'' had come as a surprise to Shatner, and it was reported at the time that he was dismayed at the response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Craig|first1=Olga|title=William Shatner: The man who fell to Earth|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3673712/William-Shatner-The-man-who-fell-to-Earth.html|accessdate=October 19, 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=May 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He conducted the interviews by phone in some cases, including the one with Trimble.&lt;ref name=trimble/&gt; One of the stories included in the book, which involved Shatner putting out a fire on the Paramount lot, was directly contradicted by [[George Takei]] in his autobiography ''[[To the Stars: The Autobiography of George Takei]]''. Instead, Takei said that when the fire broke out, Shatner was driven by public relations executives to the site of the fire and posed with a hose for photographs. However, while ''Star Trek Memories'' contains a description of an incident while filming "[[The Naked Time]]" that Shatner described as Takei getting carried away with an [[épée]] and nearly disembowelling him – Takei's book instead makes no mention of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Artman|first1=Catherine|title=Kirk and Sulu, the Trekkies' Hailing Frequencies are Open|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-22655776.html|accessdate=October 22, 2014|work=The Buffalo News|publisher=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=November 16, 1994|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
The review in trade magazine ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', said that "Fans of TV's 1960s science fiction series Star Trek will go into orbit over lead player Shatner's candid, captivating reminiscence, packed with stellar anecdotes and backstage lore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Star Trek Memories|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-017734-8|accessdate=October 19, 2014|work=Publishers Weekly|date=November 1, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Post-Tribune]]'' said that both ''Memories'' books by Shatner "were very well done and filled with interesting stories and insights into Shatner's thoughts" in a review of his later book, ''Get A Life!'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=This Captain's Log An Engaging Read|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-108486E7715E7850.html|accessdate=October 22, 2014|work=Post-Tribune|publisher=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=August 1, 1999|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' described ''Star Trek Memories'' as a "masterpiece".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To bravely go where Shatner has gone|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1524599371.html|accessdate=October 22, 2014|work=Winnipeg Free Press|publisher=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=August 3, 2008|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was developed by [[Beenox]] and published by [[Activision]]. It is loosely based on the [[The Amazing Spider-Man 2|2014 film of the same name]].

It was released on April 29 in North America and May 2 in Europe for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Nintendo 3DS]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Wii U]], and [[Xbox 360]]. The [[Xbox One]] version was released alongside the other platforms digitally while the release of physical copies was delayed by two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/the-amazing-spider-man-2-game-is-coming-out-on-xbox-one-1569354844 | accessdate = 29 April 2014 | date = 29 April 2014 | publisher = Kotaku | title = The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Game Is Coming Out on Xbox One, After All | author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gameloft]] also released a mobile version on April 17 for iOS and Android devices as a paid game.  The game was also [[Video game localization|localized]] in Japan as a [[PlayStation|Sony]]-exclusive title.

== Gameplay ==
Morality is used in a system known as "Hero or Menace", where players will be rewarded for stopping crimes or punished for not consistently doing so or not responding. If the player responds to crimes and successfully stops them, their hero rating will go up, failing to do so will result in Spider Man's rating to decrease.&lt;ref name=ign&gt;{{cite web|title=How Is the Amazing Spider-Man 2 Game|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7OBu8jGtms|publisher=IGN|accessdate=1 April 2014|date=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player is able to upgrade Spider-Man's web shooters. During certain sections of the game, the player can control Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker and walk around doing detective work.

Players have access to Peter Parker's home, and his room allows players to replay previous missions from the main storyline, purchase upgrades and equip the various costumes available.&lt;ref name=ps&gt;{{cite web|title=The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - Developer Walkthrough|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_JJzq5BCqo#t=103|publisher=PlayStation|accessdate=1 April 2014|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audio logs of many characters can be collected from around the city. Players can use the Metro to go back to Peter Parker's home.

Additionally, new enemy types have been introduced.&lt;ref name=ps /&gt; Armored guards can be taken down either with a stealth attack or by the Ionic Web upgrade, which allows players to break down armor, thus leaving the guard vulnerable to damage.

Furthermore, the city has been expanded to incorporate unique districts that allow for more open space to the player. The crimes from the first game have been expanded on, but it also includes new crimes such as arson and hostage situations. Unlike the previous game, there will be constant random side activities. Additionally, the use of the Web-Rush system returns and has been expanded on from the previous game, now allowing for critical strikes, dodges and rolls. There are also new upgrades and abilities introduced into the game, some of which have been expanded on from the previous game.

The player can, as before, use their in-game smartphone to access the map, which provides the player with information of activities taking place in the area at the time.&lt;ref name=ps /&gt; Players can use the map to track current activities, main and side missions. Players will also use the in-game smart phone to manage in-game messages and upgrades for their suit and skills.

Missions have been altered to fit players' play style.&lt;ref name=ps /&gt; Rather than players navigating through a linear level, levels have been redesigned to be more open, allowing players to explore the map and providing them with different ways to approach the mission. Players can now choose between a [[Stealth game|stealth]] approach and a combative, open approach to engage their enemies. Additionally, stealth based attacks have been improved since the previous entry, players are now able to silently take down enemies from a distance. Players are able to silently take down enemies from any surface the player is on, whether it be the ceiling, the wall or the ground. Players are also able to repel from their webs and perform inverted take downs on enemies.

==Plot==
{{plot|date=July 2018}}
After the events of the previous game, Peter Parker, also known as the vigilante [[Spider-Man]], begins searching again after Dennis Carradine, the criminal who murdered [[Uncle Ben]] two years ago. In his search, Spider-Man runs into [[Shocker (comics)|Herman Shultz]], one of Carradine's contractor. Shultz doesn't know anything about Carradine, but instead tells him about the recently started gang war, in which his gang is also involved. Spider-Man starts interrogating him about the recently appeared Russian gang, Schultz's gang's rivals, but Schultz escapes.

The following day, Spider-Man returns to his regular life of crime fighting, in the hope of finding more about Carradine's whereabouts. Eventually, he finds out about a deal in which Carradine might be involved, so he goes to investigate. He chases Carradine, but loses him for a short while. When he finds him again, he discovers that he has been murdered by a serial killer known as the "Carnage Killer". Spider-Man decides to track down Carradine's killer, and bring him to Ravencroft, a prison for the criminally insane.

Peter returns home to talk to [[Aunt May]], only to hear the breaking news: both Shultz's and the Russian gang are attacking [[Oscorp]], in order to steal the advanced technology and weapons kept there, so that they could win the gang war. Spider-Man, feeling guilty for letting Shultz escape, rushes to stop them. After saving the lives of the kidnapped employees, including an electric engineer named [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Max Dillon]], Spider-Man apprehends all the mobsters from both gangs (who were fighting over the technology) and prevents them from stealing anything or destroying the building. However, he runs once again into Shultz, who built himself a pair of shock gloves and now calls himself the Shocker. After defeating Shocker, Spidey interrogates him about the gang war and the Carnage Killer, and finds out that every criminal and mobster in town is afraid of this mysterious killer. Spider-Man then apprehends Shultz as well, but takes some of the technology he used for the gloves to make himself a similar gadget.

Following the attack and the death of [[Norman Osborn]], the head of Oscorp, [[chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Harry Osborn]] (Norman's son and Peter's childhood friend) and billionaire [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] announce that their companies will begin working together to fund the Enhanced Crime Task Force, a privatized police force meant to contain criminals, as well as Spider-Man. When Fisk offers to take Oscorp off of Harry's hands, Harry rebuffs him. Fisk decides to wait until Harry dies from the same genetic disease that killed Norman, and then take over Oscorp.

Meanwhile, Spider-Man is met by a man named [[Kraven the Hunter|Kraven]], who came to [[New York City]] in an attempt to hunt and kill all of Oscorp's failed cross-species experiments (which Spidey fought in the previous game). Kraven offers Peter a chance to act as his protege. Peter accepts and the two work together to find the Carnage Killer.

Spider-Man discovers a Russian hideout, where he finds a map of all the places the killer attacked so far. However, he also finds the Russian's plan to kill Wilson Fisk during the fundraiser that will take place that night. Spider-Man sneaks at the fundraiser as his alter-ego and stops the Russian's plan. There, he also meets up with Harry Osborn (whom he hasn't seen for 10 years), as well as [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Felicia Hardy]], a bank robber whom he fought 2 years ago (in the previous game), and somehow both managed to escape from prison and was present in during Spider-Man's search for Carradine. Spidey then heads for the docks, the Russian's main hideout. There he recovers all the stolen Oscorp tech and rescues a man who is an advertising seller, whom the Russians believe to be the Carnage Killer. After saving him, the advertising seller gives Spider-Man a description of the Carnage Killer.

The next day, using the map and the description, Peter and Kraven track down the killer. When they find him, he reveals himself as [[Carnage (comics)|Cletus Kasady]]. Spider-Man and Kasady fight, and Kasady is defeated. However, Peter refuses to kill Kasady, after Kraven urges him to. Kasady is apprehended by the police and taken to Ravencroft where he meets Harry Osborn's assistant, [[List of Marvel Comics characters: M#Donald Menken|Donald Menken]]. Kasady begins to be experimented on with a symbiotic red liquid code-named Venom, which was originally meant to cure Norman Osborn's disease.

Soon after, with the Carnage Killer in jail and the Russian Mob and Shultz's gang defeated, a mysterious man named the "Kingpin" begins filling in the power vacuum. At the same time, more people start viewing Spidey as a menace, and so, more Task Force troops appear in the city to take care of criminals and him. In an attempt to remake his reputation as a hero, Spider-Man escorts a police van to its destination, and then makes his way to a museum that is being robbed. After taking care of the robbers, Spidey fights with Felicia Hardy, who now calls herself Black Cat. After defeating her, Black Cat reveals that the Kingpin is Wilson Fisk (just as Peter thought) and that he is the one who got her out of Ravencroft. However, he made cross-species experiments on her, thus giving super-powers, just like Spider-Man. Peter offers to help her, but she refuses and runs away.

The following day, Peter makes his way to Harry's apartment in order to receive information on Wilson Fisk. However, Harry tells Peter that he is dying and asks him for Spider-Man's help, believing that his blood can help him with a cure. Peter visits Harry as Spider-Man and tells him that he cannot give him his blood, because he wants to avoid another incident like the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] [[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|incident]] and the blood needs to be researched, a fact that Harry sees as a waste of time. This discussion makes Harry angry with Spider-Man and causes him to look for a cure on his own.

After the discussion, Spider-Man makes his way to Kraven's loft, where he discovered from Harry's confirmations that he was hired by Kingpin to kill him. While there, he is tranquilized by Kraven and then forced to fight him in Central Park. During the fight, Kraven reveals that he trained him only to make Spider-Man a worthy opponent. Spider-Man defeats Kraven and coerces info from him on how to get to Kingpin, before webbing him up on a tree.

Arriving at Fisk Tower, Spider-Man infiltrates one of the trucks and rides it to Kingpin's hideout. Spider-Man proceeds to fight the Task Force soldiers and street thugs defending Kingpin, before entering the hideout and confronting him. Spider-Man defeats Kingpin and begins hacking his computer for incriminating evidence. However, all of a sudden, the power in the whole city is cut down by Max Dillon (the Oscorp electric engineer whom Spidey saved earlier), who, after an accident, gained electric powers and was incarcerated at Ravencroft, but managed to escape. Thus, Spider-Man is forced to leave and go stop Dillon, who is now calling himself Electro. 

Spider-Man reaches Time Square and tries to reason with Electro, who reveals that the doctors at Ravencroft had done experiments on him. Electro blames Spidey for not being there to save him, since they were "partners", and thus attacks him. Spider-Man manages to defeat Electro, whose body explodes, thus killing him. The power returns to New York, but Spidey feels sorry for Dillon, since not only he did meant him to be his true partner, he was also only a victim, and realises that Ravencroft must be doing similar experiments on all of their patients, so its time for him to stop them.

Meanwhile, Harry discovers and injects himself with [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]]'s spider venom (which gave Peter his powers), hoping that it will cure him of his disease. He also finds out from one of his employees that the rumors about Fisk trying to take over Oscorp are true. This makes him even more angry and, because of the unstable venom he has just injected himself with, he becomes insane, thus causing havoc in the Oscorp building. 

Spider-Man comes to investigate and finds the insane and grotesque Harry, who dubs himself the "[[Green Goblin]]". After saving the civilians inside the building and defusing the bombs Green Goblin has planted around Manhattan, Spider-Man is forced to chase and fight his former friend. Peter eventually defeats Green Goblin, who accidentally stabs himself with his own glider and dies.

With the menace of the Green Goblin over, Spider-Man heads over to the Ravencroft Institute, after hearing of large riots breaking out. Spider-Man saves Donald Menken, who reveals that the experiments on Kasady failed, thus allowing him to control the Venom he was injected with and now calls himself Carnage. After taking Menken and the other staff to safety, Spidey defeats all the other patients Kasady has infected with the symbiote, and eventually finds him. Spider-Man defeats Kasady, but he and the symbiote fully bond, becoming Carnage. Spidey manages to defeat Carnage and burns the symbiote off Kasady, thanks to Menken's tips on how to defeat the symbiote. He begs Spider-Man to let him die, but he refuses, saying that they are different, and takes him back to his cell, where the symbiote is completely removed. 

Sometime later, Peter visits [[Stan Lee]] in his comic book shop. There, Stan encourages him to be the man Uncle Ben would have wanted him to be, before Peter resumes his role as Spider-Man and goes to save the day once more.

In a post-credits scene, Kingpin tells the mayor on the phone that he will continue to finance the Enhanced Crime Task Force without Harry, when he is interrupted by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], who was actually posing as Donald Menken all along. When he asks Fisk what their next plan is, he replies that "the real work begins".

''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' received generally mixed reviews upon release, with most of the criticism aimed at the graphics, story, and [[Glitch#Video game glitches|glitches]]. The iOS version of the game has a weighted aggregate rating of 58/100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 11 reviews,&lt;ref name=mc_ios/&gt; and 57.50% on [[GameRankings]], based 8 reviews,&lt;ref name=gr_ios/&gt; the PlayStation 3 version of the game has 59.00% on [[GameRankings]], based on 1 review,&lt;ref name=gr_ps3/&gt; the PlayStation 4 version of the game has 54.02% on [[GameRankings]], based on 5 reviews,&lt;ref name=gr_ps4/&gt; and 50/100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 7 reviews.&lt;ref name=mc_ps4/&gt;

The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions were reviewed as "inferior" to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions, primarily due to the fact that the older console versions suffered from poor lighting,  frame rate drops, and poorly detailed textures. The PS4 version of the game received a 5.4/10 from [[IGN]].&lt;ref name=IGN_review /&gt; The Xbox One version of the game received a 5.5/10 from Digital-Tutors stating the biggest issue was "...it just isn’t polished, and based on the many issues we found with the game it looks thrown together in a rush trying to get it out the door in time for the release of the movie." [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s [[Good Game (television series)|Good Game]] hated the game, both [[Steven O'Donnell (Australian actor)|Bajo]] and [[Stephanie Bendixsen|Hex]] gave it a 4/10 with Hex saying; "This feels like a poor copy-paste job of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', with most of the good bits removed."

[[Eurogamer]]'s Dan Whitehead scored the game a 2 out of 10, saying "It's like a part of me has died". Whitehead was very disappointed in the game because, as he is a big fan of Spider-Man, he felt that the game provided no significant fun for the player, whereas past Spider-Man games at least provided something. Whitehead stated: "Sullied by lacklustre gameplay and trampled by technical shoddiness, this time Spidey hasn't been done in by the [[Sinister Six]], but reduced to a Terrible Two."&lt;ref name="destructoid"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-the-amazing-spider-man-2-273999.phtml|title= The Amazing Spider-man 2 review: Not So Amazing |publisher=Destructoid |date=30 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom McShea from [[GameSpot]] scored the game a 5/10. McShea called the representation of Spider-Man "enjoyable", and liked the "satisfying" [[Boss (video games)|boss]] battles, but criticized the controls, side-missions, and combat. McShea summarized his review by saying: "The biggest failing of ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' is how familiar it feels. In fact, there have been other open-world games starring Spider-Man that walk a remarkably similar path. So there weren't many surprises, nothing that jumped out and made me take notice. Still, being able to spend time with Spider-Man was enough for me to stomach the various problems, just because he's a fun character to listen to. There's nothing majorly wrong with ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'', after all. There's just not a lot right with it, either."&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;

Richard Grisham of [[GamesRadar]] was more positive of the game, giving it a 3 out of 5. He called the combat "shallow" but "enjoyable", praised the collectables, and liked the "entertaining, fun" story. He did feel as though the game was a dated experience, and disliked the controls and mission variety.&lt;ref name="GamesRader review"/&gt;

In his review for [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]], [[Justin McElroy]] scored the game a 6/10 and wrote: "I've accepted that there's probably never going to be a truly great Spider-Man game. If the dispiriting ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' is any indication, Activision and Beenox may have reached the same conclusion. There have been many worse Spider-Man games than this. But I can't recall one that's swung so conceptually close to greatness only to let poor execution drag it back to Earth."&lt;ref name="Polygon review"/&gt;

'''''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly''''' ({{lang-it|Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo}}, {{literal translation|"The good, the ugly, the bad"}}) is a 1966 Italian [[Epic film|epic]] [[Spaghetti Western]] film directed by [[Sergio Leone]] and starring [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Lee Van Cleef]], and [[Eli Wallach]] in their respective title roles.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; 27 December 1967, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[screenplay]] was written by [[Age &amp; Scarpelli]], [[Luciano Vincenzoni]] and Leone (with additional screenplay material and dialogue provided by an uncredited [[Sergio Donati]]),&lt;ref name="The Good 2014"&gt;[[Sir Christopher Frayling]], The Good, the Bad and the Ugly audio commentary (Blu-ray version). Retrieved on 26 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; based on a story by Vincenzoni and Leone. Director of photography [[Tonino Delli Colli]] was responsible for the film's sweeping [[widescreen]] [[cinematography]], and [[Ennio Morricone]] composed the [[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (soundtrack)|film's score]] including [[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (theme)|its main theme]]. It is an [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]]-led production with co-producers in Spain, West Germany and the United States.

The film is known for Leone's use of [[long shots]] and [[close-up]] cinematography, as well as his distinctive use of [[Aestheticization of violence|violence]], [[Suspense|tension]], and stylistic [[Gunfighter|gunfights]]. The plot revolves around three [[gunslinger]]s competing to find fortune in a buried cache of [[Confederate gold]] amid the violent chaos of the [[American Civil War]] (specifically the [[New Mexico Campaign]] in 1862), while participating in many battles and duels along the way.&lt;ref name="Yezbick"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Yezbick |first=Daniel |title=The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly |encyclopedia=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture |publisher=Gale Group |year=2002 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100524 |accessdate=23 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012154144/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100524 |archivedate=12 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the third collaboration between Leone and Clint Eastwood, and the second with Lee Van Cleef.

''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' was marketed as the third and final installment in the ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'', following ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' and ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]''. The film was a financial success, grossing over $25 million at the box office, and is credited with catapulting Eastwood into stardom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McGilligan |first=Patrick |title=Clint: The Life and Legend (updated and revised) |publisher=[[OR Books]] |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-939293-96-1 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to general disapproval of the Spaghetti Western genre at the time, critical reception of the film following its release was mixed, but it gained critical acclaim in later years. ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' is now seen as one of the greatest and most influential [[Western (genre)|Western]] movies.

==Plot==
During the [[American Civil War]], a trio of bounty hunters attempt to kill an unseen fugitive, later revealed to be Tuco. After multiple gunshots and bursting through a window, Tuco escapes on horseback leaving the three bounty hunters presumed dead on the floor.

Elsewhere, [[mercenary]] Angel Eyes interrogates former [[Army of New Mexico|Confederate]] soldier Stevens, whom Angel Eyes is contracted to kill, about Jackson, a fugitive who stole a cache of [[Confederate gold]]. Angel Eyes makes Stevens tell him the new name Jackson is using: Bill Carson. Stevens offers Angel Eyes $1,000 to kill Baker, Angel Eyes's employer. Angel Eyes accepts the contract, and kills Stevens as he leaves. Angel Eyes returns to Baker for his fee, then shoots Baker, fulfilling his contract with Stevens.

Meanwhile, [[Mexican people|Mexican]] bandit Tuco Ramírez is rescued from three [[bounty hunter]]s by "[[Man with No Name|Blondie]]", who delivers him to the local sheriff to collect his $2,000 bounty. As Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie severs Tuco's noose by shooting it, and sets him free. The two escape on horseback and split the bounty in a lucrative money-making scheme. They repeat the process in another town for more reward money. Blondie grows weary of Tuco's complaints, and abandons him without horse or water in the desert. A vengeful Tuco barely survives and tracks Blondie to a town being abandoned by Confederate troops. As he prepares to force Blondie to hang himself, [[Department of New Mexico|Union]] forces shell the town, allowing Blondie to escape.

Following an arduous search, Tuco recaptures Blondie and force-marches him across a [[desert]] until Blondie collapses from dehydration. As Tuco prepares to shoot him, he sees a runaway carriage. Inside are several dead soldiers and a near-death Bill Carson, who promises Tuco $200,000 in Confederate gold, buried in a grave in Sad Hill Cemetery&lt;!-- Please do not change this to Sand Hill. The subtitles and closed captions both are written Sad. See talk page for further discussion --&gt;. Tuco demands to know the name on the grave, but Carson collapses from thirst before answering.  When Tuco returns with water, Carson has died and Blondie, slumped next to him, reveals that Carson recovered and told him the name on the grave before dying.  Tuco, who now has strong motivation to keep Blondie alive, gives him water and takes him to a nearby [[Catholic missionary|frontier mission]], where his brother is the head Abbot, to recover.

After Blondie's recovery, the two leave in Confederate uniforms from Carson's carriage, only to be captured by Union soldiers and remanded to the [[prisoner of war camp]] of Batterville. At roll call, Tuco answers for "Bill Carson", getting the attention of Angel Eyes, now a disguised Union [[sergeant]] at the camp. Angel Eyes tortures Tuco, who reveals the name of the cemetery, but confesses that only Blondie knows the name on the grave. Realizing that Blondie will not yield to torture, Angel Eyes offers him an equal share of the gold and a partnership. Blondie agrees and rides out with Angel Eyes and his gang. Tuco is packed on a train to be executed, but escapes.

[[File:Mexican standoff.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The iconic [[Mexican standoff]], with Tuco seen on the left, Angel Eyes in the middle, and Blondie on the right. The scene is accompanied by [[Ennio Morricone]]'s "The Trio".]]

Blondie, Angel Eyes, and his henchmen arrive in an evacuated town. Tuco, having fled to the same town, takes a bath in a ramshackle hotel and is surprised by Elam, one of the three bounty hunters searching for him. Tuco shoots Elam, causing Blondie to investigate the gunshots. He finds Tuco, and they agree to resume their old partnership. The pair kill Angel Eyes's men, but discover that Angel Eyes himself has escaped.

Tuco and Blondie travel toward Sad Hill, but their way is blocked by Union troops on one side of a strategic bridge, with Confederates on the other. Blondie decides to destroy the bridge to disperse the two armies to allow access to the cemetery. As they wire the bridge with [[Explosive material|explosives]], Tuco suggests they share information, in case one person dies before he can help the other. Tuco reveals the name of the cemetery, while Blondie says "Arch Stanton" is the name on the grave. After the bridge explodes, the armies disperse, and Tuco steals a horse and rides to Sad Hill to claim the gold for himself. He finds Arch Stanton's grave and begins digging. Blondie arrives and encourages him at gunpoint to continue. A moment later, Angel Eyes surprises them both. Blondie opens Stanton's grave, revealing just a skeleton. Blondie states that he lied about the name on the grave, and offers to write the real name of the grave on a rock.  Placing it face-down in the courtyard of the cemetery, he challenges Tuco and Angel Eyes to a [[Truel|three-way duel]].

The trio stare each other down. Everyone draws, and Blondie shoots and kills Angel Eyes, while Tuco discovers that his own gun was unloaded by Blondie the night before. Blondie reveals that the gold is actually in the grave beside Arch Stanton's, marked "Unknown". Tuco is initially elated to find bags of gold, but Blondie holds him at gunpoint and orders him into a [[hangman's noose]] beneath a tree. Blondie binds Tuco's hands and forces him to stand balanced precariously atop an unsteady grave marker while he takes half the gold and rides away. As Tuco screams for mercy, Blondie returns into sight. Blondie severs the rope with a rifle shot, dropping Tuco, alive but tied up, onto his share of the gold. Tuco curses loudly while Blondie rides off into the horizon.

==Cast==

===The trio===
* [[Clint Eastwood]] as "Blondie" (a.k.a. the [[Man with No Name]]): The Good, a subdued, confident [[bounty hunter]] who teams up with Tuco, and Angel Eyes temporarily, to find the buried gold. Blondie and Tuco have an [[ambivalence|ambivalent]] partnership. Tuco knows the name of the cemetery where the gold is hidden, but Blondie knows the name of the grave where it is buried, forcing them to work together to find the treasure. In spite of this greedy quest, Blondie's pity for the dying soldiers in the chaotic carnage of the War is evident. "I've never seen so many men wasted so badly," he remarks. He also comforts a dying soldier by laying his coat over him and letting him smoke his cigar. ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' had ended its run as a series in 1966, and at that point neither ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' nor ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' had been released in the United States. When Leone offered Clint Eastwood a role in his next movie, it was the only big film offer he had; however, Eastwood still needed to be convinced to do it. Leone and his wife traveled to California to persuade him. Two days later, he agreed to make the film upon being paid $250,000&lt;ref name="Hughes12"&gt;Hughes, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; and getting 10% of the profits from the North American markets—a deal with which Leone was not happy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sergio Leone]], C'era una volta il Cinema. [[Radio 24 (Italy)|Radio 24]]. Retrieved on 17 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In the original Italian script for the film, he is named "Joe" (his nickname in ''A Fistful of Dollars''), but is referred to as Blondie in the Italian and English dialogue.&lt;ref name="The Good 2014"/&gt;
* [[Lee Van Cleef]] as Angel Eyes: The Bad, a ruthless, unfeeling, and sociopathic mercenary who always finishes a job he is paid for (which is usually finding—and killing—people). When Blondie and Tuco are captured while posing as Confederate soldiers, Angel Eyes is the Union sergeant who interrogates and has Tuco tortured, eventually learning the name of the cemetery where the gold is buried, but not the name on the tombstone. Angel Eyes forms a fleeting partnership with Blondie, but Tuco and Blondie turn on Angel Eyes when they get their chance. Originally, Leone wanted [[Enrico Maria Salerno]] (who had dubbed Eastwood's voice for the Italian versions of the ''Dollars Trilogy'' films)&lt;ref name=Cox/&gt; or [[Charles Bronson]] to play Angel Eyes, but the latter was already committed to playing in ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967). Leone thought about working with Lee Van Cleef again: "I said to myself that Van Cleef had first played a romantic character in ''For a Few Dollars More''. The idea of getting him to play a character who was the opposite of that began to appeal to me."&lt;ref name="Frayling" /&gt; In the original working script, Angel Eyes was named "Banjo", but is referred to as "Sentenza" (meaning "Sentence" or "Judgement") in the Italian version. Eastwood came up with the name Angel Eyes on the set, for his gaunt appearance and expert marksmanship.&lt;ref name="The Good 2014"/&gt;
* [[Eli Wallach]] as Tuco Benedicto Pacífico Juan María Ramírez (known as "The Rat" according to Blondie): The Ugly, a comical and oafish but cagey and resilient, fast-talking [[Mexican people|Mexican]] [[bandit]] who is wanted by the authorities for a long list of crimes. Tuco manages to discover the name of the cemetery where the gold is buried, but he does not know the name of the grave. This state of affairs forces Tuco to become reluctant partners with Blondie. The director originally considered [[Gian Maria Volontè]] for the role of Tuco, but felt that the role required someone with "natural comic talent". In the end, Leone chose Eli Wallach, based on his role in ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962), in particular, his performance in "The Railroads" scene.&lt;ref name="Frayling" /&gt; In Los Angeles, Leone met Wallach, who was skeptical about playing this type of character again, but after Leone screened the opening credit sequence from ''For a Few Dollars More'', Wallach said: "When do you want me?"&lt;ref name="Frayling" /&gt; The two men got along famously, sharing the same bizarre sense of humor. Leone allowed Wallach to make changes to his character in terms of his outfit and recurring gestures. Both Eastwood and Van Cleef realized that the character of Tuco was close to Leone's heart, and the director and Wallach became good friends. They communicated in French, which Wallach spoke badly and Leone spoke well. Van Cleef observed, "Tuco is the only one of the trio the audience gets to know all about. We meet his brother and find out where he came from and why he became a bandit. But Clint's and Lee's characters remain mysteries."&lt;ref name="Frayling" /&gt; In the theatrical trailer, Angel Eyes is referred to as The Ugly and Tuco, The Bad.&lt;ref name="Hughes15"&gt;Hughes, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to a translation error; the original Italian title translates to "The Good [one], the Ugly [one], the Bad [one]".

==Development==

===Pre-production===
After the success of ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'', executives at [[United Artists]] approached the film's screenwriter, Luciano Vincenzoni, to sign a contract for the rights to the film and for the next one. He, producer Alberto Grimaldi and Sergio Leone had no plans, but with their blessing, Vincenzoni pitched an idea about "a film about three rogues who are looking for some treasure at the time of the American Civil War".&lt;ref name="Frayling"&gt;Frayling, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The studio agreed, but wanted to know the cost for this next film. At the same time, Grimaldi was trying to broker his own deal, but Vincenzoni's idea was more lucrative. The two men struck an agreement with UA for a million-dollar budget, with the studio advancing $500,000 up front and 50% of the box office takings outside of Italy. The total budget would eventually be $1.2 million.&lt;ref name="The Good 2014"/&gt;

Leone built upon the screenwriter's original concept to "show the absurdity of war&amp;nbsp;... the Civil War which the characters encounter. In my frame of reference, it is useless, stupid: it does not involve a 'good cause.'"&lt;ref name="Frayling" /&gt; An avid history buff, Leone said, "I had read somewhere that 120,000 people died in Southern camps such as [[Andersonville prison|Andersonville]]. I was not ignorant of the fact that there were camps in the North. You always get to hear about the shameful behavior of the losers, never the winners."&lt;ref name="Frayling" /&gt; The Batterville Camp where Blondie and Tuco are imprisoned was based on steel engravings of Andersonville. Many shots in the film were influenced by archival photographs taken by [[Mathew Brady]]. As the film took place during the Civil War, it served as a prequel for the other two films in the trilogy, which took place after the war.&lt;ref name="Munn59"&gt;Munn, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

While Leone developed Vincenzoni's idea into a script, the screenwriter recommended the comedy-writing team of Agenore Incrucci and Furio Scarpelli to work on it with Leone and Sergio Donati. According to Leone, "I couldn't use a single thing they'd written. It was the grossest deception of my life."&lt;ref name="Frayling" /&gt; Donati agreed, saying, "There was next to nothing of them in the final script. They only wrote the first part. Just one line."&lt;ref name="Frayling" /&gt; Vincenzoni claims that he wrote the screenplay in 11 days, but he soon left the project after his relationship with Leone soured. The three main characters all contain autobiographical elements of Leone. In an interview he said, "[''Sentenza''] has no spirit, he's a professional in the most banal sense of the term. Like a robot. This isn't the case with the other two. On the methodical and careful side of my character, I'd be nearer ''il Biondo'' (''Blondie''): but my most profound sympathy always goes towards the ''Tuco'' side&amp;nbsp;... He can be touching with all that tenderness and all that wounded humanity."&lt;ref name="Frayling" /&gt; [[Film director]] [[Alex Cox]] suggests that the cemetery-buried gold hunted by the protagonists may have been inspired by rumours surrounding the [[anti-Communist]] [[Operation Gladio|Gladio]] terrorists, who hid many of their 138 weapons caches in cemeteries.&lt;ref name=Cox&gt;Cox, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood received a percentage-based salary, unlike the first two films where he received a straight fee salary. When Lee Van Cleef was again cast for another ''Dollars'' film, he joked "the only reason they brought me back was because they forgot to kill me off in ''For A Few Dollars More''".&lt;ref name="Munn59"/&gt;

The film's working title was ''I due magnifici straccioni'' (''The Two Magnificent Tramps''). It was changed just before shooting began when Vincenzoni thought up ''Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo'' (''The Good, the Ugly, the Bad''), which Leone loved. In the United States, United Artists considered using the original Italian translation, ''River of Dollars'', or ''The Man With No Name'', but decided on ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly''.&lt;ref name="Hughes15"/&gt;

===Production===

Filming began at the [[Cinecittà]] studio in Rome again in mid-May 1966, including the opening scene between Eastwood and Wallach when Blondie captures Tuco for the first time and sends him to jail.&lt;ref name="McGillagan153"/&gt; The production then moved on to Spain's plateau region near [[Burgos]] in the north, which doubled for the southwestern United States, and again shot the western scenes in [[province of Almería|Almería]] in the south of Spain.&lt;ref name="McGillagan154"&gt;Patrick McGillagan (1999). Clint: the life and legend. St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|978-0312290320}} p.154&lt;/ref&gt; This time, the production required more elaborate sets, including a town under cannon fire, an extensive prison camp and an American Civil War battlefield; and for the climax, several hundred Spanish soldiers were employed to build a cemetery with several thousand gravestones to resemble an ancient [[Circus (building)|Roman circus]].&lt;ref name="McGillagan154"/&gt; For the scene where the bridge was blown up, it had to be filmed twice, as in the first take all three cameras were destroyed by the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;Munn, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood remembers, "They would care if you were doing a story about Spaniards and about Spain. Then they'd scrutinize you very tough, but the fact that you're doing a western that's supposed to be laid in southwest America or Mexico, they couldn't care less what your story or subject is."&lt;ref name="Frayling" /&gt; Top Italian cinematographer [[Tonino Delli Colli]] was brought in to shoot the film and was prompted by Leone to pay more attention to light than in the previous two films; Ennio Morricone composed the score once again. Leone was instrumental in asking Morricone to compose a track for the final [[Mexican stand-off]] scene in the cemetery, asking him to compose what felt like "the corpses were laughing from inside their tombs", and asked Delli Colli to create a hypnotic whirling effect interspersed with dramatic extreme close ups, to give the audience the impression of a visual ballet.&lt;ref name="McGillagan154"/&gt; Filming concluded in July 1966.&lt;ref name="Hughes12"/&gt;

Eastwood was not initially pleased with the script and was concerned he might be upstaged by Wallach. "In the first film I was alone," he told Leone. "In the second, we were two. Here we are three. If it goes on this way, in the next one I will be starring with the American cavalry."&lt;ref name="McGillagan152"&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.152&lt;/ref&gt; As Eastwood played hard-to-get in accepting the role (inflating his earnings up to $250,000, another [[Ferrari]]&lt;ref name="Eliot250Ferar"&gt;Eliot (2009), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; and 10% of the profits in the United States when eventually released there), Eastwood was again encountering publicist disputes between Ruth Marsh, who urged him to accept the third film of the trilogy, and the [[William Morris Agency]] and [[Irving Leonard (financial adviser)|Irving Leonard]], who were unhappy with Marsh's influence on the actor.&lt;ref name="McGillagan152"/&gt; Eastwood banished Marsh from having any further influence in his career, and he was forced to sack her as his business manager via a letter sent by Frank Wells.&lt;ref name="McGillagan152"/&gt; For some time after, Eastwood's publicity was handled by Jerry Pam of Gutman and Pam.&lt;ref name="McGillagan153"&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.153&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout filming, Eastwood regularly socialized with actor [[Franco Nero]], who was filming ''[[Texas, Adios]]'' at the time.&lt;ref name="Nero"&gt;{{Cite AV media

Wallach and Eastwood flew to [[Madrid]] together, and between shooting scenes Eastwood would relax and practice his golf swing.&lt;ref name="McGillagan155"&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.155&lt;/ref&gt; Wallach was almost poisoned during filming when he accidentally drank from a bottle of acid that a film technician had set next to his soda bottle. Wallach mentioned this in his autobiography&lt;ref&gt;[[Eli Wallach|Wallach, Eli]] (2005). ''The Good, the Bad and Me: In My Anecdotage'', p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; and complained that while Leone was a brilliant director, he was very lax about ensuring the safety of his actors during dangerous scenes.&lt;ref name="Frayling" /&gt; For instance, in one scene, where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse underneath him was supposed to bolt. While the rope around Wallach's neck was severed, the horse was frightened a little too well. It galloped for about a mile with Wallach still mounted and his hands bound behind his back.&lt;ref name="Frayling" /&gt; The third time Wallach's life was threatened was during the scene where he and Mario Brega—who are chained together—jump out of a moving train. The jumping part went as planned, but Wallach's life was endangered when his character attempts to sever the chain binding him to the (now dead) henchman. Tuco places the body on the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to roll over the chain and sever it. Wallach, and presumably the entire film crew, were not aware of the heavy iron steps that jutted one foot out of every box car. If Wallach had stood up from his prone position at the wrong time, one of the jutting steps could have decapitated him.&lt;ref name="Frayling" /&gt;

The bridge in the film was reconstructed twice by [[sapper]]s of the Spanish army after being rigged for on-camera explosive demolition. The first time, an Italian camera operator signaled that he was ready to shoot, which was misconstrued by an army captain as the similar-sounding Spanish word meaning "start". Nobody was injured in the erroneous mistiming. The army rebuilt the bridge while other shots were filmed. As the bridge was not a prop, but a rather heavy and sturdy structure, powerful explosives were required to destroy it.&lt;ref name="Frayling" /&gt; Leone said that this scene was, in part, inspired by [[Buster Keaton]]'s silent film ''[[The General (1926 film)|The General]]''.&lt;ref name="The Good 2014"/&gt;

As an international cast was employed, actors performed in their native languages. Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach spoke English, and were dubbed into Italian for the debut release in Rome. For the American version, the lead acting voices were used, but supporting cast members were dubbed into English.&lt;ref&gt;Cumbow (2008) p.121&lt;/ref&gt; The result is noticeable in the bad synchronization of voices to lip movements on screen; none of the dialogue is completely in sync because Leone rarely shot his scenes with [[synchronized sound]].&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/05/29/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-blu-ray-review|title=The Good, The Bad and the Ugly Blu-ray Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Shaffer, R.L.}} 28 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Various reasons have been cited for this: Leone often liked to play [[Ennio Morricone|Morricone]]'s music over a scene and possibly shout things at the actors to get them in the mood. Leone cared more for visuals than dialogue (his English was limited, at best). Given the technical limitations of the time, it would have been difficult to record the sound cleanly in most of the extremely wide shots Leone frequently used. Also, it was standard practice in Italian films at this time to shoot silently and post-dub. Whatever the actual reason, all dialogue in the film was recorded in post-production.&lt;ref&gt;Cumbow (2008) p.122&lt;/ref&gt;

Leone was unable to find an actual cemetery for the Sad Hill shootout scene, so the Spanish pyrotechnics chief hired 250 Spanish soldiers to build one in Carazo near [[Salas de los Infantes]], which they completed in two days (at {{nowrap|{{coord|41|59|25|N|3|24|29|W|scale:50000|display=inline}}}}).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Mail]]'' (6 May 2005). "On the Graveyard Shift".&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of filming, Eastwood had finally had enough of Leone's perfectionist directorial traits. Leone, often forcefully, insisted on shooting scenes from many different angles, paying attention to the most minute of details, which would often exhaust the actors.&lt;ref name="McGillagan155"/&gt; Leone, an obese glutton, was also a source of amusement for his excesses, and Eastwood found a way to deal with the stresses of being directed by him by making jokes about him and nicknamed him "[[Yosemite Sam]]" for his bad temperament.&lt;ref name="McGillagan155"/&gt; After the film was completed, Eastwood never worked with Leone again, later turning down the role as Harmonica in ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), for which Leone had personally flown to Los Angeles to give him the script. The role eventually went to [[Charles Bronson]].&lt;ref name="McGillagan158"&gt;McGillagan (1999), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Leone exacted his revenge upon Eastwood during the filming of ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'' (1984) when he described Eastwood's abilities as an actor as being like a block of marble or wax and inferior to the acting abilities of [[Robert De Niro]], saying, "Eastwood moves like a sleepwalker between explosions and hails of bullets, and he is always the same—a block of marble. Bobby first of all is an actor, Clint first of all is a star. Bobby suffers, Clint yawns."&lt;ref name="McGillagan159"&gt;McGillagan (1999), p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood later gave a friend the poncho he wore in the three films, where it was hung in a Mexican restaurant in [[Carmel, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Munn, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and cinematography==
Director Sergio Leone noted that the film's main theme is its [[Aestheticization of violence|emphasis on violence]] and the deconstruction of [[Old West]] [[romanticism]]. Like many of his films, ''The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly'' was considered by Leone as a [[satire]] of the Western genre.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; Critic Drew Marton described it as a "[[baroque]] manipulation" that criticizes the American ideology of the Western,&lt;ref name="Drew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pajiba.com/pajiba_blockbusters/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-review-happiness-is-a-warm-gun.php|title=''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' review|publisher=''Pajiba''|author=Marton, Drew}} 22 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; by replacing the heroic [[cowboy]] popularized by [[John Wayne]] with morally complex [[Anti-hero|antiheroes]]. Negative themes such as [[capitalism]] and greed were also given focus, and were traits shared by the three leads in the story. Many critics have also noticed the film's [[list of anti-war films|anti-war]] theme.&lt;ref name="Culture" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colesmithey.com/capsules/2013/02/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly.html|title=''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly''- Classic Film Pick|publisher=''Colesmithey - Capsules''|author=Smithey, Coley}} 10 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Taking place in the American Civil War, the film takes the viewpoint of people such as civilians, bandits, and most notably soldiers, and presents their daily hardships during the war. Although not fighting in the war, the three gunslingers gradually become entangled in the battles that ensue (similar to ''[[The Great War (1959 film)|The Great War]]'', a film that screenwriters Luciano Vincenzoni and Age &amp; Scarpelli had contributed to).&lt;ref name="The Good 2014"/&gt;

In its depiction of violence, Leone used his signature [[Long shot|long drawn]] and [[close-up]] style of filming, which he did by mixing extreme face shots and sweeping long shots. By doing so, Leone managed to stage epic sequences punctuated by extreme eyes and face shots, or hands slowly reaching on a holstered gun.&lt;ref name="Culture"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whatculture.com/film/50-reasons-why-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-might-just-be-the-greatest-film-of-all-time | title=50 Reasons Why The Good, The Bad and The Ugly Might Just Be The Greatest Film of all Time | publisher=''What Culture'' | author=Leigh, Stephen | date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This builds up the tension and suspense by allowing the viewers to savor the performances and character reactions, create a feel of excitement, as well as giving Leone the freedom to film beautiful [[landscape]]s.&lt;ref name="Culture" /&gt; Leone also incorporated music to heighten up the tension and pressure before and during the film's many gunfights.&lt;ref name="The Good 2014"/&gt;

In filming the pivotal gunfights, Leone largely removes dialogue to focus more on the actions of the characters, which was important during the film's iconic [[Mexican standoff]]. This style can also be seen in one of the film's protagonists, Blondie (aka [[The Man with No Name]]), which is described by critics as more defined by his actions than his words.&lt;ref name="Drew" /&gt; All three characters can be seen as anti-heroes killing for their personal gain. Leone also employed stylistic [[trick shooting]], such as Blondie shooting the hat off a person's head and severing a [[hangman's noose]] with a well-placed shot, in many of its iconic shootouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondo70.blogspot.com/2014/08/on-big-screen-good-bad-and-ugly-il.html|title=On the Big Screen: THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (Il buono, il bruto, il cattivo, 1966)|publisher=''Mondo 70: A Wild World of Cinema''|author=Wilson, Samuel}} 2 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' was released 18 January 1967 (28 months after its initial Italian release);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=fistfulofdollars.htm|title=''A Fistful of Dollars'' |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|author=}} 6 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' was released 10 May 1967 (17 months);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=forafewdollarsmore.htm|title=''For A Few Dollars More'' |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|author=}} 6 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' was released 29 December 1967 (12 months).&lt;ref name="GBUMojo" /&gt; Thus, all three of Leone's Dollars Trilogy films were released in the United States during the same year.

===Critical reception===
Upon release, ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' received criticism for its depiction of violence.&lt;ref name="Fritz"&gt;{{cite news | last =Fritz| first =Ben| title =The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly| publisher =''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''| date =14 June 2004| url =| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leone explains that "the killings in my films are exaggerated because I wanted to make a [[tongue-in-cheek]] satire on run-of-the-mill westerns... The west was made by violent, uncomplicated men, and it is this strength and simplicity that I try to recapture in my pictures."&lt;ref name="newsmakers"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title =Sergio Leone| encyclopedia =Newsmakers| volume =| pages =| publisher =Gale| year =2004| id =| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, Leone's effort to reinvigorate the timeworn Western is widely acknowledged.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news| last = Schickel| first = Richard| authorlink = Richard Schickel| title = The Good, The Bad and The Ugly| work =All-Time 100 Movies| publisher = [[Time Magazine]]| url = http://www.time.com/time/2005/100movies/0,23220,the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly,00.html| accessdate = 16 May 2007| date=12 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical opinion of the film on initial release was mixed, as many reviewers at that time looked down on "[[spaghetti western]]s". In a negative review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', critic [[Renata Adler]] said that the film "must be the most expensive, pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre."&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times,'' film review, 25 January 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that the "temptation is hereby proved irresistible to call ''The Good, The Bad and the Ugly'', now playing citywide, ''The Bad, The Dull, and the Interminable'', only because it is."&lt;ref name="Eliot8687"&gt;Eliot (2009), p. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]], who later included the film in his list of Great Movies,&lt;ref name="greatmovies"&gt;{{cite book| last = Ebert| first = Roger| authorlink = Roger Ebert| title = The Great Movies II| publisher = Broadway| year = 2006| pages = | isbn = 0-7679-1986-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; retrospectively noted that in his original review he had "described a four-star movie, but only gave it three stars, perhaps because it was a 'Spaghetti Western' and so could not be art." Ebert also points out Leone's unique perspective that enables the audience to be closer to the character as viewers see what he sees.&lt;ref name="RogerEbert_2003"&gt;{{cite news| last =Ebert| first =Roger| authorlink =Roger Ebert| title =The Good, the Bad and the Ugly| work =Great Movies| publisher =rogerebert.com| date =3 August 2003| url =http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20030803%2FREVIEWS08%2F308030301%2F1023| accessdate =15 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Sergio Leone established a rule that he follows throughout ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly''. The rule is that the ability to see is limited by the sides of the frame. At important moments in the film, what the camera cannot see, the characters cannot see, and that gives Leone the freedom to surprise us with entrances that cannot be explained by the practical geography of his shots. There is a moment, for example, when men do not notice a vast encampment of the Union Army until they stumble upon it; a moment in a cemetery when a man materializes out of thin air, even though he should have been visible much sooner; the way men walk down a street in full view and nobody is able to shoot them (maybe because they are not in the same frame with them).&lt;ref name="RogerEbert_2003" /&gt;}}

Despite the initial negative reception by some critics, today, the film has since accumulated very positive feedback.

===Home media===
The film was first released on [[VHS]] by [[VidAmerica]] in 1980, then [[Magnetic Video]] in 1981, [[CBS/Fox Video]] in 1983 and [[MGM Home Entertainment]] in 1990.

The film was first released on [[DVD]] by [[MGM Home Entertainment]] in 1998. The special features contain 14 minutes of scenes that were cut for the film's North American release, including a scene which explains how Angel Eyes came to be waiting for Blondie and Tuco at the Union prison camp.&lt;ref name="Original DVD"/&gt;

In 2002, the film was restored with the 14 minutes of scenes cut for US release re-inserted into the film. Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach were brought back in to dub their characters' lines more than 35 years after the film's original release. Voice actor [[Simon Prescott]] substituted for Lee Van Cleef who had died in 1989. Other voice actors filled in for actors who had since died. In 2004, MGM released this version in a two-disc special edition DVD.&lt;ref name="MGM"&gt;{{Cite AV media | title=The Good, the Bad &amp; the Ugly (2-Disc Collector's Edition) | medium=DVD | publisher=Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer | location=Los Angeles | date=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disc 1 contains an [[audio commentary]] with [[film writer|writer]] and [[film critic|critic]] [[Richard Schickel]]. Disc 2 contains two [[Documentary film|documentaries]], "Leone's West" and "The Man Who Lost The Civil War", followed by the featurette "Restoring 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly'"; an animated gallery of missing sequences titled "The Socorro Sequence: A Reconstruction"; an extended Tuco torture scene; a featurette called "Il Maestro"; an audio featurette named "Il Maestro, Part 2"; a French trailer; and a poster gallery.&lt;ref name="MGM"/&gt;

This DVD was generally well received, though some purists complained about the re-mixed stereo soundtrack with many completely new sound effects (notably, the gunshots were replaced), with no option for the original soundtrack.&lt;ref name="4K Blu-ray"/&gt; At least one scene that was re-inserted had been cut by Leone prior to the film's release in Italy, but had been shown once at the Italian premiere. According to Richard Schickel,&lt;ref name="MGM"/&gt; Leone willingly cut the scene for pacing reasons; thus, restoring it was contrary to the director's wishes.&lt;ref name="Cumbow 2008 p.103"&gt;Cumbow (2008) p.103&lt;/ref&gt; MGM re-released the 2004 DVD edition in their "Sergio Leone Anthology" box set in 2007. Also included were the two other "Dollars" films, and ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]''. On 12 May 2009, the extended version of the film was released on [[Blu-ray]].&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; It contains the same special features as the 2004 special edition DVD, except that it includes an added commentary by film historian [[Sir Christopher Frayling]].&lt;ref name="The Good 2014"/&gt;

The film was re-released on Blu-ray in 2014 using a new [[4k resolution|4K remaster]], featuring improved picture quality and detail but a change of [[color timing]], resulting in the film having a more yellow hue than on previous releases.&lt;ref name="4K Blu-ray"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Man-with-No-Name-Trilogy-Blu-ray/95396/#Review|title= The Man with No Name Trilogy Blu-ray|publisher= Blu-ray.com}} Retrieved 16 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It was rereleased on Blu-ray and DVD by [[Kino International (company)|Kino Lorber Studio Classics]] on August 15, 2017, in a new 50th Anniversary release that featured both theatrical and extended cuts, as well as new bonus features, and an attempt to correct the yellow color timing from the earlier disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Good-the-Bad-and-the-Ugly-Blu-ray/175359/#|title=The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Blu-ray|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deleted scenes====
The following scenes were originally deleted by distributors from the British and American theatrical versions of the film, but were restored after the release of the 2004 Special Edition DVD.&lt;ref name="MGM"/&gt;
* During his search for Bill Carson, Angel Eyes stumbles upon an embattled Confederate outpost after a massive artillery bombardment. Once there, after witnessing the wretched conditions of the survivors, he bribes a Confederate soldier ([[Víctor Israel]], dubbed by [[Tom Wyner]]&lt;ref name="Tom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/1567/good-bad-ugly/|title= Good, the Bad and the Ugly, The (live action)|publisher= CrystalAcids.com}} Retrieved 17 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;) for clues about Bill Carson.
* The sequence with Tuco and Blondie crossing the desert has been extended: Tuco mentally tortures a severely dehydrated Blondie by eating and bathing in front of him.
* Tuco, transporting a dehydrated Blondie, finds a Confederate camp whose occupants tell him that Father Ramirez's monastery is nearby.
* Tuco and Blondie discuss their plans when departing in a wagon from Father Ramirez's monastery.
* A scene where Blondie and Angel Eyes are resting by a creek when a man appears and Blondie shoots him. Angel Eyes asks the rest of his men to come out (all are hidden as well). When the five men come out, Blondie counts them (including Angel Eyes), and concludes that [[Perfect Number|six is the perfect number]]. Angel Eyes asks him why, mentioning that he had heard that three was the perfect number. Blondie responds that six is the perfect number, because he has six bullets left in his revolver.
* The sequence with Tuco, Blondie and Captain Clinton has been extended: Clinton asks for their names, which they are reluctant to answer.

A scene deleted by Leone after the Rome premiere was also re-inserted:
* After being betrayed by Blondie, surviving the desert on his way to civilization and assembling a good revolver from the parts of worn-out guns being sold at a general store, Tuco meets with members of his gang in a distant cave, where he conspires with them to hunt and kill Blondie.

Additional footage of the sequence where Tuco is tortured by Angel Eyes's henchman was discovered. The original negative of this footage was deemed too badly damaged to be used in the theatrical cut, but the footage appears as an extra in the 2004 DVD supplementary features.&lt;ref name="Cumbow 2008 p.103"/&gt;

Lost footage of the missing Socorro Sequence where Tuco continues his search for Blondie in a Texican pueblo while Blondie is in a hotel room with a Mexican woman (Silvana Bacci) is reconstructed with photos and unfinished snippets from the French trailer. Also, in the documentary "Reconstructing The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", what looks to be footage of Tuco lighting cannons before the Ecstasy of Gold sequence appears briefly. None of these scenes or sequences appear in the 2004 re-release, however, but are in the supplementary features.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

The score is composed by frequent Leone collaborator [[Ennio Morricone]], whose distinctive original compositions, containing gunfire, [[whistling]] (by [[John O'Neill (musician)|John O'Neill]]), and [[yodeling]] permeate the film. The main theme, resembling the howling of a [[coyote]] (which blends in with an actual coyote howl in the first shot after the opening credits), is a two-pitch melody that is a frequent [[Motif (music)|motif]], and is used for the three main characters. A different instrument was used for each: [[flute]] for Blondie, [[ocarina]] for Angel Eyes, and human voices for Tuco.&lt;ref name="SoundtrackNet"&gt;{{cite web | last = Torikian | first = Messrob | title = The Good, the Bad and the Ugly | publisher = [[SoundtrackNet]] | url = http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=3475 | accessdate = 26 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Music from"&gt;{{cite web | last = Mansell | first = John | title = The Good, the Bad and the Ugly | publisher = Music from the Movies | url = http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/review.asp?ID=1643 | accessdate = 26 May 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070217123204/http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/review.asp?ID=1643 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 17 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;{{cite web | last = McDonald | first = Steven | title = The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&amp;nbsp;: Overview | publisher = AllMusic | url = {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r84071|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate = 26 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news | last = Edwards | first = Mark | title = The good, the brave and the brilliant | publisher = The Times | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article1580081.ece | accessdate = 26 May 2007 | location=London | date=1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score complements the film's American Civil War setting, containing the mournful ballad, "[[The Story of a Soldier]]", which is sung by [[Prisoner of war|prisoners]] as Tuco is being tortured by Angel Eyes.&lt;ref name="Yezbick"/&gt; The film's climax, a three-way [[Mexican standoff]], begins with the melody of "[[The Ecstasy of Gold]]" and is followed by "The Trio". Today, the iconic theme is considered one of the greatest instrumental film scores of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watchmojo.com/video/id/11982/|title=Top 10 Iconic Instrumental Film Scores|publisher=''[[WatchMojo.com]]''|author=}} 19 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The main theme also titled "[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (song)|The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]" was a hit in 1968 with the soundtrack album on the charts for more than a year,&lt;ref name = "Times"/&gt; reaching No. 4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' pop album chart and No. 10 on the black album chart.&lt;ref name="All Music 1"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Good, the Bad and the Ugly charts and awards | publisher = AllMusic | url = {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r84071/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate = 26 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main theme was also a hit for [[Hugo Montenegro]], whose rendition was a No. 2 ''Billboard'' pop single in 1968.&lt;ref name="All Music 2"&gt;{{cite web | title = Hugo Montenegro &gt; Charts &amp; Awards | publisher = AllMusic | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p23980/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate = 26 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular culture, the American [[New wave music|new wave]] group [[Wall of Voodoo]] performed a medley of Ennio Morricone's movie themes, including the theme for this movie. The only known recording of it is a live performance on ''[[The Index Masters]]''. Punk rock band the [[Ramones]] played this song as the opening for their live album ''[[Loco Live]]'' as well as in concerts until their disbandment in 1996. The British heavy metal band [[Motörhead]] played the main theme as the overture music on the 1981 "No sleep 'til Hammersmith" tour. American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Metallica]] has run "The Ecstasy of Gold" as prelude music at their concerts since 1985 (except 1996–1998), and in 2007 recorded a version of the instrumental for a compilation tribute to Morricone.&lt;ref name="Metallica.com March 11"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.metallica.com/index.asp?item=600114 | title=We All Love Ennio Morricone | publisher=Metallica.com | accessdate=11 March 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202024236/http://www.metallica.com/index.asp?item=600114 | archivedate=2 February 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[XM Satellite Radio]]'s ''[[The Opie &amp; Anthony Show]]'' also opens every show with "The Ecstasy of Gold". The American punk rock band [[The Vandals]] song "Urban Struggle" begins with the main theme. British [[electronica]] act [[Bomb the Bass]] used the main theme as one of a number of [[Sampling (music)|samples]] on their 1988 single "[[Beat Dis]]", and used sections of dialogue from Tuco's hanging on "Throughout The Entire World", the opening track from their 1991 album ''[[Unknown Territory]]''.  The main theme was also sampled/re-created by British band [[New Order (band)|New Order]] for the album version of their 1993 single "[[Ruined in a Day]]". A song from the band [[Gorillaz]] is named "[[Clint Eastwood (song)|Clint Eastwood]]", and features references to the actor, along with a repeated sample of the theme song; the iconic yell featured in ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'''s score is heard at the beginning of the music video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1134500,00.html|title=The return of the Gorillaz|work=EW.com|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The film's title has entered the English language as an idiomatic expression. Typically used when describing something thoroughly, the respective phrases refer to upsides, downsides and the parts that could, or should have been done better, but were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knls.org/English/trascripts/idiom004.htm#THE%20GOOD,|title=KNLS Tutorial Idioms|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924015813/http://www.knls.org/English/trascripts/idiom004.htm#THE%20GOOD,|archivedate=24 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was novelized in 1967 by Joe Millard as part of the "Dollars Western" series based on the "Man with No Name". The South Korean western movie ''[[The Good, the Bad, the Weird]]'' (2008) is inspired by the film, with much of its plot and character elements borrowed from Leone's film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hancinema.net/korean_movie_The_Good_v__the_Bad_v__the_Weird.php|title=''The Good, the Bad, the Weird''|author=Kim Jee-woon (김지운)|work=HanCinema|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction to the 2003 revised edition of his novel ''[[The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger]]'', [[Stephen King]] revealed that the film was a primary influence for the Dark Tower series, and that Eastwood's character specifically inspired the creation of King's protagonist, [[Roland Deschain]].&lt;ref name="GSRE"&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen|title=The Gunslinger: Revised and Expanded Edition|publisher=Signet Fiction|location=Toronto|year=2003|pages=xxii|isbn=0-451-21084-0|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' is the last film in the Dollars Trilogy, and thus does not have an official sequel. Following the film's release, Leone went on to direct two more Westerns (''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' and ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'') and was involved in the production of other Spaghetti Westerns (''[[My Name Is Nobody]]'' and ''[[A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe]]''), but none of these bore direct relations with his previous films.

However, screenwriter [[Luciano Vincenzoni]] stated on numerous occasions that he had written a treatment for a sequel, tentatively titled ''Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo n. 2'' ''(The Good, the Bad and the Ugly 2)''. According to Vincenzoni and Eli Wallach, the film would have been set 20 years after the original, and would have followed Tuco pursuing Blondie's grandson for the gold. Clint Eastwood expressed interest in taking part in the film's production, including acting as narrator. [[Joe Dante]] and Leone were also approached to direct and produce the film respectively. Eventually, however, the project was vetoed by Leone, as he did not want the original film's title or characters to be reused, nor did he want to be involved in another Western film.&lt;ref name=sed&gt;Giusti, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Unimportance of Being Oscar''''' is a 1968 memoir by writer/pianist/actor [[Oscar Levant]]. The book is known for Oscar's laconic witticisms, such as "everyone in Hollywood is gay, except [[Gabby Hayes]] — and that's because he is a [[transvestite]]."

'''''Two on a Guillotine''''' is a 1965 American [[horror film]] produced and directed by [[William Conrad]] and starring [[Connie Stevens]]. The [[screenplay]] by John Kneubuhl and [[Henry Slesar]] is based on a story by Slesar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbshop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-WB-Site/default/Product-Show?pid=1000161725&amp;affiliate=commissionjunction&amp;src=CJP&amp;AID=10280984 Two on a Guillotine DVD – Warner Bros.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TWO ON A GUILLOTINE
Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 33, Iss. 384,  (Jan 1, 1966): 112. &lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first in a series of low budget suspense dramas for Warner Bros, the others being ''[[My Blood Runs Cold]]'' and ''[[Brainstorm (1965 film)|Brainstorm]]''.(There was meant to be a fourth,  ''The Thing at the Door'', but it ended up not being made).&lt;ref&gt;Warner Bros.

==Plot==
A prologue introduces the audience to John Harley Duquesne, a [[Psychosis|psychotic]] [[illusionist|magician]] who accidentally beheads his wife Melinda with a [[guillotine]] during a performance. Twenty years later he dies, and his [[Will (law)|will]] requires his daughter Cassie (the mirror image of her mother) to spend seven nights in his apparently haunted [[mansion]] in order to [[inheritance|inherit]] his estate.

Reporter Val Henderson offers to stay with her when he learns Duquesne promised to return in [[Ghost|spirit]] form during Cassie's week-long [[vigil]]. As the days pass, the two encounter a number of spooky happenings, leading to a climax in which the not-really-dead Duquesne attempts a recreation of his guillotine trick, this time with his daughter as an unwilling assistant who hopefully won't lose her head.

In a climactic fight, Henderson tries to prevent Duquesne from activating the guillotine, but himself accidentally releases the catch; a ''dummy'''s head falls from the guillotine causing Duquesne to go insane thinking his daughter has been killed. Henderson rescues Cassie as the police come to arrest Duquesne.

Stevens was under contract with Warner Bros. She said "I thought the script was stupid when I read it but I came away thinking, 'yeah, it could have happened.' That's the challenge, to make something like this believable."&lt;ref&gt;Connie Stevens Makes a Big Hit: Teen-Agers Go Wild When They See Her
Maher, Mary. Chicago Tribune 15 Feb 1965: b1. &lt;/ref&gt;

Stevens made the film right before her series ''Wendy and Me''. She said the film "could have been a class A thriller if they'd spent more money on it." However she noted it got Conrad a seven year contract with the studio.&lt;ref&gt;An Eager Connie Stevens Casts an Eye on the Big Star Category

'''University Cinema Scala''' is a [[Movie theater|cinema]] in [[Brno]] in the Czech Republic. It is located at [[Moravské náměstí]] (Moravian Square) in the basement of building 127/3, [[Quarter (urban subdivision)|city quarter]] [[Brno-střed]] and [[neighbourhood]] [[Brno-město]]. It has been in operation since 1929 and was at times also called '''Bio Dopz''' and '''Kino Moskva '''(Moscow Cinema). Since the autumn of 2013, it has been run by [[Masaryk University]] and the [[Aeropolis]] company as the first university cinema in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="idnes130916"&gt;SVOBODOVÁ, Karolína. &lt;/ref&gt; Besides regular film screenings, it also serves as a representative space and a lecture and conference hall used for academic purposes.

== History ==

=== Bio Dopz (1929–1935) ===
The first mobile cinematographs  appear edin Brno in 1896 and the first permanent cinema opened in 1907. However, the current University Cinema Scala only opened about 20 years later, when there were already a number of other cinemas in the city: Centrál (the first cinema, that opened in 1907), Edison (1908), Varieté (later turned into the [[Divadlo Radost]] theatre), Oránia (1911), Lidový biograf (1911), and other ones.&lt;ref name="gala17-21"&gt;GÁLA, Antonín.&lt;/ref&gt; Scala opened in a new building called the DOPZ Palace, which was built at [[Moravské náměstí|Moravské náměstí (then called Lažanského náměstí)]] probably between 1927 and 1928.&lt;ref name="historie"&gt;ALTMAN, Karel; ŠMEJDOVÁ, Petra.&lt;/ref&gt;

DOPZ was an acronym of the cooperative society "Družstvo obchodních a průmyslových zaměstnanců" (full name "Stavební a obchodní družstvo zaměstnanců obchodu a průmyslu, zapsaná společnost s ručením omezeným") that had owned the whole building since September 1927.&lt;ref name="edmb"&gt;MJ, Fl. ''Kino Scala'' [online].&lt;/ref&gt; Though the cinema was originally called '''Bio Dopz''', it was not run by the cooperative, but by a foundation designed to support university students in Moravia and Silesia named after [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk|T. G. Masaryk]] ("Masarykův fond na podporu studentstva vysokých škol na Moravě a ve Slezsku").&lt;ref name="muni131018"&gt;FOJTŮ, Martina.&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation asked for a licence to operate a cinematograph as early as on 11 July 1922, and on 28 December 1923 it was granted a licence to operate the Bristol cinema in Křenová street valid until the end of 1926. However, the foundation found it difficult to acquire the premises needed to run a cinema and so it kept looking at other places – such as the cinema Universum in Lidická (then called Nová) street or a hall in the new Nový domov building in Gorkého (Folkensteinerova) street – until the licence expired. The foundation was promised a new licence in April 1927 and in June 1928, it was offered by DOPZ to run a cinema in its building (DOPZ Palace) located between two squares – Moravské náměstí and Jakubské náměstí (Jacobian Square). Accordingly, it asked for a new licence on 24 September 1928. After some disputes with the local authorities, the foundation was granted a preliminary licence on 27 December 1929 and a full licence on 6 March 1930. While it was trying to obtain a licence, the premises of the cinema were acquired by the company Kraus a spol. On 20 December 1929, the foundation entered into an agreement with the company valid until the end of 1935. According to the agreement, the company set up and run the cinema using the licence acquired by the foundation; in return, it paid 8% of its gross revenue to the foundation. In its turn, the foundation was paying 40% of its net gains to three different associations.&lt;ref name="novak"&gt;NOVÁK, Václav.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cinema opened on 28 December 1929 with a screening of the American sound film romance ''[[White Shadows in the South Seas]]''&lt;ref name="novak-392"&gt;Novák, s. 392.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vlckova-hist"&gt;VLČKOVÁ, Lenka.&lt;/ref&gt; which received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for best cinematography.&lt;ref&gt; ''Bílé stíny'' [online].    Česko-Slovenská filmová databáze, [cit. 2015-11-05].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''White Shadows in the South Seas'' [online].&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the cinema was managed by Rudolf Valenta, and since 1930 by Rudolf Urban.&lt;ref name="novak-392"&gt;Novák, s. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; The entrance fee ranged between 3 and 7 [[Czechoslovak koruna|Czechoslovak crowns]].&lt;ref name="novak-391"&gt;Novák, s. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; While the overall earnings are unknown, the foundation received a yearly share of 189,077, 160,642, and 121,782 crowns in 1930, 1931, and 1932 respectively.&lt;ref name="novak-394"&gt;Novák, s. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kino Scala (1935–1948) ===
For commercial reasons, the name of the cinema was changed to '''Scala '''on 3 December 1935.&lt;ref name="novak-396"&gt;Novák, s. 396.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="muni131018"/&gt; At that time, the licence was nearing its expiration date. The foundation asked for the licence to be extended in February 1936; the application was refused on 31 March 1936 and the local authorities requested that the cinema should be closed by the end of 1936. In October 1937, the Scala licence was granted to a police headquarters association "Jubilejní ozdravovna policejního ředitelství v Brně". This association received 5.5% of net revenue from the Kraus company, which amounted to 85,075 and 82,832 crowns in 1937 and 1938 respectively, and it was required to transfer 2% to other associations.&lt;ref name="novak-397"&gt;Novák, s. 397–398.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, the operation of the cinema was impacted by the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|German occupation]]. Among other things, the contribution to the Masaryk foundation was cancelled and substituted by a contribution to Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt (NSV). On 4 December 1941, the DOPZ buildings were purchased by the insurance company and on 14 July 1942, the cinema premises were rented by Fritz Lord and Josef Veselý, who began to operate the cinema. They asked for a cinema licence as early as on 2 June 1941 and received it on 7 April 1944. With the arrival of the battlefront on 15 April 1945, the cinema was forced to suspend its operation. The cinema building burned out, as well as the neighbouring buildings, but the basement premises of the cinema were left untouched. After the most necessary repairs of the entrance, the cinema opened for provisional screenings on 9 May 1945 and normal operation resumed on 2 June, after foyer refurbishments, with the screening of a film by [[Martin Frič]] ''[[The Second Shift (Czech film)|The Second Shift]]''.&lt;ref name="novak-399"&gt;Novák, s. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''Druhá směna'' [online].    Česko-Slovenská filmová databáze, [cit. 2015-11-13].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kino Moskva (1948–1991) ===
[[File:Building_in_Brno_with_reliefs.JPG|thumb|The facade of the building that used to belong the Hutní projekt company (during the reconstruction of the square in 2010)]]
A nationalization decree from 11 September 1945 nationalized the film industry, production, and distribution including all cinemas. The state-owned enterprise [[Československý státní film]]&lt;ref name="gala3-4"&gt;Gála, kapitola Současnost brněnských kin, s. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; became the authority that supervised the whole industry. On 25 September 1946, Lažanského náměstí (Lažanský Square) was renamed náměstí Rudé armády (Red Army Square)&lt;ref&gt; ''Moravské náměstí'' [online].&lt;/ref&gt; and the cinema later followed suit: on 15 October 1948, it was renamed '''Moskva '''(Moscow). In the early 1950s, the fire-damaged building as well as the adjacent houses were reconstructed&lt;ref name="novak-400"&gt;Novák, s. 400–401.&lt;/ref&gt; and the former DOPZ Palace was replaced by an ostentatious building of Hutní projekt built in the style of [[socialist realism]] by a Brno architect [[Lubor Lacina]].&lt;ref name="historie"/&gt;

A government decree from 16 January 1957 assigned the management of cinemas to "[[National committee (Czechoslovakia 1945–1990)|national committees]]" (local authority councils). Brno established "Správa městských kin", an organisation tasked with managing the city cinemas and led by Antonín Kalášek as its first director, which took over all 29 cinemas in Brno including Moskva from the previous organisation, Krajský filmový podnik.&lt;ref name="gala3-4"/&gt; As the cinema was also being reconstructed in 1957, it was closed between 16 June and 21 November that year. It opened on 21 November with a screening of a French-Italian film ''[[The Best Part (film)|The Best Part]]'' (''&lt;span class="cizojazycne" lang="fr" title="francouzština"&gt;La Meilleure part&lt;/span&gt;''&lt;ref&gt; ''Sibiřanka'' [online].    Česko-Slovenská filmová databáze, [cit. 2015-11-17].&lt;/ref&gt;) starring [[Gérard Philipe]].&lt;ref name="novak-400"&gt;Novák, s. 400–401.&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|21 September 1968]], the cinema was renamed back to Scala for a short period of time, but after 26 September 1969 it was called Moskva again.&lt;ref name="novak-400"&gt;Novák, s. 400–401.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vlckova-hist"/&gt; The cinema was closed for repairs between 1971 and 1973, when it was adapted for 70mm films and stereophonic sound. The cinema opened again on 22 November 1973 with a ceremony that included the screening of the movie ''[[The Siberian Woman (film)|The Siberian Woman]]'' (''&lt;span class="cizojazycne" lang="ru" title="ruština"&gt;Сибирячка&lt;/span&gt;''&lt;ref&gt; ''Sibiřanka'' [online].&lt;/ref&gt;) by director [[Aleksei Saltykov]] to invited guests; regular screenings for the public began on the following day.&lt;ref name="novak-400"&gt;Novák, s. 400–401.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, the Moskva cinema was one of the best in the city, together with other cinemas in the city centre such as the Družba, Praha, Jalta, and Úderka cinemas.&lt;ref name="gala8-12"&gt;Gála, kapitola Specializace brněnských kin, s. 8–12.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it boasted the best equipment in Brno after the above-mentioned reconstruction.&lt;ref name="gala12-15"&gt;Gála, kapitola Zlepšování vybavenosti kin, s. 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kino Scala (1991–2011) ===
[[File:Kino_Scala_-_logo_nad_prostorem_s_pokladnami.jpg|thumb|Former logo above the entrance staircase (before the interruption of operation in 2011)]]
In 1991 – after the [[Velvet Revolution]] – the cinema returned to its original name Scala.&lt;ref name="edmb"/&gt; "Kulturní a informační centrum města Brna" (Brno Cultural and Information Centre) was established the same year and merged with the "Správa městských kin" organisation in November 1994; since 1 January 1995, Scala was officially managed by this new centre.&lt;ref&gt;DUFKOVÁ, Kamila.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1999, the first [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] opened in the Olympia shopping mall in Brno: the second in the Czech Republic (Galaxie in Prague was the first) and the first one that met European standards.&lt;ref&gt;PASEKOVÁ, Lucie.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Scala was the 7th most visited cinema in the Czech Republic with 99,000 visitors, but Olympia already ranked higher and took the 6th place with 120,000 visitors.&lt;ref name="idnes000816"&gt;SPÁČILOVÁ, Mirka; cfa.&lt;/ref&gt; The second multiplex in Brno, [[Cinema City Velký Špalíček|Velký Špalíček]], opened in 2001 and single-screen cinemas started closing one by one during the next five years. Scala thus remained one of the last single-screen cinemas in Brno, together with Art and Lucerna.&lt;ref&gt;Paseková, s. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="den080109"&gt; Tradiční kina v kraji bojují s multiplexy.&lt;/ref&gt; The operator of the city cinemas filed a complaint to the [[Office for the Protection of Competition]] against the preferential treatment that multiplexes received from distributors, but was not successful.&lt;ref&gt;Paseková, s. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''Informační list č. 4/2006'' [PDF online].    Úřad pro ochranu hospodářské soutěže, [cit. 2015-11-17].&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, the cinemas were already operated by "Brněnské kulturní centrum" (Brno Cultural Centre), a new organisation established as of 1 January 2005, when the Brno Cultural and Information Centre was split into two independent centres (the other one was "Turistické informační centrum" – Tourist Information Office). However, both centres were reunited in 2008 as Brno Cultural Centre and further organisational changes followed even after that.&lt;ref&gt;Dufková, s. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bk120325"&gt;BERNÁTEK, Martin.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of visitors to the large-scale auditorium in Scala dropped below 16,000 for the first 10 months of 2009; this was 24 times and 30 times less than the rate for the two Brno multiplexes, respectively, and even less than the rate for the smaller Art cinema.&lt;ref name="den091122"&gt;ŠEDÁ, Aneta.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="den100422"&gt;STULÍROVÁ, Markéta; SUCHÁ, Lenka; ZABADALOVÁ, Veronika.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides a less attractive dramaturgy&lt;ref name="den091122"/&gt; and the policies of film distributors, the head manager of the city cinemas Daniel Zásměta claimed the cinema needed a large-scale reconstruction, which was made impossible by an action to ascertain the ownership of the building that had been filed by the city of Brno and was of many years' standing.&lt;ref name="den090324"&gt;STULÍROVÁ, Markéta.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Moravské náměstí was being reconstructed in 2009–2010,&lt;ref name="den100915"&gt;REICH, Michal.&lt;/ref&gt; which made the neighbourhood temporarily less attractive for visitors. The average number of visitors to Scala in 2010 was 37 and the total number per year was 27,713.&lt;ref name="den111202"&gt;SPĚŠNÝ, Jan.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2011, the [[Brno City Council|Brno city council]] approved a change in the deed of foundation of the cinema operator, the Brno Cultural Centre. It changed its name to "Turistické informační centrum" (Tourist Information Centre) and accordingly, the main focus of its activities shifted from culture towards tourism and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Dufková, s. 74–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bk120325"/&gt;&lt;ref name="den110607"&gt;TAUŠOVÁ, Zuzana.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Art cinema was modernised and digitalised, the city decided to close Scala down.&lt;ref&gt;Dufková, s. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October, the Brno city council agreed to end the cinema operation by 31 December 2011.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;ŽÁRA, Pavel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="den111202"/&gt; The last screening for the public, showing a Canadian co-production film ''[[Mr. Nobody (film)|Mr. Nobody]]'',&lt;ref&gt; ''Pan Nikdo'' [online].    Česko-Slovenská filmová databáze, [cit. 2015-11-17].&lt;/ref&gt; took place on 21 December 2011, and the last screening for schoolchildren took place the next morning.&lt;ref name="den111221"&gt;STUCHLÍKOVÁ, Markéta; ŽÍDKOVÁ, Klára.&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic staff of the Department of Film Studies and Audiovisual Culture, [[Faculty of Arts, Masaryk University|Faculty of Arts at Masaryk University]] protested against the decision to close the cinema and started a petition to keep the cinema in operation.&lt;ref name="idnes111128"&gt;KOLÍNKOVÁ, Eliška; HORÁK, Michal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idnes111202"&gt;KOLÍNKOVÁ, Eliška; TAUŠOVÁ, Zuzana.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="den111129"&gt;ČTVRTEČKOVÁ, Helena.&lt;/ref&gt; Before releasing a tender, the city of Brno offered to lease the cinema to the Masaryk University for the symbolic yearly rent of one [[Czech koruna|Czech crown]]&lt;ref name="den111202"/&gt; and the university expressed an interest in this offer.&lt;ref name="den111207"&gt;HORÁKOVÁ, Veronika.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, the university confirmed that it was interested in renting the cinema and announced that it had a partner for the cinema operation.&lt;ref&gt;POLČÁKOVÁ, Petra.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idnes120330"&gt;HORÁK, Michal.&lt;/ref&gt; After further negotiations,&lt;ref name="den120826"&gt;JEŘÁBEK, Petr; FAJKUSOVÁ, Anna.&lt;/ref&gt; the Brno city council approved the main points of the contract draft on 27 March 2013 and on 17 April it approved a 30-year lease of the cinema for 1.8&amp;nbsp;million crowns (€66,600 as of April 2016) a year.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;POVOLNÝ, David.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="den130329"&gt;FOLTÁNKOVÁ, Kateřina.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic refurbishing of the cinema before its reopening was finished by the end of September 2013. The cost of the refurbishing and subsequent digitalisation of the projection equipment was 12&amp;nbsp;million crowns. The repairs were paid for by the city of Brno, which then received the money back from the university in the form of rent. The university partnered with [[Aeropolis]], a cinema operator that had already had some experience with running independent cinemas in Prague and Hradec Králové and was charged with ensuring year-round film screenings. Moreover, the university began to use the cinema for academic purposes as a lecture and conference hall and space for [[graduation]] and [[matriculation]] ceremonies. The cinema opened for the public on 14 October 2013 with a ceremony that included the screening of a unique interactive film project ''[[Kinoautomat|Kinoautomat: Člověk a jeho dům]]''.&lt;ref name="idnes130916"/&gt;&lt;ref name="den130916"&gt;SIGMUNDOVÁ, Blanka.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idnes131008"&gt;LACINOVÁ, Simona.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''Kinoautomat: Člověk a jeho dům'' [online].    Česko-Slovenská filmová databáze, [cit. 2015-11-17].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilities and equipment ==
The cinema was originally established as a part of the multi-purpose DOPZ Palace building. In the late 1920s, the building consisted of offices, a large conference, dance, and theatre hall on the ground floor, the Biber cafe on the first and second floors and the cinema itself in the basement.&lt;ref name="historie"/&gt;

The basement location was originally a problem, as the lowest point in the auditorium was more than {{convert|7|m|ft}} below the pavement level by the main entrance at Moravské náměstí (then called Lažanského náměstí), while the then-applicable ministerial decree only allowed a depth of {{convert|6|m|ft}}. For this reason, the local authorities refused to approve the licence application on 31 October 1928. The re-submitted application therefore cited the entrance from Jakubské náměstí, which lies below Moravské náměstí, as the main entrance, and the relative depth of the auditorium was thus reduced to {{convert|5.77|m|ft}}. The number of seats was also determined during the [[Certificate of occupancy|occupancy permit]] procedure: 562 seats in the stalls and 238 on the balconies, altogether 800 seats, which was the maximum capacity allowed by the ministerial decree for underground cinemas.&lt;ref name="novak-390"&gt;Novák, s. 390–391.&lt;/ref&gt; During the remodelling of the cinema in 1931, the operator received a permission to change the seating arrangements in the auditorium: by removing the boxes on the sides, the cinema was able to offer 304 seats on the balconies and 702 stalls seats (altogether 1,006 seats). There were further changes in May of the same year that brought the seating capacity of the cinema up to 700 + 312 or 1,012 seats.&lt;ref name="novak-395"&gt;Novák, s. 395.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gala20"&gt;Gála, s. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Measured by seating capacity, Bio Dopz was the largest cinema in Brno. In 1932, the waiting room was turned into a smoking lounge; afterwards, the foyer served as the waiting space.&lt;ref name="novak-395"&gt;Novák, s. 395.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kino_Scala_-_promitarna.jpg|thumb|The cinema projection box with two Meo 5-XB projectors in 2011]]
In 1957, the cinema was rebuilt for widescreen projection using the [[CinemaScope]] system. At the same time, the balcony on the sides of the auditorium was demolished and new seats were installed and rearranged to provide 550 seats in the stalls and 200 on the balcony. The original spiral staircase was also removed as well as the projection box, which was moved to another part of the basement with an entrance right next to the auditorium entrance. The cash desk in the upper foyer was divided into two.&lt;ref name="novak-400"&gt;Novák, s. 400–401.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cinema obtained equipment allowing panoramic 70mm film projection during the next round of remodelling and repairs, which took place in 1971–1973 based on a project prepared by architect Jaroslav Šmídek. The projection box received two [[UM 70/35]] projectors and one [[ME 9]] projector and a 6-channel amplifier system was installed to ensure stereo sound. The smoking lounge was turned into a bar; the cash desks were moved opposite the entrance staircase and an office took their place. Again, new seats were installed in the auditorium: the new arrangement saw the seating capacity decrease to 328 stalls seats and 145 balcony seats (altogether 473 seats).&lt;ref name="novak-400"&gt;Novák, s. 400–401.&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to these changes, the Moskva cinema, as it was called at the time, became the best-equipped cinema in Brno.&lt;ref name="gala13"&gt;Gála, s. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest refurbishing took place in 2013, when the cinema obtained digital equipment for projection in 4K and in the [[Dolby Digital|Dolby Digital Plus 7.1]] sound format.&lt;ref name="historie"/&gt;

'''Sylvester Louis "Vess" Ossman''' (August 21, 1868 &amp;ndash; December 7, 1923) was a leading five-string [[banjo]]ist and popular recording artist of the early 20th century.

==Biography==
Sylvester Louis Ossman was born in [[Hudson, New York|Hudson]], New York, and made his first recordings in 1893.&lt;ref name="Yanow"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yanow|first1=Scott|title=The Great Jazz Guitarists |date = 2013 | publisher = Backbeat | location =San Francisco|isbn=978-1-61713-023-6|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the most recorded musicians of his day, recording [[March, music|marches]], [[cakewalk]]s, and [[ragtime|rags]]. He also accompanied popular singers, such as [[Arthur Collins (singer)|Arthur Collins]] and [[Len Spencer]].

Ossman married Eunice Smith and they had three children, Vess Jr., Raymond, and Annadele.&lt;ref name=gh266&gt;Gracyk, Hoffmann 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;266.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900 and 1903, when Ossman's reputation and fame had spread internationally, he toured England and recorded. With Audley Dudley and [[Roy Butin]] he performed in the Ossman-Dudley Trio.&lt;ref name=Ragtime&gt;{{cite book |title=Ragtime: An Encyclopedia, Discography, and Sheetography|last=Jasen|first=David A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WNuwiKJPtnwC&amp;lpg=PT186&amp;ots=MIpJJijDTu&amp;dq=Roy%20Butin%2C%20harp&amp;pg=PT186#v=onepage&amp;q=Roy%20Butin,%20harp&amp;f=false |authorlink= |year=2007|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=|isbn=9780415978620 |pages=165-166 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He led his own dance band, the Ossman's Singing and Playing Orchestra, in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], Ohio, and [[Indianapolis]], Indiana. The increasing popularity of  his rival [[Fred Van Eps]], after 1910, made Ossman's name appear less frequently in record company supplements. He temporarily ceased recording in 1913 but resumed in late 1915. In April 1917, he became a member of the Popular Talking Machine Artists, a group of unrelated musicians who toured as an act. By the early 1920s, he had left the touring act.&lt;ref name=gh265&gt;Gracyk, Hoffmann 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;265.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 14, 1917 he made his final recordings for [[Columbia Records]]. He continued to travel with his dance orchestra, working in hotels throughout Midwest while living in Dayton with his family. In 1923, he joined B. F. Keith's Vaudeville houses on tour  with his son, Vess Jr. At a theater show in Minneapolis, Ossman suffered a heart attack. He was brought to the hospital but soon returned to the show. Later, in [[Fairmont, Minnesota|Fairmont]], Minnesota, he suffered another heart attack, this time fatal, after his last performance on stage. He was buried in Valhalla Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.&lt;ref name=gh266/&gt;

Ossman played in what is now known as the classic banjo style. He [[fingerpicking|fingerpicked]] gut strings using a technique similar to [[classical guitar]]ists.

His recordings include "St. Louis Tickle", "Yankee Doodle", "Rusty Rags", "Maple Leaf Rag", "The Stars and Stripes Forever", "A Bit of Blarney", "My Irish Molly O", "A Gay Gosson", "Yankee Girl", "Bill Simmons", "Karama".  His recordings also include ragtime-era [[coon songs]], such as "A Coon Band Contest", "The Darkies' Awakening", and [[Ernest Hogan]]'s "[[All Coons Look Alike to Me]]", which were popular at the time.

'''''WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? A Black Woman’s Life and Liberation in Heavy Metal''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book written by the [[Canadian]] [[journalist]] Laina Dawes. First published in 2013, the book explores how black women musicians and fans navigate the metal, hardcore, and punk music genres that are regularly thought of as inclusive spaces and centered on a community spirit, but fail to block out the race and gender issues that exist in the outside world. It features a foreword by [[Skin (singer)|Skin]] of [[Skunk Anansie]].
