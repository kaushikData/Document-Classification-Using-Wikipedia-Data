'''''Americanah''''' is a 2013 novel by the [[Nigeria]]n author [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]], for which Adichie won the 2013 [[National Book Critics Circle Award|National Book Critics Circle Fiction]] award. ''Americanah'' tells the story of a young Nigerian woman, Ifemelu, who immigrates to the [[United States]] to attend university. The novel traces Ifemelu's life in both countries, threaded by her love story with high school classmate Obinze. A television miniseries, starring and produced by [[Lupita Nyong'o]], is in development.

==Plot==
As teenagers in a [[Lagos]] secondary school, Ifemelu and Obinze fall in love. [[Nigeria]] at the time is under [[Nigerian military juntas of 1966–79 and 1983–98|military dictatorship]], and people are seeking to leave the country. Ifemelu departs for the [[United States]] to study. Through her experiences in relationships and studies, she struggles with the experience of [[racism]] in American culture, and the many varieties of racial distinctions. Upon coming to America, Ifemelu discovered for the first time what it means to be a "Black Person".&lt;ref&gt;Stefanie Anna Reuter: [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2808396 "Becoming a Subject: Developing a Critical Consciousness and Coming to Voice in Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's ''Americanah''"], in: Anja Oed (Hg.): ''Reviewing the Past, Negotiating the Future: The African Bildungsroman'' (forthcoming).&lt;/ref&gt; Obinze, son of a professor, had hoped to join her in the US but he is denied a visa after [[9/11]]. He goes to [[London]], eventually becoming an undocumented immigrant after his visa expires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|title=Race-in-America Is a Central Character in 'Americanah'|first=Subashini|last=Navaratnam|date=9 August 2013|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/173884-americanah-by-chimamanda-ngozi-adichie/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peed"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Realities of Race ‘Americanah,' by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie|first=Mike|last=Peed|date=June 7, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/books/review/americanah-by-chimamanda-ngozi-adichie.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, Obinze returns to Nigeria and becomes a wealthy man as a property developer in the newly democratic country. Ifemelu gains success in the United States, where she becomes known for her blog about race in America, entitled "Raceteenth or Various Observations About American Blacks (Those Formerly Known as Negroes) by a Non-American Black".&lt;ref name="peed"/&gt; When Ifemelu returns to Nigeria, the two consider the viability of reviving a relationship in light of their diverging experiences during their many years apart.

==Publication==
''Americanah'' was Adichie's third novel, published on May 14, 2013 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]].

==Reception==

===Reviews===
Critics praised the novel, especially noting its range across different societies and reflection of global tensions. Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Mike Peed said, "'Americanah' examines blackness in America, Nigeria and Britain, but it's also a steady-handed dissection of the universal human experience—a platitude made fresh by the accuracy of Adichie's observations."&lt;ref name="peed"/&gt; Peed concluded, "'Americanah' is witheringly trenchant and hugely empathetic, both worldly and geographically precise, a novel that holds the discomfiting realities of our times fearlessly before us. It never feels false."&lt;ref name="peed"/&gt;  Reviewing the novel for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Emily Raboteau]] called Adichie "a hawkeyed observer of manners and distinctions in class," and said Adichie brings a "ruthless honesty about the ugly and beautiful sides of both" the United States and Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Raboteau|first1=Emily|title=Book review: ‘Americanah' by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/book-review-americanah-by-chimamanda-ngozi-adichie/2013/06/10/a9e5a522-d1de-11e2-9f1a-1a7cdee20287_story.html|accessdate=14 August 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Laura Pearson wrote, "Sprawling, ambitious and gorgeously written, 'Americanah' covers [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[Identity (social science)|identity]], relationships, community, politics, [[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]], language, hair, [[ethnocentrism]], [[Human migration|migration]], intimacy, estrangement, [[blogging]], books and [[Barack Obama]]. It covers three continents, spans decades, leaps gracefully, from chapter to chapter, to different cities and other lives...[Adichie] weaves them assuredly into a thoughtfully structured [[Epic novel|epic]]. The result is a timeless love story steeped in our times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pearson|first1=Laura|title=Review: 'Americanah' by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/books/ct-prj-0630-americanah-chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-20130628-story.html|accessdate=14 August 2016|work=The Chicago Tribune|date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Botanical garden of Thutmose III''' ({{lang-fr|Jardin botanique de Thoutmôsis III}}) is an artistic representation of [[fauna]] and especially [[flora]] during the [[Egyptian empire]] at its peak. The remarkably detailed reliefs are located on the walls of the room next to the [[Festival Hall of Thutmose III]], in the [[Precinct of Amun-Re]], [[Karnak]].&lt;ref name="Ratié1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ratié|first=Suzanne|title=La reine Hatchepsout: sources et problèmes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LWxZpn63tdMC&amp;pg=PA151|accessdate=25 November 2011|year=1979|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-06064-7|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; On land at the rear of the shrine, the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] built the Festival Hall of Thutmose III, also known as the ''Akh-menu''. The walls were then used by royal artists who, by order of the [[pharaoh]], engraved in stone some of the most beautiful pastoral representations of Egypt.

Thutmose III, the great warrior pharaoh who expanded the boundaries of Egypt in the north and the south, collected a considerable collection of rare species of animals and lush plants. His animals and botanical collection are found engraved on the walls of the sanctuary. Through the royal artists, the pharaoh boasts of the scenic beauty, the lush flora and rich fauna he discovered during his victorious campaigns against Asiatics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13854">The '''California Resale Royalty Act''' ([http://law.onecle.com/california/civil/986.html Civil  Code section 986]) entitles [[artist]]s to a [[royalty payment]] upon the [[resale]] of their works of art under certain circumstances.

== Conditions for resale royalty payments ==
* The artist at the time of the sale is a United States citizen or has been a California resident for at least two years.
* The seller resides in California or the sale takes place in California.
* The work is an original painting, drawing, sculpture or original work of art in glass.
* The work is sold by the seller for more money than she or he paid.
* The work is sold for a gross price of more than $1,000 or is exchanged for one or more works of art or for a combination of cash, other   property, and one or more works of fine art with a fair market value of more than $1,000.
* The work is sold during the artist's lifetime or within 20 years of the artist's death.&lt;ref name="CAC"&gt;[http://www.cac.ca.gov/artsinfo/resaleroyalty.php California Arts Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

Act does not apply if:
* The sale is the initial sale of the work and the legal title of the work at the time of such initial sale is vested in the artist.
* The resale of fine art is by an art dealer to a purchaser within 10 years after the initial sale by the artist to an art dealer, provided that all intervening sales are between art dealers.
* The sale consists of a work of stained glass artistry permanently attached to real property and it was sold as part of the sale of the real property to which it was attached.&lt;ref name="CAC"/&gt;

== Requirements under the Act for Qualifying Works ==
When the sale of a work meets the conditions outlined above, a seller must pay the artist 5% of the resale price. If the artist is deceased, the payment goes to the artist's estate or heirs. It is the seller's obligation to locate the artist within 90 days of the sale. If the artist or heirs cannot be located, the seller is to make payment to the [[California Arts Council]], who will hold the collected payments for up to 7 years for the artist. In the event that the Council is unable to locate a particular artist or the artist fails to claim the collected royalties in that time period, the funds collected are distributed to the city of Sacramento's Art in Public Places&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacmetroarts.org/art-in-public-places.html&lt;/ref&gt; program.&lt;ref name="code"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/civil/986.html|title=California Civil Code  Section 986 - California Attorney Resources - California Laws|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist's right to receive the royalty cannot be waived in full; it can only be modified by written contract providing for a royalty payment in excess of the 5% of resale value that is required by the Act.&lt;ref name="code"/&gt;

== History of the Resale Right ==
California's Resale Royalty Act was signed into law in 1976. The resale right has its origins in the French law [[droit de suite]], first enacted in 1920, which provided French artists the right to receive a royalty from resales of their work.&lt;ref name="lmu.edu"&gt;"The Droite de Suite: Why American Fine Artists Should Have a Right to a Resale Royalty." Loyola of Los Angeles Entertainment Law Review. March 1, 1995. Vol. 15, Page 10.http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1297&amp;context=elr&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''droite de suite'' reflects both the idea that artists have certain moral rights in their works (such as the inalienable right to be associated with their works) and the economic concern that artists often are unable to benefit from the full value of their works, where they have low bargaining power in initial sales or where their works appreciate significantly in value after the first sale.&lt;ref name="NYSBA"&gt;"A Right Deferred:Resale Royalties for Visual Artists." Law Student Connection, February 17, 2012.http://nysbar.com/blogs/lawstudentconnection/2012/02/a_right_deferred_resale_royalt.html&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, over 60 countries across the world recognize some version of the resale right.&lt;ref name="copyright.gov2012"&gt;"Resale Royalty Right." Copyright Office, Notice of Inquiry.Federal Register Vol. 77 No. 182, page 58177.[http://www.copyright.gov/fedreg/2012/77fr58175.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Berne Convention ===
The [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] of 1886 included a ''droite de suite'' provision in Article 14''ter''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P188_36636|title=WIPO-Administered Treaties: Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in its 1948 revision. This article provided for a general recognition of a resale right among signatory countries, but included the stipulation that protection provided by such recognition “may be claimed in a country of the Union only if legislation in the country to which the author belongs so permits, and to the extent permitted by the country where this protection is claimed.”&lt;ref name="wipo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P188_36636|title=WIPO-Administered Treaties: Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Currently, California is the only state that recognizes the resale right. The Copyright Office conducted a study,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.copyright.gov/history/droit_de_suite.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1992, evaluating the nature of the resale right and the possibility of adopting a federal ''droite de suite''. The Copyright Office concluded in the report that there were not adequate economic or copyright policy justifications to warrant adopting ''droite de suite'' at the federal level. The report did indicate that should the EU harmonize its ''droit de suite'' laws and extend the resale right to all member states, Congress may at that point revisit the resale right issue.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/history/droit_de_suite.pdf|title=Study, page 149.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, legislation was proposed in both the Senate (S.2000)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-bill/2000&lt;/ref&gt; and the House (H.R.3688)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/3688&lt;/ref&gt;  in December 2011 that would provide for a national resale royalty right. The Equity for Visual Artists Act of 2011 (EVAA) would provide for a 7% royalty to be collected from sales of certain works of art where the sale price exceeded $10,000. Half of this payment would go to the artist or successor in copyright, and half would go towards an escrow account to support U.S. non-profit museums.&lt;ref name="copyright.gov2012"/&gt; Both pieces of legislation are currently in committee. In conjunction with the consideration of the legislation, in September 2012 Congress published a Notice of Inquiry&lt;ref&gt;http://www.copyright.gov/fedreg/2012/77fr58175.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; requesting comments from the public on factual and policy matters relating to a possible federal resale royalty right.

== Legal challenges ==
===Constitutionality as applied to out-of-state sales===
The Resale Royalty Act came under legal scrutiny when, in October 2011, a group of artists and their heirs filed class action suits against auction houses [[Christie's]] and [[Sotheby's]], and auction site [[eBay]] for failure of those brokers to pay royalties per the Resale Act.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;"Artists File Lawsuits, Seeking Royalties." New York Times. November 1, 2011.https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/02/arts/design/artists-file-suit-against-sothebys-christies-and-ebay.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1337627198-6z6dl6UtRYpD8XktLU1fpg&lt;/ref&gt; In a decision&lt;ref&gt;http://court.cacd.uscourts.gov/CACD/RecentPubOp.nsf/bb61c530eab0911c882567cf005ac6f9/c1e5a8ee236d7ae988257a02007034b6/$FILE/8604.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; on May 17, 2012 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Judge Jacqueline H. Nguyen dismissed the suits on the grounds that the Resale Royalty Act violated the [[Commerce Clause]] of the United States Constitution, and was therefore invalid as law. (''Estate of Graham, et al, v. Sotheby’s Inc.'')&lt;ref name="case"&gt;[http://court.cacd.uscourts.gov/CACD/RecentPubOp.nsf/bb61c530eab0911c882567cf005ac6f9/c1e5a8ee236d7ae988257a02007034b6/$FILE/8604.pdf ''Estate of Graham, et al, v. Sotheby's Inc.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commerce Clause has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as not only affirmatively granting to Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states, but also, by negative implication, prohibiting the states from unjustifiably discriminating against or burdening the flow of interstate commerce.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; A state regulation violates the Commerce clause where it “directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries of a State.”&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;

Judge Nguyen found that where the Act regulates any transaction in which the seller resides in California, regardless of the location of the sale, buyer, or artist, the Resale Royalty Act “explicitly regulates applicable sales of fine art occurring wholly outside California.”&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; The Court cited the example of a California resident placing a painting by a New York artist for sale with Sotheby's in New York, where at the subsequent auction the painting is bought by a New York resident.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; In this instance, the California law requires the New York company to withhold the amount of the royalty from the sale price, and either locate and pay the artist in New York or remit payment to the California Arts Council should the artist not be located. Further, the Act permits the New York artist to sue the New York Sotheby's under California law should the auction house fail to collect and remit the applicable royalty to the artist.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;

In 2015, an eleven-judge [[en banc]] panel of the [[Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] affirmed, holding that applying the Act to out-of-state sales made by a California resident was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=ARTNET2015&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kinsella |first1=Eileen |title=California Court Resale Royalty Unconstitutional |url=https://news.artnet.com/market/court-restricts-california-resale-law-294993 |accessdate=August 9, 2017 |work=Artnet News |date=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="12-56067"&gt;''[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2015/05/05/12-56067.pdf Sam Francis Foundation, et al. v.  Christies, Inc, et al.]'', no. 12-56067 (9th Cir. May 5, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The court struck the clause "the seller resides in California or" from the Act, declining to rule on whether the Act could otherwise be applied to sales made within California.&lt;ref name=ARTNET2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="12-56067"/&gt; In 2016, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] declined [[certiorari]], leaving the Ninth Circuit decision in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boucher |first1=Brian |title=Supreme Court Declines Artist Royalties Appeal |url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/supreme-court-declines-artists-resale-royalty-appeal-406106 |accessdate=August 9, 2017 |work=Artnet News |date=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/15-280.htm Sam Francis Foundation, et al. v.

===Preemption===
In April 2016, another federal judge, [[Michael W. Fitzgerald]], held the entire Act to be preempted by section 301 of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Meier |first1=Henry |title=Federal Ruling Puts State Artist Royalty Law in Jeopardy |url=http://labusinessjournal.com/news/2016/apr/12/federal-ruling-puts-state-artist-royalty-law-jeopa/ |accessdate=August 9, 2017 |work=Los Angeles Business Journal |date=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Estate of Robert Graham, et al. v.

Directed by Akihiro Minakata, with long time producer [[Koji Igarashi]] returning. It is the last action-adventure ''Castlevania'' game that Igarashi produced. The plot involves Shanoa, who is part of an organization set to defeat Dracula after the Belmont clan has vanished.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Castlevaniaorderofecclesia.jpg|250px|left|thumb|The player-character Shanoa can acquire glyphs, the abilities of defeated enemies.]]
''Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia'' is a two dimensional action-adventure game, featuring [[Adventure game|adventure]] and [[role-playing video game]] elements such as the ability to equip armor and cast spells. A new combat system called the "Glyph System" allows the player's character, Shanoa, to collect icons called "[[Glyph]] symbols", which she can acquire by defeating enemies or conquering challenges. These symbols can be equipped to her arms and back, allowing her to perform special powers and skills. There are over 100 different Glyphs the player can wield, such as weapon and magic glyphs. Glyphs use [[Magic point|MP]] (Magic Points) to work, and once the MP gauge is depleted, the player must stop attacking to allow it to recharge. The player can also use a special Glyph Union technique, which calls a more powerful attack based on the glyphs equipped. The Union attacks consume the Heart Points gauge, a feature that was absent in Portrait of Ruin. There are also certain Glyphs which can be used to solve some puzzles.&lt;ref name="Gametappreview"&gt;{{Cite web |first=Wes |last=Nihei|url= http://www.gametap.com/articles/gamepreviews/castlevania_order_of_ecclesia_ds-05152008 |publisher= [[GameTap]] |title=Previews: Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia - gametap.com |date=2008-05-15 |accessdate=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many different types of locales can be visited in the game, including forests, mountains, and oceans. There are a total of 20 locations, with an overworld map used to traverse between them. Besides fighting enemies and moving on from one location to next, there are also a number of side quests for the player to solve. After completing a quest, the player will receive a prize in return. If the player finishes the game, new features will become available to the player, including sound test, hard mode, boss rush mode and Albus mode, with an alternate playable character. It also features [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection|online play]], allowing the player to trade items with other players or go head-to-head in a versus mode.&lt;ref name="Gametappreview" /&gt; The game also makes use of the DS-to-Wii connectivity with ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]'', which unlocks content in both games.&lt;ref name="E3"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bozon|first=Mark|date = 2008-07-11|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/888/888655p1.html|title=Pre-E3 2008: Hands-on Castlevania Judgment|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Order of Ecclesia'' is the first canonical game in the series in which the Vampire Killer whip does not appear in any form.

==Plot==

''Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia'' takes place after ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'', sometime in the 1800s, right after the era of Richter Belmont.  As the [[List of Castlevania characters|Belmont Clan]] had vanished by that time, several organizations are created in order to research countermeasures against Dracula and his eventual return.  Among these organizations, the most promising was the Order of Ecclesia, who created a triad of magical glyphs based on Dracula's power, named "Dominus."  Shanoa is a member chosen by the order's leader, Barlowe, as the human vessel for Dominus.  As the ritual begins, the Dominus glyphs (Anger, Hatred, Agony) are stolen by Shanoa's colleague Albus, and Shanoa loses her memories and emotions.  She goes to retrieve them, unaware of his true intentions.

In her pursuit, Shanoa arrives in the deserted Wygol Village and finds out that Albus kidnapped its inhabitants, brought them to different hidden locations, and imprisoned them.  As Shanoa rescues them throughout the game, she learns that Albus captured them to perform some kind of experiment on them which involved taking samples of their blood. On two occasions, Shanoa tracks down Albus, who willingly gives her two of the Dominus glyphs. When she finds him to be possessed by the power of the third glyph, she is forced to fight him. After killing Albus, his mind and soul are absorbed by Shanoa together with the last Dominus glyph.  Albus explains that his true intentions were to find a way to defeat Dracula without Shanoa using Dominus, as he knew that it would kill her if she used it. Her lost memories and emotions were actually taken by Dominus, and not Albus, as Barlowe had told Shanoa. He also reveals that the reason he experimented on the villagers was because they were the last descendants of the Belmont Clan, and he believed their blood would have the power to help him control Dominus without it consuming him.

Confronting Barlowe after learning the truth, Shanoa learns that his true objective is to bring Dracula back to life, using Shanoa as a sacrifice.  After Barlowe is defeated in a fight, he offers his own life to revive Dracula, and Dracula's castle appears. Eventually confronting Dracula, Shanoa successfully defeats him using Dominus, seemingly at the cost of her own life.  However, Albus appears and reveals that only a single soul has to be offered.  He sacrifices his own soul in Shanoa's place, but not before he restores her memories and emotions and asks her to smile for him. The castle crumbles, and Shanoa escapes.

==Development==
The game was made by the team who developed ''[[Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/832/832811p1.html |title=Iga Confirms New DS Castlevania |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=2007-11-05 |first=Anoop |last=Gantayat |accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with Igarashi.&lt;ref name="Wired Iga"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/10/interview-iga-t.html |title=Interview: Iga Talks ''Castlevania'' Everything |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |first=Chris |last=Kohler |authorlink=Chris Kohler |date=2007-10-20 |accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''Wired'' interview, Igarashi said, "We're doing another Nintendo DS version.

''Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia'' received "favorable" reviews according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]]. Shane Bettenhausen called it a cross between ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night|Symphony of the Night]]'' and ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest|Simon's Quest]]'', noting that the high difficulty level was balanced by the role-playing elements. Bettenhausen also commented about the quality of the game, despite the length, noting there are "3 or 4 levels of things to find." He concluded his experience with the game stating "It's all action-RPG oriented ''Castlevania'' at its best".&lt;ref name="1upyours"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3?http://download.gamevideos.com/Podcasts/1UY081508.mp3|title=1Up Yours (August 15, 2008)|date=2008-08-15|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|format=[[MP3]]}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later awarded the game an A- for [[1Up.com]], stating that it "can still breathe new life into this long-running, often self-cannibalizing franchise."&lt;ref name=1UP/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Tim Turi praised its gameplay and called it his favourite portable ''Castlevania'' title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ranking The Castlevania Bloodline |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/04/04/ranking-the-castlevania-bloodline.aspx |work=[[Game Informer]] |last=Turi |first=Tim |date=2012-04-04 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edge Magazine UK gave the game a score of 6 out of 10, criticizing the excessive side quests.

[[File:Pompe funebre for Katarzyna Opalińska.jpg|thumb|''Castrum doloris'' of Queen [[Katarzyna Opalińska]]]]
'''Castrum doloris''' ([[Latin]] for ''castle of grief'') is a name for the structure and decorations sheltering or accompanying the [[catafalque]] or [[bier]] that signify the prestige or high estate of the deceased. A ''castrum doloris'' might feature an elaborate [[baldachin]] and would include [[candle]]s, possibly [[flower]]s, and in most cases [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], [[epitaph]]s and possibly [[allegorical]] [[statue]]s. Many extensive ''castra doloris'' can be traced to the customs of 17th century and 18th century or even earlier, since Pope Sixtus V's funeral arrangements included a ''castrum doloris'' in the late 16th Century.

Notable examples include [[coffin portrait]] ({{lang-pl|portret trumienny}}) of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

The '''''Chronicles of Eri; Being the History of the Gaal Sciot Iber: or, the Irish People; Translated from the Original Manuscripts in the Phoenician Dialect of the Scythian Language''''' is an 1822 book in two volumes by [[Roger O'Connor]] (1762–1834), purporting to detail the history of the Irish from the creation of the world. The work contains multiple plates and maps and is prefaced with the author naming himself "head of his race" and "chief of the prostrated people of this nation".&lt;ref name="Webb"&gt;{{cite book|last=Webb|first=Alfred John|authorlink=Alfred Webb|title=A Compendium of Irish Biography: Comprising Sketches of Distinguished Irishmen, and of Eminent Persons Connected with Ireland by Office Or by Their Writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLQAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA383|year=1878|publisher=M.H. Gill &amp; son|location=Dublin|page=383|oclc=122693688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The book is in two volumes. The first volume describes the history of the Gaels from prehistoric times up to their departure from Spain. The second volume describes their conquest of Ireland. Throughout, the text is written as if it is from authentic ancient texts, the content of which is commented upon and explained in detailed footnotes written in O'Connor's own person.

===Preface===
The book begins with a letter to O'Connor's friend [[Francis Burdett]], in which O'Connor describes alleged conspiracies against his life and his family, and refers to the military exploits of his son [[Francis Burdett O'Connor]], named after his friend. He then predicts the honour with which Burdett's name will be remembered. A preface follows in which he speaks of the many trials he had in writing the book, which is a "literal translation into the English language (from the Phoenician dialect of the Scythian language) of the ancient manuscripts, which have, fortunately for the world, been preserved through many ages, chances and visissitudes".&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, R., ''Chronicles of Eri: being the history of the Gaal Sciot Iber'' Volume 1, R. Phillips and co., 1822, preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume one===
The first volume is presented as a translation of text written by "Eolus", who was "chief of the Gael-ag" from 1368-35 BC which is said to be fifty years after Moses. This describes the origin and migrations of the Gaels. According to this text, the Gaels originated among the Phoenicians, and migrated to Sythia and Sidon, where the people who would become the Ancient Britons split off from the group that would become the Gaels. They eventually migrated to Spain.

===Volume two===
The second volume describes the Gaels' conquest of Ireland. When the Egyptian king [[Sesostris]] invaded Spain, he sought to establish "idolatry", which the Gaels resisted. In 1006 BC, they sailed from Spain to Ireland and conquered the land. They brought with them other anti-Sosostris peoples from Spain. In Ireland they established a religion based on fire worship, in which the chief deities were Baal, identified with the sun, and Re, identified with the moon.

==Critical views==
Of the supposed original Phoenician manuscripts, the only evidence O'Connor ever produced for examination was an eighteen-inch-long scroll purporting to be "a facsimile of part of the great roll of the Laws of Eri",&lt;ref name=jpp&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prendergast|first1=John P.|authorlink1=John Patrick Prendergast|title=Dangan and Roger O'Connor|journal=The Irish Monthly|date=January 1884|volume=12|issue=127|pages=35–47|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20497088?sid=21105504556213&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=3738232&amp;uid=2134|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; currently held in the [[John Rylands Library]] of the [[University of Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sources.nli.ie/Record/MS_UR_051860 Holdings: A roll bearing lettering stated by Roger O'Connor in his Chronicles of Eri to be the laws of Eri in the Phoenician dialect of the Scythian language.], National Library of Ireland&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars who have examined this manuscript "are unable to find in them the likeness of any known ancient language".&lt;ref name=jpp /&gt; The rest O'Connor claimed were lost or destroyed in various circumstances.&lt;ref name=jpp /&gt;

[[R. A. Stewart Macalister]] dismissed the book as "an amalgam of bombastic paraphrases of Irish annalistic matter, irreverent parodies of Biblical exerpts, 'etymologies' (which have to be seen to be believed), and wildly irresponsible inventions resembling those in the closely analogous ''Book of Mormon''."&lt;ref&gt;[[R.

'''Church Slavonic''', also known as '''Church Slavic'''&lt;ref name="Glottolog" /&gt;, '''New Church Slavonic''' or '''New Church Slavic''', is the conservative [[Slavic language|Slavic]] [[Sacred language|liturgical language]] used by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] in [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgaria]], [[Polish Orthodox Church|Poland]], the [[Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church|Czech Republic and Slovakia]], [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]], [[Belarusian Orthodox Church|Belarus]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbia]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Montenegro]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church – Ohrid Archbishopric|Republic of Macedonia]], [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church|Ukraine]], [[Slovenia]], and [[Croatia]]. The language appears also in the services of the [[American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese]] and occasionally in the services of the [[Orthodox Church in America]]. It was also used by the Orthodox Churches in [[Romanians|Romanian]] lands until the late 17th and early 18th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;[[Petre P. Panaitescu]], [http://www.bjmures.ro/bdPublicatii/CarteStudenti/P/Panaitescu-Interpretari.pdf Studii de istorie economică și socială] {{Ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by Roman Catholic [[Croats]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]].
It is also co-used by [[Greek Catholic]] Churches, which are under [[Holy See|Roman]] communion, in Slavic countries, for example the [[Croatian Greek Catholic Church|Croatian]], [[Slovak Greek Catholic Church|Slovak]] and [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian]] Greek Catholics, as well as by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (Croatian and Czech recensions, see below).

In addition, Church Slavonic is used by some churches which consider themselves Orthodox but are not in communion with the Orthodox Church, such as the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]], the [[Montenegrin Orthodox Church]], the [[Russian True Orthodox Church]] and others. The Russian [[Old Believers]] and the [[Edinoverie|Co-Believers]] do also use Church Slavonic.

==Historical development==
Church Slavonic represents a later stage of [[Old Church Slavonic]], and is the continuation of the liturgical tradition introduced by the [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonian]] brothers [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Cyril and Methodius]] in the late 9th century in [[Nitra]], a principal town and religious and scholarly center of [[Great Moravia]] (located in present-day [[Slovakia]]). There the first Slavic translations of the [[Scripture]] and liturgy from [[Koine Greek]] were made.

By the early 12th century, individual Slavic languages started to emerge, and the liturgical language was modified in pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary and orthography according to the local [[vernacular]] usage. These modified varieties or ''recensions'' (e.g. Serbian Church Slavonic, [[Russian Church Slavonic]], Ukrainian Church Slavonic in [[Early Cyrillic]] script, Croatian Church Slavonic in Croatian angular [[Glagolitic]] and later in [[Latin script|Latin]] script, Czech Church Slavonic, Slovak Church Slavonic in Latin script, Bulgarian Church Slavonic in [[Early Cyrillic]] and Bulgarian [[Glagolitic]] scripts ecc) eventually stabilized and their regularized forms were used by the scribes to produce new translations of liturgical material from [[Koine Greek]], or [[Latin language|Latin]] in the case of Croatian Church Slavonic.

Attestation of Church Slavonic traditions appear in [[Early Cyrillic]] and [[Glagolitic script]]. Glagolitic has nowadays fallen out of use, though both scripts were used from the earliest attested period. 

The first Church Slavonic printed book was the ''[[Missale Romanum Glagolitice]]'' (1483) in angular Glagolitic, followed shortly by five Cyrillic liturgical books printed in [[Kraków]] in 1491.

==Recensions==
[[File:Csl-luke20.png|thumb|right|An example of Russian Church Slavonic computer typography]]
Various Church Slavonic recensions were used as a liturgical and literary language in all Orthodox countries north of the Mediterranean region during the Middle Ages, even in places where the local population was not Slavic (especially in [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romania]]). 

In recent centuries, however, Church Slavonic was fully replaced by local languages in the non-Slavic countries. Even in some of the [[Slavic Orthodox]] countries, the modern national language is now used for liturgical purposes to a greater or lesser extent. 

Nevertheless, the Russian Orthodox Church, which contains around half of all Orthodox believers, still holds its liturgies almost entirely in Church Slavonic.&lt;ref&gt;See Brian P. Bennett, ''[http://www.taylorandfrancis.com/books/details/9780415780636/ Religion and Language in Post-Soviet Russia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225012715/http://www.taylorandfrancis.com/books/details/9780415780636/ |date=2013-02-25 }}'' (New York: Routledge, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exist [[parish]]es which use other languages (and the main problem here is the lack of good translations):&lt;ref&gt;See the report of Fr. Theodore Lyudogovsky and Deacon Maxim Plyakin, ''[http://www.mineya.ru/articles/87-liturgy-languages.html Liturgical languages of Slavic local churches: a current situation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120903224026/http://www.mineya.ru/articles/87-liturgy-languages.html |date=2012-09-03 }}'', 2009 (in Russian), and a draft of the article ''[http://ustav.livejournal.com/600024.html Liturgical languages in Slavia Orthodoxa]'', 2009 (also in Russian) of the same authors.&lt;/ref&gt;
* according to the decision of All-Russian Church Council of 1917–1918, service in Russian or Ukrainian can be permitted in individual parishes when approved by church authorities;
* "ethnic" parishes in Russia use (entirely or in part) their languages: [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]], [[Mordvinic languages|Mordvinic]], [[Mari language|Mari]], [[Tatar language|Tatar]] (for [[Keräşens]]), [[Sakha language|Sakha (Yakut)]] etc.;
* autonomous parts of the Russian Orthodox Church prepare and partly use translations to the languages of the local population, as Ukrainian, Belarusian, Romanian (in Moldova), Japanese, Chinese;
* parishes in the diaspora, including ones of [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] often use local languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Dutch, Portuguese etc.

Church Slavonic language (also known as '''New Church Slavonic''', the name proposed by [[František Václav Mareš|F. V. Mareš]]) is actually a set of at least four different dialects (recensions), with essential distinctions between them in dictionary, spelling (even in writing systems), phonetics etc.

The most widespread recension, Russian, has, in turn, several local sub-dialects with slightly different pronunciations.

For the list and descriptions of extinct recensions, see article ''[[Old Church Slavonic language]]''.

===Russian (Synodal) recension===
The Russian recension of New Church Slavonic is the language of books since the second half of the 17th century. It generally uses traditional Cyrillic script (''poluustav''); however, certain texts (mostly prayers) can be printed in modern alphabets with the spelling adapted to rules of local languages (for example, in Russian/Ukrainian/Bulgarian/Serbian Cyrillic or in Hungarian/Slovak/Polish Latin).

Before the eighteenth century, Church Slavonic was in wide use as a general [[literary language]] in [[Russia]]. Although it was never spoken ''per se'' outside church services, members of the priesthood, poets, and the educated tended to slip its expressions into their speech. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it was gradually replaced by the [[Russian language]] in secular literature and was retained for use only in church.  Although as late as the 1760s, [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Lomonosov]] argued that Church Slavonic was the so-called "high style" of Russian, during the nineteenth century within Russia, this point of view declined. Elements of Church Slavonic style may have survived longest in speech among the [[Old Believers]] after the late-seventeenth century [[schism (religion)|schism]] in the Russian Orthodox Church.

[[Russian language|Russian]] has borrowed many words from Church Slavonic. While both Russian and Church Slavonic are Slavic languages, some early Slavic sound combinations evolved differently in each branch. As a result, the borrowings into Russian are similar to native Russian words, but with South Slavic variances, e.g. (the first word in each pair is Russian, the second Church Slavonic): золото / злато (''zoloto / zlato''), город / град (''gorod / [[Grad (Slavic settlement)|grad]]''), горячий / горящий (''goryačiy / goryaščiy''), рожать / рождать (''rožat’ / roždat’'').  Since the Russian Romantic era and the corpus of work of the great Russian authors (from [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]] to [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]], [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]]), the relationship between words in these pairs has become traditional.  Where the abstract meaning has not commandeered the Church Slavonic word completely, the two words are often synonyms related to one another, much as Latin and native English words were related in the nineteenth century: one is archaic and characteristic of written high style, while the other is common and found in speech.

====Standard (Russian) variant====
In Russia, Church Slavonic is pronounced in the same way as [[Russian language|Russian]], with some exceptions:
* Church Slavonic features ''[[Vowel reduction in Russian|okanye]]'' and ''[[Vowel reduction in Russian|yekanye]]'', i.e., the absence of [[vowel reduction]] in unstressed syllables. That is, [[O (Cyrillic)|о]] and [[Ye (Cyrillic)|е]] in unstressed positions are always read as {{IPA|[o]}} and {{IPA|[jɛ]}}~{{IPA|[ʲɛ]}} respectively (like in northern Russian dialects), whereas in standard Russian pronunciation they have different allophones when unstressed.
* There should be no de-voicing of final consonants, although in practice there often is.
* The letter [[Ye (Cyrillic)|е]] {{IPA|[je]}} is never read as [[Yo (Cyrillic)|ё]] {{IPA|[jo]}}~{{IPA|[ʲo]}} (the letter ё does not exist in Church Slavonic writing at all). This is also reflected in borrowings from Church Slavonic into Russian: in the following pairs the first word is Church Slavonic in origin, and the second is purely Russian: небо / нёбо (''nebo / nëbo''), надежда / надёжный (''nadežda / nadëžnyj'').
* The letter [[Ge (Cyrillic)|Γ]] can traditionally be read as voiced fricative velar sound {{IPA|[ɣ]}} (just as in Southern Russian dialects); however, occlusive {{IPA|[ɡ]}} (as in standard Russian pronunciation) is also possible and has been considered acceptable since the beginning of th 20th century. When unvoiced, it becomes {{IPA|[x]}}; this has influenced the Russian pronunciation of Бог (''Bog'') as ''Boh'' [box].
*The adjective endings -аго/-его/-ого/-яго are pronounced as written ({{IPA|[aɡo]}}, {{IPA|[ʲeɡo]}}, {{IPA|[oɡo]}}, {{IPA|[ʲaɡo]}}), whereas Russian -его/-ого are pronounced with {{IPA|[v]}} instead of {{IPA|[ɡ]}} (and with the reduction of unstressed vowels).

====Serbian variant====
In Serbia, Church Slavonic is generally pronounced according to the Russian model. The medieval Serbian [[recension]] of Church Slavonic was gradually replaced by the Russian recension since the early eighteenth century. The differences from the Russian variant are limited to the lack of certain sounds in Serbian phonetics (there are no sounds corresponding to letters ы and щ, and in certain cases the palatalization is impossible to observe, e.g. ть is pronounced as т etc.).

====Ukrainian or Rusyn variant====
The main difference between Russian and (Western) Ukrainian variants of Church Slavonic lies in the pronunciation of the letter [[yat (Cyrillic)|yat]] (ѣ).  The Russian pronunciation is the same as [[Ye (Cyrillic)|е]] {{IPA|[je]}}~{{IPA|[ʲe]}} whereas the Ukrainian is the same as [[i (Cyrillic)|и]] {{IPA|[i]}}. Greek Catholic variants of Church Slavonic books printed in variants of the Latin alphabet (a method used in Austro-Hungary and Czechoslovakia) just contain the letter "i" for yat. Other distinctions reflect differences between palatalization rules of Ukrainian and Russian (for example, {{angbr|ч}} is always "soft" (palatalized) in Russian pronunciation and "hard" in Ukrainian one), different pronunciation of letters {{angbr|г}} and {{angbr|щ}}, etc.

Typographically, Serbian and (western) Ukrainian editions (when printed in traditional Cyrillic) are almost identical to the Russian ones. Certain visible distinctions may include:
* less frequent use of abbreviations in "nomina sacra";
* treating digraph {{angbr|оу}} as a single character rather than two letters (for example, in letter-spacing or in combination with diacritical marks: in Russian editions, they are placed above {{angbr|у}}, not between {{angbr|о}} and {{angbr|у}}; also, when the first letter of a word is printed in different color, it is applied to {{angbr|о}} in Russian editions and to the entire {{angbr|оу}} in Serbian and Ukrainian).

===Old Moscow recension===
The Old Moscow recension is in use among [[Old Believers]] and [[Edinoverie|Co-Believers]]. The same traditional Cyrillic alphabet as in Russian Synodal recension; however, there are differences in spelling because the Old Moscow recension reproduces an older state of orthography and grammar in general (before the 1650s). The most easily observable peculiarities of books in this recension are:
* using of digraph {{angbr|оу}} not only in the initial position,
* hyphenation with no hyphenation sign.

===Croatian recension===
{{further|Baška tablet}}
This is in limited use among Croatian Catholics. Texts are printed in the Croatian Latin alphabet (with the addition of letter {{angbr|ě}} for [[yat]]) or in Glagolitic script. Sample editions include:
* Ioseph Vais, ''Abecedarivm Palaeoslovenicvm in usum glagolitarum''. Veglae, [Krk], 1917 (2 ed.). XXXVI+76 p. (collection of liturgical texts in Glagolitic script, with a brief Church Slavonic grammar written in Latin language and Slavonic-Latin dictionary)
* ''Rimski misal slavĕnskim jezikom: Čin misi s izbranimi misami...,'' Zagreb: Kršćanska sadašnjost, 1980 (The ISBN specified even at the publisher 978-953-151-721-5 is bad, causing a checksum error) (in Croatian Latin script)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ks.hr/Biblioteke/Liturgijska-izdanja/RIMSKI-MISAL-SLAVENSKIM-JEZIKOM--Cin-misi-s-izbran.aspx |title=Rimski misal slavĕnskim jezikom |publisher=Kršćanska sadašnjost |date= |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/22194 |title=German review of ''Rimski misal slavĕnskim jezikom'' |publisher=Slovo |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czech recension===
Church Slavonic is in very limited use among Czech Catholics. The recension was restored (actually, developed) by Prof. [[Doctor of Theology|D. Th.]] [[Vojtěch Tkadlčík]] in his editions of the Roman missal:
* ''Rimskyj misal slověnskym jazykem izvoljenijem Apostolskym za Arcibiskupiju Olomuckuju iskusa dělja izdan''. Olomouc 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/21649 |title=Review (in Croatian) of ''Rimskyj misal'' (Olomouc, 1972) |publisher=Slovo |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Rimskyj misal povelěnijem svjataho vselenskaho senma Vatikanskaho druhaho obnovljen...'' Olomouc 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/22757 |title=Review (in Croatian) of ''Rimskyj misal'' (Olomouc, 1992) |publisher=Slovo |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar and style==
Although the various recensions of Church Slavonic differ in some points, they share the tendency of approximating the original [[Old Church Slavonic]] to the local Slavic vernacular. Inflection tends to follow the ancient patterns with few simplifications. All original six verbal tenses, seven nominal cases, and three numbers are intact in most frequently used traditional texts (but in the newly composed texts, authors avoid most archaic constructions and prefer variants that are closer to modern Russian syntax and are better understood by the Slavic-speaking people).

In Russian recension, the fall of the [[yer]]s is fully reflected, more or less to the [[Russia]]n pattern, although the terminal ъ continues to be written.  The [[yus]]es are often replaced or altered in usage to the sixteenth- or seventeenth-century Russian pattern.  The [[yat]] continues to be applied with greater attention to the ancient etymology than it was in nineteenth-century Russian. The letters [[Ksi (Cyrillic letter)|ksi]], [[psi (Cyrillic)|psi]], [[omega (Cyrillic)|omega]], [[ot (Cyrillic)|ot]], and [[izhitsa]] are kept, as are the letter-based denotation of numerical values, the use of stress accents, and the abbreviations or ''[[titlo|titla]]'' for ''[[nomina sacra]]''.

The vocabulary and syntax, whether in scripture, liturgy, or church missives, are generally somewhat modernised in an attempt to increase comprehension.  In particular, some of the ancient pronouns have been eliminated from the scripture (such as етеръ {{IPA|/jeter/}} "a certain (person, etc.)" → нѣкій in the Russian recension). Many, but not all, occurrences of the imperfect tense have been replaced with the perfect.

Miscellaneous other modernisations of classical formulae have taken place from time to time.  For example, the opening of the [[Gospel of John]], by tradition the first words written down by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], (искони бѣаше слово) "In the beginning was the Word", were set as "искони  бѣ слово" in the [[Ostrog Bible]] of [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]] (1580/1581) and as въ началѣ бѣ слово in the [[Elizabeth Bible|Elizabethan Bible]] of 1751, still in use in the Russian Orthodox Church.

'''Classical Latin''' is the modern term used to describe the form of the [[Latin|Latin language]] recognized as [[standard language|standard]] by writers of the late [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire]]. In some later periods, it was regarded as "good" Latin, with later versions being viewed as debased or corrupt. The word ''Latin'' is now taken by default as meaning "Classical Latin", so that, for example, modern Latin textbooks describe Classical Latin. [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] and his contemporaries of the late republic, while using ''lingua latina'' and ''sermo latinus'' to mean the Latin language as opposed to Greek or other languages, and ''sermo vulgaris'' or ''sermo vulgi'' to refer to the [[Vulgar Latin|vernacular]], referred to the speech they valued most and in which they wrote as ''latinitas'',&lt;ref&gt;When rarely used in English, the term is capitalized: ''Latinitas''. In Latin it was written all in uppercase: ''LATINITAS'', as were all words in Latin.&lt;/ref&gt; "Latinity", with the implication of good. Sometimes it was called ''sermo familiaris'', "speech of the good families", ''sermo urbanus'', "speech of the city" or rarely ''sermo nobilis'', "noble speech". But besides ''latinitas'', it was mainly called ''latine'' (adverb), "in good Latin", or ''latinius'' (comparative degree of the adverb), "in better Latin".

''Latinitas'' was spoken as well as written, and it was the language taught in schools. [[prescriptive grammar|Prescriptive]] rules therefore applied to it, and where a special subject was concerned, such as [[poetry]] or [[rhetoric]], additional rules applied. Now that the spoken ''Latinitas'' has become extinct (in favor of various other registers later in date) the rules of the, for the most part, polished (''politus'') texts may give these the appearance of an artificial language, but ''Latinitas'' was a form of ''sermo'', or spoken language, and as such retains spontaneity. No texts by Classical Latin authors are noted for the type of rigidity evidenced by stylized art, except possibly the repetitious abbreviations and stock phrases of inscriptions.

==Philological constructs==

===Classical===
Good Latin in [[philology]] is "classical" [[Latin literature]]. The term refers to the canonicity of works of literature written in Latin in the late [[Roman Republic]] and the early to middle [[Roman Empire]]: "that is to say, that of belonging to an exclusive group of authors (or works) that were considered to be emblematic of a certain genre."{{Sfn | Citroni | 2006 | p = 204}}  The term ''classicus'' (masculine plural ''classici'') was devised by the Romans themselves to translate Greek ἐγκριθέντες (enkrithentes), "select", referring to authors who wrote in Greek that were considered model. Before then, ''classis'', in addition to being a naval fleet, was a social class in one of the diachronic divisions of Roman society according to property ownership by the Roman constitution.{{Sfn | Citroni | 2006 | p = 205}}  The word is a transliteration of Greek κλῆσις (klēsis) "calling", used to rank army draftees by property from first to fifth class.

''Classicus'' is anything ''primae classis'', "first class", such as the authors of the polished works of ''Latinitas'', or ''sermo urbanus''. It had nuances of the certified and the authentic: ''testis classicus'', "reliable witness." It was in this sense that [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto]] (an [[Africa]]n-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] lawyer and language teacher) in the 2nd century AD used ''scriptores classici'', "first-class" or "reliable authors" whose works could be relied upon as model of good Latin.{{Sfn | Citroni | 2006 | p = 206 | ps =, reported in [[Aulus Gellius]], 9.8.15.}}  This is the first known reference, possibly innovated at this time, to classical applied to authors by virtue of the authentic language of their works.{{Sfn | Citroni | 2006 | p = 207}}

===Canonical===

In imitation of the Greek grammarians, the Roman ones, such as [[Quintilian]], drew up lists termed ''indices'' or ''ordines'' on the model of the Greek lists, termed ''pinakes'', considered classical: the ''recepti scriptores'', "select writers."  [[Aulus Gellius]] includes many authors, such as [[Plautus]], who are currently considered writers of [[Old Latin]] and not strictly in the period of classical Latin.  The classical Romans distinguished Old Latin as ''prisca Latinitas'' and not ''sermo vulgaris''. Each author (and work) in the Roman lists was considered equivalent to one in the Greek; for example [[Ennius]] was the Latin [[Homer]], the [[Aeneid]] was a new [[Iliad]], and so on. The lists of classical authors were as far as the Roman grammarians went in developing a [[philology]]. The topic remained at that point while interest in the ''classici scriptores'' declined in the medieval period as the best Latin yielded to [[medieval Latin]], somewhat less than the best by classical standards.

The [[Renaissance]] brought a revival of interest in restoring as much of Roman culture as could be restored and with it the return of the concept of classic, "the best."  [[Thomas Sébillet]] in 1548 (''Art Poétique'') referred to "les bons et classiques poètes françois", meaning [[Jean de Meun]] and [[Alain Chartier]], which was the first modern application of the word.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} According to Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, the term classical, from ''classicus'', entered modern English in 1599, some 50 years after its re-introduction on the continent. Governor [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]] in 1648 referred to [[synod]]s of a [[separatist]] church as "classical meetings" in his ''Dialogue'', a report of a meeting between New-England-born "young men" and "ancient men" from Holland and England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=William|last=Bradford|contribution=Gov. Bradford's Dialogue|title=New England's Memorial|editor-first=Nathaniel|editor-last = Morton| publisher = Congregational Board of Publication|location= Boston | year =1855|origyear=1648|page = 330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1715 [[Laurence Echard]]'s ''Classical Geographical Dictionary'' was published.{{Sfn | Littlefield | 1904 | p = 301}}  In 1736 [[Robert Ainsworth (lexicographer)|Robert Ainsworth]]'s ''Thesaurus Linguae Latinae Compendarius'' turned English words and expressions into "proper and classical Latin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Robert|last= Ainsworth|title= Article XXX: Thesaurus Linguae Latinae Compendarius|journal= The Present State of the Republic of Letters|volume= XVII | date= January 1736 | location = London|publisher=W. Innys and R. Manby}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1768 [[David Ruhnken]] (''Critical History of the Greek Orators'') recast the mold of the view of the classical by applying the word canon to the ''pinakes'' of orators, after the [[Biblical canon]] or list of authentic books of the Bible. Ruhnken had a kind of secular [[catechism]] in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=51|title=The making of the modern canon: genesis and crisis of a literary idea|first=Jan |last=Gorak|location=London|publisher=Athlone|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ages of Latin===
[[File:Wilhelm Siegmund Teuffel - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|Wilhelm Sigismund Teuffel]]
In 1870 [[Wilhelm Siegmund Teuffel|Wilhelm Sigismund Teuffel]] in ''Geschichte der Römischen Literatur'' (''A History of Roman Literature'') innovated the definitive philological classification of classical Latin based on the metaphoric uses of the ancient myth of the [[Ages of Man]], a practice then universally current: a Golden Age and a Silver Age of classical Latin were to be presumed.  The practice and Teuffel's classification, with modifications, are still in use.  His work was translated into English as soon as published in German by Wilhelm Wagner, who corresponded with Teuffel. Wagner published the English translation in 1873. Teuffel divides the chronology of classical Latin authors into several periods according to political events, rather than by style.  Regarding the style of the literary Latin of those periods he had but few comments.

Teuffel was to go on with other editions of his history, but meanwhile it had come out in English almost as soon as it did in German and found immediate favorable reception.  In 1877 [[Charles Thomas Cruttwell]] produced the first English work along the same lines. In his Preface he refers to "Teuffel's admirable history, without which many chapters in the present work could not have attained completeness" and also gives credit to Wagner.

Cruttwell adopts the same periods with minor differences; however, where Teuffel's work is mainly historical, Cruttwell's work contains detailed analyses of style. Nevertheless, like Teuffel he encounters the same problem of trying to summarize the voluminous detail in a way that captures in brief the gist of a few phases of writing styles. Like Teuffel, he has trouble finding a name for the first of the three periods (the current [[Old Latin]] phase), calling it mainly "from [[Lucius Livius Andronicus|Livius]] to [[Sulla]]." The language, he says, is "…marked by immaturity of art and language, by a vigorous but ill-disciplined imitation of Greek poetical models, and in prose by a dry sententiousness of style, gradually giving way to a clear and fluent strength…"  These abstracts have little meaning to those not well-versed in Latin literature. In fact, Cruttwell admits "The ancients, indeed, saw a difference between [[Ennius]], [[Pacuvius]], and [[Lucius Accius|Accius]], but it may be questioned whether the advance would be perceptible by us."

Some of Cruttwell's ideas have become established in Latin philology.  While praising the application of rules to classical Latin, most intensely in the Golden Age, he says "In gaining accuracy, however, classical Latin suffered a grievous loss.  It became cultivated as distinct from a natural language… Spontaneity, therefore, became impossible and soon invention also ceased…  In a certain sense, therefore, Latin was studied as a dead language, while it was still a living."{{Sfn | Cruttwell | 1877 | p = 3}}

A second problem is the appropriateness of Teuffel's scheme to the concept of classical Latin, which Teuffel does not discuss. Cruttwell addresses the problem, however, altering the concept of the classical. As the best Latin is defined as golden Latin, the second of the three periods, the other two periods considered classical are left hanging. While on the one hand assigning to Old Latin the term pre-classical and by implication the term post-classical (or post-Augustan) to silver Latin Cruttwell realizes that this construct is not according to ancient usage and asserts "…the epithet classical is by many restricted to the authors who wrote in it [golden Latin].  It is best, however, not to narrow unnecessarily the sphere of classicity; to exclude [[Terence]] on the one hand or [[Tacitus]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] on the other, would savour of artificial restriction rather than that of a natural classification." The contradiction remains; Terence is and is not a classical author depending on context.{{Sfn | Cruttwell | 1877 | p = 142}}

==Authors of the Golden Age==
[[File:Bakalovich at Maecenas' reception.jpg|thumb|''At Maecenas' Reception'', oil, [[Stepan Bakalovich]], 1890. An artist's view of the classical. Maecenas knew and entertained everyone literary in the Golden Age, especially Augustus.]]
After defining a "First Period" of inscriptional Latin and the literature of the earliest known authors and fragments, to which he assigns no definitive name (he does use the term "Old Roman" at one point), Teuffel presents "the second period", his major, "das goldene Zeitalter der römischen Literatur", the Golden Age of Roman Literature, dated 671–767 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] or 83 BC – 14 AD according to his time reckoning, between the dictatorship of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix]] and the death of the emperor [[Augustus]].{{Sfn | Teuffel | 1870 | p = 216}}{{Sfn | Teuffel | 1873 | p = 226}}  Of it Wagner translating Teuffel writes

{{quote |The golden age of the Roman literature is that period in which the climax was reached in the perfection of form, and in most respects also in the methodical treatment of the subject-matters. It may be subdivided between the generations, in the first of which (the Ciceronian Age) prose culminated, while poetry was principally developed in the Augustan Age.}}

The Ciceronian Age was dated 671–711 AUC (83 BC – 43 BC), ending just after the death of M. Tullius Cicero, and the Augustan 711–67 AUC (43 BC – 14 AD), ending with the death of Augustus. The Ciceronian Age is further divided by the consulship of Cicero in 691 AUC or 63 BC into a first and second half. Authors are assigned to these periods by years of principal achievements.

The Golden Age had already made an appearance in German philology but in a less systematic way. In Bielfeld's 1770 ''Elements of universal erudition'' the author says (in translation): "The Second Age of Latin began about the time of Caesar [his ages are different from Teuffel's], and ended with Tiberius. This is what is called the Augustan Age, which was perhaps of all others the most brilliant, a period at which it should seem as if the greatest men, and the immortal authors, had met together upon the earth, in order to write the Latin language in its utmost purity and perfection."{{Sfn | Bielfeld | Hooper | 1770 | p = 244}} and of Tacitus "…his conceits and sententious style is not that of the golden age…".{{Sfn | Bielfeld | Hooper | 1770 | p = 345}}  Teuffel evidently received the ideas of a golden and silver Latin from an existing tradition and embedded them in a new system, transforming them as he thought best.

In Cruttwell's introduction, the Golden Age is dated 80 BC – 14 AD ("from [[Cicero]] to [[Ovid]]"), which is about the same as Teuffel's. Of this "Second Period" Cruttwell says that it "represents the highest excellence in prose and poetry," paraphrasing Teuffel. The Ciceronian Age is now "the Republican Period" and is dated 80–42 BC through the [[Battle of Philippi]]. Later in the book Cruttwell omits Teuffel's first half of the Ciceronian and starts the Golden Age at Cicero's consulship of 63 BC, an error perpetuated into Cruttwell's second edition as well. He must mean 80 BC as he includes Varro in Golden Latin. Teuffel's Augustan Age is Cruttwell's Augustan Epoch, 42 BC – 14 AD.

=== Republican ===
[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], after whom Teuffel named his Ciceronian period of the Golden Age]]

The literary histories list all authors canonical to the Ciceronian Age even though their works may be fragmentary or may not have survived at all. With the exception of a few major writers, such as Cicero, Caesar, Virgil and Catullus, ancient accounts of Republican literature are glowing accounts of jurists and orators who wrote prolifically but who now can't be read because their works have been lost, or analyses of language and style that appear insightful but can't be verified because there are no surviving instances. In that sense the pages of literary history are peopled with shadows: Aquilius Gallus, [[Quintus Hortensius Hortalus]], [[Lucullus|Lucius Licinius Lucullus]] and many others who left a reputation but no readable works; they are to be presumed in the Golden Age by their associations.  A list of some canonical authors of the period, whose works have survived in whole or in part (typically in part, some only short fragments) is as follows:
* [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] (116–27 BC), highly influential grammarian
* [[Titus Pomponius Atticus]] (112/109 – 35/32), publisher and correspondent of Cicero
* [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] (106–43 BC), orator, philosopher, essayist, whose works define golden Latin prose and are used in Latin curricula beyond the elementary level
* [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]] (106–43 BC), jurist, poet
* [[Decimus Laberius]] (105–43 BC), writer of mimes
* [[Marcus Furius Bibaculus]] (1st century BC), writer of ''ludicra''
* [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]] (103–44 BC), general, statesman, historian
* [[Gaius Oppius]] (1st century BC), secretary to Julius Caesar, probable author under Caesar's name
* [[Gaius Matius]] (1st century BC), public figure, correspondent with Cicero
* [[Cornelius Nepos]] (100–24 BC), biographer
* [[Publilius Syrus]] (1st century BC), writer of mimes and maxims
* [[Quintus Cornificius]] (1st century BC), public figure and writer on rhetoric
* [[Titus Lucretius Carus]] (Lucretius; 94–50 BC), poet, philosopher
* [[Publius Nigidius Figulus]] (98–45 BC), public officer, grammarian
* [[Aulus Hirtius]] (90–43 BC), public officer, military historian
* [[Gaius Helvius Cinna]] (1st century BC), poet
* [[Marcus Caelius Rufus]] (87–48 BC), orator, correspondent with Cicero
* [[Gaius Sallustius Crispus]] (86–34 BC), historian
* [[Cato the Younger|Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis]] (Cato the Younger; 95–46 BC), orator
* [[Publius Valerius Cato]] (1st century BC), poet, grammarian
* [[Gaius Valerius Catullus]] (Catullus; 84–54 BC), poet
* [[Gaius Licinius Macer Calvus]] (82–47 BC), orator, poet

=== Augustan ===
[[Image:Publius Vergilius Maro1.jpg|thumb|upright|Virgil's bust, on his tomb in [[Naples]]]]
{{Main|Augustan literature (ancient Rome)}}
The Golden Age is divided by the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]]. In the wars that followed the Republican generation of literary men was lost, as most of them had taken the losing side; Marcus Tullius Cicero was beheaded in the street as he enquired from his litter what the disturbance was.{{Citation needed|reason=contradicts the article on Cicero|date=July 2013}} They were replaced by a new generation that had grown up and been educated under the old and were now to make their mark under the watchful eye of the new emperor. As the demand for great orators was more or less over,{{Sfn | Teuffel | 1873 | p = 385 | ps =, "Public life became extinct, all political business passed into the hands of the monarch..."}} the talent shifted emphasis to poetry. Other than the historian [[Livy]], the most remarkable writers of the period were the poets [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], and [[Ovid]]. Although Augustus evidenced some toleration to republican sympathizers, he exiled Ovid, and imperial tolerance ended with the continuance of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]].

Augustan writers include:
* [[Virgil|Publius Vergilius Maro]] (Virgil, spelled also as Vergil; 70 – 19 BC),
* [[Horace|Quintus Horatius Flaccus]] (Horace; 65 – 8 BC), known for lyric poetry and satires
* [[Sextus Propertius|Sextus Aurelius Propertius]] (50 – 15 BC), poet
* [[Albius Tibullus]] (54–19 BC), elegiac poet
* [[Publius Ovidius Naso]] (Ovid; 43 BC –  AD 18), poet
* [[Livy|Titus Livius]] (Livy; 64 BC – AD 12), historian
* [[Grattius Faliscus]] (a contemporary of Ovid), poet
* [[Marcus Manilius]] (1st century BC and AD), astrologer, poet
* [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]] (64 BC – AD 17), librarian, poet, mythographer
* [[Marcus Verrius Flaccus]] (55 BC – AD 20), grammarian, philologist, calendrist
* [[Vitruvius|Marcus Vitruvius Pollio]] (80-70 BC — after 15 BC), engineer, architect
* [[Marcus Antistius Labeo]] (d. AD 10 or 11), jurist, philologist
* [[Lucius Cestius Pius]] (1st century BC &amp; AD), Latin educator
* [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] (1st century BC), historian, naturalist
* [[Marcus Porcius Latro]] (1st century BC), rhetorician
* [[Gaius Valgius Rufus]] (consul 12 BC), poet

== Authors of the Silver Age ==
[[File:Tiberius NyCarlsberg01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The frowning second emperor, [[Tiberius]], limited free speech, precipitating the rise of Silver Latin, with its emphasis on [[mannerism]] rather than on solid content, according to Teuffel's model]]
In his second volume, on the ''Imperial Period'', Teuffel initiated a slight alteration in approach, making it clearer that his terms applied to the Latin and not just to the age, and also changing his dating scheme from years AUC to modern. Although he introduces ''das silberne Zeitalter der römischen Literatur'', "the Silver Age of Roman Literature", 14–117 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Teuffel (1870) p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt; from the death of Augustus to the death of [[Trajan]], he also mentions regarding a section of a work by [[Seneca the Elder]] a ''wenig Einfluss der silbernen Latinität'', a "slight influence of silver Latin." It is clear that he had shifted in thought from golden and silver ages to golden and silver Latin, and not just Latin, but ''Latinitas'', which must at this point be interpreted as classical Latin.  He may have been influenced in that regard by one of his sources, E. Opitz, who in 1852 had published a title ''specimen lexilogiae argenteae latinitatis'', mentioning silver Latinity.{{Sfn | Teuffel | 1870 | p = 530}}  Although Teuffel's First Period was equivalent to [[Old Latin]] and his Second Period was equal to the Golden Age, his Third Period, ''die römische Kaiserheit'', encompasses both the Silver Age and the centuries now termed [[Late Latin]], in which the forms seemed to break loose from their foundation and float freely; that is, literary men appeared uncertain as to what "good Latin" should mean.  The last of the Classical Latin is the Silver Latin. The Silver Age is the first of the Imperial Period and is divided into ''die Zeit der julischen Dynastie'', 14–68; ''die Zeit der flavischen Dynastie'', 69–96; and ''die Zeit des Nerva und Trajan'', 96–117. Subsequently, Teuffel goes over to a century scheme: 2nd, 3rd, etc., through 6th. His later editions (which came out in the rest of the late 19th century) divide the Imperial Age into parts: the 1st century (Silver Age), the 2nd century: [[Hadrian]] and the [[Antonines]]  and the 3rd through the 6th Centuries. Of the Silver Age proper, pointing out that anything like freedom of speech had vanished with [[Tiberius]], Teuffel says{{Sfn | Teuffel | Schwabe | 1892 | pp = 4–5}}

{{quote | …the continual apprehension in which men lived caused a restless versatility…  Simple or natural composition was considered insipid; the aim of language was to be brilliant…  Hence it was dressed up with abundant tinsel of epigrams, rhetorical figures and poetical terms…  [[Mannerism]] supplanted style, and bombastic pathos took the place of quiet power.}}

The content of new literary works was continually proscribed by the emperor (by executing or exiling the author), who also played the role of literary man (typically badly). The talent therefore went into a repertory of new and dazzling mannerisms, which Teuffel calls "utter unreality." Cruttwell picks up this theme:{{Sfn | Cruttwell | 1877 | p = 6}}

{{quote | The foremost of these [characteristics] is unreality, arising from the extinction of freedom…  Hence arose a declamatory tone, which strove by frigid and almost hysterical exaggeration to make up for the healthy stimulus afforded by daily contact with affairs. The vein of artificial rhetoric, antithesis and epigram… owes its origin to this forced contentment with an uncongenial sphere. With the decay of freedom, taste sank…}}

[[File:Marcus Aurelius Metropolitan Museum.png|thumb|upright|right|[[Marcus Aurelius]], emperor over the last generation of classicists and himself a classicist.]]
In Cruttwell's view (which had not been expressed by Teuffel), Silver Latin was a "rank, weed-grown garden", a "decline."{{Sfn | Cruttwell | 1877 | p = 341}}  Cruttwell had already decried what he saw as a loss of spontaneity in Golden Latin. That Teuffel should regard the Silver Age as a loss of natural language and therefore of spontaneity, implying that the Golden Age had it, is passed without comment.  Instead, Tiberius brought about a "sudden collapse of letters."  The idea of a decline had been dominant in English society since [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''. Once again, Cruttwell evidences some unease with his stock pronouncements: "The ''Natural History'' of Pliny shows how much remained to be done in fields of great interest." The idea of Pliny as a model is not consistent with any sort of decline; moreover, Pliny did his best work under emperors at least as tolerant as Augustus had been. To include some of the best writings of the Silver Age, Cruttwell found he had to extend the period through the death of [[Marcus Aurelius]], 180 AD.  The philosophic prose of that good emperor was in no way compatible with either Teuffel's view of unnatural language or Cruttwell's depiction of a decline. Having created these constructs, the two philologists found they could not entirely justify them; apparently, in the worst implications of their views, there was no classical Latin by the ancient definition at all and some of the very best writing of any period in world history was a stilted and degenerate unnatural language.

The Silver Age also furnishes the only two extant Latin novels: Apuleius's ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' and Petronius's ''[[Satyricon]]''.

Perhaps history's best-known example of Classical Latin was written by [[Pontius Pilate]] on the placard placed above [[Jesus]]' Cross: [[IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDAEORVM]], which translates to ''Jesus the Nazarean the King of the Judeans'' (Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews).

Of the additional century granted by Cruttwell and others of his point of view to Silver Latin but not by Teuffel the latter says "The second century was a happy period for the Roman State, the happiest indeed during the whole Empire…  But in the world of letters the lassitude and enervation, which told of Rome's decline, became unmistakeable… its forte is in imitation."{{Sfn | Teuffel | Schwabe | 1892 | p = 192}}  Teuffel, however, excepts the jurists; others find other "exceptions," recasting Teuffels's view.{{clarify|date=March 2014}}

==Stylistic shifts==
The [[Style (fiction)|style]] of language refers to repeatable features of speech that are somewhat less general than the fundamental characteristics of the language. The latter give it a unity allowing it to be referenced under a single name. Thus Old Latin, Classical Latin, [[Vulgar Latin]], etc., are not considered different languages, but are all referenced under the name of [[Latin]]. This is an ancient practice continued by moderns rather than a philological innovation of recent times.  That Latin had case endings is a fundamental feature of the language.  Whether a given form of speech prefers to use prepositions such as ''ad'', ''ex'', ''de'' for "to", "from" and "of" rather than simple case endings is a matter of style.  Latin has a large number of styles. Each and every author has a style, which typically allows his prose or poetry to be identified by experienced Latinists.  The problem of comparative literature has been to group styles finding similarities by period, in which case one may speak of Old Latin, Silver Latin, Late Latin as styles or a phase of styles.

The ancient authors themselves first defined style by recognizing different kinds of ''sermo'', or "speech."  In making the value judgement that classical Latin was "first class" and that it was better to write with ''Latinitas'' they were themselves selecting the literary and upper-class language of the city as a standard style and all ''sermo'' that differed from it was a different style; thus in rhetoric Cicero was able to define sublime, intermediate and low styles (within classical Latin) and St. Augustine to recommend the low style for sermons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|page= 33|first= Erich|last= Auerbach |title= Literary Language and its Public in Late Latin Antiquity and in the Middle Ages|publisher= Pantheon Books|year= 1965|origyear= 1958|series= Bollingen Series LXXIV|first2= Ralph (Translator) | last2 =Mannheim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Style, therefore, is to be defined by differences in speech from a standard. Teuffel defined that standard as Golden Latin.

[[John Edwin Sandys]], for many decades an authority on Latin style, summarizes the differences between Golden and Silver Latin as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=John Edwin|last=Sandys|title=A Companion to Latin Studies Edited for the Syndics of the University Press|edition=3rd|location=Cambridge|publisher=University Press|year=1921|pages=824–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Silver Latin is to be distinguished by
* "an exaggerated conciseness and point"
* "occasional archaic words and phrases derived from poetry"
* "increase in the number of Greek words in ordinary use" (the Emperor [[Claudius]] in [[Suetonius]] refers to "both our languages", Latin and Greek&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, Claudius, 24.1.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* "literary reminiscences"
* "The literary use of words from the common dialect" (''dictare'' and ''dictitare'' as well as classical ''dicere'', "to say")

The '''Commonwealth of World Citizens''' (later named 'Mondcivitan Republic' after the [[Esperanto]]) was founded by [[Hugh J. Schonfield]], an associate of [[H.G. Wells]], in 1956. The organisation describes itself as  a '''servant-Nation'''.&lt;ref&gt;The politics of God Hugh Joseph Schonfield - 1970 "There shall be identical treatment of those outside the Commonwealth as of those within it, treatment that is founded on reverence for the human personality. 3. The Commonwealth of World Citizens shall ever promote and actively assist ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World citizenship and mundialism: a guide to the building of a ... - Page 23 John Charles de Villamar Roberts - 1999 "The Commonwealth of World Citizens offered itself as an example of a new "nation" devoted solely to serving humanity. Its founder, Dr. Hugh Schonfield, a distinguished Biblical scholar, had worked for world citizenship and mundialism ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
Hugh Schonfield&lt;ref&gt;For a complete biography of Hugh Schonfield see: Engelking S.A. (2017) "A Life for Mankind - The Biography of Hugh Joseph Schonfield" - The Hugh &amp; Helene Schonfield World Service Trust {{ISBN|978 199 986 9106}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a biblical scholar, who was later best known for his book ''The Passover Plot.''&lt;ref&gt;No Sense of Obligation: Science and Religion in an Impersonal Universe - Page 141 Matt Young - 2001 "Hugh Schonfield was a New Testament scholar who was educated at King's College, London, and earned a doctorate in sacred literature at the University of Glasgow. He was a prolific author but received attention mostly for The Passover Plot..."&lt;/ref&gt; Schonfield first felt the need for an organisation for the service of all nations as far back as 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Alternative approaches to world government Hanna Newcombe - 1967 "The Commonwealth of World Citizens, or Mondcivitans , was founded long before [[Garry Davis]]. In 1938, Dr. Hugh Schonfield, distinguished British Jewish scholar and diplomat, conceived the civilized world's need for a new "independent and ...&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1938 to 1950 Schonfield examined various aspects of the project, including questions of international law.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Schonfield came up with the idea of a body of persons from different countries which would have relations with the governments of other countries, without that organisation holding any territory itself. When the [[United Nations]] was formed, Schonfield wrote to the [[Secretary-General]] and to all the states party to the charter of his desire to form his Mondcivitan Republic. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In the summer of 1951, a General Assembly of the organisation's members was held in [[Paris]], which appointed a Secretariat as the acting administration with offices in [[London]]. By 1952 the organisation had members in 14 countries, by 1954 in 25 countries and by 1955 in 30 countries. The second General Assembly in 1953 set up a commission to draft the text of the constitution of the organisation. Following amendments at the third General Assembly in 1955, the organisation's provisional [[Constitution]] was approved for adoption. In the same year [[humanitarian]] activities were initiated by the creation of the World Service Trust as a specialised agency of the organisation.

[[Caresse Crosby]] merged her group with the Commonwealth of World Citizens.&lt;ref&gt;The Cramoisy Queen: A Life of [[Caresse Crosby]] - Page 168 Linda Hamalian - 2009 All that was required, she thought, was formal official status, and so she merged with the legally established Commonwealth of World Citizens founded by Dr. Hugh Schonfield, a British historian and scholar of what the West called the ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideals===
The organisation arose from the need felt by members throughout the world to give organic expression to the idea of the fundamental unity of the human race by developing a common way of life and government, which experimentally would be a preparation by example for a co-operative [[World community]] embracing all peoples.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The organisation was to consist of all its members at any given time, without regard for colour or ethnic origin. In its political expression it was a free and self-governing organisation and ''world community''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The new organisation expressed the goal of world unity and human fraternity. The idea was that the organisation should advocate for international reconciliation and the resolution of international problems and conflicts. The loyalty it demanded was higher than that given to any state, requiring in the individual full dedication to the principles and purposes of the new nation, yet at the initial stage without forfeiting state [[citizenship]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

For the members, state citizenship was to be always secondary to membership within the organisation. Any member was expected to be primarily concerned with the affairs and policies of the organisation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Taking part in war, aggression of oppression was strictly prohibited and the member was supposed to be prepared to suffer the penalties.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} All members were expected to live and abide by a set of seven principles:{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}
* No-one is an Enemy
* No-one is a Foreigner
* Service to All
* Complete Impartiality
* Work for Peace
* True [[Democracy]]
* Equity and Justice

==''The Republic''==
With members in 33 countries it was decided in 1956 that the ''Mondcivitan Republic'' should be proclaimed in being ''de facto'' and that all governments should be advised accordingly and furnished with a copy of the constitution.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} A Constituent Assembly of the organisation's members was convened at the [[Temple of Peace, Cardiff]], headquarters of the [[United Nations Association]] in [[Wales]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The organisation's constitution was adopted on August 29 and the flag of the organisation hoisted over the building.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} A council was elected to prepare the way for parliamentary government.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1958 a [[democracy|democratic]] election was held giving opportunity to all members in the countries where they resided to elect deputies to the first parliament which met in [[Vienna]] in May 1959.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Up to this time the organisation had used the title, "Commonwealth of World Citizens" which was abandoned in favour of "The Mondcivitan Republic". Hugh Schonfield, the pioneer of the enterprise, was elected acting president and the organisation chose an executive committee headed by a young member, Donald Hanby  who was referred to as the ''prime minister''.

In 1963, the organisation held its second ''parliament''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The term of this body was to be for five years. In accordance with the constitution, a presidium of five was elected under the name of the Supreme Council, each member of which would hold the office of president for one year in turn.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Those elected, in the order of their presidency, were Frieda Bacon, Justo Priesto, Nguyen-Huu, [[Anthony Brooke]] and Hugh J. Schonfield, the last named to take office at the end of August 1967. The post of ''prime minister'' was relinquished and replaced under the constitution with that of ''commissioner-general'' and Donald Hanby was elected to that office.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

At this time, the [[International Arbitration League]], founded at the beginning of the 20th century by the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner, Sir [[William Randal Cremer]], decided that its work could best be continued by the ''Mondcivitan Republic'' and the two organisations fused.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The work of the World Service Trust continued and a housing agency, the Cremer Housing Association, was formed, which later provided new premises for use by the organisation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1971, the provisional constitution was suspended to make way for formulating a full constitution.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} To enable the organisation to ensure the best means of governance, an executive council was appointed to take full responsibility for the organisation's affairs in the interim period.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} It was hoped that a full constitution and self-government could be achieved by 1975, but this did not happen.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Projects==
In 1972 Hugh Schonfield's book about the fundamental ideas behind the organisation, The ''Politics of God,'' was published and received much interest, particularly because it had been preceded by the best-selling [[The Passover Plot]], which had created much discussion and aroused interest in the concept of [[Messianism]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The Community school project was started as an experiment by the organisation's membership.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} It was intended to provide a viable alternative to the prevalent educational concepts, with primary aim to give each child freedom, experience, resources and love.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} It was believed that this should take place in, and be directly concerned with, the community as a whole, encouraging children to take an active interest in serving and changing the community for the betterment of the whole of mankind.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Various methods of achieving these aims were implemented.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The school was supported by donations from members and charged no fees.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Many of the children were "problem" children from the neighbourhood of the school who went on to lead productive lives.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==The World Service Trust==
The World Service Trust was founded in 1955 as a special agency of the organisation for the purpose of giving impartial aid to people and countries in circumstances of poverty, famine, disease and epidemics, as well as natural disasters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The secondary organisation was also designed to assist education and improve standards of living.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1990 the secondary organisation became a foundation and was renamed "The Hugh and Helene Schonfield World Service Trust".{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The Schonfields contributed to it financially. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The organisation fell into decline following the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Its archives are now deposited with the [[Bishopsgate Institute]] in London.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}
Its activities became more centred in Germany as the community initiated by [[Wilhelm Haller]] felt a more decentralised and less bureaucratic approach was necessary. A new initiative was started in 2004 with the founding of the 'International Leadership and Business Society', intended to encourage the application of the original Mondcivitan principles in business and everyday life. The Hugh &amp; Helene Schonfield World Service Trust continued to work particularly with its responsibility for the archiving and publicising of the work of the late Hugh J. Schonfield and research into the concepts of Messianism, [[Humanitism]] and ''Servant-Nationhood'' and methods to find their practical realisation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 2014 a revival of the movement was started in an attempt to find a current interpretation. This has led to the establishment of a Facebook page. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

'''Companhia das Letras''' is a [[Brazil]]ian [[Publishing company|publisher]] based in [[São Paulo]], founded in 1986 by Luiz Schwarcz, who had experience working at the publisher Brasiliense, and his wife [[Lilia Moritz Schwarcz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://vogue.globo.com/lifestyle/cultura/noticia/2016/10/dama-de-palavra-lilia-moritz-schwarcz-celebra-30-anos-da-companhia-das-letras.html|title=Dama de palavra: Lilia Moritz Schwarcz celebra 30 anos da Companhia das Letras|work=vogue.globo.com|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Nielsen BookScan]], Companhia das Letras was the second-largest book publisher in Brazil in 2015, with an 8.08% market share.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.editeur.org/files/Events%20pdfs/Supply%20chain%202016/Brazil%20how%20standards%20are%20shaping%20the%20book%20market.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, BookScan named it the largest publisher, with over 5,000 titles and 34 Nobel Prize winners.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thebookseller.com/news/brazilian-publisher-schwarcz-honoured-lbf-lifetime-achievement-award-486971&lt;/ref&gt;

One of its first four books was ''[[To the Finland Station]]'' by [[Edmund Wilson]], a sales success that propelled the publisher. In the first twelve months of existence, it released 48 titles. Three years later, economist and writer [[Instituto Moreira Salles|Fernando Moreira Salles]] joined the project. 

In December 2011, [[Penguin Books]] acquired a 45 percent stake in Companhia das Letras. &lt;ref&gt;http://g1.globo.com/economia/negocios/noticia/2011/12/grupo-penguin-compra-45-da-companhia-das-letras.html  G1 ''Grupo Penguin compra 45% da Companhia das Letras''. Retrieved in December 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2018, [[Penguin Random House]] increased its stake to 70 percent. Moreira Salles exited the partnership, while the Schwarcz family will continue to own 30% of the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/international/international-book-news/article/78463-prh-buys-brazil-s-companhia-das-letras.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The publisher has several divisions, including Objetiva and [[Alfaguara]] (which were acquired from [[Grupo Santillana]]), Companhia das Letrinhas (children's books), Quadrinhos na Cia (graphic novels), and Penguin Companhia (classic literature).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3893">A '''concert party''', also called a '''Pierrot troupe''', is the collective name for a group of entertainers, or [[Pierrot#England 2|Pierrots]], popular in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the first half of the 20th century. The [[variety show]] given by a Pierrot troupe was called a '''Pierrot show'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb029ms225 |title=Papers relating to English concert parties and pierrot shows |publisher=[[Archives Hub]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-end-of-the-pierrot-show-1087139.html |title=Theatre: End of the pierrot show |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=14 April 1999 |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concert parties were travelling shows of songs and comedy, often put on at the seaside and opening with a Pierrot
number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=English filming, English writing |last=Jefferson Hunter |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location= |isbn= |page=226 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbnHvxuby54C&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=A+concert+party,+also+called+a+Pierrot+troupe,&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iM3dTq-xJ4n54QSD28XTBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1891, the singer and banjoist Clifford Essex returned from France, having admired the Pierrots he had seen there, and decided to create a troupe of English Pierrot entertainers. Thus began the tradition of seaside Pierrots in [[pointed hat]]s and black or coloured costumes who sang, danced, juggled, and joked on the piers of [[Brighton]], [[Margate]] and [[Blackpool]] from the 1890s until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;See Pertwee.&lt;/ref&gt; The style of performance attracted artists from [[music hall]] and variety theatre. Some performers, such as [[Neville Kennard]], were known as specialists in the field.

Immensely popular in Great Britain from the 1920s to the 1940s, concert parties were also formed by several countries' [[armed forces]] during the First and [[Second World War]]s. During the Second World War, the British Armed Forces' concert party became known as the [[Entertainments National Service Association]] (ENSA), later succeeded by the [[Combined Services Entertainment]] (CSE).

As other forms of entertainment (particularly [[television]]) replaced variety shows in general, concert parties largely died out during the 1950s. This form of entertainment has been described by [[Roy Hudd]] as long-gone and much lamented.&lt;ref name="Hudd"&gt;Roy Hudd, Philip Hindin, ''Roy Hudd's cavalcade of variety acts: a who was who of light entertainment, 1945-60'', 1997, p94&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous fictitious concert party outside the armed forces was ''[[The Good Companions]]'' in [[J. B. Priestley]]'s eponymous novel. In the novel [[Sylvia Scarlett]], the main characters ([[Cary Grant]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]] in the film version) form a concert party, The Pink Pierrots.

'''''{{Lang|de|Der Kaiser von Atlantis oder Die Tod-Verweigerung}}''''' (''The Emperor of Atlantis or The Disobedience of Death'') is a one-act [[opera]] by [[Viktor Ullmann]] with a [[libretto]] by [[Peter Kien]]. They collaborated on the work while interned in the [[Nazi]] concentration camp of [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] (Terezín) around 1943. The Nazis did not allow it to be performed there.

The world premiere, presented by the [[De Nederlandse Opera|Netherlands Opera]] at the Bellevue Centre, [[Amsterdam]], took place on 16 December 1975. It was conducted by Kerry Woodward using the first performing edition, which he had been actively involved in preparing.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh R.N. Macdonald, "''Der Kaiser von Atlantis''", ''Tempo'' (New Ser.), 116 (1976), 42–3&lt;/ref&gt;

The title is sometimes given as ''{{Lang|de|Der Kaiser von Atlantis, oder Der Tod dankt ab}}'', that is, ''The Emperor of Atlantis, or Death Abdicates'',{{sfn|Karas|1990|p=33}} and described as a "legend in four scenes" rather than an opera.

==Composition history==
About 1943, Ullmann and Kien were inmates at the [[Nazi]] concentration camp of [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] (Terezín) when they collaborated on the opera.&lt;ref name=Kozinn&gt;[[Allan Kozinn]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/24/arts/opera-review-born-in-the-camps-and-still-kicking.html "Born in the Camps And Still Kicking"], ''The New York Times'', 24 November 1994&lt;/ref&gt; It was rehearsed at Theresienstadt in March 1944, but the Nazi authorities interpreted the work's depiction of the character of the [[Kaiser]] as a satire on [[Adolf Hitler]] and did not allow it to be performed.&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"&gt;{{cite journal | title=When Death Went on Strike | author=Michael Haas | journal=[[Jewish Renaissance]] |date=October 2012 | volume=12 | issue=1 | pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the composer and the librettist died in the [[Auschwitz]] concentration camp.

Ullmann entrusted his manuscripts to a fellow-prisoner, Dr. Emil Utitz, a former Professor of Philosophy at the [[Charles University in Prague|German University in Prague]], who served as the camp's librarian. Utitz survived the camp and passed the manuscripts on to another survivor, Dr. Hans Gunther Adler, a friend of Ullmann's, some of whose poems Ullmann had set to music. The score was a working version with edits, substitutions, and alternatives made in the course of rehearsals. Dr. Adler deposited the original manuscripts and two copies of the libretto in his possession at the [[Goetheanum]] in [[Dornach]],&lt;ref name=Graubart /&gt; the center for the [[anthroposophical]] movement with which Ullmann was associated. The manuscripts subsequently passed to the Paul Sacher Stiftung in Basle.

==Performance history==
'''First performing edition'''

Through informal personal connections, the score came to the attention of conductor Kerry Woodward. In the process of preparing a performing edition of the score, Woodward consulted [[Rosemary Brown (spiritualist)|Rosemary Brown]], who was a prominent spiritualist, known for [[mediumship]] with dead composers and for transcribing musical works they dictated. She said she contacted Ullmann and communicated his instructions to Woodward, who incorporated them into his edition. At Brown's direction, Woodward altered the instrumentation of the second part of Death's aria near the end of the opera, substituting strings for harpsichord and adding trumpet and flute.&lt;ref name=Graubart&gt;Michael Graubart, "''The Emperor of Atlantis'': The First British Production", ''Musical Times'', Autumn 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The world premiere was presented by the [[Dutch National Opera]] (DNO) on 16 December 1975 at the {{ill|Theater Bellevue|nl}} in [[Amsterdam]]. In 1976 DNO presented two performances in Brussels and a further four in Spoleto.&lt;ref name=Schonberg&gt;[[Harold C. Schonberg]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1976/06/28/archives/the-opera-two-oneacters-are-sung-in-spoleto-paolino-by-tedeschi-has.html "Two One-Acters Are Sung in Spoleto,"] ''The New York Times'', 28 June 1976, accessed 29 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was recreated in April 1977 by the San Francisco Spring Opera Theater for its American premiere,&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'' (London), 26 April 1977&lt;/ref&gt; and the same group also presented the New York premiere at the Lepercq Space at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] on 19 May 1977. DNO revived their production in Amsterdam in June 1978 and later that year presented five performances in Israel. In 1979 DNO presented two performances at the Nottingham Playhouse, England. All of these performances were conducted by Woodward.&lt;ref name=Porter&gt;Andrew Porter, "A Lecture and a Parable", ''The New Yorker'' 6 June 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rockwell&gt;John Rockwell,[https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/21/archives/new-opera-theater-offering-work-of-argento-and-ullmann.html "New Opera Theater Offering Work of Argento and Ullmann,"] ''The New York Times'', 21 May 1977, accessed 29 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Other performing editions and performances'''

In 1981, Michael Graubart and Nicholas Till prepared an edition based on the manuscripts in Dr. Adler's possession as well as on Woodward's edition, following many of Woodward's choices but preferring the 1943 text to the changes made on the basis of Brown's contribution. That provided the basis for the British premiere at the Studio Theatre of London's [[Morley College]] on 15 May 1981 and for additional performances in May 1985 at the [[Imperial War Museum]].&lt;ref name=Graubart/&gt;

Ingo Schultz worked on the reconstruction of the opera's score between 1992 and 1993 in cooperation with [[Karel Berman]], who rehearsed the role of Death at Terezín, [[Paul Kling]], who was the concertmaster of the chamber-orchestra of the rehearsals at Terezin 1944, and [[Herbert Thomas Mandl]]. [[ARBOS – Company for Music and Theatre|ARBOS – Gesellschaft für Musik und Theater]] (Austria) staged this edition of the opera in Austria, the Czech Republic (including the first performance at the concentration camp of Theresienstadt in 1995), Germany, Sweden, Canada, and the U.S. (including a performance at the [[U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum]]).

[[Tomasz Konina]] directed Polish prapremiere at [[Warsaw Chamber Opera]] in [[Warsaw]] in 2005.

==Critical appreciation==
Descriptions and summaries of Kien's libretto vary widely. [[John Rockwell]] described the opera as a story of "the abdication of death in the face of life's universal horrors."&lt;ref name=Rockwell /&gt; [[Harold C. Schonberg|Harold Schonberg]] thought that "the play is stronger and more interesting than the music....In several spots the Ullmann work almost makes it as an opera."&lt;ref name=Schonberg /&gt; Most summaries report that Death insists that the Emperor be the first to die, but others emphasize the ending in which "miraculously, the Emperor comes to understand his crimes" and "to allow Death to save millions from the agony of life-without-death, he offers himself as Death's first victim."&lt;ref name=Schiff&gt;David Schiff, [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/23/arts/music-a-musical-postcard-from-the-eye-of-the-nazi-storm.html "A Musical Postcard From the Eye of the Nazi Storm,"] ''The New York Times'', 23 March 2003, accessed 29 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, conductor [[James Conlon]], a prominent reviver of works lost in the Holocaust, described the opera as both a political satire and a parable of hope in which the isolated Emperor represents Hitler and the Drummer his confidante Eva Braun. The young lovers and Pierrot embody "the lost world of normal human emotion."&lt;ref name=Schiff /&gt;

Andrew Porter has described the text of the opera:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The plot is no cut-and-dried allegory but an elusive death-welcoming parable about a mad, murderous ruler, possibly redeemed at last, who says farewell to the world in a mock-Faustian vision of a natural paradise no longer spoiled by men; had his dream come true all men would be dead. The Emperor of Atlantis, ruler over much of the world, proclaims universal war and declares that his old ally Death will lead the campaign. Death, offended by the Emperor's presumption, breaks his sabre; henceforth men will not die. Confusion results: a Soldier and a Girl-Soldier from opposite sides sing a love duet instead of fighting; the sick and suffering find no release. Death offers to return to men on one condition&amp;ndash;that the Emperor be the first to die. He accepts and sings his farewell.&lt;ref name=Porter /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Synopsis==
'''Prologue'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longbeachopera.org/index.php/2009-season/emperor-of-atlantis-clever-one "Synopsis: ''The Emperor of Atlantis''"], Long Beach Opera production, 2009, accessed 29 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A voice heard over a loudspeaker sets the scene and presents the characters.

'''Scene 1'''

Harlequin describes his sorry life without laughter or love. Death joins him and together they lament how slowly time passes in their grim environment.
Death belittles Harlequin's wish to die and explains how much more dire his own situation is than that of Harlequin. He lacks respect now that the "old-fashioned craft of dying" has been replaced by "motorized chariots of war" that work him to exhaustion with little satisfaction.

The Drummer announces the latest decree of the Emperor: Everyone will be armed and everyone will fight until there are no survivors. Death denounces the Emperor for usurping his role: "To take men's souls is my job, not his!" He declares that he is on strike and breaks his saber.

'''Scene 2'''

In his palace, the Emperor gives battle orders and monitors the progress of the universal war. He learns of a man who continues to live eighty minutes after being hanged and shot. The Loudspeaker reports that thousands of soldiers are "wrestling with life...doing their best to die" without success. Fearful that his power will not endure without death, the Emperor announces that he has decided to reward his subjects with the gift of eternal life. More honestly, he asks: "Death, where is thy sting? Where is thy victory, Hell?"

'''Scene 3'''

A Soldier and a Maiden (the Bobbed-Hair Girl) confront one another as enemies. Unable to kill each other, their thoughts turn to love. They dream of distant places where kind words exist alongside "meadows filled with color and fragrance." The Drummer attempts to lure them back to battle with the sensual attraction of the call. The Maiden responds: "Now death is dead and so we need to fight no more!" She and the Soldier sing: "Only love can unite us, unite us all together."

'''Scene 4'''

The Emperor continues to oversee his failing realm, where his subjects angrily protest their suspension in limbo between life and death. Harlequin appeals to him, reminding him of his innocent childhood. The Drummer urges the Emperor to maintain his resolve, but the Emperor's memories turn his thoughts from his plans for the annihilation of all. Instead he gazes into a covered mirror and asks: "What do men look like? Am I still a man or just the adding machine of God?"

He pulls away the mirror's cloth and faces the reflection of Death. "Who are you?" he demands. Death describes his role modestly, like that of a gardener "who roots up wilting weeds, life's worn-out fellows." He regrets the pain his strike is causing. When the Emperor asks him to resume his duties, Death proposes a resolution to the crisis: "I'm prepared to make peace, if you are prepared to make a sacrifice: will you be the first one to try out the new death?" After some resistance, the Emperor agrees and the suffering people find release in death once more. The Emperor sings his farewell. In a closing chorus, Death is praised and asked to "teach us to keep your holiest law: Thou shalt not use the name of Death in vain now and forever!"

==Music==
The score comprises 20 short sections and lasts about fifty minutes.&lt;ref name=Porter /&gt; Parts of it are danced and there are long spoken sections.&lt;ref name=Tommasini&gt;[[Anthony Tommasini]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/19/arts/opera-review-from-the-doomed-an-ode-to-life-and-a-warning-not-to-insult-death.html "From the Doomed, an Ode to Life And a Warning Not to Insult Death,"] ''The New York Times'', 19 September 1998, accessed 29 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1943 orchestration is for chamber ensemble and includes such unusual instruments as banjo and harmonium. Alto saxophone and harpsichord also appear. Ullmann used the famous [[Lutheran chorale]] "[[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God|Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott]]" as a melodic motif as well as a theme from the ''Asrael'' symphony of [[Josef Suk (composer)|Josef Suk]]. Critics list among Ullmann's antecedents and influences "the radical young Hindemith"&lt;ref name=Tommasini/&gt; as well as [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. One critic has said Ullmann employed "an omnivorous musical language that draws on both classical and popular styles."&lt;ref name=Kozinn /&gt; The work ends with the chorale to the text "Come, Death, who art our worthy guest."&lt;ref name=Porter /&gt;

The character of Harlequin is sometimes called Pierrot, a different character from the [[commedia dell'arte]]. The classic [[Pierrot]] is moonstruck and a sleepwalker. In the opera, this character is an old man who twice recites poems Kien had written earlier. The first describes a cold and pitiless moon, establishing his identity as Pierrot. Later he sings a lullaby that uses a text Kien wrote as a paraphrase of another lullaby text, one familiar to all his contemporaries in the camp, that had been sung during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Ullmann set it to a catchy melody composed by [[Johann Friedrich Reichardt]] in 1781.&lt;ref name=Kaufmann&gt;Jacobo Kaufmann, [http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=3076 "''The Emperor of Atlantis'' in Terezin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413231157/http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=3076 |date=2013-04-13 }}, ''All About Jewish Theater'' on jewish-theatre.com.

'''[[Dog]]s''' have occupied a powerful place in [[Mesoamerica]]n folklore and myth since at least the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]] right through to modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Burchell 2007, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; A common belief across the Mesoamerican region is that a dog carries the newly deceased across a body of water in the afterlife. Dogs appear in underworld scenes painted on [[Maya ceramics|Maya pottery]] dating to the Classic Period and even earlier than this, in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic]], the people of [[Chupícuaro]] buried dogs with the dead.&lt;ref name="ReadGonz172"&gt;Read &amp; Gonzalez 2000, p.172.&lt;/ref&gt; In the great Classic Period metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]], 14 human bodies were deposited in a cave, most of them children, together with the bodies of three dogs to guide them on their path to the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Heyden 1998, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Xoloitzcuintli]] is a [[hairless dog]] from Mesoamerica. Archaeological evidence has been found in the tombs of the [[Colima]], [[Maya civilization|Mayan]], [[Toltec]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], and [[Aztec]] Indians dating the breed to over 3500 years ago. Long regarded as guardians and protectors, the indigenous peoples believed that the Xolo would safeguard the home from evil spirits as well as intruders. In ancient times the Xolos were often sacrificed and then buried with their owners to act as guide to the soul on its journey to the [[underworld]]. These dogs were considered a great [[delicacy]], and were consumed for sacrificial ceremonies – including marriages and funerals.&lt;ref name="xoloitzcuintliclubofamerica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xoloitzcuintliclubofamerica.org/about_xolos|publisher=xoloitzcuintliclubofamerica.org|title=Xoloitzcuintli Club of America, Inc. - ABOUT XOLOS|accessdate=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many versions of the 20-day cycle of the [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerican calendar]], the tenth day bears the name dog.&lt;ref&gt;Read &amp; Gonzalez 2000, p.170.&lt;/ref&gt; This is ''itzcuintli'' in [[Nahuatl]], the language of the [[Aztecs]], ''tz'i''' in the [[K'iche' language|K'iche' Maya language]] and ''oc'' in [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya]]. Among the [[Mixtec]]s, the tenth day was taken by the [[coyote]], ''ua''.&lt;ref&gt;Burchell 2007, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Maya==

De Young Museum.|Dogs were associated with the deity Xolotl, the god of death. The roundness of the body might suggest its value as food for the posthumous soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]|url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/80206|title= Dog Effigy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum.}}
[[Maya civilization|Maya]] burials from the Classic Period are frequently found with associated animal remains, often dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Garza 1999, p.133.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the ruins of the Classic Maya city of [[Kaminaljuyu]] in [[Guatemala]], a dog was found interred with a sitting skeleton, along with grave goods offered to the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Braswell 2003, p.94.&lt;/ref&gt; The frequent finds of dog skeletons in Classic Maya burials confirms that the belief that dogs guided the souls of the departed on their journey into the underworld already existed at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Garza 1999, p.135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dog is sometimes depicted carrying a torch in the surviving [[Maya codices]], which may be a reference to the Maya tradition that the dog brought fire to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Neumann 1975, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Postclassic [[Popul Vuh]] of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] of highland Guatemala, dogs and turkeys killed the people of the second age in retaliation for the people beating them. The people who escaped this fate were transformed into monkeys.&lt;ref name="ReadGonz172"/&gt; Another account in the Popol Vuh describes the [[Maya Hero Twins|Hero twins]] sacrificing a dog that belonged to the Lords of the Underworld, also known as [[Xibalba]]. After the dog was dead, the Hero Twins brought it back to life. The Lords were so impressed that they asked the twins to sacrifice and resurrect them. In the end, the Hero Twins sacrificed the Lords of Xibalba and did not follow through on bringing them back to life. This made it possible for humans to live on earth. The story linked dogs with renewal and human life. Dogs are associated with death and have the job of leading people into the Underworld. They represent fire and are protectors of the hearth, two components of Maya life.

==The Aztecs and their contemporaries==
In [[Aztec mythology]], the Fourth Sun disappeared in a great flood. A man and a woman survived inside a log and were washed up upon a beach, where they promptly built a fire and roasted some fish. The smoke from the fire upset the stars [[Citlalatonac|Citlallatonac]] and [[Citlalicue]], angering the great god [[Tezcatlipoca]]. In his fury, he severed their heads and stitched them onto their rears, creating the first dogs.&lt;ref name="ReadGonz171"&gt;Read &amp; Gonzalez 2000, p.171.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Xolotl 1.jpg|thumb|left|Xolotl from the 15th century [[Codex Fejervary-Mayer]]]]
Among the Aztecs, the god [[Xolotl]] was a monstrous dog.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández 1992, 1996, p.160&lt;/ref&gt; During the creation of the Fifth Sun, Xolotl was hunted by Death and escaped him by transforming himself first into a sprout of maize, then into [[Agave americana|maguey]] leaves and finally as a salamander in a pool of water. The third time that Death found Xolotl, he trapped and killed him. Three important foodstuffs were produced from the body of this mythological dog.&lt;ref name="ReadGonz171"/&gt; Mictlantecuhtli, Lord of the Dead, had the bones of man in the underworld, kept over from the previous creations. Xolotl descended to the underworld to steal these bones so that man could be reborn in the new creation of the Fifth Sun. Xolotl managed to recover the bones and brought man to life by piercing his penis and bleeding upon them.&lt;ref name="Neumann"&gt;Neumann 1975, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; Xolotl was seen as an incarnation of the planet [[Venus]] as the Evening Star (the Morning Star was his twin brother [[Quetzalcoatl]]). Xolotl was the canine companion of the Sun, following its path through both the sky and the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Read &amp; Gonzalez 2000, pp.171-172.&lt;/ref&gt; Xolotl's strong connection with the underworld, death and the dead is demonstrated by the symbols he bore. In the [[Codex Borbonicus]] Xolotl is pictured with a knife in his mouth, a symbol of death, and has black wavy hair like the hair worn by the gods of death.&lt;ref name="Neumann"/&gt;

The fourteenth 13-day period of the ''[[tonalpohualli]]'' ritual calendar started with the day ''ce itzcuintli'' (1-dog) and people, especially rulers, were fated to be especially lucky if born on this day. The tenth day of the ''[[xiuhpohualli]]'' 20-day agricultural calendar, ''itzcuintli'' (dog), was governed by [[Mictlantecuhtli]], the grim lord of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Matos Moctezuma &amp; Solis Olguín 2002, pp.206, 417.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]], when an Aztec commoner died he had to pass through each of the nine levels of [[Mictlan]], the underworld. Mictlan was only reached after four years of wandering, accompanied by a dog that had been cremated with the deceased. The first level of Mictlan was called [[Apanoayan]] (''where one crosses the river''), this place was also known as [[Itzcuintlan]] (''the Place of Dogs'') because of the many dogs that roamed the near shore. A dog that recognised its former owner would carry him across the river on its back.&lt;ref&gt;Burchell 2008, pp.5, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In some accounts, the dogs on the shore act differently according to their colour, yellow dogs would carry the soul of the deceased across the river, while white dogs refuse because they have just washed themselves and black dogs refuse because either they have just swum the river&lt;ref name="ReadGonz172"/&gt; or because they are dirty.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández 1992, 1996, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

In Aztec folklore, the [[Ahuizotl (creature)|''ahuizotl'']] was a dog-like water monster with a hand on the end of its coiled tail. It was said to dwell underwater near river banks and would drag the unwary to a watery death. The victim's soul would be carried off to [[Tlalocan]], one of the three Aztec paradises.&lt;ref&gt;Burchell 2008, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar belief existed among the neighbouring [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]]s, their dog-god was called [[Uitzimengari]] and he saved the souls of drowned people by carrying them across to the Land of the Dead.&lt;ref name="ReadGonz172"/&gt;

==Modern folklore==
[[File:YoungLaka MexicanHairless.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Xoloitzcuintli]].]]
In modern times, the [[Chinantec]]s and [[Mixe]]s of [[Oaxaca]] believe that a black dog will help the newly dead to cross a body of water, either a river or a sea, to the land of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Pardo &amp; Robledo Hernandez 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torres Cisneros 2004, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Huitzilan]] believe that a dog carries the dead across the water to reach the underworld home of the [[Devil]].&lt;ref name="ReadGonz172"/&gt;

Across much of [[Mexico]], evil sorcerers are believed to be able to transform themselves into a [[Black dog (ghost)|black dog]] in order to prey upon the livestock of their neighbours. In the states of central Mexico (such as Oaxaca, [[Tlaxcala]] and [[Veracruz]]) such a sorcerer is known as a [[Nagual|nahual]], in the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] they go by the name of ''[[huay chivo]]''. Another supernatural dog in the folklore of Yucatan is the ''huay pek'' (witch-dog in Yucatec Maya), an enormous [[Black dog (ghost)|phantom black dog]] that attacks anybody that it meets and is said to be an incarnation of the [[Kakasbal]], an evil spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Burchell 2007, pp.23-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burchell 2008, pp.4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jijena Sánchez 1952, p.108.&lt;/ref&gt;

A folktale from Tlaxcala tells how some hunters saw an enormous black dog one night and decided to capture and keep it. It fled at their approach, so one hunter shot at it, wounding it in one leg. Following the blood trail they came to a richly furnished peasant hut, whose owner was tending a wound in his leg. They gave up the chase and headed for the nearest village, where the locals told them that the peasant had been a ''nahual'' who could transform into a dog to steal riches.&lt;ref&gt;Valadez Azúa &amp; Téllez Estrada 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]] and [[Tzotzil people|Tzotzil Maya]] of highland [[Chiapas]] in Mexico say that a white dog mated with [[Eve]] in the Third Creation, producing [[wikt:Ladino|Ladino]]s, while a yellow dog fathered the indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="ReadGonz171"/&gt;

A [[Jakaltek people|Jakaltek]] tale from the [[Guatemalan Highlands]] relates how the first dog witnessed the creation of the world and ran everywhere telling everyone the secrets of creation. [[Hunab' Kuh]], the Creator-God, was furious and swapped the dog's head for its tail and its tail for its head. Now, whenever a dog wants to talk and give away its secrets, it cannot speak, instead it may only wag its tail.&lt;ref&gt;Montejo 2000, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Egyptian revival decorative arts''' is a style in Western art, mainly of the early nineteenth century, in which Egyptian motifs were applied to a wide variety of [[decorative arts]] objects.

[[File:Sevres Egyptian Service.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The "Egyptian" service of Sèvres porcelain, designed by [[Dominique Vivant]] and given by Napoleon to Czar Alexander I in 1807, on display in the [[Kuskovo|Kuskovo Palace]].]]

Enthusiasm for the artistic style of Ancient Egypt is generally attributed to the excitement over Napoleon's conquest of Egypt and, in Britain, to Admiral Nelson's defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. Napoleon took a scientific expedition with him to Egypt. Publication of the expedition's work, the ''Description de l'Égypte'', began in 1809 and came out in a series though 1826, inspiring everything from sofas with Sphinxes for legs, to tea sets painted with the pyramids. It was the popularity of the style that was new, Egyptianizing works of art had appeared in scattered European settings from the time of the Renaissance.

The Egyptian Gallery, a private room in the [[Duchess Street, London|Duchess Street]] home of connoisseur [[Thomas Hope (1769-1831)|Thomas Hope]] to display his Egyptian antiquities, and illustrated in engravings from his meticulous line drawings in his book,''Household Furniture and Interior Decoration'' (1807), were a prime source for the [[Regency style]] in British furnishings. The book inspired a generation of fashionable English homeowners to install parlor suites featuring chairs, tables and sofas in shapes that evoked the objects depicted on Egyptian tomb paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgc.bard.edu/object_month/090908/oom_090908_column.shtml Thomas Hope: Regency Designer, A Curatorial Interpretation of the Egyptian Room at Duchess Street]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/arts/design/11anti.html When London and Paris Looked to the Nile for Inspiration, Wendy Moonan, July 11, 2008, New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later discoveries prompted small further revivals.

"'''English and Welsh'''" is the title of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s inaugural O'Donnell Memorial Lecture of October 21, 1955. The lecture sheds light on Tolkien's conceptions of the connections of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnicity]], and [[language]].

It was first published in ''Angles and Britons'' in 1963, and then was later republished in ''[[The Monsters and the Critics, and Other Essays]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hammondandscull.com/papers/Hammond_Scull_Scholars_Forum.html|title=Truth or Consequences - Hammond and Scull|website=www.hammondandscull.com|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien begins with an overview of the terms "[[:wikt:British|British]]", "[[:wikt:Celtic|Celtic]]", "[[:wikt:Germanic|Germanic]]", "[[:wikt:Saxon|Saxon]]", "[[:wikt:English|English]]" and "[[:wikt:Welsh|Welsh]]", explaining the latter term's etymology in ''[[walha]]''.

Tolkien also addresses the historical [[language contact]] between [[English language|English]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] since the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain]], including [[Welsh loanwords in English|Welsh loanwords]] and [[Welsh substrate in English|substrate influence]] found in English, and conversely [[:wikt:Appendix:Glossary of Welsh Words of English Origin|English loanwords in Welsh]]. Comparing the Germanic [[i-mutation|''i''-mutation]] and the Celtic [[Affection (linguistics)|affection]], Tolkien says:

{{quotation|The north-west of Europe, in spite of its underlying differences of linguistic heritage – Goidelic, Brittonic, Gallic; its varieties of Germanic; and the powerful intrusion of spoken Latin – is as it were a single [[sprachbund|philological province]], a region so interconnected in race, culture, history, and linguistic fusions that its departmental philologies cannot flourish in isolation.}}

In the final part of the lecture, Tolkien explores the concept of [[phonaesthetics]], citing the phrase ''[[cellar door]]'' as a recognized beautiful-sounding phrase in English, adding that to his own taste, in Welsh "''cellar doors'' are extraordinarily frequent". Tolkien describes the working of phonaesthetics inherent in the moment of association of [[Phonestheme|sound and meaning]]:

{{quote|[T]his pleasure is felt most immediately and acutely in the moment of association: that is in the reception (or imagination) of a word-form which is felt to have a certain style, and the attribution to it of a meaning which is not received through it.}}

Tolkien alludes to his view that such tastes are inherited, "an aspect in linguistic terms of our individual natures. And since these are largely historical products, the predilections must be so too". To refer to such an inherited taste of language, Tolkien introduces the term of "native tongue" as opposed to "cradle tongue".

== Influence ==
Tolkien notes in his lecture that "Most English-speaking people … will admit that 'cellar door' is beautiful, especially if dissociated from its sense and from its spelling. More beautiful than, say, 'sky', and far more beautiful than 'beautiful' … Well then, in Welsh, for me cellar doors are extraordinarily frequent". This heavy interest in and appreciation of Welsh influenced his own languages, notably his elvish languages like [[Sindarin]] and [[Quenya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/z2hthyc|title=Why do the Elves in The Hobbit sound Welsh?|website=BBC Guides|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This lecture is considered Tolkien's "last major learned work".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48194645|title=J.R.R.

A '''fashion week''' is a [[fashion]] industry event, lasting approximately one week, wherein [[fashion designer]]s, brands or "houses" display their latest collections in runway [[fashion show]]s to buyers and the media. These events influence trends for the current and upcoming seasons.

The most prominent fashion weeks are held in the [[fashion capital]]s of the world, with the "Big  Four" receiving the majority of press coverage being [[New York Fashion Week|New York]], [[London Fashion Week|London]], [[Milan Fashion Week|Milan]], and [[Paris Fashion Week|Paris]].

While the fashion scene turns more multipolar in the 21st century, other centers like [[Lakme Fashion Week|Mumbai]], [[Beirut]], [[Berlin Fashion Week|Berlin]], Dubai, [[Los Angeles Fashion Week|Los Angeles]], [[Cibeles Madrid Fashion Week|Madrid]], Monaco, [[Italian fashion#Rome|Rome]], [[São Paulo Fashion Week|São Paulo]], [[Taipei]], [[Shanghai Fashion Week|Shanghai]], [[India Fashion Week|New Delhi]], [[Copenhagen Fashion Week|Copenhagen]], [[Feeric Fashion Week|Sibiu]], [[Jakarta Fashion Week|Jakarta]], and [[Japanese street fashion|Tokyo]] host important fashion weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.fashiondays.com/the-daily-issue/the-big-four-fashion-capitals-of-the-world/|title=The big four fashion capitals of the world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paris fashion parades ==
The concept of fashion week ([[:fr:Semaine des défilés|Semaine des défilés (fr)]]) began in Paris, when marketers would hire women to wear couture items in public places, from racetracks to salons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fashionista.com/2016/09/fashion-week-history|title=Fashion History Lesson: The Evolution of Runway Shows|work=Fashionista|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These parades (parade is "défilé in French) gradually began to become social events of their own. (Indeed, in French, runways shows are still called "défilés de mode" -- literally "fashion parades" -- today.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fashionweekonline.com/history-of-fashion-week|title=History of Fashion Week {{!}} Fashion Week Online|work=Fashion Week Online|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Paris fashion week began in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410233646/http://www.lesinrocks.com:80/inrocks.tv/petite-histoire-de-la-fashion-week-en-2-minutes/|title=Petite histoire de la Fashion Week en 2 minutes - Les Inrocks|author=|date=10 April 2017|website=archive.org|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New York and the first "fashion week" ==

In 1903, a New York City shop called Ehrich Brothers put on what is thought to have been the country’s first fashion show to lure middle-class women into the store.&lt;ref&gt;Leach, William R. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1901758 "Transformations in a Culture of Consumption: Women and Department Stores, 1890-1925"]. '''The Journal of American History'''. Vol. 71, No. 2 (Sep., 1984), pp. 319-342. Accessed August 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1910, many big [[department store]]s were holding shows of their own. It is likely that American retailers saw  what were called "fashion parades" in [[haute couture|couture]] salons, and decided to use the idea. These "parades" were an effective way to promote stores, and improved their status. By the 1920s, the fashion show had been used by retailers up and down the country. They were staged, and often held in the shop’s restaurant during lunch or teatime. These shows were usually more  theatrical than those of today, heavily based upon a single theme, and accompanied with a narrative commentary. The shows were hugely popular, enticing crowds in their thousands – crowds so large, that stores in New York in the fifties had to obtain a license to have live [[Model (person)|model]]s.

In 1943, the first-ever "fashion week," [[New York Fashion Week]], was held, with one main purpose: to give fashion buyers alternatives to [[French fashion]] during [[World War II]], when workers in the fashion industry were unable to travel to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/fashion/2006/02/how_the_runway_took_off.html Amanda Fortini, "How the Runway Took Off. A brief history of the fashion show." Feb. 8 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  Until 1994, shows were held in different locations, such as hotels, or lofts. From 1994 to 2009, the event was held in a tent at [[Bryant Park]], behind the New York Public Library.  [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] was the Fashion Week venue from 2010 to 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/new-york-fashion-week-lincoln-center-10108237|title=New York Fashion Week Leaves Lincoln Center|last=Lockwood|first=Lisa|date=2015-04-13|work=WWD|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which it moved to Clarkson Square, an events venue in [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2017/09/12/hudson-yards-is-in-talks-to-host-new-york-fashion-week/|title=Hudson Yards is in talks to host New York Fashion Week|date=2017-09-12|work=New York Post|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Big Four" fashion weeks==

Although there are many notable fashion weeks around the world, only four are known as the "Big Four": Paris, Milan, London and New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newyorkfashionweeklive.com/the-long-and-winding-history-of-fashion-week|title=The Long and Winding History of Fashion Week {{!}} New York Fashion Week|website=New York Fashion Week|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/13322973/vogue-runway-app-fashion-shows-iphone-ipad-new-york-london-milan-paris/|title=Introducing the New Vogue Runway App: Your Digital Front Row Seat to Fashion Week|last=Ward|first=Maria|website=Vogue|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/03/style/03iht-Rweeks.3015966.html?_r=0|title=Big 4 fashion weeks get new company - Style - International Herald Tribune - The New York Times|last=Emling|first=Shelley|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paris began holding couture shows in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.harpersbazaar.co.uk/fashion/fashion-news/the-history-of-haute-couture|title=The history of haute couture|date=2017-01-19|work=Harper's BAZAAR|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milan Fashion Week was founded by the Italian Chamber of Commerce in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/nov/21/giorgio-armani-revival-milan-fashion-week|title=Armani throws his weight behind efforts to revive Milan fashion week|last=Davies|first=Lizzy|date=2013-11-21|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paris Fashion Week was further organized in 1973 under the French Fashion Federation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/blogs/547376/paris-fashion-week-best-ever-moments-archive.html|title=Paris Fashion Week's Best Moments: Revisit 14 Iconic Catwalk Shows|date=2016-10-10|work=Marie Claire|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and London Fashion Week was founded by the British Fashion Council in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG6194975/25-years-of-London-Fashion-Week.html|title=25 years of London Fashion Week - Telegraph|website=fashion.telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although these key organizations still organize the main shows, there are independent events and producers in all cities, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newyorkfashionweeklive.com/the-long-and-winding-history-of-fashion-week|title=The Long and Winding History of Fashion Week {{!}} New York Fashion Week|date=2015-09-23|work=New York Fashion Week|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are primarily two kinds of shows: womenswear and menswear. There are also shows particular to each location. For example, most haute couture shows are held in Paris, while most bridal shows are held in New York.

Paris' [[haute couture]] shows take place in Paris in January and July. (Due to rules set down by the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture, [[haute couture]] can only be shown in Paris.)


More and more designers have shown inter-seasonal collections between the traditional Autumn/Winter and Spring/Summer seasons. These collections are usually more commercial than the main season collections and help shorten the customer's wait for new season clothes. The inter-seasonal collections are Resort/Cruise (before Spring/Summer) and Pre-Fall (before Autumn/Winter). There is no fixed schedule for these shows in any of the major fashion capitals but they typically happen three months after the main season shows. Some designers show their inter-seasonal collections outside their home city. For example, [[Karl Lagerfeld]] has shown his Resort and Pre-Fall collections for [[Chanel]] in cities such as Moscow, Los Angeles, and Monte Carlo instead of Paris. Many designers also put on presentations as opposed to traditional shows during Resort and Pre-Fall either to cut down costs or because they feel the clothes can be better understood in this medium.

Some fashion weeks can be genre-specific, such as  Miami Fashion Week (swimwear), Rio Summer (swimwear),  the [[haute couture]] shows in Paris (one-of-a-kind designer originals), Indonesia Islamic Fashion Week (Moslem Fashion), Festive Wear at [[Bangalore Fashion Week]] and [[Wedding dress|Bridal]] Fashion Week, while Portland (Oregon, USA) Fashion Week shows some eco-friendly designers. [[Bread and Butter tradeshow|Bread and Butter Berlin]] hosts the leading fashion show for everyday fashion.

== Timing of the events ==
[[File:Crystal Couture Fashion Show &amp; Sale (32830707491).jpg|thumb|300px|Male and female [[model (person)|models]] on [[runway (fashion)|runway]] at a [[fashion show]] in [[Washington DC]], February 2017]]

Fashion week happens twice a year in the major fashion capitals of the world: New York, London, Milan, and Paris (in that order). 

Traditionally, fashion weeks were held several months in advance of the season to allow the press and buyers a chance to preview fashion designs for the following season. In February and March, designers showcased their autumn and winter collections. In September and October, designers showcased their spring and summer collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fashionweekonline.com/when-is-fashion-week|title=When Is Fashion Week? {{!}} Fashion Week Online|work=Fashion Week Online|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This timing was largely created to follow the (then slower) "retail cycle." In other words, it allowed time for retailers to purchase and incorporate the designers into their retail marketing. 

However, as customer expectations have increased, the retail cycle has increased. As a result, in 2016, designers started moving to "in-season shows."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fashionista.com/2016/04/cfda-in-season-guidebook|title=The CFDA Released a Guidebook for Designers Transitioning to In-Season Shows|work=Fashionista|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, shows have begun to feature garments that are available for sale immediately, online or in stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/tom-ford-shifts-show-to-match-retail-cycle|title=Tom Ford Shifts Show to Match Retail Cycle|date=2016-02-05|work=The Business of Fashion|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fashionweekonline.com/when-is-fashion-week|title=When Is Fashion Week? {{!}} Fashion Week Online|work=Fashion Week Online|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other move has been to "see now, buy now" shows, often featuring clickable video, where looks are available online immediately following, or even during the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elle.com/fashion/news/a39217/see-now-buy-now-fashion-week/|title=8 Collections You Can Shop Straight From the Runway|date=2016-09-15|work=ELLE|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; "See now, buy now" experiences have included shows from Tom Ford, Nicole Miller, and TOMMY.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fashionweekonline.com/shop|title=Fashion Week Shopping {{!}} Fashion Week Online|work=Fashion Week Online|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of "see now, buy now" shopping has also come about in response to so-called "fast fashion" retailers, who copy designs from the runway and bring them to retail faster than traditional design houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.refinery29.com/2016/02/103452/trends-fast-fashion-2016|title=Fashion Week Trends Fast Fashion 2016|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fashionista.com/2016/06/what-is-fast-fashion|title=Fashion History Lesson: The Origins of Fast Fashion|work=Fashionista|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/new-report-proves-unanimous-agreement-time-ripe-change-fashion-industry/|title=Fast Fashion Spurs Need for Change in Fashion Industry|date=2016-03-07|work=The BigCommerce Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the call to rethink the runways, so far the French Federation of Fashion ([[Fédération française de la couture]]) has opposed the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fashionista.com/2016/02/see-now-buy-now-paris|title=French Fashion Execs Vote Against 'See Now, Buy Now' Schedule|work=Fashionista|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''house dish''' is a very large wooden [[dishware|dish]], often ornately carved and painted in various human or animal figures, used in [[First Nations]] ceremonies in [[British Columbia]]. House dishes may be reserved only for special foodstuffs and not used for more common fare.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3888">'''Independent Studio Services''' or '''ISS''' is a [[theatrical property|prop]] supplier for [[television]] and [[film]] production studios. Props provided by ISS have been used in numerous motion pictures and [[television program]]s. ISS was founded in 1977 by Gregg Bilson, Sr., and is currently based in [[Sunland-Tujunga, Los Angeles|Sunland, California]] with satellite branches in [[New Mexico]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Louisiana]], [[Michigan]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |work=Independent Studio Services| title=About Us|url=http://www.issprops.com/AboutUs.aspx |date=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banknotes==
ISS provided prop [[banknote]]s for the film ''[[Rush Hour 2]],'' which starred [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Chris Tucker]]. The film's plot involved the production of high quality [[counterfeit United States currency]], known as "superbills," by [[Hong Kong]]-based [[triad (underground societies)|triads]] which [[money laundering|laundered]] them through a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] [[casino]]. While filming in Las Vegas, prop banknotes with a [[face value]] of $1 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] [[United States dollar|USD]] were blown up; unfortunately, the explosion failed to destroy all the banknotes. Many were scattered through the air, and picked up by bystanders. The prop banknotes were found in Las Vegas, [[Los Angeles]], and as far away as [[Minneapolis]]. Horrified, the [[United States Secret Service]] ordered ISS to stop producing the banknotes, recalled the banknotes from every production company that had ordered them, and seized banknotes from the company's location in [[Sun Valley, Los Angeles, California|Sun Valley, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/07/us/national-briefing-west-california-crackdown-on-fake-cash.html|title=Crackdown On Fake Cash|date=June 7, 2001|publisher=New York Times|page=A20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reed|first=Fred|title=Show Me the Money!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9368">This page provides a '''list of oldest brands and companies operating only in the eyewear manufacturing business''' to date and in any country. ''"[[Eyewear]]"'', although being a relative modern terminology, refers to the category of all items and accessories worn over the eyes for fashion adornment, protection against the environment and medical issues, which include glasses (also called eyeglasses or spectacles) and sunglasses. To be listed, a [[brand]] or [[company]] name must manufacture and sell its own eyewear products and remain operating, either in whole or in part, since inception. Generic optical stores, retailers and factories are not included in the list.

A [[sex symbol]] is a [[celebrity]] of either sex, typically an [[actor]] or [[actress]], [[musician]], [[supermodel]], [[teen idol]], [[sports star]], or even a [[politician]], noted for being widely regarded as [[Sexual attraction|sexually attractive]]. The term was first used in the mid-1950s in relation to the popularity of certain film stars, including [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Brigitte Bardot]], [[Marlon Brando]], and [[Raquel Welch]].&lt;ref name=Flexner&gt;{{cite book |title=Speaking freely: a guided tour of American English from Plymouth Rock to Silicon Valley |first=Stuart Berg |last=Flexner |author-link=Stuart Berg Flexner |first2=Anne H. |last2=Soukhanov |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1997 |page=373 |isbn=978-0-19-510692-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FlANAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''McGuffey Readers''' were a series of [[graded reader|graded]] [[primer (textbook)|primer]]s for grade levels 1-6. They were widely used as [[textbooks]] in American schools from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century, and are still used today in some [[private school]]s and in [[homeschooling]].

It is estimated that at least 120 million copies of McGuffey's Readers were sold between 1836 and 1960, placing its sales in a category with the [[Bible]] and ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;{{cite news|authors=The [[National Park Service]] and the [[United States Department of Interior]]|url=http://www.nps.gov/jeff/historyculture/upload/mcguffey.pdf |title=William Holmes McGuffey and His Readers|work=The Museum Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1961, they have continued to sell at a rate of some 30,000 copies a year.&lt;ref name="nps"/&gt; Only the ''Ray's Arithmetic'' series (1834-1913) matched it in popularity, written by a colleague of McGuffey's and begun in 1834.&lt;ref name="nps"/&gt;
==McGuffey==

The editor of the Readers was [[William Holmes McGuffey]]. He was born September 23, 1800 near [[Claysville, Pennsylvania]] and moved to [[Youngstown, Ohio]] with his parents in 1802. McGuffey's family had emigrated to America from [[Scotland]] in 1774, and they had strong opinions on religion and a belief in education. Consequently, education and preaching the Gospel were McGuffey's passions. He had a remarkable ability to memorize and could commit to memory entire books of the [[Bible]]. 

McGuffey became a "roving" teacher at the age of 14, beginning with 48 students in a one-room school in [[Calcutta, Ohio]] and at a seminary in the town of [[Poland, Ohio]]. The size of the class was just one of several challenges which the young McGuffey faced. In many one-teacher schools, students' ages varied from six to 21. McGuffey often worked 11 hours a day, six days a week, in a succession of frontier schools, primarily in the state of [[Kentucky]]. Students brought their own books, most frequently the Bible, since few textbooks existed.

Between teaching jobs, McGuffey received a classical education at the [[Greersburg Academy]] (also called The Old Stone Academy) in [[Darlington, Pennsylvania]].  He went on to study at Washington College (now [[Washington &amp; Jefferson College]]) where he graduated in 1826. That same year, he was appointed to a position as Professor of Languages at [[Miami University]] in [[Oxford, Ohio]].

McGuffey became famous as the author of the Readers (more accurately the editor), but he wrote few other works. He left Miami University for positions of successively greater responsibility at [[Cincinnati College]], [[Ohio University]] in [[Athens, Ohio]], and [[Woodward High School (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Woodward College]] in Cincinnati, where he served as president. He ended his career as a Professor of Moral Philosophy at the [[University of Virginia]].

===Personal life===
In 1827, McGuffey married Harriet Spinning, and the couple eventually had five children. He was known for his [[philanthropy]] and generosity among the poor and newly emancipated [[African American]]s through the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and following years. He died in 1873.

==Publication==
McGuffey established a reputation as a lecturer on moral and biblical subjects while he was teaching at [[Miami University]]. In 1835, the small [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] publishing firm of Truman and Smith asked him to create a series of four graded readers for primary level students. He had been recommended for the job by longtime friend [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. He completed the first two readers within a year of signing his contract, receiving a fee of $1,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000|1836|r=-4}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} dollars). He compiled the first four readers (1836-1837 edition), while the fifth and sixth were created by his brother Alexander during the 1840s. The series consisted of stories, poems, essays, and speeches. The advanced Readers contained excerpts from the works of well-regarded English and American writers and politicians such as [[Lord Byron]], [[John Milton]], and [[Daniel Webster]].

Most schools of the 19th century used only the first two in the series of McGuffey's four readers. The first Reader taught reading by using the [[phonics]] method, the identification of letters and their arrangement into words, and aided with [[Writing slate|slate]] work. The second Reader was used once students could read.  It helped them to understand the meaning of sentences, while providing vivid stories which children could remember. The third Reader taught the definitions of words and was written at a level equivalent to the modern 5th or 6th grade. The fourth Reader was written for the highest levels of ability on the grammar school level.

McGuffey's Readers were among the first textbooks in the United States designed to be increasingly challenging with each volume. They used word repetition in the text as a learning tool, developing reading skills by challenging students using the books. Sounding-out, enunciation, and accents were emphasized. Colonial-era texts had offered dull lists of 20 to 100 new words per page for memorization. In contrast, McGuffey used new vocabulary words in the context of real literature, gradually introducing new words and carefully repeating the old.

McGuffey believed that teachers, as well as their students, should study the lessons and suggested that they read aloud to their classes. He also listed questions after each story, for he believed that asking questions was critical for a teacher to give instruction.  The Readers emphasized spelling, vocabulary, and formal public speaking, which was a more common requirement in 19th-century America than today.

McGuffey is remembered as a conservative theological teacher. He interpreted the goals of public schooling in terms of moral and spiritual education, and attempted to give schools a curriculum that would instill [[Presbyterian]] [[Calvinist]] beliefs and manners in their students. These goals were considered suitable for the relatively homogeneous America of the early- to mid-19th century, though they were less so for the increasingly pluralistic society that developed in the late 19th century and early 20th century. 

The content of the readers changed drastically between McGuffey's 1836-1837 edition and the 1879 edition. The revised Readers were compiled to meet the needs of national unity and the dream of an American [[melting pot]] for the world's oppressed masses. The [[Calvinist]] values of salvation, righteousness, and piety were excluded from the later versions, though they had been prominent in the early Readers. The content of the books was secularized and replaced by middle-class [[civil religion]], morality, and values. McGuffey's name was featured on these revised editions, yet he neither contributed to them nor approved their content.

Other types of schoolbooks gradually replaced McGuffey's in the academic marketplace. The desire for distinct grade levels and less overtly religious content, and the greater profitability of consumable workbooks all helped to bring about their decline. McGuffey's Readers never entirely disappeared, however.  Reprinted versions of his Readers are still in print, and may be purchased in bookstores across the country. Today, McGuffey's Readers are popular among homeschoolers and in some Protestant religious schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Smith, S.J. |url=http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1118&amp;context=educ_fac_pubs&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dmcguffey%2520readers%25201836%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D11%26ved%3D0CEAQFjAAOAo%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fdigitalcommons.liberty.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1118%2526context%253Deduc_fac_pubs%26ei%3DYLKsToDNDovKiQK4xbilCw%26usg%3DAFQjCNF5fBtUGFzyogMOEmykb3rPkcjMJQ#search=%22mcguffey%20readers%201836%22|title= McGuffey Readers|work=Liberty University|date= 2008|accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Ron Powers notes that the Readers affected the first mass-educated and 
mass-literate generation in the modern world. 
 
[[File:McGuffey Reader Set.png|thumb|Henry Ford's childhood set of McGuffey's Readers]]
The manufacturer [[Henry Ford]] cited McGuffey's Readers as one of his most important childhood influences. He was an avid fan of McGuffey's Readers first editions, and claimed as an adult to be able to quote from McGuffey's by memory at great length. Ford republished all six Readers from the 1867 edition and distributed complete sets of them, at his own expense, to schools across the United States. In 1934, Ford had the log cabin where McGuffey was born moved to [[Greenfield Village]], Ford's museum of [[Americana]] at [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. In 1936, Ford was an associate editor (along with [[Hamlin Garland]], [[John W. Studebaker]] and [[William F. Wiley]]) of a collection of excerpts from McGuffey Readers. This 482-page compendium was dedicated to Ford, "lifelong devotee of his boyhood Alma Mater, the McGuffey Readers".

American composer [[Burrill Phillips]] composed a work entitled ''Selections from McGuffey's Reader'', for orchestra, based on poems by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]]  It was completed in 1933.

'''Melanchlaeni''' ({{lang|grc|Μελαγχλαῖνοι}}, meaning "black-cloaks"), may refer to three ancient tribes.

The first was a nomad tribe, the name of which first appears in [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]] (''ap.'' [[Stephanus of Byzantium|Steph. B.]], Fr. 154, ed. Klausen). In the geography of [[Herodotus]] (iv. 20,100--103,107) they are found occupying the districts east of the [[Androphagi]], and north of the [[Scythians|Royal Scythians]], 20 days' journey from the ''[[Palus Maeotis]]''; over above them were lakes and lands unknown to man. It has been conjectured that Herodotus may refer, through some hearsay statement, to the lakes [[Lake Ladoga|Ladoga]] and [[Lake Onega|Onega]]. There has been considerable discussion among geographers as to the position which should be assigned to this tribe: it is of course impossible to fix this with any accuracy; but there would seem to be reason to place them as far north as the sources of the [[Volga]], or even further. (Schafarik, Slav. Alt. vol. i. p. 295.) Herodotus expressly says that they did not belong to the Scythian-Scolotic stock, although their customs were the same. The name, the Black-cloaks, like that of their cannibal neighbours, the ''Anthropophagi'', was applied to them by the Greeks, and was not a corrupted form of any indigenous appellation. 

The second people bearing this name is mentioned by [[Scylax of Caryanda]] (p. 32) as a tribe of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]. [[Pomponius Mela]] (i. 19. § 4) and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (vi. 5) coincide with Scylax, who speaks of two rivers flowing through their territory, the Metasoris (Μετάσωρις), probably the same as the Thessyris (Θέσσυρις, Ptol. v. 9. § § 10, 30: Kamisiliar), and the Aegipius (Αἰγίπιος: Kentichli). [[Dionysius Periegetes]] (v. 309) places this people (or perhaps confuses the prior) on the [[Borysthenes]], and [[Ptolemy]] (v. 9. § 19) between the river Rha and the ''Hippici Montes'', in Asiatic [[Sarmatia]]; but it would be a great error to found any observation concerning these ancient northern tribes upon either the Roman writers or Ptolemy, or to confuse the picture set before us by these geographers, and the more correct delineations of Herodotus. 

The third people were the Melanchlaeni of [[Ammianus]] (xxii. 8. § 31), which were the [[Alani]].

{{italic title}}
'''''Memento Mori''''' (1993) is a composition for orchestra by [[Peter Sculthorpe]]. The title refers to the medieval Christian idea of ''[[memento mori]]'', and the piece itself makes frequent references to the plainchant setting of the [[Latin]] [[hymn]] "[[Dies irae]]".&lt;ref name=faber2322&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fabermusic.com/repertoire/memento-mori-2322|title=''Memento Mori''|website=www.fabermusic.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conception ==
Laurie Strachan wrote in [[The Australian]], when reviewing the piece on October 22, 1993, that "[t]he work was inspired by a visit to [[Easter Island]], famous for its great stone [[Moai|heads]], monuments that can be seen as both an example of the indomitable nature of the human spirit and as part of its great folly - for their making and transportation deforested and impoverished the island."&lt;ref name=faber1085&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fabermusic.com/news/memento-mori-reviews-1085|title=''Memento Mori''' reviews|website=www.fabermusic.com|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When composing, ''Memento Mori'', Sculthorpe focused on the link between 'the personal notion of morality' and the 'extended environmental sense of fragility', using 'Easter Island as a parable for planet Earth and [[Human overpopulation|population growth]]'.&lt;ref name="musicalcriticism.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicalcriticism.com/concerts/eif10-sso-mackerras-0910.shtml|title=The Sydney symphony Orchestra and Vladimir Ashkenazy pay tribute to Charles Mackerras at the Edinburgh Festival - MusicalCriticism.com (Concert review)|website=www.musicalcriticism.com|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/features/peter-sculthorpe-the-sound-of-home/|title=Peter Sculthorpe: The Sound Of Home|work=[[Limelight (magazine)|Limelight]]|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moais, Isla de Pascua. - panoramio.jpg|thumb|242x242px|[[Moai]] at [[Rano Raraku]], Easter Island; a visit to Easter Island was where the composer gained inspiration for the composition.]]

In the original programme notes, the composer described the way he conceived of the work:
{{Quotation|It seems that on Easter Island, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, there was a population explosion. The inhabitants stripped the island of trees, causing soil erosion and depriving themselves of building materials for boats and housing. Retreating to caves, clans fought each other, and finally there was enslavement and cannibalization. By the time the first Europeans arrived, in 1722, the survivors had even forgotten the significance of the great stone heads that still stand there.&lt;p&gt; 
Easter Island is a memento mori (literally, "remember to die") for this planet. The concern of this work, therefore, is not with what happened to the inhabitants of Easter Island, but with what could happen to all of us, with what could happen to the human race.|Peter Sculthorpe|&lt;ref name=faber2322 /&gt;}}

== Reception ==
The work has received mixed reviews. Joseph McLellan, writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', stated that:
{{Quotation|It is a piece imbued with a religious aura, rooted in a particular landscape - barren, mysterious Easter Island, with its enormous, brooding, enigmatic statues.  And it is full of tunes, most notably the ancient plainchant Dies irae, which has been used by many classical composers but seldom with the blend of reverence and coloristic effectiveness Sculthorpe has achieved … It was marvelously effective music, innovative in sound but listener-friendly.|Joseph McLellan|&lt;ref name=faber1085 /&gt;}}Laurie Strachan, writing in The Australian, was similarly positive, writing that ''Memento Mori'' was 'one of [Sculthorpe's] most immediately appealing scores.'&lt;ref name=faber1085 /&gt; Strachan went on further to say that '[t]here are some hauntingly beautiful melodies and striking tonal contrasts. Some play is made of the plainchant ''Dies irae'' but this is not overdone and the whole thing ends on a note of quiet resolution that's absolutely right.’&lt;ref name=faber1085 /&gt;

Conversely, Andrew Clements, while reviewing a CD of Sculthorpe's work for ''[[The Guardian]]'', said that the ''Memento Mori'' was "the most conventional and least effective piece on [the] disc".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/jan/07/classicalmusicandopera.shopping|title=CD: Sculthorpe: Earth Cry; Memento Mori; Kakadu; Piano Concerto; From Oceania|last=Clements|first=Andrew|date=2005-01-07|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instrumentation ==
The music is scored for two [[flute]]s (flute 2 doubling [[piccolo]]), two [[clarinet]]s, two [[oboe]]s, two [[bassoon]]s, four [[French horn|horns]], four [[trumpet]]s, two [[trombone]]s, [[bass trombone]], [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] (two players), and [[String instrument|strings]].&lt;ref name=AMC7572&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.australianmusiccentre.com.au/workversion/sculthorpe-peter-memento-mori/7572|title=''Memento Mori'' : for orchestra by Peter Sculthorpe|website=www.australianmusiccentre.com.au|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Form ==
''Memento Mori'' is in one movement and last for approximately 14 minutes.&lt;ref name=faber2322 /&gt; It is in common time and the tempo is lento.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://awscdn.australianmusiccentre.com.au/documents/ds_7795_4241.pdf|title=Sample of the score of ''Memento Mori''|last=|first=|date=|website=Australian Music Centre|access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece opens with an introduction, which them leads into two statements of the ''Dies irae'' plainchant, part of the Latin mass for the dead:

[[File:Dies_Irae_Treble.JPG|frameless|687x687px]]

Following this, the music oscillates between the pitches of G and A-flat. The composer notes that this is because the astronomer [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] believed those pitches to be the sound of the planet Earth.&lt;ref name="faber2322" /&gt; Then there a further two statements of the ''Dies irae'' plainchant, by which the music reaches a solemn climax, followed by more somber music.&lt;ref name="musicalcriticism.com" /&gt;

== Commission and performance ==
The work was commissioned by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] for performance by [[West Australian Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref name=AMC7572 /&gt; It was first performed by the West Australian Symphony Orchestra, with [[Jorge Mester]] conducting, on July 2, 1993, in the [[Perth Concert Hall (Western Australia)|Perth Concert Hall]].&lt;ref name=AMC7572 /&gt;&lt;ref name=faber2322 /&gt; It has subsequently been performed several times, most recently by the Queensland Conservatorium Symphony Orchestra, with Peter Morris conducting, on March 27, 2015.&lt;ref name=AMC7572 /&gt;

{{Monarchism |expanded=concepts}}
A '''monarch''' is a [[potentate|sovereign]] [[head of state]] in a [[monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=monarch | website=Oxford Dictionaries | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/monarch?q=monarch | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;Webster's II New College Dictionary. [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/monarch?q=monarch Monarch]. Houghton Mifflin. Boston. 2001. p. 707. {{ISBN|0-395-96214-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A monarch may exercise the highest authority and power in the [[Sovereign state|state]], or others may wield that power on behalf of the monarch. Typically a monarch either personally [[inheritance|inherits]] the lawful right to exercise the state's sovereign rights (often referred to as ''the throne'' or ''[[the Crown|the crown]]'') or is [[elective monarchy|selected]] by an established process from a family or cohort eligible to provide the nation's monarch. Alternatively, an individual may become monarch by conquest, [[acclamation]] or a combination of means. A monarch usually reigns [[Life tenure|for life]] or until [[abdication]].

If a young child is crowned the monarch, a [[regent]] is often appointed to govern until the monarch reaches the requisite adult age to rule. Monarchs' actual powers vary from one monarchy to another and in different eras; on one extreme, they may be [[autocracy|autocrats]] ([[absolute monarchy]]) wielding genuine sovereignty; on the other they may be [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] [[head of state|heads of state]] who exercise little or no direct power or only [[reserve power]]s, with actual [[authority]] vested in a [[parliament]] or other body ([[constitutional monarchy]]).

A monarch can reign in multiple monarchies simultaneously. For example, the [[monarchy of Canada]] and the [[monarchy of the United Kingdom]] are separate states, but they share the same monarch through [[personal union]].

==Characteristics==
Monarchs, as such, bear a variety of titles – [[king]] or [[Queen regnant|queen]], [[prince]] or [[princess]] (e.g., [[Sovereign Prince of Monaco]]), [[emperor]] or [[Emperor|empress]] (e.g., [[Emperor of China]], [[Emperor of Ethiopia]], [[Emperor of Japan]], [[Emperor of India]]), [[archduke]], [[duke]] or [[grand duke]] (e.g., [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]), [[emir]] (e.g., [[Emir of Qatar]]) or [[sultan]] (e.g., [[Sultan of Oman]]). ''Prince'' is sometimes used as a generic term to refer to any monarch regardless of title, especially in older texts.&lt;ref name="pine"&gt;{{cite book | title=Titles: How the King became His Majesty | publisher=Barnes  &amp; Noble | author=[[L.G. Pine|Pine, L.G.]] | year=1992 | location=New York | page=86 | isbn=978-1-56619-085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A king can also be a queen's husband and a queen can be a king's wife. If both of the couple reign, neither person is generally considered to be a consort. {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Monarchy]] is political or sociocultural in nature, and is generally (but not always) associated with [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary rule]]. Most monarchs, both historically and in the present day, have been born and brought up within a [[royal family]] (whose rule over a period of time is referred to as a [[dynasty]]) and trained for future duties. Different systems of [[Order of succession|succession]] have been used, such as [[proximity of blood]] (male preference or absolute), [[primogeniture]], [[agnatic seniority]], [[Salic law]], etc. While traditionally most monarchs have been male, female monarchs have also ruled, and the term [[queen regnant]] refers to a ruling monarch, as distinct from a [[queen consort]], the wife of a reigning king.

Some monarchies are non-hereditary. In an [[elective monarchy]], the monarch is [[election|elected]] but otherwise serves as any other monarch. Historical examples of elective monarchy include the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s (chosen by [[prince-elector]]s, but often coming from the same dynasty) and the [[royal elections in Poland|free election]] of kings of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Modern examples include the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]], who is appointed by the [[Conference of Rulers]] every five years or after the king's death, and the [[pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], who serves as sovereign of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]] and is elected to a life term by the [[College of Cardinals]].

In recent centuries, many states have abolished the monarchy and become [[republic]]s (however see, e.g., [[United Arab Emirates#Government and politics|United Arab Emirates]]). Advocacy of government by a republic is called [[republicanism]], while advocacy of monarchy is called [[monarchism]]. A principal advantage of hereditary monarchy is the immediate continuity of national leadership, as illustrated in the classic phrase "[[:The King is dead. Long live the King.|The [old] King is dead. Long live the [new] King!]]". In cases where the monarch serves mostly as a ceremonial figure (e.g. most modern constitutional monarchies) real leadership does not depend on the monarch.

A form of government may in fact be hereditary without being considered monarchy, such as a [[family dictatorship]].

Monarchies take a wide variety of forms, such as the two [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|co-princes of Andorra]], positions held simultaneously by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Urgel (Spain) and the elected [[President of France]] (although strictly Andorra is a [[diarchy]]). Similarly, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]] is considered a monarch despite only holding the position for five years at a time.

Hereditary succession within one [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] family has been most common (although, see the [[Rain Queen]]), with preference for children over siblings, sons over daughters. In Europe, some peoples practiced equal division of land and regalian rights among sons or brothers, as in the Germanic states of the Holy Roman Empire, until after the [[medieval era]] and sometimes (e.g., [[Ernestine duchies]]) into the 19th century. Other European realms practice one form or another of [[primogeniture]], whereunder a [[lord]] was succeeded by his eldest son or, if he had none, by his brother, his daughters or sons of daughters.

The system of [[tanistry]] was semi-elective and gave weight also to ability and merit.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The [[Salic law]], practiced in France and in the Italian territories of the [[House of Savoy]], stipulated that only men could inherit the crown. In most [[fief]]s, in the event of the demise of all legitimate male members of the [[patrilineality|patrilineage]], a female of the family could succeed (semi-Salic law). In most realms, daughters and sisters were eligible to succeed a ruling kinsman before more distant male relatives (male-preference primogeniture), but sometimes the husband of the heiress became the ruler, and most often also received the title, ''[[jure uxoris]]''. Spain today continues this model of succession law, in the form of [[cognatic primogeniture]]. In more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting principles of [[proximity of blood|proximity]] and [[primogeniture]] battled, and outcomes were often idiosyncratic.

As the average life span increased, an eldest son was more likely to reach majority age before the death of his father, and primogeniture became increasingly favoured over proximity, tanistry, seniority and election.

In 1980, [[Sweden]] became the first monarchy to declare ''equal primogeniture'', ''absolute primogeniture'' or ''full cognatic primogeniture'', meaning that the eldest child of the monarch, whether female or male, ascends to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Other nations have since adopted this practice: [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990, [[Belgium]] in 1991, [[Denmark]] in 2009, and [[Luxembourg]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15489544&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wort.lu/en/luxembourg/new-ducal-succession-rights-for-grand-duchy-4f60cf15e4b047833b93fca0&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] adopted absolute (equal) primogeniture on April 25, 2013, following [[Perth Agreement|agreement by the prime ministers of the sixteen Commonwealth Realms]] at the 22nd Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.

In some monarchies, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], succession to the throne usually first passes to the monarch's next eldest brother and so on through his other brothers, and only after them to the monarch's children (''agnatic seniority''). In some other monarchies (e.g. [[Jordan]]), the monarch chooses who will be his successor within the royal family, who need not necessarily be his eldest son.

Whatever the rules of succession, there have been many cases of a monarch being overthrown and replaced by a usurper who would often install his own family on the throne.

===Monarchs in Africa===
{{Further|Monarchies in Africa}}
[[File:RamsesIIEgypt.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ramesses II]], the third [[Pharaoh]] of the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt]]]]
A series of [[Pharaoh]]s ruled [[Ancient Egypt]] over the course of three millennia (circa 3150 BC to 31 BC), until it was conquered by the [[Roman Empire]]. In the same time period several kingdoms flourished in the nearby [[Nubia]] region, with at least one of them, that of the so-called [[A-Group]] culture, apparently influencing the customs of Egypt itself. From the 6th to 19th centuries, Egypt was variously part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], Islamic Empire, [[Mamluk]] Sultanate, [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[British Empire]] with a distant monarch. The [[Sultanate of Egypt]] was a short lived protectorate of the [[United Kingdom]] from 1914 until 1922, when it became the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] and Sultan [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] changed his title to King. After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] the monarchy was dissolved and Egypt became a republic.

[[West Africa]] hosted the [[Kanem Empire]] (700–1376) and its successor, the [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] principality which survives to the present day as one of the [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] of [[Nigeria]].
[[File:Sultan Mohamoud Ali Shire 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mohamoud Ali Shire]], the 26th Sultan of the [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|Somali]] [[Warsangali Sultanate]]]]
In the [[Horn of Africa]], the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and later the [[Zagwe Dynasty]], [[Ethiopian Empire]] (1270–1974), and [[Aussa Sultanate]] were ruled by a series of monarchs. [[Haile Selassie]], the last Emperor of Ethiopia, was deposed in a [[communist]] [[coup]]. Various [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|Somali Sultanates]] also existed, including the [[Adal Sultanate]] (led by the [[Walashma dynasty]] of the [[Ifat Sultanate]]), [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]], [[Ajuran Sultanate]], [[Warsangali Sultanate]], [[Geledi Sultanate]], [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] and [[Sultanate of Hobyo]].

[[Central Africa|Central]] and [[Southern Africa]] were largely isolated from other regions until the modern era, but they did later feature kingdoms like the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] (1400–1914).

The [[Zulu people]] formed a powerful [[Zulu Kingdom]] in 1816, one that was subsequently absorbed into the [[Colony of Natal]] in 1897. The [[List of Zulu kings|Zulu king]] continues to hold a hereditary title and an influential cultural position in contemporary South Africa, although he has no direct political power. Other tribes in the country, such as the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and the [[Tswana people|Tswana]], have also had and continue to have a series of kings and chiefs whose local precedence is recognised, but who exercise no legal authority.

As part of the [[Scramble for Africa]], Europeans conquered, bought, or established African kingdoms and styled themselves as monarchs due to them.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Currently the African nations of [[Morocco]], [[Lesotho]] and [[Swaziland]] are sovereign monarchies under dynasties that are native to the continent. Places like [[St. Helena]], [[Ceuta]], [[Melilla]] and the [[Canary Islands]] are ruled by the [[Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] or the [[King of Spain]]. So-called "sub-national monarchies" of varying sizes can be found all over the rest of the continent, e.g. the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] city-state of [[Akure Kingdom|Akure]] in south-western [[Nigeria]] is something of an elective monarchy: its reigning [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] having to be chosen by an electoral college of nobles, from amongst a finite collection of royal princes of the realm.

Within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] different titles were used by nobles exercising various degrees of sovereignty within their borders (see below). Such titles were granted or recognised by the Emperor or Pope. Adoption of a new title to indicate sovereign or semi-sovereign status was not always recognized by other governments or nations, sometimes causing [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] problems.

During the nineteenth century many small monarchies in Europe merged with other territories to form larger entities, and following [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], many [[Monarchy abolishment|monarchies were abolished]], but of those remaining all except Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Vatican City and Monaco were headed by a king or queen.

{{As of|2015}} in Europe there are twelve monarchies: seven [[monarchy|kingdom]]s ([[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]]), one [[grand duchy]] ([[Luxembourg]]), one [[papacy]] ([[Vatican City]]), and two [[principalities]] ([[Liechtenstein]] and [[Monaco]]), as well as one [[diarchy]] principality ([[Andorra]]).

In China, before the abolition of the monarchy in 1912, the [[Emperor of China]] was traditionally regarded as the ruler of "[[Tianxia|All under heaven]]". "King" is the usual translation for the term ''wang'' 王, the sovereign before the [[Qin dynasty]] and during the [[Ten Kingdoms]] period. During the early [[Han dynasty]], China had a number of kingdoms, each about the size of a [[province]] and subordinate to the Emperor.
In Korea, ''Daewang'' (great king), or ''Wang'' (king), was a Chinese royal style used in many states rising from the dissolution of [[Gojoseon]], [[Buyeo kingdom|Buyeo]], [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], [[Silla]] and [[Balhae]], [[Goryeo]], [[Joseon]]. The legendary [[Dangun]] Wanggeom founded the first kingdom, Gojoseon. Some scholars maintain that the term ''Dangun'' also refers to a title used by all rulers of Gojoseon, and that ''Wanggeom'' is the proper name of the founder. ''Gyuwon Sahwa'' (1675) describes The Annals of the Danguns as a collection of nationalistic legends. The monarchs of Goguryeo and some monarchs of Silla used the title "[[Taewang]]", meaning the "Great king". The early monarchs of Silla have used the title of "Geoseogan", "Chachaung", "Isageum", and finally "Maripgan" until 503. The title "Gun" (prince) can refer to the dethroned rulers of Joseon dynasty as well. Under the [[Korean Empire]] (1897–1910), the rulers of Korea were given the title of "Hwangje", meaning the "Emperor". Today, Members of the Korean Imperial Family continue to participate in numerous traditional ceremonies, and groups exist to preserve Korea's lmperial heritage.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The [[Imperial House of Japan|Japanese monarchy]] is now the only monarchy to still use the title of [[Emperor]].

In modern history, between 1925 and 1979, Iran was ruled by two Emperors from the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] that used the title of "Shahanshah" (or "King of Kings"). The last Iranian Shahanshah was King [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], who was forced to abdicate the throne as a result of a revolution in Iran. In fact Persian (Iranian) kingdom goes back to about 2,700 BC (see [[Kings of iran#Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BC)|List of Kings of Persia]]), but reached its ultimate height and glory when King [[Cyrus the Great]] (Known as "The Great Kourosh" in Iran) started the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid dynasty]], and under his rule, the [[empire]] embraced all the previous civilized states of [[Ancient Near East|the ancient Near East]], expanded vastly and eventually conquered most of [[Southwest Asia]] and much of [[Central Asia]] and the Caucasus. From the [[Mediterranean sea]] and [[Hellespont]] in the west to the [[Indus River]] in the east, Cyrus the Great created the largest empire the world had yet seen.

[[Thailand]] and Bhutan are like the United Kingdom in that they are constitutional monarchies ruled by a King. [[Jordan]] and many other Middle Eastern monarchies are ruled by a [[Malik]] and parts of the [[United Arab Emirates]], such as [[Dubai]], are still ruled by monarchs.

[[Saudi Arabia]] is the largest Arab state in Western Asia by land area and the second-largest in the Arab world (after Algeria). It was founded by [[Ibn Saud|Abdul-Aziz bin Saud]] in 1932, although the conquests which eventually led to the creation of the Kingdom began in 1902 when he captured [[Riyadh]], the ancestral home of his family, the [[House of Saud]]; succession to the throne was limited to sons of Ibn Saud until 2015, when [[Muhammad bin Nayef|a grandson]] was elevated to Crown Prince. The Saudi Arabian government has been an absolute monarchy since its inception, and designates itself as [[Islamic]]. The King bears the title "Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques" in reference to the two holiest places in Islam: [[Masjid al-Haram]] in [[Mecca]], and [[Masjid al-Nabawi]] in [[Medina]].

[[File:Sultan Mehmet III of the Ottoman Empire.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Sultan [[Mehmed III]] from [[Ottoman Dynasty]]]]
[[Oman]] is led by Monarch Sultan [[Qaboos bin Said Al Said]]. The [[Kingdom of Jordan]] is one of the [[Middle East]]'s more modern monarchies is also ruled by a [[Malik]]. In Arab and arabized countries, [[Malik]] (absolute King) is absolute word to render a monarch and is superior to all other titles. [[Nepal]] abolished their monarchy in 2008. [[Sri Lanka]] had a complex system of monarchies from 543BC to 1815. Between 47BC-42BC Anula of Sri Lanka became the country's first female head of state as well as Asia's first head of state.{{dubious|date=September 2010}}

In [[Malaysia]]'s constitutional monarchy, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (The Supreme Lord of the Federation) is ''de facto'' rotated every five years among the nine Rulers of the Malay states of Malaysia (those nine of the thirteen states of Malaysia that have hereditary royal rulers), elected by ''Majlis Raja-Raja'' ([[Conference of Rulers]]).

Under [[Brunei]]'s 1959 constitution, the [[Sultan of Brunei]] is the head of state with full executive authority, including emergency powers, since 1962. The Prime Minister of Brunei is a title held by the Sultan. As the prime minister, the Sultan presides over the cabinet.

[[Cambodia]] has been a kingdom since the 1st century. The power of the absolute monarchy was reduced when it became the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia]] from 1863 to 1953. It returned to an absolute monarchy from 1953 until the establishment of a republic following the [[Cambodian coup of 1970|1970 coup]]. The monarchy was restored as a constitutional monarchy in 1993 with the king as a largely symbolic figurehead.

In the [[Philippines]], the [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|pre-Colonial]] [[Filipino people|Filipino]] nobility, variously titled the ''harì'' (today meaning "king"), ''[[Lakan]]'', ''[[Raja]]'' and ''[[Datu]]'' belonged to the caste called ''Uring [[Maharlika]]'' (Noble Class). When the islands [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|were annexed]] to the [[Spanish Empire]] in the late 16th century, the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarch]] became the sovereign while local rulers often retained their prestige as part of the [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christianised]] nobility called the ''[[Principalía]]''. After the [[Spanish–American War]], the country was ceded to the United States of America and made into a territory and eventually a [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]], thus ending monarchism. While the Philippines is currently a republic, the [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sultan of Sulu]] and [[Sultanate of Maguindanao|Sultan of Maguindanao]] retain their titles only for ceremonial purposes, but are considered ordinary citizens by the [[1987 Constitution]]. [[Bhutan]] has been an independent kingdom since 1907. The first [[Druk Gyalpo]] (''Dragon King'') was elected and thereafter became a hereditary absolute monarchy. It became a constitutional monarchy in 2008.

[[Tibet]] was a monarchy since the [[Tibetan Empire]] in the 6th century. It was ruled by the [[Yuan Dynasty]] following the Mongol invasion in the 13th century and became an effective [[diarchy]] with the [[Dalai Lama]] as co-ruler. It came under the rule of the Chinese [[Qing Dynasty]] from 1724 until 1912 when it gained de facto independence. The [[Dalai Lama]] became absolute temporal monarch until [[incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China]] in 1951.

[[Nepal]] was a monarchy for most of its history until becoming a federal republic in 2008.

The concept of monarchy existed in the Americas long before the arrival of European colonialists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carsten-rex.de/History/history.html Canada: History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219053336/http://www.carsten-rex.de/History/history.html |date=2007-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macleans.ca/switchboard/article.jsp?content=20031027_68038_68038 Ferguson, Will; ''The Lost Kingdom''; ''Macleans'', October 27, 2003] {{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Europeans arrived they referred to these tracts of land within territories of different aboriginal groups to be kingdoms, and the leaders of these groups were often referred to by the Europeans as Kings, particularly hereditary leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/mi4/polcrt/4Chiefs.html The Four Indian Kings]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-colonial titles that were used included:
* [[Cacique]] – Aboriginal [[Hispaniola]] and [[Borinquen]]
* [[Tlatoani]] – [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]]s
* [[Ajaw]] – [[Maya civilization|Maya]]
* [[Qhapaq Inka]] – [[Inca Empire|Tawuantin Suyu]] (Inca Empire)
* Morubixaba – [[Tupi people|Tupi]] tribes
* Sha-quan – King of the world used in some Native American tribes

The first local monarch to emerge in North America after colonization was [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who declared himself [[First Haitian Empire|Emperor of Haiti]] on September 22, 1804. Haiti again had an emperor, [[Faustin I of Haiti| Faustin I]] from 1849 to 1859. In South America, Brazil&lt;ref&gt;L Gomes. 1889: como um imperador cansado, um marechal vaidoso e um professor injustiçado contribuíram para a o fim da monarquia e programação da republica no Brasil. Globo Livros. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; had a royal house ruling as emperor between 1822 and 1889, under Emperors [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] and [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]].

Between 1931 and 1983 nine other previous British colonies attained independence as kingdoms. All, including Canada, are in a [[personal union]] relationship under a shared monarch. Therefore, though today there are legally ten American monarchs, one person occupies each distinct position.

In addition to these sovereign states, there are also a number of sub-national ones. In [[Bolivia]], for example, the [[Afro-Bolivian monarchy|Afro-Bolivian king]] claims descent from an African dynasty that was taken from its homeland and sold into slavery. Though largely a ceremonial title today, the position of ''king of the Afro-Bolivians'' is officially recognized by the government of Bolivia.

[[Polynesia]]n societies were ruled by an ''[[ariki]]'' from ancient times. The title is variously translated as "supreme chief", "paramount chief" or "king".

The [[Kingdom of Tahiti]] was founded in 1788. Sovereignty was ceded to [[France]] in 1880 although descendants of the [[Pōmare Dynasty]] claim the title of King of Tahiti.

The [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was established in 1795 and overthrown in 1893.

An independent [[Kingdom of Rarotonga]] was established in 1858. It became a protectorate of the [[United Kingdom]] at its own request in 1893.

[[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]] ruled the short lived [[Kingdom of Fiji]], a constitutional monarchy, from 1871 to 1874 when he voluntarily ceded sovereignty of the islands to the [[United Kingdom]]. After independence in 1970, the [[Dominion of Fiji]] retained the British monarch as head of state until it became a republic following a [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|military coup in 1987]].

[[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] (including the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]]), [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Tuvalu]] are sovereign states within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] that currently have [[Elizabeth II]] as their reigning constitutional monarch.

The [[Pitcairn Islands]] are part of the [[British Overseas Territories]] with [[Elizabeth II]] as the reigning constitutional monarch.

[[Tonga]] is the only remaining sovereign kingdom in Oceania. It has had a monarch since the 10th century and became a constitutional monarchy in 1875. In 2008, King [[George Tupou V]] relinquished most of the powers of the monarchy and the position is now largely ceremonial.

In [[New Zealand]] the position of [[Māori King Movement|Māori King]] was established in 1858. The role is largely cultural and ceremonial, and has no legal power.

[[Wallis Island|Uvea]], [[Alo (Wallis and Futuna)|Alo]] and [[Sigave]] in the [[France|French]] territory of [[Wallis and Futuna]] have non-sovereign elective monarchs.

==Titles and precedence in Europe==
{{For|commonly used names for specific monarchs|List of monarchs by nickname}}

The usage and meaning of a monarch's specific title has historically been defined by tradition, law and diplomatic considerations.

Note that some titles borne by monarchs have several meanings and may not exclusively designate a monarch. A [[Prince]] may be a [[prince du sang|person of royal blood]] (some languages uphold this distinction, see [[Fürst]]). A [[Duke]] may belong to a [[peerage]] and hold a dukedom (title) but no duchy (territory). In [[Imperial Russia]], a [[Grand Duke]] was a son or patrilineal grandson of the [[Tsar]] or [[Tsarina]]. Holders of titles in these alternative meanings did not enjoy the same status as monarchs of the same title.

Within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], there were numerous titles used by noblemen whose authority within their territory sometimes approached [[sovereignty]], even though they acknowledged the Holy Roman Emperor as [[suzerain]]; [[Prince-elector|Elector]], [[Grand Duke]], [[Margrave]], [[Landgrave]] and [[Count Palatine]], as well as secular princes like kings, dukes, princes and "princely counts" (''Gefürstete Grafen''), and ecclesiastical princes like Prince-Archbishops, [[Prince-bishop|Prince-Bishops]] and Prince-Abbots. A ruler with a title below emperor or king might still be regarded as a monarch, outranking a nobleman of the same ostensible title (e.g., [[Antoine, Duke of Lorraine]], a reigning sovereign, and his younger brother, [[Claude, Duke of Guise]], a nobleman in the [[peerage of France]]).

The table below lists titles in approximate [[order of precedence]]. According to [[protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] any holder of a title indicating sovereignty took precedence over any non-sovereign titleholder.

|Successor of St. Peter, Bishop of Rome, Head of the Roman Catholic Church, Monarch of the [[Papal States]] and later Sovereign of the State of [[Vatican City]]. As senior ruler in Medieval Christendom, the Pope held precedence over all other titles and offices. The Papacy is a celibate office always forbidden to women; in English however, reports of female popes such as ([[Pope Joan]]) refer to them as ''pope'' and ''[[Popess]]''; the term is used, among other things, for the second trump in the [[Tarot]] deck''; some European languages also have a feminine form of the word pope, such as the Italian ''papessa'', the French ''papesse'', the Portuguese ''papisa'' and the German ''Päpstin''.

==Use of titles by non-sovereigns==
It is not uncommon that people who are not generally seen as monarchs nevertheless use monarchical titles. There are at least five cases of this:
* Claiming an existing title, challenging the current holder. This has been very common historically. For centuries, the [[British monarchy|British monarch]] used, among his other titles, the title [[King of France]], despite the fact that he had had no authority over mainland French territory since the sixteenth century. Other cases include the numerous [[antipope]]s who have claimed the [[Holy See]].
* Retaining the title of an extinct monarchy. This can be coupled with a claim that the monarchy was in fact never, or should never have been, extinct. An example of the first case is the [[Seborga|Prince of Seborga]]. Examples of the second case are several [[List of monarchs who lost their thrones or abdicated in the 20th century|deposed monarchs]] or otherwise [[pretender|pretenders to thrones of abolished monarchies]], e.g., [[Leka, Crown Prince of Albania (born 1982)|Leka, Crown Prince of Albania]] who is styled by some as the "King of The Albanians". Retaining the title of an extinct monarchy can, however, be totally free of claims of sovereignty, for example it was customary in numerous European monarchies to include "King of Jerusalem" in their full titles. When it comes to deposed monarchs, it is customary to continue the usage of their monarchical title (e.g., [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II, King of the Hellenes]]) as a [[courtesy title]], not a constitutional position, for the duration of their lifetime. However the title then dies with them and is not used by subsequent heirs or claimants unless the crown is restored constitutionally. Monarchs who have ''freely'' [[abdicate]]d are sometimes addressed by a lesser style (although, see [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] and [[Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]. However, where a monarch abdicated under duress (e.g., [[Michael I of Romania]]), it is usual (especially outside their former realm) to continue to use their monarchical style for their lifetime as a traditional courtesy.
* Inventing a new title. This is common among founders of [[micronation]]s, and also may or may not come with a claim of sovereignty, not usually recognised abroad. A notable example is [[Paddy Roy Bates]], styling himself the "Prince of Sealand", but not recognized as such by any national government, thus failing at least the [[constitutive theory of statehood|constitutive condition for statehood]] (see [[Principality of Sealand|Sealand]] for a fuller discussion of his claims). Another known example is that of [[Emperor Norton|Norton I]], who invented the title "Emperor of the United States of America" and later declared himself "Protector of Mexico".
* Usage of a monarchical title by a fictional character. This is common in [[fairy tale]]s and other works geared to children, as well as works of [[fantasy]]. Examples include [[Princess Leia]] and [[Princess Summerfall Winterspring]].
* [[Honorific nicknames in popular music]] and other aspects of popular culture, such as "King of Rock and Roll", [[Count Basie]] or [[Emperor Norton]].

'''Mother Boxes''' are fictional devices in [[Jack Kirby]]'s ''[[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|Fourth World]]'' setting in the [[DC Universe]].

==History==
Created by Apokoliptian scientist [[Himon]] using the mysterious ''Element X'', they are generally thought to be sentient, miniaturized, portable [[supercomputers]], although their true nature and origins are unknown. They possess wondrous powers and abilities not understood even by their users, the gods of [[New Genesis]]. These range from teleportation (they can summon [[Boom Tube]]s) to energy manipulation. Mother Boxes have been seen healing the injured, including [[Darkseid]] himself, after he was beaten by [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] stated that each Mother Box shares "a mystical rapport with nature". They provide their owner with unconditional love and self-destruct when their owner dies.

Mother Boxes have sacrificed themselves for causes they have believed in and are greatly respected by the people of New Genesis. In physical appearance they are most often in the shape of a small box, but they can also be much larger (as is the one carried by the [[Forever People]]), and do not always need to be in the shape of a box at all ([[Mr. Miracle]] had Mother Box circuitry woven into the hood of his costume). They usually communicate with a repetitive "ping!" which can be understood by their users.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Mother Box.jpg|thumb|Superman uses a Mother Box to get to Apokolips in Superman/Doomsday Hunter/Prey #1.]]
* Mother Boxes can access the energy of the [[Source (comics)|Source]] for various effects; they can change the gravitational constant of an area, transfer energy from one place to another, sense danger, sense life, create force fields, rearrange molecular structure of matter, absorb or project powerful shock blasts, create electro-webs, control the mental state of a host, communicate telepathically with a host or other life form, manipulate the life-force of a host to sustain it past fatal injuries, open and close [[boom tube]]s,&lt;ref name="boom"&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Dan Jurgens|Jurgens, Dan]] | Penciller = [[Dan Jurgens|Jurgens, Dan]] | Inker = [[Brett Breeding|Breeding, Brett]] | Title = Superman/Doomsday Hunter/Prey | Issue = 1 | Date = 1994 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 44}}&lt;/ref&gt; take over and control non-sentient machines, evolve non-sentient machines, merge sentient beings into a single more powerful being, sustain a life form in a hostile environment such as space, and do many other things. Mother Boxes have an affinity for the Source and are believed to draw their power from it. In that sense, they can be seen as a computer that links man to God.
* To the New Gods, they are common appliances (used much like a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] or smartphone on Earth), insofar as a sentient device can be called an "appliance". Other DC characters are given access to them at specific times, when they are in need of aid. Notably, [[Superman]] was given one when he went in pursuit of [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]].
* Mother Boxes can only be manufactured by a being born either on New Genesis or Apokolips, and not all of them can do it (at least one on Apokolips failed). This is accomplished through much training. It is implied in the books that the maker's character influences the successful construction of a Mother Box. This quality applied to all the ''Fourth World'' books (''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen''; ''Forever People''; ''New Gods''; and ''Mister Miracle'') at the time of their original run by Jack Kirby. In later versions of the previously mentioned books, and in other stories where elements from the Fourth World books (such as the Mother Box) were used, other writers altered the crafting and abilities of Mother Boxes to allow for their making and usage by humans and entities from other planets (such as Superman or Batman).

==Notable users and usage==
* Noted Mother Boxes include those of [[Mister Miracle]] and [[Shilo Norman]], the Mother Box of the [[Forever People]], which can summon the [[Infinity-Man]], and the Mother Box used by [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] to access the magic lightning when the wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] was on New Genesis. 
* When tracking Doomsday after his old foe was reborn on Apokolips, Superman was given a Mother Box by Oberon which he acquired from his connections to Mister Miracle. This Mother Box managed to open boom tubes to take Superman to Apokolips,&lt;ref name="boom"/&gt; heal Darkseid (when Superman needed his foe's aid against the [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]]) after he'd taken a serious beating from Doomsday,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Dan Jurgens|Jurgens, Dan]] | Penciller = [[Dan Jurgens|Jurgens, Dan]] | Inker = [[Brett Breeding|Breeding, Brett]] | Title = Superman/Doomsday Hunter/Prey | Issue = 2 | Date = 1994 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; give Superman a power boost to battle Doomsday in the form of various high-tech weapons such as an [[ultrasonics]] gun and a laser sword,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Dan Jurgens|Jurgens, Dan]] | Penciller = [[Dan Jurgens|Jurgens, Dan]] | Inker = [[Brett Breeding|Breeding, Brett]] | Title = Superman/Doomsday Hunter/Prey | Issue = 3 | Date = 1994 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; used [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]]'s gauntlet to send Doomsday to the end of the universe, and healed Superman's injuries (simultaneously restoring his original clothes) at the end of the battle, although this last act drained it of power
* [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] has a Mother Box which controls his rage and bestial appearance, but it has been removed several times: Once when it was used by [[John Henry Irons|Steel]] as a means of blocking a telepathic probe on the planet [[Rann]] (Orion was unable to use it in this manner as he was so enraged by his current capture that it was unable to block his thoughts due to it expending so much energy simply trying to calm him down) and also when Metron gave it to [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] during the [[Mageddon]] crisis after Orion had removed it so that he could confront Mageddon with his full rage and power. It bonded with Oracle's computers to allow her to telepathically connect with the minds of every person on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA'' #39&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Walt Simonson]]'s ''Orion'' series it seemingly died, and he used a unique Apokaliptian '''Father Box''' instead. This box communicated by going "ting!" rather than "ping!", and was designed to turn him towards Darkseid.
* Due to time travel, a Mother Box spent hundreds of years in a Japanese temple, waiting for the [[Forever People]] to reclaim it.&lt;ref&gt;''The Forever People'' #6 (Jan. 1, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Iron Man]] was given a Mother Box by Metron in the ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' mini-series. He used it to predict the JLA's moves and had it interface with his own armor.
* In [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Seven Soldiers]]: Mister Miracle'' storyline, only one Mother Box has survived the destruction of New Genesis. It is owned by Shilo Norman, the third Mister Miracle, who sometimes calls it "motherboxxx". 
* In ''[[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Blue Beetle]]'' (vol. 4), a story-arc centered around a Mother Box and the New Gods Lonar and [[Metron (comics)|Metron]]. The Mother Box is allegedly [[mourning]] its master and teleports the user to the homeworld/trap planet of [[Devilance the Pursuer]].
* In the video game ''[[Justice League Heroes]]'', [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] steals a Mother Box from the [[Justice League Watchtower|Watchtower]] for Darkseid, but the game presents the device visually as larger and cube-shaped with a single red eye. It is far more powerful as well, transforming Earth into a New Apokolips and back at a whim.
* In the ''[[Starman (comics)|Starman]]'' series, Ted Knight was lent a Mother Box by Orion to be incorporated, along with [[Rampage (DC Comics)|Kitty Faulkner]]'s energy-detecting technology, into the spaceship his son Jack used to track down a former Starman, [[Will Payton]]. This Mother Box was destroyed along with the spaceship by missiles fired from Throneworld. A notable feature of this Mother Box was the fact Ted Knight's consciousness, memories and personality were apparently copied and served as the Box's consciousness, as well as creating a holographic image of Knight to aid Jack. Since this specific box was programmed by Orion, it was prone to violent solutions.
* In the ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' comic, Ares, the God of War, is shown to have a Mother Box in his possession. This box is stolen by Harley Quinn and Billy Batson while they are trapped in Tartarus. They are shown to be teleported to an unknown place (later revealed to be Apokolips where they are confronted and captured by Darkseid).
* In the video game ''[[Injustice 2]]'', [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] is shown to have Mother Box technology integrated into his systems, allowing him to open Boom Tubes as well as summon explosive drones to use in combat. Upon his release, Darkseid is also shown to wield Mother Box technology, opening Boom Tubes for himself as well as his Parademons. Additionally, Mother Boxes act as loot crates for the game's "Gear System".
* In the 2017 film, ''[[Justice League (2017 film)|Justice League]]'', Steppenwolf combines three objects he calls Mother Boxes with the intent to remake Earth.

==Grandmother Box==
In the possible future seen in the ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]: Rock of Ages'' storyline (also by Grant Morrison), Darkseid relates how [[Granny Goodness]] and her forces attacked the central computer intelligence on New Genesis and how her mind became a part of the Mother Boxes, which were then transformed into an insane sentient computer called the "Grandmother Box" or more commonly "Granny Box".

==Father Box==
The Father Box, an Apokoliptian version of a Mother Box, first appeared in the ''Orion'' series by Simonson in 2000. Darkseid’s former aide Mortalla presents Orion with an Apokoliptian Father Box.
* In [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Seven Soldiers]]: Mister Miracle'' storyline, a Father Box is mentioned as one of the "Seven Treasures" the New Gods left to the Earth's first superhero. It came in the form of two dice. It was called  "the Foundation Stone of Manhattan" in ''[[Manhattan Guardian]]'' and "Croatoan" in ''[[Klarion]]''. Eventually, it was stolen by [[Klarion the Witch Boy]], who took it to the future.
* In ''[[Justice League of America]]'' (vol. 2) #1 by [[Brad Meltzer]], a villain named [[Doctor Impossible]] uses a Father Box to summon "[[Boom Tube#Hush tube|hush tubes]]".
* In ''[[Supergirl (comic book)|Supergirl]]'' (vol. 5) #15 [[Power Boy#Power Boy|Power Boy]] refers to and accesses his Father Box.
* In the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Disordered", [[Desaad]] uses a Father Box to control the [[Infinity-Man]] until the New Genesphere joins with Infinity-Man to regain control of him. In the episode "The Hunt" [[Lex Luthor]] gives the runaways a Father Box to rescue the team and one to [[Deathstroke]] to retrieve the key to War World for The Light, but when the runaways discover Luthor's been using them, they angrily destroy their Father Box.

==Orphan Box==
An Orphan Box is created by [[Father Time (DC Comics)|Father Time]] from the remains of [[Gonzo the Mechanical Bastard]] in the ''Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters'' mini-series.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===
* In ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', the Mother Box appears in the double episode "Twilight of the Gods". In it, the Justice League travel to Apokolips, where in the end of the events Superman deals a resounding defeat to Darkseid. [[Batman]] uses a Mother Box to generate a Boom Tube to prevent a rage-blinded Superman from killing Darkseid, and to escape the destruction of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s base.
* In "[[Justice League Unlimited]]", it appears in the episode "Question Authority", in which Superman and [[Captain Atom]] are fiercely attacked by [[Mantis (DC Comics)|Mantis]], Superman later takes his Mother Box to generate a Boom Tube to send him back to his homeplanet Apokolips.
* In ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', the Mother Box appears in episode "Disordered" alongside the [[Forever People]]. Its various uses are used including opening Boom Tubes, tracking New Genesis technology, summoning [[Infinity-Man]] and healing Sphere. In the episode "The Hunt", [[Lex Luthor]] gives a Father Box to his band of young metahumans in order to track down the superheroes who had been kidnapped by the [[Reach (comics)|Reach]]. The Father Box is later destroyed by [[Samurai (Super Friends)#In other media|Asami Koizumi]] after she discovers that the teens had been manipulated and lied to by Luthor.
* In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', the Mother Box appears in the double episode "The Call".  In it, the Justice League Unlimited travel to the Fortress of Solitude, and Barda uses it to transport the star-shaped aliens back to their home planet.
* A Mother Box is featured in the ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'' TV special "Super Hero High".

===Film===

====DC Extended Universe====
{{main|DC Extended Universe}}
* In the ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' feature film, the Mother Box appears briefly in footage that [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]] has obtained from [[Lex Luthor]]. The Box is the final component that transforms Victor Stone into [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], thus saving his life in the process. Also in the Ultimate Edition release there is a scene involving Lex on the [[Fortress of Solitude|Kryptonian ship]] where there is a hologram communication with an unknown entity, who can be seen holding three Mother Boxes before disappearing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ew.com/article/2016/03/28/batman-v-superman-cyborg-scene-explained/2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collider.com/batman-vs-superman-ultimate-edition-differences/|title=Batman vs Superman Ultimate Edition Differences|date=2016-07-03|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'', the villain [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]] is in search of three Mother Boxes hidden away on Earth. The first two are located in [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]] and [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] respectively, and the third is the one seen in ''Batman v Superman'' that was used to activate Cyborg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/set-visit-everything-you-need-to-know-about-zack-snyders-justice-league-228|title=SET VISIT: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ZACK SNYDER'S JUSTICE LEAGUE|publisher=Joblo|last=Bumbray|first=Chris|date=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three boxes were used during Steppenwolf's original invasion of Earth, with his goal to bring them together and trigger a mass transformation of the entire planet, but this plan was thwarted when the Olympian Gods, Atlanteans, Amazons, Green Lantern Corps, and humans successfully drove him away, and the timely intervention of a lightning bolt from [[Zeus]] separated the boxes. After the war, the boxes were left on Earth, and the Amazons, Atlanteans, and humans each took custody of one of them. After Steppenwolf claims the Atlantean and Amazon-guarded boxes, Cyborg reveals that the box that was used to activate him was found during the [[First World War]], but remained dormant until shortly after Superman's death. Analyzing the box, Batman concludes that they can use its energy-generation abilities to restore Superman to life, taking Superman's body to the Kryptonian ship to use the birthing pool that Lex Luthor used to create [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] in the previous film, Cyborg controlling the equipment directly while [[Flash (Barry Allen)|the Flash]] generates a lightning bolt to charge the Box to power the process. While the other heroes are distracted by Superman's resurrection, Steppenwolf claims the third box, but they are able to track him to a remote former nuclear testing ground in Russia after Steppenwolf brings the boxes together, beginning the transformation that destroys the surrounding area. Despite their foe's efforts and the odds against them, the League are able to fight their way to Steppenwolf and with Superman's help, prevent any nearby civilian causalities and, ultimately, fight him to a standstill so that Cyborg could disrupt the energy flow between the boxes and allow Superman to separate them by forcing them apart. The loss of power inspires such terror in Steppenwolf that after [[Wonder Woman]] destroys his axe he gives in to it, causing him to be attacked by his own Parademons before they are all pulled off-planet by a boom tube, and the transformation of the surrounding area reverses in effect, causing a rapid growth of various kinds of flowers. The Boxes are returned to their respective custodies, with [[Silas Stone]] researching the third box with [[Cyborg (comics)|his son]] to explore the extent of its powers.

* In the Blu-Ray home release of ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'', the epilogue ''Etta's mission'' is included as an additional detailing of the events that transpired after the events of the film's story. In the epilogue, [[Etta Candy]] is reunited with Diana Prince and [[Steve Trevor]]'s friends and collaborators for one final secret mission, which consists in retrieving an ancient, strange unidentified artifact rumored to contain enormous power. In the end, the artifact turns out to be the Mother Box that was hidden millennia ago by humankind, and precisely the exact same one whose origins are explained by Cyborg and that ended up in his possession during the events of ''Justice League''.

====Animation====
* In the animated film ''[[Superman/Batman: Apocalypse]]'', the Mother Box appears in two different situations. First, Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman seek [[Big Barda]]'s help to reach Apokolips to rescue the kidnapped [[Kara Zor-El]], Superman requests Barda expressly the lending of her Mother Box for such ends. And secondly, during Superman and Darkseid's climactic battle, Kara takes advantage of Darkseid's distraction to reprogram his Mother Box coordinates, to generate a Boom Tube that sends him not to his home planet Apokolips, but deep into space.
* In ''[[Justice League: War]]'', Mother Box technology was being deployed by infiltrating Parademons who were preparing the invasion of the planet. A number of the boxes were placed at select sites such as in Metropolis, Central City, Coast City, and Gotham. One was recovered by Batman whilst Flash took another to S.T.A.R. Labs for study by Silas Stone. The others were activated leading to Boom Tubes being created bringing in Apokolips's invasion forces of Parademons. During its activation, one Box was in the hands of Victor Stone leading to him being badly wounded and forcing his father Silas Stone to use cybernetics to transform him into a Cyborg. His newfound cybernetics gave him an intimate link to machinery that allowed him to communicate with a Mother Box to learn of Darkseid and even create Boom Tubes to send the Apokoliptian invasion forces back to their world. Whilst the Parademons were returned, Darkseid himself managed to resist the Boom Tube with the Mother Box lacking the power to force him back. This was until Shazam sent his magical lightning to empower the device thus defeating Darkseid with Cyborg stating that the Mother Box technology had been fried which would prevent a further invasion from Apokolips.

====Video games====
* In ''[[Injustice 2]]'', Mother Boxes serve as the game's [[loot box]] rewards system. The player can be rewarded with 5 different tiers of Mother Boxes: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond. These Mother Boxes contain rewards such as gear pieces from three possible rarities (common, rare, and epic), character shaders, and character abilities. Each box can contain as little as two rewards and as much as six, and the likelihood of obtaining gear of a higher rarity increases with each box tier. Bronze Mother Boxes are easiest to obtain while Diamond boxes are the most difficult. Mother Boxes can be earned by several means, such as through completing the game's campaign, completing in-fight challenges, playing through Multiverse ladders, and completing specific Multiverse objectives. 
** Also in ''Injustice 2'', [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]'s in-game character power allows him to utilize Mother Boxes, granting him the ability to create air or land drones that can target the opponent from multiple directions.
* In ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', a Mother Box is stolen from [[Waynetech|Wayne Tech]] and owned by [[Harley Quinn]], who names it "Boxy". It is also revealed that the Mother Box contains the last piece of the [[Anti-Life Equation]], which is then absorbed by the Rookie.

'''Otherkin''' are a [[subculture]] who socially and spiritually [[identity (social science)|identify]] as not entirely human. Some otherkin claim that their identity is genetic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Psychic Vampire Codex: A Manual of Magick and Energy Work |year=2004 |publisher=[[Weiser Books]] |isbn=1-57863-321-4 |author=[[Michelle Belanger]] |author2=[[Father Sebastiaan]] |quote=/--/ Some feel that their difference is purely spiritual, while others believe there is a genetic difference between themselves and humanity. /--/}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others believe their identity derives from [[reincarnation]], trans-species dysphoria of the [[soul]], ancestry, or [[metaphor]].&lt;ref name=fieldguide /&gt; Joseph P. Laycock considers the belief to be [[religion|religious]].&lt;ref name=laycock /&gt;

==Description==

Otherkin largely identify as mythical creatures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vampires in Their Own Words: An Anthology of Vampire Voices |year=2007 |publisher=[[Llewellyn Worldwide]] |isbn=0-7387-1220-5 |author=[[Michelle Belanger]] |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; with others identifying as creatures from fantasy or popular culture.

With regard to their online communities, otherkin largely function without formal authority structures, and mostly focus on support and information gathering, often dividing into more specific groups based on kintype.&lt;ref name=questing&gt;{{cite book |title=Through a Glass Darkly: Collected Research |year=2006 |publisher=[[Sydney University Press]] |url=http://ojs-prod.library.usyd.edu.au/index.php/SSR/article/view/259/238 |author=Kirby, Danielle |editor=Frances Di Lauro |chapter=Alternative Worlds: Metaphysical questing and virtual community amongst the Otherkin |isbn=1920898549}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are occasional offline gatherings, but the otherkin network is mostly an online phenomenon.&lt;ref name=questing /&gt;

Some otherkin claim to be especially empathic and attuned to nature.&lt;ref name=villagevoice /&gt; Some state to be able to [[shapeshifting|shapeshift]] mentally or [[Subtle body#Astral body|astrally]], meaning that they experience the sense of being in their particular form while not actually changing physically.&lt;ref name=fieldguide /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Shadow Magick Compendium: Exploring Darker Aspects of Magickal Spirituality |year=2008 |publisher=[[Llewellyn Worldwide]] |isbn=0-7387-1318-X |author=Raven Digitalis |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Therianthropy#Psychiatric aspects|therian]] and [[Vampire lifestyle|vampire]] subcultures are related to the otherkin community, and are considered part of it by most otherkin, but are culturally and historically distinct movements of their own, despite some overlap in membership.&lt;ref name=fieldguide /&gt;

==Etymology==
"Otherkin" as an adjective was defined in the ''[[Middle English Dictionary]]'' (1981) as "a different or an additional kind of, other kinds of".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Middle English Dictionary]]: O.3, Volume 0 |year=1981 |publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]] |isbn=0-472-01153-7 |author=Sherman M.

The earliest recorded use of the term ''otherkin'', in the context of a subculture, appeared in July 1990 and the variant ''otherkind'' was reported as early as April 1990.&lt;ref name="fieldguide" /&gt; The word "otherkind" was initially coined from the word "elfinkind", to refer to non-elf others who joined the communities.&lt;ref name=timeline /&gt;

==History==
The otherkin [[subculture]] grew out of the [[Elves in fantasy fiction and games|elven]] [[virtual community|online communities]] of the early-to-mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="veilsedge" /&gt;

The oldest [[Internet]] resource for otherkin is the ''Elfinkind Digest'', a [[mailing list]] started in 1990 by a student at the [[University of Kentucky]] for "elves and interested observers".&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orion.kitsunet.net/time.pdf |title=Otherkin Timeline: The Recent History of Elfin, Fae, and Animal People |date=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the early 1990s, [[newsgroups]] such as [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/alt.horror.werewolves alt.horror.werewolves]&lt;ref name="cursewere"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Curse of the Werewolf: Fantasy, Horror and the Beast Within |author= Chantal Bourgault Du Coudray |publisher= [[I.B. Tauris]] |year= 2006 |isbn= 1-84511-158-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/alt.fan.dragons alt.fan.dragons] on [[Usenet]], which were initially created for fans of these creatures in the context of [[fantasy]] and [[Horror and terror|horror]] literature and films, also developed followings of individuals who identified as [[mythological]] beings.&lt;ref name="fieldguide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite book| last=Cohen| first= D. |year=1996 |title=Werewolves |location=New York |publisher= [[Penguin Books]] |isbn= 0-525-65207-8 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 February 1995, a document titled the "Elven Nation Manifesto" was posted to Usenet, including the groups alt.pagan and alt.magick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/group/alt.magick/msg/e5adba21569abd19?dmode=source&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1 |title= The Elven Nation Manifesto.....everyone must read this!!!! |date=1995-02-06 |publisher=alt.magick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enough people contacted the original author of the Elven Nation post in good faith for a planned mailing list to spin off from it.&lt;ref name="veilsedge"&gt;{{cite book |first=Willow |last=Polson |title= The Veil's Edge: Exploring the Boundaries of Magic |publisher=[[Citadel Press]] |page=95 |year=2003 |isbn=0-8065-2352-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rich Dansky (who worked on the development of ''[[Changeling: The Dreaming]]'') said that after the game's release the darkfae-l [[LISTSERV|listserv]] had "a rampaging debate... over how the folks at White Wolf had gotten so much of their existence right", adding, "Finally, one of the list members came to the obvious conclusion that we'd gotten it right because we ourselves were in fact changelings." Dansky denied being non-human.&lt;ref name=villagevoice&gt;{{cite web| title=Elven Like Me: Otherkin Come Out of the Closet |first=Nick |last=Mamatas |publisher=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York |date=February 20, 2001 |url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2001-02-13/news/elven-like-me/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[cork (material)|cork]] and [[wool]].]]

A '''placemat''' or '''table mat''' is a covering or pad designating an individual place setting, unlike the larger table cloth that covers the entire surface. Placemats are made from many different materials depending on their purpose: to protect, decorate, entertain or advertise. Materials and production methods range from mass-produced and commercial, to local and traditional.

== Uses ==
Their primary function is to protect the dinner table from water marks, food stains or heat damage. They also serve as [[Interior decoration|decoration]], especially placemats made from [[lace]] or [[silk]]. In restaurants they can be used to advertise menu items, specials, local businesses or games for children. If the mat is cotton, it is useful because it absorbs water and other liquids.

Higher end placemats, made from [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] or [[leather]], are used by [[hotel]]s and organizations for meetings as they provide a writing surface, and give an area on which to lean comfortably and to place objects on the table with minimal noise during meetings.

Contemporary opinion on the usefulness of placemats is mixed. Cloth placemats are commonly considered to be unnecessary and require excessive upkeep - compared to the surface of a table which can be easily cleaned, a stained placemat must be run through the washer and drier before it can be used again. Moreover, [[plastic]] placemats have drawn criticism on environmental grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saferchemicals.org/newsroom/new-study-of-picnic-supplies-finds-lead-phthalates-hazardous-flame-retardants-organotins-and-other-h/ Saferchemicals.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pottery]] had its roots deep in the subcontinent and Bangladesh was not an exception. Although Bangladesh is predominantly a Muslim country, pottery is predominantly a [[Hindu]] craft.
Symmetrical, smooth, bright and unless it falls, it would last a long time-these attributes made things  of pottery very popular.

==Origin==

The origin of '''pottery in Bangladesh''' dates back to the [[Mahejodaro]] and [[Harappa]] civilization after the earthenware were found after the excavation of Mohasthangar of bogra. The categoriacal folk arts found are still being used ffor moder artifacts.
The potters are predominan Hindus. Most of them bear the same surname-Pal. And for most if has been a traditional profession carried by their families. Most of them make utilitarian vessels for carrying water and cooking. While the others make sculptures(mürti) for worship and showpieces.

Potters were actually popularised during the [[zamindars]]. They used to be patronised for making statues of goddesses, plates and other aesthetical items. Sometimes they were made to sculpt statues of the zamindar themselves. But after the end of the zamindar, they started making everyday household items for sale in the local markets to earn a living. They also made the wheels of the very popular transportation system Gorur Gari (a lightweight cart pulled by male cows).

==Pottery villages==

The [[Dhamrai]] pottery industry is the most renowned village for '''pottery in Bangladesh'''. There are several pottery villages in Dhamrai, such as Kagojipara, Shimulia Pal para, Notun bondor, etc. These villages are in very mental pressure plz donate them well known for their pottery expertise and the Pal family residence for generations.
Most of the artisans work here as freelancers. They make the product and sell it in the local market.

==Terracotta==

Terracotta indicates the clay after potty it has been burned by fire and eaten. It is a very popular form of making sculptures via '''pottery'''. It demanded very little as he products made of clay could be baked like cup cake under the sun for one year or burned to give it a soothing orange-clay color and it would greatly improve the durability.
Most of the artisans opted for terracotta as it was easier and the cheaper option. This tradition could also be traced back to the Mahenjodarro and Harappa civilisations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7525">'''Preservation of meaning''' in library, archival or museum collections involves understanding spiritual, ritual, or cultural perceptions of value for specific objects, and ensuring these values are maintained and respected.  Meaning is something assigned to objects of cultural or spiritual significance based on interpretations and perceived values by user populations, a process known as social construction of an object (Barker, 77).  When moved to [[memory institution]]s such as libraries or museums, these objects of social construction require unique approaches to preservation and maintenance in order to remain relevant as representations of cultural or spiritual societies.

In many memory institutions of the Western World, including libraries and museums, focus is often placed on the informational content and physical attributes, or artifactual value, of collected materials.  Preservation policies are primarily concerned with the maintenance of these two things, either through reformatting to preserve textual information, or repairs and environmental controls to ensure continued existence of their physical structure (Foot, 19). However, it is necessary to look beyond the physical and informational aspects of objects in order to ensure we are also preserving the integrity of the spiritual or cultural values which may be fundamental in defining the object.   
 
Concerns arise when actions taken to preserve the physical object may compromise the spiritual or cultural integrity of a given object.  Artifacts, including books, throughout history and the present were created and utilized according to rules and taboos that may not be inherently understood in today's world of mass consumer goods and material culture.  While not all books, documents, and artifacts have rituals or socially constructed beliefs associated with their continued existence, it is a relevant issue for many cultural and religious collections.

== Examples ==

An extreme example of how efforts to physically preserve may compromise the socially constructed meaning of the object is the [[Shinto]] Shrines of Ise Jingu, in [[Japan]] (Maré, 2004).  These shrines are of significant cultural and spiritual value to the Japanese people, but every twenty years since the time of Emperor Temmu in the 7th century C.E. the buildings are completely destroyed and rebuilt.  The rebuilding process is based on descriptions in the Documents on the rituals of the Great Shrine of Ise which dates from 804 C.E. and ensures that the recreations are exact replicas of the shrines taken down.  Physical preservation of these monuments would damage the spiritual and cultural integrity of the process and purpose behind the continuous rebuilding.

Similarly, in the [[Buddhist]] faith, materials are considered to have a life, which must be allowed to progress and end naturally.  Impermanence (anitya) in the Buddhist faith relates to the natural end of all things, [[nirvana]], and acts of physical preservation would be contrary to this belief (Karlström). Buddhist [[Conservation of South Asian household shrines|shrines]] are an example of such items that hold spiritual meaning. 

Physical preservation can also work to maintain spiritual and culture integrity of an object, especially in the case of musical instruments.  At the violin museum in [[Cremona, Italy]], nine instruments crafted by the [[Amatis]], [[Guarneris]], and by Antonio [[Stradivari]] are played ceremoniously six days a week – both to keep them in good physical, playable condition, and to maintain their cultural significance and meaning.  From the island of [[Java]] in [[Indonesia]], the instruments of the [[gamelan]] are treated with respect and reverence, and played on a regular basis to maintain their physical and spiritual life.  They are played only for certain occasions and only by certain individuals trained in the art.  They must also be handled and stored with care to be sure no one should compromise their spiritual integrity by stepping over them.  (Kartomi and Mendonça) Gamelan instruments can be found in museums throughout North America, but to accurately remain gamelan instruments, they must be treated and respected according to both their physical and spiritual properties.

However, examples of the significance of meaning and spiritual integrity exist in North America as well.  ''[[Jish]]'' is a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] medicine bundle used in religious rituals related to curing or prevention, and specific care and established provenance is necessary to preserve the existence of ''jish'' versus a simple bundle of herb and grasses.  [[NAGPRA]], or North American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act has helped to highlight this issue of meaning and spiritual integrity in the United States.  The act not only covers objects and remains recovered from American Indian graves, but the subsequent literary material developed based on the examination and analysis of these objects.  (Grose)

Preservation of meaning is perhaps most relevant and recognized in museum collections, but this does not mean there are not key books and documents that are defined by their social construction as well as their physical existence.  When a book printed on acid paper turns to dust, there is no doubt that it ceases to exist as book.  However, when books are stacked on top of a [[Koran]], or a [[Guru Granth Sahib]] is repaired rather than ceremoniously cremated, the spiritual integrity of these texts is compromised or destroyed, and the physical object is void of spiritual or cultural meaning.  It may at this point actually cease to be what it had been previously identified as, at least in terms of its cultural or spiritual meaning.

Admittedly, more work and research needs to be done in regard to  preservation of meaning in the area of Library Science.  However, it is necessary for libraries and archival institutions to assess their preservation priorities in consideration of social and cultural meaning in tandem with physical attributes and informational context.  Preservation and curatorial policies and activities can take into account how materials are housed, handled, repaired, or analyzed not just in terms of preserving physical qualities, but spiritual and cultural meaning as well.

'''Pythaids''' were ritual processions of the [[Athenian]]s to [[Delphi]], in remembrance of the initial journey of [[Apollo]] from [[Delos]] to [[Delphi]] through [[Athens]].

==Description==
The Pythaids were "theories", i.e. processions of the Athenians to Delphi. They took place in non canonical periods, usually following specific omens. The Pythaids that we know best of were four particularly majestic processions which took place between 138/7 – 98/7 B.C. They constituted a clear effort of the Athenians to link their ancestral myths to the Apollonian mythology.

The starting point of the Pythaids remains unknown; however the literary sources mention that they were already taking place in the 4th century B.C. It seems that they were interrupted in the 3rd century B.C., but they started again in the 2nd century B.C., in a period when [[Athens]] regained its prestige with the generous benefactions of the Hellenistic kings of Asia Minor.

Our main sources for the Pythaids remain the lengthy inscriptions which were carved on the external walls of the [[Athenian Treasury]],&lt;ref&gt;Syll.&amp;#179; [http://attalus.org/docs/sig2/s696.html 696-699] and [http://attalus.org/docs/sig2/s711.html 711], Greek inscriptions in English translation&lt;/ref&gt; recording the names of the participants and other useful detail. As far as literary sources are concerned, the main testimony belongs to [[Strabo]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], Geography, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/9B*.html#2.11 9.2.11]&lt;/ref&gt; who mentions [[Aelius Aristides]] and Ephoros, as well as the lexicographers. 
Furthermore, a careful reading of the Delphic Hymns to Apollo illuminates the mythological connections that the Athenians tried to establish. Thus, [[Apollo]] is born under an olive tree, the sacred tree of the goddess [[Athena]], a fact which reflects the Athenian supremacy over the [[Delian League]] and its treasury. 
Furthermore, the tragedy "Ion" by [[Euripides]] aims at justifying the worship of Apollo "patroos" in Athens: Kreousa, mother of Ion, falls victim of rape by Apollo. She abandons the newborn in a remote region, from where Hermes, under order of Apollo, transfers him to Delphi, to be brought up by [[Pythia]]. 
The land route between Athens and Delphi is said to have been opened for the purpose of facilitating the Athenians to visit the sanctuary of Apollo. It was said that this road was full of bandits, that Theseus managed to disperse.

The particularly majestic procession of 138/7 B.C. is a token of the  ambition of the Athenians to demonstrate their renewed control over Delos through the clerouchies. The participation of officials and plain citizens in so large numbers aimed at manifesting a unified and unbreachable citizen body, consisting of free citizens.

==The rituals==
The exact rituals which took place are more or less unknown to us. It seems, however, that upon the arrival of the procession to Delphi the participants offered presents to the god, among which a tripod. Then a ritual cleansing took place, which was accomplished with the use of fire, which the Athenians took them back to their city by means of a torch. An effort was made to identify the rituals with historic and mythological events, such as the killing of Python, paralleled to the defeat of the Gauls in the 3rd century B.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7335">'''Queer anti-urbanism''' is a term used within the field of [[queer studies]] to describe theoretical viewpoints which challenge the validity of the assertion that [[queer]] identity/practice(s) is inseparable from the [[Urban area|urban]].&lt;ref name=Another&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herring|first1=Scott|title=Another Country. ; Queer Anti-Urbanism.|date=2010|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814737194|pages=13|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described by Scott Herring, who largely popularized the term, queer anti-urbanism is “a means to critically negotiate the relentless [[urbanism]]s that often characterize any [[United States]] based “[[gay]] imaginary,” an imaginary ‘in which  the city represents a beacon of tolerance and [[gay community]], the country a locus of [[Violence against LGBT people|persecution]] and gay absence."&lt;ref name="Another"/&gt;

In this sense, queer anti-urbanism may be best cast as [[Criticism|critical]] opposition to the ideals of [[homonormative]] and metronormative ways of life.&lt;ref name=Herring&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herring|first1=Scott|title=Out of the Closets, Into the Woods: RFD, Country Women, and the Post-Stonewall Emergence of Queer Anti-urbanism|journal=American Quarterly|date=June 2007|volume=59|issue=2|pages=341–372|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/aq/summary/v059/59.2herring.html|accessdate=9 December 2014|doi=10.1353/aq.2007.0043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Queer metronormativity==
[[Jack Halberstam]] articulates queer metronormativity in relation to the dominant "story of migration from 'country' to 'town,'" "a spatial narrative within which the subject moves to a place of tolerance after enduring life in a place of suspicion, persecution, and secrecy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halberstam|first1=Judith|title=In a queer time and place transgender bodies, subcultural lives|date=2005|publisher=New York Univ. Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814735855}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative purports that the only means for [[LGBT community|queer community]], happiness, or open existence is within the city.&lt;ref name=Jerke&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jerke|first1=Bud|title=Queer Ruralism|journal=Harvard Journal of Law and Gender|date=2011|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; This narrative inherently devalues rural existence with urban [[stereotypes]] and myths of rural life. Rural people are commonly depicted in media and otherwise as un-intelligent, dirty, and intolerant.&lt;ref name="Jerke"/&gt; The stereotypes and myths persist largely on well publicized instances of rural [[Hate crime|hate-violence]] (Brandon Teena), which confirm stereotypes of rural people, generally, as violent [[bigots]] and rural queers as only victims.&lt;ref name="Jerke"/&gt; The propagation and persistence of these myths lend themselves to the assumption that rural queer people do not and cannot exist.&lt;ref name="Jerke"/&gt;

Queer people who live happily in rural areas are thus “denied existence” under the dominant lens of metronormativity.&lt;ref name="Jerke"/&gt; The effect of this invisibility is evident in the media, (most) academic, and judicial depictions of gay identity. Even on television shows, the representations of queer life show that rural queers are [[oppressed]], while urban queers flourish.&lt;ref name="Jerke"/&gt; The cumulative effect of this narrative and rural invisibility is that queer-rural-urban-migration is socially constructed as compulsory.&lt;ref name="Herring"/&gt;

Further, metronormativity not only deems urban migration compulsory, but also following the norms of metronormative/homonormative gay culture is constructed as compulsory.&lt;ref name="Herring"/&gt; Herring asserts that these norms can be divided into four categories that encapsulate metronormativity, the categories being the [[Narrative|narratological]], the [[racial]], the [[socioeconomic]], and the [[aesthetic]].&lt;ref name="Herring"/&gt; In order to “properly” construct oneself as urban, even if already in an urban environment, one must dress the “right” way, make enough money to participate in gay male [[consumer culture]], and effectively be white, or one fails at metronormativity.&lt;ref name="Herring"/&gt; Failing at metronormativity seemingly confirms the myths and stereotypes of the rural which a metronormative worldview purports. Thus, the performance of metronormativelty perpetuates itself by encouraging rural queers to hide their origins and conform to metronormativity, further erasing rural queer life and visibility.&lt;ref name="Jerke"/&gt;

Metronormativity operates upon the false [[dichotomy]] of rural/urban queer existence. It assumes that while the two differ, there is no difference between queer lives in different urban areas and definitely not any difference between queer life in different rural areas (because it also presupposes that there is no queer life in rural areas).&lt;ref name=Stapel&gt;{{cite conference |first=Christopher |last=Stapel |title=Reclaiming Rural Ruralities: (Anti)Metronormative (De)Colinization of Rural Space and Place |format=doc |conference=American Sociological Association Annual Meeting, Hilton Atlanta and Atlanta Marriott Marquis |date=14 August 2010 |location=Atlanta GA |url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/4/1/2/2/8/p412289_index.html?phpsessid=u859dh2prri66enh31qjk5lt37 |access-date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical rusticity==
Queer Anti-Urbanism actualizes itself as argument and practice in a variety of ways, which Herring refers to as Critical Rusticity.&lt;ref name="Another"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herring"/&gt; In opposition to the white-male centric, upper-middle class, (metronormative) culture that dominates many ”gay” urban areas, many women formed rural, all female “Lesbian Separatist” communities.&lt;ref name="Herring"/&gt;  In these cases women consciously spurned “the city” for rural alternatives to the subjugated status they were forced to inhabit under metronormative white-male [[gay culture]].&lt;ref name="Herring"/&gt; This is opposite narrative to gay rural urban migration provides a narrative of Queer Anti-Urbanism in the sense that the values of metronormativity are defied and a rural, but very queer, new [[value system]] is put in its place.&lt;ref name="Herring"/&gt; Similarly, Rural Fairie Digest and Country Women were publications which publicly eschewed Urban life in lieu of a distinctly rural queer life. These publications countered rural queer erasure, provided alternatives to gay consumer culture by providing ‘how to’s’ on [[DIY]] ‘country skills,’ and to some extent provided rural queer community, even for people who were geographically isolated.&lt;ref name="Herring"/&gt; Also, rural people who simply live different lives and have queer identities or desires defy metronormativity by disrupting the expectation of what it means to be queer. Asserting queer identity in a rural place that does not happen to line up with what queer identity is “supposed to” look like in an urban setting is powerfully anti-urban, because it makes visible the opposite possibility of metronormativity: differences in rural queer life and urban queer life may not be accounted for by deficiency, but merely value neutral difference.&lt;ref name="Stapel"/&gt;

The terminology was revived two millenniums later as a result of Twentieth Century efforts to comprehend patterns of diffuse but coherent political power.

'''''Rat-Man''''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] comic about an inept [[superhero]] of the same name, created by [[Leonardo Ortolani]] in [[1989 in comics|1989]]. Although it was initially meant to be a satire of other superheroes, most prominently [[Batman]], it has since evolved into an independent comic sporting a complex, evolving [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]]. The comic is well known for its nonsense [[humor]] à-la [[Monty Python]], its engaging storytelling and its frequent breaking of the [[fourth wall]]. Ortolani often pays both direct and indirect tribute to other comic authors ([[Jack Kirby]] above everyone else) and he frequently makes his characters use pop-culture references, either generic or specific to the native Italian context and background. The comic was published by [[Panini Comics]] as new installments under the name of ''Rat-Man Collection'' (closed with issue #122) and is currently being published as reprints of older stories in ''Tutto Rat-Man'' and ''Rat-Man Gigante''.

==Publishing history==
The character of Rat-Man appeared for the first time in the second issue of ''Spot'', a supplement to the Italian magazine ''L'Eternauta'' #86 of June 1990, shortly after Leonardo Ortolani won a young artists' contest. From 1990 to 1995 Rat-Man was published on the [[fanzine]] ''Made in USA''. After the debut, Leo Ortolani chose to [[self-publishing|self-publish]] the comic alongside his primary job as a [[geologist]]; however, in 1997 Leo signed a contract with [[Marvel Italia]], today a brand owned by [[Panini Comics]] (and, at the time, a branch of [[Marvel Comics]] itself), to publish the comic under the Marvel brand, which allowed Leonardo to become a full-time comics author. The contract also allowed him to use popular Marvel characters like [[Captain America]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] in Rat-Man stories; however, [[copyright]] problems have since prohibited such use of characters in the Rat-Man world.

Leo Ortolani stated his intention to close the series with issue #100, which would be published around January 2014 if no changes are made to the current bi-monthly publishing schedule. He later on remarked how this was a joke not to be taken seriously (as on Rat-Man #92), and that the series would have ended after #100. In fact in 2016 Ortolani stated his intention to really close the series with issue #122, which was published around September 2017.

==Structure of the Comic==
Rat-Man was born as a parody of [[Batman]], which is reflected in his name, in his gadgets and in the details of his first story. For example, while Bruce Wayne took inspiration from a bat coming through his window, Deboroh took inspiration after a similar search from his weekly [[Mickey Mouse]] comic. They both lost their parents at a young age, both vowed to fight crime to avenge them and both inherited a large fortune with which they fund their activities. Rat-Man even had a sidekick named Topin (Topo, in [[Italian language|Italian]], means mouse) who was clearly inspired by [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].
Rat-Man's stories were initially either classical superhero stories, with the main character fighting various supervillains to save his city, or, sometimes, the world, or parodies of famous works of fiction. Sometimes, there would be stories revealing Rat-Man's past and troubled origins as a superhero. Lately, the "normal" superhero stories have been abandoned in favour of telling his present problems as he struggles to find his identity. The parody stories continue as usual, often used to break between story arcs.
Among the parodied works, there are [[Star Trek]], [[Star Wars]], [[300 (comic)|300]], [[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]], the [[Lord of the Rings]] trilogy, 007, and many others.

==Summary of Rat-Man adventures==

===Before Rat-Boy===
In Rat-Man's universe, two entities fight against each other: the Light, representing all that is good and pure, and the Shadow, a force of evil and corruption. After the Second World War, the First Secret Squad, a team of superheroes led by the Pipistrello (bat), combats for truth and justice backed by the Light, in an age of great prosperity and peace. After this failure, in 1954, the Shadow abandons the current vessel it had to take the body of the criminal boss Boda Valker, and contaminates his son, Janus, as well. Despite the best efforts of Samuel Krik, then a simple cop but already affiliated with the Light, the child is irrimediably corrupted, and is taken by his father to be trained as his successor.

Under Boda's leadership, the Shadow instills fear in the heart of the No Name Country, who starts to doubt the superheroes. Feeling that they are manipulated, the First Secret Squad quits and is subsequently killed by the traitor Lupo (wolf) in 1965. Two years later, Deboroh la Roccia is born.

===Rat-Boy===
Deboroh is not an intelligent child, but he is well-meaning and willing to become a superhero after reading their adventures in comic books. He is taken in an orphanage after being lost by his parents in a mall sale, and he is rescued by Janus Valker, who believes him to be his son. However, this is a lie installed in his brain by his brother, the insane Joba, in order to control him and make him weak with the affection for someone. Janus falls for it and becomes attached to the child, despite being very stupid. The young Deboroh still carries his dream to become a superhero.

In the meantime, the Shadow, through its agents and the scientific research centre Elsewhere, in which Janus works, is planning the Second Secret Squad in order to control the nation and influence it. Since the program involves total anonymity, Janus has Deboroh join it as Rat-Boy as a way to fulfill his wish to become a superhero and protect him from the Shadow, who is constantly seeking to further corrupt him.
The Second Squad, led by Wolf, however, fails to unite the nation and is seen as a tool of the government. They also clash with the Men in Tights, heroes who spontaneously embraced the teachings of the First Secret Squad and consider themselves the true heirs of their legacy. The No Name Country loses faith in superheroes.

In 1984, Rat-Boy quits the squad. Janus contacts him one last time after he discovers Joba's deception in order to erase from both minds any memory of the other. He hopes that by doing so they can escape and rebuild new lives. Unfortunately, after using the machine, Joba reaches them to kill them. The Shadow has abandoned Boda for the failure of the Second Squad, and his seeking a new vessel. Joba wants to make sure that he is chosen by eliminating Janus. In a bloody showdown, the two brothers clash and Joba is defeated. Janus buys Rat-Boy some time by embracing the Shadow and becoming its vessel, and letting him escape. Rat-Boy flees to No Name City, where the effects of the machine finally kick in and he forgets much about his past life. The Shadow loses track of him, and the only tool that it has to find him again is his mental track, which is hidden by Janus' wife, Kalissa, who has gone into hiding.

===MarvelMouse===
Deboroh becomes MarvelMouse, a superhero who fights in the Arena, a brutish coliseum where the last remaining superheroes fight for the crowd's amusement. Their kind is dying, being replaced by the newer and more stylish manga, but MarvelMouse's determination and goodwill convince one of the last agents of the Light, only known as Teacher, to end his reclusion and train him as a proper superhero. The Teacher, who had mentored the First Secret Squad, helps him embrace his potential, and MarvelMouse becomes Rat-Man.

In his last fight in the arena, Rat-Man is pitted against the Dragon, the greatest of the manga, who wants to kill him to end all superheroes. Just as he is defeated by him, Rat-Man realizes that his destiny is to help the nation, not to fight in the Arena. Before his demise, though, he is saved by the other remaining superhero, the Man With A Spider Costume. With their triumph, the country remembers the superheroes and Rat-Man starts fighting crime.

However, Janus, who is now fully under the Shadow, seeks to destroy him with the Guardian, a colossal robot built to eliminate the First Squad and abandoned after the same goal was accomplished through other means. When the Guardian detects a new superhero, it is sent to kill him. In fact, it detected the rebirth of the Teacher as Pipistrello: he had escaped the destruction of the Secret Squad and lived since then in hiding blaming himself for the failure and death of his comrades. The Guardian kills him, but not before he leaves his legacy to Rat-Man.

===Rat-Man===
Though initially unwelcome, Rat-Man, with the help of Samuel Krik, becomes the last remaining superhero apart from the Second Secret Squad, which is still controlled by the Shadow, and starts protecting the city from many threats, such as the demon of desire Tefnut, the devourer of worlds Cosmicus and the publisher-gone-mad Spider. He inherits everything the Teacher had, including the wealthy Fuffa Corporation and butler Archibald, befriends Tadeus Brakko, and is the object of lust of transsexual Cinzia. This is the period when he is in his prime, and the animated series is set during it.

However, the Shadow still conspires to bring him down. Using the Buffoon, Rat-Man's first enemy, Janus Valker tries to destroy the Second Secret Squad in order to make space for the Third one. However, Rat-Man and his former teammates foil his plan, with all the others deciding to quit crimefighting after the confrontation. Rat-Man remains as the only superhero.

A while later, Kalissa uses the mental track to contact Rat-Man and convince him to participate in a cloning program led by the former scientists of Elsewhere. The project is to create an army of clones of Rat-Man to act as a powerful force of good, but the plan goes awry when Number Six, one of the clones, mutates and gains too much conscience. He frees the original Rat-Man, who stops the program. Hindered, Kalissa and the other scientists contact Janus to seek his help with the project, but they are unaware of how much he has changed.

Valker has fully embraced the Shadow and wallows in the complete knowledge it offered to him. However, the Shadow still conceals some information to him, and Janus, who craves omniscience, is forced to seek Rat-Man on its request in order to gain it. When the other scientists find him and reveal that they have the mental track, he takes it away from them and murders them brutally. After making sure that Rat-Man is completely unaware of their shared past, he deletes that information from his brain as well.

===Demise and Rebirth===
Rat-Man, in 2003, enters a coma which he comes out of in 2005. In the meantime, the city has forgotten him and replaced him with many new superheroes, and he struggles to fit in again. All the new superheroes, however, flee when the Guardian, sensing activity of the Light, returns to the No Name City. Rat-Man realizes that the existence of a supervillain is inextricably tied to the presence of a superhero, and, being the last one, he stops donning a mask to save the city. Without a purpose, he retires to private life.

This is in fact a ploy orchestrated by Valker, who is slowly destroying him. After robbing him of his secret identity, he drives the Fuffa Corporation to bankruptcy and undermines the faith of the nation in superheroes. Rat-Man tries to return with an animated series but it is shallow and it worsens his conditions. He becomes a hobo, ready to be devoured by the Shadow, but with the help of Krik, Brakko, Cinzia and his fan club, he overcomes it. Janus is further stopped by the last lingering memory of being Deboroh's father, his last sliver of humanity which prevents him to take the life of his adopted son.

Though he has defeated the Shadow, Rat-Man still struggles to return to his golden years and travels to New York to seek counsel from its superheroes, the comic book adventures of which inspired him to become one in the first place. After meeting them, however, he understands something is wrong: the villains are all gone, and the superheroes ostracize Wallcrawler, one of the more famous ones, for some obscure reason. Rat-Man finds out that they have all exhausted their purpose and are remaining fearing what lies beyond and addicted to their power. Rat-Man's efforts finally convince them to follow their due course and retire willingly, with a parting advice to him: when all the fights are over, he should know when to stop and not be afraid of stepping out. Full of hope, Rat-Man returns to No Name City.

===Future===
Leonardo Ortolani has often stated his desire to end the series with the comic book number 100. This will occur in 2014, which is also the year in which the Shadow is expected to find a new vessel. In 1954 it had taken Boda Valker, abandoning the previous body it had held since 1924, and in 1984 it took Janus Valker. Krik, an agent of the Light, is already preparing for this event.

==Main characters==

===Rat-Man===
[[File:Romics 2012 04.JPG|thumb|Rat-Man statue at the [[Romics]] 2012.]]
A.k.a. Rat-Boy, Marvelmouse, Deboroh Valker or Deboroh la Roccia, he is always the main character of the story. He has no powers, no abilities and no intelligence, but his goodwill and greatness of heart compensate for this. Although he isn't very clever or strong, he has somehow managed to fend off many terrible threats against No Name City. Due to his character taking inspiration from a mouse, he harbors an unnatural and extremely violent hatred for cats.

===Cinzia Otherside===
Originally a postman with the name of Paul, she is a transgender woman who loves Rat-Man. Her coming out as such is deeply related with Marvelmouse's realization of being Rat-Man. She has tried to marry him and seduce him over the years, to no avail.

===Tadeus Brakko===
An African-American police inspector, he is Rat-Man's best friend, and easily his only one. He was the only person to support Rat-Man after coming out of the coma and he has great faith in him. Probably it helps their friendship that he is almost as dimwitted as Rat-Man himself, not even realizing, in certain circumstances, Rat-Man's racial prejudices against him. His wife, Clara, constantly cheats on him but loves him deeply as well. They have a son, who is in fact son of the postman. His physical appearance is based upon [[Danny Glover]]'s character Sgt. Murtaugh in the [[Lethal Weapon]] series.

===Captain Krik===
Head of No Name City's police force, he often employs Rat-Man in missions and is a friend of his, although he is a lot more sceptical of his abilities than Brakko. When Rat-Man started to become a superhero, he was the only one in the police force to correctly identify him as an aid and not a threat to crime-fighting. During the second coming of the Cat, he willingly abandoned the city to train with the Light, the organization bent on stopping the Shadow. His return to the city is instrumental in saving Rat-Man from his own dark side. As the name suggests, he is based upon [[Captain Kirk]] of [[Star Trek]] fame.

===Thea===
The only woman who Rat-Man ever truly loved, she appeared in only one comic book, where she died. She was the most advanced experiment of Doctor Denam, who was also one of the authors of Abbard's Second Squad Project. The Doctor's plan was to create a super race of sentient vegetable humanoids. In the end, he was killed by his first creation, the imperfect Primus, and Rat-Man only managed to escape thanks to Thea, who Denam had created out of a rose. She dies in the end of that book, and her memory haunts Rat-Man forever. His lifelong struggle to find a partner ends then in pornography (twice), but Thea's image saves him from brutish desire. She also was his wife in a parallel universe, had things gone slightly differently, and she was never forgotten by Rat-Man, even appearing in his fantasy as his final dream at the age of 80.

===Archibald===
Rat-Man's butler, he is one of the very few who knows of his dual identity and activities. Despite Rat-Man's antics and stupidity, he always remains by his side and helps him, even when his master loses his fortune. He is another element that proves Rat-Man's origin as parody of Batman, as he is clearly inspired from [[Alfred Pennyworth]].

==Notable Antagonists==

===Janus Valker===
Rat-Man's nemesis was once his adoptive father, although now he is only the vessel for the Shadow. He and Rat-Man have clashed many times, with the hero always, in some way, emerging victorious. However, it is hinted in the stories that his good and compassionate self, who cared for Deboroh and tried to protect him, is still alive within Janus' conscience, and is till trying to protect his adoptive son. Janus' father, Boda Valker, was also a vessel for the Shadow.

===The Shadow===
An ominous and manipulative entity, the Shadow needs a body to control in order to live, in exchange for power or knowledge. The Shadow controls the Government of the Nation in which Rat-Man lives, and is constantly trying to tighten its grip on its citizens, mainly through the Superheroes and their Secret Squads. Three incarnations of this squad have been formed during the years to control the Nation. The current body is Janus Valker, although the Shadow has tried to corrupt Rat-Man to use as vessel.

===The Buffoon===
Rat-Man's very first enemy, he is an obvious parody of Batman's [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. He is later revealed to be Nottolo, the member of the Second Secret Squad who was kicked out to make space for Rat-Boy, and has always resented the hero for this.

===The Spider===
Bitten by a radioactive man, he acquired human characteristics such as greed and lack of scruples. He was a comic publisher until he was brought down by Rat-Man. The hero, later on, must travel in the past to defeat him again with the help of the poorly disguised [[Fantastic Four]], as he was a temporal anomaly.

===The Cat===
She is the physical embodiment of pleasure and desire, and as such she is very dangerous and ruthless. She has been stranded on our world and tried to return to her sisters through a series of bloody and murderous rituals. The hero, however, managed to stop her.

===MasterMouse===
He is the creation of an unknown scientist and is a perfect replica of Ratman. His sole purpose is to aid in the destruction of Ratman and all he stands for. The hero has a difficult time trying to stop his archrival since they have the same powers.

==The Secret Squads==
The First Secret Squad, a league of extraordinary individuals who fought crime during peacetime and in the [[Second World War]], inspired a generation's dream for justice and helped control the Nation. The eventually disbanded when they felt that the Government, controlled by the Shadow, was trying too hard to manipulate them, and, for this defection, they were murdered.
The original members are:
* Saetta (Lightning Bolt)
* Ripulitore (Cleaner)
* Fantasma Azzurro (Blue Ghost)
* Pipistrello (Bat)
* Tròteo (Troutish)
After fighting the Second World War, they accepted a younger Lupo (Wolf) as a new member. He was the only one to survive the murder, probably because he was an instrument of the Shadow, as it was later revealed.

The Second Secret Squad was made by genetically engineering the DNA of unborn babies, who were then trained to become a new Secret Squad and control the Nation instead of the Shadow. They were trying to emulate the older squad, and thus have similar names and costumes. They were
* Fulmine (Lightning, emulating Saetta)
* Tresh ("Trash", emulating Ripulitore)
* Spettro (Wraith, emulating Fantasma Azzurro)
* Nottolo (Noctule, emulating Pipistrello)
* Karpa (Karp, emulating Troteo).
Nottolo was almost immediately kicked out in favour of Rat-Man. The whole squad was led by Lupo, but they failed to create the same kind of national unity that the First Squad achieved and disbanded.

The Shadow, however, didn't give up on the project and prepared a Third Secret Squad, who is only seen on a poster shown by Janus Valker. In order to make space for the new one, the Shadow used Nottolo and Lupo to dispose of the Second Squad, but Rat-Man foiled their plan and the whole idea was finally abandoned. Spettro was originally and unwillingly chosen to be the leader of the Third Squad, as she was the daughter of Lupo. It is also thanks to her help that Rat-Man stops the sinister project.

==Animated series==
A Rat-Man animated series has been produced by the Italian public television company [[RAI]] and Stranemani Animation Studios. Up to now 52 episodes have been made, each 13 minutes long. The series is currently being aired on Saturday mornings in Italy and on occasional weekday afternoons in North America during the "Cartoni" segment on the [[Rai Italia|RAI International]] satellite channel. An official website of the production is available,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ratman.rai.it/R2_HPprogramma/0,,1067087,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; in it surfers can see a selection of episodes in video streaming, albeit the dialogue is just in Italian the linear nature of the plots and the visual gags can offer a rewarding experience even to non-Italian speakers.
The series focuses on the "normal" superhero routine of Rat-Man, who has to defeat various threats to No Name City, and is therefore located within the timeline after he has become Rat-Man and before he fell into a coma.

In 2008, a film titled '''''Rat-Man - Il segreto del supereroe''''' was released. It is divided into five episodes entitled ''The Superhero'', ''Mousetrap'', ''Copyrat'', ''Fraudolent'' and ''To Rat or Not to Rat''.

[[File:RasBeyrouth.jpg|thumb|245px|The [[Solidere]] development of the [[Beirut]] seafront and harbor]]
[[File:Netherlands, The Hague, Boekelermeerstraat.JPG|thumb|245px|In the [[Netherlands]], virtually all housing is developed and built through property developers, including development in upmarket segments.]]

'''Real estate development''', or '''property development''', is a [[business process]], encompassing activities that range from the [[renovation]] and re-[[lease]] of existing [[building]]s to the purchase of raw [[Real Estate|land]] and the sale of [[developed land]] or parcels to others. Real estate developers are the people and companies who coordinate all of these activities, converting ideas from paper to real [[property]].&lt;ref name="Frej, Anne B 2003. p. 3"&gt;Frej, Anne B &amp; Peiser, Richard B. ''Professional Real Estate Development, Second Edition: The ULI Guide to the Business''. Urban Land Institute, 2003. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Real estate development is different from [[construction]], although many developers also manage the construction process.

Developers buy land, finance real estate deals, build or have builders build projects, create, imagine, control, and orchestrate the process of development from the beginning to end.&lt;ref name=NYT16Mar63&gt;New York Times, March 16, 1963, "Personality Boom is Loud for Louis Lesser"&lt;/ref&gt; Developers usually take the greatest [[risk]] in the creation or renovation of real estate—and receive the greatest rewards. Typically, developers purchase a tract of land, determine the [[marketing]] of the property, develop the building program and design, obtain the necessary public approval and financing, build the structures, and rent out, manage, and ultimately sell it.&lt;ref name="Frej, Anne B 2003. p. 3"/&gt;

Sometimes property developers will only undertake part of the process. For example, some developers source a property and get the plans and permits approved before selling the property with the plans and permits to a builder at a premium price. Alternatively, a developer that is also a builder may purchase a property with the plans and permits in place so that they do not have the risk of failing to obtain planning approval and can start construction on the development immediately.

Developers work with many different counterparts along each step of this process, including architects, city planners, engineers, surveyors, inspectors, contractors, lawyers, leasing agents, etc. In the [[Town and Country Planning]] context in the United Kingdom, 'development' is defined in the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]] s55.

==Credentials==
Many aspects of the real estate development process require local or state licensing, such as acting as a real estate broker or sales agent along. A real estate developer is not a professional designation, there are no schools or associations who recognize or protect the term as a trademark. Some real estate developers, often those involved in marketing properties through traditional real estate channels, choose to join business associations such as [[SIOR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://commercialobserver.com/2018/04/why-an-sior-designation-is-a-must-for-cre-professionals/|title=Why an SIOR Designation Is a Must for CRE Professionals|date=2018-04-16|work=Commercial Observer|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paths for entering the development field==
{{Main|Real estate development education}}
No single path automatically leads to success in real estate development.  Developers come from a variety of disciplines— construction, urban planning, lending, architecture, law and accounting, among others.  Recent specialized programs that award a [[Master of Real Estate Development]] (MRED) degree are also available. The graduate programs in real estate development are the most comprehensive education in the [[real estate industry]].  Other formal education includes a [[Master of Science in Real Estate]] (MSRE), or an [[MBA]].

==Organizing for development==
A development team can be put together in one of several ways.  At one extreme, a large company might include many services, from architecture to engineering.  At the other end of the spectrum, a development company might consist of one principal and a few staff who hire or contract with other companies and professionals for each service as needed.

Assembling a team of professionals to address the environmental, economic, private, physical and political issues inherent in a complex development project is critical. A developer's success depends on the ability to coordinate and lead the completion of a series of interrelated activities efficiently and at the appropriate time.

Development process requires skills of many professionals: [[architect]]s, [[landscape architect]]s, [[civil engineer]]s and [[site planner]]s to address project design; [[market consultant]]s to determine demand and a project's economics; [[Lawyer|attorneys]] to handle agreements and [[government approval]]s; [[Environmental consulting|environmental consultant]]s and [[Geotechnical engineering|soils engineer]]s to analyze a site's physical limitations and [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental impacts]]; [[surveyor]]s and [[Title insurance|title]] companies to provide [[legal description]]s of a property; and [[lender]]s to provide financing. The [[general contractor]] of the project hires [[subcontractor]]s to put the [[architectural plan]]s into action.

==Land development==
{{Further|Land development}}
Purchasing unused land for a potential development is sometimes called '''[[speculation|speculative]] development'''.

[[Subdivision (land)|Subdivision]] of land is the principal mechanism by which communities are developed.  Technically, subdivision describes the legal and physical steps a developer must take to convert raw land into developed land.  Subdivision is a vital part of a community's growth, determining its appearance, the mix of its land uses, and its infrastructure, including [[road]]s, [[drainage]] systems, [[water supply|water]], [[sewerage]], and [[public utilities]].

Land development can pose the most risk, but can also be the most [[profitable]] technique as it is dependent on the [[public sector]] for approvals and infrastructure and because it involves a long investment period with no positive [[cash flow]].

After subdivision is complete, the developer usually markets the land to a home builder or other end user, for such uses as a [[warehouse]] or [[shopping center]]. In any case, use of [[Spatial intelligence (business method)|spatial intelligence]] tools mitigate the risk of these developers by modeling the population trends and demographic make-up of the sort of customers a home builder or retailer would like to have surrounding their new development.

'''Ricardo E. Alegría Gallardo'''{{efn|{{Spanish name|Alegría|Gallardo|plain=yes}}}} (April 14, 1921 – July 7, 2011) was a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[scholar]], cultural [[anthropologist]] and [[archeologist]] known as the "father of modern Puerto Rican [[archaeology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wapa.tv/noticias/especiales/5-dias-de-duelo-por-muerte-de-don-ricardo-alegria_20110707091109.html |title=5 días de duelo por muerte de Don Ricardo Alegría |publisher=[[WAPA-TV]] |first=Efrén |last=Arroyo |language=Spanish |date={{date|2011-07-07|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2014-01-01|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Ricardo Alegría was born in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], where he received his primary and secondary education. His father, [[José S. Alegría]], was a former Vice President and founding member of the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party]]. It was Alegría's father who instilled him with a sense of love and pride for Puerto Rico, [[history of Puerto Rico|its history]], and [[culture of Puerto Rico|culture]].{{efn|Smithsonian Institution (2004) "I was greatly motivated by my father, the writer Jose Alegría, who taught me to dearly love Puerto Rico and to be proud of our history and culture."&lt;ref name="smithsonian-bio-2004" /&gt;}}  In 1941 at the [[University of Puerto Rico]], together with Yamil Galib, Alegría founded a new fraternity, Alpha Beta Chi.{{efn|''[[Caribbean Business]]'' (2011) "Alegría earned his bachelor’s degree in archeology in 1942 at the University of Puerto Rico, where he founded the Alpha Beta Chi fraternity [...]"&lt;ref name="caribbean-business-2011-alegria-dead" /&gt;}} In 1942, Alegría earned his Bachelor of Science degree in archeology from the University of Puerto Rico. He continued his academic education in the [[University of Chicago]] where in 1947 he earned his master's in Anthropology and History. In 1954, Alegría earned his Ph.D (doctorate) in Anthropology from [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="smithsonian-bio-2004" /&gt;

==Legacy and death==
Alegría was named the first director of the [[Institute of Puerto Rican Culture]] by [[Luis Muñoz Marín]], Puerto Rico's first elected governor.  He was responsible for the creation of the "Archaeological Center of Investigation of the University of Puerto Rico"(UPR).  Alegría also created the "Center of Popular Arts of the Puerto Rican Cultural Institute", the program of publication of books of the institute, and created the logo for the Institute of Neurobiology in Puerto Rico.

Alegría was responsible for the renovation and restoration of historical [[Old San Juan]] under the leadership of then San Juan mayor [[Felisa Rincón de Gautier]]. He is also responsible for the restoration of the ruins of "[[Caparra Archaeological Site|Caparra]]" and "Fort San Jeronimo". As a result of his work "Old San Juan" was declared a "Historical World Treasure". In 1976, Alegría opened the "Center of Advanced Studies of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean". In 1992, he established the "Museum of the Americas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prpop.org/biografias/r_bios/ricardo_alegria.shtml|title=Ricardo Alegría|publisher=Fundación Nacional para la Cultura Popular|language=Spanish|date=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alegría is considered a pioneer in the [[Anthropology|anthropologic]] studies of the [[Taíno people|Taino]] culture and the African heritage in Puerto Rico by the [[Smithsonian Institution]].{{efn|name=smithsonian-pioneer-2004|Smithsonian Institution (2004) "Alegría was a pioneer scholar in the study of the culture of the Tainos, the native peoples who existed in Puerto Rico before Columbus’ arrival."&lt;ref name="smithsonian-bio-2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latino.si.edu/virtualgallery/ojos/bios/bios_Alegria.htm |title=Biography: Ricardo E. Alegría |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |year=2004 |accessdate={{date|2014-01-10|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} ''[[Caribbean Business]]'' points out that, "His extensive studies have helped historians understand how the Taínos lived and suffered, before and after the Spanish conquistadors arrived on the island."&lt;ref name="caribbean-business-2011-alegria-dead" /&gt; Alegría estimated that about one third of all Puerto Ricans have Taíno blood—results of recent [[DNA]] studies have proved him right.{{efn|''[[Caribbean Business]]'' (2011) "DNA studies have backed up Alegría’s estimate that about one-third of all Puerto Ricans have Taíno blood."&lt;ref name="caribbean-business-2011-alegria-dead" /&gt;}}

Nobel laureate [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] became inspired by Alegría's work and incorporated a fictional character based on him, named Ricardo Santurce, in his play ''El loco de los balcones''.{{efn|''[[Caribbean Business]]'' (2011) "Peruvian Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa was inspired by Alegría’s work and incorporated a fictional character based on him, named Ricardo Santurce, in his play “El loco de los balcones.”"&lt;ref name="caribbean-business-2011-alegria-dead"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cb.pr/news03.php?nt_id=59290 |title=PR scholar Ricardo Alegría dead at 90 |date={{date|2011-07-07|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2014-01-10|mdy}} |newspaper=[[Caribbean Business]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110213918/http://www.cb.pr/news03.php?nt_id=59290 |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ricardo Alegría lived in [[Old San Juan]] in his later years, until his death on July 7, 2011.{{efn|''[[El Nuevo Día]]'' (2011; in Spanish) "El prestigioso profesor, figura indispensable en el desarrollo de la identidad cultural nacional, falleció hoy a las 6:05 a.m."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/muerericardoalegria-1010121.html |title=Restos de Ricardo Alegría serán velados en el Centro de Estudios Avanzados |newspaper=[[El Nuevo Día]] |language=Spanish |date={{date|2011-07-07|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2014-01-10|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He had been hospitalized in San Juan's ''Centro Medico'' (Medical Center Hospital) a few weeks before his death. After a brief recovery, he relapsed, and was returned to the medical center, where he died of heart failure.{{efn|''[[Primera Hora (Puerto Rico)|Primera Hora]]'' (2011; in Spanish) "Alegría Pons explicó que su padre salió del hospital en junio, donde le habían practicado un cateterismo y una angioplastia, pasó dos semanas en su casa, hasta que el domingo pasado le dio un dolor de pecho muy fuerte. Fue reingresado al Cardiovascular pero no pudieron hacerle otro cateterismo porque estaba muy débil."&lt;ref name="primera-hora-2011-fallece-alegria"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.primerahora.com/noticias/puerto-rico/nota/biografiadedonricardoalegria-523580/ |title=Fallece don Ricardo Alegría |language=Spanish |newspaper=[[Primera Hora (Puerto Rico)|Primera Hora]] |date={{date|2011-07-07|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2014-01-10|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|''[[Primera Hora (Puerto Rico)|Primera Hora]]'' (2011; in Spanish) "Alegría, de 90 años, falleció a eso de las 6:59 a.m. en la Unidad de Coronaria del Centro Cardiovascular de Puerto Rico y el Caribe [...]"&lt;ref name="primera-hora-2011-fallece-alegria" /&gt;}}

==Awards and recognitions==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Ricardo Alegria Plaque Havana Cuba.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque honoring him]]
In 1993, President [[Bill Clinton]] presented Alegría with the "''[[National Humanities Medal|Charles Frankel Prize]]''" for his contributions in the field of archaeology.  In 1996, he was awarded the "''James Smithson Bicentennial Medal''".  In 2001, Alegría received from the hands of [[Nancy Morejon]] "''The Haydee Santamaria Medal''" in [[Havana, Cuba]].  In 2002, Alegría received the "''Luis Muñoz Marín Medal''" in recognition of his life achievements from Puerto Rican Governor [[Sila Calderón]].  Puerto Rican artist [[Lorenzo Homar]] honored Alegría by making an artistic graphic poster of him.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Alegría also received recognition from cultural and architectural organizations in Peru, Venezuela, Mexico and the Dominican Republic, where he also received an honorary doctorate. The city of Havana recognized his influence in the project to remodel the city's historical district (similar to Alegría's work in Old San Juan) by honoring him with a plaque, which, while he was alive, was the only monument honoring a living Puerto Rican in the entire city.

Puerto Rican folk duo ''Los Niños Estelares'' dedicated a tribute song to Alegría, named ''"Alegría, Doctor Alegría"'', in their 2010 album, ''Namasté''. In it they describe many of Alegría's accomplishments, his educational background, and -partly in jest, due to Alegría's impressive credentials- likened him to [[Indiana Jones]]. In the lyrics, they name Alegría ''"the last Puerto Rican hero."''

The '''Tablet of Shamash''' is a [[stone tablet]] recovered from the ancient [[Babylonia]]n city of [[Sippar]] in southern [[Iraq]] in 1881; it is now a major piece in the [[British Museum]]'s ancient Middle East collection. It is dated to the reign of King [[Nabu-apla-iddina]] ca. 888 – 855 [[Before Christ|BC]].&lt;ref name="AntiquitiesBarnett1969"&gt;{{cite book|author1=British Museum.

==Discovery==
The tablet was discovered during excavations by [[Hormuzd Rassam]] between 1878 and 1883. The tablet was found complete but broken into two large and six small pieces. By the time of King [[Nabopolassar]], between 625 and 605 BC, it had broken into four parts and been repaired. The terracotta coffer also contained two clay impressions of the tablets presentation scene. The coffer was sealed under an [[asphalt]] temple floor. It has been suggested that the coffer also contained a second tablet as well as a third clay impression (now in the Istanbul Museum).&lt;ref&gt;Hormuzd Rassam (1897), 401-402. [https://archive.org/download/asshurlandofnimr00rass/asshurlandofnimr00rass.pdf Asshur and the Land of Nimrod: Being an Account of the Discoveries Made in the Ancient Ruins of Nineveh, Asshur, Sepharvaim, Calah, etc.] Curts &amp; Jennings.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. E. Woods, The Sun-God Tablet of Nabû-apla-iddina Revisited, Journal of Cuneiform Studies, vol. 56, pp. 23 - 103, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
It was encased in a clay cast or [[squeeze (copying method)|"squeeze"]] that created impressions when placed over the face of the stone and protected it. This indicates that the tablet was an item of reverence, possibly stored due to newer traditions. The tablet has [[serrated]] edges like a [[saw]], which was the symbol of both Shamash and Saint [[Simon Zelotes]] in later tradition.&lt;ref name="Zawadzki2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stefan Zawadzki|title=Garments of the Gods: studies on the textile industry and the Pantheon of Sippar according to the texts from the Ebabbar archive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J3LrrXh_1hEC&amp;pg=PA142|accessdate=10 April 2011|year=2006|publisher=Saint-Paul|isbn=978-3-7278-1555-3|pages=142–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[relief|bas-relief]] on the top of the obverse (pictured) shows [[Shamash]], the [[Sun God]], beneath symbols of the [[Sun]], [[Moon]] and star. The God is depicted in a seated position, wearing a horned headdress, holding the [[rod-and-ring symbol]] in his right hand. There is another large sun disk in front of him on an [[altar]], suspended from above by two figures. Of the three other figures on the left, the central one is dressed in the same fashion as Shamash and is assumed to be the Babylonian king Nabu-apla-iddina receiving the symbols of deity.

==Inscription==
The scene contains three inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=282224&amp;partId=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; The first, at the head of the tablet reads:
{{Verse translation|
(1) ṣal-lam (ilu)Šamaš bêlu rabû 
(2) a-šib E-babbar-ra
(3) ša ki-rib Sippar(KI)
|
(1) Image of Shamash, the great Lord
(2) who dwells in Ebabbara,
(3) which is in Sippar}}

Above the sun god a second inscription describes the position of the depicted moon, sun, and star as being over against the heavenly ocean, on which the scene sits:
{{Verse translation|
(1) (ilu)Sin (ilu)Šamaš u (ilu)Ištar ina pu-ut apsî
(2) ina bi-rit ili muš-ti-mi innadû(pl. u)
|
(1) Sin, Shamash and Ishtar are set over against the heavenly ocean
(2) within the divine judge}}

The final inscription in the scene reads:
{{Verse translation|
(1)agû (ilu)Šamaš 
(2) muš-ši do
|
(1) Headdress of Shamash
(2) rod of do.}}
The [[cuneiform]] text beneath the [[stele]] is divided into fifteen passages, blending prose, poetic and rhetorical elements in the fashion typical of Mesopotamian royal inscriptions. It tells how Sippar and the Ebabbar temple of Shamash had fallen into disrepair with the loss of the [[Cult image|statue of the God]]. This cult image is temporarily replaced with the solar disk; it is further described how a new figure of Shamash was found in an eastern part of the [[Euphrates]], from which Nabu-apla-iddina has constructed a new statue of [[lapis lazuli]] and [[gold]] to restore the cult.  Similar [[iconography|iconographic]] and prosaic parallels have been evidenced from Mesopotamian and later [[Jewish]] sources where the king who restores the cult is seen like a deity passing on divine symbols. The remainder of the text records the gifts of the royal grant, similar to a ''[[kudurru]]'' and discusses the practices of the temple, priestly rules, dress codes and regulations.&lt;ref name="King1912"&gt;{{cite book|author=L.

'''''The Lion of Flanders, or the Battle of the Golden Spurs''''' ({{lang-nl|'''De Leeuw van Vlaenderen, of de Slag der Gulden Sporen'''}}&lt;!--The Dutch spelling in archaic but correct--&gt;) is a major [[novel]] first published in 1838 by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] writer [[Hendrik Conscience]] (1812–83). An early example of the [[historical fiction]] genre, the ''Lion of Flanders'' focuses on the medieval [[Franco-Flemish War]] and the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]] of 1302 in particular. It is written in Conscience's typical stylistic [[romanticism]] and has been described as the "Flemish national epic".{{sfn|Hermann|2016|p=59}} 

Unusually for its time, the work was written in Dutch and it is considered one of the founding texts of [[Flemish literature]]. This gave it an enduring political influence within the [[Flemish Movement]] and its contemporary success also confirmed Conscience's reputation as a novelist.

== Background ==
[[Hendrik Conscience]] was born in the Flemish city of [[Antwerp]] into a mixed French-Flemish family in 1812. Conscience was brought up bilingual, speaking both [[French language|French]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].{{sfn|Hermans|2014|p=162}} After briefly working as a teacher, he participated in the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830 and later served in the Belgian army during the [[Ten Days' Campaign]] of 1831, inspired by the contemporary ideology of [[romantic nationalism]]. He left the army in 1836 and moved to the [[Campine (region)|Kempen region]] where he began to pursue a literary career.

[[File:Nicaise de Keyser02.jpg|thumb|left|''De Slag der Gulden Sporen'' (1836) by [[Nicaise de Keyser]] may have served as an inspiration for the book{{sfn|Hermann|2016|p=57}}]]
Conscience worked in the new genre of [[historical fiction]] which had emerged in [[Europe]] around 1800.{{sfn|Literatuurgeschiedenis|b}} His early writing combined his interests in the language and history of [[Flanders]] with [[Romanticism|literary romanticism]]. His first book, ''[[In 't Wonderjaer]]'' (''In the Year of Wonder'') was published in 1837 and explored both themes.{{sfn|EB|online}} It was the first work of historical fiction yet published in Dutch and was set during the ''[[Beeldenstorm]]'' of 1566 and the revolt by [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] against Catholic rule. Conscience was only able to publish the work with the support of friends, including [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]].{{sfn|Hermans|2014|p=164}} Though relatively successful, the work made him little money and Conscience began work on a new book.{{sfn|Hermans|2014|p=164}}

The innovative dimension of Conscience's work was his use of Dutch language in his writing. At the time, Belgian [[high culture]] was dominated by French, the established language of the upper classes and state bureaucracy across the country. Though Dutch dialects were commonly spoken in Flanders as a [[vernacular]], their use was considered vulgar by the bourgeoisie and inappropriate in literature. Conscience, however, believed that Dutch provided a more authentic form of expression and preferred to use it, making his works unusual at the time.

== Novel ==
[[File:HendrikConscience.gif|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Hendrik Conscience]] as a young man]]
In 1838, Conscience published his second book, entitled ''De Leeuw van Vlaenderen, of de Slag der Gulden Sporen''{{efn|The "ae" combination from ''Vlaenderen'' (Flanders) is [[History of Dutch orthography|considered archaic]] in modern Dutch and is replaced by ''Vlaanderen'' in modern editions.}} (''The Lion of Flanders, or the Battle of the Golden Spurs''). The book was set in [[County of Flanders|Medieval Flanders]] and focused on the [[Franco-Flemish War]] (1297–1305). Its centerpiece was the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs|Battle of Kortrik]] of 1302, commonly known as the Battle of the Golden Spurs (''Guldensporenslag''), in which a small Flemish force, made up of local militia, unexpectedly defeated a superior invading force from the [[Kingdom of France]]. In choosing the topic, Conscience may have been inspired by a romantic painting of the battle by the Flemish artist [[Nicaise de Keyser]], unveiled in 1836.{{sfn|Hermann|2016|p=57}} Conscience's work approaches the subject through the romance between Machteld, daughter of [[Robert III, Count of Flanders]] (the eponymous "Lion of Flanders"), and the [[knight]] Adolf van Nieuwlandt. The book famously concludes with a direct injunction to the reader:

{{quote|''Gy Vlaming, die dit boek gelezen hebt, overweeg, by de roemryke daden welke hetzelve bevat, wat Vlaenderen eertyds was – wat het nu is – en nog meer wat het worden zal indien gy de heilige voorbeelden uwer Vaderen vergeet!''

You Fleming, who have read this book, reflect, through the glorious deeds that it recounts, what Flanders once was, what it is now, and even more what it shall become if you forget the sacred examples of your forefathers!{{sfn|Literatuurgeschiedenis|b}} }}

In his foreword to the 1838 edition, Conscience explicitly stated that he intended his book to raise Flemish [[national consciousness]] and patriotism.{{sfn|Hermann|2016|p=59}} Conscience researched the historical events by reading contemporary [[chronicle]]s and his narrative frequently diverged from historical fact, contributed to the mythelogisation of the events as clash between the Flemish and French-speaking invaders.{{sfn|Literatuurgeschiedenis|b}}{{sfn|Hermann|2016|p=59}}

=== Reception ===
[[File:Kortrijk-Groeningemonument.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Groeninge Monument]] (1906) in [[Kortrijk]] commemorates the Battle of the Golden Spurs, popularised by Conscience]]
The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' describes ''De Leeuw'' as a "passionate epic" and compares it to the historical fiction of the Scottish writer [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]] (1771–1832).{{sfn|EB|online}} With the immense success of the ''De Leeuw van Vlaanderen'' Conscience was widely credited as the man "who taught his people to read" (''leerde zijn volk lezen'') in [[popular culture]].{{sfn|Literatuurgeschiedenis|a}} The work's public success confirmed Conscience's reputation as the leading Flemish novelist of his generation. By the time of his death in 1883, he had written around 100 novels and novellas.{{sfn|Hermans|2014|p=162}}

The publication of ''The Lion'' coincided with the emergence of the [[Flemish Movement]] which supported an increasingly assertive Flemish political identity. As a celebration of Dutch language and Flemish history, the ''Lion'' became popular among ''flamingants'' and contributed to the increasing importance of the Battle of the Golden Spurs in Flemish political memory.{{sfn|Literatuurgeschiedenis|b}} The battle itself had been largely forgotten before Conscience's work but was revived.{{sfn|Hermann|2016|p=58}} Among other things, it inspired the [[flag of Flanders]] and the anthem "[[De Vlaamse Leeuw]]" (1847) by [[Hippoliet Van Peene]].{{sfn|Literatuurgeschiedenis|b}} It has been noted, however, that the increased status of the work in Flemish nationalist consciousness also coincided with a decreasing readership.{{sfn|Willems|2014}} Conscience himself believed that Flemish and Belgian patriotisms were complementary and was himself a [[Belgian nationalism|Belgian nationalist]].{{sfn|Literatuurgeschiedenis|a}}

== Adaptations ==
''The Lion of Flanders'' has been the subject of various adaptations. At least nine [[Franco-Belgian comics|comic strip adaptations]] have been produced;{{sfn|Hermann|2016|p=61}} the most celebrated was by [[Bob De Moor]] and was serialised in ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' after 1949 and published as a single volume in 1952. It was acclaimed as one of his best works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripspeciaalzaak.be/Toppers/BelgenTop100/48_LeeuwVlaanderen.htm|title=BelgenTop 50 nr. 48: De Leeuw van Vlaanderen|website=www.stripspeciaalzaak.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also notable is Karel Biddeloo's loose adaptation of the work in 1984 within the ''[[De Rode Ridder]]'' series, inspired by [[surrealism]].{{sfn|Hermann|2016|p=57}}

The work was also adapted into a film in 1984, directed by the celebrated Flemish writer [[Hugo Claus]], to commemorate the anniversary of Conscience's death. The film was itself adapted into a television series by Claus in 1985.{{sfn|Willems|2014}} The work was a co-production between various private and state groups in Belgium and the Netherlands and, at 80 million [[Belgian franc]]s, was the most expensive film produced in the [[Low Countries]] to date.{{sfn|Willems|2014}} As director, Claus attempted to stick as closely to the original text as possible. The film was a commercial and critical disaster, criticised for excessive romanticism and Flemish nationalist politics.{{sfn|Willems|2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1287">The '''Union Nationale des Experts Traducteurs Interprètes près les Cours d'Appel''' is a member organization of the [[International Federation of Translators]].

Experts-traducteurs are professional [[translator]]s chosen by a jury on application to the Cour d'Appel ([[Appellate Court]]) of their home region in France. They have to show the jury, on request, that they have been working for a minimum of three years and that the result of their work corresponds exactly to the original text. They are then listed on a document tended by the regional Cour d'Appel as a regional expert translator/interpreter. They are regularly checked by police officers on their personal acquaintances and life style to ensure loyalty, lawfulness and impartiality. Translators listed at the Cour d'Appel can, after another three years, file a new application at the jury of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Cour de Cassation]] in Paris to be listed as a national expert translator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36851">'''Women-led uprisings''' are mass protests that are initiated by women as an act of resistance or rebellion in defiance of an established government. A [[protest]] is a statement or action taken part to express disapproval of or object an authority; most commonly led in order to influence [[public opinion]] or [[government policy]]. They range from village food riots against imposed taxes to protests that initiated the Russian revolution.

[[E.P. Thompson]]'s classic article "The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the 18th Century" emphasised women's role in many food riots. He argued that the rioters insisted on the idea of a moral community that was obliged to feed them and their families. As one contemporary commentator wrote: 'Women are more disposed to be mutinous ... [and] in all public tumults they are foremost in violence and ferocity.' &lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/tags/e-p-thompson E.P.Thompson, ''Customs in Common'', p234].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Bohstedt]] later argued that Thompson had exaggerated women's role in food riots. Thompson responded by forcefully rejecting Bohstedt's criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/tags/e-p-thompson E.P.Thompson, 'The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the 18th Century' and 'Moral Economy Reviewed' in ''Customs in Common''], p185-335; Malcolm Thomis and Jennifer Grimmett, ''Women in Protest, 1800–1850'', p28ff; John Bohstedt, 'The Myth of the Feminine Food Riot' in Harriet Applewhite and Darlene Levy, ''Women and Politics in the Age of Democratic Revolution''.&lt;/ref&gt; We will never know the exact proportion of women's involvement in 18th Century food riots, but it appears that, at the very least, women led or initiated a significant minority of such riots and they participated in many more. Women had participated more fully in food riots than they had in earlier anti-[[impressment]] riots of 1747, in which they defended community interest and enforced community morality. These riots of revolution and resistance opened up opportunities for women to take political action as social and economic influencers, and not just as a republican's wife or a mother.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Smith, Barbara Clark. "Food Rioters and the American Revolution." The William and Mary Quarterly, vol. 51, no. 1, 1994, pp. 3–38. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2947003.&lt;/ref&gt; He indicates that women's new assertiveness had something to do with the weakening of the patriarchal control of women as [[feudalism]] declined and market relations expanded.

Men and women participated in food riots in [[Ireland]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]] (where contemporary reports claimed that women initiated many riots). Dutch tax riots in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were more numerous often more violent with participants of both lower and lower-middle classes, whereas food riots drew only lower class participants. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, at last 26 riots and 50 demonstrations involved women with 10 being chiefly under their control. Women did the cooking and purchased foodstuffs for their families; therefore, they were the first parties to be confronted with scarcities of food and high prices. In doing so women generally controlled much of the household finances. Another reason for their participation is due to the fact that food riots typically started in market places near shops and mills, which is where women gathered the most. One of the most prominent tax riots in 1616 has even gone on record as "the Women's Revolt of Delft".&lt;ref&gt;Dekker, Rudolf M. "Women in revolt." Theory and Society 16.3 (1987): 337-362&lt;/ref&gt; Women also conducted nearly a third of food riots during the [[American Revolution]] &lt;ref&gt;William Sheehan, Riotous Assemblies, p160; [http://lowcountries.nl/papers2009/papers2009_ronsijn.pdf Wouter Ronsijn, ''Western Europe's last food riots: a comparison of the market riots of the 1840's and 1850's in Flanders'']; H.Applewhite and D.Levy, ''Women and Politics in the Age of Democratic Revolution'', 127-30; Manfred Gailus in K.Hagemann, ''Civil Society and Gender'', p174-9; [http://libcom.org/history/food-rioters-american-revolution-barbara-clark-smith Barbara Clark Smith, 'Food Rioters and the American Revolution'], ''William and Mary Quarterly'', Vol. 51, No. 1, p3-5, 26-9.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that women were excluded from the vote, unqualified to serve as jurors at courts and law, and were essentially politically disabled by their [[Dependant|dependent]] status.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; It made a difference that Americans knew that women figured prominently in food riots in England and Europe, and it made a difference that ideas of equity, neighborly dealing, and charity informed American women's daily lives in the colonial period. Roughly 100 women marched a "Female Riot" and took to the streets in July 1777 insisting on their right to enforce equitable exchange.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

==French Revolutions==
Women were especially prominent in food riots in French marketplaces (although men dominated those in the countryside).&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Bouton, 'Gendered Behavior in Subsistence Riots', ''Journal of Social History'', Vol.23, No.4; C. Bouton, ''The Flour War: Gender, Class and Community in Late Ancien Regime French Society''.&lt;/ref&gt; The most momentous French food riot was [[The Women's March on Versailles]]. This occurred in October 1789, when the market women of Paris began calling the men 'cowards' and declaring: 'We will take over!' These women proceeded to march to Versailles with soldiers following them. This crowd then forced the King to return to Paris where, three years later, women were again major participants in the demonstrations that led to the abolition of the monarchy. As a police inspector said in 1793: 'It is mainly the women who are stirred up, women who in turn communicate all their frenzy to the men, heating them up with their seditious propositions and stimulating the most violent effervescence.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/history/everyday-lives-parisian-women-october-days-1789-david-garrioch D. Garrioch, 'Everyday Lives of Parisian Women in the October Days, 1789'], ''Social History,'' Vol.24, p231-2; H.Applewhite and D.Levy, ''Women and Politics in the Age of Democratic Revolution'', p76, 81ff; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uK6JVxh92QUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Olwen+H.+Hufton%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pe4FT6P1HcWS8gPS2eTJBA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=inauthor%3A%22Olwen%20H.%20Hufton%22&amp;f=false Olwen Hufton, ''Women and the Limits of Citizenship in the French Revolution''], p1-49; [http://libcom.org/history/political-revolution-women-case-paris-darline-gay-levy-harriet-b-applewhite H.Applewhite and D.Levy, 'Women and Political Revolution in Paris'], in Renate Bridenthal, ''Becoming Visible, Women in European History'' (1987 Edition), p285-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, women in the countryside initiated 'counter-revolutionary' protests against the new government's policies of the repression of the Church and the conscription of male peasants into the army.&lt;ref&gt;James Mcmillan, ''France and Women, 1789-1914'', p25-6; Wikipedia: [[War in the Vendee]].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], women lead the fight for religion. Their fight would lead the way for the [[Feminization (sociology)|feminization]] of religions. Women felt that they were one responsible for maintaining a spiritual balance within their family. They fought harder than their male counterparts, invoking violent and illegal actions sometimes to get their voices heard. If women were ever arrested, the males in their lives would downplay the damage they could do and were also seen as more hysterical and vulnerable as a whole, so society never thought much of their violent and illegal actions. But if a woman refused or avoided taking part in [[Petition|petitions]] or marches, she would be shamed until guilted into taking part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desan|first=Suzanne|date=Spring 1989|title=The Role of Women in Religious Riots During the French Revolution|jstor=2738896|journal=Eighteenth-Century Studies|volume=22| issue =  3 Special Issue: The French Revolution in Culture|pages=451–468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women during the French Revolution also fought for their own rights. [[Aristocratic]] women were not as likely to partake in the activities that could ruin their family and/or their chance of inheriting the family fortune (or what she would receive), so they were reluctant to participate. [[Working class]] women also faced this dilemma, but because they were already the suppressed class, the good of what they could achieve outweighed the loss of family pride and/or fortune. [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] had allowed all people who paid taxes to vote, but since women could not pay taxes, they could not vote. While the [[Third estate|Third Estate]] made rules, women would present their opinions through pamphlets and petitions to let the Third Estate know what they wanted. ''Pétition des femmes du Tiers-Etat au Roi'' stated that women wanted education to go beyond French and Latin for Church, more jobs to be available to women, and to raise the max pay of 5-6 sous. ''Motion en Faveur du Sexe'' and ''Discours préliminaire de la pauvre Javotte'' focused on dowries and marriage. In the working class, finding a job was hard enough for men, harder for women, and saving enough money to get married was almost impossible. Women didn't want to have to pay a dowry to get married, this applied only in the Third Estate. ''The Rights of Woman'' by Olympe de Gou was a complete pamphlet that stated all the rights that women should have. It was copied almost word for word from the ''Declaration of the Rights of Man'', but applied to women. A booklet ''"Griefs et plaintes des femmes mal mariées"'' placed criticism on marriage laws oppressing women into submission to their male counterpart and demanded the legalization of divorce. In the sector of Bourgeoises, Madame Etta Palm van Aelder was a leading figure in fighting to women's rights. She demanded for the equal right to an education, political freedom, divorce and legality of women of age 21 and over. While political freedom would not be gained until after the Revolution, all other demands would be meet in some way. In August 1792, women of the age of 21 and above were given legal freedom from their parents. In September 1792, women were granted the right to divorce and the Law of 1794 eased the divorce process. Educational programs were advanced and allowed women to be trained for careers in the work field, but they still did not obtain equality. Female teachers were paid less than males and primary school classes were divided by gender. By the end of the advancements and improvements in the educational system, the women weren't much better off than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Racz|first=Elizabeth|date=Spring 1952|title=The Women's Rights Movement in the French Revolution|jstor=40400125|journal=Science and Society|publisher=Guilford Press|volume=16| issue =  2|pages=151–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

R. B. Rose argues that despite the efforts of women during the Revolution, little changed. The Revolution was a revolution for the men, and a place of chaos for the women.The French Revolutionary Constitution of 1791 allowed women to be labeled as citizens, but nothing else than that. They still didn't have voting rights or the ability to run for office. The Napoleonic Law of 1804 suppressed wives into submission to their husbands, reversing all equality demands made during the Revolution. Women still couldn't own land because they couldn't legally sign any contract, putting the land into the hands of her closest masculine relative figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rose|first=R.

Later, during the [[Franco-Prussian War|Franco-Prussian War of 1871]], women were prominent in preventing the army from moving their cannons from Paris, an event which helped spark the [[Paris Commune]].&lt;ref&gt;Gay Gullickson, ''Unruly Women of Paris'', p24ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
Women's protests for the right to vote became particularly [[militant]] in Britain. They included arson, widespread window breaking and attempts to storm both [[Parliament]] and [[Buckingham Palace]]. The shift to wartime patriotism in 1914, however, derailed the [[suffragette movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Kent, ''Gender and Power in Britain, 1640-1990'', p262, 268-73; [[Women's Social and Political Union]].&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Image:Suffragette handbill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Suffragette handbill]]

During [[World War I]], women led large numbers of food riots in Germany, [[Russia]], [[Italy]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Belinda Davis in K.Hagemann, Home/Front; the Military, War and Gender in Twentieth Century Germany, Ch.4; [https://books.google.com/books?id=hFqZcQmlOBsC&amp;pg=0_0#PPA1,M1 Keith Allen, 'Food and the German Home-Front' and Simonetta Ortaggi, 'Italian Women During the Great War' in Gail Braybon, ''Evidence, History and the Great War''], p181, 190, 218-36; [http://libcom.org/history/subsistence-riots-russia-during-world-war-i-barbara-engel Beverley Engel, 'Subsistence Riots in Russia during World War One'], ''Journal of Modern History'', Vol.69; [http://libcom.org/history/women-communal-strikes-crisis-1917-1922-temma-kaplan Temma Kaplan, 'Women and Communal Strikes in the Crisis of 1917-1922'], in Renate Bridenthal, ''Becoming Visible: Women in European History'' (1987 Edition); Lynne Taylor, 'Food Riots Revisited', ''Journal of Social History'', Vol.30, No.2; Manuel Castells, ''The City and the Grassroots'', Ch.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Women workers also led the way in strike-waves in [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]]. The German authorities reported that [[Labor Union|union]] leaders were doing 'everything possible to prevent such disturbances and strikes over food provisions, but ... it is the countless female workers who constantly agitate and stir things up.' Women's prominence in these struggles helped delegitimize the war, and the regimes that were fighting it, paving the way for the huge strike-waves and revolutions at the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=loCIRHrIOaMC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=#PPA293 Ute Daniel, ''The War from Within: German Women in the First World War''], p293, 246-50; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QHxs3y8yXAQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=downs+manufacturing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zfn-Ttv5H8nz8QOq-fmlAQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg&amp;pg=0_0#PPA1,M119 Laura Lee Downs, ''Manufacturing Inequality: Gender Division in the French and British Metalworking Industries, 1914-39''], p119-144; Davis in Hagemann ''Home/Front ...,'' p131.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Image:DisturbiosPorHambreEnBerlín.png|thumb|right|400px|Aftermath of Berlin food riot, 1918]]

Women also led food riots in [[Japan]] and non-belligerent [[Spain]]. Women's protests against high food prices spread across Spain in both 1913 and 1918. In [[Barcelona]], in 1918, women used the slogan: 'In the name of humanity, all women take to the streets!'. They organised repeated demonstrations and attacked shops, warehouses, government offices and music halls. Women also staged food riots during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VE4YVw9iBksC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=seidman+egos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=okkhT6G-LYKD4gSFlYG5Cw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20riots&amp;f=false Michael Seidman, Republic of Egos, p102, 219].&lt;/ref&gt; Temma Kaplan has theorised such uprisings as examples of 'female [[consciousness]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lewis, ''Rioters and Citizens; Mass Protests in Imperial Japan''; [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft9q2nb672&amp;chunk.id=d0e2460&amp;toc.id=d0e2193&amp;brand=ucpress Temma Kaplan, ''Red City, Blue Period: Social Movements in Picasso's Barcelona''], Ch.4 and 5; [http://libcom.org/history/female-consciousness-collective-action-barcelona-temma-kaplan Temma Kaplan, 'Female Consciousness and Collective Action: The Case of Barcelona, 1910-1918'], ''Signs'', Vol.7; Kaplan 'Women and Communal Strikes...'.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian Revolution==
[[Karl Marx]] had recognized that "great social revolutions are impossible without the feminine ferment"&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Gailus in K.Hagemann, ''Civil Society and Gender'', p178-80;  ''Marx, Engels Collected Works'', Vol.43, p184.&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1917, it was [[Petrograd]]'s (Saint Petersburg) female workers who spread the idea of a general strike on 8 March, [[International Women's Day]]. On that day, hundreds of women threw stones and snowballs at factory windows demanding for bread. [[Economic depression]] in 1917, particularly devastated the working class women because price of daily necessities increases tremendously, but their low paid wages does not compensate for the increased in price of goods. After a long and tiring hours of labor, women had to line up for hours just to get a loaf of bread. Sometimes after wasting hours lining up, the breads would ran out and it resulted in starvation for a lot of families. The protest led by thousand of female workers inspired fellow male factory workers to joined them and demand changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A People's History Of The Russian Revolution|last=Faulkner|first=Neil|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2017|isbn=9781786800190|location=London|pages=111–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women participated in the riots by attacking [[Police station|police stations]] and bakeries. However, many troops refused to shoot protesting women, who were often walking with their children. As [[Leon Trotsky]] later wrote, the women took hold of the soldiers' rifles and 'beseeched almost commanded: "put down your [[Bayonet|bayonets]] and join us"', and, within five days, the centuries-old Tsarist regime had collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xyC-9mQ7SlsC&amp;pg=0_0#PPA43 Choi Chatterjee, ''Celebrating Women; Gender, Festival, Culture and Bolshevik Ideology''], p43-54; Jane McDermid and Anna Hillyar, ''Midwives of the Revolution'', 147-157; [http://libcom.org/history/women-communal-strikes-crisis-1917-1922-temma-kaplan Kaplan in Bridenthal, ''Becoming Visible...,''].&lt;/ref&gt;

As Bolshevik took over Petrograd and [[Moscow]] in October 1917, tense relationship were discern between rulers and working-class women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clements|first=Barbara Evans|date=1982|title=Working-Class and Peasant Women in the Russian Revolution, 1917-1923|jstor=3173897|journal=Signs|volume=8|issue=2|pages=215–235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarcity and hunger made it very difficult for Russian workers to transform society themselves and women's participation did not continue at the same level as in February/March 1917. However, it was women's food protests, in May 1918, that sparked the first major wave of workers' unrest against the new [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BEoBCGJ4VqYC&amp;pg=0_0#PPA229 Alexander Rabinowitch, ''The Bolsheviks in Power''], p229-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, later, during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s program of breakneck [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] and forced [[Collectivism|collectivization]], women were again at the forefront of the workers' strikes and peasant protests that resisted this brutal policy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynne Viola]], [http://libcom.org/history/peasant-womens-protest-during-collectivization-lynne-viola ''Peasant Rebels under Stalin''], p176-84, 202-9, 237-8; [https://books.google.com/books?id=X09ZuZG_JNwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq= Jeffrey Rossman, ''Worker Resistance under Stalin''], p6-7, 206, 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin's regime was, however, able to contain all resistance through starvation and repression.

==Colonial revolts==
Women were prominent in various revolts in the colonial and ex-colonial world. One of the most notable in Africa was the [[Igbo Women's War]] against British tax collection in [[Nigeria]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie G.Smith, ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History'', Vol.1, p540; M.J.Diamond, ''Women and Revolution; Global Expressions''.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in southern [[Igboland]] believed that they were being wrongfully taxed for palm products by the British. This led to what the British called the Aba Riots, and the Igbo, the Women's War. This rebellion tested the political institutions of the Igbo women which have been established prior to colonization. Women took initiative by sending messages through the market and kinship networks connecting to other villages calling for a mikiri meeting. They also took advantage of strikes, boycotts, and force to project their opinions and retaliate against authority. Women of wealth and generosity who could speak well typically took leading roles in village wide mikiri gatherings, which had the largest influence on the rise of the Women's War. During mikiri, decisions were made on how to respond against being wronged by the Warrant Chief's corruption and by the taxes that they anticipated to be enforced upon them.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Van Allen (1972) "Sitting on a Man": Colonialism and the Lost Political Institutions of Igbo Women, Canadian Journal of African Studies/La Revue canadienne des études africaines, 6:2, 165-181, DOI: 10.1080/00083968.1972.10803664&lt;/ref&gt;

==The civil rights movement and feminism since the 1950s==
It was a [[Montgomery Bus Boycott#Rosa Parks|boycott of segregated buses by African-American women]] that sparked the [[civil rights movement]] in 1955. This case inspired activists across the world to make a change and fight oppressions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pzwcfZil93EC&amp;pg=0_0#PPA5 M.

Young women's rejection of the patriarchal family and sexual repression was also a major factor in the rebellions of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/commentary/%E2%80%98liberate-socialist-eminences-from-their-bourgeois-cocks%E2%80%99 'Women '68ers, Marching on Alone'], [[Lynne Segal]],''[[Radical Philosophy]]'', No.149.&lt;/ref&gt; Women started to defy the typical housewife characteristics and they also demanded equal pay for man and women who worked the same job. [[Sexual revolution]] was also transcending in the 1960s as women embraced their sexuality and nature more openly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=AgMEphGu86QC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=civil+rights+movement+by+women&amp;ots=HROxi7jW71&amp;sig=cBIoRDB6NHsE8LQriOZaRvQ_f48#v=onepage&amp;q=civil%20rights%20movement%20by%20women&amp;f=false|title=Personal Politics: The Roots of Women's Liberation in the Civil Rights Movement and the New Left|last=Evans|first=Sara Margaret|date=1979|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=9780394742281|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revived feminist movement then helped transform gender roles in the following decades. [[Marsha P. Johnson]], a black trans woman, and [[Stormé DeLarverie]], a black lesbian, are credited with inciting the [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall Riots]] in New York City in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/tgi-bios/marsha-p-johnson|title=Marsha "Pay it no Mind" Johnson · Challenging Gender Boundaries: A Trans Biography Project · outhistory.org|website=outhistory.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/remembering-stormé-the-woman-who-incited-the-stonewall_us_5933c061e4b062a6ac0ad09e|title=Remembering Stormé - The Woman Of Color Who Incited The Stonewall Revolution|last=Robertson|first=Julia Diana|date=2017-06-05|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stonewall was a turning point in the [[gay liberation]] and [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] rights movements.

Women were also at the forefront of many working class struggles in the 1970s and 1980s. (For example, in the [[British Isles]], women's protests and leadership were significant during the '[[troubles]]' in Northern Ireland, during the [[Grunwick strike]] and [[Women Against Pit Closures|during the miners' strike]].&lt;ref&gt;Fairweather, McDonough and McFadyean, ''Only the Rivers Run Free: Northern Ireland, the Women's War'' (1984), [[Pluto Press]] {{ISBN|0861046684}}; Wikipedia: [[Grunwick Dispute]]; Wikipedia: [[Women Against Pit Closures]].&lt;/ref&gt;) For a long time, Iranian women struggled with basic human rights and oppression due to traditional religious affiliations and political attributes. Their Islamic beliefs conceal the issues of gender inequalities and the domination of man towards [[Women in Iran|Iranian women]]. On 1979, in the course of [[Islamic Revolution]], women gathered and protested on the streets but the changes were nonexistent. It wasn't until 1990s where the impact of Islamic Revolution was seen as intolerant to women. This is when young women and activist started going against the Islamic ideologies, for instance, getting a divorce or wearing clothes that were revealing. Significant changes of basic human rights and the oppression of Iranian women has been perceived since 1990s and it has been progressing notably until today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sq4ya5rf2q.search.serialssolutions.com/?genre=article&amp;isbn=&amp;issn=15398706&amp;title=Journal%20of%20International%20Women%5C's%20Studies&amp;volume=9&amp;issue=1&amp;date=20071101&amp;atitle=Iranian%20women%20and%20the%20civil%20rights%20movement%20in%20Iran:%20feminism%20interacted&amp;aulast=Mohammadi,%20Majid&amp;spage=1&amp;sid=EBSCO:General%20OneFile&amp;pages=1-21|title=Journals at the LMU William H.

Recently on January 20, 2017, the day after [[Donald Trump]] was inaugurated as the 45th US president, women, men, and children all over the United States gathered to march in protest of Trump and promote solidarity with other women to resist women's oppression and mistreatment. Over 680 marches throughout the country and in more than 68 countries around the world were held as part of the [[2017 Women's March|Women's March]]. More than 1,000,000 people participated in  the "flagship march" in Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Chenoweth, Erica; Pressman, Jeremy (2017-02-07).

== Kurdish Women and the Rojava Revolution ==
Northern [[Syria]] is what is referred to as the [[Rojava]]. The Rojava revolution, or [[Rojava conflict]], is the political disaster, social revolution, and military battle that has taken place in recent years. The Rojava Revolution has been characterized by the prominent role women have had during these times of strife.[[File:Kurdish YPG Fighters (30358638660).jpg|thumb|The YPG, Women's Protection Units]]
The novel ''Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan'' documents the [[Kurdish women]] and how they were and still are oppressed. As Kurds, they were denied basic rights, in many cases even citizenship; and as women they were trapped in patriarchal domination.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan|last=Knapp|first=Michael|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kurdish women's movement seeks to overcome the alienation of Kurdish women. The fight for women's rights has always been a part of Kurdish history. One of the first signs of revolution in Rojava was the election of [[Hêvî Îbrahîm]] to the post of the prime minister in February 2014.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bengio|first=Ofra|date=Winter 2016|title=Game Changers: Kurdish Women in Peace and War|url=|journal=Middle East Institute|volume=70|pages=38|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, many women were assuming leadership positions. [[Asya Abdullah]] is regarded to be one of the most radical and effective revolutionaries in the world today. She has been the driving force in the battle for Kurdish freedom.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/kurdish-woman-building-feminist-democrac-fighting-isis-at-the-same-time-syria-kurdistan-rojava-new-a7487151.html|title=The Kurdish Woman Building Feminist a Democracy and Fighting ISIS at the Same Time|last=McKernan|first=Bethan|date=5 January 2017|website=Independent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wants women around the world to become more aware of their own fight.

With this transformation, women also began getting involved with security and military roles. In 2012, women from the PYD, the [[People's Protection Units]], created a unit dedicated to the fight for women. The Women's fighting units, also known as [[YPJ]], have played a role in the liberations of towns like [[Kobanî|Kobani]] and [[Manbij]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since September 2014, Kurdish women have been playing a leading role in the fight against [[ISIS]]. The creation of the YPJ is a fascinating development in a region where women's rights are often repressed. But with the formation of these groups, has come with sexist media coverage. The media is more concerned with the fighters looks rather than what they are fighting for.

Women in the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] guerrilla army have developed Jineoloji (also known as Jineology) which simply put, means women's science. The goal of [[jineology]] is to given women and society access to science and knowledge and to strengthen the connections of science and knowledge to society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Rojava Revolution]] has been characterized by a high level of women participation politics, safe houses for women dealing with sexual assault or violence, and women-run academies dedicated to the study of [[Jineology]].

Out of the conflict of the popular uprising in [[Syria]], Kurdish women took up arms alongside men and took control of Northern Syria, also known as [[Rojava]]. The women fight alongside men both in mixed units of the [[People's Protection Units]] (YPG) as well as in their own [[Women's Protection Units]] (YPJ). Women constitute an estimated 35 percent of the entire Kurdish forces.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==The creation of the first human societies==
Studies of contemporary [[hunter-gatherer]]s show that their strong sense of moral community is maintained by autonomous individuals who constantly resist any form of personal domination. In fact, many hunter-gatherers are so egalitarian and communistic that even a non-Marxist anthropologist like [[Christopher Boehm]] argues that hunter-gatherer societies - the first human societies - must have originated in uprisings against dominant males.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ljxS8gUlgqgC&amp;printsec=frontcover Christopher Boehm, ''Hierarchy in the Forest; the Evolution of Egalitarian Behaviour''], p1-10, 84-9, 172-3, 193-6, 249, 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chris Knight (anthropologist)|Chris Knight]], and other anthropologists influenced by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], have theorised that these uprisings were led by women looking for collective support to ease their childcare burdens.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Knight, [http://libcom.org/library/sex-human-revolution-chris-knight 'Sex and the Human Revolution'] and [http://libcom.org/library/solidarity-sex-chris-knight 'Solidarity and Sex']; Chris Knight, Camilla Power, Ian Watts, [http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/old/pub_knight_power_watts_big.pdf 'The Human Symbolic Revolution', ''The Cambridge Archaeological Journal''], Vol.5, p75ff; www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/publications.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; They have used a wide range of evidence from anthropology, [[primatology]], mythic narratives, [[evolutionary biology]] and archaeology. Some Marxists have dismissed these ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.de/science/harmeng/engels1.htm Chris Harman, ''International Socialism'', No.54, p169-74]. Some other Marxists have been more positive, e.g. Jack Conrad, [http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/798/originsofreligion.php 'Origins of Religion and the Human Revolution'].&lt;/ref&gt; However, although the idea of women-led uprisings creating the first societies is controversial, a number of highly respected anthropologists have taken the thesis seriously. ([[Mary Douglas]], [[Robin Dunbar]], [[David Lewis-Williams]], [[Caroline Humphrey]], [[Marilyn Strathern]], Clive Gamble, [[Keith Hart (anthropologist)|Keith Hart]] and [[Chris Stringer]] have all made favourable comments about Knight's work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TECGMrey5UEC&amp;pg=PA586&amp;lpg=PA586&amp;dq=times+literary+supplement+knight+blood+relations+peter+redgrove&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qgE__d9vu4&amp;sig=Cn6Bnwlcq0b04MJ4oX3MMk3dsv4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ku0GT6KvMtGd8gPitr2kDw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Chris Knight, ''Blood Relations'']; [http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/category/reviews/ Reviews of ''Blood Relation'']; Chris Stringer, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=U2qDI94mJYAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=chris+stringer+human+evolution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1OQGT7fZFIXr8QPgzp29Cg&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22chris%20knight%22&amp;f=false''The Origin of Our Species''].&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''World Mime Organisation''' (Abbreviation: WMO; French: Organisation Mondiale des Mimes; Abbreviation: WMM) was officially registered on January 4, 2004. in Belgrade, Serbia (at that time still [[State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]]). WMO is a non-governmental, non-profit organization founded with the mission to further develop and promote the art of mime and non-verbal communication. World Mime Organisation does not emphasis any mime techniques or styles nor teaching, accepting that all organized effort, knowledge and expression should be respected and should find its audience.

==History==
The creators of the World Mime Organisation are [[Marko Stojanović (actor)|Marko Stojanović]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domomladine.org/vesti/obelezavanje-svetskog-dana-pantomime-u-domu-omladine-beograda/ Дом омладине Београда/Обележавање светског дана пантомиме у Дому омладине Београда ]&lt;/ref&gt; a Serbian actor, professor and mime artist and Ofer Blum, mime artist from Israel. Both were students of the Paris International School of Mimodrama Marcel Marceau ([[Ecole International de Mimodrame da Paris Marcel Marceau]]) in the early 1990's.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

In 1998, Stojanovic organized a tour in Serbia (at that time [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]) for Ofer Blum and they discussed the necessity of organizing and uniting mime artists around the world. The idea was just a note on a piece of paper till 2004 when World Mime Organisation was officially registered. Belgrade, Serbia (State Union of Serbia and Montenegro) was chosen for head quarters of WMO because the administrative work needed was the simplest and the costs were the lowest and Stojanovic was chosen to be the president&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bosifest.rs/sr/sadrzaj/655/2010/ Bosifest/Žiri festivala]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INTERNATIONELLT MIM-PRIS TILL STANISLAV BROSOWSKI|url=http://www.uniarts.se/aktuellt/nyheter/pris-till-stanislav-brosowski|website=Stockholm University of the Arts|publisher=Stockholm University of the Arts|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the organization and Ofer Blum the vice-president.

The association statutes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serbian Business Registers Agency|url=http://pretraga.apr.gov.rs/AssociationWebSearch/AssociationStatues.aspx?beid=4737559&amp;rnd=14B98D83477D7A71D968DC3163E111F612D385C7|website=Serbian Business Registers Agency|publisher=Serbian Business Registers Agency|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the WMO were adopted on April 18, 2011. Being an international organization since its first day of existence World Mime Organisation uses English and French as the official languages and Serbian as the legal language because it operates under the laws of the Republic of Serbia.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

== Objectives ==
The main objectives of the World Mime Organisation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About WMO|url=http://www.uniarts.se/storage/ma/8a14ed25a3a54dcba7efb42d6198331e/91b114422cdf4a18b26560851eace83a/doc/2CA96AF0B9C4E31C2BA67486ABFB4D140CC8AC83/About%20WMO.doc|website=Stockholm University of the Arts|publisher=Stockholm University of the Arts|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are to "establish relations, help and bring together" mime artists, mime educators, producers and world-wide audience, students, amateurs, hearing impaired and other vulnerable social groups, media and institutions.

== World Mime Day ==
[[World Mime Day]] is an initiative of the World Mime Organisation to celebrate the Art of Mime and non-verbal communication on March 22, the day of birth of legendary French mime artist Marcel Marceau. It has been celebrated since 2011. World Mime Day is not officially recognized by UNESCO.
Since 2016 the World Mime Day Wiki Edit-a-Thon has been organized by local [[Wikimedia movement|Wikimedia]] chapters and local persons or institution involved in mime together with the World Mime Organisation with the aim of enriching the knowledge, photo and multimedia content about mime on Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Mime Day Wiki Edit-a-Thon 2017|url=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/World_Mime_Day_Wiki_edit-a-thon_2017|website=Wikimedia|publisher=Wikimedia|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== WMO Awards ==
The World Mime Organisation has decided in 2015 to establish two "Special WMO Awards", one for the individuals and the other for institutions.
The '''"Special WMO Award for the Outstanding Contribution to the Art of Mime"''' that is dedicated for individuals and '''"Special WMO Award for Promotion and Development of the Art of Mime'''" is dedicated to institutions.

'''Special WMO Award for the Outstanding Contribution to the Art of Mime'''

This is an award dedicated to mime personalities, individuals that have contributed so much to their national and international community through the art of mime by practicing it and/or teaching it.
"Some of the laureates think of this award as of the Life Achievement Award but we believe that even if some of them are in their late 70's, 80's they still have horizons to reach, new heights to achieve and share their art and knowledge with the world.
This award is a simple but official way for the international mime community gathered in the World Mime Organisation to say "THANK YOU" to the laureates.&lt;ref&gt;www.worldmime.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The first laureate in 2015 was Amiran Shalikashvili a Georgian mime artist and one of the founders of mime in the Georgia and [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR), founder of the Georgian State Pantomime Theatre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International Shalikashvili Mime Fest in Tbilisi|url=http://www.georgianjournal.ge/arts-a-culture/32550-international-shalikashvili-mime-fest-in-tbilisi.html|accessdate=27 May 2016|agency=Georgian Journal|publisher=Georgian Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of Mime at the [[Shota Rustaveli Theatre and Film University|Shota Rustaveli Theatre and Georgia State Film University (TAFU]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bolkvadze|first1=Eva|title=Journalist|url=http://www.georgianjournal.ge/arts-a-culture/26932-georgian-pantomime-legend.html|accessdate=17 April 2014|agency=Georgian Journal|publisher=Georgian Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same award was presented to professor [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanisław_Brzozowski_(Pantomime) Stanislaw Brosowski] of the Stockholm Academy of Dramatic Arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INTERNATIONELLT MIM-PRIS TILL STANISLAV BROSOWSKI|url=http://www.uniarts.se/aktuellt/nyheter/pris-till-stanislav-brosowski|website=Stockholm University of the Arts|publisher=Stockholm University of the Arts|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Swedish mime artist of Polish origins and a founder of the Department for Mime Acting at the [[Stockholm Academy of Dramatic Arts|Stockholm Academy for Dramatic Arts]].

'''Special WMO Award for Promotion and Development of the Art of Mime'''

This award is dedicated to institutions that have been promoting and developing mime for decades and are still active. We see institutions as organisational and not necessarily  physical structures where people come together to interact and share. Share their art, knowledge, thoughts, ideas, principles, feelings.
This award is for theatres, schools, festivals, theatre or production companies, media...Without people the institutions would not exist. With this award we want to say a simple THANK YOU to teams, all the people that have built in the past and those that are still building the Laureate Institution.&lt;ref&gt;www.worldmime.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zangbeto''' are the traditional [[West African Vodun|voodoo]] guardians of the night in the [[Yoruba religion]] of [[Benin]] and [[Togo]] which are known as the "Nightwatchmen". Similar to [[Egungun]]s, they are highly revered and act as an unofficial police force patrolling the streets, watching over people and tracking down criminals and presenting them to the community to punish.&lt;ref name="Ref_"&gt;{{Harvnb|Butler|2006|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally created to scare the enemy away, Zangbeto will wander around the streets to detect thieves and witches, and to provide law and order.

==Description==
Zangbeto are a costume that resembles a haystack. They are able to fall into a trance which, according to tradition, enables their bodies to be inhabited by spirits who possess special knowledge of the actions of people.&lt;ref name="Ref_" /&gt; However Yoruba legend tells that there are no humans under the costume, only spirits of the night.

Traditionally, the Zangbetos were the policemen of Benin and were the main guardians of law in the country before the official law establishment. They are said to form a secret society which can only be strictly attended by Zangbetos, and when in a trance are said to have magical abilities, such as swallowing splinters of glass without coming to any harm and scaring away even witches.&lt;ref name="Ref_" /&gt;
In a trance, the Zangbeto are said to evoke a power that inhabited the earth long before the appearance of man and provide a source of wisdom and continuity for the people of Benin.
