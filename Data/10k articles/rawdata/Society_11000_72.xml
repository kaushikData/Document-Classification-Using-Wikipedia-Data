The '''Age Discrimination Act 2004''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Australia]] that prohibits [[age discrimination]] in many areas including [[employment]], [[education]], [[lodging|accommodation]] and the provision of goods and services. Persons of any age can be discriminated against within the meaning of the act.

Some exemptions are provided, including for [[religious organisation]]s, [[charitable organisation]]s and [[positive discrimination]].

Complaints of discrimination must first be made to the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] (AHRC), where a [[conciliation]] process can be initiated. Filing a complaint is free.&lt;ref name="ahrc1"&gt;[https://www.humanrights.gov.au/complaints-under-age-discrimination-act "Complaints under the Age Discrimination Act"], [[Australian Human Rights Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt; If the complaint is not resolved through the conciliation process, it can be taken to the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] or the [[Federal Circuit Court of Australia|Federal Circuit Court]].

In general, age discrimination is not a criminal offence. However, the Act creates criminal offences of discriminatory advertising, victimisation and failure to disclose statistical or actuarial data upon request by the President of the AHRC. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/sites/default/files/content/legal/FDL/2011/2_Age.pdf|title=Federal Discrimination Law|at=Section 2.1.4|date=21 October 2011|publisher=[[Australian Human Rights Commission]]|access-date = 11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and political career==
Karzai was born in 1961 in the village of [[Karz, Kandahar|Karz]] in [[Kandahar Province]], Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|title=Profile: Ahmad Wali Karzai |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8332532.stm|author=Alastair Lawson|work=BBC News|date=26 May 2010|accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the son of [[Abdul Ahad Karzai]] and brother of [[Hamid Karzai]], [[Mahmud Karzai]] and [[Qayum Karzai]]. He attended [[Habibia High School]] in [[Kabul]] but was not able to finish his studies due to the [[Soviet–Afghan War]]. He travelled to neighbouring [[Pakistan]] and then immigrated to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2011/07/13/wali-karzai-laid-rest Wali Karzai laid to rest]. Pajhwok.com.

He came to political prominence in Afghanistan following the US occupation of the country in 2001, where he was a key ally of the US military in the country's south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/world-south-asia-14114771|title=Obituary: Ahmad Wali Karzai|last=Lawson|first=Alastair|date=12 July 2011|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=12 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719141357/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/world-south-asia-14114771|archivedate=19 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the [[Kandahar Provincial Council]] in 2005 and exercised influence in the province to the extent that he was described as "effectively the governor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/07/201171283244784171.html|title=Obituary: Ahmed Wali Karzai |date=12 July 2011|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|accessdate=12 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712123322/http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/07/201171283244784171.html|archivedate=12 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, he was the Council's chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/8632131/Ahmad-Wali-Karzai-assassination-huge-propaganda-boost-for-Taliban.html|title=Ahmad Wali Karzai assassination 'huge propaganda boost for Taliban'|last=Ramakrishnan|first=Arvind|date=12 July 2011|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=12 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712201614/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/8632131/Ahmad-Wali-Karzai-assassination-huge-propaganda-boost-for-Taliban.html|archivedate=12 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days before his death, Ahmed Wali Karzai appeared on a British television programme, "Afghanistan: The Unknown Country," presented by [[Lyse Doucet]], at his home in Kandahar, talking about public perceptions of him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-14129187 BBC News: "Ahmad Wali Karzai: Meeting Kandahar's Mr Fix-it", 12 July 2011]. BBC News (2011-05-29). Retrieved on 2011-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Doucet said: "Like most strong men, he depended on family and fellow tribesmen to protect him."

==Allegations of corruption==
A June 2009 [[U.S. Embassy, Kabul|U.S. embassy]] cable alleged that much of the actual business of running the Afghan city of Kandahar "takes place out of public sight, where Ahmed Wali Karzai operates, parallel to formal government structures, through a network of political clans that use state institutions to protect and enable licit and illicit enterprises." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/02/us-karzai-half-brother-wikileaks US convinced Karzai half-brother is corrupt, WikiLeaks cables say] by Jonathan Steele, [[The Guardian (UK)|''The Guardian'']], 2 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[James Risen]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and others&lt;ref name="Mirage of the Good War"/&gt; stated that Ahmed Wali Karzai may have been involved in the [[opium production in Afghanistan|Afghan opium and heroin trade]]. This was denied by Karzai, who called the charges political [[propaganda]] and stated he was a "victim of vicious politics."&lt;ref name="risen"&gt;{{cite news|first=James|last=Risen|authorlink=James Risen|title=Reports Link Karzai's Brother to Afghan Heroin Trade |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/world/asia/05afghan.html?ref=asia|work=The New York Times|location=United States |id= |date=4 October 2008|accessdate=5 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In meetings with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, including a 2006 session with former [[United States Ambassador to Afghanistan|US Ambassador to Afghanistan]], [[Ronald E. Neumann]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s station chief and their British counterparts, American officials talked about the rumors in hopes that the president might move his brother out of the country, said several people who took part in or were briefed on the talks. "We thought the concern expressed to Karzai might be enough to get him out of there," one official said. President Karzai has resisted, however, demanding clear-cut evidence of wrongdoing, several officials said. "We don't have the kind of hard, direct evidence that you could take to get a criminal indictment," a [[White House]] official said.&lt;ref name="risen" /&gt; Ahmed Wali Karzai dismissed the allegations as politically motivated attacks by longtime rival groups in his country.

Before the [[Afghan presidential election, 2009|2009 Afghan presidential election]], Wali Karzai and [[Sher Mohammad Akhundzada]], former governor of the [[Helmand Province]] and a member of the [[Meshrano Jirga|Upper House]] of the Afghan parliament, were accused of vote rigging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6792729.ece |title=President Karzai’s supporters ‘buy’ votes for Afghanistan election |date=12 August 2009 |work=The Times |location=UK |author=Tom Coghlan |accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the election, reports mentioned that all those running in the election were involved in [[electoral fraud]].

==CIA connections==
In October 2009 ''The New York Times'' reported that Ahmed Wali Karzai received payments from the [[CIA]] for "a variety of services", including the recruitment of the [[Kandahar Strike Force]], an [[ANA Commando Brigade|Afghan paramilitary force]] run by the CIA in the Kandahar region. It also stated that he was paid for allowing the CIA and [[United States special operations forces|U.S. special forces]] to rent the former residence of Taliban supreme leader [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; However, Karzai has denied taking any payment from the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, Gerald (28 October 2009).

''[[The Daily Beast]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[John Kerry]] and former [[Afghanistan – United States relations|Afghan Ambassador to the United States]], [[Said Tayeb Jawad]], defended Karzai in recent years, Kerry saying "We should not condemn Ahmed Wali Karzai or damage our critical relations with his brother, President Karzai, on the basis of newspaper articles or rumors"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hCHv88Vg95pGUC2KXpUHvJ1S9MkQ Kerry calls for briefing on Karzai brother], AFP, 28 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;statement made 28 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and Jawad saying, "There is presence of the intelligence, there's presence of many institutions of the United States and [[NATO]] countries in Afghanistan, why don't they come up with a clear evidence of any corruption involving the president or his family?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/07/05/karzai-has-less-50000-his-bank-account-jawad Karzai has less than $50,000 in his bank account: Jawad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328035333/http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/07/05/karzai-has-less-50000-his-bank-account-jawad |date=28 March 2012 }}, Pajhwok, 5 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Said Tayeb Jawad]] on 5 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 July 2011, Karzai was assassinated by his long-time head of security, Sardar Mohammad.

Thousands of people turned up for his funeral the next day, led by Afghan President Hamid Karzai, and many more waited in buses where his body lay to be taken to his hometown of [[Karz, Kandahar|Karz]].

[[Taliban]] spokesman [[Mohammad Yousef Ahmadi|Qari Yousef Ahmadi]] claimed that one of their agents was behind the assassination saying, "Today in Kandahar city, Hamid Karzai's brother was killed during the Operation al-Badr... We hired a person by the name of Sadar Mohammad, who was hired for this job for some time now. Ahmed Wali Karzai was punished for all his wrongdoings."&lt;ref name=msnbc/&gt;

However, according to ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', the Taliban has "a dubious record of claiming responsibility for attacks it had nothing to do with",&lt;ref name=csmonitor&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2011/0712/What-Ahmed-Wali-Karzai-s-assassination-could-mean-for-Afghanistan What Ahmed Wali Karzai's assassination could mean for Afghanistan], by Tom A.

Abdul Ghafar Sayedzada, head of the counter-terrorism department at the [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Interior Ministry]], told [[Reuters]] that "It appears Ahmed Wali Karzai has been killed by one of his bodyguard, and there was nobody from outside involved."&lt;ref name=msnbc /&gt; The news was confirmed by Zalmai Ayubi, the spokesman for Kandahar province, as well as by Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the Ministry of Interior. Following the killing, police were mobilised in Kandahar and helicopters were seen overhead as checkpoints were locked down leading towards the hospital his body was taken to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2011/07/20117127299662659.html |title=Karzai's brother shot dead in Kandahar |date=12 July 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigations===
Investigators believe that Sardar Mohammad may have been a Taliban [[sleeper agent]] or a government defector. [[Mahmud Karzai]], Karzai's other brother, stated that Sardar Mohammad traveled to the Pakistani city of [[Quetta]] within the past three months to meet with the [[Quetta Shura|Shura Council]] of the Taliban. Mahmoud Karzai claimed that he has been acting very erratically in recent weeks, including [[insomnia|sleeping poorly]], moving from house to house during nights, acting suspiciously toward his men and demanding to know who they were talking to on their [[mobile phone]]s. It suggests that he may have been using [[narcotic]]s since the area is well known for [[Opium production in Afghanistan|opium production]].&lt;ref&gt;http://in.news.yahoo.com/karzais-killer-traveled-pak-meet-taliban-insurgents-weeks-120015970.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahuitzotl''' ({{lang-nah|[[wikt:ahuitzotl|āhuitzotl]]}}, {{IPA-nah|aːˈwit͡sot͡ɬ|-|Awisotl.ogg}}) was the eighth  [[Aztec]] ruler, the ''[[Hueyi Tlatoani]]'' of the city of [[Tenochtitlan]], son of princess [[Atotoztli II]]. He was responsible for much of the expansion of the Mexica domain, and consolidated the empire's power after emulating his predecessor. He took power as [[tlatoani]] in the year [[Aztec calendar|7 Rabbit]] (1486), after the death of his predecessor and brother, [[Tizoc]].

His sons were kings [[Chimalpilli II]] and [[Cuauhtémoc]] and he also had one daughter.

== Biography ==
Perhaps the greatest known military leader of [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], Ahuizotl began his reign by suppressing a [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]] rebellion, and then swiftly more than doubled the size of lands under Aztec dominance. He conquered the [[Mixtec]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], and other peoples from [[Pacific Coast of Mexico]] down to the western part of [[Guatemala]]. Ahuizotl also supervised a major rebuilding of Tenochtitlan on a grander scale including the expansion of the Great Pyramid or [[Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan|Templo Mayor]] in the year [[Aztec calendar|8 Reed]] (1487).

He presided over the introduction of the [[great-tailed grackle]] into the Valley of Mexico, the earliest documented case of human-mediated bird introduction in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Introduction of the Great-tailed Grackle (''Quiscalus mexicanus'') by Aztec Emperor Auitzotl: Provenance of the historical account (La Introducción de la Quiscalus mexicanus por el Emperador Azteca Auitzotl: Origen del Relato Histórico)|first=Paul D.|last=Haemig|work=The Auk|volume=129|number=1|date=January 2012|pages=70–75|publisher=University of California Press|jstor=10.1525/auk.2011.11058|doi=10.1525/auk.2011.11058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahuizotl died in the year [[Aztec calendar|10 Rabbit]] (1502) and was succeeded by his nephew, [[Moctezuma II]].

Ahuizotl took his name from the [[Ahuizotl (creature)|animal ahuizotl]], which the Aztecs considered to be a legendary creature in its own right rather than a mere mythical representation of the king.

==In popular culture==
* Under the name Teomitl, Ahuitzotl is a primary character in the ''Obsidian and Blood'' series by [[Aliette de Bodard]], which are set in the last year of the reign of [[Axayacatl]] and the first years of the reign of [[Tizoc]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7125">An '''amplified conference''' is a conference or similar event in which the talks and discussions at the conference are 'amplified' through use of networked technologies in order to extend the reach of the conference deliberations. The term was originally coined by [[Lorcan Dempsey]] in a blog post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =Dempsey, Lorcan |title=The amplified conference|url=http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/001404.html|date=July 25, 2007|accessdate=2008-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is now widely used within the academic and research community with Wankel &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =Wankel, Charles |title=Higher Education Administration with Social Media|isbn=0857246518}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposing the following definition:

&lt;cite&gt;''The extension of a physical event (or a series of events) through the use of social media tools for expanding access to (aspects of) the event beyond physical and temporal bounds. Such amplification takes place in the context of intent to make the most of the intellectual content, discussion, networking, and discovery initiated by the event through the process of sharing with co-attendees, colleagues, friends and wider informed publics.''&lt;/cite&gt;

A paper by &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Haider, Jutta |author2=Huvila, Isto |author3=Cox, Andrew |author4=Francke, Helena |author5=Hall, Hazel |title=Transformation or continuity? The impact of social media on information: implications for theory and practice|url=https://www.asis.org/asist2012/proceedings/Submissions/101.pdf|accessdate=2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates how amplified conferences are becoming mainstream in a discussion on "''how social media have been employed as part of the project, particularly around event amplification''".

As described by Guy in the Ariadne ejournal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =Guy, Marieke|title=10 Cheap and Easy Ways to Amplify Your Event|url=http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue66/guy/|date=January 30, 2011|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term is not a prescriptive one, but rather describes a pattern of behaviors which initially took place at IT and Web-oriented conferences once WiFi networks started to become available at conference venues and delegates started to bring with them networked devices such as laptops and, more recently, PDAs and mobile phones.

==Different Approaches to 'Amplification' of Conferences==
There are a number of ways in which conferences can be amplified through use of networked technologies:

*Amplification of the audiences' voice: Prior to the availability of real time chat technologies at events (whether use of IRC, [[Twitter]], instant messaging clients, etc.) it was only feasible to discuss talks with immediate neighbours, and even then this may be considered rude.
* Amplification of the speaker's talk: The availability of video and audio-conferencing technologies make it possible for a speaker to be heard by an audience which isn't physically present at the conference. Although use of video technologies has been available to support conferences for some time, this has normally been expensive and require use of dedicated video-conferencing technologies. However the availability of lightweight desktop tools make it much easier to deploy such technologies, without even, requiring the involvement of conference organisers.
* Amplification across time: Video and audio technologies can also be used to allow a speaker's talk to be made available after the event, with use of podcasting or videocasting technologies allowing the talks to be easily syndicated to mobile devices as well as accessed on desktop computers.
* Amplification of the speaker's slides: The popularity of global repository services for slides, such as [[SlideShare]], enable the slides used by a speaker to be more easily found, embedded on other Web sites and commented upon, in ways that were not possible when the slides, if made available at all, were only available on a conference Web site.
* Amplification of feedback to the speaker: Micro-blogging technologies, such as Twitter, are being used not only as a discussion channel for conference participants but also as a way of providing real-time feedback to a speaker during a talk. We are also now seeing dedicated microblogging technologies, such as [[Coveritlive]] and [[ScribbleLive|Scribblelive]], being developed which aim to provide more sophisticated 'back channels' for use at conferences.
* Amplification of a conference's collective memory: The popularity of digital cameras and the photographic capabilities of many mobile phones is leading to many photographs being taken at conferences. With such photographs often being uploaded to popular photographic sharing services, such as Flickr, and such collections being made more easy to discover through agreed use of tags, we are seeing amplification of the memories of an event though the sharing of such resources. The ability of such photographic resources to be 'mashed up' with, say, accompanying music, can similarly help to enrich such collective experiences.
* Amplification of the learning: The ability to be able to follow links to resources and discuss the points made by a speaker during a talk can enrich the learning which takes place at an event, as described by Shabajee's article on "'Hot' or Not? Welcome to real-time peer review" published in the Times Higher Educational Supplement in May 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author =Shabajee, Paul |title='Hot' or Not? Welcome to real-time peer review|url=http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/~edxps/publications/hot_or_not.html |date=August 1, 2003|accessdate=2008-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Long term amplification of conference outputs: The availability in a digital format of conference resources, including 'official' resources such as slides,  video and audio recordings, etc. which have been made by the conference organisers with the approval of speakers, together with more nebulous resources such as archives of conference back channels, and photographs and unofficial recordings taken at the event may help to provide a more authentic record of an event, which could potentially provide a valuable historical record.

The amplification of conferences can be viewed as an example of how new technologies are altering standard practice. By using these techniques a different type of interaction is created at the conference itself, but also the boundaries around the conference can be seen as permeable, with remote participants engaging in discussion. An amplified conference also provides a considerably altered archive compared with a 'traditional' one. For the latter, the printed proceedings will be the main record, but for an amplified event this record is distributed across many media and takes in a wider range of content types, including the papers, videos of the presentations (for example on YouTube), the slides (e.g. on Slideshare), photos of the event (Flickr), interaction between participants (Twitter), reflections and comments (blogs), etc. The amplified conference represents an example of changing practice in digital scholarship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1849">The '''Asociación Nacional de Mujeres Españolas''' (ANME), was a women's rights organisation active in [[Spain]] from 1918 to 1936.

It was not the first women's rights movement in Spain, but was to last longer than any of its predecessors. It was founded in [[Madrid]] in 1918 by [[Consuelo Gonzalez Ramos]] and [[Maria Espinosa de los Monteros]]. Its purpose was to work for women's rights, particularly [[women suffrage]]. It had no support from the Catholic church or any political party, and relied on contributes from sympathizers, and had its meetings on the home of its presidents. In 1919, the ANME founded the [[umbrella organisation]] [[Consejo Feminista de España]] together with the other smaller women's organisations: the [[Sociedad Progresiva Femenina]] and [[La Mujer del Porvenir]] in [[Barcelona]], and the [[Sociedad Concepción Arenal]] and [[Liga para el Progreso de la Mujer]] in [[Valencia]].

From 1921, it published its own paper, the ''Mundo Femenino''.

In 1934, the organisation founded a political feminist party, the [[Acción Política Feminista Independiente]], who tried unsuccessfully to join the leftist coalition. Both the party and the organisation was dissolved under the Spanish civil war.

The '''Australian Computer Society''' ('''ACS''') is an association for [[Information technology|information and communications technology]] professionals with over 26,000 members Australia-wide.  According to its Constitution, its objects are "to advance professional excellence in information technology" and "to promote the development of Australian information and communications technology resources".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.acs.org.au/ Australian Computer Society – Home]. www.acs.org.au. Retrieved 15 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACS was formed on 1 January 1966 from five state based societies. It was formally incorporated in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] on 3 October 1967. Since 1983 there have been chapters in every state and territory.

The ACS is a member of the Australian Council of Professions ("Professions Australia"), the peak body for professional associations in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.professions.com.au/about-us/members/item/australian-computer-society Member: Australian Computer Society]. www.professions.com.au. Retrieved 18 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, ACS is a member of the International Professional Practice Partnership (IP3), [[South East Asia Regional Computer Confederation]], [[International Federation for Information Processing]] and The [[Seoul Accord]].&lt;ref name=About/&gt;

The ACS is also a member organisation of the [[Federation of Enterprise Architecture Professional Organizations]] (FEAPO), a worldwide association of professional organisations which have come together to provide a forum to standardise, professionalise, and otherwise advance the discipline of [[Enterprise Architecture]].

== Activities ==

The ACS operates various chapters, annual conferences,
[[Special Interest Group]]s, and a professional development program. Members are required to comply with a Code of Ethics and a Code of Professional Conduct.

== Extent of representation ==
The ACS describes itself as "the professional association for Australia's Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector"&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us |url=https://www.acs.org.au/about-the-acs/about-us |website=Australian Computer Society |accessdate=3 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RXxnQAS6?url=https://www.acs.org.au/about-the-acs/about-us |archivedate=3 August 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Australia's primary representative body for the ICT workforce",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The art of conversation|journal=Information Age|date=July–August 2013|page=24|url=https://acs.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/21004/ALL_IA_JulyAugust_2013.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2014|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812211714/https://acs.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/21004/ALL_IA_JulyAugust_2013.pdf|archive-date=12 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but industry analysts have questioned this based on the small percentage of IT professionals who are ACS members.

== Education and Certification ==

The ACS runs the online Computer Professional Education Program (CPEP) for postgraduate education in subjects including: Green ICT Strategies; New Technology Alignment; Business, Strategy &amp; IT; Adaptive Business Intelligence; Project Management; Managing Technology and Operations. CPEP uses the Australian developed [[Moodle]] course management system and is delivered via the web.

The Diploma of Information Technology (DIT) is equivalent to one academic year of a Bachelor of Information Technology at several universities. It has eight compulsory subjects: systems analysis, programming, computer organisation, data management, OO systems development, computer communications, professional practice and systems principles.

The ACS also certifies IT professionals at two levels, the Certified Professional and the Certified Technologist.  Each certification level has a minimum level of experience and also required ongoing CPD (Certified Professional Development) hours of learning each year. In 2017 the ACS launched a cybersecurity specialisation within the certification framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/cybersecurity-specialisation-status-up-for-grabs-with-new-acs-accreditation-program/|title=Cybersecurity specialisation status up for grabs with new ACS accreditation program {{!}} ZDNet|last=McLean|first=Asha|publisher=ZDNet|access-date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|Confess}}
[[File:The Progress of Love - Love Letters - Fragonard 1771-72.jpg|thumb|''Confession of Love'' by [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]] depicts a subject confessing feelings that had been concealed up to that point.]]

A '''confession''' is a statement – made by a person or by a group of persons – acknowledging some personal fact that the person (or the group) would ostensibly prefer to keep hidden. The term presumes that the speaker is providing information that he believes the other party is not already aware of,&lt;ref name="Shuy"&gt;Roger W. Shuy, ''The Language of Confession, Interrogation, and Deception'' (1998), p. 2–10.&lt;/ref&gt; and is frequently associated with an admission of a moral or legal wrong:
{{quote|In one sense it is the acknowledgment of having done something wrong, whether on purpose or not. Thus confessional texts usually provide information of a private nature previously unavailable. What a sinner tells a priest in the confessional, the documents criminals sign acknowledging what they have done, an autobiography in which the author acknowledges mistakes, and so on, are all examples of confessional texts.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge J. E. Gracia, ''A Theory of Textuality: The Logic and Epistemology'' (1995), p. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Not all confessions reveal wrongdoing, however. For example, a confession of [[love]] is often considered positive both by the confessor and by the recipient of the confession, and is a common theme in literature.&lt;ref&gt;Giulio Marra, ''Shakespeare and this "imperfect" World: Dramatic Form and the Nature of Knowing'' (1997), p. 69, describing "the distinction between "to do" and "to confess", between having thoughts of love and confessing one's love, between the indetermination of a feeling and its final definition", as a theme that "creeps into the various stories".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Emil Kany, ''The Beginnings of the Epistolary Novel in France, Italy and Spain'' (1937), Volume 21, Issues 1-6, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to confessions of wrongdoing, there are several specific kinds of confessions that have significance beyond the social. A [[Confession (law)|legal confession]] involves an admission of some wrongdoing that has legal consequence, while the concept of [[Confession (religion)|confession in religion]] varies widely across various belief systems, and is usually more akin to a [[ritual]] by which the person acknowledges thoughts or actions considered [[sin]]ful or morally wrong within the confines of the confessor's religion. In some religions, confession takes the form of an [[oral communication]] to another person. Socially, however, the term may refer to admissions that are neither legally nor religiously significant.&lt;ref name="Shuy"/&gt;

== Psychology ==
Confession often benefits the one who is confessing . [[Paul Wilkes]] characterizes confession as "a pillar of mental health" because of its ability to relieve [[anxiety|anxieties]] associated with keeping [[Secrecy|secrets]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
| last1                 = Wilkes
| first1                = Paul

| page                  = xi
| isbn                  = 9780761168720
| quote                 = Confession is also a pillar of mental health, for confession is about self-examination. It demands something for which there is no substitute: that we be honest with ourselves.
}}&lt;!--| accessdate            = 2015-07-27--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
Confessants are more likely to confess when the expected benefits outweigh the marginal costs (when the benefit of the offense to them is high, the cost to the victim is low, and the probability of information leakage is high).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last1= Sznycer|first1= Daniel|last2= Schniter|first2= Eric|last3= Tooby|first3= John|last4= Cosmides|first4= Leda|title= Regulatory adaptations for delivering information: The case of confession|journal= Evolution and Human Behavior|date= 5 September 2014|doi= 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.08.008|pmc= 4313746}}
&lt;/ref&gt; People may undertake social confessions in order to relieve feelings of guilt or to seek forgiveness from a wronged party, but such confessions may also serve to create social bonds between the confessant and the confessor, and may prompt the listener to reply with confessions of their own.&lt;ref name="Shuy"/&gt; A person may therefore confess wrongdoing to another person as a means of creating such a social bond, or of extracting [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocal]] information from the other person.&lt;ref name="Shuy"/&gt; A confession may be made in a self-aggrandizing manner, as a way for the confessant to claim credit for a misdeed for the purpose of eliciting a reaction to that claim.&lt;ref name="Shuy"/&gt;

==Law==
{{main|Confession (law)|Statement against interest}}
In law, there is [[declaration against interest|an exception]] to the [[hearsay]] rule that allows testimony concerning someone else's confession to be admitted if the statement had a great enough tendency "to expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability". The theory is that a reasonable person would not make such a [[false confession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_804|title= Rule 804. Hearsay Exceptions; Declarant Unavailable|author= |date= |work= LII / Legal Information Institute|access-date= 28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In U.S. law, a confession must be [[voluntariness|voluntary]] in order to be admissible.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Confessions (whether [[forced confession | forced]] or otherwise) may feature in formal or informal [[show trial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;
Note for example:

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Socialisation==
Public confessions play a role in [[struggle session]]s&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = During a 'study' session, the person receiving criticism usually makes a substantial verbal response of some sort. [...] In contrast, objects of a struggle session are typically expected to bow their heads contritely, bend forward at the waist, and succinctly confess their guilt ''[ren zui]''. [...] The required parts of the struggle session ritual include the stage or platform where the bowed objects of the strugle stand contritely next to gesticulating and slogan-shouting cadres or other leaders, along with the audience seated nearby, who parrot the slogans in a shouted refrain. For example, Song Shan remarks that all seventy-six times she was subjected to a struggle session in front of thousands of people, the format of the event was exactly the same.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
and in other methods of [[social control]] and influence involving [[self-criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Crime in Italy''' is combated by the spectrum of [[Law enforcement in Italy|Italian law enforcement agencies]].

== Crime by type ==
=== Murder ===
{{Further|List of countries by intentional homicide rate}}
In 2012, national murder rate was about 0.9 per 100,000 population, one of the lower rates in Western Europe.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; There were a total of 530 murders in Italy in 2012.&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/index.html ''Global Study on Homicide''. [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organized crime ===
{{see also|Organized crime in Italy}}

[[File:Mappa del Pizzo.svg|thumb|250px|The incidence of ''[[Pizzo (extortion)|Pizzo]]'' (extortion) by organised crime across [[Provinces of Italy|Italy's provinces]].]]

Many worldwide crime organizations originated in [[Italy]], and its influence is widespread in Italian society, directly affecting a reported 22% of citizens and 14.6% of Italy's Gross Domestic Product.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|author=Tom Kington in Rome |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/01/mafia-influence-hovers-over-italians |title=Mafia's influence hovers over 13m Italians, says report &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2009-10-01|accessdate=2010-07-10 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public figures such as former Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] have been charged with association in organized criminal acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8395280.stm |title=Mafia witness 'boasted of links to Silvio Berlusconi' |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-12-04 |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; War against organized crime caused hundreds of murders, including judges ([[Giovanni Falcone]] and [[Paolo Borsellino]]) and lawyers (like [[Roberto Calvi]]).

There are several separate criminal organizations controlling territory and business activities: [[Sicily|Sicilian]] ''[[Cosa Nostra]]'', [[Campania|Campanian]] ''[[Camorra]]'', [[Calabria|Calabrese]] ''[['Ndrangheta]]'' and  [[Apulia|Apulian]] ''[[Sacra Corona Unita]]''. More than 13 million people are involved into crime web. Their business involvement is on a European and global scale.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/15/italy-mafia-law |title=Italy's 'coexistence' with the mafia &amp;#124; Roberto Mancini &amp;#124; Comment is free &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2008-06-17 |accessdate=2010-07-10 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in [[Naples]] an unusual high homicide rate and several drug addicted people have qualified the town as the most dangerous in West Europe.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2017/07/18/naples-among-worlds-10-most-dangerous-cities-sun-5_d304e6fd-cd74-4bae-a0b7-cd7952c140e3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses, entrepreneurs, shopkeepers, and craftsmen in these regions are expected to pay a ''[[pizzo (extortion)|protection money]]''. There is rarely any possibility of escaping payment, and those not complying find their business premises and lives at risk. People not able to meet demands might find their business partly or completely taken over by organized crime.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;

In 2009, organized crime in Italy generated $189 billion in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.havocscope.com/organized-crime-in-italy-generated-189-billion-in-revenue-in-2009/| title= Organized Crime in Italy generated $189 Billion in revenue in 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual violence ===
Italy has a lower per capita rate of rape than most of the advanced Western countries in the European Union.&lt;ref name="NationMaster.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_rap-crime-rapes|title=Crime Statistics &gt; Rapes (most recent) by country |accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Police authorities data, the rate of sexual assaults per 100,000 inhabitants is significantly higher in the Northern region than in the Southern ones. In 2009, Lombardia and Emilia Romagna were the regions with the highest rate of sexual offences per 100.000 inhabitants (9.7); followed by [[Trentino Alto Adige]] and [[Tuscany]] (9.5); Piedmont and Liguria (8.6); Umbria (8.4). In this respect, all major Southern regions like Sicily (6.8); Calabria (6.5); Puglia (6.2); Campania (6,0) were the safest in the national territory, with the only exception of Friuli Venezia Giulia (5.1) in the North.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interno.gov.it/mininterno/export/sites/default/it/assets/files/21/0501_sintesi_rapporto_icsa.pdf Marzio Barbagli &amp; Asher Colombo (2010) Rapporto sulla criminalità e sicurezza in Italia 2010] Sintesi, pag. 6. Ministero dell'Interno (accessed on 14 July 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fraud ===
Fraud is a major contributor to Italy's crime rate, with some level of fraud appearing in all sectors of the economy since the country's founding in 1861. Notable cases of financial fraud include the collapse of [[Parmalat]] in the early years of the 21st century, and the [[Lockheed bribery scandal]] in the 1970s.
 
Insurance fraud also dramatically increases the cost of insurance in Italy, with 115,646 incidents of fraudulent claims in 2001 alone, with 3.28 percent of all claims in 2002 ascertained to have involved fraud. The percentage rose above ten percent in some of the southern provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bilanciounipol.it/E2003/IT/rapport/04_relazione_sociale/01_clienti/frodi_assicurative.htm |title=Le frodi assicurative - Bilancio sociale 2004, Unipol Assicurazioni |publisher=Bilanciounipol.it |date= |accessdate=2011-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910143546/http://www.bilanciounipol.it/E2003/IT/rapport/04_relazione_sociale/01_clienti/frodi_assicurative.htm |archivedate=2011-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

State employees have been perceived to have such a high rate of absenteeism, often feigning illness, that in 2008 the government introduced a law to harshly prosecute civil servants who are found to be making fraudulent claims about their health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flcgil.it/rassegna-stampa/nazionale/repubblica-statali-finti-malati-e-truffa-aggravata.flc |title=Repubblica: Statali finti malati, è truffa aggravata |publisher=Flcgil.it |date= |accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fraudulent claims of ill health are not confined to state employees, with some physicians often willing to receive bribes to certify non-existent conditions so that citizens may receive disability benefits. A case was revealed in 2010 where in one [[quartiere]] of Naples alone, 400 people were found to be claiming mental illness although healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=17 gennaio 2010 |url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/SoleOnLine4/Italia/2010/01/falsi-pazzi-ciechi-indagini-napoli.shtml?uuid=8beeba80-038e-11df-ba6a-816ac37e5d54&amp;DocRulesView=Libero |title=A Napoli la truffa dei "falsi pazzi": 400 malati di mente in un quartiere |publisher=Il Sole 24 ORE |date= |accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corruption ===
{{Main|Corruption in Italy}}

Political corruption remains a major problem in Italy, particularly in Southern Italy including Calabria, parts of Campania and Sicily where corruption perception is at a high level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom in the World|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/italy|publisher=Freedom House|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EXAMINING THE LINKS BETWEEN ORGANISEDCRIME AND CORRUPTION|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/doc_centre/crime/docs/study_on_links_between_organised_crime_and_corruption_en.pdf|publisher=Center for the Study of Democracy|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political parties are ranked as the most corrupt institution in Italy, closely followed by public officials and Parliament, according to [[Transparency International]]'s [[Global Corruption Barometer]] 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2013|url=http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== By location ==
Levels of crime are unevenly spread throughout the peninsula.

=== Southern Italy ===
Traditionally, the areas most affected by high levels of violent crime have been the Southern regions heavily influenced by powerful criminal organizations: [[Sicily]], [[Calabria]], [[Campania]] and [[Apulia]], where drug trade and gang feuds are common in marginalised areas in underdeveloped rural and urban settings alike.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==== Naples ====
[[Naples waste management issue|Waste management problems]] affected Naples; Italian media have attributed the city's waste disposal issues to the activity of the [[Camorra]] [[organized crime|organised crime]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6727215.stm|publisher=BBC.co.uk|title=Naples at the mercy of the mob|date=7 October 2007|first=Christian|last=Fraser}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s government held senior meetings in Naples to demonstrate their intention to solve these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=acV5uzL85glM&amp;refer=europe|publisher=Bloomberg.com|title=Berlusconi Takes Cabinet to Naples, Plans Tax Cuts, Crime Bill |date=7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In December 2009 "waste emergency" officially finished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/jcms/it/emergenza_rifiuti_campania.wp Emergenza rifiuti in Campania], Protezione Civile&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2012, allegations of blackmail, extortion and illicit contract tendering emerged in relation to the city's waste management issues.&lt;ref name=OneJun&gt;[http://mattinopadova.gelocal.it/cronaca/2012/06/20/news/cricca-veneta-sui-rifiuti-di-napoli-arrestati-i-fratelli-gavioli-1.5291660 "Cricca veneta sui rifiuti di Napoli: arrestati i fratelli Gavioli" (in Italian)].

''Il Mattino di Padova''. 21 June 2012. Retrieved 14 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Central and Northern Italy ===
Most regions in the center and north can be considered calmer and more organized, with lower levels of criminal activity. Regions such as [[Marche]], [[Tuscany]], [[Umbria]] in the centre and [[Piedmont]], [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Liguria]] and [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]] present relatively low criminal indicators compared to other western countries.
But even in the north and center levels of crime are unequally spread. Cities such as [[Turin]], [[Milan]], [[Bologna]], [[Genoa]] in the North frequently suffer a wide diversity of frequent offences ranging from extensive drug trade, homicides, etc.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

=== Rome ===
The capital [[Rome]] presents medium to high levels of crime. But many areas of the Roman periphery are extensively dilapidated and crime-ridden to a much larger extent than northern and central European counterparts. Shantytowns on the outskirts of the city housing more than 4000 people are focuses of elevated criminal activity.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Petty crimes such as pick pocketing, car burglary, and purse snatching are serious problems, especially in large cities. Most reported thefts occur at crowded tourist sites, on public buses or trains, or at the major railway stations.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8209">'''Crime in Serbia''' is combated by the [[Police of the Republic of Serbia|Serbian Police]] and other government agencies.

== Crime by type ==

=== Murder ===
{{Further information|List of countries by intentional homicide rate}}

In 2012, Serbia had a murder rate of 1.2 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; There were a total of 111 murders in Serbia in 2012.&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/index.html ''Global Study on Homicide''. [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organised crime ===
{{Main article|Serbian mafia}}
'''Serbian Organised Crime''' ({{lang-sr|Cpпска мафија}} / ''Srpska Mafija'', ''Serbian Mafia'') are various criminal organisations based in [[Serbia]] or composed of ethnic [[Serbs]]. Serbian criminals are active in the [[European Union]] (EU) countries. The organisations are primarily involved in [[smuggling]], [[arms trafficking]], [[drug trafficking]], [[protection racket]], [[illegal gambling]], jewelry and gems theft, [[bodyguarding]], and [[contract killing]]. The Mafia is composed of several major organised groups, which in turn have wider networks throughout primarily Europe.

The [[Yugoslav Wars]] prompted criminals a "way out" of economic disaster during the international imposed sanctions against Serbia. Serbian criminals have been recruited to state security forces, a notable example is [[Legija]], a commander in the [[Arkan's Tigers]] which after the war was re-labeled as the [[JSO (Special Operations Unit)|JSO]] (''Red Berets''), he planned the murder of Prime Minister [[Zoran Đinđić]].&lt;ref name=GRAZ&gt;[http://www.etc-graz.at/cms/fileadmin/user_upload/humsec/Journal/Stojarova_Organized_Crime_in_the_Western_Balkans.pdf ''Organized Crime in the Western Balkans'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corruption ===
{{Further information|Corruption in Serbia}}

Corruption levels are perceived to be high by surveyed residents of Serbia, and public trust in key institutions remains low.&lt;ref name="Global Integrity"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Integrity Report 2011- Serbia|url=http://www.globalintegrity.org/report/Serbia/2011|publisher=Global Integrity|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public procurement, public administration recruitment processes, mining and rail operations are sectors with a serious problem of conflict of interest.&lt;ref name="Global Integrity"/&gt; The European Commission has raised concern over Serbia's judiciary, police, health and education sectors that are particularly vulnerable to corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SERBIA  2013 PROGRESS REPORT|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/key_documents/2013/package/sr_rapport_2013.pdf|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transparency Serbia]] estimated in September 2016 that at least 374,000 cases of "petty corruption" in public services remain undiscovered every year.&lt;ref name="Transparency International's GCB"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.transparentnost.org.rs/index.php/en/110-english/naslovna/8711-unreported-corruption-is-the-biggest-problem-measures-of-the-state-so-far-without-success |title=Unreported corruption is the biggest problem, measures of the state so far without success, |author=Transparency Serbia's Press Issue on GCB 2015|website=Transparentnost.org.rs|accessdate=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Piracy ===
Piracy in Serbia is increasing in intensity in [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] and 2010s&lt;!-- U poslednjih desetak godina --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ilić |first=J. |date=2014-09-26 |title= Smederevo: Pirati haraju na Dunavu |url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/srbija.73.html:511844-Smederevo-Pirati-haraju-na-Dunavu |newspaper=Večernje novosti |location=Belgrade |accessdate=2014-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially threatened is the shipping on the part of [[Danube]] between [[Belgrade]] and [[Smederevo]].&lt;ref name=rpbtnp&gt;{{cite news |last=Vukasović |first=Vladimir |date=2008-12-04 |title=Речни "пирати" бољи трговци него пљачкаши |url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/65725/Drustvo/Recni-pirati-bolji-trgovci-nego-pljackasi |newspaper=Politika |location=Belgrade |accessdate=2015-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly, pirates will plunder [[bulk cargo]] such as oil, [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], metals, grains, sugar or fertilizers, but sometimes also remove cables and electric motors from the ships.&lt;ref name="rpbtnp" /&gt;

The confrontations of the pirates with the crews rarely escalate, with a single shipman murder recorded, in late-2000s&lt;!--      --&gt;.&lt;ref name=rpbtnp/&gt; This is, in part, because crews will often cooperate with the pirates, sell part of the cargo, then report the piracy in order to receive insurance money.&lt;ref name=snddidns&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vukasović |first1=Vladimir |last2=Luković |first2=Marko |date=2010-05-27 |title=Шверц нафте дуж Дунава и даље "национални спорт" |url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Beograd/SHverc-nafte-duz-Dunava-i-dalje-nacionalni-sport.html |newspaper=Politika |location=Belgrade |accessdate=2015-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ssib&gt;{{cite news |last=Ilić |first=J. |date=2012-03-16 |title=Smederevo: Šverc istočio barže |url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.291.html:371047-Smederevo-Sverc-istocio-barze |newspaper=Večernje novosti |location=Belgrade |accessdate=2015-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of cooperation of the pirates with the police have also been recorded.&lt;ref name=ssib/&gt;

The pirates will also often engage in smuggling fuel and other goods across Danube.&lt;ref name=snddidns/&gt;

=== False bomb threats ===
False [[bomb threat]]s are relatively common in Serbia. Since the police reacts to every bomb threat by searching the entire buildings for the possible bomb,&lt;ref name=lbuoim&gt;{{cite news |last=Vasiljević |first=B |date=2008-02-29 |title=Лажне "бомбашке" узбуне – опасне игре малолетника |url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Beograd/Lazne-bombashke-uzbune-opasne-igre-maloletnika.html |newspaper=Politika |location=Belgrade |accessdate=2014-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most common targets are schools&lt;ref name=lbuoim/&gt; where students will phone in a threat to delay their exams, and courts&lt;ref name=pldobpp&gt;{{cite news |author=Tanjug |date=2014-09-26 |title=Поново лажна дојава о бомби у Палати правде |url=http://www.politika.rs/vesti/najnovije-vesti/Ponovo-lazna-dojava-o-bombi-u-Palati-pravde.html |newspaper=Politika |location=Belgrade |accessdate=2014-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where people expecting to lose a trial will phone in to delay it. Due to false bomb threats, the building of the High Court in [[Belgrade]]&lt;!-- Palata pravde --&gt; had to be evacuated more than 70 times in 2008&lt;ref name=pldobpp/&gt;

Less common targets include those as diverse as Belgrade firefighters' headquarters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=T.M:S. |date=2014-12-11 |title=Lažna dojava o bombi u sedištu Vatrogasne brigade u Beogradu |url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Hronika/518558/Lazna-dojava-o-bombi-u-sedistu-Vatrogasne-brigade-u-Beogradu |newspaper=Blic |location=Belgrade |accessdate=2014-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a residential building&lt;ref name=zpbt&gt;{{cite news |last=Vasiljević |first=B. |date=2011-05-24 |title=Закон прекида бомбашку "телефонијаду" |url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Beograd/Zakon-prekida-bombasku-telefonijadu.html |newspaper=Politika |location=Belgrade |accessdate=2014-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Kraljevo]] public library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tanjug |date=2011-11-08 |title=Kraljevo: Lažna dojava o bombi u Narodnoj biblioteci |url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/srbija.73.html:352531-Kraljevo-Lazna-dojava-o-bombi-u-Narodnoj-biblioteci |newspaper=Večernje novosti |location=Belgrade |accessdate=2014-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequency of the false bomb threats was reduced in 2009, after a new law specified harsher, triplified, punishments.&lt;ref name=zpbt/&gt;

==Crime dynamics==
Serbian law enforcement authorities have prioritised fighting drug trafficking, terrorism and organised crime during the late 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emg.rs/en/news/serbia/156009.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|Domestic violence in Columbia|other related topics|Outline of domestic violence}}
'''Domestic violence in Colombia''', although prohibited by law, remains a serious problem. Since the 1990s, Colombia has started to tackle this problem. Article 42 of the Constitution of Colombia provides that “Family relations are based on the equality of rights and duties of the couple and on the mutual respect of all its members. Any form of violence in the family is considered destructive of its harmony and unity, and will be sanctioned according to law.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omct.org/files/2004/07/2409/eng_2003_04_colombia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Acts of domestic violence can be charged under a variety of laws, and victims can obtain protection orders. Despite this, the prevailing view continues to be that domestic violence should be treated as a "private" matter; and the laws are often unenforced.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omct.org/files/2004/07/2409/eng_2003_04_colombia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws==
In the 1990s, Colombia enacted ''Ley 294 de 1996'', in order to fight domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/domesticviolence/colombia.dv.96.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, ''Ley 1257 de 2008'', a comprehensive law against [[violence against women]] was enacted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sdmujer.gov.co/images/pdf/ley1257.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marital rape]] was criminalized in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omct.org/files/2004/07/2409/eng_2003_04_colombia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Colombia has many laws against domestic violence, under specific legislation, and also under the Penal Code, the public opinion continues to see domestic violence as something private,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omct.org/files/2004/07/2409/eng_2003_04_colombia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that must be solved without legal punishment: a study found that 64% of public officials in Colombia said that if it were in their hands to solve a case of intimate partner violence, the action they would take would be to encourage the parties to reconcile.&lt;ref&gt;Camilo Segura Álvarez for El Spectador. March 5, 2015 [http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/politica/colombia-sigue-legitimando-violencia-contra-mujer-articulo-547754 Colombia sigue legitimando la violencia contra la mujer]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extent ==
The Institute for Legal Medicine and Forensic Science reported approximately 33,000 cases of domestic violence against women during 2006.&lt;ref name=report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78885.htm Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Colombia]. [[United States]] [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (March 6, 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; It noted that only a small percentage of cases were brought to its attention.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The law stipulates that the government must provide victims of domestic violence with immediate protection from physical or psychological abuse.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The ICBF provided safe houses and counseling for victims, but its services were dwarfed by the magnitude of the problem.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; 

In addition to fulfilling traditional family counseling functions, ICBF family ombudsmen handled domestic violence cases.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The [[Ombudsman's Office of Colombia|Colombia Ombudsman's Office of Human Rights]] conducted regional training workshops to promote the application of domestic violence statutes.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The '''economy of Africa''' consists of the [[trade]], [[industry]], [[agriculture]], and [[human resources]] of the [[Africa|continent]]. {{As of|2012}}, approximately [[List of African countries by population|1.07 billion people]]&lt;ref name="2013 World Population Data Sheet"/&gt;  were living in [[Africa#Territories and regions|54 different countries]] in Africa.

In March 2013, Africa was identified as the world's poorest inhabited continent: Africa's entire combined GDP is barely a third of the United States' GDP; however, the World Bank expects that most African countries will reach "middle income" status (defined as at least [[United States dollar|US$]]1,000 per person a year) by 2025 if current growth rates continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2012/10/04/despite-global-slowdown-african-economies-growing-strongly-world-bank-urges-countries-spend-new-oil-gas-mineral-wealth-wisely|title=Despite Global Slowdown, African Economies Growing Strongly― New Oil, Gas, and Mineral Wealth an Opportunity for Inclusive Development|work=World Bank|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Africa was the world’s fastest-growing continent at 5.6% a year, and GDP is expected to rise by an average of over 6% a year between 2013 and 2023.&lt;ref name="worldbank.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Africa rising A hopeful continent|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21572377-african-lives-have-already-greatly-improved-over-past-decade-says-oliver-august|work=The Economist|publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited|accessdate=15 December 2013|author=Oliver August|date=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the African Development Bank reported Africa to be the world’s second-fastest growing economy, and estimates that average growth will rebound to 3.4% in 2017, while growth is expected to increase by 4.3% in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Publications/AEO_2017_Report_Full_English.pdf|title=African Economic Outlook 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=African Development Bank|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
{{further|Economic history of Africa|Scramble for Africa}}
[[File:Coudée-turin.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Ancient Egyptian units of measurement]] also served as units of currency.]]
Africa's economy was diverse, driven by extensive trade routes that developed between cities and kingdoms. Some trade routes were overland, some involved navigating rivers, still others developed around port cities. Large African empires became wealthy due to their trade networks, for example [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Nubia]], [[Mali]], [[Ashanti Empire|Ashanti]], and the [[Oyo Empire]].
[[File:Mogadishan currency.JPG|thumb|left|130px|The [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]]'s medieval [[Mogadishu currency|currency]].]]
Some parts of Africa had close trade relationships with Arab kingdoms, and by the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Africans had begun converting to Islam in large numbers. This development, along with the [[economic potential]] in finding a trade route to the [[Indian Ocean]], brought the Portuguese to sub-Saharan Africa as an imperial force. Colonial interests created new industries to feed European appetites for goods such as palm oil, rubber, cotton, precious metals, spices, cash crops other goods, and integrated especially the coastal areas with the Atlantic economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aehnetwork.org/european-trade-colonialism-and-human-capital-accumulation-in-senegal-gambia-and-western-mali-1770-1900/|title=European Trade, Colonialism, and Human Capital Accumulation in Senegal, Gambia and Western Mali, 1770–1900 – African Economic History Network|website=www.aehnetwork.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the independence of African countries during the 20th century, economic, political and social upheaval consumed much of the continent. An economic rebound among some countries has been evident in recent years, however.

The dawn of the African economic boom (which is in place since the 2000s) has been compared to the [[Chinese economic reform|Chinese economic boom]] that had emerged in [[Economy of Asia|Asia]] since late 1970's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21541015|title=Africa rising|date=2011-12-03|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-08-17|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Africa was home to seven of the world's fastest-growing economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8968cbee-7f45-11e2-89ed-00144feabdc0|title=Africa calling|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, [[Nigeria]] is the biggest economy in terms of nominal GDP, followed by [[South Africa]]; in terms of PPP, [[Egypt]] is second biggest after Nigeria.&lt;ref name="imf.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=38&amp;pr.y=9&amp;sy=2015&amp;ey=2019&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=694&amp;s=NGDPD,NGDPDPC,PPPGDP,PPPPC&amp;grp=0&amp;a=|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|author=|date=|work=IMF.org|access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Equatorial Guinea]] possessed Africa's highest GDP per capita albeit allegations of human rights violations. Oil-rich countries such as [[Algeria]], [[Libya]] and [[Gabon]], and mineral-rich [[Botswana]] emerged among the top economies since the 21st century, while [[Zimbabwe]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], potentially among the world's richest nations, have sunk into the list of the world's poorest nations due to pervasive political corruption, warfare and braindrain of workforce. [[Economy of Botswana|Botswana]] remains the site of Africa's longest and one of the world's longest periods of economic boom (1966–1999).

==Current conditions==
[[File:Factory of National Cement Share Company.jpg|thumb|right|The National Cement Share Company of [[Ethiopia]]'s new plant in [[Dire Dawa]]]] The [[United Nations]] predicts Africa’s economic growth will reach 3.5% in 2018 and 3.7% in 2019.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/publication/world-economic-situation-and-prospects-2018/ |title=World Economic Situation and Prospects 2018 |publisher = [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], Development Policy and Analysis Division |page = 106 |accessdate = 2018-03-02 |ISBN = 978-92-1-109177-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, growth in Africa had surpassed that of East Asia. Data suggest parts of the continent are now experiencing fast growth, thanks to their resources and [[Global Peace Index|increasing political stability]] and 'has steadily increased levels of peacefulness since 2007'. The [[World Bank]] reports the economy of Sub-Saharan African countries grew at rates that match or surpass global rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7093912.stm|title='Fast economic growth' in Africa|date=2007-11-14|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6748281.stm|title=African economy 'to expand 6.2%'|date=2007-06-13|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], the improvement in the region’s aggregate growth is largely attributable to a recovery in [[Egypt]], [[Nigeria]] and [[South Africa]], three of Africa’s largest economies.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The economies of the fastest growing African nations experienced growth significantly above the global average rates. The top nations in 2007 include [[Mauritania]] with growth at 19.8%, [[Angola]] at 17.6%, [[Sudan]] at 9.6%, [[Mozambique]] at 7.9% and [[Malawi]] at 7.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6522807.stm|title=African growth 'steady but frail'|date=2007-04-03|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fast growers include [[Rwanda]], [[Mozambique]], [[Chad]], [[Niger]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ethiopia]]. Nonetheless, growth has been dismal, negative or sluggish in many parts of Africa including [[Zimbabwe]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[Republic of the Congo]] and [[Burundi]]. Many international agencies are increasingly interested in investing in emerging African economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/locations/sub-saharan_africa/sectors/eg/index.html|title=Where We Work|website=www.usaid.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially as Africa continues to maintain high economic growth despite current [[Global financial crisis of 2008–2009|global economic recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.afrik.com/article13716.html|title=Africa's economic growth continues upward trend |publisher= Africa news, Maghreb news  |website=en.afrik.com|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The rate of return on investment in Africa is currently the highest in the developing world.&lt;ref name="mckinsey.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/MGI/Research/Productivity_Competitiveness_and_Growth/Lions_on_the_move |title=Lions on the move: The progress and potential of African economies &amp;#124; McKinsey Global Institute &amp;#124; Productivity, Competitiveness, &amp; Growth &amp;#124; McKinsey &amp; Company |publisher=Mckinsey.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debt relief is being addressed by some international institutions in the interests of supporting economic development in Africa. In 1996, the UN sponsored the [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] (HIPC) initiative, subsequently taken up by the [[IMF]], [[World Bank]] and the [[African Development Fund]] (AfDF) in the form of the [[Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative]] (MDRI). As of 2013, the initiative has given partial debt relief to 30 African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Debt Relief Under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/hipc.htm|publisher=IMF|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade growth===
Trade has driven much of the growth in Africa's economy in the early 21st century. China and India are increasingly important trade partners; 12.5% of Africa's exports are to China, and 4% are to India, which accounts for 5% of China's imports and 8% of India's. The Group of Five (Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates) are another increasingly important market for Africa's exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic Report on Africa 2012|url=http://www.uneca.org/sites/default/files/publications/era2012_eng_fin.pdf|publisher=United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA)|accessdate=2 March 2013|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future===
[[File:Uganda - ad on van in Kampala.jpg|thumb|A mobile phone advertisement on the side of a van, [[Kampala, Uganda]].]]
Africa's economy—with expanding trade, English language skills (official in many Sub-Saharan countries), improving literacy and education, availability of splendid resources and cheaper labour force—is expected to continue to perform better into the future. Trade between Africa and China stood at US$166 billion in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China-Africa Trade Booms|url=http://www.joc.com/economy-watch/world-economy-news/china-africa-trade-booms_20120718.html|work=The Journal of Commerce|publisher=The JOC Group, Inc|accessdate=4 July 2013|author=Mike King|date=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Africa will only experience a "demographic dividend" by 2035, when its young and growing labour force will have fewer children and retired people as dependents as a proportion of the population, making it more demographically comparable to the US and Europe.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lund, Susan  |author2=Arend Van Wamelen|title=10 things you didn't know about the African economy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-africas-economy-8113876.html|accessdate=26 February 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is becoming a more educated labour force, with nearly half expected to have some secondary-level education by 2020. A consumer class is also emerging in Africa and is expected to keep booming. Africa has around 90 million people with household incomes exceeding $5,000, meaning that they can direct more than half of their income towards discretionary spending rather than necessities. This number could reach a projected 128 million by 2020.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;

During the President of the United States Barack Obama's visit to Africa in July 2013, he announced a [[United States dollar|US$]]7 billion plan to further develop infrastructure and work more intensively with African heads of state. A new program named Trade Africa, designed to boost trade within the continent as well as between Africa and the U.S., was also unveiled by Obama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The three reasons why the US is so interested in Africa right now|url=http://qz.com/100315/the-three-reasons-why-the-us-is-so-interested-in-africa-right-now/|work=Quartz|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2013|author=Olga Khazan|date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of the economic underdevelopment over the years==
The seemingly intractable nature of [[Poverty in Africa|Africa's poverty]] has led to debate concerning its root causes. [[Endemic warfare]] and unrest, widespread corruption, and despotic regimes are both causes and effects of the continued economic problems. The [[decolonization of Africa]] was fraught with instability aggravated by cold war conflict. Since the mid-20th century, the [[Cold War]] and increased [[political corruption|corruption]] and [[despotism]] have also contributed to Africa's poor economy.

=== Infrastructure ===
[[File:Map of Trans-African Highways.PNG|thumb|350px|The [[Trans-African Highway network]]]]
According to the researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]], the lack of infrastructure in many [[developing countries]] represents one of the most significant limitations to [[economic growth]] and achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs).&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Christian K.M. Kingombe 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5666&amp;title=latin-america-medellin-colombia-microfinance-post-washington-consensus-microcredit-microenterprise-local-development Mapping the new infrastructure financing landscape] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918135821/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5666&amp;title=latin-america-medellin-colombia-microfinance-post-washington-consensus-microcredit-microenterprise-local-development |date=18 September 2012 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Infrastructure investments and maintenance can be very expensive, especially in such areas as landlocked, rural and sparsely populated countries in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

It has been argued that infrastructure investments contributed to more than half of Africa's improved growth performance between 1990 and 2005 and increased investment is necessary to maintain growth and tackle poverty.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; The returns to investment in infrastructure are very significant, with on average 30–40% returns for [[telecommunications]] (ICT) investments, over 40% for [[electricity]] generation, and 80% for [[roads]].&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

In Africa, it is argued that to meet the MDGs by 2015, infrastructure investments would need to reach about 15% of GDP (around $93 billion a year).&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Currently, the source of financing varies significantly across sectors.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Some sectors are dominated by state spending, others by overseas [[development aid]] (ODA) and yet others by private investors.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; In sub-Saharan Africa, the state spends around $9.4 billion out of a total of $24.9 billion.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

In irrigation, SSA states represent almost all spending; in transport and energy a majority of investment is state spending; in [[Information and communication technologies]] and water supply and sanitation, the private sector represents the majority of capital expenditure.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Overall, aid, the private sector and non-OECD financiers between them exceed state spending.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; The private sector spending alone equals state capital expenditure, though the majority is focused on ICT infrastructure investments.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; External financing increased from $7 billion (2002) to $27 billion (2009). [[China]], in particular, has emerged as an important investor.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

===Colonialism===
{{Main|Colonisation of Africa}}
[[File:Map of railways in Africa 1899.jpg|thumb|350px|Railway map of Africa, including tracks proposed and under construction, ''[[The Statesman's Yearbook]]'', 1899.]]
The economic impact of the colonization of Africa has been debated. In this matter, the opinions are biased between
researchers, some of them consider that Europeans had a positive impact on Africa; others affirm that Africa's development was slowed down by colonial rule.&lt;ref name="google.co.ke"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.google.co.ke/#hl=sw&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=effects+of+colonization+in+africa+pdf&amp;oq=effects+of+colonization+in+africa+pdf&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=hp.3...634.1719.8.2219.4.4.0.0.0.0.440.1700.4-4.4.0...0.0.4nW9F3Sgask&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=a16f15c2ded0125a&amp;biw=1301&amp;bih=680|title=Google|website=www.google.co.ke|language=sw-KE|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal aim of colonial rule in Africa by European colonial powers was to exploit natural wealth in the African continent at a low cost. Some writers, such as [[Walter Rodney]] in his book ''[[How Europe Underdeveloped Africa]]'', argue that these colonial policies are directly responsible for many of Africa's modern problems. Critics of colonialism charge colonial rule with injuring African pride, self-worth and belief in themselves. Other post-colonial scholars, most notably [[Frantz Fanon]] continuing along this line, have argued that the true effects of colonialism are psychological and that domination by a foreign power creates a lasting sense of inferiority and subjugation that creates a barrier to growth and innovation. Such arguments posit that a new generation of Africans free of colonial thought and mindset is emerging and that this is driving economic transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Mead, [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/interactive/2012/may/28/african-economic-outlook-2012 "African Economic Outlook 2012"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 28 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians L. H. Gann and Peter Duignan have argued that Africa probably benefited from colonialism on balance. Although it had its faults, colonialism was probably "one of the most efficacious engines for cultural diffusion in world history".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis H. Gann and Peter Duignan, ''The Burden of Empire: A Reappraisal of Western Colonialism South of the Sahara''&lt;/ref&gt; These views, however, are controversial and are rejected by some who, on balance, see colonialism as bad. The economic historian [[David Kenneth Fieldhouse]] has taken a kind of middle position, arguing that the effects of colonialism were actually limited and their main weakness wasn't in deliberate [[underdevelopment]] but in what it failed to do.&lt;ref&gt;D. K. Fieldhouse, ''The West and the Third World''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niall Ferguson]] agrees with his last point, arguing that colonialism's main weaknesses were ''sins of omission''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Niall Ferguson]], Empire: How Britain Made the Modern World and Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of the economies of African states finds that independent states such as Liberia and Ethiopia did not have better economic performance than their post-colonial counterparts. In particular the economic performance of former British colonies was better than both independent states and former French colonies.&lt;ref&gt;http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/41656700/alexandra_hrituleac_thesis_1_dec.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Africa's relative poverty predates colonialism. [[Jared Diamond]] argues in [[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]  that Africa has always been poor due to a number of ecological factors affecting historical development. These factors include low population density, lack of domesticated livestock and plants and the North-South orientation of Africa's geography.&lt;ref&gt;1997: ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel|Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]].'' W.W. Norton &amp; Co. ({{ISBN|978-0-099-30278-0}}). Also published with the title ''Guns, germs and steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years''.&lt;/ref&gt; However Diamond's theories have been criticized by some including [[James Morris Blaut]] as a form of [[environmental determinism]].&lt;ref name="Blaut2000EightEurocentricHistorians"&gt;{{cite book | last = James M. Blaut| title = Eight Eurocentric Historians |edition= 10 August 2000|page= 228 | publisher = The Guilford Press| isbn= 1-57230-591-6|year=2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktn7LmLgc6oC|accessdate=2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[John K. Thornton]] argues that sub-Saharan Africa was relatively wealthy and technologically advanced until at least the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Africa and Africans in the Formation of the Atlantic World, 1400–1680 (New York and London: Cambridge University Press, 1992, second expanded edition, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars who believe that Africa was generally poorer than the rest of the world throughout its history make exceptions for certain parts of Africa. Acemoglue and Robinson, for example, argue that most of Africa has always been relatively poor, but "Aksum, Ghana, Songhay, Mali, [and] Great Zimbabwe... were probably as developed as their contemporaries anywhere in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Why is Africa Poor? (Economic History of Developing Regions Vol. 25: 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; A number of people including Rodney and [[Joseph E. Inikori]] have argued that the poverty of Africa at the onset of the colonial period was principally due to the demographic loss associated with the [[Slavery in Africa|slave trade]] as well as other related societal shifts.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney, Walter. ''How Europe Underdeveloped Africa''. London: [[Bogle-L'Ouverture Publications]], 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as [[J. D. Fage]] and David Eltis have rejected this view.&lt;ref&gt;David Eltis, ''Economic Growth and the Ending of the Transatlantic Slave Trade''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language diversity===
[[File:TamaleGhana2.jpg|thumb|250px|A randomly selected pair of people in Ghana has only an 8.1% chance of sharing a mother tongue.]]

African countries suffer from communication difficulties caused by language diversity. [[Linguistic Diversity Index|Greenberg's diversity index]] is the chance that two randomly selected people would have different [[mother tongue]]s. Out of the most diverse 25 countries according to this index, 18 (72%) are African.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=country#6|title=Summary by country|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes 12 countries for which Greenberg's diversity index exceeds 0.9, meaning that a pair of randomly selected people will have less than 10% chance of having the same mother tongue. However, the primary language of government, political debate, academic discourse, and administration is often the language of the former colonial powers; [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

=== Trade based theories ===
[[Dependency theory]] asserts that the wealth and prosperity of the superpowers and their allies in [[Europe]], [[North America]] and [[East Asia]] is dependent upon the poverty of the rest of the world, including Africa. Economists who subscribe to this theory believe that poorer regions must break their trading ties with the developed world in order to prosper.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Frank, A. G. (1979), ''Dependent Accumulation and Underdevelopment'', New York: Monthly Review Press.; Köhler, G., and A. Tausch (2001), ''Global Keynesianism: unequal exchange and global exploitation'', Nova Publishers; Amin, S. (1976), ''Unequal Development: An Essay on the Social Formations of Peripheral Capitalism'', New York: Monthly Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less radical theories suggest that economic [[protectionism]] in developed countries hampers Africa's growth. When developing countries have harvested agricultural produce at low cost, they generally do not export as much as would be expected. Abundant [[Agricultural subsidy|farm subsidies]] and high import tariffs in the developed world, most notably those set by Japan, the European Union's [[Common Agricultural Policy]], and the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], are thought to be the cause. Although these subsidies and tariffs have been gradually reduced, they remain high.

Local conditions also affect exports;  state over-regulation in several African nations can prevent their own exports from becoming competitive. Research in Public Choice economics such as that of Jane Shaw suggest that protectionism operates in tandem with heavy State intervention combining to depress economic development. Farmers subject to import and export restrictions cater to localized markets, exposing them to higher market volatility and fewer opportunities. When subject to uncertain market conditions, farmers press for governmental intervention to suppress competition in their markets, resulting in competition being driven out of the market. As competition is driven out of the market, farmers innovate less and grow less food further undermining economic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/Shaw%20Comment%20April%202004.pdf |format=PDF| title=Overlooking the Obvious in Africa | last=Shaw | first=Jane | publisher=Econ Journal Watch |date = April 2004| accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/Pasour%20Intellectual%20Tyranny%20April%202004.pdf |format=PDF| title=Intellectual Tyranny of the Status Quo | last=Pasour | first=E.C. | publisher=Econ Journal Watch |date = April 2004| accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance===
{{Political corruption sidebar}}
Although Africa and Asia had similar levels of income in the 1960s, Asia has since outpaced Africa, with the exception of a few extremely poor and war-torn countries like [[Afghanistan]] and [[Yemen]]. One school of economists argues that Asia's superior [[economic development]] lies in local investment. Corruption in Africa consists primarily of extracting [[economic rent]] and moving the resulting [[financial capital]] overseas instead of investing at home; the stereotype of African dictators with Swiss bank accounts is often accurate. [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] researchers estimate that from 1970 to 1996, [[capital flight]] from 30 [[sub-Saharan]] countries totalled $187bn, exceeding those nations' external debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newstatesman.com/Economy/200503140015 | title=When the money goes west | last=Wrong | first=Michela |work=New Statesman | date=2005-03-14 | accessdate=2006-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disparity in development is consistent with the model theorized by economist [[Mancur Olson]]. Because governments were politically unstable and new governments often confiscated their predecessors' assets, officials would stash their wealth abroad, out of reach of any future [[Confiscation|expropriation]].

[[Socialism|Socialist]] governments influenced by [[Marxism]], and the [[land reform]] they have enacted, have also contributed to economic stagnation in Africa. For example, the regime of [[Robert Mugabe]] in [[Zimbabwe]], particularly the land seizures from white farmers, led to the collapse of the country's agricultural economy, which had formerly been one of Africa's strongest;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://newzimbabwe.com/columns-40850-The+costs+of+the+Robert+Mugabe+era/columns.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201005250/http://www.newzimbabwe.com/columns-40850-The+costs+of+the+Robert+Mugabe+era/columns.aspx |archive-date=1 February 2018 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mugabe had been previously supported by the [[USSR]] during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]]. In [[Tanzania]], socialist President [[Julius Nyerere]] resigned in 1985 after his policies of [[agricultural collectivisation]] in 1971 led to economic collapse, with famine only being averted by generous aid from the [[IMF]] and other foreign entities.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Wayland Porter. Challenging nature: local knowledge, agroscience, and food security in Tanga.&lt;/ref&gt; Tanzania was left as one of the world's poorest and most aid-dependent nations, and has taken decades to recover.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Annabel (2005). Tanzania &amp; Zanzibar. New Holland Publishers. p. 19. {{ISBN|1-86011-216-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the abolition of the socialist [[one-party state]] in 1992 and the transition to democracy, Tanzania has experienced rapid economic growth, with growth of 6.5% in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2017/02/weodata/download.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign aid===
Food shipments in case of dire local shortage are generally uncontroversial; but as [[Amartya Sen]] has shown, most famines involve a local lack of income rather than of food. In such situations, food aid—as opposed to financial aid—has the effect of destroying local agriculture and serves mainly to benefit Western agribusiness which are vastly overproducing food as a result of [[agricultural subsidies]].

Historically, food aid is more highly correlated with excess supply in Western countries than with the needs of developing countries. Foreign aid has been an integral part of African economic development since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

The aid model has been criticized for supplanting trade initiatives.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt; Growing evidence shows that foreign aid has made the continent poorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123758895999200083 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Dambisa | last=Moyo | title=Why Foreign Aid Is Hurting Africa | date=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the biggest critics of the aid development model is economist Dambiso Moyo (a Zambian economist based in the US), who introduced the [[Dead Aid]] model, which highlights how foreign aid has been a deterrent for local development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/|title=The Daily Beast|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Africa faces the problem of attracting foreign aid in areas where there is potential for high income from demand. It is in need of more economic policies and active participation in the world economy. As globalization has heightened the competition for foreign aid among developing countries, Africa has been trying to improve its struggle to receive foreign aid by taking more responsibility at the regional and international level. In addition, Africa has created the ‘Africa Action Plan’ in order to obtain new relationships with development partners to share responsibilities regarding discovering ways to receive aid from foreign investors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uneca.org/atpc/Work%20in%20progress/21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade blocks and multilateral organizations==

The [[African Union]] is the largest international economic grouping on the continent.  The confederation's goals include the creation of a [[free trade area]], a [[customs union]], a [[single market]], a [[central bank]], and a common currency (see [[African Monetary Union]]), thereby establishing [[economic and monetary union]].  The current plan is to establish an [[African Economic Community]] with a single currency by 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/3870303.stm |title=
Profile: African Union |date=2006-07-01 |accessdate=2006-07-10 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[African Investment Bank]] is meant to stimulate development.  The AU plans also include a transitional [[African Monetary Fund]] leading to an [[African Central Bank]].  Some parties support development of an even more unified [[United States of Africa]].

International monetary and banking unions include:
* [[Central Bank of West African States]]
* [[Bank of Central African States]]
* [[Common Monetary Area]]
Major economic unions are shown in the chart below.

After an initial rebound from the 2009 world economic crisis, Africa’s economy was undermined in the year 2011 by the Arab uprisings. The continent’s growth fell back from 5% in 2010 to 3.4% in 2011. With the recovery of North African economies and sustained improvement in other regions, growth across the continent is expected to accelerate to 4.5% in 2012 and 4.8% in 2013. Short-term problems for the world economy remain as Europe confronts its debt crisis. Commodity prices—crucial for Africa—have declined from their peak due to weaker demand and increased supply, and some could fall further. But prices are expected to remain at levels favourable for African exporter.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/outlook/ |title=Economic Outlook |publisher=African Economic Outlook |date=28 May 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regions ===
Economic activity has rebounded across Africa. However, the pace of recovery was uneven among groups of countries and subregions. Oil-exporting countries generally expanded more strongly than oil-importing countries. West Africa and East Africa were the two best-performing subregions in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/16/0,3746,en_2649_33731_48794320_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=African Economic Outlook 2011 |publisher=Oecd.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intra-African trade has been slowed by protectionist policies among countries and regions. Despite this, trade between countries belonging to the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA), a particularly strong economic region, grew six-fold over the past decade up to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic Report on Africa 2012|url=http://www.uneca.org/sites/default/files/publications/era2012_eng_fin.pdf|publisher=United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA)|accessdate=2 March 2013|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ghana and Kenya, for example, have developed markets within the region for construction materials, machinery, and finished products, quite different from the mining and agriculture products that make up the bulk of their international exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic Report on Africa 2012|url=http://www.uneca.org/sites/default/files/publications/era2012_eng_fin.pdf|publisher=United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA)|accessdate=2 March 2013|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The African Ministers of Trade agreed in 2010 to create a Pan-Africa Free Trade Zone. This would reduce countries' tariffs on imports and increase intra-African trade, and it is hoped, the diversification of the economy overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic Report on Africa 2012|url=http://www.uneca.org/sites/default/files/publications/era2012_eng_fin.pdf|publisher=United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA)|accessdate=2 March 2013|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic sectors and industries==
Because Africa’s export portfolio remains predominantly based on raw material, its export earnings are contingent on commodity price fluctuations. This exacerbates the continent’s susceptibility to external shocks and bolsters the need for export diversification. Trade in services, mainly travel and tourism, continued to rise in year 2012, underscoring the continent’s strong potential in this sphere.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Monthly-Review-51-03-Saul-Leys&gt;John J. Saul and Colin Leys, [http://monthlyreview.org/1999/07/01/sub-saharan-africa-in-global-capitalism Sub-Saharan Africa in Global Capitalism], ''[[Monthly Review]]'', 1999, Volume 51, Issue 03 (July–August)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Monthly-Review-Magdoff-65-06&gt;Fred Magdoff, [http://monthlyreview.org/2013/11/01/twenty-first-century-land-grabs Twenty-First-Century Land Grabs: Accumulation by Agricultural Dispossession], ''[[Monthly Review]]'',  2013, Volume 65, Issue 06 (November)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===

The situation whereby African nations export crops to the West while millions on the continent starve has been blamed on developed countries including Japan, the [[European Union]] and the United States. These countries protect their own agricultural sectors with high [[import tariff]]s and offer subsidies to their farmers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caplan|first=Gerald|title=The Betrayal of Africa|year=2008|publisher=Groundwood Books|isbn=9780888998255|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; which many contend leads the [[overproduction]] of such commodities as grain, cotton and milk. The result of this is that the global price of such products is continually reduced until Africans are unable to compete, except for cash crops that do not grow easily in a northern climate.&lt;ref name=Monthly-Review-51-03-Saul-Leys/&gt;&lt;ref name=Monthly-Review-Magdoff-65-06/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba547|title=Farm Subsidies: Devastating the World's Poor and the Environment|website=www.ncpa.org|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years countries such as Brazil, which has experienced progress in agricultural production, have agreed to share technology with Africa to increase agricultural production in the continent to make it a more viable trade partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42069|title=Inter Press Service {{!}} News and Views from the Global South|website=ipsnews.net|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased investment in African agricultural technology in general has the potential to reduce poverty in Africa.&lt;ref name=Monthly-Review-51-03-Saul-Leys/&gt;&lt;ref name=Monthly-Review-Magdoff-65-06/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huliq.com/11/73879/targeted-agricultural-investments-will-slash-poverty-africa|title=Targeted agricultural investments will slash poverty in Africa|last=Hareyan|first=Armine|date=2008-12-01|work=HULIQ|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demand market for African cocoa has experienced a price boom in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://africanagriculture.blogspot.com/2009/01/african-cocoa-enjoying-price-boom.html|title=Redirecting|website=africanagriculture.blogspot.com|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nigerian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/154296-private-sector-invests-n1-7-trillion-nigerias-agricultural-sector-jonathan.html | title=Private sector invests N1.7 trillion in Nigeria’s agricultural sector – Jonathan | publisher=Premium Times Nigeria | work=Premium Times | date=30 January 2014 | accessdate=14 March 2014 | author=Usman, Talatu}}&lt;/ref&gt; South African&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/specialty-businesses/minority-owned-businesses/4072455-1.html|title=South Africa: Commodities lead boom|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ugandan governments have targeted policies to take advantage of the increased demand for certain agricultural products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/grohow/yaras-grohow-sees-2008-profit-stable-idUSL2219761720080222|title=Yara's GroHow sees 2008 profit stable|date=22 February 2008|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plan to stimulate agricultural sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/news/Govt_targets_agricultural_boom.shtml|title=Govt targets agricultural boom – Daily Monitor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The African Union has plans to heavily invest in African agriculture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scidev.net/en/agriculture-and-environment/agri-biotech-in-africa/opinions/african-union-support-crucial-for-agricultural-pro.html|title=African Union support crucial for agricultural progress|last=SciDev.Net|work=SciDev.Net|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the situation is closely monitored by the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=26624&amp;Cr=africa&amp;Cr1=agriculture|title=Though making ‘very good progress,’ Africa still faces challenges, says UN official|last=Section|first=United Nations News Service|date=2008-05-09|website=UN News Service Section|language=en|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy===

[[File:Greater Cape Town 12.02.2007 16-41-31.2007 16-41-33.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Athlone Power Station]] in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]]]
Africa has significant resources for generating energy in several forms (hydroelectric, reserves of petroleum and gas, coal production, uranium production, renewable energy such as solar and geothermal). The lack of development and infrastructure means that little of this potential is actually in use today.&lt;ref name=Monthly-Review-51-03-Saul-Leys/&gt;&lt;ref name=Monthly-Review-Magdoff-65-06/&gt; The largest consumers of electric power in Africa are South Africa, Libya, Namibia, Egypt, Tunisia, and Zimbabwe, which each consume between 1000 and 5000 KWh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per person, in contrast with African states such as Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Tanzania, where electricity consumption per person is negligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=2013 Guide economique du continent Bourses Africaines|journal=AFRICA 24 Magazine|year=2013|issue=8|pages=12–13|editor1-first=Etnium|editor1-last=Sarl|publisher= |issn=2114-2610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petroleum and petroleum products are the main export of 14 African countries. Petroleum and petroleum products accounted for a 46.6% share of Africa's total exports in 2010; the second largest export of Africa as a whole is natural gas, in its gaseous state and as liquified natural gas, accounting for a 6.3% share of Africa's exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Table 7 – Exports, 2010|url=http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/data-statistics/table-7-exports-2010/|publisher=African Economic Outlook|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrastructure===
[[File:Lagos Island.jpg|thumb|[[Lagos, Nigeria]], Africa's largest city]]
Lack of infrastructure creates barriers for African businesses.&lt;ref name=Monthly-Review-51-03-Saul-Leys/&gt;&lt;ref name=Monthly-Review-Magdoff-65-06/&gt; Although it has many ports, a lack of supporting transportation infrastructure adds 30–40% to costs, in contrast to Asian ports.&lt;ref name="SarlEtnium"&gt;{{cite journal|title=2013 Guide economique du continent Bourses Africaines|journal=Africa 24 |year=2013|issue=8|pages=20–21|editor1-last=Sarl|publisher=|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many large infrastructure projects are underway across Africa. By far, most of these projects are in the production and transportation of electric power. Many other projects include paved highways, railways, airports, and other construction.&lt;ref name="SarlEtnium" /&gt;

Telecommunications infrastructure is also a growth area in Africa. Although Internet penetration lags other continents, it has still reached 9%. As of 2011, it was estimated that 500,000,000 mobile phones of all types were in use in Africa, including 15,000,000 "[[smart phone]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=2013 Guide economique du continent Bourses Africaines|journal=Africa 24 |year=2013|issue=8|page=24|editor1-last=Sarl|publisher=|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mineral industry of Africa is one of the largest mineral industries in the world. Africa is the second biggest continent, with 30 million km² of land, which implies large quantities of resources.&lt;ref name=Monthly-Review-51-03-Saul-Leys/&gt;&lt;ref name=Monthly-Review-Magdoff-65-06/&gt; For many African countries, mineral exploration and production constitute significant parts of their economies and remain keys to future economic growth. Africa is richly endowed with mineral reserves and ranks first or second in quantity of world reserves of bauxite, cobalt, industrial diamond, phosphate rock, platinum-group metals (PGM), vermiculite, and zirconium. Gold mining is Africa's main mining resource.

African mineral reserves rank first or second for bauxite, cobalt, diamonds, phosphate rocks, platinum-group metals (PGM), vermiculite, and zirconium. Many other minerals are also present in quantity. The 2005 share of world production from African soil is the following: bauxite 9%; aluminium 5%; chromite 44%; cobalt 57%; copper 5%; gold 21%; iron ore 4%; steel 2%; lead (Pb) 3%; manganese 39%; zinc 2%; cement 4%; natural diamond 46%; graphite 2%; phosphate rock 31%; coal 5%; mineral fuels (including coal) &amp; petroleum 13%; uranium 16%.

===Manufacturing===
Both the [[African Union]] and the [[United Nations]] have outlined plans in modern years on how Africa can help itself industrialize and develop significant manufacturing sectors to levels proportional to the African economy in the 1960s with 21st-century technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol18no3/183industries.htm|title=Africa strives to rebuild its domestic industries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This focus on growth and diversification of manufacturing and industrial production, as well as [[Agricultural diversification|diversification]] of agricultural production, has fueled hopes that the 21st century will prove to be a century of economic and technological growth for Africa. This hope, coupled with the rise of new leaders in Africa in the future, inspired the term "the [[African Century]]", referring to the 21st century potentially being the century when Africa's vast untapped labor, capital, and resource potentials might become a world player.

The increased investment in Africa by China has attracted the attention of the European Union and has provoked talks of competitive investment by the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/IL13Ad01.html|title=Asia Times Online : China News – China outwits the EU in Africa|last=Online|first=Asia Time|website=www.atimes.com|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[African diaspora]] abroad, especially in the EU and the United States, have increased efforts to use their businesses to invest in Africa and encourage African investment abroad in the European economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37978|title=Inter Press Service {{!}} News and Views from the Global South|website=ipsnews.net|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remittances from the African diaspora and rising interest in investment from the West will be especially helpful for Africa's least developed and most devastated economies, such as Burundi, Togo and Comoros.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5327/is_338/ai_n29402630|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713021316/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5327/is_338/ai_n29402630|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-13|title=FindArticles.com {{!}} CBSi|website=findarticles.com|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, experts lament the high fees involved in sending remittances to Africa due to a duopoly of Western Union and MoneyGram that is controlling Africa’s remittance market, making Africa is the most expensive cash transfer market in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1008951/western-union-moneygram-ria-and-others-remittance-fees-to-africa-are-still-higher-than-global-average/|title=Sending money home to Africa is cheaper than it was, but still higher than anywhere else|last=Kazeem|first=Yomi|work=Quartz|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some experts, the high processing fees involved in sending money to Africa are hampering African countries’ development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/8901.pdf|title=Lost in Intermediation|last=|first=|date=|website=Overseas Development Institute|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two African [[currency union]]s: the West African Banque Centrale des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO) and the Central African Banque des États de l'Afrique Centrale (BEAC). Both use the [[CFA franc]] as their legal tender. The idea of a single currency union across Africa has been floated, and plans exist to have it established by 2020, though many issues, such as bringing continental inflation rates below 5 percent, remain hurdles in its finalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/08/africa/single-currency-west-africa/index.html|title=Could West Africa launch a single currency?|last=Liedong|first=Tahiru Azaaviele|website=CNN|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade blocs and multilateral organizations==
{{further|Economy of the African Union}}
The [[African Union]] is the largest international economic grouping on the continent.  The confederation's goals include the creation of a [[free trade area]], a [[customs union]], a [[single market]], a [[central bank]], and a common currency (see [[African Monetary Union]]), thereby establishing [[economic and monetary union]].  The current plan is to establish an [[African Economic Community]] with a single currency by 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/3870303.stm |title=Profile: African Union |date=1 July 2006 |accessdate=2006-07-10 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[African Investment Bank]] is meant to stimulate development.  The AU plans also include a transitional [[African Monetary Fund]] leading to an [[African Central Bank]].  Some parties support development of an even more unified [[United States of Africa]].

International monetary and banking unions include:
* [[Central Bank of West African States]]
* [[Bank of Central African States]]
* [[Common Monetary Area]]
Major economic unions are shown in the chart below.

{{African Economic Community}}

===Regional economic organizations===

During the 1960s, Ghanaian politician [[Kwame Nkrumah]] promoted economic and political union of African countries, with the goal of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=2013 Guide economique du continentBourses Africaines|journal=Africa 24|year=2013|issue=8|page=60|editor1-last=Sarl|publisher=|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, objectives, and organizations, have multiplied. Recent decades have brought efforts at various degrees of regional economic integration. Trade between African states accounts for only 11% of Africa's total commerce as of 2012, around five times less than in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=2013 Guide economique du continentBourses Africaines|journal=Africa 24 |year=2013|issue=8|page=62|editor1-last=Sarl|publisher=|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of this intra-Africa trade originates from South Africa and most of the trade exports coming out of South Africa goes to abutting countries in Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Luce and Agarwal|title=Rise of the African Opportunity|url=http://www.slideshare.net/KimberleeLuce/rise-of-the-african-opportunity|publisher=Boston Analytics|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently eight regional organizations that assist with economic development in Africa:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=2013 Guide economique du continentBourses Africaines|journal=Africa 24|year=2013|issue=8|pages=64–65|editor1-last=Sarl|publisher=|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a large number of '''expatriates in Kuwait''', with most residing in Kuwait City. [[Expatriate]]s are primarily attracted by the employment opportunities in Kuwait. Expatriates account for 70% of Kuwait's total population. 

==Indians==
{{main|Indians in Kuwait}}
The Indian community in Kuwait includes Indian expats (mostly hailing from the southern states of [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]), as well as Kuwaiti citizens of Indian origin. According to the Indian ministry of external affairs, there are around 781,288 Indians as on 1 January 2013,&lt;ref name=mae&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Community|url=http://www.mea.gov.in/Portal/ForeignRelation/Kuwait_December_2013.pdf|work=Ministry of External Affairs|accessdate=21 December 2016|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; constituting the largest expatriate community in Kuwait.&lt;ref name="ABS Ancestry"&gt;[http://www.kuwaitstay.com/groups/indians-kuwait: Kuwaitstay.com - Indians in Kuwait]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 17 Indian schools in Kuwait affiliated to the [[Central Board of Secondary Education]] (CBSE). There were 164 Indian community Associations earlier registered with the Indian Embassy of Kuwait. Following introduction of a re-registration requirement, 106 of these Indian community Associations have once again registered with the Embassy and the number of registered Associations is growing at a steady pace.

==Egyptians==
Egyptians are the second largest expat community in Kuwait, numbering more than 600,000 workers.

==Pakistanis==
{{main|Pakistanis in Kuwait}}
The population of Pakistanis in Kuwait is around 130,000. The former Pakistani ''[[chargé d'affaires]]'' in Kuwait has given a higher estimate of 150,000 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=NTk4MTcyNTA3|first=Hussein|last=Al-Qarari|date=2009-03-29|title=Pakistanis celebrate National Day in Kuwait|periodical=Kuwait Times|accessdate=2012-04-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617012758/http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=NTk4MTcyNTA3|archivedate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many Pakistani schools in Kuwait.

==Syrians==
{{main|Syrians in Kuwait}}
There are around 150,000 Syrian expats in Kuwait. Syrians were among the first educated work force in Kuwait, the first Syrian expats immigrated to Kuwait in the 1960s.

==Iranians==
{{See also|'Ajam of Kuwait}}
In 2012, there were 45,000 Iranian expats according to the population census.&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/kuwait/kuwait-postpones-iran-spy-cell-trial-1.963532|title=Kuwait postpones Iran spy cell trial|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iranians are heavily concentrated in the Bneid al-Gar suburb of [[Kuwait City]]. Most Iranians are employed in the [[private sector]].&lt;ref name="exp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.q8nri.com/home/2012/05/21/expat-population-in-kuwait-drops-by-19-percent-in-one-year/|title=Expat population in Kuwait drops by 19 percent in one year|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, there were 42,795 Iranians in Kuwait; 699 were employed in the [[public sector]], 24,684 in the private sector and 16,577 were on dependent visas.&lt;ref name="exp"/&gt;  

There are Iranian schools in Kuwait, all privately funded and located in the suburbs of Kuwait City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6ad9330.html|title= Kuwait and Iran |publisher= Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada|date=1 August 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example the Iranian School of Kuwait.

==Palestinians==
There are 70,000 Palestinian expats in Kuwait.

==Filipinos==
{{main|Filipinos in Kuwait}}
There are roughly 180,000 Filipinos in Kuwait. Most are migrant workers,&lt;ref name=amnesty&gt;[http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view_article.php?article_id=68858 Kuwait grants amnesty to illegal aliens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209230026/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view_article.php?article_id=68858 |date=2012-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and approximately 60% of Filipinos in Kuwait are employed as [[domestic worker]]s.

In 2011, Kuwait was the sixth-largest destination of [[Overseas Filipino Workers]], with 65,000 hired or rehired in the nation in 2011, and accordingly Kuwait has been an important source of [[remittance]]s back to the Philippines, with over $105 million [[United States dollar|USD]] being remitted in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/publications/AG%202012-04%20-%20OFW.pdf|title=Overseas Filipino Workers At A Glance|date=May 2012|publisher=[[Senate of the Philippines]]|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KCIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcic-asia.com/UserFiles/file/KCIC%20%20Weekly%20Analysis%20-%20May%2030%202010.pdf|title=Philippine Remittances Rising Despite Declines from Kuwait and Hong Kong|last=Zhang|first=Thomas|year=2010|publisher=Kuwait China Investment Company|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine Filipino banks have [[correspondent account]]s with banks in Kuwait to allow for remittance transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smc.org.ph/MAPID/MAPID%20CD/Italy%20pdf%20file/012.III.3%20ANNEX%201%20Philippine%20Banks%20with%20Remittance%20Network%20Abroad.pdf|title=Philippine Banks With Remittance Networks Abroad|publisher=Scalabrini Migration Center|pages=5|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a Filipino Worker's Resource Center (FWRC) located in [[Jabriya]], and it provides refuge for Filipino workers in Kuwait who have "[experienced] various forms of maltreatment from their employers such as fatigue, non-payment of salaries,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arabtimesonline.com/NewsDetails/tabid/96/smid/414/ArticleID/184406/reftab/96/t/Seventy-distressed-HSWs-repatriated-to-Philippines/Default.aspx|title=Seventy Distressed HSWs Repatriated To Philippines|date=12 June 2012|publisher=Arab Times|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "lack of food [and] physical, verbal and sexual abuse".&lt;ref name="Arab2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arabtimesonline.com/NewsDetails/tabid/96/smid/414/ArticleID/170034/reftab/96/t/131-distressed-Pinoys-fly-home-to-Philippines/Default.aspx|title=131 Distressed Pinoys Fly Home To Philippines|date=7 June 2012|publisher=Arab Times|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through assistance from the FWRC, the Philippine Embassy in Kuwait, the [[Philippine Overseas Employment Administration]], and Overseas Workers' Welfare Administration, hundreds of Filipinos in Kuwait have been repatriated to the Philippines due to these issues.&lt;ref name="Arab2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/274878/pinoyabroad/news/dfa-31-ofws-repatriated-from-kuwait-400-more-to-come-home-soon|title=DFA: 31 OFWs repatriated from Kuwait, 400 more to come home soon|date=20 September 2012|publisher=GMA News|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fire insurance marks''' are metal plaques marked with the emblem of the insurance company which were affixed to the front of insured buildings as a guide to the insurance company's [[Firefighter|fire brigade]]. These identification marks were used in the eighteenth and nineteenth century in the days before municipal [[Fire station|fire services]] were formed.&lt;ref&gt;G. V. Blackstone, ''A history of the British Fire Service'', 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;
The UK marks are called 'Fire insurance plaques'. 

The first to use the mark was the [[Sun Fire Office]] which was established in 1710.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moleseyhistory.co.uk/books/surrey/fireplaques/index.html Rowland G. M. Baker, ''Fire Insurance Wall Plaques'' Walton &amp; Weybridge Local History Society, Paper No 7, 1970]&lt;/ref&gt; Some period specimens remain on historical buildings in the older areas of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s and [[United States|America]]'s cities and larger towns. Cast metal plaques were made of iron, [[lead]], or sometimes brass. Embossed sheet metal signs were also made, as well as flat [[enamel sign]]s – the latter mostly in [[Continental Europe]] in the later 19th century. 

Period specimens may have high value among [[Antique#Antiquing|antiques]] collectors, leading to illicit creation of fakes. Also, [[nostalgia|nostalgic]] [[Replica#Replicas_of_artifacts_and_art|reproductions]] have been made since the early 20th century for decorative purposes. 

==British fire marks==
For most of the 18th century, each insurance company maintained its own fire brigade, which extinguished fires in those buildings insured by the company and, in return for a fee to be paid later, in buildings insured by other companies. By 1825, fire marks served more as advertisements than as useful identifying marks; some insurance companies no longer issued fire marks, and those that did sometimes left them up after a policy had expired.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Successive combinations of fire brigades led to virtually the entire city of London being put under the protection of the [[London Fire Engine Establishment]], which fought not only the fires of policy holders but those of nonsubscribers, the reason being that fires in uninsured buildings could rapidly spread to insured buildings.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{citation|url=http://mises.org/journals/jls/3_3/3_3_6.pdf|title=The Development of Municipal Fire Departments in the United States|author=Annelise Graebner Anderson|publisher=Journal of Libertarian Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American fire marks==
Fire Insurance has over 200 years of history in America. The early fire marks of [[Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin's]] time can still be seen on some Philadelphia buildings as well as in other older American cities. Subscribers paid fire fighting companies in advance for fire protection and in exchange would receive a fire mark to attach to their building. The payments for the fire marks supported the fire fighting companies. [[Volunteer fire department]]s were also common in the United States, and some fire insurers contributed money to these departments and awarded bonuses to the first fire engine arriving at the scene of a fire.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

== Australian fire marks ==

[[File:Golden Fleece, Fire Insurance Sydney.jpg|thumb|left|Copper mould of the golden fleece fire mark, Fire Insurance Company Sydney]] Fire insurance companies began operating in the Australian colonies in the early part of the 19th century. They were both Australian and foreign, principally British, owned. The Union Assurance Company of Sydney and The Australasian Fire and Life Assurance Company are both recorded as having offices in George Street, Sydney in 1836. The Sydney Fire Insurance Company was established in 1844 at 468 George Street Sydney. It issued for display at the company’s fire insured properties a mark in copper with the company name with the image of a golden fleece, being at that time in the New South Wales colony a symbol of safety and security. A rare and original plaque from the 1840s is on display at the historic [[Darling House, The Rocks]], the current property having been constructed in this colonial precinct 1842. In Melbourne, the Collingwood Fire Insurance Company (with a paid up capital of 200 000 pounds) was operating in Gertude Street, [[Collingwood, Victoria]] in 1854.

Fire brigades in metropolitan areas were organised much along the same lines as in the United Kingdom and the United States and were funded by the insurance companies. Likewise the companies issued fire marks to be affixed to buildings to indicate where there were risks for which they had underwritten policies. Such fire marks were commonly made of [[tinplate]], [[cast iron]] and [[lead]].

At least one company, the [[Norwich Union]], issued "fire marks" printed on calico for use in rural areas. They were to be fixed on hay ricks, corn stacks and shearing sheds on the theory that they would indicate to arsonists that the owner was insured and would not be out of pocket should the property be destroyed by fire.&lt;ref name='Chitty2'&gt;{{cite book | last = Chitty | first = Alfred | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Fire Insurance Offices and "Fire Marks" in Australasia| publisher = Southland Press | year = 1925 | location = Melbourne, Victoria | pages = 3–43 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One feature of the insurance company funding of fire brigades survives in some Australian states and territories in the 21st century in that the fire brigade services are principally funded by a "fire service levy" or tax applied to all property insurance policies issued within a state.&lt;ref name='week times 1'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/article/2009/03/11/60875_opinion-news.html |title=Make everyone pay fire levy |accessdate=2010-01-08 |last=Hunt |first=Peter |date=March 11, 2009 |work=The Weekly Times |publisher= News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fryday''' is one of the largest networking clubs for professionals organising series of social and business networking events across [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]]. It is currently active in [[Armenia]],  [[Austria]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Bulgaria]],  [[Costa Rica]], [[the Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Hungary]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Moldova]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Slovakia]],  [[Switzerland]],  [[Sweden]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/business/the-swedish-networker.html#.T-nTA5EginA|title=The Swedish networker|last=Panova|first=Kateryna |date=21 October 2011|publisher=[[Kyiv Post]]|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Fryday community is composed of cosmopolitan professional crowd, business owners, government officials and media representatives. Using both, offline and online platforms, the Fryday network works to bring people together so that they can make new contacts  as well as sustain those already existing. 

== History == 
The idea of Fryday comes from the Stockholm style after work mingles. The first event was on April 21, 2010 with 17 guests in Kyiv. Since 2012 Fryday events are frequented by more than 500 people.

In February 2012 the new Fryday concept is tested and introduced in Kyiv - Fryday W event, where well known and accomplished speakers share some meaningful ideas with the audience. Ambassadors, top managers and senior politicians are typical speakers at Ws. Fryday W became an excellent way for businesses to meet up with their target audience, commercial chamber reps of foreign countries, diplomats and entrepreneurs informally.

What makes Fryday’s network especially appealing nowadays is its extensive online presence with members who are decision makers in successful businesses, covering nearly all business sectors.

== Concepts ==
There are four concepts of Fryday events: Fryday Afterwork and Fryday W. 
Afterwork&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy6nxFMO104|title=Fryday the Movie|last=Kyiv|first=Fryday |date=19 October 2012|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a relaxed business-socialising event gathering around 500 guests on Friday evenings in top venues of city downtowns. These events are typically happening every second Friday of each month. The entrance to regular Afterwork is free of charge. 

The second concept is Fryday W,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT7UYJJdUQY|title=Fryday Kyiv W with H.E. the Ambassador of Sweden Stefan Gullgren|last=Kyiv|first=Fryday |date=6 February 2013|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is held on week days, and has a more professional and thematical approach to networking. Themes of W events are determined by spheres of invited speakers. There are usually fewer guests at W events, around 150, who typically relate to an industry of a speaker. The entrance to Fryday W for guests is EUR 10. 

The third and fourth concepts, Fryday Good Morning and Fryday Training, were both developed during 2015 and has by November 2015 not yet proven either successes nor failures. 

During spring 2013 the people behind Fryday have also launched an affiliated website [http://www.Socialite.nu Socialite.nu] that aims to function as a broader umbrella for business-networking.
Fryday also serves a platform for online networking through the spectrum of social media, connecting  Fryday members from different cities. The network represents one of the biggest online communities in Eastern Europe, having a great presence on [[LinkedIn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Fryday-3346258?gid=3346258&amp;mostPopular=&amp;trk=tyah|title=Fryday| publisher=[[LinkedIn]]|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Facebook]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://www.facebook.com/fryday.kyiv|title=Fryday Kyiv| publisher=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as has its own [[YouTube]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://www.youtube.com/user/frydaykyiv|title=Fryday Kyiv|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; channel, which is being constantly updated with videos from Fryday events.

== Fryday Branches ==
The biggest Fryday community is in [[Kyiv]], where the roots of the Fryday movement are. The first event in Kyiv was in April 21, 2010. In September 2011 Fryday started to hold the events in [[Almaty]] ([[Kazakhstan]]), following by [[Tbilisi]] ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) in January and [[Astana]] ([[Kazakhstan]]) in March 2012. As of August 2013 Fryday expanded across 29 cities in 21 countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?vps=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;oe=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=214988870553164287679.0004e23d6ec9a1e4350e6|title=Fryday Cities Map|date=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 2015 Fryday had continued its expansion westwards and had launched also in Austria, Switzerland and Sweden

{{Pashtuns}}
'''Ibrahimkhel''' or '''Ibrahimkhil''' (Pashto:ابراهيمخيل) are a major [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribe. The Ibrahimkhel live in places such as [[Kabul]], [[Kandahar]], [[Paktia]], [[Paktika]], Laghman, [[Qunduz]], Mazar-e-sharif, [[Herat]], [[Peshawar]], [[Quetta]] [[Upper Dir]] and some other parts of [[Pashtunistan]] also in a small village of swat district named [[BIHA]] near matta. All the historical references show that Ibrahimkhel are the descendants of the [[Ghilji]]s. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
The Ibrahimkhel are known to be the most prevalent sub-tribe of the Babars. They primarily reside in [[Pirpiai]], Chaudhwan, [[Multan]], Ibrahimkhel Kot, [[Zhob]], [[Qila Saifullah]], [[Dera Ghazi Khan]] in [[Pakistan]]. In [[Afghanistan]], they have communities in Kandahar and [[Sheberghan]]. In [[India]], they settle in the district of [[Bulandshahr]] {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

A very large number of the Ibrahimkhel tribes live in Kabul province's [[Paghman District]].

The '''Livonians''', or '''Livs''' ([[Livonian language|Livonian]]: ''līvlizt''), are a [[Finnic people|Finnic]] [[ethnic group]] [[indigenous minority|indigenous]] to northern [[Latvia]] and southwestern [[Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=One Europe, Many Nations |last=Minahan |first=James |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-313-30984-7 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwvoM-ZFoAgC&amp;pg=PA424&amp;dq=Livonians }}&lt;/ref&gt; Livonians historically spoke [[Livonian language|Livonian]], a [[Uralic language]] closely related to [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. The last person to have learned and spoken Livonian as a [[First language|mother tongue]], [[Grizelda Kristiņa]], died in 2013, making Livonian [[Language extinction|extinct]].&lt;ref&gt;Tuisk, Tuuli: "Quantity in Livonian", Congressus XI. Internationalis Fenno-Ugristarum, [[Piliscsaba]], Aug. 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, there were approximately 30 people who had learned it as a second language.

Historical, social and economic factors, together with an ethnically dispersed population, have resulted in the decline of the Livonian population, with only a small group surviving in the 21st century. In 2011, there were 250 people who claimed Livonian ethnicity in Latvia.&lt;ref name="census11"/&gt;

==History==
{{History of Latvia}}

===Prehistory===
The exact date of the Uralic migration to the region has been disputed, {{speculation inline|text=but by using [[Occam's razor]] and common sense,}} the easiest explanation could infer{{by whom|date=September 2018}} that Livonian was one of many indigenous Finnic dialects spoken in the Baltic region, before the gradual adoption of Indo-European, and the only dialect of this kind to survive Balto-Slavic assimilation.

===The Middle Ages===
[[Image:Baltic Tribes c 1200.svg|thumb|250px|left|[[Baltic tribes]] in 1200 – the Livonians inhabited the area north of the Balts, north of the [[Daugava River]] and around [[Cape Kolka]] in [[Courland]].]]

Historically, the Livonians lived in two separate areas of Latvia, one group in Livonia and another on the northern coast of Courland. The latter were referred as Curonians, together with the Balts living there.&lt;ref name="Baltian historia"&gt;Vilho Niitemaa ja Kalervo Hovi, Baltian historia, Helsinki 1991, {{ISBN|978-9513091125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Livonians referred to themselves as ''rāndalist'' ("coast dwellers") and supported themselves mainly by fishing, but also by [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]]. Since they controlled an important trade route, the [[Daugava River]] (Livonian: ''Väina''), their culture was highly developed through trade with the [[Gotland]]ers, [[Russians]] and [[Finns]], and, from the end of the first millennium AD onwards, with the [[Germans]], [[Swedish people|Swedes]] and [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]].

However, with the traders came missionaries from Western Europe who wanted to convert the [[paganism|pagan]] Livonians to [[Christianity]]. It has been suggested{{by whom?|date=February 2014}} that the first person to convert some Livonians to Christianity was the Danish archbishop [[Absalon]], who supposedly built a church in the Livonian village today known as [[Kolka, Latvia|Kolka]]. In the 12th century, Germans invaded Livonia and established a base in Ykskyle, known today as [[Ikšķile]]. Archbishop [[Hartvig II]] converted some Livonians in the surrounding area, including the local chieftain [[Caupo of Turaida]], who later allied himself with the Germans.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

After [[Saint Meinhard|Meinhard]] died in 1196, his place was taken by Berthold. Berthold tried to convert the Livonians by force, launching two raids on Livonia. The first took place in 1196, but he was forced to retreat to Germany after being ambushed near [[Salaspils]]. He tried again in 1198, but this time he was killed by the Livonian soldier [[Ymaut]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Berthold was followed by [[Albert von Buxhövden]], who forced the Livonian leaders at the mouth of the Daugava River to give him land to build a Christian settlement.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Building started in 1201. From this settlement, the city of [[Riga]] grew.

When this did not immediately induce the Livonians, [[Estonians]], and Baltic peoples in the hinterland to convert, a knightly order was formed, the [[Knights of the Sword]], primarily consisting of Germans, to bring salvation to the pagans by force. In a campaign that was part of the wars known as the [[Livonian Crusade]], these knights defeated, subdued and converted the Livonians. In 1208, [[Pope Innocent III]] declared that all Livonians had been converted to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Baltian historia" /&gt; Afterwards they were obliged to join the Knights of the Sword as infantry during the wars against the Estonians and the Latvian tribes, which continued until 1217.

Before the German Conquests Livonian inhabited territory was divided in lands of Daugava Livonians, Satezele, Turaida, Idumeja, [[Metsepole]]. 

During the [[Livonian Crusade]], once prosperous [[Livonia]] was devastated, and whole regions were almost completely depopulated. This vacuum was filled by [[Latvia]]n tribes – [[Curonians]], [[Semigallians]], [[Latgallians]] and [[Selonians]] – who started to move into the area around 1220, and continued to do so for at least thirty years. They settled mostly in the Daugava Valley, so that the Livonians of Livonia in the east were cut off from those living on the [[peninsula of Curonia]] in the west.

Because of the ongoing resistance of the Latvian tribes, the Knights of the Sword eventually had to look for support to the much more powerful [[Teutonic Order]], which up until then had been active primarily in [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]]. Having been reorganized as a subdivision of the [[Teutonic Order]] and renamed the [[Livonian Order]] in 1237, the former Knights of the Sword finally overpowered the [[Curonians]] in 1267, and subsequently the [[Semigallians]] in 1290. From then on most of Latvia remained under German control until the 16th century, with the city of Riga and several other cities existing as independent German-ruled bishoprics, and the Livonian Order ruling the rest of the land.

===Under foreign powers (1558–1795)===
In the middle of the 16th century, the Livonian Order and the independent bishoprics were in turmoil because of the growing influence of [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Seeing a chance in the resulting military weakness of the Order, [[Czar]] [[Ivan the Terrible]] of [[Russia]] invaded Livonia in 1558, seeking access to the Baltic Sea. However, [[Sweden]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] entered the war as allies of the Livonian Order, resulting in almost a quarter of a century of war. The outcome of this [[Livonian War]] (1558–1582) was a Russian defeat, but also the dissolution of the Livonian Order. Livonia and south-eastern Latvia were claimed by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, while Curonia became an independent duchy (Courland), with [[Gotthard Kettler]], the Livonian Order's last Grandmaster, as its first duke.

After only ten years of peace, a new series of wars between the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and [[Sweden]], which had claimed Estonia after the Livonian War, ravaged Livonia from 1592. Eventually, the Swedes were victorious. In 1629, they could finally call Livonia and the city of Riga their own. Under the 17th Century Swedish Kings [[Gustav II Adolf]] and [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]], general elementary education was introduced, the [[Bible]] was translated in [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]], and a university was founded in [[Tartu]] in southern Estonia.

Although Sweden kept the Poles and the [[Denmark|Danes]] at a distance, this could not be said of the Russians. In the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721), Czar [[Peter the Great]] utterly destroyed Sweden's pretensions to being a regional superpower. In the 1721 [[Treaty of Nystad]], Estonia and Livonia, which had again been completely devastated after more than twenty years of war, were claimed by Russia. Curonia continued to be ruled by its dukes for another three-quarters of a century, but in 1795, that region also became a Russian possession as part of the [[Third Partition of Poland]].

===Assimilation and isolation (1795–1914)===
[[File:Livonian loja.jpg|230px|thumb|left|''Lõja'', Livonian fishing boat]]
Partly because of the recurring devastation of war and the resultant mingling of refugees, the Livonians of [[Livonia]] were eventually completely [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilated]] by the Latvians. The last remnant of this once vibrant nation was made up of several families living along the river [[Salaca]] (Livonian: ''Salatsi''), but in the second half of the 19th century, the [[Livonian language]] and culture completely disappeared from the region known to this day as Livonia; the last known speaker of the eastern Livonian dialect died in 1864, though according to some reports, there were still some people in the early 20th century in the Polish area,{{Clarify|date=May 2011}} who knew they were descended from Livonians.&lt;ref name="Baltian historia" /&gt; In the Latvian dialect spoken in Livonia, a large number of Livonian loanwords have survived, and other traces of Livonian can be found in many geographical names in the region.

In Curonia, the [[Livonian language]] and culture also came under heavy pressure, but here it retained a last foothold on the outermost tip of the Curonian Peninsula. Several factors made sure that in this area, known as ''Līvõd rānda'', the [[Livonian Coast]], Latvian culture was too weak to assimilate the Livonians. For one thing, the society of the Livonians living in this area was exclusively sea-oriented and based on fishing, while that of the Latvians in the interior was exclusively land-oriented and mostly agricultural. This meant there was not a lot of interaction between the two groups. Also, the Livonian Coast was separated from the interior of Curonia by dense forests and impassable marshlands, which made regular interaction even less likely. The people of the Livonian Coast had much closer ties to the inhabitants of the Estonian island of [[Saaremaa]], across the [[Gulf of Riga]] to the north. In their isolated fishing villages, these Livonians kept to themselves for centuries. It was not until the 20th century that the outside world intruded on their quiet existence.&lt;ref name="Baltian historia" /&gt;

At the beginning of 20th century many local [[Livs]] converted to the [[Russian Orthodox]] faith. A new [[Russian Orthodox]] church was built in [[Kolka, Latvia|Kolka]] along with a grammar school nearby and navy school in [[Mazirbe]]. Many graduates in later years became sea captains first in the [[Russian Empire]], and later in independent [[Latvia]].

===World War I===
In 1914, Russia entered the [[World War I|First World War]] by attacking the Germans and the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrians]] from the east, but soon it was pushed back in a series of devastating German victories, which eventually left almost the entire Baltic region in German hands. The Livonian Coast was occupied by the Germans in 1915. At their approach, many Livonians fled their homes, often never to return. Their main destinations were Estonia and inner parts of Latvia.{{cn|date=March 2014}} The rest of the people were driven from their homes by the Germans and had to wait until 1919 before they were allowed to return.

The Russian defeat and the subsequent abdication of Czar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] opened the door for [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the communists to make a grab for power in Russia, leading to the establishment of the Soviet government in Russia in 1917. The [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] the following year ended the war between Germany and [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] and left the Baltic region firmly in German hands. However, after the German capitulation in 1919, the Baltic peoples rose up and established the independent republics of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]].

===The Livonian revival of the interwar years===
The Livonian Coast became part of Latvia. The Livonian language and culture experienced a revival between the two World Wars (beginning with the term of the Latvian president [[Jānis Čakste]] through the term of the last interwar president [[Kārlis Ulmanis]]). The clearest expression of this revival was the establishment on April 2, 1923 of the [[Livonian Society]], which considered itself the representative of the Livonian people. Also, a Livonian language choir was founded and Livonian song festivals were held along the entire Livonian Coast. Furthermore, a Livonian flag was adopted, with the colours green (for the forests), white (for the beaches) and blue (for the sea), and a division similar to the Latvian flag (three horizontal bars with the middle one-half as wide as the outer ones). Although the Latvian government prohibited the formation of an ethnic Livonian parish within the [[Lutheran Church]] of Latvia in 1923, it approved the introduction of the Livonian language as an optional subject in elementary schools in the villages of the Livonian Coast that same year. The thirties saw the publication of the first Livonian language reader, poetry collections of several Livonian writers, and a monthly magazine in the Livonian language, called "''Līvli''" ("The Livonian"). Also, contact was made with related peoples such as the Estonians and the [[Finnish people|Finns]]&amp;nbsp;— spurred by the Finnish promotion of closer ties with the kindred [[Finnic peoples]]&amp;nbsp;— and in 1939, the Livonian Community Centre in [[Mazirbe]] (Livonian: Irē) was founded with subsidies from the Estonian and Finnish governments.

This cultural revival of the [[Interwar period|Interbellum]] years served to give the Livonian people for the first time a clear consciousness of their ethnic identity. Before, they had always referred to themselves as ''rāndalist'' ("coast dwellers") or ''kalāmīed'' ("fishermen"). From the 1920s and 1930s on, though, they began to call themselves ''līvõd'', ''līvnikad'', or ''līvlist'' ("Livonians").

===The Second World War===
In 1940, Latvia, like Estonia and Lithuania, was occupied by the [[Soviet Union]]. This occupation and the subsequent German invasion of 1941 ended all progress the Livonians had made in the preceding twenty years. All cultural expressions were prohibited and just like twenty years before, the inhabitants of the Livonian Coast were driven from their homes. Most of them spent the war years in Riga or western Latvia, but some fled across the [[Baltic Sea]] to [[Gotland]]. The Curonian Peninsula was one of the areas where the Germans held out until the general capitulation of May 5, 1945, which meant there was not a house left standing when the Livonians returned home after the war.

===Repression by the Soviet Union===
In the Soviet era, the Livonians were hard-hit by repressive measures from [[Moscow]]. For one thing, they were not allowed to sail far enough from shore to continue their fishery. For another, like the Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians, large numbers of them were deported to [[Siberia]] between 1945 and 1952, with a clear peak in 1949, when agriculture was collectivized in the Baltic states. Also, in 1955 a Soviet military base was constructed in the middle of the Livonian Coast. To accomplish this, some Livonians were forcibly relocated to villages farther from the coast. Subsequently, the western villages of the Livonian Coast had to be almost completely evacuated when the Soviet Union made its Baltic coastline (its western border) a "closed border area" where no one was allowed to live.

Livonian culture was repressed during the Soviet period. For example, the Livonian Society was banned and the Livonian Community Centre expropriated and given to others. Within the [[Latvian SSR]], the Livonians were not recognized as a separate ethnic group.

===Modern situation===
[[File:Livonian flag folkhouse.JPG|230px|thumb|right|Livonian folkhouse in [[Mazirbe]]]]
It was not until early 1970 that Livonian singers were allowed to found a choir named "Līvlist" ("The Livonians") in the western Latvian city of [[Ventspils]]. The 1980s, Soviet Premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]] opened the [[Iron Curtain]], bringing change. In 1986, the Livonian Cultural Society was founded. It was later renamed the [[Livonian Union]] (Livonian: ''Līvõd Īt'').

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Latvia became once again an independent country. In this new nation, Livonians were finally recognised as an indigenous ethnic minority, whose language and culture must be protected and advanced. All rights and possessions which had been taken away from them during the Soviet era were now returned to them. For example, the old Livonian Community Centre in [[Mazirbe]] (Irē) was given back and transformed into a historical museum, called the House of the Livonian People. Also, the Livonian language was reintroduced in the elementary schools in Riga, [[Staicele]], [[Ventspils]], [[Dundaga]] and [[Kolka, Latvia|Kolka]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livones.lv/libiesi/valoda/?raksts=168 Livones.lv - The Liv Language Today] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609033331/http://www.livones.lv/libiesi/valoda/?raksts=168 |date=2008-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first research body dedicated to Livonian studies, the Livonian Institute at the [[University of Latvia]] was established in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livones.net/en/norises/2018/?the-livonian-institute-is-established|title=Livones.net - The Livonian Institute is established|last=|first=|date=2018-08-21|work=Livones.net|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, on February 4, 1992, the Latvian government created a cultural historic protected territory called ''Līvõd rānda'' - the [[Livonian Coast]] - which included all twelve of the Livonian villages: [[Lūžņa]] (Livonian: Lūž), [[Miķeļtornis]] (Pizā), [[Lielirbe]] (Īra), [[Jaunciems]] (Ūžkilā), [[Sīkrags]] (Sīkrõg), [[Mazirbe]] (Irē), [[Košrags]] (Kuoštrõg), [[Pitrags]] (Pitrõg), [[Saunags]] (Sǟnag), [[Vaide]] (Vaid), Kolka (Kūolka), and [[Melnsils]] (Mustānum). The Latvian government discourages settlement of ethnic Latvians and other non-Livonians in this area and prohibits alterations to historic village sites. Also, it is prohibited for anyone to start a hotel, restaurant, or other public establishment which might adversely influence the Livonian culture or draw outsiders into the area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719160909/http://www.livones.lv/libiesi/libiesilatvija/?raksts=230 The State Institution Līvõd Rānda]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, many Latvians claim to have some Livonian ancestry. However, there are only 176 people in Latvia who identify themselves as Livonian. According to data from 1995, the Livonian language was spoken by no more than 30 people, of whom only nine were native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suri.ee/r/liivi/air.html Suri.ee - The Livonians' Estonian]&lt;/ref&gt; An article published by the Foundation for Endangered Languages in 2007 stated that there were only 182 registered Livonians and a mere six native speakers. "The last Livonian", who had learned the Livonian language as a part of an unbroken chain of Livonian generations, was [[Viktor Berthold]] (b. 1921). He was buried on 28 February 2009 in the Livonian village of Kolka in Courland.&lt;ref&gt;{{et icon}} [http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/460898 ''Eesti Päevaleht''] “Suri viimane vanema põlve emakeelne liivlane″ ('The last native speaker of Livonian from the older generation has died'), March 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Livonian [[Dāvis Stalts]] was [[Latvian parliamentary election, 2011|elected]] into the Latvian parliament, the [[Saeima]] in [[Latvian parliamentary election, 2011|2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saeima.lv/en/news/saeima-news/18900-composition-of-the-11th-saeima-is-announced|title=Composition of the 11th Saeima is announced|last=|first=|date=2011-10-06|website=saeima.lv|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, after being [[Latvian parliamentary election, 2018|re-elected]] to the Saeima, [[Janīna Kursīte-Pakule]] delivered her oath in Livonian before being asked to retake it in Latvian, which she did in the [[Latvian language#Livonian dialect|Livonian dialect]] of Latvian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/livones.net/posts/509903309483544|title=Livones.net - Facebook|last=|first=|date=2018-11-06|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lsm.lv/raksts/zinas/latvija/apstiprina-13-saeimas-pilnvaras-deputati-zver-gan-latgaliski-gan-libiski.a298662/|title=Apstiprina 13.

'''Material balances''' are a method of [[economic planning]] where material supplies are accounted for in natural units (as opposed to using monetary accounting) and used to balance the supply of available inputs with targeted outputs. Material balancing involves taking a survey of the available inputs and raw materials in an economy and then using a balance sheet to balance the inputs with output targets specified by industry to achieve a balance between supply and demand. This balance is used to formulate a plan for resource allocation and investment in a national economy.&lt;ref&gt;''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}. "Material Balance Planning", (P.127)&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of material balances is contrasted with the method of [[Input-output model|input-output planning]] developed by [[Wassily Leontief]].

== Role in Soviet-type planning ==
{{Soviet-type economics |}}
{{Further|Soviet-type economic planning}}
Material balance planning was the principal tool of planning employed by Soviet-type planned economies and was [[Gosplan]]'s major function in the [[Soviet Union]]. This system emerged in a haphazard manner during the collectivisation drive under Joseph Stalin's leadership. It prioritized rapid growth and industrialization over efficiency. Although material balances became an established part of Soviet planning, it never completely replaced the role of financial calculation in the economy.&lt;ref name="Planning with Material Balances in Soviet-Type Economies, 1959"&gt;''Planning with Material Balances in Soviet-Type Economies'', by Montias, J.M. 1959. The American Economic Review. Vol. 49, No. 5 (Dec., 1959), pp. 963-985.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[economy of the Soviet Union]], Gosplan's major function was the formulation of material balances and national plans for the economy. In 1973, supplies for 70% of all industrial production representing 1,943 of the economy's most important items had their balances worked out by Gosplan. [[Gossnab|State Committee for Supplies Procurement]] and the various economic ministries were responsible for the determination of the suppliers and recipients of supplies in the Soviet economy.&lt;ref&gt;''How the Soviet Union is Governed'', 1979, by Jerry F. Hough. Harvard University Press. 978-0674410305. (P.390)&lt;/ref&gt;

Material balance planning encompassed non-labor inputs (the distribution of consumer goods and allocation of labor was left to market mechanisms). In a material balance sheet, the major sources of supply and demand are drawn up in a table that achieves a rough balance between the two through an iterative process. Successive iterations corrected imbalances with previous iterations - for example, deficits signaled the need for extra output in the successive iteration of the balance. The Soviet economy suffered endemic supply problems stemming from the crudity of the material balance technique, where balances were highly aggregated and thus imprecise.&lt;ref name="Jeffries 1993"&gt;{{cite book |last= Jeffries |first= Ian|title= Socialist Economies and the Transition to the Market: A Guide |publisher= Routledge |year= 1993|isbn= 978-0415075800|pages = 13 |quote=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the early 1960s, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] considered moving away from material balance planning in favor of developing an interlinked computerized system of resource allocation based on the principles of [[Cybernetics]]. This development was seen as the basis for moving toward optimal planning that could form the basis of a more highly developed form of [[socialist economy]] based on informational decentralization and innovation. This was seen as a logical progression given that the material balances system was geared toward rapid industrialization, which the Soviet Union had already achieved in the preceding decades. But by the early 1970s the idea of transcending the status quo was abandoned by the Soviet leadership.&lt;ref name="InterNyet: why the Soviet Union did not build a nationwide computer network"&gt;''InterNyet: why the Soviet Union did not build a nationwide computer network'', by Gerovitch, Slava. December 2008. History and Technology. Vol. 24, No. 4 (Dec 2008), pp. 335-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miruts Yifter''' ([[Amharic]]: ምሩፅ ይፍጠር, affectionately known as "Yifter the Shifter",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaaf.org/athletes/biographies/letter=0/athcode=11008/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/yi/miruts-yifter-1.html&lt;/ref&gt; 15 May 1944 – 22 December 2016) was an [[Ethiopia]]n [[Athletics (sport)|athlete]] and winner of two [[gold medal]]s at the [[1980 Summer Olympics]]. His date of birth is often given as 15 May 1944, though there is some uncertainty about this. His name is also sometimes spelled as '''Muruse Yefter'''.

==Early life==
Born in [[Adigrat]], in the [[Tigray Region]] of Ethiopia, Yifter spent early parts of his youth working in different factories and as a carriage driver. His talent as a long-distance runner was noticed when he joined the [[Ethiopian Air Force]].

==Running career==
Yifter was called to the Ethiopian national team for the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]], but he made his Olympic debut four years later in [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich Olympics]] where he won a [[bronze medal]] in [[10,000 metres]]. However, he arrived too late for the [[5000 metres]] final.

In the [[Athletics at the 1973 All-Africa Games|1973 All-Africa Games]] he won one gold medal (10,000 m) and one [[silver medal|silver]] (5000 m). At the [[1979 African Championships in Athletics|1st African Championships]] in 1979 he won two gold medals (5000 and 10,000 metres).

Yifter was unable to participate in the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] because his nation boycotted the event. Four years later in [[Moscow]], Yifter made up for his disappointments by winning gold in both the 10,000 and 5000 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaaf.org/news/iaaf-news/turning-the-clock-back-to-moscow-1980|title=IAAF: Turning the clock back to Moscow 1980{{!}} News {{!}} iaaf.org|last=|first=|date=May 16, 2013|website=iaaf.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final of the 10,000 m he sprinted into the lead 300 m from the finish and won by ten metres. Five days later, in the 5000 m final, Yifter was boxed in during the last lap. But with 300 m to go, his Ethiopian teammate, [[Mohamed Kedir]], stepped aside and Yifter again sprinted to victory. Due to his abrupt change in speed when executing his kick to the finish, Yifter acquired the nickname "Yifter the Shifter."

At [[Coamo]], Puerto Rico on 6 February 1977, Yifter ran a World Best for the half-marathon of 1:02:57.

At the Moscow Olympics, part of the mystery surrounding Yifter was the question of his age, which was reported to be between 33 and 42. Yifter refused to give a definitive answer, telling reporters:

"Men may steal my chickens; men may steal my sheep. But no man can steal my age."

The most common versions of his date of birth are 1 January 1938 or 15 May 1944 (see IAAF Profile).

Yifter continued to compete into the early 1980s, running on Ethiopia's gold medal winning team at the 1982 and 1983 [[IAAF World Cross Country Championships]].

==Death==
Miruts Yifter  died at  age of 72 on 22 December 2016 in Toronto, Ontario where he had lived since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.athleticsweekly.com/featured/miruts-yifter-the-shifter-dies-54795&lt;/ref&gt; According to family members, he had been suffering from respiratory problems.

He was buried in [[Addis Ababa]], in the [[Holy Trinity Cathedral (Addis Ababa)|Holy Trinity Cathedral]] cemetery.

==Winning answer==
'''Final Question in Miss Earth 2002:''' "Which has more significance to your life right now, a sunrise or a sunset?"

'''Final Answers in Miss Earth 2002:''' "Of course, sunrise because, first, it's romantic and when you look at sunrise you can feel something beautiful, a new day, and a new life. And when you look at sunrise I can feel positive energy to do something good for Earth. And I would like to say that it's not about sunrise, it's about our Mother Earth because we just have one home. So stop talking. Start acting." - [[Džejla Glavović]], represented Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina '''(Dethroned Miss Earth 2002)'''.

"To me, the sunrise and the sunset are very important. But I must say, the sunrise is more important. I look forward to a brighter day. A day when all of us will put our hands together to fight against all our environmental problems and to live a better lives. Therefore, I believe all of us would like our children to have a better day. A day which they can breathe fresh air and drink fresh water and live a happy life." - [[Winnie Adah Omwakwe]], represented Kenya '''(Succeeded Miss Kenya as Miss Earth 2002)'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss Earth 2002 Finals Night Review |url=http://missosology.org/me021.html |publisher=Analyzing Beauty Pageants |first=Ric |last=Galvez |date=October 30, 2002 |accessdate=January 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120065758/http://missosology.org/me021.html |archivedate=November 20, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edible fungi in basket 2012 G1.jpg|thumb|right|A basket of edible mushrooms from Ukraine]]

'''Mushroom hunting''', '''Houby hunting''', '''mushrooming''', '''mushroom picking''', '''mushroom [[foraging]]''', and similar terms describe the activity of gathering [[mushroom]]s in the wild, typically for food. This practice is popular throughout most of [[Europe]],  [[Australia]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], parts of the [[Middle East]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]], as well as the [[temperate climate|temperate]] regions of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].

== Identifying mushrooms ==
[[Image:Mushroom cap morphology2.png|thumb|right|Morphological characteristics of the caps of mushroom, such as those illustrated in the above chart, are essential for correct mushroom identification.]]

A large number of mushroom species are favored for eating by mushroom hunters.  The [[Boletus edulis|king bolete]] is a popular delicacy. [[Sulphur shelf]] (also known as chicken mushroom and chicken of the woods) is often gathered because it occurs in bulk, recurs year after year, is easily identified, and has a wide variety of culinary uses. [[Pine mushroom]]s, [[chanterelle]]s, [[morel]]s, [[oyster mushroom]]s, [[puffballs]] and [[polypore]]s are among the most popular types of mushrooms to gather, most of these being fairly simple to properly identify by anyone with practice. Much more care, education, and experience is typically required to make a positive identification of many species, however, and as such, few collect from more dangerous groups, such as ''[[Amanita]]'', which include some of the most [[Alpha-amanitin|toxic mushrooms]] in existence.

Many [[field guide]]s on mushrooms are available and recommended to help safely distinguish edible from the many poisonous mushrooms.

Identification is not the only element of mushroom hunting that takes practice; knowing where and when to search does as well. Most mushroom species require very specific conditions. Some only grow at the base of a certain type of tree, for example. Finding a desired species that is known to grow in a certain region can be a challenge.

=== Safety issues ===
[[File:Clitocybe rivulosa 20081116w.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Clitocybe rivulosa]]'' is an example of a deadly mushroom species sometimes misidentified as an edible species.]]
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|

{{details|Mushroom poisoning|List of deadly fungi}}
A Czech adage warns that "{{lang|cs|všechny houby jsou jedlé, ale některé jenom jednou.}}" Translated, that "every mushroom is edible, but some only once."
Some mushrooms are deadly or extremely hazardous when consumed. Some that are not deadly can nevertheless cause permanent organ damage.

Common safety advice includes:
* That only positively identified mushrooms should be eaten
* That mushrooms be identified a second time during preparation and to cook them unless it can be verified that the species can be eaten raw
* That mushroom types not be combined
* That a sample of any mushroom not well-experienced will be retained for analysis in case of poisoning
* Familiarity with information about deadly mushrooms that are look-alikes of edible ones, as "deadly twins" differ regionally.
* When picking mushrooms in an unfamiliar region, e.g. in a foreign country or in an area a considerable distance from one's usual foraging sites, to exercise great caution even with mushrooms that are positively identified as edible based on prior experience. Mushroom guides explaining local species should be studied thoroughly.
* Not gathering mushrooms that are difficult to identify. This applies especially to the mushrooms of the [[genus]] ''[[Amanita]]'' and ''[[Cortinarius]]'' and "little brown mushrooms".
* Consuming only a small amount the first time a new species is tried. People react differently to different mushrooms, and all mushroom species can cause an adverse reaction in a few individuals, even the common [[champignon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Marco H. K. |last=Ho |first2=David J. |last2=Hill |year=2006 |title=White button mushroom food hypersensitivity in a child |journal=Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health |volume=42 |issue=9 |pages=555–556 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1754.2006.00922.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Little brown mushrooms ===
[[File:Inocybe spec. - Lindsey 1.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Inocybe lacera]]'' is a typical little brown mushroom, and is easily identifiable only by distinctive microscopic features.]]
"Little brown mushrooms" (or LBMs) refers to any of a large number of small, dull-coloured [[agaric]] species, with few [[wikt:macromorphology|macromorphological]] uniquely distinguishing characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mushroomthejournal.com/greatlakesdata/Terms/LBM527.html|title=LBM|website=www.mushroomthejournal.com|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, LBMs typically range from difficult to impossible for mushroom hunters to identify. Experienced mushroomers may discern more subtle identifying traits that help narrow the mushroom down to a particular genus or group of species, but exact identification of LBMs often requires close examination of microscopic characteristics plus a certain degree of familiarity or specialization in that particular group.

For mycologists, LBMs are the equivalent of LBJs ("[[little brown job]]s") and DYCs ("[[damned yellow composite]]s") that are the bane of ornithologists and botanists, respectively.

"Big white mushroom" (or BWM) is also sometimes used to describe groups of difficult to identify larger and paler agarics, many of which are in the genus ''[[Clitocybe]].''

=== Psychotropics ===
[[File:Psilocybe semilanceata.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Psilocybe semilanceata]]'' is hunted for its psychotropic properties.]]
{{details|Psilocybin mushrooms}}
The ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'''s [[psychotropic]] properties have been traditionally used by shamans in [[Siberia]] in their rituals. However, its use for such purposes today is very rare, despite the mushroom's abundance. Instead, the ''[[Psilocybe semilanceata]]'' is sought after for its hallucinogenic properties, the latter being more desirable with fewer side effects than those of ''A. muscaria''. The use of ''P. semilanceata'' is however significantly hindered by its small size, requiring larger quantities and being hard to spot. Other Psilocybe species are abundant in the American south and west, as well as Mexico, where they have been used by traditional shamans for centuries. In the west, one can often find mushroom pickers in cow pastures in a stereotypical stoop looking in the grass for psilocybes. This can be quite dangerous, as many species grow in pastures and amateurs often misidentify psilocybes.

* ''[[Psilocybe semilanceata]]'' (Псилоциба Сосочковидная [Psilotsiba Sosochkovidnaya] - Nipple-Like Psylocybe; ''Liberty Cap'')

== Regional importance ==

[[File:Market Mushrooms.JPG|thumb|250px|Forest-picked mushrooms at a Ukrainian market in [[Kolomyia]], [[Ukraine]]]]
*In the United States mushroom picking is popular in the Appalachian area and on the west coast from San Francisco Bay northward, in northern [[California]], [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and in many other regions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}
*British enthusiasts today enjoy an extended average picking season of 75 days compared to just 33 in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gange |first=A. C. |first2=E. G. |last2=Gange |first3=T. H. |last3=Sparks |first4=L. |last4=Boddy |year=2007 |title=Rapid and recent changes in fungal fruiting patterns |journal=[[Science (magazine)|Science]] |volume=317 |issue=5821 |pages=71 |doi=10.1126/science.1137489 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Japan]], particular mushroom types are hunted, with particular importance given to delicacies such as the [[Matsutake]] mushroom.
*In [[Slavs|Slavic]] countries and [[Baltic States|Baltic]] countries, mushroom picking is a common family activity. After a heavy rain during the mushroom season whole families often venture into the nearest forest, picking bucketfuls of mushrooms, which are cooked and eaten for dinner upon return (most often in omelettes with eggs or fried in butter) or alternatively dried or [[marination|marinated]] for later consumption.

=== Festivals ===
The popularity of mushroom picking in some parts of the world has led to mushroom festivals. The festivals are usually between September and October, depending on the mushrooms available in a particular region. Festivals in North America include:
*Bamfield, British Columbia — Bamfield Fungus Festival
*[[Berwyn, Illinois|Berwyn]], Illinois - Houby Festival
*Boyne City, Michigan—Annual National Morel Mushroom Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morelfest.com/|title=National Morel Mushroom Festival - Official site for the Mushroom Festival held each May in Boyne City, Michigan|website=www.morelfest.com|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Buena Vista, Colorado—Buena Vista Heritage's Mushroom Festival
*Washington's Long Beach Peninsula—Wild Mushroom Celebration

=== Radiation ===
[[Nuclear fallout]] from the [[Chernobyl disaster]] is an important issue concerning mushroom picking in Europe. Due to the wide spread of their [[mycelium]], mushrooms tend to accumulate more radioactive [[caesium-137]] than surrounding soil and other organisms. State agencies (e.g. [[Bellesrad]] in Belarus) monitor and analyze the degree of [[radionuclide]] accumulation in various wild species of plants and animals. In particular, Bellesrad claims that Svinushka (''[[Paxillus]]'' ssp.), Maslenok (''[[Suillus]]'' ssp.), Mokhovik (''[[Xerocomus]]'' ssp.), and Horkushka (''[[Lactarius rufus]]'') are the worst ones in this respect. The safest one is Opyonok Osyenniy (''[[Armillaria mellea]]''). This is an issue not only in [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]]: the fallout also reached western Europe, and until recently the German government discouraged people gathering certain mushrooms.

The situation is treated with black humor in some [[Russian jokes#Chernobyl|Russian jokes]].''

== Guidelines for mushroom picking ==

=== Poisonous mushrooms commonly confused with edible ones ===
{{See also|Mushroom poisoning#Poisonous species|List of deadly fungi}}
Many mushroom guidebooks call attention to similarities between species, especially significant if an edible species is similar to, or commonly confused with, one that is potentially harmful.

Examples:
* False chanterelles (''[[Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca]]''), as the name suggests, can look like real chanterelles (''[[Cantharellus]] cibarius'') to the inexperienced eye. The latter do not have sharp gills, but rather blunt veins on the underside.  Misidentification in this case is not likely to prove significantly dangerous, as false chanterelles are considered edible, but unpleasant tasting. Mild symptoms have been reported from consuming them.&lt;ref&gt;Arora, David.  Mushrooms Demystified.  Ten Speed Press, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the [[Jack O'Lantern Mushroom|Jack O'Lantern mushroom]] is often mistaken for a chanterelle, and it is potently toxic.
* True morels are distinguished from [[false morel]]s (''Gyromitra spp.'' and ''Verpa spp.''). False morels have caps attached at the top of the stalk, while true morels have a honeycombed cap and a single, continuous hollow chamber within.
* Immature ''[[Chlorophyllum molybdites]]'' can be confused with edible ''[[Agaricus]]'' mushrooms.
* Immature [[puffball]]s are generally edible, but care must be taken to avoid species such as ''[[Scleroderma citrinum]]'' and immature ''[[Amanita]]''s. These can be identified by cutting a puffball in half and looking for a dark reticulated [[gleba]] or the articulated, nonhomogeneous structures of a gilled mushroom, respectively.
* Highly poisonous ''[[Conocybe filaris]]'' and some ''[[Galerina]]'' species can resemble ''[[Psilocybe]]'', and the species are observed growing alongside each other. Psilocybe species are not deadly but contain the alkaloids psilocybin and psilocin, known to cause hallucinogenic effects; therefore it is often sought for use as a recreational psychedelic drug.

=== Eating poisonous species ===
There are treatments to reduce or eliminate the toxicity of certain (but not all) poisonous species to the point where they may be edible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamrubel.com/wild-mushrooms/amanita-muscaria/|title=Amanita muscaria, edibile if parboiled|date=30 September 2011|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[false morel]]s are deadly poisonous when eaten raw or incorrectly prepared, but their toxins can be reduced by a proper method of parboiling. Prepared in this way, this mushroom is widely used and considered a delicacy in many European countries, although recent research suggests that there may still be long-term health consequences from eating it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namyco.org/images/pdf_files/Poisonings30year.pdf Michael W. Beug, Marilyn Shaw, and Kenneth W. Cochran.  Thirty plus Years of Mushroom Poisoning: Summary of the Approximately 2,000 Reports in the NAMA Case Registry.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221101706/http://namyco.org/images/pdf_files/Poisonings30year.pdf |date=2010-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commonly gathered mushrooms ==
[[File:Maitake.jpg|thumb|A large hen of the woods ([[Maitake]]) specimen found in New York state.]]
Commonly gathered species, grouped by their order [[taxa]], are as follows:
'''mushroom species mentioned in each group are listed at the end of the paragraph using the following convention:'''
Latin name (common English names, if any).

=== [[Agaricaceae]] ===
The genus ''[[Macrolepiota]]'', usually ''[[Macrolepiota procera]]'', and, to a lesser extent, ''M. rhacodes'' are highly regarded, especially in Europe, being very palatable and very large, with specimens of ''M. procera'' as high as one metre being reported.

*'' [[Agaricus bisporus]]'' also known as the table or button mushroom. Sales of this mushroom in 1996 reached $209 million in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1SEC824762|title=Hans E. Gruen|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another well known mushroom known as the ''portobello'' is a large brown strain of this fungus.
*''[[Coprinus comatus]]'' (shaggy ink cap) decomposes into ink, and hence are prepared soon after picking and only young specimens are collected. While being a general mushroom hunting guideline, the avoidance of specimens growing in areas with high [[pollution]] is especially important with this family, as it is a very effective pollutant absorber.
* ''[[Macrolepiota procera]]'' (parasol mushroom)

=== [[Amanitaceae]] ===
While the family of amanitas are approached with extreme caution, as it contains the lethal ''[[Amanita phalloides]]'' and ''[[Amanita virosa]]'', those confident in their skills often pick the ''[[Amanita rubescens]]'', which is highly prized in [[Europe]] and to a much lesser extent in Russia, accounted by some not to superior taste, but to its relation to the ''[[Amanita caesarea]]'', which is not found in Russia, but was considered a delicacy worthy of the emperor in [[Ancient Rome]].
* ''[[Amanita rubescens]]'' (European blusher)
* ''[[Amanita caesarea]]'' (Caesar's mushroom)

=== [[Boletaceae]] ===

[[File:Cep in basket 2006 G01.jpg|thumb|right|A collection of ''[[Boletus edulis]]'']]

This order is often viewed as the order of "noble" mushrooms, containing few poisonous species, identifiable with relative ease, and having superior palatability. The most notable species is the ''[[Boletus edulis]]'', the "mushroom king", an almost legendary, relatively rare mushroom, edible in almost any (even raw) form, and commonly considered ''the'' best-tasting mushroom.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} (It is common to confuse the Russian name, literally "white mushroom", with [[champignon]]s, often known in English as "white mushrooms".)
* ''[[Boletus edulis]]'' (''Hřib Smrkový, Dubák, Borowik szlachetny, Porcino, King Bolete, Cep, Steinpilz'')

The genus ''Leccinum'' includes two well-known mushroom species named after the trees they can usually be found next to. The ''[[Leccinum aurantiacum]]'' (as well as the ''[[Leccinum versipelle]]''), found under [[aspen]] trees, and the ''[[Leccinum scabrum]]'' (as well as the ''[[L. holopus]]''), found under [[birch]] trees. The secondary mentioned species, are significantly different in cap colour only. Both types are very sought after, being highly palatable, while more common than the B. edulis.
* ''[[Leccinum aurantiacum]]'' (red-capped scaber stalk)
* ''[[Leccinum scabrum]]'' (birch bolete)

The genus ''[[Suillus]]'', characterised by its slimy cap, is another prized mushroom, the ''[[Suillus luteus]]'' and ''[[Suillus granulatus]]'' being its most common varieties, and while abundant in some parts of Eurasia, is a rare occurrence in others. It is easy to identify and very palatable.
* ''[[Suillus]]'' (klouzek, slippery Jack, butter mushroom)

The genus ''[[Xerocomus]]'' is generally considered a less desirable (though mostly edible) mushroom group, due to common abundant [[mould]] growth on their caps, which can make them poisonous. The ''[[Boletus badius|Xerocomus badius]]'', however is an exception, being moderately sought after, especially in Europe. Some scientific classifications now consider species in the genus ''Xerocomus'' as members of ''Boletus''.
* ''[[Xerocomus]]'' (mossiness mushroom)
* ''[[Boletus badius|Xerocomus badius]]'' (''hřib hnědý'')

=== [[Cantharellaceae]] ===

[[File:--GFDL--Voveraite.JPG|thumb|right|[[Chanterelle]]s]]

The ''[[Cantharellus cibarius]]'', a common and popular mushroom, especially in Europe, is a choice edible and unique mushroom. It is very rarely infested by [[worm]]s or [[larva]]e, has a unique appearance, and when rotting, the decomposed parts are easily distinguishable and separable from those that are edible.
* ''[[Cantharellus cibarius]]'' (chanterelle, yellow chanterelle, pfifferling)

=== [[Helvellaceae]] ===

The ''[[Gyromitra esculenta]]'' is considered poisonous, but can be consumed if dried and stored for over a year, according to Slavic literature, and can be used to supplement or replace [[morel]] (see ''Morchellaceae'' below) mushrooms, while Western literature claims that even the fumes of the mushroom are dangerous. It is similar to morels both in appearance and palatability.
* ''[[Gyromitra esculenta]]'' (false morel, beefsteak morel, lorchel)

=== [[Morchellaceae]] ===

[[File:Mushroom Magic Meal cropped.jpg|thumb|right|A basket of [[Morchella|morels]]]]

The morel, ''[[Morchella esculenta]]'' is highly prized in Western Europe, India and North America. It is significantly less prized in Slavic countries where, like the ''Gyromitra esculenta'', it is considered marginally edible with mediocre palatability. Boiling the mushroom and discarding the water is often recommended.
* ''[[Morchella esculenta]]'' (morel, yellow morel)

=== [[Lactarius]] ===

Members of the genus ''[[Lactarius]]'', as the name suggests, lactate a milky liquid when wounded and are often scoffed upon by Western literature. The ''[[Lactarius deliciosus]]'' is however regarded as one of the most palatable mushrooms in Slavic culture, comparable to the ''Boletus edulis''. Also considered as similarly palatable are the species ''[[Lactarius necator]]'' and particularly ''[[Lactarius resimus]]''. Thermal treatment may however be necessary in some cases. Slightly less appealing due to its bitter taste is the ''[[Lactarius pubescens]]''.
* ''[[Lactarius deliciosus]]'' (saffron milk-cap)
* ''[[Lactarius resimus]]'' (pepper cap)
* ''[[Lactarius necator]]'' (black pepper cap)
* ''[[Lactarius pubescens]]'' (wooly milk-cap)

=== [[Russulaceae]] ===

The [[Russula]] family includes over 750 species and is one of the most common and abundant mushrooms in Eurasia.  Their cap colours include red, brown, yellow, blue and green and can be easily spotted. The ''[[Russula vesca]]'' species, one of the many red-capped varieties, is one of the most common, is reasonably palatable and can be eaten raw.  The edible Russulas have a mild taste, compared to many inedible or poisonous species that have a strong hot or bitter taste - but notice that the deadly poisonous Amanita phalloides, Amanita virosa and many other poisonous mushrooms have mild taste! The ''[[Russula emetica]]'' (the sickener) is known to cause gastrointestinal upset and has a very hot taste when a small bit is placed on the tongue.  Due to their abundance they are however often regarded as an inferior mushroom for hunting, since they may be eaten if [[parboiled]].
* ''[[Russula vesca]]'' (Russula)

=== [[Tricholomataceae]] ===

* ''[[Armillaria]]'' (honey mushroom, shoestring rot). The genus ''[[Armillaria]]'', with the popular species ''A. gallica'' and ''A. mellea'', being so similar that they are rarely differentiated, are palatable, highly abundant mushrooms. Generally found on decaying [[tree stump]]s, they grow in very large quantities and are easy to spot and identify, arguably reducing the fun and challenge in mushroom hunting.
* ''[[Pleurotus ostreatus]]'' (oyster mushroom). It is the most commonly picked tree-dwelling mushroom and is often also artificially cultivated for sale in grocery stores. This sturdy mushroom can be quite palatable when young. Growing these mushrooms at home can be a profitable enterprise and some Russians engage in the activity.

[[Image:matsutakeredpinemushroomhunting.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Matsutake]]'', the highly sought-after pine mushroom, found in [[coniferous]] forests in [[Hiroshima]] in autumn]]

*''[[Tricholoma matsutake]]'' - = syn. ''T. nauseosum'', the rare red pine mushroom that has a very fine aroma. Its fragrance is both sweet and spicy. They grow under trees and are usually concealed under fallen leaves and the duff layer. It forms a symbiotic relationship with the roots of a limited number of tree species. In Japan it is most commonly associated with Japanese red pine. However, in the Pacific Northwest it is found in coniferous forests of [[Douglas fir]], [[noble fir]], [[sugar pine]], and [[Ponderosa pine]]. Farther south, it is also associated with hardwoods, namely [[tanoak]] and [[madrone]] forests. The Pacific Northwest and other similar temperate regions along the Pacific Rim also hold great habitat producing these and other quality wild mushrooms. In 1999, N. Bergius and E. Danell reported that Swedish (''Tricholoma nauseosum'') and Japanese matsutake (''T. matsutake'') are the same species. The report caused the increased import from Northern Europe to Japan because of the comparable flavor and taste. Matsutake are difficult to find and are therefore very expensive. Moreover, domestic productions of Matsutake in Japan have been sharply reduced over the last fifty years due to a pine [[nematode]] ''[[Bursaphelenchus xylophilus]]'', and it has influenced the price a great deal. The annual harvest of matsutake in Japan has since further decreased. The price for matsutake in the Japanese market is highly dependent on quality, availability and origin. The Japanese matsutake at the beginning of the season, which is the highest grade, can go up to $2000 per kilogram, while the average value for imported matsutake from China, Europe, and the United States is only about $90 per kilogram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/forum/en/node/2368|title=Finding and Preparing The Elusive Matsutake Mushroom|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Tricholoma magnivelare]]'' is a prized mushroom in North America. British Columbia exports large quantities of this mushroom overseas to Asia where it is in high demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/sep2000.html|title=Tricholoma magnivelare, the American matsutake mushroom, Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month for September 2000|website=botit.botany.wisc.edu|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Old Bill's Fun Run For Charities''' (also commonly referred to as '''Old Bill’s''') is an innovative [[fundraising]] event, administered by the Community Foundation of Jackson Hole, which takes place annually in the town of [[Jackson, Wyoming]]. The first event of its kind in the nation, Old Bill's began in 1997 and to date has helped [[Jackson Hole]] charities raise over $121 million. Funds from the event are restricted for use in [[Teton County, Wyoming]] and [[Teton County, Idaho]], however 2007 marked the last year of participation by charities from [[Idaho]].

With the help of Old Bill's Fun Run, the Community Foundation of Jackson Hole was recognized in 2001 as the number one per capita granting community foundation in the [[United States]], an honor it has consistently earned every year since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfjacksonhole.org/a7.html|title=cfjacksonhole.org/a7.html] {{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The idea for Old Bill's Fun Run for Charities came from an anonymous couple affectionately known as Mr. and Mrs. Old Bill, whose vision was to expand the charitable pie in Jackson Hole by encouraging the entire community to participate in [[philanthropy]].

With the help of the Community Foundation, they developed a fundraising structure whereby donors could contribute to as many organizations as they liked with one simple donation to the Community Foundation and the money would be matched by Mr. and Mrs. Old Bill and several other major contributors known as Co-Challengers. Additionally, Mr. and Mrs. Old Bill specified that $250,000 from the Match Fund be set aside each year for use in the Community Foundation’s biannual competitive grant allocations. To celebrate the community’s philanthropic spirit, the giving period concludes with a [[Fun run]] in the heart of town, probably the single most unifying event in the Jackson Hole community.

== How it works ==
Each year, Mr. and Mrs. Old Bill donate $500,000 to the Match. The Community Foundation of Jackson Hole then solicits additional matching contributions from donors called Co-Challengers. Co-Challengers donate at five levels: Titanium ($100,000), Platinum ($75,000), Gold ($50,000), Silver ($35,000) and Bronze ($25,000).

In the months leading up to the event, donors make gifts of all sizes to their favorite nonprofits and charities. Old Bill's makes giving easy as donors need only fill out one form and write one check to give to as many local organizations as they like. Non-profits can raise as much money as they wish, of which the Community Foundation matches the first $25,000. They still receive 100% of donor contributions in excess of $25,000, but that money is not matched.

On the second Saturday of September, over 4,000 people come together for a giant celebration of community spirit and support. The day is filled with a Fun Run and Walk, entertainment, food and informational booths. The magic of a community celebration combined with ease of giving has increased awareness about the work of Jackson Hole organizations and has enabled them to raise over $121 million in the last nineteen years. Along with the money, the ideal of a broadly philanthropic, caring community has enriched Jackson Hole and the lives of its citizens.

== Calculating the match percentage ==
When the last contribution is tallied, the Community Foundation calculates the match percentage. From the total match money raised by the Co-Challengers, 20% is subtracted and distributed to local nonprofits through a twice-annual competitive grants process.

The remaining matching funds are compared to all eligible contributions made on behalf of local nonprofits. The ratio of matching funds to donor contributions provides the match percentage. The match is added to all funds raised by each participating non-profit allowing the donor's contribution to make an even larger impact!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7227">'''Pashtun nationalism''' ({{lang-ps|پښتون ملتپالنه}}) is a political and social movement which promotes the idea that the [[Pashtuns]] are deserving of a sovereign nation in their homeland of [[Pashtunistan]], which consists of the Pashtun-majority parts of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. Pashtun nationalism is closely linked to the cause of Pashtun home rule and Pashtun independence. In Afghanistan, Pashtun nationalists look after the interests of the Pashtun ethnic group and has its support only from them.&lt;ref name="Khalilzad"&gt;[[Zalmay Khalilzad]], ''"The Security of Southwest Asia"'', [[University of Michigan]], 2006, {{ISBN|0-566-00651-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They favor the ideas of a "Greater Afghanistan" (i.e. it claims the Pashtun-speaking parts of [[Pakistan]] for Afghanistan).&lt;ref name="Khalilzad" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Caron |first=James M |date=2009 |title=Cultural Histories of Pashtun Nationalism, Public Participation, and Social Inequality in Monarchic Afghanistan, 1905-1960
 |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=8aGpYgEACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the concept of Pashtun nationalism politically overlaps with '''Afghan nationalism'''.

==History==
One of the earliest Pashtun nationalists was the "warrior-poet" [[Pir Roshan|Bayazid Pir Roshan]]. Another early Pashtun nationalist was [[Khushal Khattak|Khushal Khan Khattak]], who was imprisoned by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Aurangzeb]] for trying to incite the Pashtuns to rebel against the rule of the Mughals. However, despite sharing a common language and believing in a common ancestry, the Pashtuns first achieved unity in the 18th century after being under foreign rule for many centuries. The eastern parts of Pashtunistan was ruled by the [[Mughal Empire]], while the western parts were ruled by the Persian [[Safavids]] as their easternmost provinces. During the early 18th century, Pashtun tribes led by [[Mirwais Hotak]] successfully revolted against the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] in the city of [[Kandahar]]. In a chain of events, he declared [[Loy Kandahar]] and other parts of what is now southern Afghanistan independent. By 1738 the Mughal Empire had been crushingly defeated and their [[sack of Delhi|capital sacked and looted]] by forces of a new Iranian ruler; the military genius and commander [[Nader Shah]]. Besides Persian, Turkmen, and Caucasian forces, Nader was also accompanied by the young [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], and 4,000 well trained Pashtun troops from what is now Afghanistan and North-west Pakistan.

After the death of Nader Shah in 1747 and the disintegration of his massive empire, Ahmad Shah Durrani created his own large and powerful [[Durrani Empire]], which included Pashtunistan, and most of nowadays Pakistan, among other regions. The famous couplet by [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] describes the association the people have with the regional city of Kandahar:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Da Dili takht ze herauma cheh rayad kam, zama da shkule Pashtunkhwa da ghro saruna".
Translation: "I forget the throne of Delhi when I recall, the mountain peaks of my beautiful Pashtunkhwa."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The last [[Durrani Empire|Afghan Empire]] was established in 1747 and united all the different [[Pashtun tribes]] as well as many other ethnic groups. Parts of the Pashtunistan region around [[Peshawar]] was invaded by [[Ranjit Singh]] and his [[Sikh]] army in the early part of the 19th century, but a few years later they were defeated by the [[British Raj]], the new powerful empire which reached the Pashtunistan region from the east.

Famous Pashtun [[Indian independence movement|independence activists]] against the rule of the British Raj include [[Bacha Khan]], [[Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai]], and [[Mirzali Khan]] (Faqir of Ipi). Bacha Khan and his followers, the [[Khudai Khidmatgars]], strongly opposed the [[All-India Muslim League]]'s demand for the [[partition of India]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica-Abdul Ghaffar Khan"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/232353/Khan-Abdul-Ghaffar-Khan| title = Abdul Ghaffar Khan|publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iloveindia.com -Abdul Ghaffar Khan"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.iloveindia.com/indian-heroes/abdul-ghaffar-khan.html| title = Abdul Ghaffar Khan|publisher = I Love India|accessdate = 24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Indian National Congress]] declared its acceptance of the partition plan without consulting the Khudai Khidmatgar leaders, Bacha Khan felt very sad and told the Congress "you have thrown us to the wolves."&lt;ref name="icdc.com"&gt;[http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/pakistan/pashtunistan.htm#pashtunistanpoliticsPakistan: Partition and Military Succession Documents from the U.S. National Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, Bacha Khan, Mirzali Khan, and the [[Khudai Khidmatgar]] movement declared the [[Bannu Resolution]], demanding that the Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state of [[Pashtunistan]] composing all Pashtun territories of British India, instead of being made to join Pakistan. However, the British Raj refused to comply with the demand of this resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ali Shah |first=Sayyid Vaqar |date=1993 |title=Afghanistan and the Frontier |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c05uAAAAMAAJ |location=[[University of Michigan]] |publisher=Emjay Books International |page=256 |isbn= |editor1-first=Fazal-ur-Rahim Khan |editor1-last=Marwat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=H Johnson |first1=Thomas |author-link1=Thomas Howard Johnson |last2=Zellen |first2=Barry |date=2014 |title=Culture, Conflict, and Counterinsurgency |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B9ZZAgAAQBAJ |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |page=154 |isbn= 9780804789219}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the creation of Pakistan in 1947, Mirzali Khan and his followers refused to recognize Pakistan and continued their guerrilla war against the new state’s government from their base in [[Gurwek]], [[Waziristan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://tribune.com.pk/story/77388/the-faqir-of-ipi-of-north-waziristan/ The Faqir of Ipi of North Waziristan]. ''[[The Express Tribune]]''. November 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Mirzali Khan also announced the creation of Pashtunistan as an independent nation. A Pashtun [[jirga]], held in [[Razmak]], Waziristan, appointed Mirzali Khan as the President of the National Assembly for Pashtunistan. Mirzali Khan didn't surrender to the government of Pakistan throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tribune.com.pk/story/1086737/april-1891-1960-the-legendary-guerilla-faqir-of-ipi-unremembered-on-his-115th-anniversary/ The legendary guerilla Faqir of Ipi unremembered on his 115th anniversary].

'''Richard Floyd McCoy Jr.''' (December 7, 1942 – November 9, 1974) was an American [[Aircraft hijacking|aircraft hijacker]].  McCoy hijacked a [[United Airlines]] passenger jet for ransom in 1972. Due to a similar ''[[modus operandi]]'', law enforcement officials named McCoy as a suspect for the still-unidentified "[[D. B. Cooper]]," who committed his unsolved crime four-and-a-half months before McCoy.

==Biography==

===Early life===
McCoy was born December 7, 1942, in the town of [[Kinston, North Carolina]], and grew up in nearby [[Cove City, North Carolina|Cove City]]. In 1962 McCoy moved to [[Provo, Utah]], and enrolled at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) before dropping out to serve a two-year [[tour of duty]] in the [[United States Army|Army]]. He served in [[Vietnam veteran|Vietnam]] as a [[demolition]] expert and [[Aviator|pilot]]&lt;ref name="timemag"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff|title=The Real McCoy |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943370-1,00.html |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=April 24, 1972 |accessdate=2007-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded the [[Purple Heart]] in 1964.

In 1965 McCoy returned to BYU, where he met Karen Burns. They married in August 1965 in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]]. By 1971 they had two children, Chanti and Richard.

McCoy served another term in the Army on the condition he could go to Vietnam, where he was awarded both the [[Army Commendation Medal]] and [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]. Upon returning to [[Utah]], he served as a [[warrant officer]] in the [[Utah National Guard]] and was an avid [[Skydiving|skydiver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Associated Press]] |title=Skydiver Held as Hijacker; $500,000 Is Still Missing |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/10/archives/skydiver-held-as-hijacker-500000-is-still-missing-skydiver-held-as.html |page=1 |date=April 10, 1972 |accessdate=2007-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCoy taught [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Mormon Sunday school]] and studied law enforcement at BYU. His purported dream was to become an [[FBI]] or [[CIA]] agent.

===Criminal career===
[[File:727db.gif|thumb|350px|Animation showing the same [[modus operandi]] as [[D. B. Cooper]] (click to view animation)]]
On April 7, 1972, McCoy boarded United Airlines Flight 855 under the alias "James Johnson"  during a stopover in [[Denver, Colorado]]. The aircraft was a [[Boeing 727]] with [[aft]] stairs (the same equipment used in the [[D. B. Cooper]] incident), via which McCoy escaped in mid-flight by parachute after giving the crew similar instructions as Cooper had. McCoy had obtained a $500,000 cash ransom, and carried a novelty hand-grenade and an empty pistol.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Police began investigating McCoy following a tip from a motorist. The driver had picked up McCoy hitch-hiking at a fast-food restaurant, where McCoy was wearing a jumpsuit and carrying a [[duffel bag]]. McCoy had also described to an [[Wiktionary:acquaintance#Noun|acquaintance]] how easy it would be to carry out such a hijacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/mccoy/mccoy.htm |title=Famous Cases: Richard Floyd McCoy, Jr. – Aircraft Hijacking |accessdate=2007-07-26 |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715093935/http://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/mccoy/mccoy.htm |archivedate=July 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following fingerprint and [[questioned document examination|handwriting match]]es, McCoy was arrested two days after the hijacking. McCoy was on [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] duty flying one of the helicopters involved in the search for the hijacker. Inside his house, FBI agents found a jumpsuit and a duffel bag filled with cash totaling $499,970.&lt;ref name="timemag"/&gt;

McCoy claimed innocence, but was convicted of the hijacking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Associated Press]] |title=Viet Veteran Convicted Of Colorado Air Piracy |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |page=A3 |date=July 1, 1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and received a 45-year sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Associated Press]] |title=45-Year Term Given Veteran In Hijack of Jet, $200,000 |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |page=A14 |date=July 11, 1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[Incarceration|incarcerated]] at the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|Federal penitentiary]] at [[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania]], McCoy used his access to the prison's dental office to fashion a fake handgun out of dental paste.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The FBI Files]]'' episode "Flight From Justice – The Story of D.B. Cooper"&lt;/ref&gt; He and a crew of convicts escaped on August 10, 1974 by commandeering a [[garbage truck]] and crashing it through the prison's main gate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[United Press International]]|title=4 Inmates Escape From Lewisburg |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/11/archives/4-inmates-escape-from-lewisburg-they-seize-truck-and-ram-it-through.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=26 |date=August 11, 1974 |accessdate=2007-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three months later the FBI located McCoy in [[Virginia Beach]], Virginia. News reports stated that on November 9, 1974, McCoy walked into his home and was met by FBI agents;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Don |last=Hunsberger |title=Detective stories |url=http://www.thevillagesdailysun.com/articles/2005/12/29/villages/villages01.txt |newspaper=The Villages Daily Sun |date=December 29, 2005 |accessdate=2007-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he fired at them, and an agent fired back with a shotgun, killing McCoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Associated Press]] |title=Hijacker Shot Dead in Va. by FBI |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |page=C2 |date=November 11, 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits over Cooper allegations==
1991 saw the publication of ''D. B. Cooper: The Real McCoy'', by [[FBI]] agents Bernie Rhodes and Russell P. Calame. Both authors investigated McCoy's skyjacking case, and their book posits that Cooper and McCoy were really the same person. They cited similar methods of hijacking, and a tie and [[Brigham Young University]] medallion{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} with McCoy's initials on the back left on the plane by Cooper.

After the book's publication, McCoy's widow filed suit against the book's authors and publisher, and her former attorney, Thomas S. Taylor. She claimed they misrepresented her involvement in the hijacking for which McCoy was convicted, and also misrepresented later events from interviews done with Taylor in the 1970s. She sought an injunction against publication and distribution of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Associated Press]] |title=Widow of Man Linked in Book to Skyjacker D. B. Cooper Sues Authors, Provo Attorney |newspaper=[[Deseret News]] |page=B5 |date=January 18, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During court proceedings, it was revealed that McCoy's widow was deeply involved in the hijacking. Her request for an injunction to prohibit further sales of the book was denied. However, an injunction to prohibit the sale of movie rights to the book – conditional upon the movie including references to four specific allegations in the book that she protested – was granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Marianne |last=Funk |title=McCoy's Widow Admits Helping in '72 Hijacking |newspaper=[[Deseret News]] |page=B4 |date=February 21, 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. McCoy accepted [[settlement (litigation)|settlements]] in 1994.  The book's publisher, U. press, paid Karen McCoy $20,000. Taylor was ordered to pay her $100,000.  The two authors' settlements are confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Funk|first1=Marianne|title=HIJACKER'S WIDOW TO GAIN $120,000|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/331922/HIJACKERS-WIDOW-TO-GAIN-120000.html|accessdate=16 April 2018|work=DeseretNews.com|publisher=Deseret News Publishing Company|date=19 January 1994|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-assembly''' is a phenomenon where the components of a system assemble themselves to form a larger functional unit. This spontaneous organization can be due to direct specific interaction, collective effects, and/or occur indirectly through their environment. Due to the proliferation of [[nanoparticle]] synthesis techniques, the study and design of nanoparticle self-assembly has become widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glotzer|first1=S.C.|title=Some Assembly Required|journal=Science |volume=306|pages=419-420|date=2004|doi=10.1126/science.1099988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spatial arrangements of these self-assembled nanoparticles can be potentially used to build increasingly complex structures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boles|first1=Michael A.|last2=Engel|first2=Michael|last3=Talapin|first3=Dmitri V.|title=Self-Assembly of Colloidal Nanocrystals: From Intricate Structures to Functional Materials|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=116|issue=18|pages=11220–11289|date=2016|doi=10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00196}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a wide variety of materials that can be used for different purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubler|first1=A.|last2=Osuagwu|first2=O.|title=Digital quantum batteries: Energy and information storage in nanovacuum tube arrays|journal=Complexity|pages=NA|date=2010|doi=10.1002/cplx.20306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubler|first1=A.|last2=Lyon|first2=D.|title=Gap size dependence of the dielectric strength in nano vacuum gaps|journal=IEEE|volume=20|issue=4|pages=1467|date=2014|doi=10.1109/TDEI.2013.6571470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the molecular level, [[intermolecular force]] hold the spontaneous gathering of molecules into a well-defined and stable structure together. In chemical solutions, self-assembly is an outcome of random motion of molecules and the affinity of their binding sites for one another. In the area of [[nanotechnology]], developing a simple, efficient method to organize molecules and molecular clusters into precise, pre-determined structure is crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shinn|first1=E.|last2=Hubler|first2=A.|last3=Lyon|first3=D.|last4=Grosse-Perdekamp|first4=M.|last5=Bezryadin|first5=A.|last6=Belkin|first6=A.|title=Nuclear energy conversion with stacks of graphene nanocapacitors|journal=Complexity|volume=18|issue=3|pages=24|date=2013|doi=10.1002/cplx.21427|bibcode=2013Cmplx..18c..24S}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Self-Assembly of Nanoparticles.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|An example of self-assembly of nanoparticles in a solution. In this diagram, it can be seen that a disordered system formed an organized structure which can be due to specific interactions among the particles.]]

==History==
The study of self-assembly of nanoparticles began with recognition that some properties of atoms and molecules enable them to arrange themselves into patterns. A variety of applications where the self-assembly of nanoparticles might be useful. For example, building sensors or computer chips. Nanoparticles have been observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to self-assemble in real-time.

==Thermodynamics==
Self-assembly is an equilibrium process, i.e. the individual and assembled components exist in equilibrium.&lt;ref name=Thermo&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Mahony|first=C.T.|author2=Farell, R.A |author3=Holmes, J.D. |author4= Morris, M.A. |title=The thermodynamics of defect formation in self-assembled systems|doi=10.5772/20145|journal=Thermodynamics—Systems in Equilibrium and Non-Equilibrium|year=2011|pages=279–306|isbn=978-953-307-283-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the lower free energy is usually a result of a weaker intermolecular force between self-assembled moieties and is essentially enthalpic in nature.

The thermodynamics of the self-assembly process can be represented by a simple Gibbs free energy equation:

&lt;br /&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \Delta G_{SA} = \Delta H_{SA} -T \Delta S_{SA} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where if &lt;math&gt; \Delta G_{SA} \,&lt;/math&gt; is negative, self-assembly is a spontaneous process. &lt;math&gt; \Delta H_{SA} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[enthalpy]] change of the process and is largely determined by the potential energy/intermolecular forces between the assembling entities. &lt;math&gt; \Delta S_{SA} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the change in [[entropy]] associated with the formation of the ordered arrangement. In general, the organization is accompanied by a decrease in entropy and in order for the assembly to be spontaneous the enthalpy term must be negative and in excess of the entropy term.&lt;ref name=Thermo /&gt;  This equation shows that as the value of &lt;math&gt; T \Delta S_{SA} \,&lt;/math&gt; approaches the value of &lt;math&gt; \Delta H_{SA} \,&lt;/math&gt; and above a critical temperature, the self-assembly process will become progressively less likely to occur and spontaneous self-assembly will not happen.

The self-assembly is governed by the normal processes of nucleation and growth. Small assemblies are formed because of their increased lifetime as the attractive interactions between the components lower the Gibbs free energy. As the assembly grows, the Gibbs free energy continues to decrease until the assembly becomes stable enough to last for a long period of time. The necessity of the self-assembly to be an equilibrium process is defined by the organization of the structure which requires non-ideal arrangements to be formed before the lowest energy configuration is found.

===Defects===

Self-assembled structure contain defects.  In most cases, the thermodynamic driving force for self-assembly is provided by weak intermolecular interactions and is usually of the same order of magnitude as the entropy term.&lt;ref name=Thermo /&gt;  In order for a self-assembling system to reach the minimum free energy configuration, there has to be enough thermal energy to allow the mass transport of the self-assembling molecules. For defect formation, the free energy of single defect formation is given by:

&lt;br /&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \Delta G_{DF} = \Delta H_{DF} -T \Delta S_{DF} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The enthalpy term, &lt;math&gt; \Delta H_{DF} \,&lt;/math&gt; does not necessarily reflect the intermolecular forces between the molecules, it is the energy cost associated with disrupting the pattern and may be thought of as a region where optimum arrangement does not occur and the reduction of enthalpy associated with ideal self-assembly did not occur. An example of this can be seen in a system of hexagonally packed cylinders where defect regions of lamellar structure exist.

If &lt;math&gt; \Delta G_{DF} \,&lt;/math&gt; is negative, there will be a finite number of defects in the system and the concentration will be given by:

&lt;br /&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; {N\over N_0} = \exp({-\Delta E_\text{act}\over RT}) \,&lt;/math&gt;

N is the number of defects in a matrix of N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; self-assembled particles or features and &lt;math&gt; \Delta E_\text{act} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the activation energy of defect formation. The activation energy, &lt;math&gt; \Delta E_{act} \,&lt;/math&gt;, should not be confused with &lt;math&gt; \Delta H_{DF} \,&lt;/math&gt;. The activation energy represents the energy difference between the initial ideally arranges state and a transition state towards the defective structure. At low defect concentrations, defect formation is entropy driven until a critical concentration of defects allows the activation energy term to compensate for entropy. There is usually an equilibrium defect density indicated at the minimum free energy. The activation energy for defect formation increases this equilibrium defect density.&lt;ref name=Thermo /&gt;

===Particle Interaction===
Intermolecular forces govern the particle interaction in self-assembled systems. The forces tend to be intermolecular in type rather than ionic or covalent because ionic or covalent bonds will “lock” the assembly into non-equilibrium structures. The types intermolecular forces seen in self-assembly processes are van der Waals, hydrogen bonds, and weak polar forces, just to name a few. In self-assembly, regular structural arrangements are frequently observed, therefore there must be a balance of attractive and repulsive between molecules otherwise an equilibrium distance will not exist between the particles. The repulsive forces can be electron cloud-electron cloud overlap or [[electrostatic repulsion]].&lt;ref name=Thermo /&gt;

==Processing==
The processes by which nanoparticles self-assemble are widespread and important.  Understanding why and how self-assembly occurs is key in reproducing and optimizing results.  Typically, nanoparticles will self-assemble for one or both of two reasons: molecular interactions and external direction.&lt;ref name=Directed&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grzelczak|first=Marek|title=Directed Self-Assembly of Nanoparticles|journal=ACS Nano|year=2010|volume=4|issue=7|pages=3591–3605|doi=10.1021/nn100869j}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-assembly by molecular interactions===

Nanoparticles have the ability to assemble chemically through covalent or noncovalent interactions with their capping ligand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boker|first=Alexander|title=Self Assembly of Nanoparticles at Interfaces|journal=Soft Matter|year=2007|volume=3|issue=10|pages=1231–1248|doi=10.1039/b706609k|bibcode = 2007SMat....3.1231B |url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&amp;context=todd_emrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminal functional group(s) on the particle are known as capping ligands. As these ligands tend to be complex and sophisticated, self-assembly can provide a simpler pathway for nanoparticle organization by synthesizing efficient functional groups. For instance, DNA oligomers have been a key ligand for nanoparticle building blocks to be self-assembling via sequence-based specific organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/articles/natrevmats20168 | doi=10.1038/natrevmats.2016.8| title=Using DNA to program the self-assembly of colloidal nanoparticles and microparticles| journal=Nature Reviews Materials| volume=1| issue=3| pages=16008| year=2016| last1=Rogers| first1=W.

[[nanomachines]]/nanobots, [[nanocomputers]], and many more uncharted systems.

====Intermolecular forces====
Nanoparticles can self-assemble as a result of their [[intermolecular forces]].  As systems look to minimize their free energy, self-assembly is one option for the system to achieve its lowest free energy thermodynamically.&lt;ref name=Directed/&gt;  Nanoparticles can be programmed to self-assemble by changing the functionality of their side groups, taking advantage of weak and specific intermolecular forces to spontaneously order the particles.  These direct interparticle interactions can be typical intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding or Van der Waals forces, but can also be internal characteristics, such as hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity.  For example, lipophilic nanoparticles have the tendency to self-assemble and form crystals as solvents are evaporated.&lt;ref name=Directed/&gt; While these aggregations are based on intermolecular forces, external factors such as temperature and pH also play a role in spontaneous self-assembly.

====Hamaker interaction====
As nanoparticle interactions take place on a nanoscale, the particle interactions must be scaled similarly.  Hamaker interactions take into account the polarization characteristics of a large number of nearby particles and the effects they have on each other. Hamaker interactions sum all of the forces between all particles and the solvent(s) involved in the system.  While [[Hamaker theory]] generally describes a macroscopic system, the vast number of nanoparticles in a self-assembling system allows the term to be applicable.  Hamaker constants for nanoparticles are calculated using [[Lifshitz theory]], and can often be found in literature.

===Externally directed self-assembly===
The natural ability of nanoparticles to self-assemble can be replicated in systems that do not intrinsically self-assemble.  Directed self-assembly (DSA) attempts to mimic the chemical properties of self-assembling systems, while simultaneously controlling the thermodynamic system to maximize self-assembly.

====Electric and magnetic fields====
External fields are the most common directors of self-assembly.  Electric and magnetic fields allow induced interactions to align the particles.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kralj|first1=Slavko|last2=Makovec|first2=Darko|title=Magnetic Assembly of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticle Clusters into Nanochains and Nanobundles|journal=ACS Nano|date=27 October 2015|volume=9|issue=10|pages=9700–9707|doi=10.1021/acsnano.5b02328}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fields take advantage of the [[polarizability]] of the nanoparticle and its functional groups.&lt;ref name=Directed/&gt; When these field-induced interactions overcome random [[Brownian motion]], particles join to form chains and then assemble.  At more modest field strengths, ordered crystal structures are established due to the induced dipole interactions.  Electric and magnetic field direction requires a constant balance between thermal energy and interaction energies.

====Flow fields====
Common ways of incorporating nanoparticle self-assembly with a flow include [[Langmuir–Blodgett film|Langmuir-Blodgett]], [[Dip-coating|dip coating]], flow coating and [[spin coating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grzelczak|first=Marek|last2=Vermant|first2=Jan|last3=Furst|first3=Eric M.|last4=Liz-Marzán|first4=Luis M.|date=2010-07-27|title=Directed Self-Assembly of Nanoparticles|url=https://doi.org/10.1021/nn100869j|journal=ACS Nano|volume=4|issue=7|pages=3591–3605|doi=10.1021/nn100869j|issn=1936-0851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Macroscopic viscous flow=====
Macroscopic viscous flow fields can direct self-assembly of a random solution of particles into ordered crystals.  However, the assembled particles tend to disassemble when the flow is stopped or removed.&lt;ref name=Directed/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Shear flows are useful for jammed suspensions or random close packing.  As these  systems begin in nonequilibrium, flow fields are useful in that they help the system relax towards ordered equilibrium.  Flow fields are also useful when dealing with complex matrices that themselves have rheological behavior.  Flow can induce anisotropic viseoelastic stresses, which helps to overcome the matrix and cause self-assembly.

=====Large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS)=====
Large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS){{clarify|reason=what is it?|date=January 2018}} is most effective for particles that are 100&amp;nbsp;nm-1&amp;nbsp;µm in size.&lt;ref name=Directed/&gt; Hard and soft shears can order in steady shear.  However, this assembly strongly relies on particle volume fraction, particle interaction potentials, polydisterity, and shear rate and strain.  The large amount of directing factors can cause complications in directing self-assembly by LAOS. Diblock copolymer micells have been studied in regard to structuring nanoparticles in bulk.

====Combination of fields====
The most effective self-assembly director is a combination of fields.&lt;ref name=Directed/&gt;  If the fields and conditions are optimized, self-assembly can be permanent and complete.  When a field combination is used with nanoparticles that are tailored to be intrinsically responsive, the most complete assembly is observed.  Combinations of fields allow the benefits of self-assembly, such as scalability and simplicity, to be maintained while being able to control orientation and structure formation.  Field combinations possess the greatest potential for future directed self-assembly work.

==Interfaces==

===Solid interfaces===
Nano-particles can self-assemble on solid surfaces after applying external forces (like magnetic, electric, and flow) as mentioned in the above section. Templates made of microstructures like carbon nanotubes or block polymers can also be used to assist in self-assembly; they cause directed self-assembly (DSA) in which active sites are embedded to selectively induce nanoparticle deposition. Such templates are considered as any object onto which different particles can be arranged into a structure with a morphology similar to that of the template.&lt;ref name="Solid Interface"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grzelczak|first=S.|author2=Vermant, J |author3=Furst, E.M. |author4= Liz-Marzan, L.M. |title=Directed Self-Assembly of Nanoparticles|journal=ACS Nano|year=2010|volume=4|issue=7|pages=3591–3605|doi=10.1021/nn100869j}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon nanotubes (microstructures), single molecules, or block copolymers are common templates.&lt;ref name="Solid Interface" /&gt;  Nanoparticles are often shown to self-assemble within distances of nanometers and micrometers, but block copolymer templates can be used to form well-defined self-assemblies over macroscopic distances. By incorporating active sites to the surfaces of nanotubes and polymers, the functionalization of these templates can be transformed to favor self-assembly of specified nanoparticles.

===Liquid interfaces===
Pickering and Ramsden explained the idea of [[pickering emulsion]]s when experimenting with paraffin-water emulsions with solid particles like iron oxide and silicon dioxide. They observed that the micron-sized colloids generated a resistant film at the interface between the two immiscible phases, inhibiting the coalescence of the emulsion drops.&lt;ref name="Liquid Interface"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boker|first=A.|author2=He, J. |author3=Emrick, T. |author4= Russell, T.P. |title=Self-assembly of nanoparticles at interfaces|journal=Soft Matter|year=2007|volume=3|issue=10|page=1231|doi=10.1039/b706609k|bibcode = 2007SMat....3.1231B |url=https://works.bepress.com/todd_emrick/8/download/}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Pickering emulsions, as shown in the figure below, are formed from the self-assembly of colloidal particles in two-part liquid systems, such as oil-water systems. The desorption energy, which is directly related to the stability of emulsions depends on the particle size, particle-particle interaction and, of course, particle-water and particle-oil interactions.&lt;ref name="Liquid Interface" /&gt; 
 
[[File:Oil and Water.jpg|thumb|Self-assembly of solid nanoparticles at oil-water interface.]]

A decrease in total free energy was observed to be a result from the assembly of nanoparticles at an oil/water (O/W) interface. This is shown in the following equation in which a particle with radius r at an interface between oil (O) and water (W) results in a decrease of the initial interfacial energy E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; this difference in energy is ΔE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;br /&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; {E_0-E_1}=-{\pi r^2\over\gamma_{O/W}} [\gamma_{O/W}-(\gamma_{P/W}-\gamma_{P/O})]^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

At a fixed γ&lt;sub&gt;P/O&lt;/sub&gt;, γ&lt;sub&gt;P/W&lt;/sub&gt;, and γ&lt;sub&gt;O/W&lt;/sub&gt;, the equation shows that the stability of a particle assembly is determined by the radius square. When moving to the interface, particles reduce the unfavorable contact between the immiscible fluids and decrease the interfacial energy. The decrease in total free energy for microscopic particles is much larger than that of thermal energy; this results in an effective confinement of large colloids to the interface. They are irreversibly bound to the interface. Nanoscopic particles are restricted to the interface by an energy reduction comparable to thermal energy. Thus, nanoparticles are easily displaced from the interface. A constant particle exchange then occurs at the interface; the rate of this exchange depends on particle size. The thermally activated escape of small particles occurs more often than larger particles.&lt;ref name="Liquid Interface" /&gt; For the equilibrium state of assembly, the total gain in free energy is smaller for smaller particles. Thus, large nanoparticles assemblies are more stable. This size dependence allows nanoparticles to self-assemble at the interface to attain its equilibrium structure. Micrometer- size colloids, on the other hand, may be confined in a non-equilibrium state.

The interfacial tension and the wettability of a particle surface affect the desorption energy. The contact angle θ between the solid and the oil/water interface determines its wettability. As shown in the figure below, a contact angle θ greater than 90° favors a water-in-oil emersion while a contact angle θ less than 90° favors oil-in-water emulsion. These contact angles affect the stability of the emulsion.
 
[[File:Surface Chem Contact Angle 2.jpg|thumb|Effects of contact angle on wettability.]]

A maximum desorption energy peak is observed at a contact angle of 90°. When the contact angle is greater than or less than this point, the desorption energy gradually decreases; thus, the stability of the emulsion decreases as well.

==Applications==
Material that consists with nano-particles is called "nanostructured material". The phase of "nanostructured material" implies two important ideas:
# that at least some of the heterogeneity in materials is determined by the size range of nanostructures (about 1–100&amp;nbsp;nm), and
# these nanostructures might be synthesized and distributed (or organized), at least in part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitesides|first= G.M.|author2=Kriebel, J.K. |author3=Mayers, B.T. |title=Nanoscale Assembly – Chemical Techniques|publisher=Springer |chapter=Self-Assembly and Nanostructured Materials |chapterurl=http://gmwgroup.harvard.edu/pubs/pdf/936.pdf|year=2005|doi=10.1007/b106927 |isbn=978-0-387-23608-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study of self-assembly nanoparticles is important to understand the interaction between single particle in terms of applying them into different applications.

===Electronics===
[[File:Model of multidimensional array of nano-particles.tiff|thumb|Model of multidimensional array of nano-particles. A particle could have two spins, spin up or down. Based on the spin directions, nano-particles will be able to store 0 and 1. Therefore, nanostructural material has a great potential for future use in electronic devices.]]
Self-assembly of nanoscale structures from functional nanoparticles has provided a powerful path to developing small and powerful electronic components.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} The difficulty of applied nanostructure material is nanoscale objects have always been difficult to manipulate because they cannot be characterized by molecular techniques and they are too small to observe optically. 2D self-assembly monodisperse particle colloids has a strong potential in dense magnetic storage media. Each colloid particle has the ability to store information as known as binary number 0 and 1 after applying it to a strong magnetic field. In the meantime, it requires a nanoscale sensor or detector in order to selectively choose the colloid particle.

"They were already dead, just their bodies were flopping wherever it can flop but their minds were already dead! The state took their minds. Once they started receiving their monthly checks".

===The sixth awards===
The topics of the sixth term, 2009-2010 were selected to be for Grand Hamdan International Award - Diabetes Mellitus, and for Hamdan Award for Medical Research Excellence - Obesity, Osteoporosis, Thyroid Disease. Many questions about development of diabetes and its complications remain unanswered. For example, not all individuals are equally susceptible to diabetes or its complications. Differences in the genetic make-up of people, and perhaps differences in early-life conditions, must account for this. Finding genes or other markers associated with the development of diabetes and its complications potentially offers avenues for improved screening, diagnostics, and therapeutics.

In parallel, a wave of emigration to the Americas began, with over 1.86 million Spaniards ("la emigracion espanola a America) emigrating to the Spanish Americas during the colonial period (1492-1824) and the  population of the Spanish Empire had risen to 16.8 million by the end of the 18th century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lvvynCzrJOwC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=emigraci%C3%B3n%20espa%C3%B1ola%20a%20las%20indias%20cifras#v=onepage&amp;q=emigraci%C3%B3n%20espa%C3%B1ola%20a%20las%20indias%20cifras&amp;f=false|title=La emigración española a América, 1765-1824|first=Rosario Márquez|last=Macías|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Universidad de Oviedo|via=Google Books|isbn=9788474688566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-colonial period (1850–1950), a further 3.5 million Spanish left for [[the Americas]], particularly [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Mexico]],&lt;ref name="Patricia Rivas"&gt;{{cite web |author=Patricia Rivas |url=http://www.radiomundial.com.ve/yvke/noticia.php?16783 |title=Reconocerán nacionalidad española a descendientes de exiliados :: YVKE Mundial |publisher=Radiomundial.com.ve |accessdate=10 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105210817/http://www.radiomundial.com.ve/yvke/noticia.php?16783 |archivedate=5 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Venezuela]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name=Diaspora/&gt; As a result, the inhabitants of Latin America (including Brasil) who have Spanish ancestors, all of in part, number a very high percentage the region's population of 600 million.   

Spain is home to one of the largest communities of [[Romani people]] (commonly known by the English [[exonym]] "gypsies", Spanish: ''gitanos''). The Spanish Roma, which belong to the Iberian Kale subgroup (''calé''), are a formerly-nomadic community, which spread across Western Asia, North Africa, and Europe, first reaching Spain in the 15th century. The population of Spain is becoming increasingly diverse due to recent immigration. From 2000 to 2010, Spain had among the highest per capita immigration rates in the world and the second highest absolute net migration in the World (after the [[United States]])&lt;ref name="epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-NK-06-001/EN/KS-NK-06-001-EN.PDF |title=Eurostat – Population in Europe in 2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=24 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819191607/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-NK-06-001/EN/KS-NK-06-001-EN.PDF |archivedate=19 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and immigrants now make up about 10% of the population. Nevertheless, the prolonged economic crisis between 2008 and 2015 significantly reduced both immigration rates and the total number of foreigners in the country, Spain becoming once more a net emigrant country.

The earliest modern humans inhabiting Spain are believed to have been Neolithic peoples who may have arrived in the Iberian Peninsula as early as 35,000–40,000 years ago. In more recent times the [[Iberians]] are believed to have arrived or developed in the region between the [[4th millennium BC]] and the 3rd millennium BC, initially settling along the Mediterranean coast.
[[Celts]] settled in Spain during the [[Iron Age Europe|Iron Age]]. Some of those tribes in North-central Spain, which had cultural contact with the Iberians, are called [[Celtiberians]]. In addition, a group known as the [[Tartessos|Tartessians]] and later [[Turdetani]]ans inhabited southwestern Spain and who are believed to have developed a separate civilization of [[Phoenicia]]n influence. The seafaring Phoenicians, [[Greeks]], and [[Carthaginian Republic|Carthaginians]] successively founded trading colonies along the Mediterranean coast over a period of several centuries. The [[Second Punic War]] between the Carthaginians and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] was fought mainly in what is now Spain and [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arqueotavira.com/Mapas/Iberia/Populi.htm |title=Ethnographic map of Pre-Roman Iberia |accessdate=25 April 2007 |website=Luís Fraga da Silva – Associação Campo Arqueológico de Tavira, Tavira, Portugal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040611215344/http://www.arqueotavira.com/Mapas/Iberia/Populi.htm |archivedate=11 June 2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Republic]] conquered Iberia during the 2nd and 1st centuries BC transformed most of the region into a series of [[Latin]]-speaking provinces. As a result of [[Campaign history of the Roman military#Conquest of the Iberian peninsula (218-19 BC)|Roman colonization]], the majority of local languages, with the exception of [[Basque language|Basque]], stem from the [[Vulgar Latin]] that was spoken in [[Hispania]] (Roman Iberia), which evolved into the [[languages of Iberia|modern languages of the Iberian Peninsula]], including ''Castilian'', which became the main ''lingua franca'' of Spain, and is now known in most countries as Spanish. Hispania emerged as an important part of the [[Roman Empire]] and produced notable historical figures such as [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Quintilian]].

The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Vandals]] and [[Suebi]], with part of the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Alans]] under King [[Respendial]], arrived in the peninsula in 409 AD. Part of the Vandals with the remaining Alans, now under [[Geiseric]] in [[personal union]] removed themselves to North Africa after a few conflicts with another Germanic tribe, the [[Visigoths#Visigothic Kingdom in Iberia|Visigoths]], who established in [[Toulouse]] supported Roman campaigns against the Vandals and Alans in 415–19 AD and became the dominant power in Iberia for three centuries. The Visigoths were highly [[Romanization (cultural)|romanized]] in the eastern Empire and already Christians, so their integration within the late Iberian-Roman culture was full; they accepted the laws and structures of the late Roman World with little change, more than any other successor barbarian state in the West after the [[Ostrogoths]], and all the more so after converting away from [[Arianism]].{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} The other Germanic tribe remaining in the peninsula, the [[Suebi]] (including the [[Buri (Germanic tribe)|Buri]]), became established according to sources as ''federates'' of the Roman Empire in the old North western Roman province of [[Gallaecia]], but in fact largely independent and predatory on neighboring provinces to stretch their political control over ever-larger portions of the southwest after the Vandals and Alans left, creating a totally independent [[Suebic Kingdom of Galicia|Suebic Kingdom]]. After being checked and reduced in 456 AD by the Visigoths moving to settle in the peninsula, it survived until 585 AD, when it was annihilated as an independent political unit by the [[Visigoths]], after involvement in the internal affairs of the kingdom, supporting Catholic rebellions and sedition [[Hermenegild|within the Royal family]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. The [[Suebi]] became the first Germanic kingdom to convert officially to Roman Catholicism in 447 AD. under king [[Rechiar]].

===Middle Ages===
After two centuries of domination by the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|invaded by a Muslim force]] under Tariq Bin Ziyad in 711. This army consisted mainly ethnic [[Berbers]] from the Ghomara tribe, which were reinforced by [[Arabs]] from Syria once the conquest was complete. The Visigothic Kingdom which to that point controlled the entire peninsula totally collapsed and the entire peninsula was conquered except for a remote mountainous area in the far north which would eventually become the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. Muslim Iberia became part of the Umayyad Caliphate and would be known as  [[Al-Andalus]]. The Berbers of Al Andalus revolted as early as 740 AD, halting Arab expansion across the Pyrenees into France. Upon the collapse of the [[Umayyad]] in Damascus, Spain was seized by Yusuf al Fihri, until the arrival of exiled Umayyad Prince Abd al-Rahman I, who seized power, establishing himself as Emir of Cordoba. Abd al Rahman III, his grandson, proclaimed a Caliphate in 929, marking the beginning of the Golden Age of Al Andalus, a polity which was the effective power of the peninsula and even Western North Africa, competing with the Shiite rulers of Tunis and constantly raiding the small Christian Kingdoms in the North.

The [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] effectively collapsed during a ruinous civil war between 1009 and 1013, although it was not finally abolished until 1031 when al-Andalus broke up into a number of mostly independent mini-states and principalities called [[taifas]]. These were generally too weak to defend themselves against repeated raids and demands for tribute from the Christian states to the north and west, which were known to the Muslims as "the Galician nations",[16] and which had spread from their initial strongholds in Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque country, and the Carolingian Marca Hispanica to become the Kingdoms of Navarre, León, Portugal, Castile and Aragon, and the County of Barcelona. Eventually raids turned into conquests, and in response the Taifa kings were forced to request help from the Almoravids, Muslim Berber rulers of the Maghreb. Their desperate maneuver would eventually fall to their disadvantage, however, as the [[Almoravids]] they had summoned from the south went on to conquer and annex all the Taifa kingdoms.

In 1086 the Almoravid ruler of Morocco, Yusuf ibn Tashfin, was invited by the Muslim princes in Iberia to defend them against Alfonso VI, King of Castile and León. In that year, Tashfin crossed the straits to Algeciras and inflicted a severe defeat on the Christians at the Battle of Sagrajas. By 1094, Yusuf ibn Tashfin had removed all Muslim princes in Iberia and had annexed their states, except for the one at Zaragoza. He also regained Valencia from the Christians.  About this time a massive process of conversion to Islam took place, Muslims comprising the majority of the population Spain the 11th century.  The Almoravids were succeeded by the Almohads, another Berber dynasty, after the victory of Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur over the Castilian Alfonso VIII at the Battle of Alarcos in 1195. In 1212 a coalition of Christian kings under the leadership of the Castilian Alfonso VIII defeated the Almohads at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. The Almohads continued to rule Al-Andalus for another decade, though with much reduced power and prestige. The civil wars following the death of Abu Ya'qub Yusuf II rapidly led to the re-establishment of taifas. The taifas, newly independent but now weakened, were quickly conquered by Portugal, Castile, and Aragon. After the fall of Murcia (1243) and the Algarve (1249), only the [[Emirate of Granada]] survived as a Muslim state, and only as a tributary of Castile until 1492.

In 1469 the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile signaled the launch of the final assault on the Emirate of Granada. The King and Queen convinced the Pope to declare their war a crusade. The Christians crushed one center of resistance after another and finally, in January 1492, after a long siege, the Moorish sultan Muhammad XII surrendered the fortress palace, the renowned [[Alhambra]].

The [[Canary Islands]] were conquered between 1402 and 1496 and their indigenous Berber populations, the [[Guanches]], were gradually absorbed by Spanish settlers.

Spanish conquest of the Iberian part of Navarre was commenced by Ferdinand II of Aragon and completed by Charles V in a series of military campaigns extending from 1512 to 1524, while the war lasted until 1528 in the Navarre to the north of the Pyrenees. Between 1568-1571, Charles V armies fought and defeated a general insurrection of the Muslims of the mountains of Granada, after which he ordered the dispersal of up to 80,000 Granadans throughout Spain.

The union of the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon as well as the conquest of [[Granada]], Navarre and the Canary Islands led to the formation of the Spanish state as known today. This allowed for the development of a Spanish identity based on the Spanish language and a local form of Catholicism, which slowly took hold in a territory which remained culturally, linguistically and religiously very diverse.

A majority of Jews were forcibly [[Converso|converted to Catholicism]] during the 14th and 15th centuries and those remaining were expelled from Spain in 1492. The open practice of Islam was by Spain's sizeable [[Mudejar]] population was similarly outlawed. Furthermore, between 1609 and 1614, a significant number of [[Morisco]]s— (Muslims who had been baptized Catholic) were [[expulsion of the Moriscos|expelled]] by royal decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/392401/Morisco |title=Morisco – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initial estimates of the number of Moriscos expelled such as those of Henri Lapeyre reach 300,000 moriscos (or 4% of the total Spanish population), the extent and severity of the expulsion has been increasingly challenged by modern historians. Nevertheless, the eastern region of Valencia, where ethnic tensions were highest, was particularly affected by the expulsion, suffering economic collapse and depopulation of much of its territory.

===Colonialism and emigration===

==Peoples of Spain==

===Nationalisms and regionalisms===
{{Main article|Nationalisms and regionalisms of Spain|Nationalities and regions of Spain}}
Within Spain, there are various regional populations including the [[Andalusian people|Andalusians]], [[Castilian people|Castilians]], the [[Catalan people|Catalans]], [[Valencian people|Valencians]] and [[Balearic people|Balearics]] (who speak [[Catalan language|Catalan]], a distinct Romance language in eastern Spain), the [[Basque people|Basques]] (who live in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque country]] and north of [[Navarre]] and speak [[Basque language|Basque]], a non-Indo-European language), and the [[Galician people|Galicians]] (who speak [[Galician language|Galician]], a descendant of old [[Galician-Portuguese]]).

Respect to the existing [[cultural pluralism]] is important to many Spaniards. In many regions there exist strong regional identities such as [[Asturias]], [[Aragon]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[León (historical region)|León]], and [[Andalusia]], while in others (like [[Catalonia]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] or [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]) there are stronger [[nationalism|national sentiments]]. Some of them refuse to identify themselves with the Spanish ethnic group and prefer some of the following:

===Gitanos===
{{Main article|Romani people in Spain}}
Spain is home to one of the largest communities of [[Romani people]] (commonly known by the English [[exonym]] "gypsies", Spanish: ''gitanos''). The Spanish Roma, which belong to the Iberian Kale subgroup (''[[Romani_people#Romani_subgroups|calé]]''), are a formerly-nomadic community, which spread across Western Asia, North Africa, and Europe, first reaching Spain in the 15th century.

[[File:Robert Kemm Granadinos.jpg|thumb|Gypsies of [[Granada]]]]

Data on ethnicity is not collected in Spain, although the Government's statistical agency CIS estimated in 2007 that the number of Gitanos present in Spain is probably around one million.&lt;ref name="Diagnostico Social de la Comunidad Gitana en Espana - CIS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msc.es/ssi/familiasInfancia/inclusionSocial/poblacionGitana/docs/diagnosticosocial_autores.pdf |title=Diagnóstico social de la comunidad gitana en España|date=2007 |website=msc.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Spanish Roma live in the autonomous community of Andalusia, where they have traditionally enjoyed a higher degree of integration than in the rest of the country. A number of Spanish Calé also live in Southern France, especially in the region of [[Perpignan]].

===Modern immigration===
{{Main article|Immigration to Spain}}
The population of Spain is becoming increasingly diverse due to recent immigration. From 2000 to 2010, Spain had among the highest per capita immigration rates in the world and the second highest absolute net migration in the World (after the [[United States]])&lt;ref name="epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu"/&gt; and immigrants now make up about 10% of the population. Since 2000, Spain has absorbed more than 3 million immigrants, with thousands more arriving each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_21/b4035066.htm |title=Spain: Immigrants Welcome |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=20 May 2007 |accessdate=24 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006223656/https://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_21/b4035066.htm |archivedate=6 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrant population now tops over 4.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.es/prodyser/pubweb/anuario06/anu06_02demog.pdf |title=National Institute of Statistics: Advance Municipal Register to January 1, 2006. provisional data |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=24 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726044741/http://www.ine.es/prodyser/pubweb/anuario06/anu06_02demog.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They come mainly from [[Europe]], [[Latin America]], [[China]], the [[Philippines]], [[North Africa]], and [[West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/spain/article/0,,1830838,00.html

{{Main article|Languages of Spain}}
Languages spoken in Spain include [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (''castellano'' or ''español'') (74%), [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (''català'', called ''[[Valencian|valencià]]'' in the [[Valencian Community]]) (17%), [[Galician language|Galician]] (''galego'') (7%), and [[Basque language|Basque]] (''euskara'') (2%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sp.html#People |title=CIA – The World Factbook – Spain |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other languages are [[Asturian language|Asturian]] (''asturianu''), [[Aranese language|Aranese Gascon]] (''aranés''), [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] (''aragonés''), and [[Leonese language|Leonese]], each with their own various dialects. Spanish is the official state language, although the other languages are co-official in a number of autonomous communities.

Peninsular Spanish is largely considered to be divided into two main dialects: Castilian Spanish (spoken in the northern half of the country) and Andalusian Spanish (spoken mainly in Andalusia). However, a large part of Spain, including Madrid, Extremadura, Murcia, and Castile–La Mancha, speak local dialects known as "transitional dialects" between Andalusian and Castilian Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.proel.org/lenguas.html |title=Lenguas de España |accessdate=25 April 2007 |website=Proel.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canary Islands also have a distinct dialect of Castilian Spanish which is very close to [[Caribbean Spanish]]. Linguistically, the Spanish language is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] and is one of the aspects (including laws and general "ways of life") that causes Spaniards to be labelled a [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin people]]. The strong [[Arabic influence on the Spanish language|Arabic influence on the language]] (nearly 4,000 words are of Arabic origin, including nouns, verbs and adjectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/ling450ch/reports/spanish.html "The History of the Spanish Language"] - The importance of this influence can be seen in words such as admiral (almirante), algebra, alchemy and alcohol, to note just a few obvious examples, which entered other European languages, like French, English, German, from Arabic via medieval Spanish. Modern Spanish has [http://anthro.palomar.edu/language/language_1.htm &lt;!--"Language and Culture: Introduction"--&gt; around 100,000 words].&lt;/ref&gt;) and the independent evolution of the language itself through history, most notably the Basque influence at the formative stage of Castilian Romance, partially explain its difference from other Romance languages. The Basque language left a strong imprint on Spanish both linguistically and phonetically. Other changes in Spanish have come from borrowings from English and French, although English influence is stronger in Latin America than in Spain.

The number of speakers of [[Names given to the Spanish language|Spanish]] as a mother tongue is roughly 35.6 million, while the vast majority of other groups in Spain such as the [[Galician people|Galicians]], [[Catalan people|Catalans]], and [[Basque people|Basques]] also speak Spanish as a first or second language, which boosts the number of Spanish speakers to the overwhelming majority of Spain's population of 46 million.

Spanish was exported to the Americas due to over three centuries of Spanish colonial rule starting with the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] to [[Santo Domingo]] in 1492. Spanish is spoken natively by over 400 million people and spans across most countries of the Americas; from the Southwestern United States in North America down to [[Tierra del Fuego]], the southernmost region of South America in [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. A variety of the language, known as [[Judaeo-Spanish]] or Ladino (or [[Haketia]] in Morocco), is still spoken by descendants of Sephardim (Spanish and Portuguese Jews) who fled Spain following a [[Alhambra Decree|decree of expulsion of practising Jews]] in 1492. Also, a Spanish [[creole language]] known as [[Chabacano language|Chabacano]], which developed by the mixing of Spanish and native [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[Cebuano language]]s during Spain's rule of the country through [[Mexico]] from 1565 to 1898, is spoken in the [[Philippines]] (by roughly 1 million people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/cbk | title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World | publisher=SIL International | date=2016 | accessdate=26 January 2017 | editor-last=Fennig|editor-first=Charles D. | place =Dallas, Texas |edition=Nineteenth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Religion in Spain}}
[[Roman Catholicism in Spain|Roman Catholicism]] is by far the largest denomination present in [[Spain]]. According to a study by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research in 2013 about 71% of Spaniards self-identify as [[Catholics]], 2% other faith, and about 25% identify as atheists or declare they have [[irreligion in Spain|no religion]].

==Emigration from Spain==
{{main article|Spanish diaspora}}

Outside of Europe, Latin America has the largest population of people with ancestors from Spain. These include people of [[Criollo people|full]] or [[Mestizo|partial]] Spanish ancestry.

'''Tenoch''' (or '''Tenuch''', {{audio|Tenoch.ogg|modern Nahuatl pronunciation}}) was a ruler of the [[Mexica]]s (Aztecas) during the fourteenth century during the Aztec travels from [[Aztlán]] to [[Tenochtitlan]]. Tenoch's father was Iztacmixcoatl, who had a total of seven sons with two wives. The Tenochtitlan people were originally referred to as Tenochca, then the Mexica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chimalpahin's Conquest : A Nahua Historian's Rewriting of Francisco lo´pez de Go´mara's la Conquista de Me´xico|last=de San Antón Muñón Chimalpahin Cuauhtlehuanitzin 1579-1660.|first=Domingo Francisco|last2=Schroeder|first2=Susan|last3=de Gómara 1511-1564.|first3=Francisco López|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=Stanford, Calif.|pages=444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a respected chief who was elected to power by the council of elders and died in 1375. There is disagreement whether Tenoch is a mythological person or a real Mexica leader who was later mythologized. Tenoch was one of nine Mexica leaders who were told how Mexica could gain support from the forces of nature.

After traveling southward for a span of 200 years, the Mexica found the sign. In honor of their leader, they named the small, reedy island in Lake Texcoco, Tenochtitlan. Tenochtitlan soon became the capital of the Aztec Empire.

The [[Nahuatl]] [[symbol]]s of his name are found in the [[Mexican flag]]: ''Tetl'', the rock, and ''Nochtli'', the prickly pear cactus.

'''''The Sirian Experiments''''' is a 1980 science fiction novel by [[Doris Lessing]]. It is the third book in her five-book ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorislessing.org/canopusin.html |title=Canopus in Argos: Archives |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues the story of [[Earth]]'s [[evolution]], which has been manipulated from the beginning by advanced [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial civilisation]]s.&lt;ref name=BooksOfTheTimes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E5DE143BF930A25752C0A967948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Books of the Times: The Sirian Experiments |first=John |last=Leonard |authorlink=John Leonard (American critic) |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=13 January 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in the United States in December 1980 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], and in the United Kingdom in March 1981 by [[Jonathan Cape]]. The book was shortlisted for the [[List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://themanbookerprize.com/fiction/1981 |title=The Man Booker Prize 1981 |work=[[Booker Prize]] |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Sirian Experiments'' relates directly to the first book in this series, ''[[Shikasta]]'', which is the history of the planet Shikasta (an allegorical Earth) under the influence of three galactic empires, [[Canopus]], [[Sirius]] and their mutual enemy, Puttiora. ''Shikasta'' is told from the Canopean viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorislessing.org/shikastaby.html |title=Shikasta |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sirian Experiments'' (subtitled ''The Report by Ambien II, of the Five'') tells the story of Shikasta from the Sirian point of view and describes the activities of Sirians on the planet and the strained relations of Sirius with Canopus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorislessing.org/theexperiments.html |title=The Sirian Experiments |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessing stated in an [[afterword]] in the [[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8|next book]] in this series that ''The Sirian Experiments'' and ''[[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8]]'' were inspired by her 50-year fascination with the ill-fated [[Terra Nova Expedition|1910–13 Antarctic expedition]] of [[Robert Falcon Scott]].{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc="Afterword", p. 162}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E3DD1F38F93AA15752C0A964948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Books of the Times: The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 |first=Christopher |last=Lehmann-Haupt |authorlink=Christopher Lehmann-Haupt |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=29 January 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre and reception==
Because of its focus on characterisation and social/cultural issues, and the de-emphasis of technological details, ''The Sirian Experiments'' is not strictly science fiction but [[soft science fiction]], or "space fiction" as Lessing calls her ''Canopus in Argos'' series.{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc="Some Remarks", p. 8}} Robert Alter of ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that this kind of writing belongs to a genre [[literary critic]] [[Northrop Frye]] called the "anatomy", which is "a combination of fantasy and morality" and that "presents us with a vision of the world in terms of a single intellectual pattern."&lt;ref name=NYTreview&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E3D8173BF932A25752C0A967948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Doris Lessing in the Visionary Mode |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Robert |last=Alter |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=11 January 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessing has stated that she has used this series as a vehicle to "put questions, both to myself and to others" and to "explore ideas and sociological possibilities."{{sfn|Lessing|1994b|loc="Preface", p. 11}}

While Lessing's switch to "science fiction" in the late 1970s was not well received by all,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mural.uv.es/vemivein/feminismcommunism.htm |title=Doris Lessing on Feminism, Communism and 'Space Fiction' |work=[[University of Valencia]] Press |first=Lesley |last=Hazelton |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the series in general has drawn positive criticism. Two reviews of ''The Sirian Experiments'' in ''The New York Times'' said that Lessing achieves "… a largeness of vision beyond the horizon of the conventional novel."&lt;ref name=NYTreview/&gt; and that it has "… some playful moments and some splendid ones. It is interesting, however, primarily because Doris Lessing wrote it."&lt;ref name=BooksOfTheTimes/&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' on the other hand, which had spoken highly of the first two books in this series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947537,00.html |title=Visit to a Small Planet |first=Paul |last=Gray |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=22 October 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924037,00.html |title=Soul Mates |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first=Paul |last=Gray |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=21 April 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; felt that this one "may be a small misstep on a long journey."&lt;ref name=TIMEreview&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949106,00.html |title=More Lessing |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first=Paul |last=Gray |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=23 February 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The Sirian Empire, centred in the [[Sirius]] star system, has advanced technology that made their citizens effectively immortal (barring accidents) and sophisticated machines that did almost everything for them. But this technology came at a price: many Sirians became afflicted with "the existentials", a debilitating malady that left them feeling worthless and with no reason to exist. To overcome this problem and give its people "something to do", Sirius embarked on a conquest of space and [[Colonisation|colonised]] many planets. But they also encroached on territory of the superior Canopean Empire that led to a costly war, which [[Canopus]] won. As a gesture of reconciliation, Canopus returned all the captured Sirian territory and invited Sirius to jointly colonise a new and promising planet called Rohanda (an allegorical [[Earth]]). Canopus took the northern continents and gave Sirius the southern continents.

Ambien II, one of the Five who run the Sirian Colonial Service and also govern the Sirian Empire, represents Sirius on Rohanda. She sets in motion a series of [[biology|bio]]-[[Sociology|sociological]] and [[Genetics|genetic]] experiments where large numbers of primitive [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] from Sirian colonised planets are space-lifted to Rohanda and adapted there for work elsewhere in the Empire. In the north, Canopus nurtures Rohanda's bourgeoning [[humanoid]]s and accelerates their [[evolution]]. They also put a Lock on the planet that links it to the harmony and strength of the Canopean Empire. Canopus keeps Ambien II updated with reports of all their work, but she is suspicious of Sirius's former enemy, seeing them as a competitor rather than a partner, and is unable to correctly interpret them.

Then an unforeseen "cosmic re-alignment" breaks the Lock and Shammat of the malicious Puttiora Empire begins exploiting the situation by corrupting Rohanda's Natives. Canopus, seeing Rohanda decline, renames the planet [[Shikasta]] (the stricken). Sirius, unconcerned about Canopus's troubles in the north, continue to refer to the planet as Rohanda.

In an attempt to foster better relations with Sirius, Klorathy, a senior Canopean Colonial administrator, invites Ambien II to observe events in their territory. Ambien II, eager to learn more about Canopus, agrees. As Rohanda evolves and civilisations come and go, Ambien II and Klorathy meet several times to watch Rohanda's degeneration. Canopus does what it can to help communities, but with Shammat's evil and a broken Lock, they make little progress. From time to time Klorathy requests Ambien II's help and while working on the planet, she meets Nasar, another Canopean official. She also encounters Tafta, the Shammat commander on Rohanda, and at one point nearly succumbs to his corruption.

Ambien II eventually abandons the Sirian Experiments in the south when they are overrun by Shammat. The Five want her to abandon Rohanda altogether, but she has become too attached to the planet and is warming to Canopus and seeing the error of her (and Sirius's) ways. The Five question her ties to their former enemy, but when she tries to explain herself, they do not hear what she is saying, just as she initially could not hear what Canopus was saying. The Five then send her to Planet 13 on "corrective exile" to write a report on what has happened (this book). When she later releases the report, the Five issues a statement denying the authenticity of Ambien II's work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2830">''The Three Amigos'' is a series of 20 [[public service announcements]] (PSA) using three animated [[condoms]] to promote the use of [[safe sex]] as protection from contacting the [[HIV/AIDS]] virus. First shown at [http://www.iasociety.org/Default.aspx?pageId=11&amp;abstractId=2172132 Bangkok's XV International AIDS Conference in 2004], the series was officially launched at the [https://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2005/HIV_AIDSbrf050111.doc.htm United Nations in 2005] in six languages. By 2012 it had been broadcast or used by [[NGOs]], educational institutions, hospitals and others in 150 countries in 45 languages.

The series was co-created by Chocolate Moose Media's [[Firdaus Kharas]] and South African writer [http://www.linkedin.com/pub/brent-quinn/4/255/48a Brent Quinn]. Episodes approach the subject with humor and are shown in 15-, 20-, 30- and 60-second animated spots. The hand-drawn animation series contains 14,000 drawings and was produced completely by volunteers in four countries.  ''The Three Amigos'' campaign won a [[Peabody Award]] in 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-three-amigos-hiv-aids-prevention-programme 66th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as 29 other international awards, and has been the subject of numerous articles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[The New Yorker]] |title=Pitching Rubbers |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/05/24/040524ta_talk_mcgrath |date=May 24, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[academic writing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=von Flotow |first=Luise |title=The (Globalized) Three Amigos |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/ttr/2005/v18/n2/015770ar.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Distribution to all users throughout the world is free.

'''Thunder Collins''' (born September 17, 1979) is a former [[running back]] for the [[Montreal Alouettes]] after playing 3 seasons at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  He played one game for the [[Montreal Alouettes]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://huskerextra.com/articles/2009/11/13/football/doc4afc80d43a865546388110.txt Thunder Collins sentenced to life in prison].

'''Ukrainian Canadians''' ({{lang-uk|Українські канадці, Україноканадці|translit=Ukrayins'ki kanadtsi, Ukrayinokanadtsi}}; {{lang-fr|Canadiens d'origine ukrainienne}}) are [[Canadians|Canadian citizens]] of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] descent or [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]]-born people who immigrated to [[Canada]]. In 2016, there were an estimated 1,359,655 persons of full or partial Ukrainian origin residing in Canada (the majority being Canadian-born citizens), making them [[Ethnic origins of people in Canada|Canada's eleventh largest ethnic group]]&lt;ref name="StatsCan"/&gt; and giving Canada the world's third-largest Ukrainian population behind [[Ukraine]] itself and [[Russia]]. Self-identified Ukrainians are the plurality in several rural areas of [[Canadian Prairies|Western Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/prof/92-591/index.cfm?Lang=E 2006 Census Community Profiles], see for example [[Division No. 12, Manitoba]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2011 census, of the 1,251,170 who identified as Ukrainian, only 144,260 (or 11.5%) could actually speak either the modern [[Ukrainian language]] or the historic [[Canadian Ukrainian]] dialect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=PR&amp;Code1=01&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=canada&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;A1=All&amp;B1=All&amp;Custom=&amp;TABID=1, National Household Survey Profile, Canada, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Unconfirmed settlement before 1891===
Minority opinions among historians of Ukrainians in Canada surround theories that a small number of Ukrainians settled in Canada before 1891. Most controversial is the claim that Ukrainians may have been [[infantry]]men alongside [[Polish Canadians|Poles]] in the [[Swiss French people|Swiss French]] "De Meurons" and "[[De Watteville's Regiment|De Watteville]]" regiments who fought for the [[George Prévost|British]] on the [[Niagara campaign|Niagara Peninsula]] during the [[War of 1812]] – it has been theorized that Ukrainians were among those soldiers who decided to stay in [[Upper Canada]] ([[southern Ontario]]).&lt;ref name="Swyripa-1862"&gt;Swyripa, "Ukrainians", p. 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Ukrainians supposedly arrived as part of other immigrant groups; it has been claimed that individual Ukrainian families may have settled in [[Manitoba#Confederation|southern Manitoba]] in the mid- to late 1870s alongside [[block settlement]]s of [[Russian Mennonite|Mennonites]] and other [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|Germans]] from the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Swyripa-1862"/&gt; "Galicians" are noted as being among the miners of the [[British Columbia gold rushes]] and figure prominently in some towns in that [[1871 in Canada#Events|new province]]'s first census in 1871 (these may have been Poles and [[Belarusians]] as well as Ukrainians).&lt;ref&gt;Canadian census, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; Because there is so little definitive documentary evidence of individual Ukrainians among these three groups, they are not generally regarded as among the first Ukrainians in Canada.

===Settlement – first wave (1891–1914)===
[[File:Stamp of Ukraine s12 (1).jpg|thumb|200px|Post-independence [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] fifteen-[[Ukrainian karbovanets|kopiyka]] stamp commemorating the centennial of Ukrainian settlement in Canada, 1891–1991]]

During the nineteenth century the territory inhabited by Ukrainians in Europe was divided between the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] empires. The [[Cisleithania|Austrian crownlands]] of [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Bukovina|Bukovyna]] were home to many Ukrainian speakers. Austrian Galicia was [[Poverty in Austrian Galicia|one of the poorest and most overpopulated regions in Europe]], and had experienced [[Famines in Austrian Galicia|a series of blights and famines]]. Emigration on a large scale from Galicia to the [[Balkans]] (the [[Slavonian Military Frontier|north-south border region]] between [[commons:File:Ukrainians in Croatia 2011.gif|Croatia]] and [[commons:File:Українці в Боснії і Герцеговині.JPG|Bosnia]]) and even to [[Ukrainian Brazilians|Brazil]] was already underway by 1891.

The first wave of Ukrainian immigration to Canada began with [[Iwan Pylypow|Iwan (''Ivan'') Pylypow]] and Wasyl (''Vasyl{{'}}'') Eleniak, who arrived in 1891, and brought several families to settle in 1892. Pylypow helped found the [[Edna-Star colony|Edna-Star Settlement]] east of [[Edmonton]], the first and largest Ukrainian [[block settlement]]. However, it is Dr. [[Joseph Oleskiw|Josef Oleskow]],{{refn|Dr. Oleskow, who had a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[agronomy]], wrote two [[pamphlet]]s – "About Free Lands" (''Pro Vilni Zemli'', spring 1895), and "On Emigration" (''O emigratsiy'', December 1895) – which were widely read in the [[Prosvita]] halls of the Ukrainian areas of the Austrian Empire.|name=Oleskow|group="N"}} along with [[Cyril Genik]], who are considered responsible for the large Ukrainian Canadian population through their promotion of Canada as a destination for immigrants from western (Austrian-ruled) Ukraine in the late 1890s. Ukrainians from [[Central Ukraine]], which was ruled by the [[Russian Empire|Russian monarchy]], also came to Canada&lt;ref name="Kukushkin-Luciuk-Kordan"&gt;Kukushkin, p. 30-54; Luciuk and Kordan 1989, map 3.&lt;/ref&gt; – but in smaller numbers than those from Galicia and Bukovyna. Approximately 170,000 Ukrainians from the Austro-Hungarian Empire arrived in Canada from September 1891 to August 1914.&lt;ref name="Isajiw-Makuch-Swyripa"&gt;Isajiw and Makuch, p. 333; Swyripa, "Ukrainians", p. 1862.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clifford Sifton]], Canada's [[Minister of the Interior (Canada)|Minister of the Interior]] from 1896 to 1905, also encouraged Ukrainians from Austria-Hungary to immigrate to Canada since he wanted new [[Farmer|agricultural immigrants]] to populate [[Canadian Prairies|Canada's prairies]]. After retirement, Sifton defended the new Ukrainian and East European immigrants to Canada – who were not from the United Kingdom, the United States, Scandinavia, Iceland, France or Germany – by stating: {{cquote|I think that a stalwart peasant in a [[Kozhushanka|sheepskin coat]], born to the soil, whose forefathers have been farmers for ten generations, with a stout wife and a half-dozen children, is good quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/CliffordSifton-CanadianHistory.htm |publisher=faculty.marianopolis.edu |title=The Quebec History Encyclopedia: Clifford Sifton |accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This Ukrainian immigration to Canada was largely [[Farmer|agrarian]], and at first Ukrainian Canadians concentrated in distinct block settlements in the [[parkland belt]] of the [[Canadian Prairies|prairie provinces]]: [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Manitoba]]. While the Canadian Prairies are often compared to the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe|steppes of Ukraine]], the settlers came largely from Galicia and Bukovyna – which are not steppe lands, but are [[forest steppe|semi-wooded areas]] in the [[Carpathian Foothills|foothills of the Carpathian Mountains]]. This is why Ukrainians coming to Canada settled in the wooded [[aspen parkland]]s – in an arch from [[Winnipeg]] and [[Stuartburn, Manitoba]] to [[Edmonton]] and [[Leduc, Alberta]] – rather than the open prairies further south. As well, the [[Manorialism|semi-feudal nature]] of land ownership in the Austrian Empire meant that in the "Old Country" people had to pay the ''pan'' (landlord) for all their firewood and lumber for building. Upon arriving in Canada, the settlers often demanded wooded land from [[Dominion Lands Act|officials]] so that they would be able to supply their own needs, even if this meant taking land that was less productive for crops. They also attached deep importance to settling near to family, people from nearby villages or other culturally similar groups, furthering the growth of the block settlements.

Fraternal and [[Friendly society|benevolent]] organizations established by these settlers include the [[Association of United Ukrainian Canadians|Ukrainian Labour Farmer Temple Association]] (ULFTA, affiliated with the [[Communist Party of Canada]]),&lt;ref name="Swyripa-Luciuk-Kordan-Isajiw-Makuch"&gt;Swyripa, "Ukrainians", p. 1862; Luciuk and Kordan 1989, map 18; Isajiw and Makuch, p. 346-47, 345.&lt;/ref&gt; the Ukrainian Catholic Brotherhood (UCB, affiliated with the [[Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Winnipeg|Ukrainian Catholic Church in Canada]]),&lt;ref name="Swyripa-Luciuk-Kordan-Isajiw-Makuch"/&gt; and the Ukrainian Self-Reliance League (USRL, affiliated with the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada]]).&lt;ref name="Swyripa-Luciuk-Kordan-Isajiw-Makuch"/&gt; The ULFTA transformed itself into the [[Association of United Ukrainian Canadians]] in 1946,&lt;ref&gt;Swyripa, "Ukrainians", p. 1863; Luciuk and Kordan 1989, map 18; Isajiw and Makuch, p. 346-47, 345.&lt;/ref&gt; the UCB and USRL are part of the [[Ukrainian Canadian Congress]] today.&lt;ref&gt;Swyripa, "Ukrainians", p. 1863; Luciuk and Kordan 1989, map 19; Isajiw and Makuch, p. 346-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1914, there were also growing communities of Ukrainian immigrants in eastern Canadian cities, such as [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], and [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]]. Many of them arrived from the provinces of [[Podolia#Russian Empire|Podillia]], [[Volhynia]], [[Kiev Governorate|Kyiv]] and [[Bessarabia#Population|Bessarabia]] in Russian-ruled Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Kukushkin-Luciuk-Kordan"/&gt; In the early years of settlement, Ukrainian immigrants faced considerable amounts of discrimination at the hands of non-[[Slavs|Slavic]], non-[[Southern Europe]]an Canadians, an example of which was the [[Ukrainian Canadian internment|internment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ukrainian Diaspora |author=Satzewich, V. |date=2004 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9780203217498 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=97gr-mzyWBsC&amp;pg=PP1 |accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Richer and Poorer: The Structure of Inequality in Canada |author1=Allahar, A. |author2=Côté, J.E. |date=1998 |publisher=James Lorimer Limited, Publishers |isbn=9781550286106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nlj5GaXXY3EC&amp;pg=PA70 |page=70 |accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ukraine: A History |last=Subtelny |first=Orest |date=2000 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9780802083906 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNIs9O3EmtQC&amp;pg=PA547 |page=547 |accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internment (1914–1920)===
{{Main|Ukrainian Canadian internment}}

From 1914 to 1920, the political climate of the [[World War I|First World War]] allowed the [[Government of Canada|Canadian Government]] to classify immigrants with [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] [[citizenship]] as "aliens of enemy nationality". This classification, authorized by the August 1914 ''[[War Measures Act]]'', permitted the government to legally compel thousands of Ukrainians in Canada to register with federal authorities. About 5,000 Ukrainian men, and some women and children, were [[Internment|interned]] at government camps and work sites. Although many Ukrainians were "[[Parole#Criminal justice|paroled]]" into jobs for private companies by 1917, the internment continued until June 20, 1920 – almost a year after the [[Treaty of Versailles]] was signed by Canada on June 28, 1919.

There are some two dozen Ukrainian-specific plaques and memorials in Canada commemorating Canada's first national internment operations, including several statues – on the fairgrounds of Canada's National Ukrainian Festival south of [[Dauphin, Manitoba|Dauphin]], [[Manitoba]], the grounds of the [[Manitoba Legislative Building]] in [[Winnipeg]]; and at the locations of the former internment camps in [[Castle Mountain Internment Camp|Banff National Park]], [[Alberta]], [[Trécesson, Quebec|Spirit Lake (La Ferme)]], [[Quebec]], and [[Kapuskasing#Internment camp|Kapuskasing]], [[Ontario]]. Most were placed by the [[Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association]] (UCCLA) and its supporters. On August 24, 2005, Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]] recognized the Ukrainian Canadian internment as a "dark chapter"&lt;ref name="Globe+Mail"&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20050825/UKRANIANS25/TPNational/TopStories PM Reaches out to Ukrainians] – The Globe and Mail, August 25, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; in [[History of Canada|Canadian history]], and pledged $2.5&amp;nbsp;million to fund memorials and educational exhibits&lt;ref name="Globe+Mail"/&gt; although that funding was never provided.

On May 9, 2008, following the 2005 passage of [[Inky Mark]]'s Bill C-331, the Government of Canada, under Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], established a $10&amp;nbsp;million fund&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internmentcanada.ca/about-the-fund.cfm| title=About the Fund |format=official website |publisher=The Canadian First World War Internment Recognition Fund and The Ukrainian Canadian Foundation of Taras Shevchenko |date=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; following several months of negotiation with the Ukrainian Canadian community's representatives, including the UCCLA, [[Ukrainian Canadian Congress]] and Ukrainian Canadian Foundation of Taras Shevchenko (also known as the Shevchenko Foundation), establishing the Canadian First World War Internment Recognition Fund (CFWWIRF). The Endowment Council of the CFWWIRF uses the interest earned on that amount to fund projects that commemorate the experience of Ukrainians and other Europeans interned between 1914 and 1920. The funds are held in trust by the Shevchenko Foundation. Amongst the commemorative projects funded by the Endowment Council was the unveiling, simultaneously across Canada, of 115 bilingual plaques on August 24, 2014, recalling the 100th anniversary of the first implementation of the ''War Measures Act''. This was known as Project "Сто" ({{small|[[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]]}} ''Sto''; meaning "one hundred"), and organized by the UCCLA.

===Settlers, workers and professionals – second wave (1923–1939)===
{{see also|Polonization#Second Polish Republic (1918–1939)}}

In 1923, the Canadian government modified the ''[[History of Canadian nationality law|Immigration Act]]'' to allow former subjects of the Austrian Empire to once again enter Canada – and Ukrainian immigration started anew.&lt;ref&gt;Swyripa, "Canada", p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; Ukrainians from western [[Volhynia]] – the [[Polesie Voivodeship|Polesie]] and [[Wołyń Voivodeship (1921–1939)|Wołyń Voivodeships]] (under Polish rule), and southern [[Bessarabia]] – also known as the [[Budjak]] (under Romanian rule), joined a new wave of emigrants from Polish-governed [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and Romanian-governed [[Bukovina#Kingdom of Romania|Bukovyna]]. Around 70,000 Ukrainians from [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] arrived in Canada from 1924 to September 1939,&lt;ref name="Isajiw-Makuch-Swyripa"/&gt; although the flow decreased severely after 1930 due to the [[Great Depression]].

Relatively little farmland remained unclaimed – the majority in the [[Peace River Country|Peace River region]] of northwestern Alberta – and less than half of this group settled as farmers in the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie provinces]].&lt;ref name="Isajiw-Makuch"&gt;Isajiw and Makuch, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority became workers in the growing industrial centers of [[southern Ontario]] and the [[Montreal]] region and the [[Eastern Townships]] of Quebec; the [[Underground mining (hard rock)|mines]], [[Smelting|smelters]] and [[Lumberjack|forests]] of [[northern Ontario]]; and the small heavy industries of urban [[western Canada]].&lt;ref name="Isajiw-Makuch"/&gt; A few Ukrainian professionals and intellectuals were accepted into Canada at this time; they later became leaders in the Ukrainian Canadian community.&lt;ref name="Isajiw-Makuch-Swyripa"/&gt;

The second wave was heavily influenced by the [[Ukrainian War of Independence|struggle for Ukrainian independence during the Russian Civil War]], and established two competing fraternal / [[Friendly society|benevolent]] organizations in Canada: the United Hetman Organization (UHO) in 1934&lt;ref&gt;Swyripa, "Ukrainians", p. 1862; Isajiw and Makuch, p. 346-47, 345.&lt;/ref&gt; – which supported the idea of a Ukrainian "[[Ukrainian State|Cossack kingdom]]" led by [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]];&lt;ref&gt;Swyripa, "Canada", p. 351; Luciuk and Kordan 1989, map 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and the rival [[Ukrainian National Federation of Canada|Ukrainian National Federation]] (UNF) in 1932&lt;ref&gt;Swyripa, "Ukrainians", p. 1862; Isajiw and Makuch, p. 346-48, 345; Luciuk and Kordan 1989, map 18.&lt;/ref&gt; – which supported the idea of an [[Ukrainian People's Republic|independent Ukrainian republic]] and politically supported the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|armed Ukrainian nationalist insurgency]] in Polish-occupied Western Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Swyripa, "Canada", p. 351-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swyripa-TCE-EOU"&gt;Swyripa, "Ukrainians", p. 1862–63; Swyripa, "Canada", p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; The UHO ceased to exist by 1960, while the UNF continued to expand and became the largest and most influential Ukrainian organization in Canada, spearheading the creation of the Ukrainian Canadian Committee (later [[Ukrainian Canadian Congress]]) during World War II.{{refn|The UCC was the driving force in organizing the World Congress of Free Ukrainians in the immediate postwar period; the WCFU would expand and be renamed the [[Ukrainian World Congress]] after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].|name=WorldCongress|group="N"}}

From [[World War II]] to 1991, most Ukrainians coming to Canada were political refugees and Displaced Persons who tended to move to cities in southern [[Ontario]], southern [[Quebec]] and the [[Lower Mainland]] of [[British Columbia]] – there are now large Ukrainian communities in [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]] and [[Vancouver]]. They established a number of new organizations and affiliated newspapers, women's and youth groups, the most prominent of which was the Canadian League for the Liberation of Ukraine (renamed the League of Ukrainian Canadians after [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the collapse of the USSR]] in 1991). The League joined the Ukrainian Canadian Committee (later [[Ukrainian Canadian Congress]]) in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Luciuk and Kordan 1989, map 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively few Ukrainians came to Canada during the Brezhnev and Gorbachev years, as exit visas could take several years to get approved.

===Post-independent Ukraine – fourth wave (1991–present)===
{{multiple issues|section=yes|
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}

After the dissolution of the USSR, emigration from Ukraine increased. Rising levels of corruption, the dismantlement of some social services, low-paying employment and loss of jobs in Ukraine, made immigration attractive once again.

==Culture==
{{See also|Ukrainian culture}}

Having been separated from Ukraine, Ukrainian Canadians have developed their own distinctive Ukrainian culture in Canada. To showcase their unique hybrid culture, Ukrainian Canadians have created institutions that showcase Ukrainian Canadian culture such as [[Edmonton]]'s [[Cheremosh Ukrainian Dance Company|Cheremosh]] and ''Shumka'' troupes – among the world's elite [[Ukrainian dance]]rs; or the [[Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Village]] – where Ukrainian [[Post-Confederation Canada (1867–1914)#Population of the West|pioneer buildings]] are displayed along with extensive cultural exhibits.

Ukrainian Canadians have also contributed to [[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]] as a whole. Actress and comedian [[Luba Goy]], singer Gloria Kaye,&lt;ref&gt;Czuboka, p. 211-212.&lt;/ref&gt; and painter [[William Kurelek]], for example, are well known outside the Ukrainian community.

Historically Ukrainian Canadians were among Canada's poorest and least educated minorities; but as the process of cultural integration has accelerated, this is no longer the case and Ukrainian Canadians are currently near the national economic average.

Perhaps one of the most lasting contributions Ukrainian Canadians have made to the wider culture of Canada is the concept of [[multiculturalism]] which was promoted as early as 1964 by [[Senate of Canada|Senator]] [[Paul Yuzyk]]. During and after the debates surrounding the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] Ukrainian leaders, such as linguist [[Jaroslav Rudnyckyj]], came out in force against the notion of [[Constitutional debate in Canada|English - French]] [[biculturalism]] which they believed denied the contributions other peoples had made to Canada. Partly in response to this, Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] shifted Canada to a policy of official multiculturalism.

=== Architecture ===
{{see also|Vernacular architecture of the Carpathians}}
The Western Ukrainian agricultural settlers brought with them a style of folk architecture dominated by buildings made of unprocessed logs, which were much better suited to the wooded [[aspen parkland|parkland belt]] rather than the "bald prairie". The first house built – usually a ''[[burdei]]'' – used some sod; but was not exactly a [[sod hut]], more like a [[dugout (shelter)|dugout]]. The second house was often a white-washed and plastered [[log cabin]] usually with thatched roof, very similar to those seen in Ukraine. Barns, chicken coops, [[granary|granaries]], and so on were all built using the same techniques as the houses. By the 1930s most Ukrainian Canadians adopted the building styles of the North American mainstream including [[framing (construction)|framed homes and barns]] built from commercial plans and using milled lumber.

Early churches, built by pioneer farmers rather than trained builders, were basically log cabins with a few added decorations. They aspired to the designs of [[wooden churches in Ukraine|Ukraine's wooden churches]], but were much more humble. Latter churches – such as the "prairie cathedral" style of Father [[Philip Ruh]], using a mixture of Byzantine and Western influences – were much more decorative.

===Language===
{{see also|Ukrainian language}}
{{further|Canadian Ukrainian}}
[[File:Ukrainian Sign Hafford Saskatchewan 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Ukrainian language street signs alongside English ones in [[Hafford]], [[Saskatchewan]]]]

In addition to the official [[Canadian English|English]] and [[Quebec French|French]] languages, many [[Canadian Prairies|prairie]] public schools offer [[Ukrainian language]] education for children, including immersion programs. Generally second language students are taught the local [[Canadian Ukrainian]] dialect, rather than Standard Ukrainian.

The Canadian Ukrainian dialect is based on the Ukrainian spoken by the first wave of immigrants from the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] from 1891 to 1914. Because the Ukrainian language of this era had no words for such things as [[agricultural machinery]] other than a plow, words for wildlife or vegetation common to North America and uncommon in Ukraine, words related to the [[Car|automobile]] or other self-propelled vehicles on roads, or words for [[internal combustion engine]]-powered or [[Electric motor|electrically]]-powered [[Power tool|tools]] or [[home appliance]]s of any kind, extensive borrowings and adaptations from [[Canadian English]] were independently made by Ukrainian settlers in the [[block settlement]]s of the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]] during their first decades in Canada. The decline of regular communication with relatives in Ukraine, especially the severe restrictions between [[German invasion of Poland|1939]] and [[Glasnost#Gorbachev and Glasnost|1989]], further isolated the Western Canadian Ukrainian dialect from an evolving Ukrainian language in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]]. Now, immigrants from Ukraine to Western Canada since 1991 speaking Ukrainian find the Canadian Ukrainian dialect old-fashioned and sometimes strange, for modern Ukrainian no longer uses some of the expressions and vocabulary common to the Canadian dialect – or, in the case of the Canadian loan words and adaptations, never did use, because Standard Ukrainian either invented other terms or borrowed and adapted from other languages, such as [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] or Russian.

There are a few [[Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Toronto and Eastern Canada|Ukrainian Catholic]] elementary schools in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] including [[Josaphat Kuntsevych|St. Josaphat]] [[Toronto Catholic District School Board|Catholic Elementary school]] (Toronto), [[Josyf Slipyj|Josef Cardinal Slipyj]] Elementary school ([[Etobicoke]]) and [[Saint Sophia's Cathedral, Kiev|St. Sofia]] [[Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board|Catholic Elementary school]] ([[Mississauga]]); as well as Holy Spirit [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] [[Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board|Elementary School]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]].

===Politics===
Many Ukrainians fled [[Tsarist autocracy|Russia]], [[Polonization#Second Polish Republic (1918–1939)|Poland]],&lt;ref name="Swyripa-TCE-EOU"/&gt; and later, the Soviet Union, to find freedom and a better life in Canada. For them Canada became "an anti-Russia", where they could realize their political and economic ideas. Most Ukrainian Canadians were [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet]], yet a minor group of Ukrainians has [[Ukrainian Social Democratic Party (Canada)|since 1910]] supported [[Socialism and social democracy in Canada|Canadian socialism]] and contributed to the formation of the [[Communist Party of Canada]], and formed a significant bloc within that group. They were also active in other [[Marxism|Marxist]] organizations like the [[Association of United Ukrainian Canadians|Ukrainian Labour Farmer Temple Association]] (ULFTA). Ukrainians also played a central role in the 1930s formation of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) and the 1960s formation of the [[New Democratic Party]]. Ukrainians were a notable portion of the [[Mackenzie–Papineau Battalion]] of Canadians who volunteered and fought in the [[Spanish Civil War]] on the side of the [[Second Spanish Republic|leftist republican government]] against the nationalist troops of [[Generalissimo|Generalísimo]] [[Francisco Franco]].

Ukrainians in Canada at first supported the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] federally and [[Liberalism in Canada#Liberal parties|provincially]], a minority moved towards the 1930s protest parties of [[Social Credit Party of Canada|Social Credit]] and the CCF federally and provincially. The strident anti-communism of [[John Diefenbaker]] in the 1950s led the more nationalist-minded to support the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|federal Progressive Conservatives]]. Today's Ukrainian community tends to vote based on economic class interests and/or [[List of regions of Canada|regional]] preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Swyripa, "Canada", p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nationalist movement, through the [[Ukrainian National Federation of Canada|Ukrainian National Federation]] and the Canadian League for the Liberation of Ukraine, was also an important part of the community. After Ukraine became independent Canada was one of the first nations to recognize Ukraine. From 1992 to 1994, Ukrainian Canadians were vital in fundraising to purchase a building in [[Ottawa]] to house the [[Embassy of Ukraine, Ottawa|Embassy of Ukraine]]. As well, Canada has recognized the ''[[Holodomor]]'' (Ukrainian Famine) as an act of genocide. Canada also sent many observers to Ukraine during the disputed [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]] (see: [[Orange Revolution]]). The [[Global Affairs Canada|Government of Canada]] as well as its provincial governments – especially the Ukrainian strongholds in [[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]] – do much to support Ukraine's economic and political development.

The Ukrainian Canadians had and have much more influence in Canadian society and policy than any other East European group; therefore they have had several prominent figures in top positions. [[Ray Hnatyshyn]] was the 24th [[List of Governors General of Canada#Under Elizabeth II (1952–present)|Governor General of Canada]] (1990–1995) and the first Governor General of Ukrainian descent. Ukrainians were also elected leaders of Canada's prairie provinces: [[Gary Filmon]] was [[List of premiers of Manitoba|Premier of Manitoba]] (1988–1999), nearly simultaneously with Hnatyshyn, and [[Roy Romanow]] was [[List of premiers of Saskatchewan|Premier of Saskatchewan]] (1991–2001), also partly at the same time as Filmon and Hnatyshyn.&lt;ref name="Hans-Joachim Hoppe"&gt;[[Hans-Joachim Hoppe]]: {{de icon}} "[http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/kultur/literatur_und_kunst/ukrainische_weiten_1.3544822.html Ukrainian vastnesses – Canada was and is for many East Europeans a country of prophecy]", in: [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]], no. 211, September 12/13, 2009, p. B3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ed Stelmach]] became [[List of premiers of Alberta|Premier of Alberta]] in 2006 as the third [[Premier (Canada)|provincial prime minister]] of Ukrainian descent. He succeeded [[Ralph Klein]] (1992–2006), who had [[Cabinet (government)|cabinets]] with many Ukrainian ministers. Stelmach himself is the grandson of Ukrainian immigrants and speaks fluent Ukrainian.&lt;ref name="Hans-Joachim Hoppe"/&gt; He left office in October 2011.

Most Ukrainians who came to Canada from Galicia were [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic]] and those from Bukovyna were [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate|Ukrainian Orthodox]]. However, people of both churches faced a [[Western Ukrainian Clergy|shortage of priests]] in Canada. The Ukrainian Catholic clergy came into conflict with the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Edmonton|Roman Catholic hierarchy]] because they were not celibate and wanted a separate governing structure. At the time, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was the only [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] church that operated in North America – because they had arrived first via [[Russian America|Alaska]], and traditionally Orthodox churches are [[Orthodox Church organization|territorially exclusive]]. However, Ukrainians in Canada were suspicious of being controlled from Russia, first by the [[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality|Tsarist government]] and later by the Soviets. Partially in response to this, the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada]] was created as a wholly Ukrainian Canadian-controlled alternative. As well the Ukrainian Catholic clergy were eventually given a [[Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Winnipeg|separate structure]] from the Roman Church.

[[File:VegrevillePysanka.JPG|thumb|right|The world's largest pysanka was erected in [[Vegreville]], [[Alberta]] in 1974, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].]]
Canada is home to some very vibrant [[Ukrainian dance]] groups. Some examples of Ukrainian dance ensembles in Canada are the Ukrainian ''Shumka'' Dancers and the [[Cheremosh Ukrainian Dance Company]] in [[Edmonton]], the ''Rusalka'' Ukrainian Dance Ensemble and ''Rozmai'' Ukrainian Dance Company in [[Winnipeg]], the [[Svitanok Ukrainian Dance Ensemble]] in [[Ottawa]], and hundreds of other groups.

The Ukrainian Canadian Foundation of Taras Shevchenko provides some financial support for Ukrainian Canadian performing, [[Literature|literary]] and [[visual arts]].

Ukrainians in general are noted for their elaborately decorated Easter Eggs or ''[[Pysanka|pysanky]]'', and that is also true in Canada. The world's largest pysanka is in [[Vegreville]], [[Alberta]].

Ukrainian Canadian churches are also famous for their [[onion dome]]s, which have elaborately painted [[mural]]s on their interior, and for their [[iconostasis]], or [[icon]] walls.

===Music===
Ukrainian Canadian musicians and groups include [[Randy Bachman]], the [[Canadian Bandurist Capella]], [[Ron Cahute]], [[Rick Danko]], Victor Mishalow, [[Chantal Kreviazuk]], [[Gordie Johnson]], and ''[[Canadian Idol]]'' season 2 runner-up [[Theresa Sokyrka]]. The Edmonton-based group the [[Kubasonics]] focuses on a [[folk fusion]] of traditional Ukrainian music with modern touches.

===Food===
{{See also|Ukrainian cuisine}}
Cultural food is an important part of Ukrainian culture. Special foods used at Easter as well as Christmas are not made at any other time of the year. In fact on Christmas Eve (January 6{{refn|Because Ukrainian Canadians are the largest [[Eastern Church|Eastern Christian]] group in Canada, January 6–7 is commonly referred by Canadians of all origins as "Ukrainian Christmas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Popeski |first1=Ron |title=Opinion – Should Ukrainians do away with Ukrainian Christmas? |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/ukrainian-christmas-comment-1.3392177 |publisher=[[CBWT-DT|CBC Manitoba]] |date=6 January 2016 |accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/news/winnipeg/2009/01/07/7940171-sun.html |newspaper=[[Winnipeg Sun]] |title=Joyous, family celebration marks Ukrainian Christmas |accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|name=Christmas|group="N"}} in the [[Gregorian calendar]]), a [[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|special twelve-dish meatless meal]] is served. The best-known foods are ''[[Borscht|borshch]]'' (a vegetable soup, usually with beets), ''[[Cabbage roll|holobtsi]]'' (cabbage rolls), ''[[Pierogi|pyrohy]]'' or ''varenyky'' (dumplings often called "perogies"), and ''[[Kielbasa|kovbasa]]'' (garlic sausage).

Several items of Ukrainian food and culture have been enshrined with [[roadside attraction]]s throughout the Prairie provinces. These are celebrated in the polka ''[[Giants of the Prairies]]'' by the [[Kubasonics]]. For example, the world's largest perogy is in [[Glendon, Alberta]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/giant-perogy Giant Perogy – Glendon, Canada - Atlas Obscura]&lt;/ref&gt; and the world's biggest ''kovbasa'' is in  [[Mundare|Mundare, Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-world-s-largest-sausage The World's Largest Sausage – Mundare, Canada - Atlas Obscura]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions===
There are a number of Ukrainian Canadian institutions, such as:
* the [[Ukrainian Canadian Congress]] – a national umbrella organization, established in 1940, represents the Ukrainian Canadian community. The UCC has branches and provincial councils across the country and has dozens of member organizations. The UCC leads and represents the Ukrainian Canadian community to the government of Canada and to the provincial governments.
* the [[Ukrainian National Federation of Canada]], the largest Ukrainian Canadian organization founded in Edmonton in 1932 to unite Ukrainian Canadians on a non-sectarian basis for the prime objectives of preserving Ukrainian language and culture in Canada, promoting good citizenship, and supporting the establishment of an independent and democratic Ukrainian state.

:{{small|1=''Information in this section taken from [http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/prof/92-591/index.cfm?Lang=E 2006 Census Community Profiles].}}''
The provinces with the largest Ukrainian populations (single and multiple origins, 2006) are Ontario, 336,355; Alberta, 332,180; British Columbia, 197,265; Manitoba, 167,175; Saskatchewan 129,265; and Quebec, 31,955. In terms of proportion of the total population, the most Ukrainian provinces and territories are Manitoba (15%), Saskatchewan (13%), Alberta (10%), Yukon (5%), British Columbia (5%), and Ontario (3%).

The metropolitan regions with the largest Ukrainian populations (single and multiple origins, 2006) are Edmonton, 144,620; Toronto, 122,510; Winnipeg, 110,335; Vancouver, 81,725; Calgary, 76,240; Saskatoon, 38,825; Hamilton, 27,080; Montreal, 26,150; Regina, 25,725; Ottawa-Gatineau, 21,520; St. Catharines-Niagara, 20,990; Thunder Bay, 17,620; Victoria, 15,020; Kelowna, 13,425; Oshawa, 12,555; London, 10,765; and Kitchener 10,425.

The Census Divisions with the largest percentage of Ukrainians are Manitoba #12 (25%), Alberta #10 (20%), Alberta #12 (19%), Manitoba #11 (15%), Manitoba #7 (13%), Manitoba #10 (12%), Manitoba #9 (12%), Manitoba #2 (10%).

It is impossible to know which are proportionately the most Ukrainian municipalities in Canada since Statistics Canada does not release such information for communities with less than 5,000 people, and Ukrainians are the most concentrated in the smallest communities in the rural West. That being said, the following are communities (total greater than 5,000) with a high percentage of Ukrainians: Vegreville, Alberta (41%), St. Paul, Alberta (town) (31%), St. Paul County, Alberta (26%).

The '''Ural Swedes''', ({{lang-sv| uralssvenskar}}, {{lang-ru|Уральские шведы}}) were [[Ural Cossacks|Yaik Cossacks]] (later Orenburg Cossacks) with Swedish ancestry, related to the large groups of Swedish prisoners of the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721).

== History ==
During the [[Great Northern War]], at least 120,000 men surrendered and were held in Russian POW camps until the war ended.&lt;ref&gt;http://trojza.blogspot.ru/2013/03/1700-1721.html Swedish prisoners of Northern War&lt;/ref&gt; After the defeats at [[Battle of Poltava (1709)|Poltava]] and [[Surrender at Perevolochna|Perevolochna]] there were about 20,000&lt;ref name=Tucker&gt;Tucker, S. C., 2010, ''A Global Chronology of Conflict'', Vol. 2, Santa Barbara: ABC-Clio, LLC, {{ISBN|9781851096671}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|710}} to 25,000 Swedes that capitulated&lt;ref&gt;Englund, Peter, ''The Battle that Shook Europe: Poltava and the Birth of the Russian Empire'', 2003, I. B. Tauris, {{ISBN|1-86064-847-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|246}} Individual surrenders were uncommon, usually a large unit surrendered all its men. Most of them were put to work in Ukraine, Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]]. Another large group was moved into Siberia and [[Ural (region)|Ural]], where they start to work in mining under command of [[Vasily Tatishchev]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prvregion.narod.ru/data/hstpm/v_plen_u.htm Swedish POW in Ural mines&lt;/ref&gt;

About 8,000 Swedes joined the Russian Army to survive, so Peter I put them in Astrakhan Garrison and on Ural Cossack Line to protect Russian land against Kazakhs and Kirgizian riders, where they joined the military expeditions of [[Alexander Bekovich-Cherkassky|Bekovich-Cherkassky]] to [[Khanate of Khiva|Khiva]],&lt;ref&gt;Shebaldin, G.

Uralsk. 1911&lt;/ref&gt; Later part of Ural Cossacks were used to support [[Orenburg Cossacks]] Line, in Sakmara. Another group was moved to Vozdvizhenskaya fortress in 1745 and thanks to isolation they kept some language and cultural identification until the beginning of the 20th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2396">The '''Vienna School of Dermatology''' was a group of dermatologists affiliated to the [[University of Vienna]] who became an important reference in the development of modern [[dermatology]] in the second half of the 19th century. It was founded by [[Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra]] (1816-1888) with the collaboration of his mentor, [[Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky]] (1804-1878) and [[Carl Wedl]] (1815-1891), a [[pathologist]] with interest in [[skin diseases]]. Their pupils, [[Isidor Neumann]] (1832-1906), [[Salomon Stricker]] (1834-1898), [[Heinrich Auspitz]] (1834-1885), [[Moritz Kaposi]] (1837-1902), all of the same generation; and [[Paul Gerson Unna]] (1850-1929) and [[Salomon Ehrmann]] (1854-1926), continued the tradition. Unna later became the father of German dermatopathology.

Von Hebra first organized the dermatological service in the [[Vienna General Hospital]]. He was inspired by the movement towards a scientific dermatology already established in [[England]] by [[Robert Willan]] (1757-1812) and [[Thomas Bateman (physician)|Thomas Bateman]] (1778-1821); and in [[France]] by [[Jean-Louis-Marc Alibert]] (1768-1837), [[Laurent-Théodore Biett]] (1781-1840), [[Pierre Louis Alphée Cazenave]] (1795-1877) and [[Pierre François Olive Rayer]] (1793-1867). The Vienna School adopted the approach of [[pathology]] (as influenced by the great Carl von Rokitansky, a professor of von Hebra) and the doctrine of local causative agents. For example, 2,000 of the first 2,500 dermatological patients treated by von Hebra had [[scabies]].

The members of the Vienna School discovered and described many new diseases and signs, such as:
* [[Auspitz's sign]]
* [[Eczema herpeticum]]
* [[Erythema exudativum multiforme]]
* [[Hebra's disease]]
* [[Hebra's prurigo]]
* [[Impetigo herpetiformis]]
* [[Kaposi-Irgang syndrome]]
* [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]
* [[Lichen acuminatus]]
* [[Lichen planus bullosus]]
* [[Lichen ruber moniliformis]]
* [[Lupus erythematosus]]
* [[Pityriasis rubra]]
* [[Tinea cruris]]
* [[Unna-Politzer naevus]]
* [[Unna's disease]]
* [[Unna-Thost syndrome]]
* [[Xeroderma pigmentosa]]

'''Willem Drees Sr.''' ({{Audio|Nl-Willem Drees.ogg|Dutch pronunciation}}; 5 July 1886 – 14 May 1988) was a Dutch statesman who served as [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] from 7 August 1948 to 22 December 1958. He was the first [[Leader of the Labour Party (Netherlands)|Leader of the Labour Party]] (PvdA), assuming the position from 9 February 1946 until the end of his premiership.

Born in [[Amsterdam]], Drees, a [[Civil service|civil servant]] and [[accountant]] by occupation, worked as a [[bank teller]] from 1903 until 1906 and as a [[Shorthand|stenographer]] for the [[States General of the Netherlands]] from 1907 until 1945. He served as a member of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] from 9 May 1933 to 24 June 1945 while retaining his previous employment. In October 1940 he was taken hostage in [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] for resisting orders given by German occupiers but was freed one year later; his parliamentary mandate had not been revoked. He served as the [[parliamentary leader]] of the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] in the House of Representatives from 19 August 1939 until 24 June 1945 when he became [[Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment|Minister of Social Affairs]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Deputy Prime Minister]] serving from 24 June 1945 until 7 August 1948 in the [[Schermerhorn–Drees cabinet]] and [[First Beel cabinet]]. He served again a short periode as a member of the House of Representatives, after the [[Dutch general election, 1946|general election of 1946]] from 4 June 1946 until 4 July 1946. After the [[Dutch general election, 1948|general election of 1948]], Drees became [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]], leading the [[Drees–Van Schaik cabinet|First]], [[First Drees cabinet|Second]], [[Second Drees cabinet|Third]] and [[Third Drees cabinet|Fourth Drees cabinets]]. He also served as Acting [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Minister of Colonial Affairs]] from 15 March 1951 until 31 March 1951 and as Acting [[Ministry of Finance (Netherlands)|Minister of Finance]] from 1 July 1952 until 2 September 1952, following the resignations of [[Johannes Henricus van Maarseveen]] and [[Piet Lieftinck]] respectively. He again had two short stints as a member of the House of Representatives after the [[Dutch general election, 1952|general election of 1952]] and [[Dutch general election, 1952|1952]], serving from 15 July 1952 until 2 September 1952 and from 3 July 1956 until 3 October 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gJVEAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Willem+Drees+14+may+1988&amp;dq=Willem+Drees+14+may+1988&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpn4izoZbWAhXDPZoKHbWADFwQ6AEIOjAG|title=The Encyclopedia Americana|date=18 November 1992|publisher=Grolier|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drees most notably led the country through the [[North Sea flood of 1953]] and was the second oldest person who served as [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] after [[Johan Rudolph Thorbecke]], who died in office at the age of seventy-four.

==Education and private career==
Willem Drees was born in [[Amsterdam]] on 5 July 1886. After completing his secondary education in 1903 at the [[Hogeschool van Amsterdam]], he worked until 1906 for the Twentsche Bank in [[Amsterdam]]. This was followed by a period as a [[Court reporter|stenographer]] with the Municipal Council of [[Amsterdam]] and then between 1907 and 1919 with the [[States General of the Netherlands]].

==Political involvement==

===Early career===
[[File:Willem Drees 1908.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Willem Drees in 1908]]
In 1904 he joined the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]], which later was absorbed into the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] in 1946. From 1910 to 1931 he was chairman of [[The Hague]] branch of the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] and between 1913 and 1941 a member of the [[Municipal council (Netherlands)|municipal council]] of [[The Hague]]. During that period he was [[alderman]] for [[social affairs]] from 1919 to 1931 and for [[finance]] and public works through to 1933.&lt;ref name="Biography Willem Drees"&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.iisg.nl/bwsa/bios/drees.html Biography Willem Drees] ''BWSA''&lt;/ref&gt;

For 22 years between 1919 and 1941 Drees also held a seat on the Provincial Council of [[South Holland]] and for 19 years between 1927 and 1946 one on the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] executive. Between 1933 and 1940 he represented the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] in the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] and from 1939 as [[Parliamentary leader|leader]] in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]]

During the German occupation he was taken hostage in [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] in October 1940. Freed one year later, he played a prominent role, as vice chairman and acting chairman of the illegal Executive Committee of the SDAP, and as a prominent participant in secret interparty consultations. In 1944 he became chairman of the ''Contact Commissie van de Illegaliteit'' and a member of the College van Vertrouwensmannen which the government in exile charged with the preparation of steps to be taken at the time of liberation.

Thereafter, from 24 June 1945 to 7 August 1948 Drees was [[Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment|Minister of Social Affairs]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Deputy Prime Minister]] in the [[Netherlands cabinet Schermerhorn/Drees|Cabinet Schermerhorn/Drees]].

===Prime Minister of the Netherlands===

From 7 August 1948 to 22 December 1958 he was [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] in four successive cabinets: [[Drees–Van Schaik cabinet|First Drees cabinet]], [[First Drees cabinet|Second Drees cabinet]], [[Second Drees cabinet|Third Drees cabinet]] and [[Third Drees cabinet|Fourth Drees cabinet]].

Drees's period in office saw at least four major political developments: the traumas of decolonisation, [[economic reconstruction]], the establishment of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[welfare state]],&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Common Destiny: A Comparative History of the Dutch, French, and German Social Democratic Parties, 1945-1969|author=Orlow, D.|date=2000|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9781571812254|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b_fe3zrZIP0C&amp;pg=PA120|page=120|accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Heads of States and Governments Since 1945|author=Lentz, H.M.|date=2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781134264902|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=D6HKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA578|page=578|accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and international integration and co-operation, including the formation of [[Benelux]], the [[OEEC]], [[NATO]], the [[European Coal and Steel Community|ECSC]], and the [[EEC]]. When his Cabinet broke up in December 1958, he was appointed to the honorary position of [[Minister of State (Netherlands)|Minister of State]], the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] appointed him a member of its Executive Council for life in 1959. Due to impaired hearing he stopped attending its meetings in 1966. He strongly disagreed with [[New Left]] tendencies in the membership and strategies of the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]]. He eventually gave up membership of a party he had served for close to 67 years.

Drees was an [[List of Esperanto speakers|Esperantist]] and addressed the 1954 [[World Congress of Esperanto]], which was held in [[Haarlem]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120722134309/http://uea.org/dokumentoj/bhh/rm1947-1974.html UEA: Reta Muzeo. Materialoj el Biblioteko Hector Hodler. 1947-1974&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] ''[[World Esperanto Association]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide range of social reforms were carried out during's Drees's tenure as Prime Minister. The Occupational Pensions Funds Act of March 1949 made membership of industry-wide pension funds compulsory, while the General Old Age Pensions Act of May 1956 introduced universal flat-rate old age pensions for all residents as a right and with no retirement condition at the age of 65. The Retired Persons' Family Allowances Act of November 1950 established a special allowance for pensioned public servants with children, a law of November 1950 extended compulsory health insurance to cover other groups, such as old-age and invalidity pensioners, and a law of December 1956 introduced health insurance with special low contributions for old-aged pensioners below a certain income ceiling. A law of August 1950 established equal rights for illegitimate children, and introduced an allowance for disabled children between the ages of 16 and 20. The Temporary Family Allowances Act for the Self-employed of June 1951 entitled self-employed persons with low incomes to family allowance for the first and second child, and a law of February 1952 introduced an allowance for studying and for disabled children until the age of 27.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Growth to Limits: The Western European Welfare States Since World War II, Volume 2 edited by Peter Flora.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, works councils were established,&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Research on Employee Voice: Elgar original reference|author1=Wilkinson, A.|author2=Donaghey, J.|author3=Dundon, T.|author4=Freeman, R.B.|date=2014|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=9780857939272|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Cd9nAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68|page=68|accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1957 the dismissal of female civil servants upon marriage was abolished.&lt;ref&gt;http://nidi.knaw.nl/shared/content/output/2002/ssm-54-05-fokkema.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of housing, the Implementation for Rent Act (1950) fixed rents and rent increases, while the Regional and Town Planning Act (1950) regulated the planning of house building. In addition, the Reconstruction Act of 1950 established housebuilding programmes,&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book|title=Twentieth-Century Mass Society in Britain and the Netherlands|author1=Moore, B.|author2=van Nierop, H.|date=2006|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=9781845205256|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eMDUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60|page=60|accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and legislation was passed on house building standards (1951), the uniformity of buildings (1954), and uniform building standards (1956).&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Governance in Modern Society: Effects, Change and Formation of Government Institutions|author1=van Heffen, O.|author2=Kickert, W.J.M.|author3=Thomassen, J.|date=2013|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789401594868|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TBhJCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT103|accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In education, measures were carried out such as increased expenditure on the system, a reduction in registration fees at State universities and at the institute of technology,&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt; and the granting (in January 1956) of a special benefit to primary school teachers and to certain categories of vocational teachers, "particularly those who risk being unemployed and who cannot lay claim to a retaining fee."&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001329/132929eo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Other initiatives included secondary schools for girls and special primary education in 1949, teacher training colleges in 1952,&lt;ref name="google5"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lower Technical Education in the Netherlands 1798-1993: The Rise and Fall of a Subsystem|author=Wolthuis, J.|date=1999|publisher=Coronet Books Incorporated|isbn=9789053508619|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lsXQ10o4ROMC&amp;pg=PA202|page=202|accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the extension of compulsory education to 8 years in 1950,&lt;ref name="google6"&gt;{{cite book|title=The World of Child Labor: An Historical and Regional Survey|author=Hindman, H.D.|date=2009|publisher=M.E.

==Personal life==
[[File:Willem Drees sr (1981).jpg|thumb|150px|Willem Drees in 1981]]
On 28 July 1910, Drees married Catharina Hent (6 May 1888 – 30 January 1974)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graftombe.nl/names/info/1187885/hent|title=Graftombe.nl - Informatie over Catharina Hent|website=www.graftombe.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://seniorplaza.nl/drees/|title=SeniorPlaza -   Willem Drees|website=seniorplaza.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had two sons and two daughters,
Both his sons Jan Drees and Willem Drees Jr. were active members of the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]], but left the party around 1970 to join the [[Democratic Socialists '70]]. The cause was a row with younger party members who wanted to plot a more radical left-wing course for the party. Drees himself left the Labour Party in 1971 leaving them without their icon, but he never joined the [[Democratic Socialists '70]].

Drees was a [[Teetotalism|Teetotaler]]. Willem Drees died on 14 May 1988 in [[The Hague]], two months before his 102nd birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/19/obituaries/willem-drees-dies-at-101-postwar-dutch-leader.html|title=Willem Drees Dies at 101; Postwar Dutch Leader|date=19 May 1988|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 22 August 1986, when former [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[List of Presidents of Turkey|President]] [[Celâl Bayar]] died until his own death, Drees was the world's oldest living former head of state.

In 2004 he ended in third place in the election of [[De Grootste Nederlander|The Greatest Dutchman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.nu.nl/algemeen/443284/pim-fortuyn-toch-niet-de-grootste-nederlander.html 'Pim Fortuyn toch niet de Grootste Nederlander'] ''[[NU.nl]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/nieuws/2004/april/Zoektocht-naar-Grootste-Nederlander-begint.html Zoektocht naar ‘Grootste Nederlander’ begint] ''Geschiedenis24''&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the traditional practices challenging the status of '''women in East Timor''' or '''women in Timor-Leste''' include not being able to inherit or own property&lt;ref name=WomenInPolitics/&gt; and the cultural notion that women normally belongs to the home.&lt;ref name=MattC/&gt;  

Apart from these customary concepts, '''East Timorese women''' also confront domestic violence.
