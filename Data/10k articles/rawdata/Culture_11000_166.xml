      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4950">'''2000, Seen By...''' ({{lang-fr|'''2000 vu par...'''}}) was a 1998 international film project initiated by the French company Haut et Court to produce films depicting the approaching turn of the millennium seen from the perspectives of 10 different countries.&lt;ref name="Allon"&gt;Yoram Allon, Del Cullen, Hannah Patterson, ''Contemporary North American Film Directors: A Wallflower Critical Guide'', Wallflower Press, 2002, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The idea was conceived by producers Caroline Benjo and Carole Scotta, who took the idea to Pierre Chevalier of the French-German TV station [[Arte]]. They envisioned each film to be one hour long, made for the cost of four to five million francs, by promising directors.&lt;ref name="O'Shaughnessy"&gt;Martin O'Shaughnessy, ''Laurent Cantet'', Oxford University Press, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten films were produced as a result of the project:

'''''20 Million Miles to Earth''''' (a.k.a. '''''The Beast from Space''''') is a 1957 American [[black and white]] [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[Monster movie|monster film]], produced by [[Charles H. Schneer]]'s Morningside Productions for [[Columbia Pictures]], directed by [[Nathan H. Juran]], that stars [[William Hopper]], [[Joan Taylor]], and [[Frank Puglia]]. The screenplay was written by Bob Williams and Christopher Knopf from an original treatment by Charlott Knight. As with several other Schneer-Columbia collaborations, the film was developed to showcase the [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]] of [[Ray Harryhausen]].

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
Off the coast of [[Sicily]], fishermen watch as a large [[Space vehicle|spaceship]], the XY-21, crashes into the sea. They row to the spacecraft, enter through a hole in the spacecraft and pull two spacemen from the nose-down craft before it completely sinks.

In [[Washington, D.C.]], Major General A.D. McIntosh discovers that the missing spaceship, piloted by Colonel Bob Calder, has been located. As McIntosh flies to the site, Pepe, a little boy, finds and opens a translucent cylinder marked “USAF” on the beach. It contains a [[Gelatin|gelatinous]] [[mass]], which he sells to Dr. Leonardo, a [[Zoology|zoologist]] studying [[Marine biology|sea creatures]]. Meanwhile, Leonardo's granddaughter Marisa, a third-year medical student, is summoned to take care of the injured spacemen. When Calder regains consciousness, he finds his crewmate, Dr. Sharman, in the last throes of the fatal disease that killed his other eight crewmen.

After Marisa returns to the trailer shared with her grandfather, a small creature hatches from the mass, and Leonardo locks it in a cage. By morning, the creature has tripled in size. McIntosh arrives, accompanied by [[scientist]] Dr. Justin Uhl, and meets with two representatives of the Italian government, informing them the spaceship has returned from Venus. Leonardo and Marisa hitch the trailer to their truck and head for [[Rome]]. Calder's spacecraft carried a sealed metal container bearing an unborn [[Venus|Venusian]] [[species]]. As police divers begin to search for it, McIntosh offers a half-million lira reward for the capsule's recovery, prompting Pepe to lead them to the empty container. When Pepe tells them that he sold the mass to Dr. Leonardo, McIntosh and Calder pursue him.

That night, Leonardo discovers that the creature has grown to human size. Soon after, it breaks out of the cage and heads to a nearby farm, terrorizing the animals. The creature eats [[sulfur]] and rips open several bags it discovers in a barn. While feeding, the creature is attacked by the farmer's dog, and the creature kills the dog, alerting the farmer. Calder and the others reach the barn, trapping the creature inside. Calder explains that the creature is not dangerous unless provoked. However, he provokes it by trying to prod the creature with a pole into a cage-like cart, and the creature injures the farmer after he stabs the creature with a pitchfork. After the creature breaks out of the barn and disappears into the countryside, the police commissioner insists that it must be destroyed.

After the Italian government grants Calder permission to capture the creature alive, he devises a plan to ensnare it in a giant electric net dropped from a helicopter. The Italian police conduct their own pursuit, shooting at it with flamethrowers. Gunfire has little effect on the creature, as it has no heart or lungs. Aware that sulfur is the creature's food of choice, Calder uses bags of sulfur as bait, luring the creature to a secluded site and subduing it with an electric jolt from the net. Later, at the American Embassy in Rome, McIntosh briefs the press corps and allows three reporters to view the creature, which has been placed in the Rome zoo. There, Calder explains that the creature is being sedated with a continuous electric shock so it can be studied. Marisa, who is aiding her uncle, begins flirting with Calder. Suddenly, electrical equipment shorts out and the creature awakens.

The creature battles a zoo elephant and sends the panicked patrons scurrying. Taking their fight to the streets of Rome, the two beasts destroy cars and damage buildings. The creature finally wounds the elephant badly and continues its rampage. Calder rams the creature with his car and tracks the creature to the [[Tiber|River Tiber]], where it submerges. Soldiers lob grenades into the river, and the creature surfaces, now gargantuan in size. It heads for the [[Colosseum]] and destroys an ancient temple, killing a few soldiers. As the creature disappears into the ruins, Calder charges after it with a group of bazooka-carrying soldiers, driving it to the top of the structure. Calder scores a direct bazooka hit. Direct fire from a tank then destroys the ledge the creature is clinging to, and it plunges to its death. A relieved Marisa runs into Calder's arms.

==Production==
''20 Million Miles to Earth'' began production in [[Rome]], [[Italy]] in September 1956, using only William Hopper of the main cast, and moved to the U.S. from October 30 to November 9 of that year.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=24902&amp;category=Notes |title=20 Million Miles to Earth (1957) - Overview |publisher=TCM.com |date= |accessdate=November 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rome was chosen as the location for filming because Harryhausen wanted to vacation there.&lt;ref name=overview /&gt; The working title of the film was ''The Giant Ymir'',&lt;ref name=overview /&gt; and it has also been released as ''The Beast from Space''. All references to the name [[Ymir]] were removed from the released version of the film, as Harryhausen was concerned that audiences might confuse it with the [[Arabic]] title "[[Emir]]".  Most of the noises made by Ymir are recordings of elephant noises played at a higher speed.

Ray Harryhausen wanted the film to be shot in color, but the filmmakers were not given a budget large enough to accommodate color filming. In 2007, five years after the death of the film's director, Harryhausen worked with restoration and [[film colorization|colorization]] company [[Legend Films]] to create a colorized version of the film. That version, along with the original theatrical black-and-white version, was released on July 31, 2007 on DVD as part of a 50th Anniversary Edition of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/new.asp?article=4496 |title=Special 50th Anniversary DVD of Harryhausen Classic '20 Million Miles to Earth' restored for special 2-disc colorized edition |last=Thomas |first=Brian|date=May 23, 2007 |publisher=''iF'' magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225100/http://www.ifmagazine.com/new.asp?article=4496 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/article/6892 |title=20 Million Miles Gets Color on Disc |last=Ball |first=Ryan|date=May 23, 2007 |year= |work= |publisher=Animation Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are minor differences between the two versions. One example: the black-and-white version begins in "A Fishing Village in [[Sicily]]", not [[Sperlonga]], Italy.

It was the first of three collaborations between Harryhausen, Schneer, and Nathan Juran. Juran only directed the American sequences, while Schneer and Harryhausen directed the Italian sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-141/141#page/n60/mode/1up|last=Swires|first=Steve|title=Nathan Juran: The Fantasy Voyages of Jerry the Giant Killer Part One|magazine=Starlog Magazine|issue=141|date= April 1989|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''20 Million Miles to Earth'' has an 80% positive rating at the film [[review aggregation]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on ten reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/20_million_miles_to_earth/ |title=20 Million Miles to Earth (1957)  |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]  |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marco Lanzagorta of ''[[PopMatters]]'' gave the film 9 out of 10 stars, calling it "required viewing for those interested in modern cinema".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =20 Million Miles to Earth| work =[[PopMatters]] | first = Marco | last = Lanzagorta | date = August 15, 2007 | url = http://www.popmatters.com/review/20-million-miles-to-earth1/ | accessdate = 2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' wrote, "Don't worry about the dotty script or cardboard performances - just sit back and watch this gelatinous blob in action";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/20-million-miles-to-earth|title=20 Million Miles to Earth|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[Radio Times]]'' called it "one of animation master Ray Harryhausen's best [[fantasy film]]s, and his own personal favourite. The [[snake]]-tailed giant ymir creature is also one of Harryhausen's finest creations: It has a well-defined personality and manages to evoke sympathy for its bewildered plight. The ymir's fight with an elephant and the Roman locations - especially the climactic Colosseum battle - add unique touches to this minor classic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/fsgnby/20-million-miles-to-earth/|title=20 Million Miles to Earth – review - cast and crew, movie star rating and where to watch film on TV and online|website=Radio Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand section|date=March 2017 }}
[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]-born [[Augusta Jane Evans]] (1835-1909) moved to [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] in 1849 and wrote many popular novels that incorporated aspects of her experience in Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=[[Emory Elliott]] |title= Columbia History of the American Novel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2IA7o-OTyEsC|year= 1991 |publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-07360-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28142">[[Image:Thap Mam Shiva 12th c.jpg|thumb|right|350px|This late 11th- or 12th-century sculpture illustrates both the preferred medium of the Cham artists (stone sculpture in high [[relief]]), and the most popular subject-matter, the god [[Shiva]] and themes associated with the god.  Shiva can be recognized by the third eye in the middle of his forehead and by the attribute of the trident.  The hands above his head are making the gesture called uttarabodhi [[mudra]], which is regarded as a symbol of perfection.]]

[[Champa]] was an Indic civilization that flourished along the coasts of what is now central and southern [[Vietnam]] for roughly a one thousand-year period between 500 and 1500 AD.  The original Chams were probably colonists from the [[Indonesia]]n islands, who adopted as their principal vocations those of trade, shipping, and piracy.  Their cities were ports of call on important trade routes linking India, China and the [[Indonesia]]n islands. The history of Champa was one of intermittent conflict and cooperation with the people of [[Java]], the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] of [[Angkor]] in [[Cambodia]] and the [[Đại Việt]] of what is now northern Vietnam. It was to the Đại Việt that Champa finally lost its independence.

The artistic legacy of Champa consists primarily of sandstone sculptures - both sculpture in the round and relief sculpture - and brick buildings.  Some metal statues and decorative items have also survived.  Much of the remaining art expresses religious themes, and though some pieces would have been purely decorative, others would have served important functions in the religious life of the Chams, which synthesized elements of Hinduism (especially [[Saivism]]), [[Buddhism]] and indigenous cults.

This artistic legacy has been decimated by neglect, war, and vandalism.  Much of the damage has been done in the 20th century. Some French scholars such as [[Henri Parmentier]] and [[Jean Boisselier]] were able to take photographs, create drawings, and pen descriptions of works which have been destroyed in the meantime.  Neglect continues to endanger the legacy of Champa to this day, especially the neglect of the inscribed stone [[stele]]s, the source of much valuable information on the history of Champa.  The participants in the [[Vietnam War]] wrought their share of devastation, wiping out for example the vestiges of the Buddhist monastery at Dong Duong ([[Quảng Nam]]).&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Willful vandalism and pilfering are an ongoing concern.

The largest collection of Cham art is on exhibit at the [[Museum of Cham Sculpture]] in [[Da Nang]].  Substantial collections are housed in the [[Guimet Museum]] in Paris, the [[Museum of Vietnamese History]] in [[Saigon]], and the Museum of History in [[Hanoi]].  Smaller collections may be found in the Museum of Fine Arts in Saigon and the Museum of Fine Arts in Hanoi.

== Forms of visual art ==

The remnants of classical Cham art extant today consist mainly in temples of brick, sandstone sculptures in the round, and sandstone sculptures in high and low relief.  A few bronze sculptures and decorative items made of metal remain as well.  There are no works of marble or other higher quality stone.  Likewise there are no paintings or sketches.  The people of Champa wrote, and perhaps also sketched, on leaves, which have not withstood the hot and humid climate of coastal Vietnam.  Items made of perishable materials, such as wood, for the most part have not survived.

=== Metal statues and jewelry ===

The remaining works of art made of metal include bronze statues of the [[Mahayana|Mahayanist]] deities [[Lokesvara]] and [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] dated approximately 900 AD and associated with the Buddhist art of Dong Duong.  An even older bronze statue of the [[Buddha]] bears a strong resemblance to Indian Buddhist statues of the Amaravati style; scholars doubt that it was originally from Champa, surmising instead that it must have come into the country as part of the maritime trade that linked India with Southeast Asia and China.&lt;ref&gt;Boisselier, "Un Bronze de Tara", p.319-320.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Shiva Kosa from Champa.jpg|right|thumb|This Cham ''kosa'', or metal sleeve to be fitted over a [[linga]], is the face of [[Shiva|Siva]], as can be recognized from the third eye in the center of the forehead and the chignon hairstyle known as ''jatamukuta''.]]
We have abundant textual evidence of much classical Cham art that once existed that has been lost to the ravages of time and the depredations of human vandals, looters, and conquerors.  For example, the early 14th-century Chinese historian [[Ma Duanlin]] reported the existence of a large statue of the Buddha made of gold and silver; the current whereabouts of this statue are unknown.  The Cham kings themselves have left us stone inscriptions describing the gifts of now lost precious objects they made to the shrines and sanctuaries of the realm.  Especially noteworthy was the practice of donating decorated metallic sleeves (''kosa'') and diadems (''mukuta'') to important [[linga]]s and the divinities with which they were affiliated.  For example, an inscription on a stone [[stele]] dated approximately 1080 and found at [[Mỹ Sơn]] reports that King Harivarman donated a "large, resplendent golden ''kosa'' adorned with the most beautiful jewels, more brilliant than the sun, illuminated day and night by the rays of shining gems, decorated by four faces" to the deity Srisanabhadresvara, a local embodiment of [[Shiva|Siva]].  A few years later, around 1088, Harivarman may have been outdone by his successor Indravarman, who donated a golden ''kosa'' with six faces (facing in the four cardinal directions, toward the Northeast and the Southeast) topped off by a ''nagaraja'' (serpent-king) ornament, and decorated with precious gemstones including a ruby, a sapphire, a topaz, and a pearl.&lt;ref&gt;Finot, "Notes d'Epigraphie: XI. Les inscriptions de My-Son."&lt;/ref&gt;  Neither of these treasures has survived.

The written sources, including the Chinese books of history and the Cham inscriptions, also report on some of the catastrophic events, primarily acts of war, that led to the loss of Cham art.  In the second quarter of the 5th century AD, according to the historian [[Ma Duanlin]], a Chinese general named Yuen Kan sacked the capital of Champa, making off with many "rare and precious objects", including "tens of thousands of pounds of gold in ingots coming from statues which he had smelted."  Similarly, at the beginning of the 7th century a marauding Chinese general named [[Liu Fang]] made off with "eighteen massive tablets of gold" commemorating the 18 previous kings of Champa.&lt;ref&gt;Hervey, ''Ma-Touan-Lin'', Volume 2, Chapter entitled "Lin-y."  The Chinese recognized a succession of Cham states: first Lin-yi (from the late 2nd century to the 8th century), then Huan-wang (from the 8th to the 10th century), and finally Chen-ching (from the 10th century onward).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is to be assumed that in the centuries that followed, frequent raids and conquests by [[Khmer people|Khmer]] and Vietnamese armies, which led to the eventual destruction of Champa as an independent political entity, likewise resulted in the removal of any portable works of art, including of course any works made of precious metals.

=== Temples of brick ===
[[Image:Po Klong Garai.jpg|right|350px|thumb|The profile of the 13th-century temple [[Po Klong Garai]] near Phan Rang includes all the buildings typical of a Cham temple. From left to right one can see the ''kalan'', the attached ''mandapa'', the saddle-shaped ''kosgrha'', and the ''gopura''.]]
Unlike the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] of [[Angkor]], who for the most part employed a grey [[sandstone]] to construct their religious buildings, the Cham built their temples from reddish [[brick]]s.  Some of these brick structures can be still be visited in the Vietnamese countryside.  The most important remaining sites include [[Mỹ Sơn]] near [[Da Nang]], [[Po Nagar]] near [[Nha Trang]], and [[Po Klong Garai]] near Phan Rang.

==== Buildings constituting a temple ====
Typically, a Cham temple complex consisted of several different kinds of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Tran Ky Phuong, ''Vestiges of Champa Civilization''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''kalan'' was the brick sanctuary, typically in the form of a tower, used to house the deity.
* The ''mandapa'' was an entry hallway contiguous with a sanctuary.
* The ''kosagrha'' or "fire-house" was the construction, typically with a saddle-shaped roof, used to house the valuables belonging to the deity or to cook for the deity.
* The ''gopura'' was a gate-tower leading into a walled temple complex.
These building types are typical for Hindu temples in general; the classification is valid not only for the architecture of Champa, but also for other architectural traditions of [[Greater India]].

==== Most significant temples ====
[[Image:PoNagar.jpg|right|thumb|The temple of [[Po Nagar]] is near [[Nha Trang]].]]
The culturally most important temples of historical Champa were the temple of Bhadresvara located at [[Mỹ Sơn]] near modern [[Da Nang]], and the [[Po Nagar|temple of the goddess]] known as [[Bhagavati]] (her Hindu name) or Yan Po Nagar (her Cham name) located just outside modern [[Nha Trang]].
* The temple of Bhadresvara was the principle religious foundations of northern Champa (known as ''Campadesa'', ''Campapura'' or ''nagara Campa'' in the inscriptions).  Scholars have identified the temple of Bhadresvara, a local incarnation of the universal deity [[Shiva|Siva]], with the edifice "A1" at Mỹ Sơn.  Though today A1 is in the process of devolving into a pile of rubble, it still existed as a magnificent tower when French scholars described it at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Tran Ky Phuong, ''Vestiges of Champa Civilization'', p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The temple of Yan Po Nagar was the principal religious foundation of southern Champa (or ''Panduranga'', a word that is the basis for the modern name "Phan Rang.")  Its buildings date from between the 8th and 13th centuries.  The temple remains standing to this day across the Cai River from Nha Trang, and is in relatively good condition.&lt;ref&gt;Tran Ky Phuong, ''Vestiges of Champa Civilization'', p.95 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sandstone sculptures ===
[[Image:Cham Naga.png|thumb|left|A decorative theme that originated in [[Java]], and from there emanated to other parts of [[Greater India]], is that of the [[makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] sea monster disgorging some other being.  In this 10th- or 11th-century Cham sculpture, the makara disgorges a [[Nāga|naga]].]]
The Cham created freestanding sandstone sculptures in the round, as well as high and [[bas-relief]] carvings of sandstone.  In general, they appear to have preferred sculpting in [[relief]], and they excelled especially at sculpture in high relief.  Cham sculpture went through a marked succession of historical styles, the foremost of which produced some of the best works of Southeast Asian art.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject-matter of Cham sculpture is drawn mostly from the legends and religion of Indian civilization.  Many of the sculptures are representations of particular Hindu and Buddhist deities, most prominently [[Shiva|Siva]], but also [[Lokesvara]], [[Visnu]], [[Brahma]], [[Devi]], and [[Shakti]].  Such sculptures may have served a religious purpose rather than being purely decorative.  Any sculpture in the round of an important deity that is completely forward-oriented, not engaged in any particular action, and equipped with symbolic paraphernalia, would have been a candidate for ritual or devotional use.  Cham sculptors also created numerous [[linga]]s, phallic posts linked symbolically with Siva (if the cross-section is a circle) or with the [[trimurti]] (if the post is segmented, consisting of a lower square section symbolic of Brahma, a middle octagonal section symbolic of Visnu, and a top circular section symbolic of Siva).  The ritual uses of the linga are familiar from modern Hinduism.

[[Image:Elephant on bas relief.jpg|right|thumb|This carving of an elephant is found on a pedestal belonging to the Mỹ Sơn A1 style.]]
A few of the sculptures in the art of Champa depart from the Indian subject-matter to reveal something of the life of the historical Cham people.  An example are the especially well-executed representations of elephants that serve as decorative details in some pieces: from written sources we know that the Cham relied on elephants for military and other purposes, since they lacked a steady supply of horses.  Other sculptures reflect the cultural legacy of [[Greater India]] and express legendary themes more typical of [[Javanese people|Javanese]] or [[Culture of Cambodia|Cambodian]] art than the art of India.  An example of such a theme is the motif of the [[makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] sea-monster, which came to Champa from Java, where it is prominent in the art of the [[Borobudur]] and other temples of the same period.

== Periods and styles of Cham art ==
Scholars agree that it is possible to analyze the art of Champa in terms of distinct "styles" typical for various historical periods and different locations.  Several have attempted through their study to set down a classification of historical styles.  Perhaps the most influential of these attempts are those of the French scholars Philippe Stern (''The Art of Champa (formerly Annam) and its Evolution'', 1942) and Jean Boisselier (''Statuary of Champa'', 1963).&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, ''The Art of Champa'', p.39 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Summarizing the conclusions of these scholars, art historian Jean-François Hubert has concluded that it is possible to distinguish at least the following styles and sub-styles:&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, ''The Art of Champa'', pp.33-34.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mỹ Sơn E1 (7th to 8th century)
* Dong Duong (9th to 10th century)
* Mỹ Sơn A1 (10th century)
** Khuong My (first half of 10th century)
** Trà Kiệu (second half of 10th century)
** Chanh Lo (end of 10th century to mid-11th century)
* Thap Mam (11th to 14th century)
Each style is named after a place in Vietnam at which works exemplative of that style have been found.

=== Mỹ Sơn E1 Style ===
The ruins at [[Mỹ Sơn]] are not all of the same style and do not all belong to the same period of Cham history.  Scholars have coded the ruins to reflect the diversity of periods and styles.  The earliest identifiable style has been dubbed the Mỹ Sơn E1 Style. It is named after a particular structure, which scholars refer to as Mỹ Sơn E1.  Works of this style reflect foreign influence from a variety of sources, primarily from the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] of pre-[[Angkor]]ian [[Cambodia]], but also from the [[Dvaravati art|art of Dvaravati]], the [[Medang Kingdom#Culture and society|Javanese art]] of [[Indonesia]], and of southern India.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.33 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most famous work of the Mỹ Sơn E1 style is a large sandstone pedestal dated from the second half of the 7th century.  Originally, the pedestal had a religious function, and was used to support a huge [[lingam]] as a symbol for [[Shiva|Siva]], the primary deity in Cham religion.  The pedestal itself is decorated with [[relief]] carvings featuring scenes from the lives of ascetics: ascetics playing various musical instrument, an ascetic preaching to animals, an ascetic receiving a massage.  To the Cham, the pedestal symbolized Mount Kailasa, the mythological abode of Siva which also accommodated numerous forest- and cave-dwelling ascetics, just as the lingam it supported represented the god himself.&lt;ref&gt;Ngô Vǎn Doanh, ''Champa: Ancient Towers'', p.50ff.; Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important work of the Mỹ Sơn E1 style is the unfinished sandstone [[pediment]] that was once affixed over the main entrance to the temple at Mỹ Sơn E1.  The pediment shows the dawn of the present era according to [[Hindu mythology]]. [[Vishnu]] is reclining at the bottom of the ocean.  His bed is [[Sesha]] the serpent.  A lotus grows upwards from Vishnu's navel, and [[Brahma]] emerges from the lotus in order to recreate the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.72.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Dong Duong Style ===
In 875, the Cham king Indravarman II founded a new dynasty at Indrapura, in what is now the [[Quảng Nam]] region of central [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;Ngô Vǎn Doanh, ''Champa: Ancient Towers'', p.72.&lt;/ref&gt;  Departing from the religious traditions of his predecessors, who were predominantly [[Shaivism|Shaivists]], he founded the [[Mahayana Buddhist]] monastery of Dong Duong, and dedicated the central temple to [[Lokesvara]].&lt;ref&gt;Ngô Vǎn Doanh, ''Champa: Ancient Towers'', p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple complex at Dong Duong having been devastated by bombing during the Vietnam War, our knowledge of its appearance is limited to the photographs and descriptions created by French scholars earlier in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.36 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  A fair number of sculptures of the period have survived, however, in the museums of Vietnam, and collectively they are known as the works of the Dong Duong Style.  The style lasted until well into the 10th century.

The Dong Duong style of sculpture has been described as a highly original style of "artistic extremism", "with exaggerated, almost excessively stylized features."&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.40.&lt;/ref&gt;  The figures are characterized by their thick noses and lips and by the fact that they do not smile.&lt;ref name="Hubert, p.43"&gt;Hubert, ''The Art of Champa'', p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent motifs include scenes from the life of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], Buddhist monks, [[dharmapalas]] (guardians of the Buddhist law), [[Architecture of Cambodia|dvarapalas]] (armed temple guardians), the [[bodhisattva]] [[Avalokiteshvara]], and the goddess of compassion [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], who was also regarded as the [[shakti]] or spouse of Avalokiteshvara.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.81 ff.; Huynh Thi Duoc, ''Cham Sculpture'', p.66 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Kneeling_fat_man_Dong_Duong.jpg|This statue of a kneeling fat man wearing a mukuta and a mustache is from the 9th century.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Mỹ Sơn A1 Style ===
The art of the Mỹ Sơn A1 style belongs to the 10th and 11th centuries, a period of [[Hindu]] revival following the [[Buddhist]] period of Dong Duong, and also a period of renewed influence from [[Java]].  This period has been called the "golden age" of Cham Art.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;  The style is named after a temple at [[Mỹ Sơn]], "the most perfect expression of Cham architecture" according to art historian Emmanuel Guillon, that fell victim to the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s.  Most of the remaining monuments at Mỹ Sơn also belong to the Mỹ Sơn A1 style, including most of the constructions of groups B, C, and D.&lt;ref&gt;Ngô Vǎn Doanh, ''Mỹ Sơn Relics'', p.140-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

As to the sculpture of the Mỹ Sơn A1 style, it is known as being light and graceful, in contrast with the more severe style of Dong Duong.  According to Guillon, "It is an art of dance and movement, of grace, and of faces which sometimes wear a slight, almost ironic style, as though surprised by their own beauty."  Indeed, dancers were a favorite motif of the Mỹ Sơn A1 sculptors.  The style is also known for its fine relief images of real and mythical animals such as elephants, lions and garudas.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.128 ff.; Huynh Thi Duoc, ''Cham Sculpture'', pp.55 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mỹ Sơn A1 style encompasses not only works of art found at Mỹ Sơn, but also works found at Khuong My and Trà Kiệu, though the latter are sometimes treated as representing distinct styles. The works of Khuong My in particular are frequently treated as transitional between the styles of Dong Duong and Mỹ Sơn A1.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.45, 105 f.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, works found at Chanh Lo are sometimes treated as belonging to the Mỹ Sơn A1 style and sometimes treated as transitional between the Mỹ Sơn A1 and Thap Mam styles.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.134.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Khuong My Style ====
In the village of Khuong My in the Vietnamese province of [[Quảng Nam]] stands a group of three Cham towers dating from the 10th century. The style of the towers and the artwork associated with them is transitional between the powerful style of Dong Duong and the more charming and delicate Mỹ Sơn A1 style.  The style of Khuong My also exhibits Khmer and Javanese influence.&lt;ref&gt;Ngô Vǎn Doanh, ''Champa: Ancient Towers'', Ch.5: "Khuong My", p.95 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Trà Kiệu Style ====
Although the Cham monuments at Trà Kiệu in [[Quảng Nam Province]] have been destroyed, a number of magnificent pieces of sculpture associated with the site remain and are preserved in museums.  Especially noteworthy are a large pedestal serving as a base for a lingam that is known simply as the "Trà Kiệu Pedestal" and another pedestal known as the "Dancers' Pedestal."&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.110 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trà Kiệu Pedestal, consisting of a base decorated with friezes in [[bas relief]], an ablutionary cistern, and a massive [[lingam]], is regarded as one of the masterpieces of Cham art.  The figures on the friezes are especially beautiful, and represent episodes from the life of [[Krishna]] as related in the [[Bhagavata Purana]].  At each corner of the pedestal, a leonine [[atlas (architecture)|atlas]] appears to support the weight of the structure above him.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.110-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dancers' Pedestal, likewise, is regarded as a masterpiece. The purpose and function of the pedestal, which has the shape of a corner piece, remain obscure.  Each side of the corner is graced by a dancing [[apsara]] and a music-playing [[gandharva]].  The base underneath these figures is adorned with leonine heads and [[makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.120-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thap Mam Style ===
After the 10th century, Cham art went into gradual decline.  Both architecture, as exemplified by the temples of [[Po Nagar]] and [[Po Klong Garai]], and sculpture became more stereotyped and less original.  Only the sculptures of mythical animals, such as the makara or the [[garuda]], could rival their counterparts of the earlier styles.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.54 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thap Mam Style of the 11th through the 14th centuries is named for an archaeological site in [[Bình Định Province]], formerly [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]].  The sculpture of this style is characterized by "a return to hieratic formalism and the simplification of shape, leading to a certain loss of vitality."&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.57.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sculptors seem to have been concerned more with the detail of ornamentation than with the grace and motion of the figures themselves.  Indeed, the style has been characterized as "baroque", in reference to the proliferation of ornamental details that distinguishes it from its more "classical" predecessors.&lt;ref name="Hubert, p.43" /&gt;

One of the most original motifs of the Thap Mam period was the sculpting in stone of a row of female breasts around the base of a pedestal.  The motif first emerged in the 10th century (the Trà Kiệu Pedestal at one point had such a row of breasts) and became characteristic of the Thap Mam Style.  It appears to have no counterpart in the art of other Southeast Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.147 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars have identified this theme with figure of Uroja ("breasts"), the mythical ancestor of an 11th-century dynasty at Mỹ Sơn, and claim a connection between this Uroja and the goddess venerated at [[Po Nagar]].&lt;ref&gt;Tran Ky Phuong, ''Vestiges of Champa Civilization'', p.146.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artraker''' is a [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[Community Interest Company]] established in 2012 and the brain-child of political artist, [[Manali Jagtap]]. Artraker annually recognizes artworks that helps shape and inspire through [[visual arts]] how people and organisations understand, engage and respond to [[war]], violent conflict and social upheaval.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/#/about/4571166102/ “About Artraker”], Artraker Official Website, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Artraker Annual Award ==
Artraker celebrates and awards art works and art projects that make a direct positive change in countries which have experienced [[war]], violent conflict and social upheaval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/sep/20/artraker-artists-conflict-zones-in-pictures/ |title=Artraker award: artists in conflict zones fight back – in pictures |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2013-09-20 |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Artraker Awards differ from other awards such as the [[Turner Prize]] or the [[Deutsche Börse Photography Prize]]. Although like them, Artraker awards [[contemporary art]], it is not primarily interested in the significance of the artists’ contribution to the disciplines of [[art]] or [[photography]], but is focused instead on the ability of art to create opportunities for change and to co-create experiences of freedom even in the midst of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/ “Dr Bernadette Buckley, Artraker Jury and Advisory Member”], Unseen, Unknown, and Unsung – Artraker Story, 21 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Artraker Annual Awards are announced during the week of International Peace Day each year and include three [[Pound sterling|GBP]] 2500 cash prizes.  The Artraker Awards are designed by London-based wood artist Sebastian Cox.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultureandconflict.org.uk/news/global-artrakers-unleashed-on-international-peace-day/ “Global Artrakers unleashed on International Peace Day”], Culture+Conflict, 8 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Selected by an international jury from over 300 submissions from 90 countries, South African photographer Alexia Webster received the first Artraker Annual Award on [[International Day of Peace]] (21 September 2013) from [[Martin Bell]] at a ceremony which took place at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gostoli |first=Ylenia |url=http://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/artraker/ |title=Art of Peace : Artraker Award Winners |publisher=[[Trebuchet Magazine]] |date=2013-02-10 |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Artraker Awards for 2014 were selected from 250 entries and included three award categories: The Artraker Award, Artraker Award for Social Impact, and Artraker Award for Innovation in Narrative (supported by a/political).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/artraker-awards/4571762059 “Artraker Awards 2014”]&lt;/ref&gt; The winners were San Zaw Htway (Artraker Award),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/san-zaw-htway/4586127186 “Recycling Myanmar's Dignity”]&lt;/ref&gt; Mirror Image (Artraker Award for Innovation in Narrative),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/mirror-image/4586001543 “Cutting Away the Void”]&lt;/ref&gt; and Lorena Wolffer (Artraker Award for Social Impact).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/lorena-wolffer/4586004589 “States of Exception”]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patrons and Partners ==
Artraker’s founding patrons and partners (2012-2013) are leading [[peacebuilding]], creative, cultural, and academic organisations that  include International Conflict and Security (INCAS) Consulting Ltd, [[International Alert]], Pulse Brands Ltd, [[Goldsmiths, University of London]], Integrity Research and Consultancy Ltd, and Culture+Conflict.&lt;ref name="integrityresearch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.integrityresearch.com/integrity-blog/understanding-conflict-through-art-artraker/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925050731/http://integrityresearch.com/integrity-blog/understanding-conflict-through-art-artraker |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-09-25 |title=Understanding Conflict Through Art: Artraker |publisher=Integrity Research and Consultancy |date=2013-09-21 |accessdate=2014-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The name 'Artraker' is derived from "[[Muckraker]]", a term coined by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1906. It refers to the adversarial journalistic movement that investigated and published truthful reports on social issues.&lt;ref name="integrityresearch" /&gt;

{{Numeral systems}}
{{Contains Bengali text}}
'''Bengali numerals''', also called '''Bengali–Assamese numerals''' ({{lang-bn|সংখ্যা}} ''shôngkha'', {{lang-as|সংখ্যা}} ''xoiŋkha''), are the [[numeral system]], originating from the [[Indian subcontinent]], used in [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]], [[Chittagonian language|Chittagonian]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bishnupriya Manipuri]], [[Chakma language|Chakma]], [[Hajong language|Hajong]] and [[Meithei language|Meithei]] languages. It is used by more than 350 million people around the world or over 5% of the world's population. The Bengali–Assamese numerals are a variety of the [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]].

'''BEULAH London''' is [[luxury goods|luxury lifestyle]] brand with a strong romantic, effortless aesthetic and a socially responsible conscience, founded by Lady Natasha Rufus Isaacs and Lavinia Brennan. Beulah’s mission is to become a global lifestyle brand which has a long term, positive impact on society by providing an alternative, sustainable livelihood to victims of human trafficking and educating people of their plight.

==History==
Isaacs and Brennan met as congregants at the same Christian church in [[South Kensington]].&lt;ref name=ES/&gt; Rufus Isaacs’ great-great grandfather, [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Rufus Isaacs]], was Viceroy of India in 1921. Her family has since maintained strong connections with the country. The Rufus Isaacs' family history prompted Lady Natasha and Brennan to visit in 2009, where she encountered victims of human-trafficking in a government-run safehouse.  While teaching the women there sewing and [[English language|English]], the idea for Beulah London was born.&lt;ref name=ES/&gt;  Initial funding for the company came from family and personal investments,&lt;ref name=ES/&gt; but the company announced in late 2011 that fashion retailer Oscar Pinto-Hervia would be investing in the company and selling their lines in his online outlet.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6390">A '''Braitenberg vehicle''' is a concept conceived in a [[thought experiment]] by the [[Italy|Italian]]-[[Austria]]n [[cybernetics|cyberneticist]] [[Valentino Braitenberg]]. The book models the animal world in a minimalistic and constructive way, from simple reactive behaviours (like [[phototaxis]]) through the simplest vehicles, to the formation of concepts, spatial behaviour, and generation of ideas.

For the simplest vehicles, the motion of the vehicle is directly controlled by some sensors (for example photo cells). Yet the resulting behaviour may appear complex or even intelligent.

== Mechanism ==
[[Image:Braitenberg Vehicle 2ab.png|thumbnail|Vehicles 2a, 2b]]

A Braitenberg vehicle is an agent that can autonomously move around based on its sensor inputs. It has primitive [[sensors]] that measure some stimulus at a point, and wheels (each driven by its own motor) that function as [[actuators]] or effectors. In the simplest configuration, a sensor is directly connected to an effector, so that a sensed signal immediately produces a movement of the wheel.

Depending on how sensors and wheels are connected, the vehicle exhibits different behaviors (which can be goal-oriented). This means that, depending on the sensor-motor wiring, it appears to strive to achieve certain situations and to avoid others, changing course when the situation changes.&lt;ref name="braitenberg84vehicles"&gt;Braitenberg, V. (1984). Vehicles: Experiments in synthetic psychology. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. {{cite web |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype%3D2%26tid%3D3323 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129022037/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=3323 |archivedate=2010-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connections between sensors and actuators for the simplest vehicles (2 and 3) can be [[ipsilateral]] or [[contralateral]], and excitatory or inhibitory, producing four combinations with different behaviours named fear, aggression, liking, and love. These correspond to biological positive and negative taxes&lt;ref&gt;Fraenkel, G. S., and Gunn,D.L. (1961). "The orientation of animals. Kineses, taxes and compass reactions". Dover Publications&lt;/ref&gt; present in many animals species.

== Examples ==

The following examples are some of Braitenberg's simplest vehicles.

===Vehicle 1 - Getting Around===
The first vehicle has one sensor (e.g. a temperature detector) that directly stimulates its single wheel in a directly proportional way. The vehicle moves ideally in one dimension only and can stand still or move forward at varying speed depending on the sensed temperature. When forces like asymmetric friction come into play, the vehicle could deviate from its straight line motion in unpredictable ways akin to Brownian motion.

This behavior might be understood by a human observer as a creature that is 'alive' like an insect and 'restless', never stopping in its movement. The low velocity in regions of low temperature might be interpreted as a preference for cold areas.&lt;ref name="braitenberg84vehicles"/&gt;

===Vehicle 2a=== 
A slightly more complex agent has two (left and right) symmetric sensors (e.g. light detectors) each stimulating a wheel on the same side of the body. This vehicle represents a model of negative animal [[Taxis|tropotaxis]]. It obeys the following rule:
* More light right → right wheel turns faster → turns towards the left, away from the light.
This is more efficient as a behavior to escape from the light source, since the creature can move in different directions, and tends to orient towards the direction from which least light comes.

In another variation, the connections are negative or inhibitory: more light → slower movement. In this case, the agents move away from the dark and towards the light.

===Vehicle 2b=== 
The agent has the same two (left and right) symmetric sensors (e.g. light detectors), but each one stimulating a wheel on the other side of the body. It obeys the following rule:
* More light left → right wheel turns faster → turns towards the left, closer to the light.
As a result, the robot follows the light; it moves to be closer to the light.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Braitenberg Vehicle 4a.png|thumbnail|Complex behavior]]
In a complex environment with several sources of stimulus, Braitenberg vehicles will exhibit complex and dynamic behavior.

Depending on the connections between sensors and actuators, a Braitenberg vehicle might move close to a source, but not touch it, run away very fast, or describe circles or figures-of-eight around a point.

This behavior is undoubtedly goal-directed, flexible and adaptive, and might even appear to be intelligent, the way some minimal intelligence is attributed to a cockroach. Yet, the functioning of the agent is purely mechanical, without any [[information processing]] or other apparently [[cognition|cognitive]] processes.

Often, [[BEAM robotics]] implements these sorts of behaviors.

'''CollegeTimes''' is a [[life hacking]] [[blog]] focused on "real world education" that features an online database of more than 15,000 colleges and universities and their accompanying "uncensored" student reviews, which claims to be the largest higher education directory on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://collegetimes.co/about/ | title=About CollegeTimes | publisher=''CollegeTimes'' | accessdate=2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website has created controversy among multiple for-profit college institutions in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] because of negative student reviews (user-generated) that appear on certain school profiles, which has led to ongoing legal threats and outcries being aimed at '''CollegeTimes''' and their various business partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/04/10/reports-troubles-webster-u%E2%80%99s-branch-campus-thailand | title=Reports of troubles at Webster U's branch campus in Thailand | publisher=''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'' | accessdate=2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website's managed WordPress hosting provider [[LittleBizzy]] was sued in the United States in 2012 by [[Neumont University]], a for-profit technical institute based in Utah, after being accused of "business disparagement" that allegedly cost the college more than $1 million in lost revenue due to negative student reviews appearing on '''CollegeTimes'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2014/05/college-review-website-ordered-to-pay-1m-for-users-disparaging-reviews-neumont-university-v-little-bizzy.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However, the case was eventually thrown out due to improper service of process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://collegetimes.co/neumont-university-gives-up-lawsuit/ | title=
Utah’s For-Profit Neumont ‘University’ Gives Up Fight Against CollegeTimes After Expensive 2-Year Battle | publisher=''CollegeTimes'' | accessdate=2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case garnered attention across the Ninth [[Circuit Court]] after the magistrate judge initially assigned to the case refused to admit [[Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act|Section 230]] arguments - which protect web hosting companies in regard to free speech issues - into the case; the judge went so far as to completely strike LittleBizzy's mention of Section 230 protections from the public record for unexplained reasons,&lt;ref&gt;http://pubcit.typepad.com/clpblog/2014/05/nevada-trial-judge-limits-default-judgment-against-host-of-critical-comments-was-the-relief-awarded-.html&lt;/ref&gt; leading '''CollegeTimes''' to accuse the two judges involved in the case of favoring Neumont due to an alleged common affiliation with [[Mormonism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://collegetimes.co/neumont-university-gives-up-lawsuit/ | title=

[[Sexualization]] of the [[buttocks]], especially of the female gender, has occurred throughout history.&lt;ref name=cultural&gt;{{cite book|last=Singleton|first=Alena J.|title=Cultural Encyclopedia of the Body|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO/Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-34145-8|editor=Pitts-Taylor, Victoria|chapter=Cultural History of the Buttocks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary significance==
Sexologist [[Alfred Kinsey]] suggested that the buttocks is the primary sexual presentation site in [[primates]]. Some anthropologists and sociobiologists believe that [[breast fetishism]] derives from the breasts' similarity to buttocks, but instead provide sexual attraction from the front of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slade|first=Joseph W.|title=Pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Press|pages=404–405|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaGTZySRzeYC&amp;pg=PA404 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, females generally have more round and voluptuous buttocks, caused by [[estrogen]] that encourages the body to store fat in the buttocks, hips, and thighs. [[Testosterone]] discourages fat storage in these areas. The buttocks in human females thus contain more [[adipose tissue]] than in males, especially after [[puberty]]. [[Evolutionary psychologist]]s suggest that rounded buttocks may have evolved as a desirable trait because they provide a visual indication of the woman's youth and fertility. They signal the presence of estrogen and the presence of sufficient fat stores for [[pregnancy]] and [[lactation]]. Additionally, the buttocks give an indication of the shape and size of the [[human pelvis|pelvis]], which impacts reproductive capability. Since development and pronunciation of the buttocks begins at [[menarche]] and declines with age, full buttocks are also a symbol of youth.&lt;ref name=cultural/&gt;

Biological anthropologist [[Helen Fisher (anthropologist)|Helen B. Fisher]] said that "perhaps, the fleshy, rounded buttocks attracted males during [[Rear entry|rear-entry intercourse]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=Helen E.|year=1982|title=The Sex Contract: The Evolution of Human Behavior|location=New York|publisher=William Morrow &amp; Company, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent study, using 3D models and eye-tracking technology Fisher's claim was tested and was shown that the slight thrusting out of a woman's back influence how attractive others perceive her to be and captures the gaze of both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.springer.com/gp/about-springer/media/research-news/all-english-research-news/why-arched-backs-are-attractive/15163220|title=Why arched backs are attractive |author=Elizabeth Hawkins |date=Oct 25, 2017 |publisher=springer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s40806-017-0123-7 |title=Arching the Back (Lumbar Curvature) as a Female Sexual Proceptivity Signal: an Eye-Tracking Study |year=2017 |last=Pazhoohi |first=F. |last2=Doyle |first2=J.F. |last3=Macedo |first3=A.F. |last4=Arantes |first4=J. |journal= Evolutionary Psychological Science |pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bobbi S. Low et al. said that the female buttocks "evolved in the context of females competing for the attention and parental commitment of powerful resource-controlling males" as an "honest display of fat reserves" that could not be confused with another type of tissue, although [[Tim Caro|T. M. Caro]] rejected that as being a necessary conclusion, stating that female fatty deposits on the hips improve individual [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of the female, regardless of [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name="Caro"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caro|first1=T.M.|last2=Sellen|first2=D.

==History==
[[File:Dolly Morton Illustration 2.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Victorian-era [[Erotic spanking|spanking erotica]]]]
[[File:Venus kallipygos03.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Venus Kallipygos]], a Roman sculpture (thought to be based on a Greek original) that emphasizes the buttocks]]
The female buttocks have been a symbol of fertility and beauty since early human history. Statues created as early as 24,000 BC, such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]], have exaggerated buttocks, hips, and thighs.&lt;ref name=cultural/&gt;

The erotic beauty of the female buttocks was important to the [[ancient Greeks]], thought to have built such statues as [[Venus Kallipygos]] (although only a possible Roman copy survives), that emphasize the buttocks.&lt;ref name="Bodywatching"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Desmond|title=Bodywatching: A Field Guide to the Human Species|year=1985|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bare buttocks were also considered erotic in [[Ming China]], where they were often compared to the bright [[full moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=van Gulik|first=Robert Hans|title=Erotic colour prints of the Ming period: with an essay on Chinese sex life from the Han to the Chʼing Dynasty, B.C. 206-A.D. 1644|year=2004|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DO1MQBNCTqIC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;lpg=PA223}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many artists pose models to emphasize the buttocks.&lt;ref name="Bodywatching"/&gt; 19th Century Europeans sought to profit from this unique feature of African women through objectification and exploitation by placing [[Saartjie Baartman]] on display in a [[Human zoo]].

The buttocks have been considered an [[erogenous zone]] in Western thought for centuries; the eroticization of the female buttocks was [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] due to their association and closeness to the female reproductive organs. The buttocks are often [[taboo]] due to their proximity to the anus and association with the [[excretory system]]. The psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] theorized that [[psychosexual development]] occurred in three stages—oral, anal, and genital—and that fixation in the anal stage caused [[anal retentive]]ness and a lasting focus on eroticization of the anus.&lt;ref name=cultural /&gt;

[[Erotic spanking]] was popular in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[United Kingdom|Britain]], perhaps due to the buttocks' fetishization and eroticization. Spanking was prominent in [[pornography]] during this time, with erotica such as ''[[Lady Bumtickler's Revels]]'' and ''[[Exhibition of Female Flagellants]]'' being consumed.

In ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'', published in 1927 and written by British physician and sexual psychologist [[Havelock Ellis]], he describes cultural sexual characteristics of the buttocks.&lt;ref name=cultural/&gt; He says:
{{quote|Thus we find, among most of the peoples of Europe, Asia, and Africa, the chief continents of the world, that the large hips and buttocks of women are commonly regarded as an important feature of beauty. This secondary sexual character represents the most decided structural deviation of the feminine type from the masculine, a deviation demanded by the reproductive function of women, and in the admiration it arouses sexual selection is thus working in a line with natural selection.}}

He adds that
{{quote|The European artist frequently seeks to attenuate rather than accentuate the protuberant lines of the feminine hips, and it is noteworthy that the Japanese also regard small hips as beautiful. Nearly everywhere else large hips and buttocks are regarded as a mark of beauty, and the average man is of this opinion even in the most æsthetic countries.}}

Ellis also claims that [[corset]]s and [[bustle]]s are meant to emphasize the buttocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite wikisource|title=Studies in the Psychology of Sex |wslink=Studies in the Psychology of Sex (buttocks) |last=Ellis |first=Havelock |authorlink=Havelock Ellis |coauthors= |year=1927 |publisher= |location= |page= |pages= |scan= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emphasis on the female buttocks as a sexual characteristic has increased in recent times according to [[Ray B. Browne]], who attributes the change to the popularization of denim [[jeans]]:
{{quote|[E]mphasis on the upper female torso has recently given way to the lower area of the body, specifically the buttocks. Such a change happened quite recently when denim jeans became fashionable. In order to emphasize fit, jeans manufacturers accentuated hips. And after brand name jeans became so popular with the designer's name on the hip pocket, even more accentuation was given to the posterior. The more jeans sales increased, the more ads were used which emphasized the derriere, to such an extent, in fact, that this particular area may eventually surpass breasts as the number one sexual image of the female body.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Browne|first=Ray B.|title=Objects of Special Devotion: Fetishes and Fetishism in Popular Culture|year=1982|page=111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NO5DkzptBeoC&amp;pg=PA111#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Males==

While female buttocks are often eroticized in heterosexual erotica, men's buttocks are considered erogenous by many women, and are also eroticized in [[gay male]] circles. Much of gay male sexuality centres on [[anal intercourse]] and penetration, so the buttocks are eroticized in that sector due to their proximity to the anus and the genitals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=66u24WAyO_YC ''Cultural Encyclopedia of the Body''], page 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uSXSRwAACAAJ ''Anal Pleasure &amp; Health: A Guide for Men, Women and Couples''], Jack Morin, Jack Morin Ph.

'''''Diploglottis campbellii''''' is a [[rainforest]] tree  northern [[New South Wales]] and southeastern [[Queensland]]. Growing to 30 metres tall, it is commonly known as the '''small-leaved tamarind'''. It is rare and threatened and is restricted to a small number of sites, each with a maximum of 3 trees per site. However, it is readily available from nurseries in the Northern Rivers area of New South Wales, and in south-eastern Queensland.

It has soft hairy new growth that becomes hairless with age. It has a grey brown trunk, the outer surface of live bark is green with orange to brown blotches, leaves 10–35&amp;nbsp;cm long, leaflets 4–8&amp;nbsp;cm, glossy upper surface, pale dull bottom surface

The [[inflorescence]] type is a [[panicle]] up to 15 centimetres long with small creamy brown flowers, Fruit usually 2 lobed but can be 1 or 3 lobed (each lobe holding a single seed), hairless, Red (rarely yellow) with a brown capsule, ripe Feb- April.

==Uses==
The fruit of small-leaved tamarind is [[Eating|edible]], and has a [[piquant]] flavour. It is used in [[sauces]] and [[preserves]]. Because the tree is very rare in the wild availability of fruit was a limitation for many years. However, increased planting of small-leaved tamarind has resulted in larger volumes of fruit becoming available for food, as well as ensuring the survival of this species.

The plant has proved adaptable in cultivation, being used in [[amenity]] [[horticulture]] and [[bushfood]] plantings. It is extensively planted in [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]].

{{Nihongo|'''''Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure'''''|デュアル!ぱられルンルン物語|Dyuaru! Parare Runrun Monogatari}} is a fourteen episode series created in 1999 by [[Masaki Kajishima]] and produced by [[Anime International Company|AIC]], both well known for the ''[[Tenchi Muyo!]]'' franchise. It is licensed in the US by [[Geneon|Pioneer LDC]], later known as [[Geneon]]. In addition to the original run, an OVA special was added to conclude the series as a de facto "14th episode".

==Title explanation==
The title refers to the fact that the story takes place in two [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]], a concept loosely based on [[multiverse]] theory.

==Plot==
22 years ago, a huge [[Magic item|alien artifact]] is found on a construction site by a worker named Yotsuga. The foreman orders that the artifact be broken apart to avoid delays. As Yotsuga walks towards the dumpsters to dispose of a small piece of the artifact, the world splits into two. In one world, Yotsuga tosses away the piece and the artifact is destroyed. In the other world, Yotsuga keeps the artifact, leading to the discovery of [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] technology that changes history.

In the present, Kazuki Yotsuga is a high school student who is shunned by other students as an [[otaku]]; his web site describes battles between giant robots that only he can see, but it is mostly as a result of him being occasionally seen by the other students reacting to their "presence". One day, the most popular girl in school, Mitsuki Sanada, approaches him to tell him that she likes his stories. This is only a ruse; she lures him to her father, Dr. Ken Sanada, who wishes to study Kazuki for his research on parallel worlds.

After being thrown into the other possible world by Dr. Sanada's device (thanks to a careless action by Mitsuki), Kazuki finds himself still in Dr. Sanada's basement, but everything is covered with cobwebs. Kazuki goes home, is distracted by a real battle between two giant robots, one white and the other black. The white robot is knocked down and an injured female figure emerges from inside. When Kazuki goes to her aid, he is trapped inside the robot and somehow manages to activate it and defeat the enemy robot. Afterwards, Kazuki reaches his home, but his parents no longer recognize him. He is found by Mitsuki, who has followed him. Along with a military escort, she takes him to the Earth Defense Force HQ, a paramilitary operation led by this world's Dr. Sanada. After Kazuki learns of this world's situation and the attempted conquest of this world by this world's Dr. Rara (Dr. Sanada's arch-rival) who is using technology developed from the artifact, he volunteers to become a giant robot pilot.

Over the course of the series, Kazuki manages to attract several very different women without even trying, and he becomes a hero. He is later taken prisoner by Dr. Rara, the father of this world's Mitsuki. Mitsuki Rara eventually defects and comes to live with Kazuki and her counterpart. Later on, a new type of robot made from the artifact is deployed that can cause objects and people to be shifted between the alternate worlds. During the battle against it, Kazuki and Mitsuki Sanada are sent back to their original world, and they discover their world's Dr. Sanada covered up their disappearance by claiming that they had eloped. As it turns out, the frequent travel between worlds is taking a toll on the universe itself as the barriers separating them begin to break down; this will eventually lead to both worlds vanishing. A decision must be made; since Kazuki and the alien technology are exclusive to each world, one must be eliminated to halt the destruction. The robots are destroyed, and the worlds combine into one, an expression of Kazuki's wish for all his (girl)friends to continue to stay together with him (even though the action is again caused by Mitsuki's carelessness).

The ''Tenchi Muyo! GXP'' novels, written by creator of both ''DUAL!'' and ''Tenchi Muyo!'', Masaki Kajishima, confirmed that ''DUAL!'' is in fact set in the distant past of the ''Tenchi Muyo!'' universe. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Characters==
;{{nihongo|Kazuki Yotsuga|四加一樹|Yotsuga Kazuki}}

:{{Voiced by|[[Takayuki Yamaguchi (voice actor)|Takayuki Yamaguchi]]|[[Joshua Seth|Jeremiah Freedman]]}}

:Kazuki is the main character and stereotypical [[harem anime]] [[protagonist]] of the series: a shy, quiet and awkward everyman, who possesses incredible fighting power and illogical charisma. As such, he attracts a bevy of beautiful women. Kazuki is regarded as a pariah by his classmates because he periodically has visions of giant robots battling in the city. After being accidentally sent to the parallel world by Ken and Mitsuki Sanada, Kazuki discovers that he is the only male that can control the mechas. Because of his unbelievable piloting skill, he is commissioned to the [[Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure#Glossary|Earth Defense Force]], or simply the EDF, and becomes the new pilot of the white [[Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure#Glossary|Core Robot]]. His cover story at school is that he's Mitsuki's little brother, which gives Kazuki quite a bit of trouble.

:Curiously, there is no alternative version of Kazuki Yotsuga in this world. Later in the series, Kazuki subconsciously awakens one of the original alien mechas, a robot named [[Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure#Glossary|Zinv]]. It is revealed that Zinv is Kazuki's counterpart in the parallel world.

:When Zinv is destroyed, Kazuki's desire for the group to stay together results in the creation of a third possible world, where elements from the parallel universes are combined.

:The three main characters are similar to the three protagonists of the [[Neon Genesis Evangelion]] series, Kazuki is similar to [[Shinji Ikari]], only in appearance.

;{{nihongo|Mitsuki Sanada|真田三月|Sanada Mitsuki}}

:{{Voiced by|[[Rie Tanaka]]|[[Michelle Ruff|Georgette Rose]]}}

:Mitsuki is the most admired girl in Kazuki's school; young men constantly send her gifts and cards, and Kazuki is nearly lynched for speaking to her. She lures Kazuki to her house for her father's experiments, and later follows him into the parallel world (for some reason arriving a month before he does). She is the daughter of both Ken Sanada and Ayuko Sanada in this world; however, she's no way related to the Ken Sanada from the parallel world.

:Mitsuki is also an exceptional robot pilot, and joins the EDF to end the war, hoping research to send her home can begin afterwards. Unfortunately, Mitsuki is hotheaded and easily manipulated, and is captured by the [[Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure#Glossary|Rara Army]] towards the end of the series and coerced into piloting the complete version of [[Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure#Glossary|HIMC]].

:She clearly has an attraction to Kazuki, but covers it up by treating him abrasively. When Kazuki is lost behind enemy lines, Mitsuki is affected most of all.

:The three main characters are very similar to the three protagonists of the [[Neon Genesis Evangelion]] series, with Mitsuki being very similar to [[Asuka Langley Soryu]].

;{{nihongo|D|ディー|Dī}}

:{{Voiced by|[[Ai Uchikawa]]|[[Sherry Lynn|Katie Ashley]]}}

:D is a [[Biorobotics|bioroid]], an artificially constructed biological/mechanical being first introduced in the ''Tenchi Muyo!'' universe. The war between the Earth Defense Force and the Rara Army began when D and at least two mechas were discovered in an artifact of unknown origin. Her original body was damaged, so a bioroid was built to contain her essence (represented by a glowing orb in place of an eye) while her body healed.

:D appears to be as inhuman as the robot she pilots, speaking mechanically and asking many questions about human emotions and behavior. The only one to break through her stony exterior is Kazuki, to the shock of Commander Sanada and Mitsuki. D frequently has visions of a horrible creature attacking, and is deathly afraid of HIMC.

:She develops a strong attachment to Kazuki, culminating in her decision to return to her real body at the climax of the series in order to save him, at which she came to the realization that she was in love with Kazuki, a new feeling she hadn't experienced or understood before. It is then revealed that D stole Zinv and fled her world to escape HIMC and [[Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure#Glossary|Kumu]], who claimed the lives of her friends.

:As a robot pilot, D is subpar, often requiring rescue by Kazuki and Mitsuki. However, she redeems herself by removing the limiter placed upon Zinv, allowing its true power to manifest itself.

:When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, D becomes Dee Sanada, taking on the animated personality of a young girl.

:There is also an apparent resemblance between D and ''[[Tenchi Muyo! GXP]]'' character Neju na Melmas, leading some to believe that she and D may belong to the same race. The character of D also resembles the character Doll from ''[[Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar]]''.

:The three main characters are very similar to the three protagonists of the ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' series, with D being very similar to [[Rei Ayanami]].

;{{nihongo|Yayoi Schwael|弥生·シュバエル|Yayoi Shubaeru}}

:{{Voiced by|[[Chie Nakamura]]}}

:Yayoi is the original pilot of the white Core Robot, which Kazuki named "Hartzenen". After suffering a serious head injury in battle, Yayoi experienced a feedback loop, effectively cutting off her connection to robots and ending her career as a pilot. Kazuki climbed into Hartzenen and took control, saving Yayoi's life. She refers to Kazuki as "her prince", and falls in love with him.

:Yayoi goes to great lengths to spend time with Kazuki, signing up to be his combat instructor and school homeroom teacher, and even moving in next door to the Sanada home and building a passageway and door into Kazuki's room (immediately boarded up by Mitsuki).  Her grandmother once tried to arrange a marriage for Yayoi to another man (due in part to Mitsuki Sanada's meddling), but her affection for Kazuki was too deep for her to even pay attention to the would-be suitor.

:When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Yayoi is Kazuki's homeroom teacher, still living next door and usually entering the Sanada house through Kazuki's window (as a short cut), to Mitsuki (Sanada)'s annoyance.

;{{nihongo|Mitsuki Rara|羅螺みつき|Rara Mitsuki}}

:{{Voiced by|[[Megumi Toyoguchi]]|[[Wendee Lee]]}}

:The Earth Defense Force knows her as "Miss Ra", the Rara Army's spokeswoman/mascot, but when Kazuki is injured and trapped behind enemy lines, it is revealed that she is Mitsuki Sanada's counterpart in the parallel world, the daughter of Hiroshi Rara and Ayuko Rara.

:Mitsuki Rara could very well be Mitsuki Sanada's direct opposite. She's quiet, easily embarrassed and gentle; she personally nurses Kazuki back to health. However, she places herself in a [[trance]] to play Miss Ra, becoming a ruthless warrior. When she finds out that Kazuki is an enemy pilot, she launches him away in an escape pod, remembering the time he could have killed Miss Ra, but saved her instead.

:Mitsuki is later [[Brainwashing|brainwashed]] into piloting HIMC, one of the most powerful robots created. After Kazuki saves her, she resists returning home, eventually becoming a Core Robot pilot for the EDF. She comes the closest to capturing Kazuki's heart; the two almost go out on a date, which is unfortunately cancelled by U.N. officers intent on sending her home.

:When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Mitsuki lives with her parents right next door to the Sanada home, but has a habit of sneaking in Kazuki's window via sleepwalking and spending most of her time in the Sanada home.

;{{nihongo|Ken Sanada|真田賢|Sanada Ken}}

:{{Voiced by|[[Ryūsuke Ōbayashi]]|[[Kirk Thornton]]}}

:Ken has A and B versions: the eccentric scientist from our world, and the parallel world's commander of the Earth Defense Force. Ken is Mitsuki's father in this world, but is childless in the other world; naturally, he's quite confused when our world's Mitsuki calls him "Dad".

:Both Kens share a love for instant [[ramen]], a slightly off-color sense of humor, and an understanding that Kazuki is special. Despite appearing to goof off on the job (antagonizing Rara and Akane never gets old), Commander Sanada takes it quite seriously. When the U.N. turns against the EDF, his subordinates remain loyal to him, proving his worth as a leader.

:When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Ken Sanada returns to being a scientist as well as being married to Akane Yamano. In the new world, Mitsuki Sanada is his daughter and Dee Sanada is his adopted daughter. His relation to Kazuki is cause for question. Kazuki calls him "Uncle" but it is debated among fans whether they are actually related in the new world.

;{{nihongo|Akane Yamano|山野茜|Yamano Akane}}

:{{Voiced by|[[Yōko Kobayashi]]|[[Barbara Goodson]]}}

:The Earth Defense Force's United Nations advisor. Despite Akane's tendency to work "by the book", Ken and the young pilots often convince her to defy her orders, such as Rara's demand for the EDF to repatriate his daughter. When the EDF is outlawed, she resigns her post and flees with Ken Sanada and the others.

:When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Akane becomes Ken's wife, as well as (unfortunately) Ayuko Rara's junior (as Ayuko was married to Ken previously), enabling Ayuko to insist on Akane's calling her "big sister".

;{{nihongo|Reika Nanjoin||Nanjoin Reika}}

:{{Voiced by|[[Nao Takamori]]|[[Aline Leslie]]}}

:The grandmother of Yayoi Schwael, she exists only in the alternate world. She is a woman of some mystery, working for the EDF in some unknown (possibly classified) capacity but also acting as a [[Matchmaking|matchmaker]] for eligible young ladies with a success rate of almost 100% (Yayoi is one of the very few that escapes one of her grandmother's matches, thanks to Kazuki and a Rara attack during the marriage interview). She embraces traditional values and is a woman of strong character and moral judgement, as demonstrated when she scolds Akane for allowing people to laugh at Kazuki when he is forced to wear a female disguise. She also cares very deeply for people and is revealed in the OVA to be a dog lover.

;{{nihongo|Hiroshi Rara|羅螺博士|Rara Hiroshi}}

:{{Voiced by|[[Kenichi Ogata (voice actor)|Kenichi Ogata]]|[[G. Gordon Baer]]}}

:In our world, Rara is a [[Nobel Prize]]-winning scientist (previously in competition with Ken Sanada for that honor). In the parallel world, he's become something of a [[megalomaniac]]. It was he who began the war in the first place, transforming himself into a messiah-like figure ("You fools have no fear of God!", "the divine power of the Rara Army").

:In the bizarre scene where Kazuki actually has dinner with the Rara family, the General reveals a softer side of himself; he believes that the war is about keeping the alien technology out of the wrong hands. However, it quickly becomes clear that Rara is simply a figurehead, with his wife wielding the real power. He redeems himself, however, when Kazuki attacks their base, and gets everyone out before it gets destroyed.

:When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Rara and his wife move in next door to the Sanadas, hoping to corral Kazuki into revealing the secret of his connection to Zinv (one method being to get Kazuki into a situation where he would have to marry Mitsuki Rara).

;{{nihongo|Ayuko Rara|羅螺鮎子|Rara Ayuko}}

:{{Voiced by|[[Mika Doi]]|Diva West}}

:Ayuko was both Rara and Sanada's wife in the two worlds, and is the mother of both Mitsukis. In the parallel world, she manipulates events while behind the scenes, posing as Rara's submissive wife. In reality, she controls the Rara Army along with the mysterious alien named Kumu. She exploits Mitsuki Sanada's love of Kazuki to convince Mitsuki to turn against the EDF. Ultimately, both Ayuko and HIMC are defeated by Kazuki and Zinv.

:When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Ayuko attempts to "arrange" Kazuki's marriage to her daughter, with humorous results.

;{{nihongo|Alice Shalom|アリス·シャローム|Arisu Sharōmu}} ({{Voiced by|[[Ryōka Yuzuki]]|[[Lenore Zann]]}})
;{{nihongo|Mena Fitzgerald|ミーナ·フィッツジェラルド|Mīna Fīttsujerarudo}} ({{Voiced by|[[Ai Uchikawa]]}})
;{{nihongo|Ryla Phoenix|ライラ·フェニックス|Raira Fenikkusu}} ({{Voiced by|[[Yūko Katō]]}})
:Mitsuki Rara's best friends. While initially teasing Mitsuki for her attraction to Kazuki, they help him escape the Rara base when his identity is revealed. Later, they give Kazuki her diary after a battle, letting him know Mitsuki's still thinking about him. The three later join Mitsuki Rara as pilots for the EDF.

:When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Alice, Mena and Ryla return to working for the Raras.

;{{nihongo|Kaoru Hayase|早瀬薫|Hayase Kaoru}}

:{{Voiced by|[[Nao Takamori]]|Anne Sherman}}

:A scientist in the employ of the Rara Army. She opposes the plan to force Mitsuki Rara to pilot HIMC, and warns her of her mother's machinations. Hayase later joins the Earth Defense Force and works alongside Ken Sanada.

;{{nihongo|Kumu}}

:An Alien being encased in a shrine in Rara's Garden, where it advises Ayouko Rara in the army's dealings with the Earth Defense Force late in the series. After the world merge, it is represented as a small female dog gifted to the Sanada's that has a penchant for biting Kazuki (whether out of affection or not is not quite clear).

==Glossary==
; Core Robots
: Three multicolored bipedal machines reverse engineered from Zinv. Because they are man-made, the Core Robots are inferior to the originals in every way.

: The Core Robots are used by the Earth Defense Force; [[Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure#Characters|Yayoi Schwael]] (replaced by [[Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure#Characters|Kazuki Yotsuga]], and later by [[Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure#Characters|Mitsuki Rara]]) pilots the white Unit 1 (nicknamed "Hartzenen/Halcynen" by Kazuki), [[Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure#Characters|Mitsuki Sanada]] controls the red Unit 2, and D (briefly replaced by [[Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure#Characters|Alice, Mena, and Ryla]]) pilots the blue Unit 3.

; Earth Defense Force
: A [[United Nations]]-sponsored military organization under the command of [[Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure#Characters|Ken Sanada]] dedicated to foiling the Rara Army's plans for world domination. The EDF employs many soldiers, but relies solely upon the three Core Robots in battle.

: Combat between the two armies is quite different from normal warfare; Rara informs the public where and when an attack will take place, and the combat zone is evacuated. At any time, either side can submit a "callsign", indicating their surrender. Because of these measures, there have been no casualties in the war.

; HIMC (pronounced Himiko)
: Zinv's opposite, HIMC carved a swath of ruin across D's world before she escaped. It seems as though only people with negative emotions in their hearts can control HIMC, as evidenced by its initial rejection of Mitsuki Rara, and its violent reaction to Mitsuki Sanada's jealousy. HIMC has some connection to the alien lifeform Kumu.

: HIMC is completely and totally destroyed at the hands of Zinv, compressed down to nothing to prevent it from regenerating.

; Kumu
: The alien that advises Ayuko Rara. It has some relationship to [[Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure#Characters|D]], and hates men with a passion. Kumu resembles a floating, glowing bell and garland.

: When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Kumu is the name of a puppy that is given to the Sanada family by [[Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure#Characters|Ayuko Rara]] in the hopes of finding out information about Zinv. The name fits: while it loves the girls in the house, Kazuki gets a severe bite whenever he comes near.

; Life Sympathy
: A term for the power of a pilot's will to exert control over robots. High Life Sympathy levels can enable a robot to move faster and inflict more damage with melee attacks. For reasons revealed at the end of the series, the robots on Earth only respond to female Life Sympathy, though Kazuki is somehow exempt.

: Because of his overwhelming negative Life Sympathy, Kazuki's robot is capable of feats beyond most other models.

; Rara Army
: Formed by [[Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure#Characters|Hiroshi Rara]], it intends to unite the world under its banner. Like the EDF, it uses robots in battle rather than conventional weapons, but its machines are exotic and beastly, differing from its rival's humanoid robots. Rara's robots are also remotely operated, unlike the Earth Defense Force's cockpit-equipped models.

: Rara prefers to operate outlandishly, broadcasting attack trailers and boasting of his army's God-given power (often through his mascot, Miss Ra). However, despite General Rara's highly visible status within the organization, another person wields the real authority.

; The Original
: A mech under the control of the Rara army, it has the power to control the atmosphere as well as some electromagnetic capabilities. It captures Kazuki along with Hartzenen and brings them to Rara's base where it falls off a large cliff, supposedly destroying it beyond repair.

: The Original and Zinv are the only mechs confirmed to be found in The Artifact.

; Zinv (pronounced Jinbu)
: An incredibly powerful robot found with D. It sat dormant in the EDF's headquarters for years until Kazuki awakened it during Rara's assault.

: Zinv has many unique abilities revolving around the manipulation of gravimetric forces, including gravitational projectiles, super speed, and crushing enemy mecha. Zinv also comes equipped with a nano-repair system that can fix any damage inflicted. Zinv only responds to Kazuki's Life Sympathy, and sometimes activates itself when Kazuki is not aboard.

: Zinv defeats the lesser version of HIMC quite easily, but HIMC's final form takes the upper hand. When D removes the limiter preventing males from piloting it (Kazuki skirts this by ''being'' Zinv), Zinv instantly repairs itself and generates Light Hawk Wings. With this newfound power, Kazuki decimates HIMC and creates a black hole, reducing the Rara fortress to nothing.

: With the two worlds dangerously close to oblivion, Zinv and Kazuki agree to destroy Zinv, ensuring that both worlds will live on. However, Zinv survives the explosion that consumes it, regenerating at the bottom of the ocean and returning to Kazuki in the third universe.

: Followers of ''Tenchi Muyo!'' will recognize the Light Hawk Wings, as well as the Zinv look-alike in the anime ''Tenchi Muyo! GXP''. The ''Tenchi Muyo! GXP'' novels confirmed that they are in fact the very same robot, and not alternate universe versions of each other as previously thought.

==Future of ''Dual!''==
Since 2001, there has been fan speculation about a ''Dual!'' sequel in the works, but according to AIC Anime's English website there are currently no plans to release such a sequel.&lt;ref name="aicanimefaq" /&gt;

==Connections to ''Tenchi Muyo!'' Universe==
It has been confirmed by the creator of ''Tenchi Muyo!'' and ''Dual!'' that the two series are related, and in fact occur in the same universe.  A mecha, confirmed in the ''Tenchi Muyo! GXP'' novels to be Zinv, is found during an episode of ''Tenchi Muyo! GXP'' which runs parallel with the ''Tenchi'' OVA Series. Miki Steinbeck, the future reincarnation of Mitsuki Sanada and Ken Manada ([[Ken Sanada]]) appear in the ''Tenchi GXP'' novels. Seina Yamada is also confirmed to be the future reincarnation of Kazuki Yotsuga. In fact, Dual! is so consistently relevant to the GXP novels they can be viewed as a distant sequel.
*The Great Prehistoric Civilization that seeded the galaxy mentioned in the Shin Tenchi Muyo! novels is revealed in the Tenchi Muyo! GXP novels to be the space-faring civilization begun by the characters at the end of Dual!. The similarity between Dual!'s Earth and Tenchi Muyo!'s Earth is written about, and D's Astral Body, which Seina finds haunting the ancient Zinv, goes on to even list food they shared in common, like spaghetti.
*By the end of GXP's 14th novel, Mitsuki and Mitsuki Rara's reincarnations gain pseudo-cabbit bodies that were cloned from GXP's Fuku, as does D who haunted the Zinv and was technically never reincarnated, but winds up a pseudo-cabbit nonetheless. Fuku from ''Tenchi Muyo! GXP'' is even revealed to be the reincarnation of Yayoi; although she was a repentant mass murderer named Widow before her Astral Body (soul) was used to create Fuku. By the time of the novel series ''Paradise War'', by Masaki Kajishima as well, the protagonists of Dual! are all reunited as the four cabbits follow Seina Yamada around Banjo Island.
*Sasami and several other ''Tenchi Muyo!'' characters are featured in inserts found in the ''Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure'' laser disks.
*Mitsuki Sanada resembles [[Kiriko Masaki]]
*Yayoi Schwael resembles [[Amane Kaunaq]]
*Mitsuki Rara resembles [[Ryoko Balta]]
*D resembles [[Neju Na Melmas]]
*Akane Yamano resembles [[Airi Masaki]]
*Ayuko Rara resembles [[Seto Kamiki Jurai]]
*Zinv is the Idol mecha piloted by [[Seina Yamada]]

=== Other appearances ===
*[[Kiyone Makibi]], [[Ramia]], and [[Pixy Misa|Misao Amano]] appear in a brief easter egg cameo in the series' OVA special ("[[Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure#OVA|Final Frontier]]", also known as episode 14), and there is much speculation concerning the ancient civilization that the character "D" is from.

==Other Similarities==
Several elements in ''Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure'' (1999) are very similar to ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' (1995):
*The main character changes the world in the last episode to merge two conflicting worlds and to make them both more to his own liking.
*The end result of merging of both worlds in ''Dual!'' is extremely similar to a "hypothetical" outcome displayed to the main character of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion''.
*The rifle guns that the Sanada-style robots use look and act like the rifles of ''Evangelion''.
*The Sanada-style robots can be compared to ''Evangelion'' robots, with similar shoulders, hand-to-hand combat styles, and one male pilot with two female pilots on the team.
*The color scheme of the robot of the confident and somewhat hot-headed female pilot in ''Dual!'' is very similar to the color of the robot of the female pilot Asuka Langly Soryu in ''Evangelion''.
*The color scheme of the robot of the reserved female pilot in ''Dual!'' is very similar to the color of the robot of the reserved female pilot, Rei Ayanami, in ''Evangelion''.
*The Rara-style robots start out as nonhumanoid in the first battles and change their type each battle in size and power, similar to the Angels.
*The main character has a mysterious female friend that is usually quite reserved, until she meets the protagonist, which amazes everyone else. And they both have non-human origins.
*The main character has a female teacher that dotes on him.

{{nihongo|'''[[Dōjinshi|Dōjin]] soft'''|同人ソフト}}, also sometimes called {{nihongo|'''dōjin games'''|同人ゲーム}}, with '''dōjin''' sometimes transliterated as ''doujin'' or ''doujinshi'', are [[video game]]s created by [[Japan]]ese [[Fan-made|hobbyists]] or hobbyist groups (referred to as "[[dōjin circle|circles]]"), more for fun than for profit; essentially, the [[Japan]]ese equivalent of [[Independent video game development|independent video games]] or [[Fangame]]s. Most of them are based on pre-existing material ("[[Video game mod|modding]]"), but some are entirely original creations. They are almost always exclusive to [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based [[Personal computer|PC]]s, but a few notable exceptions also exist for the [[Dreamcast]], a console on which [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] development was popular.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Dōjin soft are typically available in "demo" or "trial" (体験版 ''taikenban'') form [[Freeware|for free]] on the internet, with full versions available for purchase. One game, [[French-Bread]]'s [[beat em up|brawler]] ''[[Ragnarok Battle Offline]]'', a [[Homage (arts)|homage]]/[[Parody|spoof]] of the [[MMORPG]] ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'' so impressed [[Gravity Corp.]] (the original game's designers) that it has been given an official release outside Japan.

Like [[fangames]], dōjin soft frequently use characters from existing games, [[anime]], or [[manga]]. These unauthorized uses of characters are generally ignored and accepted by the copyright holders, and are seen as encouraging a greater fan community.  There are also many dōjin soft titles which are completely original, or feature only vague allusions to other series.

While most dōjin soft sales occur at anime and video game or [[List of anime conventions|anime conventions]] (such as [[Comiket]]), there is a growing number of specialized [[internet]] sites that sell them.  Some titles sell well enough that their creators can make a full-time job out of their "amateur hobby".  One particular circle, [[TYPE-MOON]], has since become a commercial videogame developer.

Dōjin soft games typically do not get released outside Japan due to language barriers. Recently, independent Western developers have offered to help translate these games for release in other markets, with one of the first known successful examples being ''[[Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale]]'', developed originally by [[EasyGameStation]] in 2007, and then localized and released by [[Carpe Fulgur]] in 2010 for English audiences, which had a modest success with over 300,000 units sold in these markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/32250/Carpe_Fulghur_Talks_Sales_Reality_As_Promos_Lead_Recettear_Over_100000_Units.php | title = Carpe Fulghur Talks Sales Reality As Promos Lead Recettear Over 100,000 Units | first = Leigh | last = Alexander | date = 2011-01-03 | accessdate = 2011-01-03 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/12/low-prices-low-expectations-ars-looks-at-indie-game-pricing.ars | title = Low prices, low expectations?

An '''exemplum''' (Latin for "example", pl. '''exempla''',  ''exempli gratia'' = "for example", abbr.: ''e.g.'') is a moral [[anecdote]], brief or extended, real or fictitious, used to illustrate a point. The word is also used to express an action performed by another and used as an example or model.

==Exemplary literature==

This [[genre]] sprang from the above, in classical, medieval and Renaissance literature, consisting of lives of famous figures, and using these (by emphasizing good or bad character traits) to make a moral point.

Collections of Exempla&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nicolas |last=Louis |title=L’exemplum en pratiques : production, diffusion et usages des recueils d’exempla latins aux XIIIe-XVe siècles |volume=2 |publisher=Namur-Paris |year=2013 |hdl=2078.2/133816 |url=https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00860685/file/Nicolas_LOUIS_-_thA_se_-_enquete_annexe.pdf |format=PDF |pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped [[Middle Ages|medieval]] preachers to adorn their [[sermon]]s, to emphasize moral conclusions or illustrate a point of doctrine. The subject matter could be taken from [[fable]]s, [[Folklore|folktale]]s, [[legend]]s, real history, or natural history. [[Jacques de Vitry]]'s book of exempla, c. 1200, [[Nicholas Bozon]]'s ''Les contes moralisés'' (after 1320), and [[Odo of Cheriton]]'s ''Parabolae'' (after 1225) were famous medieval collections aimed particularly at preachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PscUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |chapter=Introduction |page=5-6 |title=The Dialogues of Creatures Moralysed: A Critical Edition |editor-first=Gregory C. |editor-last=Kratzmann |editor2-first=Elizabeth |editor2-last=Gee |publisher=[[Brill (publisher)|Brill]] Archive |date=1 January 1988 |isbn=9789004085152}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale]]'' became a vivid satire on this genre. There were also notable lay writers of moral tales, such as the 13th century [[Der Stricker]] and the 14th century [[Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena]] ([[Tales of Count Lucanor]]).
Examples dealing with historical figures include:

*[[Suetonius]]'s ''De vita Caesarum'' or ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]''
*[[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives]]''
*[[Jerome]]'s ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De viris illustribus]]''
*[[Petrarch]]'s ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Petrarch)|De viris illustribus]]''
*[[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]''
*[[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[On Famous Women]]'' and ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium|On the Fates of Illustrious Men]]''
*[[Christine de Pizan]]'s ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]''.
*''[[Mirror for Magistrates]]'' by various Tudor authors

==Three examples of exempla==

''The Norton Anthology of Western Literature'' includes three exempla (singular, ''exemplum''), stories that illustrate a general principle or underscore a moral lesson: "The Two City Dwellers and the Country Man" and "The King's Tailor's Apprentice" (both from ''The Scholar's Guide'') and "The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck." 

==="The Two City Dwellers and the Country Man"===

In "The Two City Dwellers and the Country Man," told by the father, the three traveling companions of the tale's title are on a [[pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]]. Near their destination, their provisions are nearly depleted, and the two city dwellers attempt to cheat the country man by telling him that whoever of them dreams the most extraordinary dream shall get the last of their bread.

As the city dwellers sleep, the country man, alert to their intended deception, eats the half-baked bread before retiring.

The city dwellers relate their made-up dreams. One says he was taken to [[heaven]] and led before God by angels. The other says that angels escorted him to [[hell]]. 

The country man says he dreamed the same things that his companions dreamed and, believing them to be forever lost, one to heaven and the other to hell, ate the bread.

The son tells his father the moral of the story: "As it says in the [[proverb]], ‘He who wanted all, lost all.’" He says that the two city dwellers got their just comeuppance. The story says that he wishes they’d been whipped, as the antagonist in another story he has heard, was beaten for his chicanery. His comment is a transition to the next tale, causing the father to ask his son to tell him this story. Thus, the roles of the father and his son are reversed, as the father, who was the storyteller, becomes the listener, and the son, who was his father's audience, becomes the narrator.

==="The King And His Wife"===

The son's story recounts the story of a king's tailor's assistant, a youth by the name of Nedui.

One day while he is away, his master gives the other apprentices bread and [[honey]], but does not save any for Nedui, telling them that Nedui "would not eat honey even if he were here." Upon learning that he has been left out, Nedui avenges himself upon his master by telling the [[eunuch]] whom the king has set over the apprentices as their supervisor that the tailor is subject to seizures of madness, during which he becomes violent and dangerous. In fact, Nedui claims, he has killed those who have happened to be near him when he is in the grip of such a fit. To protect himself, Nedui says, he binds and beats the tailor when such a fit comes over him. He also tells the eunuch what to look for: "When you see him looking all around and feeling the floor with his hands and getting up from his seat and picking up the chair on which he is seated, then you will know that he is mad, and if you do not protect yourself and your servants, he will beat you on the head with a [[Club (weapon)|club]]."

The next day, Nedui hides the tailor's shears, and, when the master, hunting for them,  behaves as Nedui mentioned to the eunuch, the eunuch orders his servants to bind the tailor and beats him himself with a club. His servants also beat him until he is unconscious and "half dead."

When he regains consciousness, the tailor asks the eunuch what [[crime]] he has committed to have deserved such a beating, and the eunuch tells him what Nedui told him about the tailor's seizures. "Friend, when have you ever seen me crazy?" the master asks his apprentice, to which question he receives, from Nedui, the rejoinder: "When have you ever seen me refuse to eat honey?"

The father tells the son the [[moral]] of the story: "The tailor deserved his punishment because if he had kept the precept of Moses, to love his brother as himself, this would not have happened to him."

By having the listener tell the narrator the moral of the story, the storyteller shows that the narrative has successfully served its purpose as an exemplum, as the listener, hearing the story, shows that he is able to ascertain the moral that the tale is intended to express.

==="The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck"===

The third exemplum, "The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck," is a prose, rather than a poetic, narrative. Like a mini-sermon, it preaches against wrong conduct—in this case, sacrilegious behavior. This tale has an identifiable author, Robert Mannyng, who set down the story in the early fourteenth century. ''The Norton Anthology'''s version is translated from [[Middle English]] by Lee Patterson.

To bolster his listener's belief that "most of" his tale is "the [[gospel]] truth," the narrator names the culprits and their victims and cites [[Pope Leo IX|Pope Leo]] as one who knows (and wrote a version of) the narrative and points out that the story is "known in the court at Rome" and has appeared widely in many chronicles, including those "beyond the sea." However, after the telling of the tale, the storyteller admits that some doubt its veracity.

The story starts by identifying several activities that are not allowed in [[Church (building)|church]] or in the [[churchyard]]: "carols, [[wrestling]], or summer games." In addition, "interludes or singing, beating the [[tabor (instrument)|tabor]] [a small drum], or piping. . . . while the [[priest]] is conducting [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]]" are "forbidden" and sacrilegious, and "good priests" will not tolerate them.

It is also improper to dance in church, as the story that the narrator is about to tell demonstrates.

When "twelve fools" in Colbeck (or, as the editors’ note explains, "[[Kolbigk]], in [[Saxony]], an area in eastern Germany, just north of the present-day Czech border) decided, one [[Christmas Eve]], to make "a [[Carol (music)|carol]]--madly, as a kind of challenge," and persisted in singing and dancing in the churchyard while the priest was trying to conduct Mass, despite his entreaties to them to stop, the priest calls upon God to [[curse]] them.

The singers’ carol contains three lines, the last of which appears to become the basis of their curse, as they are unable to leave the churchyard or to quit singing or dancing for a year after God curses them for their sacrilegious behavior:

:By the leafy wood rode Bovoline,
:With him he led the fair Mersewine.
:Why are we waiting? Why don’t we go?

As a result of the curse, the dancers cannot stop singing and dancing; neither can they let go of one another's hands.

The priest, too late, sends his son, Ayone, to rescue his daughter, Ave, who is one of the "twelve fools" involved in the dancing. However, due to the curse, when Ayone takes his sister's arm to separate her from the other carolers, it detaches from her body. Miraculously, her wound does not bleed, nor does she die from it.

Ayone takes the arm to his father. The priest tries, three times unsuccessfully, to bury the limb, but the grave casts it back, so the priest displays it inside the church. Everyone, including the [[emperor]], comes to see the cursed dancers, who, despite no rest, food, drink, or sleep, dance non-stop, night and day, regardless of the temperature or the weather. Several times, the emperor orders a covering to be built to protect the dancers from storms, but it is reduced to rubble overnight each time it is built or rebuilt.

After the year has ended, the curse is lifted, and the dancers fall down upon the ground, as if dead.  Three days later, they arise—except for Ave, who has died. Soon after, the priest also dies. The emperor installs the container in the church as a receptacle for the dead girl's arm, and it becomes a holy [[relic]] commemorating the [[miracle]] of the curse.

The other dancers cannot get together again, ever, and must skip, instead of walking, wherever they go. Living mementoes of God's curse against sacrilegious behavior, they bear permanent physical changes to their clothing and their bodies: "Their clothes didn’t rot nor their nails grow; their hair didn’t lengthen nor their [[complexion]] change. Nor did they ever have relief..."

Although some believe and others doubt the authenticity of the tale he's told, the narrator says he recounted the story so that his listeners, taking heed, may be "afraid to carol in a church or churchyard, especially against the priest's will," as "jangling is a form of [[sacrilege]]."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6694">[[File:Bucharest Quarter Ferentari.svg|thumb|Ferentari on the map of Bucharest]]

'''Ferentari''' {{IPA-ro|fe.renˈtarʲ|}} is a neighbourhood located in the [[Sector 5 (Bucharest)|5th Sector]] of [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]. 

==Etymology==
The word "Ferentari" comes from the Latin word "Ferentarius" meaning "soldier in the old pedestrian army".

==Area==
It is located in the South-South-West of Bucharest at a distance of 2.5 to 5&amp;nbsp;km from the city center.  Connections to the city center are relatively poor, because of the limited public transport available (see below) and because of the need to cross areas subject to frequent traffic jams like Chirigiu Square.

The borough stretches along Ferentarilor Avenue (Calea Ferentarilor) and the main boundaries are:  Salaj Road (Șoseaua Sălaj) and sometimes Rahovei Avenue (Calea Rahovei) to the South West, the industrial area, the railway and partially Progresului Road (to the South-East and East), and Salaj Road (to the West).  It is bordered by the Rahova, Pieptănări and Giurgiului boroughs. These boundaries, being totally unofficial, are subject to individual interpretation.

==History==
Ferentari was the first modern industrial area of Bucharest developed in the middle of 19th century, when new industrial plants were built in the area and especially after the first railway in Romania was built (opened in 1869 and connecting Bucharest—via [[Filaret station]]—to [[Giurgiu]]).

==Population==
The population of the neighbourhood is around 90,000. It has been assigned the lowest quota on local taxes (at the beginning of Calea Ferentarilor: B zone, the middle area: C zone, the rest: D zone).&lt;ref&gt;Bucharest City Hall, [http://www1.pmb.ro/pmb/zonafisc/anexag.jpg Map of tax zones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926223403/http://www1.pmb.ro/pmb/zonafisc/anexag.jpg |date=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime==
[[File:Bucharest - Ferentari 4.jpg|thumb|right|Waste between apartment buildings in Ferentari]]
{{Further|Crime in Bucharest}}
It has a bad reputation—as being the worst borough in Bucharest{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} as the base of [[drug dealer]]s, [[prostitution]] and [[Mafia|mob]] operations in Bucharest. This is confirmed by the arrests of the Cămătaru mob clan, and police raids done in the Zabrăuți section of the borough after some drug-related incidents. As such, it is the center of drug dealing in Bucharest (for example, 45 dealers have been arrested in one police action) &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927162732/http://www.curentul.ro/curentul.php?numar=20070131&amp;cat=10&amp;subcat=100&amp;subart=50805] Curentul, 2007-01-31&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the stage of a [[2006 Ferentari riot|riot]], a unique event in a city with very low crime rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?data=2006-11-15&amp;id=211174] Ziua, 2006-11-15&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Ferentari has a lower crime rate in terms of burglaries in relation to much of the city&lt;ref name="cotidianul.ro"&gt;[http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=5365&amp;art=447&amp;cHash=1d0b8b0d66] Cotidianul, 2007-05-03&lt;/ref&gt;—possibly because of the poverty in the area. Areas such as Vadul Nou, Zăbrăuți, Prelungirea Ferentari, La Maici are notorious for [[squatting]], and resorting to violence when they are served with eviction notices. Furthermore, when questioned about adequate responses to evictions, or to the police severing illegal connections to the mains, inhabitants of the neighbourhood consider violence as their main weapon, according to a sociological study by [[SNSPA]] .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gandul.info/administratia/violenta-quot-solutia-quot-tuturor-problemelor-zabrauti-271523]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Gândul, 2006-11-21&lt;/ref&gt;

In the said areas, the same article quotes that 84% of the inhabitants tap into the city's electricity grid, and 64% of the inhabitants have no access to sewage, because of their status as squatters, and their inability to sign contracts with the city. As such, the areas developed informal networks stealing power, water and even [[cable TV]] signal directly from the mains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gandul.info/administratia/vasile-tv-278158]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} Gândul, 2007-01-27&lt;/ref&gt; An incident linked with disconnecting illegally connected electricity users sparked the [[2006 Ferentari riot|revolt of 2006]].

However, the bad situation is not limited to the areas above. Other areas, such as the Ferentari Avenue, Salaj Road, are comparable in terms of both development and safety ratings with the rest of the city. The socially disadvantaged Roma, its reputation, and proximity with the undesirable areas, however, makes the whole borough an undesirable place to live in.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Transport==
[[File:Toporași.jpg|thumbnail|The Toporaşi tramway station, 500 meters from Ferentari]]
The area is served by the public transport (tramway and buses).  Calea Ferentarilor prolonged by Prelungirea Ferentarilor is designed to be the connection of [[Bucharest]] to the Bucharest–[[Giurgiu]] highway.

Very little public transport serves the area (3 bus lines and 3 tram lines compared to 11 tram lines, 22 bus lines and 1 trolleybus line in equally sized Rahova). Only one of the bus lines in the borough connects it with the city center, namely line 117 (the official route maps are available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20070621192654/http://www.ratb.ro/eng/map.php]).

The future may, however, bring a great development of the area as there is a lot of spare land around (practically the entire former industrial area which is down), available at low prices, close to the city center and excellent infrastructure{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} although unmaintained. Contributing for this are very low prices and taxes in the area.&lt;ref name="cotidianul.ro"/&gt;

{{US culture}}
Folklore consists of [[legend]]s, music, [[oral history]], [[proverb]]s, [[joke]]s, [[popular belief]]s, [[fairy tale]]s, stories, [[tall tale]]s, and customs that are the [[tradition]]s of a [[culture]], [[subculture]], or group. It is also the set of practices through which those expressive genres are shared. The study of [[folklore]] is sometimes called folkloristics. In usage, there is a continuum between folklore and [[mythology]].

'''American folklore''' encompasses the [[folk tradition]]s that have evolved on the North American continent since Europeans arrived in the 16th century. While it contains much in the way of Native American tradition, it should not be confused with the tribal beliefs of any community of native people.

==Native American folklore==
[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures are rich in myths and legends that explain natural phenomena and the relationship between humans and the spirit world. According to [[Barre Toelken]], feathers, beadwork, dance steps and music, the events in a story, the shape of a dwelling, or items of traditional food can be viewed as icons of cultural meaning.&lt;ref name=Barre&gt;[[Toelken, Barre]].[http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;context=usupress_pubs ''The Anguish of Snails'', Utah State University Press, 2003] {{ISBN|0-87421-555-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native American cultures are numerous and diverse. Though some neighboring cultures hold similar beliefs, others can be quite different from one another. The most common myths are the creation myths, that tell a story to explain how the earth was formed, and where humans and other beings came from. Others may include explanations about the sun, moon, constellations, specific animals, seasons, and weather. This is one of the ways that many tribes have kept, and continue to keep, their cultures alive; these stories are not told simply for entertainment, but as a way of preserving and transmitting the nation, tribe or band's particular beliefs, history, customs, spirituality and traditional way of life. "[S]tories not only entertain but also embody Native behavioral and ethical values."&lt;ref name=Barre/&gt;

There are many different kinds of stories. Some are called "hero stories"; these are stories of people who lived at one time, and who were immortalized and remembered through these tales. There are "trickster stories", about the different trickster figures of the tribes, spirits who may be either helpful or dangerous, depending on the situation. There are also tales that are simply warnings; they warn against doing something that may harm in some way. Many of these tales have morals or some form of belief that is being taught. This is how the things were remembered.

==Founding myths==
The founding of the United States is often surrounded by legends and tall tales. Many stories have developed since the founding long ago to become a part of America's folklore and cultural awareness, and non-Native American folklore especially includes any narrative which has contributed to the shaping of [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] and belief systems. These narratives may be true and may be false or may be a little true and a little false; the veracity of the stories is not a determining factor.

===Christopher Columbus===
[[Christopher Columbus]], as a hero and symbol to the then immigrants, is an important figure in the pantheon of American myth. His status, not unlike most American icons, is representative not of his own accomplishments, but the self-perception of the society which chose him as a hero. Having effected a separation from England and its cultural icons, America was left without history—or heroes on which to base a shared sense of their social selves. [[Washington Irving]] was instrumental in popularizing Columbus. His version of Columbus' life, published in 1829, was more a romance than a biography. The book was very popular, and contributed to an image of the discoverer as a solitary individual who challenged the unknown sea, as triumphant Americans contemplated the dangers and promise of their own wilderness [[frontier]]. As a consequence of his vision and audacity, there was now a land free from kings, a vast continent for new beginnings. In the years following the Revolution the poetic device "Columbia" was used as a symbol of both Columbus and America. King's College of New York changed its name in 1792 to Columbia, and the new capitol in Washington was subtitled District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~CAP/COLUMBUS/col3.html |title='&amp;#39;Columbus in History'&amp;#39; |publisher=Xroads.virginia.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jamestown===
{{Main article|Pocahontas}}
In May 1607, the Susan Constant, the Discovery, and the Godspeed sailed through Chesapeake Bay and thirty miles up the James River settlers built [[Jamestown, Virginia]], England's first permanent colony. Too late in the season to plant crops, many were not accustomed to manual labor. Within a few months, some settlers died of famine and disease. Only thirty-eight made it through their first year in the New World. [[John Smith (explorer)|Captain John Smith]], a pirate turned gentleman turned the settlers into foragers and successful traders with the Native Americans, who taught the English how to plant corn and other crops. Smith led expeditions to explore the regions surrounding Jamestown, and it was during one of these that the chief of the Powhatan Native Americans captured Smith. According to an account Smith published in 1624, he was going to be put to death until the chief's daughter, [[Pocahontas]], saved him. From this the legend of Pocahontas sprang forth, becoming part of American folklore, children's books, and movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGeehan |first=John R. |url=http://www.netplaces.com/american-history/english-french-and-dutch-influences/jamestown-settlement.htm |title=McGeehan, John R., '&amp;#39;Jamestown Settlement |publisher=Netplaces.com |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pilgrims===
[[File:Plymouth Rock Monument cropped.JPG|right|thumb|Plymouth Rock Monument designed for the Tercentenary (1920)]]
[[Plymouth Rock]] is the traditional site of disembarkation of [[William Bradford (Plymouth governor)|William Bradford]] and the [[Mayflower]] Pilgrims who founded Plymouth Colony in 1620, and an important symbol in American history. There are no contemporary references to the Pilgrims' landing on a rock at Plymouth. The first written reference to the Pilgrims landing on a rock is found 121&amp;nbsp;years after they landed. The Rock, or one traditionally identified as it, has long been memorialized on the shore of Plymouth Harbor in Plymouth, Massachusetts. The holiday of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] is said to have begun with the [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]] in 1621.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aspen Design, Westbrook, CT |url=http://www.pilgrimhall.org/f_thanks.htm |title=Pilgrim Hall Museum |publisher=Pilgrimhall.org |date=2012-11-08 |accessdate=2012-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620184539/http://pilgrimhall.org/f_thanks.htm |archivedate=2010-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had come to America to escape religious persecution, but then nearly starved to death. Some friendly Native Americans (including [[Squanto]]) helped the Pilgrims survive through the first winter. The perseverance of the Pilgrims is celebrated during the annual Thanksgiving festival.

===George Washington===
[[George Washington]] (February 22, 1732 – December 14, 1799), the country's first president, is often said to be the father of his country. Apocryphal stories about Washington's childhood include a claim that he skipped a silver dollar across the [[Rappahannock River]] at [[Ferry Farm]]. Another tale claims that as a young child, Washington chopped down his father's cherry tree. His angry father confronted the young Washington, who proclaimed "I can not tell a lie" and admitted to the transgression, thus illuminating his honesty. Parson [[Mason Locke Weems]] mentions the first citation of this legend in his 1806 book, ''The Life of George Washington: With Curious Anecdotes, Equally Honorable to Himself and Exemplary to His Young Countrymen''. This anecdote cannot be independently verified. [[Mark Twain|Samuel Clemens]] (Mark Twain) is also known to have spread the story while lecturing, personalizing it by adding "I have a higher and greater standard of principle. Washington could not lie. I can lie but I won't."

===Patrick Henry===
[[Patrick Henry]] (May 29, 1736 – June 6, 1799) was an attorney, planter and politician who became known as an orator during the movement for independence in Virginia in the 1770s. Patrick Henry is best known for the speech he made in the House of Burgesses on March 23, 1775, in Saint John's Church in Richmond, Virginia. With the House undecided on whether to mobilize for military action against the encroaching British military force, Henry argued in favor of mobilization. Forty-two years later, Henry's first biographer, William Wirt, working from oral histories, tried to reconstruct what Henry said. According to Wirt, Henry ended his speech with words that have since become immortalized: "I know not what course others may take; but as for me, Give me Liberty, or give me Death!" The crowd, by Wirt's account, jumped up and shouted "To Arms! To Arms!". For 160&amp;nbsp;years Wirt's account was taken at face value. In the 1970s, historians began to question the authenticity of Wirt's reconstruction.

[[File:Betsy Ross sewing.jpg|thumb|Betsy Ross sewing]]

===Betsy Ross===
[[Betsy Ross]] (January 1, 1752 – January 30, 1836) is widely credited with making the first American flag. There is, however, no credible historical evidence that the story is true. Research conducted by the National Museum of American History notes that the story of Betsy Ross making the first American flag for General George Washington entered into American consciousness about the time of the 1876 centennial celebrations. In the 2008 book ''The Star-Spangled Banner: The Making of an American Icon'', Smithsonian experts point out that accounts of the event appealed to Americans eager for stories about the revolution and its heroes and heroines. Betsy Ross was promoted as a patriotic role model for young girls and a symbol of women's contributions to American history.

Other Revolutionary War heroes who became figures of American folklore include: [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Nathan Hale]], [[John Hancock]], [[John Paul Jones]] and [[Francis Marion]].

==Tall Tales==
The [[tall tale]] is a fundamental element of American folk literature. The tall tale's origins are seen in the bragging contests that often occurred when men of the [[American frontier]] gathered. A tall tale is a story with unbelievable elements, related as if it were true and factual. Some such stories are exaggerations of actual events; others are completely fictional tales set in a familiar setting, such as the American Old West, or the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. They are usually humorous or good-natured. The line between myth and tall tale is distinguished primarily by age; many myths exaggerate the exploits of their heroes, but in tall tales the exaggeration looms large, to the extent of becoming the whole of the story.

===Based on historical figures===

*[[Johnny Appleseed|John Chapman]] (September 26, 1774 – March 18, 1845), widely known as Johnny Appleseed, was an American pioneer nurseryman who introduced apple trees to large parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. He became an American legend while still alive, largely because of his kind and generous ways, and the symbolic importance he attributed to apples. Johnny Appleseed is remembered in American popular culture by his traveling song or Swedenborgian hymn ("The Lord is good to me...").
*[[Daniel Boone]] (November 2, 1734 [O.S. October 22] – September 26, 1820) was an American pioneer, explorer, and frontiersman whose frontier exploits made him one of the first folk heroes of the United States.
*[[David Crockett|"Davy" Crockett]] (August 17, 1786 – March 6, 1836) was a 19th-century American folk hero, frontiersman, soldier and politician. He is commonly referred to in popular culture by the epithet, "King of the Wild Frontier". He represented Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives, served in the Texas Revolution, and died at the Battle of the Alamo.
*[[Mike Fink]] (c. 1770/1780 – c. 1823) called "king of the keelboaters", was a semi-legendary brawler and river boatman who exemplified the tough and hard-drinking men who ran keelboats up and down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.
*Martha Jane Canary (May 1, 1852 – August 1, 1903), better known as [[Calamity Jane]], was an American frontierswoman, and professional scout best known for her claim of being an acquaintance of [[Wild Bill Hickok]]. She is said to have also exhibited kindness and compassion, especially to the sick and needy. It was from her that [[Bret Harte]] took his famous character of Cherokee Sal in ''The Luck of Roaring Camp''.
*[[Jigger Johnson]] (1871-1935), was a [[lumberjack]] and [[log driving|log driver]] from northern [[New England]] who is known for his numerous off-the-job exploits, such as catching [[bobcats]] alive with his bare hands, and drunken brawls.&lt;ref&gt;''Appalachia'' Appalachian Mountain Club, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monahan, Robert. "Jigger Johnson", ''New Hampshire Profiles magazine'', Northeast Publications, Concord, New Hampshire, April, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] was an African-American railroad worker who is said to have worked as a "steel-driving man"—a man tasked with hammering a steel drill into rock to make holes for explosives to blast the rock away in constructing a railroad tunnel. According to legend, John Henry's prowess as a steel-driver was measured in a race against a steam powered hammer, which he won, only to die in victory with his hammer in his hand and his heart giving out from stress. The "Ballad of John Henry" is a musical rendition of his story.

Other historical figures include Titanic survivor [[Margaret Brown|Molly Brown]], Wild West showman [[Buffalo Bill|Buffalo Bill Cody]], and sharpshooter [[Annie Oakley]].

===Fictional characters===

*[[Paul Bunyan]] is a lumberjack figure in North American folklore and tradition. One of the most famous and popular North American folklore heroes, he is usually described as a giant as well as a lumberjack of unusual skill, and is often accompanied in stories by his animal companion, [[Babe the Blue Ox]]. The character originated in folktales circulated among lumberjacks in the Northeastern United States and eastern Canada, first appearing in print in a story published by Northern Michigan journalist James MacGillivray in 1906.
*The [[Lone Ranger]] is a fictional hero of the west who fought raiders and robbers in the Texas area. The sole survivor of a group of six rangers, he set out to bring the criminals who killed his brother to justice.
*[[John the Conqueror]] also known as High John the Conqueror, and many other folk variants, is a folk hero from African-American folklore. John the Conqueror was an African prince who was sold as a slave in the Americas. Despite his enslavement, his spirit was never broken and he survived in folklore as a sort of a trickster figure, because of the tricks he played to evade his masters. Joel Chandler Harris's 'Br'er Rabbit' of the Uncle Remus stories is said to be patterned after High John the Conqueror.
*[[Pecos Bill]] is an American cowboy, apocryphally immortalized in numerous tall tales of the Old West during American westward expansion into the Southwest of Texas, New Mexico, Southern California, and Arizona
[[File:MOLLY PITCHER. (Ten American Girls from History 1917).jpg|thumb|upright|MOLLY PITCHER. (Ten American Girls from History 1917)]]

*[[Molly Pitcher]] was a nickname given to a woman said to have fought in the American Battle of Monmouth, who is generally believed to have been Mary Ludwig Hays McCauly. Since various Molly Pitcher tales grew in the telling, many historians regard Molly Pitcher as folklore rather than history, or suggest that Molly Pitcher may be a composite image inspired by the actions of a number of real women. The name itself may have originated as a nickname given to women who carried water to men on the battlefield during the war.
*[[Captain Stormalong]] was an American folk hero and the subject of numerous nautical-themed tall tales originating in Massachusetts. Stormalong was said to be a sailor and a giant, some 30&amp;nbsp;feet tall; he was the master of a huge clipper ship known in various sources as either the Courser or the Tuscarora, a ship so tall that it had hinged masts to avoid catching on the moon.

==Legendary and folkloric creatures==

*[[Bigfoot]], also known as "Sasquatch", is the name given to an ape-like creature that some believe inhabit mostly forests in the Pacific Northwest region of, and throughout the entirety of, North America. Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, bipedal humanoid. Generally, scientists discount the existence of Bigfoot due to the impact that it would have on the currently assumed evolutionary lineage of humans, that Homo Sapien is the last remaining species of Hominid. There are more than 100 sightings that are reported yearly.
*[[Champ (cryptozoology)|Champ]] is the name given to a reputed lake monster living in Lake Champlain, a natural freshwater lake in North America. The lake crosses the U.S./Canada border; located partially in the Canadian province of Quebec and partially in the U.S. states of Vermont and New York. There is no scientific evidence for Champ's existence, though there have been over 300 reported sightings.
*[[Jersey Devil|The Jersey Devil]] is a legendary creature said to inhabit the Pine Barrens of Southern New Jersey in the United States. The creature is often described as a flying biped with hooves, but there are many different variations. The most common description is that of a kangaroo-like creature with the face of a horse, the head of a dog, leathery bat-like wings, horns, small arms with clawed hands, cloven hooves and a forked tail. It has been reported to move quickly as to avoid human contact, and often is described as emitting a "blood-curdling scream".
*[[White Lady (ghost)|The White Lady]] is a type of female ghost reportedly seen in rural areas and associated with some local legend of tragedy. Common to many of them is the theme of losing or being betrayed by a husband or fiancé. They are often associated with an individual family line or said to be a harbinger of death, similar to a [[banshee]].
*[[Mothman]] is a mythical half moth half man from Point Pleasant, West Virginia described as a large humanoid with moth features on its face and large wings with fur covering its body. Mothman has been blamed for the collapse of the Silver Bridge.
*[[Hodag]] The Hodag is mythical beast that is said to inhabit the forests of Northern Wisconsin, particularly around the city of Rhinelander. The Hodag has a reptilian body with the horns of a bull, and is said to have a penchant for mischief.

Other folkloric creatures include the fearsome [[Jackalope]], the [[Nain Rouge]] of Detroit, Michigan, [[Wendigo]] of Minnesota and [[Chessie (sea monster)|Chessie]], a legendary sea monster said to live in Chesapeake Bay.

==Literature==
[[Santa Claus]], also known as Saint Nicholas, Father Christmas, or simply "Santa", is a figure with legendary, mythical, historical and folkloric origins. The modern figure of Santa Claus was derived from the Dutch figure, Sinterklaas, which may, in turn, have its origins in the hagiographical tales concerning the Christian Saint Nicholas. "[[A Visit from St. Nicholas]]", also known as "The Night Before Christmas" is a poem first published anonymously in 1823 and generally attributed to Clement Clarke Moore. The poem, which has been called "arguably the best-known verses ever written by an American",&lt;ref name=gotham&gt;[[Edwin G. Burrows|Burrows, Edwin G.]] &amp; [[Mike Wallace (historian)|Wallace, Mike]]. ''[[Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898]]''.  New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. pp. 462-463 {{ISBN|0-19-511634-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; is largely responsible for the conception of Santa Claus from the mid-nineteenth century to today, including his physical appearance, the night of his visit, his mode of transportation, the number and names of his reindeer, as well as the tradition that he brings toys to children. The poem has influenced ideas about St. Nicholas and Santa Claus from the United States to the rest of the English-speaking world and beyond. ''Is There a Santa Claus?'' was the title of an editorial appearing in the September 21, 1897, edition of The (New York) Sun. The editorial, which included the famous reply "[[Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus]]", has become a part of popular Christmas folklore in the United States and Canada.

The [[Headless Horseman (Legend of Sleepy Hollow)|Headless Horseman]] is a fictional character from the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" by American author Washington Irving. The story, from Irving's collection of short stories entitled The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, has worked itself into known American folklore/legend through literature and film.

The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a children's novel written by [[L. Frank Baum]] and illustrated by W. W. Denslow. Originally published by the George M. Hill Company in Chicago on May 17, 1900, it has since been reprinted numerous times, most often under the name The Wizard of Oz, which is the name of both the 1902 stage play and the well-known adaptation 1939 film version, starring Judy Garland. The story chronicles the adventures of a young girl named Dorothy Gale in the Land of Oz, after being swept away from her Kansas farm home in a tornado. Thanks in part to the 1939 MGM movie, it is one of the best-known stories in American popular culture.

==Folk music==
{{Main article|American folk music}}
Native Americans were the earliest inhabitants of the land that is today known as the United States and played its first music. Beginning in the 17th century, immigrants from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Germany and France began arriving in large numbers, bringing with them new styles and instruments. African slaves brought musical traditions, and each subsequent wave of immigrants contributes to a melting pot. Folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival. The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that.

Earliest American scholars were with The American Folklore Society (AFS), which emerged in the late 1800s. Their studies expanded to include Native American music, but still treated folk music as a historical item preserved in isolated societies. In North America, during the 1930s and 1940s, the Library of Congress worked through the offices of traditional music collectors Robert Winslow Gordon, Alan Lomax and others to capture as much North American field material as possible. Lomax was the first prominent scholar to study distinctly American folk music such as that of cowboys and southern blacks. His first major published work was in 1911, Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads, and was arguably the most prominent US folk music scholar of his time, notably during the beginnings of the folk music revival in the 1930s and early 1940s.

The [[American folk music revival]] was a phenomenon in the United States that began during the 1940s and peaked in popularity in the mid-1960s. Its roots went earlier, and performers like [[Burl Ives]], [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Lead Belly]], and [[Oscar Brand]] had enjoyed a limited general popularity in the 1930s and 1940s. The revival brought forward musical styles that had, in earlier times, contributed to the development of country &amp; western, jazz, and rock and roll music.

===African-American music===
Slavery was introduced to the British colonies in the early 17th century. The ancestors of today's African-American population were brought from hundreds of tribes across West Africa, and brought with them certain traits of West African music including call and response vocals and complex rhythmic music, as well as syncopated beats and shifting accents. The African musical focus on rhythmic singing and dancing was brought to the New World, where it became part of a distinct folk culture that helped Africans "retain continuity with their past through music". The first slaves in the United States sang work songs, and field hollers.

====African American Spirituals====
Protestant hymns written mostly by New England preachers became a feature of camp meetings held among devout Christians across the South. When blacks began singing adapted versions of these hymns, they were called [[Negro spirituals]]. It was from these roots, of spiritual songs, work songs and field hollers, that blues, jazz and gospel developed. Negro spirituals were primarily expressions of religious faith.

===Folk songs===
The Thirteen Colonies of the original United States were all former British possessions, and Anglo culture became a major foundation for American folk and popular music. Many American folk songs are identical to British songs in arrangements, but with new lyrics, often as parodies of the original material. Anglo-American traditional music also includes a variety of broadside ballads, humorous stories and tall tales, and disaster songs regarding mining, shipwrecks and murder.

Folk songs may be classified by subject matter, such as: [[drinking songs]], [[sporting song]]s, train songs, [[work song]]s, [[war songs]], and [[ballad]]s.

*[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]'s tune was adapted from an old English drinking song by John Stafford Smith called "To Anacreon in Heaven"
*"[[The Ballad of Casey Jones]]" is a traditional song about railroad engineer Casey Jones and his death at the controls of the train he was driving. It tells of how Jones and his fireman Sim Webb raced their locomotive to make up for lost time, but discovered another train ahead of them on the line, and how Jones remained on board to try to stop the train as Webb jumped to safety.
*"When Johnny Comes Marching Home" (sometimes "When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again") is a popular song of the American Civil War that expressed people's longing for the return of their friends and relatives who were fighting in the war. The Irish anti-war song "Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye" and "When Johnny Comes Marching Home" share the same melodic material. Based on internal textual references, "Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye" apparently dates from the early 1820s, while When Johnny Comes Marching Home was first published in 1863. "Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye" is a popular traditional Irish anti-war and anti-recruiting song. It is generally dated to the early 19th century, when soldiers from Athy, County Kildare served the British East India Company.
*"Oh My Darling, Clementine" (1884) is an American western folk ballad believed to have been based on another song called Down by the River Liv'd a Maiden (1863). The words are those of a bereaved lover singing about his darling, the daughter of a miner in the 1849 California Gold Rush. He loses her in a drowning accident. The song plays during the opening credits for the highly acclaimed [[John Ford]] movie "[[My Darling Clementine]]". It also runs as a background score all through the movie.
*[[The Yellow Rose of Texas (song)|The Yellow Rose of Texas]]  is a traditional folk song. The original love song has become associated with the legend that Emily D. West, a biracial indentured servant, "helped win the Battle of San Jacinto, the decisive battle in the Texas Revolution".
*"[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]" is a 1908 Tin Pan Alley song by Jack Norworth and Albert Von Tilzer which has become the unofficial anthem of baseball, although neither of its authors had attended a game prior to writing the song. The song is traditionally sung during the seventh-inning stretch of a baseball game. Fans are generally encouraged to sing along.

Other American folksongs include: "[[She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain]]", "[[Skewball]]", "[[Big Bad John]]", "[[Stagger Lee (song)|Stagger Lee]]", "[[Camptown Races]]" and "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]".

===Sea shanties===
{{Main article|Sea shanty}}
Work songs sung by sailors between the 18th and 20th centuries are known as sea shanties. The shanty was a distinct type of work song, developed especially in American-style merchant vessels that had come to prominence in decades prior to the American Civil War. These songs were typically performed while adjusting the rigging, raising anchor, and other tasks where men would need to pull in rhythm. These songs usually have a very punctuated rhythm precisely for this reason, along with a call-and-answer format. Well before the 19th century, sea songs were common on rowing vessels. Such songs were also very rhythmic in order to keep the rowers together.

They were notably influenced by songs of African Americans, such as those sung whilst manually loading vessels with cotton in ports of the southern United States. The work contexts in which African-Americans sang songs comparable to shanties included: boat-rowing on rivers of the south-eastern U.S. and Caribbean; the work of stokers or "firemen", who cast wood into the furnaces of steamboats plying great American rivers;and stevedoring on the U.S. eastern seaboard, the Gulf Coast, and the Caribbean—including "cotton-screwing": the loading of ships with cotton in ports of the American South. During the first half of the 19th century, some of the songs African Americans sang also began to appear in use for shipboard tasks, i.e. as shanties.

Shanty repertoire borrowed from the contemporary popular music enjoyed by sailors, including minstrel music, popular marches, and land-based folk songs, which were adapted to suit musical forms matching the various labor tasks required to operate a sailing ship. Such tasks, which usually required a coordinated group effort in either a pulling or pushing action, included weighing anchor and setting sail.

*"Poor Paddy Works on the Railway" is a popular Irish and American folk song. Historically, it was often sung as a sea chanty. The song portrays an Irish worker working on a railroad. There are numerous titles of the song including, "Pat Works on the Railway" and "Paddy on the Railway". "Paddy Works on the Erie" is another version of the song. "Paddy on the Railway" is attested as a chanty in the earliest known published work to use the word "chanty", G. E. Clark's ''Seven Years of a Sailor's Life'' (1867). Clark recounted experiences fishing on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, in a vessel out of Provincetown, Mass. ca. 1865-6. At one point, the crew is getting up the anchor in a storm, by means of a pump-style windlass. One of the chanties the men sing while performing this task is mentioned by title, "Paddy on the Railway".

===Shaker music===
{{Shaker music}}
The [[Shakers]] is a religious sect founded in 18th-century England upon the teachings of [[Ann Lee]]. Shakers today are most known for their cultural contributions (especially style of music and furniture). The Shakers composed thousands of songs, and also created many dances; both were an important part of the Shaker worship services. In Shaker society, a [[Era of Manifestations|spiritual "gift"]] could also be a musical revelation, and they considered it important to record musical inspirations as they occurred. "[[Simple Gifts]]" was composed by Elder [[Joseph Brackett]] and originated in the [[Alfred Shaker Historic District|Alfred Shaker community]] in Maine in 1848. [[Aaron Copland]]'s iconic 1944 ballet score [[Appalachian Spring]], uses the now famous Shaker tune "Simple Gifts" as the basis of its finale.

==Folk dancing==
Folk dances of British origin include the square dance, descended from the quadrille, combined with the American innovation of a caller instructing the dancers. The religious communal society known as the Shakers emigrated from England during the 18th century and developed their own folk dance style.

==Locations and landmarks==
*the "Lost Colony" of Roanoke Island: In 1587, Sir Walter Raleigh recruited over 100 men, women and children to journey from England to Roanoke Island on North Carolina's coast and establish the first English settlement in America under the direction of John White as governor. [[Virginia Dare]] (born August 18, 1587) was the first child born in the Americas to English parents, Ananias and Eleanor White Dare in the short-lived Roanoke Colony. The fact of her birth is known because the governor of the settlement, Virginia Dare's grandfather, John White, returned to England in 1587 to seek fresh supplies. When White eventually returned three years later, Virginia and the other colonists were gone. During the past four hundred years, Virginia Dare has become a prominent figure in American myth and folklore, symbolizing different things to different groups of people. She is the subject of a poem (''Peregrine White and Virginia Dare'') by Rosemary and [[Stephen Vincent Benet]], and the North Carolina ''Legend of the White Doe''. While often cited as an Indian legend, the white doe seems to have its roots in English folklore. White deer are common in English legends and often used as symbols of Christian virtue. A similar story of a young girl transformed into a white deer can be found in Yorkshire, where it formed the basis for Wordsworth's poem ''[[The White Doe of Rylstone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northcarolinaghosts.com/coast/virginia-dare-white-doe.php |title='&amp;#39;Legend of the White Doe'&amp;#39; |publisher=Northcarolinaghosts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the four centuries since their disappearance, the Roanoke colonists have been the subject of a mystery that still challenges historians and archaeologists as one of America's oldest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coastalguide.com/packet/lostcolony-croatan.shtml |title=Hause, Eric '&amp;#39;The Lost Colony'&amp;#39; |publisher=Coastalguide.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Times Square]] is a major commercial intersection in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, at the junction of Broadway and Seventh Avenue and stretching from West 42nd to West 47th Streets. Times Square – iconified as "The Crossroads of the World" is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway [[Theater District]]. Formerly Longacre Square, Times Square was renamed in April 1904 after The New York Times moved its headquarters to the newly erected Times Building site of the annual ball drop on New Year's Eve. The northern triangle of Times Square is technically Duffy Square, dedicated in 1937 to Chaplain Francis P. Duffy of New York City's "Fighting 69th" Infantry Regiment; a memorial to Duffy is located there, along with a statue of George M. Cohan. The Duffy Statue and the square were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.
[[File:Empirestatebuildingfrombrooklynnewyork.jpg|thumb|upright|The Empire State Building]]

*[[Empire State Building]] is a 102-story skyscraper located in New York City at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and West 34th Street. Its name is derived from the nickname for New York, the Empire State. It stood as the world's tallest building for 40&amp;nbsp;years, from its completion in 1931. The Empire State Building is generally thought of as an American cultural icon. The project involved 3,400 workers, mostly immigrants from Europe, along with hundreds of Mohawk iron workers, many from the Kahnawake reserve near Montreal. Perhaps the most famous popular culture representation of the building is in the 1933 film King Kong, in which the title character, a giant ape, climbs to the top to escape his captors but falls to his death after being attacked by airplanes. The 1957 romantic drama film An Affair to Remember involves a couple who plan to meet atop the Empire State Building, a rendezvous that is averted by an automobile accident. The 1993 film Sleepless in Seattle, a romantic comedy partially inspired by An Affair to Remember, climaxes with a scene at the Empire State observatory.

Other locations and landmarks that have become part of American folklore include: [[Independence Hall]], [[Monument Valley]], [[Ellis Island]], [[Hoover Dam]], [[Pearl Harbor]], the [[Vietnam War Memorial]], and the [[Grand Canyon]].

==Cultural icons==

*The [[Liberty Bell]] is an iconic symbol of American independence, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The bell was commissioned from the London firm of Lester and Pack in 1752, and was cast with the lettering (part of Leviticus 25:10) "Proclaim LIBERTY throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof." In the 1830s, the bell was adopted as a symbol by abolitionist societies, who dubbed it the "Liberty Bell". It acquired its distinctive large crack sometime in the early 19th century—a widespread story claims it cracked while ringing after the death of Chief Justice John Marshall in 1835.
*[[Statue of Liberty]] The Statue of Liberty is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, designed by Frédéric Bartholdi and dedicated on October 28, 1886. The statue, a gift to the United States from the people of France, is of a robed female figure representing Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom, who bears a torch and a tablet upon which is inscribed the date of the American Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776. The statue is an icon of freedom and of the United States: a welcoming signal to immigrants arriving from abroad.
*[[Uncle Sam]] (initials U.S.) is a common national personification of the American government and came into use during the War of 1812. According to legend, Samuel Wilson, a meat packer in New York, supplied rations for the soldiers and stamped the letters U.S. on the boxes, which stood for United States but was jokingly said to be the initials of Uncle Sam. An Uncle Sam is mentioned as early as 1775, in the original "Yankee Doodle" lyrics of the Revolutionary War {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. The earliest known personification of what would become the United States was "[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]", who first appeared in 1738 and sometimes was associated with liberty. With the American Revolutionary War came "Brother Jonathan" as another personification and finally after the War of 1812 Uncle Sam appeared.

Other Cultural Icons include, [[Rosie the Riveter]], the [[United States Constitution]], the [[Colt Single Action Army]], [[Smokey Bear]], the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]], [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] and [[Apple Pie]].

==History==
Historical events that form a part of American folklore include: [[9/11]], [[Boston Massacre]], [[Boston Tea Party]], [[Paul Revere#The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere|Paul Revere's Ride]], the [[Battle of the Alamo]], the [[Salem witch trials]], [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]], [[California Gold Rush]], [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy]], and the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]].

==Plot==
Klaus, a former [[Nazi]] doctor, practiced horrific, [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] experiments on children during [[World War II]]. After the war, he goes into exile in a remote village in [[Catalonia]], where he continues to rape and torture young boys. He kills his latest victim with a blow to the head, taking photographs of the crime. Angelo, one of Klaus' victims, spies on him from a window, and steals incriminating writings and photographs of the doctor's crimes. Klaus tries to commit suicide by jumping from a tower. He survives, but he is left paralyzed and unable to breathe on his own, confined permanently in an iron lung to survive.  
                                                                                             
Some years later, Klaus is being taken care of by his wife Griselda and their young daughter Rena in a large gloomy house in the country. Griselda is unhappy in Spain and, overwhelmed by the task of looking after her husband, secretly wishes he would just die. Angelo appears, offering his services as a nurse to help take care of Klaus. Griselda takes an instant dislike towards Angelo and does not want to hire him, but Klaus insists that he should stay. In reality, Angelo has no actual nursing skills, which Griselda soon discovers, but even then Klaus refuses to get rid of him. Angelo's true aim is revealed to be not only to take his revenge out on Klaus, but to ultimately take his place as a torturer. Angelo reads Klaus passages from the diaries he stole in which the doctor describes, in detail, how he tortured his victims. Recreating what Klaus did to him, Angelo strips and masturbates in front of Klaus. He then calls Griselda. She tries to run away, but he kills her, hanging her from the rails of the second floor.

The next day, Angelo fires the housekeeper, taking over the house with Rena's help. Rena is not disturbed by her mother's absence, as Griselda was abusive towards her. Rena feels far more comfortable under Angelo's care. Angelo continues with the doctor's experiments, bringing young boys to Klaus in his iron lung. Angelo lures a child to the house and ties him to a chair. In front of Klaus, Angelo kills the boy by injecting him through the heart with a needle filled with gasoline. He brings in another boy, forces him to sing and kills him by cutting his throat. Fearing that Angelo will kill him and Rena, Klaus tells his daughter to run away to the near village with a message asking for help.

Angelo discovers Rena while she is trying to escape and brings her back to the house. He dominates her, assuming a perverse, violent "parental" role. Finally Angelo removes Klaus from his iron lung and lets him die of asphyxiation while emulating the scene of his own abuse, in Rena's presence. Once Klaus is dead, Angelo takes his identity totally, getting into the artificial lung, and makes Rena take his.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2225">[[Image:Moneyfrog.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A three-legged money toad]]
The '''Jin Chan''' ({{zh|c=金蟾|p=jīn chán|l=Golden Toad}}), also called '''Chan Chu''' ({{zh|c=蟾蜍|p=chánchú|l=Toad}}) or "Zhaocai Chan Chu" ({{zh|c=招财蟾蜍|p=zhāocái chánchú|l=wealth-beckoning toad}}), is most commonly translated as "Money Toad" or "Money Frog". It represents a popular [[Feng Shui]] charm for prosperity.

This mythical creature is said to appear during the full moon, near houses or businesses that will soon receive good news (most of the time, the nature of this good news is understood to be wealth-related). 

The money toad is associated with [[Liu Haichan]], as the [[sennin]]'s animal companion. 

The ''Jin Chan'' is usually depicted as a [[Chinese edible frog|bullfrog]] with red eyes, flared nostrils and only one hind leg (for a total of three legs), sitting on a pile of traditional [[Cash (Chinese coin)|Chinese cash]], with a coin in its mouth. On its back, it often displays seven diamond spots . According to Feng Shui beliefs, Jin Chan helps attract and protect wealth, and guards against bad luck. Because it symbolizes the flow of money, Feng Shui lore insists that a Jin Chan statue should not be positioned facing the main door ("outward"). It also "should never be kept in the bathroom, bedroom, dining room or kitchen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keral.com/Realestate/The-Three-Legged-Money-Frog-Some-Dos-and-Donts.html |title=The Three-Legged Money Frog: Some Dos and Don'ts |accessdate=22 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128051445/http://www.keral.com/Realestate/The-Three-Legged-Money-Frog-Some-Dos-and-Donts.html |archivedate=November 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{globalize/Eng|date=January 2017}}
A '''ladies' night''' is a [[Promotion (marketing)|promotional event]], often at a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] or [[nightclub]], where female patrons pay less than male patrons for the [[cover charge]] or [[drinks]]. In the United States, state courts in [[California]], [[Maryland]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Wisconsin]] have ruled that ladies' night discounts are unlawful [[Gender-based price discrimination in the United States|gender-based price discrimination]] under state or local statutes. However, courts in [[Illinois]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] have rejected a variety of challenges to such discounts.

== Legality in the United States ==
{{Main|Gender-based price discrimination in the United States}}
=== Federal law ===
Claims against ladies' nights under the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] have failed under the [[State action (United States constitutional law)|state action doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hollander v. Swindells-Donovan'', 2010 WL 844588 (E.D.N.Y. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Similar actions have failed under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] (42 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;1983).&lt;ref&gt;''Hollander v. Copacabana Nightclub'', 580 F.Supp.2d 335 (S.D.N.Y. 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Comiskey v. JFTJ Corp.'', 989 F.2d 1007 (8th Cir. 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Ladies' nights may have federal tax implications, though.&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. v. Covey Gas &amp; Oil'', 171 F.2d 213 (10th Cir. 1949).&lt;/ref&gt; Federal claims were also involved in the unsuccessful challenge in Washington (''see below'').

=== California ===
The [[California Supreme Court]] has ruled that ladies' days at a [[car wash]] and ladies' nights at a [[nightclub]] violate California's [[Unruh Civil Rights Act]] in ''Koire v Metro Car Wash'' (1985)&lt;ref name="koire"&gt;''Koire v Metro Car Wash'', 707 P.2d 195 (CA 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Angelucci v. Century Supper Club'' (2007).&lt;ref name="angelucci"&gt;''Angelucci v. Century Supper Club'', 158 P.3d 718 (CA 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Unruh Act provides: "All persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their sex [...] are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever [...]."&lt;ref name="koire" /&gt; The court considered the statutory defense that the promotions serve "substantial business and social purposes", but concluded that merely being profitable is not a sufficient defense.&lt;ref name="koire" /&gt; The court accused the Wisconsin Supreme Court of "sexual stereotyping" for upholding a similar practice.&lt;ref name="koire" /&gt;

Koire held that: "Public policy in California strongly supports eradication of discrimination based on sex. The Unruh Act expressly prohibits sex discrimination by business enterprises."&lt;ref name="koire" /&gt; Koire concluded:
:"The legality of sex-based price discounts cannot depend on the subjective value judgments about which types of sex-based distinctions are important or harmful.  The express language of the Unruh Act provides a clear and objective standard by which to determine the legality of the practices at issue.  The Legislature has clearly stated that business establishments must provide "equal . . . advantages . . . [and] privileges" to all customers "no matter what their sex." (§&amp;nbsp;51.) Strong public policy supports application of the Act in this case.  The defendants have advanced no convincing argument that this court should carve out a judicial exception for their sex-based price discounts. The straightforward proscription of the Act should be respected."&lt;ref name="koire" /&gt;

Subsequent to the decision, California passed the Gender Tax Repeal Act of 1995, which specifically prohibits differential pricing based solely on a customer's gender.&lt;ref name="nv"&gt;Eric D. Hone and Franchesca Van Buren, "Is the Death Knell Ringing for Ladies' Nights?" ''Nevada Lawyer'' (March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In Angelucci, the California Supreme Court ruled that discrimination victims did not have to ask the offending business to be treated equally in order to have standing to file an Unruh Act or Gender Tax Repeal Act claim.

Courts have not found violations on the Unruh Act with discounts for which any customer could theoretically qualify for.&lt;ref&gt;''Starkman v. Mann Theatres Corp.'', 227 Cal.App.3d 1491 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The California Supreme Court opined:
:"A multitude of promotional discounts come to mind which are clearly permissible under the Unruh Act. For example, a business establishment might offer reduced rates to all customers on one day each week. Or, a business might offer a discount to any customer who meets a condition which any patron could satisfy (e.g., presenting a coupon, or sporting a certain color shirt or a particular bumper sticker). In addition, nothing prevents a business from offering discounts for purchasing commodities in quantity, or for making advance reservations. The key is that the discounts must be “applicable alike to persons of every sex, color, race, [etc.]” ( §&amp;nbsp;51), instead of being contingent on some arbitrary, class-based generalization."&lt;ref name="koire" /&gt;

The ''Koire'' precedent has not been extended to strike down [[Mother's Day]] promotions.&lt;ref&gt;''Cohn v. Corinthian Colleges, Inc.'', 169 Cal.App.4th 523 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Koire'' was one of the precedents cited in the lower court (but not the state Supreme Court) in ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]''

=== Illinois ===
Ladies' nights in Illinois have been upheld under the anti-discrimination provision of the [[Dram Shop Act]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dock Club, Inc. v. Illinois Liquor Control Commission'', 404 N.E.2d 1050 (Ill. App. 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; The court determined that the discount was intended to encourage women to attend the bar in greater numbers, rather than to discourage attendance by males.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Theuman, "Exclusion of one sex from admission to or enjoyment of equal privileges in places of accommodation or entertainment as actionable sex discrimination under state law" 38 A.L.R.4th 339 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maryland ===
Montgomery County's human relations law has been interpreted to not only prohibit ladies' nights, but also a "Skirt and Gown Night" where a customer is given a 50% discount for wearing a skirt or gown.&lt;ref name="peppin"&gt;''Peppin v. Woodside Delicatessen'', 506 A.2d 263 (MD App. 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; The court noted that: "Against this superficially humorous backdrop, we must decide whether this seemingly innocuous business practice constitutes unlawful discrimination within the meaning of a county ordinance."&lt;ref name="peppin" /&gt; The Montgomery County Code, Human Relations Law, §&amp;nbsp;27-9, prohibited:
:"[...] any distinction with respect to any person based on race, color, sex, marital status, religious creed, ancestry, national origin, handicap, or sexual orientation in connection with admission to, service or sales in, or price, quality or use of any facility or service of any place of public accommodation, resort or amusement in the county."&lt;ref name="peppin" /&gt;
The Maryland's appellate court's review was far from ''[[wikt:de novo|de novo]]'' and the court emphasized that:
:"Although we believe the judge's findings to be contradicted by American cultural realities, we need not focus on the circuit court's determination; our review is that of the agency's conclusion based upon facts presented at the hearing. The record is replete with evidence that Skirt and Gown Night was intended to-and did-have the same effect and serve the same function as Ladies' Night, i.e. it provided price discounts to women and, in fact, operated as a mere extension of Ladies' Night."&lt;ref name="peppin" /&gt;
The court also stressed the peculiarity and strictness of the municipal ordinance it was interpreting:
:"We believe the ordinance is unambiguous. Thus, while allowed to do so under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, we are not allowed under the Montgomery County Ordinance or the Maryland Constitution to engage in a balancing test."&lt;ref name="peppin" /&gt;

=== Minnesota ===
Attempts by municipal governments to prevent ladies' nights have been struck down as ''[[ultra vires]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''In re On-Sale Liquor License, Class B.'', 763 N.W.2d 359 (Minn. App. 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2010 the Minnesota Department of Human Rights said bars are discriminating against males by holding "ladies' night" promotions, but said it will not seek out bars that have a "ladies night."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2010/06/11/ladies-night/ |title=Human rights officials: Ladies' nights discriminatory |publisher=[[Minnesota Public Radio]] |date=2010-06-11 |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nevada ===
In 2008, the Nevada Equal Rights Commission ruled in favor of a man who claimed a local gym offering free memberships to women was discriminatory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/nov/10/ruling-gyms-have-big-effect-nightclubs-too/&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling is thought to have had wide ramifications for ladies' night promotions across the state.

Although the question has not been litigated in Nevada courts, two Nevada attorneys advise: "for the time being, businesses should exercise caution in utilizing gender-based pricing scheme promotions. While the ability of a plaintiff to succeed on such a claim in district court remains unknown, [[Nevada Equal Rights Commission|NERC]] has the ability to pursue such claims on the administrative level. Therefore, businesses should engage in a cost-benefit analysis, keeping in mind that they might have to spend time and resources defending a sex discrimination charge in front of NERC or elsewhere."&lt;ref name="nv" /&gt;

=== New Jersey ===
In 2004, the director of New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety Division of Civil rights ruled that ladies' night promotions constituted unlawful discrimination in violation of the state's Law Against Discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wickham|first1=DeWayne|title='Ladies Night' ban in N.J. sends the wrong message|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnist/wickham/2004-06-07-wickham_x.htm|accessdate=3 January 2016|agency=USA Today|date=7 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Administrative Action Findings, Determination and Order|url=http://www.state.nj.us/lps/Gillespie.Order.06.01.04.html|website=www.state.nj.us|publisher=State of New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New York ===
The [[New York State Human Rights Appeal Board]] disapproved of a [[New York Yankees]] "Ladies Day" promotion, which originated in 1876 as being "in a modern technological society where women and men are to be on equal footing as a matter of public policy."&lt;ref&gt;''Abosh v. New York Yankees, Inc.'' (1972) No. CPS-25284, Appeal No. 1194.&lt;/ref&gt;{{huh|date=October 2012}}

=== Pennsylvania ===
Such promotions violate the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act as unlawful gender discrimination where male patrons are charged an entrance fee or a greater charge for drinks and female patrons are not charged an identical entrance fee or the same charge for drinks as male patrons.  In ''Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board v. Dobrinoff'', the Commonwealth Court specifically found that where a female patron was exempt from a cover charge, a go-go bar engaged in unlawful gender discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6409561572180021245 80 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 453 (1984)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board has stated as recently as 2009 that it will issue citations against establishments which charge patrons differing amounts based on gender.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcbapps.lcb.state.pa.us/webapp/legal/PublicAdvOpnDisplay.asp?opinion_year=2009&amp;opinion_sequence=261 See Liquor Control Board Advisory Opinion of July 9, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324152532/http://www.lcbapps.lcb.state.pa.us/webapp/legal/PublicAdvOpnDisplay.asp?opinion_year=2009&amp;opinion_sequence=261 |date=March 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Washington ===
Ladies' nights have been found not to violate state anti-discrimination law, or the federal constitution, by the [[Washington Supreme Court]], even if held at a stadium owned by a city.&lt;ref name="maclean"&gt;''MacLean v. First Northwest Industries of America, Inc.'', 635 P.2d 683 (WA 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; The Washington Supreme Court concluded that "the respondent has shown no discrimination against men as a class and no damage to himself. As a consequence he has no right of action under the state Law Against Discrimination. "&lt;ref name="maclean" /&gt; In part, the court emphasized in its ruling evidence presented in the trial court that "women do not manifest the same interest in basketball that men do," and that the discount was only one of many discounts and promotions, the others available regardless of gender.&lt;ref name="maclean" /&gt; Finally, the majority noted that "to decide important constitutional questions upon a complaint as sterile as this would be apt to erode public respect for the Equal Rights Amendment and deter rather than promote the serious goals for which it was adopted."&lt;ref name="maclean" /&gt;

The dissenting justices emphasized their broader interpretation of the applicable prohibition and the potential for such promotions to reinforce stereotypes.&lt;ref name="maclean" /&gt; One dissenting justice proposed that the complainant be allowed no damages, but only that the practice be enjoined.&lt;ref name="maclean" /&gt; The dissent concluded:
:"It may be that application of the Equal Rights Amendment to the “promotional” activity of defendant is not the sort of thing the voters had in mind when they adopted HJR 61. Then again, an equally persuasive argument could be made that ticket price differentials based on sex were indeed one of a number of activities which they hoped to end. It is idle to speculate. No evidence of any kind exists. I see no escape from finding in this case that the plain language of Const. art. 31 proscribes the activity in which the defendants have engaged. Any further clarification of popular intent must come through the process of constitutional amendment, not by the imaginings of this court. Const. art. 23."&lt;ref name="maclean" /&gt;

=== Wisconsin ===
The [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] has held that such promotions violate the state's [[public accommodation]] law.&lt;ref name="novak"&gt;''Novak v. Madison Motel Associates'', 525 N.W.2d 123 (Wis. App. 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; The court noted that the text and [[legislative history]] of the statute permitted no distinction between sex, race, and other forms of discrimination.&lt;ref name="novak" /&gt;

== Legality in the United Kingdom ==

'''Language change''' is variation over time in a [[language]]'s  [[Phonology|phonological]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], [[Semantics|semantic]], [[Syntax|syntactic]], and other features. It is studied by [[historical linguistics]] and [[evolutionary linguistics]]. Some commentators use the label '''corruption''' to suggest that language change constitutes a degradation in the quality of a language, especially when the change originates from human error or [[Prescription (linguistics)|prescriptively]] discouraged usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=John |title=Introduction to Theoretical Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGkkjkLPZkoC&amp;pg=PA42|date=1 June 1968|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-09510-5|page=42|quote=The traditional grammarian tended to assume [...] that it was his task, as a grammarian, to 'preserve' this form of language from 'corruption'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Descriptive linguistics]] typically does not support this concept, since from a descriptive point of view such changes are neither good nor bad.

==Causes==
* Economy: Speakers tend to make their utterances as efficient and effective as possible to reach communicative goals.  Purposeful speaking therefore involves a trade-off of costs and benefits.
** The [[principle of least effort]] tends to result in phonetic reduction of speech forms. See [[vowel reduction]], [[cluster reduction]], [[lenition]], and [[elision]]. After some time a change may become widely accepted (it becomes a regular [[sound change]]) and may end up treated as a standard. For instance: ''going to'' {{IPA|[ˈɡoʊ.ɪŋ.tʊ]}} → ''gonna'' {{IPA|[ˈɡɔnə]}} or {{IPA|[ˈɡʌnə]}}, with examples of both vowel reduction {{IPA|[ʊ] → [ə]}} and elision {{IPA|[nt] → [n]}}, {{IPA|[oʊ.ɪ] → [ʌ]}}.
* [[Analogy#Linguistics|Analogy]]: reducing word forms by likening different forms of the word to the root.
* [[Language contact]]: borrowing of words and constructions from other languages.&lt;ref name="llas.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llas.ac.uk/resources/gpg/2784|title=The teaching of pidgin and Creole studies - LLAS Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Geographic separation: when people move away from each other, their language will diverge, at least for the vocabulary, due to different experiences.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language'' (1997, p. 335)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Culture|Cultural environment]]: Groups of speakers will reflect new places, situations, and objects in their language, whether they encounter different people there or not.
* Migration/Movement:  Speakers will change and create languages, such as pidgins and creoles.&lt;ref name="llas.ac.uk"/&gt;
* Imperfect learning: According to one view, children regularly learn the adult forms imperfectly, and the changed forms then turn into a new standard. Alternatively, imperfect learning occurs regularly in one part of society, such as an immigrant group, where the minority language forms a [[substratum]], and the changed forms can ultimately influence majority usage.&lt;ref name=Cambridge/&gt;
* Social prestige: Language may not only change towards a prestigious accent, but also away from one with negative prestige,&lt;ref name=Cambridge/&gt; as in the case of [[Rhoticity in English|rhoticity of Received Pronunciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dialectblog.com/2012/10/07/was-received-pronunciation-ever-rhotic/|title=Was Received Pronunciation Ever Rhotic?|first=|last=Ben|date=7 October 2012|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such movements can go back and forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionaryblog.com/the-fall-of-the-r-less-class|title=The fall of the r-less class - Macmillan|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Guy Deutscher (linguist)|Guy Deutscher]], the tricky question is "Why are changes not brought up short and stopped in their tracks? At first sight, there seem to be all the reasons in the world why society should never let the changes through." He sees the reason for tolerating change in the fact that we already are used to "[[Variety (linguistics)|synchronic variation]]", to the extent that we are hardly aware of it. For example, when we hear the word "wicked", we automatically interpret it as either "evil" or "wonderful", depending on whether it is uttered by an elderly lady or a teenager. Deutscher speculates that "[i]n a hundred years' time, when the original meaning of 'wicked' has all but been forgotten, people may wonder how it was ever possible for a word meaning 'evil' to change its sense to 'wonderful' so quickly."&lt;ref name="Deutscher"&gt;The Unfolding of Language, 2005, chapter 2, esp. pp. 63, 69 and 71&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
All languages change continually,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lexical changes===
The study of lexical changes forms the [[Historical linguistics|diachronic]] portion of the science of [[onomasiology]].

The ongoing influx of new words into the [[English language]] (for example) helps make it a rich field for investigation into language change, despite the difficulty of defining precisely and accurately the vocabulary available to speakers of English. Throughout [[History of the English language|its history]] English has not only [[loanword|borrowed words]] from other languages but has re-combined and recycled them to create new meanings, whilst [[Changes to Old English vocabulary|losing some old words]].

[[lexicographer|Dictionary-writers]] try to keep track of the changes in languages by recording (and, ideally, dating) the appearance in a language of new words, or of new usages for existing words. By the same token, they may tag some words eventually as "archaic" or "obsolete".

===Phonetic and phonological changes===
{{Main|Sound change|Phonological change}}

The concept of [[sound change]] covers both phonetic and [[phonology|phonological]] developments.

The sociolinguist [[William Labov]] recorded the change in [[pronunciation]] in a relatively short period in the American resort of [[Martha's Vineyard]] and showed how this resulted from social tensions and processes.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | last1 = Labov | first1 = William 
| year = 1963 | title = The social motivation of a sound change | url = 
| journal = Word | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 273–309 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Even in the relatively short time that broadcast media have recorded their work, one can observe the difference between the [[Received pronunciation|pronunciation]] of the newsreaders of the 1940s and the 1950s and the pronunciation of today. The greater acceptance and fashionability of [[regional accents]] in  media may{{Original research inline|date=September 2009}} also reflect a more democratic, less formal society — compare the widespread adoption of [[language policy|language policies]].

The mapping and recording of small-scale phonological changes poses difficulties, especially as the practical technology of [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] dates only from the 19th century. Written texts provide the main (indirect) evidence of how language sounds have changed over the centuries. But note [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s work on postulating the existence and disappearance of [[laryngeal theory|laryngeals]] in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] as an example of other methods of detecting/reconstructing sound-changes within historical linguistics. Poetic devices such as rhyme and rhythm may provide clues to previous phonological habits.

===Spelling changes===

Standardisation of [[spelling]] originated relatively recently.{{Vague|date=October 2016}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}  Differences in spelling often catch the eye of a reader of a text from a previous century.  The pre-print era had fewer [[literacy|literate]] people: languages lacked fixed systems of orthography, and the handwritten manuscripts that survive often show words spelled according to regional pronunciation and to personal preference.
&lt;!--- These paragraphs might belong in the entry on [[English orthography]], but it's not clear at all what they have to do with spelling changes over time in languages in general

The development of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century, however, presented printers with dilemmas of standardisation: texts from the fifteenth through to the seventeenth centuries show many internal inconsistencies, with the same word often spelled differently within the same text.  Writers contributed to the variety: famously, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] spelled his own name in many different ways.  Additionally, typesetters sometimes selected various spellings based on [[typographical]] criteria, such as aiming for uniform line-lengths when assembling type pieces on a composing stick.  As typesetters found it easier to make one of the lines of type longer than to make the other lines shorter, word lengths tended to standardize on the longer spellings.

Modern English spellings do not result from a single consistent system; rather, they show evidence of previous pronunciations which changed over time. For example, the spelling of words such as "night" hints at an older pronunciation, the "gh" representing a sound similar to that conveyed by "ch" in the Scottish pronunciation of ''loch''. Other examples include the "k"-sound once pronounced in words like "knee" or "knight", and the "ch" in "chicken" or "cheese", which English-speakers once pronounced as 'k'. Note too the use of hard [[yer]]s in older Russian orthography, and phasing out of 'th' in favour of 't' in many German words in the [[{{ill|de|Orthographische Konferenz von 1876}} | spelling reforms of 1876]].

One could regard many of the conventions of English spelling as stuck in the 15th century: [[William Caxton]] (died ca. 1492) chose the [[East Midlands English|East Midland dialect]] (specifically the [[London]] variety) of English as the basis for his first printed English-language work in 1476. He had to discriminate against many synonyms used in other areas of England (such as [[East Anglia]], [[Northumberland]] and [[Mercia]]). For example, Caxton's public found the Southern word "eyren" mutually unintelligible with the Northern equivalent, "egges" (modern English: "eggs").
--&gt;

===Semantic changes===
{{Main|Semantic change}}

Semantic changes are shifts in the meanings of existing words. Basic types of semantic change include:
* [[pejoration]], in which a term's connotations become more negative
* amelioration, in which a term's connotations become more positive
* broadening, in which a term acquires additional potential uses
* narrowing, in which a term's potential uses are restricted

After a word enters a language, its meaning can change as through a shift in the [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of its connotations. As an example, when "villain" entered English it meant 'peasant' or 'farmhand', but acquired the connotation 'low-born' or 'scoundrel', and today only the negative use survives. Thus 'villain' has undergone [[pejoration]]. Conversely, the word "wicked" is undergoing amelioration in colloquial contexts, shifting from its original sense of 'evil', to the much more positive one {{as of | 2009 | lc = on}} of 'brilliant'.

Words' meanings may also change in terms of the breadth of their semantic domain. Narrowing a word limits its alternative meanings, whereas broadening associates new meanings with it. For example, "hound" ([[Old English]] ''hund'') once referred to any dog, whereas in modern English it denotes only a particular type of [[canid]]. On the other hand, the word "dog" has been broadened from its Old English root 'dogge', the name of a particular breed, to become the general term for all canines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Historical Linguistics|last=Crowley|first=Terry|last2=Bowern|first2=Claire|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=0195365542|location=New York, NY|pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syntactic change===
{{Main|Syntactic change}}

[[Syntactic change]] is the evolution of the [[syntax|syntactic]] structure of a [[natural language]].

Over time, syntactic change is the greatest modifier of a particular language.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Massive changes – attributable either to [[creolization]] or to [[relexification]] – may occur both in syntax and in vocabulary. Syntactic change can also be purely language-internal, whether independent within the syntactic component or the eventual result of phonological or morphological change.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Sociolinguistics==

The [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguist]] Jennifer Coates, following William Labov, describes linguistic change as occurring in the context of linguistic [[heterogeneity]]. She explains that "[l]inguistic change can be said to have taken place when a new linguistic form, used by some sub-group within a speech community, is adopted by other members of that community and accepted as the norm."&lt;ref&gt;Coates, 1992: 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Can and Patton (2010) provide a quantitative analysis of twentieth century Turkish literature using forty novels of forty authors. Using weighted least squares regression and a sliding window approach, they show that, as time passes, words, in terms of both tokens (in text) and types (in vocabulary), have become longer. They indicate that the increase in word lengths with time can be attributed to the government-initiated language "reform" of the 20th century. This reform aimed at replacing foreign words used in Turkish, especially Arabic- and Persian-based words (since they were in majority when the reform was initiated in early 1930s), with newly coined pure Turkish neologisms created by adding suffixes to Turkish word stems (Lewis, 1999).

Can and Patton (2010), based on their observations of the change of a specific word use (more specifically in newer works the preference of ''ama'' over ''fakat'', both borrowed from Arabic and meaning 'but', and their inverse usage correlation is statistically significant), also speculate that the word length increase can influence the common word choice preferences of authors.

==Quantification==
Altintas, Can, and Patton (2007) introduce a systematic approach to language change quantification by studying unconsciously-used language features in time-separated parallel translations. For this purpose, they use objective style markers such as vocabulary richness and lengths of words, word stems and suffixes, and employ statistical methods to measure their changes over time.

==Language shift and social status==
{{main|Language shift}}
Languages perceived to be "higher status" stabilise or spread at the expense of other languages perceived by their own speakers to be "lower-status".

Historical examples are the early Welsh and Lutheran Bible translations, leading to the liturgical languages Welsh and High German thriving today, unlike other Celtic or German variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For prehistory, Forster and Renfrew (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Forster P, Renfrew C |year=2011 |title=Mother tongue and Y chromosomes | url= http://www.rootsforreal.com/press_en.php | journal=Science | volume=333 |pages=1390–1391 | bibcode=2011Sci...333.1390F | last2=Renfrew | doi=10.1126/science.1205331 | pmid=21903800 | issue=6048}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that in some cases there is a correlation of language change with intrusive male Y chromosomes but not with female mtDNA. They then speculate that technological innovation (transition from hunting-gathering to agriculture, or from stone to metal tools) or military prowess (as in the abduction of British women by Vikings to Iceland) causes immigration of at least some males, and perceived status change. Then, in mixed-language marriages with these males, prehistoric women would often have chosen to transmit the "higher-status" spouse's language to their children, yielding the language/Y-chromosome correlation seen today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35759">'''List of Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros publications''' is a collection of exhibition catalogs, scholarly works, and ebooks focused on Latin American art published by [[Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros]] (CPPC), a privately held Latin American art collection organization founded by [[Patricia Phelps de Cisneros]] and [[Gustavo Cisneros]] based in [[Venezuela]] and [[New York City]].

== History ==
Since the 1990s, the Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros was created with a goal of bringing visibility and impact to the way Latin American art history is viewed and appreciated both on a regional and international level. As part of its four-pronged approach, CPPC lends artworks often in traveling exhibitions held at major institutional partners with accompanying exhibition catalogs that include essays, manifestos, and bibliographic profiles.&lt;ref name=LATimes-NomadicPhaseEnding-2009&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kraul|first1=Chris|title=Cisneros art trove ends its nomadic phase|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/01/cisneros-art-tr.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPPC works with scholars and academics to learn more about the artists and their works, and has established a prolific publications program to provide supporting information about the artists and their work, in addition to building an online forum for the artwork.&lt;ref name=ColeccionCisneros-Ch1-Video-2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 1: Patricia Phelps de Cisneros, A Passion for Latin America|url=http://www.coleccioncisneros.org/content/chapter-1-patricia-phelps-de-cisneros-passion-latin-america|website=Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros|format=Video|date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
The publication program of Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros that is represented here is unique in its international and pan-regional scope. Works are typically published in multiple languages, often within the same publication. The publications are oftentimes the first time the collection and curation of information about certain artists and regional and national art movements are published. Contributors are established art historians, curators, and often the artists who are working within or are part of the art movements themselves. Art movement manifestos are published in their entirety, often with full translations, in accessible and/or digital format, sometimes for the first time.&lt;ref name=FinancialTimes-RadicalGeometry-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Gareth|title=Patricia Phelps de Cisneros: an art patron on a mission|url=https://www.ft.com/content/e06f9776-719a-11e4-b178-00144feabdc0|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes-MoMADonation-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogrebin|first1=Robin|title=102 Latin American Artworks, and a New Institute, Will Go to MoMA|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/arts/design/102-latin-american-artworks-and-a-new-institute-will-go-to-moma.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12868">[[Dwarfism]] has been showcased across many types of media. As popular media has become more prevalent, a greater number of works depicting dwarfism have popularized the condition.

==Literature==
Several works of literature treat dwarfism as a major theme, with varying degrees of realism:
* ''[[The Tin Drum]]'' (''Die Blechtrommel'') by [[Günter Grass]]. The protagonist, Oskar Matzerath, refuses to grow up and as such goes through many large events in history with the stature of a small child.&lt;ref name='tin-drum'&gt;{{cite book | last = Grass | first = Günter | authorlink = Günter Grass |author2=Ralph Manheim  | title = The Tin Drum | publisher = Secker &amp; Warburg | year = 1962 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-679-72575-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Stones from the River]]'' by [[Ursula Hegi]]. Trudi Montag is a dwarf who tries to survive in a small German town during World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hegi | first = Ursula | authorlink = Ursula Hegi | title = Stones from the River | publisher = Touchstone Book| location = New York| pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-684-84477-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Dwarf (Lagerkvist novel)|The Dwarf]]'' by [[Pär Lagerkvist]]. The entire novel is based around a dwarf protagonist and his life in an Italian city-state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lagerkvist | first = Pär | authorlink = Pär Lagerkvist | title = The Dwarf | publisher = Noonday Press| location = New York| pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-374-52135-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[A Prayer for Owen Meany]]'' by [[John Irving]]. Owen Meany, the friend of the narrator and major focus of the story, is a dwarf with a fixed voicebox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Irving | first = John | authorlink = John Irving | title = A Prayer for Owen Meany | publisher = Ballantine Books| location = New York| pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-345-36179-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Hop-Frog|Hop-Frog, or The Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs]]" by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. The titular character Hop-Frog and his friend Tripetta are dwarfs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Poe | first = Edgar | authorlink = Edgar Allan Poe | title = Hop-Frog/Hop-Frog, or The Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs | publisher = | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-89598-723-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]] series'' by [[George R.R. Martin]]. A main character, [[Tyrion Lannister]], is a dry, quick-witted dwarf who struggles with acceptance by "normal" people who mock him and call him "the Imp".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Martin | first = George | authorlink = George R.R. Martin | title = A Game of Thrones | publisher = Bantam Books| location = New York| pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-553-10354-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Maybe the Moon]]'', by [[Armistead Maupin]], has as its protagonist Cadence Roth, a Jewish dwarf actress. The character is based on Maupin's friend [[Tamara De Treaux]], who played the title role in the movie ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Maupin | first = Armistead | authorlink = Armistead Maupin | title = Maybe the Moon | publisher = HarperPerennial| location = New York| pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-06-092434-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Geek Love]]'' by Katherine Dunn. The narrator of the novel, Olympia Binewski, is an albino hunchback dwarf whose family owns a traveling carnival.

==Film and television==
Several works of visual arts treat dwarfism as a major theme, with varying degrees of realism:
[[File:Mimie Mathy Cannes.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Mimie Mathy]].]]
* In the 1960s and early 1970s, actor [[Michael Dunn (actor)|Michael Dunn]] was well known for his recurring role on television series ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', as Dr. Miguelito Loveless. In the pilot episode of the Mel Brooks and Buck Henry television spy spoof ''[[Get Smart]]'', Dunn appeared as the well-heeled gangster Mr. Big, leader of an international crime syndicate.&lt;ref name="urlMichael Dunn Filmography"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fandango.com/michaeldunn/filmography/p20627 |title=Michael Dunn Filmography |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Even Dwarfs Started Small]]'' (''Auch Zwerge haben klein angefangen'') by [[Werner Herzog]]. The film's entire cast is made up of dwarfs. The film is about a group of dwarfs confined in an institution on a remote island rebel against the guards and director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = [[Werner Herzog|Herzog, Werner]] (director) | title = Auch Zwerge haben klein angefangen | date = 1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another film with an all-dwarf cast was [[The Terror of Tiny Town]] released in 1938. Filmed as a normal western on a full size set, it allowed for some sight gags like cowboys walking UNDER the batwing doors to enter the saloon.
* In the mid-1970s, [[Sid and Marty Krofft]] built an indoor [[theme park]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] called [[The World of Sid and Marty Krofft]]. The park included a live stage production, that was then the largest gathering of "little people" since the filming of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' in 1937–38, as well as being the largest indoor theme park built to date. The facility that housed the theme park now houses the studios of [[CNN]], the [[Cable News Network]], and ''[[Headline News|CNN Headline News]]''.&lt;ref name='cnn-center'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/StudioTour/history.html |title=CNN Studio Tour |accessdate=2008-11-18 |publisher=CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Philippines|Filipino]] actor [[Weng Weng]] appeared in several feature films, and played the starring role in the [[spy movie]] spoof ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Impossible Kid (film)|The Impossible Kid]]''. The 1981 fantasy film ''[[Time Bandits]]'' featured six dwarf characters. The 1989 Indian Film, [[Apoorva Sagodharargal (1989 film)|Apoorva Sagodharargal]] directed by [[Singeetam Srinivasa Rao]], was one of the enduring works on dwarf characters in film.
* In the 1990s, ''[[Seinfeld]]'' featured a dwarf character, [[List of Seinfeld minor characters#mickeyabbott|Mickey Abbott]], in seven episodes; Mickey was played by actor [[Danny Woodburn]]. He got into several physical altercations with {{convert|6|ft|m|sing=on}}-plus Kramer. In one episode, he was ostracized by his dwarf peers for using lifts in his shoes to make him look taller.&lt;ref name="urlMickey Abbott - Part actor, part stand-in, part ladies man, and hes only 4, but he can do 42, 43 is a stretch."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siyumhaseinfeld.com/chars/friends/mickey.html |title=Mickey Abbott - Part actor, part stand-in, part ladies man, and he's only 4", but he can do 4"2, 4"3 is a stretch. |work= |accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[France|French]] actress and comedian [[Mimie Mathy]] is the star of the TV series ''[[Joséphine ange gardien]]'', broadcast on [[TF1]] since 1997, in which she plays a [[guardian angel]] who helps a variety of people solve their problems, with the help of her magical powers and good sense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tf1.fr/josephine-ange-gardien/ Joséphine ange gardien - official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Men in Black weapons.jpg|thumb|300px|Weapons in the film. On the left is the [[Noisy Cricket]] while on the right is a standard-issue sidearm or 'J2']]
This is the list of weapons, gadgets, and equipment in the [[Men in Black (franchise)|Men in Black franchise]]. As seen in the comics, films, video game and the TV series.

== Weapons ==
Weapons in the ''Men in Black'' films are often depicted as compact, energy-spitting, and silver-colored. Most of their weapons are made concealable so civilians are unable to see them. Many of their technologies are sold and patented to fund their organization.

In the [[The Men in Black (comics)|comics]], their main weapons are the same weapons used in the 20th and 21st century, as opposed to the futuristic weapons appearing in the film series.

By means of concealability, many of their weapons are small. Throughout the movie there is an insistence that small is unimportant, bad, and wimpy. For example, this belief can be seen in Jay's reaction to the noisy cricket, sickly underestimating it and even joking that he may break the "damn thing". Yet, as he later found out in the film, the cricket is very dangerous, the kick-back hurling Jay into the display case behind him the first time he shoots it. Despite Jay's skepticism, this was a powerful weapon, just in a small package.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrdSqontwfc MiB Weaponry]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Adorian crossbow''' is a burst-firing [[crossbow]]-like weapon appearing in the video game ''[[MIB: Alien Crisis]]''. A weapon used by Peter Delacoeur that fires shafts of [[plasma weapon|plasma]]-charged energy up to fifty meters. It is described as powerful but with mediocre accuracy.
* '''Carbonizers''' as seen in the first movie are  universal weapons used by aliens and MiB. There are two known versions of carbonizers: Reverberating with mutate capacity, and the other is Fission. A '''Reverberating carbonizer''' is the weapon used by the unnamed alien chased by [[Agent J|James Edwards]] in the beginning of the film. He attempted to use the weapon, but it fell and evaporated upon impact. Later, Edwards pointed the gun out at Jeebs' pawnshop, which Kay punished Jeebs for trying to sell it. The weapon was said to have a mutate capacity, which was shown when the gun evaporated with a bright green flame and a shower of sparks.
* '''Cosmic integrator''' – The Cosmic Integrator is an alien device that can meld beings together and is first seen in the television series. In the past, Alpha kills some Verulians, when Kay comes in. Alpha then shows Kay the Cosmic Integrator. Alpha tells Kay how great this device is, and Kay warns Alpha that the device is against MiB rules. Alpha asks Kay to join him in destroying the MiB, but Kay refuses and is shot. Over the next 20 years, Alpha uses the Cosmic Integrator to meld body parts of the best aliens onto his own body. The result is an extremely powerful Alpha, who uses it to add more pieces to take down the MiB.
* '''De-atomizer''' is a commonly used weapon at MiB. They come in different sizes and models but mostly as a pistol size. A '''Series 4 De-Atomizer''' is a large variant selected by Agent K before heading to Rosenberg's jewellery store in the first movie. History of the weapon is explained in the video game [[MIB: Alien Crisis]], saying that the weapon has been the staple of agents starting from the 80s but it existed since the beginning of the Agency. It is described in the game as [[Short-barrelled shotgun|"shotgun size"]] and powerful.
* '''De-molecular hazard Excell 12''' – is a flat, handheld, book-like weapon with a pistol grip and a sight seen in the T.V. series. It fires concentrated energy onto an enemy. Agent K and Buzzard used these in their stand-off, but both only fired one shot at each other before their weapons were destroyed by each other's respective blasts.
* '''Icer''' – is a weapon that Agent K and Agent J used in the first episode of the first season of the series. It is a small freeze [[pistol]] having no barrel but has a slit where a bolt of green electricity-like energy shoots out that can freeze, or '"ice'", enemies. They used it in their fight with the Skraaldians and Alpha, but is later seen in many of the series' episodes. It can also unfreeze those who were frozen and be used as a force field against heat-emitting weapons. A different version of the icer appears in the video game MIB: Alien Crisis as a weapon attachment, used to freeze enemies before firing at them.
* '''Ionhibitor''' – is the weapon Agent K and the mercenary Buzzard used against each other in episode 2 of the series. It is a handheld weapon that fires orbs of energy that Buzzard  describes can vaporize enemies. Buzzard uses a Model 5 while Agent K braggingly said he uses a Model 6. Though described as different, physically they are both the same. It later became one of Agent K's signature weapon in the series.
* '''[[Noisy Cricket]]''' is a very tiny gun with a lot of power. Despite its small size, it launches a large orb of energy. In the original film, Jay is given the Noisy Cricket as his beginning weapon. He reluctantly carries it, believing he is going to break it. It is not until Edgar the Bug drives away that it is first fired. Here, Jay flies back from the powerful recoil, and a large green ball of energy is released (it also makes a sound similar to a cricket, given its name). Despite its power, he does not use it in the final battle. A spin-off book, the ''MIB Agent's Handbook'', explains that Noisy Crickets are deliberately given to rookies, and bets are taken on how far the rookie will fly as a result of the gun's recoil (a practice discouraged under MIB's '[[Hazing|No Hazing]]' policy). In the animated series, Jay still uses the Noisy cricket with the same avail. However, he eventually gives it a suppressor so it no longer kicks. In the second film, Jay gives the neuralyzed Kay the Noisy Cricket just as the opposite had happened in the previous movie. Jay also tells Kay that he always loved the Cricket, which Kay felt is false. In Men in Black II, after Kay gets his memory of MiB back, he shoots Jeebs' head off with the Noisy Cricket, but it didn't launch a large orb of energy, nor did the recoil launch him.
* '''Tri barrel plasma gun''' - Nicknamed "The Jackhammer", and unlike the other weapons in the franchise the gun appears to be a [[projectile weapon]], as it has a [[box magazine]] filled with rounds. This is further described in the novelization of the first film, where Agent J described it as  "three foot long, with a [[Pump action|pump-action reloader]] and a storage magazine that looked like it would hold a dozen rounds of extra ammo", and the ammo "looked like [[shotgun shell]]s made out of [[stainless steel]]". It is used by the agents in their subsequent fight against Edgar the Bug. It is also used in the fight against Serleena in the second film. It appears again in the video game MIB: Alien Crisis.
* '''[[Pump-action shotgun]]''' is one of a few contemporary weapons that appeared in the comics. Mainly used by Agent K and J,  It appears in many of the [[The Men in Black (comics)|comic book's cover]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:MIBseries1.jpg|Comic Book Cover]]&lt;/ref&gt; Issues that the gun appeared on the cover are ''Initiation'' and ''Wolf in the Fold''. Edgar the Bug used a [[Winchester Model 1912]], which he calls a "projectile weapon", while several [[sheriff]]s at the beginning of the film have them [[Mossberg 500]]s.
* '''[[Revolver]]''' is a main sidearm in the original comic book series. It appears in the cover of the ''Wolf in the Fold'' issue. A [[Ruger Super Redhawk]] appeared in the movie when the bug is searching New York City for "the galaxy", a tow truck driver begins preparing to tow a pest exterminator van stolen by the bug. When the bug confronts the driver with Edgar's shotgun, the driver pulls out a Ruger Super Redhawk, thinking the sight of the revolver would intimidate him, though he is fatally mistaken when the bug kills him and takes both his gun and his [[tow truck]]. A revolver is seen in the third film, where a younger Agent K gives it to Agent J as a substitute weapon because of trust issues between the two. Agent J uses it with his first fight against Boris.
* '''[[Semi-automatic pistol]]''' – is a sidearm used by MiB agents in the original comic book. Seen on the cover of issue ''The Ravening'' and ''Con Sequences''. In the first movie, Detective James Edwards can be seen carrying a [[Smith &amp; Wesson|Smith &amp; Wesson 3913NL]] as his weapon of choice, drawing it several times while pursuing a disguised alien on foot, using it to shoot open the door of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] the alien had jumped onto the roof of. He then pulls it on Agent K  when K shoots off one of Jack Jeebs' heads, thinking K had just murdered Jeebs, though is shocked to see Jeebs' head grow back before his eyes. During the agent selection process at MiB headquarters, the candidates, consisting of several elite U.S. military personnel and Detective Edwards, are placed on a firing range and tasked with engaging a series of targets in a "Hogan's Alley"-esque scenario using "Non Gun" replicas of [[SIG Sauer P220]]-series pistols. The military personnel begin firing numerous rounds at all the alien targets, while Edwards fires only one round into a target made to look like a little girl. When asked why he shot that target, he pointed out how the alien targets appeared not to be posing a threat, while the target he shot was holding science textbooks for subjects far too advanced for her age.
* '''Standard-issue sidearm (the 'J2')''' is the standard MIB sidearm carried by all agents. It was used by Agents D and K in the opening sequence of the first movie, and by Agent K throughout. An updated version of the gun (sporting an extra barrel) was seen during Agent J's pursuit of Geoff the Worm in the second movie. It is named the '''Agent Pistol''' in the video game MIB: Alien Crisis, where it is described as a "rechargeable" weapon and has been a standard issue since 1995. It has two distinct firing method, normal and [[alkali]] rounds, the latter being more power but less conventional.
* '''Void density core''' is a weapon that acts as a miniature [[black hole]]. It is a baseball size grenade-like weapon that can suck up anything within a three-mile radius. Buttons are placed on the surface and can be activated by pushing it, and either throwing it or sticking it on like a grenade launcher. Created by aliens for waste management, it has been outlawed because of its terrorist potentials. As seen in Episode 3 of Season 1, the Men in Black apparently keep one as to show rookies and others about its lethality.

== Gadgets ==
Oftentimes, the Men in Black utilizes special [[gadget]]s that aids them in battle and investigation. Many of them are made to look like ordinary technology we use today for means of concealability. The first gadget ever used in the franchise was the Neuralyzer, and many soon followed in the television series.

*'''Anti-gravity shoes''' – are gadgets used by the MiB and first seen in the preview of the second episode of Season 2. Like the name says, these shoes allow the wearer to hover at any given height. When not in use, they revert to their casual form as an ordinary black leather office shoes. Agent K first used them to save himself and Agent J from falling.
*'''Communicaters''' – are items used by MiB agents to communicate with each other. This is one of the items seen much of in the series and in the films. Its appearance has been changed over the course of the franchise and many variants have appeared. In the series, the communicators look more like a cellphone but has a folding mechanism and allows the agents to see each other via [[video call]]. In the episode "Dog Eat Dog Syndrome", Agent K gives Frank a miniature variant attached to Frank's collar which he used during the set-up. It later became a more practical earpiece in the second film.
*'''Gatbot''' - is a robot used by the MIB both for conventional usage and as a weapon. It is a small limbless robot with a smooth surface and has a similar appearance to that of [[R2-D2]]. It is first seen in the second film being reprogrammed by Serleena to defend her from the agent's counter-attack. It is covered in multiple arrays of guns with low-caliber rounds that spins and releases waves of bullets in a symmetrical rotating firing position. It is destroyed by Agent K with a grenade.
*'''Flush''' – is an escape route that Agent J and Agent K used to escape when MiB's Code 101 Lockdown breach protocol was initiated when Serleena took over MiB. Though not really a gadget, it is more of a comedy-made technology employed in the movie.
*'''[[Neuralyzer]]''' – is a top secret device used by the MiB. It has the ability to wipe the mind of anybody who sees the flash. Once Neuralyzed, the "victim" will be given a new memory, to explain what they saw or what has happened. A '''De-neuralyzer''' is a special device that reverses the effects of a Neuralyzer. Although a neuralyzer is operated by a small flash of light, a de-neuralyzer is much more complicated.
*'''Quick clone''' – is a type of MiB technology. As its name suggests, it is an [[cloning|auto-clone]] maker, but there is a catch. The catch is that the clone lasts only a short period of time. When its time is up, it starts to babble, and then it melts to a pile of goo. They are used to form a distraction, extra hands, temporary field replacements, or a way to secretly escape. It is also shown items can be placed in Quick Clones, as Jay put a bomb in one to destroy Alpha. These clones have all the same traits as the original, along with their fighting skills, too. But clones tend to be more damage resistant in field missions and are more obedient than the originals.
*'''Restrainer''' - an MIB standard issue long range trapping device launcher, takes the form of a handheld pistol with no barrel but has a face sporting a five-pronged ejection port that launches elastic expansion bola like green masses at the target either immobilizing them or binding them to an adjacent surface. These taffy-like snares seem to adjust their size in order to better catch their intended prey but most times come off as a facial binding device that stuns the enemies motions due to obscured vision.
*'''Shrink ray''' – is an MiB technology used for undercover purposes. First seen in Episode 1 of Season 2, it is a shrinking machine that shrinks the volunteers to proportional size. It operates by placing the selected volunteer into a containment capsule-looking hatch, and by surrounding them with [[neon]]-like rays and gas, it shrinks them, but the clothes remain as they were. When shrunk, the only way to get bigger is using another ray that reverses the effect.
*'''Spectral trail scanner''' – are devices used by the MiB to scan if any alien "trail" is on the scene. It first appeared in the first movie where Agent K used it to discover that a monstrous bug has landed on Earth. It has the same size as a Neuralyzer but with a scoop and multiple lights and screens. Many scanners appeared in the series but they differ from the Spectral Trail.This scanner also has other features such as an [[X-ray]] ability and [[metal detector]]-like usage. Another variant of the scanner appeared in the video game MIB: Alien Crisis, used to scan people and distinguish a human from an alien via X-ray and heat signatures. It can also list down that organism's components, ailments, and species.

== Outfits ==
MiB agents wear [[Suit (clothing)|suits]] as their primary uniform. All their clothes including the jacket, pants, ties, socks and leather shoes are all black, hence the name Men in Black while the dress shirts are white. These suits are worn so that when they "neuralyze" a victim, they won't leave any lasting impression or image. These suits were described as "the last suit [an MiB agent] will ever wear", and in the films and television series, these suits are always worn and the agents are all seen wearing them at all times. MiB agents also wear specialized Predator 2 [[Ray-Ban]] sunglasses to protect them from their own neuralyzer flash. These sunglasses became popular in the franchise, and sales of these glasses in the market increased over time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FjOnulleMI MiB Wardrobe]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the films and TV series, the MiB have a wide array of disguises that they, and visiting aliens, wear either for their undercover purposes, or for the aliens hidden in the city. Their main purpose though is to make sure that no civilians will ever know aliens are "walking among them", and for the aliens not to spook any civilians.

There are specialized suits that MiB agents use in field missions and investigations. [[Hazmat suit]]s are seen in the second film, where the agents wore them when investigating Serleena's spacecraft.

*'''Disguise suit''' – is a specially made suit employed by the MiB in the TV series. Unlike other disguises which are big bulky, and immobile, this suit was made to create a faster and quicker desired disguise with a push of a button. Agent J used this in the episode "The Sonic Boom Syndrome". With a push of a button in his tie, an alien disguise engulfs Jay and hid his true form from the aliens.
*'''Heat-resistant suits''' – are the suits that the MiB agents used in the TV series. First seen in the episode "The Dog Eat Dog Syndrome", these suits were worn for the purpose of protecting the agents from any heat-emitting weapons and environments. The first suit worn were more like the traditional disguises aliens and agents wore. Agent K and Agent J later used a more concealed suit, where they are seen as a transparent tight suit. In Episode 4 of Season 2, the alien Drekk did not know that the protagonist was wearing these suits until he dipped them in a big container of molten metal. The suits protected the agents from Drekk's heat ray powers, without letting Drekk know they were wearing them.
*'''Stealth suit''' – is a [[cloaking device]] first seen in Episode 5 Season 1. Like what the name says, it is an invisibility suit, resembling a [[wetsuit]], capable of making its wearer invisible, be undetectable by both senses and radar, and emit no signatures. The wearer can also adjust the way it is cloaked so that someone he intends to can detect and communicate with him. It was first worn by the assassin, but although invisible, Agent K soon detected him. Agent J managed to score a direct hit on its wearer but found too late that there was no one in the suit and it was merely a decoy. It was soon put into the MiB possessions and first worn by Agent K.

== Vehicles ==
Vehicles in the Men in Black franchise are also black, simple, and concealable, so as not to attract attention like other MiB technology. These vehicles are often weaponized, and many variants have the ability to fly. Vehicles are also available in the video game MIB: Alien Crisis in the driving missions.

{{quotation |"Unlimited technology from the whole universe, and we cruise around in a Ford P.O.S."
: – Agent J describing Agent K's car }}

*'''1987 [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria]]''' – called "Ford P.O.S." by Agent J in the first Men in Black film and "Old Busted Joint/Old and Busted" in the second film. With a push of a red button, the car unleashes its more aerodynamic design and two jet engine-like engines. It can swivel, fly inverted, and run on walls. The red button can only be used in very special circumstances like when Agent K tells Agent J to push the red button in order to avoid the traffic in the [[Queens–Midtown Tunnel]] to save enough time to chase down Edgar the Bug. It also appeared in the [[Men in Black: The Series|TV series]] as Agent K and Agent J's primary mode of transportation in every episode.
*'''1964 [[Ford Galaxie]]''' - used by a younger Agent K in the third film. It was destroyed by Boris The Animal during their chase.
*'''2003 [[Mercedes-Benz W211|E-500 Mercedes]]'''  – called "New Hotness" by Agent J in the second film. This is the car that replaced Agent K's Ford. It has been specially modified to fly with the push of the same red button from Agent K's Ford, fire weapons, and has a built-in neuralyzer to neuralyze spectating civilians. It also has a [[PlayStation 2|PS2]]-like manual drive.
*'''2012 [[Ford Taurus SHO]]''' - Used in the third film in the contemporary scenes.
*'''Agent L's hovercycle''' – commenting that "Nancy Drew never had one of these", unlike other bikes, L's has no wheels, and it hovers above the ground with two vertical jet-like engines at the back, and is first seen in episode 2 of the series. But like other [[Motorcycle|bikes]], its engines are started in a similar way by pulling the choke and squeezing the clutch lever.
*'''Agent K's monocycle''' - an alien vehicle used by Agent K and Agent J in their chase with Boris when Agent K's Ford Galaxie was destroyed. It is an extraterrestrial vehicle with a motorcycle seat and a [[gyroscope]] like wheel that helps in steering the vehicle while steadying the driver's seat.
*'''Black track''' – called "the MiB Choo Choo" by Agent J in the TV series, is a train-like transport that runs on tracks used by the MiB to transport personnel underground seen in the series. The vehicle looks more like a [[High-speed rail|bullet train]], but has a more conical bullet design and is colored black.
*'''Intergalactic prison transfer''' – is a spacecraft in the TV series used by the Intergalactic Police in transferring their prisoners. It looks just like [[Halo (franchise)|Halo's Banshee]], or vice versa. The MiB also used this in getting rid of the scum of the universe.
*'''[[Jet pack]]''' - a flying vehicle used by the agents to travel to [[Cape Canaveral]]. It is a jet pack with a seat and a [[jet engine]]. The vehicle can fly long distances in a short amount of time in contrast to other flying vehicles, but is said to be dangerous and prone to blowing up.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2204">'''Lovers''' are [[stock character]]s whose efforts to get together, despite the blocking effect of other characters, constitute the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of the story.

The lovers are [[eiron]] figures, and it has been noted that they often are coloress creatures, sometimes even [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingenues]]  next to the blocking figures, the [[alazon]]s who prevent their love, such as the ''[[Senex iratus]]'' or the ''[[Bad fiancé]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p 44, {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Innamorati]] of [[Commedia dell'arte]] represent this by going unmasked in the midst of the other characters.&lt;ref&gt;John Rudlin, ''Commedia dell'Arte: An Actor's Handbook'', p 62, {{ISBN|0-415-04770-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, the lovers are incapable of resolving their own problems.  The role of rescuing them is often a [[tricky slave]]'s place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p 173, {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the lovers' problems are at least partly internal to them, they have diverged from the stock characters.  Florizel and Perdita in ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' are such lovers; Perdita's reluctance to be wooed by a man above her (apparent) birth is a trivial problem beside his father's rage at such a match.  But in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', Claudio and Hero's problems arise from Claudio's being gulled, but are not solved until Claudio shakes off the villain's influence, and so he is not the stock character; still less are Benedick and Beatrice these stock characters, where the obstacles to their love are entirely in their characters.

[[Northrop Frye]] considered this plot, with colorless characters and all, a central portion of the myth of spring, comedy.

When the romance is not the central plot element, the character with whom the hero or heroine is deepy and truly romantically involved is called the romantic [[love interest]], beloved or sweetheart.

In North America, '''music appreciation''' courses often focus on [[Western art music]], commonly called "[[Classical music]]". Usually music appreciation classes involve some [[History of classical music traditions|history]] lessons to explain why people of a certain era liked the music that they did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naeyc.org/ece/1997/25.asp |title=Music Appreciation: A universal language for all ages |accessdate=2008-01-24 |format= |work=National Association for the Education of Young Children |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080115184558/http://www.naeyc.org/ece/1997/25.asp |archivedate = January 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Appreciation," in this context, means the understanding of the value and merit of different styles of music. Music appreciation classes also typically include information about the composers, the instruments and ensembles, and the different styles of music from an era. Music appreciation courses are widely available in universities and colleges. Typically, these courses are designed for non-music majors. A significant part of music appreciation courses is listening to recordings of musical pieces or excerpts from pieces such as [[symphonies]], [[opera aria]]s and [[concerto]]s. In some music appreciation classes, the class may go out to hear a live musical performance by an orchestra or chamber music group.

A '''musical cryptogram''' is a [[cryptogram]]matic sequence of [[musical note]]s, a sequence which can be taken to refer to an extra-musical text by some 'logical' relationship, usually between note names and letters. The most common and best known examples result from composers using [[cipher]]ed versions of their own or their friends' names as [[Theme (music)|themes]] or [[Motif (music)|motifs]] in their compositions. Much rarer is the use of [[music notation]] to [[code (cryptography)|encode]] messages for reasons of [[espionage]] or personal security called [[steganography]].

Because of the multitudinous ways in which notes and letters can be related, detecting hidden ciphers and proving accurate decipherment is difficult.

==History==
From the initial assignment by Western music theorists of letter names to notes in the 9th century&lt;ref&gt;Hiley, David 'Notation III, 1 (vi)' in Sadie, Stanley (ed.), ''The New Grove dictionary of music and musicians'', Macmillan, 1980, (6th ed. of the Grove dictionary), vol.13, p. 348–349&lt;/ref&gt; it became possible to reverse the procedure and assign notes to the letters of names. However, this does not seem to have become a recognized technique until the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period. From the mid-19th century it has become quite common. Sporadic earlier encipherments used [[solmization]] syllables.

==Systems==

===Syllables to solmization names===
It is believed that this method was first used by [[Josquin des Prez]] in his ''Missa Hercules Dux Ferrarie''. It was named [[Soggetto cavato]] by the later theorist [[Zarlino]]. Under this scheme the vowel sounds in the text are matched to the vowel sounds of the solmization syllables of [[Guido of Arezzo]] (where 'ut' is the root, which we now call 'do'). Thus the Latin name of the dedicatee 'Hercules Dux Ferrarie' ([[Ercole d'Este I|Ercole d'Este, Duke of Ferrara]]) becomes re-ut-re-ut-re-fa-mi-re, which translates as D-C-D-C-D-F-E-D in modern notation with C as 'ut'. This is used as the [[cantus firmus]] of the mass setting. Josquin's method was imitated by several of his contemporaries and successors, including [[Adrian Willaert]] and [[Costanzo Festa]].

===Letters to note names===
Since the note names only cover letters A to G (reflecting the octave repetition of these names), the problem arises as to how to cipher the rest of the alphabet. Historically there have been two main solutions, which may be labelled for convenience the 'German' and the 'French' methods.

====German====
Because the development of note names took place within the framework of [[Musical mode|modes]], in the German-speaking world ''B-flat'' was named 'B' and ''B-natural'' was named  'H'. The most common musical cryptogram is the [[BACH motif|B-A-C-H motif]], which was used by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] himself, by his contemporaries and by many later composers. Other note names were derived by sound, for example ''E-flat'', 'Es' in German, could represent 'S' and ''A-flat'' the digraph 'As'.

Composers less fortunate than Bach usually seem to have chosen to ignore non-musical letters in generating their motifs. For example, [[Robert Schumann]], an inveterate user of cryptograms, has just S-C-H-A (''E-flat, C, B-natural, A'') to represent himself in ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]''. Sometimes phonetic substitution could be used, Schumann representing Bezeth by B-E-S-E-D-H. [[Johannes Brahms]] used B-A-H-S (''B-flat, A, B-natural, E-flat'') for his surname in the A-flat minor organ fugue, and the mixed language Gis-E-La (''G-sharp, E, A'') for [[Gisela von Arnim]], among many examples.&lt;ref name="sams"&gt;Sams, Eric 'Cryptography, musical' in Sadie, Stanley (ed.), ''The New Grove dictionary of music and musicians'', Macmillan, 1980, (6th ed. of the Grove dictionary), vol.5, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

====French====
The 'French' method of generating cryptograms arose late in the 19th century and was more akin to normal [[Cipher|encipherment]]. The most popular version involved writing out the letters H-N, O-U and V-Z in lines under the original diatonic notes A-G, as follows:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! A
! B
! C
! D
! E
! F
! G
|-
| H
| I
| J
| K
| L
| M
| N
|-
| O
| P
| Q
| R
| S
| T
| U
|-
| V
| W
| X
| Y
| Z
| 
| 
|}
so that A, H, O, and V are enciphered by note 'A', B, I, P and W by 'B' (flat or natural) and so on. This scheme was used by [[Jules Écorcheville]], editor of the journal ''S.I.M.'', to solicit centenary commemorations of [[Joseph Haydn]] in 1909, except that he diverted the 'H' to B-natural, presumably to avoid too many repeated notes.&lt;ref name="sams" /&gt; Writing to [[Gabriel Fauré]] about the invitation, [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] said he was writing to Écorcheville asking him to prove that Y and N could signify D and G as "it would be annoying to get mixed up in a farcical business which would make us a laughing stock in the German musical world." &lt;ref&gt;quoted in Nichols, Roger, ''Ravel'', Dent, 1977, {{ISBN|0-460-03146-5}}, page 66&lt;/ref&gt;
The many-to-one mapping of this method makes it more difficult to extract possible motifs from the musical score than the [[Bijection|one-to-one correspondence]] (apart from 'As') of the German system.

===20th century===
A French tradition of celebratory uses developed from the Haydn centenary, with tributes to 
Gabriel Fauré by [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Florent Schmitt]], [[Charles Koechlin]] and others in 1922 (added to later by [[Arnold Bax]], 1949&lt;ref&gt;David Parlett, ed. [http://www.davpar.eu/bax/bax4053.html "Baxworks"], ''Music by Arnold Bax''.&lt;/ref&gt;) and to [[Albert Roussel]] by [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Arthur Honegger]], [[Darius Milhaud]] and others  (using various ciphering schemes) in 1929. Honegger's system involved placing the letters after 'H' under sharpened and flattened notes,&lt;ref name="sams" /&gt; an example of how chromatic cryptograms could be more easily accommodated in [[20th-century music]].

[[Olivier Messiaen]] developed his own full cipher, involving pitches and note lengths, for his organ work ''[[Méditations sur le mystère de la Sainte Trinité]]'' (1969).&lt;ref&gt;Halbreich, C., 'Ciphered creed', ''Music and musicians'', vol. 20 (1972) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dmitri Shostakovich]] used the German scheme for his personal motto D-Es-C-H (''D, E-flat, C, B-natural''), representing [[DSCH motif|D.SCH]], which appears in many of his most characteristic works. [[Elliott Carter]] featured both a cryptogram for the last name "[[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]]" in his piece ''Réflexions'' (2004) and a sonic symbol of the first name "Pierre".&lt;ref&gt;Justin Wintle (2009). ''The Concise Makers of Modern Culture'', p.123. {{ISBN|0-415-47782-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryptograms were less common in England, but [[Edward Elgar]], who was also interested in general cryptography and puzzles, wrote an early ''Allegretto'' for his pupils the Gedge sisters using G-E-D-G-E &lt;ref&gt;McVeagh, Diana M. (2007) ''Elgar the Music Maker''. Woodbridge, Suffolk: Boydell Press. p. 3. {{ISBN|978-1-84383-295-9}}. "The Allegretto on GEDGE (1885) is based, Schumann-like, on the musical letters of Elgar's pupils, the Gedge sisters."&lt;/ref&gt; and part of the 'enigma' in the ''[[Enigma Variations]]'' involves cryptograms.

===Others===
In 1947 [[Friedrich Smend]] also been suggested that Bach enciphered significant numbers through methods including repetitions of a motif, [[lyrics|word]], or [[phrase (music)|phrase]]; the notes played on the [[basso continuo|continuo]]; the use of [[sequence (music)|sequence]]; and the notes played by the [[accompaniment]]. However, Ruth Tatlow has presented evidence questioning the plausibility of Smend's claims.&lt;ref&gt;Tatlow, Ruth (1991). ''Bach and the Riddle of the Number Alphabet'', p.25. {{ISBN|0-521-36191-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first quarter of the 20th century, American author and occultist [[Paul Foster Case]] established an esoteric musical cryptogram for the purposes of ceremonial magick. The system was a derivative of a cipher used by an affiliated magical order called the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Middle Pillar: The Balance Between Mind and Magic|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KocDfK3cNpIC|publisher = Llewellyn Worldwide|date = 1998-01-01|isbn = 9781567181401|first = Israel|last = Regardie|first2 = Chic|last2 = Cicero|first3 = Sandra Tabatha|last3 = Cicero}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each note of the 12 tone system was assigned a set of correspondences including colors, planets, zodiacal signs, and Hebrew letters. The holy names of biblical characters were translated letter by letter into a linear sequence of musical notes, so that each letter could be sung by the congregation in unison.

Ezra Sandzer-Bell has written and published two books on this subject,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Books|url = http://www.audiomancy.net/books1/|website = Music and Magick|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing how Paul Foster Case's system of musical cryptography could be applied to songwriting. Any word can be translated phonetically into Hebrew and converted using Case's cryptogram to generate a series of notes. Sandzer-Bell's project involves the conversion of the common and Latin names of plants, trees, and mushrooms into melodies. Each song was composed by consuming the plant in tea or [[tincture]] form, then using the physical effects of the plant to determine what kind of rhythm, harmony, instruments, and dynamics to use.  A lengthy demonstration and proof concept is publicly available on the author's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Music|url = http://www.audiomancy.net/music/|website = Music and Magick|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Missing information|mythology in most of Rick Riordan's works|date=August 2015}}}}

[[Rick Riordan]] is an author of [[children's literature|children's]] [[fantasy (genre)|fantasy]] literature. Each of his works of children's literature centers around an adaptation of [[mythology]] for modern readers and for children. He has used [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Roman mythology|Roman]], [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]], and [[Norse mythology|Norse]] and combinations thereof in a total of five separate novel series.

The mythology used in his works possesses elements unique to his series, but has a largely historical basis. Some of its characteristics include an emphasis on human-divine interaction and a preference for anglicized names.

==Rick Riordan's fictional universe==
* '''[[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman mythology]]:''' ''[[Camp Half-Blood Chronicles]]''
** ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]]''
** ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]''
** ''[[The Trials of Apollo]]''
* '''[[Egyptian mythology]]:''' ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]''
* '''[[Norse mythology]]:''' ''[[Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard]]''

==Riordan's sources==
Riordan's sources for the mythology used in his books must largely be surmised from isolated comments on the subject during various interviews, as he has never released a list of any kind. These sources begin with the myths and the derivations thereof that he was exposed to as a child. Unnamed "novels on [[Norse mythology]]", suggested to him by a teacher who noticed his interest in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', were his first introduction to mythology and continue to influence his writing today.&lt;ref name="ab mag"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://theabsolutemag.com/6499/videos/rick-riordan-discusses-interpreting-mythology-for-middle-schoolers/ | title=Author Rick Riordan Discusses Interpreting Mythology for Middle Schoolers | publisher=(The) Absolute | work=(The) Absolute Mag: Books-Comics | accessdate=August 7, 2016 | author=Ferris, Amanda}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rr int w/ rick"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rickriordan.com/about/an-interview-with-rick/ | title=An Interview With Rick | publisher=Rick Riordan | work=An Interview with Rick | accessdate=August 7, 2016 | author=Riordan, Rick}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author also claims to have read such notable classics as ''[[The Iliad]]'' and ''[[The Odyssey]]'', and to use his "general knowledge" of a given mythology as a basis for his stories.&lt;ref name="ALA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ala.org/offices/resources/riordan | title=Talking with Rick Riordan | publisher=[[American Library Association]] | work=Book Links ''(Vol. 18, no. 5)'' | date=May 2009 | accessdate=August 7, 2016 | author=Larson, Jeanette}}&lt;/ref&gt; As far as [[Greek mythology]] is concerned, Riordan has stated that ''Tales of the Greek Heroes'' by [[Roger Lancelyn Green]]—called by its author a "retelling of the Greek myths... based on multitudinous sources"—was one of his first introductions to that type of myth, and is in part responsible for his decision to interpret myths in his own books.&lt;ref name="tales"&gt;{{cite book | title=Tales of the Greek Heroes | publisher=[[Puffin Books|Puffin Classics]] | author=Green, Roger Lancelyn | authorlink=Roger Lancelyn Green | year=2009 | location=[[London]] | isbn=978-0-141-32528-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Riordan has stated that he uses modern sources such as [[Theoi Project|The Theoi Project]] for fact-checking purposes, as needed.&lt;ref name="ALA" /&gt;

None of his novels include a list of references. ''[[Percy Jackson's Greek Gods]]'' and ''[[Percy Jackson's Greek Heroes]]'' alone possess "Background Reading" sections, listing novels such as [[Robert Fagles]]'s translation of ''[[The Aeneid]]'' and [[web site]]s such as the [[Encyclopedia Mythica]].&lt;ref name="PJGG"&gt;{{cite book | title=Percy Jackson's Greek Gods | publisher=[[Disney Publishing Worldwide|Disney]]-[[Hyperion Books|Hyperion]] | author=Riordan, Rick | authorlink=Rick Riordan | year=2014 | location=[[Los Angeles]] | isbn=978-1-4231-8364-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PJGH"&gt;{{cite book | title=Percy Jackson's Greek Heroes | publisher=[[Disney Publishing Worldwide|Disney]]-[[Hyperion Books|Hyperion]] | author=Rirodan, Rick | authorlink=Rick Riordan | year=2015 | location=[[Los Angeles]] | isbn=978-1-4231-8365-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nth metal''' is a fictional [[metal]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]].

==Publication ==
A heavy isotope of iron, Fe676&lt;ref&gt;Justice League Unlimited, Season 1, Episode 21&lt;/ref&gt; it is native to [[Thanagar]], the home planet of [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar Hol]] and [[Shayera Thal]], the [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] [[Hawkman]] and [[Hawkwoman]]. Among the unusual properties of Nth metal is the ability to negate [[gravity]], allowing a person wearing an object made of Nth metal, such as a [[belt (clothing)|belt]], to [[flight|fly]]. In addition, Nth metal also protects the wearer from the elements and speeds the healing of wounds,&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkman'' (Vol. 4) #21&lt;/ref&gt; increases their strength, and protects them from extremes in temperature. It has many other properties that have yet to be revealed in full.  It has been implied that the apparently "magical" abilities of the Thanagarian [[supervillain]], [[Onimar Synn]], all stem from his unique mastery of the properties of Nth metal.  These powers are augmented to a god-like level during [[Rann-Thanagar War|the war]] when he builds himself an artificial body made of the substance.

In ancient [[Egypt]] a Thanagarian [[starship|spaceship]] made of Nth metal crash-landed, only to be discovered by Prince Khufu and his betrothed, Chay-ara. Constant exposure to Nth metal forced Khufu and Chay-ara into a cycle of [[reincarnation]]. In the 20th century, they were incarnated as [[Carter Hall (comics)|Carter Hall]] and Shiera Saunders, the original Hawkman and [[Hawkgirl]]. As Hawkman and Hawkgirl, they wore Nth metal belts, made with the help of the Thanagarian [[Paran Katar]], father of Katar Hol, when he was visiting Earth.

Many years later, Carter and Shiera's son, [[Doctor Fate|Hector Hall]], made a suit of [[armor]] made of Nth metal and took the name [[Silver Scarab]] as a founding member of [[Infinity Inc.]] The suit provided him with protection from attacks, let him lift great weights, and allowed him to fly and project solar energy blasts.

The current Hawkman and [[Hawkgirl]] continue to wear Nth metal.

Much later in the DC timeline, members of the [[Legion of Super Heroes]] wear "flight rings" made of an alloy of Nth metal called valorium.

The mercenary known as [[Deathstroke]] wears armor made of a composite Nth metal blend.

Its name is derived from the idiom "[[The Nth Degree (disambiguation)|The Nth Degree]]" meaning that something is raised to a very high level, in this case the metal's overall numerous unusual properties and atomic number.

Within the recent rebooted continuum, Nth Metal takes on many attributes of other media while retaining unique qualities all its own. The metal is now mystical in nature, sharing a  symbiotic link when it bonds with a proper host giving them numerous biophysical augmentations like in previous publishing.

It grants its user augmented physical capabilities while physically bonding to them as was the case with Katar Hol, it even has regenerative and restorative abilities far greater than in past serializations.

Even being able to restore long lost physical attributes like a Thanagarian's genetically stunted wingspan.&lt;ref&gt;''Savage Hawkman'' Vol 1 #0&lt;/ref&gt; The metal is metamorphic and can change, shift and fabricate shielding or armaments on command. The healing properties present within are so potent they can even revive the recently deceased. Nth metal will move and act however the wielder sees fit but can also work on its own protecting its host from certain attacks.

Nth Metal has various other properties making it useful for combat or support. Namely it is adaptive and can develop new abilities when the user needs it such as nullifying another's regenerative abilities allowing for an opening to deliver fatal blows, said metal can also interact with and undo supernatural entities like ghosts and apparitions like in the cartoon.

In [[Despero]]'s case he used the metal to augment his already considerable psionic and physical capabilities several fold. As wondrous as the materia is, all of its functions are stunted if and when mixed with other metals. Only affording the user vastly augmented strength and physical ability, beyond that its merely tougher than even a titanium steel armor plating mesh.

Nth metal, like the mysterious '''Element X''', is a materia of the DC Multiverse.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' Vol. 3 #33&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its malleability it has incredible tensile strength to make a fabrication of it next to invincible. The Eschaton Golem's created by Zonuz; Old God of evil, were built using Nth Metal to hunt down and slay his progeny in The New Gods.&lt;ref&gt;''Hal Jordan and The Green Lantern Corps'' #26-29 (2017-18)&lt;/ref&gt; Through it, they had the power to tap into the metaphysical forces of reality itself; able to emit destructive force blasts that could level cities and planets, project life restoring energies which could free those trapped even from within the [[Source Wall]] and their greatest effective function was a facsimile of the Omega Beam used by Darkseid. Which is able to snipe and track their intended targets across universal to pandimensional distances at a time.&lt;ref&gt;''Hal Jordan and The Green Lantern Corps'' #28 (Dec. 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Update|date=August 2017}}

In DC Comics Rebirth, Nth Metal first reappeared in Dark Days: The Forge. 
It is revealed in [[Dark Nights: Metal]] #1 that all Nth metal present on Earth was destroyed by [[Hawkgirl|Kendra Saunders]], the only piece left was in her possession until [[Batman]] stole it.
The Nth metal is revealed to be a part of a process called mantling, in which a hero is touched by five divine metals that can create a doorway to the dark multiverse. During the Dark Nights event, Batman becomes a part of this process resulting in him exchanging places with seven dark versions of himself from the dark multiverse.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Nights: Metal'' #2 (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;
It is later revealed that Nth Metal is a counter vibratory material that cancels out the frequencies of Dark Multiverse denizens, as was the case with a twisted mirror inversion of Damian Wayne under the Bat Who Laughs,&lt;ref&gt;''Green Arrow'' Vol 6 #32 (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; making it the most effective weapon against Barbartos and his seven dark anagrams of Batman.

[[Hawkgirl]] and Hawkman's origin in Rebirth is still linked to Nth Metal.

==In other media==

===''Justice League''===
In the [[Justice League (animated series)|''Justice League'']] animated series, Nth metal has a somewhat different history. Nth metal is [[transuranic]] [[iron]] with an [[atomic number]] of 676, possesses innate anti-magical properties, is [[Electrical conductivity|hyperconductive]] and is able to invert [[meson]]s and [[graviton]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Starcrossed''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thanagarians had used the Nth metal to drive off Ichthulthu, a [[Cthulhu Mythos|Lovecraftian]] entity that had dominated Thanagar for generations.  Also, Hawkgirl was able to use her Nth metal [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]] to deflect the spells of [[Doctor Fate]], and her mace was the only weapon that could put down a rampaging [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] that was under the influence of chaos magic.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: The Terror Beyond''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hawkman]], who appears later in the [[DCAU]], also carries an axe and a net made out of Nth metal. He uses the net to capture [[Gentleman Ghost]], claiming that the properties of Nth metal interfere with dimensional shifting.

===''The Batman''===
In ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', Nth metal is renamed "Nth Element" and is portrayed as an alien mineral found within meteors. The mineral causes whatever is irradiated with it to float and defy gravity, like in the comics. The Nth Element is used in Hawkman's equipment, and [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] attempts to use it for a [[bank heist]].

===''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''===
In ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', [[Batman]] uses Nth metal [[brass knuckles]], [[handcuffs]], as well as batarangs, to fight and capture Gentleman Ghost. Green Arrow is shown to have Nth metal tipped arrows. As shown in the animated ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', Nth metal can be used against supernatural beings, but is vulnerable to direct magical spells, as is seen when Equinox mystically melts Batman's Nth metal handcuffs.

===''The Flash''===
In ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode, "Legends of Today," [[Vandal Savage]] obtains the Staff of Horus, which is made from a strange, otherworldly material, which [[Vibe (comics)|Cisco Ramon]] calls an "Nth metal," and starts developing gloves that can counteract the Staff's energy.

===''Arrow''===
In the ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' episode, "Legends of Yesterday," after [[Hath-Set|Vandal Savage]] kills Prince Khufu and Priestess Chay-Ara, a meteor storm of Nth metal meteors rain down on Egypt, granting Hath-Set immortality and Khufu and Chay-Ara the power of reincarnation. When their first attempt to stop Savage fails, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]] runs back in time and helps Cisco improve the gloves to counteract Savage's staff. After they defeat Savage, Cisco makes a distress communicator out of Nth metal for Kendra and Carter.

===''Legends of Tomorrow''===
In the ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' episode, "Night of the Hawk," a strange meteor made of Nth metal crashes down in Harmony Falls, Oregon in 1958, which [[Vandal Savage]] recovers. At the crash site, he also finds a group of teenagers that crashed and captures them, where he experiments on them at a mental hospital with the Nth metal and transforms them into Hawk-like creatures, along with the various other victims he's captured. [[Firestorm (comics)|Jefferson "Jax" Jackson]] is then captured and sent to the mental hospital, where Vandal injects him with a serum made from the Nth metal that transforms him into a Hawk creature. Later, after the team manages to stop Savage, [[Firestorm (comics)|Professor Martin Stein]] and Gideon are able to create a serum to counteract the Nth metal's effects and cure Jax and the other victims.

===''Supergirl''===
In the ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' episode, "[[The Darkest Place]]", [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] and [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]] were captured by [[Project Cadmus]] and imprisoned in cages made from Nth metal.  When Supergirl attempts to break the Nth metal cages, Mon-El claims that "they're unbreakable", and mentions that this material is from [[Thanagar]].

=== ''Injustice 2'' ===
In the video game ''[[Injustice 2]]'', certain pieces of customizable equipment are made of or reference Nth Metal. Additionally, certain characters have Nth Metal skins which can be unlocked giving the character's equipment and certain portions of their clothing a metallic appearance. Also, Donatello mentions that he has outfitted his new Bo staff with an Nth Metal core when facing Hal Jordan.

'''Numèè''' (''Naa Numee, Naa-Wee''), or '''Kwényi''', is a [[New Caledonian languages|New Caledonian language]], the one spoken at the southern tip of the island, as well as on the [[Isle of Pines (New Caledonia)|Isle of Pines]] offshore. Despite its name, it is probably not the language that gave its name to the capital of New Caledonia, [[Nouméa]]; that seems to have been its close relative [[Ndrumbea language|Ndrumbea]], which used to be spoken there. Like Ndrumbea, Numee is one of the few [[Austronesian languages]] with [[tone (linguistics)|tones]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4129">'''Palo-sebo''' (from the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] stick/poase) is a traditional Filipino game. A local variant of the [[greasy pole]], it is likely derived from the Spanish ''[[Cockaigne|cucaña]]''.

==Description==
This game is usually played by boys during a town [[Festival|fiesta]] or on special occasions in the various [[Provinces of the Philippines]]. Long and straight [[bamboo]] poles are polished and greased, after which a small bag containing the prize is tied to the top. The bag usually contains money, sweets, or toys. Sometimes a small flag is used instead of the actual prize, which is given to the winner afterwards.

===Play===
Contestants try to climb the pole in turns to secure the prize, and anyone who fails to reach the top is disqualified. The winner is the one who succeeds in reaching and untying the prize or retrieving the flag.&lt;ref name=GlobalPinoy&gt;[http://www.globalpinoy.com/ch/ch_category.php?category=pinoygames&amp;name=Palo%20Sebo&amp;table=ch_pinoygames&amp;startpage=16&amp;endpage=30 "Palo Sebo," Pinoy Games, Cultural Heritage, GlobalPinoy.com, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seasite&gt;[http://www.seasite.niu.edu/Tagalog/Filipino_Games/palo_sebo.htm Palo Sebo, Greased Bamboo Climbing], SeaSite.niu.edu (undated)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCCA&gt;[http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about_cultarts/articles.php?artcl_Id=10 Barbosa, Artemio C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8314">'''The People's Code''' is an ongoing open source project that aims to make all US Federal agencies and departments utilize [[open source software]], (OSS), for their platforms, at a pilot minimum of 20% open source.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In so doing, Federal departments and agencies can be more transparent with the work they do. Software can eventually be streamlined across all agencies, and people can begin to make suggestions on how to improve the code and policy these departments work on.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=Tony|title=Leveraging American Ingenuity through Reusable and Open Source Software|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/03/09/leveraging-american-ingenuity-through-reusable-and-open-source-software|website=Obama White House - Archives|publisher=Obama White House}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The belief that citizens should have this information available and open to them, is the idea behind what the Obama administration coined as the, ''People's Code.'' &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=Tony|title=The People’s Code – Now on Code.gov|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/11/03/peoples-code-now-codegov|website=Obama White House - Archives|publisher=Obama White House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy==
The People's Code is a project informed by the United States Federal Source Code Policy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In August 2016, the People's Code served as a deliverable of President Obama's 2013 promise to enforce [[Open Data|open data]] initiatives, and pursue aspirations for a modernized digital governance for the United States. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

== Purpose ==
Employing this [[Open-source software|OSS]] model allows for a cost-efficient means of releasing platforms and projects, whereby individual code does not need to be written for each of the respective plans or platforms respective departments are embarking on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2016/fall/free-software-takes-root-in-the-white-house-gardens|title=Free software takes root in the White House gardens|last1=FSF|first1=Free Software Foundation|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model also enables a system for best practices to be streamlined across participating Federal agencies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This means if one code proves to be successful in a particular department, another department would be able to apply and modify this same code to meet their own specific requirements, until eventually, the best tools and services of practice are implemented across the board. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sourcecode.cio.gov/OSS/|title=Federal Source Code Policy|last=|first=|date=|website=sourcecode.cio.gov/|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Previous [[Open data|Open Data]] action plans to release government data and statistics are said to be complemented through the implementation of this policy plan. This is because this policy plan can promote collaborative exchange between governments, and citizens. Civic engagement and participation could then be increased, and the deliverance of government services can be improved through collective efforts. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=ASPA|first1=Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs|title=3.14 Open Source Software|url=https://www.hhs.gov/open/2016-plan/open-source-software.html|website=HHS|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open Government ==
In addition to economic and service efficiencies, this policy meets [[open government]] objectives for openness as well, for its proactive transparency in program and service implementation. &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2012/09/17/open-government-open-data-open-source|title=Open Government, Open Data, Open Source|last=Welsch|first=Peter|date=|website=Obama White House Archives|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Federal agencies and extendedly, the government as a whole is achieving more openness for actively releasing its coding and inviting the public to engage with it. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

== Criticisms == 
Some criticisms against this specific point on open governance have been raised. The independent agency of the, [[General Services Administration]] has said that Obama's initial plans for a pilot version of this program were insufficient. This agency instead made a suggestion for an initiative which would proactively disclose all code, rather than successfully meet a minimum specified amount. &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2016/08/white-house-drops-final-federal-source-code-policy/130580/|title=White House Drops Final Federal Source Code Policy|last=Ravindranath|first=Mohana|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another criticism against this concept of open government planning was that the release of code and software from specific agencies could have the potential to lead to vulnerabilities for the government, (such as terrorism), as a result of being too transparent. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/361855-pentagons-move-toward-open-source-software-isnt-going-to-enhance|title=Pentagon's move toward open source software isn't going to enhance security|last=Podjarny|first=Guy|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Similarly to this, federal agencies who have contracted their code programming out to third parties do not have to follow the same requirements set out by this policy. &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/09/new-policy-demands-20-percent-of-federal-code-be-open-source/|title=New policy demands 20 percent of federal code be open source|last=Tarantola|first=Andrew|date=|website=Engadget|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could mean code for certain programs and agencies may never become open source. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The subsequent change of government has from [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] to [[Donald Trump|Trump]] has led for this policy to be archived on the official White House government [https://web.archive.org/web/20160920231938/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf website]. Activists for [[Open-source software|OSS]] have also explained the future of this policy is hard to discern under [[Donald Trump|Trump,]] who has made orders which stifle the potential for innovations through open source. [[Open-source software|Open source]] thrives through collaboration and innovation of diverse communities in America.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cio.com/article/3163009/open-source-tools/trumps-executive-order-on-immigration-open-source-leaders-respond.html|title=Trump's executive order on immigration: Open source leaders respond|last=Bhartiya|first=Swapnil|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These communities have had difficulty following more strict immigration restrictions since Trump's presidency, which also threatens the future of open source cooperation, prompting members of this community, like [[Jim Zemlin]], to speak out. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

== GitHub ==
In line with Sections 7.2, 7.3 and Section 7.6 of the Federal Source Code Policy, the [https://code.gov/#/explore-code/agencies/CFPB/repos/owning-a-home code.gov] site where government data and code is published on [[Open-source software|OSS]] platform, GitHub. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hub|first1=Git|title=Federal Source Code Policy|url=https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-web|website=GitHub|publisher=White House}}&lt;/ref&gt; This site acts a repository for federal code to be examined by citizens who can access these data and see what federal agencies use to run their programs and projects. Citizens and other [[GitHub]] users can also use this same forum to send in their policy and code suggestions. These suggestions and flags for bug fixes are then reviewed, and can subsequently be approved on a case by case basis prior to implementation. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Coding Projects ==
There are currently nearly 30 participating Federal agencies, and thousands of individual projects which are employing the [[Open-source software|OSS]] model, and emphasizing the concept that their work and these data are the ''People's'' Code. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://code.gov/#/explore-code/agencies/AID|title=Code.Gov - By Agency|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A language that has only one formally standardized version is monocentric. Examples include [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].{{Sfn | Clyne | 1992 | p = 3}}

In some cases the different standards of a pluricentric language may be [[ausbau language|elaborated]] until they become [[autonomous language]]s, as happened with [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] or [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]].{{Sfn | Clyne | 1992 | p = 3}}

{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2016}}

===Arabic===
Pre-Islamic Arabic can be considered a polycentric language.{{Sfn | Abd-el-Jawad | 1992 | p = 262}} In [[List of countries where Arabic is an official language|Arabic-speaking countries]] different levels of polycentricity can be detected.{{Sfn | Abd-el-Jawad | 1992 | p = 271}}
Modern Arabic is a pluricentric language with varying branches correlating with different regions where Arabic is spoken and the type of communities speaking it. The vernacular varieties of Arabic include [[Gulf Arabic]] (spoken in the Persian Gulf kingdoms of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait), [[Iraqi Arabic]], [[Levantine Arabic]] (spoken in Levantine countries of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine), [[Egyptian Arabic]], [[Sudanese Arabic]], and [[Maghrebi Arabic]] (spoken in Northwestern Africa), among many others. In addition, many speakers use [[Modern Standard Arabic]] in education and formal settings. Therefore, in Arabic-speaking communities, [[diglossia]] is frequent.

===Aramaic===
The [[Aramaic language]] is a pluricentric language, having many different literary standards, including [[Syriac language]], [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic]], [[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic]], [[Samaritan Aramaic language]], and [[Mandaic language]], and vernacular varieties of [[Neo-Aramaic languages]] like [[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]] ([[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]], [[Bohtan Neo-Aramaic]], [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]], [[Hértevin language]], [[Koy Sanjaq Syriac language]], [[Senaya language]]), [[Western Neo-Aramaic]], [[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]], [[Central Neo-Aramaic]] ([[Mlahsô language]], [[Turoyo language]]), [[Neo-Mandaic]], [[Hulaulá language]], [[Lishana Deni]], [[Lishanid Noshan]], [[Lishán Didán]], [[Betanure Jewish Neo-Aramaic]], and [[Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic]].

===Armenian===
The [[Armenian language]] is a pluricentric language with the liturgical [[Classical Armenian]] and two vernacular standards, [[Western Armenian]] and [[Eastern Armenian]].

===Catalan–Valencian–Balearic===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
The term "Catalan–Valencian–Balearic" is seldom used (for example, in a dictionary by Antoni Maria Alcover i Sureda).

This language is internationally known as [[Catalan language|Catalan]], as in [[Ethnologue]]. This is also the most commonly used name in [[Catalonia]], but also in [[Andorra]] and the [[Balearic Islands]], probably due to the prestige of the Central Catalan dialect spoken in and around [[Barcelona]]. However, in the [[Valencian Community]], the official name of this language is [[Valencian]]. One reason for this is political (see Serbo-Croatian for a similar situation), but this variant does have its own literary tradition that dates back to the [[Reconquista]].

Although mutually intelligible with other varieties of Catalan, Valencian has lexical peculiarities and its own spelling rules, which are set out by the [[Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua]], created in 1998. However, this institution recognizes that Catalan and Valencian are varieties of the same language. For their part, there are specific varieties in the two major Balearic islands, Mallorcan (mallorquí) in [[Mallorca]], Menorcan (menorquí) in [[Menorca]]. The [[University of the Balearic Islands]] is the language regulator for these varieties.

===Chinese===
Until the mid-20th century, most Chinese people spoke only their local [[varieties of Chinese]].
These varieties had diverged widely from the written form used by scholars, [[Literary Chinese]], which was modelled on the language of the [[Chinese classics]].
As a practical measure, officials of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|common language based on northern varieties]], known as ''Guānhuà'' (官話, literally "speech of officials"), known as ''Mandarin'' in English after the officials.
Knowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career, but it was never formally defined.&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the 20th century, Literary Chinese was replaced as the written standard by [[written vernacular Chinese]], which was based on [[Mandarin Chinese|northern dialects]].
In the 1930s a [[Standard Chinese|standard national language]] ''Guóyǔ'' (國語, literally "national language") was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the [[Beijing dialect]], but with vocabulary also drawn from other northern varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0-691-01468-5
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, the standard was known as ''Pǔtōnghuà'' (普通话/普通話, literally "common speech"), but was defined in the same way as ''Guóyǔ'' in the [[Republic of China]] now governing Taiwan.&lt;ref name="Norman"/&gt;  It also became one of the official languages of [[Singapore]], under the name ''Huáyǔ'' (华语/華語, literally "Chinese language").

Although the three standards remain close, they have diverged to some extent.  Most Chinese in Taiwan and Singapore came from the southeast coast of China, where the local dialects lack the retroflex initials /tʂ tʂʰ ʂ/ found in northern dialects, so that many speakers in those places do not distinguish them from the [[apical consonant|apical]] sibilants /ts tsʰ s/.  Similarly, retroflex codas (''[[erhua]]'') are typically avoided in Taiwan and Singapore.  There are also differences in vocabulary, with [[Taiwanese Mandarin]] including loanwords from [[Min Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Standard Singaporean Mandarin|Singaporean Mandarin]] borrowing words from English, [[Malay language|Malay]], Min and other southern Chinese varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Coptic===
The [[Coptic language]] was pluricentric with different written dialects like Sahidic and Bohairic.

===English===
English is a pluricentric language,&lt;ref&gt;David Crystal. 2003. ''A Dictionary of Linguistics &amp; Phonetics''. (Blackwell)&lt;br&gt;P.H. Matthews. 2007. ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of Linguistics''. (Oxford)&lt;/ref&gt; with [[American and British English differences|differences]] in pronunciation, vocabulary, spelling, etc., between the United Kingdom, North America, Ireland, English-speaking African countries, Singapore, India, and Oceania. Educated native English speakers using their version of one of the standard forms of English are almost completely mutually intelligible, but non-standard forms present significant dialectal variations, and are marked by reduced intelligibility.  English is usually considered a symmetric case of a pluricentric language, because there is no clear cultural dominance of one variety over others.

Statistically, however, [[American English]] speakers constitute more than 66% of native English speakers, with [[British English]] next with about 18% and other varieties such as [[Australian English]] and [[Canadian English]] having up to 7% each. {{citation needed|reason=this totals 98% but does not include Indian English or African English varieties|date=May 2017}} Due to globalization in recent decades, English is becoming increasingly decentralized{{Clarify|reason=why would globalization lead to decentralization?|date=December 2017}}, with daily use and statewide study of the language in schools growing in most regions of the world.

British and American English are the two most commonly taught varieties in the education systems where English is taught as a [[foreign language|second language]]. British English tends to predominate in former colonies where English is not the [[first language]] of the majority of the population, such as [[Malaysia]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Singapore]]. British English is also the primary form taught in the [[European Union]] and the rest of Europe. American English, in contrast, tends to dominate instruction in Latin America, Korea, Taiwan, China and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Yuko Goto Butler. "How Are Nonnative-English-Speaking Teachers Perceived by Young Learners?" ''TESOL Quarterly''. Vol. 41, No. 4 (Dec., 2007), pp. 731-755.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy J. Riney, Naoyuki Takagi &amp; Kumiko Inutsuka. "Phonetic Parameters and Perceptual Judgments of Accent in English by American and Japanese Listeners." ''TESOL Quarterly'' Vol. 39, No. 3 (Sep., 2005), pp. 441-466&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philippine English]] (which is predominantly spoken as a second language) has been primarily influenced by American English. The rise of the [[call center industry in the Philippines]] has encouraged some [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] to [[accent reduction|"polish" or neutralize their accents]] to make them more closely resemble the accents of their client countries.

Countries such as [[Australian English|Australia]], [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]], and [[Canadian English|Canada]] have their own well-established varieties of English which are the standard within those countries but are far more rarely taught overseas to second language learners.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The features, especially pronunciation, of the standard dialects of Australia and New Zealand resemble that of British English, while Canadian English more resembles American.

English was historically pluricentric when it was used across the independent kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] prior to the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] in 1707. [[English English]] and [[Scottish English]] are now subsections of British English.

===French===
{{unreferencedsection|date=September 2018}}
In the modern era, there are several major loci of the French language, including Parisian French (also known as [[Standard French]]), [[American French|North American French]] and [[African French]].

Until the early 20th century, the French language was highly variable in pronunciation and vocabulary within France, with varying dialects and degrees of intelligibility, the [[langues d'oïl]].  However, government policy made it so that the dialect of Paris would be the method of instruction in schools, and other dialects, like [[Norman dialect|Norman]], which has influence from Scandinavian languages,  were neglected.  Controversy still remains in France over the fact that the government recognizes them as languages of France, but provides no monetary support for them nor has the Constitutional Council of France ratified the Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.

North American French is the result of French colonization of the New World between the 17th and 18th centuries.  In many cases, it contains vocabulary and dialectal quirks not found in Standard Parisian French owing to history: most of the original settlers of [[Quebec]], [[Acadia]], and later what would become [[Louisiana]] and northern [[New England French|New England]] came from Northern and Northwest France, and would have spoken dialects like Norman, [[Poitevin dialect|Poitevin]], and [[Angevin dialect|Angevin]] with far fewer speaking the dialect of Paris. This, plus isolation from developments in France, most notably the drive for standardization by [[Académie française|L'Académie française]], make North American dialects of the language quite distinct. Acadian French, that which is spoken in New Brunswick, Canada, contains many vocabulary words that are much older than anything found in modern France, much of it having roots in the 17th century, and a distinct intonation.  Québécois, the largest of the dialects, has a distinct pronunciation that is not found in Europe in any measure and a greater difference in vowel pronunciation, and syntax tends to vary greatly.  Cajun French has some distinctions not found in Canada in that there is more vocabulary derived from both local Native American and African dialects and a pronunciation of the letter r that has disappeared in France entirely. It is rolled, and with heavier contact with the English language than any of the above the pronunciation has shifted to harder sounding consonants in the 20th century. Cajun French equally has been an oral language for generations and it is only recently that its syntax and features been adapted to French orthography.

Minor standards can also be found in Belgium and Switzerland, with a particular influence of Germanic languages on grammar and vocabulary, sometimes through the influence of local dialects. In Belgium, for example, various Germanic influences in spoken French are evident in Wallonia (for example, to ''blink'' in English, and ''blinken'' in German and Dutch, ''blinquer'' in [[Walloon language|Walloon]] and local French, ''cligner'' in standard French). ''Ring'' (''rocade'' or ''périphérique'' in standard French) is a common word in the three national languages for [[beltway]] or ring road. Also, in Belgium and Switzerland, there are noted differences in the number system when compared to standard Parisian or Canadian French, notably in the use of ''septante'', ''octante/huitante'' and ''nonante'' for the numbers ''seventy'', ''eighty'', and ''ninety''. In other standards of French, these numbers are usually denoted ''soixante-dix'' (sixty-ten), ''quatre-vingts'' (four-twenties) and ''quatre-vingt-dix'' (four-twenties-and-ten).
French varieties spoken in [[Oceania]] are also influenced by local languages. New Caledonian French is influenced by [[Kanak languages]] in its vocabulary and grammatical structure.
[[African French]] is another variety.

===German===
[[Standard German]] is often considered an asymmetric pluricentric language;{{Sfn | Ammon | 1995 | pp = 484-499}} [[German Standard German|the standard used in Germany]] is often considered dominant, mostly because of the sheer number of its speakers and their frequent lack of awareness of the [[Austrian Standard German]] and [[Swiss Standard German]] varieties. Although there is a uniform stage pronunciation based on a manual by [[Theodor Siebs]] that is used in theatres, and, nowadays to a lesser extent, in radio and television news all across German-speaking countries, this is not true for the standards applied at public occasions in Austria, South Tyrol and Switzerland, which differ in [[pronunciation]], [[vocabulary]], and sometimes even [[grammar]]. In Switzerland, the letter [[ß]] has been removed from the alphabet, with ''ss'' as its replacement. Sometimes this even applies to news broadcasts in [[Bavaria]], a German state with a strong separate cultural identity. The varieties of Standard German used in those regions are to some degree influenced by the respective [[dialect]]s (but by no means identical to them), by specific cultural traditions (e.g. in culinary vocabulary, which differs markedly across the German-speaking area of Europe), and by different terminology employed in law and administration. A list of Austrian terms for certain food items has even been incorporated into [[EU law]], even though it is clearly incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/translation/german/guidelines/documents/austrian_expressions_de.pdf |title=Protokoll Nr. 10 über die Verwendung spezifisch österreichischer Ausdrücke der deutschen Sprache im Rahmen der Europäischen Union |publisher=European Commission |access-date=13 November 2015 |format=PDF |language=German |trans-title=Protocol number 10 on the usage of specific Austrian terms of the German language within the European Union |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305081116/http://ec.europa.eu/translation/german/guidelines/documents/austrian_expressions_de.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindi, Urdu, and Hindustani languages===
The [[Hindi Belt|Hindi languages]] are a large [[dialect continuum]] defined as a unit culturally. The medieval [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] was based on a register of Delhi's [[Khariboli dialect]] and has two modern standard forms, [[Hindi|Standard Hindi]] and [[Urdu|Standard Urdu]]. Additionally, there are historical literary standards, such as the closely related [[Braj Bhasha]] and the more distant [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]], as well as recently established standard languages based on what were once considered Hindi dialects: [[Maithili language|Maithili]] and [[Dogri language|Dogri]]. Other varieties, such as [[Rajasthani languages|Rajasthani]], are often considered distinct languages but have no standard form. [[Caribbean Hindi]] and [[Fijian Hindi]] also differ significantly from the [[Sanskritized]] standard [[Hindi]] spoken in India.

===Malayalam===
The Malayalam language is a pluricentric language with historically more than one written form. Although modern [[Malayalam script]] (also known as Aryanezhuthu) is officially recognized, there are other standardized varieties such as [[Arabi Malayalam]] of [[Muslim Mappila|Mappila Muslims]], [[Karshoni]] of [[Saint Thomas Christians]] and [[Judeo-Malayalam]] of [[Cochin Jews]].

===Persian===
The [[Persian language|Persian]] language has three standardized varieties with official status in [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]] (officially named [[Dari (Persian)|Dari]]) and [[Tajikistan]] (officially named [[Tajik language|Tajik]]). The standard dialect of Iran is based on [[Tehrani accent|Tehrani dialect]], the standard dialect of Dari based on [[Kabul]]i dialect, and the standard dialect of Tajik based on [[Dushanbe]] dialect. Iranian Persian and Afghan Persian equally utilize the [[Perso-Arabic]] script in writing. Tajik Persian as used in Tajikistan utilizes a modified form of the [[Cyrillic]] alphabet, although attempts at re-introducing Perso-Arabic script are being made.

===Portuguese===
Apart from the [[Reintegrationism|Galician question]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] varies mainly between [[Brazilian Portuguese]] and [[European Portuguese]]. Both varieties have undergone significant and divergent developments in phonology and the grammar of their [[pronominal]] systems. The result is that communication between the two varieties of the language without previous exposure can be occasionally difficult.

Brazilian and European Portuguese currently have two distinct, albeit similar, spelling standards. A [[Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement of 1990|unified orthography]] for the two varieties (including a limited number of words with dual spelling) has been approved by the national legislatures of Brazil and Portugal and is now official; see [[Spelling reforms of Portuguese]] for additional details. Formal written standards remain grammatically close to each other, despite some minor syntactic differences.

[[African Portuguese]] and [[Portuguese language in Asia|Asian Portuguese]] are based on the standard European dialect, but have undergone their own phonetic and grammatical developments, sometimes reminiscent of the spoken Brazilian variant.

===Serbo-Croatian===

===Swedish===

Two varieties exist,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} though only one written standard remains (regulated by the [[Swedish Academy]] of Sweden): ''[[Rikssvenska]]'' (literally "Realm Swedish"), the official language of Sweden, and ''[[Finlandssvenska]]'' (in Finland known as "Högsvenska"), which, alongside Finnish, is the other official language of Finland. There are differences in vocabulary and grammar, with the variety used in Finland remaining a little more conservative. The most marked differences are in pronunciation and intonation: Whereas Swedish speakers usually pronounce {{IPA|/k/}} before [[front vowel]]s as {{IPAblink|ɕ}}, this sound is usually pronounced by a Swedo-Finn as {{IPAblink|t͡ʃ}}; in addition, the two tones that are characteristic of Swedish (and Norwegian) are absent from most Finnish dialects of Swedish, which have an intonation reminiscent of Finnish and thus sound more monotonous when compared to ''Rikssvenska''.

There are dialects that could be considered different languages due to long periods of isolation and geographical separation from the central dialects of Svealand and Götaland that came to constitute the base for the standard ''Rikssvenska''. Dialects such as [[Elfdalian]], [[Jamtlandic dialects|Jamtlandic]], [[Westrobothnian]] and [[Gutnish]] all differ as much, or more, from standard Swedish than the standard varieties of [[Danish language|Danish]]. Some of them have a standardized orthography, but the Swedish government has not granted any of them official recognition as regional languages and continues to look upon them as dialects of Swedish. Most of them are severely endangered and spoken by elderly people in the countryside. In the case of Westrobothnian the pejorative "bondska" is widespread, derived from the word for peasant, thus leading people to believe that it has something to do with peasantry or farming although the dialects have been spoken in all parts of society for over 1000 years.

Some Swedish dialects spoken along the coast of Finnish [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnia]] could be considered languages different from standard Swedish because they are developments of [[Old Norse]] that historically have had very little influence from standard Swedish.

===Others===
* Standard [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]] and possibly [[Manx language|Manx]] can be viewed as three standards arisen through divergence from the [[Early Modern Irish|Classical Gaelic]] norm via orthographic reforms.
* [[Komi language|Komi]], a Uralic language spoken in northeastern European Russia, has official standards for its [[Komi-Zyrian language|Komi-Zyrian]] and [[Komi-Permyak language|Komi-Permyak]] dialects.
* Korean: North and South (to some extent—differences are growing; see [[North–South differences in the Korean language]])
* [[Kurdish language]] has two main literary norms: [[Kurmanji]] (Northern Kurdish) and [[Sorani]] (Central Kurdish). The [[Zaza–Gorani languages]], spoken by some Kurds, are occasionally considered to be Kurdish as well.
* From a purely linguistic viewpoint, [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] are two normative varieties of the same language ([[Malay language|Malay]]). Both languages are historically considered variants of the same language, and some parties still treat these variants equally as such&lt;ref&gt;As an example of equal treatment with Malaysian and Indonesian: the ''Pusat Rujukan Persuratan Melayu'' database from the [[Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka]] has a "Istilah [[Majlis Bahasa Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia|MABBIM]]" section dedicated to documenting Malaysian, Indonesian and Bruneian official terminologies: [http://prpm.dbp.gov.my/Cari1?keyword=language&amp;d=286464&amp;#LIHATSINI see example]&lt;/ref&gt; while some parties consider them separate due to the growing divergence between the two varianrs and for political reasons.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Nevertheless, they retain some degree of mutual intelligibility despite a number of differences in vocabulary and grammar. The Malay language itself has many local dialects and creolized versions, whereas the "Indonesian language", the standardized variety in [[Indonesia]] acting as a ''lingua franca'' of the country, has received a great number of international and local influences. (''See: [[Differences between Malaysian and Indonesian]].)
* [[Modern Hebrew]] is grammatically and lexically uniform, but Israelis from different cultural backgrounds have different ways of pronunciation, all of which are considered standard and correct by language authorities. Among the ways of pronunciation are [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]], [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]], [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]], and [[Yemenite Hebrew|Temani]] (which is considered{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} the closest to the original pronunciation of Hebrew in biblical times). Hebrew is therefore probably the only pluricentric language where differences in pronunciation do not depend on the speaker's place of birth but on their cultural background.
* [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] consists of a multitude of spoken dialects displaying a great deal of variation in pronunciation and (to a somewhat lesser extent) vocabulary, with no officially recognized "standard spoken Norwegian" (but see [[Urban East Norwegian]]). All Norwegian dialects are mutually intelligible. There are two written standards: [[Bokmål]], "book language", based on Danish (Danish and Norwegian are mutually intelligible languages with significant differences primarily in pronunciation rather than vocabulary or grammar) and modern Western Norwegian dialects (the [[Bergen]] dialect was a major contributor), and [[Nynorsk]], "New Norwegian", based primarily on rural Western and rural inland Norwegian dialects.
*[[Pashto]] has three official standard varieties: [[Central Pashto]], which is the most prestigious{{cn|date=November 2018}} standard dialect (also used in [[Kabul]]), [[Northern Pashto]], and [[Southern Pashto]].
* Romance languages
** [[Romanian language|Romanian]] in Romania (based on [[Wallachian dialect]]) and that in Moldova (based on [[Moldavian dialect]]) during the Soviet era, but nowadays Romania and Moldova use the same standard of [[Romanian language|Romanian]] 
** [[Romansh language|Romansh]], with five written standards (from southwest to northeast: Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, Vallader) as well as a [[Romansh language#Standardization|"compromise" form]].
* [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]] (Prešov, [[Lemkos#Language|Lemko]], [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Pannonian]]) are either considered to be standardized varieties of the same language or separate languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23341">A '''professional learning community''' ('''PLC''') is a method to foster [[collaborative learning]] among colleagues within a particular work environment or field. It is often used in schools as a way to organize teachers into working groups of [[practice-based professional learning]].

==History==
The phrase ''professional learning community'' began to be used in the 1990s after [[Peter Senge]]'s book ''[[The Fifth Discipline]]'' (1990) had popularized the idea of [[learning organization]]s,&lt;ref name="Senge"&gt;{{cite book |last=Senge |first=Peter M. |authorlink=Peter Senge |date=2006 |origyear=1990 |title=The fifth discipline: the art and practice of the learning organization |edition=Revised |location=New York |publisher=Currency/Doubleday |isbn=0385517254 |oclc=65166960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thompson |first1=Sue C. |last2=Gregg |first2=Larry |last3=Niska |first3=John M. |date=January 2004 |title=Professional learning communities, leadership, and student learning |journal=RMLE Online |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |doi=10.1080/19404476.2004.11658173 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ807417.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} related to the idea of [[reflective practice]] espoused by [[Donald Schön]] in books such as ''The Reflective Turn: Case Studies in and on Educational Practice'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Schön |editor-first=Donald A. |editor-link=Donald Schön |date=1991 |title=The reflective turn: case studies in and on educational practice |location=New York |publisher=[[Teachers College Press]] |isbn=0807730467 |oclc=22110784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lieberman |first=Ann |date=April 1995 |title=Practices that support teacher development: transforming conceptions of professional learning |journal=[[Phi Delta Kappan]] |volume=76 |issue=8 |pages=591–596}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles B. Myers and Lynn K. Myers used the phrase ''professional learning community'' in relation to schools in their 1995 book ''The Professional Educator: A New Introduction to Teaching and Schools'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Myers |first1=Charles B. |last2=Myers |first2=Lynn K. |date=1995 |title=The professional educator: a new introduction to teaching and schools |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=[[Wadsworth Publishing]] |isbn=0534205747 |oclc=31009967}} See also: {{cite book |last1=Myers |first1=Charles B. |last2=Simpson |first2=Douglas J. |date=1998 |title=Re-creating schools: places where everyone learns and likes it |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=[[Corwin Press]] |isbn=0803964250 |oclc=37353705}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a year later Charles B. Myers presented a paper at the annual meeting of the [[American Educational Research Association]] titled "Beyond the PDS: Schools as Professional Learning Communities" that proposed a path from professional development school (PDS) efforts to schools as professional learning communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Myers |first=Charles B. |date=April 1996 |title=Beyond the PDS: schools as professional learning communities: a proposal based on an analysis of PDS efforts of the 1990s |publisher=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the [[American Educational Research Association]], New York City, April 8–12, 1996 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED400227.pdf |accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Shirley M. Hord issued a [[white paper]] titled "Professional Learning Communities: Communities of Continuous Inquiry and Improvement".&lt;ref name="Hord"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hord |first=Shirley M. |date=1997 |title=Professional learning communities: communities of continuous inquiry and improvement |publisher=[[White paper]] issued by Southwest Educational Development Laboratory, Austin, TX and funded by the [[Office of Educational Research and Improvement]], [[United States Department of Education]] |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED410659.pdf |accessdate=27 October 2016}} A summary of the white paper was published as: {{cite journal |last=Hord |first=Shirley M. |date=1997 |title=Professional learning communities: what are they and why are they important? |journal=Issues about Change |volume=6 |issue=1 |url=http://www.sedl.org/change/issues/issues61.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, [[Richard DuFour]] and Robert E. Eaker published the book ''Professional Learning Communities at Work''.&lt;ref name="DuFourEaker"&gt;{{cite book |last1=DuFour |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard DuFour |last2=Eaker |first2=Robert E. |date=1998 |title=Professional learning communities at work: best practices for enhancing student achievement |location=Bloomington; Alexandria, VA |publisher=National Educational Service; [[Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development]] |isbn=1879639602 |oclc=39040733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1990s, a large literature on PLCs has been published.&lt;ref&gt;A search for the phrase on [[Google Scholar]] on 27 October 2016 returned over 17,000 results.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
PLCs have many variations. In Shirley M. Hord's 1997 definition, it means "extending classroom practice into the community; bringing community personnel into the school to enhance the curriculum and learning tasks for students; or engaging students, teachers, and administrators simultaneously in learning".&lt;ref name="Hord"/&gt;{{rp|1}} Hord noted that the benefits of professional learning community to educators and students include reduced isolation of teachers, better informed and committed teachers, and academic gains for students.&lt;ref name="Hord"/&gt; In 1998, Richard DuFour and Robert E. Eaker explained:

{{Quote|text=If schools are to be significantly more effective, they must break from the industrial model upon which they were created and embrace a new model that enables them to function as learning organizations. We prefer characterizing learning organizations as "professional learning communities" for several vital reasons. While the term "organization" suggests a partnership enhanced by efficiency, expediency, and mutual interests, "community" places greater emphasis on relationships, shared ideals, and a strong culture—all factors that are critical to school improvement. The challenge for educators is to create a community of commitment—a professional learning community. [...] It sounds simple enough, but as the old adage warns, "the devil is in the details." Educators willing to embrace the concept of the school as a professional learning community will be given ambiguous, oftentimes conflicting advice on how they should proceed. |author=[[Richard DuFour]] and Robert E. Eaker |source=''Professional Learning Communities at Work''&lt;ref name="DuFourEaker"/&gt;{{rp|15–16}} }}

In 2004, DuFour stated that initiating and sustaining a PLC "requires the school staff to focus on learning rather than teaching, work collaboratively on matters related to learning, and hold itself accountable for the kind of results that fuel continual improvement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=DuFour |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard DuFour |date=May 2004 |title=What is a 'professional learning community'? |journal=Educational Leadership |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=6–11 |url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/may04/vol61/num08/What-Is-a-Professional-Learning-Community%C2%A2.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} In 2005, the [[Ontario Ministry of Education]] defined a PLC as "a shared vision for running a school in which everyone can make a contribution, and staff are encouraged to collectively undertake activities and reflection in order to constantly improve their students' performance".&lt;ref name="EFA"&gt;{{cite book |title=Education for all: the report of the expert panel on literacy and numeracy instruction for students with special education needs, kindergarten to grade 6 |date=2005 |url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/reports/speced/panel/speced.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003084018/http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/reports/speced/panel/speced.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2006 |accessdate=16 November 2006 |location=Toronto |publisher=[[Ministry of Education (Ontario)]] |isbn=0779480600 |oclc=225161136}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}}

[[Michael Fullan]] has noted that "in the spread of PLCs, we have found that the term travels a lot faster than the concept, a finding common to all innovations. The concept is deep and requires careful and persistent attention in thorough learning by reflective doing and problem solving."&lt;ref name="Fullan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fullan |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Fullan |date=2016 |origyear=1982 |chapter=Enter change |title=The NEW meaning of educational change |edition=5th |location=New York |publisher=[[Teachers College Press]] |isbn=9780807756805 |oclc=921102633 |pages=107–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fullan also noted: "Transforming the ''culture'' of schools and the systems within which they operate is the main point. It is not an innovation to be implemented, but rather a new culture to be developed."&lt;ref name="Fullan"/&gt;

==Attributes==
There are many core characteristics of PLCs including collective teamwork in which leadership and responsibility for student [[learning]] are extensively shared, a focus on [[Self-reflection|reflective]] [[inquiry]] and [[dialogue]] among educators, collective emphasis on improving student learning, shared values and norms, and development of common practices and [[feedback]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stoll |first1=Louise |last2=Bolam |first2=Ray |last3=McMahon |first3=Agnes |last4=Wallace |first4=Mike |last5=Thomas |first5=Sally |date=December 2006 |title=Professional learning communities: a review of the literature |journal=Journal of Educational Change |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=221–258 |doi=10.1007/s10833-006-0001-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 report by the [[Ontario Ministry of Education]] titled ''Education for All'' indicates the characteristics of PLCs are as follows:&lt;ref name="EFA"/&gt;{{rp|54}}

*Shared vision and values that lead to a collective commitment of school staff, which is expressed in day-to-day practices
*Solutions actively sought, openness to new ideas
*Working teams cooperate to achieve common goals
*Encouragement of experimentation as an opportunity to learn
*Questioning of the status quo, leading to an ongoing quest for improvement and professional learning
*Continuous improvement based on evaluation of outcomes rather than on the intentions expressed
*Reflection in order to study the operation and impacts of actions taken

==Supporting conditions==
Around the time that the term ''professional learning community'' was coined, a group of education researchers became interested in the similar idea of "professional community" in schools.&lt;ref name="Kruse"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kruse |first1=Sharon |last2=Louis |first2=Karen Seashore |last3=Bryk |first3=Anthony |date=Spring 1994 |title=Building professional community in schools |journal=Issues in Restructuring Schools |issue=6 |pages=3–6 |url=http://www.wcer.wisc.edu/archive/cors/issues_in_restructuring_schools/issues_no_6_spring_1994.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anfara"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anfara |first1=Vincent A. |last2=Caskey |first2=Micki M. |last3=Carpenter |first3=Jan |date=August 2015 |title=Organizational models for teacher learning |journal=Middle School Journal |volume=43 |pages=52–62 |doi=10.1080/00940771.2012.11461830 |url=http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/ci_fac/6/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on data they collected in their research for the Center on Organization and Restructuring of Schools, Sharon Kruse, Karen Seashore Louis, and Anthony Bryk developed a three-part framework to describe the critical elements and supportive conditions that are necessary to establish a healthy "professional" culture.&lt;ref name="Kruse"/&gt; The components of this framework are described in the following table. Kruse and colleagues found that "in schools where professional community is strong, teachers work together more effectively, and put more efforts into creating and sustaining opportunities for student learning."&lt;ref name="Kruse" /&gt; They also suggested that the social and human resources are more important than the structural conditions in the development of professional community.

==Use of data==
{{Expand section|with=further examples of use of data in PLCs|date=May 2017}}
In their 2015 examination of middle school mathematics teachers' collaborative conversations regarding student data, Jason Brasel, Brette Garner, Britnie Kane and Ilana Horn found that the teachers used data to answer four questions:&lt;ref name="Horn"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Brasel |first1=Jason |last2=Garner |first2=Brette |last3=Kane |first3=Britnie |last4=Horn |first4=Ilana |date=November 2015 |title=Getting to the why and how: what kinds of conversations about data bring about the greatest improvements in math teaching and learning? |journal=Education Leadership |volume=73 |issue=3 |url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/nov15/vol73/num03/Getting-to-the-Why-and-How.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "''What'' do we need to reteach?"
* "To ''whom'' do we need to reteach it?"
* "''Why'' did students struggle with this?"
* "''How'' do we reteach it?"

The matrix in the following table shows how Brasel and colleagues found that the teachers combined these four questions to learn about two dimensions of teaching: student thinking and instruction.&lt;ref name="Horn"/&gt; The authors found that while the most productive collaborative discussions—that allowed the teachers to learn more about mathematics content, students and pedagogy—focused more on ''why'' and ''how'', the teachers tended to address only the first two questions, ''what'' and to ''whom''. While these conversations were helpful in identifying students in need of remediation, they did little in the way to improve instruction in the long run.&lt;ref name="Horn"/&gt;

==Staff development==

===Barriers to implementation===
Teachers and other educators can feel as if they are pawns in a larger game of chess where school and district leaders are making decisions that cause problems for educators trying to do their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buffum |first1=Austin |last2=Hinman |first2=Charles |date=May 2006 |title=Professional learning communities: reigniting passion and purpose |journal=Leadership |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}} Barriers that can inhibit the development of PLCs include subject areas, because some educational subjects tend to naturally take precedence over others.&lt;ref name="RileyStoll"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riley |first1=Kathryn |last2=Stoll |first2=Louise |date=Winter 2004 |title=Inside-out and outside-in: why schools need to think about communities in new ways |journal=Education Review |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}} The physical layout of the school can be another obstacle.&lt;ref name="RileyStoll"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

In the book ''Intentional Interruption: Breaking Down Learning Barriers to Professional Practice'', Steven Katz and Lisa Ain Dack identified six mental barriers to learning in PLCs: "we don't think through all possibilities; we focus on confirming our hypotheses and not challenging them; we pay too much attention to things that are vivid; we consider ourselves to be exceptions; we hesitate to take action in a new direction; we don't want others to see our vulnerabilities".&lt;ref name="KatzDack"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Katz |first1=Steven |last2=Dack |first2=Lisa A. |date=2015 |title=Intentional interruption: breaking down learning barriers to transform professional practice |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=[[Corwin Press]] |isbn=9781412998796 |oclc=795172349}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51–68}} Katz and Dack opt for a psychological definition of learning: "Learning is the process through which experience causes permanent change in knowledge or behaviour".&lt;ref name="KatzDack" /&gt;{{rp|14}} It is the characteristic of permanence which raises the bar for all professional learning, because learning as permanent change is not easy or natural to achieve.&lt;ref name="KatzDack" /&gt;{{rp|15–17}} Katz and Dack urge designers of professional learning to avoid the "activity trap" of assuming that participation in a protocol or process guarantees real learning has occurred or putting so much emphasis on the activity that learning is lost in the shuffle.&lt;ref name="KatzDack" /&gt;{{rp|77–78}}

Because of these difficulties many teachers are turning to [[the web]] for PLCs. Teachers are finding groups through [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and other [[social media]] websites that allow them to interact with teachers from across their country to brainstorm and exchange ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holmes |first1=Kathryn |last2=Preston |first2=Greg |last3=Shaw |first3=Kylie |last4=Buchanan |first4=Rachel |date=December 2013 |title='Follow' me: networked professional learning for teachers |journal=Australian Journal of Teacher Education |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=55–65 |doi=10.14221/ajte.2013v38n12.4 |url=http://ro.ecu.edu.au/ajte/vol38/iss12/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups can be helpful for those with PLCs already at their current school and those without PLCs.

===Staff as a community===
A PLC can be seen as an effective staff development team approach and a strategy for school improvement. The PLC process aims to be a reflective process where both individual and community growth is achieved, connected with the school's shared vision for learning. In his book ''The Fifth Discipline'', Peter Senge commented on the importance of building shared vision:

{{Quote|text=The practice of shared vision involves the skills of unearthing shared "pictures of the future" that foster genuine commitment and enrollment rather than compliance. In mastering this discipline, leaders learn the counter-productiveness of trying to dictate a vision, no matter how heartfelt. |author=[[Peter Senge]] |source=''[[The Fifth Discipline]]''&lt;ref name="Senge"/&gt;{{rp|9}} }}

Creation of a shared vision involves sharing diverse ideas and making [[compromise]]s so that all members are satisfied with the direction in which the organization is moving. Conflicting goals can become a source of positive development: "Top-down mandates and bottom-up energies need each other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fullan |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Fullan |date=1999 |title=Change forces: the sequel |location=London; Philadelphia |publisher=Falmer Press |isbn=0750707569 |oclc=41363236}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}}

Through this commitment and creation of a shared vision the team may become empowered to work together and achieve goals. As teachers' capacity increases and they develop a sense of professional growth, they may find they are able to reach goals they could not reach on their own.

In an educational setting, a PLC may include people from multiple levels of the organization who are collaboratively and continually working together for the betterment of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darling-Hammond |first1=Linda |last2=Wei |first2=Ruth Chung |last3=Andree |first3=Alethea |last4=Richardson |first4=Nikole |last5=Orphanos |first5=Stelios |date=2009 |title=Professional learning in the learning profession: a status report on teacher development in the U.S. and abroad: technical report |location=Dallas, TX; Stanford, CA |publisher=National Staff Development Council; School Redesign Network |oclc=912261565 |url=http://learningforward.org/docs/pdf/nsdcstudy2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Senge believes "it is no longer sufficient to have one person learning for the organization".&lt;ref name="Senge 2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Senge |first=Peter M. |authorlink=Peter Senge |date=2013 |origyear=2000 |chapter=Give me a lever long enough... and single-handed I can move the world |editor-last=Grogan |editor-first=Margaret |title=The Jossey-Bass reader on educational leadership |edition=3rd |location=San Francisco |publisher=[[Jossey-Bass]] |pages=3–16 |isbn=9781118456217 |oclc=829055889 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} A major principle of PLCs is that people learn more together than if they were on their own, if conditions are right.&lt;ref name="KatzDack"/&gt; Teachers may promote the idea of team learning to students in their classrooms, but teachers may not practice team learning in their professional lives; PLCs aim to help teachers practice the team learning that they preach. Senge suggests that when teams learn together there are beneficial results for the organization.&lt;ref name="Senge 2000"/&gt; Some school improvement evaluators have even claimed that "high-quality collaboration has become no less than an imperative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gajda |first1=Rebecca |last2=Koliba |first2=Christopher |date=March 2007 |title=Evaluating the imperative of intraorganizational collaboration: a school improvement perspective |journal=[[American Journal of Evaluation]] |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=26–44 |doi=10.1177/1098214006296198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
For a school to be fully committed to implementing PLCs, the school's leadership must help establish and maintain PLCs.&lt;ref name="DuFourEaker"/&gt; Successful PLCs will require a shift in the traditional leadership structure from leader-centered (top-down) to shared leadership.&lt;ref name="DuFourEaker"/&gt; Sue C. Thompson and her colleagues pointed out how many educators often feel that "new ideas that came from someone else without teacher input" are a waste of time and do not qualify as true leadership or support.&lt;ref name="Thompson2004"/&gt;{{rp|4}} In a PLC, the view of the principal as the instructional leader changes to a view that reflects the principal as a member of a community of learners and leaders.&lt;ref name="DuFourEaker"/&gt;

'''Proto-Finnic''' or '''Proto-Baltic-Finnic''' is the common ancestor of the [[Finnic languages]], which include the national languages [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. Proto-Finnic is not attested in any texts, but has been [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] by linguists. Proto-Finnic is itself descended ultimately from [[Proto-Uralic language|Proto-Uralic]].

==Background==
Three stages of Proto-Finnic are distinguished in literature.

* '''Early Proto-Finnic''', the last common ancestor of the Finnic languages and its closest external relatives — usually understood to be the [[Sami languages]], though also the [[Mordvinic languages]] may derive from this stage (see [[Finno-Samic languages]]). This reconstruction state appears to be almost identical to Proto-Uralic.
* '''Middle Proto-Finnic''', an earlier stage in the development on Finnic, used in Kallio (2007) for the point at which the language had developed its most characteristic differences from [[Proto-Uralic language|Proto-Uralic]] (mainly: the loss of several consonant phonemes from the segment inventory, including all [[palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] consonants).
* '''Late Proto-Finnic''', the last common ancestor of Finnish and Estonian, and hence of the [[Gulf of Finland]] Finnic subgroup. [[South Estonian]] and the [[Livonian language]] had already diverged at this point.

===Changes up to Late Proto-Finnic===

* ''*ï'' &gt; ''*a''. This change is shared by several other western Uralic languages, including the Sami and Mordvinic languages.
* ''*ä...ä'' &gt; ''*a...e''.
* Word-initial deaffrication:{{sfn|Kallio|2007|p=231}}{{sfn|Posti|1953|pp=10–21}}
** ''*č'' &gt; ''*š''.
** ''*ć'' &gt; ''*ś''.
* ''*ŋ'' and ''*x'' are lost as phonemes. Between vowels they are usually lost entirely, triggering lengthening of a preceding vowel.{{sfn|Kallio|2007|pp=231–233}}{{sfn|Itkonen|1949}}
** In certain cases, this may have proceeded through vocalization to ''*w''. Compare e.g. PU ''*mexi-'' &gt; PF ''*möö-'' "to sell"; PU ''*sewi-'' &gt; PF ''*söö-'' "to eat".
** Before dental/alveolar consonants, both consonants usually vocalize to ''*w''.{{sfn|Janhunen|2007|pp=221–222}}&lt;!--I'd appreciate if you could refrain for the time being from adding the soundlaw *ŋś &gt; *js here; I have a paper forthcoming that shows this reconstruction to be mistaken. —Tropylium--&gt;
** The cluster ''*ŋk'' remains, but ''*ŋ'' in this case is now simply an allophone of ''*n'' rather than an independent phoneme.
* Depalatalisation:{{sfn|Kallio|2007|p=233}}{{sfn|Posti|1953|pp=26–29}}
** ''*ć'' &gt; ''*c''.
** ''*ś'' &gt; ''*s''.
** ''*δ́'' &gt; ''*δ''.
** ''*ń'' &gt; ''*n''.
** ''*ĺ'' &gt; ''*l''.
* Lengthening of open vowels:{{sfn|Aikio|2012}}
** ''*a'' &gt; ''*oo'' (including former ''*ï'') and ''*ä'' &gt; ''*ee'', when the vowels appear
**# in an open syllable, and
**# followed by a non-semivowel sonorant consonant (*m, *n, *l, *r, *δ), and
**# followed by an original non-open vowel *i (also denoted *ə, *e).
** E.g.: PU ''*ńäli-'' &gt; PF ''*ńeele-'' "to swallow"; PU ''*ńëli'' &gt; PF ''*nooli'' "arrow"
* ''*δ'' &gt; ''*t''.{{sfn|Kallio|2007|p=233}}{{sfn|Posti|1953|pp=83–85}}
* Sequences of a vowel and syllable-final semivowel ''*j'' or ''*w'' are reinterpreted as diphthongs: ''*aj'' &gt; ''*ai'', ''*aw'' &gt; ''*au'' etc. Consequently, these consonants can no longer close a syllable (relevant for consonant gradation). Any diphthongs ending in ''*u'' become subject to vowel harmony and split into ''*u'' and ''*ü'' accordingly.
* Monophthongisation of some diphthongs in non-initial syllables:
** ''*au'' &gt; ''*o''
** ''*ei'' &gt; ''*i''
** ''*eu'' &gt; ''*u'', ''*eü'' &gt; ''*ü''
* Word-final ''*-e'' becomes ''*-i''.
* ''*ti'' is [[Assibilation|assibilated]] to ''*ci''.
** The change was blocked if another coronal obstruent preceded, i.e. ''*tti'', ''*cti'', ''*sti'', ''*šti'' (thus Finnish ''kaksi'' "two" ~ ''kahden'' &lt; Pre-Proto-Finnic ''*kakti'', but ''lehti'' "leaf" ~ ''lehden'' &lt; ''*lešti'').
** The change was fed by ''*ei'' &gt; ''*i'', which also caused assibilation.
* Apocope of final ''*-i'' when at least two syllables preceded. This occurred after assibilation, which created alternations between final ''*-c'' and medial ''*-t-'' in some nouns (e.g. Finnish nouns in ''-us'', genitive ''-uden'', essive ''-utena'').
* Syncope/contraction of medial ''*-e-'' between ''*c'', ''*l'', ''*n'', ''*r'', ''*s'', ''*š'', ''*t'' and a following ''*k'', ''*n'' or ''*t''. Syncope was prevented if more than one consonant followed the ''*-e-''. If more than one consonant preceded, consonant clusters were often simplified by dropping the first member of the cluster.
** Examples of syncope before ''*t'' are widespread, owing to the many endings beginning with this consonant, including the partitive singular, genitive plural, infinitive and various passive forms. Finnish examples are ''vesi'' "water", partitive ''vettä'' (&lt; ''*vetetä''), ''lohi'' "salmon", partitive ''lohta'' (&lt; ''*lošeta''), ''purra'' "to bite" (&lt; ''*purdak'' &lt; ''*puretak'').
** Syncope before ''*n'' was also regular, but there were fewer environments in which it could occur. It occurred most notably in the potential mood and the past active participle of verbs. Many of the clusters ending in ''*n'' were later simplified by assimilation, either by assimilating the ''*n'' to the preceding consonant, or in some cases the reverse. Finnish examples are ''purren'', ''purrut'' (forms of ''purra'' "bite"; &lt; ''*purnen'', ''*purnut'' &lt; ''*purenen'', ''*purenut''), ''pessen'', ''pessyt'' (forms of ''pestä'' "to wash", &lt; ''*pesnen'', ''*pesnüt'' &lt; ''*pesenen'', ''*pesenüt''). Contraction also occurred in the essive singular of nominals, but these forms were often restored analogically. Finnish still possesses a few obsolete or fossilised cases of contracted essives, e.g. ''toissa'' "on the second-last (time)" (&lt; ''*toicna'' &lt; ''*toicena''), a fossilised essive form of ''toinen'' "second".
** Syncope before ''*k'' was regular but there were few environments in which it could occur. It is seen primarily in imperative forms of verbs, which are formed with a ''-k-'' suffix. Finnish examples are ''olkaa'' (imperative of ''olla'' "be"; &lt; ''*olkade'' &lt; ''*volekate''), ''maatkaa'' (forms of ''maata'' "lie down"; &lt; ''*magatkate'' &lt; ''*makatekate'').
** Syncope also occurred between ''*m'' and ''*t'' in several cases, giving ''*-nt-''. This occurred perhaps in all cases, but it was reverted later in many cases. An example in Finnish is ''lumi'' "snow", partitive ''lunta'' (&lt; Pre-Proto-Finnic ''*lumeta''). Older Finnish had more examples of this, which were later restored by analogy.
** Two words show the contraction ''*-ket-'' &gt; ''*-kt-'': ''*näktäk'' "to see" &lt; ''*näketäk'' (Finnish ''nähdä'') and ''*tektäk'' "to do" &lt; ''*teketäk'' (Finnish ''tehdä'').
* Application of radical gradation in closed syllables, causing voicing of short obstruents and shortening of geminate stops. This occurred after apocope, or was still productive at the time, as the newly consonant-final syllables resulting from apocope triggered gradation as well.
* ''*š'' &gt; ''*h''
** The clusters ''*tš'' and ''*kš'' lose their first component to also become simple ''*h''.
* ''*č'' &gt; ''*t'', but ''*čk'' develops differently in South Estonian, see below.
* In non-initial syllables, low-vowel i-diphthongs are raised:
** ''*äi'' &gt; ''*ei''
** ''*ai'' &gt; ''*oi'' when the preceding syllable contains a non-rounded vowel.
** ''*ai'' &gt; ''*ei'' elsewhere.
** Some time after this change, ''*ei'' &gt; ''*i'' again in non-initial syllables. This latter change occurred late in Proto-Finnic and did not trigger assibilation as the earlier ''*ei'' &gt; ''*i'' change did. It also followed the southern Finnic backing of ''*e'' to ''*ë'' (Estonian ''õ'' etc.) in back-harmony words, as only ''*ei'' was affected, while ''*ëi'' remained unchanged. Thus, different Finnic varieties show different outcomes, such as: ''*muna'' "egg", plural stem ''*munai-'' &gt; ''*munei-'' &gt; Finnish ''muna'', ''muni-'' but southern Finnic ''munëi-'' &gt; Votic ''muna'', ''munõi-'', Võro ''muna'', ''munnõ-'', Estonian ''muna'', ''mune-'' (with õ &gt; e through loss of vowel harmony).
* Loss of glides before vowels:
** ''*ji'' &gt; ''*i''. This change followed the preceding one, as former ''*eji'' becomes ''*ei'' but does not end up as ''*i'': ''*peni'' "dog", plural stem ''*peneji-'' &gt; Finnish ''peni'', ''penei-'', Võro ''pini'', ''pin(n)e-''.
** ''*je'' &gt; ''*e'' word-initially.
** ''*vu'' &gt; ''*u''.
** ''*vü'' &gt; ''*ü''.
** ''*vo'' &gt; ''*o''. This change must date until after Proto-Finnic broke up, as Estonian and Võro ''võtma'' "to take" preserved the consonant until after the dialectal unrounding of ''*o'' to ''*õ'' (which prevented the change from affecting it). Compare Finnish ''ottaa'', Veps ''otta'', where it did apply as there was no unrounding in those dialects.

==Phonology==
The sounds of Proto-Finnic can be reconstructed through the [[comparative method]].

===Transcription===
Reconstructed Proto-Finnic is traditionally transcribed using the [[Uralic Phonetic Alphabet]]. The following UPA and related conventions are adopted in this article for transcribing Proto-Finnic forms:
* Front vowels are denoted with a diaeresis, as also in [[Estonian orthography]]: ''ä ö ü''.
* The affricate {{IPA|/t͡s/}} is written as ''c''.
* The sound {{IPA|/x/}} is written as ''h''.
* Long consonants and vowels are written doubled: ''aa ee ii pp tt kk cc'' etc.
* Half-long consonants are written with a following apostrophe: ''p' t' k' c'''.
* The labial semivowel {{IPA|/ʋ ~ w/}} is written as ''v''.
* Diphthongs are written with two vowel letters when a consonant follows: ''au ai'' (not ''av aj'').

===Consonants===
The Proto-Finnic consonant inventory had relatively few phonemic fricatives, much like that of the modern Finnic languages. [[Voice (phonetics)|Voicing]] was not phonemically contrastive, but the language did possess voiced allophones of certain voiceless consonants.

The table below lists the consonantal phonemes of Late Proto-Finnic.{{sfn|Laakso|2001}}{{sfn|Lehtinen|2007|p=137}} Phones written in parentheses represent [[allophone]]s and are not independent phonemes. When a consonant is notated in this article with a symbol distinct from the corresponding IPA symbol, the former is given first, followed by the latter.

* *h had evolved fairly late from the Middle Proto-Finnic [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] sibilant *š ({{IPA|[ʃ]}}). It may have been realised as {{IPA|[h]}} before another consonant.
* *v was perhaps realised as [[labiodental consonant|labiodental]] {{IPA|[ʋ]}} when a vowel followed, rather than a true [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]]
* {{IPA|[ŋ]}} was an allophone of *n before *k. The original Proto-Uralic phoneme *ŋ had been lost and changed into other sounds, except in this position.
* {{IPA|[b β]}}, {{IPA|[d ð]}} and {{IPA|[ɡ ɣ]}} were allophones of *p, *t and *k respectively, and developed as a result of consonant gradation.
* Final *-k was probably [[No audible release|unreleased]] {{IPA|[k̚]}}.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Proto-Finnic possessed two [[phonemic]] levels of [[consonant length|consonant duration]], short and long (geminate). The contrast itself had been inherited from Proto-Uralic, but was considerably expanded: all consonants except *r, *h, *j and *w could be short or long. The three plosives and the affricate ''*c'' also possessed a half-long duration ({{IPA|[pˑ]}}, {{IPA|[tˑ]}}, {{IPA|[kˑ]}} and {{IPA|[tsˑ]}}), but these were in complementary ([[allophonic]]) distribution with fully long consonants, and therefore were not phonemic. They appeared in predictable positions as a result of consonant gradation, like the voiced fricatives.

====Consonant gradation====
[[Consonant gradation]] was a process of [[lenition]] that affected the obstruents. Short plosives became voiced fricatives, while long plosives became half-long:

{| class="wikitable"
! Strong grade
! Weak grade
|-
| ''p''
| ''b'' ({{IPA|[β], [b]}})
|-
| ''t''
| ''d'' ({{IPA|[ð], [d]}})
|-

|-
| ''kk''
| ''k''' {{IPA|[kˑ]}}
|-
| ''cc'' {{IPA|[tt͡s]}}
| ''c''' {{IPA|[t͡sˑ]}}
|}

Voiced plosives occurred after nasals (''mb nd ŋg''), voiced fricatives in all other weak grade environments.

It is unclear if single ''*c'' gradated, and if so, into what. No Finnic language has consonant gradation for former ''*c'', both grades result in the same outcome (mostly ''s'').

Gradation occurred in two different environments, and can therefore be split into two types:
* '''Radical gradation''' affected consonants that appeared at the beginning of a closed syllable (a syllable that ended in a consonant). It affected consonants preceded by a vowel or sonorant, but not those preceded by another obstruent.
* '''Suffixal gradation''' affected consonants that appeared at the beginning of a non-initial odd-numbered syllable. It only affected consonants preceded by a vowel and did not affect the geminates{{clarify|reason=Did it affect *c?|date=March 2014}}.

It is unclear whether consonant gradation was a Finnic innovation, or a retention of an old Uralic feature that was lost in most other Uralic branches. It is likely that it was inherited from an earlier stage that was also the ancestor of the [[Sami languages]], which have gradation that is very similar to that found in the Finnic languages. However, it was still productive after certain sound changes specific to Finnic, such as the apocope of final ''*-i'', so it was probably present as a phonetic "post-processing" rule ([[Surface filter]]) over a long period of time. It is no longer fully productive in any Finnic language, but most languages still retain large amounts of words preserving the earlier alternations.

===Vowels===
The Proto-Finnic vowel inventory was very similar to that of modern Finnish, although the distribution of the sounds was different. The following table lists the [[monophthong]] vowels reconstructable for Proto-Finnic.{{sfn|Laakso|2001}}{{sfn|Lehtinen|2007|pp=138-139}}

All vowels could occur both short and [[vowel length|long]]. In Proto-Uralic, rounded vowels (''*u'', ''*ü'', ''*o'') could not occur in non-initial syllables, but because of sound changes, they did appear in Proto-Finnic.

The short unrounded mid back vowel ''*ë'' was not an independent vowel, but appeared as the counterpart of the front vowel ''*e'' in the system of harmony. It merged with ''*e'' in most Finnic languages, but not in South Estonian or Votic. See below under vowel harmony for more details.

The status of short ''*ö'' is unclear. It was not present in ancestral Proto-Uralic, and many instances of ''ö'' found in modern Finnic languages have only developed after Proto-Finnic, due to various sound changes. For example, Finnish has ''öy'' from ''*eü'': ''löytä-'' 'to find', ''köysi'' 'rope' &lt; Proto-Finnic ''*leütä-'', ''*keüci'', while Estonian has unrounded the diphthong instead, giving ''leida-'' and ''köis''. Short ''ö'' was also generally added to the system for reasons of symmetry{{dubious|reason=This wasn't a constructed language like Quenya, its speakers didn't convene and deliberate "What can we change in our speech so it can seem prettier?"|date=February 2015}}, to complete the system of vowel harmony (see below). This happened in Finnish ''näkö'' 'sight' &lt; Proto-Finnic ''*näko'', but not in Votic ''näko''.

The existence of long ''öö'' is clear, as this sound had regularly evolved from other combinations of sounds, in words of Uralic origin (e.g. ''*söö-'' 'to eat' ← Proto-Uralic ''*sewi-'').

====Diphthongs====
Proto-Finnic also possessed [[diphthong]]s, which were formed by combinations of a short vowel with the vowels {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/y/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, or equivalently with the semivowels {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}.

|}

No length contrast occurred in diphthongs. A long vowel followed by a close vowel as a suffix was shortened: e.g. the imperfect forms of ''*saa-'' "to receive", ''*söö-'' "to eat" were ''*sai'', ''*söi''. This process is the only reconstructible source of ''*öi'', ''*üi''.

====Vowel harmony====
Proto-Finnic possessed a system of [[vowel harmony]] very similar to the system found in modern Finnish. Vowels in non-initial syllables had either a front or a back vowel, depending on the quality of the vowel of the first syllable. If the first syllable contained a front vowel, non-initial syllables would contain such vowels as well, while back vowels in the first syllable would be matched with back vowels in the other syllables. Thus, all inflectional and derivational suffixes came in two forms, a front-harmonic and a back-harmonic variety.

In non-initial syllables, the vowels ''e'' and ''i'' were originally a single reduced schwa-like vowel in Proto-Uralic, but had become differentiated in height over time. ''i'' arose word-finally, while ''e'' appeared medially. These vowels were front vowels at the time, and had back-vowel counterparts ''ë'' and ''ï''. In Proto-Finnic, ''ï'' had merged into ''i'', so that ''i'' was now neutral to vowel harmony and could occur in both front-vowel and back-vowel words, even if it was phonetically a front vowel. The vowels ''e'' and ''ë'' appeared to have remained distinct in Proto-Finnic, and remained so in [[Estonian language|North]] and [[Võro language|South]] Estonian (as ''e'' and ''õ'') and Votic.&lt;ref&gt;Petri Kallio, ''The non-initial-syllable vowel reductions from Proto-Uralic to Proto-Finnic'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In the other Finnic languages, they merged as ''e''.

===Phonotactics===
Stress was not phonemic. Words were stressed in a [[trochaic]] pattern, with primary stress on the first syllable of a word, and secondary stress on every following odd-numbered syllable.

Root words included at least two [[mora (linguistics)|moras]], and generally followed the structure CVCV, CVCCV, CVVCV. Rarer root types included monosyllabic roots, CVV, with either a long vowel (e.g. ''*maa'' "land, earth"; ''*puu'' "tree, wood") or a diphthong (e.g. ''*täi'' "louse", ''*käü-däk'' "to walk"); roots with three syllables: CVCVCV (e.g. ''*petägä'' "pine"; ''*vasara'' "hammer") or CVCCVCV (e.g. ''*kattila'' "kettle"); and roots with a long vowel in a closed syllable: CVVCCV (e.g. ''*mëëkka'' "sword"). A syllable (and, hence, a word) could begin and end with at most one consonant. Any consonant phoneme could begin or end a syllable, but word-finally only the alveolar consonants (''*l'', ''*n'', ''*t'', ''*r'', ''*s'' and perhaps ''*c'') and the velars ''*k'' and ''*h'' could appear. Final ''*-k'' and ''*-h'' were often lost in the later Finnic languages, but occasionally left traces of their former presence.

Word-internal consonant clusters were limited to two elements originally. However, the widespread syncope of ''-e-'' (detailed above) could cause a cluster to come into contact with a third consonant. When such impermissible clusters appeared, this was generally solved by deleting one or more elements in the cluster, usually the first. Likewise, the apocope of ''-i'' after two or more syllables could create word-final clusters, which were also simplified. This led to alternations that are still seen, though unproductive, in e.g. Finnish:

* ''laps-i'' ("child", nominative) + ''-ta'' &gt; ''las-ta'' (partitive), with medial simplification ''*-pst-'' &gt; ''-st-''
* stem ''tuhant-'' ("thousand"):
** &gt; ''tuhat'' (nominative), with final simplification ''*-nt'' &gt; ''-t''
** &gt; ''tuhatta'' (partitive), with medial simplification ''*-ntt-'' &gt; ''-tt-''
* stem ''kolmant-'' ("third")
** &gt; ''kolmas'' (nominative), with final simplification (but note assibilation ''t'' &gt; ''s'', so this reflects earlier ''*-nci'' before apocope)
** &gt; ''kolmatta'' (partitive), with medial simplification ''*-ntt-'' &gt; ''-tt-'' (as assibilation shows that this had a stem-final vowel originally, this reflects earlier ''*-ntet-'' before syncope)
* root ''kansi'' : ''kante-'' ("lid") + causative ''-(t)ta-'' &gt; ''kattaa'' "to cover", with medial simplification ''*-ntt-'' &gt; ''-tt-

Note in the examples of ''tuhatta'' and ''kolmatta'' that Proto-Finnic did not initially tolerate clusters of a sonorant plus a geminate consonant (i.e. clusters like ''-ntt-''). Through loanwords and further syncope, these have only later become permissible in the Finnic languages.

Traditionally a single three-consonant cluster ''*-str-'' has been reconstructed for a small group of words showing ''*-tr-'' in Southern Finnic and in Eastern Finnish, ''*-sr-'' in Karelian and Veps, and {{IPA|/-hr-/}} in Western Finnish. This has recently been suggested to be reinterpreted as a two-consonant cluster ''*-cr-'' with an affricate as the initial member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Linguistic Map of Prehistoric Northern Europe|chapter=The Prehistoric Germanic Loanword Strata in Finnic|author-first=Petri|author-last=Kallio|year=2012|pp=225–238|series=Suomalais-Ugrilaisen Seuran Toimituksia|volume=266|url=http://www.sgr.fi/sust/sust266/sust266_kallio.pdf|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
All inflectional and derivational endings containing ''a'' or ''u'' also had front-vowel variants with ''ä'' and ''ü'', which matched the vowels in the word stem following the rules of vowel harmony. ''o'' did not follow this rule, as noted above.

Endings which closed the final syllable of a word triggered radical gradation on that syllable. An ending could also open a previously closed syllable, which would undo the gradation. Suffixal gradation affected the endings themselves. For example, partitive ''-ta'' would appear as ''-da'' when added to a two-syllable word ending in a vowel (e.g. *''kala'', *''kalada'' "fish"), but as ''-ta'' after a third syllable or a consonant (*''veci'', *''vettä'' "water").

===Nouns and adjectives===

====Cases====
Proto-Finnic nouns declined in at least 13 cases. Adjectives did not originally decline, but adjective-noun agreement was innovated in Proto-Finnic, probably by influence of the nearby [[Indo-European languages]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The plural of the nominative and accusative was marked with the ending ''-t'', while the plural of the other cases used ''-i-''. The genitive and accusative singular were originally distinct (genitive ''*-n'', accusative ''*-m''), but had fallen together when final ''*-m'' became ''*-n'' through regular sound change. Some pronouns had a different accusative ending, which distinguished them.

The following cases were present:{{sfn|Laakso|2001}}{{sfn|Lehtinen|2007|pp=124-125}}

The genitive plural was formed in two different ways:
* The "western" type was formed by adding the singular ending ''*-n'' to the nominative plural ''*-t'', with an additional fill vowel: ''*-t-en''. This then became ''*-den'' in most cases through consonant gradation.
* The "eastern" type was formed by adding the above suffix to the plural stem: ''*-i-den''.
Both types are still found in Finnish, although unevenly distributed. In the western type, the regular loss of ''-d-'' after an unstressed (even-numbered) syllable has created forms such as ''-ain'' (&lt; ''*-a-den''), which are now archaic, or dialectal.

====Adjective comparison====
Adjectives formed comparatives using the suffix ''*-mpa''.{{sfn|Laakso|2001}} This suffix survives in all Finnic languages, although in several the nominative has been replaced with ''-mpi'' for unclear reasons.

Only the northernmost Finnic languages have a distinct superlative suffix, like Finnish ''-in'' ~ ''-impa-''. The suffix was possibly originally a consonantal stem ''*-im(e)-'', which was modified to resemble the comparative more closely in Finnish. Its consonantal nature is apparent in an older, now-obsolete essive case form of the superlative in Finnish, which ended in ''-inna'' (&lt; ''*-im-na'' &lt; ''*-ime-na'' with syncope).

====Possessive suffixes====

Proto-Finnic had a series of [[possessive suffix]]es for nominals, which acted partly as genitives. These have been lost from productive use in all southern languages (traces remain in e.g. folk poetry). The system given below may therefore represent Proto-Northern Finnic rather than Proto-Finnic proper.

The original vowels in the plural possessor endings are not settled: evidence exists for both ''*A'' (that is, ''*a'' ~ ''*ä'') and ''*e''. {{harvcoltxt|Laakso|2001}} recognizes variation only for 1PP and 2PP (giving ''*A'' for 3PP). {{harvcoltxt|Hakulinen|1979}}, giving an Early Proto-Finnic paradigm, does not include vowel-final variants for 3PS.

Possessive suffixes were ordered after case endings, and typically attach to the oblique vowel stem: e.g. ''*sormi'' : ''*sorme-mi'' 'my finger'.

The number-of-possessed contrast is by the 20th century lost everywhere except in the Southeastern Tavastian dialect of Finnish, around the municipalities of [[Iitti]] and [[Orimattila]], and even there only in the nominative in the first and second person singular.{{sfn|Laanest|1982|p=183}} The original 3PS / 3PP contrast is lost everywhere except Ingrian. In most cases, both ending variants however still remain in use, with different endings generalized in different varieties. Standard Finnish adopts 1PP ''-mme'' (derived from the singular possessed series, with analogical ''mm'' based on the verbal inflection), but 1PS ''-ni'', 2PP ''-nne'' (derived from the plural possessed series, with regular ''*nd'' &gt; ''nn''); and adopts 3PS ''-nsA'' in the nominative, illative and instructive (nominative ''käte-nsä'' 'her/his hand'), but ''-Vn'' (&lt; ''*-hen'') in all other cases (e.g. inessive ''kädessä-än'' 'in her/his hand'). New plurality-of-possessed marking has emerged in the Soikkola dialect of Ingrian, suffixing the usual nominative plural marker ''-t'', e.g. ''venehe-mme-t'' 'our boats'. {{sfn|Laanest|1982|184}}

[[Old Finnish]] shows two archaic features in the possessive paradigm: the number-of-possessed contrast (singular ''poikaise-mi'' 'my son', versus plural ''luu-ni'' 'my bones'), and the 2nd person singular ending may attach also to the consonant stem of a nominal, with a non-assibilated ending ''-ti'' (the expected regular development before old ''*s'', ''*t'' and ''*h'' &lt; ''*š''): e.g. ''rakkaus'' : ''rakkaut-ti'' 'your love', ''tutkain'' : ''tutkain-ti'' 'your prod' (modern Finnish ''rakkaute-si'', ''tutkaime-si'').&lt;ref&gt;Rapola, Martti. 1933. ''Suomen kirjakielen historia'', pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A series of dual possessors has been proposed to account for the two different variants of 3PS, 1PP and 2PP endings; the variants ending in ''*-n'' would match with the dual possessor endings in [[Proto-Samic]].&lt;ref&gt;Itkonen, Erkki. 1955. [https://journal.fi/virittaja/article/view/33184 Onko itämerensuomessa jälkiä duaalista?] ''Virittäjä'' 59/2: 161–175.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis has not been generally accepted.

===Verbs===

====Finite forms====
Proto-Finnic inherited at least the following [[grammatical mood]]s:{{sfn|Laakso|2001}}

* [[Indicative mood]] - suffix: present none (but -k- in the passive), past -i-
* [[Imperative mood]] - suffix: -k(a)-
* [[Optative mood]] (possibly) - suffix: -ko-
* [[Conditional mood]] - suffix: -ksi- or -isi-
* [[Potential mood]] - suffix: -ne-

The indicative mood distinguished between present (which also functioned as future) and past tense, while the other moods had no tense distinctions. New "perfect" and "pluperfect" tenses had also been formed, probably by influence of the Indo-European languages. These were created using a form of the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] *''oldak'' "to be" and a participle.

There were six forms for each mood, for three persons and two numbers. In addition, there were two more forms. One was a form that is often called "passive" or "fourth person", and indicated an unspecified person. The second was the "connegative" form, which was used together with the negative verb to form negated sentences.

All moods except the imperative shared more or less the same endings:{{sfn|Laanest|1982|pp=228-233}}{{sfn|Laakso|2001}}{{sfn|Lehtinen|2007|pp=125-126}}

The first and second person plural endings show evidence (reflected in Savo and Southern Ostrobothnian Finnish and in Karelian) for an earlier present tense marker, assimilated with the following consonant. This is normally reconstructed as *-k- (*-km- &gt; *-mm-, *-kt- &gt; *-tt-), on the assumption of this ending being originally identical with *-k found in the connegative and in the imperative mood.

The variation between forms with *-ek and forms with *-a in the 1st and 2nd person plural reflects a former distinction between the dual and the plural (respectively), although this has not been attested from any Finnic variety. Estonian and Western Finnish continue *-ek, Votic and Eastern Finnic *-a(k).

The third person forms only had an ending in the present indicative. In all other tenses and moods, there was no ending and the singular and plural were identical. The 3rd person singular was entirely unmarked in South Estonian: the Late Proto-Finnic ending had evolved from the participle *-pa during the Middle Proto-Finnic stage, and this innovation had not reached South Estonian, which was already separated.

The imperative had its own set of endings:{{sfn|Laakso|2001}}

{| class="wikitable"
|

|-

| -ka-hen
|-

|-
! Connegative
| colspan="2" | -ga-k
|}

There is also some evidence of a distinct [[optative mood]], which is preserved in Finnish as ''-os'' (second-person singular). It is reconstructed as ''*-go-s'', consisting of the mood suffix ''*-ko-'' and the second-person singular ending ''*-s''. This mood suffix gave rise to alternative imperative forms in some languages, such as Finnish third-person singular ''-koon'' &lt; ''*-ko-hen'' (the plural ''-koot'' has ''-t'' by analogy) and passive ''-ttakoon'' &lt; ''*-tta-ko-hen''.

====Non-finite forms====
In addition, there were also several non-finite forms.{{sfn|Lehtinen|2007|pp=134-135}}

====Negative verb====
Proto-Finnic, like its descendants, expressed negation using a special negative verb. This verb was defective and inflected only in the indicative ("does not", "did not") and the imperative ("do not") moods. The main verb was placed in its special connegative form, and expressed the main mood. The negative verb was also [[Suppletion|suppletive]], having the stem ''*e-'' in the indicative and variously ''*äl-'', ''*al-'', ''*är-'' in the imperative. This has been partially levelled in Votic and most of Eastern Finnic, which show an imperative stem ''*el-''.

|}

Past tense inflection was based on the stem *es-. This is retained as a separate category only in South Estonian and Livonian, but lost in all other Finnic languages. replaced by a construction of present tense of the negative verb, plus past active participle. The distinctive [[Kodavere]] dialect of Estonian, however, adopts this and not the present stem as the basic negative verb stem: ''esin'' "I don't", ''esid'' "you (sg.) don't", ''es'' "s/he doesn't" etc.{{sfn|Laanest|1982|p=243}}

Originally, the negative verb may have had participles and other moods as well. However, no clear traces of moods other than the indicative are found in any Finnic language.  A remnant of what may be either a present active participle or an archaic third-person singular present form survives in the prefix ''*epä-'' "un-, not" (Finnish ''epä-'', Estonian ''eba-''), while a remnant of a 2nd infinitive instructive may survive in dialectal Finnish ''eten-'' "without doing".{{sfn|Hakulinen|1979|p=254}}

Negation of non-finite constructions was expressed using the abessive case of the infinitives or participles.

==Later developments==
The following is an overview of the more important changes that happened after the Proto-Finnic period.

===Development of consonant clusters===
These changes happened very late in the Proto-Finnic period, but as South Estonian developed somewhat differently, it shows that dialectal diversification was beginning to occur around this time.

In South Estonian, ''*p'' and ''*k'' assimilate to a following dental obstruent, while ''*t'' assimilates to ''*k'', and ''*čk'' remains distinct from ''*tk''.

{| class="wikitable"
! (Pre)-Finnic
! South Estonian (Võro)
! Other Finnic (North Estonian, Finnish)
|-
| ''*čk'' (''*kačku'' "plague")
| ''*tsk'' (''katsk'')
| ''*tk'' (''katk'', ''katku'')
|-
| ''*tk'' (''*itku'' "cry")
| ''*kk'' (''ikk'')
| ''*tk'' (''itk'', ''itku'')
|-
| ''*kt'' (''*koktu'' "womb")
| ''*tt'' (''kõtt'')
| stressed ''*ht'' (''kõht'', ''kohtu'')&lt;br/&gt;unstressed ''*tt''
|-
| ''*pt''
| ''*tt''
| stressed ''*ht''&lt;br/&gt;unstressed ''*tt''
|-
| ''*kc'' (''*ükci'' "one")
| ''*ts'' (''üts''')
| ''*ks'' (''üks'', ''yksi'')
|-
| ''*pc'' (''*lapci'' "child")
| ''*ts'' (''lats''')
| ''*ps'' (''laps'', ''lapsi'')
|-
| ''*ks'' (''maksa'' "liver")
| ''*ss'' (''mass'')
| ''*ks'' (''maks'', ''maksa'')
|-
| ''*ps''
| ''*ss''
| ''*ps''
|}

In all Finnic dialects, original ''*pt'' and ''*kt'' have the same reflex. It is therefore impossible to distinguish them in reconstruction, unless there is additional internal evidence (in the form of grammatical alternations) or external evidence (from non-Finnic languages).

===Developments to the affricates ''*c'' and ''*cc''===
The non-geminated ''*c'' becomes ''*s'' generally: Proto-Finnic ''*veci'' "water", ''*cika'' "pig", ''*-inen'' : ''*-ice-'' (adjective suffix) &gt; Finnish ''vesi'', ''sika'', ''-(i)nen'' : ''-(i)se-''. However, occasionally ''ts'' or ''ds'' remains in South Estonian: Võro ''tsiga'', ''-ne'' : ''-dse-'' or ''-se-'' (but ''vesi''). The merging of ''*c'' and ''*s'' often makes it impossible to distinguish the two sounds using Finnic evidence alone, if [[internal reconstruction]] is not viable (e.&amp;nbsp;g., from ''t'' ~ ''s'' alternations from assibilation).

The geminate affricate ''*cc'' generally remains, often spelled {{angbr|ts}}. In Karelian, Ingrian, Votic and some Finnish dialects, the two grades remain distinguished (in Karelian as {{angbr|čč}} : {{angbr|č}}, in Ingrian and Votic as {{angbr|tts}} ~ {{angbr|ts}}). In all other Finnic languages the two grades fall together (written in Veps as {{angbr|c}}, as {{angbr|ts}} in the others).

In early Finnish, both grades were fronted to interdental ''θθ'' : ''θ'', which in most dialects later changed into a variety of other dialect-specific sounds. Examples found are gradation patterns ''tt'' : ''t'', ''ht'' : ''h'', ''ht'' : ''t'', ''ss'' : ''s'' or non-gradating ''tt'' or ''ht''. In early written Finnish, the interdental fricatives are written as {{angbr|tz}} (for both grades) in the earliest records, which in Standard Finnish has led to the [[spelling pronunciation]] {{IPA|/ts/}} (treated as a consonant cluster and hence no longer subject to consonant gradation).

===The vowel ''õ''===
In the southern Finnic languages, a new back unrounded mid vowel {{IPA|[ɤ]}} develops from ''*e'' in words with back vowel harmony. For example Proto-Finnic ''*velka'' "debt" &gt; Estonian ''võlg'', Võro ''võlg'', but &gt; Finnish ''velka''. South Estonian and Votic show this development in all syllables, so that ''e'' and ''õ'' become a front and back vowel harmony pair. This may have also occurred in the earlier history of north (Standard) Estonian, but vowel harmony was later abandoned, undoing the change if it did occur.

In South Estonian, ''õ'' is in front of a nasal then raised to a central unrounded vowel {{IPA|[ɨ]}} (represented orthographically as {{angbr|y}}), parallel to the development of the other mid vowels. E.g. Võro ''ynn''', Estonian ''õnn'' "luck"; Võro ''ryngas'', Estonian ''rõngas'' "ring".

In Estonian and Votic, more rarely Livonian, instances of ''õ'' also develop by unrounding of earlier short ''*o''. The detailed history of this change is unclear and shows much variation even between individual dialects of (North) Estonian.{{sfn|Setälä|1937|pp=450–451}} The development of ''*o'' to ''õ'' is the most general in Votic (if recent loanwords from Ingrian, Finnish and Russian are discounted){{sfn|Setälä|1937|p=449}} and in the Kodavere dialect of Estonian.{{sfn|Raun|1971|pp=61–63}} Three main groups can thus be distinguished:{{sfn|Viitso|2000|p=164–165}}

A particularly interesting example is "to take", which suggests that at least some instances of this change preceded the general Finnic loss of word-initial ''*v-'' before rounded vowels, which affected Finnish and rest of Northern Finnic (which kept a rounded vowel) but not Estonian and the rest of Southern Finnic (which unrounded the vowel). It therefore must have occurred very early, in dialectal Proto-Finnic times.

In a small number of words, Estonian and Votic ''õ'' can be additionally found in correspondence to North Finnic ''a'' or ''u''. Livonian and South Estonian might align with either side, depending on the word. E.g. {{sfn|Raun|1971|pp=64-65}}
* "all": Estonian ''kõik'', Votic ''kõittši'', Võro ''kyik'' — Finnish and Karelian ''kaikki'', Veps ''kaik''
* "thread": Estonian ''lõng'', Votic ''lõnka'' — Finnish and Karelian ''lanka'', Veps and South Estonian ''lang'', Livonian ''lānga''
* "or": Estonian and Livonian ''või'' — Finnish, Karelian, Veps and Võro ''vai'' (Votic ''vai'', possibly from Ingrian)
* "word": Estonian and Votic ''sõna'', Livonian ''sõnā'', Võro ''syna'' — Finnish, Karelian and Veps ''sana''
* Estonian and Võro ''mõistma'', Votic ''mõissaa'' "to understand" — Finnish and Karelian ''muistaa'', Veps ''muštta'' "to remember"
* "heath": Estonian ''nõmm'', Votic ''nõmmi'' — Finnish ''nummi''

===Vowel reduction and loss===
Short final vowels are lost after long syllables (two consonants or a syllable with a long vowel or diphthong) in Veps, partly Ludian, both North and South Estonian, and most Southwestern dialects of Finnish. For example, Proto-Finnic ''*kakci'' "two", ''*neljä'' "four", ''*viici'' "five" &gt; Estonian ''kaks'', ''neli'', ''viis'', Veps ''kaks''', ''nel&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;l&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', ''viž'', Võro ''katś'', ''nelli'', ''viiś'', but &gt; standard Finnish ''kaksi'', ''neljä'', ''viisi''. This change occurred before the loss of final consonants (if any), as vowels that were originally followed by a consonant were not lost. The loss of final ''*-i'' leaves phonemic palatalization of the preceding consonant in many languages, on which see below.

[[Colloquial Finnish]] loses word-final ''i'' under more limited conditions, in particular after ''s'' (e.g. ''kaks'' "two", ''viis'' "5"; inflectional endings such as ''aamuks''  "for/to the morning" (translative), ''talos'' "your house" (2nd person singular possessive), ''tulis'' "would come" (3rd person singular conditional)) as well as word-final ''a/ä'' from several inflectional endings (e.g. inessive ''-s(s)'', elative ''-st'', adessive ''-l(l)'', ablative ''-lt'').

In Livonian, all short final vowels except ''*a'' and ''*ä'' are lost, thus giving ''*kakci'' &gt; ''kakš'' as in Estonian, but also ''*veci'' "water" &gt; ''ve'ž'', while no vowel was lost in ''*neljä'' &gt; ''nēļa'', ''*kala'' "fish" &gt; ''kalā''.

Unstressed ''*o'' merges into ''*u'' in Northern Estonian.

Vowel harmony is lost in Estonian, Livonian and partly Veps, but not South Estonian or Votic. For example, Proto-Finnic ''*külä'' "village" &gt; Estonian ''küla'', but &gt; Finnish ''kylä'', Veps ''külä'', Votic ''tšülä'', Võro ''külä''. In Finnish and Karelian, vowel harmony was retained and extended to ''*o'' as well, creating a new vowel ''*ö'' in words with front vowel harmony.

Many languages in the Southern Finnic group, as well as again Veps and Southwestern Finnish, show loss of unstressed vowels in medial syllables. In these languages, vowel length is lost before ''h'' early on, while diphthongs are simplified into short vowels.

===Palatalization===
Palatalized consonants are reintroduced into most varieties other than Western Finnish. The most widespread source is regressive palatalization due to a lost word-final or word-medial ''*-i'' (a form of [[cheshirization]]), and consonant clusters with ''*j'' as a second member. In several varieties, there is also progressive palatalization, where a diphthong ending in ''*-i'' and the long vowel ''*ii'' causes palatalization of a following consonant.

* In Livonian, the palatalized ''*ś'' and ''*ź'' that arose from loss of ''*-i'' generally shift to postalveolar ''š'' and ''ž''.
* In Votic, ''*k'' and ''*g'' are palatalized to ''tš'' and ''j'' before all front vowels.
* Veps undergoes both regressive and progressive palatalization, but with different outcomes:
*# Progressive palatalization of post-Proto-Finnic ''*s'' yields postalveolar ''š'' or ''ž''. For example, Proto-Finnic ''*viici'' "five" &gt; ''*viisi'' &gt; Veps ''viž''.
*# Regressive palatalization of post-Proto-Finnic ''*s'' yields alveolo-palatal ''ś'' or ''ź''. For example, Proto-Finnic ''*kuuci'' "six" &gt; ''*kuusi'' &gt; Veps ''kuź''.
* In Northern Karelian, a general shift ''*s'' &gt; ''š'' occurs, except blocked in progressive palatalization contexts.

Estonian, Votic and Finnish do not have general palatalization, and ''š'' occurs almost solely in loanwords, most commonly of Russian or German origin.

===Loss of final consonants===
Final ''*-k'' was generally lost. It is preserved in some dialects:
* In Eastern Votic as ''-g''
* In Võro as ''-q'' (a glottal stop {{IPA|/ʔ/}})

Final ''*-h'' is widely lost as well. It is preserved:
* In Karelian and Veps as ''-h''.
* In Southern Estonian as either ''-h'' or as a glottal stop ''-q''.

Traces of both ''*-k'' and ''*-h'' remain in Finnish, where the consonants became a [[sandhi]] effect, assimilating to the initial consonant of the following word and lengthening it. This effect does not occur in all dialects and is not represented orthographically, but is often noted with a superscript "ˣ" in reference works. In Western dialects there was also metathesis of ''*h'', which preserved the original ''*h'' along with sandhi lengthening, e.g. Proto-Finnic ''*mureh'' "sorrow" &gt; Western Finnish ''murheˣ'' (Karelian ''mureh'', Võro ''murõh''/''murõq'') and Proto-Finnic ''*veneh'' "boat" &gt; Western Finnish ''venheˣ'' (Karelian/Veps ''veneh'', Võro ''vineh''/''vineq'').
Standard Finnish inconsistently adopts some words in their Western Finnish shape (e.g. ''murhe''; ''perhe'' "family", ''valheellinen'' "untrue"), some in their Eastern Finnish shape (e.g. ''vene''; ''vale'' "lie").

Final ''*-n'' is lost in most of the South Finnic area (as well as widely in modern-day colloquial Finnish). In Votic this triggers [[compensatory lengthening]] of the preceding vowel. The 1st person verbal ending resists the change, and generally remains as ''-n''.

Loss of final consonants followed the loss of final vowels. Thus, vowels followed by a lost consonant were preserved.

===Loss of voiced obstruents===
The voiced obstruents ''*b/β'', ''*d/δ'' and ''*g/γ'' that occurred as the weak grades of single plosives were often lost or modified in various ways. The simplest outcomes are in the marginal languages Livonian and Veps, where all three are reflected as plain voiced stops ''b'', ''d'' and ''g'' respectively regardless of environment. The remaining languages show more complex developments.

''*b/β'' develops relatively uniformly:
* The fricative ''*β'' merges with ''*v''.
* The nasal-plosive cluster ''*mb'' assimilates to ''mm'', except in Olonets Karelian (Livvi) and Ludic.

The development of ''*d/δ'' is more diverse:
* The clusters ''*lδ'' and ''*rδ'' are widely assimilated to geminated ''*ll'' and ''*rr'', creating the characteristic gradation patterns ''lt'' ~ ''ll'' and ''rt'' ~ ''rr''.
* In other positions, ''*δ'' is lost early on in the other languages of the Eastern Finnic group (Eastern Finnish, Karelian, Ludic and Ingrian) as well as in Estonian.
* In Western Finnish, ''*δ'' is lost after an unstressed syllable, but remains after a stressed syllable. It remained initially as {{IPA|/ð/}}, but shifted to {{IPA|/ɾ/}} or {{IPA|/r/}} in Ostrobothnian and to {{IPA|/l/}} in Tavastian. In Standard Finnish, the sound was written {{angbr|d}} or {{angbr|dh}} early on, and pronunciation has now become {{IPA|/d/}} through spelling pronunciation. Individual words may follow particular dialects instead, e.g. zero in ''*naudetta'' &gt; ''navetta'' "cowshed", ''l'' in ''*tadikkoi'' &gt; ''talikko'' "manure fork".
* The nasal-plosive cluster ''*nd'' assimilates to ''nn'', except in Olonets Karelian and Ludic.

''*g/γ'' develops somewhat similar to ''*d/δ'', but with several conditional outcomes:
* In Votic, ''*γ'' is fortified to {{IPA|/ɡ/}} when not palatalized (see above).
* In Karelian, the clusters ''*lγ'' and ''*rγ'' become geminated ''*ll'' and ''*rr'', like the clusters ''*lδ'' and ''*rδ''.
* In Western Finnish, ''*lγ'' and ''*rγ'' become ''*lj'' and ''*rj'' when followed by an unrounded front vowel (''*i'', ''*e'', and often ''*ä''), although there is wide variation and there are exceptions for each vowel. There are also many words in which the cluster ''*hk'' develops into ''*hγ'' analogically, which then likewise develops into ''*hj'', although again with numerous exceptions.
* Between two labial vowels, ''*γ'' becomes ''*v'' in Western Finnish.
* In all remaining languages and positions, ''*γ'' is lost.
* The nasal-plosive cluster ''*ŋg'' is assimilated to the corresponding geminate ''ng'' {{IPA|/ŋː/}} in several of the Finnish dialects. However, given the lack of a pre-existing ''*ŋ'', the cluster widely "un-gradates" back to ''*ŋk''.

The loss of consonants often created new long vowels and diphthongs, particularly in non-initial syllables. Compare for example:
* Finnish ''auttaa'' "to help" &lt; Proto-Finnic ''*abuttadak'' with the unmodified strong grade in ''apu'' "help, assistance".
* North and South Estonian ''susi'' "wolf", genitive ''soe'' &lt; Proto-Finnic ''*suci'', ''*suδen''.

===Lenition===
In all Finnic languages except Finnish, Northern Karelian and Votic, the voiceless (strong grade) obstruent consonants ''*p'', ''*t'', ''*k'' and ''*s'', are lenited to voiced or lax voiceless obstruents ''b'', ''d'', ''g'', ''z'' when occurring between voiced sounds. In Veps and Livonian, these new voiced plosives merge with their weak grade counterparts. In Estonian ''s'' remains voiceless and ''b'', ''d'', ''g'' are not fully voiced, instead remaining as lax voiceless consonants {{IPA|[b̥]}}, {{IPA|[d̥]}}, {{IPA|[ɡ̊]}}.

===Raising or diphthongization of long vowels===
In many Finnic languages, long vowels develop into opening diphthongs by raising the onset, or show general raising instead.{{sfn|Viitso|1998|p=108}}

The long mid vowels ''*oo'', ''*öö'' and ''*ee'' become opening diphthongs {{IPA|/uo̯/}}, {{IPA|/yø̯/}}, {{IPA|/ie̯/}} in Finnish, Karelian, and several marginal dialects of Northern Estonian. In Western Finnish dialects their second component widely becomes more open, producing {{IPA|/uɔ̯/}}, {{IPA|/yœ̯/}}, {{IPA|/iɛ̯/}} or even {{IPA|/uɑ̯/}}, {{IPA|/yæ̯/}} and either {{IPA|/iæ̯/}} or {{IPA|/iɑ̯/}} depending on vowel harmony. Diphthongization also occurs in Livonian, but only under certain conditions, and the mid back unrounded long vowel ''õõ'' is not affected. In Livonian, the short vowels ''*o'' and ''*e'' may also diphthongize, leading to a contrast of short ''uo'', ''ie'' {{IPA|/wo/}}, {{IPA|/je/}} with long ''ūo'', ''īe'' {{IPA|/uːo̯/}}, {{IPA|/iːe̯/}}.

In South Estonian, raising only occurs in overlong syllables, and results in long close vowels ''uu'', ''üü'' and ''ii''.

In Eastern Finnish and Karelian, the low vowels ''*aa'' and ''*ää'' also diphthongize, becoming Karelian ''oa'', ''eä'', [[Savonian dialects|Savonian]] ''ua'', ''iä''. In standard Livonian, long ''*aa'' of any origin is at a late date generally raised to ''ǭ'' {{IPA|/ɔː/}}.

===Diphthong assimilation===
{{sfn|Viitso|1998|p=108}}
The diphthong ''*eü'' is fully labialized to ''öü'' in Northern Finnic and South Estonian. In northern dialects of Veps, new long close vowels are created by the raising of several diphthongs:
* ''*ei'', ''*öi'' &gt; ''ii''.
* ''*iu'', ''*iü'', ''*eu'', ''*öü'' &gt; ''üü'' ~ ''üu''.
* ''*au'', ''*ou'' &gt; ''uu''.

North Estonian instead unrounds all diphthongs ending in ''-ü'' to ''-i'':
* ''*eü'' &gt; ''ei''
* ''*äü'' &gt; ''äi''

In Savonian Finnish, the 2nd element of all diphthongs is lowered:
* ''*au'', ''*äü'' &gt; ''ao'', ''äö'' or further &gt; ''aa'', ''ää''
* ''*ai'', ''*äi'' &gt; ''ae'', ''äe''
* ''*oi'', ''*öi'' &gt; ''oe'', ''öe''

In Livonian, ''*au'' is labialized to ''ou'', and ''*äi'' is palatalized to ''ei''. Following this, the mid diphthongs are smoothed to long vowels under certain conditions:
* ''ou'' &gt; ''oo''
* ''õi'', ''õu'' &gt; ''õõ''
* ''ei'' &gt; ''ee''

===Coda vocalization===
A variety of languages shows a change of a syllable-final consonant into a vowel. This is not one single change, but several independent developments.

In the Southern Finnic group, ''*n'' is lost before ''*s'' (&lt; Proto-Finnic ''*s'' or ''*c''), with compensatory lengthening of the perceding vowel. For example Proto-Finnic ''*kanci'' "lid", ''*pensas'' "bush" &gt; Estonian ''kaas'', ''põõsas'', but &gt; Finnish ''kansi'', ''pensas''.

In Western Finnish, stop consonants before a sonorant are vocalized to ''u''. E.g. ''*kapris'' "goat", ''*atra'' "plough", ''*kakra'' "oats" &gt; Finnish ''kauris'', ''aura'', ''kaura'', but &gt; Estonian ''kaber'', ''ader'', ''kaer'', Karelian ''kapris'', ''atra'', ''kakra''. Standard Finnish mostly follows the Western Finnish model. Some notable exceptions include ''[[wiktionary:kekri|kekri]]'' "All Saints' Eve feast", ''[[wiktionary:kupla|kupla]]'' "bubble".&lt;!--not the same word as _kuula_ 'sphere, ball', which is from Swedish _kugel_--&gt;

Syllable-final ''*l'' is vocalized in Veps at a late date, creating ''u''-final diphthongs in the northern and central dialects, long vowels in the southern.

'''''Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies''''' is a book by Alan Kane describing [[scrambling]] routes of [[mountain]]s in the [[Canadian Rockies]].

It is published by Rocky Mountain Books, located in [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]], [[Alberta]]. The third edition {{ISBN|9781771600972}}, released in May 2016, has been updated and contains route descriptions for 175 peaks. The peaks are rated from easy to difficult and information on trail heads and the standard routes are covered. ''[[Backpacker (magazine)|Backpacker]]'' magazine has twice featured the book as an expedition guide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VeIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=%22Scrambles+in+the+Canadian+Rockies#PPA25,M1 ''Backpacker Magazine'' Aug 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yOQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=%22Scrambles+in+the+Canadian+Rockies&amp;lr=#PPA63,M1 ''Backpacker Magazine'' Aug 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Canadian Alpine Journal]]'' referred to it as a "scree gospel".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NEl6AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Scrambles+in+the+Canadian+Rockies&amp;dq=%22Scrambles+in+the+Canadian+Rockies&amp;lr=&amp;pgis=1 ''Canadian Alpine Journal'']&lt;/ref&gt; The book is solely responsible for creating a widespread interest in scrambling up mountain peaks, whether the peaks are in USA or Western Canada. Since first published in 1991, many similar guidebooks by other authors have followed this one.

== Format ==
Thangyat performances are comparable to [[slam poetry]], as performers use numerous poetic and narrative formulae, and employ traditional theatrical devices, such as shifting voices and tones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A common format involves a call and answer segment between a lead performer called ''ataing'' (အတိုင်) and the chorus of followers called ''ahpauk'' (အဖောက်).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thangyat performances are enjoyed for their wit and use of wordplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/special-features/178-thingyan-2014/10047-warriors-of-wit.html|title=Warriors of wit|work=The Myanmar Times|access-date=2017-08-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Discuss before changing this to an infobox. TDA is a painting with a lot of intricate detail and looks like an incomprehensible smear at infobox default size --&gt;[[File:The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate, William Etty, 1832.jpg|right|upright=1.8|thumb|''The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate''|alt=Painting of an angel hovering over a crowd of angels and humans]]
'''''The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate'''''&lt;!--

 The painting has three titles, of which the first two are both in common use:
 * "...Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate" is the title it is labelled with in the Manchester Art Gallery and also the name it's catalogued under at BBC Your Paintings, so is the name readers are most likely to know it by.

--&gt;, also known as '''''The Destroying Angel and Daemons Inflicting Divine Vengeance on the Wicked and Intemperate'''''{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=24}} and as '''''The Destruction of the Temple of Vice''''',{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=185}} is an [[oil painting]] on canvas by English artist [[William Etty]], first exhibited in 1832. Etty had become famous for [[Nude (art)|nude paintings]], and acquired a reputation for tastelessness, indecency and a lack of creativity. With ''The Destroying Angel'' he hoped to disprove his critics with an openly moral piece. The painting is 127.8&amp;nbsp;cm by 101.9&amp;nbsp;cm (50&amp;nbsp;in by 40&amp;nbsp;in) and depicts a classical temple under attack from a [[destroying angel (Bible)|destroying angel]] and a group of [[Daemon (classical mythology)|daemons]]. Some of the humans appear dead or unconscious, others flee or struggle against the daemons.

When first exhibited in 1832, ''The Destroying Angel'' was widely praised for its technical brilliance, but critics were divided on the subject matter. Some praised its vivid blend of fear and beauty; others criticised its theme as inappropriate, and chastised Etty for wasting his talent. As Etty had hoped, the painting changed critics' perception of him; some saw it as indicating previously unseen depths, others considered it a renunciation of his previous work. Henry Payne, who had commissioned the painting, sold it in 1854 to [[Joseph Whitworth|Sir Joseph Whitworth]]. Whitworth donated it in 1882 to the [[Manchester Art Gallery]], where it remains.

==Background==
[[File:Etty Youth 1832.jpg|right|upright=.9|thumb|''Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm'' was described by ''The Morning Chronicle'' as "an indulgence of what we once hoped a classical, but which are now convinced, is a lascivious mind".{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=33}}|alt=Painting of naked people on a boat]]
[[William Etty]] (1787–1849), the seventh son of a [[York]] baker and miller,&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=8925|title=William Etty}}&lt;/ref&gt; had originally been an apprentice printer in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]],{{sfn|Gilchrist|1855|p=23}} but on completing his seven-year apprenticeship at the age of 18 moved to [[London]] to become an artist.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; Strongly influenced by the works of [[Titian]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], he became famous for painting [[Nude (art)|&lt;!-- Normally this would be overlinking, but in this context readers are likely to want to learn more about the tradition of nude art --&gt;nude figures]] in biblical, literary and mythological settings.&lt;ref name="MAG Etty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/salvaged/the-painting/about-the-artist/index.html |title=About the artist |publisher=Manchester Art Gallery |accessdate=10 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211024806/http://www.manchestergalleries.org/salvaged/the-painting/about-the-artist/index.html |archivedate=11 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his peers greatly admired him, and he was elected a full [[Royal Academy of Arts#Membership|Royal Academician]] in 1828, ahead of [[John Constable]].{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=118}}

Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nudes.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=32}} While some nude paintings by foreign artists existed in private collections, England had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 [[Society for the Suppression of Vice|Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice]].{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=53}} Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and the reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=55}} Although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received,{{efn-ua|Etty's male nude portraits were primarily of mythological heroes and classical combat, genres in which the depiction of male nudity was considered acceptable in England.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|pp=32–33}}}} many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent.&lt;ref name="MAG Etty" /&gt;{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=32}} Etty's ''[[Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm]]'', completed in 1830 and exhibited in 1832, attracted scathing criticism for its supposed seductive and sensual nature, leading ''[[The Morning Chronicle]]'' to comment that "[Etty] should not persist, with an unhallowed fancy, to pursue Nature to her holy recesses. He is a laborious draughtsman, and a beautiful colourist; but he has not taste or chastity of mind enough to venture on the naked truth."{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=33}}

Needled by repeated attacks from ''The Morning Chronicle'' on his supposed indecency, poor taste and lack of creativity, Etty determined to produce a work that would prove his detractors wrong.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=36}} The result was ''The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate''.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=37}}

''The Destroying Angel'' was commissioned by Henry Payne&lt;!-- Don't wikilink this unless and until we have an article on him, it goes to a disambiguation page on which the Payne in question doesn't appear --&gt; of Leicester in 1822, on a promise of 60&amp;nbsp;[[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|63|1822|r=-2}}|0}} in today's terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) when complete.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=185}} Payne had granted Etty complete freedom in the creation of the piece,{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=37}} but Etty had done little with the notion until, stung by ''The Morning Chronicle'''s criticism, he decided to return to the theme, completing it in 1832.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=37}} As Etty had become a more prominent painter in the meantime, Payne paid him £130 (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|130|1832|r=-3}}|0}} in today's terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) for the piece.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=185}}{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=23}} The work is thought to have been inspired by the works of [[John Milton]] and [[Alexander Pope]], by [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' and possibly by the [[July Revolution|French Revolution of 1830]],{{sfn|Burnage|2011a|p=167}}{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=39}} in which Etty had been caught up during a visit to Paris to study in the [[Louvre]].{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=24}} The topic was one to which Etty felt particularly close, saying that he had put his "whole soul" into the piece.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=40}}

==Composition==
[[File:The Destroying Angel... (Angel).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The angel is wreathed in smoke, and is poised to throw a thunderbolt.|alt=Angel holding a spear and surrounded by smoke]]
''The Destroying Angel'' is a [[visionary art|visionary work]], depicting a wholly imaginary scene rather than a scene from history, literature or mythology.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=186}}{{efn-ua|name=vision|The catalogue for the 1832 Summer Exhibition described ''The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate'' as "a finished sketch of that class of compositions called by the Romans ''Visions'', not having their origin in history or poetry."&lt;ref name="Times1832"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Royal Academy |day_of_week=Thursday |date=24 May 1832 |page_number=3 |issue=14860 |column=F }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It measures 127.8&amp;nbsp;cm by 101.9&amp;nbsp;cm (50&amp;nbsp;in by 40&amp;nbsp;in), and depicts an ornate imaginary [[Classical architecture|classical temple]].{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=37}}  The temple and its occupants are under attack from a [[destroying angel (Bible)|destroying angel]] and a group of [[Daemon (classical mythology)|daemons]], who are in the process of abducting its human occupants.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=131}} The angel itself is wreathed in smoke in the centre of the image. Having destroyed one side of the temple, it is poised to hurl a [[thunderbolt]].{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=38}} Below the angel, daemons attack a group of around 25 semi-naked human figures. Each human is shown in a different position and expresses terror differently,{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=37}} and each is deliberately painted in paler tones than those Etty typically used to suggest death and pallor.{{sfn|Burnage|2011c|p=220}} As with most of Etty's works, the figures are a collection of depictions of models in studio poses, later arranged for dramatic effect, rather than painted as a group.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=186}}

To the right of the painting, daemons drag terrified women away. The woman in the lower right-hand corner turns to see flames reflected in the eyes of the daemon who holds her from behind, with a look of horrified guilt on her face.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=38}} Behind her, other women struggle helplessly with the daemons or are carried away unconscious, having fainted.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=38}}

In the centre of the foreground is a figure modelled on [[Caius Gabriel Cibber]]'s ''Raving Madness'', which at the time was one of two [[monumental sculpture]]s above the entrance to [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bethlem Hospital]] ("Bedlam"), and a well-known London landmark and symbol of insanity.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=131}}{{efn-ua|''Raving Madness'' and its companion ''Melancholy Madness'' remain in the care of Bethlem Hospital, and currently, flank the grand staircase of the Bethlem Museum of the Mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museumofthemind.org.uk/about|title=About Us|year=2015|publisher=Bethlem Museum of the Mind|accessdate=6 April 2015|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The chained figure is contorted in agony struggling to escape his bonds, while a daemon pulls on one end of the chain.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=38}} Beside this lunatic is an unconscious or dead gambler, his winnings spread on the floor beside him.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=38}}

}}
Behind the central images of the lunatic, daemon and gambler are a group of people who have only just realised what is happening. A male figure in a red [[Phrygian cap]] (a symbol of the French and American Revolutions) reclines with his arm around the waist of a female figure (identified as a [[maenad|bacchante]] by Sarah Burnage of the University of York).{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=38}} The female figure shades her eyes, either against the brightness of the angel or to block out the horror taking place in front of her.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=38}}

On the left-hand side of the painting, in the background, the structure of the temple crumbles and burns in the wake of the angel's path, while figures in varying stages of undress flee the approaching daemons. In the foreground a drunken man mimics the pose of the [[Barberini Faun]] as he clutches his head,{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=131}} alert enough to realise his fate if he does not escape but too intoxicated to flee.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=38}}

Around the painting lie corpses in various states of undress. ''The Destroying Angel'' was painted shortly after Etty's visit to Paris in which he had witnessed the [[July Revolution]] at first hand, and the sight and smell of the dead in the streets had left a strong impression on him. The heaped bodies in ''The Destroying Angel'' were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France,{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=39}} and perhaps also by the [[Second cholera pandemic (1829–51)|cholera epidemic]] which killed thousands in London in 1832.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=39}}

==Reception==
''The Destroying Angel'' was first exhibited at the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] in 1832.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=37}} It immediately generated much critical and public interest, and was compared favourably with ''[[The Fall of the Damned]]'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]''&lt;!-- I know this is wikilinked twice, but I think it makes sense to link it here as readers are likely to want to see what it was being compared to --&gt; and "Breughell's frightful fancies".{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=39}}{{Ref supports2|&lt;ref name="Examiner"&gt;{{cite journal|date=10 June 1832|title=Fine Arts|journal=The Examiner|publisher=John Hunt|location=London|issue=1271|page=373}}&lt;/ref&gt;|"Breughell's frightful fancies"}}

{{Quote box|width=27em|align=right|salign=right|quote=We wish especially, that one of Mr. Etty's high and deserved estimation would give the world only what shall tend to improve the public taste in morals as well as in art&amp;nbsp;... and when we remember his 'Guardian Angels' and other works of that class, we are at no loss to quote an authority, when we have his own against himself; and turn with a feeling of regret from such works as some he has exhibited this and the last year of a different character. Even the 'Demons and Destroying Angels', though it seems to point to a moral, is somewhat of too pantomimic an effect, and is calculated to excite any but such ideas as we should wish to see produced by Art.|source=''The Library of the Fine Arts'' review of the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, 1832&lt;ref name="Library1832"&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 1832|title=Exhibition of the Royal Academy|journal=Library of the Fine Arts|volume=4|issue=18|publisher=M. Arnold|location=London|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Although the painting was celebrated as a technical accomplishment, some critics were uncertain if it had the correct moral effect. ''The Library of the Fine Arts'' was critical of its "pantomimic" quality, which it considered "calculated to excite any but such ideas as we should wish to see produced by Art",&lt;ref name="Library1832" /&gt; while ''[[The Examiner (1808–86)|The Examiner]]'' complained about the depiction of women being attacked, arguing: "Mr Etty should not treat the fair sex in this harsh and wanton manner. We doubt his right to put a single one of them into the hands of a Demon, much less to deliver them over by the dozen to the grasp of the destroyers."&lt;ref name="Examiner" /&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' said, &lt;blockquote&gt;We do not profess to understand what class of compositions that is which originates neither in history nor poetry{{efn-ua|name=vision}}—no doubt Mr. Etty does; but as far as we can comprehend his picture, which is much more intelligible than his language, it represents a quantity of able-bodied demons, who appear angry at the ladies for having stayed out so long, and who are come to fetch them home accordingly&lt;/blockquote&gt; and criticised Etty for a "slovenly manner" and for "abusing his rich gifts, and [wasting] upon the wild and unmeaning what might be made subservient to much more worthy purposes".&lt;ref name="Times1832" /&gt; Despite this, the same critic conceded that "The work is one of extraordinary power" and that "The figures are drawn with exquisite skill, the grouping admirably varied, and yet so combined as to present a complete picture, and the colouring vigorous and harmonious in an eminent degree."&lt;ref name="Times1832" /&gt;

Other critics admired Etty's unusual interpretation of apocalyptic religious imagery, his ability to give distinct characters and shapes to the individual demons and their victims, and the vividness of his imagination.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|pp=39–40}} ''[[The Morning Post]]'' particularly praised Etty's ability to convey "creation conceived and thrown upon the canvas with all the fury of poetical inspiration" by combining the "dauntless spirit of a sketch" with the "powerful impression of a finished picture".{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=40}} The prominent art critic [[William Paulet Carey]] (writing under the name of 'Ridolfi') championed ''The Destroying Angel'', and in particular Etty's ability to balance beauty, horror and fear without descending into tastelessness.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|pp=40–41}} Carey saw Etty as proof that British artistic traditions were equal to any others in the world, and ''The Destroying Angel'' as evidence of Etty's "redeeming grace and spirit".{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=41}} Etty's long-standing adversaries at ''The Morning Chronicle'' found little to attack in the painting, their review stating that "The upper part of the picture is masterly, grand and beautiful. The lower part not so well, but some of the figures are in admirable action and fine drawing."{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|pp=41–42}} The reticence of ''The Morning Chronicle'' prompted Carey to comment that they were in "envious silence".{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=42}}

[[File:William Etty self-portrait.jpg|right|upright|thumb|William Etty in 1844&lt;!-- 1844, not 1845. The painting was unveiled in 1845 but it's a copy of an 1844 photograph --&gt;|alt=Middle aged man]]
Despite some criticism, ''The Destroying Angel'' changed the way Etty was perceived by critics. They commonly had viewed Etty's works as insights into his mind, generally with the aim of discrediting him for supposed sexual deviancies.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=40}} Confronted with a piece so obviously intended to convey a moral lesson, many of those same critics felt that Etty had revealed a more moral nature than they had previously believed.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=40}} Many explicitly saw ''The Destroying Angel'' as a counterweight to the nude paintings for which Etty was famous, or even a representation of Etty's own repentance for or renunciation of his previous works.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=41}} ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' described the painting as "a sermon to [Etty's] admirers&amp;nbsp;... where he inflicts poetical justice upon his own gay dames and their gallants, their revels being broken in upon, and they themselves being carried off most unceremoniously, like that ''little'' gentleman Don Juan, by sundry grim-looking brawny devils".&lt;ref name="Fraser's1832"&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 1832|title=Our Royal-Academical Lounge|journal=Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country|publisher=James Fraser|location=London|volume=5|issue=30|page=719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After 1832, Etty exhibited over 80 more paintings at the Summer Exhibition. He remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from this time made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=42}} Yet he remained, in the majority view, a pornographer. [[Charles Robert Leslie]] observed shortly after Etty's death that {{nowrap|"[Etty]}} himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leslie|first=Charles Robert|date=30 March 1850|title=Lecture on the Works of the late W. Etty, Esq, R.A., by Professor Leslie|journal=The Athenæum|location=London|issue=1170|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Etty remained commercially successful in his lifetime, amassing £17,000 (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|17000|1849|r=-5}}|0}} in today's terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) by his death.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

Etty died in 1849, and his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=440}} Interest in him declined over time, and by the end of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=440}} Henry Payne sold ''The Destroying Angel'' in 1854 for 770 guineas (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|808.5|1854|r=-3}}|0}} in today's terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) to [[Joseph Whitworth|Sir Joseph Whitworth]],{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=283}} who donated it in 1882 to the [[Manchester Art Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/the-destroying-angel-and-daemons-of-evil-interrupting-the204938|title=The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate|work=BBC Your Paintings|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it remains.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=130}} The painting was exhibited as part of a major retrospective of Etty's work at the [[York Art Gallery]] in 2011–12.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=131}}

[[File:John Everett Millais Cymon and Iphigenia.jpg|right|thumb|Millais's ''Cymon and Iphigenia'' is one of the few later works influenced by ''The Destroying Angel.''|alt=Savege in a leopardskin and a woman in a wedding dress, surrounded by young women in various stages of undress]]
As Etty had rapidly fallen from fashion, his works had little influence on most subsequent painters. [[William Edward Frost]] was a great admirer of Etty, and Frost's ''Una Alarmed by Fauns'' (1843) and ''Una and the Wood Nymphs'' (1847) owe a conscious debt to ''The Destroying Angel'' in their depiction of a group of semi-clad daemonic and human figures,{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=433}} as does [[John Everett Millais]]'s early work ''Cymon and Iphigenia'' (1848).{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=437}} As Etty's style became increasingly unpopular, those artists who had imitated him, other than Frost, soon abandoned the style. Etty's biographer Leonard Robinson contends that the later [[fairy painting]]s of [[Richard Dadd]], which often show large crowds of mythical creatures mingling with humans, were influenced by Etty but concedes that Dadd was likely unconscious of Etty's influence on his style.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=438}}

'''''The Woman in the Window''''' is a 1944 [[film noir]] directed by [[Fritz Lang]] that tells the story of psychology professor Richard Wanley ([[Edward G. Robinson]]) who meets and becomes enamored with a young [[femme fatale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{AFI film|id=24256|title=The Woman in the Window}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on [[J. H. Wallis]]' novel ''Once Off Guard'', the story features two surprise twists at the end. Scriptwriter [[Nunnally Johnson]] founded International Pictures (his own independent production company) after writing successful films such as ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1940) and other [[John Ford]] films, and chose ''The Woman in the Window'' as its premiere project.  Director Fritz Lang substituted the film's dream ending in place of the originally scripted suicide ending, to conform with the moralistic [[Production Code]] of the time.

The term "film noir" originated as a genre description, in part, because of this movie. The term first was applied to American films in [[France|French]] film magazines in 1946, the year when ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941), ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944), ''[[Laura (1944 movie)|Laura]]'' (1944), ''[[Murder, My Sweet]]'' (1944), and ''The Woman in the Window'' were released in France.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alain Silver|Silver, Alain]], and Elizabeth Ward, eds.  ''Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style,'' page 1, 3rd edition, 1992. Woodstock, New York: [[The Overlook Press]]. {{ISBN|0-87951-479-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[18th Academy Awards]], ''The Woman in the Window'' was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture]] for [[Hugo Friedhofer]] and [[Arthur Lange]]. However,  [[Miklós Rózsa]] for [[Spellbound (1945 film)|''Spellbound'']] got the award.

==Plot==
After psychology professor&lt;ref name="biesen"&gt;Biesen, Sheri Chinen (2005). ''Blackout: World War II and the origins of film noir.'' Johns Hopkins University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-8218-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Wanley (Edward G. Robinson) sends his wife and two children off on vacation, he goes to his club to meet friends. Next door, Wanley sees a striking oil portrait of Alice Reed ([[Joan Bennett]]) in a storefront window. He and his friends talk about the beautiful painting and its subject. Wanley stays at the club and reads [[Song of Songs]]. When he leaves, Wanley stops at the portrait and meets Reed, who is standing near the painting watching people gaze at it. Reed convinces Wanley to join her for drinks.

Later, they go to Reed's home, but an unexpected visit from her rich clandestine lover Claude Mazard, known to Reed initially only as 'Frank Howard' ([[Arthur Loft]]), leads to a fight in which Wanley kills Mazard. Wanley and Reed conspire to cover up the murder, and Wanley disposes Mazard's body in the country. However, Wanley leaves many clues, and there are a number of witnesses. One of Wanley's friends from the club, district attorney Frank Lalor ([[Raymond Massey]]) has knowledge of the investigation, and Wanley is invited back to the crime scene, as Lalor's friend, but not as a suspect. There are several comic dialogues in which Wanley appears to know more about the murder than he should. As the police gather more evidence, Reed is blackmailed by Heidt ([[Dan Duryea]]), a crooked ex-cop who was Mazard's bodyguard. Reed attempts to poison Heidt with a prescription overdose when he returns the next day, but Heidt is suspicious and takes the money without drinking the drugs. Reed tells Wanley, who overdoses on the remaining prescription medicine.

Heidt is killed in a shootout immediately after leaving Reed's home, and police believe Heidt is Mazard's murderer. Reed, seeing that the police have killed Heidt, races to her home to call Wanley, who is slumped over in his chair, and apparently he dies. In an [[Jump cut#Confusion with other transitions|impossible match on action]], Wanley awakens in his chair at his club, and he realizes the entire adventure was a dream in which employees from the club were main characters in the dream. As he steps out on the street in front of the painting, a woman asks Wanley for a light. He adamantly refuses and runs down the street.

==Cast==
* [[Edward G. Robinson]] as Professor Richard Wanley
* [[Joan Bennett]] as Alice Reed
* [[Raymond Massey]] as Dist. Atty. Frank Lalor
* [[Edmund Breon]] as Dr. Michael Barkstane
* [[Dan Duryea]] as Heidt/Tim, the Doorman
* [[Thomas E. Jackson]] as Inspector Jackson, Homicide Bureau
* [[Dorothy Peterson]] as Mrs. Wanley
* [[Arthur Loft]] as Claude Mazard/Frank Howard/Charlie the Hat check Man
* [[Iris Adrian]] as Woman who asks for a light

==Background==
As in Lang's ''[[Scarlet Street]]'', released a year later, Edward G. Robinson plays the lonely middle-aged man and Duryea and Bennett co-star as the criminal elements. The two films also share the same cinematographer - [[Milton R. Krasner]] - and several supporting actors.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
[[File:The Woman in the Window 3.JPG|right|thumb|Joan Bennett as Alice Reed]]
When the film was released, the staff at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine lauded the film and wrote, "Nunnally Johnson whips up a strong and decidedly suspenseful murder melodrama in ''Woman in the Window.'' The producer, who also prepared the screenplay (from the novel ''Once off Guard'' by J.H. Wallis), continually punches across the suspense for constant and maximum audience reaction. Added are especially fine timing in the direction by Fritz Lang and outstanding performances by Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett, Raymond Massey and Dan Duryea."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117796446.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 ''Variety'']. Staff film review, 1945. Accessed: August 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film holds a 95% fresh rating from [[Rotten Tomatoes]] as of July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/woman_in_the_window/ |title=The Woman in the Window |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=July 26, 2016 |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, the online entertainment magazine ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' named the film as the best film noir of all time.&lt;ref name="Paste"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/08/the-100-best-noirs-of-all-time.html?a=1 |title=The 100 Best Film Noirs of All Time |date=August 9, 2015 |accessdate=August 9, 2015 |work=Paste}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Máquinas-Tortilladoras N 1.jpg|thumb|240px|Tortilla machine]]

A '''tortilla machine''', called in Spanish '''máquina tortilladora''', is a mechanical system to process corn dough in order to produce [[corn tortilla]]s, in a serial medium-large scale. They are usually found in ''tortillerías'' or tortilla shops in Mexico and some parts of the United States. The production rate is among 30 to 60 tortillas per minute.

These Mexican patented machines receive the mass of nixtamalized corn to pass it through compression and cut the mass to obtain the shape of the thin tortillas. These are passed through a metal conveyor belt inside an oven so that the tortillas are baked. Afterwards, the tortillas are placed one by one over a receptacle and then sold to the consumer. Tortillas are sold by the weight of several and not by the number of tortillas.

{{For|the Outer Limits episode|Tourist Attraction (The Outer Limits)}}
[[File:Taj Mahal (Edited).jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra]], [[India]], a popular tourist attraction. More than 7-8 million visit the Taj Mahal each year.]]
[[File:Paris 06 Eiffelturm 4828.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]], [[France]], a popular tourist attraction. Almost 7 million visit the tower each year.]]
[[File:Cristo Rei (36211699613).jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Christ the King (Almada)|Christ the King]] statue in [[Almada]], [[Portugal]], became a popular tourist attraction.]]

A '''tourist attraction''' is a place of interest where [[Tourism|tourists]] visit, typically for its inherent or an exhibited natural or cultural value, historical significance, natural or built beauty, offering leisure and amusement.

==Types==
[[File:Bali religiös ceremoni på strand med turister.jpg|thumb|upright|Tropical beaches and [[Bali#Culture|Balinese culture]] are attractions that draw tourists to this popular [[island resort]], such as [[Nyepi#Melasti|Melasti]] rituals performed on the beach.]]
Spots featuring natural beauty such as [[beach]]es, tropical [[island resort]]s, national [[park]]s, [[mountain]]s, [[desert]]s and [[forest]]s, are examples of traditional tourist attractions where people may spend [[summer vacation]]s. Other examples of cultural tourist attractions include historical places, [[monument]]s, ancient [[temple]]s, [[zoo]]s, [[public aquarium|aquaria]], [[museum]]s and [[art galleries]], [[botanical garden]]s, buildings and structures (e.g.,[[List of forts|Fort]]s , [[castle]]s, [[library|libraries]], former [[prison]]s, [[skyscraper]]s, [[bridge]]s), [[theme park]]s and [[carnival]]s, [[living history museum]]s, [[public art]] ([[Sculpture|sculptures]], [[Statue|statues]], [[Mural|murals]]), [[sign]]s, [[ethnic enclave]] communities, [[heritage railway|historic trains]] and cultural events. Factory tours, industrial heritage, creative art and crafts workshops are the object of cultural niches like [[industrial tourism]] and creative tourism. Many tourist attractions are also [[landmark]]s.

Tourist attractions are also created to capitalise on legends such as a supposed [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] crash site near [[Roswell, New Mexico]] and the alleged [[Loch Ness monster]] sightings in [[Scotland]]. Ghost sightings also make tourist attractions.

Ethnic communities may become tourist attractions, such as [[Chinatown]]s in the United States and the black British neighbourhood of [[Brixton]] in [[London]], England.

In the United States, owners and marketers of attractions advertise tourist attractions on billboards along the side of highways and roadways, especially in remote areas. Tourist attractions often provide free promotional brochures and flyers in information centres, fast food restaurants, [[hotel]] and [[motel]] rooms or lobbies, and [[rest area]]s.

While some tourist attractions provide visitors a memorable experience for a reasonable admission charge or even for free, others may be of low quality and overprice their goods and services (such as admission, food, and souvenirs) in order to profit excessively from tourists. Such places are commonly known as [[tourist trap]]s.

Within cities, transport tourist attractions as rides by boats and buses ([[City Sightseeing]], etc.) are  popular.

==Novelty attraction==
Novelty attractions are oddities such as the "[[biggest ball of twine]]" in [[Cawker City, Kansas]], the [[Corn Palace]] in [[Mitchell, South Dakota]], or [[Carhenge]] in [[Alliance, Nebraska]], where old cars serve in the place of stones in a replica of [[Stonehenge]]. Novelty attractions are not limited to the American Midwest, but are part of [[Midwestern United States#Culture|Midwestern culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/us/16bridge.html "A Golden Gate Fantasy on the Kansas Prairie"] article by A.G. Suleberger in ''[[The New York Times]]'' September 15, 2010, accessed September 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourist destination==
[[File:Moss-landing-otter.jpg|thumb|Sea otters, like this one near [[Moss Landing, California|Moss Landing]], are a popular tourist attraction in the [[Monterey Bay|Monterey Bay, California]] area.]]
There is currently no widely accepted definition of the term ''tourist destination''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pike|first1=Steven|last2=Page|first2=Stephen|title=Destination marketing organizations and destination marketing: A narrative analysis of the literature|journal=Tourism Management|date=2014|volume=41|pages=202–207|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2013.09.009|url=https://eprints.qut.edu.au/63293/|hdl=2299/20103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saraniemi|first1=S|last2=Kylanen|first2=M|title=Problemizing the concept of tourist destination: An anlysis of different theoretical approaches.|journal=Journal of Travel Research|date=2011|volume=50|issue=2|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the tourism industry supply perspective a destination is usually defined by a geo-political boundary, given destination marketing is most commonly funded by governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pike|first1=Steven|title=Destination Marketing Essentials|date=2016|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-138-91290-8|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the traveler perspective, a destination might be perceived quite differently.

A tourist destination is a [[city]], [[town]], or other area that is dependent to a significant extent on the revenues accruing from tourism, or "a country, state, region, city, or town which is marketed or markets itself as a place for tourists to visit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beirman|first=David|title=Restoring Tourism Destinations in Crisis: A Strategic Marketing Approach|year=2003|publisher=CABI Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aGLrZKlyfqkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Bierman,+D.+(2003).+Restoring+Tourism+Destinations+in+Crisis:+A+Strategic+Marketing+Approach,+CABI,+Wallingford.#v=onepage&amp;q=island&amp;f|isbn=9781865089119}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may contain one or more tourist attractions and possibly some "tourist traps". [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]] town for example is a popular tourist destination in [[Portugal]]. [[Siem Reap]] town is a popular tourist destination in [[Cambodia]], mainly owed to its proximity to [[Angkor]] temples. [[Loire valley]], the third tourist destination in [[France]] is a good example of region marketed and branded as a place for tourists to visit, mainly known for its [[Châteaux of the Loire valley]].

A tropical island resort is an [[island]] or [[archipelago]] that also depends on tourism as its source of revenue. [[The Bahamas]] in [[Caribbean]] archipelago, [[Bali]] in [[Indonesia]], [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] in [[Thailand]], [[Hawaii]] in the [[United States]], [[Palawan]] in the [[Philippines]], and [[Fiji]] in the Pacific, [[Vamizi Island]], [[Santorini]] and [[Ibiza]] in Mediterranean are examples of popular island resorts.

France, the United States, and Spain were the three most popular international destinations in 2017. The total number of international travelers arriving in those countries was about 234 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/10-most-visited-countries-in-the-world.html|title=10 Most Visited Countries In The World|work=WorldAtlas|date=2018-01-25|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributing 8.9%, 7.7%, and 14.9%, respectively, to the total GDP of those countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://knoema.com/atlas/topics/Tourism/Travel-and-Tourism-Total-Contribution-to-GDP/Contribution-of-travel-and-tourism-to-GDP-percent-of-GDP|title=Contribution of travel and tourism to GDP (% of GDP) by countries, 2017 - knoema.com|work=Knoema|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic impact ==
The tourism industry generates substantial economic benefits to both host countries and tourists home countries. Especially in developing countries, one of the primary motivations for a region to promote itself as a tourism destination is the expected economic improvement. According to the World Tourism Organization, 698 million people travelled to a foreign country in 2000, spending more than US$478 billion. International tourism receipts combined with passenger transport currently total more than US$575 billion – making tourism the worlds number one export earner, ahead of automotive products, chemicals, petroleum and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-07-12|title=Economic impact of tourism|url=http://www.slideshare.net/EmanAbbas/economic-impact-of-tourism-13613739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourist attractions can:
* Contribute to government revenues; direct contributions are generated by taxes on incomes from tourism employment and tourism businesses, and by direct levies on tourists such as departure taxes
* Provide employment
* Support conservation of habitats, species and historic sites
* Stimulate infrastructure investment
* Contribute to local economies
* Provide foreign exchange earnings

==Examples==
Some examples of tourist attractions are:

* Forests, national parks and reserves of flora and fauna
* Communities of different ethnicities
* Constructions and structures (old prisons, libraries, castles, bridges, skyscrapers) and historical places
* Cultural and sports events
* Public art
*Art galleries and museums
* Botanical gardens and zoos
* Monuments
* Theme parks
* Historical trains and ships
* Viewpoints

A '''tractor beam''' is a device with the ability to attract one object to another from a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15535115 | work=BBC News | title=Nasa examines 'tractor beams' for sample gathering | date=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept originates in fiction: the term was coined by [[E. E. Smith]] (an update of his earlier "attractor beam") in his novel ''[[Spacehounds of IPC]]'' (1931).  Since the 1990s, technology and research has laboured to make it a reality, and have had some success on a microscopic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-21187598|title=Star Trek style 'tractor beam' created by scientists|publisher=BBC|date=25 January 2013|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method to realize tractor beams is based on the use of biaxial birefringent media.&lt;ref name=tractor-beam-via-NIM&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nemirovsky|first=Jonathan|author2=Rechtsman Mikael|author3=Segev Mordechai|last-author-amp=yes|title=Negative radiation pressure and negative effective refractive index via dielectric birefringence|journal=Optics Express|date=9 April 2012|volume=20|issue=8|pages=8907–8914|url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-20-8-8907&amp;id=231689|doi=10.1364/oe.20.008907|pmid=22513601|bibcode=2012OExpr..20.8907N}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less commonly, a similar beam that repels is called a '''pressor beam''' or '''repulsor beam'''. Gravity impulse and gravity propulsion beams are traditionally areas of research from [[fringe physics]] that coincide with the concepts of tractor and repulsor beams.

==Physics==
A force field confined to a [[Collimated light|collimated beam]] with clean borders is one of the principal characteristics of tractor and repulsor beams.  Several theories that have predicted repulsive effects do not fall within the category of tractor and repulsor beams because of the absence of field collimation. For example, [[Robert L. Forward]], Hughes Research Laboratories, Malibu, California, showed that general relativity theory allowed the generation of a very brief impulse of a gravity-like repulsive force along the axis of a helical torus containing accelerated [[condensed matter]].&lt;ref&gt;Forward, R. L.. (1961, September 11).  Practical anti-gravity still far off.  ''Missiles and Rockets'', '''9'''(11), 28-31, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1119/1.1969340 | last1 = Forward | first1 =  Robert L.| date = 1963 | title = March.  Guidelines to antigravity | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 166–170 | bibcode=1963AmJPh..31..166F}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mainstream scientific community has accepted Forward’s work.  A variant of [[Burkhard Heim]]’s theory by [[Walter Dröscher]], Institut für Grenzgebiete der Wissenschaft (IGW), Innsbruck, Austria, and Jocham Häuser, University of Applied Sciences and CLE GmbH, Salzgitter, Germany, predicted a repulsive force field of gravitophotons could be produced by a ring rotating above a very strong magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;Dröscher, W., &amp; Häuser, J. (2004, July). ''Guidelines for a space propulsion device based on Heim's quantum theory'' (AIAA 2004-3700). Paper presented at the meeting of the 40th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference &amp; Exhibit, Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  This work was named the 2004 AIAA Best Paper by the AIAA Nuclear and Future Flight Technical Committee.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heim’s theory, and its variants, have been treated by the mainstream scientific community as fringe physics. But the works by Forward, Dröscher, and Häuser could not be considered as a form of repulsor or tractor beam because the predicted impulses and field effects were not confined to a well defined, collimated region.

The following are a summary of experiments and theories that resemble repulsor and tractor beam concepts:

===1960s===
In July 1960, ''Missiles and Rockets'' reported Martin N. Kaplan, Senior Research Engineer, Electronics Division, Ryan Aeronautical Company, San Diego, had conducted experiments that justified planning for a more comprehensive research program.  The article indicated such a program, if successful, would yield either “restricted” or “general” results.  It described the “restricted” results as an ability to direct an anti-gravitational force towards or away from a second body.&lt;ref name="Force"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Force | date = 1960 | title = July 11 | journal = Missiles and Rockets | volume = 7 | issue = 2| page = 27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Copenhagen physicists, L. Halpern, Universitetets Institut for Teoretisk Fysik, and B. Laurent, Nordisk Institut for Teoretisk Atomfysik, indicated general relativity theory and quantum theory allowed the generation and amplification of [[gravitons]] in a manner like the LASER.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Halpern | first1 = L. | last2 = Laurent | first2 = B. | date = 1964 | title = Agosto.  On the gravitational radiation of microscopic systems | journal = Il Nuovo Cimento | volume = XXXIII | issue = 3| pages = 728–751 | doi=10.1007/bf02749891| bibcode = 1964NCim...33..728H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They showed, in principle, gravitational radiation in the form of a beam of [[graviton]]s could be generated and amplified by using induced, resonant emissions.

===1990s===
In 1992, Russian Professor of Chemistry, [[Yevgeny Podkletnov]], and Nieminen, [[Tampere University of Technology]], Tampere, Finland, discovered weight fluctuations in objects above an electromagnetically levitated, massive, composite superconducting disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0921-4534(92)90055-H | last1 = Podkletnov | first1 = E. | last2 = Nieminen | first2 = R. | date = 1992 | title = A possibility of gravitational force shielding by bulk YBa2Cu3O7-x superconductor | journal = Physica C | volume = 203 | issue = 3–4| pages = 441–444 |bibcode = 1992PhyC..203..441P }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three years later, Podkletnov reported the results of additional experiments with a toroidal disk superconductor.&lt;ref&gt;Podkletnov, E. E. (1995, January).  Weak gravitational shielding properties of composite bulk YBa2Cu3O7-x superconductor below 70 K under e.m. field [Report MSU-chem 95]. Moscow, Russia: Moscow Chemical Scientific Research Centre.  Also, LANL Physics Preprint Server, arXiv: cond-mat/9701074v3.&lt;/ref&gt;  They reported the weight of the samples would fluctuate between -2.5% and +5.4% as the angular speed of the superconductor increased.  Certain combinations of disk angular speeds and electromagnetic frequencies caused the fluctuations to stabilize at a 0.3% reduction.  The experiments with the toroidal disk yielded reductions that reached a maximum of 1.9-2.1%.  Reports about both sets of experiments stated the weight loss region was cylindrical, extending vertically for at least three meters above the disk.  Qualitative observations of an expulsive force at the border of the shielded zone were reported in the Fall of 1995.&lt;ref name="Congress"&gt;Modanese, G. (1997).  Updating the theoretical analysis of the weak gravitational shielding experiments.  ''Proceedings of the 1997 IAF Congress'', nr. IAA-97-4.107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian physicist Giovanni Modanese, while a Von Humboldt Fellow at the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]], made the first attempt to provide a theoretical explanation of Podkletnov’s observations.&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Modanese | first1 = G | year = 1996 | title = Theoretical analysis of a reported weak-gravitational-shielding effect | url = | journal = Europhysics Letters | volume = 35 | issue = 6| pages = 413–418 |arxiv=hep-th/9505094 | doi=10.1209/epl/i1996-00129-8| bibcode = 1996EL.....35..413M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He argued the shielding effect and slight expulsive force at the border of the shielded zone could be explained in terms of induced changes in the local [[cosmological constant]].  Modanese described several effects in terms of responses to modifications to the local cosmological constant within the superconductor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Modanese | first1 = G | year = 1996 | title = Role of a "local" cosmological constant in Euclidean quantum gravity | url = | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 54 | issue = 8| pages = 5002–5009 |arxiv=hep-th/9601160 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.54.5002| bibcode = 1996PhRvD..54.5002M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ning Wu, Institute of High Energy Physics, Beijing, China, used the theory of quantum gauge theory of gravity he had developed in 2001 to explain Podkletnov’s observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wu | first1 = N | year = 2004 | title = Gravitational shielding effects in gauge theory of gravity | url = | journal = Communications in Theoretical Physics | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 567–572 |arxiv=hep-th/0307225 | doi=10.1088/0253-6102/41/4/567| bibcode = 2004CoTPh..41..567W}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wu’s theory approximated the relative gravity loss as 0.03% (an order of magnitude smaller than the reported range of 0.3 – 0.5%).

Several groups around the world tried to replicate Podkletnov’s gravity shielding observations.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0376-0421(02)00049-0 | last1 = Allen | first1 = J. E. | date = 2003 | title = Quest for novel force: a possible revolution in aerospace | journal = Progress in Aerospace Sciences | volume = 39 | pages = 1–60 | bibcode=2003PrAeS..39....1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to R. Clive Woods, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [[Iowa State University]], those groups were not able to overcome the extremely challenging technical problems of replicating all aspects of the 1992 experimental conditions.&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woods | first1 = R. C. | date = 2004 | title = Review of claims of interaction between gravitation and high-temperature superconductors | journal = AIP Conference Proceedings | volume = 669 | issue = 1| pages = 1085–1092 | doi = 10.1063/1.1649676}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Woods summarised those shortcomings in the following list:

:* Use of a superconductor disk with a diameter greater than 100 mm;
:* A disk containing ~30% non-superconducting YBCO, preferable organised into two layers;
:* A disk capable of self-levitation, but still containing large numbers of inter-grain junctions;
:* An AC levitation field with a frequency of ~10 kHz;
:* A second excitation field with a frequency of ~1 MHz, for disk rotation; and
:* Disk rotation speeds of 3,000 rpm or greater for large (&gt;0.05%) gravitational effects.

C. S. Unnikrishan, [[TIFR|Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay, India]], showed that if the effect had been caused by gravitational shielding, the shape of the shielded region would be similar to a shadow from the gravitational shield.  For example, the shape of the shielded region above a disk would be conical.  The height of the cone's apex above the disk would vary directly with the height of the shielding disk above the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0921-4534(96)00340-1 | last1 = Unnikrishan | first1 = C. S. | date = 1996 | title = Does a superconductor shield gravity? | journal = Physica C | volume = 266 | pages = 133–137 |bibcode = 1996PhyC..266..133U }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Podkeltnov and Nieminen described the shape of the weight loss region as a cylinder that extended through the ceiling above the [[cryostat]].  That factor and others precipitated a recommendation to reclassify the effect as gravitational modification instead of gravitational shielding.&lt;ref name="Woods"/&gt;  Such a reclassification means the region causing the weight modifications can be directed and is not limited to the space above the superconductor.

===2000s===
In 2001, Podkeltnov and Modanese reported the generation of a beam of gravity-like impulses.&lt;ref&gt;Podkletnov, E., &amp; Modanese, G. (2001, August 3).  Impulse gravity generator based on charged YBa2Cu3O7-y superconductor with composite crystal structure. LANL Physics Preprint Server, arXiv: physics/0108005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Podkletnov, E., &amp; Modanese, G. (2003, August).  Investigation of high voltage discharges in low pressure gases through large ceramic superconducting electrodes.  ''[[Journal of Low Temperature Physics]]'', '''132'''(3-4), 239-259. {{arXiv|physics/0209051}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their paper indicated a high voltage discharge device had been constructed that emitted a horizontal, collimated beam, with sharp borders, of short impulses of a repulsive force field that could penetrate different bodies without any noticeable loss of energy.  Subsequently, the apparatus was dubbed an impulse gravity generator.  Measurements of the impulses taken three to six meters beyond the emitter and in a building 150 meters away yielded identical results.  Analyses of the measurements indicated the impulses briefly caused accelerations one thousand times the rate of gravity.

The gravity impulse generator received further theoretical support from David Maker and Glen A. Robertson, Gravi Atomic Research, Madison, Alabama&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maker | first1 = D. | date = 2002 | title =  A new kind of electrostatic propulsion from fractal space-time physics.  |journal=AIP Conference Proceedings|volume=608|pages= 633–642 |doi=10.1063/1.1449782}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maker | first1 = D. | last2 = Robertson | first2 = G.

(2006).  Mechanism for gravity impulse.  ''Communications in Theoretical Physics'', '''46''', 639-642.   arXiv: gr-qc/0510010v1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chris Taylor, Jupiter Research Corporation, Houston, Texas, along with a private individual Robert Hendry and the original theorist Modanese conducted an analysis of the suitability of impulse gravity generators for Earth-to-orbit, interplanetary, and interstellar applications, this was repeated again in 2008 and a United States and European patent was received.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor, C. Y., &amp; Modanese, G. (2002, July 10).  Evaluation of an impulse gravity generator based beamed propulsion concept [AIAA-2002-4095].  Presented by Taylor at the 38th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference, Indianapolis, IN. {{arXiv|physics/0209023}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, mainstream scientific community have treated the impulse gravity generator reports as extremely speculative and controversial.&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt;  At least one other group based in central Europe has attempted to replicate Podkletnov's gravity impulse generator experiment, but they have elected not to publish their results.

===2010s===
A team of scientists at the Australian National University led by Professor Andrei Rode created a device similar to a tractor beam to move small particles 1.5 meters through the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shvedov|first=Vladlen|author2=A. V. Rode |author3=Ya. V. Izdebskaya |author4=A. S. Desyatnikov |author5=W. Z. Krolikowski |author6=Yu.S.

This method confines particles to the centre of the beam using [[photophoresis]], whereby illuminated sections of the particle have a higher temperature and thus impart more momentum to air molecules incident on the surface.  Owing to this method, it is impossible for such a device to work in space due to lack of air, but Professor Rode states that there are practical applications for the device on Earth such as, for example, the transportation of microscopic hazardous materials and other microscopic objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smart|first=Ashley|title=Optical manipulation of light – absorbing particles takes to the air|journal=Physics Today|date=November 2010|volume=63|issue=11|pages=13–14|doi=10.1063/1.3518265|bibcode=2010PhT....63k..13S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aussiescientists"&gt;{{cite news | last =McDaniel | first =Tracie | title =Aussie Scientists Have New "Pull" as Tractor Beam Goes the Distance | work =[[Daily Tech]] | date =September 9, 2010 | url =http://www.dailytech.com/Aussie+Scientists+Have+New+Pull+as+Tractor+Beam+Goes+the+Distance/article19583.htm | accessdate =2010-09-09 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20100913022948/http://www.dailytech.com/Aussie+Scientists+Have+New+Pull+as+Tractor+Beam+Goes+the+Distance/article19583.htm | archive-date =2010-09-13 | dead-url =yes | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Sinko and Clifford Schlecht researched a form of reversed-thrust laser propulsion as a macroscopic laser tractor beam.

In March 2011, Chinese scientists posited that a specific type of [[Bessel beam]] (a special kind of laser that does not diffract at the centre) is capable of creating a pull-like effect on a given microscopic particle, forcing it towards the beam source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Chris Gayomali | title = Tractor Beam Lasers?

They show explicitly that the necessary condition to realize a negative (pulling) optical force is the simultaneous excitation of multipoles in the particle and if the projection of the total photon momentum along the propagation direction is small, attractive optical force is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Backward Pulling Force from a Forward Propagating Beam   | journal = Nature Photonics | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = 531 | date = 24 February 2011 | author1 = Jun Chen | author2 = Jack Ng | author3 = Zhifang Lin | author4 = C. T. Chan  | arxiv= 1102.4905 | doi = 10.1038/nphoton.2011.153 | bibcode = 2011NaPho...5..531C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese scientists suggest this possibility may be implemented for optical micromanipulation.

Functioning tractor beams based on solenoidal modes of light were demonstrated in 2010 by physicists at [[New York University]].&lt;ref name="LeeRoichman2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Sang-Hyuk|last2=Roichman|first2=Yohai|last3=Grier|first3=David G.|title=Optical solenoid beams|journal=Optics Express|volume=18|issue=7|date=2010|page=6988|issn=1094-4087|doi=10.1364/OE.18.006988|bibcode=2010OExpr..18.6988L}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The spiraling intensity distribution in these non-diffracting beams tends to trap illuminated objects and thus helps to 
overcome the radiation pressure that ordinarily would drive them down the optical axis.  
[[Orbital angular momentum of light|Orbital angular momentum]] transferred from the solenoid beam's helical wavefronts then 
drives the trapped objects upstream along the spiral.  Both Bessel-beam and solenoidal tractor beams are being considered for 
applications in space exploration by [[NASA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Nasa examines 'tractor beams' for sample gathering

In 2013, scientists at the Institute of Scientific Instruments (ISI) and the university of St Andrews succeeded in creating a tractor beam that pulls objects on a microscopic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Star-Trek style tractor beam created by scientists | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-21187598 | date = 25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new study states that while this technique is new, it may have potential for bio-medical research. 
Professor Zemanek said: “The whole team have spent a number of years investigating various configurations of particles delivery by light. 
Dr Brzobohaty said: “These methods are opening new opportunities for fundamental photonics as well as applications for life-sciences.”
Dr Cizmar said: “Because of the similarities between optical and acoustic particle manipulation we anticipate that this concept will provide inspiration for exciting future studies in areas outside the field of photonics.”

Physicist from the Australian National University successfully built a reversible tractor beam, capable of transporting particles "one fifth of a millimetre in diameter a distance of up to 20 centimetres, around 100 times further than previous experiments."  According to Professor Wieslaw Krolikowski, of the Research School of Physics and Engineering, “demonstration of a large scale laser beam like this is a kind of holy grail for laser physicists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/physicists-build-reversible-tractor-beam|title=Physicists build reversible tractor beam|date=6 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work was published in Nature in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nphoton.2014.242.html|title=A long-range polarization-controlled optical tractor beam|first1=Vladlen|last1=Shvedov|first2=Arthur R.|last2=Davoyan|first3=Cyril|last3=Hnatovsky|first4=Nader|last4=Engheta|first5=Wieslaw|last5=Krolikowski|date=1 November 2014|publisher=|journal=Nat Photonics|volume=8|issue=11|pages=846–850|via=www.nature.com|doi=10.1038/nphoton.2014.242|bibcode=2014NaPho...8..846S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a team of researchers have built the world's first sonic tractor beam that can lift and move objects using sound waves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2015-10-sonic-tractor-video.html#jCp Sonic tractor beam invented (w/ Video)] published by [[Phys.org]] on October 27, 2015 (DOI: 10.1038/ncomms9661)&lt;/ref&gt; A DIY instructables to build your own toy acoustic tractor beam was made available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.instructables.com/id/Acoustic-Tractor-Beam/|title=Acoustic Tractor Beam|newspaper=Instructables.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a research team from Tel-Aviv University led by Dr. Alon Bahabad experimentally demonstrated an optical analog of the famous Archimedes’ screw where the rotation of a helical-intensity laser beam is transferred to the axial motion of optically trapped micrometer-scale, airborne, carbon-based particles. With this optical screw, particles were easily conveyed with controlled velocity and direction, upstream or downstream of the optical flow, over a distance of half a centimeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hadad|first1=Barak|last2=Froim|first2=Sahar|last3=Nagar|first3=Harel|last4=Admon|first4=Tamir|last5=Eliezer|first5=Yaniv|last6=Roichman|first6=Yael|last7=Bahabad|first7=Alon|title=Particle trapping and conveying using an optical Archimedes&amp;#x2019; screw|journal=Optica|date=2 May 2018|volume=5|issue=5|pages=551–556|doi=10.1364/OPTICA.5.000551|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/optica/abstract.cfm?uri=optica-5-5-551|language=EN|issn=2334-2536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
[[Science fiction]] movies and telecasts normally depict tractor and repulsor beams as audible, narrow rays of visible light that cover a small area of a target. Tractor beams are most commonly used on [[Spacecraft|spaceships]] and [[space station]]s. They are generally used in three ways:
# As a device for securing or retrieving cargo, passengers, shuttlecraft, etc. This is analogous to [[crane (machine)|crane]]s on modern [[ship]]s.
# As a device to harness objects that can then be used as improptu weapons by the craft
# As a means of preventing an enemy from escaping, analogous to [[grappling hook]]s.

In the latter case, there are usually countermeasures that can be employed against tractor beams. These may include pressor beams (a stronger pressor beam will counteract a weaker tractor beam) or ''plane shears'' aka ''shearing planes'' (a device to "cut" the tractor beam and render it ineffective). In some fictional realities, [[energy shield|shields]] can block tractor beams, or the generators can be disabled by sending a large amount of energy back up the beam to its source.

Tractor beams and pressor beams can be used together as a weapon: by attracting one side of an enemy spaceship while repelling the other, one can create severely damaging shear effects in its hull. Another mode of destructive use of such beams is rapid alternating between pressing and pulling force in order to cause structural damage to the ship as well as inflicting lethal forces on its crew.

Two objects being brought together by a tractor beam are usually attracted toward their common centre of gravity. This means that if a small spaceship applies a tractor beam to a large object such as a planet, the ship will be drawn towards the planet, rather than vice versa.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

In ''[[Star Trek]]'', tractor beams are imagined to work by placing a target in the focus of a subspace/graviton interference pattern created by two beams from an emitter. When the beams are manipulated correctly the target is drawn along with the interference pattern. The target may be moved toward or away from the emitter by changing the polarity of the beams. Range of the beam affects the maximum mass that can be moved by the emitter, and the emitter subjects its anchoring structure to significant force.&lt;ref&gt;Startrek Reference Manual, Rick Sternbach and Michael Okuda, pages 89 - 90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
* [[E. E. Smith]] first coined the term "tractor beam" (an update of his earlier "attractor beam") in his novel ''[[Spacehounds of IPC]]'', originally serialized in [[Amazing Stories]] magazine in 1931.  The hero of his ''[[Skylark of Space]]'' books (1929 onwards), had invented "attractor beams" and "repellor beams." Repellors can also be emitted [[isotropy|isotropically]] as a sort of defensive [[Force field (fiction)|force field]] against material projectiles.
* In [[Philip Francis Nowlan]]'s [[Buck Rogers]] novel, ''[[Armageddon 2419 A.D.]]'' (1928), the enemy airships used "repellor beams" for support and propulsion,&lt;ref&gt;Nowlan, P. F. (1962). ''Armageddon 2419 A. D.'' [pp. 37-41]. New York, NY: Ace Books, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the "eighth ray" beams used for support and propulsion of Martian airships in the [[Barsoom]]/John Carter of Mars series by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], first published 1912-1943.
* The ''[[Lensman]]'' books by [[E. E. Smith]].
* ''[[Tom Swift]]'' - In the new Tom Swift Jr. book ''Tom Swift and The Deep-Sea Hydrodome'' (1958), Tom invents the "repellatron". The device can be set to repel specific chemical elements. It was used to create a bubble habitat on the ocean floor, and as the propulsion system for his spacecraft ''Challenger''.
* The ''[[Honor Harrington]]'' books by [[David Weber]]
* The ''[[Sector General]]'' books by [[James White (author)|James White]] The 1963 novel ''[[Star Surgeon]]'' is the source of the combined tractor/pressor beam weapon, the so-called "Rattler". These weapons attract then repel the target (entire ship or a segment of the ship's hull) at 80 gs, several times a minute. The novel also featured a type of [[Force field (science fiction)|force field]] called a "repulsion screen".
* [[David Weber#Steve White|Starfire series]] - the combined tractor/pressor beam weapon
* ''[[Starplex]]'' by [[Robert J. Sawyer]]
* ''[[The Trigger]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] involves the development of tractor beams in the early part of the novel.
* ''[[Sixth Column]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] describes tractor/pressor beams as a product of the physics of a "newly-discovered magneto-gravitic or electro-gravitic spectra" featured in the novel.

===Comics===
* ''[[Buck Rogers]]'' comic strip - originally just repulsor beams; tractors appeared by the 1970s
* [[Archie Comics]], where it is caricatured as a literal "tractor"
* [[Iron Man]]'s various armor suits usually feature repulsor beam projectors mounted in the palms as one of the main weapon systems.

===Movies and television series===
* ''[[Star Trek]]'' (TV series, films, books and games). One of the most visible and iconic uses of the concept. One of the few prominent fictitious depictions which used such beams repeatedly and referred to them consistently as tractor beams.

:The Original Series used the tractor beam several times. In the first episode produced for the series, "[[The Corbomite Maneuver]]", the Enterprise was captured and towed by a tractor beam which they attempted to escape by shearing away at a 90 degree course. In "[[Space Seed]]", it was used to tow Khan Noonien Singh's ship, the SS ''Botany Bay''. In "[[Tomorrow Is Yesterday]]", the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Starship Enterprise]] attempts to capture Captain John Christopher's 20th century [[F-104 Starfighter]] jet, "Bluejay 4", using a tractor beam.

* ''[[Transformers: Beast Wars]]'' The Predacons capture the Decepticon flagship ''Nemesis'' and use its tractor beam to attempt to destroy the Maximals and the ''Ark''. It appeared to be powered by spinning grinders, gears blades, etc.
* ''[[District 9]]'' (2009) Near the climax, the command module and an assortment of dirt and rocks were pulled towards the mothership using a mildly illuminated array of tractor beams.
* ''[[Star Wars]]'' (films, TV series, books, games) In ''Episode IV'' (1977), the [[Millennium Falcon]] becomes caught in the Death Star's tractor beam after arriving at the former location of Alderaan and following a lone [[TIE fighter]] towards what they first believe to be a moon.
* ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980)
* ''[[Babylon 5]]'' (TV series). The Minbari Federation is known to use "gravity nets" which wrap a bubble around its target allowing the ship creating the net to "grapple" the target. They also have some sort of "levitation beams" seen in the television film "In the Beginning" wherein Lennier and a group of Minbari emissaries from the Grey Council are levitated from a platform on the ground up to ship high above them.
* The ''[[seaQuest DSV]]'' episode "[[Splashdown (seaQuest DSV)|Splashdown]]".
* In ''[[Spaceballs]]'' (1987), ''Spaceball One'' uses a tractor beam - referred to as a "magnetic beam" in the film - to intercept Princess Vespa's Mercedes space cruiser.
* The [[Taelon]] mothership on ''[[Earth: Final Conflict]]'' used tractor beams on several occasions.
* In ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (2004), Syndrome uses [[zero-point energy]] to mimic tractor and pressor beam behaviors.
* In ''[[Recess: School's Out]]'' (2001), the film's main [[antagonist]] attempted to use a tractor beam to move the moon to create a new [[ice age]].
* The anime ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' (known as ''[[Star Blazers]]'' outside Japan). In one episode, multiple magnetic beam projectors on planet Gamilon were used to drag the ''Yamato'' into a trap.
* [[Pixar]]'s short film ''[[Lifted (2006 film)|Lifted]]'' (2006) is based on an alien character who is in a tractor beam usage test.
* In ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' (2002), [[Dr. Evil]]'s evil plan involved using a tractor beam to crash a golden asteroid into the Earth, causing a torrential flood.
* In the animated series ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', one of Dr. Weird's inventions is a rainbow shooting machine, which actually turns out to be a tractor beam, but the doc simply calls it "this thing".
* In ''[[This Island Earth]]'' (1955), a small airplane was drawn into a Metalunan flying saucer by a visible and audible tractor beam that engulfed the entire aircraft.
* In ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' (1992), Garth says "Stacy alert. We've been spotted and are being pulled in by her tractor beam" when Wayne's obsessed ex-girlfriend approaches them at a bar.
* In ''[[Fire in the Sky]]'' (1993), [[Travis Walton UFO incident|Travis Walton]] gets moved up in the air by a blue-green light from a UFO. After some time, the beam smashes him to the ground.
* In ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'' (2004), the Xilien's UFO uses a tractor beam to transport the kaiju to destroy the Earth's major cities.
* In ''[[The Orville]]'' (TV series), the Planetary Union starship ''Orville'' uses a tractor beam on a number of occasions.
* In ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', the Black Order's Q-Ships are equipped with a tractor beam. It was shown used by the Q-Ship of Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian to attract an unconcsious Doctor Strange, in order to get his Time Stone, and Spider-Man who was trapped by the beam as well.

===Games===
* ''[[Bully (video game)|Bully]]'' - After Jimmy gives the Hobo all 6 transistors and he completes the machine, he is pulled away to the sky by a brightly colored tractor beam while a sinister laugh echoes. He is never seen again, but the tractor beam can be seen shining from his lot at night afterwards.
* ''[[Garry's Mod]]'' (Half Life 2 Mod) - The Physics Gun is used in the sandbox game to build using props by freezing them in mid-air with an adjustable distance tractor beam
* ''[[Galaga]]'' - used by the Galagas to steal the player's ship.
* The "Grabber" in ''[[Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil]]''
* The Salvage Corvette's "Salvage Field" in ''[[Homeworld]]''
* The Grapple Beam from the [[Metroid series|''Metroid'' series]], which allows the player to attach to and swing from special points or surfaces, as well as the Charge Beam from ''[[Metroid Prime]]'' and its sequels, which allows the player to draw power-ups in from a distance.
* One Crystal Eres (magic spell) in ''[[Tales of Legendia]]'' and a magic spell in ''[[Tales of Phantasia]]'' is named Tractor Beam, that launches the enemy in the air.
* In ''[[Time Crisis 4]]'', [[Wild Dog (Time Crisis)|Wild Dog]] uses a Tractor Beam at one point to direct crates and other heavy objects at the players.
* ''[[Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando]]'', it is used as a gadget to move marked objects from one place to another, often to advance the plot.
* In ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', [[Gordon Freeman]] is armed with a device called the "Zero-Point Energy Field Manipulator" or simply the "[[Gravity gun|Gravity Gun]]", which can pick up, throw, and "punt" heavy or sharp objects with little or no physical effort. In the last mission, it is accidentally modified to manipulate organic matter, and can throw [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] soldiers to their deaths. In addition, on E3 2003 the "Physics Gun" that allows to move objects freely in three dimensions was shown.
* A similar gun to the one in ''Half-Life 2'', called the "Uplink", appears in ''[[TimeSplitters: Future Perfect]]'', available to the player beginning with the second mission. In addition to a "gravity gun", the item also serves as a map and a [[Time travel|time machine]] for the player's character, [[Sergeant Cortez]].
* In [[Freelancer (video game)|Freelancer]], each ship is fitted with a tractor beam, with which it salvages cargo, weapons and mission items from destroyed ships.
* In the video game ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', yet another similar gun to ''Half-Life 2''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s, which is titled the "Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device", can create a weaker zero-point energy field by simply lifting objects and carrying them, but cannot throw or pull in from a distance. These items can also be dropped through the portals it can create. Unstationary Scaffolds and chamberlock elevators move on tractor beams. A tractor beam known as the "Aperture Science Excursion Funnel" appears in the second game in the series, ''[[Portal 2]]''. [[Razer Hydra]] owners get upgraded version of the Portal Device in ''Portal 2'' which can freely move objects in three dimensions.
*In the [[MMORPG]] [[EVE Online]] tractor beams can be used to retrieve wrecks of enemy ships and cargo containers in space.
*Another similar gun to Half-Life 2's gravity gun called the "Capture gun" appears as the primary tool in the [[Wii]] video game [[Elebits]], where it is used to manipulate objects and capture the titular creatures.
* In the MMORPG Star Sonata, tractor beams can be used to push and pull enemy ships, collect debris from space, and are also a valid form of transportation.
* [[Star Control 2]]: ships of [[Chmmr]] are equipped with tractor beams that work on practically infinite range.
* [[The Simpsons Game]], in the "Invasion of the Yokel Snatchers" level.
* In [[Sword of the Stars]] you are able to equip your ships with tractor beams.
* [[The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run]] features a tractor beam throughout level 7. It is first seen in Level 2, which abducts Bart from the Honour Roller. In level 7, it can be driven into and your car will be abducted, before being destroyed. This will drop the empty chassis to the ground, which can still be driven. This works to the players advantage, as it can be used to send up barrels of nuclear waste, which destroys the space ship, taking Homer Simpson's '70's Sports Car', Snake and Bandit, John Frink and the Hover Car {trademark}, and finally Abraham Simpson and a modified WWII Vehicle, which eventually destroys it. Comic Book Guy remarks that such a thing is the 'Worst Effect Ever!'
* In the Space stage of spore, the player acquires the Tractor Beam tool very early in the stage. This tool is used only for picking up objects on the ground that are not vehicles or buildings.
* in [[Minecraft: Story Mode]], the first main antagonist, the Wither Storm, emits a large purple tractor beam from its eyes to pull debris and organisms alike into its body to add more mass to itself.

A '''transportation network company''' ('''TNC'''), sometimes known as a '''mobility service provider''' ('''MSP''') or '''ride-hailing service''', is an organization that pairs [[passengers]] via [[website]]s and [[mobile app]]s with [[Driver (person)|drivers]] who provide such services. Transportation network companies are examples of the [[sharing economy]] and [[shared mobility]].

Transportation network companies have been noted for providing service in less populated or poorer areas that are not regularly served by [[taxicabs]], and charging lower rates than taxicabs, since taxicab rates are often set by local jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/uber-is-here-to-stay-and-thats-a-good-thing/article24481955/|title=Uber is here to stay, and that's a good thing|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-07-20/uber-serves-the-poor-by-going-where-taxis-don-t|title=Uber Serves the Poor by Going Where Taxis Don't|author=Megan McArdle|date=July 20, 2015|work=BloombergView.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/08/08/209885782/californias-new-rules-could-change-the-rideshare-game|title=California's New Rules Could Change The Rideshare Game|last=Rott|first=Nate|date=August 8, 2013|work=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reports say TNCs reduce [[traffic congestion]]: since their cars "can't accept street hails, they do much less unnecessary driving-around than either government-licensed/regulated taxi cabs (who are cruising for hails) or individuals (who are looking for a parking spot)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fusion.net/story/175479/uber-new-york-taxis/|title=New Yorkers love Uber.

Studies are inconclusive on whether TNCs reduce drunk driving rates in cities where they operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lyftubernewsletter.com/uber-advantage-over-taxis/|title=Uber Prevents Drunk Driving: Advantage Over Taxis|work=Lyft Uber Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/tripping/wp/2016/07/27/is-uber-reducing-drunk-driving-new-study-says-no/|title=Is Uber reducing drunk driving?

==Definition and terminology==
In 2013, the [[California Public Utilities Commission#Transportation Network Companies|California Public Utilities Commission]] defined, for regulatory purposes, a transportation network company as a company that uses an online-enabled platform to connect passengers with drivers using their personal, non-commercial vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=DECISION ADOPTING RULES AND REGULATIONS TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY WHILE ALLOWING NEW ENTRANTS TO THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY | url=http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M077/K112/77112285.PDF | publisher=[[California Public Utilities Commission]] | date=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia defines a TNC as a company that "provides prearranged rides for compensation using a digital platform that connects passengers with drivers using a personal vehicle."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/commercial/#tnc/faqs.asp Virginia DMV: TNC Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Ridesharing"===
{{Seealso|Real-time ridesharing|Peer-to-peer ridesharing}}
TNC platforms have sometimes been called "ridesharing", but the terms "ridesourcing" and "[[real-time ridesharing|ride hailing]]" have been developed to describe the transportation services associated with TNCs. Some early reports used the term "ridesourcing" to clarify that drivers do not share a destination with their passengers and that the driver's primary motivation was income.&lt;ref&gt;Rayle, L., S. Shaheen, N. Chan, D. Dai, and R. Cervero. [http://www.its.dot.gov/itspac/Dec2014/RidesourcingWhitePaper_Nov2014.pdf "App-Based, On-Demand Ride Services: Comparing Taxi and Ridesourcing Trips and User Characteristics in San Francisco"]. University of California Transportation Center, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ridesourcing" refers to the [[outsourcing]] of rides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Geron | first=Tomio | title=California Becomes First State To Regulate Ridesharing Services Lyft, Sidecar, UberX | url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2013/09/19/california-becomes-first-state-to-regulate-ridesharing-services-lyft-sidecar-uberx/ | work=[[Forbes Magazine]] | date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2015, the Associated Press Stylebook officially adopted the term "ride-hailing" to describe the services offered by [[Lyft]] and [[Uber]]&lt;ref name="Warzel 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Warzel | first=Charlie | title=Let's All Join The AP Stylebook In Killing The Term 'Ride-Sharing' | website=BuzzFeed | date=2015-01-08 | url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/lets-all-join-the-ap-stylebook-in-killing-the-term-ride-shar | access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reflect the availability of private vehicles and taxis services on the platforms. "Ride-hailing" makes no reference to the driver's motivation or to the trip characteristics; some rides may not necessarily be motivated by income.&lt;ref name="Anderson pp. 1099–1117"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Anderson | first=Donald N. | title='Not just a taxi'? For-profit ridesharing, driver strategies, and VMT | journal=Transportation | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=41 | issue=5 | date=2014-05-28 | issn=0049-4488 | doi=10.1007/s11116-014-9531-8 | pages=1099–1117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uber allows drivers to match destinations with riders in limited cases.&lt;ref name="Uber"&gt;{{cite web | title=Set my Driver Destination | website=Uber | url=https://help.uber.com/h/91b17c66-ec67-42fc-a548-b1ec8934a9f5 | access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, using "ride-hailing" interchangeably with "ridesharing" can be misleading. Companies like Uber and Lyft prohibit drivers from picking up 'hailers' as all of their riders need to be logged through their website or mobile app software to adhere to their terms and conditions and local laws. Otherwise these companies would be categorized as a 'taxi service.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://commercialdriverhq.com/what-is-rideshare/|title=What is Rideshare? How Ridesharing Companies Like Uber Work|date=2018-02-04|work=Commercial Driver HQ|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Drivesharing"===

Drivesharing is an arrangement where several drivers share a vehicle to transport rideshare passengers for a fee. Vehicles used in drivesharing are not owned by any of the drivers, but instead rented from a drivesharing (third-party) company that services or is in partnership with a TNC like Uber and Lyft. Drivesharing responds to the high demand of qualified drivers who are interested in working for TNC platforms but do not want to acquire or use their own vehicle to do so. Drivesharing companies aim to help the ridesharing industry by increasing ridesharing accessibility, getting more paid drivers on the road and reducing individual vehicle ownership for drivers and riders alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.autzu.com/faq|title=Autzu|website=www.autzu.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, TNCs are required by law to have a certain amount of wheelchair accessible vehicles (WAVs) on the road at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Uber-does-not-have-enough-wheelchair-accessible-12714533.php|title=Uber does not have enough wheelchair-accessible vehicles, new lawsuit says|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be a difficult requirement for TNCs to meet because TNCs don't provide vehicles and most drivers do not own a WAV, causing a shortage. Third-party drivesharing companies are stepping in to help fill that gap by providing TNC approved WAV vehicles that drivers are incentivized through TNCs to use, therefore helping TNCs meet the WAV requirements.

==Criticism==
{{See also|Uber protests and legal actions|Sharing economy#Criticism and controversies|Temporary work#Legal issues}}

TNCs increase traffic congestion in some cities, due to the large number of TNC vehicles constantly cruising waiting for customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/sf-blasts-uber-lyft-downtown-traffic-congestion/|title=SF blasts Uber, Lyft for downtown traffic congestion|author=Joe Fitzgerald Rodriguez|date=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyc.streetsblog.org/2017/02/27/its-settled-uber-is-making-nyc-gridlock-worse/|title=It’s Settled: Uber Is Making NYC Gridlock Worse|author=Charles Komanoff|date=Feb 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports based on [[New York City]] data suggest that TNCs are [[unsustainable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/nyregion/uber-ride-hailing-new-york-transportation.html|title=The Downside of Ride-Hailing: More New York City Gridlock|last=Fitzsimmons|first=Emma G.|date=2017-03-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-20|last2=Hu|first2=Winnie|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://schallerconsult.com/rideservices/unsustainable.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The TNC model allows avoiding the costs of insurance, sales tax, mechanical vehicle inspections, and providing a universally-accessible service.

Services like Uber and Lyft, even taking into account trips (as with UberPOOL and Lyft Line) where multiple passengers share the same vehicle, are also worsening traffic congestion. This is because they are attracting to customers who would otherwise have taken transit, walked, biked or avoided the trip, according to a study published in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2018/07/25/a-new-study-says-services-like-uberpool-are-making-traffic-worse/|title=Services like UberPool are making traffic worse, study says|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tulasi Dalam''''' ({{lang-te|తులసిదళం, English : Basil Leaf}}) is a Telugu [[thriller novel]] written by [[Yandamuri Veerendranath]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avkf.org/BookLink/display_titled_book.php?book_id=943&amp;PHPSESSID=1c96a52c0ea9a7572f7488ca7fec70da Tulasidalam at avkf.org]&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in [[Andhra Bhoomi]] weekly in 1980 as a serial and got tremendous popularity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KnPoYxrRfc0C&amp;pg=PA4405&amp;lpg=PA4405&amp;dq=tulasidalam+telugu+novel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y6GBz8nDyY&amp;sig=RVbVkKFsYkFCQ0ZfIVc-yXDPp7s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oB7NTdSnMozrrQfLk-WgDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=tulasidalam%20telugu%20novel&amp;f=false Tulasidalam in The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature, vol. 5, by Mohan Lal, 2006, pp. 4405.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was republished many times as a paperback and sold approximately 50,000 copies.  It was one of the initial novels of Yandamuri that became popular and he was appreciated widely for his narrating style. It was partially inspired by the 1971 bestselling novel ''[[The Exorcist (novel)|The Exorcist]]''. ''Tulasi Dalam'' was first adapted into a 1985 Kannada movie titled ''Thulasidala'' 
and later in Hindi as ''[[Phoonk]]'' (2008) and in Telugu as ''[[Raksha (2008 film)|Raksha]]'' (2008).

==Plot==
Sridher was a self made millionaire, working as one of the directors of a multi national company. He was happily married to Sharada and lives in a peaceful neighborhood of Hyderabad. His younger sister Anita and Sharada's mute brother Narayana Rao stay with them. Approximately eight years after their marriage, Sharada conceives and immediately after that Sridher loses his ability to beget a child after an accident. They name their daughter Tulasi and raise her with utmost affection. When Tulasi was six years old, Sridher saves his employer, Richard's grandchild from a fatal accident. Richard later leaves India and arranges that Tulsi will get twenty lakhs (two million) rupees on her tenth birthday. His will says that if she dies before that, money would go to an orphanage run by Chidananda Swami.

Sridher's company plans to send him along with his family to Paris to help their business there and Sridher happily agrees. Minutes before their departure, Tulasi suddenly becomes ill, postponing their journey. Later that night, she starts to show strange symptoms, indefinitely postponing their tour. It all happens when she was about to turn ten in two months. She shows varying symptoms everyday, puzzling experienced physicians. Their family members resort to various conventional and non conventional methods to save her while doctors are attempting their best. Finally, Sharada turns to a famous hypnotist Jayadev whereas Sridher turns to Santhaan Fakir, a paranormal expert. They both try their best to save Tulasi whereas Anita decides to go in a completely different way. In the climax Sridher goes to Odissa along with his engineer Brahmin and his lawyer Vidyapathi to stop evil Kadra, while Sharada and Jayadev stay with her to protect her from receiving evil hypnotic signals. Climax deals with whether they succeeded in saving Tulasi and by what means they save her.

== Reception ==
Tulasi Dalam gained wide popularity and acclaim when it was published as a weekly serial. It helped Yandamuri to establish himself as a professional writer. Though many critics panned it saying that it was helping to re-popularize the forgotten superstitions regarding witchcraft, it remained as one of the best selling novels in Telugu literature.

==Films==

''Tulasi Dalam'' was first adapted into a 1985 Kannada movie titled ''Thulasidala'' directed by Vemagal Jagannath Rao.
Later it was adapted into the [[Hindi film]] ''[[Phoonk]]'' (2008) and the [[Telugu film]] ''[[Raksha (2008 film)|Raksha]]'' (2008).

==Television series==
Tulasi Dalam was made into a soap in 1996, aired in ETV. It was directed by Yandamuri and was not as successful as the novel.

== Sequel ==
It was followed by sequel Tulasi which starts after ten years of the initial events.

'''Vocabulary development''' is a process by which people acquire words. Babbling shifts towards meaningful speech as infants grow and produce their first words around the age of one year. In early word learning, infants build their vocabulary slowly. By the age of 18 months, infants can typically produce about 50 words and begin to make word combinations.

In order to build their vocabularies, infants must learn about the [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]] that words carry. The mapping problem asks how infants correctly learn to attach words to [[referent]]s. Constraints theories, [[Domain-general learning|domain-general]] views, social-[[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] accounts, and an [[Emergentism|emergentist]] coalition model have been proposed to account for the mapping problem...

From an early age, infants use language to [[Communication|communicate]]. [[Caregiver]]s and other family members use language to teach children how to act in society. In their interactions with peers, children have the opportunity to learn about unique conversational roles. Through pragmatic directions, adults often offer children cues for understanding the meaning of words.

Throughout their school years, children continue to build their vocabulary. In particular, children begin to learn abstract words. Beginning around age 3–5, word learning takes place both in conversation and through reading. Word learning often involves physical context, builds on prior knowledge, takes place in social context, and includes semantic support. The [[phonological loop]] and [[Serial-order learning|serial order]] short-term memory may both play an important role in vocabulary development.

[[File:Az girl reading a book. e-citizen.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Reading is an important means through which children develop their vocabulary.]]

==Early word learning==
Infants begin to understand words such as "Mommy", "Daddy", "hands" and "feet" when they are approximately 6 months old.{{sfn|Tincoff|Jusczyk|1999}}{{sfn|Tincoff|Jusczyk,2012}} Initially, these words refer to their own mother or father or hands or feet. Infants begin to produce their first words when they are approximately one year old.{{sfn|Hoff|2005}}{{sfn|Hulit|Howard|2002}} Infants' first words are normally used in reference to things that are of importance to them, such as objects, body parts, people, and relevant actions. Also, the first words that infants produce are mostly single-syllabic or repeated single [[syllables]], such as "no" and "dada".{{sfn|Hulit|Howard|2002}} By 12 to 18 months of age, children's vocabularies often contain words such as "kitty", "bottle", "doll", "car" and "eye". Children's understanding of names for objects and people usually precedes their understanding of words that describe actions and relationships. "One" and "two" are the first number words that children learn between the ages of one and two.{{sfn|Barner|Zapf|Lui|2012}} Infants must be able to hear and play with sounds in their environment, and to break up various phonetic units to discover words and their related meanings.

===Phonological development===
{{main|Phonological development}}
Studies related to vocabulary development show that children's language competence depends upon their ability to hear [[sounds]] during infancy.{{sfn|Hoff|2005}}{{sfn|Pinker|1994}}{{sfn|Waxman|Booth|2000}} Infants' perception of speech is distinct. Between six and ten months of age, infants can discriminate sounds used in the languages of the world.{{sfn|Hoff|2005}} By 10 to 12 months, infants can no longer discriminate between speech sounds that are not used in the language(s) to which they are exposed.{{sfn|Hoff|2005}} Among six-month-old infants, seen articulations (i.e. the mouth movements they observe others make while talking) actually enhance their ability to discriminate sounds, and may also contribute to infants' ability to learn phonemic boundaries.{{sfn|Teinonen|Aslin|Alku|Csibra|2008}} Infants' phonological register is completed between the ages of 18 months and 7 years.{{sfn|Hoff|2005}}

Children's phonological development normally proceeds as follows:{{sfn|Hoff|2005}}

'''6–8 weeks''': Cooing appears

'''16 weeks''': Laughter and vocal play appear

'''6–9 months''': Reduplicated (canonical) babbling appears

'''12 months''': First words use a limited sound repertoire

'''18 months''': Phonological processes (deformations of target sounds) become systematic

'''18 months–7 years''': Phonological inventory completion

At each stage mentioned above, children play with sounds and learn methods to help them learn words.{{sfn|Pinker|1994}} There is a relationship between children's prelinguistic phonetic skills and their lexical progress at age two: failure to develop the required phonetic skills in their prelinguistic period results in children's delay in producing words.{{sfn|Keren-Portnoy|Majorano|Vihman|2009}} Environmental influences may affect children's phonological development, such as hearing loss as a result of ear infections.{{sfn|Hoff|2005}} Deaf infants and children with hearing problems due to infections are usually delayed in the beginning of vocal [[babbling]].

===Babbling===
{{main|Babbling}}
[[Babbling]] is an important aspect of vocabulary development in infants, since it appears to help practice producing speech sounds.{{sfn|Fagan|2009}} Babbling begins between five and seven months of age. At this stage, babies start to play with sounds that are not used to express their emotional or physical states, such as sounds of [[consonants]] and [[vowels]].{{sfn|Pinker|1994}} Babies begin to babble in real syllables such as "ba-ba-ba, neh-neh-neh, and dee-dee-dee,"{{sfn|Pinker|1994}} between the ages of seven and eight months; this is known as canonical babbling.{{sfn|Hoff|2005}} Jargon babbling includes strings of such sounds; this type of babbling uses intonation but doesn't convey meaning. The [[phonemes]] and [[syllable|syllabic]] patterns produced by infants begin to be distinctive to particular languages during this period (e.g., increased nasal sounds in French and Japanese babies) though most of their sounds are similar.{{sfn|Hoff|2005}}{{sfn|Pinker|1994}} There is a shift from babbling to the use of words as the infant grows.{{sfn|Vihman|1993}}

===Vocabulary spurt===
As children get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them. By the age of eighteen months, children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 words in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension.{{sfn|Hulit|Howard|2002}}{{sfn|Pinker|1994}} A switch from an early stage of slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth is referred to as the ''vocabulary spurt''.{{sfn|Ganger|Brent|2004}} Young toddlers acquire one to three words per month. A vocabulary spurt often occurs over time as the number of words learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week.{{sfn|Ganger|Brent|2004}} Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, children learn how to combine two words such as ''no bye-bye'' and ''more please''.{{sfn|Hulit|Howard|2002}} Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, using ''and''.{{sfn|Hulit|Howard|2002}} This suggests that there is a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child's first word appears, and when the child is able to form more than two words, and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to whether or not there is a spurt in acquisition of words. In one study of 38 children, only five of the children had an inflection point in their rate of word acquisition as opposed to a quadratic growth.{{sfn|Ganger|Brent|2004}} This study suggests that most children do not have a vocabulary spurt.

==Mapping problem==
In word learning, the mapping problem refers to the question of how infants attach the forms of language to the things that they experience in the world.{{sfn|Bloom|2000|p=22}} There are infinite objects, concepts, and actions in the world that words could be mapped onto.{{sfn|Bloom|2000|p=22}} Many theories have been proposed to account for the way in which the language learner successfully maps words onto the correct objects, concepts, and actions.

While [[Domain specificity|domain-specific]] accounts of word learning argue for innate constraints that limit infants' hypotheses about word meanings,{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=284}} [[Domain-general learning|domain-general]] perspectives argue that word learning can be accounted for by general cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, which are not specific to language.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=143}} Yet other theorists have proposed social [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] accounts, which stress the role of caregivers in guiding infants through the word learning process.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=141}} According to some{{who|date=May 2012}} research, however, children are active participants in their own word learning, although caregivers may still play an important role in this process.{{sfn|Baldwin|1995}}{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=142}} Recently, an [[Emergentism|emergentist]] coalition model has also been proposed to suggest that word learning cannot be fully attributed to a single factor. Instead, a variety of cues, including salient and social cues, may be utilized by infants at different points in their vocabulary development.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=145}}

===Theories of constraints===
Theories of [[Word learning biases|word-learning constraints]] argue for biases or default assumptions that guide the infant through the word learning process. Constraints are outside of the infant's control and are believed to help the infant limit their hypotheses about the meaning of words that they encounter daily.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=284}}{{sfn|Bloom|2000|p=20}} Constraints can be considered domain-specific (unique to language).

Critics{{who|date=May 2012}} argue that theories of constraints focus on how children learn nouns, but ignore other aspects of their word learning.{{sfn|Bloom|Markson|1998}} Although constraints are useful in explaining how children limit possible meanings when learning novel words, the same constraints would eventually need to be overridden because they are not utilized in adult language.{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=53}} For instance, adult speakers often use several terms, each term meaning something slightly different, when referring to one entity, such as a family pet. This practice would violate the [[Mutual exclusivity (psychology)|mutual exclusivity]] constraint.{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=53}}

Below, the most prominent constraints in the literature are detailed:
* '''[[Reference]]''' is the notion that a word symbolizes or stands in for an object, action, or event.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=139}} Words consistently stand for their [[referent]]s, even if referents are not physically present in context.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=139}}
* '''Mutual Exclusivity''' is the assumption that each object in the world can only be referred to by a single label.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=284}}{{sfn|Merriman|Bowman|MacWhinney|1989|p=3}}
* '''Shape''' has been considered to be one of the most critical properties for identifying members of an object category.{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=45}} Infants assume that objects that have the same shape also share a name.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=52}} Shape plays an important role in both appropriate and inappropriate extensions.{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=45}}
* '''The Whole Object Assumption''' is the belief that labels refer to whole objects instead of parts or properties of those objects.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=284}}{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=50}} Children are believed to hold this assumption because they typically label whole objects first, and parts of properties of objects later in development.{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=50}}
* '''The [[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomic]] Assumption''' reflects the belief that speakers use words to refer to categories that are internally consistent.{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=52}} Labels to pick out coherent categories of objects, rather than those objects and the things that are related to them.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=284}}{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=52}} For example, children assume that the word "dog" refers to the category of "dogs", not to "dogs with bones", or "dogs chasing cats".{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=52}}

===Domain-general views===
[[Domain-general learning|Domain-general]] views of vocabulary development argue that children do not need principles or constraints in order to successfully develop word-world mappings.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=143}} Instead, word learning can be accounted for through general learning mechanisms such as [[Salience (language)|salience]], association, and frequency.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=143}} Children are thought to notice the objects, actions, or events that are most [[Salience (language)|salient]] in context, and then to associate them with the words that are most frequently used in their presence.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=143}} Additionally, research on word learning suggests that [[fast mapping]], the rapid learning that children display after a single exposure to new information, is not specific to word learning. Children can also successfully fast map when exposed to a novel fact, remembering both words and facts after a time delay.{{sfn|Bloom|Markson|1998}}

Domain-general views have been criticized for not fully explaining how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=144}} For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects?{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=144}} However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. Rather, they suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone to thinking about our environment in terms of whole objects, and this strategy is not specific to the language domain.{{sfn|Bloom|Markson|1998}} Additionally, children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=55}} Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=55}}

===Social pragmatic theories===
Social [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] theories, also in contrast to the constraints view, focus on the [[social context]] in which the infant is embedded.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=141}} According to this approach, environmental input removes the ambiguity of the word learning situation.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=141}} Cues such as the caregiver's gaze, body language, gesture, and smile help infants to understand the meanings of words.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=141}} Social pragmatic theories stress the role of the caregiver in talking about objects, actions, or events that the infant is already focused-in upon.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=141}}

[[Joint attention]] is an important mechanism through which children learn to map words-to-world, and vice versa.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=285}} Adults commonly make an attempt to establish joint attention with a child before they convey something to the child. Joint attention is often accompanied by physical co-presence, since children are often focused on what is in their immediate environment.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=285}} As well, conversational co-presence is likely to occur; the caregiver and child typically talk together about whatever is taking place at their locus of joint attention.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=285}} Social pragmatic perspectives often present children as covariation detectors, who simply associate the words that they hear with whatever they are attending to in the world at the same time.{{sfn|Sabbagh|Baldwin|2005}} The co-variation detection model of joint attention seems problematic when we consider that many caregiver utterances do not refer to things that occupy the immediate attentional focus of infants. For instance, caregivers among the [[Kaluli people|Kaluli]], a group of indigenous peoples living in New Guinea, rarely provide labels in the context of their [[referent]]s.{{sfn|Sabbagh|Baldwin|2005}} While the covariation detection model emphasizes the caregiver's role in the [[meaning-making]] process, some theorists{{who|date=May 2012}} argue that infants also play an important role in their own word learning, actively avoiding mapping errors.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=142}} When infants are in situations where their own attentional focus differs from that of a speaker, they seek out information about the speaker's focus, and then use that information to establish correct word-[[referent]] mappings.{{sfn|Baldwin|1995}}{{sfn|Sabbagh|Baldwin|2005}} Joint attention can be created through infant agency, in an attempt to gather information about a speaker's intent.{{sfn|Sabbagh|Baldwin|2005}}

From early on, children also assume that language is designed for communication. Infants treat communication as a cooperative process.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=286}} Specifically, infants observe the principles of [[conventionality]] and [[Contrast (linguistics)|contrast]]. According to conventionality, infants believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey, there is a term that everyone in the community would expect to be used.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=286}}{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=64}} According to contrast, infants act according to the notion that differences in form mark differences in meaning.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=286}}{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=64}} Children's attention to conventionality and contrast is demonstrated in their language use, even before the age of 2 years; they direct their early words towards adult targets, repair mispronunciations quickly if possible, ask for words to relate to the world around them, and maintain contrast in their own word use.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=286}}

===Emergentist coalition model===
The [[Emergentism|emergentist]] coalition model suggests that children make use of multiple cues to successfully attach a novel label to a novel object.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=145}} The word learning situation may offer an infant combinations of social, perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic cues. While a range of cues are available from the start of word learning, it may be the case that not all cues are utilized by the infant when they begin the word learning process.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=145}} While younger children may only be able to detect a limited number of cues, older, more experienced word learners may be able to make use of a range of cues. For instance, young children seem to focus primarily on perceptual salience, but older children attend to the gaze of caregivers and use the focus of caregivers to direct their word mapping.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=145}} Therefore, this model argues that principles or cues may be present from the onset of word learning, but the use of a wide range of cues develops over time.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=146}}

Supporters of the emergentist coalition model argue that, as a hybrid, this model moves towards a more holistic explanation of word learning that is not captured by models with a singular focus. For instance, constraints theories typically argue that constraints/principles are available to children from the onset of word learning, but do not explain how children develop into expert speakers who are not limited by constraints.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=159}} Additionally, some argue{{who|date=May 2012}} that domain-general perspectives do not fully address the question of how children sort through numerous potential referents in order to correctly sort out meaning.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=159}} Lastly, social pragmatic theories claim that social encounters guide word learning. Although these theories describe how children become more advanced word learners, they seem to tell us little about children's capacities at the start of word learning.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=159}} According to its proponents, the emergentist coalion model incorporates constraints/principles, but argues for the development and change in these principles over time, while simultaneously taking into consideration social aspects of word learning alongside other cues, such as salience.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=160}}

==Pragmatic development==
Both linguistic and socio-cultural factors affect the rate at which vocabulary develops.{{sfn|Tardif|Fletcher|Liang|Kaciroti|2009}} Children must learn to use their words appropriately and strategically in social situations.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|p=339}} They have flexible and powerful social-cognitive skills that allow them to understand the communicative intentions of others in a wide variety of interactive situations. Children learn new words in communicative situations.{{sfn|Tomasello|2000}} Children rely on [[Pragmatics|pragmatic skills]] to build more extensive vocabularies.{{sfn|Clark|1978}} Some aspects of pragmatic behaviour can predict later [[literacy]] and [[mathematical]] achievement, as children who are pragmatically skilled often function better in school. These children are also generally better liked.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|pp=352–353}}

Children use words differently for objects, spatial relations and actions. Children ages one to three often rely on general purpose [[Deixis|deictic]] words such as "here", "that" or "look" accompanied by a [[gesture]], which is most often pointing, to pick out specific objects.{{sfn|Clark|1978}} Children also stretch already known or partly known words to cover other objects that appear similar to the original. This can result in word ''overextension'' or misuses of words. Word overextension is governed by the perceptual similarities children notice among the different [[reference|referents]]. Misuses of words indirectly provide ways of finding out which meanings children have attached to particular words.{{sfn|Clark|1978}} When children come into contact with [[spatial relations]], they talk about the location of one object with respect to another. They name the object located and use a deictic term, such as ''here'' or "there" for location, or they name both the object located and its location. They can also use a general purpose locative marker, which is a [[Preposition and postposition|preposition]], [[Preposition and postposition|postposition]] or [[suffix]] depending on the language that is linked in some way to the word for location.{{sfn|Clark|1978}} Children's earliest words for actions usually encode both the action and its result. Children use a small number of general purpose [[verb]]s, such as "do" and "make" for a large variety of actions because their resources are limited. Children acquiring a [[second language]] seem to use the same production strategies for talking about actions. Sometimes children use a highly specific verb instead of a general purpose verb. In both cases children stretch their resources to communicate what they want to say.{{sfn|Clark|1978}}

Infants use words to communicate early in life and their [[communication skills]] develop as they grow older. Communication skills aid in word learning. Infants learn to take turns while communicating with adults. While preschoolers lack precise timing and rely on obvious speaker cues, older children are more precise in their timing and take fewer long pauses.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|p=342}} Children get better at initiating and sustaining coherent conversations as they age. Toddlers and preschoolers use strategies such as repeating and recasting their partners' utterances to keep the conversation going. Older children add new relevant information to conversations. Connectives such as ''then'', ''so'', and ''because'' are more frequently used as children get older.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|pp=342–343}} When giving and responding to feedback, preschoolers are inconsistent, but around the age of six, children can mark corrections with phrases and head nods to indicate their continued attention. As children continue to age they provide more constructive interpretations back to listeners, which helps prompt conversations.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|pp=343–345}}

===Pragmatic influences===
[[Caregiver]]s use language to help children become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as [[peekaboo]] to provide children with information about words and [[phrase]]s. Caregivers find many ways to help infants interact and respond. As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|p=348}} Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, and how they can stay on topic. Caregivers may [[Modelling (psychology)|model]] the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|pp=348–349}}

Family members contribute to pragmatic development in different ways. Fathers often act as secondary caregivers, and may know the child less intimately. Older siblings may lack the capacity to acknowledge the child's needs. As a result, both fathers and siblings may pressure children to communicate more clearly. They often challenge children to improve their communication skills, therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics. Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with infants, and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as infants. Siblings are more directive and less responsive to infants, which motivates infants to participate in conversations with their older siblings.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|pp=350–351}} There are limitations to studies that focus on the influences of fathers and siblings, as most research is [[descriptive]] and [[correlation]]al. In reality, there are many variations of family configurations, and context influences parent behaviour more than parent gender does.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|p=351}} The majority of research in this field is conducted with mother/child pairs.

[[Peer group|Peers]] help expose children to multi-party conversations. This allows children to hear a greater variety of speech, and to observe different conversational roles. Peers may be uncooperative conversation partners, which pressures the children to communicate more effectively. Speaking to peers is different from speaking to adults, but children may still correct their peers. Peer interaction provides children with a different experience filled with special humour, disagreements and conversational topics.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|pp=352–353}}

Culture and context in infants’ linguistic environment shape their vocabulary development. English learners have been found to map novel labels to objects more reliably than to actions compared to [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] learners. This early noun bias in English learners is caused by the culturally reinforced tendency for English speaking caregivers to engage in a significant amount of ostensive labelling as well as noun-friendly activities such as picture book reading.{{sfn|Chan et al.|2011}} Adult speech provides children with grammatical input. Both [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Cantonese]] languages have a category of grammatical function word called a noun [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]], which is also common across many genetically unrelated East Asian languages. In Cantonese, classifiers are obligatory and specific in more situations than in Mandarin. This accounts for the research found on Mandarin-speaking children outperforming Cantonese-speaking children in relation to the size of their vocabulary.{{sfn|Tardif|Fletcher|Liang|Kaciroti|2009}}

===Pragmatic directions===
Pragmatic directions provide children with additional information about the speaker's intended meaning. Children's learning of new word meanings is guided by the pragmatic directions that adults offer, such as explicit links to word meanings.{{sfn|Clark|Grossman|1998}} Adults present young children with information about how words are related to each other through connections, such as "is a part of", "is a kind of", "belongs to", or "is used for". These pragmatic directions provide children with essential information about language, allowing them to make inferences about possible meanings for unfamiliar words.{{sfn|Clark|Andrew|2002}} This is also called inclusion. When children are provided with two words related by inclusion, they hold on to that information. When children hear an adult say an incorrect word, and then repair their mistake by stating the correct word, children take into account the repair when assigning meanings to the two words.{{sfn|Clark|Grossman|1998}}

==In school-age children==
[[File:US_Navy_081123-N-7862M-001_Students_from_the_Bahrain_School_share_an_interactive_reading_experience_with_U.S._Naval_Support_Activity_Bahrain_Command_Master_Chief_Randy_Shoe_during.jpg|thumb|Children in school share an interactive reading experience.]]
Vocabulary development during the school years builds upon what the child already knows, and the child uses this knowledge to broaden his or her vocabulary. Once children have gained a level of vocabulary knowledge, new words are learned through explanations using familiar, or "old" words. This is done either explicitly, when a new word is defined using old words, or implicitly, when the word is set in the context of old words so that the meaning of the new word is constrained.{{sfn|Baker|Simmons|Kameenui|1995}} When children reach school-age, context and implicit learning are the most common ways in which their vocabularies continue to develop.{{sfn|Newton|Padak|Rasinski|2008|pp=7–8}} By this time, children learn new vocabulary mostly through conversation and reading.{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|pp=93–110}} Throughout schooling and adulthood, conversation and reading are the main methods in which vocabulary develops.  This growth tends to slow once a person finishes schooling, as they have already acquired the vocabulary used in everyday conversation and reading material and generally are not engaging in activities that require additional vocabulary development.{{sfn|Baker|Simmons|Kameenui|1995}}{{sfn|Anglin|Miller|2000}}

During the first few years of life, children are mastering [[Concrete noun|concrete words]] such as "car", "bottle", "dog", "cat". By age 3, children are likely able to learn these concrete words without the need for a visual reference, so word learning tends to accelerate around this age.{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|p=103}} Once children reach school-age, they learn [[Abstract object|abstract words]] (e.g. "love", "freedom", "success").{{sfn|Nippold|2004|pp=1–8}} This broadens the vocabulary available for children to learn, which helps to account for the increase in word learning evident at school age.{{sfn|McKeown|Curtis|1987|p=7}} By age 5, children tend to have an expressive vocabulary of 2,100–2,200 words. By age 6, they have approximately 2,600 words of expressive vocabulary and 20,000–24,000 words of receptive vocabulary.{{sfn|Lorraine|2008}} Some claim that children experience a sudden acceleration in word learning, upwards of 20 words per day,{{sfn|Anglin|Miller|2000}} but it tends to be much more gradual than this. From age 6 to 8, the average child in school is learning 6–7 words per day, and from age 8 to 12, approximately 12 words per day.{{sfn|Bloom|Markson|1998}}

===Means===
Exposure to [[conversation]]s and engaging in conversation with others help school-age children develop vocabulary. [[Fast mapping]] is the process of learning a new concept upon a single exposure and is used in word learning not only by infants and toddlers, but by preschool children and adults as well.{{sfn|Bloom|Markson|1998}} This principle is very useful for word learning in conversational settings, as words tend not to be explained explicitly in conversation, but may be referred to frequently throughout the span of a conversation.

[[Reading (process)|Reading]] is considered to be a key element of vocabulary development in school-age children.{{sfn|Baker|Simmons|Kameenui|1995}}{{sfn|Lorraine|2008}}{{sfn|Newton|Padak|Rasinski|2008}}{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|p=97}} Before children are able to read on their own, children can learn from others reading to them. Learning vocabulary from these experiences includes using [[Context (language use)|context]], as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story.{{sfn|Nagy|Herman|Anderson|1985}} This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a visual reference or comparisons, usually to prior knowledge and past experiences.{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|pp=101–103}} Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child's repetition of the new word back to the adult.{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|p=101}} When a child begins to learn to read, their print vocabulary and oral vocabulary tend to be the same, as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms. These two forms of vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3. Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language, print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary.{{sfn|Kamil|Hiebert|2005}} By age 10, children's vocabulary development through reading moves away from learning concrete words to learning abstract words.{{sfn|McKeown|Curtis|1987|p=8}}

Generally, both conversation and reading involve at least one of the four principles of context that are used in word learning and vocabulary development: physical context, prior knowledge, social context and semantic support.{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|p=105}}

====Physical context====
Physical context involves the presence of an object or action that is also the topic of conversation. With the use of physical context, the child is exposed to both the words and a visual reference of the word. This is frequently used with infants and toddlers, but can be very beneficial for school-age children, especially when learning rare or infrequently used words.{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|p=97}} Physical context may include props such as in toy play. When engaging in play with an adult, a child's vocabulary is developed through discussion of the toys, such as naming the object (e.g. "dinosaur") or labeling it with the use of a rare word (e.g., ''stegosaurus'').{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|p=105}} These sorts of interactions expose the child to words they may not otherwise encounter in day-to-day conversation.

====Prior knowledge====
Past experiences or [[general knowledge]] is often called upon in conversation, so it is a useful context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references.{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|p=105}} For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word ''elephant'', an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, how big its ears were, its trunk, and the sound it made, then using the word ''elephant'' to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only in conversation, but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.{{sfn|Newton|Padak|Rasinski|2008|pp=xvii}}

====Social context====
[[Social context]] involves pointing out social norms and violations of these norms.{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|p=106}} This form of context is most commonly found in conversation, as opposed to reading or other word learning environments. A child's understanding of social norms can help them to infer the meaning of words that occur in conversation. In an English-speaking tradition, "please" and "thank you" are taught to children at a very early age, so they are very familiar to the child by school-age. For example, if a group of people is eating a meal with the child present and one person says, "give me the bread" and another responds with, "that was rude. What do you say?", and the person responds with "please", the child may not know the meaning of "rude", but can infer its meaning through social context and understanding the necessity of saying "please".{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|p=106}}

====Semantic support====
[[Semantics|Semantic]] support is the most obvious method of vocabulary development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information of the meaning of a word.{{sfn|Newton|Padak|Rasinski|2008}}{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|pp=107}} By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra for the first time and ask, ''what is that?'' and the parent might respond, ''that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it''.{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|pp=107}}

===Pictures support===
Pictures support involves two memory techniques – association and visualization. Associating an image with a word helps a user learn word in a more effective way. Anshul Agarwal, Founder of dailyvocab.com mentioned in his interview to Career360 – "memory aid for each word help student learn words more faster and effectively".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.language.careers360.com/articles/dailyvocab-easy-way-learn-english | title=DailyVocab: Easy way to learn English | date=March 11, 2014 | accessdate=August 20, 2016 | author=Nimesh Chandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memory===
Memory plays an important role in vocabulary development, however the exact role that it plays is disputed in the literature. Specifically, [[short-term memory]] and how its capacities work with vocabulary development is questioned by many researchers{{who|date=May 2012}}.

The [[phonology]] of words has proven to be beneficial to vocabulary development when children begin school. Once children have developed a vocabulary, they utilize the sounds that they already know to learn new words.{{sfn|Gathercole|Willis|Emslie|Baddeley|1992}} The [[phonological loop]] encodes, maintains and manipulates speech-based information that a person encounters. This information is then stored in the phonological memory, a part of short term memory. Research shows that children's capacities in the area of phonological memory are linked to vocabulary knowledge when children first begin school at age 4–5 years old. As memory capabilities tend to increase with age (between age 4 and adolescence), so does an individual's ability to learn more complex vocabulary.{{sfn|Gathercole|Willis|Emslie|Baddeley|1992}}

[[Serial-order learning|Serial-order]] short-term memory may be critical to the development of vocabulary.{{sfn|Leclercq|Majerus|2010}} As [[Lexicon|lexical knowledge]] increases, phonological representations have to become more precise to determine the differences between similar sound words (i.e. "calm", "come"). In this theory, the specific order or sequence of phonological events is used to learn new words, rather than phonology as a whole.{{sfn|Leclercq|Majerus|2010}}
