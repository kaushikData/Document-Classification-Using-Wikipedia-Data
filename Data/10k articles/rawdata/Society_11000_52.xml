The '''Abui''' are an indigenous ethnic group (also known as '''Barawahing''', '''Barue''' or '''Namatalaki''') residing on [[Alor Island]], [[East Nusa Tenggara]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="Hidayah"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hidayah, Zulyani|title=Ensiklopedi Suku Bangsa di Indonesia|year=2015|publisher=Yayasan Pustaka Obor Indonesia|isbn=978-979-461-929-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/10138/ID |title=Abui, Barue in Indonesia |publisher=[[Joshua Project]] |accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abui people are spread across the districts of South Alor, East Alor, and Northwest Alor in [[Alor Regency]].&lt;ref name="Hidayah"/&gt; Abui people speak the [[Abui language]], as well as [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], and a Malay-based creole, [[Malay trade and creole languages#Alor Malay|Alor Malay]].

== Etymology ==
The term ''Abui'' is an Abui word that means ‘mountains’ or alternatively ‘enclosed place’.

Abui people refer to themselves as ''Abui loku ‘the mountain people’.&lt;ref name="Kratochvíl"&gt;{{cite book|title=A grammar of Abui: a Papuan language of Alor, Part 1|publisher=LOT|year=2007|isbn=90-783-2828-2|page=3|author=František Kratochvíl}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' The bare term ''Abui'' is often associated with the large mountain range in central Alor, ''Abui foka,'' and is often contrasted to the smaller mountain range in the Kabola/Adang speaking area ''Abui kiding'' in the bird's head of Alor. The language is referred to as ''Abui tanga'' in the Takalelang variety (the most well-studied variety) and ''Abui laral'' in the Welai, Mola, and Mainang varieties. The glossonym ''Abui'' was first introduced by Cora Du Bois in the late 1930s after the ethnonym was already in circulation.

This ethnonym is also used in Alor Malay/Indonesian to refer to Abui speakers.

The term ''Barawahing'' is a derogatory [[exonym]] meaning 'black, smelly, smoky.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ausil.org.au/sites/ausil/files/1997%20Grimes%20etal%20Nusa%20Teng%20Guide.pdf|title=A guide to the people and languages of Nusa Tenggara|last=Grimes|first=Charles|publisher=Artha Wacana Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Kupang|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Origins ===
According to Abui oral tradition, Abui people settled in Alor in ancient times and did not find other settlers there. Later some of them moved to the Kabola peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Djeki, J.J. 1986. Penelitian suku terasing di Kabupaten Alor Abui. Proyek inventarisasi dan dokumentasi kebudayaan daerah Nusa Tenggara Timur. Kupang.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicolspeyer"&gt;Nicolspeyer, Martha Margaretha. 1940. De sociale structuur van een Aloreesche bevolkingsgroep. Rijswijk: Kramers.&lt;/ref&gt; The same tradition accounts that they dwelled in caves in the mountains in the Mainang area. In this area also some rock art is found. Abui refer to neighbouring tribes as ‘younger siblings’ or as ‘new arrivals’. However, the oral tradition in Alor serves too often as a political instrument. The oral tradition has not been verified by archaeological research yet.

=== Ethnography ===
The American anthropologist [[Cora Du Bois]] studied and lived among Abui people from 1937-1939 in the village of Atimelang, resulting in the publication, ''The  People of Alor.''&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois, Cora Alice. 1960. The people of Alor; a social-psychological study of an East Indian island. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, the Dutch sociologist Martha Margaretha Nicolspeyer published a study of the Abui social structure.&lt;ref name="Nicolspeyer"/&gt;

== Culture ==
[[File:US Navy 050325-N-6665R-055 An Indonesian man from one of the villages of Alor, Indonesia, plays an instrument during their ceremonial song and dance.jpg|thumb|right|A man playing the [[gong]] for a ceremonial song and dance as an appreciation to the United States Navy for providing humanitarian assistance and medical aid to the locals affected by the November 2004 earthquake that struck [[Alor Island]].]]
Abui people from Takpala village engage in a traditional dance known as ''lego-lego'', in which dancers move in a circular pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/6696642/Suku_Alor |title=Suku Alor: Masyarakat Alor Di Nusa Tenggara |author=Azis Anwar Hidayat |publisher=Academia |accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gongs and [[Moko drum|mokos]] are also beaten.&lt;ref name="Kompas_2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Asdhiana|first1=I Made|title=Saat Abui Menyiapkan Masa Depan|url=http://travel.kompas.com/read/2013/09/25/0957056/Saat.Abui.Menyiapkan.Masa.Depan|publisher=Kompas.com|date=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The original religion of the inhabitants of [[Alor Islands]] was animistic until much later when [[Protestant]] missionaries arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Ward|title=Indonesian traditional poetry|year=1975|publisher=Oleander Press|isbn=978-090-267-549-0|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Majority of the [[Alor Island]] communities are Christians, except for those living along the coast line tend to be Muslims as most of the Muslims living there migrated from other islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Levinson|title=Encyclopedia of world cultures|year=1993|publisher=G.K. Hall|isbn=08-168-8840-X|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abui people generally are predominantly Protestant. However, their beliefs have animistic influences as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contemporarynomad.com/2012/02/the-abui-tribe-in-takpala/|title=The Abui Tribe in Takpala|date=22 February 2012|publisher=Contemporary Nomad|author=Tony|accessdate=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic communities are found in [[Kalabahi]] and particularly among the Abui people in Takalelang and Mainang.&lt;ref name="Kratochvíl" /&gt;

== Economy ==
=== Agriculture ===
Abui speakers are mainly farmers, just like other inhabitants of [[Alor Island|Alor]]. However, in mountainous areas hunting and gathering is also an important supplement to the staple diet of [[maize|corn]], [[cassava]], and [[rice]]. In the coastal areas, which are less favourable for agriculture, many farmers have switched to fishing, the traditional activity of the Austronesian population. Traditional livestock are pigs and chicken. However, livestock seldom supplement the diet due to frequent swine fever and poultry diseases. Thus, the diet is not well balanced, often resulting in poor health conditions and [[anaemia]], especially among children and women. In the mountainous areas the situation is better as traditional hunting provides a more balanced diet. The mountains also favour a number of important cash crops such as [[tamarind]], [[coconuts]], [[coffee]], [[cloves]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[cashew nuts]], [[candlenut]]s (Aleurites moluccana), [[vanilla]], almonds ([[Canarium]]) and [[tobacco]]. These provide the farmers with additional income, which results in generally better living standards than for people in the coastal areas.&lt;ref name="Kratochvíl"/&gt;

=== Tourism ===
[[File:Abui Lego-lego.jpg|thumb|The Takpala community performs a ''lego-lego'' dance for tourists.]]
The Abui "traditional village of Takpala" (''kampung tradisional Takpala'') is a tourist destination consisting of a small cluster of traditional houses on a hillside. Visitors watch performances, pose for photographs in traditional attire, and buy handicrafts.&lt;ref name="Kompas_2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bere|first1=Sigiranus Marutho|title=Pesona Kampung Tradisional {{sic|hide=y}} Suku Abui di NTT|url=http://travel.kompas.com/read/2016/04/22/132500027/Pesona.Kampung.Tradisional.Suku.Abui.di.NTT|date=22 April 2016|publisher=Kompas.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, the Takpala Village won second place for most traditional village at the national level.&lt;ref name="JKAMDDT"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jika ke Alor, Mampirlah di Desa Takpala|url=https://travel.kompas.com/read/2013/01/11/14511450/Jika.ke.Alor.Mampirlah.di.Desa.Takpala|date=11 January 2013|publisher=Kompas|editor=I Made Asdhiana}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many Western researchers who would visit the village in order to study the culture, lifestyle and language of the Abui people.&lt;ref name="Kompas_2016"/&gt; Ever since then, Takpala Village is considered a cultural heritage area by the [[Alor Regency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peraturan Daerah Kabupaten ALor Nomor 2 Tahun 2013 Tentang Rencana Tata Ruang Wilayah Kabupaten Alor Tahun 2013–2033|url=http://peraturan.go.id/inc/view/11e6c827d08b61c0b0d7313632303030.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a tourist destination.&lt;ref name="JKAMDDT"/&gt;

Aside from cultural tourism, [[Alor Island]] is also known as a world class diving location. To date, there are 42 registered diving sites in [[Alor Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kupang.tribunnews.com/2017/03/30/alor-tak-hanya-untuk-diving-masih-ada-enam-wisata-yang-bisa-dikunjungi |title=Alor Tak Hanya untuk "Diving", Masih Ada Enam Wisata yang Bisa Dikunjungi |editor=Rosalina Woso |publisher=Pos Kupang |date=30 March 2017 |accessdate=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Educational facilities in the Abui area are limited to elementary and secondary schools in district capitals. The nearest university is in [[Kalabahi]], which offers limited training in economy, law, English and computer science. The more significant educational institutions are found in [[Kupang]], the provincial capital of [[East Nusa Tenggara]].

One of his alleged victims also hacked off his penis. This lynching occurred in the [[Nagpur]] district court,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/publications/police/killing_justice_vigilantism_in_nagpur1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; on the marble floor of the courtroom. The women who killed him claimed that Yadav had been raping and abusing local women with impunity for over a decade, and that the local police had refused to help his victims or pursue charges as Yadav was allegedly bribing them. Yadav had also reportedly murdered at least three people and dumped their bodies on the railroad tracks. The lynching reportedly occurred when Yadav spotted a woman he had raped and called her a prostitute, enraging the crowd.

In 2012, Akku Yadav's nephew, Amar Yadav was stabbed to death following similar circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/Teens-stab-to-death-Akku-Yadavs-nephew/articleshow/26925999.cms|title=Teens stab to death Akku Yadav's nephew - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five women were immediately arrested but released following demonstrations in the city. Every woman living in the local slum has claimed responsibility for the lynching. Usha Narayane, a local activist, was arrested and charged with murder, as were other women. In 2012, Narayane was released from custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prezi.com/dbug9bmeyhkt/usha-narayane/|title=Usha Narayane|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 21 other people, including six women, were also arrested and released due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/in-lynching-of-alleged-rapist-in-nagpur-court-in-2004-all-accused-let-off-691479|title=In Lynching of Alleged Rapist in Nagpur Court in 2004, All Accused Let Off|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ArduSat''' is an [[Arduino]] based Nanosatellite, based on the [[CubeSat]] standard. It contains a set of Arduino boards and sensors. The general public will be allowed to use these Arduinos and sensors for their own creative purposes while they are in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Evan|first=Ackerman|title=ArduSat: a real satellite mission that you can be a part of|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/06/15/kickstart-your-way-to-an-experiment-on-a-satellite/|accessdate=2012-06-15|newspaper=DVICE|date=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ArduSat is created by Nanosatisfi LLC, an aerospace company which in the word of [[Phil Plait]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plait|first=Phil|title=KickStart your way to an experiment in space|publisher=Discover Magazine|url=http://dvice.com/archives/2012/06/ardusat-a-real.php|accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  has "the goal to democratize access to space" and was founded by 4 graduate students from the [[International Space University]] in 2012.

ArduSat is the first satellite which will provide such open access to the general public to space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AMSAT |title=ArduSat Arduino CubeSat |url=http://www.uk.amsat.org/8284 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130224140021/http://www.uk.amsat.org/8284 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-24 |publisher=AMSAT UK |accessdate=2012-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Armenian Australians''' refers to [[Australians]] of [[Armenia]]n national background or descent. They have become one of the key [[Armenian diaspora]]s around the world and among the largest in the [[English-speaking world]]. 

While the Armenian community in Australia is among the youngest of all diasporas, Australia's economic prosperity over the past decade has attracted a large number of skilled Armenian migrants. The official relationship between [[Australia]] and [[Armenia]] started on 26 December 1991, and diplomatic relations were established on 15 January 1992.&lt;ref name="dfat.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dfat.gov.au/geo/armenia/pages/armenia-country-brief.aspx|title=Armenia country brief|work=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade|date=July 2015|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The influx of Armenians into Australia has come from many different Diaspora countries; these countries include Armenia, Egypt, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Turkey and India.&lt;ref name="dfat.gov.au"/&gt;

Today the Austral-Armenian community includes members born in up to and over 43 different countries. The main concentration of Armenians in Sydney are in the City of Ryde (12,000 - 15,000) followed by City of Willoughby&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Julito Briones |url=http://home.people.net.au/~jbriones/aposydney/sydney_metro.htm |title=A report about Sydney |publisher=Home.people.net.au |date=21 May 2007 |accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and City of Warringah. Smaller communities exist in Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth. Australians of Armenian heritage are well known in Sydney and now hold an annual festival in the CBD each year which attracts over 25,000 visitors and is the second largest cultural festival behind the Greek festival.{{cn|date=April 2018}}{{Peacock term|date=April 2018}}

Increasingly, Australians of Armenian descent are being recognized for their success in Politics, Banking, Finance and Law. 

==Organisations==
All traditional Armenian diaspora parties have established in the country:
* [[Social Democratic Hunchakian Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunchak.org.au/|title=Social Democrat Hunchakian Party - Australian Leadership|work=hunchak.org.au|date=|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Armenian Democratic Liberal Party]]
* [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]]

There are also many associated political groupings like:

[[image:Atalburu Mendiburua.jpg|thumb|250px|''Saubat de Arraidou et Maria de Hiriart 1743''&lt;br /&gt;Atalburu in [[Lower Navarre]] with a [[lauburu]] and founders' names]]
[[image:Atalburu Mandoz.jpg|thumb|250px|''Iesus Maria Ioseph hilçiaz orhoitg-ziten Io(a)nnes de Urtiaga, Martin d'Errecalde et Maria d'Errecalde, 1727'' (the first half translating as "In memory of [[Holy Family|JMJ]]'s death")]]

'''Atalburu''' (from Basque ''atari'' 'doorway' ''buru'' 'head') is the name given to the [[lintel]] above the main entrance of traditional [[baserri|Basque houses]].

It was usual for each new house, particularly in the province of [[Lower Navarre]], to engrave on these stones:
* the year of construction,
* the name of spouses,
* religious symbols, as a cross,
* other traditional motives, as a [[lauburu]] or simply its constitutive [[comma]]s, [[dove]]s symbol of fidelity, stylized [[plant]]s symbol of [[prosperity]], [[rosette (design)|rosettes]] of [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] leaves, symbol of immortality or various others as sun, stars...
* working tools

The text may have religious references, for example:
* ''Au nom du Père et du Fils et du St Esprit m'a fait bâtir l'an 1806'' ('In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Gost, (one) made me build in year 1806')...

Traditionally, all Basque houses have a name, but this was seldom written on the ''atalarri'' and more commonly found on the ''[[Baserri#Significance|armarria]]''. On modern houses, the house name is frequently engraved on a stele near the door. Once a house is named, the name is virtually never changed.

==History==

=== Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms era ===

In the first era of Hindu-Buddhist in Indonesia, Banyumasan region divided into [[Tarumanagara Kingdom]]'s influence in the west and [[Kalingga Kingdom]]'s influence in the east with Cipamali river or "''Kali Brebes''" as natural borders. The other Hindu-Buddhist Kingdoms that influenced this region is [[Galuh Kingdom]], [[Medang Kingdom]], [[Kediri Kingdom]], [[Singhasari|Singhasari Kingdom]] and [[Majapahit|Majapahit Empire]]. After the decline of Majapahit, Banyumasan region become part of [[Demak Sultanate]].

=== End of Demak Sultanate until rise of Mataram ===

In Demak Sultanate era (1478–1546), Banyumasan region divided into several ''Kadipaten'', which is Pasirluhur with its ''Adipati'' (Duke) Banyak Belanak, also Kadipaten Wirasaba with its Adipati Wargo Utomo I.
Due to the territories extent of Demak Sultanate that make Sultan Trenggono (Third Sultan of Demak) consider that a strong military was needed, for that he divided Demak territories militarity into the area of military command. For Western region, Sultan Trenggono choose Adipati Banyak Belanak as a western territory military commander which includes region of Kerawang to Sumbing mountain (Wonosobo). As a military commander of Demak Sultanate, Adipati Pasirluhur was given a title ''Pangeran Senopati Mangkubumi I'' while his younger brother named Wirakencana became a ''Patih'' (General).

After the death of Sultan Trenggono, Demak Sultanate split into 3 sections,one of them is Pajang that ruled by Joko Tingkir with his title ''Sultan Adiwijaya'' (1546–1587). In this era, most of Banyumasan region become part of Pajang territory.

Following his predecessor's rule, Sultan Adiwijaya also choose Adipati Pasirluhur which at that time  being held by Wirakencana, became Senopati Pajang  with the title Pangeran Mangkubumi II. Meanwhile, the Adipati of Kadipaten Wirasaba, Wargo Utomo I died and one of his sons named R. Joko Kaiman was chosen by Sultan Adiwijaya became Adipati of Wirasaba with the title ''Wargo Utomo II'', he became 7th Adipati of Wirasaba.

At the end of Pajang Kingdom's golden era and rise of Mataram Kingdom (1587), Adipati Wargo Utomo II gives his territory of Kadipaten Wirasaba to his brothers, meanwhile he himself created a new Kadipaten and named it Kadipaten Banyumas then he became first Adipati with the title ''Adipati Marapat''.

And then, this Kadipaten of Banyumas growing rapidly, even after the center of this Kadipaten were transferred to Sudagaran - Banyumas, due to its influences, other Kadipatens became smaller. Along with the growing of Mataram Sultanate, Many Kadipatens in Banyumasan became under Mataram rule.

Mataram rule over Kadipatens in Banyumasan region didn't automatically annexed Banyumasan region into "inner circle" of Mataram power which makes Kadipatens in Banyumasan region still have autonomy and Mataram people also considered Banyumasan region as ''Måncånêgårå Kulòn'' region, and the people are often called ''Wòng (m)Banyumasan''.

== Social Structure ==
Banyumasan social structure have their own unique that which differs with the other [[Javanese people|Javanese]] because they had neighboring [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] (Priangan Timur) influence, even its root was still [[Javanese culture]]. This also related with the people's characteristic which was very egalitarian that do not recognized the term ''ningrat'' or ''priyayi''. This was also reflected by their language [[Banyumasan dialect|Banyumasan language]] that did not recognised register social status. The use of ''high'' language (Krama) essentially was loanwords due to their intensive interraction with other [[Javanese people]] (wetanan) in order to appreciate the outer culture. Honorifying to the older person commonly to be shown by good attitude, affection and manner.
&lt;!-- This can't be denied that feodalism influence could be fell but its not the original characteristic of Banyumasan peoples. --&gt;

Besides egalitarian, Banyumasan people also recognised by their honest and forthright characteristic which often called [[Cablaka / Blakasuta]].

== Language ==

He attended [[Rutgers College]], [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] from 1968 to 1970 and from 1972 to 1974 when he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] degree. At Rutgers College Lawless studied with Bob Cook, [[Livingston College]] and [[Mel Edwards]] at Rutgers.

Between the years of 1970 and 1972 Lawless actively fought against the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} He was involved in litigation with his [[Conscription in the United States|local draft board]]. Board officials arbitrarily removed his student status and made him available to the draft, so he claimed [[conscientious objector]] status.&lt;ref&gt;Matt

Post Induction C.O. wins Lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court
The Buffalo News&lt;/ref&gt; Lawless litigated and won a decision in [[New York State Supreme Court]].

After his student status was restored he enrolled at the [[University of Notre Dame]], South Bend, Indiana and studied with Kostantin Milonadis, a Distinguished Professor and Artist-in-Residence at the university. Lawless committed himself to working with [[steel]] and the idea of combining it with as many different materials as possible (in particular at that time, [[stained glass]]).

From 1980 to 1982 Lawless attended [[SUNY at Buffalo]] studying with [[Duayne Hatchett]] and George Smith. In June 1982 he received his [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] degree from SUNYAB. Unrelated to the pursuit of his graduate degree Lawless built and installed ''Cock-a-doodle-doo'' at the State University College of Buffalo ([[Buffalo State College]]) directly across the street from the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]] with a dedication in May 1982.

In 1984 Lawless created the sculpture titled [[Green Lightning (sculpture)|Green Lightning]] which was placed in the Midtown Corridor of Buffalo, New York.
&lt;ref&gt;Matt Grytta, 8 July 1984, Sculptor Starts Installation in Midtown Corridor, The Buffalo News&lt;/ref&gt; The installation created controversy since part of the imagery employed [[neon lighting]] and was visible only after dark.[[File:Green light3.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Green Lightning Night]]Some city officials found the work to be offensive, and Mayor [[James D. Griffin]] ordered it removed on 20 November, 5 days later.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Grytta, 20 November 1984, Mayor Orders Sculpture Removed, The Buffalo News&lt;/ref&gt; The Mayor hired a salvage company to cut it apart at night, but before the demolition was complete, Supreme Court Justice Vincent Doyle issued an injunction halting the demolition.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Grytta,22 November 1984, Judge Rips Griffin, Bars Sculpture Razing, The Buffalo News&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 Lawless married Svetlana Schreiber, an [[immigration]] attorney, in Cleveland, Ohio and originally of [[Sighetu Marmaţiei]], Romania. He has two stepsons who reside in [[New York City]].

=== Green Lightning ===
[[File:Green light0.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Green Lightning]]
'''[[Green Lightning (sculpture)|Green Lightning]]''' was originally conceived as a project at Artpark, Lewiston, New York for the 1983 season. It was subsequently erected in Buffalo, New York in 1984 and heavily damaged a week after its unveiling by the City of Buffalo and City of Buffalo Arts Commission (Director, David More.) Its total destruction was prevented when Lawless drove down to where the sculpture had been unveiled and climbed atop the 30-foot structure in an attempt to prevent workers from cutting it down.&lt;ref name="Geen Lightning interview"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.buffalonews.com/life-arts/where-are-they-now-looking-up-billie-lawless-jim-lorentz-semyon-bychkov-and-more-20140323 | title=Where are they now? Looking up Billie Lawless, Jim Lorentz, Semyon Bychkov and more | publisher=The Buffalo News | date=23 March 2014 | accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later obtained a court order halting the destruction which had begun by the City under the cloak of darkness well after the Courts had closed. Lawless was one of eight artists accepted to exhibit at Sculpture Chicago '85 in the Spring of 1985. The jurors, Howard Fox of the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], Mary Jane Jacobs of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago]], IL and John Chandler, Director of Supervision, Art Consultancy and Management, Boston, MA, selected Lawless' [[Green Lightning (sculpture)|Green Lightning]] which was subsequently installed at Harrison and Wells Streets in the South Loop. It stood for five years with no controversy.

In 1992 a jury in the New York State Supreme Court ruled that the Mayor of the City of Buffalo [[James D. Griffin]] and the City of Buffalo Urban Renewal Agency had violated Lawless' civil rights with its unauthorized actions in 1984.

In the Spring of 1993 Green Lightning was accepted into an exhibition to be held at the Manhattan Psychiatric Center in New York, New York. The exhibition was sponsored by the Association of Independent Artists and curated by John Rosis and Glenn Reed (See prospectus for this exhibition). When the Director of the Center (Michael Ford) voiced his objections to the sculpture both curators (artists living in New York City) attempted to pressure Lawless into submitting another piece. Lawless refused and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] initiated litigation.

Justice Ira Gammerman of the New York State Supreme Court ruled that the Manhattan Psychiatric Center did have to exhibit the piece but that it was not required to give Lawless the site which he had requested. The Center offered a piece of land which was not large enough to hold the sculpture which effectively precluded Lawless from exhibiting the piece. No artists from the exhibition voiced any support for Lawless.

Years later in a 2014 interview, when Lawless was asked if he would bring the Green Lightning sculpture back to Buffalo, he replied "Any time".&lt;ref name="Geen Lightning interview" /&gt;

=== Didy Wah Didy ===
[[File:Didy wah0.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Didy Wah Didy]]
'''[https://web.archive.org/web/20081211170714/http://www.didywahdidy.com/ Didy Wah Didy]''' is named for the last stop on a mythical railroad bound for [[hell]] (Black Southern [[American folklore]].) With simple imagery and few words the piece is a timed [[neon]] sequence that shows a mushroom cloud forming (animated) over a boy's head. With the words "Atomic Playground Ahead" and "Kids Ride the Big One!" it is a piercing send-up of typical American roadside attractions. In three of the four corners, constantly flashing are the words "chills," "spills" and "thrills." When the "kid", who starts out smiling, then becomes alarmed, is finally "[[Nuclear weapon|nuked]]," "[[death]]" with an alternating [[skull and crossbones (poison)|skull and crossbones]] flashes in the lower right hand corner. The three flashing words are surrounded by the icons common in Lawless' work, [[thunderbolt]]s, [[dollar sign]]s and [[Star (glyph)|stars]]. The display takes about 60 seconds to complete its sequence.

=== The Politician A Toy ===
'''[http://www.billielawless.com/description_of_pol.html The Politician A Toy]''' is a Lawless sculpture, created under the fiscal umbrella of The [[Cleveland Public Theater]] which is located at 6345 Detroit Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio. The sculpture was funded by some 150 corporations of local and national origin. For many years, the sculpture was located close to downtown at the corner of Chester Avenue and E. 66th Street on a site provided by Roy Kuhn and the Kinco-Balin Corporation. The sculpture stands over forty feet tall and is enclosed with a wrought iron fence forty feet by fifty feet.The sculpture is composed of twenty tons of steel (plate, channels and I-beams), two tons of [[polypropylene]] rope (the tail), [[fiber glass]] (the bowties), a ton of cedar (the handle), assorted bearings (for the wheels and mouth mechanism,) television sets (the eyes,) industrial epoxy paints and the various electrical components which power the piece. The sculpture is set on four concrete foundations and surrounded by a wrought iron fence five feet tall. The top of the fence is lined with double entrendres of political cliches. The Mayor of Cleveland, [[Michael R. White]], opposed the erection of the sculpture for purely aesthetic reasons ("I 've seen it and I don't like it...." [[The Plain Dealer]], Feb. 19, 1994.) This opposition created difficulty in obtaining the required building permits from the City's Building Department. Ultimately the threat of a Federal lawsuit persuaded City officials to process Lawless' building permits. The sculpture stood on private land for the last thirteen years and was privately funded. Currently, the work resides near the Monte Ahuja College of Business at [[Cleveland State University]], 18th Street and Chester Avenue in downtown Cleveland, Ohio. CSU students wanted to make a community garden around this abomination, but Lawless wouldn't have it, and threatened lawsuits. He claimed that if he thought a garden would enhance his "artwork", he would have planted one himself.

=== $...I Know It When I See It...$ (Uncensored Einstein to Uncensored Bork) ===
[[File:I Know It When I See It.jpg|right|thumb|200px]]
Armed with inspiration in the form of Walter Kendrick's ''The Secret Museum'' and [[Walker Percy]]'s ''The Message in the Bottle'', books dealing with the history of pornography, its suppression, and the nature of language and man, Lawless created a multimedia installation at SPACES (Cleveland, Ohio), a key work in the Uncensored exhibit in 1987. Although smaller than ''Green Lightning'' this work confronted many of the same issues, resurrected the offending "images", and incorporated video technology.

From the title down to the sources for the video clips, Lawless rips political statements out of their contexts and illuminates them with biting irony. Judge [[Potter Stewart]]'s infamous inadequate definition of pornography forms the title. Passages from the 1986 [[Meese Report]] lifted verbatim from banned films and books were used—titillating material, considering it is a government document. A [[Mozart]] string quartet and quotes from [[Einstein]] and [[Susan Sontag]] were also included on scrolling text. Lawless juxtaposes the "safest, most conservative music—that of Mozart—with scenes from The Devil and Miss Jones, and comments on the frequent censorship in art as compared to music and science.

Framing the video monitors was a wall of manufactured political posters slapped up repetitively with graffiti, and superimposed on what was a timed sequence of the same neon penis figure stepping up to a podium to direct the proceedings. Although much of the work is tongue-in-cheek, it addresses the issue of censorship, tries to define the weird line between pornography and art, and wrestles with the urge for communication under government suppression.

=== Broasted Babies Brew-ha-ha ===
[[File:Broasted babies top view.jpg|right|thumb|200px]]
Broasted Babies Brew Ha Ha - was first shown at SPACES in Cleveland, Ohio in March 1989. It was exhibited again at CAGE in Cincinnati Ohio in the Fall of 1992.
It is a full gallery installation that involved repainting the walls of the gallery a bright pink and which were then layered with stencils, enlarged photocopied recipes with alterations by Lawless, and
tri-fold silkscreened plastic panels that had animated swinging babies. On the floor Lawless laid out enlarged images from original photographs of the [[My Lai massacre]] in Vietnam. These photographs were purchased from the [[National Archives]] which included full usage of the copyright. Between and on top of these photographs were laid
icons that incorporated images repeatedly used by Lawless in his work set in decorated rat traps.
[[File:Broasted wall.jpg|left|thumb|100px]]
Between the photographs and leading toward the center of the installation (a broken crucifix on a funeral pyre) were spermlike images composed of yellow paint pigment. Following these images toward the center were multicolored, silkscreened, folded rats that started amassed from one wall in a corner of the gallery.
The broken crucifix approximately 8' wide and 10' long and 2' high and composed of sheet metal rested on a funeral pyre of ascending railroad ties.
Inside this crucifix in each corner was a small television set which had a looping video that dealt with a carefully chosen metaphor referring to [[genocide]]. The cover of this crucifix was 1/4" [[Lexan]], painted with images of babies in severed sections. Crisscrossed and also inside were the words BROASTED and BABIES in a light blue neon.
According to Lawless this installation dealt with the subject of 2000 years of genocide as perfected by mankind.

=== Cock-a-doodle-doo ===
[[File:Buff state art.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Cock-a-doodle-doo]]
Cock-a-doodle-doo is located at [[Buffalo State College|SUNY College at Buffalo]], across from the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York. The sculpture stands 26' High and is 23' wide and 19' deep. The sculpture is composed of steel plate that has been [[Heat treating|heat treated]], sandblasted and finished with [[epoxy]] paints. This piece is one of a series of six pieces created by Lawless that deal with a subtle shift of planes, intersections and juxtapositions, formalist in nature, and were the last of his abstract work.

==== Other Abstract Work ====
Other works in the abstract sculpture series include:
*'''Hungry Fish''' is an 18' tall abstract and figurative sculpture.
*'''Life Savers''' which is located in Philadelphia, PA on the campus of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].
*'''Dancing Fish''' which is in the collection of the Buscaglia-Castellani Art Gallery, [[Niagara University]], Niagara Falls, NY.

Technically, any premises where [[prostitution]] commonly takes place qualifies as a brothel.  However, for legal or cultural reasons, establishments often describe themselves as [[massage parlor]]s, [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s, [[strip club]]s, body rub parlours, studios, or by some other description.

[[File:RedLightDistrictAmsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The red light district ''[[De Wallen]]'' in [[Amsterdam]]]]
Around the world attitudes towards prostitution, and how it should be regulated (if at all), vary considerably, and have varied over time. Part of the discussion impacts on whether the operation of brothels should be legal, and if so, to what sort of regulations they should be subjected.

On 2 December 1949, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] approved the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]].&lt;ref&gt;General Assembly resolution 317(IV)&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention came into effect on 25 July 1951 and by December 2013 had been ratified by 82 states.&lt;ref name=ratifications&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=VII-11-a&amp;chapter=7&amp;lang=en |title=United Nations Treaty Collection |publisher= |accessdate=29 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907020434/https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=VII-11-a&amp;chapter=7&amp;lang=en |archivedate=7 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention seeks to combat prostitution, which it regards as "incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person." Parties to the Convention agreed to abolish regulation of individual prostitutes, and to ban brothels and [[Procuring (prostitution)|procuring]]. Some countries not parties to the Convention also ban prostitution or the operation of brothels.

Various United Nations commissions, however, have differing positions on the issue. For example, in 2012, a [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS]] (UNAIDS) convened by [[Ban Ki-moon]] and backed by [[United Nations Development Programme]] and UNAIDS, recommended decriminalization of brothels and procuring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/4128420.html Decriminalisation integral to the fight against HIV] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409071255/http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/4128420.html# |date=2014-04-09 }}, Michael Kirby &amp; Michael Wong, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 13 JULY 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnsnews.com/news/article/un-commission-calls-legalizing-prostitution-worldwide U.N.

In the [[European Union]], there is no uniform policy and no consensus on the issue; and laws vary widely from country to country. Netherlands and Germany have the most liberal policies; in Sweden (and in Norway and Iceland outside the EU) the buying, but not selling, of sex, is illegal; in most former Communist countries the laws target the prostitutes; while in countries such as the UK, Ireland and France the act of prostitution is not itself illegal, but soliciting, pimping and brothels are, making it difficult to engage in prostitution without breaking any law. The [[European Women's Lobby]] condemns prostitution as "an intolerable form of male violence" and supports the "Swedish model".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenslobby.eu/spip.php?article472&amp;lang=en |title=European Women's Lobby Européen des femmes : Prostitution in Europe: 60 Years of Reluctance |publisher=Womenslobby.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the members of the European Parliament voted in a non-binding resolution, (adopted by 343 votes to 139; with 105 abstentions), in favor of the "Swedish Model" of criminalizing the buying, but not the selling of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20140221IPR36644/html/Punish-the-client-not-the-prostitute|title=Punish the client, not the prostitute {{!}} News {{!}} European Parliament|website=News {{!}} European Parliament|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02|date=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prostitution laws of the world2.PNG|thumb|upright=1.5|Brothels are legal only in countries and areas shown in green or light blue]]
Prostitution and the operation of brothels is illegal in many countries, though known illegal brothels may be tolerated or laws not strictly enforced. Such situations exist in many parts of the world, but the region most often associated with these policies is [[Prostitution in Asia|Asia]]. When brothels are illegal they may nevertheless operate in the guise of a legitimate business, such as massage parlors, saunas or spas.

In other places, prostitution itself may be legal, but many activities which surround it (such as operating a brothel, pimping, and soliciting in a public place) are illegal, often making it very difficult for people to engage in prostitution without breaking any law. This is the situation, for example, in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]] and [[France]].

In a few countries, prostitution and operating a brothel is legal and regulated. The degree of regulation varies widely by country. Most of these countries allow brothels, at least in theory, as they are considered to be less problematic than [[street prostitution]]. In parts of [[Australia]], for example, brothels are legal and regulated. Regulation includes planning controls and licensing and registration requirements, and there may be other restrictions. However, the existence of licensed brothels does not stop illegal brothels from operating. According to a report in the Australian ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]]'', illegal brothels in [[Sydney]] in 2009 outnumbered licensed operations by four to one;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/05/18/2573799.htm |title=NSW papers urged to cut brothel ads, ABC news |language=bg |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rideworks.com/|title=Entertainment Agency by RideWorks|last=|first=|date=|website=rideworks.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Queensland]] only 10% of prostitution happens in licensed brothels, with the rest being either unregulated or illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/queensland-sex-industry-still-largely-illegitimate-20090816-embf.html |title=Queensland sex industry still largely illegitimate, Brisbane Times |publisher=Brisbanetimes.com.au |date=2009-08-16 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of legal brothels in Queensland was to help improve safety of sex workers, punters and the community at large and reduce crime.

The earliest recorded mention of prostitution as an occupation appears in Sumerian records from ca. 2400  [[Common Era|BCE]], and describes a temple-bordello operated by [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian priests]] in the city of Uruk. The 'kakum' or temple was dedicated to the goddess [[Ishtar]] and housed three grades of women. The first group performed only in the temple sex-rites; the second group had the run of the grounds and catered to its visitors as well; and the third and lowest class lived on the temple grounds but were free to seek out customers in the streets. In later years, [[sacred prostitution]] and similar classifications of females were known to have existed in Greece, Rome, India, China, and Japan.{{sfn|Murphy|1983| }}

===Europe===
State brothels/bordellos with regulated prices existed in ancient [[Athens]], created by the legendary lawmaker [[Solon]]. These brothels catered for a predominantly male clientele, with women of all ages and young men providing sexual services (see [[Prostitution in ancient Greece]]). In ancient Rome female slaves provided sexual services for soldiers, with brothels being located close to barracks and city walls. Brothels existed everywhere. The custom was to display lit candles to signal that they were open.

Before the appearance of effective [[contraception]], [[infanticide]] was common in brothels. Unlike usual infanticide&amp;mdash;where historically girls were more likely to be killed at birth&amp;mdash;prostitutes in ancient times were more likely to kill male offspring.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14401305 ''Roman dead baby 'brothel' mystery deepens''], BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1537 Braunschweiger Monogrammist Bordellszene anagoria.JPG|thumb|left|Brothel scene; [[Brunswick Monogrammist]], 1537; [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]]]

Cities first began setting up municipal brothels between 1350 and 1450 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Timeline--Prostitution|url=http://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000117|work=Should prostitution be legal?|publisher=ProCon.org|accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipalities often owned, operated, and regulated the legal brothels. Governments would set aside certain streets where a keeper could open a brothel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heckel |first=N.M. |title=Sex, Society, and Medieval Women |url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/medsex/text.htm |publisher=River Campus Libraries |accessdate=23 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102214718/http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/medsex/text.htm |archivedate=November 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These separate sections of town were the precursors to the so-called "red light districts". Not only did the towns restrict where a keeper could open a brothel, they also put constraints on when the brothel could be open. For example, most brothels were forbidden to be open for business on Sunday and religious holidays. The reason for this is not completely clear. Some scholars believe these restrictions were enforced to make the prostitutes go to church but others argue that it was to keep parishioners in church and out of the brothels. Either way, it was a day of no revenue for the keeper.

Although brothels were set up as a sexual outlet for men, not all men were allowed to enter them. Clerics, married men, and Jews were prohibited.{{sfn|Bennett|1989|pp=100–134}} Often, foreigners such as sailors and traders were the main source of revenue. Local men who frequented the brothels mainly consisted of single men; laws restricting the patrons were not always enforced. Government officials or police would periodically do searches of the brothels to cut down on the number of unpermitted customers. However, since the government was so closely related to the church, common punishments were minor. These restrictions were put in place to protect the wives of married men from any sort of infection.
[[File:William Hogarth 027.jpg|rightbottom|thumb|The Brothel Scene from ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' by [[William Hogarth]], 1735]]
Multiple restrictions were placed on the residents of brothels. One limitation prohibited prostitutes from borrowing money from her brothel keeper. Prostitutes paid high prices to the brothel keeper for the basic necessities of life: room and board, food, clothes, and toiletries. Room and board was often a price set by the local government but the price for everything else could add up to a common woman's entire earnings. Prostitutes were sometimes prohibited from having a special lover. Some regulations put on prostitutes were made to protect their clients. A woman was kicked out if she was found to have a sexually transmitted disease. Also, the prostitutes were not allowed to pull men into the brothel by their clothing, harass them in the street, or detain them over unpaid debts.{{sfn|Karras|1996|pp=32–47}} Clothing worn by prostitutes was regulated as well and had to be distinguishable from that of respectable women. In some places a prostitute had to have a yellow stripe on her clothing while in others red was the differentiating color. Other towns required harlots to don special headdresses or restricted the wardrobe of proper women. All restrictions placed on prostitutes were put in place not only to protect them but nearby citizens as well.

Even with all the regulations placed on legalized brothels and those people associated with the establishments, they were fated to be done away with. Because of a [[syphilis]] epidemic throughout Europe many brothels were shut down during the end of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Brief History of Brothels|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/a-brief-history-of-brothels-523946.html|publisher=The Independent Newspaper|accessdate=23 July 2017|date=21 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This epidemic had been brought on by Spanish and French military pillages after the return of Christopher Columbus from the newly discovered Americas. The church and citizens alike feared that men who frequented brothels would bring the disease home and infect morally upright people.

From the 12th century, brothels in London were located in a district known as the [[Liberty of the Clink]]. This area was traditionally under the authority of the [[Bishop of Winchester]], not the civil authorities. From 1161, the bishop was granted the power to license prostitutes and brothels in the district. This gave rise to the slang term ''Winchester Goose'' for a prostitute. Women who worked in these brothels were denied Christian burial and buried in the unconsecrated graveyard known as [[Cross Bones]].

By the 16th century, the area was also home to many theatres, (including the [[Globe Theatre]], associated with [[William Shakespeare]]), but brothels continued to thrive. A famous London brothel of the time was ''Holland's Leaguer''. Patrons supposedly included [[James I of England]] and his favourite, [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]]. It was located in a street that still bears its name{{sfn|Walford|1878|pp=29-44}} and also inspired the 1631 play, ''[[Holland's Leaguer]]''. [[Charles I of England]] licensed a number of brothels including the [[Silver Cross Tavern]] in London, which retains its licence to modern day because it was never revoked.

The authorities of Medieval Paris followed the same path as those in London and attempted to confine prostitution to a particular district. [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] (1226–1270) designated nine streets in the [[Beaubourg]] [[Historical quarters of Paris|Quartier]] where it would be permitted. In the early part of the 19th century, state-controlled legal brothels (then known as "''maisons de tolérance''" or "''maisons closes''") started to appear in several French cities. By law, they had to be run by a woman (typically a former prostitute) and their external appearance had to be discreet. The ''maisons'' were required to light a red lantern when they were open (from which is derived the term [[red-light district]]) and the prostitutes were only permitted to leave the ''maisons'' on certain days and only if accompanied by its head. By 1810, Paris alone had 180 officially approved brothels.

During the first half of the 20th century, some Paris brothels, such as [[le Chabanais]] and [[le Sphinx]], were internationally known for the luxury they provided. The French government sometimes included a visit to the ''Chabanais'' as part of the program for foreign guests of state, disguising it as a ''visit with the President of the Senate'' in the official program.&lt;ref name=sz&gt;Die Sphinx im Freudenhaus, ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 17 August 1996. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hotel Marigny'', established in 1917 in the [[2nd arrondissement of Paris]], was one of several that were well known for catering to gay male clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sin city: show celebrates the Paris brothel that was loved by Cary Grant |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/sin-city-show-celebrates-the-paris-brothel-that-was-loved-by-cary-grant-1815759.html |newspaper=The Independent |date= 6 November 2009|accessdate=30 January 2011 |first=Genevieve |last=Roberts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premises suspected of being gay brothels, including the Hotel Marigny, were however subject to frequent police raids,{{sfn|Jackson|2009|p=29}} perhaps indicating less tolerance for them from the authorities.

In most European countries, brothels were made illegal after World War II. France outlawed brothels in 1946, after a campaign by [[Marthe Richard]]. The backlash against them was in part due to their wartime collaboration with the Germans during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|occupation of France]]. Twenty-two Paris brothels had been commandeered by the Germans for their exclusive use; some had made a great deal of money by catering for German officers and soldiers.&lt;ref name=daily&gt;Peter Allen, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1175836/Sleeping-enemy-How-horizontal-collaborators-Paris-brothels-enjoyed-golden-age-entertaining-Hitlers-troops.html Sleeping with the enemy: How 'horizontal collaborators' in Paris brothels enjoyed a golden age entertaining Hitler's troops], ''Daily Mail'', 1 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; One brothel in the [[Monmartre]] District of the French capital was part of an escape network for [[prisoner of war|POW]]s and shot down airmen.{{sfn|Regan|1992|p=37}}

===East Asia===
Brothels have been used formally in [[China]] for prostitution and [[entertainment]] since [[Ancient China]] in its [[feudal]] period. For much of China's ancient and imperial history, brothels were owned by wealthy [[merchants]], typically stereotyped as "madams", and engaged in business in urban areas such as the Capital city. Prostitutes, or "[[courtesans]]" as they were known, were well-dressed and groomed to the proper table and drinking [[manners]](禮). A Chinese prostitute may have been artistic and skilled at practices such as [[dancing]], playing [[musical instruments]], [[singing]] and conversing in [[verse (poetry)|verse]]. Prostitution was not [[outlawed]] in ancient and imperial China (although prostitutes were not considered fit for marriage to men of respectable social ranking) and instead prostitutes hosted in street brothels were popularly placed in the same [[social class]] as female [[artisans]] and regarded as elegant, albeit tainted, beings, most notably courtesans who used similar means to entertain members of [[nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinawhisper.com/top-10-famous-prostitutes-in-chinese-history/|title=The 8 Famous Prostitutes in Chinese History|date=14 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both young women and men worked as prostitutes in these elaborate brothel settings, though historical records and works of [[literature]] have widely [[Romanticism|romanticized]] the free-flowing, artistic nature of female prostitutes.

The practice of hosting prostitutes in these elaborate brothels spread to surrounding regions of [[Chinese culture sphere|Chinese cultural influence]], notably in [[Japan]] after the sixth century [[AD]], where prostitutes and courtesans evolved to develop the ''[[Oiran]]'' and ''[[Geisha]]'' entertainment professions. Again, the ''geisha'' of Japan emphasized good table manners, artistic skills, elegant styling and sophisticated, tactical conversational skills. The practice also spread to [[Korea]], where prostitutes evolved into the [[Korean people|Korean]] ''[[kisaeng]]''.

===India===
The governments of many Indian [[princely state]]s had regulated [[prostitution in India]] prior to the 1860s. [[British Raj]] enacted [[Prostitution_in_colonial_India#Cantonment Act of 1864|Cantonment Act of 1864]] to regulate [[Prostitution in colonial India]] as a matter of accepting a necessary evil.&lt;ref name=tambe2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tambe|first=Ashwini|title=The Elusive Ingenue:A transnational Feminist Analysis of European Prostitution in Colonial Bombay|journal=Gender and Society|volume=19|issue=2|date=19 February 2005|pages=160–79|doi=10.1177/0891243204272781}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cantonment Acts regulated and structured prostitution in the British [[military bases]] which provided for about twelve to fifteen Indian women kept in brothels called ''chaklas'' for each regiment of thousand British [[soldiers]]. They were licensed by military officials and were allowed to consort with soldiers only.&lt;ref name=bhandari2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhandari|first=Sudhanshu|title=Prostitution in Colonial India|url=http://www.mainstreamweekly.net/article2142.html|accessdate=October 13, 2012|journal=Mainstream Weekly|date=June 19, 2010|volume=XLVIII|number=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Brothels in India came into life in early 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.escortgirlgurgaon.com/blog/5-interesting-effects-of-poor-market-conditions-on-indian-escort-industry/#Indian-brothels-history|title=5 Interesting Effects of Poor Market Conditions on Indian Escort Industry – LifeSide|website=www.escortgirlgurgaon.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-27|date=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; when there was a proper dance group in [[Maharashtra]];  when people went to see the group's performance, they would demand sex as well, showing a willingness to pay. Enormous amounts of money earned made the show's organizers move the show to different parts of India such as [[Lucknow]], [[Jaipur]] and [[Kolkata]], giving birth to the modern brothel industry in India.

===United States===

From 1911 to 1913 the [[United States Department of Justice]] undertook the task of collecting information on the numbers of prostitutes in brothels in order to use this information against the much feared "[[White slavery (prostitution)|White Slave Traffic]]".{{sfn|Woolston|1969|p=38}}  This effort collected information from 318 cities of 26 Eastern states. It estimated about 100,000 women to be working in brothels at the time, yet some estimated the total number of prostitutes to be as high as 500,000.{{sfn|Woolston|1969|p=39}}

During the late nineteenth century, brothels in the United States were no secret. George Kneeland articulated his growing concern about the organized sex business in America well, saying that prostitution had grown into a "highly commercialized and profitable business that penetrated the deepest recesses of the political, cultural and economic life of the city."{{sfn|Kneeland|Davis|1913| }} Brothels were commonly referred to as "disorderly houses", and their residents were called by many names, some [[Euphemism|euphemistic]] - e.g., "abandoned woman", "bawd good-time daisy", "fallen angel", "fille de joie", "jeweled bird", "lady of the evening", "shady lady", "soiled dove", "wanton woman", and "woman of the town" - and some less kind – e.g., "hooker", "slut", and "whore".{{sfn|McKell|2009|p=5}} As the 19th century went on, prostitution as a profession became more common, rather than just occasionally necessitated soliciting. As a result of these changes, the way prostitution was practiced changed.{{sfn|Walkoitz|1982| }}  Many prostitutes still  practiced their trade independently, but the new class of professional prostitutes created a demand for a location to do their regular business, and the brothel served this purpose.{{sfn|Rosen|1983| }}  
 	
Visitors could easily find disorderly houses by merely opening up the local or statewide directories, such as the 1895 ''Travelers' Guide of Colorado''.{{sfn|McKell|2009|p=4}} This 66-page manual helped the interested client decide which brothel was right for him. These manuals did not attract by using euphemistic language, and though bold by standards of the time, were not crude. Some examples read: "Twenty young ladies engaged nightly to entertain guest", and "Strangers cordially welcome".  In some areas, brothels simply could not be ignored. A nineteenth-century authority describes the city of New Orleans as such: "The extent of licentiousness and prostitution here is truly appalling and doubtless without a parallel in the whole civilized world. The indulgence and practice is so general and common that men seldom seek to cover up their acts or go in disguise."{{sfn|Fernando|1963|p=254}}

The average house held five to twenty working girls; some higher end brothels also employed staff servants, musicians, and a bouncer. The typical brothel contained several bedrooms, all furnished. Some upscale brothels were much larger; such is the case with that owned by Mary Ann Hall of [[Arlington, Virginia]].{{sfn|Webb|2004|p=26}}  It is described as "a rather grand house with twenty five rooms and was enclosed by a brick wall. The interior was elegantly furnished. The principle rooms on the first floor contained large oil paintings, Brussels carpets, red plush 'parlor furniture', étagères (a shelf for small ornaments), and numerous items of silver plate."{{sfn|Milner Associates|loc=Appendix II}}  An archeological dig of the area outside of Mary Ann Hall's estate revealed a high quality of material superior to those in surrounding working class areas.  This included many champagne bottles and corks, wire cages from such bottles, perfume bottles, high quality porcelain with gilt edging, along with remnants of exotic foods – coconut shells and berry seeds, bones from beef, fish, and pork indicating that elegant meals were being eaten at this high class brothel.{{sfn|Milner Associates|pp=111–197}}  These "five and ten dollar parlor houses" attracted wealthy men, who used the facilities much as a gentlemen's social club,{{sfn|Rosen|1983|p= 86}} where they made business and political connections, met with associates, and had exquisite dinners with wine, champagne, and women. Brothels were not only for the wealthy.  "One-dollar houses" were visited by those of the working class. A 1910 Kansas vice report compares the two: "A few brothels were equipped with expensive furniture and furnishings including the finest of upholstered chairs, well done paintings and costly rugs, which others were hovels of repulsive squalor."{{sfn|Johnson|1911|p=98}}

Women joined brothels from all walks of life. The average prostitute was approximately age 21,{{sfn|McKell|2009|p=6}} but many were as young as thirteen or as old as 50. Typically thought of as an escape for young, poor, troubled women, brothels sometimes attracted those less expected. Trained musicians and singers sometimes were lured into it by their interest in easy money and fun times.{{sfn|McKell|2009|p=19}} Some others turned to brothels to get out of their boring, abusive, or otherwise unfulfilling marriages.  Although they might be of various classes, ethnicities, and ages, most women who began or joined brothels had a shared goal: quick money.{{sfn|McKell|2009|p=6}} Ironically, many found themselves always indebted to their mistresses. Due to their lack of credit, a prostitute was unable to buy items necessary for her trade herself – powder, cosmetics, perfumes, and "evening wear" - but was forced to buy them through her Madam.{{sfn|McKell|2009|p=8}}

Some madams, often former prostitutes themselves, rose to become independently wealthy. One was Mary Ann Hall of Arlington, Virginia. Clearly attractive and a good business woman, Mary Ann purchased a lot and built a brick house. This would be the location of an upscale brothel for another 40 years, sitting right at the foot of Capitol Hill. Her brothel was very lucrative, and Mary Ann was able to buy multiple slaves and even a summer home. She was responsible for the behavior or her prostitutes, which could prove challenging since drug abuse was common. A large focus for madams was keeping their business transactions discreet and staying on the good side of the law; they did so by contributing money to charitable organizations, schools, and churches.  Despite these efforts, much of the profit still went to legal fines and fees, since prostitution was largely illegal. Timely payment of these fines could guarantee a madam that her business could continue without fear of being shut down, usually. Brothels were expected to pay significantly higher rent than others.{{sfn|Webb|2004|pp=24–33}} Another upscale bordello was the Big Brick in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], built and operated by [[Grace Peixotto]], the daughter of the Rev. Solomon Cohen Peixotto, and the madam of the most infamous brothel in the history of the city.{{sfn|Jones|2006|pp=19–23}}

A madam stayed involved in her business. Running a house with so many in it required skill. A brothel required the purchase of regular food and food preparation. A madam had to monitor the cleanliness of the brothel, including the sheets that had to be changed several times in an evening, and maintain a stock of wines and liquors for clientele. She was the boss of the brothel, so a madam fired and hired servants, maids, and prostitutes. New faces in the brothel were desired by patrons, so madams had to find new women to recruit. Sometimes this meant taking in a less than desired woman, yet with youth and good looks. The "new" prostitute received training, cosmetics, and clothes from the madam. A prostitute from Kansas City is recorded as saying that she is no match for the "proper" behavior and dress required for the famous Ice Palace in Chicago.{{sfn|Rosen|1983|p=87}}

Disorderly houses, or any other dwelling used for purposes of selling sex or other lewd acts in the early 20th century, were illegal with a few exceptions: the states of Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Mexico, and South Carolina. Penalties could range from $1,000 and time in jail, to much smaller fines.{{sfn|Rosen|1983| }}

Until recently, in several armies around the world, mobile brothels were attached to the army as auxiliary units, especially attached to combat units on long-term deployments abroad. Because it is a controversial subject, military brothels and the women who provided sex services in them were often designated with creative [[euphemism]]s. Examples of such jargon are {{lang|fr|la boîte à bonbons}} ({{lang-en|"the sweet box"}}), replacing the term "{{lang|fr|[[bordel militaire de campagne]]}}". [[France]] used mobile brothels during the [[First World War]], the [[Second World War]] and the [[First Indochina War]] to supply sex services to French soldiers who were facing combat in areas where brothels were unusual, such as at the [[front line]] or in isolated garrisons.&lt;ref&gt;World Association of International Studies [http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/wais/cgi-bin/index.php?p=2351 article] retrieved on March 10, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612081843/http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/wais/cgi-bin/index.php?p=2351 |date=June 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Windrow|2004| }} Brothels were outlawed in France in 1946; but the [[French Foreign Legion]] continued to use mobile brothels until the late 1990s.

'''Chernobyl Children International''' (CCI) is a [[United Nations]]-accredited,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} [[non-profit]], international development, medical, and humanitarian organisation that works with children, families and communities that continue to be affected by the economic outcome of the 1986 [[Chernobyl accident]]. The organisation's founder and chief executive is [[Adi Roche]].  Before 2010, it was known as '''Chernobyl Children's Project International''' (CCPI).

== History ==
Chernobyl Children's Project International was founded in [[Ireland]] in 1991 by [[Adi Roche]] in response to an appeal from [[Belarus]]ian doctors for aid. Roche, previously a volunteer in a nuclear disarmament group, received a fax in 1991 which read "SOS appeal. For god's sake, please help us get the children out," which inspired her to take action. That year, Roche set up a small workspace in a spare bedroom of her home and began organising 'rest and recuperation' holidays for a few Chernobyl children. Recruiting Irish families who would welcome and care for them, CCPI began in Ireland in 1991, and expanded into the [[United States]] in 2001.  It changed its name to Chernobyl Children International in 2010.

Over its lifetime, the organisation has grown in strength and numbers and is now the single largest contributor to Belarus and the fallout from Chernobyl. It works closely with the Belarusian government, the [[United Nations]] and many thousands of volunteers in Ireland, Belarus and worldwide to deliver a broad range of supports to the children and the wider community. It also acts as an advocate for the rights of those affected by the Chernobyl explosion, and engages in research and outreach activities to encourage the rest of the world to remember the victims and understand the long-term impact on their lives.

To date, Chernobyl Children's contributions exceed €105 million in direct and indirect aid. Its flagship Rest and Recuperation Programme has brought over 25,500 children to Ireland, returning an average of two years to each child's lifespan.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} . Following advocacy by Voluntary CEO at the United Nations General Assembly on the 30th Anniversary of the disaster, the UN designated the 26 April to be known as 'International Chernobyl Disaster Remembrance Day'.

== Programmes ==
Chernobyl Children International works with families and communities in Chernobyl affected regions to help them to overcome the [[domino effect]] of poverty, poor health, and social and psychosocial impact that was the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

Active programmes of Chernobyl Children International include:

* '''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Flying Doctors' Cardiac Programme''':  CCI sends surgical teams into Ukraine to perform operations and train local doctors.  3,950 surgeries have been performed by CCI doctors to date. 
* '''Nursing and therapeutic training programs''': CCI sends volunteer nurses and physical/occupational/speech-language therapists to Chernobyl affected regions to work directly with children in understaffed medical institutions and provide training to their local counterparts.
*'''Community centers and programs''': Ten new centres have been built or refurbished giving educational, medical and social services to populations of over 30,000 per centre.
*'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Homes of Hope'''' :  CCI’s ‘Homes of Hope’ programme provides the alternative to state institutions via 30 homes that have been purchased and renovated, this is the equivalent of closing two orphanages in Belarus. It takes children out of orphanages, and places them these non-state homes. In 2010 [[An Garda Siochána]] presented a cheque of 70,000 euros, to house ten orphans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.garda.ie/en/About-Us/Our-Departments/Office-of-Corporate-Communications/Press-Releases/2010/March/Presentation-of-Cheque-to-Chernobyl-Children%E2%80%99s-Project-on-behalf-of-An-Garda-Siochana1.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Rest and Recuperation programs''': CCI has sponsored over 25,500 children from contaminated areas to spend summer and winter holidays families in Ireland. CCI hosted many other children in camps in their home country of Belarus, including special camps for children recovering from heart surgery and cancer, and seriously disabled children.
*'''Hospice''' :CCI has built and equipped the first ever baby hospice in Belarus. CCI has provided expert training to the staff to ensure the best care to patients.
*"'''Aid Direct" humanitarian aid''':  CCI purchases and delivers necessary medical and humanitarian supplies in Belarus, for delivery to project sites and community centers throughout the country.

== Volunteers ==
As a charitable, non-profit organisation, Chernobyl Children International relies heavily on the contribution of thousands of volunteers. CCI's volunteers are organised into three programmes:

* '''Medical Programme''': Doctors, nurses, surgeons and dentists offer their time and talents to provide medical treatments and hospice care to the children of Chernobyl. Their efforts have saved the lives of thousands of children and reduced the pain and suffering of thousands more.
* '''Building and Construction Programme''': Skilled electricians, builders and carpenters put their talents to work in building, refurbishing and renovating much-needed institutions, such as day-care centres, medical centres and asylums, and foster homes known as “Homes of Hope.” These volunteers put a safe roof over the heads of some of Belarus’s most vulnerable children and families, improving their health, sanitation, and comfort levels. 
* '''Rest and Recuperation Programme''': Families across Ireland open their homes and their hearts to more than 1,000 children affected by the Chernobyl disaster, giving them a chance to recover from the ravages of the toxic environment in which they are forced to live. Volunteers from Ireland and America also travel to Belarus each year to help run in-country rest and recuperation camps for children too ill to travel to Ireland.

The organisation also helps and maintains Volunteer Outreach Groups that are located throughout Ireland and [[Northern Ireland]]. The Outreach groups organise their own awareness and fundraising events in aid of the CCI, and have helped raise millions of Euro for the victims of Chernobyl.

== Board of Directors ==
Chernobyl Children International is overseen by an eight-person board of directors.  Its membership includes Roche, [[Ali Hewson]], [[Noel Kelly (curator)|Noel Kelly]], and [[Liz O'Donnell]]. Peter Lacy is the Chairperson of the Board of Directors.

Hewson, the wife of [[U2]]'s lead singer [[Bono]], is one of the organisation's more visible members and patrons and has made a number of trips with the group to the Chernobyl-affected areas.  All proceeds from U2's 1998 [[single (music)|single]], "[[Sweetest Thing]]," were donated to the organisation.

== About ==

The Craftivist Collective has been called 'guerrilla crafting',&lt;ref name="bigissuenorth" /&gt; as their projects often involve leaving crafted messages in public places. Their projects are often small-scale, intended to draw people in.&lt;ref name="ohcomely" /&gt; There are lists of projects to do and video tutorials online.&lt;ref name="mollie"&gt;''Join the collective'', ''Mollie Makes'', issue 9&lt;/ref&gt;  They run talks, workshops, stalls and exhibitions and sell Craftivist Collective kits and merchandise.&lt;ref name="bigissuenorth" /&gt;

The 'collective' is a loose term covering anyone who gets involved.&lt;ref name="otesha"&gt;Gavin, http://www.otesha.org.uk/blog/4662/diy/the-craftivism-qa.html ''The Craftivism Q&amp;A'', otesha.org.uk, 23 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The group particularly seeks to engage people who haven't previously had much involvement or interest in politics and activism.&lt;ref name="nus"&gt;''Learning from outside movement'', ''NUS Get Organised'', April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amelias"&gt;Hannah Bullivant, ''The Craftivist Collective'', http://www.ameliasmagazine.com/earth/the-craftivist-collective/2010/04/05/, 5 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; For many members the group is a stepping stone to more traditional activism methods.&lt;ref name="ladycraft"&gt;Nikki Shaill, ''Craftivist Collective'', ''Lady Craft'' zine for Ladyfest Ten, Summer 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Corbett calls it 'slow activism'&lt;ref name="positive2" /&gt; and 'introverted activism', saying "it's not about performance and vying for attention, it's about offering people the choice to engage".&lt;ref name="littlebook" /&gt;

The groups hold regular meetings.&lt;ref name="zaman"&gt;Wanda Caton, ''The art of resistance'', ''Weekly Zaman'', 21 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rwd"&gt;''Craftivists'', ''RWD magazine'', April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups such as [[Women's Institutes]] and schools have also been involved in projects.&lt;ref name="trebuchet"&gt;Sarah Corbett-Batson, http://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/sarah-corbett-interview-part-1/ ''Sarah Corbett: Interview (part 1)'', trebuchet-magazine.com, 3 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The collective is self-funded and receives donated materials from supporters.&lt;ref name="littlebook" /&gt;

== History ==

A self-proclaimed 'burnt-out activist' who disliked the image of the aggressive activist, but wanted to do something to change the world,&lt;ref name="satreview" /&gt; Sarah Corbett was involved in activism while growing up in Liverpool and then studying at the [[University of Manchester]].&lt;ref name="bigissuenorth" /&gt; She worked for traditional charities for seven years.&lt;ref name="lionheart" /&gt; It was after moving to London  for a job in 2007&lt;ref name="house" /&gt; and joining various activist groups that she started getting increasingly into her hobby of cross-stitch, finding that it helped with stress.

She didn't feel like she fitted into any of the activist groups she joined in London.&lt;ref name="ohcomely" /&gt; She had been cross-stitching as a hobby since the age of 18 and in August 2008&lt;ref name="otesha" /&gt; had the 'light bulb' idea to combine the two.&lt;ref name="bigissuenorth" /&gt;

Corbett set up the [http://alonelycraftivist.blogspot.co.uk/ Lonely Craftivist] blog in 2008&lt;ref name="bigissuenorth" /&gt; and began receiving comments and emails from people around the world asking to join in. She held a first meeting&lt;ref name="ohcomely" /&gt; and got in touch with sociologist Betsy Greer who coined the word 'craftivism' in 2003 by.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;Katie Harris, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-politics/9927574/Meet-the-women-quietly-crafting-their-own-revolution.html ''Meet the women quietly crafting their own revolution''], telegraph.co.uk, 13 March 2013, retrieved 7 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Greer was encouraging&lt;ref name="mollie" /&gt; so Corbett founded and co-ordinated a national group called Craftivist Collective.&lt;ref name="bigissuenorth" /&gt; In 2012 she went part-time at her [[Oxfam]] job to devote more time to the collective,&lt;ref name="woman" /&gt; and in October 2012 gave up her job to work full-time for Craftivist Collective.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

'''Danish Greenlanders''' are [[Danish people|Danish]] immigrants in [[Greenland]] and their descendants.

Danish Greenlanders are a minority ethnic group in Greenland, accounting for around 11% of the territory's population.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gl.html |title=CIA – The World Factbook – Greenland |accessdate=2013-10-13 |publisher=CIA | archiveurl= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gl.html| archivedate= 4 September 2013 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greenlandic Inuit]] (including [[mixed-race]] persons) make up approximately 85%–90% of the total (2009 estimate). 

Attracted by good employment opportunities with high wages, many Danes settled in the town of [[Nuuk]] during the 1990s. Nuuk has the highest proportion of Danes of any town in Greenland.&lt;ref name="O'HaraTrueman2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Hara|first1=Kevin|last2=Trueman|first2=Peter|title=South Greenland: An Arctic Paradise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IADE-jb692EC&amp;pg=PA222|year=2003|publisher=Kevin O'Hara|isbn=978-1-894673-12-9|pages=222–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There was continuous [[Norse colonization of Greenland|Scandinavian settlement]] in south-western Greenland from the 10th century until the 15th century. It remains unclear exactly when and how these populations eventually disappeared, but climate change appears to be the primary cause. The majority of these Medieval settlers hailed from Norway (by way of Iceland), rather than Denmark.

From 1721 onwards, the [[Danish colonization of Greenland|Danish (and Norwegian) presence]] in south-western Greenland was restored, initially in the form of seasonal trading posts and missions, rather than permanent settlements.

==Danish language==
Both [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] have been used in public affairs in Greenland since the establishment of home rule in 1979; the majority of the population can speak both languages. Kalaallisut (Greenlandic) became the sole official language in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danish is still widely used in the administration and in higher education, as well as remaining the first or only language for some Danish immigrants in Nuuk and other larger towns. A debate about the role of Kalaallisut (Greenlandic) and Danish in future society is ongoing.

About 12% of the population of Greenland speaks [[Danish language|Danish]] as a first or sole language, particularly Danish immigrants in Greenland, many of whom fill positions such as administrators, professionals, academics, or skilled tradesmen. While Greenlandic is dominant in all smaller settlements, a part of the population of Inuit or mixed ancestry, especially in towns, speaks Danish. Most of the Inuit population speaks Danish as a second language. In larger towns, especially Nuuk and in the higher social strata, this is still a large group.

Negative feelings or characterisations toward asexuality include [[dehumanisation]], the belief that asexuality is a [[mental illness]], that asexual people cannot feel love, and refusal to accept asexuality as a genuine [[sexual orientation]]. Asexuality is sometimes confused with [[celibacy]]. Anti-asexual [[hate crime]]s also exist, and asexual people may face greater amounts of [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] than those of other [[sexual minorities]].

There have been efforts to combat anti-asexual discrimination through legislation or education (such as asexual workshops).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://issuu.com/brunswickan/docs/full_paper_e64b2dff0192c0|title=LGBTQrazy: A is for…|website=The Brunswickan (University of New Brunswick)|volume=147|issue=7|date=17 October 2013|page=10|quote=It’s important to talk about asexuality because it’s often an overlooked sexual identity, and '''acephobia''' – discrimination against asexual people – is experienced by many asexual people.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joelle Ruby Ryan, "On Being Asexual and Transgender: Notes on Identity, Visibility, and Empowerment", in ''Trans Bodies, Trans Selves: A Resource for the Transgender'' (ed.

Some, such as sociologist Mark Carrigan believe that asexual discrimination is more to do with marginalisation, and that a lot of it is a result of a lack of understanding and awareness of asexuality.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Lucy Wallis |title=What is it like to be asexual? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16552173 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=17 January 2012|work=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RMC"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Maddie Wright |title=Asexual students on identity, experiences of intolerance |url=https://collegian.com/2017/10/asexual-students-on-identify-experiences-of-intolerance/ |website=The Rocky Mountain Collegian |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also controversy over the inclusion of asexuality in the LGBT and [[queer]] umbrellas, with some believing that asexuals do not experience oppression and are encroaching on the LGBT community.&lt;ref name="HP5"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dominique Mosbergen |title=LGBT, Asexual Communities Clash Over Ace Inclusion |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lgbt-asexual_n_3385530 |website=[[Huffington Post]] |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Institutionalised discrimination===

In some jurisdictions, marriages can be voided if not legitimised by [[consummation]].&lt;ref name="CS"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Elizabeth F. Emens |title=Compulsory Sexuality |url=https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1596&amp;context=faculty_scholarship |website=Columbia University |accessdate=1 December 2018 |page=351 |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been viewed as discriminatory to asexuals.&lt;ref name="ML"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sally Goldfarb |title=Divorcing Marriage from Sex:  Radically Rethinking the Role of  Sex in Marriage Law in the United States |url=http://opo.iisj.net/index.php/osls/article/viewFile/735/958 |accessdate=1 December 2018 |page=20 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sex education]] programmes in schools have also been known to discriminate against asexuals.

=== Social discrimination===
Asexuals may be socially discriminated against due to beliefs that that [[heterosexuality]] [[Heteronormativity|is the default sexuality]] or that asexuals are actually [[Homosexuality|gay or lesbian people]] in denial.&lt;ref name=HPAWW /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Nicole Wiesenthal|url=http://issuu.com/themirrormag/docs/mirror_fall2014_final_small|title=Glossary of Asexual Terms|magazine=''The Mirror''|volume=3|issue=3|date=Autumn 2014|page=19|quote=Closely linked to homophobia, biphobia, transphobia and '''acephobia"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anti-discrimination endeavours ==

In [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act]] categorises asexuals as a [[protected class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act ("SONDA") |url=http://www.ag.ny.gov//bureaus/civil_rights/sonda_brochure.html |website=Office of the Attorney General |accessdate=27 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316120639/http://www.ag.ny.gov//bureaus/civil_rights/sonda_brochure.html |archivedate=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Asexual Visibility and Education Network]] is an organisation founded in 2001 by [[David Jay]], and aims to raise awareness of asexuality,&lt;ref name="DJ"&gt;{{cite web |author1=JohnThomas Didymus |title=Asexual Visibility and Education Network marks Asexuality Day |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/348920 |website=Digital Journal |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including by getting it discussed in schools to discourage discriminatory attitudes.&lt;ref name=GSN /&gt; The [[Asexual Awareness Week]] is an organised event formed by Sarah Beth Brooks in 2010, also with the aim of raising asexual awareness and dispelling misconceptions about it.&lt;ref name="HPAWW"/&gt; There have been attempts to increase awareness of asexuality in universities.&lt;ref name="TBTS"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Erickson-Schroth |editor1-first=Laura |title=Trans Bodies, Trans Selves: A Resource for the Transgender Community |date=12 May 2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199325368 |page=367 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oZeAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA367&amp;lpg=PA367&amp;dq=acephobia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K-3bo68Kp9&amp;sig=ywhGHXlY_bZGu-jP8z0r01IBZl0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiE_M6S7freAhXJDOwKHSXjCk04UBDoATADegQIBxAB#v=onepage&amp;q=acephobia&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, United Kingdom [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[parliamentary candidate]] George Norman called for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to add asexuality to equality legislation, and to recognise that one per cent of the UK's electorate are asexual.&lt;ref name=YV /&gt;

The '''Economic Espionage Act of 1996''' ({{USStatute|104|294|110|3488|1996|10|11}}) was a 6 title [[Act of Congress|Act]] of [[United States Congress|Congress]] dealing with a wide range of issues, including not only [[industrial espionage]] (''e.g.'', the [[theft]] or [[misappropriation]] of a [[trade secret]] and the [[National Information Infrastructure Protection Act]]), but the [[insanity defense]], the [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America]], requirements for [[presentence investigation report]]s, and the [[United States Sentencing Commission]] reports regarding encryption or scrambling technology, and other technical and minor amendments.

==Protection of trade secrets==
The act makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. Unlike the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] (found at {{usc|18|792|799}}), the offense involves commercial information, not classified or national defense information.

|Definitions
|
|}

"Trade secrets" are defined in the act consistent with generally accepted legal definitions such as those used in the [[Uniform Trade Secrets Act]] and state laws based on the UTSA. Specifically it declares:

{{quote|(3) the term "trade secret" means all forms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic, or engineering information, including patterns, plans, compilations, program devices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, programs, or codes, whether tangible or intangible, and whether or how stored, compiled, or memorialized physically, electronically, graphically, photographically, or in writing if—
:(A) the owner thereof has taken reasonable measures to keep such information secret; and
:(B) the information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, the public}}

==Enforcement==

===Department of Justice policy===

The [[United States Department of Justice Criminal Division]] has issued a prosecution policy relating to enforcement of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = USAM Chapter 9-59.000 - Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. §§ 1831-1837)—Prosecutive Policy |url = http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/59mcrm.htm|publisher = [[United States Department of Justice Criminal Division]]|date = February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, it states:

{{quote|The EEA is not intended to criminalize every theft of trade secrets for which civil remedies may exist under state law. It was passed in recognition of the increasing importance of the value of intellectual property in general, and trade secrets in particular to the economic well-being and security of the United States and to close a federal enforcement gap in this important area of law. Appropriate discretionary factors to be considered in deciding whether to initiate a prosecution under § 1831 or § 1832 include: 
:(a) the scope of the criminal activity, including evidence of involvement by a foreign government, foreign agent or foreign instrumentality; 
:(b) the degree of economic injury to the trade secret owner; 
:(c) the type of trade secret misappropriated; 
:(d) the effectiveness of available civil remedies; and 
:(e) the potential deterrent value of the prosecution.

The availability of a civil remedy should not be the only factor considered in evaluating the merits of a referral because the victim of a trade secret theft almost always has recourse to a civil action. The universal application of this factor would thus defeat the Congressional intent in passing the EEA.}}

===Use of EEA===

The Act can be employed to accomplish several purposes:

:* It can be used to protect a company's valuable intellectual property by prosecuting dishonest competitors who steal a company's trade secrets, but
:* it can also be used against a company that finds itself with trade secrets belonging to a competitor.&lt;ref name = "Dorsey"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Economic Espionage Act: The Double-edged Sword |url = https://www.dorsey.com/newsresources/publications/2004/04/the-economic-espionage-act-the-doubleedged-sword|publisher = Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP|date = Spring 2004|accessdate = February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''United States v. Lange'',&lt;ref&gt;{{caselaw source |case=''United States v. Lange'', 312 F.3d 263 (7th Cir. 2002) |findlaw=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1262973.html|other_source1=resource.org|other_url1=https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/312/312.F3d.263.00-1681.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Searle|2010|pp=119{{endash}}121}} the EEA was used to protect a victim company that had learned that Lange,  a disgruntled former employee, had been offering to sell its secret manufacturing processes to third parties. The company reported Lange to the FBI, and Lange was arrested and subsequently convicted and sentenced to 30 months in prison. The case was successful in large part because the company undertook reasonable measures to keep its information secret, including:&lt;ref name = "Dorsey" /&gt;

#physically securing the trade secrets in question
#limiting the distribution of documentation describing the trade secret
#limiting the number of employees with access to the trade secret
#notifying such employees that they were working with confidential information, and placing warnings on trade secret information
#providing vendors with only partial information of the trade secret, so that it could not be replicated

The EEA has also been used to prosecute a [[Boeing]] manager, together with an employee he hired from [[Lockheed Martin]] with the offer of a higher salary in return for his inside information on Lockheed Martin's pricing.&lt;ref name = "Dorsey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''US v. Branch and Erskine'', Criminal case 2:03-CR-00715-RSWL-1 (Central District of California, filed July 17, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the EEA charges were later dropped, the matter resulted in Boeing being denied $1 billion in contracts from the [[United States Air Force]], as well as it paying a $615 million settlement to the US Government.{{sfn|Searle|2010|pp=116{{endash}}119}}

===§ 1831 - First conviction and sentence===

In February 2010, former [[Boeing]] engineer Dongfan "Greg" Chung was sentenced to 16 years in prison, following the first ever trial conviction under the 1996 Economic Espionage Act. Chung, a native of China, was convicted by the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California|US District Court for the Central District of California]] of stealing Boeing trade secrets related to the [[Space Shuttle program|US Space Shuttle program]] and the [[Delta IV]] rocket.  He spent over 30 years providing U.S. aerospace technologies to China.  Chung was convicted on charges related to more than 350,000 sensitive documents that were found concealed in crawl spaces underneath his home, including conspiracy to commit economic espionage, six counts of economic espionage to benefit a foreign country, one count of acting as an agent of the People's Republic of China, and one count of making false statements to the FBI.  The 15-year sentence is viewed as a life sentence for Chung who is 74 years old.

Chung was arrested by special agents from the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office in February 2008.  He worked for [[Rockwell International]] from 1973 until its defense and space unit was acquired by Boeing in 1996, and he continued to work for Boeing as an employee and then as a contractor through 2006. Chung's arrest resulted from an investigation into the case of [[Chi Mak]], a Chinese-American engineer convicted in 2007 of conspiring to export sensitive naval technologies to China and sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.

At Chung's sentencing, presiding judge, Cormac Carney, said that he could not "put a price tag" on national security, and that with the long sentence for Chung he wanted to send a signal to China to "stop sending your spies here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/losangeles/press-releases/2010/la020810.htm |title=Former Boeing Engineer Sentenced to Nearly 16 Years in Prison for Stealing Aerospace Secrets for China |author=United States Attorney's Office Central District of California |date= February 8, 2010|work= |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation Los Angeles |accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, Chung's conviction was upheld by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Chung'', 659 F.3d 815 (9th Cir. 2011), cert. denied, No. 11-1141, 2012 WL 929750 (U.S. Apr. 16, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= |year= 2012|title= Ninth Circuit Upholds First Trial Conviction Under § 1831 of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996|journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |volume= 125|issue= 8|pages= |publisher= [[Harvard Law School]]|doi= |pmid= |pmc= |url= https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/vol125_united_states_v_chung.pdf|accessdate=6 November 2018}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===§ 1832 - First conviction and sentence===

Most prosecutions under the Economic Espionage Act have been for violation of Section 1832 (Trade Secret Theft).  The first such prosecution was of Daniel and Patrick Worthing, maintenance workers at PPG Industries in Pennsylvania who stole blueprints and diskettes.  Both pleaded guilty  in early 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic  Collection and Industrial Espionage: 1998|url=https://www.ncsc.gov/publications/reports/fecie_all/FECIE_1998.pdf|website=National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC)|publisher=Office of the Director of National Intelligence|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For another example, see the first conviction in California, that of David Brian Kern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01611190008984254|title=David Brian Kern: Theft of Trade Secrets |publisher=Cryptologia |year=2000 |first=Russell |last=Atkinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an August, 2007 plea of guilt for (one count) of violating the Economic Espionage Act and one count of violating the [[Arms Export Control Act]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] U.S. District Court [[Judge]] Jeremy Fogel sentenced [[Canadians|Canadian]] citizen Xiaodong Sheldon Meng, 44, to 24 months in [[federal prison]], 3 years of [[parole]] and a $10,000 fine, with forfeiture of computer equipment seized. Meng was indicted in December 2006, with 36 counts, "for stealing military software from a [[Silicon Valley]] defense contractor and trying to sell it to the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese military]]." The first to be convicted of Economic Espionage (Section 1831), Meng admitted "illegally obtaining a program used for military training from [[Quantum3D]] and later using the program in a demonstration to the [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] after he no longer worked for the firm; he attempted to sell the fighter-pilot training software programs to the [[Royal Thai Air Force]], the [[Royal Malaysian Air Force]] and the Navy Research Center in China." He paid $500,000 bond, for temporary liberty, until August 18 when he begins serving sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Salesman-gets-2-years-for-industrial-spying-3209681.php |publisher=Sfgate.com |title=Salesman gets 2 years for industrial spying |first=John |last=Coté |date=June 19, 2008 |accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5g1-Ie0sO9j4dfzcDflZEP8lyeX5wD91COKDG2   Afp.google.com, Engineer is first sentenced for economic espionage]&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

On June 18, 2008, Meng was the first individual sentenced under the Economic Espionage statute. Meng was the first person convicted of both the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 and the [[Arms Export Control Act]].

==Further developments==

===Intersection with trade law===

The [[International Trade Commission]] has used the EEA's definition of misappropriation to support its enforcement of US trade laws that prohibit "unfair methods of competition and unfair acts in the importation of articles ... in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Combating Trade Secret Theft Abroad through Legal Action at Home|author = Michael Strapp|url = http://www.goodwinprocter.com/Publications/Attorney-Articles/2012/Combating-Trade-Secret-Theft-Abroad.aspx|publisher = Executive Counsel|date =April–May 2012|accessdate = February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Tianrui Group Company Limited LLC v International Trade Commission'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] held that the manufacture abroad of products using a process that was developed in the United States, protected under domestic trade secret law, and misappropriated abroad, violated section 337 of the [[Tariff Act of 1930]], {{usc|19|1337}}. The ITC therefore had the authority to bar the importation of such products into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''In the Matter of Certain Cast Steel Railway Wheels, Processes for Manufacturing or Relating to Same and Certain Products Containing Same ; Issuance of a Limited Exclusion Order and Cease and Desist Orders; Termination of the Investigation''|url = https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/02/23/2010-3421/in-the-matter-of-certain-cast-steel-railway-wheels-processes-for-manufacturing-or-relating-to-same|publisher = ''[[Federal Register]]''|date = February 23, 2010|accessdate = February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{caselaw source |case=''Tianrui Group Company Limited LLC v International Trade Commission'', 661 F.3d 1322 (Fed.

===Scope of trade secrets===

The extent to which trade secrets are covered under § 1832 was expanded in 2012, following the reversal of a conviction in April 2012 by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] in ''United States v. [[Sergey Aleynikov|Aleynikov]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://https |title=''United States v. Aleynikov'', 676 F.3d 71, 75 (2d Cir. 2012) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711041720/http://https/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-11 |df= }} Reversing ''United States v. Aleynikov'', 737 F. Supp. 2d 173 (S.D.N.Y. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, it was held that the theft of the source code for a proprietary system at [[Goldman Sachs]] was never intended to be placed in interstate or foreign commerce. As Goldman had no intention of selling or licensing its system, § 1832 (as it was written at that time) did not apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Recent amendment to the Economic Espionage Act extends protection against misappropriation |first1=James J. |last1=Elacqua |first2=Douglas |last2=Nemec |first3=P. Anthony |last3=Sammi |first4=Daniel A. |last4=DeVito |first5=Stacey L. |last5=Cohen |url=http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/Insight/2013/02_-_February/Recent_amendment_to_the_Economic_Espionage_Act_extends_protection_against_misappropriation/ |publisher=Thomson Reuters |accessdate=February 27, 2013 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217012313/http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/Insight/2013/02_-_February/Recent_amendment_to_the_Economic_Espionage_Act_extends_protection_against_misappropriation/ |archive-date=February 17, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The provision was promptly amended on December 28, 2012 with the passage of the Theft of Trade Secrets Clarification Act of 2012, so that it now applies to products or services that are used or intended for use in interstate or foreign commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Theft of Trade Secrets Clarification Act of 2012, {{uspl|112|236}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment led to a conviction in ''[[United States v. Agrawal]]''.

===Expansion of penalties===

On January 24, 2013, § 1831 was amended to increase the maximum fines:

:* in the case of individuals, from $500,000 to $5,000,000, and
:* in the case of organizations, from $10,000,000 to "the greater of $10,000,000 or 3 times the value of the stolen trade secret to the organization."&lt;ref&gt;Foreign and Economic Espionage Penalty Enhancement Act of 2012, {{uspl|112|269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil cause of action===
On May 11, 2016, in what ''[[Forbes]]'' called "the single most important intellectual property development since Congress enacted the [[America Invents Act]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericgoldman/2016/04/28/the-new-defend-trade-secrets-act-is-the-biggest-ip-development-in-years/|title=The New 'Defend Trade Secrets Act' Is The Biggest IP Development In Years|journal=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]|date=April 28, 2016|first=Eric|last=Goldman}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Defend Trade Secrets Act]] ({{USPL|114|153}}) expanded the EEA's reach. In cases filed after that date:

:* {{USCSub|18|1836|b}} is replaced to provide for private civil actions, including (subject to appropriate safeguards) ''[[ex parte]]'' orders "providing for the seizure of property necessary to prevent the propagation or dissemination of the trade secret that is the subject of the action." Remedies available to the court include the granting of injunctions, awarding of damages (including [[treble damages]] in cases of wilful and malicious misappropriation) and the awarding of costs in cases where the claim was made in bad faith.
:* {{USCSub|18|1832|b}} is amended to provide for criminal fines to be the greater of $5,000,000 or three times the trade secret's value (including any reproduction costs that the holder of the trade secret has avoided).
:* {{USCSub|18|1961|1}} is amended to include {{USC|18|1831|1832}} in the [[RICO]] list of predicate offences signifying [[racketeering]] activity.
:* {{USC|18|1833}} is amended to provide for [[whistleblower protection]] for an individual who makes a confidential disclosure to a government official in cases of a suspected violation of the law, or files a sealed document to the court with respect to an antiretaliation lawsuit. As a reinforcing measure, employers are required to include a notice of such immunity in any [[employment agreement]] that governs trade secrets and other [[confidential information]].

==Impact of the Act==

This legislation has created much debate within the [[business intelligence]] community regarding the legality and ethics of various forms of information gathering designed to provide business decision-makers with competitive advantages in areas such as strategy, marketing, research and development, or negotiations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Most business intelligence (also known as [[competitive intelligence]] practitioners) rely largely on the collection and analysis of [[open source information]] from which they identify events, patterns, and trends of actionable interest. However, some techniques focus on the collection of publicly available information that is in limited circulation. This may be obtained through a number of direct and indirect techniques that share common origins in the national intelligence community. The use of these techniques is often debated from legal and ethical standpoints based on this Act.

One such example is the collection and analysis of [[gray literature]]. The techniques for developing actionable intelligence from limited circulation / limited availability documents such as selected corporate publications can raise difficult legal and ethical questions under both intellectual property laws and the Economic Espionage Act.

The [[Society for Competitive Intelligence Professionals]] provides training and publications which outline a series of guidelines designed to support business intelligence professionals seeking to comply with both the legal restrictions of the EEA as well as the ethical considerations involved.  In 1999, the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals published its ''Policy Analysis on Competitive Intelligence and the Economic Espionage Act'' which explained how the Economic Espionage Act will not affect legitimate competitive intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhesq.com/CI/SCIP%20EEA%20Policy%20Analysis.pdf ''Society of Competitive Intelligence Policy Analysis on Competitive Intelligence and the Economic Espionage Act, written by Richard Horowitz, Esq.'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''National Law Journal'' of March 29, 2000, reviewed the Policy Analysis and reported that the Policy Analysis' conclusion was that the EEA's "impact on legitimate competitive intelligence would be negligible" and that "nearly four years" after the EEA's passage, "it appears that the [Policy Analysis'] predictions were on target."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhesq.com/CI/National%20Law%20Journal.pdf  Industry Spying Still Flourishes; Criminalizing Trade Secret Theft Hasn't Led to Mass Proseuctions," National Law Journal, March 29, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

The EEA was developed on the basis of a national philosophy that emphasizes a "level playing field" for all business competitors that arose in no small part due to the size and diversity of the American [[private sector]]. Many other nations not only lack such legislation, but actively support [[industrial espionage]] using both their national intelligence services as well as less formal mechanisms including [[bribery]] and [[Corporate corruption|corruption]]. The United States [[Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive]] publishes an annual report on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage mandated by the U.S. Congress which outlines these espionage activities of many foreign nations.

The United States does not engage in state-sanctioned industrial espionage. In 2000, in response to European concerns, a former U.S. Director of Central Intelligence, James Woolsy, said (in the March 17, 2000 Wall Street Journal editorial) that if there is collection, it's usually focused on [[bribery]] by European companies, not on access to technologies.  Woolsey said "most European technology just isn't worth our stealing." As DCI, Woolsey testified before Congress  that he was reluctant to engage in economic espionage as the endeavor is "fraught with complexities, legal difficulties (and) foreign policy difficulties."

In 2000, the [[European Parliament]] voted to carry out an investigation into the international surveillance project [[ECHELON]]. That same year the French government also began an official investigation into allegations that several collaborating nations may be using the program for illegal purposes. U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] documents had been revealed to the British press, showing that the U.S. has been using the technology to monitor European business communications. The French and European allegations centered on the suspicion that such information was being passed to U.S. firms.  The U.S. stated that monitoring was focused on the participation of European firms in supplying foreign WMD (weapons of mass destruction) programs, such as the Iran nuclear program, on evading sanctions in Iran and Libya, and on the bribery of foreign officials, such as French payments to Saudi Defense officials.

The '''European Federation for Animal Science''' or '''EAAP''' ({{lang-fr|'''Fédération Européenne de Zootechnie'''|italic=no}}; {{lang-de|'''Europäische Vereinigung für Tierproduktion'''|italic=no}}; {{lang-it|'''Federazione Europea di Zootecnia'''|italic=no}} [sic])&lt;ref name=stat/&gt; is an international [[non-governmental organisation]] which aims to improve the farming of [[domestic animals]]. Membership is open to scientists, animal breeders and administrators. The association was founded in Paris in 1949, and has its headquarters in [[Rome]], Italy.&lt;ref name=john/&gt; It was formerly known as the '''European Association for Animal Production'''.

Together with the [[British Society of Animal Science]] and the [[Institut national de la recherche agronomique]], it issues the [[academic journal]] [[Animal (journal)|''Animal'']], published by the [[Cambridge University Press]].

== History and purpose ==

The association was founded in Paris during the 5th [[International Congress on Animal Production]]. The inaugural meeting was held on 8 November 1949. Although the association was intended to be European in scope, the founding member countries were Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Morocco, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and Tunisia,&lt;ref name=john/&gt; and thus included parts of both Africa and Asia. 

The declared aim of the association is to:{{quote|"promote the improvement, organization and enlightened practice of animal production by scientific research, the application of science and co-operation between the national animal production organisations, scientists and practitioners of member countries".&lt;ref name=john/&gt;}}

The '''General Federation of Women's Clubs Headquarters''', also known as the '''Miles Mansion''', is a social clubhouse headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]].  Built as a private residence in 1875, it has served as the headquarters of the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]] (GFWC) since 1922.  It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1991 for its association with the federation, which serves as an umbrella organization for women's clubs, a social movement dating to the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: General Federation of Women's Clubs Headquarters|url={{NHLS url|id=91002057}} |format=pdf|date=June 6, 1991 |author=Page Putnam Miller and Jill S. Topolski |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NHLS url|id=91002057|title=''Accompanying  photos, exterior, from 1989''|photos=y}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(32&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tours of the headquarters, available by appointment, provide information about the activities of the GFWC and several historic rooms, including the 1734 entryway, the [[Julia Ward Howe]] Drawing Room, the dining room, music room and the GFWC International President's office.  The headquarters also features changing exhibits of art, photographs and artifacts from its collections.

==Description and building history==
The GFWC headquarters is located southeast of [[Dupont Circle]], on the south side of N Street between St. Matthew's Court and 17th Street.  It is a four-story masonry structure, built out of ashlar stone in a Renaissance Revival style.  The entrance is in a slightly raised basement level, sheltered by a splayed glass and iron marquee with supporting ironwork brackets.  The main floor windows are elongated, with paired casement windows topped by transoms, and keystoned lintels.  A polygonal bay projects from the first two floors on the left, and a shallower rectangular one projects to the right of the entrance; both are topped by lower balustrades.  The interior has been adapted for the GFWC's use, but retains some original finishes.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;

The house was built in 1875 by Rear Admiral [[William Radford]], at a time when the Dupont Circle area was being developed as a fashionable residential neighborhood.  In 1895 he sold the house to the state of [[Massachusetts]], which gave it to General [[Nelson A. Miles]] in recognition for his military service. It was next owned by John Jay White, a big-game hunter who traveled with [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and who commissioned the murals by [[Albert Herter]] that adorn some of its walls.  In 1922 the house was purchased by the GFWC for use as its headquarters, a role it continues to play today.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;

The GFWC represents the culmination of smaller-scale women's organizations that sprang up in the 19th century, generally to improve the conditions for working and single women.  It was the first nationwide organization of this type, enabling a broader scope of influence by these local and regional organizations.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;

'''Gha-Mu''' (''Small Flowery Miao'', ''Blue Hmong'') are an ethnic group in [[China]]. They are from [[Guizhou]] and belong to the [[Hmong people]]. Many of them are Christians. The number of persons within this group likely exceeds 100,000. Their language is the [[Hmong language]] [[Small Flowery Miao]]; [[Large Flowery Miao]] is another, of the [[A-Hmao]].

The [[Greek diaspora]] in what became the [[South Sudan|Republic of South Sudan]] in 2011 is tiny in numbers - estimated at around 90 - but historically played an important role and has some prominent members, especially [[First Lady]] [[Mary Ayen Mayardit]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Greek community in Sudan (19th-21st cen.)|last=Chaldeos|first=Antonis|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9786188233454|location=Athens|pages=29; 111–116; 130–137; 147–155;177; 210; 221–223; 242–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear when the first inter-human and cultural exchange between Hellenic and Southern Sudanese civilisations took place. However, since Greek contacts with the [[Nubia]]n kingdoms of Northern Sudan have been established going back more than two and a half millenia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the Sudan|last=Kramer|first=Robert|last2=Lobban|first2=Richard|last3=Fluehr-Lobban|first3=Carolyn|publisher=The Scarecrow Press|year=2013|isbn=9780810861800|edition= 4th|location=Lanham / Toronto / Plymouth (UK)|pages=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; it may well be argued that through Southern Sudanese exchanges with Nubia there were at least indirect relations since ancient times. Scholars in [[Ancient Greece]] were evidently inspired with curiosity about the exotic lands further South and particularly about the [[Nile|sources of the River Nile]]. Most prominently, the pioneering historian [[Herodotus]] (c. 484-c. 425 BCE) made bizarre references to a savage land of the "burnt faces" ([[Aethiopia|Aithiopia]]).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Biographical Dictionary of the Sudan|last=Hill|first=Richard Leslie|publisher=Frank Cass &amp; Co.|year=1967|isbn=0714610372|edition= 2nd|location=London|pages=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Hellenic culture continued to inspire and influence the Nubian kingdoms of [[Nobatia|Nobadia]], [[Makuria]] and [[Alwah|Alwa]] in medieval times,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Short History of the Sudan (Up to A.D. 1500)|last=Shinnie|first=Margaret|publisher=Sudan Antiquities Service|year=|isbn=|location=Khartoum|pages=8|via=Sudan Open Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; it may likewise be argued that indirect contacts between Southern Sudanese societies and the Greek world may well have to continued through Nubia. Before migrating to their modern location the South Sudanese [[Dinka people]] lived in close proximity to Alwa, a relation confirmed by the considerable impact the [[Nubian language]] had on the [[Dinka language|Dinka vacabulary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephanie |last=Beswick |year=2004 |title=Sudan's Blood Memory |publisher=University of Rochester |isbn=1580462316 |p=21 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Turkish-Egyptian forces of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Khedive]] [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohamed Ali]] conquered the [[Funj Sultanate|Funj kingdom]] in 1821, the invading army reportedly included Greek mercenaries of [[Arvanites|Arvanite]] origin - who helped pave the. way for the subsequent conquest of Southern Sudanese lands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As more Greeks followed the invaders from Egypt into Northern Sudan, some of them guided expeditions further southward. Greek merchants, who ventured South, were mainly interest in dealing with [[ivory]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaldeos|first=Antonios|date=2017|title=Sudanese toponyms related to Greek entrepreneurial activity|url=http://digitalcommons.fairfield.edu/djns/vol4/iss1/4|journal=Dotawo: A Journal of Nubian Studies|volume=4: Art. 1.|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their number and commercial activity greatly increased after the monopoly of trade was abolished in 1849 and the [[White Nile]] was opened for navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caravan trade and routes in the northern Sudan in the 19th century: a study in historical geography.|last=Ahmed|first=Hassan Abdel Aziz|publisher=Durham University|year=1967|isbn=|location=Durham|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some also became involved in the trade of [[Slavery|slaves]], which devastated large parts of Southern Sudan until the 1870s. The Greek historian Antonios Chaldeos, who has written his PhD thesis about the history of the Greek communities in Sudan, strongly suggests from the local histories of Omdurman residents that one of those slave-traders was [[George Averoff]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; who is still widely considered a "''philanthropist''" and "''one of the great national benefactors of Greece''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Averoff|title=George Averoff|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikipedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Omdurman]] quarter of Abu Ruf is still today named after Averoff.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:PanayotisPotagos.jpg|thumb|Panayotis Potagos]]
Other Greeks did not come to Southern Sudan for commercial reasons though. For instance, Giuseppina Tabraui, a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] missionary sister from a [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Greek Catholic]] family in [[Tiberias]], accompanied Bishop [[Daniele Comboni]] in 1871 and was the first mother superior of the mission to Central Africa. And [[Panayotis Potagos]], a Greek traveller and physician, explored [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr El Ghazal]] in 1876-77.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== [[Mahdist State|Mahdiya]] (1885-1898) ===
After the 1885 victory of the indigenous Northern Sudanese [[Mahdi|Mahdist movement]] over the Egyptian-Turkish rule, the [[Islamism|Islamists]] also took control of most of what is now South Sudan, but held on to it rather loosely - which prompted [[Imperialism|imperialist]] [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[France|French]] missions into Southern Sudan. It may have been in this context that in 1895 a Greek merchant by the name of Grigoris Apostolidis became active in Sambi on the While Nile. He originated from [[Imbros|Imvros]] and after a few years moved on to open a shop [[Yirol]]. He got married to a local woman and had two sons with her.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Africa 1909, Edward Hertslet (Lado enclave, detail).jpg|left|thumb|1909 map of Southern Sudan with the Lado Enclave]]

Soon after the defeat of the Mahdist regime and the subsequent [[Fashoda Incident|Fashoda incident]] in 1898, the British-dominated colonial regime started establishing control in Southern Sudan. At the same time, Greek merchants once again followed the invaders. The most important player in those early years was [[Business magnate|business-magnate]] [[Angelo Capato]], who hailed from the [[Ionian Islands|Ionian island]] of [[Cephalonia]] and had been supplying the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy|Navy]] in the [[Red Sea]] port town of [[Suakin]] since 1883.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makris|first=Gerasimos|last2=Stiansen|first2=Endre|date=April 1998|title=ANGELO CAPATO: A GREEK TRADER IN THE SUDAN|url=http://www.sssuk.org/drupalSite/sites/default/files/sudanStudies/SS21.pdf|journal=SUDAN STUDIES|publisher=Sudan Studies Society of the United Kingdom (SSSUK)|volume=21|pages=10–18|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held British nationality and was particularly close with [[Governor-general|Governor-General]] [[Reginald Wingate]]:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"''around 1900, the government granted him, against a promise to supply the [[Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes|expeditionary force]] with necessary provisions, the [[monopoly]] (for two or three years?) of the ivory trade in [[Equatoria]]''"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Chaldeos, Capato also received such an exceptional license doing ivory trade in [[Bor, South Sudan|Bor]]. Another focus of his commercial activities was the region of Bahr El Ghazal. He set up a network of trading-posts across Southern Sudan to collect ivory and cater to colonial officials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For these enterprises he mainly recruited Greek agents, preferably from his home island of Cephalonia and especially from his family there.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; His business empire soon expanded into the Belgian-controlled Congo Free State,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pionniers méconnus du Congo Belge|last=Antippas|first=Georges|publisher=éditions Masoin|year=2008|isbn=|location=Bruxelles|pages=54–57|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby he contributed to the creation of a [[Greeks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Greek commuity in Congo]] that still exists today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/61581/article/ekathimerini/comment/january-21-1959|title=GREEKS IN THE CONGO|last=Katsigeras|first=Michalis|date=21 January 2009|website=ekathimerini.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capato's agents also provided information about the Belgian-controlled [[Lado Enclave]] to the [[British intelligence agencies|British intelligence]] officers in Khartoum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/1761/|title=Knowing authority : colonial governance and local community in Equatoria Province, Sudan, 1900-1956|last=Leonardi|first=Cherry|publisher=Durham University|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Capato after a string of misfortunes - amongst them a fire that destroyed his storehouse in [[Gondokoro]] - had to declare bankruptcy in 1912,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; many of his agents continued the business on their own. The colonial government supported this immigration as it preferred giving licences to Greek, [[Jews|Jewish]], and [[Syrians|Syrian]] merchants, rather than to Northern Sudanese "Jellaba" traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bonds of Silk: The Human Factor in the British Administration of the Sudan|last=Deng|first=Francis Mading|last2=Daly|first2=M.

In the region of [[Greater Upper Nile|Upper Nile]], a few Greeks settled in [[Malakal]], [[Bor, South Sudan|Bor]] - which was a center of ivory trade - and [[Taufikia]]. In [[Equatoria]], some Greeks - mostly ivory traders, but also a few contractors, engineers and employees - settled in [[Maridi]], [[Yambio]], [[Tambura, South Sudan|Tambura]], [[Nzara, South Sudan|Nzara]], [[Li Yubu, South Sudan|Li Yubu]], [[Ezo, South Sudan|Ezo]], [[Yei, South Sudan|Yei]], and [[Mongalla, South Sudan|Mongalla]]. The greatest number of Greeks, however, settled in Bahr El Ghazal, mainly in its commercial centre [[Wau, South Sudan|Wau]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; where in 1910 fifteen Greek merchants were reported to make large profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Impact of Change Agents on Southern Sudan History, ١٨٩٨ – ١٩٧٣.|last=Ding|first=Daniel Thabo Nyibong|publisher=Institute of African and Asian Studies Graduate College University of Khartoum|year=2005|isbn=|location=Khartoum|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Comboni Missionaries of the Heart of Jesus|Comboni]] missionary priest Stefano Santandrea, who served in Wau from 1928 to 1948 and then until 1955 in [[Deim Zubeir]], stressed though that "''their competition prevented their [Northern] rivals from exploiting the natives''."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://sudanarchive.net/cgi-bin/pagessoa?a=pdf&amp;d=Dnbd1.1.1&amp;dl=1&amp;sim=Screen2Image|title=A popular history of Wau: (Bahr el Ghazal - Sudan) from its foundation to about 1940|last=Santandrea|first=Stefano|publisher=|year=1977|isbn=|location=Rome|pages=46, 71|via=Sudan Open Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others went to set up shops in more remote places of the region, like [[Aweil, South Sudan|Aweil]], Deim Zubeir, [[Kossinga, South Sudan|Kossinga]], [[Meshra er Req, South Sudan|Meshra er Req]], [[Raga, South Sudan|Raga]], [[Rumbek]] and [[Tonj]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some soon went on to settle in the [[Belgian Congo]], [[French Equatorial Africa|French Central Africa]] and other African lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fefopoulou|first=Alexandra|date=March 2016|title=The role of the Greek Orthodox religion in the construction of ethnic identity among the Greek community of Lubumbashi, DRC|url=https://journals.co.za/content/journal/10520/EJC-755bf100e|journal=Proceedings Ekklesiastikos Pharos|volume= 2014| issue = 1|pages=116|via=Sabinet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Juba]] - next to Gondokoro - was developed in the 1920s as the new capital of Mongalla province, "''Greeks and Cypriots played a significant role, which is especially evident in brick architecture that are found around Juba's urban center.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakao|first=Shuichiro|date=2013|title=A History from Below: Malakia in Juba, South Sudan, c. 1927-1954|url=https://www.academia.edu/6864283/Nakao_Shuichiro_2013_A_History_from_Below_Malakia_in_Juba_South_Sudan_c._1927-1954_The_Journal_of_Sophia_Asian_Studies_31_pp._139-160|journal=The Journal of Sophia Asian Studies|volume=31|pages=139–160|via=Academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, when there were about forty Greeks living in Juba, they founded the Hellenic Community Juba with the intention to set up a Greek-Orthodox church and a school. [[Gerasimos Contomichalos]], a nephew of Capato's and the most eminent [[business magnate]] in Sudan, made a substantial donation to the association. Fund-raising for the church building took until 1951 though, when Stelios Roussos made a large donation. In honour of the benefactor the church was named after [[Stylianos of Paphlagonia|St. Stylianos]] and opened in 1954.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Hai Jalaba area of Juba became known as the Greek quarter of town. There were two social clubs by that time.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=July 2010|title=The 146th tribe of Sudan|url=https://unmis.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/insudan-july-en-web3.pdf|journal=InSUDAN|publisher=UNMIS|volume=|pages=14–15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Wau, where about fifty Greeks were living in the late 1930s, the Greek Community of Bahr El Ghazal was founded in 1939. It got granted by the authorities a plot of land, where the community started to construct building that were rented out in order to create a sustainable revenue source for the association. Accordingly, the construction of other buildings was postponed and the Church of [[Elijah|Prophet Elias]] - named after the benefactor Elias Papoutsidis - only opened in 1955. At that time, the community had about 65 members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Republic of Sudan (1956-2011) ===
While the Greeks in Southern Sudan seem to have continued to prosper in the first few years after Sudan's independence, a sign of increasing instability occurred in 1960, when many of them gave refuge to Greeks who fled the [[Congo Crisis]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Just a few years later they themselves came under pressure, as the [[Anyanya]]-[[insurgency]] escalated across the Southern Sudanese region from 1963 on: after a rebel assault on Wau in early 1964, the military regime of [[Ibrahim Abboud]] reportedly “''announced that foreign traders would only be allowed to reside in provincial or district capitals in the South, where they could be kept under surveillance, and not in villages. This restriction was aimed at Syrian and Greek traders, who were suspected of helping the rebels.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sudan, Civil War and Terrorism, 1956-99|last=O'Balance|first=Edgar|publisher=Springer|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards, four Greek merchants were taken to court for charges of having collected donations for the insurgents, but got acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/04/archives/29-jailed-and-34-acquitted-in-sudan-terrorist-trials.html|title=29 Jailed and 34 Acquitted In Sudan Terrorist Trials|last=Reuters|first=|date=March 4, 1964|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1964 two Greek traders in Bahr Al-Ghazal and Equatoria respectively were arrested on charges of acting as a link between rebels and the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=1965 Mideast Mirror. 17|last=|first=|date=|work=Arab News Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, an internal Anyanya paper claimed that "''Greek merchants of Tembura helped by providing supplies''” to a rebel camp in the [[Central African Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manuscript on the history of the first civil war in South Sudan (Anya-Nya)|last=McCall|first=Storrs|publisher=Sudan Open Archive|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, two grandsons of Dimitri Yaloris, a Greek formerly based in [[Gogrial]], and his Dinka wife, were killed in Bahr El Ghazal after being accused of supporting the Anyanya rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://southernsudan.prm.ox.ac.uk/details/2005.51.485/index.html|title=Greek merchant's shop, Gogrial|last=Nadin|first=Alex|date=2005|website=Collections from Southern Sudan at the Pitt Rivers Museum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chaledos, they were targeted by the army in a special operation, since they had indeed supplied arms to the insurgents through their enterprise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Moreover, the Greeks of Southern Sudan, many of whom had married locals, came under pressure from both warring sides: while the accusations from Khartoum continued,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=War and Peace in Sudan: A Tale of Two Countries|last=Khalid|first=Mansour|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern opposition forces accused Greek monopolists of keeping the prices of animals “''as low as possible to their own advantage''" for export to the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=17 February 1965|title=Negritude and Progress|url=|journal=Voice of Southern Sudan|publisher=Sudan African National Union|volume=II (4)|pages=|via=Sudan Open Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Greek community in the South further diminished during the 1960s,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; after its numbers had already decreased in the years before 1956.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In Bahr El Ghazal, many Greeks left from smaller towns and moved to the provincial capital Wau with its established community premises.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Agarik in Modern Sudan - A Narration Dedicated to Niania-Pa and Mahmoud Salih|last=Tsakos|first=Alexandros|work=Connecting South and North.

On the other hand, the Greeks in Southern Sudan seemed to be more resilient than the Greeks in what was then Northern Sudan, where the big exodus started in 1969 with the regime of [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] and its nationalisation policies. Reportedly up to 90% of the Greeks in the South had married locals, whereas such relationships used to be very rare in the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ekirikas.com/%CE%BF%CE%B9-300-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%BB%CE%B5%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%AF%CE%B4%CE%B1-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF-%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%8D%CE%BC-%CE%B7-%CE%B5%CE%BA-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CF%80/|title=300 του Λεωνίδα" στο Χαρτούμ, εκ Πλωμαρίου σύζυγος πρόεδρου και ο Ελληνικός Σύλλογος|last=Hadjigeorgiou|first=Georgia|date=February 16, 2017|website=The National Herald|language=Greek|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it may be argued that the descendants of bi-cultural couples were more rooted in Southern Sudan.

However, the Norwegian-Greek historian Alexandros Tsakos concludes that the relationship between the "''class''" of "''pure''" Greeks and those of "''mixed blood''", "''who sarcastically call themselves'' bazramit ''– 'the half-castes''' ", has historically not just been "''fruitful''", but also "''difficult''". He illustrates this through a biographical portray of Photini Poulou-Maistrelli's life as a "''paradigm''" for the latter. Poulou was born in Aweil to a Greek father and a [[Kresh people|Kreish]] mother from Raja in 1923. She spent most of her life in Wau and married a Greek merchant, but got into ever-growing feuds both with other Bazramit and the community in Khartoum: for her and the descendants of other intermarriages "''the main issue is to be recognized as Greek''."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Little is known about how the Greek community recovered after the 1972 [[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)|Addis Ababa Agreement]] and the establishment of the [[Southern Sudan Autonomous Region (1972–83)|Southern Sudan Autonomous Region]]. Nicholas Ghines, who followed two uncles to settle in Equator in 1947 and set up a transport business, opened a safari hunting company in 1972.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 1994, the Hellenic Community of Khartoum took over the properties of the inactive communities in the South: the club and church in Juba were leased to the Catholic Archdiocese. "''The same happened in Wau.''" However, when some Greeks returned to Wau in 1995, they managed to regain the community's estates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the Greek Community of Juba registered officially again.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2015, "''the Divine Liturgy was celebrated for the first time after 38 years in St. Stylianos church in downtown Juba, by Metropolitan Narkissos of Nubia''." Narkissos also laid the foundation stone for a new missionary center in Mongalla.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://orthodoxmission.org.gr/2015/01/revival-orthodoxy-south-sudan/|title=Revival of Orthodoxy in South Sudan|last=|first=|date=13 January 2015|website=Orthodox Missionary Fraternity|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek Orthodox Church (Patriarchate Alexandria) is  a member of the South Sudan Council of Churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/africa/south-sudan/sscc|title=South Sudan Council of Churches|last=|first=|date=|website=oikoumene|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Groupe Feministe Socialiste''' was founded in 1899 by [[Louise Saumoneau]] and Elisabeth Renaud, both working class socialists who wished to bring [[feminism]] to the working class in France. The socialist movement and the feminist movement both existed, but had little overlap prior to this point.

==History==
Over four million French women were working outside the home in non-agricultural labor at the turn of the century, but they lacked representation in the organized reform efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, Marilyn J., and Jean H. Quataert, eds. ''Socialist Women: European Socialist Feminism in The Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries''. New York: Elsevier North-Holland, 1978. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Groupe Feministe Socialiste'' hoped to provide a place for representation of working class women.

The original manifesto of the ''Groupe Feministe Socialiste'' stated that they wanted to end the "double oppression of women, exploited on a large scale by capitalism, subject to men by laws and especially by prejudice."&lt;ref&gt;French, Marilyn. "Part One: The Twentieth Century- Revolution." ''From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women''. New York: Feminist at the City University of New York, 2008. 41-43&lt;/ref&gt;

The group gained popularity quickly, but it suffered from disinterest from male socialists as well as class conflict between the bourgeois and proletariat feminists.

A good example of this class conflict can be seen in the suggestion made at a 1900 convention that domestic servants receive a full day off per week, a measure already adapted for industrial workers. Bourgeois feminists hesitated. While "humanitarian enough to accept reforms in principle, they balked when such reforms threatened their way of life."&lt;ref&gt;Sowerwine, Charles. ''Sisters or Citizens?: Women and Socialism in France Since 1876''. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1982. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Groupe Feministe Socialiste'' experienced some strife in the form of conflict between its two founders, who had had their differences from the beginning. Elisabeth Renaud's goals were conciliatory; she hoped to bridge the gap between socialism and bourgeois feminism. Louise Saumoneau, on the other hand, hated the bourgeois feminists, feeling that they were irrevocably out of touch with the realities of the working class.

In 1902, Renaud left the party, leaving Saumoneau to run the party. The ''Groupe Feministe Socialiste'' survived until 1905, when the various socialist groups currently existing in France unified, leaving the ''GFS'' outside of the newly formed ''Section Francaise de L'Internationale Ouvriere''. That combined with Saumoneau's "uncompromising" stance, spelled the demise of the ''Groupe Feministe Socialiste''.&lt;ref&gt;French, Marilyn. "Part One: The Twentieth Century- Revolution." ''From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women''. New York: Feminist at the City University of New York, 2008. 41-43&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gweno''' is a [[Bantu language]] spoken in the [[Pare Mountains|North Pare Mountains]] in the [[Kilimanjaro Region]] of [[Tanzania]]. The people known as the Gweno (or more properly ''Asu''&lt;ref name="Phillipson"&gt;{{cite web|title = Gweno, a little known Bantu language of Northern Tanzania|url = http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/fulltext/Philippson/Philippson_2000.pdf|publisher = CNWS Publications|last = Phillipson|first = Gerard|last2 = Nurse|first2 = Derek}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are a [[Chaga]] ethnic and linguistic group. Since the Chaga people are [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] speakers, the adopted language contains dialects similar to that of the Kenyan language [[Kamba language|Kamba]]. Gweno shares about 54% to 56% of its vocabulary with other Chaga dialects and 46% with Taita dialects. However, a large percentage of its vocabulary is not seen in the other dialects.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=10500&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Gweno: UNESCO-CI|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also at the start of the 11th century, the Chaga people descended and migrated from the Bantu group in which they migrated to the foothills of mount Kilimanjaro. The Gweno language is today spoken mostly by older adults, with younger generations having shifted to [[Pare language|Asu]] and [[Swahili language|Swahili]].&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; ''Ethnologue'' considers Gweno to be moribund;&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; the language is not being passed down because children have not been exposed to Gweno since the 1970s.&lt;ref name="unesco.org" /&gt; The generational shift from Gweno to either Asu or Swahili has certainly created shifts in dialect, however Gweno speakers do not see this as a threat.&lt;ref name="Phillipson" /&gt;

'''Industrial and organizational psychology''' ('''I/O psychology'''), which is also known as occupational psychology, organizational psychology, and work and organizational psychology, is an applied discipline within [[psychology]]. I/O psychology is the science of human behaviour relating to work and applies psychological theories and principles to organizations and individuals in their places of work as well as the individual's work-life more generally.&lt;ref&gt;Truxillo, D. M., Bauer, T. N., &amp; Erdogan, B. (2016).  Psychology and Work:  Perspectives on Industrial and Organizational Psychology.  New York:  Psychology Press-Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; I/O [[psychologist]]s are trained in the [[scientist–practitioner model]]. They contribute to an organization's success by improving the performance, [[motivation]], [[job satisfaction]], and [[occupational safety and health]] as well as the overall [[health]] and [[well-being]] of its employees.  An I/O psychologist conducts research on employee behaviours and attitudes, and how these can be improved through hiring practices, training programs, feedback, and management systems.&lt;ref&gt;''Building Better Organizations'' Brochure published by the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology. Retrieved from [http://www.siop.org/visibilitybrochure/memberbrochure.aspx SIOP.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, I/O psychology is one of the 16 recognized specialties by the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apa.org/ed/graduate/specialize/recognized.aspx |title=Recognized Specialties and Proficiencies in Professional Psychology |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=American Psychological Association |publisher=American Psychological Association |access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is represented by Division 14 of the APA, and was formally known as the [[Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology]] (SIOP). In the United Kingdom, industrial and organizational psychologists are referred to as occupational psychologists. Occupational psychology in the UK is one of nine 'protected titles' within the profession "practitioner psychologist" regulated by the [[Health and Care Professions Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/protectedtitles/ HPC – Health Professions Council – Protected titles]. Hpc-uk.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, graduate programs in psychology, including occupational psychology, are accredited by the [[British Psychological Society]].

In Australia, the title organizational psychologist is protected by law, and regulated by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). Organizational psychology is one of nine areas of specialist endorsement for psychology practice in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/Endorsement.aspx |title=Psychology Board of Australia – Endorsement |publisher=Psychologyboard.gov.au |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe someone with a specialist [[EuroPsy]] Certificate in Work and Organisational Psychology is a fully qualified psychologist and an expert in the work psychology field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europsy-efpa.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial and organizational psychologists reaching the EuroPsy standard are recorded in the Register of European Psychologists and industrial and organizational psychology is one of the three main psychology specializations in Europe.

==Historical overview==
The historical development of I/O psychology was paralleled in the US, the UK,&lt;ref&gt;Chimiel, N. (2000). History and context for work and organizational psychology. In N. Chmiel (Ed.), ''Introduction to work and organizational psychology :A European perspective''. Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia, Germany, the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;Shimmin, S., &amp; van Strien, P. J. (1998). History of the psychology of work and organization. In P. J. D. Drenth, H. Thierry, &amp; C. J. de Wolff (Eds.), ''Handbook of work and organizational psychology'' (pp. 71–99). Hove, U.K.: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and eastern European countries such as Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Pitariu, H. D. (19912). I/O psychology in Romania: Past, present and intentions. ''The Industrial-Organizational Psychologist, 29''(4), 29–33.&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of I/O psychology trace back nearly to the beginning of psychology as a science, when [[Wilhelm Wundt]] founded one of the first psychological laboratories in 1879 in Leipzig, Germany. In the mid 1880s, Wundt trained two psychologists, [[Hugo Münsterberg]] and [[James McKeen Cattell]], who had a major influence on the emergence of I/O psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Landy, F. J. (1997). Early influences on the development of industrial and organizational psychology. Journal of Applied Psychology, 82, 467–477.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of viewing performance differences as human "errors", Cattell was one of the first to recognize the importance of differences among individuals as a way of better understanding work behavior. [[Walter Dill Scott]], who was a contemporary of Cattell, was elected President of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) in 1919, was arguably the most prominent I/O psychologist of his time. Scott, along with [[Walter Van Dyke Bingham]], worked at the [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Institute of Technology]], developing methods for selecting and training sales personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Feruson, L. (1965). ''The heritage of industrial psychology''. Hartford, CT: Finlay Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "industrial" side of I/O psychology originated in research on individual differences, [[Industrial &amp; Organizational Assessment|assessment]], and the prediction of work performance. Industrial psychology crystallized during World War I, in response to the need to rapidly assign new troops to duty. Scott and Bingham volunteered to help with the testing and placement of more than a million army recruits. In 1917, together with other prominent psychologists, they adapted a well-known intelligence test the [[Stanford–Binet]], which was designed for testing one individual at a time, to make it suitable for group testing. The new test was called the [[Army Alpha]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

After the War, the growing industrial base in the US was a source of momentum for what was then called industrial psychology.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Private industry set out to emulate the successful testing of army personnel.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Mental ability testing soon became commonplace in the work setting.

[[Elton Mayo]] found that rest periods improved morale and reduced turnover in a Philadelphia textile factory.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, E. (1924). Recovery and industrial fatigue. ''Journal of Personnel Research, 3'', 273–281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griffin,  M.  A., Landy,  F.  J., &amp; Mayocchi, L. (2002). Australian influences on Elton Mayo: The construct of revery in industrial society. ''History of Psychology, 5''(4), 356–375.&lt;/ref&gt; He later joined the ongoing [[Hawthorne studies]], where he became interested in how workers' emotions and informal relationships affected productivity. The results of these studies ushered in the [[human relations movement]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[World War II]] brought renewed interest in ability testing (to accurately place recruits in new technologically advanced military jobs), the introduction of the assessment center, and concern with morale and fatigue in war industry workers.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The industrial psychology division of the former American Association of Applied Psychology became a division within APA,&lt;ref name="Kopes"&gt;Kopes, L. L. (2006). A brief history of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology. Accessed June 3, 2013. [http://www.siop.org/History/History.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; becoming Division 14 of APA. It was initially called the Industrial and Business Psychology Division. In 1962, the name was changed to the Industrial Psychology Division. In 1973, it was renamed again, this time to the Division of Industrial and Organizational Psychology. In 1982, the unit become more independent of APA, and its name was changed again, this time to the [[Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology]].&lt;ref name="Kopes"/&gt;

The name change of the division from "industrial psychology" to "industrial and organizational psychology" reflected the shift in the work of industrial psychologists who had originally addressed work behavior from the individual perspective, examining performance and attitudes of individual workers. Their work became broader. Group behavior in the workplace became a worthy subject of study.&lt;ref name="Kopes"/&gt; The emphasis on "organizational" underlined the fact that when an individual joins an organization (e.g., the organization that hired him or her), he or she will be exposed to a common [[goal]] and a common set of operating procedures.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} In the 1970s in the UK, references to occupational psychology became more common than I/O psychology.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

According to Bryan and Vinchur, "while organizational psychology increased in popularity through [the 1960s and 1970s], research and practice in the traditional areas of industrial psychology continued, primarily driven by employment legislation and case law" (p.&amp;nbsp;53).&lt;ref name = "Bryan"&gt;Bryan, L. L. K., &amp; Vinchur, A.J. (2012). A history of industrial and organizational psychology. S. W. J. Kozlowski (Ed.), ''The Oxford handbook of organizational psychology'' (pp. 22-75). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a focus on fairness and validity in selection efforts as well as in the job analyses that undergirded selection instruments. For example, i/o psychology showed increased interest in [[behaviorally anchored rating scales]].&lt;ref name = "Bryan"/&gt; What critics there were of i/o psychology accused the discipline of being responsive only to the concerns of managements.&lt;ref name = "Bryan"/&gt;

From the 1980 to 2010s other changes in i/o psychology took place. Researchers increasingly adopted a multi-level approach, attempting to understand behavioral phenomena from both the level of the organization and the level of the individual worker.&lt;ref name = "Bryan"/&gt; There was also an increased interest in the needs and expectations of employees as individuals. For example, an emphasis on organizational justice and the psychological contract took root, as well as the more traditional concerns of selection and training.&lt;ref name = "Bryan"/&gt; Methodological innovations (e.g., [[meta-analyses]], [[structural equation modeling]]) were adopted. With the passage of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|American with Disabilities Act]] in 1990 and parallel legislation elsewhere in the world, i/o psychology saw an increased emphasis on "fairness in personnel decisions."&lt;ref name = "Bryan"/&gt; Training research relied increasingly on advances in [[educational psychology]] and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name = "Bryan"/&gt;

==Research methods==

As described above, I/O psychologists are trained in the [[scientist–practitioner model]]. I/O psychologists rely on a variety of methods to conduct organizational research. Study designs employed by I/O psychologists include [[statistical survey|surveys]], [[experiment]]s, [[quasi-experiments]], and [[observational studies]]. I/O psychologists rely on diverse data sources including human judgments, historical databases, objective measures of work performance (e.g., sales volume), and questionnaires and surveys.

I/O researchers employ quantitative statistical methods. [[Quantitative methods]] used in I/O psychology include [[correlation]], [[multiple regression]], and [[analysis of variance]]. More advanced statistical methods employed in I/O research include [[logistic regression]], [[structural equation modeling]],&lt;ref&gt;Hayduk, L.A. (1987). ''Structural equations modeling with LISREL.'' Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hierarchical linear modeling]] (HLM; also known as [[multilevel modeling]]).&lt;ref&gt;Raudenbush, S.W. &amp; Bryk, A.S. (2001). ''Hierarchical linear models: Applications and data analysis methods'' (2nd ed.). Newbury Park, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; I/O research has also employed [[meta-analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, J.E. &amp; Schmidt, F.L. (1990). ''Methods of meta-analysis: Correcting error and bias in research findings.'' Thousand Oaks, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, J.E. &amp; Schmidt, F.L. (1994). Estimation of sampling error variance in the meta-analysis of correlations: Use of average correlation in the homogeneous case. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', 79, 171–77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, R. &amp; DiMatteo, M.R. (2002). Meta-analysis. In H. Pashler &amp; J. Wixted (Eds.). ''Stevens' handbook of experimental psychology'' (3rd ed.), Vol. 4: Methodology in experimental psychology, pp. 391–428. Hoboken, NJ, US: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; I/O psychologists also employ [[psychometric]] methods including methods associated with [[classical test theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Nunnally, J. &amp; Bernstein, I. (1994). ''Psychometric theory'' (3rd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; [[generalizability theory]], and [[item response theory]] (IRT).&lt;ref&gt;Du Toit, M. (2003) ''IRT from SSI.'' Mooresville, IN: Scientific Software.&lt;/ref&gt;

I/O psychologists have also employed [[qualitative methods]], which largely involve [[focus groups]], [[interviews]], and [[case studies]]. I/O research on organizational culture research has employed [[ethnographic]] techniques and [[participant observation]]. A qualitative technique associated with I/O psychology is Flanagan's [[Critical Incident Technique]].&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, J.C. (1954). The Critical Incident Technique. ''Psychological Bulletin, 51'', 327–58.&lt;/ref&gt; I/O psychologists sometimes use quantitative and qualitative methods in concert.&lt;ref&gt;Rogelberg, S. G., &amp; Brooks-Laber, M. E. (2002). Securing our collective duture: Challenges facing those designing and doing research in industrial and organization psychology. In S. G. Rogelberg (Ed.). ''Handbook of research methods in industrial and organizational psychology'' (pp. 479 – 485). Cambridge, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; OHP researchers have also combined and coordinated quantitative and qualitative methods within a single study.&lt;ref&gt;Elfering, A., Grebner, S., Semmer, N.K., Kaiser-Freiburghaus, D., Lauper-Del Ponte, S., &amp; Witschi, I. (2005). Chronic job stressors and job control: Effects on event-related coping success and well-being. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 78'', 237–252.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics{{anchor|Topics in industrial-organizational psychology}}==

===Job analysis===
{{main|Job analysis}}
Job analysis encompasses a number of different methods.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} It primarily involves the systematic collection of information about a job. A task-oriented job analysis involves an examination of the duties, tasks, and/or competencies required by the job being assessed. By contrast, a worker-oriented job analysis involves an examination of the knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) required to successfully perform the work. Information obtained from job analyses are used for many purposes, including the creation of job-relevant selection procedures, [[performance appraisals]] and the criteria they require, and the development of training programs.

===Personnel recruitment and selection===
{{main|Personnel selection}}
I/O psychologists typically work with human resource specialists to design (a) recruitment processes and (b) personnel selection systems.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Personnel [[recruitment]] is the process of identifying qualified candidates in the workforce and getting them to apply for jobs within an organization. Personnel recruitment processes include developing job announcements, placing ads, defining key qualifications for applicants, and screening out unqualified applicants.

Personnel selection is the systematic process of hiring and promoting personnel. Personnel selection systems employ evidence-based practices to determine the most qualified candidates. Personnel selection involves both the newly hired and individuals who can be promoted from within the organization. Common selection tools include ability tests (e.g., cognitive, physical, or psycho-motor), knowledge tests, [[personality tests]], structured [[interviews]], the systematic collection of biographical data, and work samples. I/O psychologists must evaluate evidence regarding the extent to which selection tools predict job performance.

Personnel selection procedures are usually validated, i.e., shown to be job relevant to personnel selection, using one or more of the following types of validity: [[content validity]], [[construct validity]], and/or [[criterion validity|criterion-related validity]]. I/O psychologists must adhere to professional standards in personnel selection efforts. SIOP (e.g., ''Principles for validation and use of personnel selection procedures''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siop.org/_Principles/principles.pdf ''The SIOP principles'']&lt;/ref&gt;) and APA together with the [[National Council on Measurement in Education]] (e.g., ''Standards for educational and psychological testing''&lt;ref&gt;[''The standards for educational and psychological testing'' http://www.apa.org/science/programs/testing/standards.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; are sources of those standards. The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]'s ''Uniform guidelines''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniformguidelines.com/ ''Uniform guidelines on eemployee selection procedures'']&lt;/ref&gt; are also influential in guiding personnel selection decisions.

A meta-analysis of selection methods found that [[g factor (psychometrics)|general mental ability]] was the best overall predictor of job performance and attainment in training.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, F.L., &amp; Hunter, J.E. (1998). The validity and utility of selection methods in personnel psychology: Practical and theoretical implications of 85 years of research findings. ''Psychological Bulletin, 124''(2), 262–74. [http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1998-10661-006&amp;CFID=5257837&amp;CFTOKEN=93267042]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance appraisal/management===
{{main|Performance appraisal|Performance management}}
Performance appraisal or [[performance evaluation]] is the process in which an individual's or a group's work behaviors and outcomes are assessed against managers' and others' expectations for the job.&lt;ref name = "Miner"&gt;Miner, J.B. (1992). ''Industrial-organizational psychology.'' New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Performance appraisal is frequently used in promotion and compensation decisions, to help design and validate personnel selection procedures, and for performance management. Performance management is the process of providing performance feedback relative to expectations, and information relevant to improvement (e.g., coaching, mentoring). Performance management may also include documenting and tracking performance information for organizational evaluation purposes.

An I/O psychologist would typically use information from the job analysis to determine a job's performance dimensions, and then construct a [[rating scale]] to describe each level of performance for the job.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Often, the I/O psychologist would be responsible for training organizational personnel how to use the performance appraisal instrument, including ways to minimize bias when using the rating scale, and how to provide effective performance feedback.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Individual assessment and psychometrics===
{{main|Individual assessment|Psychometrics}}
[[Individual assessment]] involves the measurement of [[individual differences]]. I/O psychologists perform individual assessments in order to evaluate differences among candidates for employment as well as differences among employees.&lt;ref name="A and U"&gt;Anastasi, A., &amp; Urbina, S. (1997). ''Psychological testing. 7th ed.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; The constructs measured pertain to job performance. With candidates for employment, individual assessment is often part of the personnel selection process. These assessments can include written tests, aptitude tests, physical tests, psycho-motor tests, [[personality test]]s, integrity and reliability tests, work samples, [[simulation]]s, and [[assessment centre]]s.&lt;ref name="A and U"/&gt;

===Occupational health and well-being===

I/O psychologists are concerned with occupational health and [[well-being]]. Early in the 20th century [[Arthur Kornhauser]] examined the impact on productivity of hiring mentally unstable workers.&lt;ref name="Zickar"&gt;Zickar, M. J. (2003). Remembering Arthur Kornhauser: Industrial psychology’s advocate for worker well-being. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 88'', 363–369. doi:10.1037/0021-9010.88.2.363&lt;/ref&gt; Kornhauser also examined the link between industrial working conditions and mental health as well as the spillover into a worker's personal life of having an unsatisfying job.&lt;ref&gt;Kornhauser, A. (1965). ''Mental health of the industrial worker''. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowling, K. 2010"&gt;Bowling, K., Eschleman, J., &amp;  Wang, Q (2010). A meta-analytic examination of the relationship between [[job satisfaction]] and subjective well-being. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 83''(4), 915–934.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liljegren, M. 2009"&gt;Liljegren, M., &amp; Ekberg, K. (2009). Job mobility as predictor of health and burnout. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 82''(2), 317–329.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, I/O researchers have found that staying vigorous during working hours is associated with better work-related behaviour and subjective well-being as well as more effective functioning in the family domain.&lt;ref name = "Sonnen2008"&gt;Sonnentag, S., &amp; Niessen, C. (2008). Staying vigorous until work is over: The role of trait vigour, day-specific work experiences and recovery. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 81''(3), 435–458.&lt;/ref&gt; Trait vigor and recovery experiences after work were related to vigor at work.&lt;ref name = "Sonnen2008"/&gt; Job satisfaction has also been found to be associated with [[life satisfaction]], happiness, well-being and positive affect, and the absence of [[negative affect]].&lt;ref name="Bowling, K. 2010"/&gt;  Other research indicates that among older workers activities such as volunteering and participating in social clubs was related to a decrease in depressive symptoms over the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;Potočnik, K., &amp; Sonnentag, S., &amp; Niessen, C. (2008). A longitudinal study of well-being in older workers and retirees: The role of engaging in different types of activities. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 89'', 497–521. doi:10.1111/joop.12003&lt;/ref&gt; Research on job changing indicates that mobility between, but not within, organizations is associated with [[occupational burnout|burnout]].&lt;ref name="Liljegren, M. 2009"/&gt;

===Workplace bullying, aggression and violence===
{{main|Workplace bullying|Workplace aggression|Workplace violence}} 
I/O psychologists are concerned with the related topics of workplace bullying, aggression, and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Coyne, I., Garvin, F. (2013). Employee relations and motivation. In Lewis, R., &amp;  Zibarris, R. (Eds.), Work and Occupational Psychology: Integrating Theory and Practice. Sage&lt;/ref&gt; For example, I/O research found that exposure to workplace violence elicited ruminative thinking, and ruminative thinking, in turn, is associated with poor well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Sprigg, C., Armitage, J., &amp; Satchwell, A . (2013). Ruminative thinking exacerbates the negative effects of workplace violence ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 86(1), 67–84.&lt;/ref&gt; I/O research has found that interpersonal aggressive behaviours is associated with worse team performance.&lt;ref&gt;Aube, C, &amp; Rousseau, V . (2011). Interpersonal aggression and team effectiveness: The mediating role of team goal commitment ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 84(3), 565–580.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remuneration and compensation===
{{main|Remuneration}}
Compensation includes wages or salary, bonuses, pension/retirement contributions, and [[employee benefits]] that can be converted to cash or replace living expenses. I/O psychologists may be asked to conduct a [[job evaluation]] for the purpose of determining compensation levels and ranges. I/O psychologists may also serve as [[expert witness]]es in pay discrimination cases, when disparities in pay for similar work are alleged by employees.

===Training and training evaluation===
{{main|Training}}
Training involves the systematic teaching of skills, concepts, or attitudes that results in improved performance in another environment.&lt;ref name="Goldstein, I. L. 2002"&gt;Goldstein, I. L., &amp; Ford, J. K. (2002). ''Training in organizations: Needs assessment, development, and evaluation'' (4th ed). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Because many people hired for a job are not already versed in all the tasks the job requires, training may be needed to help the individual perform the job effectively. Evidence indicates that training is often effective, and that it succeeds in terms of higher net sales and gross profitability per employee.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, W., Bennett, W., Edens, P.S., &amp; Bell, S.T. (2003). Effectiveness of training in organizations: A meta-analysis of design and evaluation features. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 88'', 234–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to performance management (see above), an I/O psychologist would employ a [[job analysis]] in concert with the application of the principles of [[instructional design]] to create an effective training program.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} A training program is likely to include a [[summative evaluation]] at its conclusion in order to ensure that trainees have met the training objectives and can perform the target work tasks at an acceptable level. Training programs often include [[formative assessments|formative evaluations]] to assess the effect of the training as the training proceeds. Formative evaluations can be used to locate problems in training procedures and help I/O psychologists make corrective adjustments while training is ongoing.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The foundation for training programs is [[learning]]. Learning outcomes can be organized into three broad categories: cognitive, skill-based, and affective outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Kraiger, K., Ford, J. K., &amp; Salas, E. (1993). Application of cognitive, skill-based, and affective theories of learning outcomes to new methods of training evaluation. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 78'', 311 – 328.&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive training is aimed at instilling declarative knowledge or the knowledge of rules, facts, and principles (e.g., police officer training covers laws and court procedures). Skill-based training aims to impart procedural knowledge (e.g., skills needed to use a special tool) or technical skills (e.g., understanding the workings of software program). Affective training concerns teaching individuals to develop specific attitudes or beliefs that predispose trainees to behave a certain way (e.g., show commitment to the organization, appreciate diversity).&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J. P., McCloy, R. A., Oppler, S.H., &amp; Sager, C. E. (1993). A theory of performance. In N. Schmitt &amp; W. C. Borman (Eds.), ''Personnel selection in organizations'' (pp. 35–70). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[needs assessment]], an analysis of corporate and individual goals, is often undertaken prior to the development of a training program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schultz|first=Duane P. Schultz, Sydney Ellen|title=''Psychology and work today: An introduction to industrial and organizational psychology''|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0-205-68358-4|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=164}} In addition, a careful [[needs analysis]] is required in order to develop a systematic understanding of where training is needed, what should be taught, and who will be trained.&lt;ref name="Goldstein, I. L. 2002"/&gt; A [[training needs analysis]] typically involves a three-step process that includes [[organizational analysis]], [[task analysis]] and person analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Dierdorff, E. C., &amp; Surface, E. A. (2008). Assessing training needs: Do work experience and capability matter? Human Performance, 21, 28–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

An organizational analysis is an examination of organizational goals and resources as well as the organizational environment.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The results of an organizational analysis help to determine where training should be directed. The analysis identifies the training needs of different departments or subunits.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} It systematically assesses manager, peer, and technological support for [[transfer of training]]. An organizational analysis also takes into account the [[organisation climate|climate]] of the organization and its subunits. For example, if a climate for safety is emphasized throughout the organization or in subunits of the organization (e.g., production), then training needs will likely reflect an emphasis on safety.&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, D. (2002a). Modifying supervisory practices to improve subunit safety: A leadership-based intervention model. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 87'', 587–596.&lt;/ref&gt; A task analysis uses the results of a job analysis to determine what is needed for successful job performance, contributing to training content. With organizations increasingly trying to identify "core competencies" that are required for all jobs, task analysis can also include an assessment of competencies.&lt;ref&gt;Shippmann, J. S. et al. (2000). The practice of competency modeling. ''Personnel Psychology, 53'', 703–740.&lt;/ref&gt; A person analysis identifies which individuals within an organization should receive training and what kind of instruction they need. Employee needs can be assessed using a variety of methods that identify weaknesses that training can address.

===Motivation in the workplace===
{{main|Work motivation}}
Work motivation reflects the energy an individual applies "to initiate work-related behavior, and to determine its form, direction, intensity, and duration"&lt;ref name="Pin"&gt;Pinder, C. C.(2008). ''Work motivation in organizational behavior'' (2nd edition). New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding what motivates an organization's employees is central to I/O psychology. [[Motivation]] is generally thought of as a theoretical construct that fuels behavior. An [[incentive]] is an anticipated reward that is thought to incline a person to behave a certain way.&lt;ref name="Dec"&gt;Deckers, L. (2010). ''Motivation: Biological, psychological and environmental'' (3rd ed., pp. 2–3). Boston, MA: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation varies among individuals. Studying its influence on behavior, it must be examined together with ability and environmental influences. Because of motivation's role in influencing workplace behavior and performance, many organizations structure the work environment to encourage productive behaviors and discourage unproductive behaviors.&lt;ref name="jex"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;Mitchell, T.R.; Daniels, D. 2003. Motivation. ''Handbook of Psychology'', Vol. 12. Industrial Organizational Psychology, ed. W.C. Borman, D.R. Ilgen, R.J. Klimoski, pp. 225–54. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivation involves three psychological processes: arousal, direction, and intensity.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Arousal is what initiates action. It is often fueled by a person's need or desire for something that is missing from his or her life, either totally or partially. Direction refers to the path employees take in accomplishing the goals they set for themselves. Intensity is the amount of energy employees put into goal-directed work performance. The level of intensity often reflects the importance and difficulty of the goal. These psychological processes involve four factors.  First, motivation serves to direct attention, focusing on particular issues, people, tasks, etc. Second, it serves to stimulate effort. Third, motivation influences persistence. Finally, motivation influences the choice and application of task-related strategies.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;

===Occupational stress===
{{main|Occupational stress}}
I/O psychologists are involved in the research and the practice of occupational stress and design of individual and organizational interventions to manage and reduce the stress levels and increase productivity, performance, health and wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;Vinchur, A.J, &amp; Koppes, L.L.

Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational stress can have implications for organizational performance because of the emotions job stress evokes.

===Organizational culture===
{{main|Organizational culture}}
Organizational culture has been described as a set of assumptions shared by individuals in an organization; the assumptions influence the interpretation and actions that define appropriate behavior for various situations.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Organizational culture has been shown to affect important organizational outcomes such as performance, attraction, recruitment, retention, employee satisfaction, and employee well-being.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} There are three levels of organizational culture: artifacts, shared values, and basic beliefs and assumptions.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Artifacts comprise the physical components of the organization that relay cultural meaning. Shared values are individuals' preferences regarding certain aspects of the organization's culture (e.g., loyalty, customer service). Basic beliefs and assumptions include individuals' impressions about the trustworthiness and supportiveness of an organization, and are often deeply ingrained within the organization's culture.

In addition to an overall culture, organizations also have subcultures.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Examples of subcultures include corporate culture, departmental culture, local culture, and issue-related culture.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} While there is no single "type" of organizational culture, some researchers have developed models to describe different organizational cultures.

===Group behavior===
{{main|Group behavior}}
Group behavior involves the interactions among individuals in a collective. The individuals' [[opinions]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], and adaptations affect group behavior and group behavior, in turn, affects those opinions, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstone, R., Roberts, M., &amp; Gureckis, T. (2008). Emergent processes of group behavior. ''Group Behavior, 17'', 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The interactions are thought to fulfill some need satisfaction in an individual who is part of the collective.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; A specific area of I/O research in group behavior is the team dynamics and team effectiveness.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Team effectiveness====
{{main|Team effectiveness}}
Organizations often organize teams because teams can accomplish a much greater amount of work in a short period of time than an individual can accomplish.&lt;ref name=jex/&gt; I/O research has examined the harm workplace aggression does to team performance.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, V. &amp;  Aube, C. (2011). Interpersonal aggression and team effectiveness: The mediating role of team goal commitment ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 84''(3), 565–580.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Team composition====
The selection of individuals to be assigned to specific teams bears on the resulting effectiveness of those teams. Aspects of team composition that should be considered during the team selection process include team members' knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) as well their personalities and attitudes.&lt;ref name=jex/&gt; To achieve high-quality results, teams built with members having higher skill levels are more likely to be effective than teams built around members having lesser skills; teams that include a members with a diversity of skills are also likely to show improved team performance.&lt;ref&gt;Guzzo, R.A., &amp; Shea, G.P. (1992). Group performance and intergroup relations in organizations. ''Handbook of industrial and organizational psychology'' (Vol. 3, pp. 269–313).

(1990). Work teams: Applications and effectiveness. ''American Psychologist, 45''(2), 120–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Team members' personalities and attitudes have also been studied. For example, the personality factors agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and emotional stability are related to better team performance.&lt;ref&gt;Van Vianen, A.E.M. &amp; De Dreu, C.K.W. (2001). Personality in teams: Its relationship to social cohesion, task cohesion, and team performance. ''European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 10''(2), 97–120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Barrick"/&gt;

====Task design====
{{main|Job design}}
A fundamental question in team task design is whether or not a task is even appropriate for a team. Those tasks that require predominantly independent work are best left to individuals, and team tasks should include those tasks that consist primarily of interdependent work.&lt;ref name=jex&gt;Jex, S.M. &amp; Britt, T.W. (2008). ''Organizational psychology.'' Hoboken, New Jersey: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; When a given task is appropriate for a team, task design can play a key role in team effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Sundstrom, E., McIntyre, M., Halfhill, T., &amp; Richards, H. (2000) Work groups: From the Hawthorne studies to work teams of the 1990s and beyond. ''Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice, 4'', 44-67. doi:org/10.1037/1089-2699.4.1.44&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Job characteristic theory]] identifies core job dimensions that affect motivation, satisfaction, performance, etc. These dimensions include skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy and feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Hackman, J. R. &amp; Oldham, G. R. (1975). Development of job diagnostic survey. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 60'', 159-170.&lt;/ref&gt; The dimensions map well to the team environment. Individual contributors who perform team tasks that are challenging, interesting, and engaging are more likely to be motivated to exert greater effort and perform better than team members who are working on tasks that lack those characteristics.&lt;ref name=jex/&gt;

====Organizational resources====
Organizational support systems affect the team effectiveness&lt;ref name = "Sun1990"/&gt; and provide resources for teams operating in the multi-team environment. During the chartering of new teams, organizational enabling resources are first identified. Examples of enabling resources include facilities, equipment, information, training, and leadership.&lt;ref name=jex/&gt; Team-specific resources (e.g., budgetary resources, human resources) are typically made available. Team-specific human resources represent the individual contributors who are selected to be  team members. Intra-team processes (e.g., task design, task assignment) involve these team-specific resources.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Teams also function in dynamic multi-team environments. Teams often must respond to shifting organizational contingencies.&lt;ref&gt;Salas, E., Stagl, K., &amp; Burke, C. (2004). 25 years of team effectiveness in organizations: Research themes and emerging needs, In C. Cooper &amp; I. Robertson (Eds.), ''International review of industrial and organizational psychology'', Vol. 19 (pp. 47–91). Chichester, UK: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; Contingencies affecting teams include constraints arising from conditions in which organizational resources are not exclusively earmarked for certain teams. When resources are scarce, they must be shared by multiple teams.

====Team rewards====
Organizational reward systems drive the strengthening and enhancing of individual team member efforts; such efforts contribute towards reaching team goals.&lt;ref&gt;Luthans, F., &amp; Kreitner, R. (1985). ''Organizational behavior modification and beyond: An operant and social learning approach'' (2nd ed.). Glenview, IL: Scott, Foresman&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, rewards that are given to individual team members should be contingent upon the performance of the entire team.&lt;ref name = "Sun1990"/&gt;

Several design elements are needed to enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If this is not the case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Wageman, R., &amp; Baker, G. (1997).

That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, V.Y., &amp; Taggar, S. (2006). Antecedents of team reward attitude. ''Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice, 10'', 194–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Team goals====
Goals potentially motivate team members when goals contain three elements: difficulty, acceptance, and specificity.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, E.A., &amp; Latham, G.P. (1990). ''A theory of goal setting and task performance''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt; Under difficult goal conditions, teams with more committed members tend to outperform teams with less committed members.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, K. (1994). Improving group task performance: The role of group goals and group efficacy. ''Human Performance, 7'', 55–78.&lt;/ref&gt; When team members commit to team goals, team effectiveness is a function of how supportive members are with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Aube, C., &amp; Rousseau, V. (2005). Team goal commitment and team effectiveness: The role of task interdependence and supportive behaviors. ''Group dynamics: Theory, research, and practice, 9'', 189–204.&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of individual team members and team goals interact. Team and individual goals must be coordinated.

Individual and group goals when workers are interdependent. Effects on task strategy and performance. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 75'', 185–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job satisfaction and commitment===
{{main|Job satisfaction}}
Job satisfaction is often thought to reflect the extent to which a worker likes his or her job, or individual aspects or facets of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, P.E. (1997). ''Job satisfaction: Application, assessment, causes and consequences''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most heavily researched topics in I/O psychology. Job satisfaction has theoretical and practical utility for the field. It has been linked to important job outcomes including attitudinal variables (e.g., job involvement, organizational commitment), absenteeism, turnover intentions, actual turnover, job performance, and tension.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} A meta-analyses found job satisfaction to be related to life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and the absence of negative affect.&lt;ref&gt;Bowling, K., Eschleman, J., &amp;  Wang, Q (2010). A meta-analytic examination of the relationship between job satisfaction and subjective well-being. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 83''(4), 915–934.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Productive behavior===
Productive behavior is defined as employee behavior that contributes positively to the goals and objectives of an organization.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; When an employee begins a new job, there is a transition period during which he or she may not contribute significantly. To assist with this transition an employee typically requires job-related training. In financial terms, productive behavior represents the point at which an organization begins to achieve some return on the investment it has made in a new employee.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; I/O psychologists are ordinarily more focused on productive behavior than job or task performance, including in-role ''and'' extra-role performance. In-role performance tells managers how well an employee performs the required aspects of the job; extra-role performance includes behaviors not necessarily required by job but nonetheless contribute to organizational effectiveness. By taking both in-role and extra-role performance into account, an I/O psychologist is able to assess employees' effectiveness (how well they do what they were hired to do), efficiency (outputs to relative inputs), and productivity (how much they help the organization reach its goals). Three forms of productive behavior that I/O psychologists often evaluate include job performance, organizational citizenship behavior (see below), and innovation.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt;

====Job performance====
{{main|Job performance}}
[[Job performance]] represents behaviors employees engage in while at work which contribute to organizational goals.&lt;ref name="campbell1990"&gt;Campbell, J.P. (1990). Modeling the performance prediction problem in industrial and organizational psychology. In M.D. Dunnette &amp; L.M. Hough (Eds.), ''Handbook of industrial and organizational psychology'' (2nd ed., Vol 1, pp. 687–732). Palo Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologists Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors are formally evaluated by an organization as part of an employee's responsibilities.&lt;ref name="campbell1990"/&gt; In order to understand and ultimately predict job performance, it is important to be precise when defining the term. Job performance is about behaviors that are within the control of the employee and not about results (effectiveness), the costs involved in achieving results (productivity), the results that can be achieved in a period of time (efficiency), or the value an organization places on a given level of performance, effectiveness, productivity or efficiency (utility).&lt;ref name=jex /&gt;

To model job performance, researchers have attempted to define a set of dimensions that are common to all jobs. Using a common set of dimensions provides a consistent basis for assessing performance and enables the comparison of performance across jobs. Performance is commonly broken into two major categories: in-role (technical aspects of a job) and extra-role (non-technical abilities such as communication skills and being a good team member). While this distinction in behavior has been challenged&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, E.W. (1994). Role definitions and organizational citizenship behavior: The importance of the employee's perspective. ''Academy of Management Journal'', 37, 1543–67.&lt;/ref&gt; it is commonly made by both employees and management.&lt;ref name="VanDyneLePine1998"&gt;Van Dyne &amp; LePine (1998). Helping and Voice Extra-role Behaviors: Evidence of Construct and Predictive Validity, ''The Academy of Management Journal'', Vol. 41, No. 1 (Feb. 1998, pp. 108–19).&lt;/ref&gt; A model of performance by Campbell breaks performance into in-role and extra-role categories.&lt;ref name="campbell1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell1994"&gt;Campbell, J.P. (1994). Alternative models of job performance and their implications for selection and classification. In M.G. Rumsey; C.B. Walker &amp; J.H. Harris (Eds.), ''Personnel selection and classification'' (pp. 33–51). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell labeled job-specific task proficiency and non-job-specific task proficiency as in-role dimensions, while written and oral communication, demonstrating effort, maintaining personal discipline, facilitating peer and team performance, supervision and leadership and management and administration are labeled as extra-role dimensions.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; Murphy's model of job performance also broke job performance into in-role and extra-role categories.&lt;ref name="Murphy1994"&gt;Murphy, K.R. (1994). Toward a broad conceptualization of jobs and job performance: Impact of changes in the military environment on the structure, assessment, and prediction of job performance. In M.G. Rumsey; C.B. Walker &amp; J.H. Harris (Eds.), ''Personnel selection and classification'' (pp. 85–102), Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; However, task-orientated behaviors composed the in-role category and the extra-role category included interpersonally-oriented behaviors, down-time behaviors and destructive and hazardous behaviors.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; However, it has been challenged as to whether the measurement of job performance is usually done through pencil/paper tests, job skills tests, on-site hands-on tests, off-site hands-on tests, high-fidelity simulations, symbolic simulations, task ratings and global ratings.&lt;ref name=Murphy1989&gt;Murphy, K.R. (1989).  Dimensions of job performance. In R. Dillon &amp; J.W. Pelligrino (Eds.), ''Testing: Theoretical and applied perspectives'' (pp. 218–47). New York: Praeger&lt;/ref&gt; These various tools are often used to evaluate performance on specific tasks and overall job performance.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; Van Dyne and LePine developed a measurement model in which overall job performance was evaluated using Campbell's in-role and extra-role categories.&lt;ref name="VanDyneLePine1998"/&gt; Here, in-role performance was reflected through how well "employees met their performance expectations and performed well at the tasks that made up the employees' job."&lt;ref name="jex2008104"&gt;Jex, S.M. &amp; Britt, T.W. (2008). Organizational Psychology. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Dimensions regarding how well the employee assists others with their work for the benefit of the group, if the employee voices new ideas for projects or changes to procedure and whether the employee attends functions that help the group composed the extra-role category.

To assess job performance, reliable and valid measures must be established. While there are many sources of error with [[Performance Rating (Work Measurement)|performance ratings]], error can be reduced through rater training&lt;ref name= "Pulakos1984"&gt;Pulakos, E.D. (1984). A comparison of rater training programs: Error training and accuracy training. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', 69, 581–88)&lt;/ref&gt; and through the use of behaviorally-anchored rating scales. Such scales can be used to clearly define the behaviors that constitute poor, average, and superior performance.&lt;ref name="campbell1990"/&gt; Additional factors that complicate the measurement of job performance include the instability of job performance over time due to forces such as changing performance criteria, the structure of the job itself&lt;ref name="Murphy1994"/&gt; and the restriction of variation in individual performance by organizational forces. These factors include errors in job measurement techniques, acceptance and the justification of poor performance and lack of importance of individual performance.

The determinants of job performance consist of factors having to do with the individual worker as well as environmental factors in the workplace. According to Campbell's Model of The Determinants of Job Performance,&lt;ref name="campbell1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell1994"/&gt; job performance is a result of the interaction between declarative knowledge (knowledge of facts or things), procedural knowledge (knowledge of what needs to be done and how to do it), and motivation (reflective of an employee's choices regarding whether to expend effort, the level of effort to expend, and whether to persist with the level of effort chosen).&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; The interplay between these factors show that an employee may, for example, have a low level of declarative knowledge, but may still have a high level of performance if the employee has high levels of procedural knowledge and motivation.

Regardless of the job, three determinants stand out as predictors of performance: (1) general mental ability (especially for jobs higher in complexity); (2) job experience (although there is a law of diminishing returns); and (3) the personality trait of conscientiousness (people who are dependable and achievement-oriented, who plan well).&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; These determinants appear to influence performance largely through the acquisition and usage of job knowledge and the motivation to do well. Further, an expanding area of research in job performance determinants includes emotional intelligence.&lt;ref name= "Baron"&gt;Baron, R.; Handley R. &amp; Fund S. (2006). The impact of emotional intelligence on performance. In V.U. Druskat; F. Sala &amp; G. Mount (Eds.), ''Linking emotional intelligence and performance at work: Current research evidence with individuals and groups'' (pp. 3–19). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goleman"&gt;Goleman, D. (1998). ''Working with Emotional Intelligence''. New York: Bantam Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational citizenship behavior===
{{main|Organizational citizenship behavior}}
Organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) are another form of workplace behavior that I/O psychologists are involved with. OCBs tend to be beneficial to both the organization and other workers. Dennis Organ (1988) defines OCBs as "individual behavior that is discretionary, not directly or explicitly recognized by the formal reward system, and that in the aggregate promotes the effective functioning of the organization."&lt;ref name="Organ1988"&gt;Organ, D.W. (1988). ''Organizational citizenship behavior: The good soldier syndrome''. Lexington, MA England: Lexington Books/D.C. Heath and Com.&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviors that qualify as OCBs can fall into one of the following five categories: altruism, courtesy, sportsmanship, conscientiousness, and civic virtue.&lt;ref name="Organ1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Organ1977"&gt;Organ, D.W. (1977). Inferences about trends in labor force satisfaction: A causal-correlational analysis. ''Academy of Management Journal'', 20(4), 510–19. {{doi|10.2307/255353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Organ1994"&gt;Organ, D.W. (1994). Organizational citizenship behavior and the good soldier. In M.G. Rumsey; C.B. Walker; J. Harris (Eds.), ''Personnel selection and classification'' (pp. 53–67). Hillsdale, NJ England: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; OCBs have also been categorized in other ways too, for example, by their intended targets (individuals, supervisors, and the organization as a whole.&lt;ref name="WilliamsAnderson"&gt;Williams, L.J. &amp; Anderson, S.E. (1994). Job satisfaction and organizational commitment as predictors of organizational citizenship and in-role behavior. ''Journal of Management, 17'', 601–17&lt;/ref&gt; Other alternative ways of categorizing OCBs include "compulsory OCBs," which are engaged in owing to coercive persuasion or peer pressure rather than out of good will.&lt;ref name="Vigoda2006"&gt;Vigoda-Gadot, E. (2006). Compulsory citizenship behavior: Theorizing some dark sides of the Good Soldier Syndrome in organizations. ''Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour, 36'', 77–93. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-5914.2006.00297}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which OCBs are voluntary has been the subject of some debate.&lt;ref name="Vigoda2006"/&gt;

Other research suggests that some employees perform OCBs to influence how they are viewed within the organization. While these behaviors are not formally part of the job description, performing them can influence performance appraisals.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; Researchers have advanced the view that employees engage in OCBs as a form of "impression management," a term coined by [[Erving Goffman]].&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, E. (1959). ''The presentation of self in everyday life''. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Goffman defined impression management as "the way in which the individual ... presents himself and his activity to others, the ways in which he guides and controls the impression they form of him, and the kinds of things he may and may not do while sustaining his performance before them. Some researchers have hypothesized that OCBs are not performed out of good will, positive affect, etc., but instead as a way of being noticed by others, including supervisors.&lt;ref name="Bolino"&gt;Bolino, M.C. (1999). Citizenship and impression management: Good soldiers or good actors? Academy of Management Review, 24(1), 82–98. {{doi|10.2307/259038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovation===
{{main|Innovation}}
Industrial and organizational psychologists consider [[innovation]], more often than not, a variable of less importance and often a counter-productive one to include in conducting job performance appraisals when irrelevant to the major job functions for which a given job exists. Nonetheless, I/O psychologists see the value of that variable where its consideration would, were its reliability and validity questioned, achieve a statistically significant probability that its results are not due to chance, and that it can be replicated reliably with a statistically significant ratio of reliability, and that were a court to raise a question on its reliability and validity testing, the I/O psychologist behind its use would be able to defend it before a court of justice with the belief that it will stand before such a court as reliable, and valid{{clarify|pre-text=remove or|date=February 2018}}{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

Four qualities are generally linked to creative and innovative behaviour by individuals:&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; 
* Task-relevant skills (general mental ability and job specific knowledge). Task specific and subject specific knowledge is most often gained through higher education; however, it may also be gained by mentoring and experience in a given field.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt;
* Creativity-relevant skills (ability to concentrate on a problem for long periods of time, to abandon unproductive searches, and to temporarily put aside stubborn problems). The ability to put aside stubborn problems is referred to by Jex &amp; Britt as productive forgetting.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; Creativity-relevant skills also require the individual contributor to evaluate a problem from multiple vantage points. One must be able to take on the perspective of various users. For example, an Operation Manager analyzing a reporting issue and developing an innovative solution would consider the perspective of a sales person, assistant, finance, compensation, and compliance officer.
* Task motivation (internal desire to perform task and level of enjoyment).&lt;ref name=jex /&gt;

At the organizational level, a study by Damanpour identified four specific characteristics that may predict innovation:&lt;ref&gt;Damanpour, F. (1991). Organizational innovation: A meta-analysis of effects of determinants and moderators. ''Academy of Management Journal'', 34, 555–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counterproductive work behavior===
{{main|Counterproductive work behavior}}
Counterproductive work behavior (CWB) can be defined as employee behavior that goes against the goals of an organization. These behaviors can be intentional or unintentional and result from a wide range of underlying causes and motivations. Some CWBs have instrumental motivations (e.g., theft).&lt;ref name = "Spector and Fox"/&gt; It has been proposed that a person-by-environment interaction can be utilized to explain a variety of counterproductive behaviors (Fox and Spector, 1999). For instance, an employee who sabotages another employee's work may do so because of lax supervision (environment) and underlying psychopathology (person) that work in concert to result in the counterproductive behavior. There is evidence that an emotional response (e.g., anger) to job stress (e.g., unfair treatment) can motivate CWBs.&lt;ref name = "Spector and Fox"/&gt;

The forms of counterproductive behavior with the most empirical examination are ineffective [[job performance]], [[absenteeism]], [[job turnover]], and [[accident]]s. Less common but potentially more detrimental forms of counterproductive behavior have also been investigated including violence and [[sexual harassment]].

===Leadership===
{{main|Leadership}}
In I/O psychology, leadership can be defined as a process of influencing others to agree on a shared purpose, and to work towards shared objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Yukl, G. (2010). Leadership in organizations (7th Ed.). New Jersey: Pearson&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction should be made between leadership and [[management]]. Managers process administrative tasks and organize work environments. Although leaders may be required to undertake managerial duties as well, leaders typically focus on inspiring followers and creating a shared organizational culture and values. Managers deal with complexity, while leaders deal with initiating and adapting to change. Managers undertake the tasks of planning, budgeting, organizing, staffing, controlling and problem solving. In contrast, leaders undertake the tasks of setting a direction or vision, aligning people to shared goals, communicating, and motivating.&lt;ref&gt;Daft, R.L. (2011). ''Leadership'' (5th Ed.). Australia: Cengage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approaches to studying leadership in I/O psychology can be broadly classified into three categories: Leader-focused approaches, contingency-focused approaches, and follower-focused approaches.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Leader-focused approaches====
Leader-focused approaches look to organizational leaders to determine the characteristics of effective [[leadership]]. According to the [[Trait theory|trait approach]], more effective leaders possess certain traits that less effective leaders lack. More recently, this approach is being used to predict leader emergence. The following traits have been identified as those that predict leader emergence when there is no formal leader: high intelligence, high needs for dominance, high self-motivation, and socially perceptive.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, R.L.; Ginnett, R.C. &amp; Curphy, G.J. (2009). ''Leadership: Enhancing the lessons of experience'' (6th Ed.). Boston: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Another leader-focused approached is the '''behavioral approach''' which focuses on the behaviors that distinguish effective from ineffective leaders. There are two categories of leadership behaviors: (1) [[Consideration and Initiating Structure|consideration]]; and (2) [[Consideration and Initiating Structure|initiating structure]]. Behaviors associated with the category of consideration include showing subordinates they are valued and that the leader cares about them. An example of a consideration behavior is showing compassion when problems arise in or out of the office. Behaviors associated with the category of initiating structure include facilitating the task performance of groups. One example of an initiating structure behavior is meeting one-on-one with subordinates to explain expectations and goals. The final leader-focused approach is '''[[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[social influence|influence]]'''. To be most effective a leader should be able to influence others to behave in ways that are in line with the organization's mission and goals. How influential a leader can be depends on their social power or their potential to influence their subordinates. There are six bases of power: [[French &amp; Raven's Five bases of Power|coercive power, reward power, legitimate power, expert power, referent power]], and informational power. A leader can use several different tactics to influence others within an organization. These common tactics include: rational [[persuasion]], inspirational appeal, consultation, [[ingratiation]], exchange, personal appeal, coalition, legitimating, and pressure.&lt;ref name="Jex, S. M. 2008"&gt;Jex, S.M. &amp; Britt, T.W. (2008). ''Organizational Psychology: A scientist-practitioner approach'' (2nd Ed.). New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contingency-focused approaches====
Of the 3 approaches to leadership, contingency-focused approaches have been the most prevalent over the past 30 years. Contingency-focused theories base a leader's effectiveness on their ability to assess a situation and adapt their behavior accordingly.&lt;ref name="Jex, S. M. 2008"/&gt; These theories assume that an effective leader can accurately "read" a situation and skillfully employ a leadership style that meets the needs of the individuals involved and the task at hand. A brief introduction to the most prominent contingency-focused theories will follow.

[[Fiedler contingency model|Fiedler's Contingency Theory]] holds that a leader's effectiveness depends on the interaction between their characteristics and the characteristics of the situation. [[Path–Goal Theory]] asserts that the role of the leader is to help his or her subordinates achieve their goals. To effectively do this, leaders must skillfully select from four different leadership styles to meet the situational factors. The situational factors are a product of the characteristics of subordinates and the characteristics of the environment. The [[Leader-Member Exchange Theory (LMX)|Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) Model]] focuses on how leader–subordinate relationships develop. Generally speaking, when a subordinate performs well or when there are positive exchanges between a leader and a subordinate, their relationship is strengthened, performance and job satisfaction are enhanced, and the subordinate will feel more commitment to the leader and the organization as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goleman |first= Daniel |title=Primal Leadership |year=2002 |publisher=Harvard Business School Press |location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vroom-Yetton decision model|Vroom-Yetton-Jago Model]] focuses on decision making with respect to a ''feasibility set''&lt;ref name="Jex, S. M. 2008"/&gt; which is composed of the situational attributes.

In addition to the contingency-focused approaches mentioned, there has been a high degree of interest paid to three novel approaches that have recently emerged. The first is [[transformational leadership]], which posits that there are certain leadership traits that inspire subordinates to perform beyond their capabilities. The second is [[transactional leadership]], which is most concerned with keeping subordinates in-line with deadlines and organizational policy. This type of leader fills more of a managerial role and lacks qualities necessary to inspire subordinates and induce meaningful change. And the third is authentic leadership which is centered around empathy and a leader's values or character. If the leader understands their followers, they can inspire subordinates by cultivating a personal connection and leading them to share in the vision and goals of the team. Although there has been a limited amount of research conducted on these theories, they are sure to receive continued attention as the field of I/O psychology matures.

====Follower-focused approaches====
Follower-focused approaches look at the processes by which leaders motivate followers, and lead teams to achieve shared goals. Understandably, the area of leadership motivation draws heavily from the abundant research literature in the domain of [[motivation]] in I/O psychology. Because leaders are held responsible for their followers' ability to achieve the organization's goals, their ability to motivate their followers is a critical factor of leadership effectiveness. Similarly, the area of team leadership draws heavily from the research in [[team]]s and team effectiveness in I/O psychology. Because organizational employees are frequently structured in the form of teams, leaders need to be aware of the potential benefits and pitfalls of working in teams, how teams develop, how to satisfy team members' needs, and ultimately how to bring about team effectiveness and performance.

An emerging area of I/O research in the area of team leadership is in leading [[virtual team]]s, where people in the team are geographically-distributed across various distances and sometimes even countries. While technological advances have enabled the leadership process to take place in such virtual contexts, they present new challenges for leaders as well, such as the need to use technology to build relationships with followers, and influencing followers when faced with limited (or no) face-to-face interaction.

====Organizational development====
{{Main|Organization development}}
I/O psychologists are also concerned with organizational change. This effort, called organizational development (OD). Tools used to advance organization development include the survey feedback technique. The technique involves the periodic assessment (with surveys) of employee attitudes and feelings. The results are conveyed to organizational stakeholders, who may want to take the organization in a particular direction. Another tool is the team building technique. Because many if not most  tasks within the organization are completed by small groups and/or teams, team building is important to organizational success. In order to enhance a team's morale and problem-solving skills, I/O psychologists help the groups to build their self-confidence, group cohesiveness, and working effectiveness.&lt;ref name=schultz&gt;

===Relation to organizational behavior===

The I/O psychology and [[organizational behavior]] have manifested some overlap.&lt;ref&gt;Miner, J.(2006) ''Organizational behavior 3: Historical origins, theoretical foundations and the future''. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; The overlap has led to some confusion regarding how the two disciplines differ.&lt;ref&gt;Jex, S.M., &amp; Britt, T.W. (2008). ''Organizational psychology: A scientist-practitioner approach'' (2nd ed.). Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also much confusion about the differences between I/O psychology and [[human resources]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.findmypathway.com/blog/human-resources-vs-organisational-psychology/|title=Human Resources vs Organisational Psychology - Find My Pathway|date=2018-10-21|work=Find My Pathway|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or [[human resource management]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guest|first=David E.|date=1994|title=Organizational psychology and human resource management: Towards a european approach|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13594329408410488?journalCode=pewo19|journal=European Work and Organizational Psychologist|language=en|volume=4|issue=3|pages=251–270|doi=10.1080/13594329408410488|issn=0960-2003|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==

The minimum requirement for working as an I/O psychologist is a master's degree. Normally, this degree requires about 2–3 years to complete. Of all the degrees granted in I/O psychology each year, approximately two thirds are at the master's level.&lt;ref name=schultz /&gt;{{rp|page=18}}
 
A comprehensive list of US and Canadian master's and doctoral programs can be found at the web site of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP).&lt;ref name="siop.org"&gt;[http://www.siop.org/gtp/gtplookup.asp Graduate Training Programs (visited web site on March 22, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; Admission into I/O psychology PhD programs is highly competitive given that many programs accept a small number of applicants every year.
 
There are graduate degree programs in I/O psychology outside of the US and Canada. The SIOP web site&lt;ref name="siop.org"/&gt; also provides a comprehensive list of I/O programs in many other countries.

In Australia, Organizational Psychologists must be accredited by the [[Australian Psychological Society|Australia Psychological Society]] (APS). To become an Organizational Psychologist, one must meet the criteria for a general psychologist's licence: 3 years studying bachelor's degree in Psychology, 4th year Honours degree or Postgraduate Diploma in Psychology, and two-year full-time supervised practice plus 80 hours of professional development. There are other avenues available, such as a two year supervised training program after Honours (i.e. 4+2 pathway), or one year of postgraduate coursework and practical placements followed by a one year supervised training program (i.e. 5+1 pathway)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.findmypathway.com/psychology/psychology-internships/|title=Psychology Internship Pathways - Find My Pathway|work=Find My Pathway|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/Registration/Provisional.aspx|title=Psychology Board of Australia - Provisional registration|website=www.psychologyboard.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After this, psychologists can elect to specialize as Organizational Psychologists.

===Competencies===

There are many different sets of competencies for different specializations within I/O psychology and I/O psychologists are versatile behavioral scientists. For example, an I/O psychologist specializing in selection and recruiting should have expertise in finding the best talent for the organization and getting everyone on board while he or she might not need to know much about executive coaching. Some I/O psychologists specialize in specific areas of consulting whereas others tend to generalize their areas of expertise. There are basic skills and knowledge an individual needs in order to be an effective I/O psychologist, which include being an independent learner, [[interpersonal skills]] (e.g., listening skills), and general consultation skills (e.g., skills and knowledge in the problem area).&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, T.G., &amp; Worley, C.G. (2015). ''Organization development and change''. Boston: Cengage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job outlook===

According to the United States Department of Labor's [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], I/O psychology is the fastest growing occupation in the United States, based on projections between 2012 and 2022.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com.au/fastest-growing-jobs-2013-12?op=1#1-industrial-organizational-psychologists-30&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a 2006 salary survey,&lt;ref&gt;Khanna, C., &amp; Medsker, G. J. (2007). 2006 Income and employment survey results for the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology. Bowling Green, OH: Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; the median salary for a PhD in I/O psychology was $98,000; for a master's level I/O psychologist was $72,000. The highest paid PhD I/O psychologists in private industry worked in pharmaceuticals and averaged approximately $151,000 per year; the median salary for self-employed consultants was $150,000; those employed in retail, energy, and manufacturing followed closely behind, averaging approximately $133,000. The lowest earners were found in state and local government positions, averaging approximately $77,000. In 2005, I/O psychologists whose primary responsibility is teaching at private and public colleges and universities often earn additional income from consulting with government and industry.&lt;ref&gt;Medsker, G. J., Katkowski, D. A., &amp; Furr, D. (2005). 2003 employment survey results for the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology. Bowling Green, OH: Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;The job opportunities have been on a steady rise for the past few years &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=|last=|first=|date=|work=The economist|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethics ==
An I/O psychologist, whether an academic, a consultant, or an employee, must maintain high ethical standards.&lt;ref&gt;Biech, E. (Ed.) (2007). The ethics of the business. ''The business of consulting: The basics and beyond'' (pp. 231–244). San Francisco, CA: Pfeiffer.&lt;/ref&gt; The APA's ethical principles apply to I/O psychologists. For example, ethically, the I/O psychologist should only accept projects for which he or she is qualified. With more organizations becoming global, it is important that when an I/O psychologist works outside her or his home country, the psychologist is aware of rules, regulations, and cultures of the organizations and countries in which the psychologist works, while adhering to the ethical standards set at home.&lt;ref&gt;Mobley, W. H. (2008). Rules of thumb for international consultants. In J. W. Hedge, &amp; W. C. Borman (Eds.), ''The I/O consultant: Advice and insights for building a successful career'' (pp. 309–314). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kuhmareyi''' is one of the [[Dialects of Fars|languages of southwestern Fars]].  It is a cluster of disparate dialects; the one illustrated here is the '''Davani dialect''' (Davani: ''devani'';&lt;ref name="iranica"&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v7f2/v7f217.html Encyclopedia Iranica article on Davani] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115212929/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v7f2/v7f217.html |date=2009-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-fa|'''دوانی'''}}, transliteration: Davāni) of the village of [[Davan]], 12 kilometers north of [[Kazerun]] city in southern [[Iran]].  Davani had an estimated 1,000 speakers in 2004.&lt;ref name="salami2004"&gt;Salami, A., 1383 [[Iranian calendar|AP]] / 2004 [[Gregorian calendar|AD]]. Ganjineye guyeššenâsiye Fârs (The treasury of the dialectology of Fars). First Volume, The academy of Persian language and literature. [http://persianacademy.ir/fa/ganjifars01.aspx] {{ISBN|964-7531-32-X}} (in Persian)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
The transcription used here is only an approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Mahamedi, H., 1982. [http://www.azargoshnasp.net/languages/otheriraniandialects/davanishahnameh.pdf The story of Rostam and Esfandiyâr in an Iranian dialect],''Journal of the American Oriental Studies'', 102.3, 451-459.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===
short: â, a, e, i, o, u&lt;br&gt;
long: â:, ā, ē, ī, ō, ū

===Consonants===
*[[voiced dental fricative]]: ð, generally after vowels, like in, 'bað' (bad).
*[[voiced velar fricative]]: γ, like in "γal'ati" (shroud).
*[[alveolar trill]]: like in 'borrâ' (flail).
*[[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]]: inclination for 'g' and 'k' before front vowels, like in 'bega' (say).
*[[voiceless alveolar affricate]]: &lt;u&gt;ts&lt;/u&gt;, like in '&lt;u&gt;ts&lt;/u&gt;e' (what), and [[voiced alveolar affricate|voiced]] &lt;u&gt;dz&lt;/u&gt;, like in an&lt;u&gt;dz&lt;/u&gt;i (fig).

==Grammar==
===Verbs===
Davani is [[Ergative-absolutive language|ergative]] in past transitive constructions.  For example (Persian transliterations are in UniPers):

English: Hasan saw Ali in the garden.&lt;br&gt;
Persian: Hasan,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ali-râ tuye bâq did.&lt;br&gt;
Davani:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;hasan&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;'''-eš'''&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ali&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''-a'''&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;tu&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;bâγ di.

Infinitive markers include ''-san'', ''-tan'', ''-dan'', ''-ðan''.

===Nouns===
The suffix ''-aku'' makes nouns definite.  For example:

''bard'' "stone" → ''bard-aku'' "the stone"

The plural is marked by the suffix ''-gal''. ''-u'' is exceptionally used for "man".  For example:

''sēv'' "apple" → ''sēv-gal'' "apples"&lt;br&gt;
''merd'' "man" → ''merd-u'' "men"

{{Kurds}}
'''Kurdish literature''' (in [[Kurmanji Kurdish language]]: ''[[:ku:Wêje|Wêjeya Kurdî]]'', in [[Sorani Kurdish language]]: وێژەی کوردی or ئەدەبی کوردی) is [[literature]] written in the [[Kurdish language]]. Literary Kurdish works have been written in each of the four main dialects: [[Zazaki]], [[Gorani language (Zaza-Gorani)|Gorani]], [[Kurmanji]] and [[Sorani]]. [[Ali Hariri]]  (1009-1079) is one of the first well-known poets who wrote in Kurdish.&lt;ref&gt;
*A Kurdish grammar: descriptive analysis of the Kurdish of Sulaimaniya, Iraq By Ernest Nasseph McCarus, American council of learned societies, 1958, The University of Michigan, page 6
*Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Volume 2 By University of London School of Oriental and African Studies, JSTOR, 1964, page 507&lt;/ref&gt; He was from the [[Hakkari]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.institutkurde.org/en/language/ |title=The Kurdish Language and Literature |publisher=Institutkurde.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ayyubid Sultanate also saw a Golden Age of Kurdish Literature and was active also outside of Kurdish Mainland. However some Ayyubid Sultans and Emirs also made Arabic Literature or translated them.

Some of the earliest texts written in Kurdish are in the Hawrami dialects. The earliest of these are the classical poems attributed to Elder Shalyar the son of Jamasb, an ancient Zoroastrian priest who lived in the Horaman region. His works are said to date back to several centuries before Christ, as far back as 600 BC. His literary works are collected in what is called "marefat".&lt;ref&gt;http://andaryari.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/blog-post.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Bahadin Sahib, ''Elder Shalyar the Zoroastrian'', Zhian Publications Sulaimaniyah, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first literary works in Kurdish is a poem from the 7th century, written in the Hawremani dialect. The poem, called [[Hurmizgan]], talks about invading [[Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything.explained.at/Hurmizgan/ Hurmizgan Explained]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bulanikbilican.com/yazar.asp?yaziID=694 |title=Binüçyüz Yıl Evvel Yazılmış Kürçe Helbest |accessdate=2011-12-13 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426050705/http://www.bulanikbilican.com/yazar.asp?yaziID=694 |archivedate=April 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some of the well-known [[Gorani language (Zaza-Gorani)|Gorani language]] poets and writers are Parishan Dinawari (d. ca. 1395), Mustafa Besarani (1642–1701), Muhammad Kandulayi (late 17th century), [[Khana Qubadi]] (1700–1759), Shayda Awrami (1784–1852) and [[Mastoureh Ardalan]]) (1805–1848). Zazaki and Gorani which was the literary languages of much of what today is known as Iraqi, Turkish and Iranian Kurdistan, is classified as a member of the [[Zaza–Gorani languages|Zaza–Gorani branch]] of the [[Northwestern Iranian languages]].&lt;ref name=Postgate&gt;J.

== Kurmanji literature ==
A [[Yazidis|Yezidi]] religious work, the ''Meshefa Reş'', is in a classic form of [[Northern Kurdish|Kurmanji]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://yektauzunoglu.com/ku/ji-arsive/1985-bi-kurdi-binivisine-hey-le/#iLightbox%5Bgallery_image_1%5D/2|title=1985 - bi kurdî binivîsîne Hey lê|last=Uzunoglu|first=Yekta|date=1985|work=Yekta Uzunoglu|access-date=2018-07-07|language=Kurdish-Kurmanji}}&lt;/ref&gt; and could well have been written sometime in the 13th century. It is held to have been written by Sheikh Hasan (born 1195 CE), a nephew of [[Sheikh Adi Ibn Musafir]], the prophet of the Yezidis. Based on this date, ''Meshef'' can be considered as the oldest piece of prose in Kurmanji.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The Kurdish poet Muhammad [[Faqi Tayran]] (1590–1660) collected many folk stories in his book ''In the Words of the Black Horse''. He also wrote a book of [[Sufi]] verse, ''The Story of Shaykh of San’ân''. Faqi-Tayran also had versified correspondence with the poet [[Malaye Jaziri]]. Some of the well-known Kurmanji poets and writers are listed below.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

#[[Ali Hariri]] (1009-1079).
#[[Mela Hesenê Bateyî]] (1417–1494) from Hakkari region, who wrote the author of Mawlud, a collection of verse and an [[anthology]];
#Salim Salman, author of ''Yûsif û Zuleyxa'' in 1586;
#[[Malaye Jaziri]] (1570–1640) from ''Buhtan'' region, the famous [[sufi]] poet. His collection of poems contains more than 2,000 verses
#[[Ahmad Khani]] (1651–1707), the author of ''Mam and Zin'', a long poem of 2,650 [[distich]]s, is probably the best known and most popular of the classical Kurdish poets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Kreyenbroek |first= Philip g. | title=KURDISH WRITTEN LITERATURE | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica | accessdate=2009-06-04|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kurdish-written-literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Ismail Bayazid]]i (1654–1710), author of a Kurmanji-[[Arabic language|Arabic]]-[[Persian language|Persian]] dictionary for children, entitled ''Guljen''.

===The tragedy of ''Mam and Zin''===
The drama of ''Mem û Zîn'' (Mam and Zin) (Memî Alan û Zînî Buhtan), was written in 1694 by [[Ahmad Khani]] (1651–1707) from Hakkari, is a rich source of Kurdish culture, history and mythology. This work also emphasizes the [[nationalism|national]] aspirations of the Kurdish people. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}
 
Mam of the Alan [[clan]] and Zin of Buhtan family are two lovers from ''Alan'' and ''Butan'' families, respectively. Their union is blocked by a person named ''Bakr'' of the Bakran clan. Mam eventually dies during a complicated conspiracy by Bakr. When Zin receives the news, she also dies while mourning the death of Mam on his grave. The immense grief leads to her death and she is buried next to Mam. The news of the death of Mam and Zin, spreads quickly among the people of ''Jazira Butan''. Then Bakr's role in the [[tragedy]] is revealed, and he takes sanctuary between the two graves. He is eventually captured and slain by the people of Jazira. A thorn bush soon grows out of Bakr’s blood, sending its roots of malice deep into the earth between the lovers’ graves, separating the two even after their death.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Contemporary Kurmanji literature===
The first Kurmanji newspaper, titled ''Kurdistan'', was published in [[Cairo]] in 1898. The Kurds in the [[Soviet Union]], despite their small numbers, had the opportunity of elementary and university education in Kurdish and for many decades. This in turn led to an appearance of several Kurdish writers and researchers among them. The literary works of [[Qanate Kurdo]] and [[Arab Shamilov]] are the well known examples of Kurdish prose in the 20th century. The first modern [[Latin]]-based alphabet for Kurdish was created by [[Jaladat Ali Badirkhan]], the poet and writer who fled Turkey in the 1920s and spent the rest of his life in [[Syria]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}
 
Since the 1970s, there has been a massive effort on the part of Kurds in [[Turkey]] to write and to create literary works in Kurdish. The amount of printed material during the last three decades has increased enormously. Many of these activities were centered in [[Europe]] particularly [[Sweden]] and [[Germany]] where many of the immigrant Kurds are living. There are a number of Kurdish publishers in Sweden, partly supported by the [[Swedish Government]]. More than two hundred Kurdish titles have appeared in the 1990s. Some of the well known contemporary Kurdish writers from [[Turkey]] are [[Firat Cewerî]], [[Mehmed Uzun]], [[Abdusamet Yigit]], [[Mehmed Emin Bozarslan]], [[Mahmud Baksi]], [[Hesenê Metê]],[[Yekta Uzunoglu]] (Geylani)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://yektauzunoglu.com/ku/ji-arsive/1985-bi-kurdi-binivisine-hey-le/#iLightbox%5Bgallery_image_1%5D/2|title=1985 - bi kurdî binivîsîne Hey lê|last=Uzunoglu|first=Yekta|date=1996|work=Yekta Uzunoglu|access-date=2018-07-07|language=Kurdish}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Arjen Arî]] and [[Rojen Barnas]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The main academic center for Kurdish literature and language in [[Europe]] is the [[Kurdish Institute of Paris]] (''Institut Kurde de Paris'') founded in 1983. A large number of Kurdish intellectuals and writers from Europe, America and Australia are contributing to the efforts carried out by the Institute for reviving Kurdish language and literature.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Sorani literature ==
[[File:Ahmadi manuscript.JPG|thumbnail|A manuscript of Ahmadi dictionary by Shex Marof Nodê (1753-1838) from the archive of legacy committee of Vejin. This manuscript is written in 1928.]]
In contrast to Kurmanji, literary works in [[Central Kurdish|Sorani]] appeared only in the late 18th century and early 19th century. [[Nalî]] was the first to write poetry in this dialect. and [[Haji Qadir Koyi]] of ''[[Koi Sanjaq|Koy Sanjaq]]'' in central Kurdistan (1817–1897), and [[Sheikh Reza Talabani]] (1835–1909) also wrote in Sorani dialect after [[Nalî]]. The closeness of the two dialects of Sorani and Kurmanji is cited as one of the reasons for the late start in Sorani literature, as well as the fact that during 15th to 19th century, there was a rich literary tradition in the Kurmanji dialect.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Despite its late start, Sorani literature progressed with a rapid pace, especially during the early 20th century and after recognition of Sorani as the main language of Kurds in [[Iraq]]. The language rights of Kurds were guaranteed by the [[United Kingdom|British]] and school education in Kurdish started in earnest in the early 1920s. It is estimated that almost 80% of the existing Kurdish literature in the 20th century has been written in Sorani dialect.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Increased contact with the Arab world and subsequently western world led to a translation movement among Kurds in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] in the early 20th century. Many classical literary works of Europe were translated into Sorani, including the works of [[Pushkin]], [[Schiller]], [[Byron]] and [[Lamartine]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Kurdish is one of the official languages of [[Iraq]] and the central government assistance has been instrumental in supporting publication of books and magazines in Kurdish. In the 1970s, an organization called ''Korî Zaniyarî Kurd'' (the Kurdish Science Council) was established for academic studies in Kurdish language and literature. It was centered in [[Baghdad]]. Kurdish language departments were also opened in some Iraqi universities including [[Baghdad University]], [[University of Salahaddin]] and [[University of Sulaimani]]. Well-known Sorani poets include [[Abdulla Goran]] (founder of the [[free verse]] poetry in Kurdish), [[Sherko Bekas]], [[Abdulla Pashew]], Qanih. Many Kurdish writers have written [[novels]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and literary analysis including [[Piramerd]], [[Alaaddin Sajadi]], [[Bachtyar Ali|Bakhtyar Ali]], [[Ibrahim Ahmad]], [[Karim Hisami]] and [[Hejar]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3308">The Swedish psychologist and university professor [[Heinz Leymann]] developed the '''LIPT''' questionnaire. LIPT stands for ''Leymann Inventory of Psychological Terror''.

== Structure ==
The '''LIPT''' questionnaire lists 45 [[mobbing]] actions at the workplace. A person is regarded as being [[Workplace bullying|bullied]] if one or more of the 45 actions happen at least once per week over a period of at least one year. Alternative mobbing definitions require a shorter period of at least 3–6 months and the frequent occurrence of more than one action.

The effects of the actions on the mobbing victim are divided into five categories:

# Effects on self-expression and communication, e.g., the mobbing victim is constantly interrupted, criticized, or yelled at.
# Effects on social contacts, e.g., colleagues and coworkers are forbidden to talk with the victim.
# Effects on personal reputation, e.g., unfounded rumors about the mobbing victim are circulated.
# Effects on occupational situation and quality of life, e.g., the victim is given meaningless jobs or tasks that affect the self-esteem.
# Effects on physical health, e.g., threats of physical violence, damage to the workplace, or outright sexual harassment.

== Completeness ==
The 45 mobbing actions are derived by Leymann from 300 individual interviews in the years of 1981 to 1984. After 1984 the interviews did not find further actions and ended.

'''Malbars''' or '''Malabars''' are an ethnic group of [[South India]]n [[Tamils|Tamil]] origin in [[Réunion]], a French island in the Southwest [[Indian Ocean]], The Malbars constitute 25% of the population of [[Réunion]] and are estimated to be around 180,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter6.pdf|title=Réunion|last=|first=|date=|website=The Indian Diaspora|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been people of South Indian origin on the island since the 17th century, and those were mostly from [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Drinking: anthropological approaches Volume 4 of Anthropology of food and nutrition |last=de Garine |first=Valerie |authorlink=Valerie de Garine |year=2001 |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn= 9781571818096 |page=225 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PdCJjFrxMewC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=tamil+reunion#v=onepage&amp;q=tamil%20reunion&amp;f=false |accessdate=2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most were originally brought in as indentured labourers in the second half of the 19th century and were mostly [[South Indian]] Tamils .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiandiaspora.nic.in|title=The Indian Diaspora|work=indiandiaspora.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Malbars have developed some patterns of behaviour that are not quite those of their ancestors from [[Tamil Nadu]] nor those of the other inhabitants of Réunion.

==Etymology==
Malbars is derived from the word [[wikt:Malabar|Malabar]], a term which was used often by the French and other Westerners to refer to all [[South India|Southern Indians]], including the [[Tamils]], [[Malayalees]], [[Telugus]] and [[Kannadigas]]. This term is based on the [[Malabar region]] of the present state of [[Kerala]] in [[India]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/SSEAL/SouthAsia/tamil.html|title=Indentured immigration and social accommodation in La Reunion|work=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term, applied by the French to Tamil labourers coming to Réunion, has been kept by the latter and others on the island to label their own identity.

==History==
Indian workers came to Réunion from South India, mostly from French settlements in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]], and [[Karaikal]]. Most of these immigrants were ritually low in the [[caste system in India|caste system]].&lt;ref name="ghasarian"&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Ghasarian |first1=Christian |year=1997 |title=We Have the Best Gods! The Encounter Between Hinduism and Christianity in La Réunion |journal=African and Asian Studies |volume=32 |issue= 3|pages=286–295 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/afas/1997/00000032/F0020003/art00007 |doi=10.1163/156852197X00079 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hard living conditions at home were the main reason behind their departure to La Réunion. The immigration of [[indentured workers]] from South India started in 1827 but it was only after 1848 that indentured immigration began on a big scale.&lt;ref&gt;Ghasarian, Christian. 1990. "Indianit La Réunion: gestion d'une double identit", Vibre au pluriel. Production sociale des identits l'le Maurice et  l'le de La Réunion, J.L. Albert (ed.), Université de La Réunion/URA 1041 du CNRS.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acculturation==
The French government in Réunion made the first Malbars become Christian.&lt;ref name="ghasarian"/&gt; However, many Malbars were only nominally Christian.&lt;ref name="ghasarian"/&gt; The [[Tamil language]] was lost to [[language shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=N. Nandhivarman|title=The Tamils of Réunion and their hybrid culture|periodical=New Indian Express|year=2009|url=http://www.dravidaperavai.org.in/topic_viewer.php?art=21&amp;xfile=1}}: "Réunion is a typical example of outsourcing by the French East India Company, and its history reveals how an hybrid culture emanated amidst Tamil settlers there, who are Tamils but could not speak Tamil, their mother tongue lost in the interregnum of 5 generations of separation from their homeland ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments==
The Malbars desire to learn their ancestors' culture, and started studying their language and religions especially from [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref name="diaspora"/&gt; Recently many Malbars, particularly those of upper and middle classes, have started to become completely [[Hindu]] rather than nominally Christian.&lt;ref name="Creolisation"&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Medea |first1=Laurent |year=2002 |title=Creolisation and Globalisation in a Neo-Colonial Context: the Case of Réunion |journal=Social Identities |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=125–141 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a713696595&amp;db=all |doi=10.1080/13504630220132053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also now wanted to translate their newly acquired civic and political rights into a gradual and increasing participation in local and other elections. A sit-in protest was organised to support [[Sri Lankan Tamil people|Sri Lanka Tamils]] by the Réunionnais organisation ''TAMIL SANGAM'' presided by ''Dr Shanmugam''. Hundreds of Tamils and non Tamils protested against the genocide of [[Sri Lankan Tamil people|Sri Lanka Tamils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tamilnation.co/diaspora/reunion.htm|title=Tamil Diaspora - Reunion|author=|date=|website=tamilnation.co|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
A genetic study has shown that the majority of the Indian origins of Malbars lie in the South-east of India. A significantly larger proportion comes from [[Andhra Pradesh]], and [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref name="admixture"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inter- and extra-Indian admixture and genetic diversity in Réunion island revealed by analysis of mitochondrial DNA |journal=Annals of Human Genetics |author=Dubut V, Murail P, Pech N, Thionville MD, Cartault F. |pmid=19397558 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.2009.00519.x |volume=73 |issue=Pt 3 |date=May 2009 |pages=314–34|last2=Murail |last3=Pech |last4=Thionville |last5=Cartault }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The study also showed that 15-20% of the origins of Malbars come from India. Less than 1% comes from Europe.&lt;ref name="admixture"/&gt;

'''Masalit''' (autonym ''Masala/Masara'') ({{Lang-ar|ماساليت}}) is a [[Maban language]] spoken by the [[Masalit people]] in western [[Darfur]], [[Sudan]].

The Masalit language has two [[sociolect]]s: "heavy" Masalit, spoken by higher-ranking people and those in the countryside, with a complicated [[agglutinative]] grammar, and "light", spoken particularly in the home and in the market, with a somewhat simplified grammatical structure and many borrowings from [[Sudanese Arabic]], the regional [[lingua franca]] and language of education.

A group of Masalit known as the ''Massalat'' moved west into central-eastern [[Chad]] and have almost entirely switched to [[Arabic]]. Their ethnic population in Chad was {{sigfig|29,800|2}} as of the 1993 census, but only 10 speakers of their language were reported in 1991.&lt;ref name=e18&gt;{{Ethnologue18|mls}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mikrani''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|k|r|ɑː|n|i}}; [[Devanagari]]: मिकरानी, {{lang-ur|مکرانی}}) are a [[Muslim]] community found in the [[Sarlahi District|Sarlahi]] and [[Rautahat District|Rautahat]] districts of [[Nepal]], [[Bihar]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Gujarat]] in [[India]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Gaibandha District|Gaibandha]], [[Dinajpur District, Bangladesh|Dinajpur]], [[Old Dhaka]] in [[Bangladesh]] as well as in [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI Part Two edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 828–833&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known as Mukeri, [[Makrani caste|Makrani]], Mekrani, Barmaki, Ranki and Muzkeri.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Two edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 995 to 999&lt;/ref&gt; They belong to the [[Muker tribe]] and the Mikrani title is mostly used in [[Nepal]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] while some also use Mukeri or Miya Mukeri.

==History and origin==
The word ''Muker'' is said to have derived from [[Arabic]] ''makeri'', meaning those who helped in the construction of [[Mecca]]. They were initially called ''Makkai'', which referred to residents of [[Mecca]], which was later corrupted to ''makeri''. They are divided into two endogamous groups, the Mukeri and Shaikh Banjara. They rank themselves as [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]]. The Shaikh Banjara are further divided into the Mikrani, Muqri, Barmaki, Siddiqui and Shaikh. Different groups have different traditions to their origin.

The Mukeri or Muker in [[Bihar]] and [[Nepal]] claim to be descendants of early [[Arab]] settlers, whose initial area of settlement in [[South Asia]] was the [[Makran]] region. According to their tradition they arrived in [[Bihar]] during the period of [[Khalji dynasty|Khalji]] ruler, and were initially known as Makrani, which was eventually shortened to Muker.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Bihar Volume XVI Part One edited by S Gopal &amp; Hetukar Jha pages 692 to 693 Seagull Books&lt;/ref&gt; They are found in [[Sarlahi]] district ([[Malangwa]], [[Bhadsar]], [[Masaili]], Khutauna, [[Simara, Sarlahi|Pakadi]], [[Murtiya]], [[Parsa District|Parsa]], [[Haripur, Janakpur|Haripur]], [[Lalbandi]], [[Hariyon]], [[Ishworpur]] villages) [[Rautahat]] district ([[Gaur]] and [[Rajdevi|kattarban]] villages).{{sfn|Niroula|1998}} They speak [[Urdu]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and the local [[Angika]] language.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Bihar Volume XVI Part One edited by S Gopal &amp; Hetukar Jha pages 692 to 693 Seagull Books&lt;/ref&gt; Those who lives in Bangladesh speaks in Bengali. Sarlahi district is the district of Nepal, where majority of Mikrani community lives.

==Tradition==
The Muker were traditionally businessman, moving from place to place, selling goods. They historically traded scented [[oil]], aromatic goods, food grains, [[tobacco]], leather products and cattle. Many are now settled agriculturalists. The community are Muslim of the Sunni sect.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Two edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 995&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the were the Islamic Dayee (inviter), a caller who notifies the others from dangers.

The '''National Statistics Institute of Chile''' ({{lang-es|link=no|Instituto Nacional de Estadística de Chile}}, INE) is a state-run organization of the [[Government of Chile]], created in the second half of the 19th century and tasked with performing a general census of population and housing, then collecting, producing and publishing official demographic statistics of people in [[Chile]], in addition to other specific tasks entrusted to it by law.

==Background==
Its antecedents lie in the initiatives of president [[Manuel Bulnes]] and his minister, Manuel Rengifo, to draw up the second population census and obtain statistical data of the country. By Decree No. 18 March 27, 1843, the Office of Statistics was created, [[Ministry of the Interior (Chile)|Ministry of the Interior]] to provide knowledge of the departments and provinces. It put the INE in charge of producing the national population census every 10 years, as required by the Census Act of July 12, 1843.

Law No. 187 of September 17, 1847 established the office as a permanent body of the state. By 1853, it was legally required that each section chief of the ministries collect and submit data to the Bureau of Statistics. Subsequently and by various legal modifications, it was called ''Dirección General de Estadísticas'' (1927–1953), ''Servicio Nacional de Estadísticas y Censos'' (1953–1960), ''Dirección de Estadísticas y Censos'' (1960–1970). It has called by its current name since 1970, and it has been under the [[Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism|Ministry of Economy]] since 1927.

==Publications==
The first official publication, National Repertoire (''Repertorio Nacional''), was released in 1850. It was followed by the Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Chile (''Anuario Estadístico de la República de Chile'') published without interruption from 1837 to 1866.

In 1882 they published ''Statistical and Geographical Synopsis of Chile'' (''Sinopsis Estadística y Geografía de Chile''). In 1911, they began publishing independent volumes of statistics by subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7453">'''Rawal''' (also spelled '''Raval''') or '''Raol''' originally is a (regional) variation -like [[Rawat (title)|Rawat]]- of the Hindi princely ruler title [[Raja|Ra(d)ja(h)]] (literally "king"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lindsey Harlan |title=Religion and Rajput Women: The Ethic of Protection in Contemporary Narratives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7HLrPYOe38gC&amp;pg=PA28 |year=1992 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-07339-5 |page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) used in some [[princely state]]s in [[Rajputana]] and Western India (notably Gujarat), and is now also used as a caste designation or surname by several communities in Southern Asia. Rawal caste is mentioned at 50th number in the scheduled caste list of Rajasthan.

== Princely titles ==
The sovereign king of [[Jumla district|Jumla Kingdom]] and founder of the [[Kallala dynasty]], Balirāja took the royal title of ''Rāulā''.&lt;ref name="Surya Mani Adhikary"&gt;{{cite book |author=Surya Mani Adhikary |title=The Khaśa kingdom: a trans-Himalayan empire of the middle age |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cH5uAAAAMAAJ |year=1997 |publisher=Nirala |isbn=978-81-85693-50-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable (but non-salute) states using this title for their ruling prince were, both under the colonial [[Mahi Kantha Agency]] (in the third -high- of seven classes of states) and in present [[Gujarat]] :
* the Raol of [[Malpur State|Malpur]]
* the Raol of [[Mansa State|Mansa]]

=== Maharawal ===

The title ''Maharawal'' ("Great Rawal") derives from the [[Sanskrit]] ''Maharajakula'', and was used by the [[Guhila dynasty|Guhila]] rulers in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kalyan Kumar Ganguli |title=Cultural History Of Rajasthan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PXstAAAAMAAJ |year=1983 |publisher=Sundeep Prakashan |oclc=461886025 |p=120 |quote="...the ruling prince Ratna Simha is found to have been qualified in his inscription as a Maharajakula coloqualised as Maharawal." }}&lt;/ref&gt; This 'Western' equivalent of the higher (gradually deflated) Hindi title [[Maharaja]] (literally 'great king') was notably used by three [[salute state]]s in [[Rajputana]] (presently in [[Rajasthan]]), all entitled to a (high-ranking) Hereditary [[gun salute]] of 15-guns :
* the Maharawal (also called Maharaja) of [[Jaisalmer State|Jaisalmer]]
* the Maharawal of [[Banswara State|Banswara]]
* the Maharawal of [[Dungarpur State|Dungarpur]]
 
and one in [[Gujarat]], entitled to a (rather low-ranking) Hereditary salute of 9-guns (11-guns personal) :
* the Maharaol (or Maharawal) of [[Bariya State|Bari(y)a]]

The 2008 film '''''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]''''' has been a subject of discussion among a variety of people in [[India]] and the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]]. Some film critics have responded positively to the film. At the same time, others objected to issues such as Jamal's use of [[British English]] or the fact that similar films by Indian filmmakers have not received equal recognition. A few notable filmmakers such as [[Aamir Khan]] and [[Priyadarshan]] have been critical of the film. Author and critic [[Salman Rushdie]] argues that it has "a patently ridiculous conceit." &lt;ref name="pickle" /&gt;

== Response from film critics ==
The film received positive reviews from many Indian film critics, though some were negative and others mixed. According to ''All Bollywood'', the film has an average rating of 81% based on an aggregate of 25 reviews from Indian film critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slumdog Millionaire|publisher=All Bollywood|url=http://www.allbollywood.com/movies/bd/2009/1030/slumdog_millionaire|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206124308/http://www.allbollywood.com/movies/bd/2009/1030/slumdog_millionaire/|archivedate=6 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was praised by Nikhat Kazmi of the ''[[Times of India]]'' who referred to ''Slumdog Millionaire'' as "a piece of riveting cinema, meant to be savoured as a [[Cinderella]]-like fairy tale, with the edge of a thriller and the vision of an artist." She also argued against criticism of the film, stating: "it was never meant to be a documentary on the down and out in [[Dharavi]]. And it isn't."&lt;ref name=timesofindiarev&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/english/Slumdog-Millionaire/movie-review/4018046.cms|title=Slumdog Millionaire:Movie Review| work=[[Times of India]]| last=Kazmi| first=Nikhat| date=22 January 2009| accessdate=22 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renuka Vyavahare of ''[[Indiatimes]]'' suggested that "the film is indeed very Indian" and that it is "one of the best English films set in India and revolving around the country’s most popular metropolis Mumbai."&lt;ref name=indiatimesrev&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies.indiatimes.com/moviereview/4012828.cms|title=Movie Review: Slumdog Millionaire| work=[[Indiatimes]]| last=Vyavahare| first=Renuka| date=22 January 2009| accessdate=22 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaveree Bamzai of ''[[India Today]]'' called the film "feisty" and argued that it is "Indian at its core and Western in its technical flourish."&lt;ref name=indiatoday&gt;{{cite news| url=http://indiatoday.digitaltoday.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26128&amp;sectionid=67&amp;Itemid=1&amp;issueid=89|title=Maximum movie about maximum city| work=[[India Today]]| last=Bamzai| first=Kaveree| date=24 January 2009| accessdate=24 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anand Giridharadas argued in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that the film has a "freshness" which "portrays a changing India, with great realism, as something India long resisted being: a land of self-makers, where a scruffy son of the slums can, solely of his own effort, hoist himself up, flout his origins, break with fate." Giridharadas also called the film "a tribute to the irrepressible self."&lt;ref name=nytjan17&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/18/weekinreview/18giridharadas.html|title=Horatio Alger Relocates to a Mumbai Slum| work=[[New York Times]]| last=Giridharadas| first=Anand| date=17 January 2009| accessdate=17 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poorna Shetty stated in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that "Boyle's depiction of Mumbai is spot on." She further stated that the film displays the "human aspect of the slums and the irrepressible energy and life force of the place" and offers "a breathing snapshot of the city that is always stripped of its warmth when depicted in the news."&lt;ref name=guardjan18&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/18/slumdog-millionaire-british-asian-reaction|title=So what do British Asians think of Slumdog Millionaire?| work=[[The Guardian]]| last=Shetty| first=Poorna| date=18 January 2009| accessdate=18 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khalid Mohamed]] gave the film a rave review and a 5-star rating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=f4fb1dc4-c735-4860-9748-1c03e28ccbcf "Cuts Straight to the Heart"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701024101/http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=f4fb1dc4-c735-4860-9748-1c03e28ccbcf |date=1 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others were more critical of the film. One common complaint was directed towards Patel's use of [[British English]] which was never explained within the context of the film.  In referring to this issue, Mukul Kesavan of ''[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)]]'' stated that the film is "a hybrid so odd" (due to the decision to have the first third in Hindi and the remainder in English) "that it becomes hard for the Indian viewer to ... suspend disbelief" and that "the transition from child actors who in real life are slum children to young actors who are, just as clearly, middle-class anglophones is so abrupt and inexplicable that it subverts the ‘realism’ of the brilliantly shot squalor in which their lives play out."&lt;ref name=koltel&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1090205/jsp/opinion/story_10485740.jsp|title=Lost In Translation| work=[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)]]| last=Kesavan| first=Muku| date=5 February 2009| accessdate=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Gautaman Bhaskaran argued that  although the film was shot in India, it is not Indian in character. He questioned the "euphoria in India" after the film's release there, arguing that with a few exceptions, "there is nothing Indian about this film."  He concluded that the film has "very little substance" and is "superficial and insensitive."&lt;ref name=seoulrev&gt;{{cite news| url=http://theseoultimes.com/ST/?url=/ST/db/read.php?idx=7889|title=Slumdog Millionaire: A Warped Picture of India| work=The Seoul Times| last=Bhaskaran| first=Gautaman| date=24 January 2009| accessdate=24 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more contentious argument lay in the assertion that Indians have already made better and more realistic films about poverty and corruption in India.  [[Subhash K. Jha]] (author of ''The Essential Guide to Bollywood'') remarked that this territory has already been covered by Indian filmmakers ([[Mira Nair]] in ''[[Salaam Bombay]]'' and [[Satyajit Ray]] in the [[Apu Trilogy]]).&lt;ref name=jha&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/features/2009/01/22/4762/|title=Subhash K Jha speaks about Slumdog Millionaire| work=[[Bollywood Hungama]]| last=Jha| first=Subhash K.| date=22 January 2009| accessdate=22 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Soutik Biswas of the [[BBC]] argued that ''Slumdog Millionaire'' is an imitation of [[Cinema of India|Indian films]] that have been "routinely ignored," suggesting that "if you are looking for gritty realism set in the badlands of Mumbai, order a DVD of a film called ''[[Satya (1998 film)|Satya]]'' by [[Ram Gopal Varma|Ramgopal Verma]]. The 1998 feature on an immigrant who is sucked into Mumbai's colourful underworld makes ''Slumdog'' look like a slick, uplifting [[MTV]] [[docu-drama]]."&lt;ref name=BBCrev&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7843960.stm|title='Why Slumdog fails to move me'| work=[[BBC]]| last=Biswas| first=Soutik| date=22 January 2009| accessdate=22 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Matthew Schneeberger, an American working as a journalist in India, opined: {{quote|"Say an Indian director travelled to New Orleans for a few months to film a movie about Jamal Martin, an impoverished [[African American]] who lost his home in [[Hurricane Katrina]], who once had a promising basketball career, but who -- following a drive-by shooting -- now walks with a permanent limp, whose father is in jail for selling drugs, whose mother is addicted to crack cocaine, whose younger sister was killed by gang-violence, whose brother was arrested by corrupt cops, whose first born child has sickle cell anaemia, and so on. The movie would be widely panned and laughed out of theatres."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/movies/2009/jan/29is-slumdog-worth-it.htm Review]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Finally, a fourth argument is that a "happy ending" film about slum-dwellers is inherently misleading.  For example, Sudip Mazumdar of ''[[Newsweek]]'' wrote:

{{quote|"People keep praising the film's 'realistic' depiction of slum life in India. But it's no such thing. Slum life is a cage. It robs you of confidence in the face of the rich and the advantaged. It steals your pride, deadens your ambition, limits your imagination and psychologically cripples you whenever you step outside the comfort zone of your own neighborhood. Most people in the slums never achieve a fairy-tale ending." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/185798 Man Bites Slumdog] by Sudip Mazumdar, ''Newsweek'', February 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Response from filmmakers and actors ==
[[File:AamirKhan.jpg|thumb|100 px|[[Aamir Khan]]]]

In an interview after the Oscars, actor and filmmaker [[Aamir Khan]] argued that he didn't "see Slumdog ... as an Indian film. I think it is a film about India like ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (that) was made by [[Richard Attenborough|Sir Richard Attenborough]]. Similarly, ''Slumdog''... is about India but it is not an Indian film." &lt;ref name=aamirkhan2&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=HomePage&amp;id=13a498e1-7e3a-447d-96f7-bede2011bbc5&amp;MatchID1=4892&amp;TeamID1=1&amp;TeamID2=5&amp;MatchType1=2&amp;SeriesID1=1235&amp;PrimaryID=4892&amp;Headline=I+don%27t+make+films+for+awards%3a+Aamir+Khan| title=I don’t make films for awards: Aamir Khan| work=[[Hindustan Times]]| last=[[Indo-Asian News Service]]| date=31 January 2009| accessdate=31 January 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204101027/http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=HomePage&amp;id=13a498e1-7e3a-447d-96f7-bede2011bbc5&amp;MatchID1=4892&amp;TeamID1=1&amp;TeamID2=5&amp;MatchType1=2&amp;SeriesID1=1235&amp;PrimaryID=4892&amp;Headline=I+don%27t+make+films+for+awards%3A+Aamir+Khan| archivedate=4 February 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aamirkhan&gt;{{cite news| url=http://indiatoday.digitaltoday.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;issueid=31&amp;task=view&amp;id=26844&amp;sectionid=67&amp;Itemid=1|title=No Obama-like leader in Indian politics: Aamir| work=[[India Today]]| last=[[Press Trust of India]]| date=31 January 2009| accessdate=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in another interview, he did praise India's Oscar-winning [[Resul Pookutty]] in the interview &lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.ndtv.com/newstory.asp?section=Movies&amp;Slug=I+am+happy+for+Slumdog%3A+Aamir+Khan&amp;Id=ENTEN20090084475&amp;keywords=bollywood I am happy for Slumdog: Aamir Khan]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as India's Oscar-winners [[A.

Rahman]] and [[Gulzar]] in his personal blog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aamirkhan.com/blog/login.php?topicid=668 Aamir Khan's Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Deepa Mehta]] also noted in an interview that while ''Slumdog Millionaire's'' Oscar win was, "good for the team, the film is an OK one...it's more a Western than Indian film." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glamsham.com/movies/interviews/28-deepa-mehta-interview-030918.asp Interview : Deepa Mehta]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shahrukh Khan]], the film's producers' first choice of actor to play game show host Prem Kumar, defended it, stating "I think it's really nice that it will open doors for people to understand that there is a lot of visual appeal to India. I hear a lot of people saying that India has been shown in bad light. But then my logic to everyone is that why is it that somebody comes from outside and makes a film like ''Gandhi'' and ''Slumdog''...all we can say about it is that it is showing India in a poor light?"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-shah-rukh-khan-slams-slumdog-millionaire-critics-1229053&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahesh Manjrekar]] who portrayed the gangster Javed in ''Slumdog Millionaire'' commented on the fact that ''[[Taare Zameen Par]]'' (released overseas by Disney as ''Like Stars on Earth''), India's submission for best foreign film, failed to make the short list of nominations and was [[Taare Zameen Par (Like Stars on Earth)#2009 Academy Awards submission and Slumdog Millionaire|frequently compared with ''Slumdog Millionaire'' in the Indian media]]. He stated that ''Slumdog Millionaire'' "was an amusing phenomenon! Everybody came out of the woodwork all of a sudden. It was humorous. It was like a team had won a match and the extras in the stand were dancing more than the actual Team XI. But, Slumdog... did some good things for us. It was more Hindi than any of our Hindi films. If any Indian filmmaker would’ve made it, the critics would’ve termed it a ‘convenient film’. I’m sad that Aamir [Khan]’s ''Taare Zameen Par'' didn’t make it to the final round of the Oscars. I thought it to be way better than Slumdog..., without taking away anything from Boyle and the kids. But, Indian movies are underestimated there."&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-04-26/news-interviews/28013591_1_marathi-films-marathi-movies-silent-film No more acting for me: Mahesh Manjrekar]&lt;/ref&gt; Filmmaker [[Mrinal Sen]] also questioned whether winning the Oscar qualifies ''Slumdog Millionaire'' as a good film, stating that other great cinematic performers and filmmakers have not won the Oscar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/holnus/009200905141480.htm Oscars do not make 'Slumdog' great film: Mrinal Sen]&lt;/ref&gt;

Director and filmmaker [[Priyadarshan]] criticized ''Slumdog Millionaire'' as a "mediocre version of those commercial films about estranged brothers and childhood sweethearts that [[Salim-Javed]] used to write so brilliantly in the 1970s." He also stated that he viewed the film at the Toronto Film Festival and that "the Westerners loved it. All the Indian[s] hated it. The West loves to see us as a wasteland, filled with horror stories of exploitation and degradation. But is that all there is to our beautiful city of Mumbai?"&lt;ref name=priya&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies.ndtv.com/newstory.asp?section=Movies&amp;id=ENTEN20090082084| title=Slumdog... is trashy: Priyadarshan| work=[[NDTV]]| last=Jha| first=Subhash K.| date=1 February 2009| accessdate=1 February 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204105830/http://movies.ndtv.com/newstory.asp?section=Movies&amp;id=ENTEN20090082084| archivedate=4 February 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmaker [[Aadesh Shrivastava]] claimed that its release in the [[United States]] led to the word "slumdog" being used as a [[ethnic slur|slur]] against [[Indian American]]s, criticizing the positive reaction by some Indians towards what he regarded as a film that directly attacks and insults India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/2009/02/19/12563/index.html Aadesh Shrivastava outraged at Bachchan's portrayal in Slumdog Millionaire], bollywoodhungama.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response from scholars and authors ==
[[File:Salman Rushdie in New York City 2008.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Salman Rushdie]]]]

Author and critic [[Salman Rushdie]] has responded negatively to both the film ''Slumdog Millionaire'' and the novel on which it is based, ''[[Q &amp; A (novel)|Q &amp; A]]''. In his essay on film adaptations,  "A Fine Pickle," Rushdie argues that the plot of Swarup's novel is "a patently ridiculous conceit, the kind of fantasy writing that gives fantasy writing a bad name. It is a plot device faithfully preserved by the film-makers, and lies at the heart of the weirdly renamed ''Slumdog Millionaire''. As a result the film, too, beggars belief." &lt;ref name="pickle"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/28/salman-rushdie-novels-film-adaptations|title= A Fine Pickle| work=The Guardian| last=Rushdie| first=Salman| date=28 February 2009| accessdate=1 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made similar statements about ''Slumdog Millionaire'' in a talk given at [[Emory University]], where he is a professor, arguing that its plot "piles impossibility on impossibility," &lt;ref name=emory&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ajc.com/services/content/printedition/2009/02/23/rushdie0223.html%3Fcxntlid%3Dinform_sr|title= Slumdog’ no hit with Rushdie| work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution| last=Hart| first=Ariel| date=23 February 2009| accessdate=1 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in an earlier interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', where he conceded that he found the film "visually brilliant. But I have problems with the story line.... It just couldn’t happen. I’m not averse to [[magic realism]] but there has to be a level of plausibility, and I felt there were three or four moments in the film where the storyline breached that rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/06/salman-rushdie-oscar-prognosticator/|title=Salman Rushdie, Oscar Prognosticator| work=[[New York Times]]| date=6 January 2009| accessdate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rushdie also blasted Boyle's admission that he made the film in part because he was unfamiliar with India,  challenging Boyle to imagine "an Indian film director making a movie about New York low-life and saying that he had done so because he knew nothing about New York and had indeed never been there. He would have been torn limb from limb by critical opinion. But for a first world director to say that about the third world is considered praiseworthy, an indication of his artistic daring. The double standards of [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial attitudes]] have not yet wholly faded away."&lt;ref name="pickle" /&gt;

Some critics have suggested that the film is an imitation of "homegrown" Indian products. Radha Chadha, co-author (with Paul Husband) of ''The Cult of the Luxury Brand: Inside Asia's Love Affair with Luxury'', argued that while ''Slumdog Millionaire'' is entertaining, it is still a "[[Masala (film genre)|masala film]]," the kind of [[Bollywood]] product which Indians grow up watching. As to its popularity in the West, she further suggested that what is "ordinary" (in terms of [[film genre]]) for an Indian audience "is extraordinary for the world" and that "the mesmerizing soft power of Bollywood which has kept a billion Indians enthralled for decades is touching the rest of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.livemint.com/blogs/luxury_cult/archive/2009/01/17/the-slumdog-millionnaire-route-to-luxury.aspx| title=The Slumdog Millionaire Route to Luxury| work=[[Mint (newspaper)|Livemint]]| last=Chadha| first=Radha| date=17 January 2009| accessdate=17 January 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122234746/http://blogs.livemint.com/blogs/luxury_cult/archive/2009/01/17/the-slumdog-millionnaire-route-to-luxury.aspx| archivedate=22 January 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priya Joshi, an associate professor of English at [[Temple University]], argued that the film's indebtedness to Bollywood cinema runs far deeper than the happy ending: "In the same way that ''[[Cinema Paradiso]]'' paid homage to the transformative power of Hollywood movies of the 1940s, ''Slumdog'' testifies to the power of Bollywood's blockbusters from the 1970s, and it's no accident that the first question on the quiz show is about the 1973 hit ''[[Zanjeer (1973 film)|Zanjeer]]''."&lt;ref&gt;Kim Fisher, [http://www.temple.edu/newsroom/2008_2009/02/stories/slumdog.htm Temple’s Priya Joshi explains why Slumdog Millionaire has won our hearts,] [[Temple News]], January 2009 (accessed 2009 January 19).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ananda Mitra, professor of communication at [[Wake Forest University]], described ''Slumdog Millionaire'' as a modern-day retelling of 1970s [[Bollywood]] films, citing [[Nasir Hussain]]'s ''[[Yaadon Ki Baraat]]'' (1973) in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Slumdog Millionaire" seeks inspiration from Bollywood of 70s, says expert|date=31 January 2009|publisher=[[Asian News International]]|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/entertainment/slumdog-millionaire-seeks-inspiration-from-bollywood-of-70s-says-expert_100149354.html|accessdate=2009-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have echoed the critiques of Mukul Kesavan and Aamir Khan above concerning language use.  For example, Smitha Radhakrishnan, assistant professor of sociology at [[Wellesley College]], noted in [[UCLA]]'s online Asia Pacific Arts journal that although the film offers "an action-packed, devastating, intriguing, and oddly beautiful world," it also contains notable "slip-ups," of which the "most glaring was the language. Despite the plausible explanation that Jamal and Salim picked up English, posing as tour guides at the Taj Mahal, it is highly implausible that they would come out of that experience speaking perfect [[British English]], as Dev Patel does in portraying the grown-up Jamal. It's highly implausible that he would speak to Latika and Salim in English as an adult too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/081128/article.asp?parentID=101268| title=Slumdog Sincerity| work=UCLA Asian Institute| last=Radhakrishnan| first=Smitha| date=28 November 2008| accessdate=13 January 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226152741/http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/081128/article.asp?parentID=101268| archivedate=26 December 2008| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Vrinda Nabar, the former chair of English at the [[University of Mumbai]], argued that the film ignores the "complexity" of [[Mumbai]] as "a city in which sensitivity coexists with despair, commitment with indifference, activism with inaction, and humanism with the inhumane."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1220495| title=Slumdog Millionaire bizarrely plausible?| work=[[Daily News and Analysis]]| last=Nabar| first=Vrinda| date=10 January 2009| accessdate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shyamal Sengupta, a professor of film studies at the [[Whistling Woods International Institute for Films, Media, Animationa and Media Arts]] in [[Mumbai]], criticized the film for its [[Stereotypes of South Asians|stereotypical portrayals of Indians]] by calling it a "white man's imagined India. It's not quite snake charmers, but it's close. It's a poverty tour."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-fg-india-slumdog24-2009jan24,0,1162547.story Indians don't feel good about 'Slumdog Millionaire'] ''LA Times'', 24 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Matias Echanove and Rahul Srivastava noted critically in [[The New York Times]] that the film misrepresents and stereotypes the Dharavi slum in Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/21/opinion/21srivastava.html Taking the Slum Out of 'Slumdog'] ''The New York Times'', 21 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Mitu Sengupta, in the Department of Politics &amp; Public Administration at [[Ryerson University]] in [[Toronto]], criticized the way in which Mumbai's poor were depicted, stating:
{{quote|"In the end, ''Slumdog'' presents a profoundly dehumanizing view of the poor, with all its troubling political implications.

Must other unfortunates, like the stoic Jamal, patiently await their own destinies of rescue by a foreign hand? While this self-billed 'feel good movie of the year' may help us 'feel good' that we are among the lucky ones on earth, it delivers a patronizing, colonial and ultimately sham statement on social justice for those who are not." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/sengupta02202009.html Slumdog Millionaire's Dehumanizing View of India's Poor] by Mitu Sengupta, ''Weekend Edition'', February 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Discrimination sidebar|state=collapsed}}

'''Regional discrimination in China''' or '''regionalism''' is overt prejudice against people based on their places of origin, [[list of ethnic groups in China|ethnicity]], [[Han Chinese subgroups|sub-ethnicity]], [[languages of China|language]], [[varieties of Chinese|dialect]], or their current [[provinces of China|provincial]] zones. China's sheer size and population renders much demographic understanding tied to locality, and there is often little life movement outside of a citizen's province of birth. Historically, internal migration has been tightly controlled, and many barriers to free movement exist today. Treatment of ethnic minorities and [[Han Chinese]] regional groups can hinge on preferential assumptions based on places of upbringing, and is often most pronounced towards those born external to urban zones.

When Chinese migrant settle in a new region, local residents can develop social attitudes and prejudgments based on the newcomer's place of birth. If a large volume of new residents relocate from a particular area, regionalism can manifest as sub-ethnic bias and provoke social tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/cul/2005-04-27/19506020.html|title=今日话题：中国的地域歧视为何连绵不绝难消除_新闻中心_文化_新浪网|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the CCP defines regionalism as adverse action or negative attitudes against another based on their home province. The Chinese state acknowledges this as a detrimental yet pervasive prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theory.people.com.cn/GB/40764/77068/77069/5272362.html|title=和谐社会不能容忍地域歧视--理论--人民网|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional discrimination there can also be discrimination against person or a group of people who speak a particular language dialect.

The ''[[hukou]]'' household registry is a system that has been criticized as an entrenchment of social strata, especially as between rural and urban residency status, and is regarded by some as a form of caste system.

==History==
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
Regionalism has long been part of society in China. Generally, [[southern China]] is thought to be more regionalist than [[northern China]]. The [[Hakka people]], despite being considered Han Chinese. This is thought to have led to various conflict such as the [[Taiping Rebellion]] and [[Hakka-Punti Wars]].

== In Mainland China ==
===In university admittance===
{{see also|National Higher Education Entrance Examination}}
A university usually sets a fixed admission quota for each province, with a higher number of students coming from its home province. As the number and the quality of universities vary greatly across China, it is argued that students face discrimination during the admission process based on their region. For example, compared to [[Beijing]], [[Henan]] Province has fewer universities per capita. Therefore, an applicant in Henan needs a significantly-higher score than a Beijing counterpart to attend the same university. That is similar to regional universities in other countries that receive subsidies from regional governments in addition to or in place of the national government's funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://society.people.com.cn/GB/1063/8994226.html|title=高考录取分数线存地域差别 是否存在地域歧视？|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, varied admission standards have led some families to relocate for the sole purpose of advancing their children's chances of entering university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsgd.com/culture/universities/200508040017.htm|title=Migrating college candidates could be left out in cold - Studying in GD - Culture &amp; Education - Newsgd|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In recruitment===
In China's early days, the application of [[civil servant]] was offered mainly to the local [[Hukou system|Hukou]] (household registration). The residence registration normally appears on personal identification documents and has led many employers and local governments to discriminate based on the permanent residence of applicants. For example, the Beijing government had a hiring policy that restricted non-residents of the city to work in only 12 out of 204 types of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=jean_francois_seguin|title=DEALING WITH DISCRIMINATION IN MAINLAND CHINA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In urban and rural areas===
After the [[Communist Party]] took power of [[Mainland China]], the Chinese government began using the family register system to control the movement of people between urban and rural areas. Individuals were broadly categorised as "rural" or "urban" workers. Urban dwellers enjoyed a range of social, economic and cultural benefits, and China's 800 million rural residents were treated as second-class citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4424944.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Asia-Pacific - China rethinks peasant 'apartheid'|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The millions of people who have left village life remain stuck at the margins of urban society and have been blamed for issues of rising crime and unemployment. Under pressure from their cities' citizens, regional governments continue to impose discriminatory rules. For example, the children of "Nong Min Gong" (rural workers) are not allowed to enter city schools. They must live with their grandparents or uncles to go to their local hometown schools. They are called home-staying children by Chinese governments. In 2005, Chinese researchers reported that there are about 130 million home-staying children living away from their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFD2005-QLTS200502000.htm|title=从1000万到1.3亿:农村留守儿童到底有多少|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against specific areas===
As a result of unbalanced economic development, unfair discrimination usually follows the specific regional stereotyping held by a society.

====Henan====
Many rural farmers and migrant workers from Henan suffer abusive consequences from the privileged state system and media portrayal. The reasons for discrimination include having the largest farmer population in China, the huge number of rural workers migrating to cities, and the continuous emigration of refugees and victims from natural calamities and political tragedies in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/archive/2006-02/27/content_1159463.htm|title=Henan People Fight Discrimination … Against Them -- china.org.cn|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beijing===
Because Beijing residents enjoy the privileges powered by central authorities, anti-discrimination advocates consider them as vested beneficiaries. Therefore, they suffer from hostilities and disdain by people from other regions in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gb.cri.cn/3821/2005/09/15/116@702091.htm|title="不得歧视外地人"还应写在哪里？|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more flaunt and politically connected Beijingers also look down on and discriminate against migrants.

===Shanghai===
As migrants, most from southeastern or central China, flow increasingly into [[Shanghai]], they are often blamed for the rising crime and unemployment. They are often attracted by the Shanghai [[hukou system|hukou]] for its convenience and social benefits. Consequently, sometimes Shanghai residents are also despised and discriminated against by people from rural regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sohu.com/s2007/07shhjpfz/|title=上海户口审批评分制，歧视外来人！-搜狐新闻|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinanews.com.cn/cul/news/2009/05-18/1696467.shtml|title=学者:《潜伏》涉嫌丑化上海人 中国该立法反歧视——中新网|author=chinanews|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guangdong===
People from the provinces and autonomous zones outside [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]], who are predominantly Mandarin-speaking and have no knowledge of indigenous languages such as [[Cantonese]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], or [[Hakka]], are called "北佬" or "北姑" (literally, "Northern guys" or "Northern sluts"). In particular, in the early 1980s, Guangdong saw a massive influx of out-of-province workers who did not have the habit of taking showers on a regular basis{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}, who were especially socially distanced. Also, they were seen as not really [[Cantonese people]] or ''[[punti]]'', as many of them considered it unnecessary to learn Cantonese and so did not bother. Differences on issues related to Hong Kong and Guangdong has also triggered ethnic tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abroad.163.com/05/1121/17/233MVV8T00271IHV.html|title=加國華裔之差異：廣東人香港人大陸人|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also discrimination against the native dialects/languages of Guangdong with one example of a school in Guangzhou introducing a Cantonese textbook into classes only to be accused of "promoting separatism" by some northerners. The project was shut down by local authorities because of the controversy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://Vincehkblog.wordpress.com/2018/05/13/is-cantonese-dying-in-canton-2/|title=vicehkblog-is Cantonese dying in Canton?|accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The suppression of the Cantonese language as well as the mass migration of non-Cantonese speaking people in to the area, (only about half of Guangzhou's population are Cantonese natives, in recent times) have caused some Cantonese enthusiasts to accuse the local authorities of wanting to commit "cultural genocide" of the Cantonese language.

Besides that, there is also discriminatory laws that require southern provinces in general to have to pay fines at higher rates(in relation to local income levels) for going against China's family planning policies, than their northern counterparts &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allgirlsallowed.org/sites/default/files/One-Child%20Policy%20Fines%20Relative%20to%20Income%20Levels%20in%20China%20-%20A%20Report%20by%20All%20Girls%20Allowed.pdf|title=One child policy fines in relation to income levels in China|accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Hong Kong and Macau ==

In both [[special administrative regions of China]], ([[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]) some people discriminate against the [[Mainland Chinese]] by calling call them "dai luk lou,", as they are from the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abroad.163.com/05/1121/17/233MVV8T00271IHV.html|title=加国华裔之差异：广东人香港人大陆人_网易出国频道|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some mainlanders discriminate back and call Hong Kongers "British dogs"

[[Riddle]]s (Old Norse, Icelandic and Faroese ''gáta'', pl. ''gátur''; Bokmål and Nynorsk ''gåte'', pl. ''gåter''; Danish ''gåde'', pl. ''gåder''; Swedish ''gåta'', pl. ''gåtor'') are widely attested in post-medieval [[Scandinavian languages]], though the traditional, oral riddle fell out of widespread use during the later twentieth century, being replaced by other oral-literary forms, and by other tests of wit such as quizzes.&lt;ref&gt;Annikki Kaivola-Bregenhøj, ''[http://oa.finlit.fi/site/books/detail/12/riddles/ Riddles: Perspectives on the Use, Function, and Change in a Folklore Genre]'', Studia Fennica, Folkloristica, 10 (Helsinki: Finnish Literature Society, 2001), p. 163 {{doi|10.21435/sff.10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval period==
Few riddles are attested from medieval Scandinavia (by contrast with the numerous [[Anglo-Saxon riddles]] in the quite closely connected literature of medieval England), although [[Norse mythology]] does attest to a number of other wisdom-contests, usually involving the [[god]] [[Óðinn]]. Almost all the surviving medieval Scandinavian riddles occur in one section of the Icelandic ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'', in which the god [[Óðinn]] propounds around 37 riddles (depending on the manuscript),&lt;ref&gt;Alaric Hall, "Changing Style and Changing Meaning: Icelandic Historiography and the Medieval Redactions of Heiðreks saga", ''Scandinavian Studies'', 77 (2005), 1–30, at pp. 9–10. {{JSTOR|40920553}}&lt;/ref&gt; though a riddle also appears in ''[[Þjalar-Jóns saga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;‘''Þjalar-Jóns saga''’, trans. by Philip Lavender, ''Leeds Studies in English'', n.s. 46 (2015), 73–113 (p. 79).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See further Laurits Bødker, Brynjilf Alver, Bengt Holbek, Leea Virtanen, ''The Nordic Riddle: Terminology and Bibliography'' (Copenhagen: Rosenkilde and Bagger, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Old English riddles, the riddles in ''Hervarar saga'' have a fairly tight stanzaic form, often with formulaic phrases like "hvat er þat undra, er ek úti sá | fyrir Dellings durum?" ("what wonder is that, which I saw outside, before the doors of Dellingr?"). The riddles in ''Heiðreks saga'' provide insights into [[Norse mythology]], medieval Scandinavian social norms, and rarely attested poetic forms.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows, Hannah, "Wit and Wisdom: The Worldview of the Old Norse-Icelandic Riddles and their Relationship to Eddic Poetry", in ''Eddic, Skaldic, and Beyond: Poetic Variety in Medieval Iceland and Norway'', ed. by Martin Chase (New York: Forham University Press, 2014), 114–35; Hannah Burrows, "Enigma Variations: ''Hervarar saga''{{'}}s Wave-Riddles and Supernatural Women in Old Norse Poetic Tradition", ''JEGP: Journal of English and Germanic Philology'', 112 (2013), 194–216, {{doi|10.5406/jenglgermphil.112.2.0194}}, {{JSTOR|10.5406/jenglgermphil.112.2.0194}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They were also the subject of a seventeenth-century commentary by [[Björn Jónsson á Skarðsá]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Lavender, "''Oedipus industrius ænigmatum islandicorum'': Björn Jónsson á Skarðsá's Riddle Commentary", ''Gripla'', 26 (2015), 229–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

One, about a sow with an unborn litter, is paralleled as the Anglo-Saxon poet [[Aldhelm|Aldhelm's]] enigma 'De scrofa pregnante'.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/The%20Saga%20Of%20King%20Heidrek%20The%20Wise.pdf The Saga of King Heidrek the Wise]'', trans. by Christopher Tolkien (London: Nelson, 1960), pp. xix, 43 [verse no. 70], 90.&lt;/ref&gt; But only two seem to reflect the stock of folk-riddles known from more widely in Europe. One is an example of the famous [[cow-riddle]]:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Antti Aarne, ''Vergleichende Rätselforschungen'', 3 vols, Folklore Fellows Communications, 26–28 (Helsinki/Hamina: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 1918–20), II 60–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cow has four udders, four legs, two horns, two back legs, and one tail.

The other is the so-called "Óðinn riddle", which is a variant of the international [[Rider-and-horse riddle]]:&lt;ref&gt;Archer Taylor, '[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1495557 The Riddle]', ''California Folklore Quarterly'', 2.2 (April 1943), 129-47 (p. 142).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Antti Aarne, ''Vergleichende Rätselforschungen'', 3 vols, Folklore Fellows Communications, 26–28 (Helsinki/Hamina: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 1918–20), II 173–216.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becoming more widely known in the early modern period through printed editions of the saga, this riddle entered oral tradition. A modern Swedish children's variant of the same runs "vad har tre ögon, tio ben och en svans?" ("what has three eyes, ten legs and a tail?").&lt;ref&gt;Annikki Kaivola-Bregenhøj, ''Riddles: Perspectives on the Use, Function, and Change in a Folklore Genre'', Studia Fennica, Folkloristica, 10 (Helsinki: Finnish Literature Society, 2001), pp. 13–14; {{doi|10.21435/sff.10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the whole riddle-contest in ''Heiðreks saga'' seems to have become the basis for a Faroese ballad, ''Gátu ríma'' ('riddle ballad'), first attested from nineteenth-century oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Nora, ''[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33471/33471-h/33471-h.htm Stories and Ballads of the Far Past]'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1921), pp. 212-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern period==
With the advent of print in the West, collections of riddles and similar kinds of questions began to be published. A large number of riddle collections were printed in the German-speaking world and, partly under German influence, in Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;Frauke Rademann-Veith, ''Die skandinavischen Rätselbücher auf der Grundlage der deutschen Rätselbuch-Traditionen (1540–1805)'' (Frankfurt am Main: Lang, 2010) (PhD thesis, Münster University, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Scandinavian riddles have also been extensively collected from oral tradition. Key collections and studies include:

The '''[[Romani people|Romani]]''' are an ethnic group that has lived in [[Austria]] since the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.dickinson.edu/glossen/heft7/romasinti.html |title=Performance in Gypsy Autobiographies from Austria and Germany |publisher= [[Dickinson College]] |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2001 census, there were 6,273 Romani in Austria or less than 0.1% of the population. Unofficial estimations count between 10,000 and 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,MRGI,,AUT,,49749d5dc,0.html |title= World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples - Austria : Roma/Gypsies |publisher= [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most indigenous Romani people in Austria belong to the Burgenland-[[Romani people|Roma]] Group, in East-Austria. The Majority live in the State of [[Burgenland]], in the City of [[Oberwart]] and in villages next to the District of Oberwart. The Burgenland-Roma speak the [[Vlax Romani language]].

In [[Upper Austria]] there are also some [[Sinti]] families. 80% of the [[Sinti]] speak the [[Sinte Romani]] dialect of the [[Romani language]].

Since 1960, there are also a significant Roma population which hails originally from former [[yugoslavia]]n countries, especially from [[Serbia]] ([[Gurbeti]] and [[Kalderash]] Roma-Groups) and [[Ashkali]] from [[Kosovo]].

==History==
===Origin===
The Romani people originate from the [[North India|Northern]] [[India]],{{sfn|Hancock|2002 |p= [https://books.google.com/?id=MG0ahVw-kdwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR20  xx] | ps =: ‘While a nine century removal from India has diluted Indian biological connection to the extent that for some Romanian groups, it may be hardly representative today, Sarren (1976:72) concluded that we still remain together, genetically, Asian rather than European’}}&lt;ref name="IsabelMendizabal"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982212012602 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.10.039|first=Isabel|last=Mendizabal|title=Reconstructing the Population History of European Romani from Genome-wide Data|journal=Current Biology|date=6 December 2012|accessdate=12 December 2012|volume=22|pages=2342–2349|pmid=23219723}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Comas"&gt;{{cite news|author=Sindya N.

The linguistic evidence has indisputably shown that roots of Romani language lie in India: the language has grammatical characteristics of Indian languages and shares with them a big part of the basic lexicon, for example, body parts or daily routines.&lt;ref name="mluvnice"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Šebková | first1 = Hana | last2 = Žlnayová | first2 = Edita | year = 1998 | url = http://rss.archives.ceu.hu/archive/00001112/01/118.pdf | title = Nástin mluvnice slovenské romštiny (pro pedagogické účely) | place = Ústí nad Labem | publisher = Pedagogická fakulta Univerzity J.

More exactly, Romani shares the basic lexicon with [[Hindi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. It shares many phonetic features with [[Marwari (language)|Marwari]], while its grammar is closest to [[Bengali language|Bengali]].&lt;ref name="hub1995"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Milena|last=Hübschmannová|title=Romaňi čhib – romština: Několik základních informací o romském jazyku|journal=Bulletin Muzea romské kultury|issue=4/1995|year= 1995 |publisher= Muzeum romské kultury|place=Brno|quote=Zatímco romská lexika je bližší hindštině, marvárštině, pandžábštině atd., v gramatické sféře nacházíme mnoho shod s východoindickým jazykem, s bengálštinou.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic findings in 2012 suggest the Romani originated in northwestern India and migrated as a group.&lt;ref name="IsabelMendizabal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Comas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.livescience.com/40652-facts-about-roma-romani-gypsies.html|title=5 Intriguing Facts About the Roma|work=Live Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a genetic study in 2012, the ancestors of present scheduled tribes and scheduled caste populations of [[North India|northern]] [[India]], traditionally referred to collectively as the [[Ḍoma]], are the likely ancestral populations of modern European Roma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Rai | first1 = N | last2 = Chaubey | first2 = G | last3 = Tamang | first3 = R | last4 = Pathak | first4 = AK | last5 = Singh | first5 = VK | year = 2012 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048477 | title = The Phylogeography of Y-Chromosome Haplogroup H1a1a-M82 Reveals the Likely Indian Origin of the European Romani Populations | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | number = 11 | page = e48477 | DOI = 10.1371/journal.pone.0048477 | pmid=23209554 | pmc=3509117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, during the International Roma Conference, the [[Minister of External Affairs (India)|Indian Minister of External Affairs]] stated that the people of the Roma community were children of India. The conference ended with a recommendation to the [[Government of India]] to recognize the Roma community spread across 30 countries as a part of the [[Indian diaspora]].&lt;ref name="diaspora"&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Romas be part of Indian diaspora?|publisher=khaleejtimes.com|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/international/india/can-romas-be-part-of-indian-diaspora|date=29 February 2016|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romani history in Austria===
[[File:Eurogipsy.svg|thumb|left|Map of Europe showing Romani demographics]]

In the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] under [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] (1740–1780), a series of decrees tried to force the Romanies to [[sedentism|permanently settle]], removed rights to horse and wagon ownership (1754), renamed them as "New Citizens" and forced Romani boys into military service if they had no trade (1761), forced them to register with the local authorities (1767), and prohibited marriage between Romanies (1773). Her successor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Josef II]] prohibited the wearing of traditional Romani clothing and the use of the Romani language, punishable by flogging.&lt;ref name="samer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://romani.uni-graz.at/rombase/cgi-bin/art.cgi?src=data/hist/modern/maria.en.xml|title=Maria Theresia and Joseph II: Policies of Assimilation in the Age of Enlightened Absolutism.|publisher=Karl-Franzens-Universitaet Graz|work=Rombase|date=December 2001|first=Helmut|last=Samer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rundetaarn''' or '''Rundetårn''' (Round Tower) is a 17th-century tower located in central Copenhagen, Denmark, and one of the many architectural projects of [[Christian IV of Denmark]], built as an astronomical observatory. It is most noted for its [[equestrian staircase]], a 7.5-turn helical corridor leading to the top, and for the expansive views which it affords over Copenhagen.  

The tower is part of the ''Trinitatis Complex'' which also provided the scholars of the time with a university chapel, the [[Trinitatis Church]], and an academic library which were the first facilities of the [[Copenhagen University Library]] which had been founded in 1482. Today, the Round Tower serves as an observation tower for views of Copenhagen, a public astronomical observatory, and a historical monument. The Library Hall above the church is only accessible along the tower's ramp and is a venue for exhibitions and concerts.

==History==
[[File:Hafnia Hodierna Tab XCII Trinitatis Kirke.jpg|thumb|250px|Rundetaarn. Illustration from the architect Laurids de Thurah's ''Hafnia hodierna'' of 1748.]]

===Background===
Astronomy had grown in importance in 17th-century Europe. Countries had begun competing with each other in establishing colonies, creating a need for accurate navigation across the oceans. Many national observatories were therefore established, the first in 1632 at [[Leiden]] in the [[Dutch Republic]]. Only five years later the Round Tower Observatory, first referred to as STELLÆBURGI REGII HAUNIENSIS, would follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rundetaarn.dk/engelsk/observatorium/history.htm|title=Centuries of Astronomy Astronomy in Denmark|publisher=Rundetaarn|accessdate=2009-12-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202090040/http://rundetaarn.dk/engelsk/observatorium/history.htm|archivedate=2009-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planning and preparations===
[[File:Rundetarn Observatory illustrated by Johann Doppelmayr.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Vignette of Rundetaarn Observatory, as depicted [[Johann Doppelmayr]]'s map of the southern celestial hemisphere, ca. 1742.]]
After [[Tycho Brahe]] had fallen out of favour and left Denmark, [[Christian Longomontanus]] had become Christian IV's new astronomer and the first professor of astronomy at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. In 1625 he suggested the king build an astronomical tower as a replacement for Brahe's [[Stjerneborg]] which had been demolished after his death in 1601.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/hans-van-steenwinckel|title=Hans van Steenwinckel|publisher=answers.com|accessdate=2009-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longomontanus' initial proposal was to erect the new observatory on the top of the hill Solbjerget, now known as Valby Bakke. But since there were also plans for the construction of a new students' church and a library for the university, the idea of merging the three buildings into one grand complex emerged.&lt;ref name="Bygningen af Rundetaarn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rundetaarn.dk/printvenlig/bygning.htm|title=Bygningen af Rundetaarn|publisher=Rundetaarn|accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in 1622, Christian IV had bought the land where it was ultimately decided to build the Trinitatis Complex. His original plans for the site are not known but as it was conveniently located next to the [[Regensen|Regensen dormitories]] and the university, it was chosen for his new prestigious project.

Although there is no clear proof, it is generally accepted that [[Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger]] was charged with the commission to design the new edifice though he did not live to see the tower completed. 

[[Image:Hafnia Hodierna Tab XC Rundetaarn.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cross section of the tower and the church from Thurah's Hafnia Hodierna]]
From 24 November 1636, stones were brought to the site for the foundation, first from the city's ramparts and later from the area around [[Roskilde]]. Bricks were ordered from the Netherlands since local manufacturers could not meet the high quality standards requested. In February 1637, a contract was signed with a Henrik van Dingklage in [[Emden]] for the supply of bricks for the construction. The first three ship loads were to be delivered in May, the next three loads the following month and the remainder on demand.

The Trinitatis Complex was set for construction in a crowded neighbourhood of narrow streets and alleyways. The area first had to be cleared. On 18 April 1637, 200 men, soldiers and personnel from [[Gammelholm#Bremerholm|Bremerholm]] began to demolish the [[timber framing|half-timbered houses]] occupying the site.&lt;ref name="Trinitatis Kirke og Rundetaarn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kloakviden.dk/peter_privat/Historie/trinitatis_kirke_og_rundetaarn.htm|title=Trinitatis Kirke og Rundetaarn|publisher=kloakviden.dk|accessdate=2009-12-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109034646/http://www.kloakviden.dk/peter_privat/Historie/trinitatis_kirke_og_rundetaarn.htm|archivedate=2011-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction phase===
The foundation stone was laid on 7 July 1637. When Hans van Steenwinckel died on 6 August 1639, [[Leonhard Blasius]] was brought to Denmark from the Netherlands as new Royal Building Master. Unlike his predecessor, he would become a mere transitional figure in Danish architecture, dying just four years after his arrival in the country without leaving any notable buildings of his own design. On several occasions construction work came to a standstill due to shortage of funds. Churches in Denmark and Norway were therefore ordered to contribute a share of their earnings during the construction years.&lt;ref name="Bygningen af Rundetaarn"/&gt; In 1642, the tower was finally completed, though the church was completed only in 1657 and the library in 1657.

===Time as an observatory===
Christian Longomontanus became the first director of the observatory. In the [[Copenhagen Fire of 1728|Great Fire of 1728]] the Trinitatis Complex was severely damaged but was rebuilt.

===Demise and later years===
[[File:Anton Rosen - relocation of Rundetårn.jpg|thumb|Rendering made by [[Anton Rosen]] in connection with his proposal to move the tower to a position next to the church]] 
During the early 19th century, the Round Tower became outdated as an astronomical observatory. Instruments were growing still larger while the tower could not be expanded and, at the same time, [[light pollution]] from the surrounding city and vibrations caused by the ever increasing traffic in the streets below had made the observations inaccurate.&lt;ref name="Østervold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kb.dk/udstillinger/astroweb/observatorier/oestervold.html|title=Østervold|publisher=Danmarks Natur- og Lægevidenskabelige Bibliotek |accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The University therefore decided to build [[Østervold Observatory]] on the old [[Fortifications of Copenhagen (17th century)#Ramparts|bastioned fortifications]] of the city, which had become outdated and were being decommissioned. The new observatory was inaugurated in 1861 to the design of [[Christian Hansen (architect)|Christian Hansen]].

===Notable ascents===
* In 1716, The Czar [[Peter the Great]] ascended the staircase on horseback while visiting Copenhagen. His wife, [[Catherine I]], reportedly ascended behind him in a carriage.
* In 1902, a [[Beaufort (automobiles)|Beaufort]] car was the first motorised vehicle to ascend this Round Tower.
* A medal in the Round Tower's collection of medals indicates that the first bicycle race held in the tower took place as early as 1888, possibly in connection with [[The Nordic Exhibition of 1888|The Nordic exhibition of Industry, Agriculture, and Art]].
* In 1911, the newspaper ''Socialdemokraten'' arranged a bicycle race ''down'' the Round Tower.
* In 1971, [[Ole Ritter]] won a bicycle race against [[Leif Mortensen]] up the Round Tower in a time of 55.3 seconds.
* In 1993, [[Henrik Djernis]] won a bicycle race against [[Jens Veggerby]] in a time of 50.05 seconds.
* In 1989, Thomas Olsen went up and down the Round Tower on a [[unicycle]] in 1 minute and 48.7 seconds, which is a world record.&lt;ref name="Sære måder at bestige tårnet på"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rundetaarn.dk/dansk/bagsiden/koersel.html|title=Sære måder at bestige tårnet på|publisher=Rundetaarn|accessdate=2009-08-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523004428/http://www.rundetaarn.dk/dansk/bagsiden/koersel.html|archivedate=2009-05-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[Image:Købmagergade - Rundetårn.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Rundetaarn seen from Krystalgade]]
The Round Tower is a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] tower built in masonry of alternating yellow and red bricks, the colours of the [[House of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]]s. The bricks used were manufactured in the Netherlands and are of a hard-burned, slender type known as ''muffer'' or ''mopper''.&lt;ref name="Trinitatis Kirke og Rundetaarn"/&gt; On the rear side, it is attached to the Trinitatis Church, but it has never served as a [[Steeple (architecture)|church tower]].

Steenwinckel &amp;mdash; whose name is otherwise synonymous with Dutch Renaissance architecture in Denmark &amp;mdash; with the Trinitatis Complex has left his signature style. Unlike his other buildings with their lavish ornamentations and extravagant spires, the complex is built to a focused and restrained design. Hans van Steenwinckel must have been up on the situation in Holland, cogniziant that the style which he had once learned from [[Hendrick de Keyser]] had been altogether abandoned.&lt;ref name="Trinitatis Kirke og Rundetaarn"/&gt;

The architects now setting the agenda in the Netherlands, masters such as [[Jacob van Kampen]] (Amsterdam City Hall), [[Pieter Post]] ([[Mauritshuis]] in the Hague) and [[Philip Vingboons]], now favoured a style characterized by sobriety and restraint. It is now known as [[Dutch Baroque architecture|Dutch Baroque]] or sometimes Dutch Classicism. Its proponents often relied on the  theoretical works such as those of [[Palladio]] and of [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]]. Steenwinckel may have paid a visit to his native Netherlands prior to his change in style but it will have been too early for him to have seen any of the period's buildings realized.&lt;ref name="Trinitatis Kirke og Rundetaarn"/&gt;

===Spiral ramp===

[[File:Rundetårn - helix ramp.jpg|thumb|Inside view of the spiral ramp]]

Instead of stairs, a 7.5-turn spiral [[Inclined plane#Ramps, chutes and slides|ramp]] forms the only access way to the towertop observatory as well as the Library Hall and the [[Bell-ringer|Bell-Ringer]]'s Loft, both located above the church. The ramp turns 7.5 times around the hollow masonry core of the tower before reaching the observation deck and observatory at the top, on the way also affording access to the Library Hall as well as the Ringer's Loft. This design was chosen to allow a horse and carriage to reach the library, moving books in and out of the library as well as transporting heavy and sensitive instruments to the observatory.

The winding corridor has a length of 210&amp;nbsp;m, climbing 3.74&amp;nbsp;m per turn. Along the outer wall the corridor has a length of 257.5&amp;nbsp;m and a [[Grade (slope)|grade]] of 10%, while along the wall of the inner core the corridor is only 85.5&amp;nbsp;m long but has a grade of 33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rundetaarn.dk/dansk/facts_om_rundetaarn.htm|title=Mål og vægt|publisher=Rundetaarn|accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observation deck===
The observation deck is located 34.8&amp;nbsp;m above street level. Along the edge of the platform runs a [[wrought-iron]] [[Latticework|lattice]] made in 1643 by Kaspar Fincke, Court Artist in metalwork. In the latticework, Christian IV's [[monogram]] and the letters RFP are seen, the letters representing the King's motto: ''Regna Firmat Pietas'' – Piety strengthens the Realms.

===Observatory===
[[Image:Rebus rundetaarn.jpg |thumb|160px|Inside view of the rebus inscription on the façade]]
The observatory is a small [[dome]]d building, built on the roof of the tower. Built in 1929, the current observatory is 7&amp;nbsp;m high and has a diameter of 6&amp;nbsp;m. Access is by a narrow winding stone staircase from the observation deck.

===Rebus inscription===
On the upper part of the façade of the tower, there is a gilded [[rebus]] inscription. Christian IV's draft of it, written in his own hand writing, is kept at the [[Danish National Archives]]. The rebus includes the four Hebrew consonants of the [[Tetragrammaton]]. The rebus can be interpreted in the following way: ''Lead God, the right teaching and justice into the heart of the crowned King Christian IV, 1642''.&lt;ref name="The Tower"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rundetaarn.dk/engelsk/frames.htm|title=The Tower|publisher=Rundetaarn|accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toilet==
The tower contains a toilet used by the researchers and astronomers working in the tower and consisting of a seat almost at the top and a shaft leading down to the bottom floor built into the hollow core. This shaft has no way of emptying it nor any ventilation to the outside, making it arguably one of the world's largest and earliest septic tanks.

==The Round Tower today==
Today the Round Tower serves as an observation tower, a public astronomical observatory, an exhibition and concert venue and a historical monument.

===Public observatory===
In 1860 the University of Copenhagen decommissioned the Round Tower as a university observatory but in 1928 it was reconstructed as an observatory with access for amateur astronomers and the general public. It is open from mid-October to mid-March.

[[Image:Rundetårn - Biblioteksloftet.jpg |thumb|200px|The Library Hall ]]
===Exhibitions and concerts===
Since 1987, the Library Hall which lies above The Trinitatis Church, has served as an exhibition space, featuring various exhibitions of art, culture, history and science. At the same time, it is used as a concert venue, every year hosting around a hundred concerts.&lt;ref name="The Tower"/&gt;

===Views===
The observation deck affords extensive views over the rooftops of the old part of Copenhagen with its many spires, including [[the Marble Church]], [[Kunsthallen_Nikolaj|the Nikolaj contemporary art center]], [[Christiansborg Palace]], {{ill|Christiansborg Slotskirke|da}}, [[Church_of_the_Holy_Ghost,_Copenhagen|the Church of the Holy Ghost]], [[Copenhagen City Hall]], [[Palace Hotel (Copenhagen)|Palace Hotel]], [[Church_of_Our_Lady_(Copenhagen)|the Church of Our Lady]], [[St. Peter's Church, Copenhagen|St. Peter's Church]], [[Great Synagogue (Copenhagen)|the Great Synagogue]], [[St. Andrew's Church, Copenhagen|St. Andrew's Church]], [[Rosenborg Castle]], [[Church_of_Our_Saviour,_Copenhagen|the Church of Our Saviour]] and the pipes of {{ill|Amagerværket|da}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Views from the Round Tower, November 2016|url=https://independent-travellers.com/denmark/copenhagen/rundetaarn/|website=Independent Travellers|publisher=independent-travellers.com|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On clear days, both the [[Øresund Bridge]] and Sweden can be seen in the distance.

===Rundetaarn Unicycle Race===
Every year in spring, a unicycle race is held in the Round Tower. The contestants have to go up and down the tower. The world record, set in 1988, is 1 minute and 48.7 seconds.&lt;ref name="Sære måder at bestige tårnet på"/&gt;

The silver economy is analyzed in the field of [[social gerontology]] not as existing [[economic system]] but as an instrument of [[ageing policy]] and the political idea of forming a potential, needs-oriented economic system for [[Population ageing|aging population]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/silver-economy-study-how-stimulate-economy-hundreds-millions-euros-year "Silver Economy Study: How to stimulate the economy by hundreds of millions of Euros per year"], European Commission 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Gasiorowski-Denis, [https://www.iso.org/news/Ref2168.htm "The silver economy"], ISO&lt;/ref&gt; Its main element is [[gerontechnology]] as a new scientific, research and implementation paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;Klimczuk, Andrzej, ''Economic Foundations for Creative Ageing Policy, Volume I: Context and Considerations'', Palgrave Macmillan, New York 2015, pp. 75-107; Klimczuk, Andrzej, [https://depot.ceon.pl/handle/123456789/6137?locale-attribute=en "Supporting the Development of Gerontechnology as Part of Silver Economy Building"], ''Ad Alta: Journal of Interdisciplinary Research'' 2/2012, pp. 52-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The phrase "silver economy" is sometimes used interchangeably with the term "silver market" (the “ageing marketplace” or the “mature market”), which is a narrower concept. The wording "silver market" was created in the 1970s in Japan in the context of increasing of the availability of facilities for seniors. Silver market includes, among others, good, values and services for affluent older people; special solutions in trade between operators, allowing adjustments to aging workforce; ideas of [[universal design]] and [[transgenerational design]] that aim is to adapt goods and services to people of different ages ("age-friendly"), physical condition and cognitive abilities, which may result in improved [[social integration]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulmas, Florian, ''Looking at the Bright Side of Things'', in ''The Silver Market Phenomenon: Business Opportunities in an Era of Demographic Change'', ed. Florian Kohlbacher and Cornelius Herstatt, Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg 2008, v–vi.  &lt;/ref&gt;

The silver economy is not a single sector, but rather a collection of products and services from many existing [[Economic sector|economic sectors]], including [[information technology]], [[Telecommunication|telecommunications]], [[financial sector]], [[housing]], [[transport]], [[energy]], [[tourism]], [[culture]], [[infrastructure]] and [[Local service delivery|local services]], and [[long-term care]].&lt;ref&gt;Klimczuk, Andrzej, [http://www.ep.liu.se/ej/ijal/2016/v10/i2/15-286/ijal15-286.pdf "Comparative Analysis of National and Regional Models of the Silver Economy in the European Union"], ''International Journal of Ageing and Later Life'' 2/2016, s. 31-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Child''' ('''SPARC''') is a [[Pakistan]]i independent [[non-governmental organization]] dedicated to protecting the rights of children.

== Mission ==

SPARC was established as an advocacy group for children’s rights.&lt;ref name=SPARC /&gt; Initially focused on promoting and protecting [[breastfeeding]], it has expanded to [[child labour]], [[juvenile justice]], education and violence against children.&lt;ref name=SPARC /&gt; It has held "children's parliaments"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/islamabad/15-Nov-2008/Children-Parliament-elected-to-promote-child-rights |title=Children Parliament elected to promote child rights |date=November 15, 2008 |newspaper=[[The Nation (Pakistani newspaper)|The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SPARC organises children parliament session |url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/lahore/07-Nov-2010/SPARC-organises-children-parliament-session |date=November 7, 2010|newspaper=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to end [[corporal punishment]] in Pakistani schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SPARC for end to corporal punishment in schools|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/karachi/22-Jun-2009/SPARC-for-end-to-corporal-punishment-in-schools |date=June 22, 2009|newspaper=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SPARC calls for end to corporal punishment in schools |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2640941931.html |date=February 24, 2011|newspaper=[[Financial Post (Karachi)|Financial Post]]}} (at Highbeam, subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soschildrensvillages.ca/news/news/child-charity-news/pages/corporal-punishment-students-pakistan-must-end-894.aspx|title=NGO: Corporal Punishment of Students in Pakistan Must End |date=June 26, 2012 |publisher=[[SOS Children's Villages – Canada]] |accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==

SPARC was officially established on December 17, 1992, in [[Islamabad]], Pakistan.&lt;ref name="SPARC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sparcpk.org/About_Us.html | title=SPARC | publisher=SPARC | accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPARC's governing body is run by a board of directors.&lt;ref name=SPARC /&gt; While the headquarters is located in Islamabad, it has offices in [[Lahore]], [[Karachi]], [[Peshawar]] and [[Quetta]], [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]], [[Multan]] and [[Nowshera District|Nowshera]].&lt;ref name=SPARC /&gt; 54 Child Rights Committees consisting of local activists operate at the district level.&lt;ref name=SPARC /&gt;

SPARC has consultative status with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] and the [[United Nations Department of Public Information]].&lt;ref name=SPARC /&gt; It is a partner of [[Defence for Children International]].&lt;ref name=SPARC /&gt; In 2003, SPARC received the United Nations Recognition Award for highlighting the plight of children and promoting the rights of children in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=SPARC /&gt; In 2006, SPARC received [[USAID]] certification.&lt;ref name=SPARC /&gt;

SPARC is a member of the Pakistan National Alliance&lt;ref name="paper1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/32225/breastfeeding-practice-lowest-in-pakistan/ | title=Breastfeeding practice ‘lowest in Pakistan’ | newspaper=[[The Express Tribune]] |date=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Baby Food Action Network]].&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.crin.org/docs/resources/treaties/crc.37/IBFAN_Part_2.4.pdf | title=IV – PAKISTAN (2003-2004) | publisher=SPARC | accessdate=December 10, 2012 | last=Wager |first=T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Southern''', '''Kolyma''' or '''Forest Yukaghir''' language is one of only two extant [[Yukaghir languages]].

Last spoken in the forest zone near the sources of the Kolyma, divided between the [[Sakha Republic]] and the [[Magadan Oblast]] (around {{coord|65|N|153|E|}}), previously in the wider area of the upper [[Kolyma]] region.

== Status ==
Kolyma Yukaghir is a moribund language, with only 50 remaining speakers with the language as their mother tongue. No speakers are monolingual, since all speak Russian and most speak Yakut. The first language for all Yukaghir under 60 is Russian, although many still have Kolyma Yukaghir as a mother tongue, and the average age for fluent, first-language speakers is 63 or more. Previously, multilinguism was common in the region, and Kolyma Yukaghir, Yakut, Even, and Chukchi all served as languages of intercultural communication, depending on the ethnicity of the addressee. Yukaghirs 60 and older follow this custom. Middle-age Yukaghir, from 41-60, still have Yukaghir as their mother tongue and speak to elders in it, although they use Russian for all other communication. The youngest generation of Yukaghir is almost entirely monolingual in Russian, the only language used at school. Although Kolyma Yukaghir has been taught at school since 1985, the youngest generation still know little to none of the language.&lt;ref name="maslova" /&gt;

==Classification and grammatical features==
The relationship of the Yukaghir languages with other language families is uncertain, though it has been suggested that they are distantly related to the [[Uralic languages]], thus forming the putative [[Uralic–Yukaghir languages|Uralic–Yukaghir]] language family.&lt;ref&gt;Collinder, Björn (1940) Jukagirisch und Uralisch. Uppsala: Almqvist &amp; Wiksell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kolyma and Tundra Yukaghir are the only two remnants of what used to be one of the dominant language families of northeastern Siberia, spreading from the [[Anadyr River|River Anadyr]] in the east to the [[Lena River|River Lena]] in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Dolgikh, Boris O. (1960) Rodovoj i plemennoj sostav narodov Sibiri v XVII v. Moskva: Izdatel'stvo Akademii Nauk SSSR&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of the evidence of early sources, it can be assumed that there existed a Yukaghir dialect continuum, with what is today Kolyma Yukaghir and Tundra Yukaghir at the extremes.&lt;ref&gt;Nikoleava, Irina (2008) Chuvan and Omok languages? In: A. Lubotsky et al. (Eds.) Evidence and Counter-Evidence. Festschrift Frederik Kortland. Amsterdam: Rodopi, pp. 313-336.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kolyma Yukaghir and Tundra Yukaghir are not mutually intelligible. Kolyma Yukaghir has residual [[vowel harmony]] and a complex phonotactics of consonants, rich [[agglutinative]] morphology and is strictly [[Head directionality parameter|head-final]]. It has practically no finite subordination and very few coordinate structures. Kolyma Yukaghir has a [[Active–stative language|split intransitive]] alignment system based on discourse-pragmatic features. In absence of [[Focus (linguistics)|narrow focus]], the system is organised on a [[Nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] basis; when focused, direct objects and subjects of intransitive verbs are co-aligned (special focus case, special focus agreement).

Kolyma Yukaghir has a glottal stop, but only as a marginal phoneme in some interjections (ex. ''maʔ'': "take!").&lt;ref name="maslova" /&gt;

/b, x, ɣ, ç, ʝ/ occur as allophones of /w, q, ʁ, tɕ, dʑ/.

When a labial approximant /w/ occurs at the end of a word, it is pronounced as a /u/.

When a velar nasal /ŋ/ occurs before a voiced uvular fricative /ʁ/, it becomes a voiced uvular stop /ɢ/.

The phonemes /s, z/ occur in Russian loanwords.

'''Stop Porn Culture''' is an international [[Feminism|feminist]] [[Opposition to pornography|anti-porn]] organization with branches in the [[United States]], [[Norway]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. It works as an advisory body, trains trainers, and builds public health educational materials based on empirical research. It has a network of volunteers and activists and collaborates with other organizations in the U.S. and Europe. Some of its work is grassroots activist work.&lt;ref name=SPCabout&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stoppornculture.org/about/about-stop-porn-culture-international/ |title=About Stop Porn Culture International |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2014 |website=stoppornculture.org |publisher=Stop Porn Culture |accessdate=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==About==

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, concurrent with the rapid growth of the [[Internet]] and the increased accessibility to [[pornography]] that it provided, [[Feminism|feminists]] in the U.S. began to organize to discuss the proliferation of pornography and of "violence associated with its production and consumption". Some of the discussion participants decided to rebuild a national movement, similar to one of the previous 20 years, to address the harms of the pornography industry. Several feminists developed a contemporary version of the [[slide show]]s developed in the 1970s to be used as an educational tool and to inspire action against the [[Wiktionary:pornification|pornification]] (or [[sexualization]]) of culture. Stop Porn Culture was created from these efforts.&lt;ref name=SPChistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stoppornculture.org/about/history-of-spc/ |title=History of SPC |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2014 |website=stoppornculture.org |publisher=Stop Porn Culture |accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stop Porn Culture mission statement reads:
:''Stop Porn Culture is dedicated to challenging the pornography industry and an increasingly pornographic pop culture. Our work toward ending industries of sexual exploitation is grounded in a feminist analysis of sexist, racist, and economic oppression. We affirm sexuality that is rooted in equality and free of exploitation, coercion, and violence.''&lt;ref name=SPCmission&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stoppornculture.org/about/spc-mission-statement/ |title=SPC Mission Statement |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2014 |website=stoppornculture.org |publisher=Stop Porn Culture |accessdate=August 1, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140806220517/http://stoppornculture.org/about/spc-mission-statement/ |archivedate=August 6, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==

[[Gail Dines]], founding member of Stop Porn Culture, wrote ''Pornland.'' In 2014 a documentary, with the same name, was released and promoted on the Stop Porn Culture website, and is described as "an ideal introduction to the core arguments of the feminist anti-pornography movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stoppornculture.org/2014/09/24/pornland-how-the-porn-industry-has-hijacked-our-sexuality-a-documentary-trailer/ |title=Pornland: How the Porn Industry Has Hijacked Our Sexuality – a Documentary |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2014 |website=stoppornculture.org |publisher=Stop Porn Culture |accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stop Porn Culture works to create awareness on what it calls the current "porn culture." Much of this work is done online through online lecture videos and social media work as well as through workshops and conferences for Feminist Slideshow Training. It is an unpaid organization and recruits through a volunteer and internship program focused on marketing, digital writing, video editing, and social media projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stoppornculture.org/about/about-us/spc-internships/ |title=SPC Internships |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2014 |website=stoppornculture.com |publisher=Stop Porn Culture |accessdate=November 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141106012806/http://stoppornculture.org/about/about-us/spc-internships/ |archivedate=November 6, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Stop Porn Culture started a petition against the journal, ''[[Porn Studies]]'', a first-of-its-kind, peer-reviewed publication focused on porn studies. Stop Porn Culture's co founder Gail Dines claimed that the journal has a pro-porn bias, a claim that the journal denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/jun/16/internet-violent-porn-crime-studies |title=Porn wars: the debate that's dividing academia |author=Carole Cadwalladr |year=2013 |website=theguardian.com |publisher= Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Yunnan, it is spoken in all of [[Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture]], as well as [[Jiangcheng Hani and Yi Autonomous County]] in [[Pu'er City]].

In Vietnam, Tai Lue speakers are officially recognised as the [[Lu people|Lự]] ethnic minority, although in China they are classified as part of the [[Dai people]], along with speakers of the other [[Tai languages]] apart from [[Zhuang languages|Zhuang]].

== Phonology ==
Tai Lue has 21 syllable-initial consonants, 9 syllable finals and six tones (three different tones in checked syllables, six in syllables).

== Grammar ==

Word order is usually [[subject–verb–object]]; modifiers (e.g. adjectives) follow nouns.

==Vocabulary==
As in Thai and Lao, Tai Lue has borrowed many [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] words and [[affixes]]. Among the Tai languages in general, Tai Lue has limited intelligibility with [[Shan language|Shan]] and [[Tai Nüa language|Tai Nua]] and shares much vocabulary with, the other [[Southwestern Tai languages]]. Tai Lue has 95% [[lexical similarity]] with [[Northern Thai language|Northern Thai]] (Lanna), 86% with Central Thai, 93% with Shan, and 95% with [[Khün language|Khun]].&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;

Below, Thai words are shown on the left and Tai Lue language words, written in Thai script, are shown on the right.

===Different words===
Many words differ from Thai greatly:
*ยี่สิบ → ซ่าว ({{IPA|/jîː sìp/ → /sâːw/}}, twenty)
*พูด → อู๋ ({{IPA|/pʰûːt/ → /ʔu᷅ː/}}, to speak)
*พี่ชาย → อ๋าย ({{IPA|/pʰîː tɕʰaːj/ → /ʔa᷅ːj/}}, older brother)

===Similar words===
Some words differ in tone only:
*หนึ่ง → นึง ({{IPA|/nɯŋ/}}, one)
*หก → ฮก ({{IPA|/hók/}}, six)
*เจ็ด → เจ๊ด ({{IPA|/tɕét/}}, seven)
*สิบ → ซิบ ({{IPA|/síp/}}, ten)
*กิน  → กิ๊น ({{IPA|/kín/}}, to eat)

Some words differ in a single sound and associated tone. In many words, the initial ร ({{IPA|/r/}}) in Thai is ฮ ({{IPA|/h/}}) in Tai Lue, as is also the case in Lao and Tai Yuan:
*ร้อน → ห่อน  ({{IPA|/rɔ́n/ → /hɔ̀n/}}, hot)
*รัก → หัก ({{IPA|/rák/ → /hak/}}, to love)
*รู้ → หู่ ({{IPA|/rúː/ → /hùː/}}, to know)

[[Aspirated consonant]]s in the low-class consonant group(อักษรต่ำ {{IPA|/ʔàk sɔ̌n tàm/}}) become unaspirated:
*เชียงราย → เจ้งฮ่าย ({{IPA|/tɕʰiaŋ raːj/ → /tɕêŋ hâːj/}}, [[Chiang Rai|Chiang Rai city]] and [[Chiang Rai Province|province]])
*คิด → กึด ({{IPA|/kʰít/ → /kɯt/}}, to think)
*พ่อ → ปอ ({{IPA|/pʰɔ̂/ → /pɔ/}}, father)
*ทาง → ต้าง ({{IPA|/tʰaːŋ/ → /tâːŋ/}}, way)

(Note that the vowels also differ greatly between Tai Lue and Thai in many words, even though they are etymologically related and share the same root.)

Though many aspirated consonants often become unaspirated, when an unaspirated consonant is followed by ร ({{IPA|/r/}}) the unaspirated consonant becomes aspirated:
*ประเทศ → ผะเตด ({{IPA|/praʔtʰêːt/ → /pʰaʔtêːt/}}, country)

Other differences:
*ให้ → หือ ({{IPA|/hâj/ → /hɯ᷅/}}, to give, let)

|}

== Writing systems ==

Tai Lue is written in three different alphabets. One is [[อักษรไทยฝักขาม|Fak Kham]] script, a variety of Thai script of [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]]. The second is Tham script and was reformed in the 1950s, but is still in use and has recently regained government support. The new alphabet is a simplified version of the old script.

=== Fak Kham ===
An ancient script, also used in [[Kengtung]], [[Northern Thailand]] and Northern Laos centuries ago.

=== Tham ===
Tham script is called [[:zh:老傣文|老傣文]] ''lao dai wen'' (Old Tai script) in China. Readable by the most people and used in  Burma, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam.

=== New Tai Lue ===
[[File:China Post logo with (New) Tai Lü script in Mohan, Yunnan.jpg|thumb|China Post logo with New Tai Lue script in Mohan, Yunnan]]

[[New Tai Lue script|New Tai Lue]] is a modernisation of the Lanna alphabet (also known as [[Tai Tham script]]), similar to the [[Thai alphabet]], and consists of 42 initial consonant signs (21 high-tone class, 21 low-tone class), seven final consonant signs, 16 vowel signs, two tone letters and one vowel shortening letter (or syllable-final glottal stop). Vowels signs can be placed before or after the syllable initial consonant.

Similar to the Thai alphabet, the pronunciation of the tone of a syllable depends on the class the initial consonant belongs to, syllable structure and [[vowel length]], and the tone mark.

Unicode range ("New Tai Lue"): U+1980 – U+19DF

'''Thai Canadians''' are [[Canadians|Canadian citizen]]s of [[Thai people|Thai]] ancestry.

==Migration history==
Migration from Thailand to Canada has gradually increased since the 1950s, when a few Thai students first came to study at Canadian universities. Migration has since continued at a slow pace, with a brief increase after the 1997 financial crisis in Thailand, which resulted in more Thais looking for work and educational opportunities overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thais|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/thais/|publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thai immigrants who choose to remain in Canada have generally immigrated to study, to take up a business, or to marry a Canadian. Many of them claim that they did not originally intend to stay in Canada. According to the 1991 census, there were 5,820 immigrants born in [[Thailand]]; 2,900 whose first language spoken at home was the [[Thai language]]; and 2,770 who claimed that they were of Thai ethnic origin.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/t2/2 Migration, Arrival, and Settlement - Thai] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120710191819/http://multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/t2/2 |date=2012-07-10 }}", ''Multicultural Canada''&lt;/ref&gt;  The larger figure for immigrants is explained by the fact that a certain number are likely [[Thai Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] and perhaps [[Lao people|Lao]] from Thailand. Thai couples and small groups have settled primarily in [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], and [[Montreal]].

There are substantially more Thai women than men in the country (1,775 women and 480 men). While most are professionals, students, or have married Canadian men, there are occasional instances of young women entering the country as artists and entertainers, or as visitors who become afterward legit Canadians by marrying or contributing to the culture in one way or another. Some are bilingual and, like many immigrants, speak the language more clearly than some natives.

Some Thais in Canada work in the restaurant industry and Thai cuisine, known for its balance between sweet, sour, salty and spicy flavours, and for its use of fresh herbs, coconut milk and galangal root. This cuisine has become popular in Canada, particularly in urban areas. One notable example of a Thai in this industry is internationally acclaimed chef Sasi Meechai-Lim, who resides in Toronto, where she has opened several restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chefdb.com/nm/17940/Sasi-Meechai-Lim|title=Sasi   Meechai-Lim : The Chef and Restaurant Database (ChefDb)|website=www.chefdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/thais/|title=Thai Canadians|first=Amanda|last=Joy|website=thecanadianencyclopedia.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legoutdelathailande.com/|title=アヤナスで敏感肌・乾燥肌対策【30代後半の働く女性向けの化粧品】|website=www.legoutdelathailande.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chuchai.com/|title=ChuChai|website=www.chuchai.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==
Thai immigrants to Canada are primarily well-educated professionals working as bankers, dentists, doctors, nurses, computer technicians and engineers. Many of them closed businesses such as [[Thai food|Thai restaurant]]s or [[Muay Thai]] gyms, which have become popular in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thais|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/thais/|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, they have been economically successful in Canada and have contributed to the Canadian economy.

In recent years, some Thais have come to Canada as live-in caregivers. Despite having positive bilateral relations, the Canadian Government discontinued its Work Experience Program (now known as the International Experience Canada program) to Thais.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Experience Canada|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/experience/intro_incoming-intro_entrant.aspx?lang=eng|publisher=Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work and study permits, as well as temporary resident visas, are seldom issued to Thai nationals from the Canadian embassy based in Thailand. A very small number of Thai nationals have become permanent residents and settled in Canada.

==Organizations==
The Thai Community Association of British Columbia, formed in 1986, is officially registered as a community organization. It sponsors a variety of events, offers Thai language classes when there is a need, and produces newsletters in Thai at irregular intervals. The Friends of Thailand, formed in 1988, is open to interested non-Thai Canadians, although its members also include many Thai with Canadian spouses. Its goal is to help Canadians understand and appreciate [[Culture of Thailand|Thai culture]].

In Toronto, about ten families formed the Thai Association of Canada in 1983, but they soon reduced their mandate to Ontario. The group organizes social events, such as summer picnics and New Year’s parties, and arranges for Thai language classes.

Thai Buddhist Association, which has been meeting informally for many years, has been dedicated to maintaining the Thai Buddhist tradition in Canada. In 1992, a Christian church in East Vancouver was converted to be Vancouver's first Thai temple, founded by the senior monk Luang Pho Viriyang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thai Buddhist Temple - Wat Yanviriya|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/thai-buddhist-temple-wat-yanviriya/|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993, a building on the outskirts of Toronto was purchased and dedicated to become the second Thai Buddhist Yanviriya temple. In 2013, there were six Thai Buddhist temples, two Buddhist monasteries, and two meditation societies across Canada. These have become important for Thai-Canadians for religious and cultural practices, building community, and maintaining cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buddhist Temples and Monasteries|url=http://www.thaiembassy.ca/en/thai-community-canada/buddhist-temples-monasteries|publisher=Thai Embassy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Globalized City: Economic Restructing and Social Polarization in European Cities''''' is a collection of discussions and [[case studies]] of large-scale [[urban development]] projects in nine European cities. It analyzes the relation between these projects and trends such as [[social exclusion]], the emergence of new urban elites, and the consolidation of less [[democracy|democratic]] forms of urban governance.

==Summary==
The book offers in-depth analyses of linkages between urban restructuring and social exclusion against the backdrop of trends in urban governance across the [[European Union]], examining [[neo-liberal]] and [[New Urban]] policies that increasingly favour private investment and deregulation of [[labour market]]s. The aim is to clarify the relationship between new urban spaces and the emergence of new forms of [[polity]], [[economy]], and urban life which may not necessarily promote social harmony within the [[metropolitan area]]s.

==Case studies==
The nine case studies in the book identify a number of large-scale urban development projects and look into the respective variation of governance systems at different scales. They also indicate how these local projects reflect global trends, institutional forms and strategic practices. The nine [[Megaproject|mega-projects]] include: 
* The [[Europeanization]] of [[Brussels]]
* The [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|Guggenheim museum]] in [[Bilbao]]
* The financial district in [[Dublin]]
* The science-university-technology complex '[[Adlershof]]' in [[Berlin]]
* The [[Expo '98|1998 World Expo]] in [[Lisbon]]
* The [[Olympic Games]] bid by [[Athens]]
* The Donau City in [[Vienna]]
* The Oresund project in [[Copenhagen]], and
* The new business district in [[Naples]].

These case studies are thoughtful examinations of the argument that mega-projects and events are vital for urban development.

The '''Tupi people''' were one of the most numerous [[indigenous peoples in Brazil|peoples indigenous to Brazil]], before colonisation. Scholars believe that while they first settled in the [[Amazon rainforest]], from about 2,900 years ago the Tupi started to migrate southward and gradually occupied the Atlantic coast of [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalsorocabano.com.br/index.php/s-soc/47-c-cor/1717-saida-dos-tupi-guaranis-da-amazonia-pode-ter-ocorrido-ha-2900-anos|title=Saída dos tupi-guaranis da Amazônia pode ter ocorrido há 2.900 anos|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007173330/http://www.portalsorocabano.com.br/index.php/s-soc/47-c-cor/1717-saida-dos-tupi-guaranis-da-amazonia-pode-ter-ocorrido-ha-2900-anos|archivedate=2011-10-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Tupi languages.png|thumb|Tupi (violet), Tupi-Guarini (pink) languages areas and early probable areas (pink-grey).]]
The Tupi people inhabited almost all of Brazil's coast when the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] first arrived there. In 1500, their population was estimated at 1 million people, nearly equal to the population of Portugal at the time. They were divided into  [[tribe]]s, each tribe numbering from 300 to 2,000 people. Some examples of these tribes are: ''[[Tupiniquim people|Tupiniquim]]'', ''[[Tupinambá people|Tupinambá]]'', ''[[Potiguara]]'', ''[[Tabajara]]'', ''[[Caeté people|Caetés]]'', ''Temiminó'', ''Tamoios''. The Tupi were adept [[agriculture|agriculturalists]]; they grew [[cassava]], [[maize|corn]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[bean]]s, [[peanut]]s, [[tobacco]], [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[cotton]] and many others. There was not a unified Tupi identity {{citation needed|reason=How would the Portuguese explorers have known this?|date=July 2015}} despite the fact that they spoke a common language. 

===European colonization===
From the 16th century onward, the Tupi, like other natives from the region, were [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]], [[Slavery in Brazil|enslaved]], or killed by diseases such as [[smallpox]]&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0122njp|title=Unnatural Histories - Amazon|publisher=''BBC Four''}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by Portuguese settlers and [[Bandeirantes]] ([[colonial Brazil]] [[Reconnaissance|scouts]]), nearly leading to their complete annihilation, with the exception of a few isolated communities. The remnants of these tribes are today confined to [[Indian reservation]]s or acculturated to some degree into the dominant society.&lt;ref name="Darcy Ribeiro. O Povo Brasileiro"/&gt;

===Cannibalism===
The Tupi were divided into several tribes which would constantly engage in war with each other. In these wars the Tupi would normally try to capture their enemies to later kill them in [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] rituals.&lt;ref name="Darcy Ribeiro. O Povo Brasileiro"&gt;Darcy Ribeiro – O Povo Brasileiro, Vol. 07, 1997 (1997), pp. 28 to 33; 72 to 75 and 95 to 101."&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[warrior]]s captured from other Tupi tribes were eaten as it was believed by the Indians that such act would lead to their strength being absorbed and digested, thus in fear of absorbing weakness, they chose only to sacrifice warriors perceived to be strong and brave. For the Tupi warriors, even when prisoners, it was a great honor to die valiantly during battle or to display courage during the festivities leading to his sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revistadehistoria.com.br/secao/retrato/um-alemao-na-terra-dos-canibais|title=Um alemão na Terra dos Canibais - Revista de História|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tupi have also been documented to eat the remains of dead relatives as a form of honoring them.&lt;ref&gt;Agnolin, Adone. ''O apetite da antropologia''. São Paulo, Associação Editorial Humanitas, 2005. p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The practice of cannibalism among the Tupi was made famous in Europe by [[Hans Staden]], a German soldier, mariner, and mercenary, traveling to Brazil to steal riches, who was captured by the Tupi in 1552. In his account published in 1557, he tells that the Tupi carried him to their village where it was claimed he was to be devoured at the next festivity. There, he allegedly won the friendship of a powerful chief, whom he cured of a disease, and his life was spared. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} &lt;ref&gt;Staden, Hans. Duas viagens ao Brasil: primeiros registros sobre o Brasil. Porto Alegre: L&amp;PM, 2011, p. 51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannibalistic rituals among Tupi and other tribes in Brazil decreased steadily after European contact and religious intervention. When [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca|Cabeza de Vaca]], a Spanish [[conquistador]], arrived in [[Santa Catarina Island|Santa Catarina]] in 1541, for instance, he attempted to ban cannibalistic practices in the name of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|the King of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faperj.br/interna.phtml?obj_id=875|title=Museu de Arte e Origens|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because our understanding of Tupi cannibalism relies solely on primary source accounts of primarily European writers, the very existence of cannibalism has been disputed by some in academic circles. [[William Arens]] seeks to discredit Staden's and other writers' accounts of cannibalism in his book ''The Man-Eating Myth: Anthropology &amp; Anthropophagy'', where he claims that when concerning the Tupinambá, "rather than dealing with an instance of serial documentation of cannibalism, we are more likely confronting only one source of dubious testimony which has been incorporated almost verbatim into the written reports of others claiming to be eyewitnesses".&lt;ref&gt;(New York : Oxford University Press, 1979; {{ISBN|0-19-502793-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race-mixing and ''Cunhadismo''===
[[File:Claude d'Abbeville, Histoire de la mission, Louis Henri.png|thumb|left|A Tupinambá named "Louis Henri", who visited [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] in Paris in 1613, in [[Claude d'Abbeville]], ''Histoire de la mission''.]]
Many indigenous peoples were important for the formation of the Brazilian people, but the main group was the Tupi. When the Portuguese explorers arrived in Brazil in the 16th century, the Tupi were the first Amerindian group to have contact with them. Soon, a process of [[miscegenation]] between Portuguese settlers and indigenous women started. The Portuguese colonists rarely brought women, making the Indian women the "breeding matrix of the Brazilian people".&lt;ref name="Darcy Ribeiro. O Povo Brasileiro"/&gt; When the first Europeans arrived, the phenomenon of "''cunhadismo''" (from Portuguese ''cunhado'', "brother in law") began to spread by the colony. ''Cunhadismo'' was an old Indian tradition of incorporating strangers to their community. The Indians offered the Portuguese an Indian girl as wife. Once he agreed, he formed a bond of kinship with all the Indians of the tribe. [[Polygyny]], a common practice among South American Indians, was quickly adopted by European settlers. This way, a single European man could have dozens of Indian wives (''temericós'').&lt;ref name="Darcy Ribeiro. O Povo Brasileiro"/&gt; 

[[Image:Albert Eckhout Mameluca woman circa 1641-1644.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Albert Eckhout]]: a mixed-race ([[Mameluco]]) woman (circa 1641–1644)]]

''Cunhadismo'' was used as recruitment of labour. The Portuguese could have many ''temericós'' and thus a huge number of Indian relatives who were induced to work for him, especially to cut [[pau-brasil]] and take it to the ships on the coast. In the process, a large mixed-race ([[mameluco]]) population was formed, which in fact occupied Brazil. Without the practice of ''cunhadismo'', the Portuguese colonization was impractical. The number of Portuguese men in Brazil was very small and Portuguese women were even fewer in number. The proliferation of mixed-race people in the wombs of Indian women provided for the occupation of the territory and the consolidation of the Portuguese presence in the region.&lt;ref name="Darcy Ribeiro. O Povo Brasileiro"/&gt;

===Influence in Brazil===
Although the Tupi population largely disappeared because of European [[disease]]s to which they had no resistance or because of slavery, a large population of maternal Tupi ancestry occupied much of Brazilian territory, taking the ancient traditions to several points of the country. [[Darcy Ribeiro]] wrote that the features of the first Brazilians were much more Tupi than Portuguese, and even the language that they spoke was a Tupi-based language, named [[Nheengatu language|Nheengatu]] or [[Língua Geral]], a [[lingua franca]] in Brazil until the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Darcy Ribeiro. O Povo Brasileiro"/&gt; The region of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] was the biggest in the proliferation of Mamelucos, who in the 17th century under the name of [[Bandeirantes]], spread throughout the Brazilian territory, from the [[Amazon rainforest]] to the extreme [[Southern Brazil|South]]. They were responsible for the major expansion of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]n culture in the interior of Brazil. They acculturated the Indian tribes who lived in isolation, and took the language of the colonizer, which was not Portuguese yet, but Nheengatu itself, to the most inhospitable corners of the colony. Nheengatu is still spoken in certain regions of the Amazon, although the Tupi-speaking Indians did not live there. The Nheengatu language, as in other regions of the country, was introduced there by Bandeirantes from São Paulo in the 17th century. The way of life of the ''Old'' ''[[Paulistas]]'' could almost be confused with the Indians. Within the family, only Nheengatu was spoken. Agriculture, hunting, fishing and gathering of fruits were also based on Indian traditions. What differentiated the Tupi from the ''Old Paulistas'' was the use of clothes, salt, metal tools, weapons and other European items.&lt;ref name="Darcy Ribeiro. O Povo Brasileiro"/&gt;
[[Image:Cacique tupinikin 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Tupiniquim]] chief (''Cacique'') in [[Brasília]], 2007]]
When these areas of large Tupi influence started to be integrated into the [[market economy]], Brazilian society gradually started to lose its Tupi characteristics. The Portuguese language became dominant and Língua Geral virtually disappeared. The rustic Indian techniques of production were replaced by European ones, in order to elevate the capacity of [[exportation]].&lt;ref name="Darcy Ribeiro. O Povo Brasileiro"/&gt; [[Brazilian Portuguese]] absorbed many words from Tupi. Some examples of Portuguese words that came from Tupi are: ''mingau, mirim, soco, cutucar, tiquinho, perereca, tatu''. The names of several local fauna &amp;ndash; such as ''arara'' ("[[macaw]]"), ''jacaré'' ("South American [[alligator]]"), ''tucano'' ("[[toucan]]") &amp;ndash; and flora &amp;ndash; e.g. ''mandioca'' ("[[manioc]]") and ''abacaxi'' ("[[pineapple]]") &amp;ndash; are also derived from the Tupi language. A number of places and cities in modern Brazil are named in Tupi (''[[Itaquaquecetuba]],'' ''[[Pindamonhangaba]],'' ''[[Caruaru]]'', ''[[Ipanema]]''). Anthroponyms include ''Ubirajara'', ''Ubiratã'', ''Moema'', ''Jussara'', ''Jurema'', ''Janaína''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.melhornome.com.br/nomes.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427060200/http://www.melhornome.com.br/nomes.htm |archivedate=2009-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tupi surnames do exist, but they do not imply any real Tupi ancestry; rather they were adopted as a manner to display Brazilian nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sérgio Cabral|title=Antônio Carlos Jobim: uma biografia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PV9aAAAAMAAJ|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Lumiar Editora|isbn=978-85-85426-42-2|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tupinambá'' tribe is fictitiously portrayed in [[Nelson Pereira dos Santos]]' satirical 1971 film ''[[How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman]]'' (''Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês''). Its name is also adapted by science (as ''Tupinambis'') for the [[tegu]]s, arguably the best-known lizards of Brazil.

The large offshore [[Tupi oil field]] discovered off the coast of Brazil in 2006 was named in honor of the Tupi people.

The [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] are a different native group which inhabits southern Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and northern Argentina and speaks the distinct [[Guaraní languages]], but these are in the same [[language family]] as Tupi.

'''Uzbek''' is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] that is the first official and only declared national language of [[Uzbekistan]]. The language of [[Uzbeks]], it is spoken by some 32 million native speakers in [[Uzbekistan]] and elsewhere in [[Central Asia]].

Uzbek belongs to the Eastern Turkic, or [[Karluk languages|Karluk]], branch of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language family]]. External influences include [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. One of the most noticeable distinctions of Uzbek from other Turkic languages is the rounding of the vowel {{IPA|/ɑ/}} to {{IPA|/ɒ/}}, a feature that was influenced by Persian.

== Name ==
In the language itself, Uzbek is ''{{lang|uz|oʻzbek tili}}'' or ''{{lang|uz|oʻzbekcha}}''.  In [[Arabic script]], {{lang|uz-Arab|اوزبیک تیلی}} and {{lang|uz-Arab|اوزبیکچه}}.

== History ==
Turkic speakers probably settled the [[Amu Darya]], [[Syr Darya]] and [[Zarafshan]] river basins since at least 600–700 CE, gradually ousting or assimilating the speakers of [[Eastern Iranian languages]] who previously inhabited [[Sogdia]], [[Bactria]] and [[Khwarezm]]. The first Turkic dynasty in the region was that of the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] in the 9th–12th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ooo-perevod.ru/news/uzbekskiy.html |title=The Origins of the Uzbek Language |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=5 January 2013|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were a confederation of [[Karluks]], [[Chigils]], [[Yagma|Yaghma]] and other tribes.&lt;ref name="sinor"&gt;{{citation|last = Golden|first = Peter.

Uzbek can be considered the direct descendant or a later form of [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]], the language of great [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] Central Asian literary development in the realm of [[Chagatai Khan]], [[Timur]] (Tamerlane), and the [[Timurid dynasty]]&lt;ref name="allworth"&gt;{{cite book |title=Central Asia: 130 Years of Russian Dominance, a Historical Overview |last=Allworth |first=Edward |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |publisher=Duke University Press |location= |isbn=0-8223-1521-1 |pages=72 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (including the early Mughal rulers of India). The language was championed by [[Ali-Shir Nava'i]] in the 15th and 16th centuries. Nava'i was the greatest representative of Chagatai language literature.&lt;ref name="McHenry"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |  editor = Robert McHenry | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | title = Navā’ī, (Mir) ‘Alī Shīr | language = | edition = 15th | date = | year = 1993 | month = | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc | volume = 8 | location = [[Chicago]] | id = | doi = | page = 563 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Subtelny"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Subtelny| first = M.

By the 19th century it was rarely used for literary composition, but disappeared only in the early 20th century.

The term ''Uzbek'' as applied to language has meant different things at different times. Prior to 1921 "Uzbek" and "[[Sart]]" were considered to be different dialects:
* "Uzbek" was a [[Vowel harmony|vowel-harmonised]] [[Kipchak language|Kipchak]] variety spoken by descendants of those who arrived in [[Transoxiana]] with [[Muhammad Shaybani]] in the 16th century, who lived mainly around [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand]], although the Turkic spoken in [[Tashkent]] was also vowel-harmonised. It can be called old Uzbek and it's considered to be related to that specific group of people.
* "[[Sart]]" was a [[Karluk languages|Karluk]] dialect spoken by the older settled Turkic populations of the region in the [[Fergana Valley]] and the [[Qashqadaryo Region]], and in some parts of what is now the [[Samarqand Region]]; it contained a heavier admixture of Persian and Arabic, and did not have [[vowel harmony]]. It became the standard Uzbek language and the official dialect of Uzbekistan.

In [[Khanate of Khiva]], Sarts spoke a highly [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] Turkified form of [[Karluk languages|Karluk]] Turkic. After 1921 the Soviet regime abolished the term ''Sart'' as derogatory, and decreed that henceforth the entire settled Turkic population of Turkestan would be known as ''[[Uzbeks]]'', even though many had no Uzbek tribal heritage.

However, the standard written language that was chosen for the new republic in 1924, despite the protests of Uzbek [[Bolsheviks]] such as [[Fayzulla Khodzhayev]], was not pre-revolutionary "Uzbek" but the "Sart" language of the Samarkand region. [[Edward A. Allworth]] argued that this "badly distorted the literary history of the region" and was used to give authors such as the 15th century author [[Ali-Shir Nava'i]] an Uzbek identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allworth|first=Edward A.|title=The Modern Uzbeks: From the Fourteenth Century to the Present: A Cultural History|year=1990|publisher=Hoover Institution Press|isbn=978-0-8179-8732-9|pages=229–230|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=beCoAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three dialects continue to exist within modern spoken Uzbek.

== Writing systems ==
[[File:Adib-i sani.jpg|thumb|upright=0.54|A 1911 text in the [[Uyghur Arabic alphabet]]]]
{{Main|Uzbek alphabet}}

Uzbek has been written in a variety of scripts throughout history:
* Pre-1928: the Arabic-based [[Yaña imlâ alphabet]] by literates, approximately 3.7% of Uzbeks at the time.&lt;ref name=Batalden&gt;{{cite book|last=Batalden|first=Stephen K.|title=The Newly Independent States of Eurasia: Handbook of Former Soviet Republics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFjPAxhBEaEC&amp;pg=PA194|year=1997|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-89774-940-4|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** 1880s: Russian missionaries attempted to use Cyrillic for Uzbek.&lt;ref name=Batalden /&gt;
* 1928–1940: the Latin-based [[Yañalif]] used officially.
* 1940–1992: the [[Cyrillic script]] used officially.
*[[File:Students in Tashkent 1943.jpg|thumb|Students in Taskent studying a Cyrillic-Latin conversion chart, 1943.]]Since 1992: a [[Yañalif]]-based Latin script is official in Uzbekistan.

Despite the official status of the Latin script in Uzbekistan, the use of Cyrillic is still widespread, especially in advertisements and signs. In newspapers, scripts may be mixed, with headlines in Latin and articles in Cyrillic.&lt;ref name=Euro&gt;{{cite book|author=European Society for Central Asian Studies.

In the western Chinese region of [[Xinjiang]], where there is an Uzbek minority, the Arabic is still used.

In Afghanistan, the traditional Arabic orthography is still used.

=== Morphology and syntax ===
As a Turkic language, Uzbek is [[null-subject language|null subject]], [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] and has no [[article (grammar)|article]]s and no [[noun class]]es (gender or otherwise). The word order is [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV). Words are usually [[oxytone]]s (i.e. the last syllable is stressed), but certain endings and suffixal particles are not stressed.

In Uzbek, there are two main categories of words:
* nominals (equivalent to nouns, pronouns, adjectives, some adverbs)
* verbals (equivalent to verbs and some adverbs)

;Verbs
Uzbek uses the following verbal suffixes:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Suffix
! Function
! Example
! Translation
|-
| ''-moq''
| [[infinitive]]
| ''kelmoq''
| to come
|-
| ''-di''
| past tense
| ''keldi''
| came
|-
| ''-ing''
| imperative
| ''keling!''
| come!
|-
| ''-sa''
| conditional
| kelsa
| would come
|-
|}

The present and future tenses are both expressed with the ''-a'' and ''-y'' suffixes.

;Articles
Nouns take the ''-ni'' suffix as an indefinite article. Unsuffixed nouns are understood as definite.

;Pronouns
{| class="wikitable"
|- align="center"
! Pronoun
! Translation
|- align="center"
| ''men''
| I
|- align="center"
| ''biz''
| we
|- align="center"
| ''sen''

|- align="center"
| ''siz''
| you&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(formal singular and plural)&lt;/small&gt;
|- align="center"
| ''u''
| he/she/it
|}

===== Word order =====
The word order in the Uzbek language is [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV), which means that, unlike in English, the object comes before the verb and the verb is the last element of the sentence.

== Number of speakers ==
Estimates of the number of speakers of Uzbek vary widely. The Swedish encyclopedia ''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]'' estimates the number of native speakers to be 30 million,&lt;ref name="Nationalencyklopedin"&gt;"Världens 100 största språk 2007" ("The World's 100 Largest Languages in 2007"), [[Nationalencyklopedin]]&lt;/ref&gt;
and the ''[[CIA World Factbook]]'' estimates 25 million. Other sources estimate the number of speakers of Uzbek to be 21 million in Uzbekistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uzbekistan|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uz.html|work=CIA|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3.4 million in Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Languages of Afghanistan|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=AF|work=Ethnologue|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 900,000 in Tajikistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Languages of Tajikistan|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=TJ |work=Ethnologue|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 800,000 in Kyrgyzstan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnic Makeup of the Population|url=http://www.stat.kg/stat.files/din.files/census/5010003.pdf|work=National Statistics Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic|accessdate=7 December 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 500,000 in Kazakhstan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Census 2009|url=http://www.stat.kz/p_perepis/Documents/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%8C%20%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81.pdf|work=Statistics Agency of Kazakhstan|accessdate=7 December 2010|language=Russian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uvOtyVTC?url=http://www.stat.kz/p_perepis/Documents/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%8C%20%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81.pdf|archivedate=12 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 300,000 in Turkmenistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Languages of Turkmenistan|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=TM|work=Ethnologue|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 300,000 in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Census 2010|url=http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/population/demo/per-itog/tab6.xls|work=Federal State Statistics Service|accessdate=7 December 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Loan words ==
The influence of [[Islam]], and by extension, [[Arabic]], is evident in Uzbek [[loanword]]s. There is also a residual influence of [[Russian language|Russian]], from the time when [[Uzbeks]] were under the rule of the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Most importantly, Uzbek vocabulary, phraseology and pronunciation has been heavily influenced by [[Persian language|Persian]] through its historic roots. Words like '''men''' ''I'' and '''kitob''' ''book'' are clearly of Persian origin.

== Dialects ==
The Uzbek language has many [[dialect]]s, varying widely from region to region. However, there is a commonly understood dialect which is used in mass media and in most printed materials. Among the most-widespread dialects are the [[Uzbek (Tashkent dialect)|Tashkent dialect]], [[Uzbek dialect]], the [[Uzbek (Ferghana dialect)|Ferghana dialect]],  the [[Uzbek (Khorezm dialect)|Khorezm dialect]], the Chimkent-Turkestan dialect, and the Surkhandarya dialect.

==The Deva tribe==
The Deva Tribe form the vast majority of the Singhalese population. Being one of the first tribes flourishing on the island of Sri Lanka it is natural that many Kings in Sri Lanka's old history were from the Deva. The Deva are therefore the Royal Tribe which provided Sinhalese Monarchs, Statesmen, Military Leaders (Kshatriya) and Learned Men and Priests (Brahmins) in Ceylon until the Nayakkar Kings of South Indian origin snatched power during the Kandyan era. Sri Lanka's Deva tribes (Naga / Raksha) who were the traditional ruling class of the island later became the Kshatriya and Brahmin castes of the classic Aryan Varnas of North India in the Middle Ages.

All the recorded Sinhalese Monarchs starting from King Pandukhabhaya (474 BC) down to King Mayadunne (1581 AD) and final king of Sri Lanka sri Srisiddhipathi(Gongalegoda banda 1848AD )  were members of the Deva tribes. Kings were given the royal title of Deio (Deviyo / Deyyo) / Devayan Wahansa / Bandara Deyyo (a local version of "His Royal Highness") showing their Deva Royalty. Many Kings who had done good deeds during their reign are elevated to Devahood (Deity status) after their deaths as in e.g. : Mahasen Deyyo ( King Mahasen) / Minneriye Deviyo with Devale (Shrine) dedicated in his name.

Ancient Deva tribes of Ceylon consisted of the order of Nagas (order of the Serpent) . Deva tribes of Ceylon also have their roots in the ancient Royal houses of Europe through Royal blood lineage (Rome, England, France, Germany, Greece, Scandinavia, Spain, Portugal, Romania) even reaching the Khazars of Turkey, king [[Saul]] of Israel, Monarchs of Siam, China, Korea, Japan and even in ancient ruling classes of Persia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kashmir, Nepal, Northern &amp; Western India. Deva Tribe  has been a part of the Global Monarchy from time immemorial keeping links with their ancestors by sending emissaries from Ceylon to Mediterranean Europe  and vice versa during the ancient times.  The name Deva (Godly) implies their status as descendants of God or Divine Beings a title reserved for Emperors and Monarchs.

The Sri Lankan caste system is a division of society into strata, influenced by the classic Aryan Varnas of North India and the Dravida Jāti system found in South India. Ancient Sri Lankan texts such as the Pujavaliya, Sadharmaratnavaliya and Yogaratnakaraya and inscriptional evidence show that the above hierarchy prevailed throughout the feudal period. The repetition of the same caste hierarchy Raja / Deva (Royalty), Bamunu / Giri (Priests, teachers, doctors), Vaishya / Radala (Aristocrats, Herdsmen, Traders), Shudra / Govi (Farmers, laborers, slaves, servants)even as recently as the 18th century, in the British / Kandyan period Kadayimpoth - Boundary books as well, indicates the continuation of the tradition right up to the end of Sri Lanka's monarchy.

Ancient texts such as the Pujavaliya, Sadharmaratnavaliya and Yogaratnakaraya list the four caste categories as Raja Kshatriya, Bamunu Brahmana, Velanda Vaishya and Govi in descending order, where the Govi caste is the 4th caste.
Other ancient texts such as the Gavaratnakaraya and Sarpothpaththiya (Sarpavedakama vi, 5 &amp; 123) respectively classify even Sri Lankan cattle and snakes into the same four caste categories as Raja, Bamunu, Velanda &amp; Govi, where again Govi is the 4th form. Ballads sung to-date at ancient Gammaduva rituals also refer to the above four castes categories in the same sequence and also describes the limits and privileges of each. The domestic utensils of the Raja, category are described as made of gold; silver and copper for the next two and finally earthenware for the Govi caste which is last in the hierarchy (Gammaduwa 13). Govigama caste today is considered as the highest caste in Sri Lanka only because of numerical superiority, in India similar castes such as govigama are considered as "Shudras" the lowest caste in Indian Caste System.

King Nissanka Malla who managed to chase out[citation needed] the Indians who destroyed[citation needed] the Raja, Bamunu, Welanda, and Govi castes by forced intermarriages authored a stone inscription "Gal Potha" in Polonnaruwa which clearly states that people of "Govi" caste should not even think of becoming the King of Ceylon.

Losing their Royal power and influence after the death of the last Sinhalese King, Royal Deva Tribes (Raja) were later maliciously  made into an obscure artificially invented caste named Wahumpura  by the influence of lower castes Goy / Govigama Mudliyars who came to prominence during the colonial period, hence people mixed up the Deva tribes with Wahumpura caste systematically obliterating the actual history of the Deva tribe.

Members of rural Deva tribes are today found predominantly in the [[Sabaragamuwa province|Sabaragamuwa Province]], [[North Western Province, Sri Lanka|North Western province]](Wayambha province), [[Western Province, Sri Lanka|Western province]] and [[North Central Province, Sri Lanka|North Central province]], Raja Rata (Valley of Kings). The traditional occupation of this caste was the Governance of the Island and serve in the Military. In addition their tributary tribes functioned as trusted [[Military reserve force|military reserve]] of the [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] [[Monarch|Kings]].

During the early Colonial era Deva (Raja /Bamunu) tribesmen never converted to Christianity nor changed their surnames nor did they join the newly amalgamated Govigama / Goy caste of agricultural laborers and slaves because the Devas were of highest standing coming from the Raja (Royalty) and Bamunu (Priests) upper castes or Kshatriya and Brahmins and did not see any need to create themselves a new identity or caste status in the then Sinhalese society by joining the low caste Govigama caste.

However, due to the large population of members in the newly formed Govigama caste reduced the Royal Deva tribes to the second influential and significant Sri Lankan [[Caste in Sri Lanka|caste]].

It is noteworthy to point that the amalgamation of the Shudra low castes laborers and slaves into one large Govigama caste was incorporated by the Colonial British Administrators in Ceylon at the request of a one Mudliyar De Seram, a Mudliyar of Malay origin who schemed to create himself a majority following to gain the leadership in Ceylon. De Saram family of Dutch and Malay ancestry had Sinhalised itself in the late 18th century by posing as the representatives of the masses and subsequently convincing the British rulers that they were from the numerous agricultural laborer shudra castes Govigama. This was a strategic move as it gave the British masters the impression that the De Saram family had the backing of a large body of natives. It was also the easiest route to Sinhalisation as the peasant community was widely dispersed, still unstructured and without inter-community networks or leaders.

The newly formed Govigama caste which came to prominence in the colonial period tarnished, ridiculed and obscured the identity of the Royal Deva Tribes, due to envy that the Deva tribe having the exclusive Kshatriya and Brahmin status in the social hierarchy. Thence low caste Govigamas launched a campaign to rename and identify the Deva tribe with an obscure and an invented caste called Wahumpura.

==Origins==
The origin of this community is linked to the ancient Deva people from the unwritten history of the island dating as far back as 270000 B.C.
The Deva Tribesmen are distinct from the other prominent tribe Yakka of Ceylon in skin complexion and features, many of them have a fair or olive color skin complexion and prominent Caucasian features not typical to a people of a hot tropical island. Deva were the early inhabitants of Ceylon, were ancient Eurasians namely Semites, Hellenic / Greeks, Romans and other Caucasians.  They possessed the skills and technology to build large Engineering feats such as huge pagodas, palaces, buildings and reservoirs from their ancient engineering experience in building Pyramids in Egypt.

Tamil Nadu vanniyar called bandaram (sinhala banda) or madaapalli,these people inhabit kanchipuram thondainadu their king were called pallava,lost the empire in A.D 850 to cholas in a war consisting pandiya chera and Sri Lanka (sena 2)  war took place a called thrupirampiyam in Tamil Nadu. Sri Lanka helping pandiya, more than 200,000 people died in 3 days  chola won the war. During the ascention of the Raksha King Ravana, some Deva people migrated to other places like present North Malabar of Kerala where they followed Buddhism before the advent of Brahminism. Having their own complete social fabric and systems of precedence and worship, they dominated the area, until their power was seriously undermined by Brahmin lead power lobby. However, they still survive in Malabar, and are known as "Thiyya", a localisation of the name "Deyva" equivalent to Deva. The ancestor worship of Thiyyas spring from the fact that they consider themselves as descendents of "Deyva" or God. The ceremonial oracle, who represent the spirit of their ancestors of Lanka, in the temple are known as "Theyyam" origiting from the word "Deyvam" meaning God. However, by the time of arrival of Vijaya to Sri Lanka it had noted a significant presence of Deva clan In which latter got mixed with North Indians, Nagas and Yaksa to create the Modern Sinhalese lineage.

==Traditional status==
The traditional occupation of the Deva tribe was Governance, Military Service, Irrigation, Trade, Engineering, Overseeing Agriculture and safeguarding Buddhism.

In times of war, the Sinhalese Deva Kings (God Kings), who did not maintain standing armies relied on volunteers from this community in forming armies to counter invaders. This community has escaped the [[British East India Company|British]] period consolidation of several cultivator communities as one [[Govigama / Goy]] caste and exists as an independent, economically and politically influential caste.

During the colonial period many of this community moved to the coastal provinces to engage in trade and businesses, after losing the traditional vocations of military and governance. Through successful trade, they established themselves as prominent merchants in the southern and western maritime provinces. Several members of this caste emerged as successful entrepreneurs in the British colonial market economy and were recognized as members of the local elite. They were involved in the freedom movement and the early political reforms of Ceylon.

==Current status==
Considered to be the largest of the Sinhalese castes, it has been estimated that this community makes up close to 30% of the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese population]] of the island. According to that Deva is the second largest caste of Sri Lanka due to large number of population in Govigama caste. Predominantly Buddhist, the community has not converted to Christianity as had other castes during the colonial period to preserve their social status in the society at that time which made them reluctant to join ranks with lower castes who became the first converts.

Predominant in the [[Sabaragamuwa province|Sabaragamuwa]], [[North Western Province, Sri Lanka|North Western province]](Whayaba province) and [[Western Province, Sri Lanka|Western provinces]], members of this community have achieved prominence, as professionals, businessmen and politicians. Much of people of this cast remain engaged in cultivation in their traditional areas. Although a large community they still remain under represented in parliament, yet retain an influential say in modern Sri Lankan politics.
