'''Proposition 1''' was a [[referendum]] held on [[United States elections, 2015|November 3, 2015]], on the [[anti-discrimination laws|anti-discrimination ordinance]] known as the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO). The ordinance was intended to improve anti-discrimination coverage based on sexual orientation and gender identity in Houston, specifically in areas such as housing and occupation where no anti-discrimination policy existed. Proposition 1 asked voters whether they approved HERO. Due to concerns about the bill being misused to allow men in women's restrooms, thus spawning the nickname of "The Bathroom Bill," Houston voters rejected Proposal 1 by a vote of 61% to 39%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Cumulative Report - Official - Harris County, Texas - General and Special Elections - November 03, 2015 |date= 2015-11-11 |accessdate= 2017-06-27 |website= Stan Stanart: Harris County Clerk |url= http://www.harrisvotes.com/HISTORY/20151103/cumulative/cumulative_9.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and results==

In 2014, neither U.S. federal law nor Texas statewide law specifically covered [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]] in employment and housing discrimination and services. On May 28, 2014, the [[Houston City Council]] voted 11–6 to enact the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) which was authored by Houston's then-Mayor, [[Annise Parker]].&lt;ref name=LoneStarQ&gt;{{cite web|last= Wright |first= John |title= Opponents of Equal Rights Ordinance sue Mayor Annise Parker, city of Houston |date= 2014-08-06 |website= Lone Star Q |url= http://www.lonestarq.com/opponents-equal-rights-ordinance-sue-mayor-annise-parker-city-houston/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141019055217/http://www.lonestarq.com/opponents-equal-rights-ordinance-sue-mayor-annise-parker-city-houston/ |archivedate= 2014-10-19 |deadurl= yes |quote= a lawsuit filed Tuesday by opponents of the city's Equal Rights Ordinance.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure banned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy, genetic information, family, marital, and military status. The ordinance applied to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions would be exempt. Violators could be fined up to $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Council passes equal rights ordinance |first= Mike |last= Morris |date= May 29, 2014 |accessdate= 2017-06-27 |work= [[Houston Chronicle]] |url= http://www.chron.com/news/politics/houston/article/Council-passes-equal-rights-ordinance-5510672.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to HERO arose because the ordinance protected "transgender residents' ability to use the restroom consistent with their gender expression, regardless of their biological sex."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|last= Morris |first= Mike |title= Equal rights law opponents deliver signatures seeking repeal |date= 2014-07-03 |accessdate= 2017-06-27 |newspaper= [[Houston Chronicle]] |url= http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/houston/article/Equal-rights-law-opponents-deliver-signatures-5599272.php?t=63159f4ad9cf61987c#/0}}&lt;/ref&gt; HERO became known to some as the "Bathroom Law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/houston-hero-transgender-bathroom-law-390747|title=Houston Voters Reject 'Bathroom Law' That Aimed to Protect Civil Rights|date=November 4, 2015|website=Newsweek.com|access-date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the ordinance passed, opponents of HERO drafted a petition and began gathering signatures to add a ballot measure to the November 2014 ballot to repeal the ordinance. City law required 17,296 valid signatures from registered Houston voters for a successful veto referendum petition, which would require the city council to either rescind the targeted ordinance themselves or put it before voters. This requirement was calculated by taking 10 percent of the greatest number of votes cast for mayor in any of the three preceding years. Moreover, signatures had to be submitted before the ordinance was scheduled to take effect or within 30 days of the publication of the approved ordinance, whichever came first. Opponents of HERO presented about 50,000 signatures to the Houston city secretary's office on July 3, 2014.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Although the city secretary found enough valid signatures to make the petition sufficient, the city attorney advised her of certain problems with enough of the petition sheets to invalidate the petition. These problems included signature gatherers who were not registered to vote and petition sheets that were not signed by the signature gatherer responsible for them, as well as other, more technical problems.  The city announced that the opponents were 2,022 signatures short of the 17,269 needed to put the matter to a vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Houston declares non-discrimination ordinance's repeal petition invalid |date= 2014-08-04 |accessdate= 2017-06-27 |website= [[KTRK-TV|KTRK-TV Houston]] |url= http://abc13.com/politics/houston-declares-hero-repeal-petition-invalid/240139/ |quote= For this specific petition, a total of 17,269 signatures were needed.

Attorneys for the pastors called the subpoenas retaliation against Christians for opposing the ordinance. Parker maintained that the attorneys who dealt with the lawsuit for the city were outside lawyers (i.e., not city employees) and that she and City Attorney David Feldman had been unaware of the subpoenas. After what some news organizations called a "firestorm"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Editorial: Houston went too far in sermon subpoenas |date= October 2014 |accessdate= 2017-06-27 |newspaper= [[The Dallas Morning News]] |url= https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/2014/10/21/editorial-houston-went-too-far-in-sermon-subpoenas |quote= Amid a firestorm of criticism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= abajournal&gt;{{cite journal|last= Weiss |first= Debra Cassens |title= Sermon subpoena request was overbroad, Houston mayor acknowledges |date= 2014-10-16 |accessdate= 2017-06-27 |journal= [[ABA Journal]] |publisher= [[American Bar Association]] |url= http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/sermon_subpoena_request_was_overbroad_houston_mayor_acknowledges |quote= After a firestorm erupted over the subpoenas}}&lt;/ref&gt; of criticism over the subpoenas (Parker said that she had been "vilified coast to coast"&lt;ref name= abajournal/&gt;), Parker directed the city's attorneys on October 29, 2014 to withdraw the subpoenas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Gryboski |first= Michael |title= Houston Mayor Annise Parker Drops Subpoenas Demanding Pastors Turn Over Their Sermons |date= 2014-10-29 |accessdate= 2017-06-27 |newspaper= [[The Christian Post]] |url= http://www.christianpost.com/news/mayor-annise-parker-drops-subpoenas-against-houston-pastors-128816/ |quote= I am directing the city legal department to withdraw the subpoenas issued to the five Houston pastors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the subpoenas were withdrawn, local city pastors filed a civil rights lawsuit against Parker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abc13.com/news/pastors-sue-mayor-over-sermons-subpoenaed/900044/|publisher=ABC 13|date=August 3, 2015|access-date=April 29, 2016|title=Pastors sue Houston Mayor Parker over sermons subpoenaed}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit went to trial on January 19, 2015. Feldman announced on December 19, 2014, his plans to resign from his position as Houston City Attorney shortly before the trial began. He said that the primary reason for his resignation was a desire to return to private practice. He also noted, however, that his decision to resign was related to the lawsuit as well, saying, "Being on the outside, I'm going to be a lot freer to tell the story and to explain it to people and to debunk the myth." As reported by the Houston Chronicle, Feldman noted, too, that if he testified in the trial as the city attorney, it would prohibit other attorneys from the city's legal department from serving as counsel for the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/houston-subpoenas-pastors-sermons-in-gay-rights-ordinance-case/2014/10/15/9b848ff0-549d-11e4-b86d-184ac281388d_story.html|title=Houston subpoenas pastors' sermons in gay rights ordinance case|first=Sarah Pulliam Bailey | last=Service|date=October 15, 2014|publisher=|access-date=January 12, 2018|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/City-Attorney-David-Feldman-to-resign-5969411.php#/0|title=City attorney cites equal rights ordinance in decision to resign|website=HoustonChronicle.com|access-date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 13, 2015, a jury issued a verdict saying that while the petitions did not contain instances of fraud, they did contain forgeries and instances of failure to follow proper procedure. District Judge Robert Schaffer then initiated a recounting process to determine whether or not opponents of HERO had gathered enough valid signatures to satisfy the threshold of 17,296. Following the verdict in February, both sides claimed victory. A definitive answer, however, did not emerge until Judge Schaffer's ruling on April 17, 2015, when he determined that the opponents of the ordinance had not gathered enough valid signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/houston/article/After-mixed-verdict-city-confident-judge-in-ERO-6080715.php|title=After mixed verdict, city confident judge in ERO suit will rule in its favor|website=HoustonChronicle.com|access-date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc13.com/politics/judge-rules-in-favor-of-city-on-houstons-equal-rights-ordinance/666933/|title=Judge rules in favor of city on Houston's Equal Rights Ordinance|date=April 17, 2015|website=ABC13.com|access-date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, opponents of the ordinance asked the Texas Supreme Court for a [[writ of mandamus]] against the city of Houston. On July 24, 2015, the court granted this petition and ruled that the Houston City Council should have honored the city secretary's initial signature count and must either repeal the ordinance or include it on the November 2015 ballot, writing in a per curiam opinion, "We agree ... that the city secretary certified their petition and thereby invoked the city council's ministerial duty to reconsider and repeal the ordinance or submit it to popular vote. The legislative power reserved to the people of Houston is not being honored."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2015/07/24/houston-equal-rights-ordinance-suspended.html Houston Equal Rights Ordinance suspended]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original ballot language crafted by the City of Houston was also challenged in court. After the Texas Supreme Court threw out the original wording, the city revised the ballot language.&lt;ref name="houstonchronicle.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/City-Council-signs-off-on-HERO-ballot-language-6467709.php|title=Language to appear on HERO ballot approved|website=HoustonChronicle.com|access-date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following question was placed on the 2015 general election ballot in Houston as Proposition 1:

{{quote

No. 2014-530, which prohibits discrimination in city employment and city services, city contracts, public accommodations, private employment, and housing based on an individual's sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, familial status, marital status, military status, religion, disability, sexual orientation, genetic information, gender identity, or pregnancy?&lt;ref name="houstonchronicle.com"/&gt;
}}

On November 3, 2015, Houston voters voted by a 61%–39% margin to reject Proposition 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Cumulative Report — Official Harris County, Texas — General and Special Elections — November 03, 2015 |work= Harris County Elections Office |date= November 11, 2015 |url= http://www.harrisvotes.com/HISTORY/20151103/cumulative/cumulative_9.jpg }}&lt;/ref&gt; This vote overturned the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO).

The appeal of Judge Schaffer's ruling is currently{{Clarify timeframe|date=January 2018}} on hold in the [[Texas Court of Appeals|Fourteenth Court of Appeals]], with further litigation still possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.search.txcourts.gov/Case.aspx?cn=14-15-00396-CV&amp;coa=coa14|title=Case Detail|website=www.search.txcourts.gov|access-date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 24, 2015, Jared Woodfill, the lead plaintiff who sued the city, asked the case to be dismissed as [[mootness|moot]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.search.txcourts.gov/SearchMedia.aspx?MediaVersionID=b3861725-6b09-4545-a5f2-7b29a78c5eae&amp;coa=coa14&amp;DT=Motion&amp;MediaID=66fb2453-503c-46b4-96fe-e4be5b9610ed&lt;/ref&gt; On December 15, 2015, the Court of Appeals announced it would consider the motion to dismiss alongside the merits of the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.search.txcourts.gov/SearchMedia.aspx?MediaVersionID=eaf37e0e-3cbf-4689-8813-afd6fd3dbb3c&amp;coa=coa14&amp;DT=MT DISM DISP&amp;MediaID=d920e714-23f2-4125-b722-38386ffa829f]&lt;/ref&gt; On January 12, 2016, the Court ordered Jared Woodfill to file a brief on the merits by February 8, or the appeal would be dismissed, allowing Schaffer's ruling to stand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.search.txcourts.gov/SearchMedia.aspx?MediaVersionID=96c42b26-a3a7-48e5-86a4-60bce4a2dbd4&amp;coa=coa14&amp;DT=Order&amp;MediaID=7be45915-6eec-4d6e-a4aa-b27a9e635188&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nikolaialekseevmoscowpride06.jpg|thumb|[[Nikolay Alexeyev|The Applicant]] being arrested outside the [[Alexander Garden]] on 27 May 2006]]
'''''Alekseyev v. Russia''''' is a case before the [[European Court of Human Rights]] concerning the prohibition of the 2006, 2007 and 2008 ''[[Moscow Pride]]'' gay rights marches in [[Moscow|Russia's capital]]. The case was brought by Russian LGBT activist [[Nikolay Alexeyev]], organiser of the marches, who claimed the banning of the marches had violated [[Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 11 (freedom of assembly)]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. He claimed furthermore that he had not received an effective remedy under Article 13 against the violation of Article 11, and that he had been discriminated against by the authorities in Moscow under Article 14 in their consideration of his applications to hold the marches.

The First Section of the Court, sitting as a Chamber, found unanimously that there had been violations of [[Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Articles 11]], 13 and 14 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention]]. Their judgment was issued on 21 October 2010 and a referral by the Russian government to the Grand Chamber of the Court rejected on 11 April 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=open&amp;documentId=884399&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Press release No. 347, European Court of Human Rights, April 15, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; at which point the judgment became final.

==Background==
The Applicant, [[Nikolay Alexeyev]] (spelt by the Court, ''Alekseyev''), born 23 December 1977 in [[Moscow]], is a Russian [[LGBT rights]] activist, lawyer and journalist.

===Events in 2006===
In 2006, the Applicant along with several others began organising a march in [[Moscow]], the capital of [[Russia]], to demonstrate against [[LGBT rights in Russia|discrimination against LGBT people in Russia]]. The march was to be held on 27 May that year, the anniversary of the legalisation of homosexuality in Russia. On 16 February, a statement was released by the [[List of heads of Moscow government|Mayor of Moscow]], [[Yury Luzhkov]], stating that any proposed LGBT rights march would not be permitted to go ahead.

Notice was given by the organisers of the march to the Mayor on 15 May 2006, that around two thousand people were expected to participate in a march from the Moscow Post Office along Myasnitskaya Street to [[Lubyanka Square]], on 27 May starting at 3pm and lasting until 5pm. On 18 May, the organisers were informed that the Mayor had refused permission for the march on grounds of public order, for the prevention of riots and the protection of health, morals and the rights and freedoms of others.

The organisers submitted an alternative application involving only a picket in [[Lubyanka Square]] and also appealed the original refusal to a judge, however both were unsuccessful.

On 27 May 2006, when the march was intended to have been held, the Applicant along with several others attended a conference in honour of the [[International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia]], which had been on 17 May. The announced their intention of go to the [[Alexander Garden]] along the Western length of the [[Kremlin Wall]], and lay flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier as an act of remembrance to victims of fascism, including LGBT victims. They intended to follow this with a protest against the banning of the march with a fifteen-minute picket at the office of the [[Mayor of Moscow]] on [[Tverskaya Street]]. When the Applicant and fifteen others arrived at the Garden, they found the gates locked and some hundred and fifty policemen from the [[OMON]] riot police unit patrolling, as well as around one hundred individuals protesting against the planned flower-laying. The Applicant was arrested and the other demonstrators proceeded to the Mayor's office. Around one hundred arrests were made by the OMON police officers of people attacking the LGBT demonstrators. The Applicant's account of events on this day was corroborated by reports from the [[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association|International Lesbian and Gay Association]] (ILGA) and [[Human Rights Watch]].

===Events in 2007===
On 15 May 2007, the Applicant and other individuals submitted another application to the Mayor's office to hold a similar march to that proposed the year before, this time with an estimated attendance of five thousand one hundred people. This application was refused, and an alternative submitted proposing a picket before the Mayor's residence in [[Tverskaya Street]] and another in Novopushkinskiy Park, both of which were denied. On 27 May, the Applicant along with around twenty others attempted to deliver a petition against the prohibition of demonstration to the Mayor's office, but was detained by police along with two other men. He was convicted of the administrative offence of disobeying a lawful order from the police and fined one thousand [[Russian ruble|roubles]].

===Events in 2008===
On 18 April 2008, the Applicant along with other organisers submitted notice of ten intended marches to be held on 1 and 2 May 2008. All were refused on public safety grounds, and the organisers submitted another fifteen applications for marches on 3 and 5 May, all of which were refused for the same reasons. The Applicant then submitted a raft of other proposals, including one to the recently elected [[President of Russia]], [[Dmitry Medvedev]], stating his intention to hold a march in the [[Alexander Garden]] on 31 May 2008, to which he received no reply.

The Applicant appealed all of the refusals unsuccessfully, and attempted to organise a picket for 17 May calling for criminal charges to be brought against the Mayor for banning the marches. Permission for this was refused on 13 May on the same grounds as previously, however the organisers managed to hold a picket for around ten minutes on [[Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street]] near the Mayor's residence.

==Judgment==
[[Nikolay Alexeyev|Alexeyev]] applied to the [[European Court of Human Rights]], claiming the events surrounding the attempted marches in 2006 - 2008 had violated his right to [[freedom of assembly]] under [[Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]. He also claimed that he had not been able to access an effective remedy for the violation of Article 11, a violation of Article 13; and that the refusal to allow the marches to go forward had been discriminatory, in that it was made on the basis of his and other participants' sexual orientation, a violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 11.

The Court unanimously found violations of all three articles.

===Article 11 (freedom of assembly)===
'''Government's submissions'''&lt;br/&gt;
The Government claimed that domestic law allowed for the restriction of assembly on safety grounds, and that the circumstances of the Applicant's proposed marches and strength of public opinion against them would have meant a high risk of violence. They claimed Article 11 must be interpreted as allowing governments a broad [[margin of appreciation]], as this was required to accommodate the cultural situation of homosexuality in Russia. The Government also claimed that it had been necessary to ban the event for the protection of morals, referring prominent religious organisations' opposition to the march, and that, as there was no consensus between member states as to the legitimacy of homosexuality within society, national authorities were better placed than the European Court to determine the conditions for such events.

'''Applicant's submissions'''&lt;br/&gt;
The Applicant responded that the provisions used to ban the marches applied only to the safety and suitability of proposed venues rather than to a general risk of violence, and that the authorities on refusing an application for these reasons were obliged to suggest an alternative venue, which had not been done. He further contended that the Government's definition of morals was incorrect, as it referred only to majoritarian [[public opinion]] without regard to the concepts of [[cultural pluralism|pluralism]] or [[diversity (politics)|diversity]]. Furthermore, the proposed marches would not have been a threat to morals as they were concerned with [[human rights]] and [[civil liberties]] and would not have involved any sexually provocative content. He claimed the Government's references to public safety were unsubstantiated as they had not demonstrated an assessed risk of violence. He claimed finally that the sweeping nature of the ban was disproportionate and could not be justified on the grounds that it may have shocked or confused some parts of society (''[[Bączkowski v Poland]]'').

'''Findings of the Court'''&lt;br/&gt;
The Court found it unnecessary to consider the legitimate aim or domestic lawfulness of the ban as it had found the ban did not satisfy the requirement of being necessary in a democratic society.

The Court reiterated that Article 11 includes within it protection for assemblies which may be at risk of attack from groups who disagree with or are offended by the assembly's aims or purpose. (para.73) The Government had referred ''inter alia'' to a statement opposing the ban by the head Muslim cleric in [[Nizhniy Novgorod]] (Russia's fourth-largest city), that, "as a matter of necessity, homosexuals must be stoned to death", as evidence of the likely public disorder which would result from the march. The Court found that, "[b]y relying on such blatantly unlawful calls as grounds for the ban, the authorities effectively endorsed the intentions of persons and organisations that clearly and deliberately intended to disrupt a peaceful demonstration in breach of the law and public order." (para.76)

The Court found the ban disproportionate to the Government's stated aim of protecting children and vulnerable adults from homosexual propaganda. It also dismissed the Government's claim that the march should have been banned for conflicting with religious doctrine and the moral values of the majority. It stated that, if a minority group's exercise of rights guaranteed under the Convention were made conditional upon acceptance of that group by the societal majority, it would be "incompatible with the underlying values of the Convention" (para.81).

The Court responded to the statement by the Government that there was a lack of consensus between member states as to the legitimacy of homosexuality, stating there was a long-standing consensus on such matters as legalisation of homosexual activity (''[[Dudgeon v United Kingdom]]''), homosexuals in the military (''[[Smith and Grady v United Kingdom]]''), parental rights, succession to tenancies (''[[Recognition of same-sex unions in Austria|Karner v Austria]]''), and equal ages of consent (''[[S. L. v. Austria]]''). While issues such as adoption by same-sex couples and access to same-sex marriage were yet to be brought to consensus, the Court found there was "no ambiguity about the other member States' recognition of the right of individuals to openly identify themselves as gay, lesbian or any other sexual minority, and to promote their rights and freedoms, in particular by exercising their freedom of peaceful assembly." (para.84)

The Court found that the Government had taken no steps to assess the risk posed should the marches have gone ahead. It stated, "The only factor taken into account by the Moscow authorities was the public opposition to the event, and the officials' own views on morals." (para.85) The Government had failed to demonstrate any pressing social need to ban such demonstrations for any of the reasons it had given. The Court therefore found the ban not to have been necessary in a democratic society, and to have been a violation of the right to freedom of assembly under Article 11.

===Article 13 (effective remedy)===
Article 13 requires that within a member state a competent national authority must be able to provide a suitable domestic remedy to an aggrieved party, both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief. As the Applicant's Article 11 right had been violated, he was entitled to such relief under Article 13.

The Court stated that, in the circumstances, an appropriate remedy would have been for the Applicant to have been able to obtain a court ruling concerning the authorisation of the march before it was intended to take place. The Court found that the judicial remedies which had been available to the Applicant in the circumstances were of a ''post-hoc'' nature and could not have provided adequate redress to the Applicant, and that there had therefore been a violation of Article 13 (para. 99).

===Article 14 (discrimination)===
Article 14 protects against discrimination in access to rights under the Convention. Because it relates to access to rights, it can only be used in conjunction with another article, in this case Article 11.

'''Parties' submissions'''&lt;br/&gt;
The Government claimed that the antagonistic nature of the relationship between sexual minorities and religious groups in Russia meant it was necessary to place restrictions on the exercise of certain rights. The Applicant responded that the ban was discriminatory as it had been put in place due to the government of Moscow's disapproval of the participants' homosexuality. He referred to reference made by the Government to the disapproval of religious groups towards the march, and to comments made in the media by the Mayor of Moscow which were unfavourable towards homosexuality.

'''Findings of the Court'''&lt;br/&gt;
The Court stated that homosexuality was a ground for discrimination under Article 14, and that the [[margin of appreciation]] afforded to member states in this regard was narrow. It was necessary to show not just that measures taken were "suitable in general", but that they were "necessary in the circumstances" (para.108), and that if the sole reason put forward by a member state for restrictions on access to the Convention rights were the victims' homosexuality, it would amount to discrimination under Article 14. The Court found on the facts that the march participants' sexual orientation had been the main reason for banning the events, and that there had therefore been a violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 11.

===Just satisfaction===
The Applicant had claimed €40,000 in non-pecuniary damages, of which the Government was ordered to pay €12,000, as well as €17,510 in costs.

The lawsuits gained national attention due to their [[Freedom of religion in the United States|religious]] and [[civil rights]] implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |website=[[Huffington Post]] |title=Barronelle Stutzman, Arlene's Flower Shop Florist, Refuses Washington Gay Wedding Job Because Of Religion |date=March 7, 2013 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/07/arlenes-flower-shop-gay-wedding-washington_n_2828195.html |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=[[CNN]] |title=A florist loses religious freedom, and much more |first=Denny |last=Burk |date=February 20, 2015 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/20/living/stutzman-florist-gay/ |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal case==
The first two legal cases, ''Ingersoll v. Arlene's Flowers'' and ''State of Washington v. Arlene's Flowers'' were consolidated by  [[Benton County, Washington|Benton County]] Superior Court Judge Salvador Mendoza into a single case for purposes of [[Discovery (law)|discovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |newspaper=Star Tribune |title=Judge refuses to recuse himself in Washington state gay wedding flowers case |date=June 29, 2013 |url=http://www.startribune.com/business/yourmoney/213485301.html |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first civil suit, ''Ingersoll v. Arlene's Flowers'', was filed by a gay couple after Barronelle Stutzman, the owner of Arlene's Flowers, denied floral arrangements for their wedding. The couple had been customers of Stutzman's shop for nine years, but when they asked her to provide flowers for their wedding, the florist declined, citing her Christian beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |newspaper=[[National Catholic Register]] |title=Washington State Sues Florist for Declining to Beautify Same-Sex 'Wedding' |date=April 16, 2013 |url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/washington-state-sues-florist-for-declining-to-beautify-same-sex-wedding/ |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |newspaper=Tri-City Herald |title=Arlene's Flowers in Richland sued by gay couple |date=April 18, 2013 |url=http://www.tri-cityherald.com/2013/04/18/2361691/arlenes-flowers-in-richland-sued.html |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same-sex couple denied Stutzman's services, Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed, were represented by the ACLU in their lawsuit against the business on grounds of discrimination per the anti-discrimination laws of the state of Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ingersoll v.

The second suit against Stutzman was a [[consumer protection laws|consumer protection suit]] filed by state Attorney General [[Bob Ferguson (politician)|Bob Ferguson]].&lt;ref name="ADFMedia8199"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=[[Alliance Defending Freedom]] |date=May 16, 2013 |title=Wash. florist will not wilt, sues AG to reclaim religious freedom [press release] |url=http://www.adfmedia.org/News/PRDetail/8199 |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The premise of the suit, ''State of Washington v.

Stutzman, however, responded that she would not comply, with her counsel citing the state's constitution in regard to "freedom of conscience in all matters of religious sentiment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |newspaper=[[The Christian Post]] |title=Florist Who Refused Gay Wedding Offered Settlement; I Will Not Be Like Judas, Betray Jesus for Money, She Replied |first=Samuel |last=Smith |date=February 23, 2015 |url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/florist-who-refused-gay-wedding-offered-settlement-i-will-not-be-like-judas-betray-jesus-for-money-she-replied-134593/ |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Stutzman's response, Benton County Superior Court Judge Alexander Ekstrom ruled on January 7, 2015 that she could be sued in her personal capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |newspaper=Tri-State Herald |title=Judge: Arlene's Flowers owner can be sued in her personal capacity |date=January 7, 2015 |url=http://www.tri-cityherald.com/2015/01/07/3346717/judge-denies-motion-to-toss-out.html |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the state high court's decision, Stutzman filed a petition for a [[writ of certiorari]] in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], asking the Court to hear the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/arlenes-flowers-inc-v-washington/ Arlene’s Flowers, Inc. v. Washington], ''SCOTUSblog''.&lt;/ref&gt; During this case, a similar case, ''[[Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission]]'', had made its way to the Supreme Court, and which was decided in early June 2018. The ruling was made on procedural grounds in that the bakery owner's religious views were treated with hostility by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, and remanded that a new hearing be made. Stutzman, on this news, stated that she had also found her religious views treated with hostility by the state of Washington, and sought a similar rehearing. On June 25, 2018, the Supreme Court granted the petition for a [[writ of certiorari]], vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to the Supreme Court of Washington for further consideration in light of the ''Masterpiece Cakeshop'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/062518zor_g3bh.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/06/25/cake-flowers-supreme-court-wont-hear-new-same-sex-wedding-case/706187002/ | title = First cake, now flowers: Supreme Court gives florist who refused to serve gay wedding a new hearing | first = Richard | last = Wolf | date = June 25, 2018 | accessdate = June 25, 2018 | work = [[USA Today]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14560">'''Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights''' provides a right to respect for one's "private and family life, his home and his [[privacy of correspondence|correspondence]]", subject to certain restrictions that are "in accordance with law" and "necessary in a democratic society". The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) (formally the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) is an international treaty to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe.

==Right==
{{quote|'''Article 8 – Right to respect for private and family life'''

1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.

2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.}}

Article 8 is considered to be one of the Convention's most open-ended provisions.&lt;ref name="WicksRainey2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elizabeth Wicks|author2=Bernadette Rainey|author3=Clare Ovey|title=Jacobs, White and Ovey: the European Convention on Human Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TGygAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA334|date=12 June 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-965508-3|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Private life ===
For better understanding of perception of "private life" case law should be analyzed. In ''Niemietz v. Germany'', the Court held that it "does not consider it possible or necessary to attempt an exhaustive definition of the notion of 'private life'. However, it would be too restrictive to limit the notion to an 'inner circle' in which the individual may live his own personal life as he choose and to exclude therefrom entirely the outside world not encompassed within that circle. Respect for private life must also comprise&lt;ref&gt;https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Guide_Art_8_ENG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to a certain degree the right to establish and develop relationship and develop relationship with other human beings."

=== Family life ===
In ''X, Y, and Z v. UK'', the Court recalls that "the notion of 'family life' in Article 8 is not confined solely so the families based on marriage and may encompass other de facto relationship. When deciding whether a relationship can be said to amount  to 'family life', a number of factors may be relevant, including whether the couples live together, the length of their relationship and whether they have demonstrated their commitment to each other by having children together or by any other means."

=== Home ===
In ''Niemietz v Germany'' case the  court gave broader meaning to the 'home' notion including professional/business premises such as a lawyer's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cases and Materials on the European Convention on Human Rights|last=Mowbray|first=Alastair|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-920674-2|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case law==
Article 8 clearly provides a right to be free of unlawful searches, but the Court has given the protection for "private and family life" that this article provides a broad interpretation, taking for instance that prohibition of private consensual homosexual acts violates this article. This may be compared to the jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court, which has also adopted a somewhat broad interpretation of the right to privacy. Furthermore, Article 8 sometimes comprises [[positive obligations]]: whereas classical human rights are formulated as prohibiting a State from interfering with rights, and thus ''not'' to do something (e.g. not to separate a family under family life protection), the effective enjoyment of such rights may also include an obligation for the State to become active, and to ''do'' something (e.g. to enforce access for a divorced father to his child).
* ''[[Golder v. United Kingdom]]'' (1975) 1 EHRR 524 – A prisoner requested a lawyer because he said he wanted to sue a guard for [[defamation]]. Access was denied. This violated the right to a fair trial ([[Article 6 ECHR]]) and client confidentiality.
* ''[[Silver v. United Kingdom]]'' (1981) 3 EHRR 475 – Censorship of a prisoner's correspondence regarding conditions in prison breached Article 8.
* ''[[R v Brown]]'' [1994] 1 AC 212 – Article 8 was deemed not to "[invalidate] a law which forbids violence which is intentionally harmful to body and mind" (specifically, [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] as part of consensual sadomasochistic sex acts) by the UK [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=R v Brown [1993] UKHL 19(11 March 1993) |url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/19.html |accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Rotaru v. Romania'' [2000] ECHR 192 – Public information that is systematically collected and stored in files held by a state or its agents falls within the scope of private life.&lt;ref&gt;''Rotaru v. Romania'' (2000) ECHR 28341/95, paras. 43–44: "Moreover, public information can fall within the scope of private life where it is systematically collected and stored in files held by the authorities.

==Violation of the convention by mass surveillance==
[[Mass surveillance]], such as by the programs revealed in [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|Edward Snowden's global surveillance disclosures]], is often accused of violating the 8th article of the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harding|first1=Luke|title=Mass surveillance is fundamental threat to human rights, says European report|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/26/mass-surveillance-threat-human-rights-council-europe|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theintercept1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenwald|first1=Glenn|title=UN Report Finds Mass Surveillance Violates International Treaties and Privacy Rights|url=https://theintercept.com/2014/10/15/un-investigator-report-condemns-mass-surveillance/|publisher=The Intercept|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Kieren|title=European human rights court rules mass surveillance illegal|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/20/human_rights_court_rules_mass_surveillance_illegal/|publisher=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Says Mass Surveillance Violates Human Rights|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141015/07353028836/un-says-mass-surveillance-violates-human-rights.shtml|publisher=Techdirt|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does government spying violate human rights law? - Right Now|url=http://rightnow.org.au/opinion-3/does-government-spying-violate-human-rights-law/|publisher=Right Now|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 report to the [[UN General Assembly]] by the [[United Nations]]' top official for [[counter-terrorism]] and [[human rights]] condemned mass electronic surveillance as a clear violation of core [[privacy]] rights guaranteed by multiple treaties and conventions and makes a distinction between "[[targeted surveillance]]" – which "depend[s] upon the existence of prior suspicion of the targeted individual or organization" – and "mass surveillance", by which "states with high levels of [[Internet]] penetration can [] gain access to the telephone and e-mail content of an effectively unlimited number of users and maintain an overview of Internet activity associated with particular [[website]]s". Only targeted interception of traffic and location data in order to combat serious crime, including [[terrorism]], is justified, according to a decision by the [[European Court of Justice]].&lt;ref name=theguardian1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Asthana|first1=Anushka|title=Revealed: British councils used Ripa to secretly spy on public|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/25/british-councils-used-investigatory-powers-ripa-to-secretly-spy-on-public|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6671">'''Bioasphalt''' is an [[asphalt]] alternative made from non-petroleum based [[renewable resource]]s.

These sources include [[sugar]], [[wikt:molasses|molasses]] and [[rice]], [[maize|corn]] and [[potato]] [[starch]]es, natural tree and gum resins, natural latex rubber and vegetable oils, [[lignin]], [[cellulose]], palm oil waste, coconut waste, peanut oil waste, canola oil waste, dried [[sanitary sewer|sewerage]] effluent and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/CA2801866A1?]&lt;/ref&gt; Bitumen can also be made from waste vacuum tower bottoms produced in the process of cleaning used motor oils, which are normally burned or dumped into land fills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pittsh.com.au/documents/20070727NewsletterMarch2006.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720091421/http://pittsh.com.au/documents/20070727NewsletterMarch2006.pdf |date=July 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-petroleum based bitumen binders can be colored, which can reduce the temperatures of road surfaces and reduce the [[Urban heat island]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/heatisland/about/index.htm |title=Basic Information &amp;#124; Heat Island Effect &amp;#124; U.S. EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Petroleum, environmental, and heat concerns ==
Because of concerns over [[Peak oil]], [[pollution]] and [[climate change]], as well the [[oil price increases since 2003]], non-[[petroleum]] alternatives have become more popular.  This has led to the introduction of biobitumen alternatives that are more environmentally friendly and nontoxic.

For millions of people living in and around cities, [[Urban heat islands|heat islands]] are of growing concern. This phenomenon describes urban and suburban temperatures that are 1 to 6&amp;nbsp;°C (2 to 10&amp;nbsp;°F)  hotter than nearby rural areas. Elevated temperatures can impact communities by increasing peak energy demand, air conditioning costs, air pollution levels, and heat-related illness and mortality. There are common-sense measures that communities can take to reduce the negative effects of heat islands, such as replacing conventional black asphalt road surfaces with the new pigmentable bitumen that gives lighter colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.gov/heatisland/ |title=Heat Island Effect &amp;#124; U.S. EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=469&amp;ArticleID=5132&amp;I=en |title=Press Releases - February 2006 - Environmentally Sound Technology Fair Offers Innovative Solutions - United Nations Environment Programme |publisher=UNEP |date= |accessdate=2010-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130192421/http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=469&amp;ArticleID=5132&amp;I=en |archive-date=2010-11-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and implementation ==

Asphalt made with vegetable oil based binders was patented by Colas SA in France in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://answers.com/topic/colas-s-a?cat=biz-fin |title=Colas S.A.: Information and Much More from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://colas-cst.com/_ACTU_TECH/nouveauxproduits.php?fiche=0 COLAS CST - Végécol] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012084340/http://colas-cst.com/_ACTU_TECH/nouveauxproduits.php?fiche=0 |date=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of homeowners seeking an environmentally friendly alternative to asphalt for paving have experimented with waste vegetable oil as a binder for driveways and parking areas in single-family applications. The earliest known test occurred in 2002 in Ohio, where the homeowner combined waste vegetable oil with dry aggregate to create a low-cost and less polluting paving material for his 200-foot driveway. After five years, he reports the driveway is performing as well or better than petroleum-based materials.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

[[Shell Oil Company]] paved two public roads in Norway in 2007 with vegetable-oil-based asphalt. Results of this study are still premature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shell.com/static/bitumen-en/downloads/wrc/bioflux.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006110736/http://shell.com/static/bitumen-en/downloads/wrc/bioflux.pdf |date=October 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.halik.biz HALIK Asphalts LTD] from Israel has been experimenting with recycled and secondary road building since 2003. The company is using various wastes such as [[Vegetable oil|vegetable fats &amp; oils]], [[wax]] and [[thermoplastic elastomer]]s to build and repair roads. The results reported are so far satisfying.

On October 6, 2010, a bicycle path in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], was paved with [[bio-oil]] based asphalt through a partnership between [[Iowa State University]], the City of Des Moines, and [http://www.avellobioenergy.com/ Avello Bioenergy] Inc. Research is being conducted on the asphalt mixture, derived from plants and trees to replace petroleum-based mixes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2010/oct/Bioasphalt]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bioasphalt is a registered trademark of Avello Bioenergy Inc.

Dr. Elham H. Fini, at North Carolina A&amp;T University, has been spearheading research that has successfully produced bio asphalt from swine manure.

Since November 2014 the Dutch [[Wageningen University &amp; Research centre]] is running a pilot in the Dutch province of [[Zeeland]] with bioasphalt in which the binder of bitumen was substituted by [[lignin]]. &lt;ref name="bioasphalt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bioasphalt with lignin in Zeeland|url=http://www.wur.nl/en/newsarticle/Bioasphalt-with-lignin-in-Zeeland.htm|website=www.wur.nl|accessdate=26 November 2016|language=English|date=28 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126061206/http://www.wur.nl/en/newsarticle/Bioasphalt-with-lignin-in-Zeeland.htm|archivedate=26 November 2016|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=EOS Wetenschap|title=Dit is de snelweg van de toekomst (en hij loopt door Nederland)|url=http://www.hpdetijd.nl/2015-10-06/dit-is-de-snelweg-van-de-toekomst-en-hij-loopt-door-nederland/|website=HP/De Tijd|accessdate=26 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821025652/http://www.hpdetijd.nl/2015-10-06/dit-is-de-snelweg-van-de-toekomst-en-hij-loopt-door-nederland/|dead-url=yes|archivedate=21 August 2016|location=Sas van Gent, Zeeland, The Netherlands|language=Dutch|date=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bruce Arnold Ackerman''' (born August 19, 1943) is an [[United States|American]] [[constitutional law]] scholar.  He is a [[Sterling Professor]] at [[Yale Law School]].

In 2010, he was named by [[Foreign Policy]] magazine to its list of top global thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/11/29/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ackerman graduated from the [[Bronx High School of Science]], received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Harvard University]] in 1964 and [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree from [[Yale Law School]] in 1967.  He clerked for U.S Court of Appeals Judge [[Henry J. Friendly]] from 1967 to 1968, and then for [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[John Marshall Harlan II]] from 1968 to 1969.

Ackerman joined the faculty of [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1969.  He was a Professor at [[Yale University]] from 1974 to 1982 and at [[Columbia University]] from 1982 to 1987.  Since 1987 Ackerman has been the [[Sterling Professor]] of Law and Political Science at Yale.  He teaches classes at Yale on the concepts of justice and on his theories of constitutional transformation (i.e., the Constitution of the Founders was transformed by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]/Reconstruction and the New Deal).  His wife, [[Susan Rose-Ackerman]], is also a professor at Yale Law School who teaches classes on administrative law.  Their son, [[John M. Ackerman]], is also an academic who lives and works in Mexico.  Their daughter, Sybil Ackerman-Munson is an environmentalist in Portland, Oregon. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a [[National Order of Merit (France)|Commander of the Order of Merit of the French Republic]].

Ackerman is listed as counsel in U.S. Army Captain Nathan Michael Smith’s lawsuit against President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Savage|first1=Charlie|title=An Army Captain Takes Obama to Court Over ISIS Fight|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/05/us/islamic-state-war-powers-lawsuit-obama.html|accessdate=12 May 2016|work=The New York Times|date=5 May 2016|pages=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lawsuit asserts five counts against the President: that [[Operation Inherent Resolve]] violates the [[War Powers Resolution]], that the Constitution's Take Care Clause requires President Obama to publish a sustained legal justification of his actions, that the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]] does not authorize the operation against ISIS, that the [[Iraq Resolution]] does not authorize the operation in Iraq, and that the Commander in Chief clause does not allow President Obama to authorize the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ackerman|first1=Bruce|title=Is America's War on ISIS Illegal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/05/opinion/is-americas-war-on-isis-illegal.html|accessdate=12 May 2016|work=The New York Times|date=5 May 2016|pages=A25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Captain Smith’s attorneys allege he has standing to sue because he will be personally liable for any damages he inflicts in an illegal war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Matt|title=Is the U.S. War Against ISIS Illegal?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/is-the-us-war-against-isis-illegal/481377/|accessdate=12 May 2016|work=The Atlantic|date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The White House responded that the lawsuit raises "legitimate questions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=The Editorial Board of the New York Times|title=A Soldier's Challenge to the President|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/opinion/a-soldiers-challenge-to-the-president.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss|accessdate=12 May 2016|work=The New York Times|date=10 May 2016|pages=A22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the district court dismissed the lawsuit as a [[political question]], Ackerman appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ackerman|first1=Bruce|title=Trump Must Get Congress’s O.K. on Syria|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/opinion/what-trump-must-do-next-get-congresss-ok-on-syria.html|accessdate=20 October 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 April 2017|page=A25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of judicial review==
In her recent book on [[Hans Kelsen]], Sandrine Baume&lt;ref&gt;Baume, Sandrine (2011). ''Hans Kelsen and the Case for Democracy'', ECPR Press, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; identified Bruce Ackerman as a leading critic of the "compatibility of judicial review with the very principles of democracy," in contrast to writers like [[John Hart Ely]] and [[Ronald Dworkin]].&lt;ref&gt;id.&lt;/ref&gt; That reading of Ackerman fails to account for Ackerman's many arguments for judicial review in a democratic constitution, such as his ''Storrs Lecture'', when he noted that judicial review "is part of a larger theme that distinguishes the American Constitution from other, less durable, frameworks for liberal democracy."  As one of three principles of the economy of virtue, Ackerman sees a constitutional design for judicial review "that gives judges special incentives to uphold the integrity of earlier constitutional solutions against the pulling and hauling of normal politics."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce A. Ackerman, The Storrs Lectures: Discovering the Constitution, 93 Yale L.J. 1013, 1031 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ackerman has refined his approach but still asserts, "I refuse to join in the general retreat from judicial review that characterizes the contemporary work of many liberal constitutionalists."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Ackerman, De-Schooling Constitutional Law, 123 Yale L.J. 3104, 3120 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
He is the author of fifteen books and more than eighty articles. His interests cover constitutional theory, political philosophy, comparative law and politics, law and economics, American constitutional history, the environment, and social justice.

''We the People: Foundations'' is best known for its forceful argument that the "[[switch in time]]," whereby a particular member of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] changed his judicial philosophy to one that permitted much more of the [[New Deal]] legislation in response to the so-called court-packing plan, is an example of political determination of constitutional meaning.

If enough voters ''bullet vote'', almost any [[electoral system]] functions like a [[plurality voting system]]. This is generally considered a poor result, as many electoral systems are intended as reforms or improvements that avoid or minimize some argued disadvantages of plurality (aka [[first-past-the-post voting]]). However, if voters bullet vote as a conscious strategy to express their [[meta]]-preference that candidates with strong support are preferable to "compromise" candidates with broad support, it may not be a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/20020213/drawing-line|title=Drawing the Line|last=|first=|date=|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2017-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221150439/https://www.splcenter.org/20020213/drawing-line|archive-date=2017-02-21|dead-url=yes|language=en|quote=4. Anti-single-shot provisions: These provisions compel voters to cast a vote for every open seat, even if voters do not want to support more than one candidate. A voter who casts a vote for less than the entire number of seats open (a “full slate”) will not have his or her ballot counted. Requiring minority voters to vote for a full slate dilutes their voting strength by preventing them from concentrating their support behind one candidate.|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tactic is possible in any electoral system that does not require ranking all candidates. In practice, this is the majority of electoral systems as actually implemented (as opposed to in theory), since to reject ballots that do not rank all candidates risk an excessive number of [[spoilt vote|spoiled ballots]]. However, it is mainly an issue in electoral systems that reward this tactic&amp;mdash;primarily [[approval voting]], and to a lesser extent [[range voting]]&amp;mdash;and in those that do not significantly penalize it&amp;mdash;primarily [[instant-runoff voting]] and a non-standard form of [[Borda count]].

Candidates may seek to encourage bullet voting in certain situations. One example is where there is a [[Plurality-at-large voting|Bloc voting]] election for two seats of the same office, and there are several candidates (say A, B, and C). Voters in such a situation typically have two votes. Candidate A encourages his voters to vote only for him and not use their second vote. If the second vote is cast for B or C, it helps A's opponents. The situation is most pronounced where A is of one party and B and C are of another party. If voters from B and C's party vote for them, while A's partisans cast one vote for A and split their second vote between B and C, A is significantly disadvantaged.

The '''California Water Plan''' (Water Plan) is the State of California’s long-term strategic plan for managing and developing water resources throughout the state. The Water Plan is mandated by California Water Code Sections 10004–10013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=wat&amp;group=10001-11000&amp;file=10004-10013 California Water Code]. Retrieved 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[California Department of Water Resources]] (DWR) is required to update the plan every five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/01-02/bill/sen/sb_0651-0700/sb_672_bill_20010920_chaptered.html Bill Number: SB 672, Chaptered, Bill Text]. Retrieved 23 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Water Plan does not create mandates, propose specific projects, or authorize funding, Water Code Section 10005 defines the plan and its updates as “the master plan which guides the orderly and coordinated control, protection, conservation, development, management and efficient utilization of the water resources of the state.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csus.edu/ccp/documents/publications/ambruster_2008_ccp_-_water_plan_study.pdf Collaborative Versus Technocratic Policymaking: California’s Statewide Water Plan]. Retrieved 23 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven updates to the plan have been prepared since 1957.

==History==
The development of water plans in California date back to the 19th century. Since then, they have taken several different formats and titles. The first plan was put together in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22United+States.+Board+of+Commissioners+on+the+Irrigation+of+the+San+Joaquin%2C+Tulare%2C+and+Sacramento+Valleys+of+the+State+of+California%22 Report of the Board of Commissioners on the Irrigation of the San Joaquin, Tulare, and Sacramento valleys of the state of California]. Retrieved 22 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It covered ideas for water distribution in the state. In 1919, a report, titled “Irrigation of Twelve Million Acres in the Valley of California,”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterplan.water.ca.gov/docs/previous/marshallwaterplan1919.pdf Irrigation of Twelve Million Acres in the Valley of California]. Retrieved 22 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; provided the first comprehensive plan for water management. It is often referred to as the “Marshall Plan,” after its author, Col. Robert Bradford Marshall. In the decades following the release of that report, many water plans were issued as DWR bulletins (formal publications that include approved, official information to the governor, legislature, other government agencies, as well as the public).

The initial Water Plan (known as Bulletin 3)&lt;ref&gt;[http://restorethedelta.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/A-Century-of-Delta-Salt-Water-Barriers-2015-06-05.pdf A Century of Salt Water Barriers in the Delta]. Retrieved 23 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 1957 under the direction of DWR’s first director, [[Harvey Oren Banks]] (March 29, 1910 – September 22, 1996). A civil engineer, he was appointed State Engineer of California in 1955. A year later he was placed in charge of DWR. The Water Plan was intended for “the control, protection, conservation, distribution, and utilization of the waters of California, to meet present and future needs for all beneficial uses and purposes in all areas of the state to the maximum feasible extent.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterplan.water.ca.gov/docs/cwpu2005/vol4/vol4-background-lookbackatpastcawaterplans.pdf A Look Back at Past California Water Plans]. Retrieved 23 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Gov. Pat Brown would later say it was to “correct an accident of people and geography.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2010/04/plumbing-california/bourne-text California’s Pipe Dream: A Heroic System of Dams, Pumps, and Canals Can’t Stave Off a Water Crisis]. Retrieved 23 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

That first Water Plan, in 1957, and several updates that followed were, for the most part, technical documents focused on water supply development. The plans were gradually expanded to reflect the growing conflicts over California’s limited water resources.

In March 1966, ''Implementation of the California Water Plan''&lt;ref&gt;[[iarchive:s8implementationof16066calirich|Implementation of the California Water Plan]]. Retrieved 24 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; was released as Bulletin 160. All subsequent updates to the Water Plan have been issued under that bulletin number.

[[File:History of Funding with Sustainability Concept.jpg|thumb|474x474px|Since the earliest days of statehood, California has invested in water and flood management infrastructure to promote growth and economic development. A period of resource extraction led to a booming economy, while at the same time creating a number of unintended consequences, including environmental degradation. Environmental laws and regulations were enacted in the latter part of the 20th century to help remedy the consequences and restore the environment.]]
A new approach was established to produce the 1993 update. DWR worked with an advisory committee composed of a diverse group of stakeholders with the aim of making the Water Plan an all the “more technically accurate and politically balanced document.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csus.edu/ccp/documents/publications/ambruster_2008_ccp_-_water_plan_study.pdf Collaborative Versus Technocratic Policymaking: California’s Statewide Water Plan]. Retrieved 22 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the 1998 update, the Water Plan has moved beyond providing pure information to evaluating options for addressing future water shortages, even as extensive and early public input has been sought for each update. The approach involves dialogue and exchanges among Water Plan teams, committees, stakeholders, and the public. The sessions provide multiple opportunities for review by different audiences and feedback from a variety of perspectives. This transparent, collaborative, consensus-seeking process has been used by other agencies and states as a model for policy-planning efforts.

It takes into account an anticipated population increase from the current 38 million, to an estimated 50 million by 2049.

*  '''Strengthen Government Agency Alignment''': A key principle of IWM seeks to improve the way governments interact and ultimately deliver services. Aligning agencies in a collaborative manner, across jurisdictional boundaries at the appropriate geographic scale, provides for more efficiency in addressing water problems. The alignment would include management of data, planning, policy-making, and regulation across local, State, tribal, and federal governments.
*  '''Invest in Innovation and Infrastructure''': To reduce flood risk, provide reliable water supplies, and protect ecosystems, California will need up to $200 billion over the next 10 years just to maintain current levels of service and system conditions. It is projected that California will need up to $500 billion in future investment over the next few decades to reduce flood risk, provide reliable and clean water supplies, and restore and enhance ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/california-eyes-500-billion-water-spending California eyes $500 billion in water spending].

The Santa Margarita Conjunctive Use Project in [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]] is cited as an example of the three themes in action. This [[conjunctive use]] project is designed to provide for enhanced recharge of the groundwater basin beneath the [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]] in northern San Diego County. It also includes a seawater intrusion barrier that uses recycled water, a distribution system, and advanced water treatment facilities. The project will provide a new water supply of about {{Convert|6800|acre-feet|e6m3}} per year for Camp Pendleton and Fallbrook Public Utilities District, and will resolve a long-standing water rights dispute between [[Fallbrook, California|Fallbrook]] and the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://villagenews.com/local/update-given-on-santa-margarita-conjunctive-use-project/ Update Given on Santa Margarita Conjunctive Use Project].

Other key themes will promote strengthening flood and river management. Update 2018 will also include, for the first time, a five-year State investment strategy and companion finance plan. It will be the first Water Plan update to “identify specific outcomes and metrics to track performance, prioritize near-term State actions and investments, recommend financing methods having more stable revenues, and inform water deliberations and decisions as they unfold.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterplan.water.ca.gov/docs/enews/2015/cwp_e-news123015.pdf California Water Plan eNews].

Following the recommendations published in the ''Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration'' in 1885, the '''''Chinese Immigration Act of 1885''''' (the ''Act'') was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Act of Parliament]] that placed a [[tax per head|head tax]] of $50 on all [[China|Chinese]] immigrants coming to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asian.ca/law/cia1885.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Assented on 20 July 1885, the intention of the ''Chinese Immigration Act'' was stated explicitly in its heading, reading "An Act to restrict and regulate Chinese immigration into Canada."&lt;ref name="Canada 1885"&gt;''Statutes of Canada. An Act of Respecting and Regulating Chinese Immigration into Canada, 1885. Ottawa: SC 48-49 Victoria, Chapter 71''&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the early 1880s during the building of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], as many as 17,000 Chinese immigrants came to Canada to work as [[Laborer|labourers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/settlement/kids/021013-2031.3-e.html|title = ARCHIVED - The Kid's Site of Canadian Settlement: Chinese History|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was as a result of the cheap labour demand in the West. Major labour shortages in British Columbia and surrounding areas threatened the economic viability of the emerging Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Vic Satzewich,
"Racisms: The Reactions to Chinese Migrants in Canada at the Turn of the.
Century," ''International Sociology'' 4,
no. 3 (1989): 313.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as a way to bring the West economic efficiency, Chinese immigration was encouraged in the early 1880s. Furthermore, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) was formed to physically unite Canada and required cheap labour to complete its construction. Founded in 1881, the CPR was completed on November 7, 1885 - "six years ahead of schedule - when the last spike was driven at Craigellachie, B.C."&lt;ref&gt;'Our History'. Accessed 23 October 2015. http://www.cpr.ca/en/about-cp/our-history&lt;/ref&gt; After its completion, the demand for Chinese immigration dropped dramatically and became dispensable.

Dissatisfaction with Chinese immigration grew and in 1885 a [[Royal Commission]] was appointed to obtain proof that restricting Chinese [[Immigration to Canada|immigration]] would be in the best interests of the country. Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald]] originally refused to introduce prohibitive measures, but eventually yielded and appointed the commission. The commission was entitled ''Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration'' in 1885 and interviewed hundreds of people with the goal of understanding the majority's view on Chinese immigration.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://eco.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.14563/315?r=0&amp;s=2 Report of the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration: Report and Evidence]'' of
1885&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission was led by [[Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau]] and [[John Hamilton Gray (New Brunswick politician)|John Hamilton Gray]] who gathered testimony regarding Chinese immigration at [[Hearing (law)|public hearings]] across [[British Columbia]] and compared these testimonies to those gathered on the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] of the [[United States]]. The testimonies of 51 people were submitted. Only two Chinese witnesses were consulted: two officials from the Chinese Consulate in [[San Francisco]]. Multiple viewpoints were reported, including some in favour of Chinese immigration on an economic efficiency scale.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://eco.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.14563/315?r=0&amp;s=2 Report of the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration: Report and Evidence]'' of
1885, page 97&lt;/ref&gt; But, the overall consensus on the state of Chinese immigration was a vocalized demand for its restriction.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://eco.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.14563/315?r=0&amp;s=2 Report of the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration: Report and Evidence]'' of 1885, page 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Claims against the Chinese were slanderous and were found to have little evidence behind them. Despite this, the Commission recommended a moderate legislation against Chinese immigration and proposed a $10 [[Head tax (Canada)|head tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration, 1885 {{!}} CMIP 21|url = http://www.pier21.ca/research/immigration-history/royal-commission-on-chinese-immigration-1885|website = www.pier21.ca|accessdate = 2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
The ''Chinese Immigration Act'' of 1885 was enacted as a result of the findings of the Commission. The ''Act'' imposed a $50 [[Head tax (Canada)|head tax]] on Chinese immigrants, with the exceptions of [[diplomat]]s, government representatives, [[Tourism|tourists]], [[merchant]]s, "men of science", and [[student]]s. The imposed duty of $50 was a significant increase from the $10 duty recommended by the Royal Commission.

This piece of legislation became the first in Canada's history to exclude immigrants on the basis of their ethnic origin.&lt;ref&gt;Ninette Kelley and Michael Trebilcock, ''The Making of the Mosaic: A History of Canadian Immigration Policy'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1998), 107.&lt;/ref&gt; It also defined "Chinese Immigrant" in section 1 as "The expression 'Chinese Immigrant' means any person of Chinese origin entering Canada and not entitled to the privilege of exemption provided for by section four of this Act."&lt;ref name="Canada 1885"/&gt; Furthermore, vessels that were transporting Chinese immigrants were permitted to only carry one Chinese immigrant per 50 tonnes of the ship's weight. This law also prevented any Chinese immigrants who suffered from a [[Infection|contagious disease]] such as [[leprosy]] or any Chinese woman who was known to have been a [[Prostitution|prostitute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Chinese Immigration Act, 1885 {{!}} CMIP 21|url = http://www.pier21.ca/research/immigration-history/the-chinese-immigration-act-1885#footnote-1|website = www.pier21.ca|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Act limited the number of Chinese immigrants so much so that legally, a 300-ton ship could only carry six Chinese immigrants to Canada. Furthermore, despite mass fervour towards the banning of Chinese immigrants in 1885, due to Canada being a [[colony]] under [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the passing of Chinese exclusion would not be possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Crossroads : Pacific Connections : The Making of the U.S.-Canadian Borderlands|last=Chang|first=Kornel|publisher=University of California Press|year=June 2012|isbn=9780520271685|location=|pages=45|via=ProQuest ebrary}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was because the banning of Chinese immigrants did not fall with British interests at the time.

The ''Act'' was amended in 1887 to allow Chinese women who were married to non-Chinese men to enter Canada, as well as Chinese passing through Canada via railway. An additional amendment in 1892 required Chinese residents of Canada who wished to temporarily leave the country to register with an immigration official before departure.

In 1900, the [[Head tax (Canada)|head tax]] was raised to $100 by Prime Minister [[Wilfrid Laurier]], due to a still growing influx of Chinese immigrants. In 1903, this was further raised to $500. Companies in short supply of cheap labour would often advance this money to bring Chinese immigrants to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Chinese Immigration Act, 1885 {{!}} CMIP 21|url = http://www.pier21.ca/research/immigration-history/the-chinese-immigration-act-1885|website = www.pier21.ca|accessdate = 2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Act'' was eventually superseded in 1923 by the [[Chinese Immigration Act of 1923|''Chinese Immigration Act'' of 1923]], also known as the ''Chinese Exclusion Act'' (not to be confused with the [[Chinese Exclusion Act|Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]]), which banned Chinese immigration entirely.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canadiana.org/citm/specifique/asian_e.html#exclusion&lt;/ref&gt;

== Redress ==
In the 1980s, voices for redress emerged in the Chinese-Canadian community. Organizations that strove for promoting the rights of all individuals, particularly those of Chinese Canadians, and encouraging their full and equal participation in Canadian society.

In the 1980s, the Chinese Canadian National Council (CCNC) began to collect head tax certificates and in 1984 "the CCNC presented the government with a list of names of 2,300 surviving Chinese who had each paid a head tax."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_chinese_overseas/v004/4.1.li.html|title = Reconciling with History: The Chinese-Canadian Head Tax Redress|last = Li|first = Peter|date = May 2008|journal = Journal of Chinese Overseas|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent survey by CCNC "found that of the 867 respondents who completed the questionnaire, 46 percent were in favor of an official apology and a symbolic redress to the individual victims, while 38 percent also supported some form of community redress."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1990, the CCNC successfully lobbied for political endorsement for a redress. By 1993, a redress proposal was submitted to the representatives of five groups including Chinese Canadians. At this time, the redress only offered an "omnibus apology." The offer was rejected by the Chinese Canadian groups and no resolutions were made that federal term.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As a result of the ''Act'' and its imposed Head Tax, a redress, with apologies and compensations, took place only officially in 2006. After the election of the minority Conservative government in 2006, Stephen Harper affirmed his position on Chinese immigration: "Chinese Canadians are making an extraordinary impact on the building of our country. They've also made a significant historical contribution despite many obstacles. That's why, as I said during the election campaign, the Chinese Canadian community deserves an apology for the head tax and appropriate acknowledgement and redress."&lt;ref&gt;"Throne speech promises crime crackdown, GST cut." ''CBC News.'' April 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective August 29, 2006, Canada's redress program combined "payments to individual head tax payers, (or, if the payer is deceased, to their spouse) with funding for educative and commemorative programs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 25166221|title = The Stakes of Inclusion: Chinese Canadian Head Tax Redress|last = Winter|first = Stephen|date = March 2008|journal = Canadian Journal of Political Science Association and the Société québécoise de science politique|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
The ''Chinese Immigration Act'' of 1885 carried great weight as a result of it being the first of its kind in Canadians history and subsequently laying down the foundations for future further exclusionary policies and acts. The act laid down the legal framework for Head Taxes which was later refined even more harshly.

The aim of establishing a "white" society for Canada, as Kenneth Munro explains,"such discrimination flew in the face of that crucial premise of Canadian nationhood, namely, respect for diversity of culture and traditions."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Munro, "The Chinese Immigration Act, 1885: Adolphe Chapleau and the French Canadian Attitude," ''Canadian Ethnic Studies,'' no. 3 (1 January 1987): 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain Rights are so fundamental that they are guaranteed to all persons, not just citizens.  Those rights include the rights guaranteed by the First 8 Amendments that pertain to individuals.  However, not all U.S. citizens, such as those living in [[Puerto Rico]], have the right to vote in federal elections.

There are two primary sources of citizenship: [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|birthright citizenship]], in which a person is presumed to be a citizen if he or she was born within the territorial limits of the United States, or—providing certain other requirements are met—born abroad to a U.S. citizen parent,&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|8|1401}} ("Nationals and citizens of United States at birth"); {{cite web |url=https://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship |title=U.S. Citizenship |publisher=[[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] |access-date=December 24, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: A person is presumed to be a full citizen in the sense of having a duty to pay some types of taxes and serve on juries, upon reaching the age of majority. At present the age of majority is 18 years.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[United States nationality law|naturalization]], a process in which an eligible [[Permanent residence (United States)|legal immigrant]] applies for citizenship and is accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|8|1101|a|23}} ("The term '[[naturalization]]' means the conferring of nationality of a state upon a person after birth, ''by any means whatsoever.''") (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt; These two pathways to citizenship are specified in the [[Citizenship Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]'s 1868 [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] which reads:

{{quote|sign=14th Amendment|source=|All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the [[U.S. state|State]] wherein they reside.}}

''National citizenship'' signifies membership in the country as a whole; ''state citizenship'', in contrast, signifies a relation between a person and a particular [[U.S. state|state]] and has application generally limited to domestic matters. State citizenship may affect (1) tax decisions and (2) eligibility for some state-provided benefits such as [[Higher education in the United States|higher education]] and (3) eligibility for state political posts such as [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]].

In [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] of the Constitution, the power to establish a "uniform rule of naturalization" is granted explicitly to [[United States Congress|Congress]].

U.S. law permits multiple citizenship. A citizen of another country naturalized as a U.S. citizen may retain their previous citizenship, though they must renounce [[allegiance]] to the other country. A U.S. citizen retains U.S. citizenship when becoming the citizen of another country, should that country's laws allow it. U.S. citizenship can be [[Relinquishment of United States nationality|renounced]] by [[Americans]] who also hold another citizenship ''via'' a formal procedure at a U.S. Embassy,&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|8|1481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_776.html |title=Legal Considerations |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date= |accessdate=April 8, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114122347/http://travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_776.html |archivedate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it can also be restored.&lt;ref name=tws19nova19a&gt;{{cite news

==Rights, duties, and benefits==

===Rights===
[[File:Army.afnews.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Picture of four soldiers outdoors in front of a fence; one soldier points to the left|The U.S. military has been an [[Conscription in the United States|all-volunteer force]] since the end of the Vietnam War, but male U.S. citizens and non-citizens are still required to register for the [[Selective Service System|military draft]] within 30 days of their 18th birthday.]]

* '''Freedom to reside and work'''. United States citizens have the inalienable right to reside and work in the United States. Certain non-citizens, such as permanent residents, have similar rights; however, non-citizens, unlike citizens, may have the right taken away. For example, they may be [[deportation|deported]] if convicted of a serious crime.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services: [http://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship/citizenship-through-naturalization Citizenship Through Naturalization]: [http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/article/M-476.pdf A Guide to Naturalization], page 28 of 58 in PDF, page 25 in hard copy&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Freedom to enter and leave the United States'''. United States citizens have the right to enter and leave the United States freely. Certain non-citizens, such as permanent residents, have similar rights. Unlike permanent residents, U.S. citizens do not have an obligation to maintain residence in the U.S. – they can leave for any length of time and return freely at any time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
* '''Voting''' for federal office in all fifty states and the District of Columbia is restricted to citizens only.  States are not required to extend the franchise to all citizens: for example, several states bar citizen [[felony|felon]]s from voting, even after they have completed any custodial sentence.  The [[Constitution of the United States|United States Constitution]] bars states from restricting citizens from voting on grounds of race, color, previous condition of servitude, sex, failure to pay any tax, or age (for citizens who are at least eighteen years old).  Historically, many states and local jurisdictions have allowed [[Right of foreigners to vote in the United States|non-citizens to vote]]; however, today this is limited to local elections in very few places. Citizens are not [[Compulsory voting|compelled to vote]].
* '''Freedom to stand for public office'''.  The [[Constitution of the United States|United States Constitution]] requires that all members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] have been citizens for seven years, and that all [[United States Senate|senator]]s have been citizens for nine years, before taking office.  Most states have similar requirements:  for example [[California]] requires that legislators have been citizens for three years, and the Governor have been a citizen for five years, upon taking office. The U.S. Constitution requires that one be "[[Natural-born-citizen clause|a natural born Citizen]]" and a U.S. resident for fourteen years in order to be [[President of the United States]] or [[Vice President of the United States]]. The Constitution also stipulates that otherwise eligible citizens must meet certain age requirements for these offices.
* '''Right to apply for federal employment'''. Many federal government jobs require applicants to have U.S. citizenship. U.S. citizens can apply for federal employment within a government agency or department.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|last=Services|first=USCIS-United States Citizenship and Immigration|title=English: The Citizen's Almanac - Pub.

===Duties===

* '''Jury duty''' is only imposed upon citizens. [[Jury duty]] may be considered the "sole differential obligation" between non-citizens and citizens; the federal and state courts "uniformly exclude non-citizens from jury pools today, and with the exception of a few states in the past, this has always been the case".&lt;ref name="Law2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J. Spiro |title=Beyond Citizenship : American Identity After Globalization: American Identity After Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Jb_RomQSkUC|date=December 31, 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-972225-9 |p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Military participation''' is not currently required in the United States, but a policy of [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] of men has been in place at various times (both in war and in peace) in American history, most recently during the [[Vietnam War]]. Currently, the [[United States Armed Forces]] are a professional [[Volunteer military|all-volunteer]] force, although both male U.S. citizens and male non-citizen [[Permanent residence (United States)|permanent resident]]s are required to register with the [[Selective Service System]] and may be called up in the event of a future draft. [[Johns Hopkins University]] political scientist [[Benjamin Ginsberg (political scientist)|Benjamin Ginsberg]] writes, "The professional military has limited the need for citizen soldiers."&lt;ref name=tws16dec14/&gt;
* '''Taxes'''. In the [[United States]] today, everyone except those whose income is derived from tax-exempt revenue (Subchapter N, Section 861 of the U.S. Tax Code) is required to file a federal income tax return. American citizens are subject to federal income tax on worldwide income regardless of their country of residence.&lt;ref name=tws19nova14&gt;{{cite news

===Benefits===
* '''Consular protection outside the United States'''. While traveling abroad, if a person is arrested or detained by foreign authorities, the person can request to speak to somebody from the U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Consular officials can provide resources for Americans incarcerated abroad, such as a list of local attorneys who speak English. The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] may even intervene on the person's behalf.&lt;ref name=tws20nov12/&gt; Non-citizen U.S. nationals also have this benefit.
* '''Increased ability to sponsor relatives living abroad'''.&lt;ref name=tws20nov12/&gt; Several types of immigrant visas require that the person requesting the visa be directly related to a U.S. citizen. Having U.S. citizenship facilitates the granting of IR and F visas to family members.
* '''Ability to invest in U.S. real property without triggering FIRPTA'''. Perhaps the only quantifiable economic benefit of U.S. citizenship, citizens are not subject to additional withholding tax on income and capital gains derived from U.S. real estate under the [[Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act]] (FIRPTA).{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}
* '''Transmission of U.S. citizenship to children born abroad'''. Generally, children born to two U.S. citizen parents abroad are automatically U.S. citizens at birth. When the parents are one U.S. citizen and one non-U.S. citizen, certain conditions about the U.S. citizen's parent's length of time spent in the U.S. need to be met.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|8|1401|c}} and (d).&lt;/ref&gt; See [[United States nationality law#Through birth abroad to United States citizens|United States nationality law]] for more details. Non-citizen U.S. nationals also have a similar benefit (transmission of non-citizen U.S. nationality to children born abroad).

[[Participation (decision making)|Civic participation]] is not required in the United States. There is no requirement to attend town meetings, belong to a political party, or vote in elections.

[[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]] professor [[Dana D. Nelson]] suggests that most Americans merely vote for president every four years, and sees this pattern as undemocratic. In her book ''[[Bad for Democracy]]'', Nelson argues that declining citizen participation in politics is unhealthy for long term prospects for [[democracy]].

However, writers such as [[Robert D. Kaplan]] in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' see benefits to non-involvement; he wrote "the very indifference of most people allows for a calm and healthy political climate".&lt;ref name=tws27nov42&gt;{{cite news

A person who is considered a citizen by more than one nation has ''[[multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]]''. It is possible for a United States citizen to have dual citizenship; this can be achieved in various ways, such as by birth in the United States to a parent who is a citizen of a foreign country (or in certain circumstances the foreign nationality may be transmitted even by a grandparent) by birth in another country to a parent(s) who is/are a United States citizen/s, or by having parents who are citizens of different countries.  Anyone who becomes a naturalized U.S. citizen is required to renounce any prior "allegiance" to other countries during the naturalization ceremony;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The earliest recorded instances of dual citizenship began before the French Revolution when the British captured American ships and forced them back to Europe. The British Crown considered subjects from the United States as British by birth and forced them to fight in the Napoleonic wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiro|first1=Peter J.|title=At Home in Two Countries: The Past and Future of Dual Citizenship|journal=European Journal of American Studies|date=January 2017|url=http://ejas.revues.org/11962|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under certain circumstances there are relevant distinctions between dual citizens who hold a "substantial contact" with a country, for example by holding a passport or by residing in the country for a certain period of time, and those who do not. For example, under the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax (HEART) Act of 2008, U.S. citizens in general are subject to an [[expatriation tax]] if they give up U.S. citizenship, but there are exceptions (specifically {{USCSub|26|877A|g|1|b}}) for those who are either under age 18½ upon giving up U.S. citizenship and have lived in the U.S. for less than ten years in their lives, or who are dual citizens by birth residing in their other country of citizenship at the time of giving up U.S. citizenship and have lived in the U.S. for less than ten out of the past fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.advisor.ca/news/industry-news/cut-u-s-tax-ties-68108|first=Beth|last=Webel|first2=Christopher|last2=Gandhu|title=Cut U.S. tax ties|work=Advisor.ca|publisher=[[Rogers Media]]|date=December 19, 2011|accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the United States considers holders of a foreign passport to have a substantial contact with the country that issued the passport, which may preclude [[security clearance]].

U.S. citizens are required by federal law to identify themselves with a U.S. passport, not with any other foreign passport, when entering or leaving the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1753.html US State Department Services Dual Nationality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014040015/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1753.html |date=October 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court case of ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'' declared that a U.S. citizen did not lose his citizenship by voting in an election in a foreign country, or by acquiring foreign citizenship, if they did not intend to lose U.S. citizenship.

Citizenship began in colonial times as an active relation between men working cooperatively to solve municipal problems and participating actively in democratic decision-making, such as in [[New England]] town hall meetings.

Earlier on, U.S. citizenship was not given to people of Indian or East Asian descent. [[A. K. Mozumdar]] was the first person born in the Indian sub-continent to attain U.S. citizenship. A few years earlier, as a result of the 1898 United States v. [[Wong Kim Ark]] Supreme Court decision, ethnic Chinese born in the United States became citizens. During World War II, due to Japan's heavy involvement as an aggressor, it was decided to restrict many Japanese citizens from applying for U.S. citizenship, while Chinese citizens encountered no trouble, because of China's alliance with the United States.

The [[Equal Nationality Act of 1934]] was an American law which allowed foreign-born children of American mothers and [[Alien (law)|alien]] fathers who had entered America before age 18 and lived in America for five years to apply for American citizenship for the first time.&lt;ref name="Kitch2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sally Kitch|title=The Specter of Sex: Gendered Foundations of Racial Formation in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5mSGB7epL2gC&amp;pg=PA179|date=August 6, 2009|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-2754-6|pages=179–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also made the naturalization process quicker for American women's alien husbands.&lt;ref name="Kitch2009"/&gt; This law equalized expatriation, immigration, naturalization, and repatriation between women and men.&lt;ref name="Kitch2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LewisChambers1935"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ervin Eugene Lewis|author2=Merritt Madison Chambers|title=New Frontiers of Democracy: The Story of America in Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-FCAAAAIAAJ|year=1935|publisher=American education Press, Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not applied retroactively, and was modified by later laws, such as the [[Nationality Act of 1940]].&lt;ref name="Kitch2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marback2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Marback|title=Generations: Rethinking Age and Citizenship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHV2BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203|date=February 16, 2015|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0-8143-4081-3|pages=203–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of citizenship naturalization is a highly contentious matter in US politics, particularly regarding illegal immigrants. Candidates in the 2008 presidential election, such as [[Rudolph Giuliani]], tried to "carve out a middle ground" on the issue of illegal immigration, but rivals such as [[John McCain]] advocated legislation requiring illegal immigrants to first leave the country before being eligible to apply as citizens.&lt;ref name=tws19nov43&gt;{{cite news

'''''Crane v. Commissioner''''', 331 U.S. 1 (1947),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Crane v. Commissioner|link=|volume=331|page=1|pin=|year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a case heard before the [[United States Supreme Court]] concerning the value, for [[tax]] purposes, of [[Inheritance|inherited]] [[property]] with a [[Nonrecourse debt|nonrecourse]] [[mortgage law|mortgage]] encumbering it. According to [[Boris I. Bittker]], ''Crane'' "laid the foundation stone of most tax shelters."

Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson]] wrote the opinion.

==Facts==
Petitioner, Crane, was the sole beneficiary and executrix of her husband's estate. She inherited an apartment building and land, which secured a principal debt of $255,000 and interest in default of $7,042.  The property was for estate tax purposes at a value equal to the mortgage encumbrance.  Six years later, with [[foreclosure]] imminent, the property was sold for $3,000 subject to the mortgage and Crane incurred $500 in expenses to complete the sale.  Crane reported $2,500.00 of taxable gain from the sale of the apartment.

==Issue 1==
Did the original [[Cost basis|basis]] in the hands of Mrs. Crane include the full value of the property inherited, undiminished by the loan debt?

==Issue 2==
Should the amount of the debt assumed by the purchaser of the apartment building have been included in Mrs. Crane's calculation of the amount realized on the sale?

==Arguments==
Crane argued that the "property" she acquired upon her husband's death was simply the equity in the land and building, which was the excess of the value of the land and building over the then-existing mortgage (i.e. the equity was zero based on the facts).  As a result, she argued that the amount she realized on the sale of the building was her net cash received: $2,500.

The [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue|Commissioner of the IRS]] claimed that the property inherited by Crane was the building and land itself, not merely the equity in the building and land.  This position had the merit of comporting with the facts at hand: prior to selling the property, Mrs. Crane had been allowed [[depreciation deduction]]s in excess of $25,000 on the building.  Correspondingly, the Commissioner argued that Crane, through the sale of the building and land, received an amount equal to the net of the cash received in addition to the amount of debt assumed by the purchaser.

==Holding and rationale==
The Court first sided with the Commissioner, agreeing with its construction of the relevant statutory provision that addresses the basis of "property" inherited.  The Court found no basis to think "equity" was a synonym for "property."  In addition, the Court was troubled by the administrative complications that would be caused by replacing "property" with "equity" when determining depreciation, and by turning over administrative rules that had existed for some time.

Second, the Court determined that the amount Mrs. Crane realized from the sale of the "property" should be driven by the conclusion on the first issue.  The Court sided with cases repudiating the claim that there must be an actual receipt of money or other property for a taxable gain to result from a transaction.  Finally, the Court determined that a mortgagor who transfers a property subject to the mortgage benefits as if the purchaser had paid the mortgage on the property.

"We are ... concerned with the reality that an owner of property, mortgaged at a figure less than that at which the property will sell, must and will treat the conditions of the mortgage exactly as if they were his personal obligations.  If he transfers subject to the mortgage, the benefit to him is as real and substantial as if the mortgage were discharged, or as if a personal debt in an equal amount had been assumed by another."

==Importance==
This case supports the doctrine of U.S. income tax law that a seller of property subject to a [[nonrecourse debt]] (as opposed to a recourse debt where the seller may remain liable for any unsatisfied balance remaining after the transfer) realizes an amount that includes the debt assumed by the purchaser.  This is an important concept because a large percentage of real property is held subject to a mortgage or other debt and, therefore, the debt must be dealt with as a part of the sale of such property.  As a result, when property encumbered by debt is sold, the tax consequences of the passing of the debt have a significant effect on the overall tax consequences of the sale.  For example, in this case, a taxpayer who sold an apartment building for $3,000 was forced to recognize taxable income of over $24,000.  Of course, the case also had the unintended collateral effect of legitimizing the idea that a taxpayer can purchase depreciable property with nonrecourse debt, a purchase the risk of which is largely borne by the lender, and (possibly) of realizing the interim tax benefit associated with increased depreciation and amortization deductions.

It should be noted, as stated in the quoted text above, that the result in Crane is specifically limited to situations where the property mortgage was less than the value of the property mortgaged.  See footnotes 37 and 42.  The reasoning cited, that the taxpayer will treat the property as his own in order to protect his equity investment, has been called the "Crane Economic Benefit Rule."  That reasoning was turned on its head 36 years later in the case ''[[Commissioner v. Tufts]]'', 461 U.S. 300 (1983), which addressed the situation that Crane had left unresolved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11605">[[File:Panic bar.jpg|right|thumb|A crash bar fitted to a glass exterior door.]]
'''Crash bar''' (also known as a '''panic''' '''exit device, panic bar,''' or '''push bar''')&lt;ref name="ansi"&gt;American National Standards Institute, ANSI/BHMA A156.3-2001, American National Standard for Exit Devices&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Part 2, "California Building Code." 1008.1.9&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[door handle|door opening mechanism]] which allows users to open a door by pushing a bar. While originally conceived as a way to prevent crowd crushing in an emergency, crash bars are now used as the primary door opening mechanism in many commercial buildings.

The device consists of a spring-loaded metal bar which is fixed horizontally to a door that swings in the direction of an exit. When the bar is depressed, it activates a mechanism which unlatches the door, allowing occupants to quickly leave the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ANSI/BHMA A156.3-2001. American National Standard for Exit Devices|last=|first=|publisher=American National Standards Institute|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern fire standards often mandate that doors be fitted with crash bars in commercial and other occupancies where mass evacuation may be slowed by other types of door openers.

They are sometimes intended solely for [[emergency exit|emergency use]] and may be fitted with alarms. However, in many buildings the crash bar functions as the primary mechanism for opening a door in normal circumstances as well. In some places, they are even used when not required by code because they are quicker and easier for users compared with a knob or lever handle.

==Background==
Following  the events of the [[Victoria Hall disaster]] in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland, England]] in 1883 in which 183 children died because a door had been bolted at the bottom of a stairwell, the [[British government]] began legal moves to enforce minimum standards for building safety. This slowly led to the legal requirement that venues must have a minimum number of outward opening doors as well as locks which could be opened from the inside. Motivated by the Sunderland disaster, Robert Alexander Briggs (1868–1963) invented the panic bolt which was granted a UK patent on 13 August 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/RobertBriggsPanicBolts.htm|title=Robert Alexander Briggs and the invention of the Panic Bolt|first=Patricia|last=Lovell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However these moves were not globally copied. For example, in the [[United States]], 605 people died in the [[Iroquois Theatre fire]] in [[Chicago]] in December 1903 because iron gates blocked exits. Five years later 174 people in Ohio died in the [[Collinwood school fire]], which led to a national outcry in the U.S. for greater fire safety in buildings.

==Implementation and usage==
By the end of the 20th century, most countries had [[building code|building codes (or regulations)]] which require all public buildings have a minimum number of [[fire exit|fire]] and [[emergency exit]]s. Crash bars are fitted to these types of doors because they are proven to save lives in the event of human [[stampede]]s. Panic can often occur during mass building evacuations caused by fires or explosions.

In the event emergency exits are required, the crash bar works efficiently to allow people to pass through security doors without a reduction in speed. A crash bar's fast-acting mechanism reduces the risk that a rushing crowd might suddenly become a [[logjam]] at the exits. Such a [[human stampede]] situation, which has [[List of human stampedes|many historical precedents]], can cause falls, crushing, and other injury because the rear of a crowd has no idea that the people at the front of a crowd have come across a door.
[[File:Set of Crash Bar Doors.jpg|thumb|A set of push bar doors with upper Pullman latches in a school.]]
Crash bars are typically found on doors which are required emergency exits serving a particular type or quantity of occupants. Common locations include doors which provide egress from assembly areas, doors which serve many occupants, or doors serving hazardous areas. For buildings subject to the [[International Building Code]], or a locally adopted variation, they are required for certain healthcare, education, or assembly spaces, generally related to the number of occupants exiting through a given door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2009 International Building Code|year=2009|publisher=International Code Council, Inc.|location=Country Club Hills, Illinois|isbn=978-1-58001-725-1|page=1008.1.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dogging ==
In some applications, such as storefront entrances, panic bars may be dogged during business hours. Dogging is a common feature on panic bars in which the bar is retracted with a key—freeing the door to swing without latching. This allows customers to apply force to any portion of the door, not just the bar, in order to open it.

Dogging is distinct from simple unlocking, which permits the user to open the door from both ends but still requires performing an action to release the latches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://us.allegion.com/irstdocs/article/009532.pdf|title=It’s a dog eat dog world. Ever wonder about the strange terminology we use for specific construction products, especially door hardware? Twisted, I know.|last=Gottwalt|first=T.J.|date=2013|website=Allegion Industry Insights|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in applications where the exterior side contains an immovable dummy lever, it is usually impossible to unlock the crash bar without also dogging it.

Dogging should be avoided in high wind areas where the door is susceptible to blowing open.

==Use around the world==

=== European Union ===
In the European Union, panic bars are governed by the standard ''EN 1125'', ''Panic exit devices operated by a horizontal bar''. As with other EN family standards, the English language version is produced by the British Standards Institution and utilizes the call sign BS EN 1125. Panic bars are required to conform to this standard in order to carry [[CE marking]] and thus be sold in the [[European Economic Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uniononline.co.uk/en/site/union-online/standards-and-legislation/bs-en-1125/|title=BS EN 1125 - Standards and Legislation - UNION – Door Handles, Door Locks, Door Hardware and much more|last=ABLOY|first=ASSA|website=www.uniononline.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.int-door-controls.co.uk/ccp51/media/downloads/pdf/Panic-Hardware-Brochure-07.pdf|title=Panic Hardware Brochure|last=Int Door Controls|first=|date=|website=www.int-door-controls.co.uk/ccp51/media/downloads/pdf/Panic-Hardware-Brochure-07.pdf|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the standard was updated to include an alpha-numeric labeling scheme. In this system, products are tested to various benchmarks and assigned a letter or number accordingly. Products must achieve minimum quality scores in order to receive general CE approval. The 9 rating categories are:
# Category of Use
# Number of Test Cycles
# Test Door Mass
# Fire Resistance
# Safety
# Corrosion Resistance
# Security
# Projection of device
# Type of device
# 
EN 1125 is one of two standards which govern exit devices in the EU. The other standard, EN 179, governs door handles, push pads, and other exit devices with emergency release functionality.

However, EN 179 devices shall only be used at locations where people "are familiar with the emergency exit and its hardware and therefore a panic situation is unlikely to appear". Examples of places where EN 179 hardware may be used in place of EN 1125 panic bars include small apartment buildings and offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allegion.com/content/dam/allegionuk/Literature/Information%20Sheets/K8389%20EN%20Classification%20and%20CE%20Marking%20Guide%20FINAL.pdf|title=Briton Exit Hardware Classifications Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The first panic bar, made by [[Von Duprin]], was available by 1908 in many models and configurations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zcgw09z1pAgC&amp;lpg=PA592&amp;ots=sNDwHbKoSR&amp;dq=Von%20Duprin%20Fire%20Exit%20Latch%20Company%22&amp;pg=PA592#v=onepage&amp;q=Von%20Duprin%20Fire%20Exit%20Latch%20Company%22&amp;f=false Sweet's Indexed Catalogue of Building Construction, 1909]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, building exit requirements are generally controlled by model codes such as the [[International Building Code]] and/or the [[National Fire Protection Association|NFPA]] [[Life Safety Code]]. Adoption of regulations varies by location and may occur at the city, county, or state level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iccsafe.org/gr/Documents/AdoptionToolkit/HowStatesAdopt_I-Codes.pdf|title=Code Adoption by State|last=|first=|date=|website=International Code Council|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Model codes are usually supplemented with amendments adopted locally. Additional requirements may be imposed on a site from an [[Authority Having Jurisdiction]] such as a local fire marshal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecmweb.com/nec/who-s-got-power|title=Who’s Got the Power?|website=ecmweb.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors considered when mandating exit devices include the number of occupants who would need to leave in an emergency, the availability of other nearby exits, and proximity to any hazards equipment or chemicals.

=== Differences in European vs North American design ===
[[File:Cross Bar Doors at Bottom of Stairs.jpg|thumb|233x233px|Doors with cross bar style panic bars]]
In Europe, it is notable that most panic bars are of the cross bar type, which are called Type A in the EN 1125 standard. This contrasts strongly with North American architectural design, which years ago switched to using predominantly touch bars (EN 1125 Type B) in new construction.

In Europe, the use of panic bars is generally confined to code required applications. On the other hand, in US and Canadian commercial building design panic bars are frequently used even when not required by code. This is because bars are seen as a simpler opening mechanism for users than a knob or lever handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://idighardware.com/2013/10/back-2-basics-panic-hardware/|title=I Dig Hardware » Back-2-Basics: Panic Hardware|website=idighardware.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the public generally prefers automatic door opening solutions to both these options, automatic doors can be costly to install and maintain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dashdoor.com/resource-center/technical-articles/automatic-door-maintenance/|title=Automatic Door Maintenance - Dash Door|date=2013-08-12|work=Dash Door|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal law}}

'''Criminal law''' is the body of [[law]] that relates to [[crime]]. It proscribes conduct perceived as threatening, harmful, or otherwise endangering to the [[property]], [[health]], [[safety]], and [[welfare|moral welfare]] of people inclusive of one's self. Most criminal law is established by [[statute]], which is to say that the laws are enacted by a [[legislature]]. Criminal law includes the [[punishment]] and [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] of people who violate such laws. Criminal law varies according to [[jurisdiction]], and differs from [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]], where emphasis is more on dispute resolution and victim compensation than on [[punishment]] or [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]]. Criminal procedure is a formalized official activity that authenticates the fact of commission of a crime and authorizes punitive or rehabilitative treatment of the [[offender]]. 

==History==
The first civilizations generally did not distinguish between [[Civil law (area)|civil law]] and criminal law. The first written codes of law were designed by the [[Sumer]]ians. Around 2100–2050 BC [[Ur-Nammu]], the [[Neo-Sumerian]] king of [[Ur]], enacted the oldest written legal code whose text has been discovered: the ''[[Code of Ur-Nammu]]''&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Samuel Noah. (1971) ''The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character,'' p.4, University of Chicago {{ISBN|0-226-45238-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; although an earlier code of [[Urukagina]] of [[Lagash]] ( 2380–2360 BC ) is also known to have existed. Another important early code was the [[Code Hammurabi]], which formed the core of [[Babylonian law]]. Only fragments of the early criminal laws of [[Ancient Greece]] have survived, e.g. those of [[Solon]] and [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mypolice.ca/research_and_publications/GreekRomanJurisprudence.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731194918/http://www.mypolice.ca/research_and_publications/GreekRomanJurisprudence.htm|title= Law and Order in Ancient Civilizations|first=James F. |last=Albrecht |location=St. John's University (NYC)|archivedate=July 31, 2009 |accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Old Bailey Microcosm edited.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.85|The [[Old Bailey]] in [[London]] (in 1808) was the venue for more than 100,000 criminal trials between 1674 and 1834, including all death penalty cases.]]
In [[Roman law]], [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]]'s ''Commentaries on the [[Twelve Tables]]'' also conflated the civil and criminal aspects, treating theft (''[[furtum]]'') as a [[tort]]. Assault and violent [[robbery]] were analogized to [[trespass]] as to property.  Breach of such laws created an obligation of law or ''vinculum juris'' discharged by payment of monetary compensation or [[damages]]. The criminal law of [[imperial Rome]] is collected in Books 47–48 of the [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabrit07chisrich#page/454/mode/2up Criminal Law]. [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]].&lt;/ref&gt; After the revival of Roman law in the 12th century, sixth-century Roman classifications and jurisprudence provided the foundations of the distinction between criminal and civil law in [[Europe]]an law from then until the present time.&lt;ref&gt;"Law, Criminal Procedure," ''Dictionary of the Middle Ages: Supplement 1'', New York: Charles Scribner's Sons-Thompson-Gale, 2004: 309–320&lt;/ref&gt;

The first signs of the modern distinction between crimes and civil matters emerged during the [[William the Conqueror|Norman Invasion]] of England.&lt;ref&gt;see, Pennington, Kenneth (1993) ''The Prince and the Law, 1200–1600: Sovereignty and Rights in the Western Legal Tradition,'' University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;  The special notion of criminal penalty, at least concerning Europe, arose in Spanish Late Scholasticism (see [[Alfonso de Castro]]), when the theological notion of God's penalty (poena aeterna) that was inflicted solely for a guilty mind, became transfused into canon law first and, finally, to secular criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Maihold, ''Strafe für fremde Schuld? Die Systematisierung des Strafbegriffs in der Spanischen Spätscholastik und Naturrechtslehre'', Köln u.a. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The development of the [[Sovereign state|state]] dispensing [[justice]] in a court clearly emerged in the eighteenth century when European countries began maintaining police services. From this point, criminal law had formalized the mechanisms for enforcement, which allowed for its development as a discernible entity.

==Objectives of criminal law==
Criminal law is distinctive for the uniquely serious potential consequences or [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]] for failure to abide by its rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781409427650 |author=Dennis J. Baker|title=The Right Not to be Criminalized: Demarcating Criminal Law's Authority|publisher=Ashgate|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every crime is composed of [[Element (criminal)|criminal elements]]. [[Capital punishment]] may be imposed in some jurisdictions for the most serious crimes. Physical or [[corporal punishment]] may be imposed such as [[Flagellation|whipping]] or [[caning]], although these punishments are prohibited in much of the world. Individuals may be [[incarcerated]] in [[prison]] or [[jail]] in a variety of conditions depending on the jurisdiction. Confinement may be solitary. Length of incarceration may vary from a day to life. Government supervision may be imposed, including [[house arrest]], and convicts may be required to conform to particularized guidelines as part of a [[parole]] or [[probation]] regimen. [[Fine (penalty)|Fines]] also may be imposed, seizing money or property from a person convicted of a crime.

Five objectives are widely accepted for enforcement of the criminal law by [[criminal punishment|punishments]]: [[Retributive justice|retribution]], [[deterrence (legal)|deterrence]], [[Incapacitation (penology)|incapacitation]], [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] and [[Restorative justice|restoration]]. Jurisdictions differ on the value to be placed on each.
			
*'''[[Retributive justice|Retribution]]''' – Criminals ought to ''Be Punished'' in some way. This is the most widely seen goal. Criminals have taken improper advantage, or inflicted unfair detriment, upon others and consequently, the criminal law will put criminals at some unpleasant disadvantage to "balance the scales." People submit to the law to receive the right not to be murdered and if people contravene these laws, they surrender the rights granted to them by the law. Thus, one who murders may be executed himself. A related theory includes the idea of "righting the balance."
*'''[[Deterrence (legal)|Deterrence]]''' – ''Individual'' deterrence is aimed toward the specific offender. The aim is to impose a sufficient penalty to discourage the offender from criminal behavior. ''General'' deterrence aims at society at large. By imposing a penalty on those who commit offenses, other individuals are discouraged from committing those offenses.
*'''[[Incapacitation (penology)|Incapacitation]]''' – Designed simply to keep criminals ''away'' from society so that the public is protected from their misconduct. This is often achieved through [[prison]] sentences today.  The [[death penalty]] or [[banishment]] have served the same purpose.
*'''[[Rehabilitation (penology)|Rehabilitation]]''' – Aims at transforming an offender into a valuable member of society. Its primary goal is to prevent further offense by convincing the offender that their conduct was wrong.
*'''[[Restorative justice|Restoration]]''' – This is a victim-oriented theory of punishment.  The goal is to repair, through state authority, any injury inflicted upon the victim by the offender. For example, one who [[embezzle]]s will be required to repay the amount improperly acquired. Restoration is commonly combined with other main goals of [[criminal justice]] and is closely related to concepts in the [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]], i.e., returning the victim to his or her original position before the injury.

==Selected criminal laws==
Many laws are enforced by threat of [[criminal punishment]], and the range of the punishment varies with the jurisdiction. The scope of criminal law is too vast to catalog intelligently. Nevertheless, the following are some of the more typical aspects of criminal law.

===Elements===
{{Main article|Element (criminal law)}}
The criminal law generally prohibits undesirable ''acts''.  Thus, proof of a crime requires proof of some act.  Scholars label this the requirement of an [[actus reus]] or ''guilty act''.  Some crimes – particularly modern regulatory offenses – require no more, and they are known as [[strict liability]] offenses (E.g. Under the ''Road traffic Act 1988'' it is a strict liability offence to drive a vehicle with an alcohol concentration above the prescribed limit).  Nevertheless, because of the potentially severe consequences of criminal conviction, judges at [[common law]] also sought proof of an ''intent'' to do some bad thing, the [[mens rea]] or ''guilty mind''.  As to crimes of which both ''actus reus'' and ''mens rea'' are requirements, judges have concluded that the elements must be present at precisely the same moment and it is not enough that they occurred sequentially at different times.&lt;ref&gt;This is demonstrated by ''R v. Church'' [1966] 1 QB 59. Mr. Church had a fight with a woman which rendered her unconscious. He attempted to revive her, but gave up, believing her to be dead. He threw her, still alive, in a nearby river, where she [[drown]]ed. The court held that Mr. Church was not guilty of murder (because he did not ever desire to kill her), but was guilty of [[manslaughter]]. The "chain of events," his act of throwing her into the water and his desire to hit her, coincided. In this manner, it does not matter when a guilty mind and act coincide, as long as at some point they do.  See also, ''Fagan v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner'' [1968] 3 All ER 442, where angry Mr Fagan would not take his car off a policeman's foot&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actus reus===

{{Main article|Actus reus}}
[[File:LCJ-Court-1886.jpg|right|thumb|An English court room in 1886, with [[Lord Chief Justice Coleridge]] presiding]]
''Actus reus'' is [[Latin]] for "'''guilty act'''" and is the physical element of committing a crime.  It may be accomplished by an action, by threat of action, or exceptionally, by an [[omission (criminal law)|omission]] to act, which is a legal duty to act. For example, the act of ''A'' striking ''B'' might suffice, or a parent's failure to give food to a young child also may provide the actus reus for a crime.

Where the actus reus is a ''failure'' to act, there must be a ''duty of care''. A duty can arise through [[contract]],&lt;ref&gt;''R v. Pittwood'' (1902) 19 TLR 37 – a railway worker who omitted to shut the crossing gates, convicted of manslaughter when someone was run over by a train&lt;/ref&gt; a voluntary undertaking,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the partner in ''Gibbons'' who was not a blood parent, but had assumed a duty of care&lt;/ref&gt; a blood relation with whom one lives,&lt;ref&gt;''R v. Stone and Dobinson'' [1977] QB 354, where an ill tended sister named Fanny could not leave bed, was not cared for at all and literally rotted in her own filth. This is [[gross negligence]] [[manslaughter]].&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally through one's official position.&lt;ref&gt;''R v. Dytham'' [1979] QB 722, where a policeman on duty stood and watched three men kick another to death.&lt;/ref&gt;  Duty also can arise from one's own creation of a dangerous situation.&lt;ref&gt;''R v. Miller'' [1983] 1 All ER 978, a squatter flicked away a still lit [[cigarette]], which landed on a [[mattress]]. He failed to take action, and after the building had burned down, he was convicted of [[arson]]. He failed to correct the dangerous situation he created, as he was duty bound to do.  See also, ''R v. Santana-Bermudez'' (2003) where a thug with a needle failed to tell a policewoman searching his pockets that he had one.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it was held in the U.K. that switching off the life support of someone in a [[persistent vegetative state]] is an omission to act and not criminal. Since discontinuation of power is not a voluntary act, not grossly negligent, and is in the patient's best interests, no crime takes place.&lt;ref&gt;''Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland'' [1993] 1 All ER 821&lt;/ref&gt; In this case it was held that since a PVS patient could not give or withhold consent to medical treatment, it was for the doctors to decide whether treatment was in the patient's best interest. It was reasonable for them to conclude that treatment was not in the patient's best interest, and should therefore be stopped, when there was no prospect of improvement. It was never lawful to take active steps to cause or accelerate death, although in certain circumstances it was lawful to withhold life sustaining treatment, including feeding, without which the patient would die.

An actus reus may be nullified by an absence of [[Causation (law)|causation]].  For example, a crime involves harm to a person, the person's action must be the ''[[But for test|but for]]'' cause and ''[[proximate cause]]'' of the harm.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''R v. Pagett'' [1983] Crim LR 393, where ''''but for'''' the defendant using his pregnant girlfriend for a [[human shield]] from police fire, she would not have died.  Pagget's conduct foreseeably procured the heavy police response.&lt;/ref&gt; If more than one cause exists (e.g. harm comes at the hands of more than one culprit) the act must have "more than a slight or trifling link" to the harm.&lt;ref&gt;''R v. Kimsey'' [1996] Crim LR 35, where 2 girls were racing their cars dangerously and crashed. One died, but the other was found slightly at fault for her death and convicted.&lt;/ref&gt;

Causation is not broken simply because a victim is particularly vulnerable.  This is known as the [[thin skull rule]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[R v. Blaue]]'' [1975] where a Jehovah's witness (who refuse blood transfusions on religious grounds) was stabbed and without accepting life saving treatment died.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may be broken by an intervening act (''novus actus interveniens'') of a third party, the victim's own conduct,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''R v. Williams'' [1992] Crim LR 198 where a hitchhiker who jumped from a car and died, apparently because the driver tried to steal his wallet, was a "daft" intervening act. c.f. ''R v. Roberts'' [1972] Crim LR 27, where a girl getting drunk jumped from a speeding car to avoid sexual advances and was injured and ''R v. Majoram'' [2000] Crim LR 372 where thugs kicked in the victims door scared him to jumping from the window. These actions were '''foreseeable and therefore creating liability for injuries'''.&lt;/ref&gt; or another unpredictable event. A mistake in [[Medicine|medical]] treatment typically will not sever the chain, unless the mistakes are in themselves "so potent in causing death."&lt;ref&gt;per [[Roy Beldam|Beldam LJ]], ''R v. Cheshire'' [1991] 3 All ER 670; see also, ''R v. Jordan'' [1956] 40 Cr App R 152, where a stab victim recovering well in hospital was given an antibiotic. The victim was allergic, but he was given it the next day too, and died. The hospital's actions intervened and pardoned the defendant through condemning themselves instead.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mens rea===

{{Main article|Mens rea}}
''Mens rea'' is another [[Latin]] phrase, meaning "guilty mind". This is the mental element of the crime.  A guilty mind means an [[Intention in English law|intention]] to commit some wrongful act. Intention under criminal law is separate from a person's [[Motive (law)|motive]]&lt;ref&gt;''R v. Mohan'' [1975] 2 All ER 193, intention defined as "a decision to bring about&amp;nbsp;... [the ''actus reus''] no matter whether the accused desired that consequence of his act or not."&lt;/ref&gt; (although motive does not exist in Scots law).&lt;ref&gt;see https://archive.org/stream/cu31924024627675#page/n5/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;

A lower threshold of ''mens rea'' is satisfied when a defendant recognizes an act is dangerous but decides to commit it anyway. This is [[Recklessness (law)|recklessness]]. It is the mental state of mind of the person at the time the actus reus was committed. For instance, if ''C'' tears a gas meter from a wall to get the money inside, and knows this will let flammable gas escape into a neighbour's house, he could be liable for poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. ''R v. Cunningham'' [1957] 2 All ER 863, where the defendant did not realise, and was not liable; also ''R v. G and Another'' [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldjudgmt/jd031016/g-1.htm [2003&amp;#93; UKHL 50]&lt;/ref&gt; Courts often consider whether the actor did recognize the danger, or alternatively ought to have recognized a risk.&lt;ref&gt;previously in the U.K. under ''Metropolitan Police Commissioner v. Caldwell'' [1981] 1 All ER 961&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, a requirement only that one ''ought'' to have recognized a danger (though he did not) is tantamount to erasing ''intent'' as a requirement. In this way, the importance of [[mens rea]] has been reduced in some areas of the criminal law but is obviously still an important part in the criminal system.

Wrongfulness of intent also may vary the seriousness of an offense and possibly reduce the punishment but this is not always the case.  A killing committed with specific intent to kill or with conscious recognition that [[death]] or [[Grievous bodily harm|serious bodily harm]] will result, would be murder, whereas a killing effected by reckless acts lacking such a consciousness could be manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;''R v. Woolin'' [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldjudgmt/jd980722/wool.htm [1998&amp;#93; 4 All ER 103]&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, it matters not who is actually harmed through a defendant's actions. The doctrine of [[transferred intent|transferred malice]] means, for instance, that if a man intends to strike a person with his belt, but the belt bounces off and hits another, mens rea is transferred from the intended target to the person who actually was struck.[Note: The notion of transferred intent does not exist within Scots' Law. In Scotland, one would not be charged with assault due to transferred intent, but instead assault due to recklessness.] &lt;ref&gt;''R v. Latimer'' (1886) 17 QBD 359; though for an entirely different offense, e.g. breaking a window, one cannot transfer malice, see ''R v. Pembliton'' (1874) LR 2 CCR 119&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strict liability===

{{Main article|Strict liability}}

Strict liability can be described as criminal or civil liability notwithstanding the lack mens rea or intent by the defendant.  Not all crimes require specific intent, and the threshold of culpability required may be reduced or demoted. For example, it might be sufficient to show that a defendant acted [[negligence|negligently]], rather than [[intention (criminal law)|intentionally]] or [[recklessness (law)|recklessly]]. In offenses of [[absolute liability]], other than the prohibited act, it may not be necessary to show the act was intentional. Generally, crimes must include an intentional act, and "intent" is an element that must be proved in order to find a crime occurred.  The idea of a "strict liability crime" is an oxymoron.  The few exceptions are not truly crimes at all – but are administrative regulations and civil penalties created by statute, such as crimes against the traffic or highway code.

===Fatal offenses===
{{Main article|Murder|Culpable homicide}}
A ''murder'', defined broadly, is an unlawful killing.  Unlawful killing is probably the act most frequently targeted by the criminal law.  In many [[jurisdictions]], the crime of murder is divided into various gradations of severity, e.g., murder in the ''first degree'', based on ''intent''.  ''[[Malice (law)|Malice]]'' is a required element of murder.  Manslaughter (Culpable Homicide in Scotland) is a lesser variety of killing committed in the absence of ''malice'', brought about by reasonable [[Provocation (legal)|provocation]], or [[diminished capacity]]. [[Involuntary manslaughter|''Involuntary'' manslaughter]], where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent, recklessness.

[[Settled insanity]] is a possible defense.

===Personal offenses===
{{Main article|Assault|Battery (crime)|Rape|Sexual abuse}}
Many criminal codes protect the physical integrity of the body.  The crime of [[battery (crime)|battery]] is traditionally understood as an unlawful touching, although this does not include everyday knocks and jolts to which people silently consent as the result of presence in a crowd.  Creating a fear of imminent battery is an [[assault]], and also may give rise to criminal liability.  Non-consensual [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]], or [[rape]], is a particularly egregious form of battery.

===Property offenses===
{{Main article|Criminal damage|Criminal trespass|Theft|Robbery|Extortion|Dacoity|Burglary|Fraud}}
Property often is protected by the criminal law.  [[Trespass]]ing is unlawful entry onto the real property of another.  Many criminal codes provide penalties for [[Criminal conversion|conversion]], [[embezzlement]], [[theft]], all of which involve deprivations of the value of the property.  [[Robbery]] is a theft by force. [[Fraud]] in the UK is a breach of the Fraud Act 2006 by false representation, by failure to disclose information or by abuse of position.

===Participatory offenses===
{{Main article|Accomplice|Aid and abet|Inchoate offenses}}
Some criminal codes criminalize association with a criminal venture or involvement in criminality that does not actually come to fruition.  Some examples are aiding, abetting, [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], and attempt. However, in Scotland, the English concept of '''Aiding and Abetting''' is known as '''Art and Part Liability'''. See Glanville Williams, Textbook of Criminal Law, (London: Stevens &amp; Sons, 1983); Glanville Williams, Criminal Law the General Part (London: Stevens &amp; Sons, 1961).

===Mala in se v. mala prohibita       ===
While crimes are typically broken into degrees or classes to punish appropriately, all offenses can be divided into 'mala in se' and 'mala prohibita' laws.  Both are Latin legal terms, '''mala in se''' meaning crimes that are thought to be inherently evil or morally wrong, and thus will be widely regarded as crimes regardless of jurisdiction.  Mala in se offenses are felonies, property crimes, immoral acts and corrupt acts by public officials.  '''Mala prohibita''', on the other hand, refers to offenses that do not have wrongfulness associated with them.  Parking in a restricted area, driving the wrong way down a one-way street, jaywalking or unlicensed fishing are examples of acts that are prohibited by statute, but without which are not considered wrong.  Mala prohibita statutes are usually imposed strictly, as there does not need to be mens rea component for punishment under those offenses, just the act itself.  For this reason, it can be argued that offenses that are mala prohibita are not really crimes at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkins|first=Rollin M.|title=Criminal Law, 3rd ed|year=1982|publisher=The Foundation Press, Inc.|isbn=0-88277-067-5|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public international law]] deals extensively and increasingly with criminal conduct that is heinous and ghastly enough to affect entire societies and regions. The formative source of modern international criminal law was the [[Nuremberg trials]] following the [[Second World War]] in which the leaders of [[Nazism]] were prosecuted for their part in [[genocide]] and atrocities across [[Europe]]. The Nuremberg trials marked the beginning of criminal fault for individuals, where individuals acting on behalf of a government can be tried for violations of international law without the benefit of sovereign immunity. In 1998 an [[International criminal court]] was established in the Rome Statute.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=

'''''Curley v. NAMBLA''''' was a [[wrongful death]] lawsuit filed in the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]] in 2000, by Barbara and Robert Curley against the [[North American Man/Boy Love Association]] (NAMBLA), saying the organization had incited the men who kidnapped and murdered their young son. They sought $200 million in damages.

The [[American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts]] (ACLU-M) represented NAMBLA because of the issue of censorship of unpopular speech about sexuality. It succeeded on getting the suit dismissed, based on the specific legal issue that NAMBLA is organized as an association, not a corporation.&lt;ref name="NR"&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/murdock/murdock200402270920.asp Deroy Murdock on ACLU &amp; NAMBLA on National Review Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050417135904/http://www.nationalreview.com/murdock/murdock200402270920.asp |date=April 17, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Curleys continued their suit against individual members of NAMBLA and its steering committee members. They finally dropped the lawsuit in 2008 because the court ruled that their only witness to incitement was not competent to testify. Soon after his son's murder, Curley had campaigned for the state to pass a bill to re-establish use of the death penalty, but he changed his position and in 2007 opposed it.

==Background==
In 1997, Barbara and Robert Curley's 10-year-old son Jeffrey was kidnapped, raped and murdered by two men, Salvatore Sicari, 21, and Charlie Jaynes, 22.&lt;ref name="Louis B. Schlesinger, page 26"&gt;Louis B. Schlesinger, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey was a [[latchkey child]] and knew Sicari from the neighborhood, as he lived only a block away. The two men befriended Jeffrey, taking him on car rides to diners.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; They offered to replace his recently stolen bicycle with a new one in exchange for sex. When Jeffrey refused, Jaynes killed him in the car's backseat.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; Sicari confessed to his part in the murder but insisted that Jaynes committed the murder.

Following his son's murder, Robert Curley campaigned for Massachusetts to reinstate the [[death penalty]], which had been ruled unconstitutional in 1975. A bill to do so failed on a tie vote in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] shortly after his son's murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Klein|first=Rick|title=Decision expected to fuel capital punishment drive|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2003/12/24/decision_expected_to_fuel_capital_punishment_drive/ |accessdate=February 21, 2014|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=December 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later changed his position and in 2007 opposed death penalty legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LeBlanc |first=Steve |title=Death penalty bill faces a battle|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/10/24/death_penalty_bill_faces_a_battle/ |accessdate=February 21, 2014|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=October 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
The Curleys filed a civil suit against NAMBLA in 2000, seeking $200 million in damages.&lt;ref name=globesue/&gt; It charged that NAMBLA's "adult-child sexual relationship" propaganda, including Jaynes' viewing of the group's website, caused his violent predatory behavior and urge to have sex with and rape young male children.&lt;ref name=kaminer/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; 

The suit was based on the fact that the convicted murderer had NAMBLA materials and had been found to have visited the group's website. The ACLU said that the suit against NAMBLA highlighted censorship of unpopular speech about sexuality. According to [[Wendy Kaminer]], a longtime ACLU executive, the case was based on  "widespread biases about a supposed link between homosexuality and [[pedophilia]]"; in fact, studies have shown that children are more likely to be preyed upon by heterosexuals in their [[extended families]].&lt;ref name=kaminer&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaminer |first=Wendy |title=Free for All: Defending Liberty in America Today|year=2002|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston |pages=77–80 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2_y4aP6lkAC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|title=Rights and Wrongs|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0101/07/impc.00.html|accessdate=February 21, 2014|newspaper=CNN|date=January 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Proving the incitement is difficult given the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] standards that govern words in any medium.&lt;ref name="Robert M. O'Neil, page 73"&gt;Robert M. O'Neil, page 73.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the Internet was much less popular, so the point rested on the court's viewing the Internet as such a different media as to warrant a different legal standard.&lt;ref name="Robert M. O'Neil, page 73"/&gt; Despite the lawsuit's claims, the NAMBLA website displayed no erotica, nor conspiracies to rape or incitements to violence.&lt;ref name=kaminer/&gt; 

In ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|395|444|1969}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] held that government cannot punish inflammatory speech unless it is directed to inciting and likely to incite [[imminent lawless action]]. In September 2001, the court declined the defense's request for [[summary judgment]], because Brandenburg "does not foreclose liability 'on any set of facts that might be shown'" as to incitement just by NAMBLA's publications, meetings and website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perle|first1=E. Gabriel|last2=Williams|first2=John Taylor|title=Perle and Williams on Publishing Law, vol. I|publisher=Aspen Publishers|pages=8–13 note 61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6je0tPcGMzYC&amp;pg=SA8-PA13&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the court dismissed the suit based on the specific legal issue that NAMBLA is organized as an association, not a corporation.&lt;ref name="NR"/&gt;

The Curleys continued the suit as a wrongful death action against individual NAMBLA members and NAMBLA Steering Committee members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pacer.mad.uscourts.gov/dc/opinions/otoole/pdf/curley%20mem%20ord%20mot%20to%20dism.pdf US District Court of Massachusetts, ''Curley v.

The Curleys dropped the lawsuit in 2008. They had only one witness prepared to testify that NAMBLA somehow incited one of the convicted criminals in the murder of their son, and the judge ruled the witness was not [[Competence (law)|competent]] to testify. Robert Curley said, "That was the only link we were counting on ... When they ruled that out, that was the end of the line."&lt;ref name=drops&gt;{{cite news|last=Saltzman|first=Jonathan|title=Curley family drops case against NAMBLA|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2008/04/curley_family_d.html{{dl|date=April 2015}}|accessdate=February 21, 2014|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=April 23, 2008}} See http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/04/24/parents_of_slain_boy_drop_lawsuit_against_nambla/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
The publicity around this case contributed to the gay community's disassociation from NAMBLA and from any appearance of supporting pederasty (attraction to [[adolescents]] after youths enter [[puberty]]) and pedophilia (attraction to prepubescent children). This division was already present in NAMBLA, related to their public image and publication(s) content.&lt;ref&gt;Benoit Denizet-Lewis, pp. 164-175.&lt;/ref&gt; 

NAMBLA had been the subject of several law enforcement sting operations and raids. It had also been accused of links in several high-profile child abduction cases, such as the 1979 [[Etan Patz]] case in New York City.&lt;ref name="Philip Jenkins, pages 157-163"&gt;Philip Jenkins, pages 157-163&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, Pedro Hernandez, a clerk in a local [[convenience store|bodega]] in 1979, was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of Patz, based on confessions to police. He is said to have a low IQ and mental health issues.&lt;ref name="nytpatz"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/nyregion/etan-patz-pedro-hernandez-guilty.html?_r=0 RICK ROJAS, "Pedro Hernandez Found Guilty of Kidnapping and Killing Etan Patz in 1979"], ''New York Times'', 14 February 2017; accessed 27 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

NAMBLA denied any connections to crimes, but their public image was already permanently damaged. The gay community cut all ties of support.&lt;ref name="Philip Jenkins, pages 157-163"/&gt;

The '''Declaration of Principles on Equality''' reflects a moral and professional consensus among [[human rights]] and [[Egalitarianism|equality]] experts done in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Petrova, D., ‘The Declaration of Principles on Equality: A Contribution to International Human Rights Law’, Equal Rights Review, Volume 2, December 2008, pp58-72.&lt;/ref&gt; It contains 27 principles that establish a new [[paradigm]] on equality, drawing on established and emerging principles of [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;Declaration of Principles of Equality, Equal Rights Trust, October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described by the High Court of Delhi as reflecting the ‘current international understanding of Principles on Equality.’&lt;ref&gt;Naz Foundation v. Government of NCT of Delhi and Others, WP(C) No.7455/2001 at 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The need to formulate general [[Legal doctrine|legal principles]] on equality was defined on the basis of (i) acknowledging the pervasiveness of [[discrimination]] and the weaknesses in the protection of the right to equality at both international and national levels, (ii) the absence of comprehensive equality legislation in many countries around the world and the recognition that such legislation is necessary to give effect to states’ obligations under [[international human rights law|international]] and [[regional human rights regimes|regional human rights law]]; (iii) the disparities and inconsistencies in approaches to discrimination and equality in the different frameworks of the UN, EU, the Council of Europe, various national jurisdictions, etc. which meant that virtually none of the key concepts of equality law had universally accepted definitions; (iv) the fragmentation of the [[anti-discrimination law|anti-discrimination]] struggle, whereby different status/identity groups are enmeshed in [[identity politics]] and are unable to follow a universal human rights approach to equality and develop [[solidarity]] with other [[disadvantaged]] groups.

The Principles on Equality were agreed by a group of experts in several stages of consultations. They were discussed at a conference entitled ‘Principles on Equality and the Development of Legal Standards on Equality’ organised by The Equal Rights Trust (ERT) on 3–5 April 2008 in London. Participants of different backgrounds, including academics, legal practitioners and [[human rights activist]]s from all regions of the world took part in this event. Participants debated a version of the draft that had incorporated their comments on an earlier document. They subsequently contributed comments. A number of further experts participated in various stages of drafting and deliberation.

ERT launched the Declaration of Principles on Equality on 21 October 2008, in London. The document was signed initially by 128 experts from 44 countries, and subsequently by hundreds of others. It establishes, for the first time, general legal principles on equality as a basic human right. The Declaration contains 27 principles on which national equality legislation and policies should be based. The principles formulated and agreed by the experts through a two-year-long consultative process are based on concepts and jurisprudence developed in international, regional and national legal contexts. The Declaration is intended to assist efforts of legislators, the judiciary, civil society organisations and anyone else involved in combating discrimination and promoting equality, in particular through developing effective equality legislation and policies.

The legal basis of the 27 Principles is found (i) in the [[United Nations Charter|Charter of the United Nations]]&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Charter, 1 UNTS XVI, entered into force 24 October 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; which recognises the inherent dignity and worth and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family as the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world; (ii) Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;Universal Declaration on Human Rights, General Assembly resolution 217 A (III), 10 December 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; proclaiming that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights; and common Article 2 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 999 U.N.T.S. 171, entered into force 23 March 1976&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]];&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 993 U.N.T.S. 3, entered into force 3 Jan 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; (iii) the recognition, in Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, of the right to non-discrimination as an autonomous human right and the correlative obligation of States to realise this right; (iv) a number of provisions in international and regional treaties; (v) non-binding opinions, recommendations, and interpretations by organs of international and regional organisation including the Council of Europe; (vi) jurisprudence of international, regional and national courts related to equality.

==Principles==
Marking a transition from identity politics to a unitary human rights framework on equality, 
the Declaration provides guidance on some of the most complex and controversial issues that arise in any attempt to develop comprehensive equality legislation at the national level. For example, it defines the [[equality before the law|right to equality]], equal treatment, and the right to non-discrimination, and gives a legal definition of [[discrimination]], as well as of the most important types of discrimination (direct, indirect, harassment, discrimination by association and by perception); through these, it provides guidance on the question of how the right to non-discrimination relates to the right to equality. The Declaration also provides general principles on how to approach the question of the grounds on which discrimination must be prohibited: should the right to non-discrimination apply only to a closed list of grounds? Are new grounds emerging that should require equal pro-tection? Is there a hierarchy of the ground of discrimination, and what should be the approach to defining exceptions?

Having taken account of the existing notions of affirmative action, positive action, special measures and positive measures in various legal frameworks, the Declaration further formulates principles on which to base the law on positive action and positive duties. Positive action does not constitute discrimination as long as the difference in treatment is aimed at achieving full and effective equality and the means adopted are proportionate to that aim. Positive ac¬tion measures are not defined as an exception to the principle of equal treatment but as part of its implementation. States have a positive duty to promote equality.

The definition of the right to non-discrimination in Principle 4 as a free-standing right is meant in two senses: (i) in the sense that it is a separate right, which can be violated even if a related right is not: for example, a person’s right to non-discrimination in the enjoyment of the right to education may be violated, while no breach of her right to education has been found; this understanding is well established in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human rights; (ii) in the sense of an autonomous right, not related to any other right set forth by law. In this second sense, the free-standing status of the right to non-discrimination means that this right does not depend on whether another legal right actually exists. This is the approach followed in defining discrimination in the European Union equality Directives, as well as in the national legislation of a number of the EU member states.

The Declaration further contains principles on equality related to: the relationship between discrimination and violence; the scope of application of the right to equality (“all areas of activity regulated by law”); the personal scope: who are the right-holders, e.g. whether legal persons can claim the right as well as individuals and groups; the definition of duty-bearers; the content of the duty to give effect to the right to equality; the obligations regarding multiple discrimination; the duty of accommodating difference (defining the concept of reasonable accommodation); the relationship between the right to equality and poverty; the specificity of equality legislation; the duty to ensure participation in developing law and policies implementing the right to equality; and the duty to provide education related to equality.

Another set of principles are related to enforcement of the right to equality and define access to justice in equality law; victimisation; standing rules; evidence and proof in adjudicating equality rights; remedies and sanctions; the role of specialised bodies; and the duty to gather and disseminate information including statistics as part of the enforcement of the right to equality. Finally, the Declaration contains principles prohibiting regressive interpretation and derogations from the right to equality.

==Limitations==
The Declaration of Principles on Equality, as its title indicates, provides only the most general and abstract synthesis of legal standards on equality. Those who would be looking for more detailed guidance on specific issues would be disappointed. But the Declaration’s significance consists in the fact that it documents a degree of moral and professional consensus among global experts at the most fundamental level, reflecting both basic values shared by the signatories and a negotiated agreement on exactly how to express these values in the form and the language of universal legal principles. As an established common ground, the Declaration can therefore serve as the basis for further elaboration of specific legal standards related to equality issues.

==Recent developments==
On 25 November 2011, the Standing Committee of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE) adopted a [http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/Doc/ATListingDetails_E.asp?ATID=11380 Resolution and a Recommendation on “The Declaration of Principles on Equality and the Activities of the Council of Europe”] at its meeting in Edinburgh, UK, welcoming and endorsing the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;REC 1986 (2011) 25/11/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Resolution, for the adoption of which a simple majority was necessary, and the Recommendation, which required a qualified majority of two thirds, were voted on during the session of the Standing Committee under the UK Chairmanship of the Council of Europe in Edinburgh. The Standing Committee acts on behalf of PACE when the latter is not in session, and its Resolutions and Recommendations have identical legal status with those of the full assembly.

In the Resolution, the Parliamentary Assembly welcomes the Declaration of Principles on Equality and “calls on member states to take into account the principles contained in the Declaration when adopting equality and non-discrimination legislation and policies”.

In the Recommendation, which is addressed to the [[Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe|Committee of Ministers]], the highest executive authority of the Council of Europe:

“1. Referring to its Resolution on the Declaration of Principles on Equality and activities of the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly recommends that the Committee of Ministers:

1.1. enhance efforts aimed at speeding up ratification of Protocol No. 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights (ETS No. 5) by the members states which have not yet done so;

1.2. disseminate information on good practices in the implementation of policies aimed at combating discrimination and inequalities;

1.3. ensure that the Declaration is taken into account in the work of the different Council of Europe bodies and expert groups dealing with the issues of equality and non-discrimination;

1.4. promote the Declaration in its dealings with external actors, and in particular with policymakers from the Council of Europe member states;

2. Moreover, recalling the necessity of harmonising the interpretation and implementation of the rights to equality and non-discrimination, the Assembly recommends that the Committee of Ministers:

2.1. step up co-operation with the European Union on the consolidation of standards in the area of non-discrimination and promotion of equality;

2.2. pursue co-operation with other international organisations, in particular the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the United Nations and its Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, with a view to achieving coherent interpretations of the principles of equality and non-discrimination and the implementation of common policies in the field of combating discrimination and inequalities.”

The Resolution and Recommendation were proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights (CLAHR), whose member Boriss Cilevics (Latvia) was the Rapporteur on the matter. The position of the CLAHR, which was adopted in June 2011 in Oslo, was preceded by a hearing held in Paris on 8 March 2011, at which The Equal Rights Trust provided testimony. The Recommendation will now progress to the Committee of Ministers which should consider a response.

'''ECOWEEK''' ''Εβδομάδα Οικολογίας'' (Greek) is a private non-profit, non-governmental international organization aiming towards the empowerment, networking, education and training of young professionals - architects, designers, engineers, landscape architects - towards sustainable urban and public interventions and facilitation of action through fieldwork, workshops, education and training and through cooperation with local authorities, organizations and leaders.

== Mission ==
ECOWEEK mission is to raise environmental awareness and awareness on [[climate change]] and to promote the principles of [[sustainability]].

== History ==
ECOWEEK was initially established in Aegina, Greece in 2005. It was initially conceived as a community event - ''Ecological Week in Aegina'' - to raise environmental awareness of the local community of 14,000. At the time Aegina was challenged by unresolved waste management,&lt;ref&gt;Ζουμπουλάκης, Γ. (7-08-2005). ''Χωρίς νερό αλλά με σκουπίδια - Αίγινα''. ΤΟ ΒΗΜΑ - http://www.tovima.gr/relatedarticles/article/?aid=167683&lt;/ref&gt; illegal burning of waste, inexistant waste recycling program, water shortages,&lt;ref&gt;Χριστοδουλίδου, Π. (9-08-2005). ''Άρχισε ξανά η μεταφορά νερού στην Αίγινα''. ΤΟ ΕΘΝΟΣ - http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22733&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=11058&lt;/ref&gt; energy shortages, and a thriving and partially unregulated spec construction market for summer houses, which although contributed to the local economy, it put pressure in protected areas to be developed and constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Petropoulos, Thracy. (1-06-2007). ''Concrete plans unsettled''. ATHENS NEWS - http://www.aeginagreece.com/main/aegina_eco/cementfactory.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Construction also contributed in increasing illegal disposal of construction waste in natural reserves, and the increase of the summer population thus bringing the capacity of the existing infrastructures of the island to its limits.

Ecological Week in Aegina was held in Aegina for 2 years. In 2007, responding to an increase demand for environmental awareness beyond Aegina, ECOWEEK co-organized activity throughout Greece, and initiated free-admission screenings of award-winning documentary on Climate Change by Davis Guggenheim ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' with [[Al Gore]] in schools, the army, and public screenings in Athens, Thessaloniki, Patras, Lamia, Corfu, and Crete. Within this activity, in June 2007, ECOWEEK held a public free-admission keynote lecture and slide show on Climate Change by inviting Al Gore&lt;ref&gt;Πολιτισμός. (22-5-2007). ''Ο Αλ Γκορ στο Μέγαρο Μουσικής''. ΤΟ ΕΘΝΟΣ - http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22784&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=110309&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Athens Concert Hall]]. In 2007 ECOWEEK was also established in Jerusalem, Israel and in 2008 ECOWEEK initiated the first Ecological Week in [[Larnaka]], [[Cyprus]], in cooperation with the Municipality of Larnaka], involving schools, universities, professional organizations, and the general public.

== Programs ==
Since 2005, ECOWEEK developed its outreach activity towards raising awareness to a variety of population groups, age-groups and interests. For example, from children activity, cleaning of beaches, lottery of composters and solar chargers, to academic and colloquial lectures, site visits, design workshops, and film screenings.
Since 2008, ECOWEEK activity focuses more on sustainable design and ecological building, social design,and [[placemaking]]. Its activity involved primarily one-week-long design workshops and international conferences for young and established professionals - primarily architects, designers, landscape architects and engineers. ECOWEEK has developed and expanded its activity through close collaboration with cultural institutions, such as the [[American Institute of Architects]] Continental Europe, the [[British Council]], [[Goethe Institute]], academic institutions, municipalities and governments. ECOWEEK has initiated and organized activities in [[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Ag. Nikolaos]] ([[Crete]]), [[Athens]], [[Bethany (biblical village)|Azaryia]] ([[Bethany (biblical village)|Bethany]]), [[Belgrade]], [[Bucharest]], [[Cairns]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Istanbul]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Kraków]], [[London]], [[Milan]]o, [[Mumbai]], [[Sarajevo]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Tilburg]], [[Pristina|Prishtina]], and [[Rome]].

In 2017 ECOWEEK published its first book titled [http://ecoweekbook.org/ ECOWEEK Book#1: 50 Voices for Sustainability], featuring fifty articles by leading architects,designers, professionals, academics and environmentalists from around the world. Among them award-winning architects [[Kengo Kuma]], [[Bjarke Ingels|BIG]], [[MVRDV]], [[Françoise-Hélène Jourda|Francoise-Helene Jourda]], [[Diébédo Francis Kéré|Diebedo Francis Kere]], [[Michael Sorkin]], Prof. David Orr and Antarctica explorer [[Robert Swan]]. The same year ECOWEEK also issued [https://issuu.com/ecoweek/docs/ecoweek_catalogue_2016 ECOWEEK: The Workshops] a publication with a collection of ideas and projects from the ECOWEEK workshops (2009-2016).

== Hassan Fathy ==
In 1989 ECOWEEK co-founder architect Elias Messinas met the late Egyptian architect [[Hassan Fathy]] - author of [[Architecture for the Poor]] - in [[Cairo]]. In that meeting, Fathy conveyed to Messinas how problems in Egypt - among them housing for the poor - could be solved. Among others Fathy challenged Messinas when he emphasized the need for young professionals to be more aware of their own community and instead of imitating architecture in international magazines, to reach out, learn about and be creative while benefiting with their work their own community.

Inspired by Fathy, ECOWEEK workshops have gradually developed a more hands-on approach that links between acedemia and the community, and between professionals and students since 2010. Aiming to both empower and train young professionals to address urban public space, placemaking, urban communities through interventions in design and hands-on workshops in urban public context, ECOWEEK and its partners have developed a model of close collaboration with local authorities, local organizations and leaders. Through this collaboration, the ECOWEEK workshops are assigned projects that are real, support them with professional consultants and see that some of the projects are implemented. Students' ideas are heard and cities, neighborhoods and communities benefit from the innovative and creative ideas of students and the professional guidance of the workshop leaders.

[[File:Ecoweek greenhouse.jpg|thumb|right]]
Aiming to establish a permanent platform and not just one-week-long activity, ECOWEEK established the GREENHOUSE in 2011 in Athens, Greece. The GREENHOUSE is a platform for innovation and entrepreneurship for society and the environment, engaging young architects, designers, landscape architects and students in real design assignments for real non-profit organizations and local authorities. The GREENHOUSE teams, under the guidance of experienced professionals, have developed sustainable solutions for schools, community centers, [https://ecoweekorg.wixsite.com/ghath2017 welfare institutions] and the urban public space in Athens and Thessaloniki in Greece and Holon,&lt;ref&gt;(20-05-2013).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12985">The '''Edict of Toleration''' took place during the process referred to as the [[Eastern Question]] in relations between European powers, Britain in particular, and the [[Ottoman Empire]] in its development at a time referred to as [[Tanzimat]] internally which included other initiatives like ending the [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman slave trade]] a few years later but overall as part of the [[Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] – a process that continued into the 1920s. It was largely a result of pressure from the British government on the [[Sublime Porte]], [[Abdülmecid I]] of the Ottomans, urging to stop the persecutions of the Christians, and eventually had an effect on the persecutions of Jews,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} continuing effects such as the earlier [[Damascus affair]]. It is one of the [[Edict of toleration|edicts of toleration]] of history.

Tanzimat was an Ottoman reform process that sought equal protections under the law in Ottoman lands for all people; however, it did not address matters of religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| first =Selim | last = Deringil | editor-last =Michael| editor-first =Michalis N. | editor2-last =Anastassiades | editor2-first =Tassos | editor-last3 = Verdeil| editor-first3 =Chantal | title =Re-configuring Ottoman citizenship in the Tanzimat state: conversion, religion and identity politics in the late Ottoman Empire(abstract | booktitle =Religious community and modern statehood: The passage from the Ottoman Empire to modern state | page =  5 | publisher = University of Cyprus, Department of Turkish and Middle Eastern Studies | date =October 2010 | location = Nicosia, Cyrpus | url =http://www.ucy.ac.cy/tms/documents/tms/sinedria/Conf.29.10.10_Programme.pdf | accessdate = December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular incident in 1843 with an Armenian Ottoman subject sparked an incident in August which gained international entanglements and then a Greek national in November, both of whom were put to death - the process of which became the Edict in March 1844.&lt;ref name="Subsi"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Subsi | first = Turgut | title =The apostasy question in the context of Anglo-Ottoman relations, 1843-44. | journal =Middle Eastern Studies | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = Frank Cass &amp; Company Ltd.  | date =April 1, 2002 | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-112247877.html | accessdate = December 11, 2013}}{{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reverend [[Edward Bickersteth (priest)|Edward Bickersteth]] referred to these developments in 1844 when he summarized diplomatic notes&lt;ref name="Bickersteth"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Bickersteth|authorlink=Edward Bickersteth (priest)|title=A practical guide to the Prophecies, with reference to their interpretation and fulfilment, and to personal edification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wFOAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA223|year=1844|publisher=Seeley, Burnside, and Seeley|pages=221–23, 387–394}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The original notes of the diplomatic letter noting this edict can be obtained from the Public Record Office in London. A translation of the edict, an acknowledgment from [[Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe]] to the Sublime Porte, and an accompanying letter from Canning, dated 23 March 1844, is in Foreign Office, Turkey, FO78/555/No.49. There are several other letters from Canning in the same volume on the question of the religious intolerance of the Turks. The draft of a letter from the Foreign Office, dated 16 January 1844, which made plain the attitude of the British government and which provided the direct impetus for the negotiations leading eventually to the issue of the edict, is in FO78/552/No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; presented to the British Parliament noting "The correspondence occupied a considerable part of the year—from Aug. 27, 1843, to April 19, 1844."&lt;ref name="Sours"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Michael | last = Sours | title = The 1844 Ottoman 'Edict of Toleration' in Baha'i Secondary Literature |volume = 8 | issue = 3 | year = 1998 | journal = Journal of Baha'i Studies | pages = 53–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Edict==
In February 1844 there is a question on the status of Jew apostates from Islam (who, it was claimed, must pass through being Christian on the way to Islam in the first place)&lt;ref name="quote"&gt;{{cite book|author=August Jochmus (freiherr von Cotignola.)|title=The Syrian war and the decline of the Ottoman Empire, 1840-1848: in reports, documents, and correspondences, etc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXfDamiuHEkC&amp;pg=RA1-PA106|year=1883|publisher=A. Cohn|pages=102, 106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 21, 1844 appears (in translation):

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the special and constant intention of His Highness the Sultan that his cordial relations with the High Powers be preserved, and that a perfect reciprocal friendship be maintained and increased.&lt;br&gt;
 The Sublime Porte engage to take effectual measures to prevent henceforward the execution and putting to death of the Christian who is an apostate.&lt;ref name="quote"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Muslim Islamic scholar [[Cyril Glassé]], death for [[Apostasy in Islam]] was "not in practice enforced" in later times in the Muslim world, and was "completely abolished" by "a decree of the Ottoman government in 1260AH/1844AD."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Cyril |last=Glassé |year=2001 |title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam |publisher=AltaMira |page=54|location=[[Walnut Creek, California]] |isbn=978-0-7591-0189-0|oclc=48553252}}&lt;/ref&gt; This short edict was advanced in the wider [[Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856]].

==Prophetic interpretations==
The Edict was seen by some especially among the religious as a specific sign leading towards the fulfillment of prophecy.

Research conducted by Michael Sours&lt;ref name="Sours"/&gt; into this subject and the records of the development of the Edict did not refer directly to the Jews but rather infers religious tolerance through ending executions for apostasy for Jews that seemed to convert making their social situation easier while actually keeping their personal and group identity in their Judaic religion. Jerusalem has had the largest Jewish population in Palestine in recent centuries since about 1844&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Lapidoth | first = Ruth |author2=Moshe Hirsch | title = The Jerusalem question and its resolution: selected documents|publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1994| pages = 258, 384 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=e93JIwTBjHgC&amp;lpg=PA384&amp;pg=PA384#v=onepage&amp;q | isbn = 978-0-7923-2893-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and been majority Jewish since about 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morgenstern | first = Arie |others=Joel A.

The Edict was first publicly commented upon by Reverend [[Edward Bickersteth (priest)|Edward Bickersteth]] in his publication, ''Practical Guide to the Prophecies'' in the 1844 edition.&lt;ref name="Bickersteth"/&gt; Adventist [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]], and those that disagreed with him, though unaware of the Edict and the diplomacy around it, still looked to the fortunes of the Ottoman Empire even in the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper| last = Nichol | first =Francis D. | authorlink =Francis D. Nichol| title =Reasons for our faith: A Discussion of Questions Vital to the Proper Understanding and Effective Presentation of Certain Seventh-day Adventist Teachings | pages =50–51 | publisher =Review and Herald Publishing Association.  | year=1947 | url =http://gospelclarity.com/cp/albums/Christian%20books%20general/Reasons_for_our_Faith___Nichol.pdf|accessdate = December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller pointed to the year because of the 2300 day prophecy of {{bible verse||Daniel|8:14|KJV}}, relying on the [[Day-year principle]]. The 2300 days are understood to represent 2300 years stretching from 457 BC, the calculated starting date of the [[70 weeks prophecy#Seventh-day Adventists|70 weeks prophecy]] based on the 3rd decree found in Ezra, thus leading to 1843/4. Bickersteth acknowledged the same interpretation and added a second - {{bible verse||Ezekiel|4:5|KJV}} - as a parallel to start the clock for understanding {{bible verse||Revelation|9:15|KJV}}; taking 390 years as a period for persecution of Christians in the [[End time]]. Bickersteth takes this persecution from the [[Fall of Constantinople|triumph of Ottoman]] rule of Constantinople in 1453, thus 1453+390 is 1843/4, directly before these events. Thus, independently of Miller, a number of Christian authors followed the significance of this declaration from Bickersteth including [[Alfred Edersheim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred Edersheim|authorlink = Alfred Edersheim |title=Israel's watchman (and prophetic expositor) &amp;#91;afterw.&amp;#93; The prophetic news and Israel's watchman, ed. by A.

Spicer|title=Our Day in the Light of Prophecy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypYUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA309|year=1917|publisher=Pacific Press|pages=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thornton Chase]], commonly recognized as the first convert to the [[Bahá'í Faith]] of Occidental background, noted the Edict in his publication ''The Bahai Revelation'' published in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Chase | first = Thornton | authorlink =Thornton Chase | title =The Bahai Revelation | publisher =Bahai Publishing Society, Chicago Ill. | year = 1909 | page = 32 | url =http://bahai-library.com/pdf/c/chase_bahai_revelation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Irish convert to the religion, [[George Townshend (Bahá'í)|George Townshend]] was the first broadly published to mention the Edict in Bahá'í literature in 1944&lt;ref name="Sours"/&gt; when he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The proclamation of His Faith was made in 1844, the year when the strict exclusion of the Jews from their own land enforced by the Muslims for some twelve centuries was at last relaxed by the Edict of Toleration and "the times of the Gentiles" were "fulfilled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

This was also centrally mentioned by [[William Sears (Bahá'í)|William Sears]] in his book ''Thief in the Night'' originally published in 1961&lt;ref name="Sours"/&gt; and in its 17th edition circa 2012.&lt;ref name="Sears1961"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Sears|title=Thief in the Night: Or, The Strange Case of the Missing Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqPMQgAACAAJ|date=1 January 1961|publisher=George Ronald Publisher, Limited|isbn=978-0-85398-008-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Townshend and Sears had high offices in the religion as [[Hands of the Cause]].

The '''Employee’s Rights to Representation, Consultation and Collective Bargaining Ordinance''' ({{zh-t|僱員代表權、諮詢權及集體談判權條例}}) is a repealed [[law of Hong Kong]] to provide for the rights of employees to representation, consultation and [[collective bargaining]]; and to provide for matters incidental thereto or connected therewith. It was introduced by trade unionist [[Lee Cheuk-yan]] in the colonial [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] on the eve of the [[handover of Hong Kong]] in April 1997 but was soon repealed by the [[Provisional Legislative Council]] (PLC) in October 1997.

==Contents==
The bill was introduced by the pro-labour legislator [[Lee Cheuk-yan]] of the [[Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions]] (CTU). Under the bill, employees were given rights to representation and consultation through a trade union representative and to be covered by a collective agreement negotiated by a "representative" trade union. A trade union can also request employer recognition if its membership constitutes more than 15 per cent of the employees and represents more than 50 per cent of these employees. Further provisions included the establishment of [[collective bargaining]] and the imposition on employers of a duty to allow trade union representatives paid time-off for representation, consultation and collective bargaining activities.&lt;ref name="andychan"&gt;{{cite book|page=37|title=Hong Kong Management and Labour: Change and Continuity|first1=Andy W.|last1=Chan|first2=Wilson W. S.|last2=Chow|first3=Patricia|last3=Fosh|first4=Ed|last4=Snape|first5=Robert|last5=Westwood|publisher=Routledge|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Labour Department, employers and the pro-Beijing [[Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions]] (FTU) and the [[Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions]] (FLU) opposed to the bill, mainly on the grounds that collective bargaining was not a tradition in Hong Kong where employers and labour enjoyed a "harmonious relationship".&lt;ref name="andychan"/&gt;

The bill was passed by the Legislative Council on 20 June 1997 with the support of the [[pro-democracy camp]] in the council. It was gazetted on 30 June 1997, the last day of the colonial rule.

==Repeal==
After the [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong]], the ordinance was first frozen by the [[Provisional Legislative Council]] (PLC) on 17 July 1997 on the basis of the review of the Labour Advisory Board (LAB), a tripartite body appointed by [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Tung Chee-hwa]]. A majority of the LAB members deemed it inappropriate to bring the collective bargaining into operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=42|title=The Management of Human Resources in the Asia Pacific Region: Convergence Revisited|first1=Chris|last1=Rowley|first2=John|last2=Benson|publisher=Routledge|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was frozen with three of the six other ordinances passed by the colonial Legislative Council as private members' bills also on the ground that these laws were hastily passed during the last week of the legislature in June 1997 without adequate discussion in bill committees and public consultation. 

On 30 October, the ordinance was repealed by the Employment and Labour Relations (Miscellaneous Amendments) Ordinance, along with the Employment (Amendment) (No. 4) Ordinance 1997 passed by the Legislative Council on 29 June 1997.&lt;ref name="andychan"/&gt;

It has become the subject of the labour issue in Hong Kong, in which the pro-democrats used it as an attack on the FTU which supported the repeal of the collective bargaining.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20068">'''Employment protection legislation (EPL)''' includes all types of employment protection measures, whether grounded primarily in legislation, court rulings, collectively bargained conditions of employment, or customary practice.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Employment Outlook, June 1999, Chapter 2, ''Employment Protection and Labour Market Performances'', page 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is common among circles of [[economist]]s. Employment protection refers both to regulations concerning hiring (e.g. rules favouring disadvantaged groups, conditions for using temporary or fixed-term contracts, training requirements) and firing (e.g. redundancy procedures, mandated prenotification periods and severance payments, special requirements for collective dismissals and short-time work schemes).

There exist various institutional arrangements that can provide employment protection: the private market, labour legislation, collective bargaining arrangements and not the least, court interpretations of legislative and contractual provisions. Some forms of de facto regulations are likely to be adopted even in the absence of legislation, simply because both workers and firms derive advantages from long-term employment relations.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Employment Outlook, June 1999, Chapter 2, ''Employment Protection and Labour Market Performances'', page 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
According to Barone (2001) with the acronym EPL economists refer to the entire set of regulations that place some limits to the faculties of firms to hire and fire workers, even if they are not grounded primarily in the law, but originate from the [[collective bargaining]] of the social partners, or are a consequence of [[court ruling]]s.&lt;ref name="Barone2001"&gt;Barone, Andrea (2001): ''Employment protection legislation: a critical review of the literature''. Taken from www.cesifin.it [http://www.cesifin.it/doc?_FP_REP_ID=000069.barone%20copy.pdf&amp;_VP_MAIN_OBJECT_TW_NAME=com.twproject.content.CONTENT].&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, provisions favouring the employment of disadvantaged groups in society, determining the conditions for the use of [[temporary contract|temporary]] or [[fixed-term contract]]s, or imposing training requirements on the firm, affect hiring policies, while redundancy procedures, mandated pre-notification periods and [[severance payment]]s, special requirements for [[collective dismissal]]s and short-time work schemes influence firing decisions. The nature of these restrictions on the firms’ freedom to adjust the labour input is quite similar in all OECD countries, but the actual procedural details and the overall degree of stringency implied by them varies considerably. These provisions are enforced through the worker’s right to appeal against his lay-off.

Some aspects of these regulations, like the length of advance notices or the dimension of severance payments can be measured with precision. Other important features of EPL, like for example the willingness of labour courts to entertain appeals by fired workers, or how judges interpret the concept of “just cause” for termination, are much more difficult to quantify.

==Employment Protection Legislation Index by the OECD==
One of the more frequently used measures of the strictness of the EPL in each country and through different years is the so-called '''Employment Protection Legislation Index''' elaborated by the [[OECD]]. This index is calculated along 18 basic items, which can be classified in three main areas:&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed description of this procedure, see OECD, Employment Outlook 1999, Chapter 2, Annex 2.B.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Employment protection of regular workers against individual dismissal;
# Specific requirements for collective dismissals; and
# Regulation of temporary forms of employment.

The 18 first-digit inputs are then expressed in either of the following forms:
# Units of time (e.g. delays before notice can start, or months of notice and severance pay);
# As a number (e.g. maximum number of successive fixed-term contracts allowed); or
# As a score on an ordinal scale specific to each item (0 to 2, 3, 4 or simply yes/no).

Then, these different scoring is converted into cardinal scores that are normalized to range from 0 to 6, with higher scores representing stricter regulation. Therefore, each of the different items is normalized according to weighted averages, thus constructing three sets of summary indicators that correspond to successively more aggregated measures of EPL strictness.

The last step of the procedure involves computing, for each country, an overall summary indicator based on the three subcomponents:
#Strictness of regulation for regular contracts,
#Temporary contracts, and
#Collective dismissals.

The summary measure for collective dismissals is attributed just 40% of the weight assigned to regular and temporary contracts. The rationale for this is that the collective dismissals indicator only reflects additional employment protection triggered by the collective nature of the dismissal. In most countries, these additional requirements are quite modest. Moreover, summary measures for collective dismissals are only available since the late 1990s. An alternative overall index, so-called '''Version 1''', has been thus calculated as an unweighted average of the summary measures for regular and temporary contracts only. While more restrictive than the previous one (so-called '''Version 2'''), this alternative measure of the overall EPL strictness allows comparisons over a longer period of time (since the late 1980s compared with the late 1990s).&lt;ref&gt;OECD Employment Outlook 2004, Chapter 2, ''Employment Protection Regulation and Labour Market Performance''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of employment protection legislation==

=== On the duality of the labour market ===
Some economists have claimed that empirical evidence gives support to their theories, according to which EPL leads to a [[market segment|segmentation]] in the [[labour market]] between the so-called ''insiders'', the workers with a protected job, and the ''outsiders'', who are people that are either [[unemployment|unemployed]] or [[employment|employed]] with [[fixed-term contract|fixed-term]], [[part-time contract|part-time]] or [[temporary contract|temporary]] contracts, or even in the [[black economy]], and face big difficulties to find a job covered by EPL because of the firms’ reduced propensity to hire.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} This latter group is mainly constituted by youths, women, [[racial minority|racial minorities]] and [[skilled worker|unskilled workers]].&lt;ref name="Barone2001" /&gt;

===On unemployment===
Whether EPL has any effect on unemployment is an issue of contention between economists. On the one hand, assuming that the [[economic cycle|cyclical]] wage pattern is not affected by mandated firing costs, EPL reduces the propensity to hire by employers, since they fear that such decisions will be difficult to reverse in the future, in case of a recession. On the other hand, EPL also leads firms during [[economic recession|downswings]] to keep more workers employed, than they would have otherwise done. Therefore, EPL reduces both [[job creation]] and [[job destruction]], so that the net effects on average [[employment]] and [[unemployment]] are not identifiable a priori. What is instead agreed among economists, is that more stringent EPL lowers the fluctuations in the quantity of labour [[demand]]ed over the [[business cycle]], leading to smoother dynamic patterns of those aggregates.&lt;ref name="Barone2001" /&gt;

Economists considering that EPL has no effect on unemployment include Blanchard and Portugal (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, O. and Pedro Portugal (2000): ''What hides behind an unemployment rate: Comparing Portuguese and U.S. labor markets''. The American Economic Review, Vol. 91, No. 1. (Mar., 2001), pp. 187–207.&lt;/ref&gt; In their article they compare two opposite countries as regards their EPL stance: [[Portugal]] with one of the more strict legislations in the world and the [[United States|US]] with one of the more flexible ones. In spite of these differences, both countries have similar unemployment rates which undermines the argument considering that EPL has any effect on unemployment. Instead, the authors claim that EPL does affect two other variables: [[job flows]] and unemployment duration. EPL would reduce job flows (from employment to unemployment: employers are less willing to fire, given that they must pay indemnizations to workers) therefore reducing unemployment but would increase unemployment duration, increasing the unemployment rate. These two effects would neutralize each other, explaining why overall, EPL has no effect on unemployment.

Nickell (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, Stephen (1997): ''Unemployment and Labor Market Rigidities: Europe versus North America''. The Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol. 11, No. 3. (Summer, 1997), pp. 55–74.&lt;/ref&gt; arrived to similar conclusions when stating that labor market rigidities that do not appear to have serious implications for average levels of unemployment included strict employment protection legislation and general legislation on labor market standards.

Among those that have found evidence suggesting that EPL increases unemployment are [[Edward Lazear|Lazear]] (1990).&lt;ref&gt;Lazear, Edward P. (1990): ''Job Security Provisions and Employment''. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 105, No. 3. (Aug., 1990), pp. 699–726.&lt;/ref&gt; The author argued that mandated severance pay seemed to increase unemployment rates. His estimates suggested that an increase from zero to three months of severance pay would raise the unemployment rate by 5.5 percent in the United States.

===On employment===
Lazear (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Lazear, Edward P. (1990): ''Job Security Provisions and Employment''. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 105, No. 3. (Aug., 1990), pp. 699–726.&lt;/ref&gt; once again argues he has evidence suggesting that EPL reduces the [[employment-to-population ratio]]. In his article he claims that the best estimates suggest that moving from no required [[severance pay]] to three months of required severance pay to employees with ten years of service would reduce the employment-population ratio by about one percent. In the [[United States]] that would mean over a million jobs. Lazear argues that the young could bear a disproportionate amount of the burden.

To the contrary, Bertola and Bentolila (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Bentolila, Samuel and Giuseppe Bertola (1990): ''Firing Costs and Labour Demand: How Bad is Eurosclerosis?''. The Review of Economic Studies, Vol. 57, No. 3. (Jul., 1990), pp. 381–402.&lt;/ref&gt; found evidence supporting the idea that firing costs have a larger effect on firms' propensity to fire than to hire, and therefore (slightly) increase average long-run [[employment]].

===On wages===
Several authors have found that EPL has significant effects on wages. As stated by Lazear (1990),&lt;ref&gt;Lazear, Edward (1990): ''Job Security Provisions and Employment''. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 105(3): 699–726.&lt;/ref&gt; in a perfect labor market, severance payments can have no real effects as they can be undone by a properly designed labor contract. Leonardi and Pica (2006) found evidence supporting this claim. They suggest that in the case of [[Italy]] an EPL reform in 1990 had as effect to reduce entry wages by 6 percent, implying that firms tend to transfer the increase in the cost of firing (due to EPL) onto workers. In fact, in their study they find that 25 percent of the firing cost was shifted onto lower wages in the case of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Leonardi, Marco and Giovanni Pica (2006): ''Effects of Employment Protection Legislation on Wages: a Regression Discontinuity Approach''. IZA Working Papers. Downloadable [http://www.iza.org/conference_files/TAM2006/pica_g1513.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

===On firm efficiency and profits===
In principle the effects on profits are ambiguous. Because of EPL, firms engage themselves in labour hoarding practices, which lead them to employ a lower quantity of workers during upswings, while keeping inefficient levels of employment in downturns. For a given level of wages, this loss of productive [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] would result in lower average [[profit (economics)|profit]]s. On the other hand, if firms
operated in a context of efficiency wages, by inducing more stable relationships with the workers and reducing their job and income insecurity, EPL could allow them to pay lower wages, without reducing the effort provided by the labour force employed, with beneficial effects on profits.&lt;ref name="Barone2001" /&gt;

===On product market regulation===
There appears to be agreement among economists on the positive [[correlation]] between product market and employment [[regulation]]. Although employment protection legislation is only one aspect of the wide range of regulatory interventions in the [[labour market]],  Nicoletti et al. (2000) find evidence suggesting that, across countries, restrictive regulatory environments in the product market tend to be associated with restrictive employment protection policies. They claim that the indicators presented in their paper are closely related, with a statistical [[correlation]] of 0.73 ([[statistical significance|significant]] at the 1% level). In other words, according to these results, restrictive product market regulations are matched by analogous EPL restrictions to generate a tight overall regulatory environment for firms in their product market as well as in the allocation of [[labour input]]s. The strong correlation between regulatory regimes in
the product market and EPL also suggests that their influence may have compounded effects on labour market outcomes, making regulatory reform in only one market less effective than simultaneous reform in the two markets.&lt;ref&gt;Nicoletti, Giuseppe; Stefano Scarpetta and Olivier Boylaud (2000): ''Summary Indicators of Product Market Regulation with an Extension to Employment Protection Legislation''. OECD Economics Department Working Papers NO. 226, April 13, 2000, p.51. Downloadable [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/21/13/1880867.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kugler and Pica (2003) find similar results in the case of the [[Economy of Italy|Italian economy]]. They present a matching model which illustrates how [[barriers to entry]] in the [[product market]] (product market regulation) mitigate the impact of [[labor market]] [[deregulation]], (that is, mitigate the effects of a reduction in the strictness of EPL). In the author's opinion, this means that there are economic complementarities between labor and product market policies in their model, in the sense that the effectiveness of one policy depends on the implementation of the other policy. Thus, an important implication of their model is that labor market deregulation will be less effective in the presence of heavier regulations of entry.&lt;ref&gt;Kugler, Adriana and Giovanni Pica (2003): ''Effects of Employment Protection and Product Market Regulations on the Italian Labor Market''. Journal of Economic Literature, November 12, 2003, p. 7. Downloadable [http://www.uh.edu/~adkugler/lpmr51.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Similar results are obtained by Koeniger and Vindigni (2003).&lt;ref&gt;Koeniger, Winfried and Andrea Vindigni (2003): ''Employment Protection and Product Market Regulation''. IZA WZB Economics Seminar Series. July 28, 2003. Downloadable [http://www.wz-berlin.de/mp/sem/past/2003/pap2003/koeniger.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

===On hours per worker===
Whereas EPL may have not a [[statistical significance|significant]] effect on unemployment, strict EPL gives incentives to the firms to resort to other sources of [[Labour market flexibility|flexibility]] like overtime, which, as shown by Abraham and Houseman (1994),&lt;ref&gt;Abraham K.G. and Houseman S.N.(1994): ''Does Employment Protection Inhibit Labour Market Flexibility? Lessons from Germany, France and Belgium''. In Blank R.M. (ed.) ''Social Protection versus Economic Flexibility: Is there a trade-off?''. The University of Chicago Press, (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; indeed tends to be used much more in Continental European countries, where the variability of hours per worker is significantly higher than in the Anglo-Saxon [[labour market]]s.

==Economic theory ==
In economic theory, several authors have argued that employment protection can be desirable when there are frictions in the working of markets. For example, Pissarides (2001) and Alvarez and Veracierto (2001) show that employment protection can play an important role in the absence of perfect insurance markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pissarides|first=Christopher A|date=2001|title=Employment protection|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0927-5371(01)00032-X|journal=Labour Economics|volume=8|issue=2|pages=131–159|doi=10.1016/s0927-5371(01)00032-x|issn=0927-5371|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=Fernando|last2=Veracierto|first2=Marcelo|date=2001|title=Severance payments in an economy with frictions|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3932(01)00058-7|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=47|issue=3|pages=477–498|doi=10.1016/s0304-3932(01)00058-7|issn=0304-3932|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmitz (2004) argues that constraining contractual freedom by legislating employment protection can be welfare-enhancing when principal-agent relationships are plagued by asymmetric information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=Patrick W|date=2004|title=Job protection laws and agency problems under asymmetric information|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2003.12.007|journal=European Economic Review|volume=48|issue=5|pages=1027–1046|doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2003.12.007|issn=0014-2921|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1956">'''Half-proof''' ''(semiplena probatio)'' was a concept of [[medieval Roman law]], describing a level of [[evidence]] between mere [[suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]] and the full [[Evidence (law)|proof]] (''plena probatio'') needed to convict someone of a crime. The concept was introduced by the [[Glossator]]s of the 1190s such as [[Azo (jurist)|Azo]], who gives such examples as a single witness or private documents.&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'', Baltimore, 2001, pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where there was half-proof against a defendant, he might be allowed to take an oath as to his innocence, or he might be sent for [[torture]] to extract further evidence that could complete the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]].&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, pp. 26-7, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Sir Matthew Hale]], the leading late 17th-century English jurist, wrote:
"The evidence at Law which taken singly or apart makes but an imperfect proof, ''semiplena probatio'', yet in conjunction with others grows to a full proof, like Silurus his twigs, that were easily broken apart, but in conjunction or union were not to be broken."&lt;ref&gt;B. Shapiro, ''Probability and Certainty in Seventeenth-Century England'', Princeton, 1983, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the concept never became firmly established in [[English law]].

'''''Hoenig v Isaacs''''' [1952] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1952/6.html EWCA Civ 6] is an [[English contract law]] case, concerning substantial performance of an entire obligation.

==Facts==
Mr Hoenig was meant to decorate and furnish Mr Isaac’s flat for £750. When the work was done, there were problems with a bookcase and wardrobe, which would cost £55 to fix. Mr Isaac refused to pay the £350 outstanding.

==Judgment==
[[Donald Somervell, Baron Somervell of Harrow|Somervell LJ]] noted each case turns on the construction of the contract. Where there is substantial performance of the contract, then money must be paid. The work was done, and then there was merely a damages claim in respect of the faulty bits.

[[Denning LJ]] gave judgment as follows.

{{Cquote|This case raises the familiar question: Was entire performance a condition precedent to payment? That depends on the true construction of the contract.

In this case the contract was made over a period of time and was partly oral and partly in writing, but I agree with the [[Official Referee]] that the essential terms were set down in the letter of 25th April, 1950. It describes the work which was to be done and concludes with these words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The foregoing, complete, for the sum of £750 nett. Terms of payment are nett cash, as the work proceeds; and balance on completion."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The defendant paid £150 on 12th April, 1950, and another £150 on the 19th April, 1950. On 8th August, 1950, the plaintiffs said that they had carried out the work in absolute compliance with the contract and demanded payment of the balance of £450. On the 30th August, 1950, the defendant paid £100, but said that there were defects and omissions in the work and that he would call in someone else to make them good and deduct the cost from the plaintiffs' bill. He did not do this but entered into occupation of the flat and used the furniture. The plaintiffs then brought this action for the balance of £350. They denied that there were any defects at all. The Official Referee found that there were defects in three of the items of furniture and that the cost of remedying them was £55.18s.2d. He deducted that sum from the £350 and gave judgment for the plaintiffs for £294.1s.10d.

The question of law that was debated before us was whether the plaintiffs were entitled in this action to sue for the £350 balance of the contract price as they had done. The defendant said that they were only entitled to sue on a ''[[quantum meruit]]''. The defendant was anxious to insist upon a ''[[quantum meruit]]'', because he said that the contract price was unreasonably high. He wished therefore to reject that price altogether and to pay simply a reasonable price for all the work that was done. This would obviously mean an inquiry into the value of every item, including all the many items which were in compliance with the contract as well as the three which fell short of it. That is what the defendant wanted. The plaintiffs resisted this course and refused therefore to claim on a ''[[quantum meruit]]''. They said that they were entitled to the balance of £350 less a deduction for the defects.

In determining this issue the first question is whether, on the true construction of the contract, entire performance was a condition precedent to payment. It was a lump sum contract, but that does not mean that entire performance was a condition precedent to payment.

When a contract provides for a specific sum to be paid on completion of specified work, the Courts lean against a construction of the contract which would deprive the contractor of any payment at all simply because there are some defects or omissions. The promise to complete the work is therefore construed as a term of the contract, but not as a condition. It is not every breach of that term which absolves the employer from his promise to pay the price, but only a breach which goes to the root of the contract, such as an abandonment of the work when it is only half done. Unless the breach does go to the root of the matter, the employer cannot resist payment of the price. He must pay it and bring a cross-claim for the defects and omissions, or alternatively set them up in diminution of the price. The measure is the amount which the work is worth less by reason of the defects and omissions, and is usually calculated by the cost of making them good; see ''[[Mondel v Steel]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1841) 8 Meeson &amp; Welsby, page 858); H. Dakin &amp; Co. Ld. v. Lee (1916, 1 King's Bench, page 566&lt;/ref&gt; and the notes to ''[[Cutter v Powell]]'' in the 13th Edition of Smith's Leading Cases II., 19-21.

It is, of course, always open to the parties by express words to make entire performance a condition precedent. A familiar instance is when the contract provides for progress payments to be made as the work proceeds, but for retention money to be held until completion. Then entire performance is usually a condition precedent to payment of the retention money, but not, of course, to the progress payments. The contractor is entitled to payment pro rata as the work proceeds, less a deduction for retention money: but he is not entitled to the retention money until the work is entirely finished, without defects or omissions.

In this case the contract provided for "nett cash as the work proceeds and balance on completion." If the balance could be regarded as retention money, then it might well be that the contractor ought to have done all the work correctly, without defects or omissions, in order to be entitled to the balance. But I do not think the balance should be regarded as retention money. Retention money is usually only 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, whereas this balance was more than 50 per cent. I think this contract should be regarded as an ordinary lump sum contract. It was substantially performed. The contractor is entitled therefore to the contract price, less a deduction for the defects.

Even if entire performance was a condition precedent, nevertheless the result would be the same; because I think the condition was waived. It is always open to a party to waive a condition which is inserted for his benefit. What amounts to a waiver depends on the circumstances. If this was an entire contract, then when the plaintiff tendered the work to the defendant as being a fulfilment of the contract, the defendant could have refused to accept it until the defects were made good, in which case he would not have been liable for the balance of the price until they were made good. But he did not refuse to accept the work. On the contrary, he entered into possession of the flat and used the furniture as his own, including the defective items. That was a clear waiver of the condition precedent. Just as in a sale of goods, the buyer, who accepts the goods, can no longer treat a breach of condition as giving a right to reject but only a right to damages: so also in a contract for work and labour, an employer who takes the benefit of the work can no longer treat entire performance as a condition precedent, but only as a term giving rise to damages. The case becomes then an ordinary lump sum contract governed by the principles laid down in ''[[Mondel v Steel]]'' and ''[[Dakin v Lee]]''. The employer must therefore pay the contract price subject to a deduction for defects or omissions.

I would point out that in these cases the question of quantum meruit only arises when there is a breach or failure of performance which goes to the very root of the matter. On any lump sum contract, if the work is not substantially performed and there has been a failure of performance which goes to the root of it, as, for instance, when the work has only been half done, or is entirely different in kind from that contracted for, then no action will lie for the lump sum. The contractor can then only succeed in getting paid for what he has done if it was the employer's fault that the work was incomplete; or there is something to justify the conclusion that the parties have entered into a fresh contract: or the failure of performance is due to impossibility or frustration, see ''[[Appleby v Myers]]''&lt;ref&gt;Law Reports, 2 Common Pleas, page 651, at page 660&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Sumpter v Hedges]]'' (1898) 1 Queen's Bench 673, and section 1 (3) of the [[Frustrated Contracts Act 1943]]. In such cases the contractor can recover in an action for restitution such sum as he deserves, or in the words of the Act, "such sum as the Court considers just." Those cases do not, however, apply in this case, because in this case the work has been substantially performed.

In my opinion the Official Referee was right and this appeal should be dismissed.}}

[[File:Blue-Eagle+IRS.png|right|thumb|200px]]
Taxpayers in the United States may face various penalties for failures related to Federal, state, and local tax matters. The [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) is primarily responsible for charging these penalties at the Federal level. The IRS can assert only those penalties specified imposed under Federal tax law. State and local rules vary widely, are administered by state and local authorities, and are not discussed herein.

Penalties may be monetary or may involve forfeiture of property. Criminal penalties may include jail time, but are imposed only by a federal judge after a defendant is convicted. Most monetary penalties are based on the amount of tax not properly paid. Penalties may increase with the period of nonpayment. Some penalties are fixed dollar amounts or fixed percentages of some measure required to be reported.&lt;ref&gt;Most of the penalty rules are in Chapters 68 through 75 of the [[Internal Revenue Code]], sections 6651 through 7344. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_F.html 26 USC Subtitle F].&lt;/ref&gt; Excise taxes used as penalties are imposed in the Code sections relating to particular kinds of transactions. Some penalties may be waived or abated where the taxpayer shows reasonable cause for the failure.

Penalties apply for failures to file income tax returns or information returns, or for filing incorrect returns. Some penalties may be very minor. Penalties apply for certain types of errors on tax returns, and may be substantial. Some penalties are imposed as excise taxes on particular transactions. Certain other penalties apply for other types of failures. Certain acts may result in forfeiture of property of the taxpayer.

There are over 150 kinds&lt;ref&gt;Alan J. Tarr, J.D., LL.M. (Taxation) &amp; Pamela Jensen Drucker, J.D., LL.M. (Taxation), ''Civil Tax Penalties'', U.S. Income Portfolios, Vol. 634 (2d ed. 2012), Bloomberg BNA.&lt;/ref&gt; of civil penalties in the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Code]], ranging in severity which is reflected in the amount of the applicable fines.

==Underestimate and late payment penalties==
Taxpayers are required to have withholding of tax or make quarterly estimated tax payments before the end of the tax year. Because accurate estimation requires accurate prediction of the future, taxpayers sometimes underestimate the amount due. The penalty for paying too little estimated tax or having too little tax withheld is computed with interest on the amount that should have been, but was not, paid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6654- 26 USC 6654].&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a taxpayer has filed an income or excise tax return that shows a balance due but does not pay that balance by the due date of the return (without extensions), a different charge applies. This charge has two components: an interest charge, computed as described above, and second a penalty of 0.5% per month applied to the unpaid balance of tax and interest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6651- 26 USC 6651(a)(3).]&lt;/ref&gt;  The 0.5% penalty is capped at 25% of the total unpaid tax.

The underestimate penalty and interest on late payment are automatically assessed.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc653.html IRS Tax Topic 653].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penalties for failure to timely file returns or timely pay tax==
'''Penalty for Failure to Timely File Return:''' If a taxpayer is required to file an income or excise tax return and fails to timely do so, a late filing penalty may be assessed. The penalty is 5% of the amount of unpaid tax per month (or partial month) the return is late, up to a maximum of 25%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6651- 26 USC 6651(a)(1)].&lt;/ref&gt; A minimum penalty of $205 may apply for returns over 60 days late. The minimum penalty is the lesser of $205 or 100% of the tax due on the return.

'''Penalty for Failure to Timely Pay Tax:''' If a taxpayer fails to pay the balance due shown on the tax return by the due date (even if the reason of nonpayment is a bounced check), there is a penalty of 0.5% of the amount of unpaid tax per month (or partial month), up to a maximum of 25%.

'''Penalty for Failure to Timely Pay After Issuance of Notice:''' If a taxpayer fails to pay any additional tax assessed by the IRS (usually as a result of an audit) the taxpayer may be liable for a penalty equal to 0.5% for each month (or partial month) during which the failure continues, if the amount is not paid within 21 calendar days after the date of an IRS notice demanding the payment.

If both the failure to file and the failure to pay penalties apply during the same month, then the failure to file penalty is reduced by 0.5% each month.

The 25% cap above applies to the 5% late filing penalty and the 0.5% late payment penalty together. The late filing penalty may be waived or abated on showing of reasonable cause for failure. The failure to file penalty is imposed and starts to accrue interest from the due date of the return.&lt;ref&gt;IRC§6651(a)(1)&lt;/ref&gt; The failure to pay penalty is imposed when a taxpayer pays the taxes after payment was due, computed from the date prescribed for paying the tax.&lt;ref&gt;IRC§6651(a)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internal Revenue Service advises that if the taxpayer wants to compute the penalty for failure to timely file and the penalty for failure to timely pay the tax shown on the return, or the interest, and to pay those items at the time the return is filed, the taxpayer can "identify and enter the amount in the bottom margin" on the second page of Form 1040. The IRS advises that the taxpayer "not include interest or penalties (other than the estimated tax penalty)" in the "Amount Owed" line of the form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040gi/ar02.html#d0e63714 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |title=1040 (2015) |accessdate=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy related penalties==
If amounts reported on an income tax return are later adjusted by the IRS and a tax increase results, an additional penalty may apply. This penalty of 20% or 40% of the increase in tax is due in the case of substantial understatement of tax, substantial valuation misstatements, [[transfer pricing]] adjustments, or negligence or disregard of rules or regulations. For example, a valuation overstatement can result in a 30% penalty on the amount of tax owed. Special rules apply for each of these types of errors under which the penalty may be waived.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6662- 26 USC 6662].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penalties in connection with information returns==
Certain types of returns, called "information returns," do not require payment of tax. These include forms filed by employers to report wages ([https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw2_09.pdf Form W-2]) and businesses to report certain payments ([https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw2_09.pdf Form 1099 series instructions]). The penalty for failures related to these forms is a dollar amount per form not timely filed, and the amount of penalty increases with the degree of lateness. The current maximum penalty for these forms is $50.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6721- 26 USC 6721].&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the forms must be filed electronically, and filing on paper is considered non-filing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/aprqtr/26cfr301.6721-1.htm 26 CFR 301-6721-1(a)(2)(ii)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Late filing of returns of partnership income (Form 1065) can result in penalties of $195 per month per partner, up to a maximum of 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6698- 26 USC 6698].&lt;/ref&gt; Similar penalties may apply to an income tax return (Form 1120S) for an S corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6699- 26 USC 6699].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Technically, the Form 1120S is an income tax return, not an information return.&lt;/ref&gt;

==100% penalty on unpaid withholding taxes==
{{main|Trust Fund Recovery Penalty}}
Employers are required to withhold income and social security taxes from wages paid to employees, and to pay these amounts promptly to the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_C.html 26 USC 3101-3406].&lt;/ref&gt;  A penalty of 100% of the amount not paid over (plus liability for paying the withheld amounts) may be collected without judicial proceedings from each and every person who had custody and control of the funds and did not make the payment to the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6672- 26 USC 6672].&lt;/ref&gt;  This applies to company employees and officers as individuals, as well as to companies themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/3504- 26 USC 3504].&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been reported cases of the IRS seizing houses of those failing to pay over employee taxes.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', ''United States v. St. Clair'', 45 Amer. Fed. Tax Rep. 2d 80-1528, 80-1 U.S. Tax Cas. ([[CCH (company)|CCH]]) ¶ 9364, (N.D. Texas 1980), in which the court upheld seizure of the taxpayer's personal residence for failure to pay over withholding taxes payable by the company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penalties for failure to provide foreign information==
Taxpayers who are shareholders of [[controlled foreign corporation]]s must file [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5471.pdf Form 5471] with respect to each such controlled foreign corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6038- 26 USC 6038].&lt;/ref&gt;  Penalties for failure to timely file are $10,000 to $50,000 per form, plus possible loss of foreign tax credits.  U.S. corporations more than 25% owned, directly or indirectly, by foreign persons must file [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5472.pdf Form 5472] to report such ownership and all transactions with related parties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6038A- 26 USC 6038A].&lt;/ref&gt;  Failure to timely file carries a $10,000 penalty per required form.  This penalty may be increased by $10,000 per month per form for continued failure to file.  In addition, taxpayers who fail to report changes in foreign taxes used as credits against Federal income tax may be subject to penalties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6689- 26 USC 6689].&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. citizen or resident taxpayers (including entities) who are beneficiaries of a foreign trust or make transfers of property to a foreign trust must report information about the transfer and the trust or corporation.  Failure to timely report on [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f3520.pdf Form 3520] or [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f3520a.pdf Form 3520-A] may result in penalties of up to 35%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6677- 26 USC 6677].&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar transferors to foreign corporations failing to file [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f926.pdf Form 926] may face penalties of 10% of the value of the transfer, up to $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6038B- 26 USC 6038B].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excise taxes as penalties==
Federal excise taxes are imposed on a variety of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_D.html Subtitle D of 26 USC].&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these taxes require purchase of tax stamps or other evidence of advance payment of tax.  Some require collection of the tax by retailers.  An assortment of penalties apply to manufacturers and retailers not complying with the particular rules.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p510/ch05.html Manufacturers Taxes], IRS&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, certain penalties are imposed in the form of an excise tax.  Pension and benefit plans must pay a tax for a variety of failures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_D_20_43.html 26 USC 4971-4980G]&lt;/ref&gt;  Charities and private foundations must pay an excise tax on prohibited transactions and other failures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_D_20_41.html 26 USC 4911, 4912] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_D_20_42_30_A.html 26 USC 4940-4948].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax fraud penalties==
Intentional filing of materially false tax returns is a criminal offence. A person convicted of committing tax fraud, or aiding and abetting another in committing tax fraud, may be subject to forfeiture of property &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_F_20_75_30_C.html 26 USC 7301-7328].&lt;/ref&gt; and/or jail time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_F_20_75_30_A_40_I.html 26 USC 7201-7217].&lt;/ref&gt;  Conviction and sentencing is through the court system. Responsibility for prosecution falls to the U.S. Department of Justice, not the Internal Revenue Service.

Penalties may be assessed against [[tax protesters]] who raise arguments that income tax laws are not valid, or who otherwise file frivolous returns or court petitions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6702- 26 USC 6702] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6673- 26 USC 6673].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax adviser penalties==
Penalties also apply to people who promote tax shelters&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6701- 26 USC 6700].&lt;/ref&gt; or who fail to maintain and disclose lists of reportable transactions their customers or clients for those transactions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6707A- 26 USC 6707A].&lt;/ref&gt;  These monetary penalties can be severe.

==Judicial appeal of penalties==
Most penalties are subject to judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;See the discussions in IRS [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5.pdf Publication 5 ].&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the courts rarely modify assessment of the penalties and interest for underestimate or late payment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21694">An '''Internet leak''' occurs when a party's [[confidentiality|confidential]] information is released to the public on the [[Internet]]. Various types of information and data can be, and have been, "leaked" to the Internet, the most common being personal information, computer [[software]] and [[source code]], and artistic works such as books or [[album]]s. For example, a musical album is leaked if it has been made available to the public on the Internet before its official release date; and is still intended to be confidential.

== Source code leaks ==
'''[[Source code]] leaks''' are usually caused by misconfiguration of software like [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] or [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] which allow people to get source files by exploiting, by software [[computer bug|bugs]], or by employees that have access to the sources of part of them revealing the code in order to harm the company.

There were many cases of source code leaks in the history of software development.

For instance, as [[Fraunhofer society|Fraunhofer IIS]] released in 1994 only a low quality version of their [[MP3]] encoding software ([[l3enc]]), a hacker named SoloH gathered the [[source code]] from the unprotected servers of the [[University of Erlangen]] and developed a higher quality version, which started the MP3 revolution on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/09/the-heavenly-jukebox/305141/ The heavenly jukebox] on [[The Atlantic]] ''"To show industries how to use the codec, MPEG cobbled together a free sample program that converted music into MP3 files. The demonstration software created poor-quality sound, and Fraunhofer did not intend that it be used. The software's "source code"—its underlying instructions—was stored on an easily accessible computer at the University of Erlangen, from which it was downloaded by one SoloH, a hacker in the Netherlands (and, one assumes, a Star Wars fan). SoloH revamped the source code to produce software that converted compact-disc tracks into music files of acceptable quality."''

Also in 2003, source code to [[Diebold Election Systems]] Inc. [[voting machine]]s was leaked. Researchers at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Rice University]] published a damning critique of Diebold's products, based on an analysis of the software. They found, for example, that it would be easy to program a counterfeit voting card to work with the machines and then use it to cast multiple votes inside the voting booth.

In 2003 a Chinese Hacker acquired the [[Lineage II]] source code, and sold it to someone who set up alternative servers. Shutdown by [[FBI]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmorpg.com/lineage-2/news/fbi-shuts-down-lineage-ii-private-server-1000007104 fbi-shuts-down-lineage-ii-private-server] on mmorpg.com (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071212021338/http://www.fbi.gov/page2/feb07/iptheft020107.htm CRACKING THE CODE Online IP Theft Is Not a Game] on FBI.gov (02/01/2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, one year after [[3dfx]] was bought by [[Nvidia]] and support ended, the source code for their drivers leaked,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golem.de/0305/25378.html Treiber-Quellcode von 3dfx im Netz aufgetaucht - Von Nvidia offenbar geduldet] by Christian Klaß on Golem.de (7 May 2003, in German)&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in [[fan-made]], updated drivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuangel.net/NuDrivers/ NuAngel.net Drivers] on nuangel.net&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a large portion of [[Windows NT 4.0]]'s source code and a small percentage (reportedly about 15%) of [[Windows 2000]]'s were leaked online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/114771/article.html Windows Code May Be Stolen] on [[PC World]] by Joris Evers (February 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The Windows 2000 source code leak was analysed by a writer for (now defunct) website Kuro5hin who noted that while the code was generally well written, allegedly "there are a dozen or so 'fucks' and 'shits', and hundreds of 'craps'." The writer also noted that there were a lot of code hacks, with the "uglier" ones mostly being for compatibility with older programs and some hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atdt.freeshell.org/k5/story_2004_2_15_71552_7795.html|title=We Are Morons: a quick look at the Win2k source {{!}}{{!}} kuro5hin.org|website=atdt.freeshell.org|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was feared that because of the leak, the number of security [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]]s would increase due to wider scrutiny of the source code. It was later discovered that the source of the leak originated from [[Mainsoft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Also in 2004, partial (800&amp;nbsp;MB) proprietary source code that drives [[Cisco Systems]]' networking hardware was made available in the internet. The site posted two files of source code written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], which apparently enables some next-generation [[IPv6]] functionality. News of the latest source code leak appeared on a Russian security site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.SecurityLab.ru|title=SecurityLab|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] hackers stole source code (about 1&amp;nbsp;GiB) for [[Symantec]]'s [[pcAnywhere]] from the company's network. While confirmed in January 2012, it is still unclear how the hackers accessed the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/01/symantec-suspected-breach-in-2006-didnt-confirm-until-anonymous-revealed-source-code.ars|title=Symantec suspected source code breach back in 2006|work=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2007, the source code of [[Norton Ghost|Norton Ghost 12]] and a [[Norton Anti-Spyware]] version were available via [[BitTorrent]].

In December 2007 and January 8, a [[Pirate Bay]] user published the sources of five [http://www.idera.com Idera] [[SQL]] products via BitTorrent.

In January 2011 the "stolen source code" of [[Kaspersky Anti-Virus|Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2008]] was published on the Pirate Bay.

On May 20, 2011, [[EVE Online]]'s [[source code]] was published by someone on a [[GitHub]] repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/games/eve-online-source-code-posted-online-dmca-takedown-quickly-follows-1382821/ |title=Eve Online source code posted online, DMCA takedown quickly follows |first=Matthew |last=Humphries |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2015-11-07 |publisher=geek.com |quote=It looks as though someone has posted the source code for the space MMO Eve Online there.

=== End-of-life leaks by developers ===
Sometimes software developers themselves will leak their source code in an effort to prevent a software product from becoming [[abandonware]] after it has reached its [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life]], allowing the community to continue development and support. Reasons for leaking instead of a proper release to [[public domain]] or as [[open-source software|open-source]] can include scattered or lost [[intellectual property rights]]. An example is the [[video game]] ''[[Falcon 4.0]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/01/21/diehard_pilots_keep_falcon_flying/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040408111542/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/01/21/diehard_pilots_keep_falcon_flying/|archivedate=2004-04-08 |accessdate=2016-06-28 |publisher=Boston.com|title=Diehard pilots keep Falcon flying|author=Hiawatha Bray|date=2004-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="falcon4.0leak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleared-to-engage.com/2011/03/12/interview-with-kevin-klemmick-lead-software-engineer-for-falcon-4-0/|title=Interview with Kevin Klemmick - Lead Software Engineer for Falcon 4.0 | publisher=Cleared-To-Engage |date=2011-03-12 |first=Giorgio |last=Bertolone |accessdate=2014-08-31 |quote=''[C2E] In 2000 the source code of Falcon 4.0 leaked out and after that groups of volunteers were able to make fixes and enhancements that assured the longevity of this sim.

Another notable example is an archive of [[Infocom]]'s video games [[source code]] which appeared from an anonymous Infocom source and was archived by the [[Internet Archive]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waxy.org/2008/04/milliways_infocoms_unreleased_sequel_to_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galax/ |title=Milliways: Infocom's Unreleased Sequel to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|date=Apr 17, 2008|quote=''From an anonymous source close to the company, I've found myself in possession of the "Infocom Drive" — a complete backup of Infocom's shared network drive from 1989.[...] Among the assets included: design documents, email archives, employee phone numbers, sales figures, internal meeting notes, corporate newsletters, and the source code and game files for every released and unreleased game Infocom made''|publisher=waxy.org |first=Andy |last=Baio |accessdate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other leaks ==
* In late 1998, a number of confidential [[Microsoft]] documents later dubbed the ''[[Halloween documents]]'' were leaked to [[Eric S. Raymond]], an activist in the [[open-source software]] movement, who published and commented on them online. The documents revealed that internally Microsoft viewed free and open-source software such as [[Linux]] as technologically competitive and a major threat for Microsoft's dominance in the market, and they discussed strategies to combat them. The discovery caused a public controversy. The documents were also used as evidence in several court cases.
* [[Nintendo]]'s crossover fighting video game series ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' has a history of having unconfirmed content leaked. While the first two games predated its online community, every game since has been leaked in some form:
** ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' for the [[Wii]] was leaked by a video on the [[Japanese language]] wii.com website, revealing unconfirmed playable characters on January 28, 2008 (three days before the game's Japanese release).
** ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' was afflicted in August 2014 by the "ESRB leak", where many screenshots and limited video footage of the 3DS version were leaked by a supposed member of the [[ESRB]]. The leak gained traction very quickly due to the screenshots mostly containing elements that the game ratings board would be interested in, such as trophies of suggestively-dressed female characters (some of which were later found to be edited or cut altogether in the final game).
** ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' was leaked in its entirety two weeks before its release, allowing many to play and datamine in advance. While the entire roster of characters and stages had already been officially revealed, many unrevealed collectibles, music tracks, and story elements were discovered and distributed. This prompted Nintendo to issue copyright strikes to many YouTube and Twitch channels.
* Several high-profile books have been leaked on the Internet before their official release date, including ''[[If I Did It]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', and an early draft of the first twelve chapters of ''[[Midnight Sun (Stephenie Meyer novel)|Midnight Sun]]''. The leak of the latter prompted the author [[Stephenie Meyer]] to suspend work on the novel.
* On January 31, 2014 the original uncensored version of the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" was leaked, when it was illegally pulled from the South Park Studios servers and was posted online in its entirety without any approval by [[Comedy Central]]. The episode was heavily censored by the network when it aired in 2010 against the will of series creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], and was never formally released uncensored to the public. The episode was the second in a [[story arc|two parter]] and was censored after the airing of the [[200 (South Park)|first part]] as a result of [[death threats]] from [[Islamic extremism|Islamic extremists]] who were angry of the episode's storyline satirizing censorship of [[depictions of Muhammad]].&lt;ref name=AVCLUBLEAKED&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Neal|first=Sean|title=An uncensored version of South Park's controversial Muhammad episode has surfaced|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/the-uncensored-version-of-south-parks-controversia-107422|publisher=[[The A.V.

* In 2015 the unaired ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' episode "Boston" was leaked online. The episode was set to air during the [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 5)|fifth season]], but [[Adult Swim]] was forced to pull it to avoid further controversy surrounding the [[2007 Boston bomb scare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gonzales|first1=Dave|title=Banned Aqua Teen Hunger Force Boston episode leaks online|url=http://www.geek.com/news/banned-aqua-teen-hunger-force-boston-episode-leaks-online-1620022/|publisher=[[Geek.com]]|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 13, 2016, the full list of qualifying teams and first round match-ups for the [[2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] leaked on Twitter in the midst of a television special being broadcast by [[CBS Sports|CBS]] to officially unveil them. The leak exacerbated criticism of a new, two-hour format for the selection broadcast, which was criticized for revealing the full tournament bracket at a slower pace than in previous years.&lt;ref name="wp-ssratings"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ratings for CBS's NCAA tournament selection show were almost as bad as show itself|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/03/14/ratings-for-cbss-ncaa-tournament-selection-show-were-almost-as-bad-as-show-itself/|date=March 14, 2016|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lat-twohour"&gt;{{cite news|title=NCAA says it's investigating the bracket leak that saved us from the two-hour Selection Sunday show|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-ncaa-tournament-bracket-leak-20160314-story.html|date=March 14, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Louis de Gouttes''' (1739 - 7 March 1794) was a [[cleric]] and a [[France|French]] statesman of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]].

==Biography==

Born in [[Tulle]], in [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]], he joined a regiment of [[dragoons]] as a young man before becoming a priest.

Curé of a parish near [[Bordeaux]], then of [[Argilliers]] in the [[Franche-Comte]], he was one of the leaders of the lower clergy of his diocese, demanding higher salaries for the impoverished parish priest.

He was elected (27 March 1789) by the sénéchaussée of [[Béziers]] in [[Languedoc]], to the [[Estates General (France)|First Estate]] of the [[Estates General of 1789|Estates General]], with 185 votes out of 3111. He served a term as president of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] 29 April to 8 May 1790.

In 1791, he was consecrated as [[Constitutional bishop]] of [[Saône-et-Loire]] to replace of [[Talleyrand]], who had resigned from the position he held under the [[ancien régime]] as [[Bishop of Autun]]. On 3 September, he was elected administrator of the département.

Having protested against [[dechristianisation]] and against the [[Reign of Terror]], he was arrested by decree of the [[Committee of Public Safety]]. Sentenced to death on 6 Germinal Year II, he was guillotined the next day, 7 March 1794.

'''''Jordan House Hotel Ltd v Menow''''' (1973) is a landmark decision of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] on the commercial host liability where the Court held that a bar owner has a duty to reasonably ensure their intoxicated patrons are able to make it home safely.

Menow had a reputation of behaving badly and was banned from the Jordan House Hotel for drunken behavior.  Eventually he was allowed back and was allowed to be served alcohol on the condition that he be escorted by a responsible adult. On a later night he went to the hotel bar but was abandoned by his escort for three hours while he was served drinks. He became extremely intoxicated and began to harass other patrons. Menow was soon ejected from the hotel bar and started to make his way home down a highway but was hit by a car.

Menow brought an action against the hotel in [[tort]] for violating their [[duty of care]] by serving him alcohol and not ensuring he was safe when he left the hotel.

At trial, the court held that the hotel violated a common law duty of care to protect patrons from "danger of personal injury, foreseeable as a result of the eviction". The duty, the trial judge found, could have easily been discharged by calling the police or arrange for a safe way home.

The Supreme Court upheld much of the trial judge's ruling. Ritchie J. found that the hotel was aware of Menow's behaviour yet still assisted him in becoming intoxicated, which they ought to have known might result in danger to Menow. This awareness should have "seized them with a duty to be careful not to serve him with repeated drinks after the effects of what he had already consumed should have been obvious." The breach of duty was a result of both a failure to protect Menow once he became intoxicated and a failure to ensure he did not become intoxicated in the first place.

{{Legal education in the United States}}
A '''legal clinic''' (also '''law clinic''' or '''law school clinic''') is a [[law school]] program providing hands-on-legal experience to law school students and [[Legal aid|services]] to various clients.  Clinics are usually directed by clinical professors.&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edition,'' "clinical legal studies," (St. Paul, Minn: West Publishing Co., 1990), 254&lt;/ref&gt;  Legal clinics typically do ''[[pro bono]]'' work in a particular area, providing free legal services to clients.

A legal clinic or law clinic is a nonprofit law practice serving the public interest. Legal clinics originated as a method of practical teaching of law school students, but today they encompass also free [[legal aid]] with no academic links.&lt;ref&gt;M. Yakasai, "Meaning of a Legal Clinic',2016&lt;/ref&gt; There are practice-based law clinics with no academic link which provide hands-on skills to lawyers, judges and non-lawyers on practical ethical dimensions of the law at the same time offer free public defence legal services.&lt;ref&gt;International organizations,lextern web,2017(https://www.lexternweb.org/international-organizations)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Need and importance==
According to Avani Bansal, In cases where parties cannot afford a [[lawyer]] and are provided legal services by the state, the quality of that legal representation is often questionable. Therefore the need for clinical legal education, or establishing [[legal aid]] clinics at law schools, where law students can provide [[legal advice]] to indigent people.&lt;ref name="Avani Bansal"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bansal|first1=Avani|title=Clinical legal education as a means to means to advance to advance access to justice in India|url=http://www.livelaw.in/clinical-legal-education-means-advance-access-justice-india/ Part 1 &amp; Part 2|website=livelaw.in|publisher=livelaw.in|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals, objectives &amp; Methods ==
Students typically provide assistance with research, drafting legal arguments, and meeting with clients. In many cases, one of the clinic's professors will show up for [[oral argument]] before the Court. However, many jurisdictions have "student practice" rules that allow law-clinic students to appear and argue in court.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XX,http://www.lasc.org/rules/supreme/RuleXX.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uniform Local Rules Of The United States District Courts For The Eastern, Middle, And Western Districts Of Louisiana, LR83.2.13, {{cite web |url=http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/LocalRules/Civil_83.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703173017/http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/LocalRules/Civil_83.htm |archivedate=2008-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Areas of service==
[[File:Legal clinic - case files.JPG|thumb|Legal clinic - case files at [[Palacký University]] Faculty of Law Legal Clinic]]
Clinical legal studies exist in diverse areas such as immigration law, [[environmental law]], intellectual property, housing, criminal defense, criminal prosecution, American Indian law, human rights and international criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uu.nl/legalclinic "404 - Universiteit Utrecht", University Utrecht School of Law Clinical Programme on Conflict, Human Rights and International Justice], retrieved March 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Clinics sometimes sue big companies and government entities, which has led to pushback in courts and legislatures, including attempts to put limits on whom clinics can sue without losing state subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/us/04lawschool.html?hp|title=School Law Clinics Face a Backlash|last=Urbina|first=Ian|date=April 3, 2010|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|access-date=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Pro Bono Net===
[[Pro Bono Net]] are online [[Legal aid]] services, in some cases supported by legal clinics.&lt;ref name="Avani Bansal" /&gt;

==Obstacles==
While in many jurisdictions have "student practice" rules that allow law-clinic students to appear and argue in court.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XX,http://www.lasc.org/rules/supreme/RuleXX.asp&lt;/ref&gt;, in some countries like India law students are still studying at law schools, they cannot represent the clients in courts by themselves.&lt;ref name="Avani Bansal" /&gt; 

According to Avani Bansal in many law schools, clinical legal education is imparted without the support of practical component and lacks policy. Participation in many of these legal clinics lacks academic credits. Lack of resources, lack of trained faculty for the purpose, lack of involvement of [[Bar council|Bar Council]] Members leads to ineffective and weak clinical legal education in countries like India. Communities around are not informed so are not involved. All these aspects frustrate the effective purpose of the Legal clinic in the sense that it neither trains students in practice nor it reaches to the public.&lt;ref name="Avani Bansal" /&gt;

A '''legal document assistant''' ('''LDA''', also commonly known as "document technician," "legal document preparer," "legal technician," "online legal document provider" and "legal document clerk")&lt;ref&gt;[http://legaldocumentassistant.blogspot.com/2007/12/whats-in-name.html SCRIBE: What's in a Name?]&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States is a non-lawyer authorized to assist with the preparation of [[legal instrument]]s. Unlike a [[paralegal]], legal document assistants do not work under the supervision of an attorney.

A Legal Document Assistant is an American phenomenon created in response to the most strict licensing laws for attorneys in the world. The job was created by using the doctrine of ''pro se'' to enable someone to help another prepare a legal document. Except for Louisiana and Puerto Rico, in the United States only an attorney can advise and draft a legal document for another. With the self-help ''pro se'' concept and stock legal forms the Legal Document Preparer profession was born.

The role of a Legal Document Assistant varies significantly across legal jurisdictions, and therefore can be treated here in only the most general terms. Some acts performed by Legal Document Assistants may be lawful in one jurisdiction and prohibited in other jurisdictions.

== History ==

Many LDAs view their professional history as descending directly from that of the [[scribe]] or [[scrivener]]. The terms "legal scrivener" and "independent [[paralegal]]" were commonly used in the US from the late 1970s until 1994.  In that year, the [[Bankruptcy Reform Act]] was signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]].  Among other provisions, it banned the use of the word "legal," in any form, to describe the services provided by non-attorney document preparers, and also specifically created the term "[[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy petition]] preparer."  This forced many US LDAs who assisted with [[bankruptcies]] to search for new terms to describe their profession.

Although [[California]] became the first state to formally regulate LDAs, the first licensing proposal was the [[Oregon Scrivener's Act]], introduced in the [[Oregon]] legislature in 1985. In 2003, [[Arizona]] began certifying individuals and businesses who prepare documents through its "Legal Document Preparer Program".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Legal Document Preparer Program certifies non-attorney legal document preparers in Arizona who provide document preparation assistance and services to individuals and entities not represented by an attorney.  Legal document preparers may provide general legal information but may not give legal advice.
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as ''certified legal document preparers'' (CLDP).

== Florida ==

It is commonly accepted{{whom|date=February 2017}} that the first well-known LDA was [[Rosemary Furman]]; Furman, a [[Florida]] resident had been a legal secretary for about 35 years, when she was laid off in 1976.  Not finding anyone willing to hire a middle-aged legal assistant, she began offering her services as a free-lance paralegal.  Within a short time, she had developed a thriving business, not, as she had originally anticipated, from lawyers needing assistance, but instead from consumers wanting to purchase legal documents directly, to represent themselves in matters such as divorces, name changes and guardianship proceedings. When Furman was charged by the [[Florida Supreme Court]] in 1977 for "unauthorized practice of law," she became somewhat of a national ''cause célèbre''.  In the long run however, she was unsuccessful, and after having her request for review by the [[United States Supreme Court]] denied, she elected to close her business and retire, rather than be sent to jail for contempt.

Furman’s misconduct went far beyond merely practicing law without a license.  As noted by the [[Supreme Court of Florida]], the uncontradicted testimony of her former customers was that she encouraged them to falsify information in marriage dissolution papers and to conceal relevant information.  Her purported reasons were various: it’s none of their damn business, they don’t pay attention to the information, or you’ll (either) get less or give more money in the dissolution judgment.  In one instance, she advised a wife who had been married, divorced, and remarried to the same husband but could not remember the date of the remarriage to insert the date of the dissolved first marriage as the date of the second marriage in the petition for dissolution.  Another couple who disagreed on whether their stipulation on child support provided for $35 per week or $35 per child was advised that it didn’t matter because the judge awarded whatever he wanted to anyway.  In a particularly egregious instance, she assisted a husband seeking a marriage dissolution in preparing a stipulation in which he agreed to child custody by the wife.  While the dissolution petition and child custody stipulation were pending before the court, the husband became aware that the wife was abusing the children, took actual custody of the children, and consulted Furman about withdrawing his stipulated agreement on child custody.  Furman advised him not to do so because this would require “starting over” on the dissolution petition and he should let the social agency handle the child abuse and custody problem.&lt;ref&gt;The Florida Bar v. Furman, 451 So. 2d 808, 809-810 (Fla. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

Current case law in Florida has established that a non-lawyer may sell blank legal forms, type legal forms completed by hand, and sell general printed legal information. The non-lawyer can not, however, advise a customer how to complete a legal form, as this constitutes the practice of law.&lt;ref&gt;Fla. Bar v. We the People Forms &amp; Serv. Ctr. of Sarasota, Inc., 883 So. 2d 1280 (Fla. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Florida Association of Legal Document Preparers - FALDP - http://www.faldp.org - is a statewide trade association of dedicated document preparers. Founded in 2010, FALDP has around 100 members statewide. The association continues to thrive, and offers online courses explaining how to prepare various documents. The courses, while targeted towards document preparers helping consumers, are available to anyone who enrolls -- membership is not required. Education and experience requirements for joining the association are posted on the site.

In 2015 FALDP began a certification program for its members. Members in good standing may earn certification by passing a basic skills/ knowledge test; passing a focus area test; and completing ten Continuing Education Units (CEUs) per year. CEUs can be earned in a variety of ways including taking online courses, participating in webinars, attending FALDP's annual conference, and outreach to consumers.

== Oregon ==

At about the same time that Rosemary Furman was receding from the public eye however, another woman began gaining national prominence for her role in the self-help legal profession.  Peggy Muse, unlike Rosemary Furman, was not a retired legal secretary, in fact, she had never worked in a lawyer's office.  An attractive woman in her 30s (in fact, a former model), Muse had been a consumer advocate for a small community newspaper in [[Medford, Oregon|Medford]], [[Oregon]], where she lived with her three school-age children.  When the column was canceled by the newspaper, she rented a small office space above a dress shop, and outfitted with a card table and two chairs, opened the Consumer Sounding Board (CSB); intended to be a private consumer advocacy agency, CSB soon grew into the business of preparing legal documents, as Muse discovered that one of the most common consumer complaints, related to the high cost of legal representation for relatively minor needs.

After establishing her office in Medford into a full-time storefront operation, with several employees, Muse moved to Oregon's largest city, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], and opened a second CSB office.  Within a few years, she began to receive national attention, as well as attention from the Oregon State Bar.  She was featured in a front-page sectional article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', which in addition to detailing her Portland and Medford offices, also followed her in her mobile "paralegal van," as she went with an employee to set up shop in a small-town parking lot for a day, to offer her services to the residents of a rural area.  Shortly after this, and after being featured in a segment of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'', she began offering franchises, as well as setting up additional company-owned offices.  At its height, CSB had a total of 14 offices in 4 Western states.  In 1993 however, after a 15-year legal battle, the Oregon Bar succeeded in convincing a judge in Medford to sentence Muse to jail for 20 days.  Following that experience, she divested herself of her remaining offices, and moved to California, where she remains today, having been one of the first persons licensed there as an LDA, following the 1998 licensing act.

== California ==

Legal Document Assistants in the State of [[California]] are still sometimes incorrectly referred to as "independent paralegals" or "freelance paralegals," even though it has been more than a decade since those terms became obsolete by law. On September 30, 1998 Governor [[Pete Wilson]] signed California State Senate Bill SB1418, regulating the legal document preparation profession in the State of California, and creating a new formal title, Legal Document Assistant (LDA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/97-98/bill/sen/sb_1401-1450/sb_1418_bill_19980930_chaptered.html California State Senate Bill SB1418] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709023955/http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/97-98/bill/sen/sb_1401-1450/sb_1418_bill_19980930_chaptered.html |date=2012-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many LDAs have paralegal education and experience, in California they are not the same as paralegals. Under California law, a [[paralegal]] is prohibited from providing services directly to the consumer. Paralegals may only be employed by an attorney, law firm, corporation, governmental agency, or other entity; and work under the direct supervision of a licensed attorney within the scope of that employment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&amp;group=06001-07000&amp;file=6450-6456 California Business and Professions Code, Sections 6450-6456] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503130111/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&amp;group=06001-07000&amp;file=6450-6456 |date=2009-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/legalservices/paralegals/def98.html American Bar Association Standing Committee on Paralegals]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike paralegals, LDAs are authorized by law to provide legal document preparation services to consumers, after complying with the registration and bonding requirements. Neither paralegals nor LDAs are permitted to engage in the [[practice of law]].

LDAs are not lawyers and do not offer legal advice, discuss legal strategies, answer questions of a legal nature, select forms for the consumer, or appear in court on the consumer’s behalf. They are professionals, qualified through education, training or work experience, authorized to assist consumers representing themselves in legal matters by preparing and processing the necessary legal documents.

A Legal Document Assistant, as defined by the California Business &amp; Professions Code (Section 6400 (c)) is: "Any person who is otherwise not exempted and who provides, or assists in providing, or offers to provide, or offers to assist in providing, for compensation, any self-help service to a member of the public who is representing himself or herself in a legal matter, or who holds himself or herself out as someone who offers that service or has that authority, or a corporation, partnership, association, or other entity that employs or contracts with any person who is not otherwise exempted who, as part of his or her responsibilities, provides, or assists in providing, or offers to provide, or offers to assist in providing, for compensation, any self-help service to a member of the public who is representing himself or herself in a legal matter or holds himself or herself out as someone who offers that service or has that authority."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&amp;group=06001-07000&amp;file=6400-6401.6 California Business and Professions Code, Sections 6400-6401.6]&lt;/ref&gt;

The California Association of Legal Document Assistants was established in August 1986, and was formerly known as “California Association of Independent Paralegals” (CAIP). CALDA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calda.org/who-we-are CALDA]&lt;/ref&gt; is the time-honored organization for legal document preparation professionals and supporters of this profession. CALDA promotes and encourages high standards of ethical and professional conduct while offering its members educational opportunities, professional alliance, a website business listing, member forum exchange, and attorney approved printed brochure materials. Commitment is given to increasing public access to the legal system and CALDA recognizes the Legal Document Assistant’s professional responsibilities to the public, to the legal system, and to colleagues.

CALDA promotes growth, development, and recognition of the Legal Document Assistants’ profession as an integral partner in the delivery of legal services. Membership consists of registered and bonded California Legal Document Assistants, Bankruptcy Petition Preparers, Social Security Disability Advocates, SSI Advocates, and sustaining members who support and enhance the LDA profession.

CALDA’s Board of directors is composed of members who volunteer to help run and manage this organization: Nancy Newlin (President), Connie Crokett (Vice President), Jeannie Bruins (Chief Financial Officer), Carol Ludlow (Secretary), Robin Schumacher&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robinschumacher.com/ Robin Schumacher LDA]&lt;/ref&gt; (Vice President of Central Valley Chapter-CALDA), Angela Grijalva &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.saclegalprep.com/meet-the-owner.html]&lt;/ref&gt;(Newsletter Chair) and (President of the Capital City Chapter), Jim Wilroy (Legislative Chair) and Carlo Perez (Educational Chair).

== Louisiana ==

Certain types of legal documents can be drafted by a [[notary public]] in the State of Louisiana. Louisiana notaries public prepare and draft legal documents of a noncontentious nature (i.e. not for court cases) such as wills, trusts, marriage contracts, articles of incorporation, estate inventories, mortgages, real estate sales contracts, powers of attorney, etc. Aside from drafting, they are also authorized to make inventories, property descriptions, take company minutes, and appraise and [[conveyancing|convey]] real estate. Louisiana, along with Puerto Rico, have this exception because prior to inclusion in the United States, both were (and continue to be) under the [[civil law (system)|civil law]] [[legal system]]. Under civil law, [[civil law notary|notaries]] are lawyers, which is why in Louisiana notaries are appointed for life and used to be licensed before the advent of practice of law statutes in the 1930s. Louisiana notaries public are not required to be attorneys or otherwise trained in law; however, they do have to pass an extensive exam on notarial law (i.e., the areas of law a notary can draft for - property law, estate law, family law, etc.), they must sign and witness the signing of the documents they draft ([[act (document)|notarial acts]]), and register and file those documents with the local court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lna.org/explore.cfm/home/100001?s=1001265  Louisiana Notary Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future ==

As the preparation of legal documents becomes more and more computerized, the function of non-attorney document preparers has become less dependent upon the preparer's individual skills, and more upon the quality of their software.  By the same token, the continued increase of the availability of document software, legal aid websites, and the like, make it more and more likely that persons with some level of computer skills will be able to prepare and file legal documents without attorneys, and in fact, may not need even the limited assistance offered by LDAs, to prepare competent and quality legal documents.  In fact, in the late 1990s, the Texas Bar Association, recognizing the threat that this trend represents to the pocketbooks of lawyers,&lt;ref&gt;?&lt;/ref&gt; sued [[Nolo Press]], the country's leading publisher of self-help books and software, for alleging that Nolo was guilty of [[practicing law without a license]].  Although the Federal Circuit Court hearing the case initially ruled in favor of the State Bar, ultimately, they were unsuccessful, as the Texas Legislature passed a law which clearly established that selling books and software on legal subjects could not be considered practicing law. The preceding sentence exemplifies why the Texas Bar Association's concern with "quality legal documents" prepared by non-attorneys extends beyond the mere "threat that this trend represents of [sic] the pocketbooks of lawyers," since the above mentioned law - Tex. Gov't. Ann. § 81.101 provides:

&lt;small&gt;:(a) In this chapter the “practice of law” means the preparation of a pleading or other document incident to an action or special proceeding or the management of the action or proceeding on behalf of a client before a judge in court ''as well as a service rendered out of court'', including the giving of advice or the rendering of any service requiring the use of legal skill or knowledge, ''such as preparing a will, contract, or other instrument, the legal effect of which under the facts and conclusions involved must be carefully determined''.

(b) The definition in ''this section is not exclusive and does not deprive the judicial branch of the power and authority'' under both this chapter and the adjudicated cases ''to determine whether other services and acts not enumerated may constitute the practice of law''.

(c) In this chapter, the “''practice of law” does not include the design, creation, publication, distribution, display, or sale, including publication, distribution, display, or sale by means of an Internet web site, of written materials, books, forms, computer software, or similar products'' '''''if'' the products clearly and conspicuously state that the products are not a substitute for the advice of an attorney'''. This subsection does not authorize the use of the products or similar media in violation of Chapter 83 and does not affect the applicability or enforceability of that chapter.&lt;/small&gt;
 
At the very least, it appears that the statute exempts only such books and software which "clearly and conspicuously state that the products are not a substitute for the advice of an attorney." Thus, under certain facts and circumstances, it appears that such software and/or books ''could'' still constitute the unauthorized practice of law absent a disclaimer as ''required'' by the statute. For a discussion of the specific facts that led a federal court to conclude that the developer, publisher, and marketer of Quicken Family Lawyer had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in Texas (prior to enactment of section C, above), the reader is referred to ''Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee v. Parsons'', 1999 WL 47235 (N.D. Tex. 1999)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/law/st_org/iptf/exhibits/1999031701_uplc_v_parsons.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also 179 F.3d 956 (5th Cir. 1999) (Vacating permanent injunction and remanding to the district court in light of subsequent enactment )&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York, "quality" legal documents are available online through the state court system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courthelp/forms.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previous laws==
The "Indian Motor Vehicles Act, 1914"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helplinelaw.com/docs/the-motor-vehicle-act-1988&lt;/ref&gt; was a central legislation passed and applicable in [[British Raj|British India]]. Some [[Princely state|princely states]] followed suit, with local modifications.&lt;ref name="Orissa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orissatransport.nic.in/about_omvd.htm|title=An efficient and vibrant Road Transport System|publisher=Orissa Motor Vehicles Department|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motor vehicles were first introduced in India towards the end of the 19th century, and the 1914 Act was the first legislation to regulate their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/ncrwc/finalreport/v2b3-5.htm|title=Background Paper on Barriers to Inter-State Trade and Commerce: The Case of Road Transport|first1=Bibek |last1= Debroy |first2=P.D. |last2=Kaushik|publisher=Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Contemporary Studies|accessdate=6 October 2014}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had 18 sections, and gave local governments the responsibility of registering and licensing vehicles and motorists, and enforcing regulations.&lt;ref name="Orissa" /&gt; It was replaced by the ''Motor Vehicles Act, 1939'', which came into force in 1940.

===Amendments===
====Indian Motor Vehicles Acts, from 1914-2016 ====
The "Indian Motor Vehicles Act, 1914" was amended by the "Indian Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1920" (Act No. XXVII of 1920) passed by the [[Imperial Legislative Council]]. It received assent from the [[Governor-General of India|Governor General of India]] on 2 September 1920. The Act amended sections 11 and 18 of the 1914 Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Imperial Legislative Council|authorlink1=Imperial Legislative Council|author2=Governor General of India|authorlink2=Governor-General of India||title=The Acts passed by the Governor General of India in Council in the year 1920|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/legislative/textofcentralacts/1920.pdf|website=www.lawmin.nic.in|publisher=Superintendent Government Printing, India|accessdate=6 July 2014|location=Calcutta|page=166|year=1921}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was amended again by the "Indian Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1924" (Act No. XV of 1924). The Act received assent from the Governor General on 18 September 1924. It had the title, "An Act further to amend the Indian Motor Vehicles Act, 1914, for certain purposes" and amended section 11 of the 1914 Act by inserting the words "and the duration for which" after the words "area in which" in clause (a) of subsection (2) of section 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Imperial Legislative Council|authorlink1=Imperial Legislative Council|author2=Governor General of India|authorlink2=Governor-General of India|title=Titles of the Acts of the Indian Legislature and of the Governor General for the year 1924|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/legislative/textofcentralacts/1924.pdf|website=www.lawmin.nic.in|publisher=Superintendent Government Printing, India|accessdate=6 July 2014|location=Calcutta|page=211}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motor vehicle act has again been amended in 2016.

====Indian Motor Vehicles Act,2017 ====
This will be a significant upgrade to the motor vehicle laws. It envisages body cams on traffic cops and RTO officials to check corruption and 7 year imprisonment instead of current 2 years for drink-driving deaths, mandatory 3rd party insurance for all vehicles, and stiffer penalties for traffic violations to reduce the accident rates.&lt;ref name=stop1&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/62219376.cms Panel wants body cams on traffic cops, RTO officials], [[The Economic Times|Economic Times]], 23 Dec 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6485">The '''Charter of the International Military Tribunal – Annex to the Agreement for the prosecution and punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis''' (usually referred to as the '''Nuremberg Charter''' or '''London Charter''') was the decree issued by the [[European Advisory Commission]] on 8 August 1945 that set down the rules and procedures by which the [[Nuremberg trials]] were to be conducted.

The charter stipulated that crimes of the European  [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis Powers]] could be tried. Three categories of crimes were defined: [[crimes against peace]], [[war crime]]s, and [[crimes against humanity]]. Article 8 of the charter also stated that holding an official position was no defense to war crimes. [[Nuremberg Defense|Obedience to orders]] could only be considered in mitigation of punishment if the Tribunal determined that justice so required.

The [[criminal procedure]] used by the Tribunal was closer to [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] than to [[common law]], with a trial before a panel of judges rather than a [[jury trial]] and with wide allowance for [[hearsay]] evidence. Defendants who were found guilty could [[appeal]] the verdict to the [[Allied Control Council]]. In addition, they would be permitted to present evidence in their defense and to [[cross-examination|cross-examine]] witnesses.

The Charter was developed by the European Advisory Commission under the authority of the [[Moscow Declaration#Statement on Atrocities|Moscow Declaration: Statement on Atrocities]], which was agreed at the [[Moscow Conference (1943)]]. It was drawn up in London, following the surrender of Germany on [[VE Day]]. It was drafted by [[Robert H. Jackson]], [[Robert Falco]], and [[Iona Nikitchenko]] of the European Advisory Commission and issued on 8 August 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b39614.html Charter of the International Military Tribunal - Annex to the Agreement for the prosecution and punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis]. United Nations Refugee Agency&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charter and its definition of crimes against peace was also the basis of the [[Finland|Finnish]] law, approved by the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish parliament]] on 11 September 1945, that enabled the [[war-responsibility trials in Finland]].

The Agreement for the prosecution and punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis and the annexed Charter were formally signed by [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|France]], the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]] on 8 August 1945. The Agreement and Charter were subsequently ratified by 19 other Allied states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/States.xsp?xp_viewStates=XPages_NORMStatesParties&amp;xp_treatySelected=87B0BB4A50A64DEAC12563CD002D6AAE Ratifications].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Optiarc''' is a brand of optical desk drives owned by a US company [[Vinpower]], Inc.

Initially Optiarc was established on April 3, 2006 as a [[joint venture]] between [[Sony corporation|Sony Corporation]] (55% shares) and [[NEC Corporation]] (45% shares). The company, named '''Sony NEC Optiarc''', focused on manufacturing optical disk drives primarily for the [[OEM]] desktop and [[notebook PC]] markets.

On September 11, 2008, it was announced that Sony would take over NEC's 45% share, making Optiarc a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sonynec-optiarc.com/company/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218151311/http://www.sonynec-optiarc.com/company/index.html |archive-date=2008-12-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to be called '''Sony Optiarc'''. This took effect on December 5, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sonynec-optiarc.com/company/principles.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124141957/http://www.sonynec-optiarc.com/company/principles.html |archive-date=2010-01-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, Sony closed its Optiarc optical disk division,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crothers|first=Brooke|title=Sony to exit PC-use optical drives, say reports|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-57501393-92/sony-to-exit-pc-use-optical-drives-say-reports/|accessdate=22 May 2014|newspaper=[[CNET]]|date=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carter|first=White|title=Sony Optiarc closed, the subsidiary that manufactures optical drives|url=http://technewspedia.com/sony-optiarc-closed-the-subsidiary-that-manufactures-optical-drives/|accessdate=22 May 2014|newspaper=Technewspedia|date=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; laying off about 400 employees globally.

In 2017, a US company [[Vinpower]], whose main business was manufacturing optical disc duplicators for the commercial market, acquired rights to the Optiarc brand and product line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.myce.com/news/u-s-company-vinpower-digital-claims-resurrecting-optiarc-cddvd-burner-brand-82160/|title=U.S. company VinPower Digital claims to be resurrecting Optiarc CD/DVD burner brand|last=Jan Willem|first=Aldershoff|date=June 19, 2017|work=Myce.com|access-date=April 26, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9951">'''Perverting the course of justice''' is an offence committed when a person prevents [[justice]] from being served on him/herself or on another party. In [[England and Wales]] it is a [[common law offence]], carrying a maximum sentence of [[life imprisonment]]. Statutory versions of the offence exist in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Ireland]], and [[New Zealand]].

==England and Wales==
Doing an act tending and intending to pervert the course of public justice&lt;ref&gt;This name is used in the statement of offence in the form of [[indictment]] approved in R v Williams (K J) 92 Cr App R 158, [1991] Crim LR 205, CA&lt;/ref&gt; is an offence under the [[common law]] of [[England and Wales]].

Perverting the course of justice can be any of three acts:
* Fabricating or [[Spoliation of evidence|disposing]] of evidence
* Intimidating or threatening a [[witness]] or [[juror]]
* Intimidating or threatening a [[judge]]

Also criminal are:
# conspiring with another to pervert the course of justice, and
# intending to pervert the course of justice

This offence, and the subject matter of the related forms of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|criminal conspiracy]], have been referred to as: 
*Perverting the course of justice
*Interfering with the administration of justice
*Obstructing the administration of justice
*Obstructing the course of justice
*Defeating the due course of justice
*Defeating the ends of justice
*[[Effecting a public mischief]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Law Commission (England and Wales)|The Law Commission]]. Criminal Law: Offences relating to the Administration of Justice. Working Paper No 62. HMSO. 1975. Paragraph 10 at page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

This proliferation of alternative names is "somewhat confusing".&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]. 1999. Paragraph 28-23 at page 2261.&lt;/ref&gt;

This offence is also sometimes referred to as "attempting to pervert the course of justice". This is potentially misleading. An attempt to pervert the course of justice is a substantive [[common law offence]] and not an [[inchoate offence]]. It is not a form of the offence of [[attempt]], and it would be erroneous to charge it as being contrary to section 1(1) of the ''[[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]]''.&lt;ref&gt;R v Williams (K J) 92 Cr App R 158, [1991] Crim LR 205, CA&lt;/ref&gt;

This offence is [[triable only on indictment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/perverting_the_course_of_justice/ "Perverting the Course of Justice]. Sentencing Manual. Crown Prosecution Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In [[Canada]], the equivalent offence is referred to as "obstructing justice".  It is set out s 139 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]:

{{quote|

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8203">In the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] (a [[U.S. state]]), there are three recognized '''political parties''' and an additional 25 '''political designations''' in which [[Voter registration in the United States|registered voters]] may choose to enroll. Voters may also choose to remain as "[[unenrolled voter]]s" (i.e., [[Independent (voter)|independents]]). [[List of political parties in the United States|Political parties]] hold [[primary election]]s, while political designations do not. A political designation is a one-to-three word descriptive term which may appear next to candidates' names on election ballots. To be recognized as a political designation, fifty registered voters must file a document with the state seeking this status.

==Background==
In Massachusetts, election ballots include the candidates' names followed by either the candidates' party or his or her "political designation"&amp;mdash;a one-to-three word description that must be a other one-to-three word term whose recognition has been requested by fifty or more registered voters. In many cases, non-party designations include the word "party" in the designation. However, only three such designations actually correspond to organizations that are recognized by Massachusetts as political parties: the [[Massachusetts Republican Party|Republican Party]], the [[Massachusetts Democratic Party|Democratic Party]], and the [[Libertarian Party of Massachusetts|Libertarian Party]].&lt;ref name="sos"/&gt;

==Enrolled and unenrolled voters==
In Massachusetts, [[Voter registration in the United States|registered voters]] may choose to (1) enroll in a political party; (2) enroll with a political designation; or (3) choose to be an [[unenrolled voter]] (i.e., an [[independent (voter)|independent]]).&lt;ref name="sos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rhodes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rhodes|first1=George|title=In Mass., there's even a Pizza Party|url=http://www.thesunchronicle.com/vip/opinion/columns/rhodes-in-mass-there-s-even-a-pizza-party/article_50ca637a-3cb1-11e5-bdda-e7cb96441501.html|accessdate=8 August 2016|work=Sun Chronicle|date=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voters may change their enrollment status with their election official, with a deadline twenty days before an election.&lt;ref name="sos"/&gt;

All registered voters may vote in general elections. Massachusetts voters enrolled in a particular party may vote only in that party's [[Primary elections|primary]], and cannot cross-over to vote in another party's primary,&lt;ref name="sos"/&gt; but "unenrolled" voters may cast a primary ballot for one of the three parties.&lt;ref name="NReading"&gt;[http://www.northreadingma.gov/town-clerk/pages/political-parties-and-political-designations Political Parties and Political Designations, As of 12/31/2014], Town of North Reading (accessed August 27, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/primary-types.aspx State Primary Election Types], [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] (July 21, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Political designations are treated as "unenrolled" voters for primary purposes, and so they too may choose to vote in one of the party primaries.&lt;ref name="NReading"/&gt;

Under Massachusetts law, a political designation is created when fifty registered Massachusetts voters "file a form with the [[Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts|Secretary of the Commonwealth]] requesting that they, or any other voters, may change their registration to such designation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cityofboston.gov/elections/vote/faq.asp Frequently Asked Questions for New Voters], City of Boston Election Department (accessed August 27, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; These non-party political designations may field candidates for statewide office, if they petition with a sufficient number of signatures (10,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winger|first1=Richard|title=Libertarian Petition in Massachusetts Has Enough Valid Signatures|url=http://ballot-access.org/2016/08/08/libertarian-petition-in-massachusetts-has-enough-valid-signatures/|accessdate=8 August 2016|work=[[Ballot Access News]]|date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various political designations have generally small membership, although they have attracted some media attention.&lt;ref name="wm"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quinn|first1=Tom|title=Tired of politics as usual?

{{Rape}}

[[Pregnancy]] is a potential result of [[rape]]. It has been [[Wartime sexual violence|studied in the context of war]], particularly [[Genocidal rape|as a tool for genocide]], as well as other unrelated contexts, such as rape by a stranger, [[statutory rape]], [[incest]], and [[Teenage pregnancy|underage pregnancy]]. The current [[scientific consensus]] is that rape is at least as likely to lead to pregnancy as [[sexual consent|consensual sexual intercourse]], with some studies suggesting rape may actually result in higher rates of pregnancy than consensual intercourse.&lt;ref name=CNN22-08-2012&gt;Dellorto, Danielle (22 August 2012). [http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/21/health/rape-pregnancy/index.html "Experts: Rape does not lower odds of pregnancy"]. [[CNN Health]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters-20-08-2012&gt;Begley, Sharon; Heavey, Susan (20 August 2012). [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-20/news/sns-rt-us-usa-politics-abortion-claimbre87j0xj-20120820_1_pregnancy-female-orgasm-claim "Rape trauma as barrier to pregnancy has no scientific basis"]. [[Reuters]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gottschall03/&gt;

Rape can cause difficulties during and after pregnancy, with potential negative consequences for both the victim and a resulting child. Medical treatment following a rape includes testing for, preventing, and managing pregnancy. A woman who becomes pregnant after a rape may face a decision about whether to raise the child, give the child up for [[adoption]] or [[parenting]] by others, or to have an [[abortion]]. In some countries where abortion is illegal after rape and incest, over 90% of pregnancies in girls age 15 and under are due to rape by family members.&lt;ref name="Schiffman" /&gt;

The false belief that pregnancy can almost never result from rape was widespread for centuries. In Europe, from medieval times well into the 18th century a man could use a woman's pregnancy as a legal defense to "prove" that he could not have raped her, since her pregnancy was thought to mean that she had enjoyed the sex and, therefore, consented to it. In recent decades, some [[pro-life]] organizations and politicians (such as [[Todd Akin]]) who [[opposition to legal abortion|oppose legal abortion]] in cases of rape have advanced claims that pregnancy very rarely arises from rape, and that the practical relevance of such exceptions to [[abortion law]] is, therefore, limited or non-existent.&lt;ref name=Clowes97/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT-21-08-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=NJ-21-08-2012/&gt;

== Rape-pregnancy incidence==

Any female capable of [[ovulation]] may become pregnant after rape by a virile male.

Estimates of the numbers of pregnancies from rape vary widely.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Geiger, [http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/23/news/la-pn-statistics-on-rape-and-pregnancy-are-complicated-20120822 Statistics on rape and pregnancy are complicated], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 23, 2012.  Retrieved 24 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sue Owen, [http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/aug/15/wendy-davis/surveys-show-wide-disagreement-number-rape-related/ Surveys show wide disagreement on number of rape-related pregnancies per year], Politifact, ''Austin American Statesman'', August 15, 2013.  Retrieved 24 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent estimates suggest that rape conception happens between 25,000 and 32,000 times each year in the U.S.
&lt;!-- STUDIES IN THE US --&gt;
In a 1996 three-year [[longitudinal study]] of 4,000 American women, physician Melisa Holmes estimated from data from her study that forced sexual intercourse causes over 32,000 pregnancies in the United States each year.&lt;ref name="AJOG"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0002-9378(96)70141-2 |title=Rape-related pregnancy: Estimates and descriptive characteristics from a national sample of women |year=1996 |last1=Holmes |first1=Melisa M. |last2=Resnick |first2=Heidi S. |last3=Kilpatrick |first3=Dean G. |last4=Best |first4=Connie L. |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=175 |issue=2 |pages=320–4; discussion 324–5 |pmid=8765248}} (abstract also available at NIH [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8765248 pubmed site] Retrieved 24 May 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Physician Felicia H. Stewart and economist James Trussell estimated that the 333,000 assaults and rapes reported in the US in 1998 caused about 25,000 pregnancies, and up to 22,000 of those pregnancies could have been prevented by prompt medical treatment, such as [[emergency contraception]].&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0749-3797(00)00243-9 |title=Prevention of pregnancy resulting from rape: A neglected preventive health measure |year=2000 |last1=Stewart |first1=Felicia H |last2=Trussell |first2=James |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=228–9 |pmid=11064225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rate===

A 1996 study of 44 cases of rape-related pregnancy estimated that in the United States, the pregnancy rate is 5.0% per rape among victims of reproductive age (aged 12 to 45).&lt;ref name="AJOG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thornhill"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thornhill |first1=Randy |last2=Palmer |first2=Craig T. |year=2001 |title=A Natural History of Rape: Biological Bases of Sexual Coercion |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-70083-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xH6v-nB6EegC&amp;printsec=frontcover|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1987 study also found a 5% pregnancy rate from rape among 18- to 24-year-old college students in the US.&lt;ref name="koss1987"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.55.2.162 |title=The scope of rape: Incidence and prevalence of sexual aggression and victimization in a national sample of higher education students |year=1987 |last1=Koss |first1=Mary P. |last2=Gidycz |first2=Christine A. |last3=Wisniewski |first3=Nadine |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=162–70 |pmid=3494755}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 study placed the rape-related pregnancy rate at around 3–5%.{{sfn|Hazelwood and Burgess|2009|p=28}}

&lt;!-- OTHER COUNTRIES --&gt;

&lt;!-- HIGHER CONCEPTION RATES --&gt;
Psychologist Robert L. Smith states that some studies have reported "unusually high rates of conception following rape".&lt;ref name="Smith2005" /&gt; He cites a paper by C.A. Fox and Beatrice Fox, reporting that biologist Alan Sterling Parkes had speculated in personal correspondence that "there is a high conception rate in rape, where hormonal release, due to fear or anger, could produce reflex ovulation".&lt;ref name="fox1971" /&gt; Smith also cites veterinary scientist Wolfgang Jöchle, who "proposed that rape may induce ovulation in human females".&lt;ref name="Jöchle1973" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jöchle1975" /&gt; Literary scholar [[Jonathan Gottschall]] and economist Tiffani Gottschall argued in a 2003 ''[[Human Nature (journal)|Human Nature]]'' article that previous studies of rape-pregnancy statistics were not directly comparable to pregnancy rates from consensual intercourse, because the comparisons were largely uncorrected for such factors as the use of [[contraception]]. Adjusting for these factors, they estimated that rapes are about twice as likely to result in pregnancies (7.98%) as "consensual, unprotected penile-vaginal intercourse" (2–4%). They discuss a variety of possible explanations and advance the hypothesis that rapists tend to target victims with biological "cues of high fecundity" or subtle indications of ovulation.&lt;ref name=Gottschall03&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12110-003-1014-0 |laysummary=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79895.html |laysource=Politico |laydate=21 August 2012 |title=Are per-incident rape-pregnancy rates higher than per-incident consensual pregnancy rates? |year=2003 |last1=Gottschall |first1=Jonathan A. |last2=Gottschall |first2=Tiffani A. |journal=Human Nature |volume=14 |pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- LOWER RATES FROM RAPE --&gt;
In contrast, psychologists Tara Chavanne and Gordon Gallup Jr., citing unpublished dissertations by Rogel&lt;ref name="Rogel1976" /&gt; and Morgan,&lt;ref name="Morgan1981" /&gt; argued that female [[adaptation]]s reduce the likelihood of rape during fertile periods.&lt;ref name="Chavanne" /&gt; A 1995 study of women who became pregnant after rape found that 60% had been impregnated during consensual intercourse.&lt;ref name="thornhill"/&gt; Anthropologist [[Daniel Fessler]] disputed these findings, saying, "analysis of conception rates reveals that the probability of conception following rape does not differ from that following consensual coitus".&lt;ref name="fessler2003" /&gt;

===Sociobiological theories of rape pregnancy===
{{See also|Sociobiological theories of rape}}
[[Sociobiologists]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] have hypothesized that causing pregnancy by rape may be a [[mating strategy]] in humans, as a way for males to ensure the survival of their genes by passing them on to future generations.&lt;ref name="mckibbin"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.12.1.86 |title=Why do men rape? An evolutionary psychological perspective |year=2008 |last1=McKibbin |first1=William F. |last2=Shackelford |first2=Todd K. |last3=Goetz |first3=Aaron T. |last4=Starratt |first4=Valerie G. |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=12 |pages=86–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randy Thornhill and [[Craig T. Palmer]] are key popularizers of this hypothesis. They assert that most rape victims are women of childbearing age and that many cultures treat rape as a crime against the victim's husband. They state that rape victims suffer less emotional distress when they are subjected to more violence, and that married women and women of childbearing age experience greater psychological distress after a rape than do girls, single women or post-menopausal women.&lt;ref name="thornhill2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thornhill |first1=Randy |last2=Palmer |first2=Craig T |year=2000 |title=Why men rape |journal=The Sciences |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=30–6 |issn=0036-861X |oclc=93004665 | doi = 10.1002/j.2326-1951.2000.tb03465.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rape-pregnancy rates are crucial in evaluating these theories, because a high or low pregnancy rate from rape would determine whether such adaptations are favored or disfavored by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=Gottschall03/&gt;

=== Statutory rape, incest and underage pregnancy ===
{{main|statutory rape|incest|teenage pregnancy}}
In 1995–96, the journal ''Family Planning Perspectives'' published a study by the [[Guttmacher Institute]], a sexual health research and policy organization, on [[statutory rape]] (sexual intercourse with a minor) and resulting pregnancies. It drew on other research&lt;ref name="Landry"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David J. |last1=Landry |first2=Jacqueline Darroch |last2=Forrest |title=How Old Are U.S. Fathers? |journal=Family Planning Perspectives |pmid=7589357 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2715995.html |year=1995 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=159–61, 165 |doi=10.2307/2136260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.86.4.565 |title=The ages of fathers in California adolescent births, 1993 |year=1996 |last1=Males |first1=Mike |last2=Chew |first2=Kenneth S Y |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=565–8 |pmid=8604792 |pmc=1380562}}&lt;/ref&gt; to conclude that "at least half of all babies born to minor women are fathered by adult men", and that "although relatively small proportions of 13–14-year-olds have had intercourse, those who become sexually active at an early age are especially likely to have experienced coercive sex: Seventy-four percent of women who had intercourse before age 14 and 60% of those who had sex before age 15 report having had a forced sexual experience". Because of difficulties in bringing such cases to trial, however, "data from the period 1975–1978&amp;nbsp;... indicate that, on average, only 413 men were arrested annually for statutory rape in California, even though 50,000 pregnancies occurred among underage women in 1976 alone".&lt;ref&gt;''Michael M. v. Sonoma County Superior Court'', 450 U.S. 464 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; In that state, it was found that two thirds of babies born to school-age mothers were fathered by adult men.&lt;ref name="Landry" /&gt;

&lt;!-- EFFECT OF PRIOR SEXUAL ABUSE ON PREGNANCY--&gt;
Sexual abuse early in life can lead young women to feel a lack of control over their sexual lives, decrease their future likelihood of using [[contraceptive]]s such as condoms, and increase their chances of becoming pregnant or acquiring [[sexually transmitted infections]].{{sfn|Krug|2002|p=162}} A 2007 paper by [[Child Trends]]&lt;ref name="child trends"&gt;[http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/resources/pdf/childhood.pdf Childhood sexual abuse and teen pregnancy: a white paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021041714/http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/resources/pdf/childhood.pdf |date=21 October 2012 }} – Logan ''et al.'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt; examined studies from 2000 to 2006 to identify links between sexual abuse and teenage pregnancy, starting with Blinn-Pike et al.'s 2002 [[metastudy]] of 15 studies since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lynn |last1=Blinn-Pike |first2=Thomas |last2=Berger |first3=Diane |last3=Kuschel |first4=Michael |last4=Kaplan |year=2002 |title=Is There a Causal Link between Maltreatment and Adolescent Pregnancy?

In [[Nicaragua]], between 2000 and 2010, around 172,500 births were recorded for girls under 14, representing around 13% of the 10.3 million births during that period.

Rape has been used as a weapon of [[psychological warfare]] for centuries, to terrorize, humiliate, and undermine the morale of the enemy. Rape was also used as an act of [[ethnic cleansing]] to produce babies that share the perpetrators' ethnicity.{{sfn|Carpenter|2007|pp=1–2}} [[Forced pregnancy]] has been noted in places including [[Bangladesh]], [[Darfur]], and [[Bosnia]].{{sfn|Carpenter|2007|p=2}} More broadly, pregnancy commonly results from wartime rape that was perpetrated without the intention of impregnating the enemy, as has been found in conflicts in [[East Timor]], [[Liberia]], [[Kosovo]], and [[Rwanda]].{{sfn|Carpenter|2007|p=2}}  [[Gita Sahgal]] of [[Amnesty International]] commented that, rather than being primarily about "spoils of war" or sexual gratification, rape is often used in ethnic conflicts as a way for attackers to perpetuate social control and redraw ethnic boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/in_depth/4078677.stm |title=In Depth &amp;#124; How did rape become a weapon of war? |publisher=BBC News |date=8 December 2004 |accessdate=4 March 2010 | first=Laura | last=Smith-Spark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children may be born to women and girls forced to "marry" abductors and occupiers; this happened in the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]] and in the [[Lord's Resistance Army]]'s conflict in [[Uganda]].{{sfn|Carpenter|2007|p=5, 94–95}}

Rape during war is recognized under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820]] as a war crime and a crime against humanity.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/877066/Geneva-Conventions-as-discussed-in-rape-crime |title=Geneva Conventions as Discussed in Rape Crime |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Forced pregnancy" is specifically enumerated as a war crime and crime against humanity in the [[Rome Statute]], which was the "first international criminal tribunal ever officially to criminalize forced pregnancy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmjowl/vol18/iss3/6/ 2012 law-review paper].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- CHILDREN OF WAR RAPE --&gt;
Children born as the result of wartime rape may be identified with the enemy and grow up stigmatized and excluded by their communities; they may be denied basic rights or even killed before reaching adulthood.{{sfn|Carpenter|2007|p=2}} Children are particularly at risk for such abuse when they are visibly identifiable as sharing half their ethnicity with the occupying forces, as in the case of half-Arab children of Darfuri women raped by [[janjaweed]] soldiers as part of the [[war in Darfur]].{{sfn|Carpenter|2007|p=5}}  Children of war rape are also at risk due to neglect by traumatized mothers unable to provide sufficient care.{{sfn|Carpenter|2007|p=5}}

=== Rape of Nanking ===
In 1937 the Japanese army took over [[Nanking]], which at the time was the capital of China. In the resulting seven-week occupation known as the [[Rape of Nanking]], as many as 80,000 people were raped.{{sfn|Smith|2004|p=194–5}} Chinese women and girls of all ages were raped, mutilated, tortured, sexually enslaved, and killed; unknown numbers of them were left pregnant.{{sfn|Smith|2004|p=194–5}} Many pregnant Nanking women killed themselves in 1938, and others committed [[infanticide]] when their babies were born.{{sfn|Smith|2004|p=194–5}} During the rest of the 20th century there was no record of any Chinese woman acknowledging her child as having been born as a result of the Rape of Nanking.{{sfn|Smith|2004|p=194–5}}

=== Bosnian War ===
{{main|Rape in the Bosnian War}}
During the 1992–95 [[Bosnian War]], pregnancy from rape was used to perpetrate [[genocide]]. There were reports of deliberately created "rape camps" intended to impregnate captive Muslim and Croatian women. Women were reported to have been kept in confinement until their pregnancies had advanced beyond a stage at which abortion would be safe.{{sfn|Hazelwood and Burgess|2009|p=34}} In the context of a [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] society, in which children inherit their father's ethnicity, such camps were intended to create a new generation of Serbian children.{{sfn|Hazelwood and Burgess|2009|p=34}} The women's group ''Tresnjevka'' claimed that more than 35,000 women and children were held in such Serb-run camps.&lt;ref name="Tresnjevka"&gt;{{cite book |last= de Brouwer |first=Anne-Marie |title= Supranational Criminal Prosecution of Sexual Violence |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JhY8ROsA39kC&amp;dq=war+rape+in+ancient+times |publisher=Intersentia |isbn=90-5095-533-9 |pages=9–10 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newint.org/issue244/rape.htm new Internationalist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817134853/http://www.newint.org/issue244/rape.htm |date=17 August 2010 }} issue 244, June 1993.

== Treatment and outcomes==
Immediate post-rape protocols call 
for medical professionals to assess the likelihood that a victim will become pregnant in their assessment of the physical damage done to the woman. Protocol for gaining a history of the use of contraceptives, as a woman's use of [[birth control pills]] or other contraceptives before a rape affect her chance of becoming pregnant.{{sfn|Krug|2002|pp=162, 166}}  Treatment protocols also call for clinicians to provide access to [[emergency contraception]] and counseling on abortion in countries where it is legal.{{sfn|Krug|2002|p=166}}  High-dose estrogen pills were tried as an experimental treatment after rape in the 1960s, and in 1972 Canadian physician [[A.

&lt;!-- RAISING THE CHILD --&gt;
When a mother chooses to raise her child conceived in rape, the traumatic effect of the rape and the child's blood relationship to the rapist has the potential to create some psychological challenges, but the circumstance of conception is no guarantee to cause psychological problems.&lt;ref name=Palmer2012&gt;{{cite web |last=Palmer |first=Brian |title=Should a Mother Tell Her Child He Was Conceived in a Rape? |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/08/rape_and_pregnancy_is_it_best_to_tell_a_child_he_was_conceived_in_a_rape_.html |work=Slate |date=22 August 2012 |accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=prewitt-cnn/&gt;

== History ==
Children whose births result from rape have been killed by their mothers at various times in history. During ancient and medieval times, such [[infanticide]] was not prohibited (however, [[penance]] was expected of these mothers in medieval Europe).&lt;ref name=Solomon2012/&gt;

=== Law ===
In contrast to the modern scientific consensus that rape-induced pregnancies are no less likely than any other, beliefs that rape could not lead to pregnancy were widespread in both legal and medical opinion for centuries.&lt;ref name=Heggie12/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tucker-NYT-23-08-2012/&gt; [[Galen]], an ancient Greek physician, believed that a woman must experience pleasure to release "seed" and become pregnant, and could not derive such pleasure from nonconsensual sex.{{sfn|Smith|2004|p=155}} Galen's thinking influenced understanding from medieval England to [[Colonial America]].{{sfn|Smith|2004|p=155}}

[[File:Galen detail.jpg|thumb|left|The Ancient Greek physician [[Galen]]'s belief that women could not conceive without pleasure influenced medical and legal thinking for centuries.]]
The Ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] also believed that female pleasure played a central role in conception.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Female reproduction was, in many ways, viewed through the lens of male reproductive processes, imagining that female organs functioned as inverted versions of male organs, and hence orgasm was required for conception.&lt;ref name=Heggie12/&gt;

Centuries later, in medieval Europe, the belief that pregnancy could not occur without consent was still standard; in fact, conception by a woman was considered a legitimate defense against charges of rape.&lt;ref name=Tucker-NYT-23-08-2012/&gt; The belief was codified in the medieval British law texts ''[[Fleta]]''&lt;ref name=Heggie12/&gt; and ''[[Britton (law)|Britton]]''. ''Britton'' states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If the defendant confesses the fact, but says that the woman at the same time conceived by him, and can prove it, then our will is that it be adjudged no felony, because no woman can conceive if she does not consent."&lt;ref name="Nichols1865"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Medieval literary scholar Corinne Saunders acknowledged a difficulty in determining how widely held was the belief that pregnancy implies consent, but concluded that it influenced "at least some justices", citing a 1313 case in Kent.&lt;ref name="Saunders"&gt;Saunders, Corinne J. (2001). ''Rape and Ravishment in the Literature of Medieval England.'' D. S. Brewer, {{ISBN|978-0-85991-610-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1700s, scientists no longer universally accepted the view that pregnancy was impossible without pleasure, although this view was still common.{{sfn|Smith|2004|p=2–3}} A 1795 British legal text, ''[[Hawkins' Treatise of Pleas of the Crown|Treatise of Pleas of the Crown]]'', disparaged the belief's legal utility and its biological veracity:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Also it hath been said by some to be no rape to force a woman who conceives at the time; for it is said, that if she had not consented, she could not have conceived, but this opinion seems very questionable, not only because the previous violence is no way extenuated by such a subsequent consent, but also because, if it were necessary to shew that the woman did not conceive, the offender could not be tried till such time as it might appear whether she did or did not, and likewise because the philosophy of this notion may very well be doubted of."&lt;ref name=Tucker-NYT-23-08-2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Hawkins, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hLBCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA308&amp;lpg=PA308 Treatise of Pleas of the Crown], seventh edition, p. 308 (London, 1795).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1814 British legal text ''Elements of Medical Jurisprudence'' by [[Samuel Farr (physician)|Samuel Farr]] claimed that conception "probably" could not occur without a woman's "enjoyment", so that an "absolute rape" was unlikely to lead to pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Heggie12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Farr, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vTeHRzdCpJwC&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;ots=-ON8tpZavp&amp;dq=%22So%20that%20if%20an%20absolute%20rape%20were%20to%20be%22&amp;pg=PA25 Elements of Medical Jurisprudence], second edition, chapter IV (London, 1814). See also [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i1cOAAAAQAAJ&amp;rdid=book-i1cOAAAAQAAJ&amp;rdot=1 scanned original book].&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in the US in an 1820 court case in the [[Arkansas Territory]] a man pleaded not guilty to rape charges because the victim became pregnant, but the court rejected the argument:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The old notion that if the woman conceive, it could not be a rape, because she must have in such case have consented, is quite exploded.  Impregnation, it is well known, does not depend on the consciousness or volition of the female. If the uterine organs be in a condition favorable to impregnation, this may take place as readily as if the intercourse was voluntary."&lt;ref name="U.S. v. Dickinson, 1 Hempstead Reporter 1 (1820 Ark. Territory), at 2 n.1."&gt;{{cite book|title=U.S. v. Dickinson, 1 Hempstead Reporter 1 (1820 Ark.

{{see also|Islam and rape|Islam and abortion#Rape}}
Historian Ian Talbot has written about how countries with [[Quran]]-based [[Sharia|Islamic codes]] on rape and pregnancy use Sura [[An-Nur]], verse 2, as a legal basis: "The law of evidence in all sexual crimes required either self-confession or the testimony of four upright (''salah'') Muslim males. In the case of a man, self-confession involved a verbal confession. For women however medical examinations and pregnancy arising from rape were admissible as proof of self-guilt."&lt;ref name="Talbot"&gt;Talbot Ian (1998). ''Pakistan: A Modern History.''

Pregnancy from rape is an [[ethics|ethical]] and [[morality|moral]] issue in the context of [[opposition to legal abortion]]. In recent decades, claims of the improbability of rape-induced pregnancy, reminiscent of historical beliefs,&lt;ref name=Reuters-20-08-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heggie12/&gt; have again begun to play a role in political discourse surrounding abortion regulation in cases of rape, particularly in the United States.&lt;ref name=Reuters-20-08-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=NJ-21-08-2012&gt;Garance Franke-Ruta, [http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/analysis-a-canard-that-will-not-die-legitimate-rape-doesn-t-cause-pregnancy-20120820 Analysis — A Canard That Will Not Die: 'Legitimate Rape' Doesn't Cause Pregnancy], ''[[National Journal]]'' (21 August 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Among female victims of partner violence who filed a protective order, 68% reported they were raped by their intimate partner and 20% reported a rape-related pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McFarlane J, Malecha A, Watson K, Gist J, Batten E, Hall I, Smith S | year = 2005 | title = Intimate partner sexual assault against women: Frequency, health consequences &amp; treatment outcomes | url = | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 105 | issue = 1| pages = 99–108 | doi=10.1097/01.aog.0000146641.98665.b6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims that rape reduces the chance of pregnancy have at times been made by referring to the fact that [[chronic stress]] can reduce a woman's fertility over a long term. However the current scientific consensus is that this is specific to long-term stress—the [[acute stress reaction]] that occurs during rape cannot "shut down ovulation that has already begun".&lt;ref name=CNN22-08-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters-20-08-2012/&gt; In a 1972 article, physician and anti-abortion activist [[Fred Mecklenburg]] argued that pregnancy from rape is "extremely rare", adding that a woman exposed to the trauma of rape "will not [[ovulate]] even if she is 'scheduled' to".&lt;ref name="Mecklenburg"&gt;Mecklenburg, Fred E.

Related views have also been expressed by pro-life groups outside the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3094">&lt;!-- This article is not a duplicate, of the economic concept of [[profit]], but an entirely different meaning of the term, analogous to an [[easement]]. -BDA --&gt;
{{refimprove|date=September 2007}}
{{Property law}}
A '''profit''' (short for '''''profit-à-prendre''''' in [[Middle French]] for "right of taking"), in the [[law]] of [[real property]], is a [[nonpossessory interest in land]] similar to the better-known [[easement]], which gives the holder the right to take [[natural resources]] such as [[petroleum]], [[minerals]], [[timber]], and [[wild game]] from the land of another. Indeed, because of the necessity of allowing access to the land so that resources may be gathered, every profit contains an implied easement for the owner of the profit to enter the other party's land for the purpose of collecting the resources permitted by the profit.

==Creation==
Like an easement, profits can be created ''expressly'' by an agreement between the property owner and the owner of the profit, or by ''prescription'', where the owner of the profit has made "open and notorious" use of the land for a continuous and uninterrupted statutory period.

==Types==
A profit can be ''appurtenant'' (owned by an adjacent landowner, and tied to the use of the adjacent land) or ''in gross''.

'''Appurtenant.''' An appurtenant profit may ''only'' be used by the owner of the adjacent property. A properly recorded profit will remain even if the ownership of the land upon which the profit exists changes hands.

'''In Gross.''' By contrast, a profit ''in gross'' can be [[assignment (law)|assigned]] or otherwise transferred by its owner. [[Courts]] will construe a profit as being in gross unless the profit is expressly designated as being appurtenant. Therefore, profits by prescription will virtually always be profits in gross.  Like a commercial easement in gross, a profit in gross is completely [[alienable]]. Profits can also be ''exclusive'' (guaranteeing the owner of the profit that no other person will be given the right to collect the specified resources on the land).

==Termination==
Termination of a profit can occur by a number of means, including:
* ''[[Merger doctrine (property law)|merger]]'' - if the owner of the profit acquires the land to which it applies, there is no longer any need for a separate right to take resources off it.
* ''[[Legal release|release]]'' - the owner of the profit can execute a contract to surrender the profit to the owner of the land.
* ''[[abandonment (legal)|abandonment]]'' - the owner of the profit ceases to make use of it for a sufficient length of time to lead a reasonable owner to believe that it will no longer be used.
* ''[[wikt:misuse|misuse]]'' - if a profit is used in such a way that it places a burden on the servient estate, then it will be terminated.

==Ireland==
[[Law of the Republic of Ireland|Irish law]] governs profits by Part 8 of the 2009 Land Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2009/a2709.pdf Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2366">A '''''shtar siruv''''' (also spelled '''''seruv''''') is a form of [[contempt of court]] order issued by a ''[[beth din]]'' (rabbinical court) in an effort to compel action by an individual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-22076147_ITM "The collision of church and state: a primer to beth din arbitration and the New York secular courts"], ''Fordham Urban Law Journal'', January 2004. Accessed October 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''siruv'' has been described as a form of ''[[Herem (censure)|cherem]]'' (which combines characteristics of [[shunning]] or [[excommunication]]) for a party who refuses to appear before a beth din. Under the terms of a ''siruv'', the individual is to be shunned by the community until the terms of the order issued by the ''beth din'' are addressed. While most Jewish litigants are adjured from pursuing justice against other Jews in the civil court system, in the case of a ''siruv'', the ''beth din'' may permit use of the secular courts by the plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queensvaad.org/bais/?BaisID=5 Bais Din Facts], Vaad Harabonim of Queens. Accessed October 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the [[Rabbinical Council of America]] (RCA), one of the world's largest organizations of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[rabbi]]s, issued a resolution regarding spouses who refuse to comply with a ''beth din'' in the issuance of a ''[[get (divorce document)|get]]'' (the formal divorce document presented by a husband to his wife to terminate their marriage under [[halakha|Jewish law]]). Synagogues of RCA members were encouraged to formulate procedures under which a spouse under a ''siruv'' regarding their failure to comply with issuance of a ''get'' would be excluded from membership, employment, elective and appointed positions in the synagogue; would be excluded from being called to the ''Torah'' or lead services. Synagogues would announce the non-compliant individual's name monthly after ''[[shabbat]]'' services and would publish the person's name in its bulletin, including a call to others to "limit their social and economic relations to such persons."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=101025 Pre-Nuptial Agreements and Recalcitrant Spouses 1993], [[Rabbinical Council of America]], June 1, 1993.

'''''Stanton v. Stanton''''', 421 U.S. 7 (1975), is a [[United States Supreme Court]] case which struck down  [[Utah]]'s definitions of adulthood as a violation of [[Equal protection clause|equal protection]]: females reached adulthood at 18; males at 21.&lt;ref name= Greenhouse&gt;{{cite book | last = Greenhouse | first = Linda | title = Becoming Justice Blackmun | publisher = Times Books | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-8050-8057-5  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|217–218}}

==Background==
The case had started in Utah state court.&lt;ref name= Greenhouse /&gt;{{rp|217–218}} A divorced father stopped paying child support for his daughter when she turned eighteen, so the daughter's mother went to court to ask for support until both the daughter and the son reached twenty-one.&lt;ref name= Greenhouse /&gt;{{rp|218}} Utah divorce court ruled against the mother, and the Utah Supreme Court held that there was a "reasonable basis" for the differential: women matured earlier and married younger; men had a greater need for education.&lt;ref name= Greenhouse /&gt;{{rp|218}} The Utah court stated in its opinion that the basis for the law, though an "old notion," was not unconstitutional.&lt;ref name= Greenhouse /&gt;{{rp|218}}

==Opinion==
[[Justice Blackmun]] wrote for the majority.&lt;ref name= Greenhouse /&gt;{{rp|218}} He found a violation of [[equal protection]] and said the law failed under any standard, including rational basis (the Supreme Court's lowest standard of review).&lt;ref name= Greenhouse /&gt;{{rp|218}} The decision remained in the context of child support, without considering different ages for males and females in other contexts.&lt;ref name= Greenhouse /&gt;{{rp|218}}

The ''Stanton'' decision placed the Court on record as declaring that society's stereotypes were not a legitimate basis for official policies that treated men and women differently.&lt;ref name= Greenhouse /&gt;{{rp|218}}

Blackmun wrote: "A child, male or female, is still a child... No longer is the female destined solely for the home and the rearing of the family, and only the male for the marketplace and the world of ideas... If a specified age of minority is required for the boy in order to assure him parental support while he attains his education and training, so, too, is it for the girl."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Stanton v.

In [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], '''tin coinage''' was a tax on [[white tin|refined tin]], payable to the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] and administered in the [[Stannary|Stannary Towns]].  The oldest surviving records of coinage show that it was collected in 1156.  It was abolished by the [[Tin Duties Act 1838]].

&lt;!-- This article is nearly a copy/paste from the single referenced external link, except where I've just cleaned up the carefree misinformation. Feb 2009 --&gt;

A '''treebog''' is a type of low-tech [[compost toilet]]. It consists of a raised platform above a compost pile surrounded by densely planted willow trees or other  nutrient-hungry vegetation.  It can be considered an example of [[permaculture]] design, as it functions as a system for converting urine and feces to [[biomass]], without the need to handle excreta. 

==Etymology==
The term "treebog" was coined Jay Abrahams of Biologic Design. ''[[wikt:bog|Bog]]'' is a [[British English]] slang word for [[toilet]], not to be confused with its other meaning of [[wetland]].

==History==
The treebog is a simple method of composting wastes. Abrahams claims that from 1995-2011, around 1500 treebogs may have been built in Britain.&lt;ref name="LivingWoods"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Making of a Biologic Treebog|journal=LivingWoods Magazine|date=January–February 2011|pages=10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have been on sites ranging from fruit farms, pick-your-own enterprises, campsites, an angling lake, festival sites, remote/low impact dwellings, holiday cottages, allotments, and church yards where there is no mains water supply.

In 2011, Abrahams claimed that the treebog had attracted the attention of NGOs and aid workers who hope to develop its potential for shanty towns or refugee camps - anywhere that water is scarce and the population pressure on resources is high.&lt;ref name="LivingWoods"/&gt;

==Plant growth==
A treebog is simply a controlled [[compost heap]] whose function has been enhanced by use of moisture or nutrient-hungry trees. They use no water, purify waste as they create a biomass resource, and also contain the organic waste material, thus preventing the spread of disease.

The main requirement is that the planted species should be nutrient-hungry. It is a bonus if they can be harvested or [[coppice]]d for productive uses, e.g. willow cultivars. Apart from willow coppice, [[soft fruit]] such as black currants and sweet-smelling herbs such as mint will thrive around a treebog. If left unmanaged, a treebog will soon be surrounded by weed species such as nettles, but a little management and conscious planting can create a fertile and productive [[bog garden]].

Both the solids and liquids are deposited within the treebog base, where the solids compost and the liquids soak through the soil. The associated dense root zone enables the nitrogen to be rapidly absorbed and metabolized by the mycorhyzal species. The feces are contained within the treebog base, which is well ventilated to allow aerobic decomposition to occur, the mineralized material feeding the trees around it. 

==Construction==
A seating platform/cubicle is mounted at least one meter high.  The area beneath the seating platform is enclosed by a double-layer of chicken wire; this acts as an effective child-proof barrier and allows air to circulate through the compost heap.This allows for optimum plant growing conditions.

Sawdust, straw, woodchip, ash or other high-carbon matter is used to balance the high-nitrogen content of the urine. One design used Effective Micro-organism bran, which helped keep the treebog virtually odour free.&lt;ref name="PCMag"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.permaculture.co.uk/articles/loo-view-build-your-own-treebog | title=A Loo with a View - Build your own Treebog | author=Tim Green | date=18 May 2011 | publisher=Permaculture Magazine | accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The space between the wire is stuffed with straw, which acts as a wick to help sop up excess urine, preventing the likelihood of odour problems due to incomplete biological absorption of the nitrogen from the urine.  The straw-filled wire also enables the pile to be well-aerated whilst acting as a visual screen for the first year’s use.

The structure is surrounded by two closely planted rows of [[Salix viminalis|osier]] or [[Willow#Other|biomass willow]] cuttings; this [[Green wall|living wall]] of willow can then be woven into a hurdle-like structure and its annual growth can be harvested.

[[File:Internet Connectivity Triple-Play.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Diagram showing connectivity for triple play customers over xDSL and CATV networks.]]
In [[telecommunication]]s, '''triple play''' service is a marketing term for the [[provisioning]], over a single [[broadband]] connection, of two [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]-intensive services, [[broadband Internet access]] and television, and the [[Latency (engineering)|latency]]-sensitive [[telephone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techomebuilder.com/article/6875.html Tech Home Builder] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011223018/http://www.techomebuilder.com/article/6875.html |date=2008-10-11 }} Revenue streams&lt;/ref&gt;  Triple play focuses on a [[supplier convergence]] rather than solving technical issues or a common standard. However, standards like [[G.hn]] might deliver all these services on a common technology.

== Quadruple play ==
{{main article|Quadruple play}}
A so-called '''quadruple play''' (or '''quad play''') service integrates mobility as well, often by supporting [[dual mode mobile]] plus hotspot-based phones that shift from [[GSM]] to [[Wi-Fi]] when they come in range of a home wired for triple-play service.  Typical [[Generic Access Network]] services of this kind, such as Rogers Home Calling Zone (Rogers is an incumbent in the Canadian market), allow the caller to enter and leave the range of their home Wi-Fi network, and only pay GSM rates for the time they spend outside the range. Calls at home are routed over the [[Internet Protocol|IP]] network and paid at a flat rate per month. No interruption or authorization for the shift is required—[[soft handoff]] takes place automatically as many times as the caller enters or leaves the range.

==CATV==
{{globalize/US|date=December 2010}}
By about 2000, [[cable TV]] companies were in a technical position to offer ''triple play'' over one physical medium to a large number of their customers, as their networks already had sufficient bandwidth to carry hundreds of video channels. Cable's main competition for television in North America came from satellites, which could not compete for voice and interactive broadband due to the [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] imposed by physical laws on a [[geosynchronous satellite]]—sometimes up to one full second of delay between speaking and being heard. Cable's main competition for voice and Internet access came from [[telephone company|telcos]], which were not yet able to compete for television in most markets because DSL over most [[local loop]]s could not provide enough bandwidth.

As an interim marketing move while they installed [[Fiber to the x|fiber closer to the customer]], telcos such as [[AT&amp;T Inc.|AT&amp;T]] did co-promotion deals with [[satellite TV]] providers to sell television, telephone, and Internet access services [[Product bundling|bundled]] for billing purposes, although the services provided through a satellite link and the services provided through a phone line are not technically related. Telcos that own wireless phone networks also included those as part of such billing-only bundles because most cable companies do not own wireless networks.

== Deployments ==
The first triple-play deployment was by Italian operator [[Fastweb (telecommunications company)|Fastweb]] in 2001, using [[fibre to the home]] service and one of the first triple-play [[home gateway]] devices with embedded fibre termination.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.totaltele.com/view.aspx?C=0&amp;ID=442078&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled the operator to deliver voice, video, and data services to subscribers’ homes via its 10 MB [[Symmetric digital subscriber line|SDSL]] network.  This approach, known as [[Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet]].  This [[FTTH]] architecture brought the operator the best [[ARPU]] in the industry for a number of consecutive years.

Triple-play services in the United States are offered by [[cable television]] operators as well as by [[telecommunication]] operators, who directly compete with one another.  Providers expect that an integrated solution will increase opportunity costs for customers who may want to choose between service providers, permit more [[cross-selling]], and hold off the power companies deploying [[G.hn]] and [[IEEE P1901]] technology with its radically superior service and deployment characteristics for at least another decade or so.

Outside the United States, notably in [[Ecuador]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Japan]], and [[China]], power companies have generally been more successful in leapfrogging [[legacy technologies]].  In [[Switzerland]] and [[Sweden]], [[dark fiber]] is available reliably to homes at tariffed rates (in Switzerland four [[dark fibre]]s are deployed to each home) supporting speeds in excess of 40 Gbit/s—only to the local caches, however, as [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul]] cannot typically support more than 10 Mbit/s connections to global services.

Since 2007, access providers in Italy have been participating in an initiative called Fiber for Italy, which aims to build an infrastructure that can deliver 100 Mbit/s symmetrical bandwidth to consumers, in order to enable the delivery of triple- and quad-play services.&lt;ref&gt;Fastweb to launch 100 Mbit/s | {{cite web |url=http://www.telecomsitaly.com/2008/08/fastweb-to-launch-100-mbps-service-through-ftth/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120919120529/http://www.telecomsitaly.com/2008/08/fastweb-to-launch-100-mbps-service-through-ftth/ |archivedate=2012-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other triple-play deployments include [[Deutsche Telekom]], [[Vmedia]], [[Telecom Italia]], [[Swisscom]], [[Telekom Austria]], and [[Telus]].

==Regulation==
There are multiple and intense regulatory battles over triple-play services, as incumbent telcos and incumbent [[Cable television|cable]] operators attempt to keep out new competitors; since both industries historically have been regulated monopolies, [[regulatory capture]] has long been as much a core competency for them as have been prices and terms of service. Cable providers want to compete with telcos for local voice service, but want to discourage telcos from competing with them for television service. Incumbent telcos want to deliver television service but want to block competition for voice service from cable operators. Both industries cloak their demands for favorable regulatory treatment in claims that their positions favor the public interests.

In March 2007 cable operators scored a major victory when the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) overruled two state public service commissions by ruling that incumbent local exchange carriers must connect to [[VoIP]] services [https://news.yahoo.com/s/pcworld/20070304/tc_pcworld/129580]. Regulators in [[South Carolina]] and [[Nebraska]] had been allowing local telcos to block [[Time Warner Cable]] from offering local phone service in their states. In the other direction, also in March 2007, the FCC limited the powers of municipalities and states over telcos that want to compete with cable TV companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/shared/printableArticle.jhtml?articleID=197800544], ''Information Week''.&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer groups expressed displeasure with this FCC ruling because they fear telcos will only offer service to the richest neighborhoods, which is a major point of contention between telcos wanting to offer television service and local governments is that local governments typically impose "build-out" and community access requirements so a cable provider is forced to wire the entire town within a specified period of time. All three [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] members of the FCC voted for this decision, while both [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] members voted against it and one predicted either [[U.S. Congress]] or the courts would overturn it.  In October 2007, The ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' reported that [[Connecticut]] regulators have ordered AT&amp;T to stop signing up new customers for its [[IPTV]] service until they got a cable license; AT&amp;T said they would fight this decision in court [http://www.courant.com/business/hc-att-1015,0,7352347.story?coll=hc_tab01_layout].

==Telco==
For telephone [[local exchange carrier]]s (LEC), ''triple play'' is delivered using a combination of [[optical fiber]] and [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) technologies (called [[fiber in the loop]]) to its residential base. This configuration uses fiber communications to reach distant locations and uses DSL over an existing [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] [[twisted pair]] cable as [[last mile]] access to the subscriber's home. Cable television operators use a similar architecture called [[hybrid fibre coaxial]] (HFC) to provide subscriber homes with broadband, but use the available [[coaxial cable]] rather than a [[twisted pair]] for the last mile transmission standard. Subscriber homes can be in a residential environment, multi-dwelling units, or even in business offices.

Using DSL over twisted pair, television content is delivered using [[IPTV]] where the content is streamed to the subscriber in an [[MPEG-2]] transport format. On an HFC network, television may be a mixture of [[analog television|analog]] and [[Digital data|digital]] television signals. A [[set-top box]] (STB) is used at the subscriber's home to allow the susbcriber to control viewing and order new video services such as "movies [[Video on demand|on demand]]". Access to the Internet is provided through [[Asynchronous transfer mode|ATM]] or [[DOCSIS]], typically provided as an [[Ethernet]] port to the subscriber. Voice service can be provided using a traditional [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS) interface as part of the legacy telephone network or can be delivered using [[voice over IP]] (VoIP). In an HFC network, voice is delivered using VoIP.

Some service providers are also rolling out [[Ethernet]] to the home networks and [[fiber to the home]], which support triple-play services and bypass the disadvantages of adapting broadband transmission to a legacy network. This is particularly common in [[Greenfield project|greenfield]] developments where the [[capital expenditure]] is reduced by deploying one network to deliver all services.

For existing [[Multi-family residential|multiple-dwelling-unit]] (MDU) buildings, where running fiber to each unit may not be feasible, telcos often use [[VDSL]] to connect individual units over existing copper through a central optical network terminal located in the existing telco closet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.thomasnet.com/companystory/477946] {{cite web |url=http://www.ospmag.com/issues/article/?articleid=00000407 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008142029/http://www.ospmag.com/issues/article/?articleid=00000407 |archivedate=2007-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over such a short distance, DSL can deliver much higher bitrates than is possible running DSL over the local loop from the nearest central office (as is common with basic DSL).

== Wireless ==
''Triple play'' has led to the term "[[Technological convergence#Multi-play|quadruple play]]", where wireless communications is introduced as another medium to deliver video, Internet access, and voice telephone service. Advances in both [[CDMA]] and [[GSM]] standards, utilizing [[3G]], [[4G]], or [[UMTS]] allows the service operators to enter into quadruple play and gain competitive advantage against other providers. The grouping together of services (as triple or quadruple play) is called [[Technological convergence#Multi-play|multi-play]].

Other advanced technologies such as [[WiMax]] or [[IEEE 802.16|802.16]] has allowed new market entrants to achieve triple play. Many speculate that this means serious, new competition for established providers of bundled telecommunications services.

== Power integration ==
These services can be delivered with a [[Broadband over Power Lines|BPL]] network using technologies such as [[IEEE P1901]]/[[G.hn]].  Since the devices all rely on AC power (or DC power via [[802.3af]] or [[802.3at]] which rely on AC power at the [[Power over Ethernet|PoE]] hub), connecting them with only one cable each for both power and gigabit data cuts wiring costs, and most rooms are already wired for power.

==Business==
The challenges in offering ''triple play'' are mostly associated with determining the right business model, [[Front and back ends|backend]] processes, customer care support, and economic environment, rather than technology. For example, using the right billing platform to address a variety of subscriber demographics or having the appropriate subscriber density to financially justify introduction of the service are a few factors that affect decisions to offer triple play.

In addition to the challenges mentioned above, there are a number of technical challenges with regards to the rollout of triple-play services. Voice, video, and high-speed data all have different characteristics and place different burdens on the network that provides access to these services. Voice services are greatly affected by [[jitter]], whereas [[packet loss]] has a greater effect on video and data services. In order to use a shared network resource such as cable or DSL, the service provider may use network equipment that employs [[Quality of Service|quality-of-service]] mechanisms to adjust to the requirements of the different services.

The '''[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] Office of Law Enforcement''' contributes to Service efforts to manage ecosystems, save endangered species, conserve migratory birds, preserve wildlife habitat, restore fisheries, combat invasive species, and promote international wildlife conservation.

The Office of Law Enforcement focuses on potentially devastating threats to wildlife resource-illegal trade, unlawful commercial exploitation, habitat destruction, and environmental contaminants. The Office of Law Enforcement investigates wildlife crimes, regulates wildlife trade, helps Americans understand and obey wildlife protections laws, and works in partnership with international, state, and tribal counterparts to conserve wildlife resources. This work includes:

* Breaking up international and domestic smuggling rings that target imperiled animals.
* Preventing the unlawful commercial exploitation of protected U. S. species.
* Protecting wildlife from environmental hazards and safeguarding critical habitat for endangered species.
* Enforcing federal migratory game bird hunting regulations and working with states to protect other game species from illegal take and preserve legitimate hunting opportunities.
* Inspecting wildlife shipments to ensure compliance with laws and treaties and detect illegal trade.
* Working with international counterparts to combat illegal trafficking in protected species.
* Training other federal, state, tribal, and foreign law enforcement officers.
* Using forensic science to analyze evidence and solve wildlife crimes.

Distributing information and outreach materials to increase public understanding of wildlife conservation and promote compliance with wildlife protection laws.

==Special agents==

In order to become a FWS [[Special agent|Special Agent]], an applicant must be between the ages of 23 and 37. However, due to the decision in ''Robert P. Isabella v. Department of State and Office of Personnel Management'', 2008 M.S.P.B. 146, preference eligible veterans may apply after age 37. In 2009, the Office of Personnel Management issued implementation guidance on the Isabella decision: OPM Letter The applicant must also hold American citizenship, have a clean record, and hold a four-year bachelor's degree. In addition, all special agents are required to sign a mobility agreement which indicates a willingness to accept a reassignment to any location as dictated by the needs of the Service.

New special agents attend the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]] at Glynco, Georgia for 18 weeks of training.  This training includes comprehensive courses in protective techniques, criminal law, use of special investigative equipment, use of firearms, and defensive measures. Rules of evidence, surveillance techniques, undercover operations, and courtroom demeanor are also studied. Classroom study is supplemented with on-the-job training when agents report to their assigned field stations. As agents in training, they assist in carrying out surveillance activities, participating in raids, interviewing witnesses and suspects, searching for physical evidence and clues, seizing contraband, and serving search warrants. The emphasis on training and the vast experience they gain make U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service Special Agents among the best wildlife law enforcement professionals in the world.

When fully staffed, the Office of Law Enforcement includes 261 special agents and 122 wildlife inspectors. Most are "officers on the beat" who report through eight regional law enforcement offices. A headquarters Office of Law Enforcement provides national oversight, support, policy, and guidance for Service investigations and the wildlife inspection program; trains Service law enforcement personnel; fields a special investigations unit; and provides budget, management and administrative support for the Office of Law Enforcement.

==Resources==

The [[Clark R. Bavin National Fish and Wildlife Forensic Laboratory]] conducts scientific analyses that support federal, state, and international investigations of wildlife crime. The Office of Law Enforcement also maintains a [[National Wildlife Property Repository]], which supplies abandoned and forfeited wildlife items to schools, universities, museums, and non-government organizations for public education, and operates the [[National Eagle Repository]], which meets the needs of Native Americans for eagles and eagle feathers for religious use.

The [[National Eagle and Wildlife Property Repository]], near [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] stores in a 16,000-square-foot (1,486 square meters) warehouse 1.5 million specimens, mainly products made from endangered animals: [[tiger]], [[rhinoceros]], [[sea turtle]], [[crocodile]] and [[elephant]]. A row of shelves 50 feet long and 10 feet high stores the hides and mounted heads of big cat: cheetah, tiger, jaguar, margay, ocelot and leopard. An objective of the server is assuring the U.S. complies with the [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]]. The treaty regulates wildlife commerce to assure the survival of [[threatened species]].  The specimens in the repository were seized in customs searches at U.S. ports of entry or being trafficked across state lines.  The facility develops educational programs about wildlife trade, endangered species, and conservation laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:RyoanJi-Dry garden.jpg|thumb|[[Zen garden]] of [[Ryōan-ji]]. It was built during the [[Higashiyama period]].

[[Image:Black Raku Tea Bowl.jpg|thumb|right|Wabi-sabi tea bowl, [[Azuchi-Momoyama period]], 16th century]]

In traditional [[Japanese aesthetics]], {{nihongo||[[wikt:侘|侘]][[wikt:寂|寂]]|'''wabi-sabi'''}} is a [[world view]] centered on the acceptance of [[wikt:transience|transience]] and imperfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nobleharbor.com/tea/chado/WhatIsWabi-Sabi.htm|title=What Is Wabi-Sabi?|website=nobleharbor.com|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic is sometimes described as one of beauty that is "imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete".&lt;ref name=Koren/&gt; It is a concept derived from the [[Buddhist]] teaching of the {{nihongo|[[three marks of existence]]|三法印|sanbōin}}, specifically {{nihongo|[[impermanence]]|無常|mujō}}, {{nihongo|[[dukkha|suffering]]|苦|ku}} and {{nihongo|[[śūnyatā|emptiness or absence of self-nature]]|空|kū}}.

Characteristics of the ''wabi-sabi'' aesthetic include [[asymmetry]], roughness, [[simplicity]], economy, austerity, modesty, [[intimacy]], and appreciation of the ingenuous integrity of natural objects and processes.

==Description==
According to [[Leonard Koren]], ''wabi-sabi'' can be defined as "the most conspicuous and characteristic feature of traditional Japanese beauty and it occupies roughly the same position in the Japanese [[wiktionary:pantheon|pantheon]] of aesthetic values as do the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] ideals of [[beauty]] and perfection in the far West."&lt;ref name=Koren/&gt; Whereas  Andrew Juniper notes that "If an object or expression can bring about, within us, a sense of serene melancholy and a spiritual longing, then that object could be said to be wabi-sabi."&lt;ref name=Juniper&gt;{{cite book |last=Juniper |first=Andrew |title=Wabi Sabi: The Japanese Art of Impermanence | publisher=Tuttle Publishing | year=2003 | isbn=0-8048-3482-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Richard Powell, "Wabi-sabi nurtures all that is authentic by acknowledging three simple realities: nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect."&lt;ref name=Powell&gt;{{cite book | author=Powell, Richard R. | title=Wabi Sabi Simple | publisher=Adams Media | year=2004 | isbn=1-59337-178-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The words ''wabi'' and ''sabi'' do not translate easily. ''Wabi'' originally referred to the loneliness of living in nature, remote from society; ''sabi'' meant "chill", "lean" or "withered". Around the 14th century these meanings began to change, taking on more positive connotations.&lt;ref name=Koren&gt;{{cite book |last=Koren |first=Leonard |title=Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets and Philosophers |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |year=1994 |isbn=1-880656-12-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wabi'' now connotes rustic simplicity, freshness or quietness, and can be applied to both natural and human-made objects, or understated elegance. It can also refer to quirks and anomalies arising from the process of construction, which add uniqueness and elegance to the object. ''Sabi'' is beauty or serenity that comes with age, when the life of the object and its impermanence are evidenced in its [[patina]] and wear, or in any visible repairs.

After centuries of incorporating artistic and Buddhist influences from China, wabi-sabi eventually evolved into a distinctly Japanese ideal. Over time, the meanings of ''wabi'' and ''sabi'' shifted to become more lighthearted and hopeful. Around 700 years ago, particularly among the Japanese nobility, understanding emptiness and imperfection was honored as tantamount to the first step to [[satori]], or enlightenment. In today's Japan, the meaning of wabi-sabi is often condensed to "wisdom in natural simplicity". In art books, it is typically defined as "flawed beauty".&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Taro. (2004) [[Taro Gold]]'s ''Living Wabi Sabi'' (Kansas City: [[Andrews McMeel Publishing]], {{ISBN|0-7407-3960-3}}), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

From an engineering or design point of view, ''wabi'' may be interpreted as the imperfect quality of any object, due to inevitable limitations in design and construction/manufacture especially with respect to unpredictable or changing usage conditions; then ''sabi'' could be interpreted as the aspect of imperfect reliability, or limited mortality of any object, hence the phonological and etymological connection with the Japanese word sabi, {{nihongo|to rust|錆||also pronounced ''sabi''}}. Although the [[kanji]] characters for "rust" is not the same {{nihongo||寂|sabi}} in ''wabi-sabi'', the original spoken word (pre-kanji, ''[[yamato-kotoba]]'') is believed to be one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;錆びをめぐる話題, 井上勝也, 裳華房, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.memenet.or.jp/kinugawa/sabi/00121.htm さびの文字] on the Kinugawa Chain Mfg. Co. Ltd website&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Contemporary wabi-sabi tea bowl.jpg|left|thumb|Modern tea vessel made in the ''wabi-sabi'' style]]
A good example of this embodiment may be seen in certain styles of Japanese pottery. In the [[Japanese tea ceremony]], the pottery items used are often rustic and simple-looking, e.g. [[Hagi ware]], with shapes that are not quite symmetrical, and colors or textures that appear to emphasize an unrefined or simple style. In fact, it is up to the knowledge and observational ability of the participant to notice and discern the hidden signs of a truly excellent design or [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] (akin to the appearance of a diamond in the rough). This may be interpreted as a kind of wabi-sabi aesthetic, further confirmed by the way the colour of glazed items is known to change over time as hot water is repeatedly poured into them (''sabi'') and the fact that tea bowls are often deliberately chipped or nicked at the bottom (''wabi''), which serves as a kind of signature of the ''Hagi-yaki'' style.

''Wabi'' and ''sabi'' both suggest sentiments of desolation and solitude. In the [[Mahayana Buddhist]] view of the universe, these may be viewed as positive characteristics, representing liberation from a material world and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] to a simpler life. Mahayana philosophy itself, however, warns that genuine understanding cannot be achieved through words or language, so accepting wabi-sabi on nonverbal terms may be the most appropriate approach. Simon Brown&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book | author=Brown, Simon | title=Practical Wabi Sabi | publisher=Carroll &amp; Brown |year=2007 | isbn=1-904760-55-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that wabi-sabi describes a means whereby students can learn to live life through the senses and better engage in life as it happens, rather than be caught up in unnecessary thoughts. In this sense wabi-sabi is the material representation of Zen Buddhism. The idea is that being surrounded by natural, changing, unique objects helps us connect to our real world and escape potentially stressful distractions.

In one sense wabi-sabi is a training whereby the student of wabi-sabi learns to find the most basic, natural objects interesting, fascinating and beautiful. Fading autumn leaves would be an example. Wabi-sabi can change our perception of the world to the extent that a chip or crack in a vase makes it more interesting and gives the object greater meditative value. Similarly materials that age such as bare wood, paper and fabric become more interesting as they exhibit changes that can be observed over time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The ''wabi'' and ''sabi'' concepts are religious in origin, but actual usage of the words in Japanese is often quite casual because of the [[syncretic]] nature of Japanese belief.

==In Japanese arts==
Many [[Japanese art]]s over the past thousand years have been influenced by [[Zen]] and [[Mahayana]] philosophy, particularly acceptance and contemplation of the imperfection, constant [[flux]] and [[impermanence]] of all things. Such arts can exemplify a wabi-sabi aesthetic. Examples include:
* [[Honkyoku]] (traditional [[shakuhachi]] music of wandering Zen monks)
* [[Ikebana]] (flower arrangement)
* [[Bonsai]] design features such as snags, deadwood and hollow trunks highlight passage of time and natural cycles. Bonsai are often displayed in fall color or after they have shed leaves seasonally, to admire their bare branches.
* [[Japanese garden]]s, [[Zen garden]]s  (tray gardens)
* [[Japanese poetry]]
* [[Japanese pottery]], [[Hagi ware]], [[Raku ware]]
* [[Japanese tea ceremony]]

A contemporary Japanese appraisal of this concept is found in the influential essay ''[[In Praise of Shadows]]'' by [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]].

==Western use==
Designer [[Leonard Koren]] (born 1948) in 1994 published ''Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets &amp; Philosophers''&lt;ref name=Koren/&gt; as an examination of wabi-sabi, contrasting it with Western ideals of beauty. According to Penelope Green, Koren's book subsequently "became a talking point for a wasteful culture intent on penitence and a touchstone for designers of all stripes."&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Penelope|title=An Idiosyncratic Designer, a Serene New Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/garden/23leonard.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potter [[Bernard Leach]] (1887–1979) was deeply influenced by Japanese aesthetics  and techniques and founded an influential European aesthetic movement which also included Dame [[Lucy Rie]] and [[Hans Coper]].

Some [[haiku in English]] adapt the wabi-sabi aesthetic, with spare, minimalist poems that evoke loneliness and transience,{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} such as [[Nick Virgilio]]'s "autumn twilight:/ the wreath on the door/ lifts in the wind".&lt;ref&gt;[[Cor van den Heuvel]], editor. ''The Haiku Anthology''. Fireside, 1986. {{ISBN|0671628372}} p285&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of American artist [[John Connell]] (born 1940) is  centered on the idea of wabi.&lt;ref&gt;Hess Art Collection, Hatje Cantz, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Stuckist]] artist and [[remodernist film]]maker [[Jesse Richards]] (born 1975) employs it in nearly all of his work, along with [[mono no aware]].

During the 1990s the concept was borrowed by computer software developers and employed in [[Agile programming]] and [[Wiki]] to describe acceptance of the state of ongoing imperfection that is the product of these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March 2009, [[Marcel Theroux]] presented "In Search of Wabi Sabi" on [[BBC Four]] as part of the channel's ''Hidden Japan'' season of programming. Theroux traveled throughout Japan trying to understand the aesthetic tastes of its people, beginning by comically enacting a challenge from the book ''Living Wabi Sabi'' by [[Taro Gold]] to "ask people on a Tokyo street to describe Wabi Sabi." Theroux showed that, just as Gold predicted, "they will likely give you a polite shrug and explain that Wabi Sabi is simply unexplainable." &lt;ref&gt;Gold, Taro. (2004) [[Taro Gold]]'s ''Living Wabi Sabi'' (Kansas City: [[Andrews McMeel Publishing]], {{ISBN|0-7407-3960-3}}), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers''' (until 1937 the '''Worshipful Company of Stationers'''), usually known as the '''Stationers' Company''', is one of the [[livery company|livery companies]] of the [[City of London]]. The Stationers' Company was formed in 1403; it received a [[Royal Charter|royal charter]] in 1557. It held a monopoly over the publishing industry and was officially responsible for setting and enforcing regulations until the enactment of the [[Statute of Anne]], also known as the Copyright Act of 1710. Once the company received its charter, “the company’s role was to regulate and discipline the industry, define proper conduct and maintain its own corporate privileges.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Books: A Living History|last = Lyons|first = Martyn|publisher = J. Paul Getty Museum|year = 2011|isbn = |location = Los Angeles, CA|pages = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company members, including master, wardens, assistants, liverymen, freemen and apprentices) are mostly involved with the modern visual and graphic communications industries that have evolved from the company's original trades. These include printing, papermaking, packaging, office products, engineering, advertising, design, photography, film and video production, publishing of books, newspapers and periodicals and digital media. The Company's principal purpose nowadays is to provide an independent forum where its members can advance the interests (strategic, educational, training and charitable) of the industries associated with the Company.

==History==
In 1403, the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] approved the formation of a [[guild]] of [[stationer]]s. At this time, the occupations considered stationers for the purposes of the guild were text writers, [[limner|lymners]] (illuminators), [[Bookbinding|bookbinders]] or [[booksellers]] who worked at a fixed location (''stationarius'') beside the walls of St Paul's Cathedral.&lt;ref name="Patterson1968"&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Patterson
 | first = Lyman Ray
 | authorlink = Lyman Ray Patterson
 | year = 1968
 | title = [[Copyright in Historical Perspective]]
 | publisher = Vanderbilt University Press
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Booksellers sold manuscript books, or copies thereof produced by their respective firms for retail; they also sold writing materials. Illuminators illustrated and decorated manuscripts.

Printing gradually displaced manuscript production so that, by the time the guild received a Royal Charter of Incorporation on 4 May 1557, it had in effect become a printers' guild. In 1559, it became the 47th in [[City of London|city]] [[livery company]] precedence. At the time, it was based at Peter's College, which it bought from [[St Paul's Cathedral]].{{Clarify|reason=The company bought "Peter's College"? Is it a building?|date=November 2018}} During the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] and [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] periods, the Stationers were legally empowered to seize "offending books" that violated the standards of content set down by the Church and state; its officers could bring "offenders" before ecclesiastical authorities, usually the [[Bishop of London]] or the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], depending on the severity of the transgression. Thus the Stationers played an important role in the culture of England as it evolved through the intensely turbulent decades of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and toward the [[English Civil War]].

The Stationers' Charter, which codified its [[monopoly]] on book production, ensured that once a member had asserted ownership of a text or "copy", no other member was entitled to publish it, that is, no one else had the "right to copy" it. This is the origin of the term "[[copyright]]".  However, this original "right to copy" in England was different from the modern conception of copyright. The stationers' "copy right" was a protection granted to the printers of a book; "copyright" introduced with the [[Statute of Anne]], or the Copyright Act of 1710, was a right granted to the author(s) of a book based on statutory law. 

Members of the company asserted their ownership of a work by entering it in the "entry book of copies" or the [[Stationers' Register|Stationers' Company Register]]. The Register of the Stationers' Company became one of the most essential documentary records in the later study of [[English Renaissance theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Kerchever Chambers|Chambers, E. K.]] (1923). ''The Elizabethan Stage.'' 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press; Vol. 3, pp. 160-77, 186-91.&lt;/ref&gt; (In 1606 the [[Master of the Revels]], who was responsible for licensing the performance of plays rather than their publication, acquired some overlapping authority over publication as well; but the Stationers' Register remained a crucial and authoritative source of information after that date too.) To be sure, enforcement of the rules was always a challenge, in this area as in other aspects of the Tudor/Stuart regime; and plays and other works were sometimes printed surreptitiously and illegally.

In 1603, the Stationers formed the ''English Stock'', a joint stock publishing company funded by shares held by members of the Company. This profitable business gained many patents of which the richest was for almanacks including [[Old Moore's Almanack]]. The business employed out-of-work printers and disbursed some of the profit to the poor.

In 1606, the Company bought Abergavenny House in [[Ave Maria Lane]] and moved out of Peter's College. The new [[livery hall|hall]] burnt down in the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] of 1666 along with books to the value of about £40,000. It was rebuilt and its present interior is much as it was when it reopened in 1673. The Court Room was added in 1748 and in 1800 the external façade was remodelled to its present form.

In 1695, the monopoly power of the Stationers' Company was diminished, and in 1710 [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] passed the [[Copyright Act 1709]], the first copyright act.

The Company established the [[Stationers' Company's School]] at Bolt Court, [[Fleet Street]] in 1861 for the education of sons of members of the Company. In 1894, the school moved to [[Hornsey]] in north London. It closed in 1983.

Registration under the [[Copyright Act 1911]] ended in December 1923; the Company then established a voluntary register in which copyrights could be recorded to provide printed proof of ownership in case of disputes.

In 1937, a Royal Charter amalgamated the Stationers' Company and the Newspaper Makers' Company, which had been founded six years earlier (and whose members were predominant in [[Fleet Street]]), into the Company of the present name.

The Company's [[motto]] is ''Verbum Domini manet in aeternum'', [[Latin]] for ''The Word of the Lord endures forever''.

==Stationers' Hall==
[[File:EH1064742 Stationers Hall Stationers' Hall 02.jpg|thumb|right|Stationers' Hall, London (2013 photo)]]
Stationers' Hall is at [[Ave Maria Lane]] near [[Ludgate Hill]].  The site of the present hall was formerly the site of Abergavenny House, which was purchased by the Stationers in 1606 for £3,500, but destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]], 1666.&lt;ref&gt;[https://stationers.org/the-hall-heritage/library-archives/24-the-hall-heritage.html Stationers Livery Company website.] Accessed 17 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  The current building and hall date from ''circa'' 1670. The hall was remodelled in 1800 by the architect [[Robert Mylne (architect)|Robert Mylne]] and, on 4 January 1950, it was designated a Grade I [[listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IoE|199293|accessdate= 23 January 2009}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=blagden1960&gt;{{cite book |title=The Stationers' Company: A History, 1403-1959 |isbn=9780804709354 |author=Cyprian Blagden |publisher=Stanford University Press |origyear=1960|year=1977 |chapter=The Property |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDysAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
