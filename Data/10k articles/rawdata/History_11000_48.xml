'''Arpège''' ({{IPA-fr|aʁpɛʒ|pron}}) is a 1927 [[perfume]] by [[Jeanne Lanvin|Lanvin]]. It is considered to be one of the world's classic scents.&lt;ref name="NZ Herald Geary"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geary|first1=Cecilie|title=Top 15 scents with classic appeal|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=10815614|accessdate=10 July 2014|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The fragrance has been referred to as the "fragrance of 1000 flowers" and its official name is a derivation of the musical term ''arpeggio''.&lt;ref name="NZ Herald Geary"/&gt; In fact, the perfume contains some 60 floral essences.&lt;ref name="HB Lamont-Djite"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lamont-Djite|first1=Tara|title=Perfume Perfection: Lanvin’s Arpège Minaudière|url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/lanvin-fragrance-news-011113|accessdate=10 July 2014|publisher=Harper's Bazaar|date=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Chanel No.5]], launched six years earlier, it is considered an [[Aldehyde|aldehydic]] floral perfume.&lt;ref name="About Helbig"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helbig|first1=Catherine|title=What are Aldehydes?|url=http://beauty.about.com/od/fragranc1/a/What-are-Aldehydes.htm|website=about.com|publisher=About.com|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vosnaki|first1=Elena|title=Myth debunking 1: what are aldehydes, how do aldehydes smell and Chanel No. 5|url=http://perfumeshrine.blogspot.co.uk/2008/12/myth-debunking-1-what-are-aldehydes-how.html|website=perfumeshrine.blogspot.co.uk|publisher=perfumeshrineblogspot|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was created by [[perfumer]]s [[André Fraysse]] and [[Paul Vacher]] for [[Jeanne Lanvin]] and presented to her musician daughter Marie-Blanche on her 30th birthday.&lt;ref name="NZ Herald Geary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HB Lamont-Djite"/&gt;

===The bottle design===
The original black bottle with a gold top was decorated with a gold illustration of Jeanne Lanvin and her daughter, created by French fashion illustrator [[Paul Iribe|Iribe]].&lt;ref name="NZ Herald Geary"/&gt;

==Reformulation==
In 1993, the perfume was reformulated by Hubert Fraysse, brother of André and founder of fragrance manufacturer Synarome.&lt;ref name=NST&gt;{{cite web|title=Lanvin Arpege – pefume review|url=http://www.nstperfume.com/2007/07/31/lanvin-arpege-perfume-review/|website=nstperfume.com|publisher=Now Smell This|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perfume Handbook Groom"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Groom|first1=Nigel|title=The New Perfume Handbook|date=30 June 1997|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=0751404039|page=321|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UYrDPqLVD-kC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;lpg=PA321&amp;dq=Hubert+Fraysse&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kxMcUthrRI&amp;sig=fFf_5q1mxh_b0e4KUXnpG3S35fw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qtC-U6SINMPfOq_egOgJ&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Hubert%20Fraysse&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special edition [[minaudière]] (evening bag) was launched in 2013 to mark the 85th birthday of the perfume.&lt;ref name="HB Lamont-Djite"/&gt;

The '''Belen point''' is an unfluted, lanceolate-shaped [[Paleoindian]] [[projectile point]] found in the central [[Rio Grande Valley]] of [[New Mexico]]. It is the second most prevalent Paleoindian point in the area after the [[Folsom point]]. It was named in the 1960s by Ele Baker after the town of [[Belen, New Mexico]] where the points were initially discovered.&lt;ref name=Hranicky&gt;{{Cite book |title=North American Projectile Points | last=Hranicky | first=William J. | year=2010 | edition=revised | publisher=AuthorHouse | isbn=978-1-4520-2632-9 | page=75| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ctw4OPNR540C&amp;pg=PA205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age and cultural affiliations==
The Belen point has not been dated, although it is known to be of the Paleoindian period and is likely similar in date to the Folsom point. It is believed that the Belen culture was active during the same period as that of the Folsom and campsites have been found which indicate that the cultures occupied the same locations. Although no examples of mixed campsites exist, multiple instances of sites appearing alongside each other have been observed. The Belen people used and manufactured tools of an identical nature to that of Folsom and other Paleoindian cultures such as scrapers and gravers all featuring points with ground lateral and proximal edges. The divergence between the artifacts of the Belen and Folsom peoples lies in the lithic material. Although, both used fine [[cryptocrystalline]] material, the Belen people used [[chert]] and [[jasper]], locally sourced from the southeast of Belen, New Mexico, while Folsom used predominantly [[obsidian]] and [[chalcedony]] from Belen's northeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ele.net/belen/belndisc.htm |title=The Belen Point - A Plainview Variant?? |publisher=Ele.net |author=Tony Baker |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Coquelin was born in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], [[Pas-de-Calais]]. He was originally intended to follow his father's trade of [[baker]]&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; (he was once called "un boulanger manqué"&amp;nbsp;– "a failed baker"&amp;nbsp;– by a hostile critic), but his love of acting led him to the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Conservatoire]], where he entered [[Henri de Régnier|Régnier's]] class in 1859. He won the first prize for comedy within a year, and made his début on 7 December 1860 at the [[Comédie-Française]] as the comic valet, Gros-René, in [[Molière]]'s ''Le Dépit amoureux'', but his first great success was as [[The Barber of Seville (play)#The character of Figaro|Figaro]] in ''[[The Barber of Seville (play)|The Barber of Seville]]'', in the following year.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Coquelin, Benoît Constant|volume=7|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an honor for Coquelin to be a part of the Comédie-Française at such a young age.  This company had already been in existence for around 150 years.

He was made ''sociétaire'' in 1864. There were 21 {{frac|3|4}} shares and they were divided among the lead actors, known as sociétaires.  The sociétaires co-manage, choose plays, and share profits.  When there was an opening caused by retirement, resignation, or death, it was filled by a member of the pensionnaires. And just four years after joining the Comédie-Française, Coquelin became one of the elite sociétaires. During the next twenty-two years he created at the Comédie Française the leading parts in forty-four new plays, including [[Théodore de Banville]]'s ''Gringoire'' (1867), [[Paul Ferrier]]'s ''Tabarin'' (1871), [[Émile Augier]]'s ''Paul Forestier'' (1871), ''L'Étrangère'' (1876) by [[Alexandre Dumas, fils|the younger Dumas]], [[Charles Lomon]]'s ''Jean Dacier'' (1877), [[Édouard Pailleron]]'s ''Le Monde où l'on s'ennuie'' (1881), [[Erckmann-Chatrian|Erckmann's and Chatrian's]] ''Les Rantzau'' (1884).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In consequence of a dispute with the authorities over the question of his right to make provincial tours in France he resigned in 1886. Three years later, however, the breach was healed; and after a successful series of tours in Europe and the [[United States]] he rejoined the Comédie-Française as ''pensionnaire'' in 1890.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; During his time away from the Comédie he wrote his book ''Art and the Actor.''

It was during this period that he took the part of Labussière, in the production of [[Victorien Sardou]]'s ''[[Thermidor (play)|Thermidor]]'', which was banned by the government after three performances. In 1892 he broke definitely with the Comédie-Française, and toured for some time through the capitals of Europe with a company of his own; in [[New York City|New York]], for instance, he performed at [[Knickerbocker Theatre (Broadway)|Abbey's Theatre]] in 1894, playing the lead in ''[[Tartuffe]]'' (his son Jean played Orgon) and Mascarille in ''[[Les Précieuses ridicules]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Here he won successes in [[Edmond Rostand]]'s [[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]] (1897), which he repeated in the summer of 1898 at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London]], [[Émile Bergerat]]'s ''Plus que reine'' (1899), [[Catulle Mendès]]'s ''Scarron'' (1905), and [[Alfred Capus]] and [[Lucien Descaves]]' ''L'Attentat'' (1906).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In 1900 Coquelin toured in America with [[Sarah Bernhardt]], appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway's]] [[Garden Theatre (New York)|Garden Theatre]] in a production of ''Cyrano de Bergerac'' (Bernhardt played Roxane).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The film is thought to be the first ever made with both color and sound. On their return to France he continued with his old colleague to appear in ''L'Aiglon'', at the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt. He was rehearsing for the creation of the leading part in [[Edmond Rostand|Rostand's]] ''Chantecler'', which he was to produce, when he died suddenly in [[Paris]] in 1909.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' printed an obituary, in which it described many tributes to the dead actor, including a visit by the personal secretary of the President of the Republic, [[Armand Fallières]].&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt;

Coquelin was an Officier de l'Instruction Publique and of the [[Legion of Honour]]. He published:
* ''L'Art et le comédien'' (1880)
* ''Molière et le misanthrope'' (1881)
* essay on [[Eugène Manuel]] (1881)
* essay on [[Sully Prudhomme]] (1882)
* ''L'Arnolphe de Molière'' (1882)
* ''Les Comédiens'' (1882)
* ''L'Art de dire le monologue'' (with his brother, 1884)
* ''Tartuffe'' (1884)
* ''L'Art du comédien'' (1894)&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

His brother, [[Ernest Alexandre Honoré Coquelin|Ernest]], and his son, [[Jean Coquelin|Jean]], were also actors.

In [[drama]], particularly the [[tragedies]] of [[classical antiquity]], the '''catastrophe''' is the final resolution in a poem or narrative plot, which unravels the intrigue and brings the piece to a close. In comedies, this may be a marriage between [[main character]]s; in tragedies, it may be the death of one or more main characters. It is the final part of a play, following the [[protasis]], [[epitasis]], and [[catastasis]].

The catastrophe is either simple or complex, for which also the [[fable]] and action are denominated. In a simple catastrophe, there is no change in the state of the main characters, nor any discovery or unravelling; the plot being only a mere passage out of agitation, to quiet and repose. This catastrophe is rather accommodated to the nature of the [[Epic poetry|epic]] poem, than of the tragedy.&lt;ref name="cyclo"&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a complex catastrophe, the main character undergoes a change of fortune, sometimes by means of a discovery, and sometimes without. The qualifications of this change are that it be probable and necessary: in order to be probable, it must be the natural result or effect of the foregoing actions, ''i.e.'' it must spring from the subject itself, or take its rise from the incidents, and not be introduced merely to serve a turn.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

The ''discovery'' in a complex catastrophe must have the same qualifications as the catastrophe itself, of which it is a principal part: it must be both probable and necessary. To be probable, it must spring out of the subject itself; not affected by means of marks or tokens, rings, bracelets, or by a mere recollection, as is frequently done both in ancient and modern times. To be necessary, it must never leave the characters it concerns in the same sentiments they had before, but still produce either love or hatred, etc. Sometimes, the change consists in the discovery, sometimes it follows at a distance, and sometimes results immediately from it; the last was used, for example, in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

Among critics, it has long been debated whether the catastrophe should always end happily, and favorably on the side of virtue, or not; ''i.e.'' whether virtue is always to be rewarded, and vice punished, in the catastrophe. [[Aristotle]], for example, preferred a shocking catastrophe, rather than a happy one; in that regard, the moving of terror and pity, which is the aim of tragedy, is better effected by the former than the latter.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

[[René Le Bossu]], a 17th-century French critic, divides the catastrophe, at least with regards to epics, into the unravelling, or ''[[denouement]]'', and the finishing, or ''achievement''; the latter of which he makes the result of the former, and to consist in the hero's passage out of a state of trouble and agitation, to rest and quiet. This period is but a point, without extent or duration; in which it differs from the former, which comprehends everything after the plot is laid. He adds, that there are several unravellings in a piece, each interconnected. The ''finishing'' is the end of the last unravelling.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

In the twentieth century, [[John Ronald Reuel Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]] distinguished between what he called the ''catastrophe'' and the ''[[eucatastrophe]]''. The eucatastrophe is a classical catastrophe with an unexpected positive outcome for the protagonist. This term was coined to distance itself from the vernacular use of the word 'catastrophe' to signify disaster (which gave the term negative connotations in everyday usage).

== Career ==

After growing up in [[North Humberside]], she attended the [[University of Manchester]], graduating with a history degree in 1991. She subsequently completed her doctorate under the supervision of Dave Russell at the [[University of Central Lancashire]]; she was awarded her [[PhD]] in 1996 for her thesis [http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?did=3&amp;uin=uk.bl.ethos.320383 ''Women and leisure in Manchester, 1920–c.1960'']. In 1998, Langhamer started working as an academic at the [[University of Sussex]] and, as of 2017, is Professor of Modern British History there. She is also Director of Doctoral Studies in the School of History, Art History and Philosophy.&lt;ref name="prof"&gt;[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/102970 "Prof Claire Langhamer"], ''University of Sussex''. Retrieved 7 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, she is a Fellow of the [[Royal Historical Society]] (FRHistS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://5hm1h4aktue2uejbs1hsqt31-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/RHS-Fellows-L.pdf "Fellows – L"] (Royal Historical Society). Retrieved 8 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Langhamer's work has focused on the history of emotion, love, leisure and work in twentieth-century Britain, often in relation to the experiences of women. Alongside more than a dozen articles in peer-reviewed journals, Langhamer has published two books, ''Women's Leisure in England, 1920–1960'' (Manchester University Press, 2000) and  ''The English in Love: The Intimate Story of an Emotional Revolution'' (Oxford University Press, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/102970/publications "Prof Claire Langhamer: selected publications"], ''University of Sussex''.

A '''cotton mill''' is a building housing [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] or [[weaving]] machinery for the production of [[yarn]] or [[cloth]] from [[cotton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Cotton mill|work=Collins English Dictionary|publication-place=Glasgow|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/cotton-mill|accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; an important product during the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the development of the [[factory system]].{{sfn|Wadsworth|Mann|1931|p=97}}

Although some were driven by [[animal power]], most early mills were built in rural areas at fast-flowing rivers and streams using [[water wheels]] for power.{{sfn|Hills|1970|pp=92, 94}} The development of viable [[Watt steam engine|steam engines]] by [[Boulton and Watt]] from 1781 led to the growth of larger, steam-powered mills allowing them to be concentrated in urban [[mill towns]], like [[Manchester]], which with neighbouring [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] had more than 50 mills by 1802.&lt;ref name="Thompson-SocialHistory"&gt;{{Citation|last=Thompson|first=F. M. L.|year=1993|contribution=Town and city|contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1x-OEg8f1ykC&amp;pg=PA27|editor-last=Thompson|editor-first=F. M.

The mechanisation of the spinning process in the early factories was instrumental in the growth of the [[machine tool]] industry, enabling the construction of larger cotton mills. [[Joint stock company|Limited companies]] were developed to construct mills, and the trading floors of the [[Manchester Royal Exchange|cotton exchange in Manchester]], created a vast commercial city. Mills generated employment, drawing workers from largely rural areas and expanding urban populations. They provided incomes for girls and women. [[Child labour]] was used in the mills, and the factory system led to [[organised labour]]. Poor conditions became the subject of [[Exposé (journalism)|exposé]]s, and in England, the [[Factory Acts]] were written to regulate them.

The cotton mill, originally a [[Lancashire]] phenomenon, was copied in [[New England]] and later in the southern states of America. In the 20th century, [[North West England]] lost its supremacy to the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/25d.asp|title=The First American Factories [ushistory.org]|last=ushistory.org|website=www.ushistory.org|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/lowe/learn/photosmultimedia/early_american.htm|title=Early American Manufacturing – Lowell National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; then to India and subsequently to China.

==History==
In the mid-16th century Manchester was an important manufacturing centre for woollens and linen and market for textiles made elsewhere.{{sfn|Freeman|Rogers|Kinvig|1968|p=66|ps=}} The [[fustian]] district of [[Lancashire]], from Blackburn to Bolton, west to Wigan and Leigh and south towards Manchester, used [[flax]] and raw cotton imported along the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]].

===Key inventions===
{{main article|Textile manufacturing}}
[[File:Cotton mill.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Lancashire cotton mill, 1914]]
During the Industrial Revolution cotton manufacture changed from a [[putting out system|domestic]] to a mechanised industry, made possible by inventions and advances in technology. The [[weaving]] process was the first to be mechanised by the invention of [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]]'s [[flying shuttle]] in 1733. The manually-operated [[spinning jenny]] was developed by [[James Hargreaves]] in about 1764 speeded up the [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] process.&lt;ref&gt;Wadsworth &amp; Mann; Hills, ''Power in the Industrial Revolution''.&lt;/ref&gt; The roller spinning principle of Paul and Bourne became the basis of [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[spinning frame]] and [[water frame]], patented in 1769.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hammond|first=J.L.|authorlink1 = John Lawrence Hammond|last2=Hammond|first2=Barbara|authorlink2 = Barbara Hammond|title=The Skilled Labourer 1760–1832| url=https://archive.org/details/skilledlabourer00hammiala|format=pdf|publisher=Longmans, Green and co.|year=1919|location=London|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles of the spinning jenny and water frame were combined by [[Samuel Crompton]] in his [[spinning mule]] of 1779, but water power was not applied to it until 1792.&lt;ref&gt;W. English, ''Textile Industry'' (1969), 45–55 71–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Many mills were built after Arkwright's patent expired in 1783 and by 1788, there were about 210 mills in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;S. D. Chapman, 'The Arkwright Mills – Colquhouns's Census of 1788 and Archaeological Evidence' ''Industrial Archaeology Review'' VI(1) (1981–2), 5–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of cotton mills was linked to the development of the machinery they contained. By 1774, 30,000 people in Manchester were employed using the domestic system in cotton manufacture. Handloom weaving lingered into the mid-19th century but cotton spinning in mills relying on water power and subsequently steam power using fuel from the [[Lancashire Coalfield]] began to develop before 1800.{{sfn|Freeman|Rogers|Kinvig|1968|p=67|ps=}}

{{Main article|Paul-Wyatt cotton mills}}
The first cotton mills were established in the 1740s to house [[Cotton-spinning machinery|roller spinning machinery]] invented by [[Lewis Paul]] and [[John Wyatt (inventor)|John Wyatt]].{{sfn|Wadsworth|Mann|1931|p=431}}{{sfn|Mantoux|2006|p=208}}{{sfn|Jones|1999|p=24}}{{sfn|Žmolek|2013|p=387}} The machines were the first to spin cotton mechanically "without the intervention of human fingers".{{sfn|Mantoux|2006|p=212}} They were driven by a single non-human power source which allowed the use of larger machinery and made it possible to concentrate production into organised [[factories]].{{sfn|Žmolek|2013|pp=425–426}} Four mills were set up to house Paul and Wyatt's machinery in the decade following its patent in 1738: the short-lived, animal-powered [[Upper Priory Cotton Mill]] in [[Birmingham]] in 1741;{{sfn|Wadsworth|Mann|1931|pp=431–433}} [[Marvel's Mill]] in [[Northampton]] operated from 1742 until 1764 and was the first to be powered by a [[water wheel]];{{sfn|Wadsworth|Mann|1931|p=433}} [[Pinsley Mill]] in [[Leominster]] probably opened in 1744 and operated until it burned down in 1754;{{sfn|Wadsworth|Mann|1931|pp=442–444}} and a second mill in Birmingham set up by [[Samuel Touchet]] in 1744, about which little is known, but which was sufficiently successful for Touchet later to seek the lease on the mill in Northampton.{{sfn|Wadsworth|Mann|1931|pp=444–445}} The Paul-Wyatt mills spun cotton for several decades but were not very profitable,{{sfn|Žmolek|2013|p=391}}{{sfn|Kerridge|1988|p=170}} becoming the ancestors of the cotton mills that followed.{{sfn|Mantoux|2006|p=208}}{{sfn|Wadsworth|Mann|1931|p=415}}

====Arkwright-type mills====
{{Main article|Richard Arkwright}}
[[File:Cromford 1771 mill.jpg|thumb|right|[[Richard Arkwright]]'s first 1771 [[Cromford Mill]] in [[Derbyshire]], with three of its original five storeys remaining]]
[[Richard Arkwright]] obtained a [[patent]] for his [[water frame]] spinning machinery in 1769.{{sfn|Žmolek|2013|p=431}} Although its technology was similar to that of [[Lewis Paul]], [[John Wyatt (inventor)|John Wyatt]], [[James Hargreaves]] and [[Thomas Highs]], Arkwright's powers of organisation, business acumen and ambition established the cotton mill as a successful business model and revolutionary example of the [[factory system]].{{sfn|Mantoux|2006|p=225}}{{sfn|Žmolek|2013|p=431}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Marglin|first=Stephen A.|year=1974|publication-date=1996|contribution=What do Bosses do? |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FMr8IMoUGH8C&amp;pg=PA36|editor-last=Lippit|editor-first=Victor D.|title=Radical Political Economy: Explorations in Alternative Economic Analysis|publication-place=Armonk, N.Y.|publisher=M.E.

Arkwright recruited large, highly disciplined workforces for his mills, managed credit and supplies and cultivated mass consumer markets for his products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Getzler|first=Joshua|year=2004|title=A History of Water Rights at Common Law|publication-place=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=26|isbn=0-19-826581-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WtGTAWkeJq8C&amp;pg=PA26|accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1782 his annual profits exceeded £40,000,{{sfn|Žmolek|2013|p=437}} and by 1784 he had opened 10 more mills.{{sfn|Žmolek|2013|p=436}} He licensed his technology to other entrepreneurs&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Getzler|first=Joshua|year=2004|title=A History of Water Rights at Common Law|publication-place=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=27|isbn=0-19-826581-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WtGTAWkeJq8C&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1782 boasted that his machinery was being used by "numbers of adventurers residing in the different counties of Derby, Leicester, Nottingham, Worcester, Stafford, York, Hertford and Lancashire"{{sfn|Wadsworth|Mann|1931|p=430}} and by 1788 there were 143 Arkwright-type mills nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Aspin|first=Chris|year=1981|title=The Cotton Industry|publication-place=Aylesbury|publisher=Osprey Publishing|page=12|isbn=0-85263-545-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=re-aQ_u1srcC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early mills were of light construction, narrow – about {{convert|9|ft|m}} wide – and low in height, with ceiling heights of only 6–8&amp;nbsp;ft.{{sfn|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=49}} The mills were powered by water wheels and lit by daylight. Mills were made by [[millwright]]s, builders and [[iron founder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 18th century there were about 900 cotton mills in Britain, of which approximately 300 were large Arkwright-type factories employing 300 to 400 workers, the rest, smaller mills using [[spinning jenny|jennies]] or [[spinning mule|mules]], were hand- or horse-driven and employed as few as 10 workers.{{sfn|Crouzet|2008|pp=31–32}}

====Early steam mills====
[[File:MurraysMillsOldDeckerMill.jpg|thumb|[[Old Mill, Manchester|Old Mill]], built as a steam-powered mill in [[Ancoats]] in 1798, is the oldest surviving cotton mill in [[Manchester]]]]
Before 1780, only water power was available to drive large mills,{{sfn|Hills|1970|pp=92, 134}} but they were dependent on a constant flow of water and built in rural locations, causing problems of labour supply, transportation of materials and access to urban merchants for large mill-owners.{{sfn|Hills|1970|p=94}} [[Steam engine]]s had been used to pump water since the invention of the [[atmospheric engine]] by [[Thomas Newcomen]] in 1712{{sfn|Hills|1970|p=134}} and, starting with the engine installed at Arkwright's [[Haarlem Mill]] in [[Wirksworth]], Derbyshire in 1780, were used to supplement the supply of water to the water wheels of cotton mills.{{sfn|Tann|1979|p=248}}

In 1781 [[James Watt]] registered a patent for the first [[Watt steam engine|rotative steam engine]] designed to "give motion to the wheels of mills or other machines".{{sfn|Hills|1989|p=63}} Concerns remained over the smoothness of the power supplied by a steam engine to cotton mills, where  the regularity of the yarn produced was dependent on the regularity of the power supply,{{sfn|Hills|1970|pp=136–137}} and it was not until 1785 at [[Papplewick]], in Robinson's Mill near Nottingham that a steam engine was successfully used to drive a cotton mill directly.{{sfn|Tann|1979|p=249}} [[Boulton and Watt]]'s engines enabled mills to be built in urban contexts and transformed the economy of Manchester, whose importance had previously been as a centre of pre-industrial spinning and weaving{{sfn|Timmins|1996|p=12}} based on the domestic system.&lt;ref name="Thompson-SocialHistory" /&gt; Manchester had no cotton mills until the opening of Arkwright's [[Shudehill Mill]] in 1783 and in 1789 [[Peter Drinkwater]] opened the [[Piccadilly Mill]] – the town's first mill to be directly powered by steam – and by 1800 Manchester had 42 mills, having eclipsed all rival textile centres to become the heart of the cotton manufacturing trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Nevell|first=Michael|year=2007|contribution=The Social Archaeology of Industrialisation: the example of Manchester During the 17th and 18th Centuries|contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIHUS9zUTOEC&amp;pg=PA198|editor1-last=Casella|editor1-first=Eleanor Conlin|editor2-last=Symonds|editor2-first=James|title=Industrial Archaeology: Future Directions|publication-place=|publisher=Springer|page=198|isbn=0-387-22831-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIHUS9zUTOEC|accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water continued to be used to drive rural mills but mills, driven by steam, were built in towns alongside streams or canals to provide water for the engine. [[Murrays' Mills]] alongside the [[Rochdale Canal]], in [[Ancoats]] were powered by 40&amp;nbsp;hp Boulton and Watt [[beam engine]]s.{{sfn|Miller|Wild|2007|p=69}}b Some were built as room and power mills, which let space to entrepreneurs. The mills, often 'L' or U-shaped, were narrow and multi-storeyed. The engine house, warehousing and the office were inside the mill, although stair towers were external. Windows were square and smaller than in later mills. The walls were of unadorned rough brick. Construction was sometimes to fireproof designs. The mills are distinguished from warehouses in that warehouses had taking-in doors on each storey with an external hoist beam.{{sfn|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=56}} Only the larger mills have survived.

Mills of this period were from 25 to 68&amp;nbsp;m long and 11.5&amp;nbsp;m to 14&amp;nbsp;m wide. They could be eight storeys high and had basements and attics. Floor height varied from 3.3 to 2.75&amp;nbsp;m on the upper storeys.

[[Boiler]]s were of the wagon type; chimneys were square or rectangular, attached to the mill, and in some cases part of the stair column. The steam engines were typically low-pressure single-cylinder condensing beam engines.{{sfn|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=69}} The average power in 1835 was 48&amp;nbsp;hp.{{sfn|Hills|1989|p=116}} Power was transmitted by a main vertical shaft with bevel gears to the horizontal shafts. The later mills had gas lighting using gas produced on site.{{sfn|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=73}} The [[spinning mule|mules]] with 250–350 spindles were placed transversely to get as much light as possible.

====Early weaving mills====
The development of mills to mechanise the [[weaving]] process was more gradual partly because of the success of [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]]'s 1733 invention of the [[flying shuttle]], which increased the productivity of domestic [[hand loom]] weavers.{{sfn|Timmins|1993|p=18}} Kay took out a patent for the application of water power to a Dutch loom in 1745 and opened a weaving factory in [[Keighley]] in 1750, but nothing is known of its success.{{sfn|Timmins|1993|p=18}} A further attempt to mechanise the weaving process took place at Garrett Hall in Manchester in 1750 but was unsuccessful in enabling one worker to operate more than a single loom.{{sfn|Timmins|1993|p=18}} The first feasible [[power loom]] was patented by [[Edmund Cartwright]] in 1785, although it was initially a primitive device it established the basic principle that would be used in powered weaving until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hunt|first=David|year=2008|contribution=Cartwright, Edmund (1743–1823), ''Church of England clergyman and inventor of a power loom''|contribution-url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4813|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|edition=Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1788 Cartwright opened [[Revolution Mill]] in [[Doncaster]] which was powered by a Boulton and Watt steam engine and had 108 power looms on three floors as well as spinning machinery, but it was not a commercial success and closed in 1790.{{sfn|Hills|1970|pp=218–219}} A second mill using Cartwright's machinery, opened in [[Manchester]] in 1790 but was burned to the ground by hand loom weavers within two years.{{sfn|Timmins|1993|p=19}} By 1803 there were only 2,400 power looms operating in Britain.{{sfn|Hills|1970|p=227}}

====Early American mills====
[[File:Pawtucket slater mill.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Slater's Mill]] in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]], built in 1790]]
In the United States, the early horse-powered [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]] was designed by [[Thomas Somers]], who started construction and testing of the facility in 1787, finishing the factory's equipment in 1788. Experience from this factory led [[Moses Brown (Providence)|Moses Brown]] of Providence to request the assistance of a person skilled in water-powered spinning. [[Samuel Slater]], an immigrant and trained textile worker from England, accepted Brown's proposal, and assisted with the design and construction of [[Slater Mill Historic Site|Slater Mill]], built in 1790 on the [[Blackstone River]] in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]]. Slater evaded restrictions on emigration put in place to allow England to maintain its monopoly on cotton mills. Slater Mill resembled the Beverly Cotton Manufactory and a mill in Derbyshire in which he had worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quayle|2006|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall, William R.

===Remodelling and expansion (1815–1855)===

====United Kingdom====
From 1825 the steam engine was able to power larger machines constructed from iron using improved machine tools. Mills from 1825 to 1865 were generally constructed with wooden beamed floors and lath and plaster ceilings. [[William Fairbairn]] experimented with cast iron beams and concrete floors. Mills were of red brick or sometimes local stone with a greater attention to decoration and the main gate was often highlighted with stone decoration. The stair columns were exterior to the main floors.&lt;ref name="Farniep74"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the mules got wider and the width of the bays increased. Specialised mill architects appeared.  
[[File:McConnel &amp; Company mills, about 1820.jpg|thumb|McConnel &amp; Company mills, about 1820]]
[[File:Dampfkessel für eine Stationärdampfmaschine im Textilmuseum Bocholt.jpg|thumb|[[William Fairbairn]]'s Lancashire boiler]]
Mills of this period were tall, narrow, and wide. They were commonly built with one or two wings to form an 'L' or 'U' shape. Brunswick Mill was a 28-bay mill, 6 storeys of 16&amp;nbsp;m by 92&amp;nbsp;m. Each self-acting [[spinning mule]] had 500&amp;nbsp;spindles.&lt;ref name="Farniep74"/&gt; Single-storey north light weaving sheds were sometimes added to the mills. The looms caused vibrations that damaged the structure of multi-storey buildings,&lt;ref name="Williamsp11"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and specialised weaving mills became common. They were single-storey sheds with an engine house and offices, and preparation and warehousing in a two-storey ancillary building.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Large mills remained the exception during this period. In 1833 the largest mill was that of [[McConnel &amp; Kennedy Mills|McConnel and Company]] in [[Ancoats]], Manchester with 1,545 workers, but in 1841 there were still only 25 mills in Lancashire with 1,000 workers or more, and the number of workers in the average mill was 193.{{sfn|Crouzet|2008|p=32}}

The [[Lancashire boiler]] was patented in 1844, and the [[economiser]] in 1845. This can be seen as a square brick structure between the boiler house and the chimney. The engines were double compound upright beam engines of the type patented by McNaught in 1845. Each room in the mill would have line shafts suitable for the type of frame, connected by belt drives or gearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, there were 2650 cotton mills in the Lancashire region, employing 440,000 people. The workers, 90 per cent of whom were adults and 56 per cent females, were paid a total of  ₤11.5&amp;nbsp;million per annum. The mills used 300,000&amp;nbsp;hp of power, of which 18,500 was generated by waterpower. The mills had 30,387,467 [[Spinning mule|spindle]]s and 350,000 [[power loom]]s. The industry imported 1,390,938,752&amp;nbsp;lb of raw cotton a year. It exported 2,776,218,427&amp;nbsp;yards of cotton cloth and {{convert|197343655|lbs|kg}} of twist and yarn. The total value of its exports was ₤32,012,380. &lt;!-- Would like to use the convert template here but it moves source in scientific notation --&gt;

1860 saw the end of this period of rapid growth. The [[Lancashire Cotton Famine|Cotton Famine]] of 1861–1865 was a period when American long staple cotton became unavailable due to an [[American Civil War]]. After the war, the economics of the industry had changed, and a new larger mill was required.

====United States====
In 1814 the [[Boston Manufacturing Company]] of [[New England]] established a "fully integrated" mill on the [[Charles River]] at [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. Despite the ban on exporting technology from the UK, one of its proprietors, [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]], had travelled to Manchester to study the mill system and memorised some of its details. In the same year, [[Paul Moody (inventor)|Paul Moody]] built the first successful power loom in the US. Moody used a system of overhead pulleys and leather belting, rather than bevel gearing, to power his machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nps.gov/lowe/planyourvisit/upload/suffolk.pdf |title = Suffolk Mills Turbine Exhibit|website = Lowell National Historical Park|publisher = National Parks Service|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170703031419/https://www.nps.gov/lowe/planyourvisit/upload/suffolk.pdf|archivedate = 3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group devised the [[Lowell system|Waltham System]] of working, which was duplicated at [[History of Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell, Massachusetts]] and several other new cities throughout the state. Mill girls, some as young as ten, were paid less than men, but received a fixed wage for their 73-hour week. They lived in company-owned boarding houses, and attended churches supported by the companies.&lt;ref name="dublin"&gt;Dublin, Thomas (1975).

In the 1840s [[George Henry Corliss]] of [[Providence, Rhode Island]] improved the reliability of [[stationary steam engine]]s. He replaced [[slide valve]]s with valves that used cams. These [[Corliss steam engine|Corliss valves]] were more efficient and more reliable than their predecessors. Initially, steam engines pumped water into a nearby reservoir that powered the water wheel, but were later used as the mill's primary power source. The Corliss valve was adopted in the UK, where in 1868 more than 60&amp;nbsp;mill engines were fitted with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hills|1989|pp=178–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
The large steam-powered Bowreath Cotton Mills opened at Fort Gloster near [[Calcutta]] by British interests in the 1820s, using British women to impart machine-spinning skills to the local workforce.{{sfn| Majumdar|2012|p=96}} They closed down in 1837 but reopened with [[Dwarkanath Tagore]] as a major shareholder, and by 1840 lay at the centre of a major industrial complex powered by five steam engines, that included a twist mill, foundry and a rum distillery.{{sfn| Majumdar|2012|p=96}}

===Golden Age (1855–1898)===
[[File:Reddish Mill 1.jpg|thumb|Central office and warehouse block, [[Houldsworth Mill, Reddish]]]]

====United Kingdom====
Just before 1870, a mill was built by a joint-stock spinning company and this financial structure led to a new wave of mill construction. The phrase [[Oldham Limiteds]] describes these companies. Family-run firms continued to build, but grouped into associations such as the [[Fine Spinners and Doublers|Fine Spinners' and Doublers' Association]]. Joseph [[Stott]] of Oldham perfected a method of fireproof floor construction using steel beams supporting brick vaults that in turn supported concrete floors that would support heavier equipment. Ring frames replaced mule frames; they were heavier and larger and were placed transversely, the floors became larger (up to {{convert|130|ft|m}} wide) and higher to provide light. The bay size in a mill was defined by the positioning of machines. In an 1870 mill the bay was typically {{convert|10|ft|6|in}}, and the brick vaults {{convert|5|ft|3|in}} though there were variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engines were run at higher pressures and from 1875, powered horizontal shafts on each floor by means of ropes. This was a prominent change as a rope race had to be built running the height of the mill. The engine needed more space and the engine house, boiler house and economiser were external to the main mill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills1989|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mills continued to get bigger, and were sometimes paired; two mills being driven by one engine. Another change was the trend of having carding on one floor. To achieve this, the ground floor was extended outwards behind the mill often a full mill width.&lt;ref name="Williamsp94"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a single mill, the crosswall divided the blowing room from the rest, as it was here that there was greatest risk of fire.

Mills became wider, [[Houldsworth Mill, Reddish]] (1865) was 35&amp;nbsp;m wide and accommodated 1200 spindle mules. It was of four storeys and had sixteen bays on each side of a central engine house; a [[double mill]]. The central block provided offices and warehousing. A mill had a range of ancillary buildings.&lt;ref name="Williamsp94"/&gt;  Stair columns often extending above the mill and housed a water tank for the sprinkler system. The floors were higher allowing for taller windows. Accrington brick was used from 1890, decorated with yellow sandstone with moulded brick and [[terracotta]] features. Etched and stained glass was used in the offices. Mills were designed by specialist architects and architectural quality became a major consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power needed and provided to drive these mills was increasing. [[Beam engine]]s were installed until the 1870s when horizontal engines took over. Abbey Mill Oldham (1876) needed 700&amp;nbsp;hp, Nile Mill (1896) needed 2500&amp;nbsp;hp. By the 1890, boilers produced 160&amp;nbsp;psi, and the [[Stationary steam engine|triple expansion horizontals]] became standard. Chimneys were octagonal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
Following the [[American Civil War]], mills grew larger. They were built in the southern states of [[South Carolina]], [[Alabama]], and [[Mississippi]] where cheap labour and plentiful water power made operations profitable. Cotton could be processed into fabric where it grew, saving transportation costs. The mills were usually combination mills, (spinning and weaving) that were water powered and used a slow burn design technique. They used a belt and pulley drive system, and heavier ring frames rather than mules. At this point they only spun and wove coarse counts. The mills were mainly in open country and [[mill town]]s were formed to support them. [[New England]] mills found it increasingly difficult to compete, and as in Lancashire, went into gradual decline until [[bankruptcy|bankrupted]] during the [[Great Depression]]. Cotton mills and their owners dominated the economy and politics of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] well into the 20th century.  &lt;!-- Local knowledge should be added here --&gt;

====Asia====
The modern Indian  mechanised textile industry was born in 1854, when a steam-powered mill was opened in [[Bombay]] by Cowasjee N. Davar.{ More followed: there were 10 by 1865 and 47 by 1875. By 1880 there were 58 mills in India employing 40,000 workers, with over 80% of them in the cities of Bombay and [[Ahmedabad]].{{From the 1870 s India's own markets for finished yarn and cloth ceased to be dominated by imports from [[Lancashire]], and during the 1870 s and 1880 s the Bombay cotton industry began to replace exports of yarn from Britain to [[China]].

===Edwardian mills (1898–1914)===
The cotton industry was subject to cycles of boom and slump, which caused waves of mill building. There was an optimism that dictated that slumps had to be endured and then there would be a period of even greater prosperity. The limited companies took control of spinning, while the room and power system was the norm for the weaving sheds. One point of view in the 1880s was that vertically integrating the weaving sheds into new mills would reduce costs and lead to greater profits. This route had been followed in New England, where it was successful, but not in Lancashire. The industry peaked in 1907. There was a severe slump in 1908, which endured until 1918, but the years 1919 and 1920 were more profitable than the peak year of 1907 had been.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holden|1998|pp=165–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
[[File:Broadstone Mill - geograph.org.uk - 707883.jpg|thumb|[[Broadstone Mill, Reddish|Broadstone Mill]], in [[Reddish]], was a large double mill built in 1906.]]
Production peaked in 1912. The war of 1914–1918 put the Lancashire industry into reverse. The British government, starved of raw cotton, established mills in south Asia exporting the spinning technology – which was copied, and became a low-labour cost competitor. In Germany, Flanders and Brazil, mills were built to the designs of the [[Stott|Oldham architects]]. The only new mills were very large to benefit from the economies of scale. Older mills were re-equipped with rings, and machines were powered by individual electric motors.

Mills of this period were large, their decoration was lavish reflecting Edwardian taste and prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most mills were built for mules. Kent Mill Chadderton (1908) was a five storey, 11 bay mill, 84.6m x 43.9m. It had 90,000 spindles. Ring frames were smaller and heavier than mules so the mills were narrower with fewer storeys. Pear Mill Bredbury (1912) was planned to be a 210,000 spindle double mill.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the first mill was completed, it had 137,000 spindles. They had more stair columns than earlier mills, it had dust flues often built into the rope race. There were two or three windows per bay. Decoration was often in terracotta and the mill name displayed in white brick on the stair tower or chimney.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stott and Sons employed Byzantine styling in Broadstone Mill, Reddish.
Specialist architects built new mills and then created extensions. The last steam-powered mill, Elk Mill, was built by Arthur Turner

Mules were built with 1300 spindles, but were gradually replaced by rings.

The increasingly powerful engines required more boilers with economisers and superheaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mills needed reservoirs to supply the boilers and condense the steam. The chimneys were round and taller. Three types of engines were used: triple expansion horizontal cross compound engines, Inverted marine type compounds which were more compact, and Manhattans with vertical and horizontal cylinders such as the 3500&amp;nbsp;hp engine at New Pear Mill. Rope drives were used exclusively. Electricity was gradually introduced firstly on group drives driving a shaft (Little Mill, 1908), and then later on individual machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
&lt;!--[[File:Wareshoalsearlymill.jpg|thumb|[[Ware Shoals, South Carolina|Ware Shoals]] Mill, South Carolina]] now a redlink --&gt;
Mills constructed in [[South Carolina]] increased in size. At Rutledge Ford the [[Saluda River]] was dammed and a power plant constructed. It was completed in 1904 before the construction of a state-of-the-art textile mill in 1906. That power plant provided for 4,800 horse power. The mill contained 30,000 spindles. By 1916 a new mill was constructed, containing 70,200 spindles and 1,300 looms. The town was named [[Ware Shoals, South Carolina|Ware Shoals]]. Between 1904 and 1916, the population of Ware Shoals grew from 2 men employed to maintain the newly constructed power plant, to 2,000. By the 1960s the mill employed 5,000 people. It closed in 1985. &lt;!-- C&amp;P from WP:Ware Shoal- cant find reference- other example could be subst- if suitable photo- like to use stats from lifeinmillcommun00simprich_djvu.txt.html --&gt;

===Consolidation (1918–50)===
[[File:Elk Mill.jpg|thumb|Elk Mill, on the Chadderton-Royton boundary, in [[Greater Manchester]], England]]
Though business revived in 1919, a shortage of building materials restricted the building of new mills, and activity was financial with the mills seeking recapitalisation. There is no clear concession on the reason for the final decline. Some say that the cotton men concentrated on making easy money ignoring the possibility of foreign competition best countered by larger mills by re-equipping the mills with more modern ring frames. Daniels and Jewkes argued the fundamental cause of the depression was a change in demand for cotton goods. J. M. Keynes suggested that there was over capacity, and the industry should be reorganised into larger units that would scrap the excess capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holden|1998|pp=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lancashire Cotton Corporation]] was a company set up by the Bank of England in 1929, to rescue the Lancashire spinning industry by means of consolidation. In merged 105 companies, ending up in 1950 with 53 operating mills. These were the later larger mills. It was bought up by Courtaulds in August 1964.

The later mills were on the fringe of the spinning area in Wigan and Stockport, Availability of labour was cited as a reason.The last mills were completed in 1927, these were Holden Mill (Astley Bridge Mill)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.heritage-explorer.co.uk/web/he/searchdetail.aspx?id=8411&amp;crit=cotton|title = Astley Bridge Mill, Blackburn Road, Bolton, Greater Manchester|website = Heritage Explorer |publisher = Historic England}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Elk Mill.&lt;ref name=H69&gt;{{harvnb|Holden|1998|pp=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, for the first time there were more spindles in the USA than in the UK. In 1972, India had greater spindleage than the USA, and it was in turn surpassed by China in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cotton mills in the late 20th century (1950–2000)===

====Decline of spinning in England====
Though there was a slight revival after 1945, mills closed. The most efficient mills had abandoned their steam engines, and were working the frames with individual electric motors. [[Broadstone Mill, Reddish|Broadstone Mills Stockport]], was built as a double mill with 265,000  mule spindles, but by 1959 it was running 37,500 mule spindles and 70,000 ring spindles. It closed in 1959 taking advantage of the [[Cotton Industry Act 1959]] and was then used by the John Myers mail order company. One mill was later demolished leaving the other to be used as a Shopping Outlet Centre and Craft Village.
The reduction of capacity led to a legacy of redundant mills, which were readily reused for other industrial purposes.

Ring spinning technology had successfully replaced the spinning mule, with mills having been converted mules to rings. However in the 1970s, the depleted industry was challenged by a new technology open-end or break spinning. In 1978 [[Carrington Viyella]] opened a factory to do open-end spinning in [[Atherton, Greater Manchester|Atherton]]. This was the first new textile production facility in Lancashire since 1929. Immediately [[Pear New Mill|Pear Mill, Stockport]] and Alder Mill, Leigh were closed. These were both Edwardian mills designed by Stott and Sons.&lt;ref name=H69/&gt;
The mill built in 1978 was built on the Howe Bridge mills site and was named Unit One. It was not an open end mill but a combed cotton ring mill.

===Modern cotton mills===
Modern spinning mills are mainly built around [[open end spinning]] techniques using rotors or [[ring spinning]] techniques using spindles. In 2009 there were 202,979,000 ring spinning spindles installed worldwide, with 82% of these being in [[Asia]] or [[Oceania]] and 44% being within [[China]]. In the same year there were 7,975,000 open end spinning rotors installed, with 44% of these being within Asia or Oceania and 29% within [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref name="Plastina"&gt;{{Citation|last=Plastina|first=Alejandro|year=2009|title=Open-End Versus Ring Spun Cotton Yarns|publication-place=Washington D.

Modern cotton mills are increasingly automated. One large mill in [[Virginia]] in the United States employs 140 workers in 2013 to produce an output that would have required more than 2,000 workers in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Clifford|first=Stephanie|title=U.S. Textile Plants Return, With Floors Largely Empty of People|newspaper=New York Times|publication-place=New York|publisher=The New York Times Company|publication-date=2013-09-19|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/business/us-textile-factories-return.html|accessdate=2013-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
Cotton mills were not confined to Lancashire but were built in northeast [[Cheshire]], [[Derbyshire]], [[Nottingham]], the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], [[Bristol]], [[Durham, England|Durham]] and the west of Scotland.{{sfn|Freeman|Rogers|Kinvig|1968|p=67|ps=}} The availability of streams or rivers to provide power determined the location of the early mills some of which were in isolated areas. In Lancashire they were built on the rivers and streams descending from the [[Pennines]] and [[Rossendale]] [[moorland]]. In some places quite small streams powered a string of small mills such as in the [[Cheesden Valley]] between [[Ramsbottom]] and [[Heywood, Greater Manchester|Heywood]].{{sfn|Ashmore|1969|p=40|ps=}} where 14 mills and their associated leats and ponds were concentrated along a four-mile stretch of the brook. Mills were built around [[Rochdale]] and [[Littleborough, Greater Manchester|Littleborough]]. North of [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]], ten mills occupied a mile long stretch of a stream in the Shuttleworth Valley.{{sfn|Ashmore|1969|p=42|ps=}} Other mills were built north of the River Ribble and a cluster of five mills in [[Caton, Lancashire|Caton]] near the port at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], one of which belonged to [[Samuel Greg]] who built [[Quarry Bank Mill]] at [[Styal]] in Cheshire. Not all water-powered mills were in rural areas, after 1780 mills were built in [[Blackburn]] and [[Burnley]].{{sfn|Ashmore|1969|p=43|ps=}}

In Scotland, four cotton mills were built in [[Rothesay, Bute|Rothsay]] on the [[Isle of Bute]] using labour that had experience of the linen industry.{{sfn|Burton|1973|p=162|ps=}} By 1800 there were two water-powered mills at [[Gatehouse of Fleet]] employing 200 children and 100 adults.{{sfn|Burton|1973|p=163|ps=}} [[Robert Owen]] who had worked for Peter Drinkwater in Manchester, developed the mills at [[New Lanark]] built by his father-in-law, [[David Dale]] under licence from Arkwright.{{sfn|Burton|1973|p=165|ps=}}

==Architecture==

===Fireproof construction===
{{see also|Fireproofing}}
Cotton mills were huge fire risks, cotton fibres in the air could form an explosive mixture in their gas-lit interiors. The first mills using fireproof construction were built in Shropshire and Derbyshire in the 1790s and Philips &amp; Lee's mill built in Salford in 1801-2. Fireproofing took the form of [[cast iron]] columns and beams from which sprang [[jack arch]]es that were infilled with ash or sand and covered with stone flags or floorboards. In some mills timber was also eliminated from the roof structure which was supported by cast or [[wrought iron]] trusses.&lt;ref name ="LC"&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/cities/manchester/topics-and-themes/fireproof-construction.html|title= Fireproof construction|publisher= Looking at Buildings |accessdate=|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170625150055/http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/cities/manchester/topics-and-themes/fireproof-construction.html|archivedate = 25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the properties of cast iron were properly understood some mills constructed using the early technology collapsed. In Manchester extensive testing of cast iron as a structural material was carried out by [[Eaton Hodgkinson]] and [[William Fairbairn]] in the early 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/cities/manchester/topics-and-themes/cast-iron-technology-in-manchester.html |title= Cast-Iron Technology in Manchester|publisher= Looking at Buildings |accessdate=|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170625164504/http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/cities/manchester/topics-and-themes/cast-iron-technology-in-manchester.html|archivedate = 25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fireproof construction was expensive and timber, sometimes clad in plaster or metal continued to be used throughout the 19th century. Rolled steel beams and reinforced concrete flooring was introduced in a limited way in the 1880s but not widely adopted in Lancashire mills until the 20th century.&lt;ref name ="LC"/&gt;

===Other factors===
Cotton is sensitive to temperature and humidity. Heating systems used wrought iron pipes suspended at a height of {{convert|7|ft|m}} to carry steam under pressure. In summer the system was barely used but in winter the boilers would be fired up two hours before the shift started to warm up the mill. As heat was applied the humidity dropped and system of humidifiers, either atomisers which played an air jet against a jet of water or ones that injected a stream/air mixture into the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasmith|1895|pp=87–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early fire fighting systems used sprinklers supplied by water captured on flat roofs in shallow tanks. Later mills had a water tank at the top of the stair tower. Water for the sprinklers had to be protected from freezing and evaporation. Water pressure needed to be above 7&amp;nbsp;psi, and the header tank at least {{convert|15|ft|m}} above the highest sprinkler.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasmith|1895|pp=58–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provision of light, water tanks and heating system defined the structure and shape of the mill.

==Machinery==

===Power===
{{Further|Stationary steam engine|Water wheel}}
The earliest cotton mills were driven by water, so needed to be situated on fast flowing streams. From about 1820, the [[stationary steam engine]] became the normal form of power for a cotton mill, water was still needed to produce the steam and to condense it, to maintain the humidity, for many of the finishing processes and for firefighting. Water was extracted from rivers and canals, then later mills requiring ever more water, built and maintained their own reservoirs.

[[File:SteamEngine Boulton&amp;Watt 1784.png|thumb|[[Boulton and Watt]] engine 1784]]
In 1781 [[James Watt]] marketed a rotary-motion steam engine that could be adapted to drive all sorts of machinery, Richard Arkwright pioneered its use in his cotton mills. Possibly the first steam engine to be used in a cotton mill was a Newcomen engine which was used at [[Shudehill Mill]] in 1783 to raise water between storage ponds  so it could drive a [[water wheel]]. By 1795 most similar engines around Manchester had been replaced by [[Boulton and Watt]] or [[Bateman and Sherratt]] engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hills|1989|pp=42–45,61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electricity was introduced in 1877. Steam engine drove generators to provide electric lighting. By the 1890s this was common.{{sfn|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=119}} Electricity was used to drive the mills machinery by 1906. It was generated in the engine house, and one group-drive electric motor was placed on each floor to drive the shafts. Generators were placed exterior to the mill as it was thought that they were a fire risk. Mains driven mills started about 1907. Later mills used individual electric motors to power the machinery.

===Transmission ===
[[File:Queen Street Mill - Weaving Shed - geograph.org.uk - 528579.jpg|thumb|A weaving shed, showing how all the looms were powered from overhead shafts]]
The early mills had a vertical shaft to take the power from the flywheel. On each floor horizontal shafts engaged with the main shaft using bevel gearing. American mills used thick leather bands instead of shafts. A new approach was to use thick cotton ropes. A rope drum was attached to the flywheel with a channel cut for each rope. The profile was such to give maximum adherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasmith|1895|pp=233–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinning===
A spinning mill opened raw cotton bales and cleaned the cotton in the blowing room. The cotton staples are carded into lap and straightened and drawn into roving which is spun using either a mule or ring frame. The yarn can be doubled and processed into thread, or prepared for weaving.

[[Minerva Mill, Ashton-under-Lyne]] was designed by [[Sir Philip Stott, 1st Baronet|P. S. Stott]] and equipped by John Hetherington and Son, it produced 40's twists and 65 wefts. It was typical of a mill of the 1890s.

[[Spinning mule|Self acting mule frame]] (Roberts 1830) was an improvement on [[Spinning mule|Crompton's Mule]] (1779) which derived from earlier inventions.{{sfn|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=9}} Mules were used in the 19th century mills for the finest counts, these needed skilled workers to operate them.

[[Ring spinning|Ring frame]] (1929) developed out of the Throstle frame (19th century) an improvement on the Arkwright's [[Water frame]]. Originally rings were only suitable for coarse counts, they were lower and heavier than mules so needed stronger floors but lower rooms. Over time, rings became suitable for finer counts and because of cheaper labour costs they replaced mules. By 1950 all mills had converted to the Ring frame. The Hawk mill in Shaw near Oldham was still operating cotton mule frames in 1964/65.
{{sfn|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=8}}

===Weaving===
A weaving mill needed yarn suitable for the warp and the weft. The warp had to delivered on the beam, or was wound on the beam from cheeses by a [[Beamer (occupation)|beamer]]. To obtain the extra strength needed, the yarn was sized on a sizer. The weft was wound onto the [[pirn]]s for the shuttle on a pirner. These preparatory processes completed the yarn was woven on a loom. One weaver would operate 4 or six looms. A self-acting loom would stop when any thread broke, and the thread had to be retied or pieced. The process required greater levels of light than spinning, and weaving sheds would often be single storey, with overhead north facing lights. Placing a loom onto the ground also reduced the problems caused by the vibrations of operation.

The  [[Power loom|Cartwright's powerloom]] (1785) was made reliable by [[Roberts Loom|Robert's cast iron power loom]] (1822) and became perfected by the Kenworthy and Bullough [[Lancashire Loom]] (1854). The [[Northrop Loom|Northrop or Draper Loom]] (1895) replaced these older designs.&lt;ref name="Williamsp11"/&gt;

==Labour conditions==
[[File:Some of the spinners in Pell City Cotton Mill, grouped for me by the overseer. Mr. E. A. Thompson, Supt. of the Mill... - NARA - 523355.jpg|thumb|Some of the spinners in a cotton mill, [[Alabama]], 1910]]
The mills were notable in employing women, giving them an independent income.&lt;!-- Trite, in reality early mills were dependent on agreements to obtain women and parish apprentices in the UK. This line needs substance and references suspect [[Quarry Bank Mill]] may help--&gt;  In Lancashire and Piedmont, South Carolina child labour is well documented.

===Child labour in the United Kingdom===
{{main article|Factory Acts}}

The Lancashire and Derbyshire mills needed a pool of cheap labour. [[Pauper apprentice|Pauper children]] were boys and girls between the ages of 7 and 21, who were dependent on the [[Board of Guardians|Poor Law Guardians]]. Mill owners made contracts with the guardians in London and the southern counties to supply them paupers, in batches of 50 or more, to be [[apprentice]]d. Living condition were poor in 'Prentice Houses', and the children who were paid 2d a day worked 15-hour shifts, [[Hot racking|hot bedding]] with children on the other shift.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

[[Robert Owen]] was a millowner in [[New Lanark]]. He never employed children under the age of ten, and opposed physical punishment in schools and factories. He lobbied for parliamentary action, resulting in [[Factory Acts|The Health and Morals of Apprentices Act 1802]].

:* Hours of work limited to twelve a day
:* Boys and girls to sleep in separate dormitories with no more than two to each bed
:* Compulsory education to be provided in the arts of reading writing and arithmetic
:* Each apprentice to be provided with two suits of clothes
:* On Sunday children to be instructed in Christian worship
:* Sanitation to be improved

Regulation was ineffective until the mills were subject to inspection in 1833 with the establishment of a factory inspectorate consisting of four [[factory inspector]]s who had the power of [[magistrate]]s.{{sfnp|Hutchins|Harrison|1911|p=41–42}}&lt;ref name=HSE&gt;{{cite web|title=The history of HSE|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/aboutus/timeline/|website=HSE: Health and Safety Executive|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This did not reduce the number of children, half-timers worked mornings in the mill and spend the afternoon in the school room. While the number of children working in spinning as tenters did decline, more were employed in weaving because weavers were expected to tenter extra looms.

From the Factory Act of 1844, until 1878 records do not distinguish between full-time and half-times.
In 1851 a sizeable number of children were working the mills. For Example, In [[Glossop]], there were 931 children (out of 3562) between 5 and thirteen working in cotton mills. In one mill in 1859, 50.2% of the workforce were women, 24.2% were girls, 19% were men and 6.6% were boys.{{sfn|Quayle|2006|pp=42–46,53}}

===Child labor in the United States===
[[File:Child laborer.jpg|thumb|A little spinner in the Mollahan Mills, [[Newberry, South Carolina]]. She was tending her 'sides' like a veteran, but after I took the photo, the overseer came up and said in an apologetic tone that was pathetic, 'She just happened in.' Then a moment later he repeated the information. The mills appear to be full of youngsters that 'just happened in,' or 'are helping sister.' December 3, 1908. Witness Sara R. Hine. Location: Newberry, South Carolina"]] 
[[File:Spinner in Vivian Cotton Mills. Been at it 2 years.

The [[Piedmont (United States)|Carolinas]] mills developed from 1880, and would employ children in preference to adults. At Newton Mill, North Carolina, in 1909, twenty of the 150 workers observed, appeared to be twelve years old or less. As well as the usual report of hands and fingers getting severed by the machinery and insufferable heat, the dust inhaled caused a fatal condition known as brown lung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/stories/cotton/about/mills4.html|title=Child Labor in the Cotton Mills – The Story: The Mills |website = Stories of the American South|publisher=University of North Carolina|accessdate=|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = http://wayback.archive-it.org/org-679/20151013174153/http://www2.lib.unc.edu/stories/cotton/about/mills4.html|archivedate= 13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws were rarely enforced, and the presence of small children in the factory was explained away to the inspectors saying they were visiting the mill to bring meals to their parents (meal totters), or helping but not on the payroll (helpers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/stories/cotton/about/workers2.html|title=Child Labor in the Cotton Mills – The Story: The Workers |website = Stories of the American South |publisher = University of North Carolina|accessdate=|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = http://wayback.archive-it.org/org-679/20151013174154/http://www2.lib.unc.edu/stories/cotton/about/workers2.html|archivedate = 13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wages were good for the workers who could earn $2 a day in the mill against $0.75 on a farm. In the segregated south, 'Blacks' were not allowed to work inside a mill; had they been the need for child labour would have been eliminated.{{sfn|Hindman|2002|p=181}} Child labour stopped here not only because of new laws but the change in the type of machinery caused by the Great Depression, which required greater height and skill.{{sfn|Hindman|2002|p=183}}

===Women===
In 1926 when it was at its peak, the Lancashire cotton industry worked 57.3 million spindles and 767,500 looms. It imported 3.3 million bales and exported 80% of its production. 61% of the 575,000 cotton operatives in Lancashire were women, of which 61% were unionised in 167 different [[Trade union|unions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unions===
The 18th-century woollen industry of small producers in southern England was far different from the Yorkshire-based [[worsted]] industry where the clothier imported and owned the raw material and sold the cloth. He put out work to small weavers, in effect, employing them. Worsted was more capital intensive. The small weavers banded together to form self-help guilds. When Lancashire adopted cotton, the same process occurred. But in Lancashire cotton mills, spinning became a male occupation, and the tradition of [[Trade union|unions]] passed into the factory. As spinners were 'assisted' by several 'piecers' there was a pool of trained labour to replace any spinner the owner cared to dismiss. The well paid mule spinners were the 'barefoot aristocrats' of labour and became organised in the 19th century. They paid union dues, and were well placed to finance themselves should a strike be needed. The Yorkshire worsted industry, adopted the [[Ring spinning|ring frame]] which required less skill. Worsted spinning was an occupation for young girls. Unionism did not develop in Yorkshire until 1914. In, 1913 figures show 50% of cotton operatives were unionised while only 10% of wool and worsted workers.

In Lancashire there were:

|Cardroom Operatives||55,000
|-
|Spinners||23,000

|}
The spinners union, the [[Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners]] had a federal structure with strong central leadership where control was in the hands of a small group of paid officials. Their dues were high, so the fighting fund was large and the officials were skilled in defending the complex wage structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fowler|first=Alan|year=2004|title=British Textile Workers in the Lancashire Cotton and Yorkshire Wool industries|journal=National Overview Great Britain, Textile Conference HSH|url=http://www.iisg.nl/research/britain.doc |accessdate=|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health of the workers==
A cotton mill was not a healthy place to work. The air in the mill had to be hot and humid to prevent the thread from breaking: 18&amp;nbsp;°C to 26&amp;nbsp;°C and 85% humidity was normal. The air in the mill was thick with cotton dust, which could lead to [[byssinosis]] – a lung disease.

Protective masks were introduced after the war, but few workers wore them as they made them uncomfortable in the stifling conditions. The same applied to ear protectors. The air led to skin infections, eye infections, [[bronchitus]] and [[tuberculosis]]. The noise levels in a weaving shop, where the shuttles in 500 plus looms were being thumped 200 times a minute led to levels of deafness in all who worked there. The lubrication was [[carcinogenic]] and led to cancers of the mouth and cancer of the [[scrotum]]; known as mule-spinners cancer.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nationonfilm/topics/textiles/background_conditions.shtm |title= A Factory Worker's Lot – Conditions in the Mill|publisher=[[BBC Television]]|accessdate=2009-05-13 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206043404/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nationonfilm/topics/textiles/background_conditions.shtml | archivedate= 2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mill worker could expect to work a thirteen-hour day, six days a week with two weeks off for the [[wakes week]] holidays in summer. Unsurprisingly, a series of [[Factory Act]]s were passed to attempt to ameliorate these conditions.

In the early days when the cotton towns were expanding rapidly, living conditions for the workers were poor. Badly planned housing was seriously overcrowded. Open sewers and shared privies led to diseases such as [[cholera]]; Manchester was hit by an [[Second cholera pandemic (1829–51)|epidemic in 1831]] that claimed hundreds of lives.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

*Fictional accounts of the early days of factories and the events of the Industrial Revolution are portrayed in ''The Maiden'', ''The Flood Tide'', ''The Tangled Thread'', ''The Emperor'', ''The Victory'', ''The Regency'', ''The Reckoning'' and ''The Devil's Horse'', Volumes 8–13, 15 and 16 of [[The Morland Dynasty]], a series of historical novels by author Cynthia Harrod-Eagles. The difficulties of getting cottage workers to accept the regimented and unwholesome life in factories as opposed to the relative freedom and flexibility of home-working is demonstrated in the earlier volumes mentioned as well as the concerns of some of the more philanthropically minded characters regarding the living and working conditions of the workers. The later volumes demonstrate that plans to improve the lot of factory hands, and the poor generally, were not welcomed by everybody – even by some essentially well-meaning people.--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3832">'''Cú Choigcríche Ó Cléirigh''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1624–1664) was an Irish historian and genealogist, known in [[English language|English]] as '''Peregrine O'Clery'''.

==Life and work==
Ó Cléirigh was a son of Diarmaid Ó Cléirigh, and thus a third-cousin once removed to Brother [[Mícheál Ó Cléirigh]], whom he assisted in compiling the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]''.

However, Paul Walsh believed him to be a son of Diarmad mac An Chosnamghaigh mac Concoigríche mac Diarmada Ó Cléirigh, who died in 1552. This Diarmaid was a brother of Tuthal (died 1512) and Giolla Riabhach (died 1527). [[Mícheál Ó Cléirigh]] was the son of Donnchaidh, a son of Uilliam son of Tuathail Ó Cléirigh, who died in 1512. The first modern-day editor of the annals, [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]], believed that Ó Cléirigh was the son of the poet and historian [[Lughaidh Ó Cléirigh]], although this has since been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=20496|title=Ó Cléirigh, Cú Choigcríche|year=2004|last=O Muraile|first=Nollaig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Brother Mícheál, Ó Cléirigh transcribed the years 1332-1608 in the annals. The earliest copy of Lughaidh Ó Cléirigh's life of [[Red Hugh O'Donnell|Aodh Ruadh Ó Domhnaill]] is in his handwriting. He also wrote a poem on Mary, sister of [[Red Hugh O'Donnell]], who died in 1662, which is now among the Phillips Manuscripts at the [[National Library of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillips MS 23068 (NLI G 167)&lt;/ref&gt;

He seems to have given material to [[Dubhaltach MacFhirbhisigh]], which the latter inserted on page 299 of [[Leabhar na nGenealach]]

His own principal work is the compilation known as the [[O'Clery Book of Genealogies]].

He died at Gortnaheltia, in the valley of Glenhest at the foot of [[Nephin Beg]], overlooking Lough Beltra. He bequeathed his books to his sons Diarmaid and Seaán.

It is believed that Cú Choigcríche's descendants are the Cleary and Clarke families of Brackleagh, Glenhest, [[Burrishoole]], [[County Mayo]].

'''Deglobalization''' or '''Deglobalisation''' is the process of diminishing interdependence and integration between certain units around the world, typically nation-states. It is widely used to describe the periods of history when economic trade and investment between countries decline. It stands in contrast to [[globalization]], in which units become increasingly integrated over time, and generally spans the time between periods of globalization. While globalization and deglobalisation are antitheses, they are no mirror images

The term of deglobalization has derived from some of the very profound change in many developed nations, where trade as a proportion of total economic activity until the 1970s was below previous peak levels in the early 1910s. This decline reflects that their economies become less integrated with the rest of the world economies in spite of the deepening scope of [[economic globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=New York University Department of Sociology|title=The Sociology Project|year=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0-205-09382-3 |page=569}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the  global level only two longer periods of deglobalization occurred, namely in the 1930s during the Great Depression and 2010s, when following the [[Great Trade Collapse]] the period of the World Trade Slowdown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoekman|first1=Bernhard|title=The Global Trade Slowdown: A New Normal?|date=2015|publisher=CEPR VOXEU|location=Florence ; European University Institute, 2015|url=https://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/file/Global%20Trade%20Slowdown_nocover.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; set in.

The occurrence of deglobalization has strong proponents who have claimed the death of globalisation, but is also contested by leading academics such as Michael Bordo &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bordo |first1=Michael |title=The Second Era of Globalization is Not Yet Over: An Historical Perspective |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 23786 |date=September 2017 |doi=10.3386/w23786 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who argues that it is too soon to give a good diagnosis and Mervyn Martin &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Mervyn|title=Keeping it Real: Debunking the Deglobalization Myth, Brexit, and Trump:-"Lessons" on Integration' ;|journal=Journal of International Trade Law and Policy|volume=17|pages=62–68|date=2018|doi=10.1108/JITLP-06-2017-0020|url=https://tees.openrepository.com/tees/handle/10149/621562|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; who argues that US and UK policies are rational answers to essential temporary problems of even strong nations

While as with globalization, deglobalization can refer to economic, trade, social, technological, cultural and political dimensions, much of the work that has been conducted in the study of deglobalization refers to the field of [[international economics]].

== 1930s versus 2010s ==

Periods of deglobalization have mainly been seen as interesting comparators to other periods, such as 1850–1914 and 1950–2007, in which globalization had been the norm, given that globalization is the norm for most people and because the interpretation of the global economy has mainly been framed as inevitably increasing integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livesey|first1=Finbarr.|title=Unpacking the possibilities of deglobalisation|journal=Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society|date=2018|volume=11|issue=1|pages=177–187|doi=10.1093/cjres/rsx030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, even periods of stagnant international interaction are often wrongly seen as periods of deglobalization. Recently scientists, have started to also compare the major periods of deglobalization in order to better understand drivers and consequences of this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O’Rourke|first1=Kevin Hjortshøj|title=Two Great Trade Collapses: The Interwar Period and Great Recession Compared.|journal=IMF Economic Review|volume=66|issue=3|pages=418–439|date=2018|doi=10.1057/s41308-017-0046-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Bergeijk|first1=Peter A.G.|title=On the brink of Deglobalisation ... again|journal=Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society|date=2018|volume=11|issue=2|pages=59–72|doi=10.1093/cjres/rsx023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two major phases of deglobalisation are not identical twins.The two phases of deglobalisation were equally triggered by a demand shock in the wake of a financial crisis. Both in the 1930s and in the 2000s the composition of trade was a second key determinant: manufacturing trade bore the brunt of the contraction. One important finding is that country experiences both during the Great Depression and Great Recession are very heterogeneous so that one-size-fits-all policies to counter negative impacts of deglobalization are inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bergeijk, Peter AG|author2=Steven Brakman|author3=Charles Marrewijk|title=Heterogeneous economic resilience and the great recession's world trade collapse.|journal=Papers in Regional Science|date=2017|volume=96|issue=1|pages=3–12|doi=10.1111/pirs.12279}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, democracies supported free trade, and deglobalisation was driven by autocratic decisions to strengthen self-sufficiency. In the 2010s, political institutions are just as significant, but now democratic decisions such as the election of President Trump with an America First agenda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Simon J. Evenett|author2=Johannes Fritz|title=Will Awe Trump Rules?|url=http://www.globaltradealert.org/reports/42|publisher=global trade alert|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brexit drive the deglobalisation process worldwide. Indeed, while the industrialised countries in the 2010s avoided the pitfalls of protectionism and deflation, they have experienced different political dynamics.

== Measures of deglobalization ==

As with globalization, economic deglobalization can be measured in different ways. These centre around the four main economic flows:
* Goods and services, e.g. exports plus imports as a proportion of [[national income]] or per head of population.
* Labour/people, e.g. net [[Human migration|migration rate]]s; inward or outward migration flows, weighted by population (and resultant remittances in per cent of GDP)
* Capital, e.g. inward or outward direct investment as a proportion of national income or per head of population
It is generally not thought possible to measure deglobalization through lack of flows of technology, the fourth main flow. 
Those areas that are measurable do suggest other possible measures, including:
* Average tariffs
* Border restrictions on labour
* [[Capital controls]], including restrictions on foreign direct investment or outward direct investment

The multi-dimensional globalization index of KOF Swiss Economic Institute shows a clear break for economic globalization in 2009 in 2015 KOF observed for its overall index: "The level of globalisation worldwide increased rapidly between 1990 and 2007 and has risen only slightly since the Great Recession. In 2015, globalisation decreased for the first time since 1975. The fall was due to the decline in economic globalisation, with social globalisation stagnating and political globalisation increasing slightly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=KOF|title=press-release/2018/01/kof-globalisation-index-globalisation-down-worldwide-in-2015|url=https://www.kof.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/media/press-releases/2018/01/kof-globalisation-index-globalisation-down-worldwide-in-2015.html|website=www.kof.ethz.ch|publisher=KOF|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other indicators of deglobalization include the development of Foreign Direct Investment, that according to UNCTAD slipped further in 2017 and in stark contrast with production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=UNCTAD|title=Global Investment Trends Monitor|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/diaeia2018d1_en.pdf|website=unctad.org|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risks of deglobalization==
Typically a reduction of the level of international integration of economies (and the world economy at large) are expected to exert second round effects related to four feedback mechanisms:&lt;ref name="brink"&gt;Peter A.G. van Bergeijk, [http://deglobalization.blogspot.nl/ ''On the brink of Deglobalization'',] (Edward Elgar, 2010), {{ISBN|9781849804110}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*a reduction of (the rate of growth) of international trade will feed negatively into long-run growth
*a loss of interaction, the co-movement of economies,
*[[trade policy]] feedbacks in the sense that reduced international interaction and lower growth will stimulate [[protectionism]] and non-economic issue areas where reduced cooperation among countries and even an increasing risk of international conflict can be expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murshed|first1=s. mansoob|title=Challenges to the liberal peace|url=https://issblog.nl/2018/04/03/deglobalisation-series-challenges-to-the-liberal-peace-by-syed-mansoob-murshed/|website=BLISS|accessdate=3 April 2018|date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== (International) political economy of deglobalization ==
Deglobalization has also been used as a political agenda item or a term in framing the debate on a new [[World economic order]], for example by [[Walden Bello]] in his 2005 book ''Deglobalization''.&lt;ref name="bello"&gt;Walden Bello, [http://us.macmillan.com/BookCustomPage.aspx?isbn=1842775456&amp;m_type=7 ''Deglobalization: Ideas for a New World Economy'',] (Zed books, 2005). {{ISBN|9781842775455}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the prominent examples of deglobalization movement could be found in the United States of America, where the Bush and Obama administration instituted [[Buy American Act]] clause as party of massive stimulus package, which was designed to favor American-made goods over traded goods. Likewise, the EU has imposed new subsidies to protect their agricultural sectors for their own protection. These movements of deglobalization can be seen as the example of how developed nations react to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]] through deglobalization movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Office of the Law Revision Counsel |url=http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t41t42+22+1++(41)%20%20AND%2 |publisher=US House of Representatives |accessdate=2013-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806135758/http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t41t42+22+1++%2841%29%20%20AND%252 |archivedate=August 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Recently a change in the pattern of anti-globalism has been observed: anti-globalism now has a strong foothold in the Global North and among right-wing (conservative) politicians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Rory Horner|author2=Daniel Haberly|author3=Seth Schindler|author4=Yuko Aoyama|title=How anti-globalisation switched from a left to a right-wing issue – and where it will go next|url=https://theconversation.com/how-anti-globalisation-switched-from-a-left-to-a-right-wing-issue-and-where-it-will-go-next-90587|website=The conversation|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with much different attitudes in the Global South, particular among the BRICS countries.

The '''Delphin Classics''' was an edition of the [[Latin]] classics, intended to be comprehensive, which was originally created in the 17th century.

The 25 volumes were created in the 1670s for [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1661-1711)|Louis, ''le Grand Dauphin'']], heir of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] (''Delphin'' is the adjective derived from ''dauphin''), and were written in Latin. Thirty-nine scholars contributed to the series, which was edited by [[Pierre Daniel Huet|Pierre Huet]] with assistance from several co-editors, including [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet]] and [[Anne Lefèvre|Anne Dacier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Nuttall|title=Delphin Classics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each work was accompanied by a Latin commentary, ''ordo verborum'', and verbal index. The editors added many notes and appendixes.

The original volumes each had an engraving of [[Arion]] and the Dolphin, accompanied by the inscription ''in usum serenissimi Delphini'' (for the use of the most serene Dauphin).

Beginning in 1819 a series of Latin classics was published in England under the name Delphin Classics by [[Abraham John Valpy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishinghistory.com/delphin-classics-valpy.html Delphin Classics (A. J. Valpy) - Book Series List], publishinghistory.com. Retrieved on 1 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This series was edited by [[George Dyer (poet)]], who produced 143 volumes. They are no longer current.

There is a reference to them in Part I, Chapter 5 of [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''[[Jude the Obscure]]'', where young Jude, trying to educate himself by reading while delivering bread from a horse and cart, "plunge[s] into the simpler passages from [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], [[Virgil]], or [[Horace]] [. . .] The only copies he had been able to lay hands on were old Delphin editions, because they were superseded, and therefore cheap. But, bad for idle school-boys, it did so happen that they were passably good for him."&lt;ref&gt;[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/hardy/thomas/h27j/p1.5.html ''Jude the Obscure'' by Thomas Hardy, Part 1, Chapter 5], adelaide.edu.au.

'''Diocletian windows''', also called '''thermal windows''', are large semicircular windows characteristic of the enormous [[public bath]]s (''[[thermae]]'') of [[Ancient Rome]]. They have been revived on a limited basis by some [[neo-classical architecture|classical revivalist architects]] in more modern times.

==Description==
Diocletian windows are large segmental arched [[window]]s (or other openings) which are usually divided into three lights (window compartments) by two vertical [[mullion]]s. The central compartment is often wider than the two side lights on either side of it.&lt;ref name=pevsner1&gt;{{cite book|title=Pevsner's Architectural Glossary|year=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-16721-4|editor=Bradley, Simon|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Names ==
Diocletian windows are named after the windows found in the [[Baths of Diocletian|Thermae (Baths) of Diocletian]] (AD 302) in [[Rome]]. (The Thermae is now the church of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri]].) The variant name, thermal window, also comes from their association with the Thermae of Diocletian.

== Influence ==
[[File:Penn Station3.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;A five-light variant of the thermal window is seen on the old [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] in New York City (''circa'' 1911).]]

This type of window was revived and used in Italy in the 16th century, especially by [[Andrea Palladio]]. Palladio and others incorporated an elongated Diocletian window in the form of an arched central light flanked by narrower, square-headed apertures. This combination became known as a [[Palladian architecture#The Palladian window|Palladian, or Venetian, window]].

The Diocletian window was much used in the early 18th century by the English architect [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Richard Boyle]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/164082/Diocletian-window www.britannica.com- Diocletian Window]&lt;/ref&gt; 3rd [[Earl of Burlington]], one of the originators of the [[Palladian architecture#English Palladian revival (neo-Palladian)|English Palladian style]], and by his followers.

Diocletian windows continued to be used occasionally in large public buildings in the various devolutions of [[neoclassical architecture]] including the [[Beaux Arts architecture|Beaux Arts movement]] (1880–1920).

'''Dionysius of Halicarnassus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Διονύσιος Ἀλεξάνδρου Ἁλικαρνασσεύς}}, {{grc-transl|Διονύσιος Ἀλεξάνδρου Ἁλικαρνασσεύς}}, "Dionysios son of Alexandros of Halikarnassos"; c. 60 BC{{snd}}after 7 BC) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] historian and teacher of [[rhetoric]], who flourished during the reign of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]]. His literary style was [[Atticism|Atticistic]] — imitating [[Classical language|Classical]] [[Attic Greek]] in its prime.

Dionysius' opinion of the necessity of a promotion of [[paideia]] within education, from true knowledge of [[Ancient Greek literature#Classical and pre-classical antiquity|Classical sources]], endured for centuries in a form integral to the identity of the Greek elite.&lt;ref name="T. Hidber"/&gt;

==Life==
He was a [[Halicarnassus|Halicarnassian]].&lt;ref name="T. Hidber"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_TzjAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA229&amp;dq=Dionysius+of+Halicarnissus+5th+book#v=onepage&amp;q=Dionysius%20of%20Halicarnissus%205th%20book&amp;f=false|author=T.

During this period, he gave lessons in [[rhetoric]], and enjoyed the society of many distinguished men. The date of his death is unknown.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Dionysius Halicarnassensis |volume=8 |pages=285–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, it was commonly supposed that he was the ancestor of [[Aelius Dionysius|Aelius Dionysius of Halicarnassus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Works==
His major work, entitled {{lang|grc|Ῥωμαϊκὴ Ἀρχαιολογία}} ({{grc-transl|Ῥωμαϊκὴ Ἀρχαιολογία}}, Roman Antiquities), embraced the history of Rome from the mythical period to the beginning of the [[First Punic War]]. It was divided into twenty books, of which the first nine remain entire, the tenth and eleventh are nearly complete, and the remaining books exist in fragments in the excerpts of the Roman emperor [[Constantine VII|Constantine Porphyrogenitus]] and an epitome discovered by [[Angelo Mai]] in a [[Milan]] manuscript. The first three books of [[Appian]], [[Plutarch]]'s ''Life of Camillus'' and ''Life of Coriolanus'' also embody much of Dionysius.{{Citation needed|reason=little of Dionysius' Camillus narrative survives|date=April 2017}}

His chief object was to reconcile the Greeks to the rule of [[Roman Republic|Rome]], by dilating upon the good qualities of their conquerors and also by arguing, using more ancient sources, that the Romans were genuine descendants of the older Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/1B*.html|title=The Roman Antiquities (Loeb Classical Library edition, 1937), Book 1, 11|last=Dionysius of Halicarnassus|publisher=Penelope, University of Chicago|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Gabba, ''Dionysius and the History of Archaic Rome ''(Berkeley 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, history is philosophy teaching by examples, and this idea he has carried out from the point of view of a Greek rhetorician. But he carefully consulted the best authorities, and his work and that of [[Livy]] are the only connected and detailed extant accounts of early Roman history.

Dionysius was also the author of several rhetorical treatises, in which he shows that he has thoroughly studied the best Attic models:
* ''The Art of Rhetoric'' ({{lang|grc|Τέχνη ῥητορική}} {{grc-transl|Τέχνη ῥητορική}}), which is rather a collection of essays on the theory of rhetoric, incomplete, and certainly not all his work;
* ''The Arrangement of Words'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ συνθέσεως ὀνομάτων}} {{grc-transl|Περὶ συνθέσεως ὀνομάτων}}, ''De compositione verborum''), treating of the combination of words according to the different styles of oratory;
* ''[[Dionysian imitatio|On Imitation]]'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ μιμήσεως}} {{grc-transl|Περὶ μιμήσεως}}), on the best models in the different kinds of literature and the way in which they are to be imitated—a fragmentary work;
* ''Commentaries on the Attic Orators'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ τῶν Ἀττικῶν ῥητόρων}} {{grc-transl|Περὶ τῶν Ἀττικῶν ῥητόρων}}), which, however, only deal with [[Lysias]], [[Isaeus]], [[Isocrates]] and (by way of supplement) [[Dinarchus]];
* ''On the Admirable Style of [[Demosthenes]]'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ λεκτικῆς Δημοσθένους δεινότητος}} {{grc-transl|Περὶ λεκτικῆς Δημοσθένους δεινότητος}}); and
* ''On the Character of Thucydides'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ Θουκιδίδου χαρακτῆρος}} {{grc-transl|Περὶ Θουκιδίδου χαρακτῆρος}}).

The last two treatises are supplemented by letters to [[Pompey|Gn. Pompeius]] and [[Ammaeus]] (two, one of which is about Thucydides).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===Dionysian ''imitatio''===
{{main article|Dionysian imitatio}}
''Dionysian imitatio'' is the [[literary method]] of imitation as formulated by Dionysius, who conceived it as the [[rhetoric]]al practice of emulating, adapting, reworking, and enriching a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"&gt;Ruthven (1979) pp. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dionysius' concept marked a significant departure from the concept of ''[[mimesis]]'' formulated by [[Aristotle]] in the 4th century BC, which was only concerned with "imitation of nature" and not "imitation of other authors."&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted Dionysius' method of ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;

==Foundation myth==

Dionysius is one of the primary sources for the accounts of the Roman foundation myth and the myth of [[Romulus and Remus]].  He was heavily relied upon for the later publications of [[Livy]] and [[Plutarch]]{{Citation needed|reason=Livy's first pentad predates Dionysius|date=April 2017}}.  He writes extensively on the myth, sometimes attributing direct quotations to its figures.  The myth spans the first 2 volumes of his ''Roman Antiquities'', beginning with Book I chapter 73 and concluding in Book II chapter 56. 
{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Romulus and Remus===

====Origins and survival in the wild====
Dionysius claims that the twins were born to a [[Vestal virgins|vestal]] named [[Rea Silvia|Ilia Silvia]] (sometimes called Rea).  Her family descends from [[Aeneas]] of Troy and the daughter of [[Latinus|King Latinus]] of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Original Latin tribes]].  [[Procas]], her grandfather had willed the throne to his son [[Numitor]] but he was later deposed by her uncle, [[Amulius]].  For fear of the threat that Numitor's heirs might pose, the king had Ilia's brother, Aegestus killed and blamed robbers.  The truth about the crime was known by some, including Numitor, who feigned ignorance.  Amulius then appointed Ilia to the [[Vestal virgins|Vestal priestesshood]], where her vow of chastity would prevent her from producing any further male rivals.  Despite this, she became pregnant a few years later, claiming to have been raped.

The different accounts of the twins' conception are laid out, but Dionysius declines to choose one over the others.  The sources variously relate that it was a suitor, Amulius himself (in full armor to conceal his identity), or even the god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] himself.  The latter is supposed to have comforted Ilia by making her grieve, and telling her that she would bear twins whose bravery and triumphs would be unmatched.  Ilia hid her pregnancy with claims of illness so as to avoid her vestal duties.  Amulius suspected her and employed physicians and his wife to monitor her for signs of being with child.  When he did discover the truth, she was placed under armed guard.  After being informed of the delivery of the twins, Amulius suspected that she had in fact given birth to triplets.  The third child had been concealed from the guards present.  Ilia was either put to death, or kept secretly in a hidden dungeon for the rest of her life.

Citing [[Fabius]], [[Lucius Cincius Alimentus|Cincius]], [[Cato the Elder|Porcius Cato]], and [[Piso]], Dionysius recounts the most common tale.  The king orders the twins to be tossed into the Tiber.  When his servants arrived at the riverbank, high waters had made it impossible to reach the stream.  They left the twin's basket in a pool of standing water on the site of the [[ficus Ruminalis]].  After the waters of the Tiber had carried the twins away, their basket is overturned by a rock and they are dumped into the mud.  A she-wolf finds them there and [[Breastfeeding|nurses]] them in front of her lair (the ''[[Lupercal]]'').  Plutarch places the [[Lupercal]] as at the foot of Palantine hill along the road to the [[Circus Maximus|Roman chariot grounds]] and was the source of a [[Spring (hydrology)|natural spring]].

====Youth====
The twins were discovered by unnamed herdsmen, and when they arrive, the she-wolf calmly retreats into the cave.  [[Faustulus]], the man in charge of the royal [[abattoir]], happened upon the scene.  He had heard the story of Ilia's twin birth and the king's order, but never let on that he suspected the [[Child abandonment|foundlings]] were one and the same.  He persuaded the shepherds to allow him to take the boys home, and brought them to his wife, who had just delivered a [[stillbirth|stillborn]] child.  Later, quoting Fabius' account of the overthrow of Amulius, Dionysius claims that Faustulus had saved the basket in which the boys had been abandoned. {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

As they grew, the boys exhibited the graces and behavior of the royal-born.  They passed their days living as herdsmen in the mountains, spending many nights in huts of reeds and sticks.

orphan footnote.&lt;ref&gt;In his account of the conflict with Amulius, Livy claims that Faustulus, had always known that the boys had been abandoned by the order of the king and had hoped that they are of Royal blood, ''Histories'' I.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Dionysius relates an alternate, "non-fantastical" version of Romulus and Remus' birth, survival and youth.  In this version, Numitor managed to switch the twins at birth with two other infants.  The twins were delivered by their grandfather to Faustulus to be fostered by him and his wife.  Faustulus was descended from the [[Arcadia (ancient region)|first Greek]] colonists in [[Latium]].  He was the caretaker for Amulius' holdings around Palatine hill.  He was persuaded to care for the twins by his brother [[Faustinus]], who tended the kings herds on nearby Aventine hill.

Their adopted mother was Faustulus' wife [[Laurentia]], a former [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitute]].  According to Plutarch, ''lupa''(Latin for "wolf") was a common term for members of her profession and this gave rise to the she-wolf legend.  The twins receive a proper [[Education in ancient Rome|education]] in the city of [[Gabii]].

====Overthrow of Amulius====
According to Fabius, when the twins were 18, they became embroiled in a violent disputes with some of Numitor's herdsmen.  In retaliation, Remus was lured into an ambush and capture while Romulus was elsewhere.  In [[Quintus Aelius Tubero|Aelius Tubero's]] version, the twins were taking part in the festivities of the [[Lupercalia]], requiring them to run naked through the village when Remus, defenseless as he was, was taken prisoner by Numitor's armed men.

After rounding up the toughest herdsmen to help him free Remus, Romulus rashly set out for Alba Longa.  To avoid tragedy, Faustulus intercepted him and revealed the truth about the twins' parentage.  With the discovery that Numitor was family, Romulus sets his sights on Amulius, instead.  He and the rest of his village set out in small groups toward the city so that their arrival will go unnoticed by the guards.  Meanwhile, after being turned over to Numitor to determine his punishment, Remus was told of his origins by the former king and eagerly joins with him in their own effort to topple Amulius.  When Romulus joined them at Numitor's home, the three of them began to plan their next move.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Back home, Faustulus had begun to worry about how the twins' claims will be heard in Alba.  He decides to bolster them by bringing the basket in which they were abandoned to the city.  He's stopped by suspicious guards at the gates and he and the basket are seen by none-other-than the servant who had taken them to the river those many years before.  Under the questioning of the king, and after the king's insincere offers of benevolence toward his nephews, Faustulus, trying to protect Romulus and Remus, and escape the king's clutches, claimed he had been bringing the basket to the imprisoned Ilia at the twins request and that they were at the moment tending their flocks in the mountains.

Amulius sent Faustulus and his men to find the boys.  He then tried to trick Numitor into coming to the palace so that the former king could be kept under guard until the situation had been dealt with.  Unfortunately for the king, the man he sent to lure Numitor into his clutches instead revealed everything that had happened at the palace.

The twins and their grandfather led their joint supporters to the palace, killed Amulius, and took control of the city.

Plutarch continues the same alternate version of the twins' parentage and youth.  After the boys had returned home from their studies in Gabii, Numitor has the twins attack his own herdsmen and drive off his own cattle to contrive a complaint against his  brother.  To placate him, Amulius ordered not only the twins to be brought to the palace for trial, but all the others who were present, as well.  This is exactly what Numitor had hoped for.  When Romulus and Remus arrived in Alba, their grandfather revealed their true identity and he, the twins and the other herdsmen joined forces to attack Amulius, apparently killing him.

====Death of Remus====
The now re-installed King Numitor granted Romulus and Remus control over the area around where Rome would be founded, and sent some of Alba Longa's commoners and nobles along with them.  These included volunteers as well as his enemies, and other troublemakers and fifty families of the descendants of [[Aeneas|the Greeks]] who had settled in [[Old Latium|Italy]] after the [[Trojan War]]. The commoners were given provisions, weapons, slaves and livestock.

Wanting to use competition to better complete the many tasks ahead of them, each twin took command of half of the new group of colonists and natives.  Instead, the two groups each wanted their twin to be king.  Eventually, both Romulus and Remus began to harbor their own ambitions of being the sole ruler of the new city.  Things came to a head when a dispute broke out over the particular hill upon which Rome should be built.  Romulus wanted to build on [[Palatine Hill]] for its significance to their childhood.  Remus chose [[Aventine Hill]] for its strategic advantages.  Finally, with no resolution in site, they took the matter to Numitor.  He told each twin to stake out a spot on an appointed morning at dawn and wait for a "[[Augury|bird omen]]" from the gods to settle things.

They took his suggestion and the two brothers took their positions along with guard to prevent cheating.  No birds appeared to Romulus, but he tried to trick Remus by sending a message that he should come to him right away.  Ashamed, the messengers took their time, and while en route, Remus saw 6 vultures.  The messengers brought Remus back to his brother and when they arrived, Romulus was asked what type of bird he had seen (apparently owing to the ruse).  Unsure, Romulus was suddenly saved by the sudden arrival of 12 vultures.  He dismissed his brother's query and declared himself the winner.  Furious Remus refused to accept defeat.  This reignited the conflict between them.

Outwardly, each twin acknowledged the other's claim to having won: Remus by seeing the vultures first, and Romulus by seeing more of them.  Privately, however, neither was willing to give in.  An armed battle broke out between their followers resulting in deaths among both.  Faustulus was so distraught over his inability to end the strife between his adopted sons that he threw himself into the middle of the fighting and was killed.  Remus also fell.  Romulus was devastated at his personal losses as well as the many suffered by the twins' followers.  Only after the intervention of Laurentia was he able to return to the job of founding the city.

Other sources who are unnamed by Plutarch claimed that despite his anger over Romulus' conduct during the contest of the augury, Remus conceded and the construction of the city began on Palatine Hill.  Out of resentment, he derided the city's newly-built walls and demonstrated their ineffectiveness by leaping over them, saying that an enemy of Romulus could do the same.  In response, [[Celer (builder)|Celer]], the job's foreman, killed him on the spot with a blow to the head and implied that Remus himself had become his brother's enemy.

===Foundation of Rome by Romulus===
Before construction on the city began [[Romulus]] made sacrifices and received good omens, and he then ordered the populace to ritually atone for their guilt. The city's fortifications were first and then housing for the populace.  He assembles the people and gives them the choice as to what type of government they want.  After his address, which extols Bravery in war abroad, and moderation at home, and in which Romulus denies any need to remain in power, the people decide to remain a kingdom and ask him to remain its king.  Before accepting he looks for a sign of the approval of the gods.  He prays, and witnesses an auspicious lightning bolt, after which he declares that no king shall take the throne without receiving approval from the gods.

====Institutions====
He divides Rome into 3 [[Roman tribe|tribes]], each selected a [[Tribune]] in charge of each.  Each tribe was divided into 10 [[Curia]], and each of those into smaller units.  He divided the kingdoms land holdings between them.  Plutarch suggests that [[Classical Athens|Athenian institutions]] were the inspiration for Romulus' creation of the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]] class from the wealthy and virtuous.  All other Romans formed the [[Pleb]]eian class.  The Patricians were put in charge of religious, legal and civil institutions, while the Plebs were to be farmers, herders and 
tradesmen.  Each curiae was responsible for provided soldiers in the event of war.

To maintain order, every pleb had the right to choose a Patrician in a system of [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patronage]] (''clientela'').  All patrons (''patronus'') were required to protect the rights and interests of those plebs (''cliens'') beneath them.  In return all plebs were required to support his patron in his endeavors and assist him when needed.  It was illegal for either party to testify against one another or otherwise act against the interests of the other.  Romulus then proceeded to establish the [[Roman senate|senate]].  Another act that Dionysius attributes to Greek influence.  He selected 300 of the strongest and fittest among the nobles to become his personal bodyguard and messengers.  The ''celeres'' were so-named either for their quickness, or, according to [[Valerius Antias]], for their commander.  These were the first [[Roman cavalry]] and were instrument in many Roman victories.

Romulus then delimited the [[Separation of power|various powers]] of the institutions he had created.  The Roman king was made the ultimate authority in all religious and legal matters.  He would personally hear the cases of "the greatest crimes" but after reaching a decision, his opinion would be subject to approval by the people.  He would be the commander in chief of the military in wartime.

The senate would have the power to decide any matter or issue brought to them by the king with a binding vote (attributed by Dionysius to the [[Lacedaemonians]].  The popular assemblies had the power to elect magistrates, pass laws and declare war at the king's discretion.

Romulus passed laws meant to encourage child-rearing.  He welcomed free men of any background to settle in the new city with promises of citizenship and an offer of [[Right of asylum|protection]] from those from home who might be pursuing them.  Immigrants flocked to Rome as a result.  Rome would also benefit from their practice of sending colonists to newly conquered cities and allowing the subjugated to carry on as they had before.  More common in the Greek world was to treat those they defeated harshly.  Rome grew 10 times during Romulus' reign.

In an extensive exploration of the various, lurid traditions of the day, Dionysius effusively praises the manner in which Romulus' organized and established Rome's religious customs and practices.  He attributes to the king everything from the founding of temples, to defining the sphere of individual gods, their festivals and the blessings they would each bestow.  Among the Greek and native traditions, he kept only those he deemed worthy and rejected any that were too unseemly or otherwise unfit for Roman society.

According to [[Terentius Varro]], Romulus appointed a large number of Roman men and women to religious office during his reign.  He also allowed the various curia to select their own.  He adopted the Greek practice of appointing children to participate in the city's ceremonies.  He established an office of augury, who would ensure the approval of the gods during all worship undertaken.  Each curia was required to sacrifice and give offerings in a way so specified.  He established budgets for religious practice in the city.

====Legal system====
[[File:Bernard van Orley - Romulus Gives Laws to the Roman People - WGA16696.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Bernard van Orley - Romulus Gives Laws to the Roman People - WGA16696]]
Again, Dionysius thoroughly describes the laws of other nations before contrasting the approach of Romulus and lauding his work.  The Roman law governing marriage is, according to his ''Antiquities'' an elegant yet simple improvement over that of other nations, most of which he harshly derides.  By declaring that wives would share equally in the possessions and conduct of their husband, Romulus promoted virtue in the former and deterred mistreatment by the latter.  Wives could inherit upon their husband's birth.  A wife's adultery was a serious crime, however, drunkenness could be a mitigating factor in determining the appropriate punishment.  Because of his laws, Dionysius claims, not a single Roman couple divorced for the next 5 centuries.  His laws governing parental rights, in particular those that allow fathers to maintain power over their adult children were an improvement over those of others.

Under the laws of Romulus, native-born free Roman's were limited to two forms of employment: farming and the army.  All other occupations were filled by slaves or non-Roman labor.

Romulus used the trappings of his office, to encourage compliance with the law.  His court was imposing and filled with loyal soldiers and he was always accompanied by the [[lictor|12 lictors]] appointed to be his attendants.

====Rape of the Sabine women====
{{Further information|Battle of the Lacus Curtius}}
According to [[Gnaeus Gellius]], in Romulus' fourth year in power, the recently founded city of Rome, its population swollen with immigrants found itself surrounded by unfriendly neighbors and short of marriageable women.  Romulus sought to solve both problems through intermarrying with the other cities in the region, but he was rebuffed.  His solution having been approved by his grandfather, received the auspices of the gods, and the support of the senate began with the announcement of a spectacular festival and competitions to honor the god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], and to which all of Rome's neighbors were welcome.  They came from far and wide, sometimes entire families, to attend and participate.

On the king's signal, Romans began [[Bride kidnapping|abducting]] the young women in attendance much to the shock and horror of their guests. Later, the women are brought before him where he assures them that he and the other men of Rome intend to honorably marry them and that they won't be sexually exploited in any way. This eases their fears.

The cities of  [[Caenina]], [[Crustumerium]], and [[Antemnae]] petition [[Tatius]], king of the [[Sabines]] to lead a joint attack in response to the kidnappings.  Their goal was stymied by Rome's own diplomatic efforts and the other three cities eventually concluded that Tatius was delaying any action on purpose. They decided to attack Rome without the Sabines and their armies are defeated and their cities captured each in turn.

The wars that resulted from the mass abduction committed by the Romans came to a climax in an epic battle fought at the foot of the Capitoline Hill. After the Sabines had captured the Roman Citadel through guile, they occupied the most strategically important point in the city with the help, knowing or otherwise, of [[Tarpeia]]. After several skirmishes and minor engagements, the armies fought two pitched battles featuring valor and losses to both sides.

[[File:The Intervention of the Sabine Women.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Intervention of the Sabine Women, by [[Jacques-Louis David]], 1799]]
In the course of the battle, both sides found themselves on the verge of defeat, only to turn the tide back in the nick of time. Romulus himself was injured by a rock to the head. The fighting ceased only by the coming of dusk. Afterwards, the Sabine women, led by the noble [[Hersilia]], convinced the two kings to make peace.

After a ceasefire, the nations agreed to become a single kingdom under the joint rule of Romulus and Tatius.  The city was expanded and its institutions were adjusted to accommodate the new increase in population and to demonstrate their mutual good will.  The joint kingship lasted for four years until the death of Tatius.  During this time they conquered the [[Camerini]] and made their city a [[Romanization (cultural)|Roman colony]].

====Deaths of Tatius and Romulus====
The two peoples are merged under a joint throne with Rome as the capital.  The Sabines and Romans alike were then declared ''[[Quirites]]'',  from the Sabine city of [[Cures]].  To honor the Sabine women, when Romulus divided the city into 30 [[Curia|local councils]], he named them after the women.  He also recruits three new units of knights and called them [[Roman cavalry|Ramnenses Tatiensis]] (from the two kings names).

Some of Tatius' friends victimized some [[Laurentium|Laurentii]] and when the city sent ambassadors to demand justice, Tatius would not allow Romulus hand over the perpetrators over to them.  A group of Sabines waylay the ambassadors as they sleep on the way home.  Some escape and when word gets back to Rome, Romulus promptly turns the men respsonsible—including one of Tatius' family members—over to a new group of ambassadors.  Tatius follows the group out of the city and frees the accused men by force.  Later, while both kings are participating in a sacrifice in [[Lavinium]] he is killed in retribution.

The account of [[Licinius Macer]] recounts that Tatius was killed when he went alone to try and convince the victims in Lavinium to forgive the crimes committed.  When they discovered he had not brought the men responsible with him, as the senate and Romulus had ordered, an angry mob stones him to death.

After his rule had turned more dictatorial, Romulus met his end.  Either through actions divine or earthly.  According to some reports, Romulus is swept up into heaven, where he takes his place among the gods as [[Quirinus]].  Others point to the hands of the nobility, who had grown ever more resentful of their treatment by king.

==The Bill==
According to the bill's official summary,&lt;ref name=OpenCongressS3081&gt;
{{cite web
 |url         = http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s3081/show#

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bill requires that any person who is arrested on suspicion of terrorism against the United States or its coalition partners be placed in military custody for the purposes of initial interrogation and determination of status as an "unprivileged enemy belligerent".  Such determination is to be made within 48 hours.

The bill proceeds to define an "unprivileged enemy belligerent" as an individual who: 
# has engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners;
# has purposely and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners; or
# was a part of [[al Qaeda]] at the time of capture.

The bill authorizes the [[President of the United States|President]] to establish a "high-value detainee interrogation group" consisting of [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]] personnel with expertise in national security, terrorism, intelligence, interrogation, or law enforcement to perform the interrogation and status determination.

The bill defines that the paramount purpose of such interrogations is the protection of U.S. civilians and facilities through thorough and professional interrogation for intelligence purposes. It further prohibits the use of [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) appropriated funds to prosecute an unprivileged enemy belligerent in an [[Article I and Article III tribunals#Article III tribunals|Article III court]].

Finally, the bill allows for the detention of a person who is deemed to be an unprivileged enemy belligerent without criminal charges or trial for the duration of hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners in which the individual has engaged or which the individual has purposely and materially supported.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4032">'''The Estonian Institute of Historical Memory''' (Estonian: ''Eesti Mälu Instituut'') is an international organization with the aim to investigate [[War crime|international crimes]] and [[human rights violations]] committed by hostile regimes, research the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] ideologies that created such regimes and inform the general public about the research results both in [[Estonia]] and internationally. With its research results and awareness-raising about the hostile regimes and ideologies of the past and the international crimes and [[human rights violations]] they committed, the foundation helps to take a stance against hostile regimes also in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. 

The establishment of the Institute was initiated by the [[Estonia|Estonian]] [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves|President Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] in 2008. The Institute was established by Leon Glikman, Rein Kilk, Jaan Manitski, Tiit Sepp, Hannes Tamjärv and Indrek Teder. The aim of the Institute was set to give the Estonian citizens a comprehensive and objective overview of the state of [[human rights]] in [[Estonia]] during the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet occupation]]. 

In its structure, the Estonian Institute of Historical Memory was similar to the [[Estonian International Commission for Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity]] ([[:et:Inimsusevastaste_Kuritegude_Uurimise_Eesti_Rahvusvaheline_Komisjon|Inimsusvastaste kuritegude Uurimise Eesti Rahvusvaheline Komisjon]]), founded by [[Lennart Meri|President Lennart Meri]] in 1998, which investigated the crimes against humanity committed in Estonia during the [[German occupation of Estonia during World War II|German]] and [[Soviet occupation of Estonia|Soviet occupations]] based on the definitions for [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]] and [[War crime|war crimes]] of the 1998 [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]]. The Estonian Institute of Historical Memory surpasses the frames set upon the research of the Estonian International Commission for Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity and also collects data about such human rights violations committed during the Soviet occupation that are not crimes against humanity by legal definition. For this reason, The Estonian Institute of Historical Memory selected the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 1948 as the legal basis for its historical research. 

The Institute has researched life during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] time in detail and also supported collecting memories to define precisely and without ideological prejudices how and to which extent [[human rights]] were violated in Estonia. It is also the responsibility of the Institute to help Estonian citizens develop a better understanding of what they themselves or their parents and grandparents had to endure during the Soviet occupation.

In 2017, the Institute merged with the [[Unitas Foundation]] into a new organization that combines academic research concerning anti-human regimes (previously the responsibility of the Estonian Institute of Historical Memory) with awareness-raising (previously the responsibility of the [[Unitas Foundation]]). The new organization continues with the name ''The Estonian Institute of Historical Memory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ametlikudteadaanded.ee/avalik/teadaanne?teate_number=1139712|title=Ametlikud Teadaanded|website=www.ametlikudteadaanded.ee|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute is a member institution of the [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.memoryandconscience.eu/members2017/|title=Members {{!}} Platform of European Memory and Conscience|website=www.memoryandconscience.eu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exploring Solutions Past: the Maya Forest Alliance''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] focused on preserving the Maya forest as a cultural resource for global significance. Exploring Solutions Past suggests that environmentally based indigenous practices might improve contemporary problems such as conservation and resource abundance. This organization combines the efforts of different fields and groups of people in order to promote a more sustainable future.

==Background==
Exploring Solutions Past: the Maya Forest Alliance was founded in 2000&lt;ref name=Achievements&gt;{{cite web|title=Achievements|url=http://exploringsolutionspast.org/about/achievements/|website=Exploring Solutions Past|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based in [[Santa Barbara, California]].&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://exploringsolutionspast.org/about/|website=Exploring Solutions Past|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization’s president, [[Anabel Ford]] is known for discovering the ancient Maya site of [[El Pilar]], where Exploring Solutions Past focuses its work. Although most of organization’s actions take place in El Pilar and its surrounding regions, Ford’s vision for the organization is to embrace sustainable traditional practices from different cultures all over the world.&lt;ref name="About our President"&gt;{{cite web|title=About our President|url=http://exploringsolutionspast.org/about/our-president/|website=Exploring Solutions Past|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploring Solutions Past suggests that the Maya did not practice ecologically destructive agriculture, but instead were [[forest gardening|forest gardeners]].&lt;ref name="SB Independent"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kettmann|first1=Matt|title=The Mayas' Ancient Eco-Wisdom: UCSB Archaeologist Anabel Ford Brings the El Pilar Forest Gardners to Town|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2007/oct/11/mayas-ancient-eco-wisdom/|accessdate=16 October 2015|agency=Santa Barbara Independent|publisher=Santa Barbara Independent Inc.|date=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forest was treated as a garden of food and medicine. If the Maya treated the forest well enough for their civilization to survive for such a long period of time, then it’s possible that their traditional practices could improve sustainability practices today. Forest gardens could be a major food and medicinal resource as well as a means to conserve biodiversity and water in the area.&lt;ref name="What is at stake"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is at stake?|url=http://exploringsolutionspast.org/about/what-is-at-stake/|website=Exploring Solutions Past|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploring Solutions Past conducts projects under three categories: Archaeology Under the Canopy, Forest Garden Education, and the Bi-National Peace Park Initiative. These three projects combine efforts of different groups of people, who bring in their knowledge to contribute to the project.

==Archaeology Under the Canopy==
[[Archaeology Under the Canopy]] is a conservation strategy developed by Exploring Solutions Past president Anabel Ford.&lt;ref name="Archaeology Under the Canopy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Archaeology Under the Canopy|url=http://exploringsolutionspast.org/what-we-do/archaeology-under-the-canopy/)|website=Exploring Solutions Past|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford suggests that forest surrounding ancient monuments serves as protection against destructive elements. Therefore, in order to conserve cultural history, the surrounding environment needs to be protected as well. This conservation strategy is used at El Pilar, which leads to a unique tourism experience. Visitors are able to see monuments within the context of its natural forest garden environment.&lt;ref name=MARC&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecotourism at El Pilar|url=http://www.marc.ucsb.edu/research/conservation-philosophy/ecotourism-el-pilar|website=MesoAmerican Research Center|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects based on Archaeology Under the Canopy promote forest conservation in valuable ancient sites.

==Forest Garden Education==
Education is one of the areas of focus for Exploring Solutions Past. Traditional forest gardening has survived by being passed down through generations. In order to promote sustainability on a much larger scale, forest gardeners have to pass their knowledge on to larger numbers of people. Exploring Solutions Past has teamed up with Maya farmers in the El Pilar Forest Garden Network&lt;ref name="El Pilar Forest Garden Network"&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://mayaforestgardeners.org/|website=El Pilar Forest Garden Network|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help spread the knowledge of traditional forest gardening.

Forest gardeners are able to further understand how their practices could benefit future generations and are seeing the importance of continuing their traditions.&lt;ref name="SB Independent" /&gt; Ford and her team have also created a teacher’s guide for school teachers in the area to include forest gardening into their curriculum.&lt;ref name=Rolex&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ford|first1=Anabel|title=Maya forestry for future generations|url=http://blog.rolexawards.com/2011/11/maya-forestry-for-future-generations/|website=Rolex: Awards for Enterprise|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, young students are able to understand the importance of forest gardening.

Exploring Solutions Past encourages the involvement of local communities not only to spread the goal of the organization, but to also improve the economic status of the local people. Anabel Ford's plans to increase the local interest in tourism and agriculture could benefit overall economic status of the regions surrounding El Pilar.&lt;ref name="Science Blog"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kurosaka|first1=Lillian|last2=Schlotter|first2=Bill|title=UCSB Archaeologist Says Innovative Plan for Maya Research Site is Making Major Strides|url=http://www3.scienceblog.com/community/older/archives/F/ucsb135.html|website=Science Blog|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bi-National Peace Park Initiative==
On October 21, 2008, a [[Memorandum of understanding]] (MoU) was signed at the [[Santa Barbara Courthouse]].&lt;ref name="The Current"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Estrada|first1=Andrea|title=Agreement Between UCSB and Guatemala Paves the Way for Archaeological Peace Park|url=http://www.news.ucsb.edu/2008/012488/agreement-between-ucsb-and-guatemala-paves-way-archaeological-peace-park|accessdate=16 October 2015|agency=The Current|publisher=UC Santa Barbara|date=9 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This MoU established the Guatemalan government’s agreement to work with UCSB and the government of Belize to fund research and establish a peace park at El Pilar.&lt;ref name=MoU&gt;{{cite news|last1=Castaneda|first1=Adrian|title=Landmark El Pilar Peace Park Agreement Signed|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2008/oct/28/landmark-el-pilar-peace-park-agreement-signed/|accessdate=16 October 2015|agency=Santa Barbara Independent|publisher=Santa Barbara Independent, Inc.|date=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Pilar is located on the often disputed border between [[Belize]] and [[Guatemala]]. With the concerns for biodiversity and the increasing interest in tourism, both countries understood the significance of El Pilar. The potential benefits to both countries contributed to the establishment of El Pilar as the first binational [[Transboundary protected area|peace park]].

'''Gavan McCormack''' is a researcher specializing in East Asia who is Emeritus Professor and Visiting Fellow, Division of Pacific and Asian History of the [[Australian National University]]. He is also a coordinator of an award-winning [[open access journal]] [[The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus]].

==Academic career==
McCormack read [[Law degree|Law]] and [[Arts degree|Arts]] at the [[University of Melbourne]] from 1955 to 1959. From 1960–62, he spent two years completing an [[Master's degree|MA]] in [[history]]. McCormack spent the 1962–1963 academic year at [[Osaka University of Foreign Studies]] (OUFS) where he took a Diploma in Japanese Language and Culture. From 1963–66, he read [[Chinese language|Chinese]] at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] (SOAS), taking a [[British undergraduate degree classification|second]]. McCormack then spent two years completing a second MA at SOAS in Area Studies (Far East).  From 1969 to 1974, he completed a [[PhD]] at SOAS. His thesis was ''[[Chang Tso-lin]], the Mukden Military Clique, and Japan, 1920–1928: The Development and interrelationships of [[Chinese warlord]]ism and [[Japanese imperialism]] in northeast China''.  This was later published as a book.

His academic career took him to the [[University of Leeds]] in the United Kingdom, then to [[La Trobe University]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia and eventually the [[University of Adelaide]] in South Australia.  In 1990, he was appointed Professor in Japanese at the [[Australian National University]].

McCormack's main research interest is in "modern Japanese (and East Asian) political, intellectual, and environmental history".&lt;ref name= "a"&gt;Professor McCormack's [[Australian National University|ANU]] [http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/people/personal/mccog_pah.php Profile.]&lt;/ref&gt; He has published widely, in academic and popular journals, on the "liberation" struggles in [[South East Asia]].   In more recent times he has become more interested in environmental issues and in 1996 published ''The Emptiness of Japanese Affluence'' which attacked Japanese economic success as a mirage based on environmental exploitation that posed the single greatest threat to stability in the region.  He remains a trenchant critic of the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Presidency]] and the [[American government]] in general.  He has claimed that the North Korean nuclear program is justified by belligerent American rhetoric.

He worked as visiting professor at [[Kobe University]], [[Kyoto University]], [[Ritsumeikan University]], [[Tsukuba University]], [[International Christian University]], and [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name= "a"/&gt;

==Editorial career==
Gavan McCormack had contributed as a guest editorial staff of the [[South Korea]]n newspaper, [[Kyunghyang Shinmun]] from December 2007 to December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_serial_list.html?s_code=ao019 | title = Gavan McCormack's Kyunghyang Shinmun Column | accessdate = 11 September 2011 | language = Korean | quote = Called "개번 매코맥 칼럼" in Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerald Stourzh''' (born 15 May 1929 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]) is an [[Austria]]n [[historian]] who studies [[modern history]], especially the history of [[North America]], of [[Austria]], of [[History of political ideas|political ideas]], of [[constitution]]s and especially of [[human rights]]. He taught, as a professor, at the [[Free University of Berlin]] from 1964 to 1969, and at the [[University of Vienna]] from 1969 until 1997, when he became professor [[emeritus]].

== Life and scientific career ==

Gerald Stourzh, born in Vienna in 1929, was the only child of Herbert and Helene Stourzh (née Anderle). His parents were both University graduates (the father Lutheran, the mother Catholic). Gerald himself is Lutheran. As R.G. Plaschka wrote about him in an [[encomium]] in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Georg Plaschka, ''Gerald Stourzh zum 60. Geburtstag'', in: Emil Brix, Josef Leidenfrost, Thomas Fröschl, Hg., ''Geschichte zwischen Freiheit und Ordnung. Gerald Stourzh zum 60. Geburtstag''. Styria, Graz 1991, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; "there is something of his Lutheran ancestors, of his Lutheran heritage in him, when, confronted by a question of principle, he indicates, shrugging: Here I stand."

His mother, a practising gynecologist, had obtained her doctorate in 1915 when this was still quite unusual for a woman. His father had studied philosophy and made his living employed by the government of Lower Austria, but his real calling was that of a philosophical and political writer. As early as  1934, he wrote&lt;ref name="Traces"&gt;G. Stourzh, ''Traces of an Intellectual Journey'', Introduction of: G. Stourzh, ''From Vienna to Chicago and Back'', Univ. of Chicago Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; warningly about "National Bestialism", as he called [[National Socialism]]. After the ''[[Anschluss]]'' in 1940, the [[Gestapo]] started to investigate Herbert Stourzh, but his early death due to cancer in 1941 probably saved him from greater problems.

As Gerald Stourzh wrote in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;G. Stourzh, ''Menschenrechte und Genocid'', in: G. Stourzh, ''Spuren einer intellektuellen Reise. 3 Essays'', Böhlau, Wien 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-205-78358-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; he owed two precious things to his parents: firstly the unconditional respect for scientific, mental pursuit in intellectual honesty, and secondly the unconditional respect for the human person, for the primacy of the single person versus super-individual entities: be it nation or social position or class or people or race.

Stourzh obtained his [[Matura]] at a Vienna [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in 1947. He then studied history for eight semesters, partly at the [[University of Vienna]], partly at the [[University of Clermont-Ferrand]] in France and at the [[University of Birmingham]] in England. He was impressed by some of his teachers like Heinrich Benedikt or Hugo Hantsch, but influenced more by books (e.g., the books by [[Friedrich Meinecke]] and Josef Redlich). He obtained his degree [[Doctor of Philosophy]] at the University of Vienna in 1951 with a thesis in the field of the history of constitutions and of law, a field which remained his lifelong interest.&lt;ref name="Traces" /&gt;

In 1951, he received an invitation - which he gladly accepted - by the [[political science|political scientist]] [[Hans Morgenthau|Hans J. Morgenthau]] whom he had met before in Austria, to join him as a research assistant at the Center for the Study of American Foreign Policy of the [[University of Chicago]], a center recently created by Morgenthau. As the only historian at this institute, Stourzh got the task of writing a book about [[Benjamin Franklin]]. After his official graduation (in absentia) at the University of Vienna, his position was upgraded to that of a research associate in the rank of instructor and later of assistant professor. Originally hired for a year,  Stourzh eventually stayed in Chicago until 1958:- as a research associate until 1953, from 1953 to 1954 as William Rainey Harper Fellow in the Department of History, from 1954 to 1956 again as a research associate at the University, from 1956 to 1957 as a research associate at the American Foundation of Political Education, and in 1958 again at the University.

During this time, and with Morgenthau's permission,&lt;ref name="Traces" /&gt; Stourzh also studied history and political science at the University and in the "Committee on Social Thought", for example with professors [[Leo Strauss]] (seminar on [[Machiavelli]]), [[Friedrich von Hayek]] (seminars on [[Tocqueville]] and on [[liberalism]]), [[Quincy Wright]] (international relations) and [[Hans Rothfels]] (nationality problems in central Europe). He was especially impressed by the historian William T. Hutchinson, in whose seminar he wrote an essay about [[Charles A. Beard]] that was published in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;It has been republished in: G. Stourzh: ''From Vienna to Chicago and Back. Essays on Intellectual History and Political Thought in Europe and America'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-226-77636-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important result of his Chicago years was the book ''Benjamin Franklin and American Foreign Policy'', that was published by the University of Chicago Press in the spring of 1954, before the author's 25th birthday.&lt;ref name="Traces" /&gt; In 1955, this book received the prize of the [[Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture|American Institute of Early American History and Culture]] for the best book on early American history published in 1954. In the document accompanying the prize, it says, “...you have given us his [i.e, Franklin's] wisdom where he would most want us to have it, in our relation with the rest of the world. It is fitting that you, born and educated in Austria, should have crossed the Atlantic to teach this lesson.”&lt;ref name="Traces" /&gt; In 1962, Stourzh submitted the book on Franklin as a [[Habilitation|habilitation thesis]] at the University of Vienna.

In addition to that, the Chicago years led to several publications by the American Foundation of Political Education, co-edited by Stourzh.&lt;ref&gt;Readings in World Politics, ed. by Robert A. Goldwin, Ralph Lerner, Gerald Stourzh, Oxford University Press, New York 1959; Readings in American Foreign Policy, ed. by Robert A. Goldwin,  Ralph Lerner, Gerald Stourzh, OUP,  New York 1959; Readings in Russian Foreign Policy, ed. by Robert A. Goldwin, Gerald Stourzh, Marvin Zetterbaum, OuP, New York 1959; Readings in American Democracy,  ed. by Gerald Stourzh und Ralph Lerner,  OUP,  New York 1959; 2nd rev. edition, ed. by Gerald Stourzh, Ralph Lerner and H. C. Harlan, OUP,  New York 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Stourzh returned to Vienna in June, 1958, he had finished the first version of a book on [[Alexander Hamilton]] which was, however, not accepted for publication by the editor due to conflicting reviews.&lt;ref name="Traces" /&gt; In view of his new professional duties, this book was finished only several years later, during a research stay 1966/67 at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], and during his stay at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. The book was published as ''Alexander Hamilton and the Idea of Republican Government'' by Stanford University Press in 1970.

After rejecting an invitation for a one-year guest professorship by the [[University of California, Berkeley]], Stourzh returned to Vienna in 1958 to organize the newly created [[Foreign Policy and United Nations Association of Austria|Austrian Association for Foreign Policy and International Relations]]; he was its general secretary until 1962. In 1962, Stourzh passed his [[habilitation]]  and became [[Docent]] for [[Modern History]] at the University of Vienna. In the same year, upon a suggestion by [[Bruno Kreisky]], he entered Austria's [[Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs]], where he had the desk of the [[Council of Europe]]. In 1963, he received a call from the [[Free University of Berlin]] to become a professor of [[Modern History]], especially American history, and to head, at the same time, the section for American history at the newly founded [[John F. Kennedy-Institute for North American Studies]] of that University. He accepted the call and remained at the Free University until 1969, with an interruption due to a research stay at the [[Institute for Advanced Studies]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]. In 1969, he became professor for [[Modern History]] at the [[University of Vienna]], succeeding Friedrich Engel-Janosi. He has remained in that position until becoming professor emeritus in 1997.&lt;ref name="Traces" /&gt;

Although remaining in contact with his Anglo-American research topics due to many lectures in the United States and  a research stay as an "Overseas Fellow" at [[Churchill College, Cambridge|Churchill College]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1976, Stourzh's research activity now followed two lines: firstly,  the problem of the nationalities within the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], roughly between 1848 and 1918, the most important result being the book ''Die Gleichberechtigung der Nationalitäten in der Verfassung und Verwaltung Österreichs 1848-1918'' (''The equality before law of the nationalities in constitution and administration of Austria, 1848 - 1918''), published in 1985;&lt;ref&gt;''Die Gleichberechtigung der Nationalitäten in der Verfassung und Verwaltung Österreichs 1848-1918'', Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Wien 1985. {{ISBN|3-7001-0680-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and secondly, the genesis of the [[Austrian State Treaty]] and of Austrian [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]], and the end of allied occupation of Austria. The main result was a history of the Austrian State Treaty, that has been growing from 1975 to 2005 in altogether five editions with different titles (see Publications). Since the Nineties, continuing earlier studies, Stourzh has been studying the [[history of human rights]] in the [[western world]].

In 1967/68, he was a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]. Since a research stay in 1976, he has been Overseas Fellow of the [[Churchill College, Cambridge|Churchill College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].

In 1962, Stourzh married Christiane Klingsland, Doctor of law, in Vienna. She was a [[feminism|feminist]] and struggled for women's rights all her life. Three daughters came from this marriage: Verena, Theresa and Katharina. Christiane died in 2004. Since 2011, he has been married to Prof. Marie-Luise Deskovic (*8.8.1937 - †10.1.2016).

Gerald Stourzh is also an artist: his love of theater - that dates from his youth - brought him back on stage again: after 50 years, the same persons played the same piece (''Der Zerrissene'' by [[Johann Nestroy]]) again, everyone acting the same part as before - this time for a caritative purpose. In his youth, as a cellist, he played chamber music with friends, and he also wrote an interpretation of the story ''La chute'' by [[Albert Camus]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Mantl, ''Gerald Stourzh und der Rechtsstaat'', in: G. Stourzh, ''Der österreichische Rechtsstaat zwischen habsburgischer Tradition und europäischer Zukunft'',  Savigny-Zeitschrift für Rechtsgeschichte, Germanistische Abteilung, Vol. 122, 2005, p. 379, Footnote 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Her research interests are the social and historical study of biotechnology and life science, from 1900 to the present, the intersections of biology and technology, with a particular focus on cells, and the in vitro conditions of life in research settings. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Hannah Landecker |url=http://www.soc.ucla.edu/people/faculty?lid=5351}} &lt;/ref&gt; Hannah Landecker was Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Rice University through 2007. She was a visiting scholar at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Texas's Institute for Medical Humanities in 2004, where she worked on a project that examined the changing human relationship to living matter in an age of biotechnology. Through a history of the technical manipulation of living cells, she looked at how biological things, including those made with human tissues, have been turned into tools and commercial objects. She is also worked on developing new methods and curricula for teaching the history and social study of biotechnology to undergraduates. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Institute for the Medical Humanities |date= |accessdate=2007-08-21 |title=Institute for the Medical Humanities |url=http://www.utmb.edu/imh/scholarlist.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213062458/http://www.utmb.edu/imh/scholarlist.asp |archivedate=2007-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Landecker has degrees from the Program in Science, Technology and Society at MIT (PhD), and the University of British Columbia (BSc).

{{Indo-European topics}}
The '''Indigenous Aryans''' theory, also known as the '''Out of India theory''' ('''OIT'''), proposes that the [[Indo-European languages]], or at least the [[Indo-Aryan languages]], originated within the [[Indian subcontinent]], as an alternative to the established migration model which proposes the [[Pontic steppe]] as the area of origin of the Indo-European languages. The indigenist view sees the Indo-Aryan languages as having a deep history in the Indian subcontinent, and being the carriers of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. This view proposes an older date than is generally accepted for the [[Vedic period]], which is generally considered to follow the decline of [[Late Harappan|Harappan culture]].

It includes arguments against the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory]], and arguments to re-date the Vedas and the presence of the Vedic people in accordance with traditional, Vedic-[[Puranas|Puranic]] datings. The idea of "Indigenous Aryans" also implies a migration "Out of India" to Europe and [[Central Asia]]. This is contrary to the mainstream scholarly view, saying that the Indo-Aryan languages originated outside India.{{sfn|Trautmann|2005|p=xiii}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}{{sfn|Parpola|2015}}

The proposal has been entwined with political and religious arguments, since it is based on traditional and religious views on Indian history and its identity. There has also been resistance among some Indian scholars to the idea that Indian culture can be divided between external Indo-European and indigenous Dravidian elements, a division which is sometimes described as a legacy of [[British Raj|colonial rule]] and a hindrance to Indian national unity. The debate mostly exists among the scholars of [[Hinduism|Hindu religion]] and the history and archaeology of India, whereas historical linguists nearly unanimously accept the migration model of Indic origins.

== Historical background ==
The standard view on the origins of the Indo-Aryans is the Indo-Aryan migration theory, which states that they entered north-western India at about 1500 BCE.{{sfn|Trautmann|2005|p=xiii}} An alternative view is the idea that the Aryans are indigenous to India, which challenges the standard view.{{sfn|Trautmann|2005|p=xiii}} In recent times the indigenous position has come to the foreground of the public debate.{{sfn|Trautmann|2005|p=xiii-xv}}

{{See also|Language shift|Sanskritization}}

The [[Indo-Aryan migration hypothesis|Indo-Aryan Migration theory]] posits the introduction of [[Indo-Aryan languages]] into South Asia through migrations of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]-speaking people from the [[Pontic steppes|Pontic Steppes]] via Central Asia into the Levant ([[Mitanni]]), south Asia, and Inner Asia ([[Wusun]] and [[Yuezhi]]). It is part of the [[Indo-European migrations|Kurgan-hypothesis/Revised Steppe Theory]], which further describes the spread of Indo-European languages into western Europe via migrations of Indo-European speaking people.

[[Historical linguistics]] provides the main basis for the theory, analysing the development and changes of languages, and establishing relations between the various Indo-European languages, and the time frame wherein these languages developed. It also provides information about shared words, and the corresponding area of the origin of Indo-European, and the specific vocabulary which is to be ascribed to specific regions.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}{{sfn|Witzel|2001}}{{sfn|Witzel|2005}} The linguistic analyses and data are supplemented with archaeological data and anthropological arguments, which together provide a coherent model{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} that is widely accepted.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=460-461}}

In the model, the [[Yamna culture]] is the "Urheimat" of the Indo-Europeans,{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} east of which emerged the [[Sintashta culture]] (2100–1800 BC), from which developed the [[Andronovo culture]] (1800–1400 BC). Andronovo culture interacted with the [[BMAC]] (2300–1700 BC) and, out of this interaction, developed the [[Indo-Iranians]], which split into the Indo-Aryan and the Iranian branches around 1800 BC.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=408}} The Indo-Aryans migrated to the Levant, northern India, and possibly Inner Asia.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009}}

The migration into northern India was not necessarily a large-scale immigration, but may have consisted of small groups,{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=342-343}} possibly of ethnically and genetically heterogeneous composition, who introduced their language and social system into the new territory. These are then emulated by larger groups of people,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=117}}{{refn|group=note|David Anthony (1995): "Language shift can be understood best as a social strategy through which individuals and groups compete for positions of prestige, power, and domestic security […] What is important, then, is not just dominance, but vertical social mobility and a linkage between language and access to positions of prestige and power […] A relatively small immigrant elite population can encourage widespread language shift among numerically dominant indigenes in a non-state or pre-state context if the elite employs a specific combination of encouragements and punishments. Ethnohistorical cases […] demonstrate that small elite groups have successfully imposed their languages in non-state situations."{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=27}}}}{{refn|group=note|Witzel: "Just one "Afghan" IndoAryan tribe that did not return to the highlands but stayed in their Panjab winter quarters in spring was needed to set off a wave of acculturation in the plains, by transmitting its 'status kit' (Ehret) to its neighbors."{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=13}} […] "Actually, even this is, strictly speaking, not necessary. The constant interaction of "Afghan" highlanders and Indus plain agriculturists could have set off the process. A further opening was created when, after the collapse of the Indus Civilization, many of its people moved eastwards, thus leaving much of the Indus plains free for IA style cattle breeding. A few agricultural communities (especially along the rivers) nevertheless continued, something that the substrate agricultural vocabulary of the RV clearly indicates (Kuiper 1991, Witzel 1999a,b). In an acculturation scenario the actual (small) number of people (often used a 'clinching' argument by autochthonists) that set off the wave of adaptations does not matter: it is enough that the 'status kit' (Ehret) of the innovative group (the pastoralist Indo-Aryans) was copied by some neighboring populations, and then spread further.{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=13, note 27}}}} which become absorpted in the new language group.{{sfn|Hickey|2010|p=151}}{{sfn|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|p=39}}{{refn|group=note|Thomason and Kaufman note that Dravidian features in Sanskrit and later Indic languages may be explained by "absorption". They quote Emeneau: "absorption, not displacement, is the chief mechanism in radical language changes of the kind we are considering."{{sfn|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|p=39}} Thomason and Kaufman note that a basic assumption is that Dravidians shifted in cinsiderable numbers, so they could not only impose htier own habits on Indic, but were also numerous enough to influence Indic as a whole.{{sfn|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|p=39}}}} Witzel also notes that "small-scale semi-annual
transhumance movements between the Indus plains and the Afghan and Baluchi highlands continue to this day."{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=13}}

=== "Aryan Invasion theory" ===
The so-called "Aryan Invasion theory" is an outdated variant on this model. In the 1850s, [[Max Müller]] introduced the notion of two Aryan races, a western and an eastern one, who migrated from the Caucasus into Europe and India respectively. Müller dichotomized the two groups, ascribing greater prominence and value to the western branch. Nevertheless, this "eastern branch of the Aryan race was more powerful than the indigenous eastern natives, who were easy to conquer."{{sfn|McGetchin|2015|p=116}} By the 1880s, his ideas had been "hijacked" by racist [[Ethnology|ethnologists]]. For example, as an exponent of [[Scientific racism|race science]], colonial administrator [[Herbert Hope Risley]] (1851 – 1911) used the ratio of the width of a [[nose]] to its height to divide [[Indian people]] into Aryan and Dravidian races, as well as seven castes.{{sfn|Trautmann|1997|p=203}}{{sfn|Walsh|2011|p=171}}

The idea of an Aryan "invasion" was fueled after the discovery of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], also called Harappan Civilisation. The Indus Valley Civilisation underwent [[Late Harappan|decline]] at around the same period during which the Indo-Aryan migration occurred. This led to the idea that this migration was actually an aggressive invasion which caused the decline of the Harappan Civilisation. This argument was developed by the mid-20th century archaeologist [[Mortimer Wheeler]], who interpreted the presence of many unburied corpses found in the top levels of Mohenjo-daro as the victims of conquests. He famously stated that the Vedic god "[[Indra]] stands accused" of the destruction of the Indus Civilisation.{{sfn|Possehl|2002|p=238}}

Scholarly critics have since argued that Wheeler misinterpreted the evidence he found, and that the skeletons were better explained as hasty interments, not victims of a massacre.{{sfn|Possehl|2002|p=238}} The theory has been discarded in mainstream scholarship since the 1980s,{{sfn|Kazanas|2002}} and replaced by much more sophisticated models.{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=311}}{{refn|group=note|Witzel: "For some decades already, linguists and philologists such as Kuiper 1955, 1991, Emeneau 1956, Southworth 1979, archaeologists such as Allchin 1982, 1995, and historians such as R. Thapar 1968, have maintained that the Indo-Aryans and the older local inhabitants ('Dravidians', 'Mundas', etc.) have mutually interacted from early on, that many of them were in fact frequently bilingual, and that even the RV already bears witness to that. They also think, whether explicitly following Ehret's model (1988, cf. Diakonoff 1985) or not, of smaller infiltrating groups (Witzel 1989: 249, 1995, Allchin 1995), not of mass migrations or military invasions. However, linguists and philologists still maintain, and for good reasons, that some IA speaking groups actually entered from the outside, via some of the (north)western corridors of the subcontinent."{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=32}}}}

[[File:Indo-Iranian migrations according to Kazanas.jpg|thumb|right|Indo-Iranian migrations according to Kazanas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omilosmeleton.gr/pdf/en/indology/The_Collapse_of_the_AIT_13_2_2013.pdf Kazanas (2013), ''The Collapse of the AIT'']&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Nevertheless, critics of the Indo-Aryan Migration theory use it to present the Indo-Aryan Migration theory as a variant of "Aryan Invasion Theory".{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=348}}{{refn|group=note|name="invasion"}} According to Witzel, the invasion model was criticised by Indigenous Aryanists for its racist and colonialist undertones:
{{quote|The theory of an immigration of IA speaking Arya ("Aryan invasion") is simply seen as a means of British policy to justify their own intrusion into India and their subsequent colonial rule: in both cases, a "white race" was seen as subduing the local darker colored population.{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=348}}}} While according to Koenraad Elst, a supporter of Indigenous Aryans,
{{quote|"The theory of which we are about to discuss the linguistic evidence, is widely known as the "Aryan invasion theory" (AIT). I will retain this term even though some scholars object to it, preferring the term "immigration" to "invasion." […]  North India’s linguistic landscape leaves open only two possible explanations: either Indo-Aryan was native, or it was imported in an invasion.{{sfn|Elst|2005|p=234-235}}{{refn|group=note|Koenraad Elst: "The theory of which we are about to discuss the linguistic evidence, is widely known as the "Aryan invasion theory" (AIT). I will retain this term even though some scholars object to it, preferring the term "immigration" to "invasion." They argue that the latter term represents a long-abandoned theory of Aryan warrior bands attacking and subjugating the peaceful Indus civilization. This dramatic scenario, popularized by Sir Mortimer Wheeler, had white marauders from the northwest enslave the black aboriginals, so that "Indra stands accused" of destroying the Harappan civilization. Only the extremist fringe of the Indian Dalit (ex-Untouchable) movement and its Afrocentric allies in the USA now insist on this black-and-white narrative (vide Rajshekar 1987; Biswas 1995). But, for this once, I believe the extremists have a point. North India’s linguistic landscape leaves open only two possible explanations: either Indo-Aryan was native, or it was imported in an invasion. In fact, scratch any of these emphatic "immigration" theorists and you’ll find an old-school invasionist, for they never fail to connect Aryan immigration with horses and spoked-wheel chariots, that is, with factors of military superiority.{{sfn|Elst|2005|p=234-235}}}}}}

=== Indigenous Aryanism ===

The "Indigenist position" started to take shape after the discovery of the [[Harappan Civilisation]], which predates the Vedas.{{sfn|Trautmann|2005|p=xxviii-xxix}} According to this alternative view, the Aryans are indigenous to India,{{sfn|Trautmann|2005|p=xxx}} the Indus Civilisation is the Vedic Civilisation,{{sfn|Trautmann|2005|p=xxx}} the Vedas are older than the second millennium BCE,{{sfn|Trautmann|2005|p=xxviii}} there is no difference between the (northern) Indo-European part and the (southern) Dravidian part,{{sfn|Trautmann|2005|p=xxviii}} and the Indo-European languages radiated out from a homeland in India into their present locations.{{sfn|Trautmann|2005|p=xxx}}

These ideas are based on the [[Puranas]], the [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Ramayana]], which contain lists of kings and genealogies,{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=69}}{{sfn|Trautmann|2005|p=xx}} which are used for the traditional chronology of India's ancient history.{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=69-70}} "Indigenists" follow a "Puranic agenda",{{sfn|Witzel|2011|p=72, note 178}} emphasizing that these lists go back to the fourth millennium BCE. Megasthenes, the Greek ambassador to the Maurya court at Patna at ca. 300 BCE, reported to have heard of a traditional list of 153 kings that covered 6042 years, beyond the traditional beginning of the Kaliyuga at 3102 BCE.{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=69}} The royal lists are based on Bardic traditions, and are derived from lists which were orally transmitted and constantly reshaped by the Sūta bards.{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=69}}

These lists are supplemented with astronomical interpretations, which are also used to reach an earlier dating for the Rg Veda.{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=85-90}} Along with this comes a redating of historical personages and events, in which the Buddha is dated to 1700 BCE or even 3139/8 BCE, and Chandragupta Maurya (c. 300 BCE) is replaced by Chandragupta, the Gupta king.{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=88 note 220}}{{refn|group=note|Witzel calls these "absurd dates", and refers to Elst 1999, ''Update on the Aryan Invasion Debate'', p.97 for more of them.{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=88 note 220}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elst: "It is not only the Vedic age which is moved a number of centuries deeper into the past, when comparing the astronomical indications with the conventional chronology. Even the Gupta age (and implicitly the earlier ages of the Buddha, the Mauryas etc.) could be affected. Indeed, the famous playwright and poet Kalidasa, supposed to have worked at the Gupta court in about 400 AD, wrote that the monsoon rains started at the start of the sidereal month of Ashadha; this timing of the monsoon was accurate in the last centuries BC. This implicit astronomy-based chronology of Kalidasa, about 5 centuries higher than the conventional one, tallies well with the traditional high chronology of the Buddha, whom Chinese Buddhist tradition dates to ca. 1100 BC, and the implicit Puranic chronology even to ca. 1700 BC.&lt;ref group=web name="Elst2.3"&gt;[http://www.bharatvani.org/books/ait/ch23.htm Koenraad Elst, ''2.3.

== Indigenist scenarios ==

=== "Indigenous Aryans" scenarios ===
[[Michael Witzel]] identifies three major types of "Indigenous Aryans" scenarios:{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=28}}
:1. A "mild" version that insists on the indigeneity of the Rigvedic Aryans to the North-Western region of the Indian subcontinent in the tradition of [[Aurobindo]] and [[Dayananda]];{{refn|group=note|Witzel mentions:{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=28}}

Kazanas adds a fourth scenario:
:4.The Aryans entered the Indus Valley before 4500 BC and got integrated with the Harappans, or might have been the Harappans.{{sfn|Kazanas|2002}}

=== Main arguments of the "Indigenists" ===

The idea of "Indigenous Aryans" is supported with specific interpretations of archaeological, genetic, and linguistic data, and on literary interpretations of the [[Rigveda]].{{sfn|Bryant|2001}}{{sfn|Bryant|Patton|2005}}&lt;ref group=web name="Kazanas-Collapse" /&gt; Standard arguments, both in support of the "Indigenous Aryans" theory, and in opposition the mainstream Indo-Aryan Migration theory, are:
* Questioning the IAMt:
:* Presenting the Indo-Aryan Migration theory as an "Indo-Aryan Invasion theory";{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=348}}{{refn|group=note|name="invasion"|The term "invasion" is only being used nowadays by opponents of the Indo-Aryan Migration theory.{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=348}} The term "invasion" does not reflect the contemporary scholarly understanding of the Indo-Aryan migrations;{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=348}} and is merely being used in a polemical and distracting way.}}
:* Questioning the methodology of linguistics;{{sfn|Elst|2005}}{{sfn|Kak|2001}}
:* Reinterpretation of the linguistic data, arguing for the ancient, indigenous origins of Sanskrit;{{sfn|Elst|1999}}{{sfn|Elst|2005}}
:* Pointing to the supposed lack of [[Genetics|genetic]] and [[archaeological]] evidence to support such an "invasion" into North West India;{{sfn|Elst|2005}}
:* Contesting the possibility that small groups can change culture and languages in a major way;{{sfn|Kazanas|year unknown}}
* Re-dating India's chronology, re-establishing the Vedic-Puranic chronology:{{sfn|Trautmann|2005|p=xxviii-xxx}}
:* Dating the Rigveda and the Vedic people to the 3rd millennium BC or earlier;{{sfn|Trautmann|2005|p=xxviii}}{{sfn|Kak|1987}}{{sfn|Kak|1996}}{{sfn|Kak|2008}}
:* Identifying the [[Sarasvati River]] with the [[Ghaggar-Hakra River]], which dried up c. 2000 BC;{{sfn|Danino|2010}}
:* Identifying the Vedic people with the Harappan Civilisation;{{sfn|Trautmann|2005|p=xxx}}{{sfn|Kak|1987}}
:* Equating the Harappan Civilisation, Vedic Culture and the Vedic-Puranic chronology.{{sfn|Kak|2015}}

=== Aurobindo's ''Aryan'' person ===
For Aurobindo, an "Aryan" was not a person who belonged to a particular race, but a person who "accepted a particular type of self-culture, of inward and outward practice, of ideality, of aspiration."{{sfn|Heehs|2008|p=255-256}} He wanted to revive India's strength by reviving the Aryan strength and character.{{sfn|Boehmer|2010|p=108}} Aurobindo denied the historicity of a racial division in India between "Aryan invaders" and a native dark-skinned population. Nevertheless, he did accept two kinds of culture in ancient India, namely the Aryan culture of northern and central India and Afghanistan, and the un-Aryan culture of the east, south and west. Thus, he accepted the division of European historians between two types of cultural configurations.{{sfn|Varma|1990|p=79}}

=== The "emerging Out of India" model ===
[[File:OIT map.jpg|260px|right|thumb|Map showing the spread of the Proto-Indo-European language from the Indus Valley. Dates are those of the "emerging non-invasionist model" according to Elst.]]

The "Out of India theory" (OIT), also known as the "Indian Urheimat theory," is the proposition that the [[Indo-European language family]] [[Indo-European homeland|originated]] in [[Northern India]] and spread to the remainder of the Indo-European region through a series of migrations.&lt;ref group=web name="Kazanas-Collapse" /&gt; It implies that the people of the [[Harappan civilisation]] were linguistically Indo-Aryans.{{sfn|Bryant|2001}}

==== Theoretical overview ====
Koenraad Elst, in his ''Update in the Aryan Invasion Debate'', investigates "the developing arguments concerning the Aryan Invasion Theory".{{sfn|Elst|1999}} Elst notes:
{{quote|Personally, I don't think that either theory, of Aryan invasion and of Aryan indigenousness, can claim to have been proven by prevalent standards of proof; even though one of the contenders is getting closer. Indeed, while I have enjoyed pointing out the flaws in the AIT statements of the politicized Indian academic establishment and its American amplifiers, I cannot rule out the possibility that the theory which they are defending may still have its merits.{{sfn|Elst|1999|p=$6.2.3}}}}

Edwin Bryant also notes that Elst's model is a "theoretical exercise:"
{{quote|...a purely theoretical linguistic exercise […] as an experiment to determine whether India can definitively be excluded as a possible homeland. If it cannot, then this further problematizes the possibility of a homeland ever being established anywhere on linguistic grounds.{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=147}}}}

And in ''Indo-Aryan Controversy'' Bryant notes:
{{quote|Elst, perhaps more in a mood of devil’s advocacy, toys with the evidence to show how it can be reconfigured, and to claim that no linguistic evidence has yet been produced to exclude India as a homeland that cannot be reconfigured to promote it as such.{{sfn|Bryant|Patton|2005|p=468}}}}

==== "The emerging alternative" ====
Koenraad Elst summarises "the emerging alternative to the Aryan Invasion Theory" as follows.
{{sfn|Elst|1999|p=$6.3}}

During the 6th millennium BC Proto-Indo-Europeans lived in the [[Punjab region]] of [[North India|northern India]]. As the result of demographic expansion, they spread into [[Bactria]] as the [[Kambojas]]. The [[Paradas]] moved further and inhabited the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] coast and much of central Asia while the [[China|Cinas]] moved northwards and inhabited the [[Tarim Basin]] in northwestern China, forming the [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] group of I-E speakers. These groups were [[Proto-Anatolian]] and inhabited that region by 2000 BC. These people took the oldest form of the Proto Indo-European (PIE) language with them and, while interacting with people of the Anatolian and Balkan region, transformed it into a separate dialect. While inhabiting central Asia they discovered the uses of the horse, which they later sent back to the [[Urheimat]].{{sfn|Elst|1999|p=$6.3}} Later on during their history, they went on to occupy western Europe and thus spread the Indo-European languages to that region.{{sfn|Elst|1999|p=$6.3}}

During the 4th millennium BC, civilisation in India started evolving into what became the urban [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. During this time, the PIE languages evolved to [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]].{{sfn|Elst|1999|p=$6.3}} Some time during this period, the Indo-Iranians began to separate as the result of internal rivalry and conflict, with the Iranians expanding westwards towards [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Persia]], these possibly were the [[Pahlava]]s. They also expanded into parts of central Asia. By the end of this migration, India was left with the Proto-Indo-Aryans. At the end of the [[Mature Harappan]] period, the Sarasvati river began drying up and the remainder of the Indo-Aryans split into separate groups. Some travelled westwards and established themselves as rulers of the [[Hurrian]] [[Mitanni]] kingdom by around 1500 BC (see [[Indo-Aryan superstrate in Mitanni]]). Others travelled eastwards and inhabited the [[Gangetic basin]] while others travelled southwards and interacted with the [[Dravidian people]].{{sfn|Elst|1999|p=$6.3}}

=== David Frawley ===
In books such as ''The Myth of the Aryan Invasion of India'' and ''[[In Search of the Cradle of Civilization]]'', Frawley criticises the 19th century [[Racial groups in India (historical definitions)|racial interpretations of Indian prehistory]], such as the theory of a conflict between invading [[Aryan race|Caucasoid Aryans]] and Dravidians.{{sfn|Arvidsson|2006|p=298}}  In the book ''In Search of the Cradle of Civilization'' (1995), Frawley along with [[Georg Feuerstein]] and [[Subhash Kak]] has rejected the [[Indo-Aryan migration|Aryan Invasion Theory]] and supported the Out of India theory.

Bryant commented that Frawley's historical work is &lt;!-- unambiguously "pro-Hindu" and //needs explaining from page 290 --&gt; more successful in the popular arena, to which it is directed and where its impact "is by no means insignificant", rather than in academic study{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=291}}
and that "(Frawley) is committed to channelling a symbolic spiritual paradigm through a critical empirico rational one".{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=347}}

Pseudo-archaeologist [[Graham Hancock]] (2002) quotes Frawley's historical work extensively for the proposal of highly evolved ancient civilisations prior to our current estimate of history, including in India.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|pp=137, 147–8, 157, 158, 166–7, 181, 182}} Kreisburg refers to Frawley's "The Vedic Literature and Its Many Secrets".{{sfn|Kreisburg|2012|p=22–38}}

== Political significance ==
{{Further|Indian independence movement|Hindu nationalism}}

The "Aryan Invasion Theory" plays an important role in Hindu nationalism, which favors the idea of "Indigenous Aryanism".{{sfn|Fosse|2005|p=435}} It has to be understood to the background of colonialism, and the task of nation-building in India.

=== Colonial India ===
{{Main|British Raj}}
&lt;!-- In the 18th and 19th century Britain colonised India. The British Raj invested colonial rule, aimed at the benefits of Great Britain, and disregarding the rights and interests of the Indians. Reactions against colonial rule arose early on, with socially and religiously inspired movements as the [[Brahmo Samaj]] and the [[Arya Samaj]], but also political organisations who opposed colonial rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Government And Politics|page=31|author=Abbas Hoveyda|publisher=Pearson Education India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually these movements succeeded, leading to the independence of an united India.

Yet, how India is to be governed and united, was and is an enormous challenge. India exists of a multiplicity of cultures, languages and religions. Various political and religious groupings exist, with various, often clashing, views. Hindu nationalism, which sees India as an united, Hindu country, has increasingly gained popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Political Ideas in Modern India: Thematic Explorations|pages=238–241|author=Vrajendra Raj Mehta, Thomas Pantham|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;
Curiosity and the colonial requirements of knowledge about the subject people led the officials of the East India Company to explore the history and culture of India in the late 18th century.{{sfn|Thapar|1996|p=3}} When similarities between Sanskrit, Greek and Latin were discovered by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], a suggestion of "monogenesis" (single origin) was formulated for these languages as well as their speakers. In the latter part of the 19th century, it was thought that language, culture and race were inter-related, and the notion of biological race came to the forefront{{sfn|Thapar|1996|p=4}} The "Aryan race," the presumed identity of Indo-European language speakers was prominent among such races, which was seen to be further subdivided into "European Aryans" and "Asian Aryans," each with their own homelands.{{sfn|Thapar|1996|p=5}}

[[Max Mueller]], who translated the [[Rigveda]] during 1849–1874, postulated an original homeland for all Aryans in central Asia, from where a northern branch was believed to have migrated to Europe and a southern branch came to India and Iran. The Aryans were fair-complexioned Indo-European speakers who conquered the dark-skinned ''dasas'' of India. The upper castes, particularly the Brahmins, were thought to be of Aryan descent whereas the lower castes and Dalits ("untouchables") were thought to be the descendents of ''dasas''.{{sfn|Thapar|1996|p=6}}

The Aryan theory served to provide the colonised Indians with status and self-esteem, making them believe that they are of the same stock as the colonisers, linguistically and racially. However, Christian missionaries such as John Muir and John Wilson drew attention to the plight of lower castes, who they said were oppressed by the upper castes since the Aryan invasions. [[Jyotiba Phule]] argued that the ''dasas'' and ''sudras'' were indigenous people and the rightful inheritors of the land, whereas Brahmins were Aryan and alien.{{sfn|Thapar|1996|p=7}}

The upper castes had their own uses for the Aryan theory. [[Keshab Chunder Sen]] saw the English rule in India as a "reunion of parted cousins." The nationalist leader [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] endorsed the antiquity of ''Rigveda'', dating it to 4500 BC. He placed the homeland of the Aryans somewhere close to the North Pole. From there, Aryans were believed to have migrated south in the post-glacial age, branching into a European branch that relapsed into barbarism and an Indian branch that retained the original, superior civilisation.{{sfn|Thapar|1996|p=8}}

=== Hindu revivalism and nationalism ===
In contrast to the mainstream views, the [[Hindu revivalism|Hindu revivalist movements]] denied an external origin to Aryans. [[Dayananda Saraswati]], the founder of the [[Arya Samaj]] (Society of Aryans), held that Vedas were the source of all knowledge that were revealed to the Aryans. The first man (an Aryan) was created in [[Tibet]] and, after living there for some time, the Aryans came down and inhabited India, which was devoid of any people earlier.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|p=16}}

The [[Theosophical Society]] held that the Aryans were indigenous to India, but that they were also the progenitors of the European civilisation. The Society saw a dichotomy between the spiritualism of India and the materialism of Europe.{{sfn|Thapar|1996|p=9}}

The [[Hindutva|Hindu nationalists]], led by [[V. D. Savarkar|Savarkar]] and [[M. S. Golwalkar|Golwalkar]], eager to construct a Hindu identity for the nation, held that the original Hindus were the Aryans and that they were indigenous to India. There was no Aryan invasion and no conflict among the people of India. The Aryans spoke Sanskrit and spread the Aryan civilization from India to the west.{{sfn|Thapar|1996|p=9}}

Lars Martin Fosse notes the political significance of "Indigenous Aryanism".{{sfn|Fosse|2005|p=435}} He notes that "Indigenous Aryanism" has been adopted by Hindu nationalists as a part of their ideology, which makes it a ''political'' matter in addition to a scholarly problem.{{sfn|Fosse|2005|p=435}} The proponents of Indigenous Aryanism necessarily engage in "moral disqualification" of Western Indology, which is a recurrent theme in much of the indigenist literature.  The same rhetoric is being used in indigenist literature and the Hindu nationalist publications like the ''[[Organiser (newspaper)|Organiser]]''.{{sfn|Fosse|2005|p=437}}

Witzel traces the "indigenous Aryan" idea to the writings of [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar|Savarkar]] and [[Golwalkar]]. Golwalkar (1939) denied any immigration of "Aryans" to the subcontinent, stressing that all Hindus have always been "children of the soil", a notion which according to Witzel is reminiscent of the ''[[blood and soil]]'' of contemporary fascism . Since these ideas emerged on the brink of the internationalist and socially oriented Nehru-Gandhi government, they lay dormant for several decades, and only rose to prominence in the 1980s.{{sfn|Witzel|2006|pp=204–205}}

Bergunder likewise identifies Golwalkar as the originator of the "Indigenous Aryans" notion, and Goel's [[Voice of India]] as the instrument of its rise to notability:
{{quote|The Aryan migration theory at first played no particular argumentative role in Hindu nationalism. […] This impression of indifference changed, however, with Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar (1906–1973), who from 1940 until his death was leader of the extremist paramilitary organization the [[Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS). […] In contrast to many other of their openly offensive teachings, the Hindu nationalists did not seek to keep the question of the Aryan migration out of public discourses or to modify it; rather, efforts were made to help the theory of the indigenousness of the Hindus achieve public recognition. For this the initiative of the publisher Sita Ram Goel (b. 1921) was decisive. Goel may be considered one of the most radical, but at the same time also one of the most intellectual, of the Hindu nationalist ideologues. […] Since 1981 Goel has run a publishing house named ‘Voice of India’ that is one of the few which publishes Hindu nationalist literature in English which at the same time makes a 'scientific' claim. Although no official connections exist, the books of 'Voice of India' — which are of outstanding typographical quality and are sold at a subsidized price — are widespread among the ranks of the leaders of the Sangh Parivar. […] The increasing political influence of Hindu nationalism in the 1990s resulted in attempts to revise the Aryan migration theory also becoming known to the academic public.{{sfn|Bergunder|2004}}}}

Repercussions of the disagreements about Aryan origins have reached [[California]]n courts with the [[Californian Hindu textbook controversy|Californian Hindu textbook case]], where according to the [[Times of India]]&lt;ref group=web name="ToI" /&gt; historian and president of the Indian History Congress, [[Dwijendra Narayan Jha]] in a "crucial affidavit" to the Superior Court of California,
{{quote|...[g]iving a hint of the Aryan origin debate in India, […] asked the court not to fall for the 'indigenous Aryan' claim since it has led to 'demonisation of Muslims and Christians as foreigners and to the near denial of the contributions of non-Hindus to Indian culture'.&lt;ref group=web name="ToI" /&gt;}}

Michael Witzel has severely criticised the "Indigenous Aryans" position:
{{quote|The 'revisionist project' certainly is not guided by the principles of critical theory but takes, time and again, recourse to pre-enlightenment beliefs in the authority of traditional religious texts such as the Purånas. In the end, it belongs, as has been pointed out earlier, to a different 'discourse' than that of historical and critical scholarship. In other words, it continues the writing of religious literature, under a contemporary, outwardly 'scientific' guise […] The revisionist and autochthonous project, then, should not be regarded as scholarly in the usual post-enlightenment sense of the word, but as an apologetic, ultimately religious undertaking aiming at proving the 'truth' of traditional texts and beliefs. Worse, it is, in many cases, not even scholastic scholarship at all but a political undertaking aiming at 'rewriting' history out of national pride or for the purpose of 'nation building'.{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=95}}}}

In her review of Bryant's "The Indo-Aryan Controversy", which includes chapters by Elst and other "indigenists", Stephanie Jamison comments:
{{quote|...the parallels between the Intelligent Design issue and the Indo-Aryan "controversy" are distressingly close. The Indo-Aryan controversy is a manufactured one with a non-scholarly agenda, and the tactics of its manufacturers are very close to those of the ID proponents mentioned above. However unwittingly and however high their aims, the two editors have sought to put a gloss of intellectual legitimacy, with a sense that real scientific questions are being debated, on what is essentially a religio-nationalistic attack on a scholarly consensus.{{sfn|Jamison|2006}}}}

Sudeshna Guha, in her review of ''The Indo-Aryan Controversy'', notes that the book has serious methodological shortcomings, by not asking the question what exactly constitutes historical evidence.{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=341}} This makes the "fair and adequate representation of the differences of opinion" problematic, since it neglects "the extent to which unscholarly opportunism has motivated the rebirth of this genre of 'scholarship'.{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=341}} Guha:
{{quote|Bryant's call for accepting "the valid problems that are pointed out on both sides" (p. 500), holds intellectual value only if distinctions are strictly maintained between research that promotes scholarship, and that which does not. Bryant and Patton gloss over the relevance of such distinctions for sustaining the academic nature of the Indo-Aryan debate, although the importance of distinguishing the scholarly from the unscholarly is rather well enunciated through the essays of Michael Witzel and Lars Martin Fosse.{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=341}}}}

According to Bryant,{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=75}} OIT proponents tend to be linguistic dilettantes who either ignore the linguistic evidence completely, dismiss it as highly speculative and inconclusive,{{refn|group=note|E.g. Chakrabarti 1995 and [[N. S. Rajaram|Rajaram]] 1995, as cited in Bryant 2001.{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=74}}}} or attempt to tackle it with hopelessly inadequate qualifications; this attitude and neglect significantly minimises the value of most OIT publications.{{sfn|Bryant|2001|pp=74–107}}{{sfn|Bryant|1996}}{{refn|group=note|Witzel: "linguistic data have generally been neglected by 
advocates of the autochthonous theory. The only exception so far is a thin book by the Indian linguist S.S. Misra (1992) which bristles with inaccuracies and mistakes (see below) and some, though incomplete discussion by Elst (1999)."{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=32}}}}

Fosse notes crucial theoretical and methodological shortcomings in the indigenist literature.{{sfn|Fosse|2005}} Analysing the works of Sethna, Bhagwan Singh, Navaratna and Talageri, he notes that they mostly quote English literature, which is not fully explored, and omitting German and French Indology. It makes their works in various degrees underinformed, resulting in a critique that is "largely neglected by Western scholars because it is regarded as incompetent."{{sfn|Fosse|2005|p=438}}

;Overview
Edwin Bryant, a cultural historian, has given an overview of the various "Indigenist" positions in his PhD-thesis and two subsequent publications:
* {{cite thesis |last=Bryant |first=Edwin |authorlink=Edwin Bryant (author) |title=The indigenous Aryan debate |publisher=Columbia University |year=1997}}
* {{Citation | last =Bryant | first =Edwin | author-link =Edwin Bryant (author) | year =2001 | title =[[The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture]]: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate | publisher =Oxford University Press | ISBN =0-19-513777-9}}
* {{Citation | last1 =Bryant | first1 =Edwin F. | last2 =Patton | first2 =Laurie L. | year =2005 | title =The Indo-Aryan Controversy. Evidence and interference in Indian History | publisher =Routledge}}

''The indigenous Aryan debate'' and ''The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture'' are reports of his fieldwork, primarily interviews with Indian researchers, on the reception of the "Indo-Aryan Migration theory" in India. ''The Indo-Aryan Controversy''  is a bundle of papers by various "Indigenists", including Koenraad Elst, but also a paper by Michael Witzel.

Another overview has been given by [[Thomas Trautmann]]:

'''Liang Qichao''' ({{zh |t= 梁啟超 }}; [[Cantonese]]: ''Lèuhng Kái-chīu''; 23 February 1873 – 19 January 1929), [[courtesy name]] '''Zhuoru''', [[art name]] '''Rengong''', was a Chinese scholar, [[journalist]], [[philosopher]], and [[reformist]] who lived during the late [[Qing dynasty]] and the early [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. He inspired Chinese scholars with his writings and reform movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personal.kenyon.edu/xiaoy/Yang%20Xiao%20Liang%20Qichao's%20Political%20and%20Social%20Philosophy.pdf|title=Contemporary Chinese Philosophy|website=Kenyon College|first=Xiao|last=Yang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Family===
Liang Qichao was born in a small village in [[Xinhui]], [[Guangdong Province]] on February 23, 1873.

Liang's father, Liang Baoying (梁寶瑛, [[Cantonese]]: ''Lèuhng Bóu-yīng''; courtesy name Lianjian 蓮澗;  [[Cantonese]]: ''Lìhn-gaan''), was a farmer and local scholar, but a classical background that emphasized on tradition and education for ethnic rejuvenescence allowed him to be introduced to various literary works at six years old. By the age of nine, Liang started writing thousand-word essays and became a district-school student soon after.

Liang had two wives: Li Huixian (李惠仙; [[Cantonese]]: ''Lléih Waih-sīn'') and Wang Guiquan (王桂荃; [[Cantonese]]: ''Wòhng Gwai-chyùhn'').  They gave birth to nine children, all of whom became successful individuals through Liang's strict and effective education. Three of them were scientific personnel at the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], including [[Liang Sicheng]], the prominent historian of Chinese architecture.

===Early life===

Liang passed the ''[[Xiucai]]'' (秀才) degree provincial examination at the age of 11.  In 1884, he undertook the arduous task of studying for the traditional governmental exams.  At the age of 16, he passed the ''[[Juren]]'' (舉人) second level provincial exams and was the youngest successful candidate at that time.

In 1890, Liang failed in his ''[[Jinshi (imperial examination)|Jinshi]]'' (進士) degree national examinations in [[Beijing]] and never earned a higher degree. He took the exams along with [[Kang Youwei]], a famous Chinese scholar and [[reformist]]. According to one popular narrative of Liang's failure to pass the Jinshi, the examiner was determined to flunk Kang for his heterodox challenge to existing institutions, but since the exams were all anonymous, he could only presume that the exam with the most unorthodox views was Kang's. Instead, Kang disguised himself by writing an examination [[eight-legged essay]] espousing traditionalist ideas and passed the exam while Liang's paper was assumed to be Kang's and picked out to be failed.

Inspired by the book ''A short account of the maritime circuit'',&lt;ref&gt;徐继畬 ([[Xu Jiyu]]) . 1849 . 瀛環志略 (A short account of the maritime circuit )&lt;/ref&gt; Liang became extremely interested in western [[ideologies]].  After returning home, Liang went on to study with [[Kang Youwei]],  who was teaching at ''Wanmu Caotang'' (萬木草堂) in [[Guangzhou]].  Kang's teachings about foreign affairs fuelled Liang's interest in reforming China.

In 1895, Liang went to the capital [[Beijing]] again with Kang for the national examination. During the examination, he was a leader of the [[Gongche Shangshu movement]]. After failing to pass the examination for a second time, he stayed in Beijing to help Kang publish ''Domestic and Foreign Information''. He also helped to organise the Society for National Strengthening (強學會), where Liang served as secretary. For time, he was also enlisted by the governor of [[Hunan]], [[Chen Baozhen]] to edit reform-friendly publications, such as the [[Hunan Daily]] (''Xiangbao'' 湘報) and the [[Hunan Journal]] (''Xiang xuebao'' 湘學報).

=== Reform movements ===
[[File:KangYouWei.jpg|thumb|148px|left|Kang Youwei &amp;ndash; a mentor of '''Liang Qichao'''.]]

As an advocate of [[constitutional monarchy]], Liang was unhappy with the governance of the Qing Government and wanted to change the status quo in China. He organized reforms with Kang Youwei by putting their ideas on paper and sending them to the [[Guangxu Emperor]] (reigned 1875–1908) of the [[Qing dynasty]]. This movement is known as the ''[[Wuxu Reform]]'' or the [[Hundred Days' Reform]]. Their proposal asserted that China was in need of more than "[[Self-Strengthening Movement|self-strengthening]]", and called for many institutional and ideological changes such as getting rid of corruption and remodeling the state examination system. Liang thus was a major influence in the debates on [[democracy in China]].&lt;ref&gt;Ch 3, "Liang Ch'i-ch'ao and the Chinese Democracy Movement," Andrew Nathan, ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'' (1985): 45-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

This proposal soon ignited a frenzy of disagreement, and Liang became a wanted man by order of [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], the leader of the political conservative faction who later took over the government as [[regent]]. Cixi strongly opposed reforms at that time and along with her supporters, condemned the "Hundred Days' Reform" as being too radical.

In 1898, the Conservative Coup ended all reforms, and Liang fled to Japan, where he stayed for the next 14 years. While in [[Tokyo]] he befriended the influential politician and future Japanese Prime Minister [[Inukai Tsuyoshi]]. In Japan, he continued to actively advocate the democratic cause by using his writings to raise support for the reformers’ cause among overseas Chinese and foreign governments. He continued to emphasize the importance of individualism, and to support the concept of a constitutional monarchy as opposed to the radical [[republicanism]] supported by the Tokyo-based ''Tongmeng Hui'' (the forerunner of the [[Kuomintang]]). During his time in Japan, Liang also served as a benefactor and colleague to [[Phan Boi Chau]], one of Vietnam's most important anti-colonial revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=Japan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=Allen |last2=Nobel |first2=David S  |title=Japan: An Illustrated Encyclopedia |publisher=Kodansha |date=1993 |page=888 |isbn=406205938X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1899, Liang went to Canada, where he met Dr. [[Sun Yat-Sen]] among others, then to [[Honolulu]] in [[Hawaii]]. During the [[Boxer Rebellion]], Liang was back in Canada, where he formed the "[[Royalist Society]]" (保皇會).  This organisation later became the Constitutionalist Party which advocated constitutional monarchy.  While Sun promoted revolution, Liang preached reform.

In 1900-1901, Liang visited Australia on a six-month tour which aimed at raising support for a campaign to reform the Chinese empire in order to modernise China through adopting the best of Western technology, industry and government systems. He also gave public lectures to both Chinese and Western audiences around the country.  This visit coincided with the [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] of the six British colonies into the new nation of Australia in 1901.  He felt this model of integration might well be copied in the diverse regions of China.  He was feted by politicians, and met the first [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[Edmund Barton]].&lt;ref&gt;John Schauble, ''Australia visit shaped ideas of Mao favourite'', [[The Sydney Morning Herald]], 9 December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to Japan later that year.

In 1903, Liang embarked on an eight-month lecture tour throughout the United States, which included a meeting with President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in [[Washington, DC]], before returning to Japan via [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada.

The [[Confucius]] descendant [[Duke Yansheng]] was proposed for replacing the Qing dynasty as Emperor by Liang Qichao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=2014 |title=Modernisation of Chinese Culture: Continuity and Change |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ECJQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |edition=revised |page=74 |isbn=1443867721 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politician===
With the overthrow of the Qing dynasty, constitutional monarchy became an increasingly irrelevant topic. Liang merged his renamed Democratic Party with the Republicans to form the new [[Progressive Party (China)|Progressive Party]]. He was very critical of Sun Yatsen's attempts to undermine President [[Yuan Shikai]]. Though usually supportive of the government, he opposed the expulsion of the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] from [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|parliament]].

In 1915, he opposed Yuan's attempt to make himself emperor. He convinced his disciple [[Cai E]], the military governor of [[Yunnan]], to rebel. Progressive party branches agitated for the overthrow of Yuan and more provinces declared their independence. The revolutionary activity that he had frowned upon was utilised successfully. Besides [[Duan Qirui]], Liang was the biggest advocate of entering [[World War I]] on the [[Allies of World War I|Allied side]]. He felt it would boost China's status and ameliorate foreign debts. He condemned his mentor, [[Kang Youwei]], for assisting in the [[Manchu Restoration|failed attempt to restore the Qing]] in July 1917. After failing to turn Duan and [[Feng Guozhang]] into responsible statesmen, he left politics.

== Contributions to journalism ==

===As a journalist===
'''[[Lin Yutang]]''' (林語堂) once called Liang "the greatest personality in the history of Chinese journalism," while [[Joseph Levenson]], author of ''Liang Ch'i-ch'ao and the Mind of Modern China'', described Liang as "a brilliant scholar, journalist, and political figure."

Liang Qichao was the "most influential turn-of-the-century scholar-journalist," according to Levenson.  Liang showed that newspapers and magazines could serve as an effective medium for communicating political ideas.

Liang, as a historian and a journalist, believed that both careers must have the same purpose and "moral commitment," as he proclaimed, "by examining the past and revealing the future, I will show the path of progress to the people of the nation." Thus, he founded his first newspaper, called the ''Qing Yi Bao'' (清議報), named after a student movement of the [[Han dynasty]].

Liang's exile to Japan allowed him to speak freely and exercise his intellectual autonomy. During his career in journalism, he edited two premier newspapers, ''Zhongwai Gongbao'' (中外公報) and ''Shiwu Bao'' (時務報). He also published his moral and political ideals in ''Qing Yi Bao'' (清議報) and ''[[New Citizen]]'' (新民叢報).

In addition, he used his literary works to further spread his views on republicanism both in China and across the world. Accordingly, he had become an influential journalist in terms of political and cultural aspects by writing new forms of periodical journals. Furthermore, journalism paved the way for him to express his [[patriotism]].

===''New Citizen Journal''===
Liang produced a widely read biweekly journal called ''New Citizen'' (''Xinmin Congbao'' 新民叢報), first published in [[Yokohama]], [[Japan]] on February 8, 1902.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Liang qichao2.jpg|left|frame|Liang Qichao]] --&gt;
The journal covered many different topics, including politics, religion, law, economics, business, geography and current and international affairs. In the journal, Liang coined many Chinese equivalents for never-before-heard theories or expressions and used the journal to help communicate public opinion in China to faraway readers. Through news analyses and essays, Liang hoped that the ''New Citizen'' would be able to start a "new stage in Chinese newspaper history."

A year later, Liang and his co-workers saw a change in the newspaper industry and remarked, "Since the inauguration of our journal last year, there have come into being almost ten separate journals with the same style and design."

Liang spread his notions about democracy as chief editor of the ''New Citizen Journal''. The journal was published without hindrance for five years but eventually ceased in 1907 after 96 issues.  Its readership was estimated to be 200,000.

===Role of the newspaper===
As one of the pioneers of Chinese journalism of his time, Liang believed in the "power" of newspaper, especially its influence over government policies.

'''Using newspapers and magazines to communicate political ideas:''' Liang realised the importance of journalism's social role and supported the idea of a strong relationship between politics and journalism before the [[May Fourth Movement]], (also known as the [[New Culture Movement]]). He believed that newspapers and magazines should serve as an essential and effective tool in communicating political ideas. He believed that newspapers did not only act as a historical record, but was also a means to "shape the course of history."

'''Press as a weapon in revolution:''' Liang also thought that the press was an "effective weapon in the service of a nationalist uprising". In Liang's words, the newspaper is a “revolution of ink, not a revolution of blood.” He wrote, "so a newspaper regards the government the way a father or elder brother regards a son or younger brother &amp;mdash; teaching him when he does not understand, and reprimanding him when he gets something wrong." Undoubtedly, his attempt to unify and dominate a fast-growing and highly competitive press market has set the tone for the first generation of newspaper historians of the May Fourth Movement.

'''Newspaper as an educational program:''' Liang was well aware that the newspaper could serve as an "educational program", and said, "the newspaper gathers virtually all the thoughts and expressions of the nation and systematically introduces them to the citizenry, it being irrelevant whether they are important or not, concise or not, radical or not. The press, therefore, can contain, reject, produce, as well as destroy, everything."

For example, Liang wrote a well known essay during his most radical period titled "The Young China" and published it in his newspaper ''Qing Yi Bao'' (清議報) on February 2, 1900. The essay established the concept of the nation-state and argued that the young revolutionaries were the holders of the future of China. This essay was influential on the Chinese political culture during the May Fourth Movement in the 1920s.

'''Weak press:''' However, Liang thought that the press in China at that time was quite weak, not only due to lack of financial resources and to conventional social prejudices, but also because "the social atmosphere was not free enough to encourage more readers and there was a lack of roads and highways that made it hard to distribute newspapers". Liang felt that the prevalent newspapers of the time were "no more than a mass commodity".  He criticized that those newspapers "failed to have the slightest influence upon the nation as a society".

==Literary career==
[[File:Liang Qichao4a.jpg|thumb|right|Liang Qichao]]
Liang Qichao was both a traditional [[Confucian scholar]] and a [[reformist]]. Liang Qichao contributed to the reform in late Qing by writing various articles interpreting non-Chinese ideas of history and government, with the intent of stimulating Chinese citizens' minds to build a new China. In his writings, he argued that China should protect the ancient teachings of [[Confucianism]], but also learn from the successes of Western political life and not just Western technology. Therefore, he was regarded as the pioneer of political fiction.

Liang shaped the ideas of [[democracy in China]], using his writings as a medium to combine Western scientific methods with traditional Chinese historical studies. Liang's works were strongly influenced by the Japanese political scholar [[Katō Hiroyuki]], who used methods of [[social Darwinism]] to promote the [[Statism|statist]] ideology in Japanese society. Liang drew from much of his work and subsequently influenced Korean nationalists in the 1900s.

===Historiographical thought===
Liang Qichao’s [[historiography|historiographical]] thought represents the beginning of modern [[Chinese historiography]] and reveals some important directions of Chinese historiography in the twentieth century.

For Liang, the major flaw of "[[old historians]]" ({{lang|zh|舊史家}}) was their  failure to foster the national awareness necessary for a strong and modern nation. Liang's call for new history not only pointed to a new orientation for historical writing in China, but also indicated the rise of modern historical consciousness among Chinese intellectuals. He advocated the [[Great Man theory]] in his 1899 piece, "Heroes and the Times" ({{lang|zh|英雄与时势}}, ''Yīngxióng yǔ Shíshì''), and he also wrote biographies of European state-builders such as [[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Horatio Nelson]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Lajos Kossuth]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], and [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]]; as well as Chinese men including [[Zheng He]], [[Tan Sitong]], and [[Wang Anshi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Worship of General Yue Fei and His Problematic Creation as a National Hero in Twentieth Century China|first=Marc Andre|last=Matten|journal=Frontiers of History in China|date=March 2011|volume=6|issue=1|pages=74–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Horner"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rising China and Its Postmodern Fate: Memories of Empire in a New Global Context|first=Charles|last=Horner|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=2009|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period of Japan's challenge in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–95), Liang was involved in protests in Beijing pushing for an increased participation in the governance by the Chinese people. It was the first protest of its kind in modern Chinese history. This changing outlook on tradition was shown in the [[historiographical revolution]] ({{lang|zh|史學革命}}) launched by Liang Qichao in the early twentieth century. Frustrated by his failure at political reform, Liang embarked upon cultural reform. In 1902, while in exile in Japan, Liang wrote "The [[New Historiography]]" ({{lang|zh|新史學}}), which called on Chinese to study world history to understand China rather than just [[Chinese history]].&lt;ref name="Horner"/&gt; The article also attacked old historiographical methods, which he lamented focused on dynasty over state; the individual over the group; the past but not the present; and facts, rather than ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The "New History" in China: A Contrast to the West|first=Qineng|last=Chen|journal=''Storia della Storiografia'' [History of Historiography]|volume=48|year=2005|pages=112–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translator===
[[File:Liang's calligraphy.jpg|thumb|left|Liang's calligraphy]]
Liang was head of the Translation Bureau and oversaw the training of students who were learning to translate Western works into Chinese.  He believed that this task was "the most essential of all essential undertakings to accomplish" because he believed Westerners were successful - politically, technologically and economically.

'''Philosophical Works''': After escaping Beijing and the government crackdown on anti-Qing protesters, Liang studied the works of [[Western philosopher]]s of the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, namely [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[David Hume|Hume]] and [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]], translating them and introducing his own interpretation of their works.  His essays were published in a number of journals, drawing interest among Chinese intellectuals who had been taken aback by the dismemberment of China's formidable empire at the hands of foreign powers.

'''Western Social and Political Theories''': In the early 20th century, Liang Qichao played a significant role in introducing Western social and political theories in Korea such as Social Darwinism and international law.  Liang wrote in his well-known [[manifesto]], ''New People''  (新民說):

:''“Freedom means Freedom for the Group, not Freedom for the Individual. (…) Men must not be slaves to other men, but they must be slaves to their group. For, if they are not slaves to their own group, they will assuredly become slaves to some other.”''

===Poet and novelist===
Liang advocated reform in both the genres of poem and novel. The ''Collected Works from the Ice-Drinker's Studio'' (飲冰室合集) is his representative works in literature compiled into 148 volumes.

Liang gained his idea of calling his work as ''Collected Works of Yinbingshi'' from a passage of [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]] (《莊子•人間世》). It states that "Every morning, I receive the mandate [for action], every evening I drink the ice [of disillusion], but I remain ardent in my inner mind" (吾朝受命而夕飲冰，我其內熱與). As a result, Liang called his workplace as "The Ice-drinker studio" (Yinbingshi), and addressed himself as ''Yinbingshi Zhuren'' (飲冰室主人), literally ''Host of the Ice-drinker studio'', in order to present his idea that he was worrying about all the policial matters, so he would still try his best to reform the society by the effort of writings.

Liang also wrote fiction and scholarly essays on fiction, which included ''Fleeing to Japan after failure of Hundred Days' Reform'' (1898) and the essay ''On the Relationship Between Fiction and the Government of the People'' (論小說與群治之關係,1902).  These novels emphasized modernization in the West and the call for reform.

===Educator===
In the late 1920s, Liang retired from politics and taught at the Tung-nan University in [[Shanghai]] and the [[Tsinghua University|Tsinghua]] Research Institute in [[Peking]] as a tutor.  He founded ''Chiang-hsüeh she'' (Chinese Lecture Association) and brought many intellectual figures to China, including [[Driesch]] and [[Rabindranath Tagore|Tagore]].  Academically he was a renowned scholar of his time, introducing Western learning and ideology, and making extensive studies of ancient Chinese culture.

During this last decade of his life, he wrote many books documenting Chinese cultural history, Chinese literary history and historiography. Liang reexamined the works of [[Mozi]], and authored, amongst other works, ''The Political Thought of the Pre-Qing Period'', and ''Intellectual Trends in the Qing Period.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Rise of Modern China: Sixth Edition|last = Hsu|first = Immanuel|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0-19-512504-7|location = New York|pages = 509–510}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a strong interest in [[Buddhism]] and wrote numerous historical and political articles on its influence in China. Liang influenced many of his students in producing their own literary works. They included [[Xu Zhimo]], renowned modern poet, and [[Wang Li (linguist)|Wang Li]], an accomplished poet and founder of [[Chinese language|Chinese linguistics]] as a modern discipline.

===Legacy===
Liang's pedigree book was once lost with only one page left. The family members recreated the naming method by giving sixteen characters in a sequence, each generation following one. Liang didn't follow it by using ‘思’ to his children [https://user.qzone.qq.com/3365478257/photo/V11OVX8c4ShsYR/ (the page's photocopy)].

'''Mir''' ({{lang-be|Мір}}; {{lang-ru|Мир}}; both meaning "world" and "peace"; but the name most likely originates from the name of the river the settlement is situated on) is a [[Urban-type settlements in Belarus|town]] in [[Kareličy]] (Карэлічы) [[raion]], [[Hrodna Voblast]], [[Belarus]] on the banks of [[Miranka River]], about 85 kilometers southwest of the national capital, [[Minsk]].

Prior to 1939 the town was in [[Poland]].

==History==
[[File:Комплекс Мирского замка.JPG|left|thumb|[[Mir Castle Complex|Mir Castle]]|300px]]
Mir village was founded sometime prior to 1345. It is home to [[Mir Castle Complex|a late medieval castle]], which made the town the target of many attacks over the centuries. The town belonged to the [[Illinič]] family ([[Korczak coat of arms]]) first and then to the [[Radziwiłł]] family. It was destroyed by the Swedish forces in 1655 ([[Deluge (history)|Deluge]]) and again by the Swedes during the [[Great Northern War]] in 1706. In 1792, the Lithuanian division of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] army under [[Józef Judycki]] was routed by the invading Imperial Russian army corps under [[Boris Mellin]] (see [[Battle of Mir (1792)|Battle of Mir]]). During the Napoleonic invasion of Russia in 1812, Russian Imperial cavalry, artillery and cossack regiments ambushed and routed the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] 3 [[uhlan]] divisions ([[Battle of Mir (1812)]]). The retreating Russians, withdrawing east, abandoned the town and dynamited the castle. During the Middle Ages it was first located in the [[Principality of Polotsk]], after the [[Battle on the river Nemiga]] in the [[Principality of Minsk]], then was taken over by [[Kievan Rus']] but after the [[Mongol Invasion]] the Rus' rule diminished and since 1242 Mir belonged to the expanding and dynamic [[Duchy of Lithuania]].

In 1569, it became a part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. From 1793, it was part of the Russian Empire ([[Partitions of Poland]]), returned to Poland in 1920, then occupied first by the [[Soviet Union]] in September 1939, from 1941 through 1944 by Nazi Germany, then again by the Soviet Union and remained within it as part of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] until 1991, when it became part of independent Belarus.

Mir was the site of two very famous horse fairs associated with [[Saint Nikolaus]] feast days, first held on May 9 and the second fair on December 6 each year. Both fairs lasted four weeks each and were very popular and well known throughout the country until 1939. [[Romani People|Roma]] practically dominated the fairs as horse traders, and numerous Roma community thrived in the town until 1939. The fairs collapsed in 1941, when Nazi Germany invaded the Belorussian Soviet Republic and murdered the Roma people of Mir.

Mir's claim to fame in [[Jewish Diaspora]] history is that it was the original home of the [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir yeshiva]] which operated there intermittently from 1815 until the fall of [[Poland]] in 1939, when the invading communist Soviet Red Army and security forces pressured the school to close and relocate to then still free Lithuania. (Current incarnations of the yeshiva are located in [[Mir yeshiva (Brooklyn)|Brooklyn, New York]], [[Mir yeshiva (Jerusalem)|Jerusalem]] and [[Mir yeshiva (Modi'in Illit)|Modi'in Illit]].)

Today, Mir has little industry and is no longer an internationally renowned center of [[Judaism|Jewish]] learning or Roma horse trade.  Home to about 2,500 people, virtually none of whom are descended from the once thriving Jewish and Roma communities, its primary attraction is the Mir Castle as well as memorials erected by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government and various Jewish groups over the past half century. On the eve of World War II, some 2,400 Jews lived in Mir, about half of the town's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/communities/mir/overview.asp |title=Mir, Poland (today Belarus) |work=yadvashem.org |author= |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of them, except about 50 escapees, were murdered by the Germans in 1941.

'''Mirza Mehdi Khan Astarabadi''' ({{lang-fa|میرزا مهدی خان استرآبادی}}), also known by his title of '''Monshi-ol-Mamalek''' ({{lang|fa|منشی الممالک}}), was the chief secretary, historian, biographer, advisor, strategist, friend and confidant of King [[Nader Shah Afshar]] (r. 1736-1747). He who wrote and accepted the different decisions and files related to the Empire.

==Biography==
Even though Mirza Mehdi rose to become an eminent figure in 18th century Iran, not much is known about his life.{{sfn|Perry|1987|pages=844-845}} A native of [[Astarabad]] (present-day Gorgan), he was the son of a certain Mohammad-Nasir, and he presumably spent his young life in [[Isfahan]] during the late [[Safavid]] period, where he practised to become a [[civil servant]].{{sfn|Perry|1987|pages=844-845}}

During the reign of the last Safavid king, [[Sultan Husayn]] (r. 1696-1722), the Afghans attacked Iran. When military chief Nader Shah expelled the Afghans, Mirza Mehdi Khan supported him in the Safavid court.{{sfn|Perry|1987|pages=844-845}} During his long service to Nader, he first functioned as "head of the royal correspondance" (''Monshi-ol-Mamalek''), until Nader's coronation at the [[Mugan plain]] in 1736.{{sfn|Perry|1987|pages=844-845}} Afterwards, he became his official biographer and historiographer.{{sfn|Perry|1987|pages=844-845}}

During Nader's [[Nader's Dagestan campaign|Dagestan campaign]], he accompanied him. About Nader's disembarking he noted "The banners that conquered the world are leaving Iran and heading to [[Dagestan]]".&lt;ref&gt;В. Г. Гаджиевю Указ. соч. С. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1747, Astarabadi was sent as an ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire]] together with Mostafa Khan Bigdeli [[Shamlu]] in order to ratify the [[Treaty of Kerden]] (1746).{{sfn|Perry|1987|pages=844-845}} However, they had only reached [[Baghdad]] when the embassy learned about the death of Nader Shah, which forced them go back to Iran.{{sfn|Perry|1987|pages=844-845}} Everything remains unknown regarding the fate of his subsequent career.{{sfn|Perry|1987|pages=844-845}} He must have "evidently" retired from public life in order to be able to finish the [[philological]] and historical works which he had been compiling during his service to Nader.{{sfn|Perry|1987|pages=844-845}}

==Works==
He was the author of historical books such as ''[[Tarikh-e-Jahangoshay-e-Naderi]]'' (History of Nadir Shah's Wars), which is a book studied in the [[Yale University]] and has this presentation : « Tarikh-i Nadiri. A history of Nadir shah Afshar, who ruled Iran from 1736 to 1747, written in Persian by Mahdi Khan Astarabadi (d. 1759), his secretary and court historian ». This book was also the object of research in 1996 by [[United States Naval Academy]]. Mirza Mehdi Khan also wrote "Dareh Nadareh" and "A Persian Guide to the Turkish Language" in 1759 with an introduction of Sir [[Gerard Clauson]].

[[Image:Astarabadi and Nader.JPG|thumbnail|right|Picture showing Mirza Mehdi Khan in pink clothes and Nader Shah Afshar on horseback (zoomed out).]]   
In 1768, King [[Christian VII]] of Denmark visited England. He took with him the book of Nader Shah, written by Mirza Mehdi Khan Astarabadi and asked [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]] (1746-1794), orientalist and specialist in the history of old India, to translate it into French. This, in turn, led to the publication of the (not entirely accurate) book, "Histoire de Nader Chah", in 1770. This translation by William Jones was then later translated into [[German language|German]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]].{{sfn|Perry|1987|pages=844-845}}

The [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) event was held on November 9, 1997, at the [[Bell Centre|Molson Centre]] in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The manipulation – a "[[shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] [[screwjob]]" in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|professional wrestling parlance]] – occurred without Hart's knowledge and resulted in Hart, the reigning [[WWE Champion|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]], losing the title to Michaels in Hart's last match with the WWF before departing for rival promotion [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW). The "screwjob" is generally believed to be an off-screen betrayal of Hart, who was one of the WWF's longest-tenured and most popular performers at the time.

Hart won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]] in August 1997. A week prior to Survivor Series, Hart, who had performed for the WWF since 1984, signed a contract to perform with WCW beginning in December 1997. McMahon sought to prevent Hart from leaving the company as the champion, but Hart was unwilling to lose the title to Michaels – with whom he had a long feud both on-screen and off – at Survivor Series in his home country. Hart, Michaels, and McMahon came to an agreement where the Survivor Series match would end with a disqualification, which under normal rules would result in Hart retaining the title. Hart would then lose or forfeit the title at a later date. However, McMahon decided without Hart's knowledge that Michaels would win the title at Survivor Series. Accounts differ as to who exactly was involved in the plan and the extent of their involvement. The plan was executed when match referee [[Earl Hebner]], on direct order from McMahon, ended the match as Michaels held Hart in the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]] [[Grappling hold|submission hold]], Hart's signature finishing move, even though Hart had not submitted. Michaels was declared the victor by submission and crowned as the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion.

The Montreal Screwjob has garnered a notorious legacy both on-screen and off, and was partly chronicled in the documentary film ''[[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows]]'' (1998). The far-reaching impact of the incident led to its adoption as a theme in matches and storylines of the WWF's [[The Attitude Era|"Attitude Era"]] and the creation of the character, "[[Vince McMahon#Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Mr. McMahon: 1997–1999|Mr. McMahon]]", the evil boss. Many wrestling fans, and several within the business, believe the entire incident was an elaborate [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work (noun)|work]] executed in [[#Legitimacy|collaboration with Hart]]. Nonetheless, Hart was ostracized from the WWF while McMahon and Michaels continued to receive angry responses from audiences for many years in Hart's home country of Canada. Hart and McMahon later reconciled, and Hart was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on April 1, 2006. On the January 4, 2010 episode of ''WWE Raw'', Hart, in his first live appearance on WWE television since the 1997 Survivor Series, had a lengthy on-screen discussion with Michaels about the Montreal Screwjob and other events in their past, and agreed to call a truce, bringing closure to the incident after more than 12 years.&lt;ref name="calgary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baltimore"/&gt; Hart would defeat McMahon at [[WrestleMania 26]] in a match built around lingering animosity from the Screwjob.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Bret Hart vs. Mr. McMahon - No Holds Barred Lumberjack Match: WrestleMania 26|url=https://www.wwe.com/videos/bret-hart-vs-mr-mcmahon-wrestlemania-26-no-holds-barred-lumberjack-match|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longtime industry writer Mike Johnson referred to the 1997 Survivor Series bout in which the Screwjob occurred as "arguably the most talked-about match in the history of professional wrestling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/97719/119-this-day-in-history-bret-hart-vs-shawn-michaels-in-montreal.html|title=11/9 This Day in History: Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels in Montreal|last=Johnson|first=Mike|date=November 9, 2015|website=PWInsider|accessdate=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hart's departure from the WWF==
[[File:BretHartJuly242005.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bret Hart|Bret "The Hitman" Hart]]]]
At the time of the screwjob, Bret Hart was a 14-year veteran of the WWF, having started his career in the 1980s as one-half of the popular [[The Hart Foundation|Hart Foundation]] [[tag team]] with his brother-in-law [[Jim Neidhart]]. After the team had two reigns as the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Champions]], Hart then achieved tremendous success as a singles performer in the 1990s, twice taking the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Heavyweight Title]], and then winning the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] five times. Hart took a seven-month leave of absence from the company after [[WrestleMania XII]], during which he negotiated both a new contract with the WWF and an offer from its rival, [[World Championship Wrestling]]. In October 1996, Hart declined a three-year, $8.4 million offer from WCW, opting to sign an unprecedented 20-year deal that he had been offered by McMahon, which promised to make him the highest-paid wrestler in the company and secure him a major role with the company management following his retirement. Both Hart and the WWF saw the contract as an expression of mutual loyalty.&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite web|last=Meltzer|first=Dave|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|date=1997-11-17|url=http://www.brethart.com/facts.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060406153712/http://www.brethart.com/facts.asp|archivedate=2006-04-06|title=Montreal Screwjob|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MF"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mick Foley|authorlink=Mick Foley|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|page=624|year=2000|publisher=Regan Books|isbn=978-0-06-103101-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-1997, the WWF was facing financial difficulties due to stiff competition from WCW, which had become the largest professional wrestling promotion in the United States. At the same time, McMahon was planning to [[Initial public offering|make the WWF a publicly traded company]], a move which required him to minimize any long-term financial commitments.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestling.about.com/od/thebiggestrivalries/a/shawnvsbret.htm|title=Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart|last=Cohen|first=Eric|publisher=Prowrestling at About.com|accessdate=2007-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several months prior to Survivor Series, Hart and Shawn Michaels had several backstage arguments including a fight before a [[house show]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] (after Michaels had publicly accused Hart of having an affair with [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Sunny]]), which saw Michaels suspended for two months. After a show in [[San Jose, California]] on October 12, 1997, Hart claimed he spoke to Michaels about being professional and trusting one another in the ring. Hart allegedly said he would have no problem losing to Michaels if McMahon requested. Hart also claimed that when Michaels replied that he would never lose to Hart, Bret was shocked and became angry.&lt;ref name = "BH1"/&gt; This led to Hart's outright refusal to lose the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Michaels at the pay-per-view event in Montreal, although in [[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows|Hart's documentary]], Hart states to McMahon that he would happily drop the belt but not in Canada. However, in his own autobiography, Michaels refuted Hart's claim, saying that he would have cleanly lost to Hart had storylines demanded so (however others, including [[Jim Cornette]] in various shoot interviews, have often refuted this saying that they knew first hand that Michaels had no intention of jobbing to Hart). Michaels also pointed out that he had lost cleanly to Hart several times in the past, most notably in the WWF's first ever [[ladder match]] at a ''[[WWF Challenge|Wrestling Challenge]]'' taping on July 21, 1992, which would subsequently be made available on multiple [[WWE Home Video|Coliseum/WWE Home Video]] releases&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm WWF @ Portland, ME - Civic Center - July 21, 1992]. The History of WWE. Retrieved May 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the main event of [[Survivor Series (1992)|Survivor Series 1992]]. Michaels also lost to Hart in a [[Steel cage|Steel Cage]] match in December 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/93.htm WWF @ Utica, NY - War Memorial - December 1, 1993 (4,500)]. The History of WWE. Retrieved May 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

McMahon believed he made the right choice in fighting for Hart to return, which kept him from joining rival WCW in 1996. However, by late 1997 the WWF's monetary problems were at an all-time high. McMahon began to defer payments to Hart, claiming that the WWF was in "financial peril." At this time, McMahon reviewed the WWF's plans for the future, and saw the likes of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[The Undertaker]] and [[D-Generation X]] leading what was to become "[[The Attitude Era]]". His plans included many stars, but not Hart; as such McMahon encouraged Hart to reopen negotiations with WCW.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;

While Hart considered an offer from then-WCW President [[Eric Bischoff]], McMahon informed Hart that the WWF would honor his contract if he chose to stay. However, when Hart talked to McMahon about future plans and storylines, he was disappointed by McMahon's response and what he considered lackluster suggestions. As seen in the documentary, ''[[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows]]'', Hart acknowledged around this time that his career had been sabotaged by nationalist changes to his character. Throughout 1997, "The Hitman" regularly criticized America and deemed it inferior to Canada, drawing the ire of American audiences and yet winning him the respect of WWF's sizable Canadian fan-base; this rendered Hart neither a definite hero nor a villain and left him unable to properly enter into feuds with other wrestlers. Hart had also been unhappy about McMahon's move towards more controversial subject matter, which the World Wrestling Federation would later call "The Attitude Era". Convinced that McMahon's future plans did not include him, Hart resigned from the WWF. He signed an agreement with WCW, which had just offered him a large $3 million per annum contract on November 1, 1997&lt;!--offer or acceptance?--&gt;. McMahon was worried about the possibility of him entering WCW as the WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Hart asked McMahon if he would be mocked after leaving for WCW, as had occurred with other wrestlers who had transferred to WCW from the WWF; for example, in the previous year the WWF had made fun of [[Hulk Hogan]] and [["Macho Man" Randy Savage]] in vignettes referring to them as "The Huckster" and "The Nacho Man", in addition to having [[Kane (wrestler)|Glenn Jacobs]] and [[Rick Bognar]] portray "Diesel" and "Razor Ramon", characters that [[Kevin Nash]] and [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]] had made famous before their 1996 departure from the WWF. McMahon assured him that nothing of the sort would happen. Despite this, on the night after the Montreal Screwjob on ''Monday Night Raw'', D-Generation X performed a segment mockingly re-enacting the match between Michaels and Hart, with a [[dwarfism|midget]] dressed as Bret.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;

==Title transition==
[[File:Vince McMahon 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vince McMahon]]]]
Hart's imminent move to WCW created a tense situation, as he had won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam 1997]] from [[The Undertaker]]. Hart's WCW contract was scheduled to begin on December 5, one month after the WWF's annual Survivor Series event, which was to be held in Montreal.&lt;ref name="MF1"/&gt; Shawn Michaels, the leader of the emerging [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]] [[D-Generation X]] had been booked into a main event title match with Hart. McMahon, anxious for Hart to give up the title, sought Hart's consent to [[Job (professional wrestling)|job]] to Michaels. Hart didn't want to give up the title to a member of [[The Kliq]] (which included Michaels, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, [[Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] and [[Sean Waltman]]), apparently standing up for the rest of the locker room. As part of their rivalry storyline, Michaels had repeatedly performed acts insulting the [[Flag of Canada|Canadian flag]] and Canadian fans, which had also upset Hart. Wrestling fans also knew of Hart's long-standing personal difficulty with Michaels—Hart had been angered at Michaels' forfeiture of the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in February 1997, which ruined plans for a Hart–Michaels rematch at [[WrestleMania 13]] where Michaels was expected to lose the title to him.&lt;ref name="MF1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mick Foley|authorlink=Mick Foley|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|page=625|year=2000|publisher=Regan Books|isbn=978-0-06-103101-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart also believed that Michaels had faked a knee injury and talked about major surgery just to get out of their planned match.&lt;ref name="SM6"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels &amp; Aaron Feigenbaum| title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=240|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PWT"&gt;{{cite web|title=An interview with Bret Hart |archivedate=2006-12-03 |accessdate=2007-02-22 |url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/25/17464 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061203042631/http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/25/17464 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Michaels denied rumors that he did not want to lose to Hart, and indeed Hart wound up winning the title shortly after Michaels relinquished it,&lt;ref name="SM2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels &amp; Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=176|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart felt certain that Michaels would not have offered a loss in return if he had been staying with the WWF.&lt;ref name="WCW"&gt;{{cite book|first=R.D.|last=Reynolds|author2=Bryan Alvarez|title=The Death of WCW|page=108|year=2004|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-661-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two had been involved in a real fight after Michaels implied that Hart was having an affair with WWF [[Manager (professional wrestling)|valet]] [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Sunny]].&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; The recent storyline rivalry had also seen Michaels make insulting remarks about Hart's father [[Stu Hart]], which had left Bret and others in the Hart family upset.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt; McMahon's offering of an estimated $3 million contract to Hart in 1996 had reportedly also upset Michaels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Shawn|last=Michaels|authorlink=Shawn Michaels|author2=Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=241|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMahon remained insistent about Hart dropping the title. The WWF owner was anxious over Hart pulling a move like that of former employee [[Debrah Miceli]]. Miceli, a veteran women's wrestler who has competed under the name Madusa for most of her career, performed as Alundra Blayze in the WWF in 1993 and 1995 and won the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956–2010)|Women's Championship]] during her stay there. McMahon, however, had neglected to renew her contract when it expired and Miceli signed with WCW where she changed her ring name back to Madusa. When she made her first appearance on ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'', Madusa made fun of her time in the WWF and brought her title belt with her to the program, dumping it into a trash can. McMahon feared a repeat, despite claims from Bischoff (according to Hart's DVD biography)&lt;ref name="dvd"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000AOEPU2|title=WWE: Bret "Hitman" Hart - The Best There Is, The Best There Was, The Best There Ever Will Be|date=3 May 2011|publisher=|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; that legal issues between the WWF and WCW would prevent such a thing, and that he would rather have Hart join WCW with a "clean slate". Hart continued to refuse to drop the title to Michaels, offering to lose the title anywhere in the United States prior to ''Survivor Series'' or to surrender the title to McMahon on the episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' the day after ''Survivor Series'', in [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WCW" /&gt; After several disagreements, McMahon, Michaels and Hart agreed to a proposal of a disqualification finish, which would be the result of a brawl between Hart's allies [[Owen Hart]], [[Jim Neidhart]], and [[Davey Boy Smith]] with Michaels's allies [[Triple H]] and [[Chyna]], who would interfere in the match to aid Michaels.&lt;ref name="MF3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mick Foley|authorlink=Mick Foley|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|page=626|year=2000|publisher=Regan Books|isbn=978-0-06-103101-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart would then lose or forfeit the title at a later date, as he was not due to start in WCW until December. Hart also asked for and obtained McMahon's permission for an opportunity to explain his actions, his heel character, praise McMahon and the WWF and thus leave on good terms with the company and the fans.

At some point in the days leading up to Survivor Series, however, McMahon began to reconsider that decision. Word of Hart's impending departure from the company had leaked to fans and wrestling news sources. McMahon was worried that allowing Hart to remain champion after the match at ''Survivor Series'' would cause problems and reckoned that Bischoff was still prone to doing anything he could to get under McMahon's skin and McMahon thought he would be likely to mention the signing of Hart to WCW on ''Nitro'' the following night (something Bischoff said would not have happened under normal circumstances). Furthermore, Bischoff would have a one-hour head start on McMahon due to ''Nitro'' going on the air live at 8 PM, which would have been more than enough time to announce Hart's WCW arrival. Therefore, McMahon felt, he needed to find a way to get the title off of Hart.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WCW2"&gt;{{cite book|author=R.D. Reynolds, Bryan Alvarez|title=The Death of WCW|page=109|year=2004|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-661-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setup and execution==
[[File:Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania XXIV.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Shawn Michaels]]]]
On November 8, 1997, one day before Survivor Series, McMahon met with [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] and Michaels in a hotel room in Montreal and planned the screwjob.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt; It is unclear how many people knew of the impending screwjob, but McMahon's close aides [[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Sgt. Slaughter]] had been involved in the planning. Jim Ross has insisted that he did not know the screwjob would take place, although many, including various members of Hart's family, thought he was involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGS-kwPn6f4&amp;t=15s | title=Jim Ross shoots on Montreal screw job}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a radio interview, Ross also confirmed that Jerry Lawler also did not know that the screwjob would take place. Hart and Michaels had met with Pat Patterson to discuss the match setup and plan, during which Hart agreed to allow Michaels to put him into the Sharpshooter hold at a time when the referee would be unconscious, as Patterson suggested.&lt;ref name="SM3"&gt;{{cite book|first=Shawn|last=Michaels|author2=Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=273|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the match was planned to proceed thus: Hart would grab Michaels' foot and reverse the hold, putting him in the Sharpshooter. Michaels would submit to the hold, but the referee would still be unconscious. Hart would let go of the hold to try to revive the referee, but Michaels would hit Hart with his finisher, [[professional wrestling attacks#Superkick|Sweet Chin Music]], and make the pin. A second referee would then run to the ring with Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart, and Davey Boy Smith following close behind. The second referee would start the count, but Owen and Davey Boy would break the pin. The original referee would then recover and start to make the count, but Hart would kick out, setting up about five more minutes of brawling that would result in a disqualification.

In his 1998 [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows'', Hart said that his fears were largely assuaged because he was close friends with referee Earl Hebner and trusted him implicitly. Asked by Hart, Hebner swore by his children that he would never double-cross Hart and that he would rather quit his job than participate in a screwjob.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MVP"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Kleinberg and Adam Nudelman|title=Mysteries of Wrestling: Solved|year=2005|pages=73–74|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-685-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Michaels' account of the events in his 2005 autobiography, ''Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story'', Michaels himself informed Hebner of the plan only on Sunday evening, just as Survivor Series was about to commence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels &amp; Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=273|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicted what Hebner said on a 2003 edition of ''[[WWE Confidential]]'', claiming that he first knew of McMahon's plan only ten minutes before the match finished, and out of panic following the bell ringing, he ran out of the ring, through the crowd and remained in his hotel room for the night, refusing to speak to anyone.

Tensions and excitement were high as the wrestlers and officials congregated for Survivor Series. Hart was anxious over the match finish and had been warned of the prospect of a screwjob by his brother-in-law and Hart Foundation member Davey Boy Smith as well as [[Big Van Vader|Vader]], who had experienced similar situations while wrestling in Japan. They advised Hart to be alert, not lie on his back for too long, kick out from pinfall counts immediately so as to avoid a fast count, and not allow himself to be placed in submission holds.

[[File:Earlhebner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Earl Hebner]]]]
The [[Bell Centre|Molson Centre]] in Montreal was sold out, with more than 20,000 fans in attendance. Rumors of Hart's imminent departure from WWF had leaked and consequently heightened the fan interest in the match. The mixed signals and a war of words between Hart, McMahon, Michaels and WCW further heightened anticipation.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt; Emotions were also running high due to the Hart–Michaels rivalry and the "U.S. vs. Canada" storyline. While both men had been cordial with each other backstage, WWF officials ordered the deployment of a large number of company agents around the ring as a precaution if Hart decided to attack Michaels or McMahon in reaction to the double-cross. Highly unusual for any wrestling match, the deployment was explained on television as a necessary precaution in wake of the intense animosity between Hart's and Michaels' characters.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt; There was also some legitimate concern that Michaels could be attacked during the planned in-crowd brawl, by fans angered at his actions of demeaning the Canadian flag. Michaels' entrance was greeted by loud booing and upon entering the ring, he proceeded to rub the Canadian flag against his crotch, picked his nose with it and later humped it—Michaels maintains that this [[flag desecration]] was actually suggested by Hart as an effective way to draw heat and emotion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels &amp; Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=274|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The palpable anger of the fans was converted into raucous cheering as Hart entered the ring carrying the Canadian flag and wearing the championship belt. Hart, however, was visibly disturbed when segments of the crowd that were aware of his move to WCW jeered him with chants of "You sold out!" as the match progressed.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;

Once the match began, Hart and Michaels brought their performance outside the ring and into the crowd, while being followed by McMahon and WWF officials. As the climax of the match approached, the two wrestlers returned to the ring while WWF officials continued to order more personnel to ringside. Hart first became suspicious as to why Vince McMahon was not at the announcers' table to perform commentary, and why the on-screen commissioner Sgt. Slaughter was also standing at ringside with Vince McMahon. Nevertheless, the match continued. As planned, Michaels pushed Hebner in front of him as Hart jumped from the top [[turnbuckle]], sending all three men to the canvas. Michaels and Hart both got up, but Michaels performed a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Eye rake|rake]] on Hart's eye, sending Hart back to the mat. Michaels then proceeded to grab Hart's legs to execute the Sharpshooter maneuver. At this point, the match director was heard shouting instructions into his headset for Hebner to get up, but Hart did not notice anything amiss. [[Mike Chioda]], the referee who was supposed to run in after Hebner went down, began yelling back that Hebner was not supposed to be up yet. Pat Patterson reacted in a similar way, and Owen Hart and Davey Boy Smith, who were waiting for their cues to run in, remained backstage in a state of confusion. Michaels was then seen by many viewers as having glanced at Hebner as he put Hart in the sharpshooter, which some saw as proof that he was in on the scheme.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt; Contrary to their agreed plan, Michaels tightened the hold and refused to offer his own leg to Hart for the latter to break out of the hold.&lt;ref name="SM76"/&gt; At that moment, Hebner got to his feet, looked toward timekeeper Mark Yeaton, and shouted, "Ring the bell!" McMahon then elbowed Yeaton hard and yelled, "Ring the fucking bell!" Yeaton rang the bell just as Hart reached forward and grabbed Michaels' leg, which broke the hold and caused Michaels to fall.&lt;ref name="DM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MVP" /&gt; Michaels' theme music then began playing and the ring announcer declared him the winner and the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Hebner had already exited the ring and was on his way out of the arena. After an initial moment of shock, Hart got to his feet, approached the apron where McMahon was standing and spat directly in his face, while Michaels feigned confusion.&lt;ref name="MVP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SM76"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels &amp; Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=276|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels was ordered by McMahon to "pick up the damn belt and get the hell out of here!" Michaels left the arena with Brisco and Triple H and the broadcast signal cut off almost immediately after Michaels exited, with the last shot being a tight closeup of the Survivor Series logo above the entranceway.&lt;ref&gt;Survivor Series 1997 pay-per-view broadcast feed, originally aired 11-9-97&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon and most other WWF officials also quickly made their way backstage as an angry Hart smashed cameras, monitors, and ringside equipment.&lt;ref name = "ORS45"/&gt; Fans in attendance also began to vent their fury on McMahon and WWF officials; a few even heaped garbage on them and some who were close enough pushed Michaels as he hurried backstage. Owen Hart, Neidhart and Davey Boy came out to the ring and had a conversation with Bret calming him down. Hart proceeded to finger trace "W-C-W" and "I love you" to the cheering fans before returning backstage.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;

==Reactions==
While much of the live Montreal audience immediately understood what had happened and responded angrily, television viewers had been left largely confused as Jim Ross promptly wrapped up the event on commentary and Survivor Series went off the air four minutes ahead of schedule with the parting image of Michaels holding the belt aloft as he disappeared backstage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survivor Series screws the fans|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/nov10_wre1.html|author=Powell, John|work=Slam! Wrestling|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|date=1997-11-10|accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors and expressions of surprise and shock pervaded the [[Internet]] almost immediately after the match ended. Some observers considered it a creative and all-time great match finish.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt; Observers of professional wrestling speculated whether the entire episode would result in WCW becoming the dominant promotion in Canada, where a large majority of fans had remained loyal to WWF, especially as the Hart family was working with the company.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;

As seen on Hart's documentary, Hart proceeded to the dressing rooms and questioned Michaels, who pleaded that he knew nothing about what had taken place and was equally outraged.&lt;ref name="ORS45"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Fritz &amp; Christopher Murray| title=Between the Ropes: Wrestling's Greatest Triumphs and Failures|page=145|year=2006|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-726-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon locked himself in his office with Pat Patterson and other agents. Mark Calaway, known as [[The Undertaker]], furious with McMahon, banged on the door. McMahon opened and was told he had to apologize to Hart.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt; As recounted in Michaels' autobiography, he was told by McMahon not to say anything about the screwjob to anybody, because McMahon needed to have everyone think that it was only him involved. Michaels offered his assurance that he would not carry the title belt out the next day on ''Raw'' and would refuse to say anything derogatory about Hart.&lt;ref name="SM76"/&gt; Hart proceeded to the dressing room to shower and change after discovering that McMahon, Brisco, and Remus had locked themselves in McMahon's office. When McMahon went to Hart's dressing room and tried to explain himself, Hart angrily rebuffed him and warned him to leave immediately or risk being punched.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VM94"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shaun Assael &amp; Mike Mooneyham| title=Sex, Lies and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and World Wrestling Entertainment|year=2004|page=194|publisher=Three Rivers Press|isbn=978-1-4000-5143-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; An altercation ensued, with Hart giving McMahon a single punch, dropping him to the floor. Although Vince's son, [[Shane McMahon]], and Brisco struggled briefly with Hart and Davey Boy Smith, Hart told them to take McMahon and leave or risk similar consequences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite book|author=Shaun Assael &amp; Mike Mooneyham|title=Sex, Lies and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and World Wrestling Entertainment|year=2004|page=194|publisher=Three Rivers Press|isbn=978-1-4000-5143-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart angrily asked McMahon if he was going to screw him on the pay he was still owed, to which a groggy McMahon replied in the negative.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt; In the hallway outside the dressing rooms, Hart's then-wife Julie angrily confronted [[Triple H]] and others about the finish, but was escorted away by Owen Hart.&lt;ref name="SM3"/&gt; McMahon had a [[black eye]] and a sprained ankle, which according to Bret Hart, was a result of his punch lifting Vince off the floor and Vince [[Sprained ankle|rolling his ankle]] once he landed. However, McMahon and Brisco have since stated on WWE Confidential that Brisco accidentally stepped on Vince's foot, which as he tried to get back to his feet immediately sprained his ankle and sent him back to the floor, from which he suffered a concussion, and referred to Brisco's action as a 'comedy.' Michaels and Triple H were later confronted and assailed by angry fans outside the Molson Centre and in the lobby of their hotel.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels &amp; Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=277|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Jim Neidhart, Davey Boy Smith, and Owen Hart had flown out of Montreal with Bret, McMahon faced a major revolt in the WWF locker room. Most wrestlers were outraged at him and threatened to boycott ''Raw'' or leave the company altogether.&lt;ref name="MF9"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mick Foley|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|page=628|year=2000|publisher=Regan Books|isbn=978-0-06-103101-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon addressed a meeting in an effort to mollify the wrestlers who had been outraged that a WWF veteran had been double-crossed by McMahon—many feared for their own future and were suspicious of McMahon.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt; McMahon sought to explain that Hart had been disregarding the company's interests. By refusing to drop the title in Montreal, McMahon claimed Hart was jeopardizing the company's future by creating a potentially embarrassing situation that could affect its fortunes. The potential revolt was also quelled by Hart's counsel to wrestlers who asked him about boycotting ''Raw'' or leaving the company altogether. Hart advised them to fulfill their contractual obligations and not risk their own future over the episode.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt; Both [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Sunny]] and [[Mick Foley]] did not attend the next night's ''Raw'' show, but returned to work after that due to their contract stipulations.&lt;ref&gt;http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingBiosS/sytch-can.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MF9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WrestleCast_Mick"&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/podcasts/wrestling/article27297.ece|title=I shouldn't be saying this...|website=The Sun|host=[[The LilsBoys]]|date=2007-05-04|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart later commented in his autobiography that if Foley returned to WCW, he'd be committing career-suicide. [[Rick Rude]], who was working there briefly as a story line manager for Michaels and was a real life friend of Hart's, called WCW and informed [[Eric Bischoff]] of what had transpired, and also returned to WCW two days after the events in Montreal mostly due to his disgust over Hart's treatment. Rude appeared on both ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Raw is War]]'' and ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' on November 17, 1997. A mustached Rude appeared on ''Nitro'', which was live, and proceeded to criticize Michaels, DX, and the WWF, calling the company the "[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]" (a reference to Titan Enterprises, as WWF's parent company was then known, as the "sinking ship").&lt;ref name=oww&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrestler Profiles: Rick Rude|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/r/rick-rude.html|accessdate=2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; An hour later on ''Raw'' (which had been taped six days earlier), Rude then appeared with the full beard he'd been sporting during his return to the WWF.&lt;ref name=oww/&gt;&lt;ref name=main111&gt;{{cite book|title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s|last=Shields|first=Brian|isbn=1-4165-3257-9|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2006|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Hart family, only Owen continued to work with the company, being unable to terminate his contract.&lt;ref name="SM79"&gt;{{cite book |author=Shawn Michaels &amp; Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=279|year=2005| publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Owen and Bulldog staying in WWF|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/nov12_owen.html|work=[[Calgary Sun]]|publisher=Canadian Online Explorer|date=1997-11-12|author=Francis, Eric|accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the next night's ''Raw'' in Ottawa, Michaels appeared carrying the WWF title belt and performing a segment where he boasted before the audience of how he beat Hart with his own trademark move in his own country. McMahon gave a televised interview to commentator [[Jim Ross]], explaining his version of events and making the now-infamous statement "Vince McMahon didn't screw Bret Hart. I truly believe that Bret Hart... screwed Bret Hart."&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt; Michaels continued his mocking of Hart in the coming weeks, performed a skit badgering a midget dressed up as Hart.

As McMahon expected, WCW did address Hart and the aftermath of the screwjob on ''Nitro'' from the [[Mid-South Coliseum]] in Memphis that same night. [[Mike Tenay]] and [[Tony Schiavone]] strongly criticized McMahon and Michaels for their actions. The show started with Bischoff making reference to Hart's impending arrival in WCW and his punching McMahon in the face, and he then used his on-air persona as the mouthpiece for the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] to claim (kayfabe) that Hart was to join the nWo as soon as he could be signed to WCW. [[Hulk Hogan|Hollywood Hogan]], [[Kevin Nash]], [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]], and the rest of the nWo members stood with Canadian flags and sang the [[O Canada|Canadian national anthem]].&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;

WCW invoked the Screwjob again at [[Starrcade (1997)|Starrcade 1997]], as Hart prevented Hogan from leaving with the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]]. He claimed that the referee [[Nick Hamilton|Nick Patrick]] gave a fast count and that he would not allow [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] to be screwed.&lt;ref name="ORS30"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Fritz &amp; Christopher Murray|title=Between the Ropes: Wrestling's Greatest Triumphs and Failures|page=30|year=2006|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-726-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was what critics called an [[climax (narrative)#Anti-climax|anti-climax]] as most had expected Sting to win cleanly on skill alone. At [[Starrcade (1999)|Starrcade 1999]], the finish of the match between [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] and Hart was for guest referee [[Roddy Piper]] to "ring the bell" once Hart placed Goldberg in the Sharpshooter despite Goldberg not submitting.&lt;ref name="ORS"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Fritz &amp; Christopher Murray|title=Between the Ropes: Wrestling's Greatest Triumphs and Failures|page=43|year=2006|publisher=ECW Press| isbn=978-1-55022-726-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The "Montreal Screwjob" remains one of the most high-profile double-crosses in the history of professional wrestling and the first heavily publicized professional wrestling double-cross since [[Wendi Richter]] lost the WWF Women's Championship to a [[Lucha libre#Masks|masked]] [[The Fabulous Moolah|Fabulous Moolah]] following a money dispute on November 25, 1985. It is perhaps the most controversial match in the history of the WWF, with the effects of its outcome being felt for over a decade later due to its notoriety and the infamous legacy it left in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.wwe.com/subscriptions/wweclassics/payperviews/survivorseries/ |title=WWE: Subscriptions &gt; WWECLASSICS.com &gt; Pay-Per-View Matches &gt; Survivor Series |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027223647/http://www.wwe.com/subscriptions/wweclassics/payperviews/survivorseries/ |archivedate=2009-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart was ostracized by McMahon and later refused offers of induction to the WWF Hall of Fame. The Hart family expressed outrage with McMahon and WWF for their neglect and the lack of safety precautions that could have prevented Owen Hart's later accident and eventual death.&lt;ref name="VM"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shaun Assael &amp; Mike Mooneyham|title=Sex, Lies and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and World Wrestling Entertainment|year=2004|pages=218–19|publisher=Three Rivers Press|isbn=978-1-4000-5143-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary ''Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows'' included footage of McMahon's conversations with Hart in which he affirmed the planned disqualification finish and expressed determination for Hart to exit "the right way" and as amicably as possible—McMahon did not know that the conversation was being recorded. In the recordings, Hart refused to drop the title to Michaels.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

The Montreal Screwjob's impact defined later storylines and rivalries. The WWF successfully tapped fan outrage at McMahon over the incident by creating the persona of "Mr. McMahon" — an authoritarian and arrogant heel boss who imposed his own will and authority on rebellious characters such as [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]].&lt;ref name="MF633"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mick Foley|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|page=633|year=2000|publisher=Regan Books|isbn=978-0-06-103101-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the storylines, McMahon "screwed" such wrestlers in order to hand the title to the performer of his choice. The "Bret screwed Bret" line inspired [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|promos]] that McMahon made during his feud with Austin. At [[Unforgiven: In Your House]], McMahon sat at ringside, placed strategically near the timekeeper, during Austin's title defense against [[Mick Foley|Dude Love]], which caused Austin to allude to the Montreal Screwjob during a promotional interview. At [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series 1998]]—the first anniversary of the screwjob—McMahon's son Shane, a match referee, abandoned his on-screen rebellion against his father and allowed his father to screw Austin, by refusing to count Austin's pinfall against [[Mick Foley|Mankind]]. The McMahons then double-crossed Mankind in his main event title match against [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] later that night. Just as The Rock put the Sharpshooter hold on Mankind, McMahon called for the bell to be rung, even though Mankind did not submit. The Rock was declared the winner by submission and the new WWF Champion, fully re-enacting the Hart double-cross, this time with a switch between the respective face and heel characters.&lt;ref name="MF702"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mick Foley|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|page=702|year=2000|publisher=Regan Books|isbn=978-0-06-103101-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, professional wrestling storylines, including some storylines written by WWE, continue to refer to the screwjob whenever a title match ends under controversial circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwebreakingpoint/currentepisode/11460100/|title=WWE Breaking Point Results: Hell's Gate-crasher|first="Craig"|last="Tello"|date=2009-09-13|publisher=WWE.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution==
WWF eventually surpassed its arch-rival WCW. With its business steadily declining and a corporate takeover of its parent company ([[Time Warner]]) by [[America Online]], WCW was put up for sale and purchased by Vince McMahon in 2001, once again making WWF the single-largest wrestling company in North America. Bret Hart's entry into WCW had been hailed at the time as a major coup for the company, but it subsequently failed to utilize his popular appeal.&lt;ref name="MF648"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mick Foley|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|page=648|year=2000|publisher=Regan Books|isbn=978-0-06-103101-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart's active wrestling career ended in 2000 after he suffered a serious [[concussion]] during a match with Goldberg. After dropping the WWF title to Austin at [[WrestleMania XIV]] in 1998, Michaels was forced into retirement for four years due to a serious back injury. After a long period of rehabilitation, Michaels returned to the ring in 2002, and eventually retired in 2010 at [[WrestleMania 26]], losing a Streak vs. Career match to The Undertaker in the show's [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]], but came out of retirement eight years later in 2018.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

After weeks of speculation, WWE.com announced in late August 2005 that Hart and WWE had agreed to collaborate on a DVD project chronicling Hart's wrestling career. In subsequent interviews, Hart attributed his decision to his desire to be remembered for his storied career that spanned two decades.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.ign.com/articles/667/667878p1.html|title=Bret Hart interview|accessdate= 2007-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project, which had been given the working title of ''Screwed: The Bret Hart Story'', was renamed ''[[Bret "Hit Man" Hart: The Best There Is, the Best There Was, the Best There Ever Will Be]]''.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; In the 2005 DVD chronicling his career, both Hart and Bischoff denied that his holding the WWF title was a factor in WCW's desire to sign him. While McMahon claimed that there was mutual regret, Hart defended his actions and asserted that he stood by what he did. Hart was interviewed about the DVD and his career by [[Todd Grisham]] on the November 16, 2005 edition of ''Byte This!'', marking Hart's first appearance on WWE programming since the Montreal Screwjob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidepulse.com/2005/12/30/45537/ |title=WWE Byte This Report for December 28, 2005 |author= |date=December 30, 2005 |website=Insidepulse.com |publisher=Inside Pulse Wrestling |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2005/12/28/1371198.html |title=SLAM!

Hart's refusal to lose to Michaels in Montreal has been criticized by others such as [[Ric Flair]], who asserted that it was Hart's responsibility to drop the title belt of a company he was leaving&lt;ref name="Flair"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ric Flair|title=To Be The Man|page=239|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9181-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Flair himself was WCW champion when he left the company and signed with the WWF in 1991, even appearing on TV with the NWA/WCW belt, but also dropped the WWF Title to Hart on October 12, 1992 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan at a house show). Hart, however, maintains that he was prepared to lose the title anywhere and to anyone, except to Michaels in Canada given that, during 1997, his "Hitman" character had been built up as a great Canadian hero. As his contract with WWF did not expire for four more weeks, Hart asserts that there was plenty of time and several other opportunities for him to drop the title. Several accounts claim that McMahon had originally proposed that Hart drop the title at December's [[D-Generation X: In Your House|In Your House]] pay-per-view in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], or at January's [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]] in [[San Jose, California]].&lt;ref name="PWT" /&gt;

Although Michaels expressed happiness at Hart's 2006 induction into the Hall of Fame, the Hart–Michaels relationship remained laced with antagonism.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; Michaels criticized Hart's behavior and conduct during his days in WWF in his 2005 autobiography, comparing the Screwjob to a "mafia hit,"&lt;ref name="SM"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shawn Michaels &amp; Aaron Feigenbaum|title=Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|page=268|year=2005| publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-0-7434-9380-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hart has stated in his 2007 autobiography that he would "never forgive" Michaels.&lt;ref name="BH1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bret Hart|authorlink=Bret Hart|title=My Life in the Cartoon World of Professional Wrestling| page=448|year=2007|publisher=Random House Canada|isbn=0-307-35566-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews prior to the induction ceremony, Hart asserted that he would walk out from the ceremony if he saw Michaels anywhere on the [[WrestleMania 22]] weekend. Michaels decided to leave the Hall of Fame ceremony early to avoid a possible scene. Hart did not appear at the WrestleMania show in a mini-ceremony with the other inductees, explaining in an interview that he had never intended to attend or appear at the show.&lt;ref name="PWT" /&gt; Hart would later return to WWE television on the June 11, 2007 edition of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', where he appeared in a taped promo spot mocking Mr. McMahon's "appreciation night."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Monday Night Raw|episodelink=WWE Raw|network=[[USA Network]]|location=[[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]]|airdate=2007-06-11|series=WWF Television}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was able to reconcile to a degree with McMahon, Hart had never reconciled with Michaels. In a November 17, 2008 radio interview, Hart mocked Michaels' version of the incident, saying, "Shawn's this Christian today; and in his book, he wrote that Vince took a dive and that I never even hit him and I thought, 'This guy is such a liar'. I wonder what kind of Christian he is." Asked if he had seen or spoken to Michaels since 1997, Hart said, "No. And I hope I never do... for his sake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bret Hart on Wrestling Elite &amp; Hart comments on '97 SS|publisher=Wrestling Observer|first=Adam|last=Martin|date=2008-11-22|accessdate=2009-08-21|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news08/1227395950.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2009 Bret Hart stated in an interview with [[Sky Sports]] that he will forgive Michaels, if Shawn apologizes first, saying "For me I don't really have much issue with it anymore. If you asked me that up until probably about a year ago I'd have probably said something different. But I've cooled off a bit now. I don't want to carry it around anymore. If he wanted to apologize I would accept it. I'd move on but I wouldn't forget it." He also put over the Michaels-Undertaker match at [[WrestleMania XXV]], saying he was proud of both men's efforts and that despite his personal feelings towards Michaels, he always had the utmost respect for his abilities.&lt;ref name="sky"&gt;{{cite web|title= Full of Hart|publisher=SkySports.com|first=Rob|last=Dannatt|date=2009-04-27|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,14205_5223189,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Michaels has commended Hart's abilities, calling him a "sheer joy" to work with in the ring.&lt;ref name="OTR"&gt;{{cite episode |title= Off The Record|episodelink= |series=Off the Record |serieslink= |credits= |network= [[The Sports Network|TSN]]|airdate= 2003|season= |seriesno= |number= |minutes= 20}} Michaels discussing his matches at [[WrestleMania]]. ''The [[WrestleMania XII|hour with Bret]], is that number one?'' "If it's not number one it's one and a half for sure"... "I loved wrestling him, I really did. You could go out there and just have a wrestling match with him - it was a sheer joy to be in the ring with him." ''You used to watch him backstage and think, 'that guy is unbelievable', didn't you?'' "I did, yeah. I used to think: 'I'd like to be out there with him'."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bret Hart's WWE return===
[[File:Bret vs HBK Jan 4 2010.jpg|thumb|Hart and Michaels reconcile on the January 4, 2010 episode of ''WWE Raw''.]]
On the December 14, 2009 episode of ''Raw'', Vince McMahon came out to announce the nominees for Guest Host of the Year during the [[Slammy Award]]s. After announcing [[Bob Barker]] as the recipient of the award, McMahon asked guest host [[Dennis Miller]] who he would like to see as a ''Raw'' guest host. Miller said he would like to see his long-time favorite, Bret Hart. McMahon dismissed Miller's suggestion, reminding him that the last time Hart was in the WWE was when "Bret screwed Bret," and that he likely would have no interest in hosting the show. Miller then asked the audience if they would like to see Hart as a guest host, to applause, but McMahon simply walked away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/12142009/mainarticle/|title=Dennis, anyone?|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|first=Greg|last=Adkins|accessdate=2010-01-12|date=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 16, [[Dave Meltzer]] of the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'' reported that Hart had signed a four-month contract with WWE, and would debut as the guest host of ''Raw'' on January 4, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/wwe/5401.html|title=Bret Hart signs WWE contract|publisher=Lords of Pain|first=Michael|last=Bluth|date=2009-12-16|accessdate=2010-01-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201143830/http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/wwe/5401.html|archivedate=February 1, 2010}} {{Unreliable source?|failed=y|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 28, WWE.com confirmed that McMahon would be at ''Raw'' that night to address the rumors about Hart hosting the show. That night, McMahon confirmed that Hart will indeed be guest host on the January 4 episode of ''Raw''. A WWE.com article published shortly after the December 28 edition of ''Raw'' alluded to an "almost guaranteed encounter between the WWE Chairman and the Hit Man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/special/allspecialguesthosts/brethartreturns|title=The pink and black is back|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|first=Craig|last=Tellow|accessdate=2010-01-12|date=2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bret returned on the January 4, 2010 episode of ''Raw'', and promptly called out Michaels in order to bury the hatchet. Hart and Michaels then aired their grievances with one another while recognizing that their Ironman match at [[Wrestlemania XII]] ought to be the highlight of their relationship rather than the Montreal Screwjob. The pair shook hands and Michaels turned as if to deliver Sweet Chin Music, but instead chose to embrace Hart. While many cast doubts on the sincerity of their reconciliation, Hart has confirmed that it was indeed genuine, as did Michaels,&lt;ref name="baltimore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/wrestling/blog/2010/03/qa_with_shawn_michaels_1.html|title=Q&amp;A with Shawn Michaels|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|first=Kevin|last=Eck|accessdate= 2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acknowledged that he felt that Michaels changed as a person, for the better. Later in the night, a storyline between Hart and McMahon began with the two appearing to have their own reconciliation only to have McMahon subsequently kick Hart in the gut: in real life, Hart and McMahon have been on slight speaking terms since 2002, when McMahon called Hart during his recovery from a stroke.&lt;ref name="calgary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://calgaryherald.com/sports/Back+Ring/2425695/story.html |title=Back in the Ring: Hart seeks closure in comeback |work=[[Calgary Sun]] |first=Heath |last=McCoy |accessdate=2010-01-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329075131/http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/BACK%2BRING/2425695/story.html |archivedate=2010-03-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The feud culminated in an encounter at [[WrestleMania 26]], which saw Hart defeat McMahon in a match that involved the [[Hart family]].&lt;ref name="wm26"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wrestlemaniaxxvi/matches/13662452/results/|title=Bret screwed Vince|last=Tello|first=Craig|date=2010-03-28|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, Hart would continue to periodically work televised events for WWE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/05172010/|title=Without limits|last=Adkins|first=Greg|date=May 17, 2010|accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2010/08/15/15031141.html|title=Rumored return helps Team WWE fend off Nexus at SummerSlam|date=2010-08-15|last=Plummer|first=Dale|author2=Tylwalk, Nick|accessdate=2010-08-16|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart appeared on the September 10, 2012 episode of Raw at the Bell Centre in Montreal, marking his return for the first time to the same building where the Screwjob occurred, where he took part in an interview segment featuring [[John Cena]] and WWE Champion [[CM Punk]]. However, the episode was overshadowed by [[Jerry Lawler]]'s real on-air heart attack earlier in the evening, from which he eventually made a full recovery. He also briefly appeared during [[Royal Rumble (2013)|the 2013 Royal Rumble]], giving a pep talk to [[Alberto Del Rio]] before his World Heavyweight Champion title bout with [[Big Show]]. On the May 27, 2013 episode of Raw, it was named 'Bret Hart Appreciation Night'. Bret was pictured in the evening speaking to the likes of [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], [[Daniel Bryan]] and Cena among others. At the end of the show, Michaels and Lawler handed him a plaque commemorating his career. The following week, Bret took part in 'WWE Inbox', a webshow held by WWE on its [[YouTube]] channel where Bret answered fans' [[Twitter]] questions.

==Discrepancies==
===Different accounts of proclaimed proponents of the event===
In his 2005 autobiography ''Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story'', Michaels stated that it was [[Triple H]]'s idea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://prowrestling.about.com/od/thebiggestrivalries/a/shawnvsbret_2.htm | title=Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the sharpshooter spot had been suggested by Hart. "We were talking things through, and Bret came up with this spot where I get him in the Sharpshooter and then he reverses it by pulling on my leg".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Heartbreak &amp; Triumph:The Shawn Michaels Story|author=Shawn Michaels &amp; Aaron Feigenbaum|page=272|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books &amp; Pocket Books|isbn=978-1-4165-1686-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirectly corroborating this assertion is Hart's own testimony in his autobiography ''Hitman'', that "Pat Patterson told me that he thought it would be a heckuva spot to let Shawn put me in the Sharpshooter and then reverse it on him," which would indicate that Patterson had initially proposed the "Sharpshooter" spot to Bret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling|author=Bret Hart|page=455|year=2007|publisher=Random House Canada|isbn=978-0-307-35566-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the same work, Hart also states, "I found myself jostling with Jerry Brisco, who I would find out later was the one who had designed the whole Screwjob for Vince."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling|author=Bret Hart|page=459|year=2007|publisher=Random House Canada|isbn=978-0-307-35566-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding to this confusion, Vince Russo states in his book ''Forgiven'' that it was he who proposed the match's ending to McMahon: "'Vince - we're making this way too difficult,' I said. 'Why don't we just do this? During the course of the match, let's have a spot where Shawn puts Bret in his own hold - the Sharpshooter. As soon as Shawn clamps it on, have the referee call for the bell as if Bret quit...'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forgiven: One Man's Journey From Self Glorification To Sanctification|author=Vince Russo|page=220|year=2005|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=1-55022-704-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Cornette, in his 2010 YouShoot Shoot Interview, denies Russo's claims of originating the screwjob, stating that Russo was not part of the meetings planning the screwjob at any time, appeared totally oblivious as to what had occurred while watching the event on a television backstage, and had to have the entire concept of a 'screwjob' explained to him. Cornette also told how he suggested Vince and creative have [[Ken Shamrock]] "double-cross" Hart for the title – as Hart was reportedly willing to drop the belt to anyone except Michaels – therefore unwittingly introducing the concept of a screwjob to McMahon and co.

===Involvement of referee Earl Hebner===
In his book ''Heartbreak &amp; Triumph'', Michaels states "It was about seven o'clock when I walked into the locker room. There were only a few people in there and none were close to Earl. He was putting on his referee gear and I started to put my boots on. 'Earl, I need you to listen to me very carefully.' I was speaking very softly. 'We are doing a big swerve tonight. I am going to get Bret in the Sharpshooter and I need you to ring the bell.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|author=Shawn Michaels &amp; Aaron Feigenbaum|page=273|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books and Pocket Books|isbn=978-1-4165-1686-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hebner states that Brisco was the person to tell him of the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dvd|title=Shoot Interview with... Dave &amp; Earl Hebner|publisher=RF Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pat Patterson's involvement===
Michaels states in ''Heartbreak &amp; Triumph'' that during planning he was told "'This cannot be discussed with anyone. Pat can't know, nobody can know about this but the three of us right now'",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|author=Shawn Michaels &amp; Aaron Feigenbaum|page=266|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books &amp; Pocket Books|isbn=978-1-4165-1686-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We had the meeting, and as everyone was leaving, Vince asked me, Hunter, and Jerry Brisco, a longtime agent and close confidant of Vince's, to stay. We sat down and talked",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|author=Shawn Michaels &amp; Aaron Feigenbaum|pages=266–267|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books &amp; Pocket Books|isbn=978-1-4165-1686-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Pat was in the room with us, and he had no idea what was going to happen. He had a strong relationship with Bret. He wouldn't have done it, and Vince knew that. That's why he didn't tell Pat...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|author=Shawn Michaels &amp; Aaron Feigenbaum|page=273|year=2005|publisher=WWE Books &amp; Pocket Books|isbn=978-1-4165-1686-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Dave Meltzer's online account of events before, during, and after the Screwjob, he states "Vince McMahon held a meeting at the hotel with Jim Ross, Jim Cornette, Pat Patterson and Michaels. Reports are that at least two of the aforementioned names looked extremely uncomfortable leaving the meeting"&lt;ref name="100megsfree4.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/wwf/wwemontreal.htm|title=WWE "Montreal Screwjob" Story|publisher=Wrestling Information Archive|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624213018/http://www.100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/wwf/wwemontreal.htm|archivedate=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that Patterson may in fact have been in on the Screwjob. This is corroborated by a Pro Wrestling Torch article from November 15, 1997 by Wade Keller which states, "However, a two-hour meeting was held on the second floor of the Montreal Marriott on Saturday night with McMahon, Jim Ross, Pat Patterson, Jim Cornette, and Michaels. Bret was wrestling that night in Detroit. There is some belief that at this meeting McMahon proposed the idea of the finish to whoever of that group wasn't already in on it. Ross and Patterson entered the meeting in a good mood and when they were seen in the hotel lobby afterwards, were said to be irritable, forlorn, and shaken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McMahon double-crosses Bret in title match|first=Wade|last=Keller|publisher=''Pro Wrestling Torch''|accessdate=2012-03-08|date=2009-09-14|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Torch_Flashbacks_19/article_35302.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Hart states in ''Hitman'', that while conversing with Michaels: "I added, 'I also want you to know that I have no problem dropping the belt to you if that's what Vince wants.' He glared back at me. 'I appreciate that, but I want you to know that I'm not willing to do the same for you.' And then he left. Jim [Neidhart] snorted, 'I can't believe that he just said that.' There was no way I could ever drop the belt to him now: he'd just shown complete disrespect not only to me, but to the position of champion..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling|author=Bret Hart|page=448|year=2007|publisher=Random House Canada|isbn=978-0-307-35566-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exchange is confirmed in Dave Meltzer's account: "During the meeting, Hart told Michaels that he'd be happy to put him over at the end of the run, but Michaels told Hart flat-out that he wouldn't return the favor. Michaels and Hart spoke again on the subject on 10/12 in San Jose, when once again Michaels told Hart that he wasn't going to do a job for him."&lt;ref name="100megsfree4.com"/&gt; Additionally, in ''Forgiven'' Vince Russo stated, "Well - no surprise here - Bret refused to do the job (get pinned) for Shawn in Canada. Not because he was being unprofessional - but because according to Bret, Michaels had said that he wouldn't ''do business'' with him (the right thing for the company in the ring), due to the way he felt about him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forgiven: One Man's Journey From Self Glorification To Santification|author=Vince Russo|pages=218–219|year=2005|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=1-55022-704-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1850">'''Muhammadu Junaidu''' (1906 – 9 January 1997) was a [[Nigerian]] [[historian]], [[writer]] and one of the foremost scholars on [[Fulani]] history and the [[Sokoto Caliphate]]. He was also a [[vizier]] or Waziri of Sokoto and was noted as a prolific writer.

==Life==
He was born into an elite family, the Gidado family of Sokoto, which had produced a large number of viziers for the caliphate. As a youth, he was tutored by [[Islamic]] [[scholars]] and was gradually introduced to his family's advisory tradition. However, Junaidu was not tamed by the Sokoto environment and education, he wanted to learn more about other Islamic countries in [[Africa]]. He traveled to [[Sudan]], [[Senegal]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and a few other countries to study amongst other things their legal codes. After returning to Nigeria, he took to reading and writing, he wrote over 30 books, and over time was appointed Head of the [[Kadi School]] in 1942, a member of the [[Sultan]]'s council from 1948, and a legal adviser to the Northern house of Chiefs after Nigeria;'s independence.

He is remembered today as a respected guardian of materials on the Sokoto caliphate and having one of the largest archives of pre-twentieth century [[West African]] correspondence. He was both reformer and believer in culture. He tried to present a suitable bridge between change and tradition through critical analysis of past norms and values and placing beneficial values in concord with mainstream or reformist education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6029">The '''Navarrese Company''' ({{lang-es|Compañía navarra}}, {{lang-eu|Nafarroako konpainia}}) was a company of [[mercenary|mercenaries]], mostly from [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[Gascony]], which fought in [[Greece]] during the late 14th century and early 15th century, in the twilight of Frankish power in the dwindling remnant of the [[Latin Empire]]. "Navarrese Company" is an informal, modern, and somewhat inaccurate term for these soldiers.

==Origins==
The first Navarrese Company was formed to fight for [[Charles II of Navarre]] against [[Charles V of France]]. In 1366, after peace was made, the mercenaries were organised into a coherent company of soldiers under [[Louis, Count of Beaumont|Louis]], Count of [[Beaumont-le-Roger]] in his own right and [[Duke of Durazzo]] in right of his wife, [[Joanna, Duchess of Durazzo|Joanna]]. Louis was a brother of Charles of Navarre, who supported his endeavour to recapture lost [[Durazzo]] and the ''[[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|regnum Albaniae]]''. Charles of France likewise aided him with 50,000 [[ducats]]. 

In 1372, the Navarrese ranks began to swell through the recruiting techniques of [[Enguerrand VII de Coucy]], who was hired to form a force of 500 [[lance]]s and 500 mounted archers, mostly from Gascony. Though these soldiers were recruited for service in Albania, they were first organised in [[Naples]]. In 1375 and 1376, many men from Navarre began enlisting and travelled directly to Albania to join their countrymen. The enrollment lists for those years have been preserved in [[Pamplona]] and reveal the important presence of many engineers. The total number of men which left [[Tortosa]] between February 1375 and June 1376 was in the thousands. They were paid thirty gold Aragonese [[Florin (Italian coin)|florins]] a month. 

In 1376, Louis and the Navarrese captured Durazzo, thus reestablishing the ''regnum Albaniae''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[La conquista de Albania]]'' ("The Conquest of Albania") is a 1984 Spanish film about this episode, c.f. [https://akas.imdb.com/title/tt0085357/ IMDB].&lt;/ref&gt; Louis died that same year, leaving the Navarrese unemployed. They put themselves under at the command of the [[Peter IV of Aragon]] early in 1377 and were formed as four companies, commanded by four captains: the Gascon [[Mahiot of Coquerel]] and Pedro de la Saga and the Navarrese [[Juan de Urtubia]] and Guarro. 

[[File:Armoiries Achaïe.svg|thumb|150px|Coat of arms of the [[Principality of Achaea]]]]

==Morea==
The Navarrese entered [[Morea]] in the spring or early summer of 1378, some coming at the invitation of [[Gaucher of La Bastide]], the [[Hospitallers|Hospitaller]] [[prior]] of [[Toulouse]] and [[commandant]] in the [[Principality of Achaea]] and others probably at the bequest of [[Nerio I Acciaioli]]. Gaucher hired Mahiot and the remnant of the company for eight months during the captivity of the [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] [[Juan Fernández de Heredia]]. Meanwhile, Juan de Urtubia was in [[Corinth]] with a following of more than 100 soldiers. 

After leaving the service of the Hospital, the Company took up with [[James of Baux]], the latest claimant to Achaea. Indeed, Mahiot and the Navarrese governed the entire Morea under the auspices of James of Baux. In 1379, Urtubia with a large force invaded [[Boeotia]] and sacked [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]&amp;mdash;then under the control of the [[Catalan Company]]&amp;mdash;with the assistance of the archbishop of the city, [[Simon Atumano]]. At this point, the Navarrese Company takes on a different character. Some men who had served under Urtubia are with Mahiot in the Morea again. The Company organised itself as a viceregal power in Achaea under three captains: Mahiot, [[Pedro de San Superano]], and [[Berard de Varvassa]]. For the next two years, the Navarrese governed Achaea and often hired itself out to the Hospital. 

When James of Baux succeeded to the [[Latin Empire|imperial title of Constantinople]], the Navarrese leaders received imperial titles for upholding his rights in Achaea. When James died in 1383, the Navarrese were the reigning power in Frankish Greece and it fell to them the responsibility of reorganising the state and securing a new prince. While the Navarrese refused to recognise the heirs of James without proof which was too costly to provide, they remained in power in Achaea and were licensed by the barons of the realm to negotiate the treaty of 26 July 1387 with the [[Republic of Venice]]. In 1386, Pedro de San Superano succeeded Mahiot as the Company's leader.

'''Robert Neil MacGregor''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OM|AO|FSA|size=100%|sep=,}} (born 16 June 1946) is a British [[art historian]] and former museum director. He was the editor of the ''[[The Burlington Magazine|Burlington Magazine]]'' from 1981 to 1987, then Director of the [[National Gallery]], London, from 1987 to 2002, [[Director of the British Museum]] from 2002 to 2015,&lt;ref&gt;theguardian.com 8 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently the founding director of the [[Humboldt Forum]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="humboldt"&gt;[http://www.humboldtforum.com/en/pages/founding-directors/ Founding Directors]&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Biography==
Neil MacGregor was born in [[Glasgow]] to two doctors, Alexander and Anna MacGregor. He was educated at [[Glasgow Academy]] and then read modern languages at [[New College, Oxford]], where he is now an honorary fellow.

The period that followed was spent studying philosophy at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris (coinciding with the [[May 1968 events in France|events of May 1968]]), and as a law student at [[Edinburgh University]], where he received the Green Prize. Despite being called to the bar in 1972, MacGregor next decided to take an art history degree. The following year, on a [[Courtauld Institute of Art|Courtauld Institute]] ([[University of London]]) summer school in Bavaria, the Courtauld's director [[Anthony Blunt]] spotted MacGregor and persuaded him to take a master's degree under his supervision.&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;{{cite news

  | location   = London
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1975 to 1981, MacGregor taught History of Art and Architecture at the [[University of Reading]]. He left to assume the editorship of ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]''. He oversaw the transfer of the magazine from the [[The Thomson Corporation|Thomson Corporation]] to an independent and charitable status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]] |title=(Robert) Neil MacGregor |url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person.php?LinkID=mp59851 |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directorship of the National Gallery===
In 1987 MacGregor became director of the [[National Gallery]] in London. During his directorship, MacGregor presented three [[BBC]] television series on art: ''Painting the World'' in 1995, ''Making Masterpieces'', a behind-the-scenes tour of the National Gallery, in 1997 and ''Seeing Salvation'', on the representation of Jesus in western art, in 2000. He declined the offer of a knighthood in 1999, the first director of the National Gallery to do so.&lt;ref name="Campbell-Johnson"/&gt;

===Directorship of the British Museum===
MacGregor was made director of the [[British Museum]] in August 2002, at a time when that institution was £5 million in deficit. He has been lauded for his "diplomatic" approach to the post, though MacGregor rejects this description, stating that "diplomat is conventionally taken to mean the promotion of the interests of a particular state and that is not what we are about at all".&lt;ref name="Campbell-Johnson"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His tenure included many exhibitions that were more provocative than the museum had previously done or told stories from unique perspectives that were notably less Eurocentric than previous exhibits, including a project celebrating the [[Hajj]]. He similarly made comments that sparked debate, such as his claim that the ancient [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian empire]] was greater than [[Ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Jones, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/apr/08/neil-macgregor-british-museum-legacy-future-challenge Neil MacGregor saved the British Museum. It’s time to reinvent it again], the Guardian, 8 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, MacGregor presented a series on [[BBC Radio 4]] and the [[BBC World Service|World Service]] entitled ''[[A History of the World in 100 Objects]]'', based on objects from the British Museum's collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/july-dec11/100objects_11-07.html |title=The Story of Humanity Told Through '100 Objects' |author= |date=7 November 2011 |work=[[PBS NewsHour]] |publisher=[PBS] |accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From September 2010 to January 2011 the British Museum lent the ancient Persian [[Cyrus Cylinder]] to an exhibition in [[Tehran]]. This was seen by at least a million visitors by the Museum's estimation, more than any loan exhibition to the United Kingdom had attracted since the ''Treasures of Tutankhamun'' exhibition in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Holding his office during a period which has seen the [[Acropolis Museum]] constructed in Athens, he has consistently argued against returning the British Museum's controversially held sculptures from the [[Parthenon]] (the "[[Elgin Marbles]]") to Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/neil-macgregor-there-is-no-possibility-of-putting-the-elgin-marbles-back-0j2lpv5mff5|title=Neil MacGregor: ‘There is no possibility of putting the Elgin Marbles back’|newspaper=The Times|date=7 November 2014|accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A poll in 2014 suggested that more British people (37%) supported the marbles' restoration to Greece than opposed it (23%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/10/18/british-people-tend-want-elgin-marbles-returned/|title=British people tend to want Elgin marbles returned|newspaper=Yougov.co.uk|date=18 October 2014|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His predecessor as director [[David Mackenzie Wilson]] had also tried to justify the British Museum position during a live 1983 television encounter with Greek actress and Minister of Culture [[Melina Mercouri]], an encounter subsequently viewed as embarrassing for the British Museum.&lt;ref name="embarrassment"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-mercouri-tackled-britain-in-1983-battle-of-the-marbles-mq3ssxzfr9k |title=How Mercouri tackled Britain in 1983 battle of the Marbles |publisher=The Times of London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On his part, MacGregor has stated that it is the British Museum's duty to "preserve the universality of the marbles, and to protect them from being appropriated as a nationalistic political symbol"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

the Museum controversially rejected [[UNESCO]] mediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iemc-unesco.org/unesco-letter-to-british-government-for-the-return-of-parthenons-marbles/ |title=UNESCO Letter to British Government for the return of Parthenon's Marbles |publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UK has not written back to UNESCO Letter"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CLT/19_ICPRCP_Recommendations_en_final.pdf |title=UK has not written back to UNESCO Letter |publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In supporting his case for ownership of the Parthenon Marbles, MacGregor has had to argue exclusively in [[English language|English]], as he can neither read nor speak [[Greek language|Greek]].  In view of the increasing international pressures on Britain following [[Brexit]], and the activity of the
[[International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures]], it is unclear for how much longer MacGregor's rejection of the case for repatriation will be tenable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dw.com/en/greece-could-use-brexit-to-recover-stolen-parthenon-art/a-40038439 |title=Greece could use Brexit to recover stolen Parthenon art |publisher=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, after MacGregor's term as Director ended, British [[Labour party (UK)|Labour party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] vowed to repatriate the Marbles to [[Athens]], if necessary overriding the British Museum trustees:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As with anything stolen or taken from occupied or colonial possession – including artefacts looted from other countries in the past – we should be engaged in constructive talks with the Greek government about returning the sculptures."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/corbyn-return-elgin-marbles-greece-british-museum-a8381681.html |title=Corbyn vows to return Elgin Marbles to Greece if he becomes prime minister |publisher=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, MacGregor was appointed chairman of the World Collections programme, for training international curators at British museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition ''The First Emperor'', focussing on [[Qin Shi Huang]] and including a small number of his [[Terracotta Army|Terracotta Warriors]], was mounted in 2008 in the [[British Museum Reading Room]]. That year MacGregor was invited to succeed [[Philippe de Montebello]] as the Director of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York. He declined the offer as the Metropolitan charges its visitors for entry and is thus "not a public institution".&lt;ref name="Campbell-Johnson" /&gt;

As of 2015, MacGregor was paid a salary of between £190,000 and £194,999 by the British Museum, making him one of the 328 most highly paid people in the British public sector at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/492289/150K_senior_salaries.csv/preview|title=Senior officials 'high earners' salaries as at 30 September 2015 - GOV.UK|date=2015-12-17|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacGregor retired from the post in December 2015 and was succeeded in Spring 2016 by [[Hartwig Fischer]], director of the [[Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Le projet Humboldt-Forum (Berlin) (6087765939).jpg|thumb|The [[City Palace, Berlin]], future seat of the [[Humboldt Forum]]]]
On 8 April 2015, MacGregor announced his resignation as Director of the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://news.artnet.com/people/british-museum-director-neil-macgregor-resigns-286119| title = British Museum Director Neil MacGregor To Step Down at the End of the Year| author = Hili Perlson| date = 8 April 2015| accessdate = 12 January 2017| publisher = artnet.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced that MacGregor would become founding director and head of the management committee of the [[Humboldt Forum]] in [[Berlin]], and that he would make recommendations to the German government on how the future museum can draw on the resources of the Berlin collections to "become a place where different narratives of world cultures can be explored and debated".

'''Nikolaos Kasomoulis''' ({{lang-el|Νικόλαος Κασομούλης}}, 1795–1872) was a participant in the [[Greek Revolution of 1821]], and one of the main historical sources about it.

==Biography==
He was born either in the village of [[Pisoderi, Florina|Pisoderi]], whence his family hailed, or in [[Kozani]], and grew up in [[Siatista]]. His father Konstantinos was a merchant. As a youth, Nikolaos moved to [[Serres]] to expand the family business. There, in 1820, he joined the ''[[Filiki Etaireia]]''.&lt;ref name="Dimaras126"&gt;Konstantinos Dimaras, «Ενθυμήματα στρατιωτικά», in Σύμμικτα Α' Από την παιδεία στην λογοτεχνία, (ed. Alexis Politis), Σπουδαστήριο Νέου Ελληνισμού, Athens, 2000, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence]], Kasomoulis took part in the uprising in the region of [[Mount Olympus]] and [[Chalcidice]], where he co-operated with the chieftain [[Diamantis Nikolaou]]. His father, who in the meantime had moved to [[Naousa, Imathia|Naoussa]], was killed there during the sack of the town by the Ottomans in April 1822. Following the suppression of the revolution in Macedonia, Kasomoulis went to [[Thessaly]] with a band of men from Siatista, where he joined the forces of [[Nikolaos Stournaris]] and [[Georgios Karaiskakis]]. In 1826 he took part in the [[Third Siege of Missolonghi]], along with his brothers Dimitrios and Georgios. He composed the written decision for attempting a final sortie, and was responsible for coordinating the actions of the various detachments participating in the sortie. During the sortie, his brother Dimitrios was mortally wounded.

Kasomoulis occupied various military positions under Governor [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] and King [[Otto of Greece|Otto]]. In 1836, he participated in the suppression of the anti-Otto uprisings, during which his other brother, Georgios, was also killed. He received the rank of Colonel in the [[Royal Phalanx]], but is commonly known as a general, a rank he never held. At an advanced age he settled in [[Stylida]], where he died in 1872.

==Memoirs==
Kasmoulis is best known for his [[memoirs]] («Ενθυμήματα στρατιωτικά της Επαναστάσεως των Ελλήνων 1821-1833», "Military Memoirs of the Revolution of the Greeks 1821-1833"), originally written in 1832, and completed in 1842. In 1861, Kasomoulis completed them with a history of the [[Armatoloi]],&lt;ref name="Dimaras126"/&gt; marking the first attempt at a comprehensive treatment of the Greek Revolution and its historical causes.&lt;ref&gt;Konstantinos Dimaras, «Πρόδρομοι του Αγώνος», in Σύμμικτα Α' Από την παιδεία στην λογοτεχνία, (ed. Alexis Politis), Σπουδαστήριο Νέου Ελληνισμού, Athens, 2000, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; As a historical source, Kasomoulis' memoirs rank among the most important works for the study of the Greek Revolution.&lt;ref name="Dimaras127"&gt;Konstantinos Dimaras, «Ενθυμήματα στρατιωτικά», in Σύμμικτα Α' Από την παιδεία στην λογοτεχνία, (ed. Alexis Politis), Σπουδαστήριο Νέου Ελληνισμού, Athens, 2000, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Coming from a [[Baidya]] family, Majumdar was born in Khandarpara, [[Faridpur District|Faridpur]], [[Bengal Presidency]], [[British India]] (now in Bangladesh) on 4 December 1884, to Haladhara Majumdar and Bidhumukhi.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; In 1905, he passed his Entrance Examination from [[Ravenshaw College]], [[Cuttack]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; In 1907, he passed F.A. with first class scholarship from [[Surendranath College]] and joined [[Presidency College, Calcutta]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; Graduating in B.A.(Honours) and M.A. from Calcutta University in 1909 and 1911 respectively, he won the [[Premchand Roychand]] scholarship from the [[University of Calcutta]] for his research work in 1913.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

==Career==
Majumdar started his teaching career as a lecturer at Dacca Government Training College. Since 1914, he spent seven years as a professor of history at the University of Calcutta. He got his doctorate for his thesis "Corporate Life in Ancient India".&lt;ref&gt;[http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/majumdar/corporatelifeancientindia.pdf Corporate Life in Ancient India: Thesis]. ''mcmaster.ca''. Retrieved 17 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 he became professor of history in newly established [[University of Dacca]]. He also served, until he became its vice chancellor, as the head of the Department of History as well as the dean of the Faculty of Arts. Between 1924 and 1936 he was Provost of [[Jagannath Hall]]. Then he became the vice chancellor of that University, for five years from 1937 to 1942. From 1950, he was [[Dean (education)|Principal]] of the College of Indology, [[Benares Hindu University]]. He was elected the general president of the [[Indian History Congress]] and also became the vice president of the International Commission set up by the UNESCO for the history of mankind.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Works==
Majumdar started his research on ancient India. After extensive travels to Southeast Asia and research, he wrote detailed histories of Champa (1927), Suvarnadvipa (1929) and Kambuja Desa. On the initiative of [[Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Educational Trust|Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan]], he took up the mantle of editing a multi-volume tome on Indian history. Starting in 1951, he toiled for twenty six long years to describe the history of the Indian people from the Vedic Period to the present day in eleven volumes. In 1955, Majumdar establishes the College of Indology of [[Nagpur University]] and joined as principal. In 1958-59, he taught Indian history in the [[University of Chicago]] and [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He was also the president of the Asiatic Society (1966–68) and the [[Bangiya Sahitya Parishad]] (1968–69), also the [[Sheriff of Calcutta]] (1967–68).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

When the final volume of "[[The History and Culture of the Indian People]]" was published in 1977, he had turned eighty-eight. He also edited the three-volume history of Bengal published by Dacca University. His last book was "Jivaner Smritidvipe".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Views on the Indian independence movement==
When the [[Government of India]] set up an editorial Committee to author a history of the freedom struggle of India, he was its principal member. But, following a conflict with the then Education Minister [[Maulana Abul Kalam Azad]] on the [[Sepoy Mutiny]], he left the government job and published his own book. ''The Sepoy Mutiny &amp; Revolt of 1857''. According to him the origins of India's freedom struggle lie in the English-educated Indian middle-class and the freedom struggle started with the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Banga Bhanga]] movement in 1905. His views on the freedom struggle are found in his book ''History of the Freedom Movement in India''. He was an admirer of [[Swami Vivekananda]] and [[Ramakrishna Paramahamsa]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6360">In [[Historical linguistics|historical (or diachronic) linguistics]], '''subjectification''' (also known as '''subjectivization''' or '''subjectivisation''') is a [[language change]] process in which a linguistic expression acquires meanings that convey the speaker's attitude or viewpoint. This is a pragmatic-semantic process, which means that inherent as well as contextual meanings of the given expression are considered. Subjectification is realized in [[Lexical semantics|lexical]] and grammatical change. It is also of interest to [[cognitive linguistics]] and [[pragmatics]] (cf. [[Ronald Langacker]] and [[Elizabeth Traugott]]).

== Subjectivity in language ==
From a [[Synchrony and diachrony|synchronic]] perspective, subjectivity can be expressed in language in many ways. First of all, the subject is implied in discourse through any [[speech act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language--the Unknown: An Initiation into Linguistics|last=Kristeva|first=Julia|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjectivity can also be expressed in many grammatical categories, such as [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Valency (linguistics)|valence]], [[Tense-aspect-mood|tense, aspect, mood]], [[Evidentiality|evidentials]], and [[Deixis|deictic expressions]] more generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language typology and syntactic description: Grammatical categories and the lexicon|last=Talmy|first=Leonard|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|isbn=|editor-last=Shopen|editor-first=Timothy|volume=3|location=Cambridge|pages=57–149|chapter=Lexicalization patterns: Semantic structure in lexical forms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subjectification and intersubjectification ==
The most prominent research on subjectification to date comes from linguists [[Elizabeth Traugott]] and [[Ronald Langacker]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Subjectification, Intersubjectification and Grammaticalization|last=Traugott|first=Elizabeth Closs|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2010|isbn=|editor-last=Davidse|editor-first=Kristin|location=Berlin/New York|pages=39|chapter=(Inter)subjectivity and (inter)subjectification: A reassessment}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Traugott's view, subjectification is a [[Semasiology|semasiological]] process in which a linguistic element's "meanings tend to become increasingly based in the speaker's subjective belief state/attitude toward the proposition".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Traugott|first=Elizabeth Closs|year=1989|title=On the Rise of Epistemic Meanings in English: An Example of Subjectification in Semantic Change|url=|journal=Language|pages=46–47|doi=10.2307/414841|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Langacker's standpoint, "an expression's meaning always comprises both subjectively and objectively construed elements, and it is individual conceptual elements within an expression's meaning that, over time, may come to be construed with a greater degree of subjectivity or objectivity".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Traugott also discusses "intersubjectification", alternatively calling subjectivity "(inter)subjectivity" and subjectification "(inter)subjectification". She writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In my view, subjectification and intersubjectification are the mechanisms by which:&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* &lt;blockquote&gt;a. meanings are recruited by the speaker to encode and regulate attitudes and beliefs (subjectification), and,  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
* &lt;blockquote&gt;b. once subjectified, may be recruited to encode meanings centred on the addressee (intersubjectification).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Subjectification occurs in conversation (through [[speech act]]s and has rhetorical aims, and thus implies some degree of intersubjectivity. Intersubjectification does so more blatantly through its "development of meanings that explicitly reveal incipient design: the designing of utterances for an intended audience...at the discourse level" and requires subjectification to occur in the first place.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Traugott and Dasher schematize the process of subjectification elsewhere in the following [[Cline of instantiation|cline]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;non-subjective   &gt;   subjective   &gt;   intersubjective&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Regularity in Semantic Change|last=Traugott|first=Elizabeth C.|last2=Dasher|first2=Richard B.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;   &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Grammaticalization ==

[[Grammaticalization]] is an associated process of language change in which "lexical items and constructions come in certain linguistic contexts to serve grammatical functions, and once grammaticalized, continue to develop new grammatical functions".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Grammaticalization|last=Hopper|first=Paul J.|last2=Traugott|first2=Elizabeth C.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The processes of subjectification and intersubjectification do not necessarily result in [[grammaticalization]], but there is still a strong correlation between the two.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As shown in the cline above, subjectification is theorized to be a unidirectional process; in other words, meanings tend to follow the path from left to right and do not develop in the reverse direction. Grammaticalization is likewise suggested to be a unidirectional phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Example ==

Traugott proposes that the epistemic adverb ''evidently'', which initially meant 'from evidence, clearly' and later developed into a subjective adverb, underwent subjectification:
* "1429 Will Braybroke in Ess.AST 5: 298 ''Yif thay finde euidently that i haue doon extorcion''
** 'If they find from evidence that I have performed extortions' (''MED'')
* 1443 Pecock Rule 56: ''More euydently fals þan þis is, þer is no þing''
** 'There is nothing more clearly false than this' (''MED'')
* 1690 Locke, Hum. Und. II. xxix: ''No Idea, therefore, can be undistinguishable from another ... for from all other, it is evidently different'' ('evident to all', weak subjective epistemic) (''OED'')
* 20th c.?: ''He is evidently right'' (in the meaning 'I conclude that he is right'; strong subjective epistemic inviting the inference of some concession or doubt on speaker's part)"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7530">The '''Sykes Bleaching Company''' was a [[cotton]] [[bleaching]] business established in [[Edgeley]], near [[Stockport]] in 1792 which grew to become one of the largest bleaching enterprises in the United Kingdom.

==Origins==
The bleaching business was established in 1792 by William Sykes. Sykes had been born at [[Wakefield]] and had been active in the cloth industry at [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] and [[Manchester]].  On 27 November 1792 an advertisement appeared in the Manchester Mercury to let land at [[Edgeley]], [[Stockport]], [[Cheshire]] as
  
&lt;blockquote&gt;An Eligible situation for Bleach Ground or Print Field in which there are a number of Fine White Sand Springs with a Rivulet capable of Turning Wash Wheels etc.  The Grounds lie very contiguous to the populous Manufacturing Town of Stockport where Bleachers and Printers are both much wanted and every encouragement will be given to a good tenant&lt;/blockquote&gt;

William Sykes took the land, first renting, but later purchasing it, and built a bleach works. To bleach cloth, it was repeatedly steeped in natural alkaline solutions derived from ash, called "bucking". It was then washed and exposed to  sun and air by being hung out in the [[bleachfield]]s (known as "crofts").  After being immersed in [[buttermilk]], called ‘souring’ it received final washing, stretching and drying. The process could take up to eight months and with cloth in the open, a  watchman was employed to guard Sykes crofts at night. Theft of cloth from a croft was an offence liable to capital punishment. [[Handloom]] weavers from Edgeley, Stockport, [[Adswood]], [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]] and [[Cheadle Hulme]] brought cloth to the works for bleaching and these were sold on to Manchester and London merchants. An early list of Sykes customers includes well-known names as Oldknow of Nottingham, Radcliffe of Stockport (a pioneer of the fine muslin industry) and Cadbury of Birmingham, a silk mercer and father of the founder of the well-known chocolate firm. The list also mentions names of customers as far afield as [[Boston, Massachusetts]] America and [[Messina]] Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://interactive.stockport.gov.uk/Heritage/Astle's%20History%20of%20Stockport/00000161.pdf Stockport Advertiser History of Stockport Chapter IX p103]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Sykes settled in Stockport, there were few trees in the area. As wood was needed in the drying process, he undertook extensive tree-planting  on land which later became public property in Alexandra Park. He built a "stately house" Edgeley House, which was the home of the family for succeeding generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stockport.gov.uk/2013/2978/8803/9020/12299/alexparkapp Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council Alexandra Park, Edgeley] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115230218/http://www.stockport.gov.uk/2013/2978/8803/9020/12299/alexparkapp |date=2010-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The works were originally driven by water power, but in 1803 the works was provided with a 12 horse-power steam engine. By 1804 new chemical methods had been introduced using [[calcium hypochlorite]] which eliminated the need for grassing the cloth in the fields but required more water.

==Expansion==
[[Image:Sunset over Sykes' Reservoir.JPG|thumb|right|Sunset over Sykes' Reservoir, January 2006.]]
Edmund Sykes succeeded his father in the business some time before 1809. In 1812, [[Luddite]] demonstrators attacked the works and threatened the Sykes family in their home until they were dispersed by the militia. Edmund Sykes employed Pickfords and other proprietors of stage-wagons to distribute the wares. In 1820, Edmund's younger brother Richard joined the business which was then carried on under the name of E &amp; R Sykes. In 1828 Edmund Sykes retired from the business and went to live at [[Mansfield Woodhouse]], Nottinghamshire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://interactive.stockport.gov.uk/Heritage/Astle's%20History%20of%20Stockport/00000162.pdf Stockport Advertiser History of Stockport Chapter IX p104]&lt;/ref&gt; Under Richard Sykes' ownership, the business at Edgeley developed rapidly and every effort was made to modernise the plant. Wells were sunk including the "Silver Well" was sunk, and by 1830 these had quadrupled the water supply.  Reservoirs were also built. These undertakings were of great value to people in the area in times of excessive drought. Richard Sykes also took a keen interest in public affairs. He was Justice of the Peace for Cheshire, Alderman for Stockport, and Mayor in 1850-1851. He was an active member of the Society of Bleachers. Sykes and Co were interested in the use of science in the bleaching industry, and their books include exhaustive tests made by them comparing different manufacturer's bleach. They also employed [[John Dalton]], the chemist, as consultant on the quality of their water supply. Richard Sykes died in 1876 and his son [[Thomas Hardcastle Sykes]] succeeded to the business, undertaking speculative ventures at home and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://interactive.stockport.gov.uk/Heritage/Astle's%20History%20of%20Stockport/00000163.pdf Stockport Advertiser History of Stockport Chapter IX p105]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bleachers Association==

Sykes became a limited liability company in 1892 but management remained in the family including Thomas Sykes' son, [[Alan Sykes|Alan]], known as Jack. However, there was severe internal competition within the bleaching trade, which discouraged long-term investment, so the business did not develop the technical and scientific knowledge as much as foreign. As a result, the Bleacher's Association was created in June 1900, amalgamating around 60 businesses in bleaching and finishing of cotton goods. These were mainly in Lancashire to exploit the monopoly of water supply, but included some in Scotland and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=prgcdgcNgCMC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=%22Bleachers+Association%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AC1vj8FvmS&amp;sig=eUg7U1EC8AjYQYUybVXiM3gZlQw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UBApSpbUCsfRjAfFwazmCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#PPA144,M1 David Hutchison Macgregor, Mark Casson, Henry William Macrosty, George Reginald Carter ''Rise of Big Business'' 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;  Jack Sykes became one of its original directors together with his cousin Frank Sykes, the son of Edmund. After the retirement of Thomas Sykes, Jack continued the management of the Edgeley works following the longer-term interests of the Association, through a cautious financial policy. After its formation, the Bleacher's Association continued to buy up its competitors and to make trade-sharing agreements with the Calico Printers and Bradford Dyers. Between 1901 and 1910 nine works were purchased and a further 21 works were purchased after World War I. The Association opened its new headquarters, Blackfriars House, in 1926, and its silver jubilee was commemorated by the publication of Jack Sykes's "Concerning the Bleaching Industry".&lt;ref&gt;Alan J Sykes ''Concerning the Bleaching Industry'' Bleachers Association 1925&lt;/ref&gt; However the success of the Bleacher's Association, in maintaining high profits on a declining volume of trade, could not last. Prices were reduced in 1928 and from then on trade was severely restricted by the long term decline in export of British textiles.

'''''Theristai''''' ({{lang-grc|Θερισταί}}, also known as ''Reapers'' or ''Harvesters''), is a lost [[satyr play]] by [[Athens|Attic]] playwright Euripides.

The '''Thiepval Barracks bombing''' was a double [[car bomb]] attack carried out by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) on 7 October 1996. The bombs exploded inside [[Thiepval Barracks]], the [[British Army]] headquarters in [[Northern Ireland]]. One British soldier was killed and 31 people were injured. This bombing was the first major attack on a military base in Northern Ireland since the ending of the IRA's ceasefire on 9 February 1996, [[1996 Docklands bombing|when it exploded a large bomb in London's Docklands]].

== Background ==

The Provisional IRA ended its 1994 ceasefire on 9 February 1996, when a massive truck bomb went off in the [[London Docklands]] area, resulting in two deaths and causing huge damage, especially around the [[South Quay]] railway station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1996/02/10/1996-02-10_blast_shatters_london__adams.html | title=Blast shatters London, Adams Presumes IRA's Responsible | first=Ellen | last=Tumposky | work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | publisher= | date=10 February 1996 | accessdate=29 January 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912002136/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1996/02/10/1996-02-10_blast_shatters_london__adams.html | archivedate=12 September 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRA strategy was to pressure the British government by bombing England, but without rejecting the peace process&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, Thomas (2010) ''Ireland: A History''.

== Aftermath ==

[[Sinn Féin]] leader [[Gerry Adams]] was reluctant to confirm whether or not the IRA was involved, and vowed for talks with the British government and the [[Ulster unionism|unionist]] parties. He warned however that "There has been a protracted political vacuum here. If we don't fill that vacuum with real talks then it will be filled with the sort of serious incidents we saw yesterday".

[[John Bruton]], then [[Taoiseach]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]], called the bombing a "cynical betrayal of the peace process" by the IRA,&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; while PUP leader [[David Ervine]] appealed to loyalists not to seek retaliation for the bombing.&lt;ref name=blame/&gt; [[John Major]], the British prime minister, made clear that "the IRA would not bomb its way into the Stormont talks".&lt;ref name=cain/&gt;

The attack was seen as a confirmation that the IRA had given up any hope of achieving a political breakthrough until the next British general elections in 1997.&lt;ref name=blame/&gt;

The [[timeline]] of '''[[luminiferous aether]]''' (light-bearing aether) or '''ether'''  as a [[Transmission medium|medium]] for propagating [[electromagnetic radiation]] begins in the 18th century. The '''aether''' was assumed to exist for much of the 19th century—until the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] returned its famous null result. Further [[experiment]]s were in general agreement with Michelson and Morley's result. By the 1920s, most scientists rejected the aether's existence.

==Timeline==

===Early experiments===
: 4th-century BC – [[Aristotle]] publishes ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', in which the aether is briefly described as being an element lighter than air that surrounds celestial bodies. He describes the aether in relation to other [[Classical element|elements]] - aether is lighter than air and is located above it, whereas air is lighter than water, and water is lighter than earth. In Aristotle's view, each element returns to its proper place when displaced, which explains why air rises, why earth and water fall, and why the heavens remain in place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.mb.txt "Physics by Aristotle"] Translated by R. P. Hardie and R. K. Gaye. The Internet Classics Archive&lt;/ref&gt;
: 1704 – [[Isaac Newton]] publishes ''[[Opticks]]'', in which he proposes a [[particle theory of light]]. This had trouble explaining [[diffraction]], so he adds a "fudge factor," claiming that an "Aethereal Medium" is responsible for this effect, and going further to suggest it might be responsible for other physical effects such as [[heat]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
: 1727 – [[James Bradley]] measures [[stellar aberration]] for the first time, proving (again) that light has a finite speed as well as that the Earth is moving.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
: 1818 – [[Augustin Fresnel]] introduces the [[Wave-particle duality|wave theory of light]], which proposes light is a transverse wave travelling in an aether, thereby explaining how [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] can exist. It is important to note that both Newton's particle theory and Fresnel's wave theory both assume an aether exists, albeit for different reasons. From this point on, no one even seems to question its existence.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
: 1820 – Discovery of [[Siméon Poisson]]'s "Bright Spot", supporting the Wave Theory.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
: 1830 – Fresnel develops a formula for predicting and measuring aether dragging by massive objects, based on a coupling constant. Such dragging seems to be at odds with aberration however, which would require the Earth ''not'' to drag the aether in order to be visible.
:: [[George Gabriel Stokes]] becomes a champion of the dragging theory.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
: 1851 – [[Armand Fizeau]] carries out his famous experiment with light travelling through moving water. He measures fringing due to motion of the water, perfectly in line with Fresnel's formula. However he sees no effect due to the motion of the Earth, although he does not comment on this. Nevertheless this is seen as very strong evidence for aether dragging.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
: 1868 – [[Martinus Hoek]] carries out an improved version of Fizeau's using an [[interferometer]] experiment with one arm in water. He sees no effect at all, and cannot offer an explanation as to why his experiment is so at odds with Fizeau's.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
: 1871 – [[George Biddell Airy]] re-runs Bradley's experiment with a telescope filled with water. He too sees no effect. It appears that aether is ''not'' dragged by mass.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
: 1873 – [[James Clerk Maxwell]] publishes his ''[[Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
: 1879 – Maxwell suggests absolute velocity of Earth in aether may be optically detectable.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
: 1881 – [[Albert Abraham Michelson]] publishes his first interferometer experiments, using the device for the measurement of extremely small distances.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  To Michelson's dismay, his experiment finds no "ether drag" slowing light, as had been suggested by Fresnel.
:: [[Hendrik Antoon Lorentz]] finds Michelson's calculation have errors (i.e., doubling of the expected fringe shift error).
: 1882 – Michelson acknowledges his interpretation errors.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Crisis===
: 1887 – the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] (MMX) produces the famous null result. A small drift is seen, but it is too small to support any "fixed" aether theory, and is so small that it might be due to experimental error.
:: Many physicists dust off Stokes' work, and dragging becomes the "standard solution"
: 1887 to 1888 – [[Heinrich Hertz]] verifies the existence of electromagnetic waves.
: 1889 – [[George FitzGerald]] proposes the Contraction Hypothesis, which suggests that the measurements are null due to changes in the length in the direction of travel through the aether.
: 1892 – [[Oliver Lodge]] demonstrates that aether drag is invisible around rapidly moving celestial bodies.
: 1895 – Lorentz proposes independently the Contraction Hypothesis.
: 1902 to 1904 – Morley and Morley conduct a number of MM experiments with a 100 ft interferometer, producing the null result.
: 1902 to 1904 – [[Lord Rayleigh]] and [[DeWitt Bristol Brace]] found no signs of double refraction (due to FitzGerald–Lorentz Contraction) of moving bodies in the aether.
: 1903 – the [[Trouton–Noble experiment]], based on an entirely different concept using electrical forces, also produces the null result 
: 1905 – Miller and Morley's experiment data is published. Test of the Contraction Hypothesis has negative results. Test for aether dragging effects produces null result.
: 1908 – the [[Trouton–Rankine experiment]], another experiment based on electrical effects, does not detect the FitzGerald–Lorentz Contraction.

===Change===
: 1904 – [[Hendrik Lorentz]] publishes a new theory of moving bodies, without discarding the stationary (electromagnetic) ether concept.
: 1905 – [[Henri Poincaré]] shows that Lorentz's theory fulfills the principle of relativity, and publishes the Lorentz transformations. His model was still based on Lorentz's ether, but he argues that this aether is perfectly undetectable.
: 1905 – [[Albert Einstein]] publishes an [[Observational equivalence|observationally equivalent]] theory, but complete with a derivation from principles alone (leaving the ether aside). Einstein also emphasized that this concept implies the relativity of space and time. He later labelled it [[special relativity]].
: 1908 – [[Trouton–Rankine experiment]] shows that [[length contraction]] of an object according to one frame does not produce a measurable change of resistance in the object's rest frame
: 1913 – [[Georges Sagnac]] uses a rotating MMX device and receives a clearly positive result. The so-called [[Sagnac effect]] was considered excellent evidence for aether at the time, but was later explained via [[general relativity]]. Good explanations based on SR also exist.
: 1914 – [[Walther Zurhellen]] uses observations of binary stars to determine if the speed of light is dependent on movement of the source. His measurements show that it is not to 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;. This is claimed to be additional evidence against aether dragging.
: 1915 – Einstein publishes on the [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]].
: 1919 – [[Arthur Eddington]]'s Africa eclipse expedition is conducted and appears to confirm the general theory of relativity.
: 1920 – Einstein says that special relativity does not require rejecting the aether, and that the gravitational field of general relativity may be called aether, to which no state of motion can be attributed.
: 1921 – [[Dayton Miller]] conducts aether drift experiments at [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]]. Miller performs tests with insulated and non-magnetic interferometers and obtains positive results.
: 1921 to 1924 – Miller conducts extensive tests under controlled conditions at [[Case University]].
: 1924 – Miller repeats his experiments at Mount Wilson and yields a positive result.
:: [[Rudolf Tomaschek]] uses stars for his interferometer light source, getting the null result.
: 1925 – the [[Michelson–Gale–Pearson experiment]] produces a positive result while attempting to detect the effect of Earth's rotation on the velocity of light. The significance of the experiment remains debated to this day, but this planetary Sagnac effect is measured by ring laser gyros and taken into account by the GPS system.
: 1925 April – Meeting of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].
:: [[Arthur Compton]] explains the problems with the Stokes aether drag solution.
:: Miller presents his positive results of the aether drag.
: 1925 December – [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] meeting.
:: Miller proposes two theories to account for the positive result. One consists of a modified aether theory, the other a slight departure from the Contraction Hypothesis.
: 1926 – [[Roy J. Kennedy]] produces a null result on Mount Wilson
:: [[Auguste Piccard]] and [[Ernest Stahel]] produce a null result on [[Mont Rigi]].
: 1927 – [[Mount Wilson conference]].
:: Miller talks of partial entrainment
:: Michelson talks about aether drag and altitude differential effects
:: [[K. K. Illingworth]] produces a null result using a clever version of the MMX with a step in one mirror that dramatically improves resolution. The resolution is so good that most partial entrainment systems can be eliminated.
: 1929 – Michelson and [[F. G. Pease]] perform the [[Pearson experiment]] and produce a null result.
: 1930 – [[Georg Joos]] produces a null result using an extremely accurate interferometer placed entirely in vacuum.
: 1932 – the [[Kennedy–Thorndike experiment]] uses an interferometer with arms of different lengths and not at right angles. They measure over several seasons and record on photographs to allow better post-measurement study. The Kennedy Thorndike experiment becomes one of the fundamental tests for SR, proving the independence of light speed wrt to the speed of the emitting source. The other two fundamental tests are [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] (proves light speed isotropy) and [[Ives–Stilwell experiment]] (proves time dilation)
: 1934 – [[Georg Joos]] publishes on the [[Michelson–Gale–Pearson experiment]], stating that it is improbable that aether would be entrained by translational motion and not by rotational motion.
: 1935 – [[Hammar experiment]] disproves aether entrainment
: 1951 – [[Paul Dirac]] writes that currently-accepted quantum field theory requires an aether, although he never formulated this theory completely.

===Debate slows===
: 1955 – [[R. S. Shankland]], [[S. W. McCuskey]], [[F. C. Leone]], and [[G. Kuerti]] performed an analysis of Miller's results and explained them as stemming from systematic errors (Shankland's explanation is now widely accepted).
: 1958 – Cedarholm, Havens, and Townes use two [[maser]]s frequency locked to each other and send the light in two directions. They receive the null result. The experiment is not as precise as earlier light-based MMX experiments, but demonstrates a novel setup that would become much more accurate in the future.
: 1964 – Jaseja, Javan, Murray and Townes repeat the earlier experiment with newer and much more precise masers.
: 1969 – Shamir and Fox repeat the MMX experiment with the "arms" in [[acrylic glass]] waveguides and a highly stable [[laser]] as the source. The experiment should detect a shift as small as ~0.00003 of a fringe, and none is measured.
: 1972 – R. S. Shankland admits he would not likely have given the effort to question Dayton Miller's work had it not been for Albert Einstein's "interest and encouragement."
: 1973 – Trimmer finds a null result in a triangular interferometer with one leg in glass.
: 1977 – Brecher repeats Zurhellen's experiment with binary pulsars, showing no difference in light speed to 2*10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; 
: 1979 Brillet and Hall use the Townes setup with highly accurate lasers, demonstrating no drift to 3 parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;. The experiment also demonstrates a leftover 17 Hz signal, but the authors assume it is linked to the laboratory.
: 1984 – Torr and Kolen find a cyclic phase shift between two [[atomic clock]]s, but the distance between is relatively short (0.5 km) and they are  clocks of the less-precise rubidium type
: 1988 – Gagnon et al. measure one way light speed and detect no anisotropy
: 1990 – Hils and Hall repeat the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment with lasers, taking measurements over the period of a year. They find no shifting in 2 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt;

: Krisher et al., Phys. Rev. D, 42, No. 2, pp. 731–734, (1990) use two hydrogen masers fixed to the earth and separated by a 21 km fiber-optic link to look for variations in the phase between them.  They put an upper limit on the one-way linear anisotropy of 100 m/s.
: 1991 – Over a six-month period, Roland DeWitte finds, over a 1.5 km underground [[coaxial cable]], a cyclic component in the phase drift between higher-precision caesium-beam clocks on more-or-less the same [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]; the period equals the [[sidereal day]] &lt;sub&gt;[http://www.lns.cornell.edu/spr/1998-12/msg0013719.html][https://web.archive.org/web/20040720192121/http://www.scieng.flinders.edu.au/cpes/people/cahill_r/HPS16.pdf]&lt;/sub&gt;
: 2003 – Holger Mueller and Achim Peters carry out a ''Modern Michelson–Morley Experiment using Cryogenic Optical Resonators'' at Humboldt University, Berlin. They find no shifting in 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sub&gt;[http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v91/e020401]&lt;/sub&gt;

==Overview==
=== Economy ===
Real GDP growth increased at an annual rate of 2.6%, up from a slow 0.7% in the preceding quarter. This was due to a smaller decrease in private [[inventory investment]], an acceleration in [[Personal consumption expenditure|PCE]], and an upswing in federal government spending. These gains were offset by decreases in exports and [[fixed investment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2017/pdf/gdp2q17_adv.pdf|title=Gross Domestic Product: First Quarter 2017 (Advance Estimate)|website=www.bea.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813005417/https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2017/pdf/gdp2q17_adv.pdf|archivedate=August 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 30, 2017 the US national debt stood at $19.84 trillion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/2017/opds062017.prn|title=Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States, June 30, 2017|website=www.treasurydirect.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812213308/https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/2017/opds062017.prn|archivedate=August 12, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing a quarterly decline of approximately 0.01%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/2017/opds032017.pdf|title=Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States, March 31, 2017|website=www.treasurydirect.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513031228/https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/2017/opds032017.pdf|archivedate=May 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a decline of approximately 0.46% since President Trump's inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/2017/opds012017.prn|title=Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States, January 31, 2017|website=www.treasurydirect.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513032156/https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/2017/opds012017.prn|archivedate=May 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tula''' is a [[Mesoamerica]]n archeological site, which was an important regional center which reached its height as the capital of the [[Toltec Empire]] between the fall of [[Teotihuacan]] and the rise of [[Tenochtitlan]]. It has not been well studied in comparison to these other two sites, and disputes remain as to its political system, area of influence and its relations with contemporary Mesoamerican cities, especially with [[Chichen Itza]]. The site is located in the city of [[Tula de Allende]] in the Tula Valley, in what is now the southwest of the Mexican state of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], northwest of [[Mexico City]]. The archeological site consists of a museum, remains of an earlier settlement called Tula Chico as well as the main ceremonial site called Tula Grande. The main attraction is the Pyramid of [[Quetzalcoatl]] which is topped by four, four metre high [[basalt]] columns carved in the shape of [[Toltec]] warriors. Tula fell around 1150, but it had significant influence in the following [[Aztec Empire]], with its history written about heavily in myth. The feathered serpent god Quetzalcoatl is linked to this city, whose worship was widespread from central Mexico to Central America at the time the Spanish arrived.

The Tula site is important to the history of Mesoamerica, especially the [[Mexican Plateau|central highlands of Mexico]], but it is generally overshadowed by its predecessor Teotihuacan and one of its successors, Tenochtitlan.&lt;ref name=ccowgil &gt;{{cite journal    |title= Ancient Tollan: Tula and the Toltec heartland |author= George L. Cowgill  |publisher= Antiquity |volume=78 |issue=299 |date=March 2004 |pages= 226–227  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Tula is derived from the [[Nahuatl]] phrase Tollan Xicocotitlan, which means 'near the [[cattail]]s'. However, the [[Aztecs]] applied the term Tollan to mean 'urban center', and it was also used to indicate other sites such as Teotihuacan, [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]] and Tenochtitlan. The inhabitants of Tula were called Toltecs, but that term was later broadened to mean an urban person, artisan or skilled worker. This was due to the high respect in which the indigenous peoples in the [[Valley of Mexico]] held the ancient civilization before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]].&lt;ref name=gbey &gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD   |title= A regional analysis of Toltec ceramics, Tula, Hidalgo, Mexico |author= James George Bey III   |publisher= Tulane University |year=1986 |oclc= 8624401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hprem &gt;{{cite book   |title= Ancient Americas : A Brief History &amp; Guide to Research |author= Hanns J. Prem |others= Kornelia  Kurbjuhn  (translator) |publisher= University of Utah Press  |location= Salt Lake City|year=1997  |pages= 20–23 |isbn= 9780874805369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

What remains of the ancient city is located in the southwest of what is now the state of Hidalgo, 75&amp;nbsp;km north of Mexico City.&lt;ref name=ccowgil /&gt;&lt;ref name=gbey /&gt; Geographically, it is in the Tula River Valley, at the south end of the Mesquite Valley in a region that indigenous records called Teotlapan (land of the gods). This area has an elevation of between 2000 and 2200 meters above sea level, with a semi-arid climate. It has only three continuously flowing rivers and streams, the largest of which is the [[Tula River]]. There are also a number of arroyos that flow during the rainy season.&lt;ref name=gbey /&gt;

The modern archeological site consists of the ceremonial center of Tula Grande, an area called Tula Chico, the [[Jorge R. Acosta]] site museum and the [[Guadalupe Mastache]] Orientation center. The museum is at the entrance to the site and is named after one of the archeologists who worked on the site for years. The interior is organized into various sections and contains sculpted stone works as well as human remains.  The Orientation center also contains a number of archeological pieces as well as posters and more explaining the site’s importance and relation to the rest of Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name=rincones &gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Victor Manuel |editor1-last= Jimenez Gonzalez |title= Hidalgo: Guía para descubrir los encantos del estado  |publisher= Editorial Océano de Mexico |year=2009 |isbn=978 607400 179 2  |pages= 75–78 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Hidalgo: Guide to discover the charms of the state }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is aligned at 17 degrees east of true north, similar to structures at Teotihuacan although the first village was aligned with true north between 700-900CE.&lt;ref name=sfrazier&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sfu.museum/hola/en/slides/featured/37/  |title= Featured Sites: Tula |publisher= Simon Frazier University Museum |accessdate=February 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremonial center of the city is located on a limestone outcropping, with steep banks on three sides, making it defensible.&lt;ref name=sfrazier/&gt;  War and sacrifice are prominent themes at the site with images representing warriors such as jaguars and coyotes as well as eagles eating human hearts. There are also images of serpents eating skeletal figures and skulls in various areas.&lt;ref name=hprem /&gt;&lt;ref name=sfrazier/&gt; The main structures of the ceremonial center include two pyramids, including with the [[Atlas (architecture)|atlas figures]], two main [[Mesoamerican ballcourt]]s and several large buildings, one with a series of columns which faced a large plaza.&lt;ref name=gbey /&gt; The main ceremonial area has a number of architectural innovations that indicate societal changes. The large central plaza has space for 100,000 people. On three sides, there are long meeting halls with ceilings supported by columns all facing the plaza with over 1000 meters of benches, which have stone reliefs depicting warriors and others in procession. The architecture indicates a change from rituals performed by only a few people in closed spaces to large ceremonies to be viewed by many. These ceremonies were dominated by warriors.&lt;ref name=hprem /&gt;

The major attraction of the site is Pyramid B also called the Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl or of the Morning Star. It is a five-tiered structure similar to the [[Chichen_Itza#Temple_of_the_Warriors|Temple of the Warriors at Chichen Itza]]. At the top of Pyramid B are [[Atlantean_figures_(Mesoamerica)#Tula|four massive columns each carved in the likeness of Toltec warriors]] which once supported the roof of the temple on top of the pyramid. Each warrior figure is of basalt, four meters high, with an [[atlatl]] or spear thrower, incense, a butterfly shaped chest plate and a back plate in the shape of a solar disk.&lt;ref name=sfrazier/&gt; A large vestibule fronts the pyramid and connects it to nearby buildings. Today this vestibule and building (Building C) are a space filled with broken columns.&lt;ref name=rincones /&gt;&lt;ref name=sfrazier/&gt; Building C is better known as the Burnt Palace named after evidence that it was burned. This pyramid is also surrounded by the Coatepantli or serpent wall, which was later the inspiration for a similar structure in Tenochtitlan.&lt;ref name=rincones /&gt;

==History==

The earliest well-defined settlements in the Tula area appear around 400 BCE. Tula was probably settled by people of various ethnic backgrounds which may have included the [[Nonoalca]]s and the [[Chichimeca]]s from the south and north respectively.&lt;ref name=hprem /&gt; The area probably was under the political control of Teotihuacan in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Epiclassic period]], according to Teotihuacan designs found on Tula pottery. The area’s lime deposits were probably an important source for the plaster used in construction.&lt;ref name=ccowgil /&gt; At this time Tula was a small urban settlement with modest public architecture concentrated at Tula Chico (Small Tula). The constructions at Tula Chico are smaller than those in other Epiclassic sites, and was probably a minor player in the political and economic activity of the time.&lt;ref name=msmith&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.public.asu.edu/~mesmith9/1-CompleteSet/MES-07-TulaChichen.pdf |author= Michael E .  Smith |title=Tula and Chichen Itza: Are we asking the right questions? |publisher= Arizona State University |accessdate=February 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tula Chico’s occupation is from 650 to 900. From 650 to 750, Tula Chico developed, and at its height spanned five to six km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, parts of which may be buried under Tula Grande.&lt;ref name=ccowgil /&gt; The population was somewhere between 19,000 and 27,000 at its height.&lt;ref name=gbey /&gt; Tula Chico was abandoned between 850 and 900CE, and Tula Grande began to develop.&lt;ref name=ccowgil /&gt; After the decline of Teotihuacan, there was a power vacuum with city states dominating small regions.&lt;ref name=hprem /&gt; Tula ceramics change during this period, as styles and techniques come under new influences.  At the same time, settlement patterns of the area significantly changed with occupation mostly on hilltops and high hillsides. Architecture and pottery show influence from the west and north, with some from the east, suggesting a multiethnic population.&lt;ref name=ccowgil /&gt;

The city rose to prominence after the fall of Teotihuacan and reached its height between 900 and 1150.&lt;ref name=sfrazier/&gt; Although Tula Grande (Big Tula) grew to be larger than anything contemporary with it, it never grew to the size of Teotihuacan.&lt;ref name=gbey /&gt; The city at its height probably covered 14km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a population of about 60,000 with another 20,000 to 25,000 in the surrounding 1000km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, dominated by the ceremonial center of Tula Grande.&lt;ref name=ccowgil /&gt;&lt;ref name=gbey /&gt; Urban and rural house units indicated the importance of extended family groups but the scale of these seemed to have become smaller over time.&lt;ref name=ccowgil /&gt; Tula had defensive fortification at Las Ranas and Toluquilla against the Chichimecas.&lt;ref name=hprem /&gt; Its political sphere is thought to include most of the present state of Hidalgo, into the Valley of Mexico and possibly into the [[Toluca Valley]] and the [[Bajío]]. Much of this is done by comparison of ceramics but this can indicate political or economic influence.&lt;ref name=gbey /&gt;

At that time, Tula was a fertile region near [[obsidian]] mines and on an important trade route. Its economic base was agriculture and the mining and crafting of obsidian. It appears the craft was practiced by about half of the occupants, along with the working of travertine and ceramics, taking over this function from Teotihuacan.&lt;ref name=hprem /&gt; Tula probably did not rule an empire but may have ruled a regional state.&lt;ref name=msmith/&gt; Long range contacts are indicated by the appearance of ceramics from eastern Mesoamerica, grey-green [[plumbate]] from southern [[Guatemala]] and polychrome ceramics from [[Costa Rica]]. Tula probably traded obsidian in return.&lt;ref name=hprem /&gt; The socioeconomics of Tula society is thought to have consisted of a ruling elite class, a craftsmen class, a merchant class and a large number of farm workers. Most of the farm workers were outside Tula proper with most of the other classes in the city. Excavations in the area have found evidence of the cultivation of chili peppers, amaranth, squash and maguey along with corn and beans. A number of wild plants were harvested including [[mesquite]] beans and cactus fruit. There is evidence of domesticated turkey and dog.&lt;ref name=gbey /&gt; Irrigated corn was the most important crop with anywhere from 3000 to 10000 hectares cultivated. It may not have been enough to feed the large population. There is an unoccupied area varying from one to three km wide which was probably agricultural.&lt;ref name=ccowgil /&gt; It has been proposed that the area received more rainfall during the Classic period than now which may have allowed for more large scale agricultural production without irrigation.&lt;ref name=gbey /&gt;

It is probable that they had a form of hieroglyphic writing system, but no evidence exists except for an occasional glyph on a structure.&lt;ref name=gbey /&gt; 

Tula did not last as long as other Mesoamerican dominions.&lt;ref name=ccowgil /&gt; Around 1000, there were problems created by the leeching of soil and the drying of the climate. This moved Chichimecas south from their drying homelands creating ethnic strife which eventually resulted in the city’s collapse. Many of the living quarters appear to have been abandoned by 1150. It is not known when the ceremonial center fell but it was burned and the pyramids destroyed.&lt;ref name=hprem /&gt; There is evidence of the ceremonial center being burned in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=sfrazier/&gt; Ethnohistoric sources mention other rulers and a king list was developed from them. The chronology dates the destruction of Tula around 1179 while under the rule of Ce Acatl Topilitzin. However this story has been disputed.&lt;ref name=gbey /&gt;

After the end of Tula, the site was looted, but it continued to be occupied through the rest of the Mesoamerican period and on into the colonial period.&lt;ref name=ccowgil /&gt;&lt;ref name=sfrazier/&gt; According to [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], craftspeople were still found in Tula at the time of the conquest including scribes, stonecutters, masons, feather workers, potters and more.&lt;ref name=gbey /&gt; 

The site was determined to be that of Tollan and the Toltecs after ethnographic studies and archeological work from the 1950s to the 1970s.&lt;ref name=gbey /&gt; However, Tula is not well understood, especially in its relation to its predecessor of Teotihuacan and little has been published.&lt;ref name=msmith/&gt; No detailed archeological map of the city exists.&lt;ref name=ccowgil /&gt; Most studies have Tula remaining after the Epiclassic cities such as Teotihuacan collapsed, becoming the major power in the early post classic, but some archeologists dispute this, putting its height earlier with the other cities.&lt;ref name=msmith/&gt;  Several misconceptions about the site include that it has no system of avenues, was relatively poor, had no walled residential complexes and had only small mound clusters. It did have a grid system but it had several major reorientations. Large residential complexes have been unearthed just outside the ceremonial center. The elite also had access to much of the finest handcrafted items then available in Mesoamerica. The size and nature of the city’s political sphere is in dispute. There are no written records and the archeological evidence is scant.&lt;ref name=gbey /&gt;

==Influence of Tula==
There is evidence of Tula influence in other parts of Mesoamerica, mostly seen in pottery in Tula and in other areas.&lt;ref name=msmith/&gt; One of the most debated questions is what, if any, [[Maya-Toltec Controversy in Chichen Itza|relationship there might be between Tula and Chichén Itzá]] far to the south in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. The idea comes from the fact that there are similarities in various art and architectural styles.  It is certain that neither could have conquered the other, but there is evidence that they may have been connected through trade networks.&lt;ref name=msmith/&gt;

By the time of the Spanish conquest, Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent deity was widely worshipped from what is now central Mexico down into [[Central America]]. The god is linked to a legendary ruler of Tula, Ce Acatl Quetzacoatl, who was often simply referred to as Quetzalcoatl. Mythological accounts surrounding the fall of Tula have this ruler succumbing to temptation by a dark deity named [[Tezcatlipoca]], causing the destruction of the city. The fallen ruler then wanders to the Gulf Coast, immolates himself becoming the morning star ([[Venus]]) .&lt;ref name=gbey /&gt;&lt;ref name=hprem /&gt;

The history of the city remained important up through the [[Aztec Empire]] and is reported in the codices written after the Spanish conquest. However, most of these stories are heavy in myth.&lt;ref name=gbey /&gt;&lt;ref name=hprem /&gt; These tend to start with the Toltecs and the city of Tula, followed by the migration of the [[Mexica]] to the Valley of Mexico.&lt;ref name=msmith/&gt; The stories either portray Tula as a kind of paradise in which the inhabitants master the sciences and arts or a city filled with strife headed for a downfall.&lt;ref name=hprem /&gt; In these the last ruler, Quetzalcoatl, is a legendary being with archetypical qualities.&lt;ref name=msmith/&gt;

Much of Toltec history was lost when [[Izcoatl]] burned the history books after founding the Aztec Empire. The planning of Tula was adopted by some Aztec city-state rulers for their urban centers.&lt;ref name=msmith/&gt;

The '''Westerwald Club''' ({{lang-de|Westerwald-Verein}}) or '''WWV''' was founded in 1888 in [[Selters (Westerwald)|Selters]] in the German mountain range of [[Westerwald]] and has about 7,000 members in 40 branches. It acts as a local history society for the whole geographical region of the [[Westerwald]]. The main club supports and coordinates the activities of its branches and takes responsibility for wider tasks. It is entered in the club register of the Amtsgericht of [[Montabaur]] (VR 485). Its branches support the aims of the main club at local level through largely independent initiatives and events.

The motto of the Westerwald Club is ''"Hui! Wäller? - Allemol!"'' This slogan was chosen in a 1913 prize competition from over 60 entries. The winner was local poet and farmer, Adolf Weiß (1861–1938) from [[Mademühlen]].

The meaning of the greeting was explained in his poem: ''Das Hui hat mich der Sturmwind gelehrt, wenn wild er über die Heide fährt, und „Wäller“ wir ja „allemol“ sind, wir trotzen dem Regen, dem Schnee und dem Wind ...''

The Westerwald Club is a member of the [[Associations of German Alpine and Hiking Clubs]] and supports hiking and tourism. The main club offers multi-day walks through the Westerwald, as well as hiking holidays abroad. The branches organise regular walks and excursions.

The club waymarks and manages a hiking trail network over 2,300 km long, including the [[Druidensteig]], the [[Limes Trail]] and the [[Westerwald Trail]]. Many branches maintain their local footpaths. The branches in Aßlar, Herborn and Wetzlar-Niedergirmes also have their own walking hostels, in which hikers may stay overnight at low cost. Walking hostels without accommodation are run by the branches in Blasbach, Dillenburg, Selters and Wißmar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westerwaldverein.de/Wanderheime.html westerwaldverein.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

Darüber hinaus sieht der Westerwaldverein eine zeitgerechte [[Heimatpflege]] als eine seiner Aufgaben an. Im Haupt- und in den Zweigvereinen sind Personen damit beauftragt, [[Heimatgeschichte]], [[Volkskunde]], [[Brauchtum]] und [[Mundart]], Liedgut und [[Volkstanz]] zu pflegen und in Veröffentlichungen zu fördern. Der Verein unterstützt auch intensiv das [[Hachenburg#Landschaftsmuseum Westerwald|Landschaftsmuseum Westerwald]] in Hachenburg, dessen Mitbegründer und Träger er war und dessen Mitglied er immer noch ist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26229">There is a wide range of ways in which people have represented '''World War II in popular culture'''. Many works were created during the years of conflict and many more have arisen from that period of world history.

Some well-known examples of books about the war, like Nobel laureate [[Kenzaburō Ōe]]'s ''Okinawa Notes,'' could only have been crafted in retrospect.&lt;ref name="nyt2008"&gt;Onishi, Norimitsu. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/world/asia/29japan.html?scp=2&amp;sq=kenzaburo+oe&amp;st=nyt  "Japanese Court Rejects Defamation Lawsuit Against Nobel Laureate,"] ''New York Times.'' March 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
{{main|Art and World War II}}
The years of warfare were the backdrop for art which is now preserved and displayed in such institutions as the [[Imperial War Museum#Department of Art|Imperial War Museum]] in [[London]] and the [[National Maritime Museum]] at [[Greenwich]].

Iconic memorials created after the war are designed as symbols of remembrance and as carefully contrived works of art.

==Literature==
The war also figures prominently in many thousands of novels and other works of literature, including many published in the 1990s and [[2000s (decade)|2000s]].

==Movies and television==
{{main|List of World War II films|War film#World War II}}
Social historians regard the works of popular culture from the World War II era as documents that mirror and define crucial issues and concerns during that time. Individual combatants and those on the home fronts during World War II experienced the war through newspaper reports, radio broadcasts, films, stage plays, books and popular music—all become noteworthy aspects of understanding the period and its impact on what happened afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Oboler, Howard. "American Fights World War II: Films, Theater and Popular Music." 92nd St. Y lecture catalog (NYC, November 20080, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

World War II has provided material for many films, television programmes and books, beginning during the war. The film aspect had reached its peak by the 1960s, with films such as ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (which had been adapted from a [[The Longest Day (book)|book]]), ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'', ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'' and ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]''. In the [[UK]] the actor [[Sir John Mills]] became particularly associated with war dramas, such as ''[[The Colditz Story]]'' (1954), ''[[Above Us the Waves (film)|Above Us the Waves]]'' (1955) and ''[[Ice Cold in Alex]]'' (1958), and was seen as the personification of Britain at war, conveying heroism and humility.

Movies about World War II continued for the rest of the 20th century and into the 21st century, though less in number and included ''[[Schindler's List]] (1993 film)'', '' [[The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (film)|The boy in the Striped Pajamas]] (2009 film)'', ''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]'' (1998), ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' (1998), ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]'' (2006)  and ''[[Red Tails]]'' (2012) about the African American Air Fighter pilots of the [[Tuskegee Airmen]]. Movies and television programs about the war continued to be made into the 21st century, including the television mini-series ''[[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]'', ''[[The Pacific (TV miniseries)|The Pacific]]'' and ''[[Dunkirk (TV series)|Dunkirk]]''. The majority of World War II films are portrayed from the Allied perspective (increasingly being limited to that of the Americans). Some exceptions include ''[[Das Boot]]'', ''[[Der Untergang]]'', ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]'', ''[[Stalingrad (1993 film)|Stalingrad'']], ''[[Joy Division (2006 film)|Joy Division]]'', and ''[[Cross of Iron]]''. World War II used to provide most of the material for the USA TV channel, the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]. [[Mel Brooks]] used the theme in the fictitious musical "Springtime for Hitler" and in his 1968 film and 2001 musical, ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]''.

A number of television comedy sitcoms are based on the war, e.g. ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'' from America, which follows the actions of a group of Allied POWs involved in covert activities. Three British sitcoms from [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]] are ''[['Allo 'Allo!]]'' which makes fun of the French Resistance forces; ''[[Dad's Army]]'' which satirizes the British Home Guard, an anti-invasion force of men who are old or in poor health so cannot join the forces; and ''[[It Ain't Half Hot Mum]]'' about a Forces Concert Party entertaining troops in India and Burma. In the [[The Germans|sixth episode]] of [[Fawlty Towers]], [[Basil Fawlty]] (played by [[John Cleese]]) bases his comical routine on the paramount need that he and his staff be polite and "''don't mention the War!''" to their German guests, a task in which he signally and repeatedly fails himself. In 2009, an anime adaptation of the webcomic [[Hetalia: Axis Powers]] was released and parodies the characters as countries and their transactions in the war through social adult issues.

Many non-war-related TV shows in the USA, such as [[The Simpsons]], [[South Park]], [[Family Guy]], [[The Looney Tunes Show]] and [[Seinfeld]] frequently make reference to World War II-related persons and subjects, such as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Franklin Roosevelt]], battles during the war, [[The Holocaust]] and the bombings of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. During the war several [[Donald Duck]] shorts were also propaganda films.

===Holocaust films===
{{main|Holocaust films}}
Also, some films and TV series attempt to show and educate the future generation about the horror of racism and discrimination when taken into a national frenzy by making films based on the Holocaust and other [[German war crimes]]. Movies like [[Schindler's List]], [[Anne Frank: The Whole Story]], [[Life Is Beautiful]], [[The Devil's Arithmetic]], [[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]], [[The Boy in the Striped Pajamas (film)|The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas]] and many other films depict the hardship the Jews endured in Auschwitz and other concentration camps.

===Eastern Asia===
Due to the still sensitive subject between [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], the [[Pacific War|War in the Pacific]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] is hardly made into any historical [[war film]]s intended for entertainment use in these countries. However, reference about the ongoing war as a background setting is heavily used as a setpiece to drive the storyline on. For example, Hong Kong [[martial arts films]] have used the "[[cartoon villain]]" portrayal of Japanese soldiers or generals being defeated by the Chinese lead character in an attempt to stop the Japanese from using biological weapons or stealing Chinese treasures (films like ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', ''[[Millionaire's Express]]'' and ''[[Fist of Legend]]''). Some films that depict [[Japanese war crimes]] were also made, such as the controversial exploitation film ''[[Men Behind the Sun]]''.

More serious documentary style films have also been made such as the German made documentary ''[[Nanking (1938 film)|Nanking]]''. However the depiction of the [[Defense of Sihang Warehouse]] was made in 1938, one year after the actual [[Battle of Shanghai]], probably one of the earliest Sino-Japanese war film intended for entertainment and moral boosting propaganda. Also recently, to celebrate the [[Chinese Red Army]] first victory (out of two major battles the Communists actually fought) over the Japanese, a heavy-handed propaganda film that depict the [[Battle of Pingxingguan]] was made in 2005 to commemorate the 60th anniversary. However it was heavily criticised by the government of [[Taiwan]], accusing the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] government for hiding the truth by discrediting the [[Nationalist Revolutionary Army]] who took the brunt of the battles as it was they who did most of the fighting against the invaders in more than twenty battles. Actually, the PRC has made several films focusing on battles fought by Nationalist soldiers, such as the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]] and [[Battle of Kunlun Pass]].

[[South Korea]], which still has strong [[anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea|anti-Japanese sentiments]], recently made a [[Empress Myeongseong (TV series)|TV series]] about the Japanese assassination of [[Empress Myeongseong]] and the unfair treatment of the Korean people; several films based on [[Kim Du-han]] as a freedom fighter were made.

==Games==
{{main|List of World War II video games}}
Traditional board [[wargaming]] has replicated World War II from the tactical to the grand strategic levels. ''[[Axis &amp; Allies]]'' and other such games continue to be popular. [[Avalon Hill]] and other wargame companies produced such complex games as ''[[Squad Leader]]'' and ''[[PanzerBlitz]]'' in the 1970s. Other popular World War II games still in production include Australian Design Group's ''[[World In Flames]]'' and Decision Games reproductions of SPI World War II games.

World War II has also been replicated through miniatures tabletop wargaming. Games like ''[[Flames of War]]'', ''Command Decision'', ''Spearhead'', ''[[BlitzkriegCommander]]'' and others have become popular among historical miniature wargamers. A novelty is the upcoming of free internet based wargames in high quality such as ''[[Final Round (World War II miniatures wargaming)|Final Round]]''.

One relatively new development of the "World War II media franchise" is that of [[video game]]s. They are an extremely lucrative aspect of the gaming industry, and many titles are usually released every year. Some established games series about World War II include ''[[Battlefield 1942]]'', ''[[Medal of Honor (video game series)|Medal of Honor]]'', ''[[Call of Duty]]'', ''[[Close Combat (series)|Close Combat]]'', ''[[Day of Defeat]]'', ''[[Day of Defeat: Source]]'', ''[[Brothers in Arms (series)|Brothers in Arms]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', arguably the highest acclaimed [[Submarine simulator]] franchise so far -  ''[[Silent Hunter]]'' '', the [[Commandos (series)|Commandos]]'' series, as well as the [[grand strategy]] game ''[[Hearts of Iron II]]''. An RTS game was released based on America's western campaign called ''[[Company of Heroes]]''. In 2001, a massively multiplayer online game [[MMORG]] ''[[World War II Online]]'' was introduced, and has thousands of players refighting the 1940 Western Europe campaign. There are however also much older games about the war, the arcade game ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]'' being one of many examples.

==The Soviet Union and Russia==
The Soviet Union incurred the heaviest casualties in World War II, and its history gave rise to an impressive number of films, poetry and prose, both in Russian and in many other languages of the country. The cultural homage to the Soviet soldiers and victims of World War II has been brought for decades; films about the war are shot in modern-day Russia up to present day. 
A few pinnacles of the Soviet cinema dedicated to World War Two include:
[[The Cranes Are Flying]] by [[Mikhail Kalatozov]], [[Ivan's Childhood]] by [[Andrei Tarkovsky]], and [[The Alive and the Dead]] by [[Aleksandr Stolper]]. [[Elem Klimov]]'s [[Come and See]] is widely considered to be one of the greatest war movies ever made.

Poetry: [[Zhuravli|"the Cranes"]] by the renowned Dagestani poet Rasul Gamzatov, "Wait for me"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.simonov.co.uk/waitforme.htm&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Konstantin Simonov]], "I am Goya"&lt;ref&gt;http://audiopoetry.wordpress.com/2006/07/02/i-am-goya/&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Andrei Voznesensky]], "It has snowed for three days" by Mustai Karim&lt;ref&gt;http://eng.bashkortostan450.ru/celebrities/writers/writers_128.html&lt;/ref&gt; (a Bashkir poet).

==Sensitive issues==
In 1970, Ōe wrote in ''Okinawa Notes'' that members of the Japanese military had coerced masses of Okinawan civilians into committing suicide during the [[Battle of Okinawa|Allied invasion of the island]] in 1945. In 2005, two retired Japanese military officers sued Ōe for libel; and in 2008, the [[Osaka]] District Court dismissed the case because, as the judge explained, "The military was deeply involved in the [[mass suicide]]s". Ōe commented succinctly by saying, "The judge accurately read my writing."&lt;ref name="nyt2008"/&gt;

==Pop culture reference==
The war has also influenced [[football (soccer)|footballing]] (soccer) rivalries. Most notably, the subject of World War II is used as chants by fans of the [[English national football team|English football team]]. One such chant is "2 World Wars and 1 [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], do dah, do dah."

Campaigns, battles and so on have been commemorated throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century, mostly by veterans of the war and people that lived through it. In 2004 the commemoration of the [[D-Day]] landings took place which included, for the first time, German veterans of the war. Later that year, the commemoration of the campaigns in Italy and the Netherlands also took place. The 60th anniversary of the liberation of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] was commemorated in January 2005, while many other campaigns were also commemorated, as well as the end of the war in Europe and the Far East.

==World War II reenactment==
{{Expand section|date=February 2013}}
[[World War II reenactment]]s mainly reenact the military personal of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] or [[Axis powers]].
