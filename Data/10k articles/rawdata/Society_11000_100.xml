'''7iber''' ({{lang-ar|حبر}}) is a multimedia organization that engages in multimedia journalism in order to inform, engage, and inspire. It is pronounced "Hiber" with the 7 standing in for the "haa" sound in Arabic, and means "ink." &lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2007/09/can-citizen-journalism-make-a-difference-in-jordan249/|title=Can Citizen Journalism Make a Difference in Jordan? &amp;#124; Mediashift &amp;#124; PBS|publisher=pbs.org|accessdate=2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
7iber is an online publication that seeks to inform, inspire, and engage communities to foster a more open society. 7iber works in three areas: 1) creating original informative multimedia content and providing a platform for critical conversation, 2) conducting research on Internet governance and digital rights, and 3) operating a co-working office, and an events space, including a cafe. 7iber also conducts training on topics related to digital media. They stand for universal human rights, freedom of expression and access to information. They believe that people and communities should have the freedom to craft and share their own narratives. 7iber began in 2007 as a citizen media platform with the initial costs of the website covered by its founding members. 

Since 2009, 7iber has grown into a media organization that is a registered LLC in Jordan, and financed through grants and media projects. While 7iber is based in Jordan, their content is increasingly covering more and more geographic and intellectual areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.7iber.com/about&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Press and Publication Amendments in Jordan==
On July 1, 2013, 7iber.com was blocked by the Jordanian government during a crackdown on online media. &lt;ref name="mmedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/10questions/jordan-blocks-7ibercom|title=10 Questions for 7iber.com|publisher=now.mmedia.me|accessdate=2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The block came after a public debate over the Press and Publication Law where Fayez Shawabkeh, the director of the government’s Press and Publication Department, was asked why the website was not blocked previously.&lt;ref name="i-m-s"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-m-s.dk/jordan-adds-popular-blog-to-website-black-list/|title=Jordan adds popular blog to website black list &amp;raquo; International Media Support (IMS)|publisher=i-m-s.dk|accessdate=2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shawabkeh said, “If I find it's a news website, I will block it,” and later added, “if it's a blog, the law does not apply to it." &lt;ref name="i-m-s"/&gt; The Jordanian government determined that 7iber is a website rather than a blog, and blocked access to the site until 7iber registers as a news agency.&lt;ref name="mmedia"/&gt;

7iber’s administration says they were informed of the ban through a memo sent by the Press and Publication Department to Telecom Regulatory Commission, which is against regulations.&lt;ref name="i-m-s"/&gt; “If the Press and Publication Department decided that 7iber.com needs a license, which is against all their public statements about blogs, they are supposed to officially inform us of this decision and give us 90&amp;nbsp;days before blocking the website,” 7iber added in an official statement.&lt;ref name="i-m-s"/&gt; They also said that the law in question is a tool used to arbitrarily stifle freedom of expression.&lt;ref name="i-m-s"/&gt;

In order to register as a news agency, 7iber would have to have an editor in chief that has been a member of the Jordan Press Association (JPA) for at least 4&amp;nbsp;years, but membership in the JPA is not given to journalists who work in online media.&lt;ref name="i-m-s"/&gt; 

7iber was recently blocked again in August 2014. They have produced multimedia content that [http://www.7iber.com/2012/09/infographic-the-road-to-internet-censorship-in-jordan/ explains the amendments] to the Press and Publications law, in addition to two materials explaining book censorship,  [http://www.7iber.com/2014/08/book-censorship-2/ here] and [http://www.7iber.com/2014/02/jo-book-censorship/ here]. Also, they produced infographics, such as one about the [http://www.7iber.me/2013/11/infographic-legislative-limits-on-freedom-of-expression-in-jordan/ Legislative Limits on Freedom of Expression in Jordan]. 

7iber has also developed multimedia concepts. Examples include a story about [http://www.7iber.com/2014/04/mafraq/ Syrian refugees in Mafraq]. This story was also [http://www.7iber.com/2014/08/a-towns-sudden-growth/ translated into English].

'''''Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape''''' is a 1975 book about [[rape]] by [[Susan Brownmiller]], in which the author argues that rape is "a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear." Brownmiller's book is widely credited with changing public outlooks and attitudes about rape. Some sociobiologists and others criticized the book and rejected her conclusions.

==Summary==
Brownmiller criticizes authors such as [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Friedrich Engels]] for what she considers their oversights on the subject of rape. She describes rape as "a conscious process of intimidation by which ''all men'' keep ''all women'' in a state of fear". She writes that, to her knowledge, no zoologist has ever observed that animals rape in their natural habitat.&lt;ref&gt;Brownmiller, Susan. ''Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape''. Pelican Books, 1986, pp. 11, 12, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Brownmiller sought to examine general belief systems that women who were raped deserved it, as discussed by [[Clinton Duffy]] and others. She discusses rape in war, challenges the Freudian concept of women's rape fantasies, and compares it to the gang [[lynching]]s of [[African Americans]] by white men.&lt;ref name="Cullen-DuPont2000"/&gt; This comparison was used to show how lynching was once considered acceptable by communities, and then attitudes changed, followed by changed laws; Brownmiller hoped the same would happen with rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title='Rape Is a Crime Not of Lust, but Power,' argues Susan Brownmiller |magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |first=Sally |last=Moore |volume=4 |issue=19 |url= http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20065841,00.html |date=November 10, 1975 |archivedate=October 14, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014211803/http://people.com/archive/rape-is-a-crime-not-of-lust-but-power-argues-susan-brownmiller-vol-4-no-19/ |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Against Our Will'' is widely credited with changing public outlooks and attitudes about [[rape]].&lt;ref name="Cullen-DuPont2000" /&gt; It is cited as having influenced changes in law regarding rape, such as state criminal codes that required a corroborating witness to a rape, and that permitted a defendant's lawyer to introduce evidence in court regarding a victim's prior sexual history.&lt;ref name="Cullen-DuPont2000"&gt;{{cite book|first=Kathryn|last= Cullen-DuPont|title=Encyclopedia of Women's History in America|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC|accessdate=4 February 2012|date=1 August 2000|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-4100-8|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Ellen Gale wrote in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' that ''Against Our Will'' "deserves a place on the shelf next to those rare books about social problems which force us to make connections we have too long evaded, and change the way we feel about what we know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times Book Review]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/12/archives/rape-as-the-ultimate-exercise-of-mans-domination-of-women.html |title=Rape as the ultimate exercise of man's domination of women |first=Mary Ellen |last=Gale |date=October 12, 1975 |archivedate=2017-10-16 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20171016155043/http://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/12/archives/rape-as-the-ultimate-exercise-of-mans-domination-of-women.html?_r=0 |deadurl=no |access-date=2017-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was included in the "Women Rise" category of the [[New York Public Library]]'s Books of the Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.nypl.org/voices/print-publications/books-of-the-century| title=The New York Public Library's Books of the Century| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| year=1996| isbn=978-0-19-511790-5| archivedate=2013-04-16| archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130416004336/http://www.nypl.org/voices/print-publications/books-of-the-century| deadurl=no| access-date=2013-01-28| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]] gave the book a mostly positive review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', noting that Brownmiller "organized an enormous body of information into a multipurposed tool" that gave a program for modernizing rape laws while considering the treatment of rape in war overly detailed and numbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/16/archives/books-of-the-times-rape-as-the-combat-in-a-war.html|title=Books of The Times: Rape as the Combat in a War|first=Christopher|last=Lehmann-Haupt|authorlink=Christopher Lehmann-Haupt|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|page=37|date=October 16, 1975|accessdate=October 16, 2017|archivedate=2017-10-16|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20171016155913/http://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/16/archives/books-of-the-times-rape-as-the-combat-in-a-war.html|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have taken a more critical view of the work. Gay scholar [[John Lauritsen]] dismissed ''Against Our Will'', calling it "a shoddy piece of work from start to finish: ludicrously inaccurate, reactionary, dishonest, and vulgarly written."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.paganpressbooks.com/jpl/RAPE.HTM|title=Rape: Hysteria and Civil Liberties|first=John |last= Lauritsen|authorlink=John Lauritsen|year=1976|accessdate= October 16, 2017| archivedate=July 3, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703094126/http://www.paganpressbooks.com/jpl/RAPE.HTM|deadurl=no}} Essay initially published in shorter form in ''The Gay Liberator'' (Detroit) in 1976 and complete in mimeographed pamphlet that year. Posted online 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angela Davis]] argued that Brownmiller disregarded the part that black women played in the [[anti-lynching movement]] and that Brownmiller's discussion of rape and race became an "unthinking partnership which borders on racism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first= Angela Y.|authorlink=Angela Davis|title=Women, Race &amp; Class|year=1981|publisher=Random House, Vintage Books|pages=195, 198|isbn=0-394-71351-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brownmiller's conclusions about rapists' motivations have been criticized by the anthropologist [[Donald Symons]] in ''[[The Evolution of Human Sexuality]]'' (1979),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Symons|first= Donald| authorlink=Donald Symons|title=The Evolution of Human Sexuality|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 1979|page= 278}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Randy Thornhill]] and Craig T.

'''''America's Safest and Most Dangerous Cities''''' is a publication issued annually by [[CQ Press]], a division of [[Congressional Quarterly]] Inc., that ranks [[United States|American]] cities on the basis of safety and crime. According to the publisher, the rankings are based upon statistics submitted by cities to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) which are then published by the FBI online, as part of the Bureau's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/index.html |title=FBI — Crime2006 |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209230523/http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/index.html |archivedate=2014-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the ranking has been criticized by several organizations, including The [[American Society of Criminology]] (ASC), Criminal Justice Journalists, and The [[United States Conference of Mayors]] as well as the FBI.{{citation needed|date=June 2008}}

'''''Angels in the Outfield''''' is a 1951 American comedy film produced and directed by [[Clarence Brown]] and starring [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]] and [[Janet Leigh]]. Based on a story by Richard Conlin, the film is about a young woman reporter who blames the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]' losing streak on their abusive manager, who begins hearing the voice of an angel promising to help the team if he changes his ways. The film was released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] on October 19, 1951.

==Plot==
With baseball's [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in last place, their combative, foul-mouthed manager Guffy McGovern has plenty to complain about. All this changes when, while wandering through [[Forbes Field]] in search of his [[good luck charm]] one night, Guffy is accosted by the voice of an angel (voice of [[James Whitmore]]), who hints at having been a ballplayer during his earthly life.

As the spokes-angel for the Heavenly Choir Nine, a celestial team of deceased ballplayers, he begins bestowing "miracles" upon the Pirates—but only on the condition that McGovern put a moratorium on swearing and fighting.

With the help of the invisible ghosts of past baseball greats, the Pirates make it into the pennant race. During a game, 8-year-old orphan Bridget White insists that she can see the angels helping out the "live" ballplayers—understandably so, since it was Bridget's prayers to the Archangel [[Gabriel]] that prompted the angel to visit McGovern in the first place.

Local newspaper reporter and former "household hints" writer Jennifer Paige inadvertently transforms Bridget's angelic visions into a nationwide news story, causing McGovern no end of trouble. After Guffy is [[beanball|beaned]] during a game and himself confirms Bridget's claims, he falls into the hands of vengeful sportscaster Fred Bayles, who has been scheming to have McGovern thrown out of baseball and persuades the [[Commissioner of Baseball]] to investigate McGovern's fitness as a manager.

Complication piles upon complication until the [[National League pennant|pennant]]-deciding game, wherein Guffy is forced to rely exclusively upon the talents of his ballplayers—notably "over the hill" pitcher Saul Hellman (who, the angel has told Guffy, will be "signed up" by the Heavenly Choir team shortly). Guffy also wins over Jennifer, and they plan to adopt young Bridget.

The angels themselves are never actually seen by the viewing audience, just the effects of their presence—a feather dropping, or someone being jostled from time to time. The angel who talks to Guffy never reveals who he was in life. However this angel does reveal his presence to Bayles when Bayles sarcastically asks to "the little angels up there" if they are happy with the Pirates win over the Yankees when Bayles hears the angel reply "Oh why don't you just shut up?" and pulls Bayles' hat down over Bayles' face.  Bayles looks up incredously upon hearing the voice, searching for the voice's speaker.

It being a time when the [[Hays Code]] prohibited most use of profanity in films, the "swearing" uttered by Guffy is audio gibberish, scrambled recordings of his own voice.

''The Pittsburgh Press''. September 8, 1951. Retrieved January 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[MGM]] originally purchased the story as a vehicle for [[Spencer Tracy]],&lt;ref&gt;Brady, Thomas F. "Metro Will Film Baseball Comedy; 'Angels in the Outfield,' Written by Priest, Bought by Studio for Spencer Tracy". ''The New York Times''. October 12, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; who was later replaced by [[Clark Gable]].&lt;ref&gt;Brady, Thomas. "Clark Gable Gets Metro Movie Lead; He Replaces Spencer Tracy as Star of 'Angels in the Outfield". ''The New York Times''. January 19, 1951 &lt;/ref&gt; When Gable chose instead to make [[Lone Star (1952 film)|''Lone Star'']], MGM attempted unsuccessfully to borrow [[James Cagney]] from [[Warner Brothers]] before settling on [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]].&lt;ref&gt;Brady, Thomas F. "Miss Barrymore Signs for Picture". ''The New York Times''. February 16, 1951. "At Metro, Clark Gable has turned down the starring role in "Angels in the Outfield," a baseball comedy with religious overtones, and the studio is negotiating with James Cagney to replace him."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Louella. "Monday Morning Gossip of the Nation". ''The Philadelphia Inquirer''. February 26, 1951. "Yes, Paul, who belongs to 20th Century Fox, goes on loan to Culver City to make this baseball special first scheduled for Clark Gable. "The King" bowed out in favor of his independent, "Lone Star." James Cagney was close to inheriting the part when Warners decided to keep him on the home lot for Harlan Ware's "Come Fill the Cup."&lt;/ref&gt; Two years earlier Douglas had played a catcher in another baseball comedy film, ''[[It Happens Every Spring]]''.
Although he had no background in baseball, [[Bruce Bennett]], who portrays a veteran Pittsburgh pitcher, in real life had played football in the [[1926 Rose Bowl]] and won a silver medal in the shot put at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]].

Rothberg, one of the Pirate players, is played by [[Jeff Richards (baseball player/actor)|Jeff Richards]], who had been a minor-league baseball player before becoming an actor. [[Fred Graham (actor)|Fred Graham]], who appears as "Chunk," had been a semi-pro ballplayer, while another member of the cast, [[Paul Salata]], who has the role of Tony Minelli, played professional football from 1949-53.

=== Filming locations===
The film contains extensive baseball action shots, most of which were filmed at [[Forbes Field]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Take Me Out to the Ballpark|last= Leventhal|first= Josh|author2= Jessica MacMurray|year= 2000|publisher= [[Workman Publishing Company]]|location= [[New York, New York]]|isbn= 1-57912-112-8|page= 53}}&lt;/ref&gt; the former home of the Pittsburgh Pirates and [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]], demolished in 1971, the year after the Pirates and Steelers moved to [[Three Rivers Stadium]]. The opening credits acknowledge "the kind cooperation of the Pittsburgh 'Pirates' for the use of the team and its ballpark," while reminding the viewer that the story is fictional and "could be any baseball team, in any league, in any town in America."

Historians may note several distinguishing features of Forbes Field at the time. One is the "Kiner's Korner" inner fence in left field, with the 365-feet left field foul line marker observable on the outer wall, and the 335-feet sign on the inner fence. The other distance markers (376-457-436-375-300) are visible in some scenes. Other objects on the field of play at Forbes are visible from time to time, including the flagpole and batting cage near the 457 foot marker in deep left center field, and the Barney Dreyfuss monument in straightaway center field.  The [[University of Pittsburgh]]'s [[Cathedral of Learning]] is prominent in many shots filmed in Forbes Field.

A few scenes were shot on location at [[Wrigley Field (Los Angeles)|Wrigley Field]], conveniently sited in South Los Angeles. Well-used by film-makers of the era, the ballpark—home to the minor league Angels from 1925 to 1957—was named for team owner William Wrigley, Jr. when the landmark Chicago stadium was still known as [[Wrigley Field|Cubs Park]]. While Wrigley's ivy-covered outfield wall stands in nicely for that of Forbes Field, "Kiner's Korner" is conspicuous in its absence, and visible distance markers (412 feet in centre field; 345 feet in left) are inconsistent with Forbes Field's grander dimensions.

Some stock footage alleged to be the [[Polo Grounds]] in New York City was actually [[Comiskey Park]] in Chicago, as evidenced by a quick glimpse of an auxiliary scoreboard reading "Visitors" and "White Sox".

==Box office==
According to MGM records the film made $1,466,000 in the US and Canada and $200,000 elsewhere. Once studio overhead was added, the film recorded a net loss of $171,000.&lt;ref name="Mannix"/&gt;

{{Armenians}}
The '''Armenians in Kuwait''' are people of [[Armenian people|Armenian]] descent living in [[Kuwait]]. As of 2013, there has been a large population increase and now there are 6,000 Armenians.&lt;ref name="arme"&gt;[http://www.tert.am/en/news/2013/05/30/fadey-charchoghlyan/ We have around 6,000 Armenians in Kuwait, says ambassador]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Gulf War, the Armenian population reached its peak of 12,000.&lt;ref name="rebuildingAfterGulfWar"&gt;[http://www.agbu.org/publications/article.asp?A_ID=111 The Armenians of Kuwait: Rebuilding after the Gulf War] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044202/http://www.agbu.org/publications/article.asp?A_ID=111 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But after the Iraqi invasions, the numbers of the Armenians resident in Kuwait greatly diminished to just 500&lt;ref name="rebuildingAfterGulfWar"/&gt; as they left the country.

==History==
The first known Armenian presence in Kuwait came in the late 1890s-1900 ([[turn of the century]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=icj1SiWf6YUC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq|title=The Reign of Mubarak-Al-Sabah: Shaikh of Kuwait 1896–1915 |work=Salwa Al Ghanim|year=2013|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Armenian families were established in 1947 (Boghos Hovakimian with wife Arousiag there son Hovak was born in 1952 first Armenian born in Kuwait American hospital, Mihran Zakarian and family). At that time there was less that 40 single Armenian men there. Among them were Nerses Shaghzoian, Ashot Babken, and Samuel Galoustian (in the early 1950s) and Hrair Hagopian (in the late 1950s) who had migrated from Iran. The most famous Armenian presence in Kuwait came immediately after the rise of Arab nationalism in [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] in the 1950s and the 1960s.

The first wave of Armenian immigrants to Kuwait were people looking to escape the turmoil in other Arab states. They consisted of engineers and contractors from Iran and also skilled craftsmen from [[Aleppo]] who found work in Kuwait’s light industry, auto repair, auto body, plumbing, electrical and service sector.

A new influx of young Armenians created the need to establish an Armenian school in Kuwait, which was spearheaded by Vigen Shaghzo (aka Vicken Shaghzoian). In 1960, founders Vigen Shaghzo and brother Arshavir Shaghzo, supported by other prominent members of the Armenian community established Kuwait's first Armenian School and Armenian Apostolic Church.

By the mid-1980s, this Armenian population of Kuwait reached its peak of 12,000. During and after [[Operation Desert Storm]], the population diminished as Armenians immigrated to [[North America]]. As of 2013, there are roughly 6,000 Armenians in Kuwait.

As a result of the [[Armenian Genocide]], many survivors were forced to first settle in [[the Levant]] including Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and Iraq. In 1958, the first wave of [[Arab nationalism]] appeared in [[Syria]] and Egypt. This did not sit well with the large Armenian communities in these countries. The establishment of the United Arab Republic triggered a mass exodus of Armenians to [[Lebanon]] (from Syria) and to [[Canada]] and [[the United States]] (from Egypt). Some [[Armenians in Syria|Syrian-Armenians]] immigrated to Kuwait, when it was still a [[Mandatory Palestine|British mandate]] then.

==Armenians during the Iraqi invasion==

In August 1990, [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraq declared war on Kuwait]] and invaded its tiny neighbour. During this time, many Kuwaiti-Armenians left for neighbouring Arab countries such as Syria, Lebanon and the Persian Gulf. Other Armenians fled to [[Baghdad]] by car, from where they fled to Syria.

The remaining Armenians were mostly workers with no way of escaping. During the invasion, the Armenian school and church were shut down and guarded in order to stop looters from attacking the institutions. The Armenian institutions remained unscathed during the war.

After the Iraqis were driven out of Kuwait by the coalition forces, the Armenian community had largely diminished to about 500 Armenians. The war also paved the way for a mass exodus of Kuwaiti-Armenians to [[North America]]n countries such as [[Canada]] and [[the United States]].

==Re-establishment of the Kuwaiti-Armenian community==
The Armenian population of Kuwait has slowly grown since the end of the [[First Gulf War]]. Their population number now is around 2,500.

Today, the Armenian school in Kuwait enrolls children from kindergarten to the 12th grade. The school, the only foreign institution which is allowed to incorporate religion into its curriculum, now has nearly 300 students, and a staff of 25 full-time teachers, including 17 Armenians.

This is certainly lower than pre-war levels which had enrollment numbers up to 700 students. The Armenian community is slowly rebuilding to try to bring back its better days of the mid-1980s.

==Religion==
Most of the Armenian population belongs to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and is under the jurisdiction of the [[Holy See of Cilicia]]. Kuwait is part of the Prelacy of Kuwait and the Persian Gulf established by the See of Cilicia (also known as the Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia), with its head office in Kuwait itself.

The '''Assyrians in Finland''' comprises migrants of [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] ancestry and their descendants born in [[Finland]].

==Demographics==
In 2001, there were only 115 [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] in [[Finland]].&lt;ref name=Jeff&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff|title=Taken from Zinda... Assyrians in Finland|date=November 13, 2001 &lt;!-- at 19:12:45 --&gt; |url=http://www.insideassyria.com/archive/3/messages/550.html|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within six years, the number tripled.&lt;ref name="AINA2007"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20071018142453.htm|title=Assyrian Association Founded in Finland|date=18 October 2007|publisher=Assyrian International News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of them living in [[Oulu]],&lt;ref name="AINA2007"/&gt; while other smaller communities are seen in the Finnish capital, [[Helsinki]], and as well in [[Turku]] and [[Jyväskylä]].&lt;ref name=Youkhanna&gt;{{cite news|title=Assyrians in Finland|first=Rol Yacoub|last=Youkhanna|date=1999-05-19|url=http://www.zindamagazine.com/html/archives/1999/apr19_1999.htm|accessdate=2007-03-05|publisher=Zinda Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are mostly refugees from [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]];&lt;ref name=Androw/&gt; this is in contrast to the Assyrian population in neighboring [[Sweden]], where the majority are from [[Turkey]], [[Iraq]], and [[Syria]].

The population is split religiously between [[Assyrian Church of the East|Church of the East]] and [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean Catholic]] members. Chaldean Catholics attend a Catholic church in Oulu where the services are conducted by [[Italian people|Italian]] priests in the [[Finnish language]].&lt;ref name=Youkhanna/&gt;  Church of the East members attend their services in [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches.&lt;ref name=Androw/&gt;

==History==
Assyrians in Finland began arriving noticeably for the first time in 1991.&lt;ref name=Androw&gt;{{cite news|title=Assyrians in Finland|first=Patrous|last=Androw|date=2001-11-12|publisher=Zinda Magazine|url=http://www.zindamagazine.com/html/archives/2001/11.12.01/index.php#TheLighthouse|accessdate=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1994, the community in [[Oulu]] founded the social club "Assyrian Society of Finland", recognized by the Finnish government. The club organizes trips, picnics, and Assyrian cultural events, and holds bi-annual elections. Mr Paulus is the current president of the club.&lt;ref name=Androw/&gt;

==Adaptation==

*Assyrian refugees who enjoy permanent residency status and those who have already obtained [[Finnish nationality law|Finnish citizen]]ship are eligible to vote in the country’s elections. 
*All are required to attend language classes which lasts from three to six months.&lt;ref name=Androw/&gt;
*[[Social services in Finland]] is popular among Finnish Assyrian. They usually go picnics and trips to explore the Finnish culture.&lt;ref name=Jeff /&gt;{

The '''Britain–Australia Society''' was established in 1971 as a friendship society to promote historic links between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]]. It has headquarters in the Australia Centre within [[Australia House]] in [[London]] and branches throughout the [[United Kingdom]].

== History ==

Britons and Australians share a rich heritage of family ties, history, culture, language, sport and business. In 1971 [[Sir Robert Menzies]] and [[Sir Alec Douglas-Home]], former [[Prime Minister]]s of [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]], re-founded the pre-existing Australia Club to form two sister societies based in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] in order to recognise the value of a continuing cultural exchange between the two countries.
Despite being founded by two former [[politician]]s, the societies are apolitical and non-commercial.

== Aims ==
The aims of the Britain–Australia Society are to:
* strengthen existing friendship between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]]
* promote educational exchanges
* arrange social events for members
* provide a point of contact for [[Australians]] visiting the [[United Kingdom]]
* maintain links with Australia

The society provides a comfortable and welcoming forum in which talented youth of both nations are introduced to influential diplomatic and commercial circles to contribute to their personal and professional development.

== Branches ==
Branches are maintained in [[Cambridge]]shire, [[Norfolk]], [[Leicestershire]], [[Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], [[Portsmouth]] and the [http://www.britozwest.org.uk West Country]. Regional functions are held by these branches in addition to centrally-organised activities.

== Events ==
Annual events usually include a Summer Reception, a Garden Party at the residence of His Excellency the [[High Commissioner]] and an after-hours visit to the Tower of London.

Other events have included tutored wine tastings, theatre evenings, cocktail parties, and presentations from noted diplomats and experts.

The West Country branch arranges a number of regional events, including a prestigious annual service of remembrance and lunch in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] honouring the memory of Admiral [[Arthur Phillip]].

A number of ticket ballots and auctions take place for, e.g., tickets to the Wimbledon Championships and flights to Australia.

== Awards ==
The Society grants an occasional Britain-Australia Society Award to recognise a person who has demonstrated a long-term contribution to relations between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]]. Past recipients have been [[Barry Humphries]], [[Lord Hague]], [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[David Attenborough]].

== Officers ==
The '''Patron''' of the Society is [[Prince Philip|HRH The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh KG KT OM GCVO GBE ONZ QSO AK GCL CC CMM]]

Membership of the Society in Britain is limited to 100, excluding Honorary members, and represents a wide range of national interests including senior business and professional people, politicians, civil servants and academics. Membership is by invitation only. The B-AS administers the Cook Society and shares some events.

The '''Chief of Naval Research''' is the senior military officer in charge of scientific research in the [[United States Navy]].  The Chief of Naval Research has a rank of Rear Admiral, and is in charge of the [[Office of Naval Research]].&lt;ref name="USC"&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|10|5022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chief of Naval Research has responsibility for [[basic research]], [[applied research]], and advanced technology development components of the Navy's [[research and development]] programs (the first three of the seven categories used in the Department of Defense research and development budget, often referred to as 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, respectively), as well as the Navy's [[intellectual property]] policy.

Other positions in the Office of Naval Research leadership include the Vice Chief of Naval Research (a one-star admiral), the Assistant Chief of Naval Research and Commanding Officer of ONR Global (both captains), and the Executive Director and Assistant Vice Chief of Naval Research (both civilians).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leadership|url=http://www.onr.navy.mil/About-ONR/Leadership.aspx|publisher=U.S. Office of Naval Research|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chief of Naval Research reports directly to the civilian [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development, and Acquisition)]], and is thus not organizationally subordinate to the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], the senior military officer in the entire Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Navy Organization: The Secretary of the Navy|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/organization/org-sec.asp|publisher=U.S. Navy|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASN(RDA) Overall Structure|url=http://www.secnav.navy.mil/rda/Pages/ASNRDAOrgChart.aspx|publisher=Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition)|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sapolsky2014" /&gt;

==History==
The predecessor to the Office of Naval Research was the Office of the Coordinator of Research and Development, an institution within the Navy during [[World War II]] meant to coordinate between the military-wide [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] (OSRD), [[United States Navy bureau system|Navy materiel bureaus]], and civilian research organizations.  The organization was formed in 1941 and was nicknamed the "Bird Dogs" due to their skill at finding and solving interorganizational problems.  [[Jerome Clarke Hunsaker]] was interim chief, followed by Rear Admiral [[Julius A. Furer]].  OSRD was disbanded after the war, and the Office of the Coordinator of Research and Development was incorporated into the new Navy Office of Research and Inventions, headed by Harold Bowen, which became the Office of Naval Research in 1945.&lt;ref name="OCRD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buderi|first1=Robert|title=Naval innovation for the 21st century : the Office of Naval Research since the end of the Cold War|date=2013|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis|isbn=9781612513065|pages=21–26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWRVAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Migration of '''Chinese people in Ghana''' dates back to the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Ho9" /&gt; Originally, most came from [[Hong Kong]]; migration from [[mainland China]] began only in the 1980s. The number who live in the country remains unclear, with estimates ranging from few thousands to as many as seven hundred thousand.&lt;ref name="Ho9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aosa"/&gt;

==Migration history==
The earliest ethnic Chinese migrants to Ghana were of [[Hong Kong]] origin. They began arriving in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when both territories were still part of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name="Ho9"/&gt; These sojourners stayed in Ghana for periods ranging from a few years to several decades, but they never came to consider Ghana their home.&lt;ref name="Ho46"&gt;{{harvnb|Ho|2008b|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The migrants consisted largely of men who came to Ghana alone and worked as employees in Chinese-owned factories, while their families remained behind in Hong Kong. Originally, they were concentrated in western Ghana, but after Ghana achieved independence, the [[Kwame Nkrumah]] government began implementing plans to promote development in the eastern part of the country, and as a result, they began moving towards Accra and [[Tema]].&lt;ref name="Ho10"/&gt;

Aside from individual migrants, there was also an official contingent from the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) for a brief period in the 1960s. The PRC provided a variety of military assistance to Ghana in the 1960s, including a loan for an arms factory in 1962 (which was never constructed) and the dispatch of military advisors in 1964. After the [[History of Ghana (1966-1979)|1966 coup]] which overthrew Nkrumah's government, Ghana expelled 430 PRC nationals, including three intelligence officers and thirteen guerrilla warfare specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berry|1994|loc=Ch. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, some of the Hong Kong migrants began to bring their wives and children over to Ghana.&lt;ref name="Ho10"/&gt; Migrants from Shanghai also began to arrive round this time.&lt;ref name="Aosa"/&gt; Due to further political unrest in the 1970s and 1980s, including two coups by [[Jerry Rawlings]], many of the Chinese migrants returned to Hong Kong. However, with the economic [[reform and opening up]] in the PRC, migrants from [[mainland China]] began arriving just as the Hong Kong migrants were flowing out. Migration from mainland China intensified in the 1990s; some came as employees, but most were independent traders running import-export businesses or restaurants.&lt;ref name="Ho10"/&gt; The sources of migration have also expanded; whereas earlier migrants came mostly from Hong Kong or Shanghai, later Chinese migrants have arrived from [[Guangdong]] and [[Henan]] as well as the [[Republic of China]] on [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="Aosa"/&gt;

==Business and employment==
The earliest Hong Kong migrants were employed in a variety of industries in Ghana, including a failed [[cultivation of tobacco|tobacco-growing]] venture, a factory in [[Takoradi]] producing cooking implements, and imitation wax print clothing.&lt;ref name="Ho9"/&gt; The owners of these ventures rarely visited Ghana.&lt;ref name="Ho10"/&gt; In the 1990s and 2000s, large Chinese companies became active in Ghana's construction sector, while individual Chinese traders gained a large amount of influence in retailing of textiles, electrical appliances, and daily-use goods.&lt;ref name="VoiceOfAfrica"&gt;{{citation|title=China and India conquering Ghana market|url=http://voicesofafrica.africanews.com/site/China_and_India_conquering_Ghana_market/list_messages/17593|periodical=Voices of Africa|date=2008-04-19|accessdate=2009-04-06|last=Ameyaw|first=Debra|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901185506/http://voicesofafrica.africanews.com/site/China_and_India_conquering_Ghana_market/list_messages/17593|archive-date=2011-09-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Ghana Investment Promotion Act of 1994, any foreigner can open a retail business with an investment of [[United States dollar|US$]]300,000, as long as it employs 10 local citizens, subject to maintenance of a certain minimum volume of trade.&lt;ref name="IPS"&gt;{{citation|title=Ghana: 'You Have To Speak Up When Competition Destroys You'|last=Kokutse|first=Francis|periodical=[[Inter Press Service]]|date=2008-07-31|accessdate=2009-04-06|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=43396|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121075327/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=43396|archive-date=2009-01-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohnert11"&gt;{{harvnb|Kohnert|2010|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, other Chinese are engaged in small-scale [[gold mining]], as well as providing funding and [[heavy equipment (construction)|heavy equipment]] to other miners.&lt;ref name="Kohnert11"/&gt;

==Integration and community==
[[File:Ghanaian Chinese and Taxicab Driver in Ghana (Chinese In Ghana, Africa).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Chinese [[Taxicab driver|taking taxi in Ghana]]|alt=Chinese taking taxi in Ghana]]
The Chinese population in Ghana itself are largely transitory, and there is some resistance among them to the idea that they belong to a "community". Most of the migrants came with the intention of seeing the world and making money, rather than settling down in Ghana.&lt;ref name="Ho46"/&gt; In order to obtain Ghanaian nationality, one must be married to a citizen of Ghana or be able to speak and understand one of the indigenous [[languages of Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNHCR|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese who have lived in Ghana for most of their lives have acquired [[Ghanaian nationality law|Ghanaian citizenship]], which is granted without any discrimination.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Local traders have protested against the influx of Chinese traders selling imported goods, and accuse them of breaking investment laws.&lt;ref name="IPS"/&gt; In late 2007, local traders organised protests in Accra which accused the Chinese of unfair competition and trading in fields for which they were not qualified.&lt;ref name="VoiceOfAfrica"/&gt; In turn, Chinese migrants complain of arbitrary treatment by Ghana's police. On one day in February 2009, officers of the [[Ghana Immigration Service|Immigration Department]] arrested over 100 Chinese people in a single day, allegedly without any pretext; in response, forty-one Chinese businesspeople signed an open letter of protest to the Immigration Department. They attributed the sudden crackdown to the government's desire to protect local merchants in the face of the worsening economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/20090402/17236059098.shtml|periodical=Sina News|title=金融危机来袭非洲华商近况堪忧|date=2009-04-02|accessdate=2009-04-06|last=Yan|first=Shanjun|last2=Zhang|first2=Yaoqing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically, the word dalak is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''dalaka'' which means to rub. Their preferred self-designation is now '''Salmani''', as the word ''dalak'' is seen as offensive, and the community were traditionally associated with the profession of barbering.&lt;ref&gt;The Mongols of Afghanistan : an ethnography of the Moghols and related peoples of Afghanistan by Schurmann, H. F. pages 225 to 227&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

The principal function of the Dalak is cutting hair, circumcision, the performance of music at certain events such as marriages for their patrons and carrying out certain minor surgical operations. Littler is known about the origin of the Dalak, but a possible connection with the [[Jot (ethnic group)|Afghan Jat]] cannot be ruled. Unlike the Jat, who are nomadic, the Dalak are essentially a settled urban community, with settlements in [[Herat]], mainly in the neighbourhood of Kurt, and in [[Chisht]] as well as other towns of western Afghanistan. A claim is now being made that they are descended from [[Salman the Persian|Salman Al Farsi]], a [[Sahabah]] of the Prophet Mohammad, hence the new name Salmani meaning a descendent of Salman.&lt;ref&gt;The Mongols of Afghanistan : an ethnography of the Moghols and related peoples of Afghanistan by Schurmann, H. F. pages 225 to 227&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer months, the Dalak leave their urban settlements and visit various villages, where they perform circumcision, entertain at weddings, cut hair and occasional perform agriculture labour. A patron client relationship exists with the local sedentary population. Historically, they were given in grain in return for their services, but increasingly they are now being paid cash. Their patrons belong mainly to the [[Aimaq people|Aimaq]], [[Tajik people|Tajik]] and [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] communities, and their culture is not dissimilar to the other [[Dari Persian|Dari]] speaking communities. However, there is virtually no intermarriage between the Dalak and neighbouring ethnic groups, and as a community they are strictly [[endogamy|endogamous]]. The Dalak are [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s, although they incorporate folk beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;The Mongols of Afghanistan : an ethnography of the Moghols and related peoples of Afghanistan by Schurmann, H. F. pages 225 to 227&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Austria]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

[[Austrians]] are a homogeneous people, although four decades of strong immigration from other parts of Europe have significantly changed the composition of the population of Austria.

According to the 2001 population census, 88.6% are native [[German language|German]] speakers (96% [[Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian dialects]] and 4% [[Alemannic German|Alemanic dialects]]) while the remaining 11.4% speak several minority languages. The non-German speakers of Austria can be divided into two groups: traditional minorities, who are related to territories formerly part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], and new minorities, resulting from recent immigration.

==[[Total Fertility Rate]] from 1870 to 1899==
The [[Total fertility rate|total fertility rate]] is the number of children born per woman. It is based on fairly good data for the entire period in the present-day Hungary.

There are 185,000 Turks, including Turkish Kurds, in Austria today, accounting for 2.2% of the population. This is the third largest ethnic minority after Serbs and Federal Germans (2.7%).&lt;ref name="WPR 2018"/&gt;

There are three "traditional" ethnic minorities within Austria that have found themselves within Austria as a result of European boundary changes over the years. They are Carthinian Slovenes, Croats and Hungarians.&lt;ref name="WPR 2018"/&gt;

Modern immigration has resulted in the creation of a number of sizeable new ethic groups in Austria. Notably more than 300,000 people came to Austria from the former Yugoslavia during and after the wars there, as well as more than 300,000 from Turkey.&lt;ref name="WPR 2018"/&gt;

The number of people living in Austria but born elsewhere increased by 35% over the past decade. Austria estimates that 81% of its population had no migration background, while about 19% had at least one parent of migrant background. There are estimated to be 415,000 descendants of foreign-born immigrants in the country.&lt;ref name="WPR 2018"/&gt;

The majority of Austrians (73.6%) in the 2001 census reported that they were Roman Catholic. Protestants made up a further 4.7% of the population and Muslims 4.2%. 12% of respondents said that they were not religious.&lt;ref name="WPR 2018"/&gt;

==Ethnic groups==
===Traditional ethnic minorities in Austria===
Only three numerically significant traditional minority groups exist – 14,000 [[Carinthian Slovenes]] (according to the 2001 census – unofficial estimates of Slovene organisations put the number at 50,000) in Austrian [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] (south central Austria) and about 25,000 [[Burgenland Croats|Croats]] and 20,000 [[Hungarians]] in [[Burgenland]] (on the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] border). The Slovenes (also called 'Windische') form a closely knit community. Their rights as well as those of the Croats are protected by law and generally respected in practice. The present boundaries of Austria, once the center of the [[Habsburg Empire]] that constituted the second-largest state in Europe, were established in accordance with the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] in 1919. Some Austrians, particularly near [[Vienna]], still have relatives in countries that made up the Monarchy, namely Croatia, [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], Slovenia and Hungary.

===New ethnic minorities in Austria===
[[Image:COB data Austria.PNG|400px|right|thumb]]
According to the Austrian Statistical Bureau, 814,800 foreigners legally lived in Austria in mid-2006, representing 9.8% of the total population, one of the highest rates in Europe.

Of these foreign residents, 305,100 came from the [[former Yugoslavia]] and 110,800 from [[Turkey]].

Owing to a growing naturalization rate, 330,000 people have been naturalized between 1985 and the end of 2003, representing about 4% of the 7.4 million Austrian citizens living today in the country.

Of these new citizens 110,000 came from the former Yugoslavia and 90,000 from Turkey. Considering pre-1985 naturalizations, in 2005 at least 18% (in Vienna more than 30%) of the population was either foreign or of foreign origin. Native Austrians have had stagnant demographics since World War I, and have been in absolute decline since the 1970s.

===Immigration===

As of 2011, Statistik Austria official estimates have shown that 81% of residents, or 6.75 million&lt;ref name="medienservicestelle.at"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medienservicestelle.at/migration_bewegt/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IBIB_2012_Integrationsbericht.pdf|format=PDF|title=STATISTIK AUSTRIA Kommission für Migrations - und Integrationsforschung der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Wien 2012|page=23|website=Medienservicestelle.at|accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; had no migration background and more than 19% or 1.6 million inhabitants&lt;ref name="medienservicestelle.at"/&gt; had at least one parent of immigrant background.{{clarify|date=August 2015}} There are more than 415,000 descendants of foreign-born immigrants&lt;ref name="medienservicestelle.at"/&gt; residing in Austria, the great majority of whom have been naturalized.

According to [[Eurostat]], there were 1.27 million foreign-born residents in Austria in 2010, corresponding to 15.2% of the total population. Of these, 764,000 (9.1%) were born outside the EU and 512,000 (6.1%) were born in another EU member state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://immigration-to.net76.net/immigration-to-australia.htm 6.5% of the EU population are foreigners and 9.4% are born abroad], Eurostat, Katya VASILEVA, 34/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about 3% of the total population, they make up the biggest single ethnic minority in Austria.

In 2001, about 74% of Austria's population were registered as Roman Catholic,&lt;ref name="Volkszählung"&gt;{{cite web | title=Census 2001: Population 2001 according to religious affiliation and nationality|url=http://www.statistik.at/web_de/static/bevoelkerung_2001_nach_religionsbekenntnis_und_staatsangehoerigkeit_022894.pdf|accessdate=17 December 2007|language=German|publisher=Statistik Austria|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; while about 5% considered themselves [[Protestant]]s.&lt;ref name="Volkszählung" /&gt; Austrian Christians, both Catholic and Protestant,&lt;ref&gt;Tax is only mandatory for [[Lutherans]] and [[Reformed]].&lt;/ref&gt; are obliged to pay a mandatory membership fee (calculated by income—about 1%) to their church; this payment is called "Kirchenbeitrag" ("Ecclesiastical/Church contribution"). Since the second half of the 20th century, the number of adherents and churchgoers has declined. Data for the end of 2016 from the Austrian Roman Catholic church lists 5,162,622 members, or 58.8% of the total Austrian population. Sunday [[church attendance]] was 605,828 or 7% of the total Austrian population in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katholisch.at/statistik|title=Katholische Kirche Österreichs, Statistik|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lutheran church also recorded a loss of 74,421 adherents between 2001 and 2016.

{{Rights}}

The '''disability rights movement''' is a global&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Disability Rights|url=https://dredf.org/legal-advocacy/international-disability-rights/|website=Disability Rights Education &amp; Defense Fund|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Beverly|title=The Global Disability Rights Movement: Winning Power, Participation, and Access|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/beverly-bell/the-global-disability-rig_b_5651235.html|accessdate=18 October 2017|work=Huffington Post|date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[new social movements|social movement]] to secure [[equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] and [[equality before the law|equal rights]] for all people with [[disability|disabilities]].

It is made up of organizations of [[List of disability rights activists|disability activists]] around the world working together with similar goals and demands, such as: [[accessibility]] and [[safety]] in architecture, transportation, and the physical environment; [[equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] in independent living, [[employment equity]], [[right to education|education]], and [[right to housing|housing]]; and freedom from discrimination, [[abuse]], [[neglect]], and from other rights violations.&lt;ref name="disabilityrightswi.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityrightswi.org/priority-issues/abuse-neglect-and-patient-rights|title=Abuse, Neglect and Patient Rights by the Disability Rights Wisconsin website|author=Alex Szele|work=Disability Rights Wisconsin|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disability activists are working to break institutional, physical, and societal barriers that prevent people with disabilities from living their lives like other citizens.&lt;ref name="disabilityrightswi.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bagenstos | first = Samuel | title = Law and the Contradictions of the Disability Rights Movement | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-300-12449-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disability barriers ==
The [[social model of disability]] suggests disability is caused by the way society is organized, rather than by a person’s impairment. This model suggests barriers in society are created by [[ableism]]. When barriers are removed, people with disabilities can be independent and equal in society.

There are three main types of barriers:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/report.pdf|title=World Report on Disability|last=|first=|date=2011|website=|publisher=WHO|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Attitudinal barriers:''' are created by people who see only disability when associating with people with disabilities in some way. These attitudinal barriers can be witnessed through bullying, discrimination, and fear. These barriers include low expectations of people with disabilities. These barriers contribute to all other barriers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.make-development-inclusive.org/docsen/DFIDdisabilityPovertyDev.pdf|title=Disability Poverty and Development|last=|first=|date=2000|website=|publisher=DFID|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/SWCR2013_ENG_Lo_res_24_Apr_2013.pdf|title=Children with Disabilities|last=|first=|date=2013|website=|publisher=UNICEF|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attitudes towards people with disabilities in low and middle-income countries can be even more extreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.add.org.uk/reports-resources/voices-marginalised|title=Voices of the Marginalised|last=|first=|date=2014–2016|website=ADD International|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Environmental barriers:''' inaccessible environments, natural or built, create disability by creating barriers to inclusion.
# '''Institutional barriers:''' include many laws, policies, practices, or strategies that discriminate against people with disabilities. For example, a study of five Southeast Asian countries found that electoral laws do not specially protect the political rights of persons with disabilities, while ‘some banks do not allow visually disabled people to open accounts, and HIV testing centers often refuse to accept sign language interpreters due to confidentiality policies’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eaccess.s3.amazonaws.com/media/attachments/resources_publication/3/Accessible%20Elections%20for%20Persons%20with%20Disabilities.pdf|title=Accessible Elections for persons with disabilities in five Southeast Asian countries|last=|first=|date=2013|website=|publisher=USAID|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictive laws exist in some countries, particularly affecting people with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbm.org/article/downloads/54741/CBM-DID-TOOLKIT-accessible.pdf|title=Disability Inclusive Development Toolkit|last=Ju'beh|first=Al|date=|website=2015|publisher=CBM|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other barriers include: internalised barriers (low expectations of people with disabilities can undermine their confidence and aspirations), inadequate data and statistics, lack of participation and consultation of disabled people.

== Issues ==

===People with physical disabilities===
Access to public areas such as city streets, public buildings, and restrooms are some of the more visible changes brought about in recent decades to remove physical barriers. A noticeable change in some parts of the world is the installation of [[elevator]]s, automatic doors, wide doors and corridors, transit [[Elevator|lifts]], [[wheelchair ramp]]s, [[curb cut]]s, and the elimination of unnecessary steps where ramps and elevators are not available, allowing people in [[wheelchair]]s and with other mobility disabilities to use public sidewalks and [[public transit]] more easily and safely.

====People with visual disabilities====
[[File:Coloradd.png|thumb|left|Code Signs for People with CVD]]
{{main article|Color_blindness#Society_and_culture|l1=Problems for the Color Blind in Society}}
People with [[color vision deficiency]] (CVD) regularly deal with implicit discrimination due to their inability to distinguish certain colors. A system of geometrically shaped code signs known as [[Coloradd]] was developed by [[Professor]] Miguel Neiva of the [[University of Minho]], [[Portugal]] in 2010 to indicate colours to people who have difficulty discerning them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.dn.pt/cartaz/designcriativo/interior/coloradd-o-codigo-de-cores-para-daltonicos-1527180.html |title=ColorAdd®, o código de cores para daltónicos |accessdate=14 September 2013 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310153451/https://www.dn.pt/cartaz/designcriativo/interior/coloradd-o-codigo-de-cores-para-daltonicos-1527180.html |archivedate=10 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been adopted rapidly by numerous businesses to boost sales.

===People with developmental disabilities===
Advocates for the rights of people with [[developmental disabilities]] focus their efforts on gaining acceptance in the [[workforce]] and in everyday activities and events from which they might have been excluded in the past. Unlike many of the leaders in the physical disability rights community, [[self-advocacy]] has been slow in developing for people with developmental disabilities. As a result, much of the work done by the Disability Rights Movement was completed by allies, or those without disabilities but with a strong connection to someone with disabilities. Parents, friends, and siblings fought for education and acceptance when their loved ones with cognitive disabilities could not.&lt;ref&gt;"The Disability Rights and Independent Living Movements." The Virginia Navigator, 23 Mar. 2013. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Public awareness of the civil rights movement for this population remains limited, and the stereotyping of people with developmental disabilities as non-contributing citizens who are dependent on others remains common. Today, the movement has a more social focus to increase this public awareness, as evidenced by the "R-Word" Campaign, in which they try to eliminate the colloquial use of the word "retard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.r-word.org/|title=R-word - Spread the Word to End the Word|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== People with mental health issues ===
Advocates for the rights of people with [[mental disorder|mental health disabilities]] focus mainly on [[self-determination]], and an individual’s ability to live independently.&lt;ref name="Protests"&gt;{{cite book | last =Barnartt and Scotch | first = Sharon N. and Richard | title = Disability Protests: Contentious Politics 1970-1999| publisher = Gallaudet University Press| location = Washington, D.C.| year = 2001 | isbn = 978-1-56368-112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to have an [[Independent Living|independent life]], using paid assistant care instead of being [[institutionalisation|institutionalized]], if the individual wishes, is a major goal of the disability rights movement, and is the main goal of the similar [[independent living]] and [[self-advocacy]] movements, which are most strongly associated with people with [[intellectual disabilities]] and [[mental health]] disorders. These movements have supported people with disabilities to live as more active participants in society.&lt;ref name="Mobilizing"&gt;{{cite book | last =Johnson | first = Roberta Ann | title = Mobilizing the Disabled, in Waves of Protest: Social Movements Since the Sixties, pp.&amp;nbsp;25–45| publisher = Rowman and Littlefield | location = Maryland| year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-8476-8748-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Access to education and employment ===
Access to [[education]] and [[employment]] have also been a major focus of the disability rights movement. [[Adaptive technology|Adaptive technologies]], enabling people to work jobs they could not have previously, help create access to jobs and economic [[independence]]. Access in the classroom has helped improve [[education]] opportunities and independence for people with disabilities.

=== Freedom from discrimination and abuse ===
Freedom from abuse, neglect, and violations of a person's rights are also important goals of the disability rights movement. Abuse and neglect includes inappropriate seclusion and restraint, inappropriate use of force by staff and/or providers, threats, harassment and/or retaliation by staff or providers, failure to provide adequate nutrition, clothing, and/or medical and mental health care, and/or failure to provide a clean and safe living environment, as well as other issues which pose a serious threat to the physical and psychological well-being of a person with a disability. Violations of patients' rights include failure to obtain informed consent for treatment, failure to maintain the confidentiality of treatment records, and inappropriate restriction of the right to communicate and associate with others, as well as other restrictions of rights.

As a result of the work done through the disability rights movement, significant disability rights legislation was passed in the 1970s through the 1990s in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Zames1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fleischer | first = Doris | title = The Disability Rights Movement | publisher = Temple University Press | location = Philadelphia | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-56639-812-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the UK===
[[File:Scottish Parliament. Protest March 30, 2013 - 03.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Disability rights activist outside [[Scottish Parliament]], 30 March 2013]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], following extensive activism by people with disabilities over several decades, the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] (DDA 1995) was passed. This made it unlawful in the United Kingdom to discriminate against people with disabilities in relation to employment, the provision of goods and services, education and transport. The [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] provides support for this Act. Equivalent legislation exists in [[Northern Ireland]], which is enforced by the [[Northern Ireland Equality Commission]].

Following the introduction of the Bedroom Tax (officially the [[Under-occupancy penalty]]) in the [[Welfare Reform Act 2012]], disability activists have played a significant role in the development of [[Bedroom Tax protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wynne-Jones|first=Ros|title=Bedroom tax protesters deliver letters on devastating effect on disabled people's lives|journal=Daily Mirror|date=17 July 2013|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/bedroom-tax-protesters-deliver-letters-2057883|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of benefit changes are estimated to affect disabled people disproportionately and to compromise disabled people's right to independent living.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/03/limited-life-chances-of-disabled-people-in-britain-revealed-by-damning-report  Limited life chances of disabled people in Britain revealed by damning report] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the US===
{{Further information|Timeline of disability rights in the United States}}
{{Further information|Suffrage for Americans with Disabilities}}

The disability rights movement began in the 1960s,&lt;ref name="'70s 250"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|coauthors= |year= 2001|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= |pages=250–251 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; encouraged by the examples of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and [[Second-wave feminism|women’s rights movements]].&lt;ref name="no pity"&gt;{{cite book |title= No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement |last= Shapiro|first= Joseph P. |year= 1993|publisher= Times Books|isbn= 978-0-8129-2412-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at this time that disability rights advocacy began to have a cross-disability focus. People with different kinds of disabilities (physical and mental disabilities, along with visual and hearing disabilities) and different essential needs came together to fight for a common cause.&lt;ref name="Law"/&gt;

In 1948, a watershed for the movement was the proof of the existence of physical and program barriers. The proof was provided as a specification for barrier free usable facilities for people with disabilities. The specifications provided the minimum requirements for barrier free physical and program access. An example of barriers are; providing only steps to enter buildings; lack of maintenance of walkways; locations not connected with public transit; lack of visual and hearing communications ends up segregating individuals with disabilities from independent, participation, and opportunities. The ANSI - Barrier Free Standard  (phrase coined by Dr. [[Timothy J. Nugent]], the lead investigator) called "ANSI A117.1, Making Buildings Accessible to and Usable by the Physically Handicapped", provides the indisputable proof that the barriers exist. It is based on disability ergonomic research conducted at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign campus from 1946 to 1986. The research was codified in the ANSI A117.1 standard in 1961, 1971, 1980, and 1986. The standard is the outcome of physical therapists, bio-mechanical engineers, and individuals with disabilities who developed and participated in over 40 years of research. Easter Seals Education Committee Chairman Harold Wilke was tasked with assembling that diverse group in 1959. The standard provides the criteria for modifying programs and the physical site to provide independence. Applying the researched standards criteria presents reliable access and non-hazardous conditions. In October 2011 the standard turned 50 years old. The standard has been emulated globally since its introduction in Europe, Asia, Japan, Australia, and Canada, in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.illinois.edu/archives/archon/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&amp;id=5724 Timothy J.

One of the most important developments of the disability rights movement was the growth of the [[independent living movement]], which emerged in [[California]] in the 1960s through the efforts of [[Ed Roberts (activist)|Edward Roberts]] and other wheelchair-using individuals. This movement, a subset of the disability rights movement, postulates that people with disabilities are the best experts on their needs, and therefore they must take the initiative, individually and collectively, in designing and promoting better solutions and must organize themselves for political power. Besides de-professionalization and self-representation, the independent living movement's ideology comprises de-medicalization of disability, de-institutionalization and cross-disability (i.e. inclusion in the independent living movement regardless of diagnoses).&lt;ref name="Law"/&gt; Similarly, The Architectural Barriers Act was passed in 1968, mandating that federally constructed buildings and facilities be accessible to people with physical disabilities. This act is generally considered to be the first ever-federal disability rights legislation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drckansas.org/disability-awareness-project/HistoryofDisabilityRightsinKSandUS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for those with cognitive disabilities, their disability made it more difficult to be the best expert of their own needs, hindering their ability to self-advocate as their wheelchair-using counterparts could. Self-representation was much more difficult for those who could not articulate their thoughts, leading to their dependence on others to carry on the movement.

In 1973 the (American) [[Rehabilitation Act]] became law; Sections 501, 503, and 504 prohibited discrimination in federal programs and services and all other programs or services receiving federal funds. Key language in the Rehabilitation Act, found in Section 504, states “No otherwise qualified handicapped ''[sic]'' individual in the United States, shall, solely by reason of his ''[sic]'' handicap ''[sic]'', be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/drilm/resources/timeline.html|title=The Regents of the University of California. 2008.

Another crucial turning point was the [[504 Sit-in]] in 1977 of government buildings operated by the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW), conceived by [[Frank Bowe]] and organized by the [[American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities]],&lt;ref name="'70s 250"/&gt; that led to the release of regulations pursuant to Section 504 of the [[Rehabilitation Act]] of 1973. On April 5, 1977, activists began to demonstrate and some sat-in in the offices found in ten of the federal regions including New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, Denver, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Atlanta. The two most noteworthy protests occurred in San Francisco and Washington, D.C. The protesters demanded the signing of regulations for Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.&lt;ref name="Protests" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zames1"/&gt; There were about 300 people in Washington, D.C. who marched to and then demonstrated inside the HEW building where Secretary [[Joseph Califano]]’s office was. He was the person who was to sign the regulations, but was delaying the process. Although he met with a few protest representatives, including [[Frank Bowe]], he still did not sign. This action led many protesters to continue their sit-in overnight, but they then left after 28 hours.&lt;ref name="Protests"/&gt; The more successful sit-in occurred in San Francisco, led by [[Judith Heumann]].&lt;ref name="disabilityhistory.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityhistory.org/people.html#heumann|title=Disability Social History Project, article title Famous (and not-so-famous) People with Disabilities|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first day of protests marked the first of a 25-day sit-in. Close to 120 disability activists and protesters occupied the HEW building. Califano finally signed on April 28, 1977. This protest was significant not only because its goal was achieved, but also because it was the foremost concerted effort between people of different disabilities coming together in support of legislation that affected the overall disability population, rather than only specific groups.&lt;ref name="Protests"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zames1"/&gt;  Prior to the 1990 enactment of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]], the [[Rehabilitation Act]] was the most important disability rights legislation in the United States.&lt;ref name="Mobilizing"/&gt;

In 1978 disability rights activists in Denver, Colorado, organized by the [[Atlantis Community]], held a sit-in and blockade of the Denver Regional Transit Authority buses in 1978. They were protesting the fact that city’s transit system was completely inaccessible for the physically disabled. This action proved to be just the first in a series of civil disobedience demonstrations that lasted for a year until the Denver Transit Authority finally bought buses equipped with wheelchair lifts. In 1983, [[ADAPT|Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transit (ADAPT)]] was responsible for another civil disobedience campaign also in Denver that lasted seven years. They targeted the American Public Transport Association in protest of inaccessible public transportation; this campaign ended in 1990 when bus lifts for people using wheelchairs were required nationwide by the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]].&lt;ref name="Berkeley"/&gt;

Another significant protest related to disability rights was the [[Deaf President Now]] protest by the [[Gallaudet University]] students in Washington, D.C. in March 1988. The 8-day (March 6 – March 13) demonstration and occupation and lock-out of the school began when the Board of Trustees appointed a new hearing President, Elisabeth Zinser, over two Deaf candidates. The students’ primary grievance was that the university, which was dedicated to the education of people who are Deaf, had never had a Deaf president, someone representative of them. Of the protesters’ four demands, the main one was the resignation of the current president and the appointment of a Deaf one. The demonstration consisted of about 2,000 student and nonstudent participants. The protests took place on campus, in government buildings, and in the streets. In the end, all the students’ demands were met and [[I. King Jordan]] was appointed the first Deaf President of the university.&lt;ref name="Zames1"/&gt;

In 1990, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] became law, and it provided comprehensive civil rights protection for people with disabilities. Closely modeled after the Civil Rights Act and Section 504, the law was the most sweeping disability rights legislation in American history. It mandated that local, state, and federal governments and programs be accessible, that employers with more than 15 employees make “[[reasonable accommodation]]s” for workers with disabilities and not discriminate against otherwise qualified workers with disabilities, and that public accommodations such as restaurants and stores not discriminate against people with disabilities and that they make reasonable modifications to ensure access for disabled members of the public. The act also mandated access in public transportation, communication, and in other areas of public life.

The first [[Disability Pride Parades|Disability Pride March]] in the United States was held in Boston in 1990. A second Disability Pride March was held in Boston in 1991. There were no subsequent Disability Pride Marches/Parades for many years, until Chicago on Sunday, July 18, 2004.&lt;ref name="disabilityprideparade.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityprideparade.com/history/History04.php|title=The Inaugural International Disability Pride Parade Unified in Pride Sunday, July 18, 2004 Chicago, Illinois|publisher=www.disabilityprideparade.com|date=|accessdate=July 11, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215148/http://www.disabilityprideparade.com/history/History04.php|archivedate=October 4, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.itodaynews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itodaynews.com/2012-issues/june2012/disability-pride.htm|title=Disability Pride Fast Becoming Genuine Cause for Celebration  |publisher=www.itodaynews.com |date= |accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was funded with $10,000 in seed money that Sarah Triano received in 2003 as part of the Paul G. Hearne Leadership award from the [[American Association of People with Disabilities]].&lt;ref name="http://www.itodaynews.com"/&gt; According to Triano, fifteen hundred people attended the parade.&lt;ref name="http://www.itodaynews.com"/&gt; Yoshiko Dart was the parade marshal.&lt;ref name="disabilityprideparade.com"/&gt;

==Exhibitions and collections==
To mark the 10th anniversary of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Museum of American History]] opened an exhibition that examined the history of activism by people with disabilities, their friends, and families to secure the civil rights guaranteed to all Americans. Objects on view included the pen President [[George H.W. Bush]] used to sign the Act and one of the first ultralight [[wheelchair]]s. The exhibition was designed for maximum accessibility. Web-based kiosks - prototypes for a version that will eventually be available to museums and other cultural institutions - provided alternate formats to experience the exhibition. The exhibition was open from July 6, 2000 to July 23, 2001.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/disabilityrights/ |title=The Disability Rights Movement |publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|a philosophy of non-agreement}}
[[Image:Dissent develops democracy sticker.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sticker art]] arguing that dissent is necessary for [[democracy]].]]

'''Dissent''' is a sentiment or philosophy of non-agreement or opposition to a prevailing [[idea]] (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;a [[government]]'s [[policies]]) or an [[entity]] (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;an [[individual]] or [[political party]] which supports such policies). The term's [[antonyms]] include ''[[Wikt:agreement|agreement]]'', ''[[consensus]]'' (when all or nearly all parties agree on something) and ''[[consent]]'', when one party agrees to a proposition made by another.

In some [[political systems]], dissent may be formally expressed by way of [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition politics]], while [[political repression|politically repressive]] regimes may prohibit any form of dissent, leading to suppression of dissent and the encouragement of social or political [[activism]]. Individuals who do not conform or support the policies of certain states are known as "[[dissident]]s". Several thinkers have argued that a healthy society needs not only to protect, but also to encourage dissent.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Gordon ''Ideology: Structuring Identities in Contemporary Life'', p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Kozol|Kozol, J.]] (1981) Foreword. In Mackie, R. (Ed.), ''Literacy and revolution: The Pedagogy of Paulo Freire''. p. XV&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1843 letter to [[Arnold Ruge]], [[Karl Marx]] wrote: "if constructing the future and settling everything for all times are not our affair, it is all the more clear what we have to accomplish at present: I am referring to ruthless criticism of all that exists, ruthless both in the sense of not being afraid of the results it arrives at and in the sense of being just as little afraid of conflict with the powers that be".&lt;ref&gt;Marx to Ruge. Kreuznach, September 1843. Letter from the ''[[Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher]]''. ([http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/letters/43_09.htm Marxists.org]) as cited in [[Wilhelm Reich]] (1936) prefaction to ''[[Die Sexualität im Kulturkampf]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecopreneurship''' is a term coined to represent the process of principles of entrepreneurship being applied to create businesses that solve environmental problems or operate sustainably. The term began to be widely used in the 1990s, and it is otherwise referred to as "environmental entrepreneurship." In the book &lt;u&gt;Merging Economic and Environmental Concerns Through Ecopreneurship&lt;/u&gt;, written by Gwyn Schuyler in 1998, ecopreneurs are defined as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Ecopreneurs are entrepreneurs whose business efforts are not only driven by profit, but also by a concern for the environment. Ecopreneurship, also known as environmental entrepreneurship and eco-capitalism, is becoming more widespread as a new market-based approach to identifying opportunities for improving environmental quality and capitalizing upon them in the private sector for profit.'' "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Merging Economic and Environmental Concerns Through Ecopreneurship|last=Schuyler|first=Gwen|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Although ecopreneurship initiatives can span a wide range of issues from ocean pollution to recycling to food waste, they tend to follow reoccurring environmental principles such as systems thinking, cradle to cradle product design, triple bottom line accounting, etc.

== Systems thinking ==
Systems Thinking is a core principle to any business concerned with sustainability and the environment. It is an approach to problem solving that studies how something interacts with its environment as a whole, whether that be social, economic or natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thinking.net/Systems_Thinking/Intro_to_ST/intro_to_st.html|title=Intro to Systems Thinking|last=Aronson|first=Dan|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to a linear thinking model, which would isolate a problem and study only its directly related processes to find solutions. It consists of the notion that in order to understand vertical problems (looking deeply at one particular issue), you must understand and evaluate the horizontal environment as a whole (the entire system and its interrelated functions). As it pertains to business is best illustrated in the book &lt;u&gt;Entrepreneurship and Sustainability&lt;/u&gt; by Andrea Larsen,&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Systems thinking applied to new ventures reminds us that companies operate in complex sets of interlocking living and non-living, including markets and supply chains as well as non-living systems.... Taking a systems perspective reminds us that we are accustomed to thinking of business in terms of discrete units with clear boundaries between them. We forget that these boundaries exist primarily in our minds or as legal constructs."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Strategy and the Environment|last=Larson|first=Andrea|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=304–317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Product design ==
A lot of companies using ecopreneurship principles incorporate sustainable product design. Product design incorporating sustainability can happen at any stage of the business, including material extraction, logistics, the manufacturing process, disposal, etc. Sustainable product design can be achieved using innovative technology (or [[Eco-innovation]]), cradle to cradle design, bio-mimicry, etc. In a description by the government of Canada's department on Innovation, Science and Economic Development, sustainable product design is further explained:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Product design offers the opportunity to incorporate green and socially responsible attributes into a product. Referred to as Design for Sustainability (D4S), it is a process that addresses environmental and social considerations in the earliest stages of the product development process to minimize negative environmental and social impacts throughout the product's life cycle and to comply with the principles of economic, social and ecological sustainability.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''Sustainable product design can encompass the selection of materials, use of resources, production requirements and planning for the final disposition (recycling, reuse, remanufacturing, or disposal) of a product. It takes into account the socio-economic circumstances of the company and the opportunity for the firm to address social problems associated with poverty, safety, inequity, health and the working environment. It is not a stand-alone methodology but one that must be integrated with a company's existing product design so that environmental and social parameters can be integrated with traditional product attributes such as quality, cost, and functionality''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/dsib-dsib.nsf/eng/h_oq01800.html|title=Product Design, Research and Development|last=|first=|date=|website=Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Some examples of ways to implement sustainable product design include:
* streamline design - use fewer materials, find sustainable material substitutes
* procure materials sustainability - choose resources whose extraction is not harmful to the surrounding environment and use the most Eco-friendly extraction methods
* reduce materials - reducing material weight or transportation volume
* optimize production - use production techniques with as little as possible harmful environmental side effects like toxic chemical release, reduce waste and emissions
* improve distribution - use less or reusable packaging, transport and distribute products more efficiently
* cut impact - reduce energy consumption, use cleaner energy sources like solar panels or wind power.
* prolong life - improve durability and reliability of product, offer repair services, re-purpose broken or unused products
* manage waste - implement recycling or reuse programs, up-cycle product, dispose of safely

=== Innovative Technology ===
Many companies practicing ecopreneurship attempt to solve environmental issues either by developing new technology or innovating already existing technologies. The most widespread examples of this are the creation of [[solar panels]] and [[hybrid cars]] in order to decrease dependency on fossil fuels. Countless other examples from [[anaerobic digestion]] food waste systems to portable air purifiers exist. The competitive advantage or core competency for ecopreneurship companies is oftentimes related to a technology they have developed. More examples of companies using innovative technology are below in Business Examples.

=== Cradle to Cradle Design ===
[[Cradle-to-cradle design]] is popular environmental approach to product design that seeks to eliminate waste by designing products that can be continuously recirculated through our economy. This is contrasted against a "cradle to grave" design which typically includes single use products or products made of multiple different materials that cannot be separated in order to be recycled properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things|last=McDonough|first=William|publisher=North Point Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=27–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cradle to Cradle design is mimicked after processes in the natural environment which do not create waste but instead every output is an input for another organism. Cradle to Cradle design is often achieved through using environmentally friendly resources (non-toxic) that can either be recycled into other products or composted. Another important component of cradle to cradle design is the ability to easily take products apart for better reuse as well as designing with durability in mind. This idea was popularized by the 2002 book &lt;u&gt;Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things&lt;/u&gt; written by [[William McDonough]] and [[Michael Braungart]].

==== Bio-mimicry ====
Bio-mimicry (or [[Biomimetics]]) is a term created by American biophysicist Otto Schmitt that refers to recreating the solutions for problems found in nature. A definition provided by the [http://www.biomimicry.org Institute for Biomimicry] (a non-profit organization) is as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Biomimicry is an approach to innovation that seeks sustainable solutions to human challenges by emulating nature's time tested patterns and strategies."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Some examples include studying the building of sand mounds by ants in order to create lower cost air circulation for buildings and trains with curved fronts mimicking the beaks of  birds to increase speed. Other examples can be found in [[Janine Benyus]]' Ted Talk on [https://www.ted.com/talks/janine_benyus_biomimicry_in_action?language=en biomimicry].

== Triple bottom line accounting ==
[[Triple bottom line]] Accounting is an accounting method that combines traditional [[accounting]] methods of measuring profit with those that measure social and environmental benefits as well. The phrase was created by John Elkington in 1994 at his company [http://www.sustainability.com/company SustainAbility]. Some criticisms have sprung up over what methods are to be used to measure environmental and social impacts.

== Legal forms ==
Ecopreneurs may decide to develop their company under traditional business legal forms like a [[sole proprietorship]] or an [[Limited liability company|LLC]] or they might chose some newer forms discussed below. These business forms are popular among the environmentally conscious community for their emphasis on social benefit.
* [[Low-profit limited liability company]] or (L3C) is a company that follows the same legal and tax codes as a traditional LLC but has a main goal of increasing social welfare like that of a non-profit organization.  This form of business is not available in every state of the USA as of 2013.
* [[Benefit corporation]] is for-profit legal entity that differs in its purpose and accountability from that of a regular corporation. Its emphasis on mission-driven purpose allows it a different accountability to stakeholders. This form of business is not available in every state of the USA as of 2013. More information can be found on the official website benefitcorp.net [http://benefitcorp.net/]

An '''environmental enterprise''' is an [[environmentally friendly]]/compatible business. Specifically, an environmental enterprise is a business that produces value in the same manner which an [[ecosystem]] does, neither producing waste nor consuming unsustainable resources. In addition, an environmental enterprise rather finds alternative ways to produce one's products instead of taking advantage of animals for the sake of human profits. To be closer to the goal of being an environmentally friendly company, some environmental enterprises invest their money to develop or improve their technologies which are also environmentally friendly. In addition, environmental enterprises usually try to reduce global warming, so some companies use materials that are environmentally friendly to build their stores. They also set in place regulations that are environmentally friendly. All these efforts of the environmental enterprises can bring positive effects both for nature and people. The concept is rooted in the well-enumerated theories of [[natural capital]], the eco-economy and [[cradle to cradle design]]. Examples of environmental enterprise would be [[Seventh Generation, Inc.]], and [[Whole Foods]].

==Background==

===Economic globalization is an irreversible trend===
Natural resource scarcity or/and abundance are drivers of globalization, as they incite supply and demand forces in global markets.&lt;ref name="ref 2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adil Najam|author2=David Runnalls|author3=Mark Halle|title=Environment and Globalization Five Propositions|publisher=International Institute for Sustainable Development|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fast globalization of the world's economies in recent years is largely based on the rapid development of science and technologies, has resulted from the environment in which market economic system has been fast spreading throughout the world and has developed on the basis of increasing cross-border division of labor that has been penetrating down to the level of production chains within enterprises of different countries.&lt;ref name="ref 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gao|first1=Shangquan|title=Economic Globalization: Trends, Risks and Risk Prevention|publisher=Economic &amp; Social Affairs|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment and sustainability===
For the past 50 years we have amassed unprecedented financial wealth, but have also chronically under-priced risk in terms of our natural resource base (our endowment of minerals, forests, fish, water and climate).&lt;ref name="ref 2" /&gt; We have financed our extraordinary growth in aggregate living standards while systematically under-pricing the goods and services we derive from our planet's natural resources, the negative externalities we create by polluting them and the future risks we face from their cumulative depletion and degradation.&lt;ref name="ref 2" /&gt;
The phenomenal economic growth we have enjoyed over the past 50 years has seen our world's built environment and transport networks expand in size and complexity at an unprecedented rate.&lt;ref name="ref 1" /&gt; We have developed a vastly more interconnected global human ecosystem to provide us with food, fuel, water, homes and transportation than has ever been.&lt;ref name="ref 2" /&gt;
Sustainability can be achieved because the companies adapt sustainable production to improve their image. Being environmentally friendly is good for product branding. Meanwhile, as social issues come up, some companies focus on the environmental issues in order to create the positive image of the company. As environmental social concerns increase, some companies start to supply environmentally friendly products and distribution systems. The meanings of the systems can be explained either by the viewpoints of the company's management or the idea that an environmentally friendly management guidelines will give a positive image of the company and its goods. In other words, these thoughts are based on economic and ethical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Di Norcia V.|author2=Larkins J.|title= Mixed Motives and Ethical Decisions in Business | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 25|pages= 1–13|year=2000|doi=10.1023/a:1006053706207}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Kyoto Protocol can be an example: It was intended to solve global problems of climate change and global warming; however, some companies had already put reducing emissions and getting better energy efficiency into practice, which is helpful to create a positive public image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adolphson|first1=D.|title= A New Perspective on Ethics, Ecology and Economics| journal= Journal of Business Ethics |volume=54|pages= 203–216|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==
An '''environmental enterprise''' is an [[environmentally friendly]]/compatible business. Specifically, an environmental enterprise is a business that produces value in the same manner which an [[ecosystem]] does, neither producing waste nor consuming unsustainable resources.The concept is rooted in the well-enumerated theories of [[natural capital]], the eco-economy and [[cradle to cradle design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Enterprise|website=Wikipedia|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The flow process shows the loop between enterprise and natural capital. Evidently, nature is the spring of wealth and the only thing that could and should be done is to promote the economy efficiency in the inner cycle.[6] In another word, strengthening the utilization ratio of raw materials to increase output, and meanwhile, enhancing the technology to reduce input of sources and waste products. To accomplish sustainability is, in this case, to make the economy functioning better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr N. Jardine, C.|title=Calculating the Environmental Impact of Aviation Emissions|date=2005|publisher=Environmental Change Institute Oxford University Centre for the Environment|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===External cost===

In economics, an externality is the cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. The cost of the environment is usually termed as the external cost of an enterprise. Air pollution from burning fossil fuels causes damages to crops, (historic) buildings and public health. "Social cost − private cost = External cost". The ideal situation of environmental enterprise is to cut the negative external cost. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=A|first1=Rabl|last2=F|first2=Hurley|last3=R|first3=Torfs|last4=Int Panis|first4=L|last5=De Nocker|first5=L|last6=Vermoote|first6=S|last7=Bickel|first7=P|last8=Friedrich|first8=R|last9=Droste-Franke|first9=B|last10=Bachmann|first10=T|last11=Gressman|first11=A|last12=Tidblad|first12=J|last13=Peter|first13=Bickel|last14=Rainer|first14=Friedrich|title=European Commission Publications Office, Luxembourg, 2005|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257538633_ExternE_Externalities_of_Energy_Methodology_2005_Update|pages=75–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social cost===

Social cost in economics may be distinguished from "private cost". Economic theorists model individual decision-making as measurement of costs and benefits. Social cost is also considered to be the private cost plus externalities.

For example, the manufacturing cost of a car (i.e., the costs of buying inputs, land tax rates for the car plant, overhead costs of running the plant and labor costs) reflects the private cost for the manufacturer (in some ways, normal profit can also be seen as a cost of production; see, e.g., Ison and Wall, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;181). The polluted waters or polluted air also created as part of the process of producing the car is an external cost borne by those who are affected by the pollution or who value unpolluted air or water. Because the manufacturer does not pay for this external cost (the cost of emitting undesirable waste into the commons), and does not include this cost in the price of the car (a Kaldor-Hicks compensation), they are said to be external to the market pricing mechanism. The air pollution from driving the car is also an externality produced by the car user in the process of using his good. The driver does not compensate for the environmental damage caused by using the car.&lt;ref name="car industry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Kim|last2=Menk|first2=Debra|last3=Cooper|first3=Adam|title=Contribution of the Automotive Industry to the Economies of all Fifty State and the United States|url=http://www.cargroup.org/?module=Publications&amp;event=View&amp;pubID=16|publisher=Center for Automotive Research|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How to achieve==
*Take environmental issues into consideration in the process of operation and management of an enterprise.
Generally speaking, regardless of the scale of an enterprise, every industrial enterprise have the problem of being environmental friendly. Since the environmental issue is gradually affecting the long-term development of a nation, not only companies but also the state should take this into consideration and control the pollution in practice. An advanced enterprise should take care of the natural capital and external cost which paid by the nature circumstance rather than merely sacrifice the natural resources to make profit.
*Establishing an environmental managing system and regulations.
To achieve the concept of environmental enterprise is a multiple task. Not only polluting problem but also saving raw materials; decreasing the usage of energy, output of waste, reducing the carcinogens in products are highly emphasized. Only by accomplishing these could an industry completely deal with the environmental issue. 
*Invested in reducing pollution from the origin of contamination and introducing environmental friendly production line.
The origin of contamination should be constrained. The most effective way of control degradation is to go to the beginning of it rather than the pathways. 
*Carrying forward the culture of environmental enterprise and gradually modifying the whole industry. 
It is our duty to maintain the globe. Therefore, making these a culture is one of the best way to keep people's consciousness in a long term period of time.

==Case study==
'''''Whole Foods''''':&lt;ref name="ref 7"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Whole Foods|title=We Practice and Advance Environmental Stewardship|url=http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/mission-values/core-values/we-practice-and-advance-environmental-stewardship|accessdate=24 October 2014|archivedate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whole Foods|title=Sustainability and Our Future|url=http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/mission-values/core-values/sustainability-and-our-future#actions|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"We see the necessity of active [[environmental stewardship]] so that the earth continues to flourish for generations to come. Because of the 42% waste reduction, we were profiled by the EPA as a construction waste reduction and recycling record-setter."

===Sustainable agriculture===
"We support organic farmers, growers and the environment through our commitment to sustainable agriculture and by expanding the market for organic products.
We work with ranchers and producers to develop hormone and antibiotic-free alternatives for our customers to buy.
We advocate fewer and safer pesticides in non-organic foods."

===Wise environmental practices===
"We respect our environment and recycle, reuse, and reduce our waste wherever and whenever we can.
We seek to balance our needs with the needs of the rest of the planet through the following actions:
*Supporting sustainable agriculture. We are committed to greater production of organically and bio-dynamically grown foods in order to reduce pesticide use and promote soil conservation.
*Reducing waste and consumption of non-renewable resources. We promote and participate in recycling programs in our communities. We are committed to re-usable packaging, reduced packaging, and water and energy conservation.
*Encouraging environmentally sound cleaning and store maintenance programs.
*Promoting the purchase of bulk food and other products utilizing reduced or reusable packaging, as well as encouraging shoppers to reduce waste through nickel per bag rebate program."

The '''history of Dutch nationality''' is the emergence of a sense of [[national identity]] in the territory of the [[Netherlands]]. Consciousness of national identity was manifested through shared national obligations and rights such as taxation, military service, political and social rights, but most importantly through the concept of citizenship. Dutch nationality was forged through conflict which helped the people of the [[Low Countries]] develop a unifying idea of the [[Netherlander]].

== Early stages ==
Before the formation of the [[Dutch Republic]] the land of the [[Low Countries]] had been inhabited by a number of disparate peoples who migrated from other lands and left only traces of their culture on the territory of the Low Countries. In the 10th century the [[Franks]], [[Frisians]] and [[Saxons]] who lived in the territory of the Low Countries had no sense of common identity or unifying factors. The name “Dutch” that binds the people together as a single, unified group was not yet in use.  Instead, the inhabitants of the lands were loyal to local lords, the territory that they lived on and to the towns of which they were [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnouw, A.J. ''The Making of Modern Holland.'' London: Bradford &amp; Dickens, 1948 pg 18&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages of existence,  the concept of national identity had not been developed as a way by which a group of people could self-identify as such. Instead, they were labeled according to the place that they live and by their professions. Over time, these independent towns were subordinate to [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]]{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}&lt;!-- in the 10th Century?? --&gt; or [[Spain|Spanish]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouw, pg 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The turning point in the history of the Low Countries was the [[County of Flanders|Flemish]] uprising in 1302 against the Francophiles, put into power by the French king. The Dutch [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]] together defeated the French army at [[Kortrijk]] and, in so doing, developed a sense of their own strength and community.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouw, pg 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourteenth century, the Flemish vehemently denied their French [[citizenship]] and identified themselves as [[Flemish people|Fleming]]. This trend was noticeable throughout other counties and duchies in the Low Countries and formed the basis of the awakening of Dutch nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouw, pg 24&lt;/ref&gt; Nationality, a sense of belonging to a specific group of people disregarding their geographical position, was beginning to evolve even before the formation of the Dutch Republic.

== Emergence of the Dutch culture==
By the [[Middle Ages]] large parts of the population of the Low Countries lived in urbanized centers. These towns and large villages were the carriers of and the centers for self-recognition of Dutch culture. Art and poetry began to emerge, establishing a distinction between the Dutch and other peoples, in particular the French. These urban centers formed out of a realization that cooperation was necessary for survival. Individuals joined together to form communities, and in so doing gave up personal interests and subjugated themselves to local law.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouw, pg 27&lt;/ref&gt;
The formation of local law was a step towards unifying and defining the peoples' belonging to a specific state within the Low Countries, however it did not produce a feeling of a common nationality across the entire territory.

== Before the Dutch Republic ==
Under foreign rule, the Low Countries were able to extensively develop economically and politically. However, the sense of a shared “nationality” was still non-existent. This sense of nationality was forged through conflict and was the result of opposition to a despotic governing body. This opposition grew stronger with imposed taxation and centralization by the foreign ruler. The [[Dutch Revolt]] that occurred as a result of this opposition changed forever the structure of the Netherlands. Known as the [[Eighty Years War]], the revolt lasted between 1568 and 1648 and allowed for the beginning of the formation of a sense of nationality and at about the middle of the 16th century, people no longer described themselves as inhabitants of one of the Provinces, but simply as Belga or Flamengus both signifying Netherlander.&lt;ref&gt;Renier, G.J. ''The Dutch Nation: an Historical Study.'' London: Hazell, Watson &amp; Viney, Ltd., 1944. pg 14&lt;/ref&gt; An awareness of a common nationality started to emerge as people began to identify themselves with a national group rather than with local interests.

===Political rights===
The [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] of the 17 states of the Netherlands convened annually to discuss matters of economics, religion and politics. Politically, the seventeen states grew closer to each other and by solving common problems began to develop a sense of opposition to the ruler. Through this resistance to outside rule, a sense of belonging to a common nation began to emerge. Centuries of being united by politics and economics allowed the people of the Low Countries  – even though they spoke different languages – to feel part of a shared culture: the Netherlandish culture.&lt;ref&gt;Geyl, pg 6&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, even though politically brought together the seventeen states did not develop a feeling of national identity. In the 16th and 17th centuries, these sentiments were not strong enough to mobilize the leading or the common class of the Low Countries. Nonetheless, opposition to centralization imposed by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] helped to forge a national identity later on. While under foreign rule, neither citizenship nor a nationality law of the Low Countries existed on the national level.

===Citizenship===
Prior to the formation of the Dutch Republic, the seventeen provinces of the Netherlands had urban and not national citizenship. No inclusive citizenship status existed for the population of the Low Countries. Citizenship was a legal status available to all inhabitants of a particular city. There were certain obligation and privileges applied to all those that were [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]] (citizens). These rights were never formally written down in legal documents, rather existed as a set of practices or [[City rights in the Low Countries|city rights]] varying in every territory.

====Obligations====
* Live with a family in the area of citizenship.
* Pay taxes to the city that one was a burgher of.
* Social duties had to be fulfilled. An example would be the need to be part of militias guarding local streets.&lt;ref&gt;Vink, Maartin. ''Limits of European Citizenship: European Integration and Domestic Immigration Policies.'' New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005. pg 30&lt;/ref&gt;
Note: The last set of obligations applied to all inhabitants of the city and not only citizens. Closer to the end of the 17th century residents of cities shared obligations with citizens and enjoyed all, except political, citizenship rights.

====Rights====
* Right to freedom from serfdom.
* Right to trial under laws of town of citizenship.
* Right to access social privileges, such as orphanages, guilds, schools, etc.
* Right to not pay customs fee for merchandise sold at local markets. Only those that were citizens had the right to sell their goods at the market. This important privilege pushed many people to acquire citizenship.
* Right to hold public office. Political participation was the right only of citizens and only of those that held the status for more than five years.&lt;ref&gt;Vink, pg 31&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ways to acquire citizenship====
* By descent (Jewish children could not acquire citizenship in this way and were obliged to buy it.)
*By purchase
*By Marriage (This applied only to women. Women lost their original citizenship upon marriage and gained that of their husband.)&lt;ref&gt;Kloek, Joost and Wijnand Mijnhardt. Dutch Culture in a European Perspective. Vol. 2, 1800: Blueprints for a National Community. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004., pg 222&lt;/ref&gt;
*By Gift (Usually granted to merchants, clerics, and skilled craftsmen.)&lt;ref&gt;Vink, pg 30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taxation ===
The taxation methods imposed on the Low Countries under the [[Habsburgs]] were mainly targeted at providing money for military operations. Under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], taxes in the Netherlands were raised fivefold in order to accommodate his conflict with the French. The money that the populations of the Low Countries paid did not go toward forging a national state which could unite them under one nationality. On the contrary the Low Countries were an integrated, prosperous, densely populated, and developing part of the Habsburg empire.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, Jonathan. ''The Dutch Republic; Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477–1806.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995. pg. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
Religion was neither a unifying factor of Dutch nationality, nor the seed of the separation of the Low Countries into two separate entities. While both Protestants and Catholics came together in their opposition to Spanish rule, it was only with the common goal of fighting for Netherlands liberties and freedoms, and not for the recognition of the Dutch nationality.&lt;ref&gt;Geyl, pg 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dutch Republic==
In 1579, the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] was signed unifying the northern provinces of the Netherlands. An outcome of the [[Dutch Revolt]], the republic was not yet internationally recognized, but soon gained that status with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648. The idea of patriotism was widespread but was not a strong force. Similarly, the concept of the ‘[[fatherland]]’ was also general but created both unity and disunity within the population inasmuch as it was a debated concept.&lt;ref&gt;Vink, pg 33&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1780s the national consciousness present for centuries was converted to modern nationalism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Social rights===
Even though urban governments showed rare signs of democracy they were primarily an oligarchic system marked by an exclusive hierarchy. Class divisions, however were not as deep as in other European states, and the rights that the common class possessed did not differ much from what the intellectuals could practice. There was a cultural harmony and it prevented the formation of two completely divided classes and allowed for a social participation of all. Similarly, the basis of education was the same for all, and this allowed for a social bond.&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga, J.H. ''Dutch Civilization in the Seventeenth Century and Other Essays.'' London: Collins, 1968., 42&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in rights that the upper and lower classes possessed was reduced to the amount of money available to the individual. If one was wealthy, he could afford higher-level education. However, this alone did not earn him any political privileges or extensive political rights but only the ability to earn more wealth. 
The whole population of the Dutch Republic did not have the choice of voting for the representative of the Country inasmuch as there was not a choice between a democracy and an aristocracy but rather between an aristocracy and a monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga, pg 42&lt;/ref&gt; The [[stadtholder]] would be a member of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]].

===Citizenship rights===
In the 18th century, in the Dutch Republic, there was no national civil law which united the whole population.  Each town had its own civil law stipulating citizen rights and obligations, based on the citizenship model of the Roman Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Kloek and Mijnhardt, pg 134&lt;/ref&gt; Citizenship law of the [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]] was still restricted to only the town’s population, and completely excluded the people of the countryside. 

The rights of citizenship were based on the principle of [[jus soli]], signifying that rights would be granted to all those born on the territory. However, this was not applied uniformly and in some cities as for example in [[Nijmegen]], citizenship could be acquired only by [[jus sanguinis]]. Furthermore, as was the case prior to the establishment of the Dutch Republic, citizenship could be purchased if one had lived in the particular city for a period of time. The price for citizenship likewise varied from place to place. This unique way of [[naturalization]] of the 18th century was accompanied by rights, obligations and an oath of allegiance to the community of burghers that one was becoming part of.&lt;ref&gt;Kloek and Mijnhardt, pg 134&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, all those that were citizens of the republic had a collection of political and civic rights. The extent to which these rights could be exercised in the Dutch Republic in the 18th century by far surpassed that of other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Kloek and Mijnhardt, pg 141&lt;/ref&gt;

====Political====
Citizens enjoyed legal protection of life and property from their governing body. Again, it should be noted that a legal system encompassing the whole population of the republic did not yet exist. As in the 17th century the extent of this protection of life and property, varied from city to city. Meaning that if one burgher was to travel from his hometown to another territory, he was not protected by the law of the territory that he was on, but by the law of the territory that he was a burgher of. If there was infringement on his rights, the court would treat him in accordance with the rights relevant to him.&lt;ref&gt;Kloek and Mijnhardt, pg 137&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civic====
* All those that were burghers of their city had the right to participate in political debate.
* Right to representation
* Right to freedom of assembly and association. There were no restrictions to setting up clubs and societies.
* Right of freedom of expression&lt;ref&gt;Kloek and Mijnhardt, pg 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military service===
In the 18th century, military service was considered a privilege of only the burghers. However, as the century came to a close the essence of military service changed inasmuch as city authorities imposed the service on all townspeople regardless of whether they were burghers or not.&lt;ref&gt;Kloek and Mijnhardt, pg 135&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to changes that took place in the sphere of citizenship rights.

===Dutch women===
====Social rights====
Women of the Netherlands were not a marginalized part of society but on the contrary participated actively in social life. However, that applied only to those women who possessed a good reputation and a respected name. Both arbitrary categories, good reputation stemmed from the economic prosperities available, and the respected name was determined by the women's goodwill and decency of husband.&lt;ref&gt;Kloek and Mijnhardt, pg 221&lt;/ref&gt; Women of high birth were accepted as citizens. Moreover, women from the established middle classes were also accepted as citizens but their rights, only consisted of taking care of domestic affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Kloek and Mijnhardt, pg 221&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas, women of high birth enjoyed slightly more privileges, such as the ability to participate in trades and even several guilds. Furthermore, certain trades and guilds such as ''turftonsters'' (women who collected taxes on peat sales) and ''uitdraagsters'' (women who sold second-hand merchandise) were restricted only to women.&lt;ref&gt;Kloek and Mijnhardt, pg 222&lt;/ref&gt; The participation level was strongly dependent on the criterion of respectability of a woman. 

Overall, women had a lot less opportunities then men, but their status was never clearly defined. Those that possessed money and a good reputation were never restricted from participating in social life and by the end of the 18th century their participation in cultural life augmented dramatically.  As well, in their societies women were able to manage financial affairs, travel unaccompanied to social gatherings such as the theatre, run stores, form societies (best known of which is the Ladies Natural Science Association in [[Middelburg]] founded in 1785), and carry out heavy manual labour (women of the lower classes).&lt;ref&gt;Kloek and Mijnhardt, pg 222, 224&lt;/ref&gt; Such involvement in society, however, was sometimes met with resistance, even though by participating in the social sphere women were not breaking any laws.

==The Dutch in the 19th century==
The year 1795 marked the downfall of the Dutch Republic and gave birth to the [[Batavian Republic]]. At the beginning of the 19th century, the first codification of Dutch national citizenship appeared in the [[Napoleonic Code]] for the [[Kingdom of Holland]] effective from 1801–1811, originating from the French code of civil rights, the [[Code Civil]].&lt;ref&gt;Vink, pg 33&lt;/ref&gt; In 1813, after the proclamation of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], the ''Code Civil'' continued to remain in effect even though a new Dutch constitution was drawn in 1815. The new constitution ''de facto'' became the first '''Dutch''' codification of Dutch citizenship, where it was stated that, starting from 1815, only residents had the freedom to occupy positions in public offices.&lt;ref&gt;Vink, pg 33&lt;/ref&gt; This was a significant change from the citizenship laws of the preceding centuries. The Dutch civil code stipulated that residents were only those people who were born to parents officially residing on Dutch territory.&lt;ref&gt;Vink, pg 33&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the colonial ambitions of the Netherlands, all those people who traveled abroad in official service of the country were considered to live in the Netherlands and were to be counted as residents. The new Dutch civil law was the building block for the implementation of [[jus sanguinis]]. On the other hand, even though descent remained very important for the acquisition of citizenship, the emphasis on the significance of residency, was evidence of the French influence of [[jus soli]].&lt;ref&gt;Vink, pg 34&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, a new Dutch civil code ([[Burgerlijk Wetboek]]) replaced the ''Code Civil'' and dealt with nationality in a new, Dutch way but still largely influence by the French system. The new Burgerlijk Wetboek cemented the rights of nationality of women and touched upon the loss of nationality. Dutch nationality would be lost by naturalization or permanent residence in another country. As well, serving in a foreign army and providing labour for a foreign public service without royal permission would deprive one of Dutch nationality.&lt;ref&gt;Vink, pg 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in the 1838 Dutch Civil Code===
The nationality of married women was determined in the same way as in the ''Code Civil''.&lt;ref&gt;Vink, pg 34&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that a woman’s nationality was dependent on the nationality of her husband. A Dutch woman marrying a non-Dutch man would automatically lose her nationality, and conversely a non-Dutch woman marrying a Dutch man necessarily acquired Dutch nationality.&lt;ref&gt;Vink, pg 34&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a woman would lose her nationality status as soon as she permanently resided or naturalized in another country&lt;ref&gt;Vink, pg 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===1848 Constitution and 1850 Nationality Law===
The next important step in the history of Dutch nationality was the 1848 constitution which stated that (1) a person had to be Dutch to possess the right of nationality and (2) all those with Dutch citizenship have the ability to be employed in public services.&lt;ref&gt;Vink, pg 34&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, nationality law became part of public law. However, the definition of nationality remained in the code of civil law. This created a problem because not all those defined Dutch by the 1838 civil code were necessarily privileged to enjoy public rights.&lt;ref&gt;Vink, pg 35&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, a new nationality law was implemented in 1850 in order to limit the inclusiveness of the nationality law based on the French system. Nevertheless, the new 1850 nationality law did not replace the 1838 civil code and this in turn led to the creation of a double nationality; political nationality as stated in 1850, and civil nationality of the 1838 civil code.&lt;ref&gt;Vink, pg 35&lt;/ref&gt; The uncertainties were eliminated in 1892 with the implementation of the Nationality Act which replaced both 1838 and 1850 nationality acts. The new law was based on the German system of ''jus sanguinis'' and excluded all previous mention of the principle of ''jus soli''.&lt;ref&gt;Vink, pg 35&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Dutch nationality law]] survived until the amendments of 1985.

===Modern nationality law===
{{main|Dutch nationality law}}

== Dutch colonies ==
{{main|Dutch Empire}}
Having been a naval power, the Netherlands possessed colonies in the western hemisphere as well as in the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), Formosa, and Cape Colony in the southern hemisphere. Since the beginning of Dutch colonialism, the metropolis expressed more interest in the economic rather than the nationality aspect of their colonies. There was no policy of assimilation in the Dutch colonies, as in some French colonies. Even though, colonies were used for profit, politics and laws were controlled by Dutchmen with the help of local elites. In this way, in the southern hemisphere the Dutch may be considered as newcomers imposing their rules, whereas in the [[Caribbean]] the Dutch created their own subject and made a local society.&lt;ref&gt;Oostindie, Gert. ''Paradise Overseas: The Dutch Caribbean: Colonialism and its Transatlantic Legacies.'' Oxford: Macmillan Education, 2005. pg 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Hemisphere===
The populations of Dutch colonies were all considered subjects of the empire and given limited political and social rights. The Dutch East Indies in particular, were always of greater interest than the Caribbean. The formation of the [[Dutch East India Company]] in 1602 always brought great capital to the metropolis and contributed significantly to the Dutch economy. There was no desire to create integrated Dutch and East Indies societies before the 20th century.
In the 20th century, however, the Dutch colonial policy towards the East Indies changed and moved from the liberalist to neoliberalist point of view of how to deal with imperial possessions. The trend showed the desire to guard the rights of the natives and implement a better protection of colonies against outside threat.&lt;ref&gt;schmutzer, Eduard J.M. ''Dutch Colonial Policy and the Search for Identity in Indonesia.'' Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1977. pg, 8&lt;/ref&gt; With this idea, the Netherlands began a program of greater integration in the Dutch East Indies. It was based primarily on the humanitarian idea of offering help and guidance to achieve peace and order.&lt;ref&gt;Schmutzer, pg 15&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the assumption that subjects of the empire were not mature enough to build their own state or politics, and the mother country felt the obligation to educate them in the sphere and set an example.&lt;ref&gt;Schmutzer, preface, pg x&lt;/ref&gt; The new policy was called Assimilation and aimed to create a unity between Eastern and Western Dutchmen. The new harmony would be joined politically and nationally disregarding racial differences which could not weaken it.&lt;ref&gt;Schmutzer, pg 25&lt;/ref&gt; This however would mean the granting of political autonomy to the dependent Indonesia, something that a large number of Dutchmen did not agree with primarily because of economic reasons. This cultural and national synthesis was never realized in as much as strong nationalistic feelings in the Dutch East Indies, and European affairs soon ripped the plan apart.&lt;ref&gt;Schmutzer, pg 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastern Hemisphere Dutch colonies:
* [[Dutch East Indies]]
* [[Dutch Ceylon]]
* Formosa (modern day [[Taiwan]])
* [[Malacca]]
* [[Deshima]]
* [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]
* [[Cape Colony]]

===Western Hemisphere===
Colonies of the Caribbean were never intended to be carriers of Dutch culture and language. The slave populations of the Caribbean colonies had almost no contact with the Dutch culture and as a result of this, a mixed Caribbean culture was created based largely on African roots. The populations were governed by Dutchmen who were not elected by the locals but rather sent from the metropolis.

The separation between the Dutch and their subjects was great. For example, in Suriname, one of the most important Dutch colonies in South America, the Dutch language was foreign to ninety-five percent of the population, and only the local elites learned the language and attended Dutch schools.&lt;ref&gt;Oostindie, pg 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Dutch was never successfully imposed on the majority. In fact, often the populations of the Dutch Caribbean spoke languages of adjacent colonial powers such as Spanish, Portuguese and English and not the language of their colonizer. Overall, colonies in the Caribbean were used solely as plantation centers to extract profit. However, the economic benefits received from these territories was less than that of Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Oostindie, pg 21&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the Netherlands did not display deep interest in Caribbean societies. This is why Essequibo, Demerar, and Berbice were given up to the British in the middle of the 19th century.

====Suriname and the Antilles====
For the Dutch, relations with Suriname and Antilles were always closer than with the rest of their subjects. In the 20th century, the Dutch nationality policy towards Suriname stated that locals could choose to become Dutch citizens in the 1970s and 80s, and migration doors were open.&lt;ref&gt;Davids, Tine and Francien Th. M. van Driel. ''The Gender Question in Globalization: Changing Perspectives and Practices.'' Ashgate Publishing Ltd, 2005. pg 114&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was viable only during that period and since then Surinamese migration is only possible through the family-reunion/formation program.&lt;ref&gt;Davids, and M. van Driel, pg 114&lt;/ref&gt; The Antilles however, are part of the Netherlands to this day and the people are considered Dutch citizens with all the rights, privileges and obligations that that entails. 

Western hemisphere Dutch colonies:
*[[Aruba]]
*[[Curaçao]]
*[[Dutch Antilles]]
*[[Dutch Brazil]]
*[[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]], [[Demerara]], [[Berbice]] (modern day [[Guyana]])
*[[New Netherlands]]

'''Hukumina''' is an extinct and unclassified [[Austronesian language]] recently spoken in the northwest of [[Buru Island]] in the [[Maluku Islands]] of eastern [[Indonesia]]. However, it may not have been one of the indigenous [[Buru languages]] but an old migration from [[Buton Island]] off the southeast coast of [[Sulawesi]], and thus possibly a [[Buton languages|Buton language]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2182">'''Infantilization''' is the prolonged treatment of one who has a mental capacity greater than that of a [[Early childhood|child]] as though he or she is a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maude|first1=Ulrika|title=Beckett and Phenomenology|date=2011|page=111|quote='to infantilize someone', for instance by treating an adult person as if they were a child}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used in reference to teenagers or adolescents, the term typically suggests that teenagers and their potential are underestimated in modern society, and/or that adolescents are often regarded as though they are younger than their actual age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Couture|first1=Pamela|title=Child Poverty: Love, Justice, and Social Responsibility|date=2007|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

People who are the subject of infantilization by others are said to have been "infantilized." Studies have shown that an individual, when infantilized, is overwhelmingly likely to feel disrespected. Such individuals may report a sense of [[Relational transgression|transgression]] akin to [[dehumanization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ware|first1=Mark|title=Handbook of Demonstrations and Activities in the Teaching of Psychology volume 2|date=2013|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There can be an overlap between the terms "infantilization" and "patronization", although infantilization derives more specifically from a sense of age group or hierarchical seniority on the part of those responsible for infantilization.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

Infantilization may also refer to a process when a child is being treated in a manner appropriate only for younger children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gresham|first1=Mary|title=The infantilization of the elderly: A developing concept|date=1976|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-6198.1976.tb00616.x/abstract|quote=In Maternal Overprotection, Levy (1957) defines infantilization as that process occurring in  childhood whereby certain activities in caring for the child are continued beyond the stage of  development when such activities usually occur.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the last First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Uzbekistan]] from 1989 to 1991, when the party was reconstituted as the [[People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan]] (PDP); he led the PDP until 1996. He was the President of the Uzbek SSR from 24 March 1990 until he declared the independence of Uzbekistan on 1 September 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Hierman, Brent (2016).

==Early life and career==

Karimov was born in [[Samarkand]] to Uzbek parents who were civil servants. His family background and history are obscure and the identity of his biological father is unknown, with claims being that he was either [[Tajiks|Tajik]] or [[Jews|Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Bruce Pannier|title=Orphaned Dictator: The Making Of Uzbekistan's Islam Karimov|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/the-making-of-islam-karimov-uzbekistan/26917396.html|accessdate=3 April 2015|work=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent to an orphanage in 1941, brought back in 1942, and then returned to the orphanage in 1945. In 1955, he graduated from high school. In 1960, he graduated from the Central Asian Polytechnic Institute (now [[Tashkent State Technical University]]) with a degree in mechanical engineering.&lt;ref name="echo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Биография Ислама Каримова|url=http://m.echo.msk.ru/blogs/detail.php?ID=1828908|accessdate=2 September 2016|publisher=Echo Moscow|date=2 September 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began work as an engineer, eventually joining the Ministry of Water Resources of the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In 1967, he earned a master's degree in economics from [[Tashkent State University of Economics]].&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt;

From 1966 to 1986, he worked his way up the ranks in the Uzbek State Planning Committee, from chief specialist, to department head, to Minister of Finance of the Uzbek SSR, chairman of the State Planning Committee and deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Uzbek SSR.&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt; In 1986, Karimov assumed the post of first secretary of the [[Qashqadaryo Region|Kashkadarya Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan]] Committee of the Communist Party of the Uzbek SSR. In 1989, he became first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Uzbek SSR, after his predecessor [[Rafiq Nishonov]] failed to quell inter-ethnic clashes and instability in the [[Fergana Region]].&lt;ref&gt;Gulsen Aydin, Orta Dogu Teknik Universitesi, [http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12604690/index.pdf "Authoritarianism versus democracy in Uzbekistan: domestic and international factors"], (Ankara: METU, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 to 1991, he served as a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. On 24 March 1990, he was elected the first President of the Republic by the Uzbek Supreme Soviet.&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt;

On 31 August 1991, 10 days after the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|attempted coup in Moscow]], Karimov declared Uzbekistan to be an independent republic, the second of the Central Asian republics to do so (after neighboring Kyrgyzstan); 1 September was declared Uzbekistan's Independence Day. The [[Communist Party of Uzbekistan|Uzbek Communist Party]] (UCP) changed its name to the [[People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan]] (PDP). In the [[Uzbekistani presidential election, 1991|December 1991 presidential election]], 86 percent of the public cast their votes for Karimov and 12.3 percent for his rival [[Muhammad Salih]], chairman of the [[Erk Democratic Party|Erk (Freedom) Party]].&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armanini|first1=A.

==Presidency==
[[File:Stamps of Uzbekistan, 2006-055.jpg|thumb|A 2006 Uzbek stamp featuring Karimov and Indian prime minister [[Manmohan Singh]]]]
Uzbekistan under the Karimov government was classified as a hard authoritarian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dbedDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=karimov+%22hard+authoritarian%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BA957arviM&amp;sig=RibagV3xHPgoTh5rnXqUMGC6l5A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiijsevh57XAhUIzmMKHXXUAlkQ6AEIODAC#v=onepage&amp;q=karimov%20%22hard%20authoritarian%22&amp;f=false|title=Regional Integration Processes in the Commonwealth of Independent States|page=243|author=Czerewacz-Filipowicz, Katarzyna, and Konopelko, Agnieszka|year=2017|publisher=Springer|place=Cham, Switzerland|isbn=9783319475639}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state's primary legitimacy claims are anti-Islamism and ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz, pp. 263–284.&lt;/ref&gt; Karimov's primary authoritarian measures that were implemented following the brief period of "thaw" and political tolerance include the thwarting of alternative political leaders from coalition building.&lt;ref&gt;Bohr, pp. 5–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, he accomplished the [[hajj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BrM_Ms9OVsEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=%22karimov%22+%22mecca%22+%221992%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EtzD8ak9p6&amp;sig=sKUz6N1QSBBX6hG-16LiTY-qX2c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixxbSalt3QAhVnJsAKHfU5BVQQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22karimov%22%20%22mecca%22%20%221992%22&amp;f=false|title=The New Geopolitics of Central Asia and Its Borderlands|page=161|chapter=Islam, State-building and Uzbekistan Foreign Policy|last=Hale|first=Henry|editor-last=Banuazizi|editor-first=Ali|editor-last2=Weiner|editor-first2=Myron|place=Bloomington, Indiana|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1994|isbn=9780253209184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Election controversies===
In 1996, Karimov's term was extended until 2000 through a [[Uzbekistani presidential term referendum, 1995|referendum]]. Results showed 99.6 percent of voters favoured extending Karimov's term.&lt;ref&gt;Bivens, Matt. [http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-23/news/mn-58018_1_central-asia Kazakhstan Leader Tightens Grip on Reins of Power]. [[Los Angeles Times]], 1995-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States criticised the referendum for its "lack of public debate" and instances of one person casting the vote for his entire family. At the time, Karimov publicly stated that he considered the referendum to be a re-election to a second term, which under the Constitution would have required him to leave office in 2000. However, the legislature passed a resolution opposing the decision, leading Karimov to announce he would run for reelection in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/democracy/1995_hrp_report/95hrp_report_eur/Uzbekistan.html Uzbekistan Human Rights Practices]. [[United States Department of State]], 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

He was reelected with 91.9% of the vote in the [[Uzbek presidential election, 2000|Uzbek presidential election, on 9 January 2000]]. The United States said that this election "was neither free nor fair and offered Uzbekistan's voters no true choice".&lt;ref name=NOTFREE&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/election/uzbekistan/bbu260100.htm US slams Uzbek election as unfree, unfair and laughable] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040323161231/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/election/uzbekistan/bbu260100.htm |date=23 March 2004 }} EurasiaNet&lt;/ref&gt; The sole opposition candidate, Abdulhafiz Jalalov, implicitly admitted that he entered the race only to make it seem democratic and publicly stated that he voted for Karimov. Following this election in 1996, restrictions on opposition were further tightened through the Law on Political Parties. This law ensured the right to meetings, publications and elections of opposition parties, but only to those who had registered with the Ministry of Justice. This policy allowed for government blockage of unapproved parties. Political parties based on ethnic, religious, military or subversive ideas were prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;Bohr, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; According to dissident writer Alisher Ilkhamov from the [[Open Society Foundations]], 99.6% had elected to keep Karimov in office after his term had expired, but ballots had been created such that it was much easier for voters to cast a "yes" vote than a "no" vote. Unmarked ballots, as well as ballots of those who did not vote, were automatically counted as "yes" votes, while a full black mark, under the supervision of authorities, was necessary to count as a "no" vote.&lt;ref&gt;Alisher Ilkhamov, [http://www.merip.org/mer/mer222/controllable-democracy-uzbekistan "Controllable Democracy in Uzbekistan"], ''Middle East Report'', No. 222 (2002) pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative policies===
{{merge to|section=yes|Politics of Uzbekistan|date=June 2018}}
Karimov took fewer foreign visits, especially to the West, in comparison to his Kazakh counterpart. There were few foreign embassies in Tashkent as of 2016, with only 44 in all: 29 from countries not part of the former Soviet Union and seven from the West.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Karimov government, a heavy regulation policy of [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] led to the creation of paradoxically named GONGOs, or Government-Organised Non-Governmental Organisations. Trade unions became "an instrument of management rather than a means of interest group-based collective bargaining". The Karimov government required universities to serve a strictly pedagogical purpose and not as a branch of civil society;&lt;ref&gt;Bohr, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; they had to provide students with skills for the workplace without an emphasis on the skill of critique of public issues.

===Policies towards Islam===

[[File:CSTO Meeting 2010.jpeg|thumb|220x220px|Karimov (2nd from right) at the [[CSTO]] meeting]]
Karimov had originally cultivated Islamic symbols after independence in order to coopt religious opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Bohr, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1999, as a response to the threat of Islamic radicalism, the [[Oliy Majlis]] revised the 'Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organizations' to impose new restrictions on religious groups. The construction of mosques, for example, required permission and specific documentation. An assassination attempt on Karimov in 1999 elicited even more repression of Islamic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Bohr, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, Uzbekistan was considered a strategic ally in the United States' "[[War on Terror]]" campaign because of a mutual opposition to the [[Taliban]]. Uzbekistan hosted an 800-strong U.S. troop presence at the [[Karshi-Khanabad base]], also known as "K2", which supported U.S.-led efforts in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=INVASION&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/khanabad.htm Khanabad, Uzbekistan Karshi-Kanabad (K2) Airbase Camp Stronghold Freedom] Global Security&lt;/ref&gt; The move was criticized by Human Rights Watch which said the U.S. government subordinated the promotion of human rights to assistance in the War in Afghanistan. U.S.-Uzbek relations deteriorated in May 2005 when Karimov's government strongly encouraged the abandonment of the U.S. base in the face of U.S. government criticism of the [[Andijan Massacre|government killings of protestors in Andijan]]. In July 2005 U.S. military forces left Karshi-Khanabad.&lt;ref name=ANDIJAN&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4731411.stm US asked to leave Uzbek air base] BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt;

These fears of extremism arose out of discourse among the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) of a "Jihad against the Karimov regime". The government of Uzbekistan retains fears of "large-scale all-encompassing anti-state conspiracies" and "echoes of [[Basmachi]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stuart Horsman|title=Themes in Official Discourses on Terrorism in Uzbekistan|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=26|issue=1 |year=2005|pages=199–213|jstor=3993771|doi=10.1080/0143659042000322982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Karimov's anti-Islamist policies was the purge of Muslim leaders. Karimov led a crackdown on Adolat, a league of Muslim activists. Explicit fears of threats of Islamic extremism also led to a crackdown of displays of Islamic practice in public. The term "[[Wahhabis]]" became the umbrella term to refer to all strains of "extremist" Islam; it did not necessarily refer to the Islamic sect that originated in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;Bohr, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary practicing Muslims have been targeted and jailed without trial,&lt;ref name="USHR"&gt;http://www.refworld.org/docid/3e918c468.html citing U.S. Department of State 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and frequent use of torture and occasional "disappearances" have been reported.&lt;ref name="USHR"/&gt; In 2005 Karimov banned the [[Adhan|Muslim call to prayer]] from being broadcast in the country; the ban was lifted in November 2017 by his successor, [[Shavkat Mirziyoyev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A year after the despot’s death: An Uzbek spring has sprung, but summer is still a long way off|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21732574-new-president-less-brutal-his-predecessor-no-democrat-uzbek-spring-has-sprung|accessdate=16 December 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-elections===
Karimov sought another term in the [[Uzbek presidential election, 2007|December 2007 presidential election]], despite arguments that he was ineligible because of the two-term limit on the presidency. On 6 November 2007, Karimov accepted the nomination of the [[Uzbekistan Liberal Democratic Party]] to run for a third term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://enews.ferghana.ru/article.php?id=2216|title=Islam Karimov agreed to remain the president another seven years|work=Ferghana.ru|accessdate=13 November 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111054535/http://enews.ferghana.ru/article.php?id=2216|archivedate=11 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 November, the Central Election Commission announced the approval of Karimov's candidacy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/11/3597F25E-461B-4ED6-A905-D5FF22FA2139.html "Uzbek Election Watchdog Clears Karimov For Third Term"], Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 19 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; a decision that Karimov's opponents condemned as illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Shukhrat Babajanov, [http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/11/24d1a90d-dc50-4b5f-a423-dda940129072.html "Uzbekistan: Official Acquiescence In Karimov Presidential Bid Draws Fire"], Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 21 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the election on 23 December 2007, preliminary official results showed Karimov winning with 88.1% of the vote, on a turnout rate that was placed at 90.6%.

His isolationism defined foreign policy. Karimov was courted by the big powers for geopolitical leverage and Uzbekistan's gas supplies, but he kept all at arms' length, suspicious of Russia's post-colonial aims and the US-led democratization agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/80401|title=Uzbekistan: The Life and Legacy of Islam Karimov|last=Lillis|first=Joanna|date=2016-09-02|newspaper=EurasiaNet|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/69891|title=Uzbekistan: Will Next Address of Dictator's Daughter be a Prison Cell?|last=Lillis|first=Joanna|date=2014-09-08|newspaper=EurasiaNet|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, he criticised the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) for paying too much attention to the protection of [[Human rights in Uzbekistan]], rather than concentrating on the security issues facing [[Central Asia]] and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS). "As long as [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|war continues]] in [[Afghanistan]], the threat to peace, security and democratic reforms in the neighbouring states of Central Asia will remain, and the source of international [[terrorism]] and its expansion well beyond the region's boundaries will be preserved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/528646.stm|title=Uzbekistan voices security concerns|publisher=BBC|date=19 November 1999|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karimov's Party apparatus gained effective control over the media during the immediate independence period. Because of a poor human rights and democratization record, the Karimov administration worked to improve its image by allowing broadcasts from [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]. A tarnished record had harmed the efforts to gain greater access to developmental aid and foreign investment.&lt;ref&gt;Bohr, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Constitution of Uzbekistan|Uzbek Constitution]] freedom of expression in the media is nominally guaranteed; Article 67 explicitly states, "Censorship is not permitted." However, under the Karimov government, all media publications had to be "held accountable for the reliability" of the information released. This "accountability" actually introduces an opportunity for government censorship, as the definition of "accountability"was left to the Karimov and now is left to the successive Presidential administration's discretion. Article 29 states that all freedom of media expression is to be allowed with the exceptions of releasing state secrets and statements against the Constitution. The printed media of Uzbekistan has a high number of publications, but is dominated by three: ''Khalq Sozi'', its Russian edition ''Narodnoye Slovo'', and another Russian-language publication, ''Pravda Vostoka''. The state owns almost all media, and the State Control Inspecorate, located in Tashkent, secures tight editorial control. Topics deemed "sensitive" are not considered for publishing. A ban is in place that prevents publications that give space to "unregistered opinions". Arrests of journalists have been documented in Tashkent and Samarkand.

As a propaganda tool, the state strictly controls the tone and subject material of all published works. State censors give preference to works that provide a positive, uplifting ideology to its readers. Criticism that passes the censors is limited to low and mid-level officers. Although the Karimov regime during the 1990s assumed a greater tolerance for foreign media, the state has heavily limited foreign publications during the past decade{{when|date=July 2018}}. There has been a considerable reduction of Russian-sponsored broadcasting, and Western media has diminished in publication as well.&lt;ref name=hrw&gt;Human Rights Watch, [http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6a7d10.html ''Violations of Media Freedom: Journalism and Censorship in Uzbekistan''] (1 May 1996), D07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Banned publications under the Karimov administration included ''Mustaqil Haftalik'' and ''Erk'', the respective publications of the Birilik and Erk opposition parties. The Karimov government charged each publication on the grounds of being "disloyal to the current regime".&lt;ref&gt;Bohr, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1995, Karimov was quoted in describing local journalists as "toothless".&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt; Karimov had essentially called for more criticism in printed material, but only "approved" criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Bohr, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2002, the Karimov administration lifted the pre-publication censorship, and fined the chief censor, Ervin Kamilov. The State Inspectorate for the Protection of State Secrets was disbanded. Two days later, the administration proceeded to reinstate further censorship measures. Among topics prohibited in Uzbekistan's publications are official corruption, opposition political parties and Islamic organizations. [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Liberty]] lost its broadcast rights. Uzbekistan has one state-run internet server, UZPAK, that blocks prohibited websites.&lt;ref&gt;Bohr, pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Uzbek students published a letter on the opposition party website, Dunyo Uzbeklari (World of Uzbeks) to protest the use of students as unpaid labour to pick the nation’s cotton harvest every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/13/uzbekistan-students-rare-protest-forced-labour-cotton-picking|title=Uzbekistan students stage rare protest against forced labour in cotton fields|last=Lillis|first=Joanna|date=2014-11-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-21|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Karimov came under widespread criticism when he was elected to a fourth term in office, from the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/uzbekistan|title=Uzbekistan|date=2016-01-05|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-06-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to detailed accounts, on 13 May 2005, some 400 of the 500 protesters staging an anti-government demonstration were killed after being driven deliberately into a trap – authorities had blocked all the exits from Bobur Square with [[armoured personnel carrier]]s, preventing people from dispersing home. Instead, they drove the crowd into a closed street, Chulpon Avenue, where snipers and police shot to kill. These scenes of deliberate killings prompted eyewitnesses to allege that troops not only shot to disperse the demonstration, but to summarily execute anyone who took part in it. Later, some tortured detainees recounted that police said they had received orders supposedly emanating from the president himself to shoot to kill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/node/62372 Andijan Refugees' Report Yields New Findings on 2005 Massacre by Government Forces].

According to [[Ikram Yakubov]], a major in Uzbekistan's [[National Security Service (Uzbekistan)|secret service]] who defected to Britain in 2007, the government had "propped up" the [[Islamist]] organization [[Akramia]], which the Uzbek government blamed for fomenting the incident that led to the protests. He believes that the attacks were a pretext to repress dissenters. According to Yakubov, President Karimov personally ordered government troops to fire on the protestors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Former_Uzbek_Spy_Seeks_Asylum/1195372.html Former Uzbek Spy Accuses Government Of Massacres, Seeks Asylum].

At approximately 9 a.m. on 27 August 2016, an unconscious Karimov was taken to the Central Clinical Hospital, according to the official medical report by the government of Uzbekistan. He underwent a CT scan that revealed he had suffered a "massive subarachnoid hemorrhage" (stroke). He went into cardiac arrest but cardiac activity was restored after 20 minutes of resuscitation attempts. He was in an "atonic coma with inhibition of the functions of the brain stem" and put on a ventilator.&lt;ref name="govreport"&gt;{{cite web|title=Медицинское заключение о болезни и причине смерти Ислама Абдуганиевича Каримова |trans-title=Medical report on the illness and cause of death of Islam Karimov|url=https://www.gov.uz/ru/news/view/7168|publisher=Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan|accessdate=3 September 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter [[Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva]] reported that he was in stable condition at an intensive care ward.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

'''John W. Darrah''' (December 11, 1938 – March 23, 2017) was a [[United States federal judge|United States District Judge]] of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]].

==Education and career==

Born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], Darrah received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from [[Loyola University Chicago]] in 1965 and a [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Loyola University Chicago School of Law]] in 1969. He was an attorney advisor for the [[Federal Trade Commission]] from 1969 to 1971. He was a deputy public defender in the [[DuPage County]] Public Defender Office from 1971 to 1973. He was in private practice in [[Illinois]] from 1971 to 1973. He also began teaching as an adjunct professor in the [[Northern Illinois University College of Law]] in 1972. He was an Assistant state's attorney of Office of State's Attorney, Illinois from 1973 to 1976. He was in private practice in [[Illinois]] from 1976 to 1986. He was a Circuit court judge of the Illinois 18th Judicial Circuit Court from 1986 to 2000. He was instrumental in establishing Keith Roberts Trial Advocacy Program that the Du Page County Bar Association has been putting on for lawyers since about 1995 -- a program that most recently concluded one on its programs on March 18, 2017, just days before his death.

==Federal judicial service==

On May 11, 2000, Darrah was nominated by President [[Bill Clinton]] to a seat on the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] vacated by [[George Michael Marovich]]. Darrah was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on June 30, 2000, and received his commission on July 14, 2000. He continued to teach as an adjunct professor at [[The John Marshall Law School]], teaching Evidence and Trial Advocacy. He took [[senior status]] on March 1, 2017, serving in that status until his death on March 23, 2017, at his residence in [[Lisle, Illinois|Lisle]], Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/illinois/articles/2017-03-23/judge-who-oversaw-lucas-museum-case-in-chicago-dies-at-78 "Judge Who Oversaw Lucas Museum Case in Chicago Dies at 78" US News &amp; World Report, March 23, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/obituaries/ct-john-darrah-obituary-20170324-story.html "John Darrah, served 17 years as federal judge in Chicago, dies" Chicago Tribune, March 24, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Keratsa-Maria''' of Bulgaria ({{lang-bg|Кераца-Мария}}; 1348–1390) was [[Princess]] of [[Bulgaria]] during the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] and [[Empress]] of [[Byzantine Empire]] . She was the daughter of Tsar [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria]] and his second wife, a converted [[Jew]], [[Sarah (Theodora)|Theodora]].

==Marriage==
On 17 August 1355 Keratsa was betrothed to the future Emperor [[Andronikos IV Palaiologos]]. The marital document issued by the Patriarchate stated that "it would be beneficial to the Christians: Byzantines and Bulgarians, and pernicious to the infidels (the Turks)".

In 1373, while still co-emperor with his father, [[John V Palaiologos]], Andronikos led a failed rebellion against the [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Murad I]]. As a result, Keratsa (along with him and their son) were imprisoned for three years, until they were liberated by the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]. On 12 August 1376, Andronikos IV [[Byzantine civil war of 1373–1379|deposed his father]] and replaced him as Emperor of the [[Byzantine Empire]], with Keratsa as his Empress consort. The new imperial couple remained in control of [[Constantinople]] until 1 July 1379, when John V was restored to his throne. Andronikos IV was declared co-emperor but conflict between father and son lasted until the death of the latter in 1385.

Keratsa spent the later part of her life as a nun under the name Mathissa. She died in 1390.

==Children==
Keratsa and [[Andronikos IV Palaiologos]] had three children, a son and two daughters. Their son became Emperor [[John VII Palaiologos]], reigning for five months in 1390.

'''Khmer Loeu''' ({{lang-km|ខ្មែរលើ, {{IPA-km|kʰmae ləː}}, "upland Khmer"}}), is the collective name given to the various indigenous ethnic groups residing in the highlands of [[Cambodia]]. The Khmer Loeu are found mainly in the northeastern provinces of [[Ratanakiri Province|Ratanakiri]], [[Stung Treng Province|Stung Treng]], and [[Mondulkiri Province|Mondulkiri]]. Most of the highland groups are Mon-Khmer peoples and are distantly related, to one degree or another, to the Khmer. Two of the Khmer Loeu groups are [[Chamic peoples]], a branch of the [[Austronesian peoples]], and have a very different linguistic and cultural background. The Mon–Khmer-speaking tribes are the aboriginal inhabitants of mainland Southeast Asia, their ancestors having trickled into the area from the northwest during the prehistoric metal ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Chris|last1=Baker|first2=Pasuk|last2=Phongpaichit|title=A History of Thailand|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-521-01647-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]]-speaking groups, [[Rade people|Rade]] and [[Jarai people|Jarai]], are descendants of the Malayo-Polynesian peoples who came to what is now coastal [[Vietnam]], saw the rise and fall of their [[Champa]] kingdoms, and then migrated west over the [[Annamite Range]], dispersing between the Mon–Khmer groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBGYb84A7SAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=From ancient Cham to modern dialects: two thousand years of language contact and change : with an appendix of Chamic reconstructions and loanwords|author=Graham Thurgood|year=1999|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|edition=|location=|page=|isbn=0-8248-2131-9|pages=|accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="countrystudies.us"&gt;http://countrystudies.us/cambodia/44.htm retrieved July-21-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The disparate groups that make up the Khmer Loeu are estimated to comprise 17-21 different ethnic groups speaking at least 17 different languages.&lt;ref name=Kleger&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kleger|first1=Heinz|title=The Theory of Multiculturalism and Cultural Diversity in Cambodia – Final Draft|date=2004|publisher=University of Potsdam|location=Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Cham, Vietnamese and Chinese minorities of the lowlands, the Khmer Loeu groups haven't integrated into Khmer society or culture and remain politically unorganized and underrepresented in the Cambodian government. There have never been any treaties between a Khmer Loeu group and the government nor is Cambodia a signatory to the [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989|Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention]].&lt;ref name=Kleger /&gt; Cambodia's landmark 2001 land law guarantees indigenous peoples communal rights to their traditional lands,&lt;ref name=Kleger /&gt; but the government is accused of routinely violating those provisions, confiscating land for purposes ranging from commercial logging to foreign development.&lt;ref name =FIDH&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambodia Land Cleared for Rubber Rights Bulldozed: The impact of rubber plantations by Socfin-KCD on indigenous communities in Bousra, Mondulkiri|url=https://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/report_cambodia_socfin-kcd_low_def.pdf|publisher=International Federation for Human Rights|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mu|first1=Sochua|last2=Wilkstrom|first2=Cecilia|title=Land Grabs in Cambodia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/19/opinion/land-grabs-in-cambodia.html?_r=0|accessdate=24 July 2015|work=The New York Times|date=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.licadho-cambodia.org/reports/files/187Document-UPR2013-LICADHO.pdf|title=Submission to the UN’s Universal Periodic Review, Cambodia|publisher=LICADHO|work= Universal Periodic Review 2013|year=2013|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Traditionally, the ruling Khmer majority has referred to all the highland groups as ''phnong'', a name of one of the groups that has come to mean "savage" in Khmer, or ''samre'', the name of another group that has developed the meaning "bumpkin" or "hick".&lt;ref name=KhDict&gt;Headly, Robert K.; Chhor, Kylin; Lim, Lam Kheng; Kheang, Lim Hak; Chun, Chen. 1977. ''Cambodian-English Dictionary''. Bureau of Special Research in Modern Languages. The Catholic University of America Press. Washington, D.C. {{ISBN|0-8132-0509-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these words are now considered pejorative. The [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|colonial French administration]] designated the highland ethnicities of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam "Montagnards".

The term "Khmer Loeu" was crafted by the [[Sangkum Reastr Niyum]] government of [[Norodom Sihanouk|Sihanouk]]'s [[Kingdom of Cambodia (1953–70)|Cambodia]] in the 1950s. In order the stress the unity, or "Cambodian-ness", of the various ethnic groups that inhabited its borders and promote a nationalist cohesiveness, the government classified citizens as one of three groups of "Khmer", ''Khmer Kandal'', ''Khmer Islam'' and ''Khmer Loeu''.&lt;ref name=Engelbert&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engelbert|first1=Thomas|title=The enemy needed: the Cochin China issue and Cambodian factional struggles, 1949–50|journal=South East Asia Research|date=1998|volume=6|issue=2|jstor=23746937}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Khmer Kandal'' ("Central Khmer") referred to the ethnic [[Khmer people|Khmer]] majority. ''Khmer Islam'' was the name given to the ethnic [[Cham people|Cham]] inhabiting the central plains of Cambodia. ''Khmer Loeu'' was coined as a catch-all term to include all of the indigenous minority ethnic groups, most of which reside in the remote highlands of northeast Cambodia.&lt;ref name=Baird2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baird|first1=Ian G.|title='Indigenous Peoples' and land: Comparing communal land titling and its implications in Cambodia and Laos|journal=Asia Pacific Viewpoint|date=2013|volume=54|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current government has used the term ''chuncheat daerm pheak tech'' ({{lang-km|ជនជាតិដើមភាគតិច}}, "original ethnic minority") in official documents while referring to ethnic Khmer as ''chuncheat daerm pheak chraern'' ("original ethnic majority"). However "Khmer Loeu" still remains the colloquial, and most common, designation for these groups.

In the [[Khmer language]], an alternative, though unrelated, use of the term "Khmer Loeu" is in reference to the [[Northern Khmer people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tarr|first1=Chou Meng|title=Changing Notions of Time and Money in a Peasant Community in Northeastern Thailand|journal=Social Analysis: The International Journal of Social and Cultural Practice|date=1992|issue=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic Khmers sometimes use a tripartite division to differentiate Khmers native to [[Thailand]], Cambodia or [[Vietnam]]. Those native to [[Thailand]] are sometimes referred to as "Khmer Loeu" due to their location on the southern [[Khorat plateau]] relative to those native to Cambodia, "Khmer Kandal", while Khmer native to the lower Mekong Delta region of Vietnam are called [[Khmer Krom]], "lower Khmer" or "southern Khmer".

== Geography and demographics ==
Khmer Loeu form the majority population in Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri provinces, and they also are present in substantial numbers in [[Kratié Province]] and Stung Treng Province. Their total population in 1969 was estimated at 90,000 people. In 1971 the number of Khmer Loeu was estimated variously between 40,000 and 100,000 people. Population figures were unavailable in 1987, but the total probably was nearly 100,000 people.

== Culture ==
Most Khmer Loeu live in scattered temporary villages that have only a few hundred inhabitants. These villages usually are governed by a council of local elders or by a village headman.

The Khmer Loeu cultivate a wide variety of plants, but the main crop is dry or upland rice grown by the slash-and-burn method. Hunting, fishing, and gathering supplement the cultivated vegetable foods in the Khmer Loeu diet. Houses vary from huge multifamily longhouses to small single-family structures. They may be built close to the ground or on stilts.&lt;ref name="countrystudies.us"/&gt;

== History ==
During the period of the [[Colonial Cambodia|French Protectorate]], the French did not interfere in the affairs of the Khmer Loeu. Reportedly, French army commanders considered the Khmer Loeu as an excellent source of personnel for army outposts, and they recruited large numbers to serve with the French forces. Many Khmer Loeu continued this tradition by enlisting in the [[Cambodian army]].

In the 1960s, the Cambodian government carried out a broad civic action program—for which the army had responsibility—among the Khmer Loeu in [[Mondulkiri]], [[Ratanakiri]], [[Stung Treng]], and [[Koh Kong Province|Koh Kong]] provinces. The goals of this program were to educate the Khmer Loeu, to teach them [[Khmer language|Khmer]], and eventually to assimilate them into the mainstream of Cambodian society. There was some effort at resettlement; in other cases, civil servants went out to live with individual Khmer Loeu groups to teach their members Khmer ways. Schools were provided for some Khmer Loeu communities, and in each large village a resident government representative disseminated information and encouraged the Khmer Loeu to learn the lowland Khmer way of life. Civil servants sent to work among the Khmer Loeu often viewed the assignment as a kind of punishment.

In the late 1960s, an estimated 5,000 Khmer Loeu in eastern Cambodia rose in rebellion against the government and demanded self-determination and independence. The government press reported that local leaders loyal to the government had been assassinated. Following the rebellion, the hill people's widespread resentment of ethnic Khmer settlers caused them to refuse to cooperate with the Cambodian army in its suppression of rural unrest. Both the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese communists took advantage of this disaffection, and they actively recruited Khmer Loeu into their ranks. In 1968, Pol Pot and other Khmer Rouge fled to Khmer Loeu lands, who were seen as hostile to lowland Khmer and to the government. In late 1970, the government forces withdrew from Rstanakiri and Mondulkiri provinces and abandoned the area to the rapidly growing Khmer Rouge [[communist]] insurgent force, the [[Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea]], and to its Vietnamese mentors. There is some evidence that in the 1960s and in the 1970s the Front Uni pour la Libération des Races Opprimés (FULRO—United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races) united tribes in the mountainous areas of southern Vietnam and had members from Khmer Loeu groups as well as from the [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]] in Cambodia.

In the early 1980s, [[Khmer Rouge]] propaganda teams infiltrated the northeastern provinces and encouraged rebellion against the central government. In 1981 the government structure included four Khmer Loeu province chiefs, all reportedly from the [[Brao]] group, in the northeastern provinces of [[Mondulkiri]], [[Ratanakiri]], [[Stung Treng]], and [[Preah Vihear Province|Preah Vihear]]. According to a 1984 resolution of the PRK National Cadres Conference entitled "Policy Toward Ethnic Minorities," the minorities were considered an integral part of the Cambodian nation, and they were to be encouraged to participate in collectivization. Government policy aimed to transform minority groups into modern Cambodians. The same resolution called for the elimination of illiteracy, with the stipulations that minority languages be respected and that each tribe be allowed to write, speak, and teach in its own language.

== Groups ==
The major Khmer Loeu groups in Cambodia are the [[Kuy]], [[Pnong]], [[Stieng people|Stieng]], [[Brao]], [[Tampuan people|Tampuan]], [[Pear (S.E. Asian ethnic group)|Pear]], [[Jarai people|Jarai]], and [[Rade people|Rade]]. All but the last two speak [[Mon–Khmer languages]].

=== Kuy ===
{{main article|Kuy people}}
In the late 1980s, about 160,000 [[Kuy]] lived in the northern Cambodian provinces of [[Kampong Thom Province|Kampong Thom]], [[Preah Vihear Province|Preah Vihear]], and [[Stung Treng]] as well as in adjacent Thailand. (Approximately 70,000 Kuy had been reported in Cambodia itself in 1978.) Most of the Kuy have been assimilated into the predominant culture of the country in which they live. Many are Buddhists, and the majority practice wet-rice cultivation. They have the reputation of being skilled blacksmiths.

=== Brao, Kreung, Kavet ===
The [[Brao]], [[Kreung]], and [[Kavet]] inhabit the northeastern Cambodian province of [[Ratanakiri]] and adjacent [[Laos]]. All three speak different, though mutually intelligible, dialects of the same language. They share a very similar culture, with matrilineal descent. In 1962 the Brao population in Laos was estimated at about 9,000. In 1984 it was reported that the total Brao population was between 10,000 and 15,000. About 3,000 Brao reportedly moved into Cambodia from Laos in the 1920s. The Brao live in large villages centered on a communal house. They cultivate dry-rice and produce some pottery. They appear to have a bilateral kinship system.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Tampuan ===
{{main article|Tampuan people}}
The Tampuan number about 25,000, according to a 1998 census. They have a [[Mon–Khmer]] language, and practice a form of [[animism]]. They have [[matrilineal]] descent.

The Tampuan live in the northeastern province of Cambodia, [[Ratanakiri]]. Many Tampuan live in villages close to Ratanakiri's provincial capital, [[Ban Lung]], around a volcanic crater lake, Yeak Laom. Some live in scattered communities around the small town of Voeun Sai.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peoplesoftheworld.org/text?people=Tampuan Retrieved July-21-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pnong, Stieng ===
A total of 23,000 [[Pnong]] were thought to be living in Cambodia and in Vietnam in the early 1980s. In Cambodia the Pnong are found in [[Mondulkiri]], [[Kratié Province|Kratié]], and [[Kampong Cham Province|Kampong Cham]] provinces in villages consisting of several longhouses each of which is divided into compartments that can house nuclear families. The Pnong practice dry-rice farming, and some also cultivate a wide variety of vegetables, fruits, and other useful plants as secondary crops. Some subgroups weave cloth. At least two of the Pnong subgroups have matrilineal descent. [[Monogamy]] is the predominant form of marriage, and residence is usually matrilocal. Wealth distinctions are measured by the number of buffalo that a notable person sacrifices on a funereal or ceremonial occasion as a mark of status and as a means of eliciting social approval. [[Slavery]] is known to have existed in the past, but the system allowed a slave to gain freedom.

The [[Stieng people|Stieng]] are closely related to the Pnong. Both groups straddle the Cambodian-Vietnamese border, and their languages belong to the same subfamily of Mon–Khmer. In 1978 the Cambodian Stieng numbered about 20,000 in all. The Stieng cultivate dry-field rice. Their society is apparently patriarchal, and residence after marriage is patrilocal if a bride-price was paid. The groups have a very loose political organization; each village has its own leaders and tribunals.

=== Pear, Chong, Saoch, Suoi (Pearic Group) ===
Several small groups, perhaps totalling no more than 10,000 people in Cambodia and southeastern Thailand, make up the [[Pearic peoples|Pearic]] group. The main members are the Pear in [[Battambang Province|Battambang]], [[Pursat Province|Pursat]], and [[Kampong Thom Province|Kampong Thom]] provinces; the [[Pear people|Chong]] in Thailand and Battambang Province; the [[Saoch]] in [[Kampot Province]]; the [[Pear people|Samre]] in what was formerly [[Siem Reap Province]]; and the [[Suoi]] in [[Kampong Chhnang Province]]. Some believe that this group constitutes the remnant of the pre-Khmer population of Cambodia. Many members of the Pearic group grow dry-field rice, which they supplement by hunting and by gathering. They have totemic clans, each headed by a chief who inherited his office patrilineally. Marriage occurs at an early age; there is a small bride-price. Residence may be matrilocal until the birth of the first child, or it may be patrilocal as it is among the [[Saoch]]. The village headman is the highest political leader. The [[Saoch]] have a council of elders who judge infractions of traditional law. Two chief sorcerers, whose main function is to control the weather, play a major role in [[Pearic religion]]. Among the [[Saoch]], a corpse is buried instead of being burned as among the [[Khmer people|Khmer]].

=== Jarai ===
The Austronesian groups of [[Jarai people|Jarai]] and [[E De people|E De]] (also known as Rhade, or Rade) form two of the largest ethnic minorities in Vietnam. Both groups spill over into northeastern Cambodia, and they share many cultural similarities. The total Jarai population stands at about 200,000; the E De number about 120,000. According to 1978 population figures, there were 10,000 Jarai and 15,000 E De in Cambodia in the late 1970s. They live in longhouses containing several compartments occupied by matrilineally linked nuclear families. There may be twenty to sixty longhouses in one village. The Rade and Jarai cultivate dry-field rice and secondary crops such as maize. Both groups have exogamous matrilineal descent groups (consanguineous kin groups that acknowledge a traditional bond of common descent in the maternal line and within which they do not marry). Women initiate marriage negotiations and residence is matrilocal. Each village has its own political hierarchy and is governed by an oligarchy of the leading families. In the past, sorcerers known as the "kings of fire and water" exerted political power that extended beyond an individual village. The Rade and the Jarai have been involved intimately in the [[FULRO]] movement, and many of the leaders in the movement are from these two groups.

The '''Kilba''' are an ethnic group in the [[Hong, Nigeria|Hong]] local government area of [[Adamawa State]] (formerly [[Gongola State]]) in [[Nigeria]].

Höba were living in large clan-based mountain communities. These mountain communities were Pella, Gwaja, Hong, Kulinyi, Garaha, Bangshika, Miljili, Gaya-jaba, Gaya-maki, Gaya-skalmi, Gaya-gou, Gaya Fa'a, Gaya Jabba, Ndlang, Hyama, Kinking, Motaku, Kwapor, Za and Zivi, all in the present Hong Local Government. The Höba clan-based mountain communities were each ruled by a "Töl köra ma" (King of the mountain community). "Köra ma" means "mountain top". Töl is pronounced as "ttle", which means King. A particular Töl therefore, was known by his clan name. Each of the mountain communities was made up of several villages. These villages had their method of communication. They had specific ways of doing everything, and life was very smooth and enjoyable. The Töl köra ma was a secular-cum-religious ruler. He had a cabinet made up of Yaduma, Midala, Bira'ol, Kadagimi, Kadala, Dzarma and Batari, depending on the community. Each had their designated cabinets. The cabinets of all the Töls still have the same character. 
Höba was a tribe with a formidable army. They were articulate and had distinct ways of doing things and of getting things done. Höba was a tribe with formidable unity. After the 18th century AD, Dr. Henry Barth &lt;ref&gt;reference missing&lt;/ref&gt;(1965) (a German traveler) came across Höba during his voyage. One Furkudol was bringing Höba, in their various clan-based mountain communities under one central government at that time. In Dr. Barth's report of his voyage, he wrote that Höba was "a well organized pagan kingdom second to none in Western Sudan". Dr. Barth continued, that this kingdom
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"resembles that of ancient Egypt or modern European kingdom. The kingdom was divided into units to which members of the ruling families were sent out to administer as governors" 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dr. Barth continued, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Every month, they (the governors and central ministers) sent in reports to the King for further directives or final decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kda.kabissa.org/who.php display text Kabissa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These governors were the Yirmas and the Shalls. There was only one Yirma from Udong. Since there was and is still just himself, he is simply called Yirma. The governors were in a hierarchy, with the Yirma being the highest of them all, Udong is the place we now call Udong. The government of Höba is divided into two, with the Töl as the overall ruler. The territorial administration is the responsibility of the Shalls and the Yirma. The central administration is the responsibility of the Töls cabinet members. The cabinet ismade up of the following: 
#1 Sabiya – Sabiya is the Prime Minister and Chief Adviser to the Töl.
#2 Bira'ol – Bira'ol is the Assistant Prime Minister
#3 Midala – Midala is the Defence Minister and War Commander
#4 Kadala – Kadala is the Inspector General of Police. He arrests and orders the arrest of criminals.
#5 Dzarma – Dzarma is the Minister in Charge of the Royal Stable
#6 Batari – Batari is the Head of Royal Ward
#7 Kadagimi – Kadagimi is the Courtier and an official of the King's Palace
#8 Yaduma - Yaduma is the speaker of the Council of Representatives of advisers

Long after the consolidation of the kingdom we know from general history that the 19th Century was characterized by wars due to Jihad and incessant skirmishes with the Fulanis in which records inform us that Höba was never ever conquered. Very many attempts were made to do so though to no avail. Höba, though very war hungry at that time, were only going out to subdue Fulani settlements and take away their assets. Very similar to the Israelites of the olden days, when they were moving into the Promised Land from Egypt. Höba never consolidated their war victory anywhere. The approach was very spasmodic too. When it became clear that there was never going to be a conquest between the jihadists and Höba, a truce had to be declared on market days at Pella and at Mbilla Kilba. The Fulanis and Höba attended these market days freely.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== Location ==
The Kilba who live in Hong Local Government Area are situated in the area between four local governments: Gombi, Song, Mubi and Michika Local Governments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kda.kabissa.org/who.php#Location Kabissa]&lt;/ref&gt; Miss Nissen gives a good description of the location of Kilba area in her book,&lt;ref&gt;''An African Church is Born'', 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 135-S-15-25-20, Tibetexpedition, Tibetische Tanzgruppe.jpg|thumb|250px|Ache Lhamo in front of [[Gongkar Dzong]], 1939]]

'''Lhamo''', or '''Ache Lhamo''', is a classical secular theatre of Tibet with music and dance that has been performed for centuries, whose nearest western equivalent is opera. Performances have a narrative and simple dialogue interspersed with comedy and satire; characters wear colorful masks. The core stories of these theatrical plays are drawn mostly from ancient Indian  Buddhist folk tales, lives of important  people and historical events from Tibetan civilization. However the ceremonial, dance and  ritual spectacles strongly reflects the Tibetan Royal Dynastic period.

Oral accounts credited the foundation of Ache Lhamo tradition to 14th-century mystic [[Thang Tong Gyalpo]]. The procedure and style in which Ache Lhamo are performed has changed little since the time of inception in the 14th-15th centuries. Today, the same opening rituals are enacted prior to the commencement of every performance, authentic costumes are worn, singing, dance and musical tradition are strictly adhered to.

Little is known about the  development of Lhamo troupes until the time of fifth [[Dalai Lama]], [[Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso]] (1617-1682 A.D). There are murals of lhamo stories on the walls of the Potala Palace that are believed to have painted between 1695 and 1705.

According to some oral narratives, the costumes and mask of Hunter or Fisherman (Tibetan: ''Ngonpa'') were designed by the fifth Dalai Lama, based on his personal dream.

By the turn of the 19th century, Ache Lhamo performances were found throughout Tibet, each major district having a permanent amateur troupe performing for the local community at various formal occasions throughout the year.

Some notable troupes including Tashi Sholpa,  Chongye Phundun, Shangpa, Gyalkhara, Chungpa and Kyormulung are much sought after and are always a regular part of the official festivals at Norbu Lhingkha, Drepung Monastery and Sera Monastery.

The performers are monks and lay people who love lhamo. Tibetans from all walks of life are familiar with and frequently sing the arias ''(Tib. namthars)'' for themselves or for entertainment at social gatherings. The stories were passed down from generation to generation.

In the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]], the opera is called ''Al-che-lha-mo'', the actor ''lha-mo-ba'' and the script ''khrab-gzhung''   Tibetan opera is the crystallization of the cultural wisdom of Tibetan people for thousands of years. It is regarded as the "living fossil" of Tibetan culture. And now there is eight major traditional Tibetan opera.

==History==
It is popularly believed that  tradition of performing Ache Lhamo or Tibetan Opera was  started by 14th-century mystic Thang Tong Gyalpo, who was born in the family of a peasant in shigatse county of tibet in 1361,And when he was child  his parents gave him a name called trowobendon,They send him to the local monastery to learn culture knowledge , spending years in monastic study he is very smart and easy to learn so who named him Tsuendue Sangpo.
Then he come to Lhasa in order to learn more knowledge,One day in the harbor of Lhasa river he saw a lot of people can`t across the river because of the short money.He please the captain let them cross the river free of charge,Instead,he was beaten by captain,So then he deeply want to buid the bridge on the river.
Seeking to construct bridges, he needed labor and resources. Thus during construction of bridge at Chowo Ri, from his labor team he picked seven sisters from Lhoka county of tibet and taught them  some dance and songs,They made up the chorus,  Adorning them with beautiful costumes, they travelled around towns and villages performing dances to raise resources. The yogi beat drums and cymbal while the girls danced and sang. Audiences, impressed, hailed the performers as "goddesses" (Tibetan: ''Lhamo''); since then they were known as Goddess Sisters. (Tibetan: ''Ache Lhamo''); the tradition of Ache Lhamo developed from this beginning.

Over a period  of years Thang Tong Gyalpo was able to build 58 iron bridges and 60 wooden bridges across towns and villages. He died at an advanced age in Toe Riwoche in 1485.

The remnants of some of his iron chain bridges still stand today in places in Tibet and Bhutan. It became customary for Tibetans to install images and statues of him when occupying a new home. During the opening ritual dance, every lhamo or opera group installs his statue in the middle of the stage and pays homage to him.

'''''Malakia''''' ({{lang|grc|μαλακία}}, "softness", "weakliness") is an [[ancient Greek]] word that, in relation to men, has sometimes been translated as "[[effeminacy]]".

The contrary characteristic in men was ''karteria'' ({{lang|grc|καρτερία}}, "patient endurance", "perseverance").&lt;ref name="μᾰλᾰκ-ευνέω"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/lsj/#eid=66897&amp;context=lsj|title=μᾰλᾰκ-ευνέω|last=|first=|date=|website=The Online Liddell-Scott-Jones Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=|access-date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use by philosophers ==

The [[Socrates]] character in [[Plato]]'s ''Republic'' observed that "exclusive devotion to gymnastic" produces "a temper of hardness and ferocity" and that "exclusive devotion to music" produces a temper "of softness and effeminacy"&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'', Bk III, 410D in the translation by B. Jowett (Vintage Books, p. 118 and [http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.4.iii.html The Internet Classics Archive]).&lt;/ref&gt; The word that Jowett here translates as "effeminacy" is not μαλακία (''malakia''), which he renders as "softness", but ἡμερότης (''hemerotes''). Paul Shorey's translation of the latter word in the Loeb Classical Library is "gentleness".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'', vol. I, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; Some contributors to blogs and Internet forums paraphrase this passage as "too much music effeminizes the man" and present it as if the word ''malakia'' were used in the original text.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [http://www.scouter.com/forum/issues-politics/20154-on-effeminancy Scouter Forum: On Effeminancy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517151431/http://www.scouter.com/forum/issues-politics/20154-on-effeminancy |date=2014-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other passages in Plato's ''Republic'' too, the words ''malakia'' or ''malakos'' are not translated as "effeminacy" or ''effeminate''. Thus the reason given for not familiarizing the guardians with poetry that pictured an afterlife of terrors was "lest the habit for such thrills make them more sensitive and ''soft'' than we would have them."&lt;ref name="Plato207"&gt;''Republic'', Plato, Loeb vol 237, Bk III ii; 387 c; p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; The word translated as "soft" is ''malakoteroi'', an image of softened metal&lt;ref name="Plato207"/&gt; that Plato used also of the effect of certain kinds of music: "when a man abandons himself to music to play upon him and pour into his soul as it were through the funnel of his ears those sweet, ''soft'', and dirge-like airs of which we were just now speaking ... the first result is that the principle of high spirit, if he had it, is softened like iron and is made useful instead of useless and brittle. But when he continues the practice without remission and is spellbound, the effect begins to be that he melts and liquefies till he completely dissolves away his spirit, cuts out as it were the very sinews of his soul and makes of himself a 'feeble warrior'."&lt;ref name = "Plato291"&gt;''Republic'', Plato, Loeb vol 237, Bk III xviii; 411a; p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] writes that, "of the dispositions described above, the deliberate avoidance of pain is rather a kind of softness (''malakia''); the deliberate pursuit of pleasure is profligacy in the strict sense.";&lt;ref name = "Aristotle415"&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'', Aristotle, Loeb vol 73, VII vii 3; pg 415.&lt;/ref&gt;  "One who is deficient in resistance to pains that most men withstand with success, is soft (''malakos'') or luxurious, for luxury is a kind of softness (''malakia''); such a man lets his cloak trail on the ground to escape the fatigue and trouble of lifting it, or feigns sickness, not seeing that to counterfeit misery is to be miserable."&lt;ref name = "Aristotle415"/&gt; and "People too fond of amusement are thought to be profligate, but really they are soft (''malakos''); for amusement is rest, and therefore a slackening of effort, and addiction to amusement is a form of excessive slackness."&lt;ref name = "Aristotle417" &gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'', Aristotle, Loeb vol 73, VII vii 7; pg 417.&lt;/ref&gt;

A writer of the Peripatetic school (c. 1st century BC or AD) elaborated a little more on Aristotle by labeling softness as a [[vice]].  He writes that "[[Cowardice]] is accompanied by softness (''malakia''), unmanliness, faint-heartedness."&lt;ref name = "peripatetic497"&gt;On Virtues and Vices, Loeb vol 285, p. 497.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a concomitant of uncontrol: "The concomitants of uncontrol are softness (''malakia'') and negligence."&lt;ref name = "peripatetic499"&gt;On Virtues and Vices, Loeb vol 285, p. 499&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translations of μαλακία as "effeminacy" ==

Early editions of the Liddell and Scott ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' gave "delicacy, effeminacy" as a translation of μαλακία in passages such as Herodotus 6,11 and Thucydides 1,122.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/greekenglishlex00liddrich#page/917/mode/1up Μαλακία in ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', Harper &amp; Brothers, 1883]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 20th-century revision by Jones, the same work now gives "moral weakness" as the meaning of the word in the same passages.&lt;ref name="LSJ"&gt;[http://www.tlg.uci.edu/lsj/#eid=66897&amp;context=lsj Liddell-Scott-Jones Greek-English Lexicon: μαλακία]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="μᾰλᾰκ-ευνέω"/&gt;

In a passage of the famous Funeral Oration that [[Thucydides]] placed in his mouth, [[Pericles]] is translated by Crawley as saying that the Athenians "cultivate refinement without extravagance and knowledge without effeminacy (''malakia'')".&lt;ref name = "Thucydides105"&gt;''The Peloponnesian War'', Thucydides, trans. Crawley, The Modern Library, NY, 1951. Book II, 40; p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Older Bible translations used "effeminate" to translate ''malakoi'' in [[I Corinthians]].

===Bible translations===
In the gospels, the only instance of the word (in the adjectival form) is in Matthew and Luke, who use ''malakos'' to refer to luxurious clothing, in contrast to the attire of [[John the Baptist]]: "What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft (''malakos'') clothing?"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|11:8|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|7:25|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the word is translated as "soft", "fine", "delicate", "expensive", "fancy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Matthew%2011:8|title=Matthew 11:8 - Bible Gateway|website=www.biblegateway.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Luke%207:25|title=Luke 7:25 - Bible Gateway|website=www.biblegateway.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul's [[I Corinthians|First Letter to the Corinthians]] uses ''malakos'' in the plural to refer to persons. This is commonly translated as "effeminate", as in the King James Version, which has: "Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor ''effeminate'', nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Cor|6:9–10|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common translation is "male prostitutes". Other versions have: "passive homosexual partners", "men who are prostitutes", "effeminate call boys", "men who let other men use them for sex", "those who make women of themselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/1%20Corinthians%206:9|title=1 Corinthians 6:9 - Bible Gateway|website=www.biblegateway.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===St Thomas Aquinas in translation===
In Question 138 of the Second Part of the Second Part of his [[Summa Theologica]], [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] delves more deeply into the connotations of the Latin word ''mollities'', used to translate the word ''malakia'' used by Aristotle (whom Aquinas calls "the Philosopher") in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Book VII, 7), and which is this English translation is rendered by "effeminacy".

Whether effeminacy [''mollities'', literally "softness"] is opposed to perseverance?

''Objection 1.'' It seems that effeminacy is not opposed to perseverance. For a [[Gloss (transliteration)|gloss]] on 1 Cor. 6:9,10, "Nor adulterers, nor the effeminate, nor liers with mankind," expounds the text thus: "Effeminate—i.e. obscene, given to unnatural vice." But this is opposed to chastity. Therefore, effeminacy is not a vice opposed to perseverance.

''Objection 2.'' Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7) that "delicacy is a kind of effeminacy."  But to be delicate seems akin to intemperance. Therefore, effeminacy is not opposed to perseverance but to temperance.

''Objection 3.'' Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7) that "the man who is fond of amusement is effeminate." Now immoderate fondness of amusement is opposed to eutrapelia, which is the virtue about pleasures of play, as stated in Ethic. iv, 8. Therefore, effeminacy is not opposed to perseverance.

''On the contrary,'' The Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7) that "the persevering man is opposed to the effeminate."

''I answer that,'' As stated above (137, 1 and 2), perseverance is deserving of praise because thereby a man does not forsake a good on account of long endurance of difficulties and toils: and it is directly opposed to this, seemingly, for a man to be ready to forsake a good on account of difficulties which he cannot endure. This is what we understand by effeminacy, because a thing is said to be "soft" if it readily yields to the touch. Now a thing is not declared to be soft through yielding to a heavy blow, for walls yield to the battering-ram. Wherefore a man is not said to be effeminate if he yields to heavy blows. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7) that "it is no wonder, if a person is overcome by strong and overwhelming pleasures or sorrows; but he is to be pardoned if he struggles against them." Now it is evident that fear of danger is more impelling than the desire of pleasure: wherefore [[Cicero|Tully]] says (De Offic. i) under the heading "True [[magnanimity]] consists of two things: It is inconsistent for one who is not cast down by fear, to be defeated by lust, or who has proved himself unbeaten by toil, to yield to pleasure." Moreover, pleasure itself is a stronger motive of attraction than sorrow, for the lack of pleasure is a motive of withdrawal, since lack of pleasure is a pure privation. Wherefore, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vii, 7), properly speaking an effeminate man is one who withdraws from good on account of sorrow caused by lack of pleasure, yielding as it were to a weak motion.

''Reply to Objection 1.'' This effeminacy is caused in two ways. On one way, by custom: for where a man is accustomed to enjoy pleasures, it is more difficult for him to endure the lack of them. On another way, by natural disposition, because, to wit, his mind is less persevering through the frailty of his temperament.  This is how women are compared to men, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7): wherefore those who are passively sodomitical are said to be effeminate, being womanish themselves, as it were.

''Reply to Objection 2.'' Toil is opposed to bodily pleasure: wherefore it is only toilsome things that are a hindrance to pleasures. Now the delicate are those who cannot endure toils, nor anything that diminishes pleasure. Hence it is written (Dt. 28:56): "The tender and delicate woman, that could not go upon the ground, nor set down her foot for… softness [Douay: 'niceness']." Thus delicacy is a kind of effeminacy. But properly speaking effeminacy regards lack of pleasures, while delicacy regards the cause that hinders pleasure, for instance toil or the like.

''Reply to Objection 3.'' In play two things may be considered. On the first place there is the pleasure, and thus inordinate fondness of play is opposed to eutrapelia.  Secondly, we may consider the relaxation or rest which is opposed to toil.  Accordingly, just as it belongs to effeminacy to be unable to endure toilsome things, so too it belongs thereto to desire play or any other relaxation inordinately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dhspriory.org/thomas/summa/SS/SS138.html#SSQ138OUTP1|title=Summa Theologica|website=dhspriory.org|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Malacia'' in Latin writers ==

Latin writers adopted the Greek word, Latinized as ''malacia'', to mean, literally or figuratively, "a calm at sea", "dead calm", or to mean "a total want of appetite", "nausea".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=malacia|title=mălăcĭa|last=Lewis|first=Charlton T., Ph.D.|authorlink=Charlton Thomas Lewis|last2=Short|first2=Charles, LL.D.|authorlink2=|date=1879|website=A Latin Dictionary|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Malacia" in English ==

In English, the word "[[malacia]]" is used in medicine to mean an abnormal craving for certain kinds of food, and in pathology to mean an abnormal softening of organs or tissues of the human body.

==''Malakia'' and ''malakas'' in modern Greek==
{{Main article|Malakas}}

In modern Greek, the word μαλακία – ''malakia'' has come to mean "[[masturbation]]", and its derivative μαλάκας – ''malakas'' means "one who masturbates". Depending on the tone of voice, this term can be used colloquially as a friendly greeting or in a derogatory sense when angry. This word is very common in modern Greece.

== Greek attitude toward effeminacy ==

[[Herodotus]] recounted that, when the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] king [[Cyrus the Great]] asked [[Croesus]], a defeated king who was now his counsellor, what he should do in view of a revolt of the [[Lydia]]ns, Croesus advised him to punish the leader, "but let the Lydians be pardoned; and lay on them this command, that they may not revolt or be dangerous to you; then, I say, and forbid them to possess weapons of war, and command them to wear tunics under their cloaks and buskins on their feet, and to teach their sons lyre-playing and song and dance and huckstering. Then, O King, you will soon see them turned to women instead of men; and thus you need not fear lest they revolt."&lt;ref name = "Herodotus69"&gt;''The Histories'', Herodotus, trans. Robin Waterfield, Oxford University Press, NY, 1998. Book I, 155–157; pg 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the word ''malakia'' is not used in the Greek original of this text.

The Greek idea that those engaged in mechanical trades incurred effeminacy was expressed by [[Xenophon]] (the word translated here as "effeminate" is unrelated to ''malakia''):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Men do indeed speak ill of those occupations which are called handicrafts, and they are rightly held of little repute in communities, because they weaken the bodies of those who make their living at them by compelling them to sit and pass their days indoors. Some indeed work all the time by a fire. But when the body becomes effeminate (''thelunomenos'') the mind too is debilitated. Besides, these mechanical occupations (''[[banausos]]'') leave a man no leisure to attend to his friends' interests, or the public interest. This class therefore cannot be of much use to his friends or defend his country. Indeed, some states, especially the most warlike, do not allow a citizen to engage in these handicraft occupations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Greeks|last=Kitto|first=H.|work=quoting Xenophon, ''Oeconomicus'', chapter IV|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1968|isbn=978-0-20236972-3|location=|pages=240|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Marabou''' ({{lang-fr|marabout}}) is a term of [[Haiti]]an origin denoting multiracial admixture. The term describes the offspring of a Haitian person of mixed race: Africans, [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], Taíno Indian and [[South Asian ethnic groups|South Asians]] ([[East Indians]]) ancestry.

The Marabou label dates to the colonial period of Haiti’s history, meaning the offspring of a mullato  and a griffe person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Stephen Farmer|title=Americanisms--old &amp; New|date=1889|page=377|quote=Mulatto. — A name given to the offspring of a white and a negro. The word is Spanish, mulato from mulo a mule, or, as in ... meamelouc ; Griffe, {{!}} black, negro and mulatto; Marabou, § black, mulatto and griffe; Sacatra, g black, griffe and negro.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana|date=1925|publisher=[[Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana]]|page=533|language=Spanish|quote=De este modo, el hijo de mulato y negra es un griffe, y el de griffe y negro unmarabou ó marabout y así sucesivamente.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Médéric-Louis-Elie Moreau de Saint-Méry, in his 3-volume work on the colony&lt;ref&gt;Médéric-Louis-Elie Moreau de Saint-Méry. Description topographique, physique, civile, politique et historique de la partie francaise de lisle Saint-Domingue. 3 vols.(Philadelphia, 1797).&lt;/ref&gt; describes Marabous as the product of the union of a black and a [[quadroon]], he says nothing concerning East Indians. The East Indian association with that term is probably due solely to the resemblance between dark-skinned Indians and marabous. Describing Marabous as an ethnic group is a stretch since the term applies to any person of mixed heritage with dark skin and straight or wavy hair. Marabous are no more an ethnic group than grimeaus, [[mulatto]]es, quadroons, or [[octoroon]]s are; these terms merely describe the different phenotypes of mixed-race people.

'''Mexicans in France''' refers to [[Mexico|Mexicans]] and their French-born descendants. Paris is the main point of residence for Mexicans, but there are also considerable numbers in [[Strasbourg]] and [[Marseille]].

The House of Mexico in Paris is one of 37 residences in the Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris (CIUP) and was created by the governments of Mexico and France in 1953 to host young university students from Mexico and other [[Hispanic America]]n countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casademexico.org/?lang=es Casa de México en París.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Virgen de Guadalupe Notre Dame Paris Francia.JPG|thumb|Chapel of the Virgin of Guadalupe at the [[Cathedral of Notre Dame]], Paris, France.]]
'''Porfirio Díaz in Europe'''

After resigning, [[Porfirio Díaz]] and his family began to pack up to retire into exile in Paris, France. After dismissing their former servants paying in gold coins, the Diaz family went to the train station of Santa Clara, south of the capital. Victoriano Huerta was asked to escort the caravan to Veracruz, where one would take steamboat to [[La Coruña]]. On May 26, Porfirio and Carmen Romero Rubio, accompanied by the children of General -except Amada- and sisters Carmen, went toward the port of [[Veracruz]]. Along the way on the morning of May 27, just before reaching the city of [[Orizaba]], the train was attacked by bandits, which were repelled by federal forces Huerta, and managed to capture more than half the assailants. Arriving in Veracruz the night of that day, and contrary to what happened in other parts of the country, Díaz was greeted with banquets, dinners, dances and parties in his honor. Finally on the morning of May 31, on board the ship German ''Ypiranga'' Porfirio Díaz and his family left the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Porfirio Díaz began touring Europe and its main capitals with his wife. In April 1912, he was received in the [[Zarzuela Palace]], Madrid by the King of Spain, [[Alfonso XIII]], who invited him to reside in the Iberian Peninsula and presented him with a sword as a gift. Later he toured [[San Sebastián]] and [[Zaragoza]]. The Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] of Germany sent him in Zaragoza tickets to witness the maneuvers of his army in [[Munich]], where they arrived on the eve of the [[First World War]]. After fixing his residence in Paris, Diaz used to go to [[Biarritz]] and [[St. Jean de Luz]], on the French coast during the winter. In early 1913, began a tour of North Africa and their journey took them to meet in [[Cairo]], where he toured The Sphinx and the Pyramid of Cheops. In the latter, Díaz was portrayed in a photograph owned General National Archive. During his return to Europe, he visited [[Naples]] and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, Díaz began to be aware of the transgressions that had occurred in Mexico, thanks to several of his old friends used to go visit him. In late 1913, Porfirio was visited by his daughters Amada and Luz, who remained with their father a few months and together toured [[Switzerland]] and the Alps. During the last months of 1914 and early 1915, his health began to seriously deteriorate and later, in June 1915, her doctor ordered him to rest in his bed, so he had to leave their daily morning walks in the forest of Bologna. According to the stories of Carmen Romero Rubio, her husband suffered from hallucinations. On July 2, finally the word had lost track of time and his doctor was called at noon and six p.m. and thirty-two minutes (French time), José de la Cruz Porfirio Díaz Mori died at the age of eighty-four years. He was buried in the church of Saint Honoré l'Eylau, and December 27, 1921 his remains were moved to the [[Montparnasse Cemetery]] in Paris. When Carmen Romero Rubio returned to the country in 1931, she left Díaz's remains in France. Since the year of 1989, Mexico has expressed intentions to return to Mexico the remains of Díaz, without achieving results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3609">This list contains '''mottos of Norwegian institutions'''. Norway does not have a [[state motto]]; however, the personal motto of the reigning monarch can be said to fill some of that function. The motto of the three last monarchs has been ''Alt for Norge'' which translates roughly as ''All for Norway''. The motto was first chosen by King [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]] and immortalised as the rallying motto of the [[Norwegian resistance in World War II|Norwegian resistance]] against the [[German occupation of Norway]]. It is not common for Norwegian municipalities or government agencies to have mottos.

The '''Muslim Halwai''' ([[Urdu language|Urdu]]: حلواى ) are a [[Muslim]] community found in various part of India and Pakistan, mainly in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. They have their ancestral backgrounds from Arabian Adnani Tribes. [[Halwai]] [[caste]], &gt; [[Halva]] means ''sweets'' in [[Hindi]] and ''Halvai'' or ''Halwai'' are sweet makers. Their preferred self-designation is Shaikh. They are also known as Siddiqui, Faridi and Adnani ( Adnaani).

==History and origin==

The Halwai are a community associated with the manufacture of sweetmeats. Their name comes from the [[Arabic]] word [[Halva]], which means a sweetmeat. The Muslim Halwai community came in India with Humayoon from Iran as his soldiers. They belong to the [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] category and they have their ancestral backgrounds from Arabian Adnani tribes.Their ancestors were not Hindu it proves their ancestral backgrounds and also their sweet products as Halwai, Halwai e sohaan, Mansoor, Chashni, Gazak, Lauzeena etc. The words belong to either Arabian or Persian.

They have the following subdivision, the Purbi or eastern and Pachaon or western group, and speak [[Urdu]], as well as local dialects of [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. These sub-divisions are further divided into clans, known as ''biradaris'', which claim descent from a common ancestor. Important biradaris include the Tobacco Traders, The biscuit Traders and the Sweet Makers but Halwai is common among them. Marriages are preferred within the biradari, and only rarely will take place outside the community.

==Present circumstances==
The Halwai are a [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]] community. They also visit the shrines of various [[Sufi]] saints found in [[North India]], such as Khwaja [[Moinuddin Chishti]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three by K S Singh page 1042 Manohar Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

They are a landless community, involved in the selling of sweetmeats, tobacco, and well as the occupation of dyeing clothes. Members of the community members have taken up jobs in government and private service. They are largely an urban community, living in their residential quarters. Almost all older cities in [[North India]] and [[Pakistan]] have a ''Halwai Mohalla''&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three by K S Singh page 1240 Manohar Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Muslim Halwai have their own registered committee with name of [[ All India Muslim Halwai biradari committee]] to deal with matters relating to the community. Haji Mahmood Ahmad is a founder and President of all India Muslim halwai biradari committee.

{{Yoruba people}}
'''The Oku people of Sierra Leone ''' is an ethnic group of Sierra Leone and according to some scholars is a sub ethnic group of the [[Krio people]].

The Oku people are the descendants of educated  liberated [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] Muslims  from Southwest [[Nigeria]] who came to Sierra Leone as [[settlers]]  in the mid [[19th century]]. 

The Oku are virtually all Muslims at  99%, of the [[Sunni]] tradition of Islam, and are known for their deeply conservative Muslim tradition . The Oku traditions and culture are a combination of primarily Islamic and Western tradition. 

The British colonial government provided official recognition to the Oku community as a distinctive community in Sierra Leone. Although the Sierra Leone government officially classified  the  Oku people as  members of the Creole ethnic group.

The Oku people in Sierra Leone are mainly found in  the capital [[Freetown]], particularly in the Freetown neighborhood of [[Aberdeen, Sierra Leone|Aberdeen Village]], [[Fourah Bay]] and [[Fula Town]]. Most Oku people have [[Islamic]] first names and [[English name|English]] last names. Most Oku people also have [[Yoruba name|Yoruba]] middle names.

==Origin==
The Oku people are mainly descended from the Yoruba Liberated Africans that were resettled in Sierra Leone during the nineteenth century. These Liberated Africans formed a distinctive community based at Aberdeen village, Fourah Bay, and Fula Town. As early as the 1840s, there were references to 'Aku Mohammedans' and because the communities at Fourah Bay were distinctly of the Yoruba tribe, they were referred to as 'Aku' or 'Oku' Mohammedans.

==Culture==
The Oku people have a distinctive culture that has strong similarities with the [[Yoruba people]]. The Aku often have Arabic first and last names, although some Oku people later adopted the names of prominent benefactors such as Savage or other European surnames to gain admission into the missionary schools. It is not uncommon for some elder members of the Oku community to speak the Yoruba language in addition to the Oku variety of the Krio language.

==Relationship with the Sierra Leone Creole people==
Some scholars consider the Oku people as entirely distinct from the Creoles (Marriage Rites among the Aku (Yoruba) of Freetown, Olumbe Bassir
Africa: Journal of the International African Institute, Vol. 24, No. 3 (Jul., 1954), pp.&amp;nbsp;251–256) and some scholars consider the Oku as a sub-ethnic group of the Krio, rather than a separate ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aYmGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=krio+muslims+yoruba&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ViNOBI0lCa&amp;sig=ysoTqVkWGJ6xvBRC4_aPEJJnvZk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9dZOUpaDO9i14AO3mYHYCQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=krio%20muslims%20yoruba&amp;f=false |title=The Krio of West Africa: Islam, Culture, Creolization, and Colonialism in ... - Gibril R. Cole - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=15 September 2013 |accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars argue that the Oku community is a branch of the Sierra Leone Creole people due to some similar surnames and cultural aspects such as Awujoh. However, other scholars consider the Oku community as a distinctive community that has cultural practices that Creoles do not practice such as [[female genital mutilation]], participation in traditional African societies such as the Bondo society, traditional political leaders such as the Alkadi, and specific Muslim tenets. Some scholars also argue that the Oku people are primarily of Yoruba descent, in contrast to the Creole community which is of mixed [[Liberated Africans in Sierra Leone|Liberated African]], [[African American]] and [[West Indian]] descent.

==Community Organisation==
Oku communities in Sierra Leone are represented by an Alkadi, the community leader.

==Cultural Associations==
The Oku people are represented by cultural associations such as the Ebilleh Cultural Organization which aims to preserve and enhance Oku Mohammedan cultural heritage in Sierra Leone and abroad.

There are several levels of organisation of Pashtun tribes. The "tribe" is subdivided into kinship groups, each of which is a [[khel (clan)|''khel'']] and [[zai (tribe)|''zai'']]. A ''khel'' or Zai is further divided into "'''Plarina'''", each of which consists of several extended families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan017434.pdf Wardak, A. (2003) "Jirga – A Traditional Mechanism of Conflict Resolution in Afghanistan" p. 7], online at UNPAN (the United Nations Online Network in Public Administration and Finance), accessed 10 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A large tribe often has dozens of subtribes whose members may see themselves as belonging to each, some or all of the sub-tribes in their family tree depending upon the social situation: co-operative, competitive or confrontational.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan017434.pdf Wardak, A.

==Etymologies==
'''''Tarbur''''' refers to a "tribe" split into two or more clans and Tarbur mean cousin in Pashto so Tarbur could be enemy as well in the Pashtun culture that they can occupy your land or property. Every Pashtun tribe is then divide into subtribes, also called [[khel (clan)|''khel'']] or [[zai (tribe)|''zai'']]. ''Zai'' in Pashto means "descendant". In [[Avestan]] it is similar to Pashto "Zoi" meaning son or offspring. [[William Crooke]] has said that ''khel''  is from an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word meaning "association" or "company".&lt;ref&gt;Crooke, William (1896) ''The Tribes and Castes of the North-western Provinces and Oudh'' Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing, Calcutta, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GJQn7XA6Cz4C&amp;pg=PA158 p. 158], {{OCLC|4770515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''khel'' is often based in a single village,&lt;ref&gt;[http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan017434.pdf Wardak, A. (2003) "Jirga – A Traditional Mechanism of Conflict Resolution in Afghanistan" p. 6], online at UNPAN (the United Nations Online Network in Public Administration and Finance), accessed 10 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but it may also be based on a larger area including several villages, or part of a town.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Hans-Jörg (2006) ''Conflicts and Conflict Resolution in Middle Eastern Societies: Between Tradition and Modernity'' Duncker &amp; Humblot, Berlin, p. 358, {{ISBN|3-428-12220-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AfghanistanEssential"&gt;{{cite book | title=Afghanistan: Essential Field Guides to Humanitarian and Conflict Zones (2nd ed.) | publisher=Crosslines Ltd., | author=Wardak, A. | authorlink="The Tribal and Ethnic Composition of Afghan Society" ''in'' Girardet, Edward and Walter, Jonathan (2004) | year=2004 | location=Geneva | isbn=2-9700176-1-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Plarina''''' is related to the [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]] term ''plār'', which derives from [[Old Iranian]] ''piðar'' (in Bactrian and [[Pashto language|Pashto]], Old Iranian /ð/ usually yields /l/), and is related to [[Sanskrit]] ''pitar'' and English "father". The plural form of ''plār'' is ''plārina''. A ''plārina'' is considered only when the 7th generation is born, meaning the father of multiple families (''kahol''). Usually, the 7th forefather is assumed to take from one-and-a-half century to two centuries.  '''''Kul''''' (plural ''kahol'') is the smallest unit in Pashtun tribal system, named after an ancestor of 1. ''Zāmon'' ("children"), 2. ''Lmasay / Nwasay'' ("grandchildren"), 3. ''Kaṛwasay'' ("great-grandchildren"), and 4. ''Kaoday'' ("great-great-grandchildren"). Once the fourth generation is born, it would be labelled a "family" or ''kūl''.

==Dialects==
{{Main article|Pashto dialects}}

The '''Bettani''' speak various [[Pashto dialects]]. The [[Ghilji]] or (Gharzai) of the central region around [[Paktika Province|Paktika]] speak [[Central Pashto]], a dialect with unique phonetic features, transitional between the southern and the northern dialects of Pashto.&lt;ref name="UND" /&gt; The [[Lohani]] (Rohani, Nohani) [[Marwat]], as well as some other minor Lodi tribes and the Bettani proper, speak the Marwat [[Lodi (Pashtun tribe)|Lodi]] Bettani dialect, which is a southern Pashto variety, however, its phonetics are different from the southern [[Kandahari Pashto]]. The Sheerani tribe of the Bettani confederacy speaks another southern dialect. The northern Bettani clans speak the northern or "hard" Pashto variety. Some of the Bettani lineages, including some (but not all) clans of the [[Tanoli]], [[Niazi]], and [[Swati (Pashtun tribe)|Swati]] tribes, have abandoned Pashto. Today they speak other languages, like [[Urdu]], [[Hindko]], [[Saraiki dialect|Saraiki]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Dari language|Dari]].

The '''Gharghashti''' [[Kakar]] [[Naghar]] [[Panni]] [[Mandokhel]] and [[Musakhel (Pashtun tribe)|Musakhel]] and other minor settled in the region around [[Quetta]] [[Zhob]] ans Loralai speak dialect, which is a  "soft" Pashto dialect very similar to [[Kandahari Pashto]]. The Safi, some of the Jaduns, and some other minor northern Gharghashti tribes speak the northern or "hard" Pashto variety. The [[Jaduns]], living on the Mahabun mountain slopes around Swabi speak Pashto, while those living in Hazara speak Pashto and Hindko.&lt;ref name="UND"/&gt;{{rp|26}} Some clans of the [[Safi (Pashtun tribe)|Safi]] tribe speak the [[Pashayi languages]] but are mostly bilingual in Pashto.

The '''Karlani''' speak some of the most distinctive Pashto dialects which are lexically different from standard Pashto varieties, and phonetically very varied. Furthermore, the Karlani dialects have a tendency towards a change in the pronunciation of vowels. Depending on the particular dialect, the standard Pashto [a], [ā], [o], [u] may change into [ā], [â/å/o], [ȯ/ȫ/e], [i], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranica.com/articles/afghanistan-vi-pasto |title=AFGHANISTAN vi. Paṧto |last=Morgenstierne |first=Georg |authorlink=Georg Morgenstierne |date=15 December 1983 |website=Encyclopædia Iranica |accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Karlani dialects of [[Waziristan]], [[Bannu District|Bannu]], and [[Tani District|Tani (southern Khost)]], which follow the vowel shift to the greatest extent, these four vowels normally change into [ā], [o], [e], [i], respectively. Much of the [[Ormur]] tribe settled in some villages of Waziristan and Logar, who give their name to [[Ormur]] the folkloric ancestor of the [[Karlani]], speak the [[Ormuri language]] which is distinct from Pashto.&lt;ref name="UND"/&gt;{{rp|33}} However, in general the Ormur are bilingual in Pashto, particularly in the Karlani dialect of [[Wazirwola dialect|Wazirwola]].

The '''Sarbani''' tribes, Southwestern most notably the [[Durrani]], speak (Kandahari Pashto) a "soft" dialect of Pashto; while Northwestern Sarbani tribes such as [[Gigyani tribe]], [[Yousafzai]] etc , most notably they speak (Peshawari Pashto) Pashto a "hard" dialect of Pashto. Both of them are considered upper class dialects. In addition, a small section of the [[Tareen|Tarin]] clan of the Sarbani living east of [[Quetta]] speak the distinctive [[Wanetsi]] (Tareeno) dialect, which is considered by some modern scholars to be distinctive enough to be classified as its own language.&lt;ref&gt;Hallberg, Daniel G. 1992.

The origin of Pashtuns is unclear but historians have come across references to various ancient peoples called ''[[Pakthas]]'' (''Pactyans'') between the [[2nd millennium BC|2nd]] and the [[1st millennium BC|1st]] millennium,&lt;ref name="Nath"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Vedanta|last1=Nath|first1=Samir|year=2002|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=81-7890-056-4|page=273|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yGBaXO54-HwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA273#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heredotus"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.piney.com/Heredotus7.html|title=The History of Herodotus|chapter=7|others=Translated by [[George Rawlinson]]|publisher=The History Files|date=February 4, 1998|origyear=original written 440&amp;nbsp;BC|accessdate=10 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; who may be their early ancestors. Often characterised as a warrior and [[martial race]], their history is mostly spread among various countries of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Central Asia]], centered on their traditional seat of power in [[Name of Afghanistan|medieval Afghanistan]]. One theory suggests that the modern Ghilji lineages descended from the medieval [[Khalaj people|Khalaj]] or Khilji tribe. Some Bettani lineages, however, are said to have descended in part from the medieval [[Ghorids|Ghorid people]].The Bettani are named after their folkloric leader or ancestor, ''Shaikh Bet Baba'' (claimed to be among the first [[List of Pashto-language poets|Pashto-language poets]]), who lived in the Altamur range, located between the [[Logar Province|Logar]] and [[Zurmat District|Zurmat]] valleys. He is reported to have been buried in [[Ghazni]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;Balland, Daniel. ''Encyclopaedia Iranica''. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/betani BĒṬANĪ]. Originally published on 15 December 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century, the Bettani are known to have mainly inhabited the Logar, Zurmat, and Ghazni regions.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; Subsequently, many of their lineages settled to the northeast, spreading up to the [[Damaan Valley]], [[Mianwali District|Mianwali]], and parts of the present-day [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]] Division of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], Pakistan, in the east, and parts of [[Kunduz Province|Kunduz]]  Afghanistan in the north. In the 19th century, the traditional way of life of the Bettani combined small-scale [[irrigation|irrigated]] agriculture with seasonal [[nomad]]ism or seminomadism. They engaged in pastoral migrations, along the mountain slopes in summers, and inversely, towards the [[Indus River|Indus]] plains in winters.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;  From the 13th century, various Khilji dynasties and ruling entities took control in the [[list of rulers of Bengal|Bengal]] and [[Delhi Sultanate]]s of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

In the 15th century, the Lodi tribe founded the [[Lodi dynasty]], the last dynasty to rule the Delhi Sultanate. In the 16th century, the [[Sur Empire]] with its capital at [[Delhi]] was founded by [[Sher Shah Suri]], a member of the [[Sur (Pashtun tribe)|Sur]] clan of the Bettani confederacy. Between 1709 and 1738, the [[Hotak]] clan of the Ghilji tribe ruled the [[Hotak Empire]] based first in [[Kandahar]], Afghanistan and later very briefly in [[Isfahan]], Persia.&lt;ref name="Ewans"&gt;{{cite book|title=Afghanistan: a short history of its people and politics|last1=Ewans|first1=Martin|authorlink=|author2=Sir Martin Ewans|volume=|year=2002|publisher=Perennial|location=New York|isbn=0060505087|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pqNGBEmHUd4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, [[Taj Khan Karrani]] of the Karlani tribe founded the [[Karrani dynasty]], the last dynasty to rule the [[Bengal Sultanate]]. Several Karlani clans served in the [[army of the Mughal Empire|Mughal army]]. The [[Bhopal State]], in the present-day [[Madhya Pradesh]] state of Central India, was founded in 1723 by [[Dost Mohammad Khan, Nawab of Bhopal|Dost Mohammad Khan Mirazikhel]].

The origin of the Sarbani might be connected with the [[Hephthalites]] (''Ebodalo''),&lt;ref name="Kurbanov"&gt;[http://www.diss.fu-berlin.de/diss/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/FUDISS_derivate_000000007165/01_Text.pdf?hosts= The Hephthalites: Archaeological and Historical Analysis, Aydogdu Kurbanov, Berlin, 2010, page 242.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|242}} who had a large nomadic confederation in the 5th–6th centuries CE, as well as with the [[Scythians]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y20MTE0C9kwC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=scythian+durrani&amp;hl=sr&amp;ei=qzXBTtHSDtOwhAeN94G-BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=scyth&amp;f=false A brief history of Afghanistan, Shaista Wahab, Barry Youngerman, Infobase Publishing, 2007, page 14.]&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[Scythian languages|languages]] are also known to be in the [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian]] group along with Pashto. These groups were settled where most of Pashtuns live today.

[[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] of the Sadozai clan of the ''Abdali'' tribe (now known as "Durrani" after him) established the [[Durrani Empire]] in 1747 with its capital at [[Kandahar]]. Ahmad Shah adopted the title ''Durr-e Durrānī'' ("pearl of pearls" or "pearl of the age"), and the name of his tribe ''Abdali'' was changed to "Durrani" after him.&lt;ref name="Kurbanov"/&gt;{{rp|242}} Ahmad Shah is now regarded as the founder of the modern state of Afghanistan. He controlled areas from [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] in the west up to [[Kashmir]] and [[Delhi]] in the east, and from the [[Amu Darya]] in the north up to the [[Arabian Sea]] in the south. It was the second-greatest Muslim empire in the second half of the 18th century, surpassed in size only by the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan/21395/Nadir-Shah#toc21396 |title=The Durrani dynasty |work=Louis Dupree, Nancy Hatch Dupree and others |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5727">A '''rainbow party''' is a supposed [[group sex]] event featured in an [[urban legend]] spread since the early 2000s. A variant of other [[sex party (group sex)|sex party]] urban myths, the stories claim that at these events, allegedly increasingly popular among adolescents, females wearing various shades of [[lipstick]] take turns [[fellatio|fellating]] males in sequence, leaving multiple colors (a "[[rainbow]]") on their penises.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news| author=Lewin, Tamar| date=2005-06-30| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/30/fashion/thursdaystyles/30rainbow.html| title=Are These Parties for Real| publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The idea was publicized on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in 2003, and became the subject of a juvenile novel called ''Rainbow Party''.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; Sex researchers and adolescent health care professionals have found no evidence for the existence of rainbow parties, and consequently attribute the spread of the stories to a [[moral panic]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; On May 27, 2010 the television program ''[[The Doctors (2008 TV series)|The Doctors]]'' discussed the topic with dozens of teens, parents, and professionals.

==Origin==
The story was originally related by American [[pediatrician]] Meg Meeker in her 2002 book ''Epidemic: How Teen Sex Is Killing Our Kids''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Meeker, Meg | title=Epidemic: How Teen Sex Is Killing Our Kids | publisher = Lifeline Press | date = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-89526-143-4 | url = https://archive.org/details/epidemichowteens00meek }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book related case stories of adolescents suffering cancer, sterility, acute infections, and unwanted pregnancies as a consequence of starting sexual activity too early in life.  Meeker relates the following story from a 14-year-old patient from Michigan:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Allyson] had heard some kids were going to have a "rainbow party," but had no idea what that meant.  Still, she thought it might be fun, and arranged to attend with a friend.  After she arrived, several girls (all in the eighth grade) were given different shades of lipstick and told to perform oral sex on different boys to give them "rainbows."  Once she realized what was happening, Allyson was too stunned and frightened to do anything.  When a girl gave her some lipstick, she refused at first but, with repeated pressure, finally gave in.  "It was one of the grossest things I've ever done."&lt;ref&gt;Meeker, p22-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==On ''The Oprah Winfrey Show''==
The idea of the rainbow party was publicized in October 2003 on the episode of ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' titled "Is Your Child Leading a Double Life?", which was about the trend of increasing sexual [[promiscuity]] among American youth and the lack of parental awareness of the sexual practices of their children. In the ''[[O: The Oprah Magazine|O Magazine]]'' Michelle Burford asserted, among other things, that many teens across the United States engaged in rainbow parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Trystan T. Cotten, Kimberly Springer eds.| title=Stories of Oprah: the Oprahfication of American culture | isbn=978-1-60473-407-2 | publisher=University Press of Mississippi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book==
''Rainbow Party'' is a [[novel]] commissioned by a [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] editor.&lt;ref name=Memmott&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=USA Today | date= 2005-05-22 | title= Controversy colors teen book | last1= Memmott | first1=Carol| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2005-05-22-rainbow-usat_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author is [[Paul Ruditis]]. The book, which ''[[Library Journal]]'' declined to review, is about teens who fantasize about having a rainbow party.

The book has proven controversial, as it was meant for teenagers (recommended by the publisher for ages 14 and up), thus raising questions about its propriety. In turn, concerns were raised that excluding the book from bookstores and libraries would amount to censorship. The publishers justified ''Rainbow Party'' on the grounds that it was a cautionary tale intended to teach readers that oral sex can be dangerous.&lt;ref name=Memmott /&gt;

==Legend==
[[Deborah Tolman]], director of the [[Center for Research on Gender and Sexuality]] at [[San Francisco State University]], writes:  "This 'phenomenon' has all the classic hallmarks of a [[moral panic]]. One day we have never heard of rainbow parties and then suddenly they are everywhere, feeding on adults' fears that morally-bankrupt sexuality among teens is rampant, despite any actual evidence, as well as evidence to the contrary." Tolman finds that several features of the story ring false. She was skeptical that many adolescent girls would be motivated to engage in such activity in the face of the severe social stigma still attached to sexual activity, and rejected the idea that adolescent boys would examine each other's lipstick marks. However, the urban legend was widespread; an informal survey taken by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2005 found that most teenagers between the ages of 13 and 16 were familiar with the rumor.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

Canadian parenting coach Lisa Bunnage claimed in a 2014 TEDxSFU talk that such parties were taking place. She claimed that despite rainbow parties being described by Wikipedia as an urban legend, they were an ongoing issue.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnage, Lisa. 2014. "TED Talk at SFU." ''YouTube''.

== Scripts ==
[[File:Rohingya Arabic script crop.jpg|thumb|375px|Rohingya Arabic script]]

=== Arabic script ===
Written in [[Arabic script]], the first Rohingya language texts are more than 200 years old.&lt;ref name=proposal /&gt; While [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] was under British rule (1826–1948), the Rohingya people used mainly English and Urdu for written communication. Since independence in 1948, Burmese has been used in all official communications. Since the early 1960s, Rohingya scholars have started to realize the need for a writing system suited to their own language.

In 1975 a writing system was developed using Arabic letters; other scholars adopted [[Urdu script]] to remedy some deficiencies of the Arabic. Neither proved satisfactory, however, and most Rohingyas found it difficult to read the language in either version.

Following these attempts, Maulana Hanif achieved a dedicated [[right-to-left]] [[alphabet]] for the Rohingya language in 1983. Named after its author, the [[Hanifi alphabet]] is a modified form of the [[Arabic alphabet]], with additional borrowings from [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Burmese alphabet|Burmese]] alphabets.&lt;ref name=pandey&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unicode.org/L2/L2012/12214-rohingya.pdf |title=Preliminary Proposal to Encode the Rohingya Script ||last=Pandey |first=Anshuman |date=2012-06-20 |website=Expanding Unicode |publisher=Anshuman Pandey |access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there is a [https://sites.google.com/site/rohingyafonna/ Rohingya Unicode font] available. It is based on Arabic letters (since those are far more understood by the people) with additional tone signs.&lt;ref name=proposal&gt;{{cite web |first1=Lorna A. |last1=Priest |first2=Martin |last2=Hosken |author3=[[SIL International]] |title=''Proposal to add Arabic script characters for African and Asian languages'' |date=2010-08-12 |url=http://www.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3882.pdf |pages=13–18, 34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pandey /&gt; Tests that have been conducted suggest that this script can be learned in a matter of hours if the reader has learned Arabic in a madrassa.

The Rohingya Fonna Unicode keyboard layout as well as a free font can be found [https://sites.google.com/site/rohingyafonna/ here.]

=== Roman script ===
In 1999 E.M. Siddique Basu was able to simplify the Rohingya writing using Latin letters. It is an intuitive writing system which can be learnt easily and is known as Rohingyalish or Rohingya Fonna that uses only 26 Roman letters, five accented vowels, and two additional Latin characters for retroflex and nasal sounds.

Q, V, and X are only used for loan-words. &lt;ref name="Omniglot"&gt;[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/rohingya.htm "Rohingya", Omniglot]&lt;/ref&gt;

The character set table of the Rohingya language writing system uses the Latin letters shown above (ç and ñ with green background). The vowels are written both unaccented (aeiou) and accented (áéíóú). The use of c, ç and [[ñ]] is adapted to the language; c represents {{IPA|/ʃ/}} (English ''sh''), ç is the [[retroflex]] r ({{IPAblink| ɽ}}),&lt;ref name=proposal /&gt; and ñ indicates a [[nasalized]] vowel (e.g., ''fañs'' {{IPA|/fãs/}} 'five'). Crucially, these can all be accessed from an English keyboard, for example by using the [[Keyboard layout#US-International|English (US) International]] keyboard.

==== Names and pronunciation of letters ====
The names of the letters of the Latin Rohingya alphabet are similar to the names of the letters of the English alphabet.

There are six vowels and several diphthongs in the Rohingya language.&lt;ref name=scribd&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/21180958|title=
روهنغيا قائده |author=Kazi Mujibuddin bin Abul khair |via=Scribd|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They contrast between "open-o" ({{IPAblink|ɔ}}) and "closed-o" ({{IPAblink|o}}) by using the different spellings {{angbr|o}}/{{angbr|ó}} and {{angbr|ou}}/{{angbr|óu}} respectively.

=== Tones ===

Accented vowels, marked with an [[acute accent]], represent stressed (or "hard" vowels), and repeating a vowel lengthens it.&lt;ref name=website /&gt;  Thus, tonals are marked by arranging the location of a stressed vowel in a lengthened pair, like {{angbr|aá}} and {{angbr|áa}}.&lt;ref name=website /&gt;

== Grammar ==

=== Definite articles ===
1. If a noun ends with a vowel then the article is either '''án''' or '''wá''' if singular, or '''ún''' if plural or uncountable.&lt;br&gt;Usually '''wá''' is used for round-fatty objects, and '''án''' for flat-thin objects.
       '''( singular )'''                        '''( plural )'''
  Kéti  án     ''(the farm)''          Kéti  ún     ''(the farms)''
  Fothú án     ''(the picture)''       Fothú ún     ''(the pictures)''
  Fata  wá     ''(the leaf)''          Fata  ún     ''(the leaves)''
  Boro  wá     ''(the large)''         Boro  ún     ''(the large)''{{clarifyme|"large" is not a noun|date=May 2018}}
                                   Lou   ún     ''(the blood)''

2. If a noun ends with a consonant then the article is the end-consonant plus '''án''' or '''wá''' for singular or '''ún''' for plural.
  Deba'''l'''  '''l'''án   ''(the wall)''          Deba'''l'''  '''l'''ún   ''(the walls)''
  Me'''s'''    '''s'''án   ''(the table)''         Me'''s'''    '''s'''ún   ''(the tables)''
  Kita'''p'''  '''p'''wá   ''(the book)''          Kita'''p'''  '''p'''ún   ''(the books)''
  Manúi'''c''' '''c'''wá   ''(the man)''           Manúi'''c''' '''c'''ún   ''(the men)''

3. If a noun ends with '''r''', then the article is '''g''' plus '''án''' or '''wá''' for singular or '''ún''' or '''ín''' for plural.
  Tar   '''g'''án    ''(the wire)''          Tar   '''g'''ún/'''g'''ín ''(the wires)''
  Duar  '''g'''án    ''(the door)''          Duar  '''g'''ún/'''g'''ín ''(the doors)''
  Kuñir '''g'''wá    ''(the dog)''           Kuñir '''g'''ún/'''g'''ín ''(the dogs)''
  Faár  '''g'''wá    ''(the mountain)''      Faár  '''g'''ún/'''g'''ín ''(the mountains)''
  
  Note: '''gún''' is used for human and '''gín''' for non-human.

=== Indefinite articles ===
Indefinite articles can be used either before or after the noun. '''Uggwá''' usually is used for roll/round/fatty shaped objects and '''ekkán''' is for thin/flat shaped objects.

     '''( singular )'''                     '''( plural )'''
  Uggwá fata    ''(a leaf)''           Hodún fata    ''(some leaves)''
  Ekkán fothú   ''(a picture)''        Hodún Fothú   ''(some pictures)''
      -or-                               -or-
  Fata  uggwá   ''(a leaf)''           Fata  hodún   ''(some leaves)''
  Fothú ekkán   ''(a picture)''        Fothú hodún   ''(some pictures)''

=== Tenses ===
Rohingya distinguishes 12 tenses, as shown in the examples below. In these tenses, the helping verb '''félai''' shows perfect action (comparable to English "has/have") and '''félaat''' shows perfect continuous action (compare English "has/have been"). The helping verb '''táki''' and '''táikki''' are comparable to English "be" and "been".

Verb-form-suffix (basic and/or helping verb) indicate both person and tense. The suffixes '''~ir''', '''~yi''', '''~lám''', '''~youm''' are used for the first person, the suffixes '''~or''', '''~yó''', '''~lá''', '''~bá''' for the 2nd person, and the suffixes '''~ar''', '''~ye''', '''~l''', '''~bou''' for the 3rd person.
Similarly '''~ir''', '''~or''', '''~ar''' indicate present continuous tense, '''~yi''', '''~yó''', '''~ye''' present perfect tense, '''~lám''', '''~lá''', '''~l'''  past tense, and '''~youm''', '''~bá''', '''~bou''' future tense.

&lt;br&gt;'''First person ( I ):'''

'''Scottish society in the early modern era''' encompasses the social structure and relations that existed in [[Scotland in the Early Modern Era|Scotland between the early sixteenth century and the mid-eighteenth century]]. It roughly corresponds to the [[Early modern Europe|early modern era in Europe]], beginning with the [[Renaissance Scotland|Renaissance]] and [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] and ending with the last [[Jacobite risings]] and the beginnings of the [[industrial revolution]].

Scotland in this period was a hierarchical society, with a complex series of ranks and orders. This was headed by the monarch and the great [[magnates]]. Below them were the [[laird]]s, who emerged as a distinct group at the top of local society was whose position was consolidated by economic and administrative change. Below the lairds in rural society were a variety of groups, often ill-defined, including [[yeoman|yeomen]], who were often major landholders, and the [[husbandmen]], who were landholders, followed by [[cottar]]s and grassmen, who often had only limited rights to common land and pasture. Urban society was led by wealthy merchants, who were often [[burgess (title)|burgess]]es. Beneath them, and often in conflict with the urban elite, were the [[Artisan|craftsmen]]. Beneath these ranks, in both urban and rural society, there were a variety of groups of mobile "masterless men", the unemployed and vagrants.

Kinship was [[agnatic]], with descent counted only through the male line, helping to build the importance of surnames and clans. The increased power of the state and economic change eroded the power of these organisations, and this process would accelerate as the government responded to the threat of [[Jacobite risings]] by undermining the power of clan chiefs in the eighteenth century. The Reformation had a major impact on family life, changing the nature of baptism, marriage and burials, leading to a change in wider relationships, sacramental status and burial practices and placing a greater emphasis on the role of the father.

Limited demographic evidence indicates a generally expanding population, limited by short-term subsistence crises, of which the most severe was probably that of the "seven ill years" of the 1690s. The urban centres of the burghs continued to grow, with the largest being Edinburgh, followed by Glasgow. Population growth and economic dislocation from the second half of the sixteenth century led to a growing problem of vagrancy, which was responded to by a series of Acts of Parliament that established what would become the "[[Old Scottish Poor Law|Old Poor Law]]", which attempted to ensure relief for the "deserving" local poor, but punishments for the mobile unemployed and beggars. The [[patriarchal]] nature of society meant that women were directed to be subservient to their husbands and families. They remained an important part of the workforce and some were economically independent, while others lived a marginal existence. At the beginning of the period women had little or no legal status, but were increasingly criminalised after the Reformation, and were the major subjects of the [[witch hunt]]s that occurred in relatively large numbers until the end of the seventeenth century.

==Social structure==
===Aristocracy===
[[File:Scotsranksearlymodern.jpg|thumb|right|400px|A table of ranks in early modern Scottish society]]
Early modern Scotland was a hierarchical society, with a series of ranks and marks of status. Below the king were the great [[magnates]], who by this period were no longer a [[feudal]] nobility, whose power was based on territorial landholding, but an honorific peerage, and land had become a commodity to be traded.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991p28&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0748602763}}, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; They were headed by a small number of [[duke]]s (usually descended from very close relatives of the king) and a larger group of [[List of earls#Earls of Scotland|earl]]s. These senior nobles formed the political classes at the beginning of the period: sometimes holding major office, holding a place on the king's council and taking part in the major crises and rebellions of the period.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp12-22&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0748602763}}, pp. 12–22.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered themselves the king's "natural councillors" and were also the heads of a system of local patronage and loyalty. This was often formalised through bonds of [[manrent]] that set out mutual obligations and allegiances.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp30-3&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0748602763}}, pp. 30–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the magnates were the [[baron]]s, who held increasingly nominal feudal tenures of which an important vestige was the right to hold baronial courts,&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp30-3/&gt; which could deal with both matters of land ownership and interpersonal offences, including minor acts of violence.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), {{ISBN|074860233X}}, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Also important were the local [[Tenant-in-chief|tenants-in-chief]], who held legally held their land directly from the king and who by this period were often the major local landholders in an area. In this period, as feudal distinctions declined, the barons and tenants-in-chief merged to form a new identifiable group, the [[laird]]s.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), {{ISBN|074860233X}}, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; This group was roughly equivalent to the English [[gentlemen]].&lt;ref name=Grant2000&gt;A. Grant, "Service and tenure in late medieval Scotland 1324–1475" in A. Curry and E. Matthew, eds, ''Concepts and Patterns of Service in the Later Middle Ages'' (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2000), {{ISBN|0851158145}}, pp. 145–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the magnates saw themselves as the king's natural counsellors, so the lairds advised and exerted influence over the dukes and earls. The lairds were often the most important individual in a local community. They ran baronial courts, acted as [[Sheriff principal|sheriffs-depute]], sat on local [[assize]]s and were called in as private arbitrators. In the course of the sixteenth century they would acquire a role in national politics, gaining representation in [[Parliament of Scotland|Parliament]] and playing a major role in the [[Scottish Reformation Parliament|Reformation crisis of 1560]].&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp30-3/&gt; As a result of the Reformation and the creation of a [[Presbyterian]] [[Church of Scotland|Kirk]], their position in local society was enhanced. They often gained the new status of [[Presbyterian polity#Elder|elder]] and greater oversight of the behaviour of the local population through the disciplinary functions of [[Session (Presbyterian)|kirk sessions]].&lt;ref name=Wormald1991p138&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0748602763}}, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle ranks===
[[File:Richard Lauder.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Richard Lauder, Laird of Haltoun, d. 1675, member of an increasing defined and important social group]]
Below the lairds were a variety of groups, often ill-defined. These included [[yeomen]], later characterised by [[Walter Scott]] as  "bonnet lairds", often owning substantial land.&lt;ref name="Mitcheson1983p80" /&gt; The practice of feuing (by which a tenant paid an entry sum and an annual feu duty, but could pass the land on to their heirs) meant that the number of people holding heritable possession of lands, which had previously been controlled by the church or nobility, expanded.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp51-2&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0748602763}}, pp. 51–2.&lt;/ref&gt; These and the lairds probably numbered about 10,000 by the seventeenth century&lt;ref name="Mitcheson1983p80"/&gt; and became what the government defined as [[heritor]]s, on whom the financial and legal burdens of local government increasingly fell.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. A. Dawson, ''Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0748614559}}, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the substantial landholders were those engaged in subsistence agriculture, who made up the majority of the working population.&lt;ref&gt;A. Grant, "Late medieval foundations", in A. Grant and K. J. Stringer, eds, ''Uniting the Kingdom?: the Making of British History'' (London: Routledge, 1995), {{ISBN|0415130417}}, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Those with property rights included [[husbandmen]], lesser landholders and free tenants.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983p82/&gt; Most farming was based on the lowland fermtoun or highland [[Township (Scotland)|baile]], settlements of a handful of families that held individual land rights, but jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp41-55&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0276-3}}, pp. 41–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Below them were the [[cottar]]s, who often shared rights to common pasture, occupied small portions of land and participated in joint farming as hired labour. Farms also might have grassmen, who had rights only to grazing. Eighteenth-century evidence suggests that the children of cottars and grassmen often became servants in agriculture or handicrafts.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983p82&gt;R. Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), {{ISBN|074860233X}}, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;  Serfdom had died out in Scotland in the fourteenth century, but was virtually restored by statute law for miners and saltworkers.&lt;ref name=Mitcheson1983p80&gt;R. Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), {{ISBN|074860233X}}, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Society in the urban settlements of the [[burgh]]s was headed by wealthier merchants, who often held local office as a [[burgess (title)|burgess]], [[alderman]], [[bailie]]s, or as a member of the burgh council.&lt;ref&gt;K. Stevenson, "Thai war callit knynchtis and bere the name and the honour of that hye ordre: Scottish knighthood in the fifteenth century", in L. Clark, ed., ''Identity and Insurgency in the Late Middle Ages'' (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2006), {{ISBN|1843832704}}, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Below them were [[Artisan|craftsmen]] and workers that made up the majority of the urban population.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp48-9&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0748602763}}, pp. 48–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Both merchants and craftsmen often served a long apprenticeship, acquiring skills and status, before they became freemen of a burgh, and could enjoy certain rights and privileges. Major sources of trade included the export of wool, fish, coal, salt and cattle. Imports included wine, sugar and other luxury goods. Important crafts included metal working, carpentry, leather working, pottery and later brewing and wig-making.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), {{ISBN|074860233X}}, pp. 100–3.&lt;/ref&gt; There were frequent disputes between the burgesses and craftsmen over rights and political control of the burgh, occasionally bursting into violence, as occurred at Perth in the first half of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;M. Verschuur, "Merchants and craftsmen in sixteenth-century Perth", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Early Modern Town in Scotland'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1987), {{ISBN|0709916779}}, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The poor===
[[File:Thatched house in 'Baile Gean', Highland Folk Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Thatch]]ed house in 'Baile Gean' [[Township (Scotland)|township]], [[Highland Folk Museum]] illustrates rural poverty.]]
At the bottom of society were the "masterless men" and women (who lacked a clear social relationship with a social superior, such as service or apprenticeship) the unemployed and vagrants, whose numbers were swelled in times of economic downturn or hardship.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. A. Dawson, ''Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0748614559}}, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; Masterless women may have made up as much as 18 per cent of all households and particularly worried authorities.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lynch, "Preaching to the converted?: perspectives on the Scottish Reformation", in A. Alasdair A. MacDonald, M. Lynch and I. B. Cowan, ''The Renaissance in Scotland: Studies in Literature, Religion, History, and Culture Offered to John Durkhan'' (BRILL, 1994), {{ISBN|9004100970}}, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; In rural society those that needed relief from extreme hardship tended from the lowest ranks of rural society, including cottars, labourers and servants. Most of those who took to the roads, around three quarters, were men. Most had a disability such as blindness, or claimed to have suffered a personal disaster such as fire or theft. Some were discharged soldiers and sailors, probably returning home or searching for work. Most tended to move around a restricted area, probably moving between a limited number of parishes in search of work and relief. For some this may have been tied to the agricultural calendar, and individuals may have moved in a circuit as different foodstuffs and work became available.&lt;ref&gt;I. D. Whyte, "Population mobility in early modern Scotland", in R. A. Houston and I. D. Whyte, eds, ''Scottish Society, 1500–1800'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0521891671}}, pp. 55–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Poor relief was more abundant in urban centres, particularly in the largest centres like Edinburgh. As a result, particularly in times of extreme hardship the poor would gravitate to the burghs. They could form a large section of society, with roughly a quarter of population of Perth in 1584 being classified as poor. The poor in urban society were a diverse group, the largest numbers women and most of those were [[widows]]. In Aberdeen in the period 1695–1705 three-quarters of the poor who received relief were women and of those two thirds were widows. The remainder were made up of servants, casual labourers, [[journeyman|journeymen]] artisans, beggars, vagrants and orphans.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Houston and I. D. Whyte, "Introduction" in R. A. Houston and I. D. Whyte, eds, ''Scottish Society, 1500–1800'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0521891671}}, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinship and clans==
{{Main|Scottish surnames|Scottish clans}}

Unlike in England, where kinship was predominately [[cognatic]], derived through both males and females, in Scotland kinship was [[agnatic]], with members of a group sharing a (sometimes fictional) common ancestor. Women retained their original surname at marriage and marriages were intended to create friendship between kin groups, rather than a new bond of kinship.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp29-35&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0748602763}}, pp. 29–35.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]] this was often reflected in a common surname. A shared surname has been seen as a "test of kinship", proving large bodies of kin who could call on each other’s support. At the beginning of the period this may have helped intensify the idea of the feud, which was usually carried out as a form of revenge for a kinsman, and for which a large body of kin could be counted on to support rival sides, although conflict within kin groups also occurred.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Armstrong, "The 'fyre of ire Kyndild' in the fifteenth-century Scottish Marches", in S. A. Throop and P. R. Hyams, eds, ''Vengeance in the Middle Ages: Emotion, Religion and Feud'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2010), {{ISBN|075466421X}}, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; From the reign of James VI, systems of judicial law were enforced, and by the early eighteenth century the feud had been suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), {{ISBN|074860233X}}, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Borders, the leadership of the heads of the great surnames was largely replaced by the authority of landholding lairds in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), {{ISBN|074860233X}}, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of agnatic kinship and a feudal system of obligation has been seen as creating the highland [[clan]] system.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. S. Barrow, ''Robert Bruce'' (Berkeley CA.: University of California Press, 1965), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The head of a clan was usually the eldest son of the last chief of the most powerful [[sept]] or branch.&lt;ref name=Roberts2000p13&gt;J. L. Roberts, ''Clan, King, and Covenant: History of the Highland Clans from the Civil War to the Glencoe Massacre'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2000), {{ISBN|0748613935}}, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The leading families of a clan formed the ''fine'', often seen as equivalent to lowland lairds, providing council in peace and leadership in war;&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Green, ''The Celtic World'' (London: Routledge, 1996), {{ISBN|0415146275}}, pp. 667.&lt;/ref&gt; below them were the ''daoine usisle'' (in Gaelic) or [[tacksmen]] (in Scots), who managed the clan lands and collected the rents.&lt;ref&gt;D. Moody, ''Scottish Family History'' (Baltimore, MA: Genealogical Publishing Com, 1994), {{ISBN|0806312688}}, pp. 99–104.&lt;/ref&gt; In the isles and along the adjacent western seaboard there were also ''buannachann'', who acted as a military elite, defending the clan lands from raids or taking part in attacks on clan enemies. Most of the followers of the clan were tenants, who supplied labour to the clan heads and sometimes acted as soldiers. In the early modern era they usually took the clan name as their surname, turning it into a massive, if often fictive, kin group.&lt;ref name=Roberts2000p13/&gt; Because the Highland Clans were not a direct threat to the Restoration government, or relations with England, the same effort was not put into suppressing their independence as had been focused on the Borders, until after the Glorious Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), {{ISBN|074860233X}}, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic change and the imposition of royal justice had begun to undermine the clan system before the eighteenth century, but the process was accelerated after the rebellion of 1745, with [[Highland dress]] banned, the enforced disarming of clansmen, the compulsory purchase of heritable jurisdictions, the exile of many chiefs, and the sending of ordinary clansmen to the colonies as indentured labour. All of this largely reduced clan leaders to the status of simple landholders within one generation.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), {{ISBN|074860233X}}, pp. 166–7.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

There was considerable concern over the safety of children in this period, prompted by high infant mortality. The abolition of [[godparents]] in the Reformation meant that baptism became a mechanism for emphasising the role and responsibilities of fathers.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hollander, "The name of the Father": baptism and the social construction of fatherhood in early modern Edinburgh", in E. Ewan and J.

There are almost no reliable sources with which to track the population of Scotland before the late seventeenth century. Estimates based on English records suggest that by the end of the Middle Ages, the [[Black Death]] and subsequent recurring outbreaks of the [[bubonic plague|plague]], may have caused the population of Scotland to fall as low as half a million people.&lt;ref name=Rigby2003p109-11&gt;S.

Distress was exacerbated by outbreaks of plague, with major epidemics in the periods 1584-8, 1595 and 1597–1609.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp166-8&gt;J.

The population expansion probably levelled off after the famine of the 1590s, as prices were relatively stable in the early seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Mitchison2002p145" /&gt; In the early seventeenth century famine was common, with four periods of famine prices between 1620 and 1625. The invasions of the 1640s had a profound impact on the Scottish economy, with the destruction of crops and the disruption of markets resulting in some of the most rapid price rises of the century, but population probably expanded in the period of stability that followed the [[Restoration in Scotland|Restoration]] in 1660.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), {{ISBN|0415278805}}, pp. 291–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Calculations based on [[Hearth Tax]] returns for 1691 indicate a population of 1,234,575.

In the Middle Ages Scotland had much more limited organisation for poor relief than England, lacking the religious [[confraternity|confraternities]] of the major English cities. It possessed a few hospitals, [[Bede House|bede houses]] and [[Leprosy|leper houses]], which offered confinement rather than treatment.&lt;ref name=Grell&amp;Cunninghamp1997p223&gt;O. P. Grell and A.

The government reacted with three major pieces of legislation on poverty and vagrancy in 1574, 1579 and 1592. The kirk became a major element of the system of poor relief, and [[justices of the peace]] were given responsibility for dealing with the issue. The 1574 poor law act was modelled on the [[Tudor Poor Laws|English act]] passed two years earlier; it limited relief to the deserving poor of the old, sick and infirm, imposing draconian punishments on a long list of "masterful beggars", including jugglers, [[palmistry|palmisters]] and unlicensed tutors. Parish deacons, elders or other overseers,&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp166-8" /&gt; and in the burghs [[bailie]]s and [[Provost (civil)|provost]]s,&lt;ref name=Grell&amp;Cunninghamp1997p221&gt;O. P.

Those not belonging to the parish were to be sent back to their place of birth and might be put in the stocks or otherwise punished, probably actually increasing the level of vagrancy. Unlike the English act, there was no attempt to provide work for the able-bodied poor.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp166-8"/&gt; In practice, the strictures on begging were often disregarded in times of extreme hardship.&lt;ref&gt;R.

It was then gradually introduced in other cities, such as St Andrews in 1597, Perth in 1599, Aberdeen in 1619, and Glasgow and Dundee in 1636.&lt;ref name=Grell&amp;Cunninghamp1997p37&gt;O. P.

This legislation provided the basis of what would later be known as the "Old Poor Law" in Scotland, which remained in place until the mid-nineteenth century, when, faced with the much greater problems of poverty caused by industrialisation and population growth, a more comprehensive system, known as the [[New Poor Law]], was created.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mitchison, ''The Old Poor Law in Scotland: the Experience of Poverty, 1574–1845'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2000), {{ISBN|0748613447}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most subsequent legislation built on its principles of provision for the local deserving poor and punishment of mobile and undeserving "sturdie beggars". The most important later act was that of 1649, which declared that local heritors were to be assessed by kirk session to provide the financial resources for local relief, rather than relying on voluntary contributions.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), {{ISBN|0415278805}}, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-seventeenth century the system had largely been rolled out across the Lowlands, but was limited in the Highlands.&lt;ref name=Grell&amp;Cunninghamp1997p37/&gt; The system was largely able to cope with general poverty and minor crises, helping the old and infirm to survive and provide life support in periods of downturn at relatively low cost, but was overwhelmed in the major subsistence crisis of the 1690s.&lt;ref&gt;R.

Early modern Scotland was a theoretically [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] society, in which men had total authority over women, but how this worked is practice is difficult to discern.&lt;ref name="Dawson2007pp62-3"/&gt; Marriages, particularly higher in society, were often political in nature and the subject of complex negotiations over the tocher ([[dowry]]). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating and finding marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s, or as [[matchmakers]], finding suitable and compatible partners. Before the Reformation, the extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most marriages necessitated a [[papal dispensation]], which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient.&lt;ref name="Dawson2007pp62-3"/&gt; At the beginning of the period, women had a very limited legal status. The criminal courts refused to recognise them as witnesses or independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. In the post-Reformation period there was a criminalisation of women, partly evident in witchcraft prosecutions from 1563.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983pp86-8/&gt; Through the 1640s, independent commissions were set up to try women for child murder, and after pressure from the kirk a law of 1690 placed the presumption of guilt on a woman if she concealed a pregnancy and birth, and her child later died.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983pp86-8/&gt;

By the eighteenth century many poorer girls were being taught in [[dame schools]], informally set up by a widow or spinster to teach reading, sewing and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;B.

Many unmarried women worked away from their families as farm servants, and married women worked with their husbands around the farm, taking part in all major agricultural tasks. They had a particular role as shearers in the harvest, forming most of the reaping team of the ''[[bandwin]]''. Women also played an important part in the expanding textile industries, spinning and setting up [[warp (weaving)|warp]]s for men to weave. There is evidence of single women engaging in independent economic activity, particularly for widows, who can be found keeping schools, brewing ale and trading.&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983pp86-8&gt;R.

Henderson, ''Religious Life in Seventeenth-Century Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0521248779}}, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The seventeenth century marked the high-water mark of kirk discipline. Kirk sessions were able to apply religious sanctions, such as excommunication and denial of baptism, to enforce godly behaviour and obedience. In more difficult cases of immoral behaviour they could work with the local magistrate, in a system modelled on that employed in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Houston, I. D. Whyte "Introduction" in R. A.

Never adopted by the kirk, they nevertheless remained popular and were reprinted from the 1540s to the 1620s. Later the Calvinism that came to dominate was much more hostile to Catholic musical tradition and popular music, placing an emphasis on the [[Psalms]]. The [[Scottish Psalter]] of 1564 was commissioned by the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Assembly of the Church]]. Whole congregations would now all sing these psalms, often using common tunes, unlike the trained choirs who had sung the many parts of polyphonic hymns.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp187-90&gt;J.

From late Medieval Scotland there is evidence of occasional prosecutions of individuals for causing harm through witchcraft, but these may have been declining in the first half of the sixteenth century. In the aftermath of the initial Reformation settlement, Parliament passed the [[Witchcraft Act 1563]], similar to that passed in England one year earlier, which made witchcraft a capital crime. Despite the fact that Scotland probably had about one quarter of the population of England, it had three times the number of witchcraft prosecutions, at about 6,000 for the entire period.&lt;ref&gt;K.

Several people, most notably [[Agnes Sampson]], were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James' ship. James became obsessed with the threat posed by witches and, inspired by his personal involvement, in 1597 wrote the ''[[Daemonologie]]'', a tract that opposed the practice of witchcraft and which provided background material for Shakespeare's ''[[MacBeth|Tragedy of Macbeth]]''.&lt;ref name=Keay&amp;Keay1994p556&gt;J.

Keay, ''Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland'' (London: Harper Collins, 1994), {{ISBN|0-00-255082-2}}, p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt; James is known to have personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches.&lt;ref name=Keay&amp;Keay1994p556/&gt; After 1599, his views became more sceptical.&lt;ref&gt;P. Croft, ''King James'' (Basingstoke and New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003), {{ISBN|0-333-61395-3}}, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventeenth century the pursuit of witchcraft was largely taken over by the kirk sessions, and was often used to attack superstitious and Catholic practices in Scottish society. Most of the accused, 75 per cent, were women, with over 1,500 executed, and the witch hunt in Scotland has been seen as a means of controlling women.&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Brown, "Religion and society to c. 1900", T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0199563691}}, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The most intense [[The Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1661–1662|witch hunt]] was in 1661–62, which involved 664 named witches in four counties.&lt;ref&gt;B. P. Levak, "The decline and end of Scottish witch-hunting", in J. Goodare, ed., ''The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0719060249}}, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; From this point prosecutions began to decline, as trials were more tightly controlled by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. There may also have been a growing scepticism, and with relative peace and stability the economic and social tensions that contributed to accusation may have reduced. There were occasional local outbreaks such as the one in East Lothian in 1678 and Paisley in 1697. The last recorded executions were in 1706, and the last trial was in 1727. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Witchcraft Act in 1736.&lt;ref&gt;B. P. Levak, "The decline and end of Scottish witch-hunting", in J.

She told DiManno she and her family lived for 18 years in the [[United States]].
The Contender Biography published by ''[[Pajhwok Afghan News]]'' has her living in the United States from 1990 to1 1994, and living in Pakistan for the remainder of the period 1986 to 2001, where she administered relief to other Afghan expatriates.
 
David Williams, writing in the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', in 2005, when she first ran for Afghanistan's National Assembly, said her husband had been killed in factional fighting.
Rosie DiManno, writing in the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' during her presidential campaign, wrote that Ata was the target of a smear campaign alleging the murder of her husband as well as one of her daughters. Ata pointed out to Dimanno that all five of her daughters were still alive. According to DiManno, Ata's husband died in the US in 1992 of natural causes. Dismissing the murder claims, Ata declared: "So, I'm alleged to have killed my husband and my daughter, then I ran back to Afghanistan to avoid American justice? This is what they write in the newspapers. I wish we had a functioning court system so I could sue."
All five of Ata's daughters live currently in the United States.

==Family and career==
A descendant of the Afghan Royal Family she's related to the former [[President of Afghanistan]], [[Sardar Mohammad Daoud Khan]], himself, a cousin of [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]], Afghanistan's last Monarch.
Ata is a widow&lt;ref name=SydneyMorningHerald-2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=TorontoStar2009-08-15/&gt; and she has five daughters living in the United States.

Ata was a Registered Nurse and a trained psychologist,&lt;ref name=TorontoStar2009-08-15/&gt; before becoming a [[Politician]].

Elected to the upper house of the Afghan National Legislature [[Wolesi Jirga]] in 2005, she represented [[Kabul]]&lt;ref name=OfficialBiographyShahlaAtta/&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost2Women/&gt;
and served on the Jirga's [[commission for counter-narcotics]] and its monitoring commission.

Shahla Ata and [[Frozan Fana]] were the only two women candidates in the [[Afghan presidential election, 2009]].&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost2Women/&gt;
Ballot results placed her in the fourteenth place in [[List of candidates in the Afghan presidential election, 2009|a field of thirty-two]] with 11412 votes.

During the presidential campaign she has said that if elected, she will carry the policies of President Mohammed Daoud Khan in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost2Women/&gt;

==Death==
On March 12, 2015, Ata's lifeless body was discovered in her house and an investigation has been opened by Kabul Police Department's Criminal branch.

'''Site and services''' is an approach to bringing shelter within the economic reach of the poor.

==History==
Recognizing that the vast majority of low income families in the world build their own shelter, which lacks basic [[hygiene]], access and electricity, the strategy was developed. The approach first appeared on a large scale in [[Madras]] (now [[Chennai]]) in 1972 when the [[World Bank]] engaged [[Christopher Charles Benninger]] to advise the Madras Metropolitan Development Authority (MMDA) on their housing sector investments. The approach links the user group's ability to pay with land prices and the costs of rudimentary and upgradable [[infrastructure]]. The fundamental idea is to market plots with essential infrastructure at market prices, to avoid the resale of [[subsidized housing]], directed at low-income groups. The first major scheme planned by Benninger, at Arambakkum in Chennai, created about 7,000 shelter units, within the paying capacity of the urban poor.  Within five years the MMDA created more than 20,000 units and the approach became a major strategy of the World Bank to tackle a variety of shelter problems globally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5329">The {{Nihongo|'''Sugamo child-abandonment incident'''|巣鴨子供置き去り事件|Sugamo kodomo okizari jiken}} was an incident that took place in Japan in 1988 in Tokyo's [[Toshima, Tokyo (ward)|Toshima Ward]]. Covered extensively by both Japanese and international media, it was also the basis of the 2004 fictional feature film ''[[Nobody Knows (2004 film)|Nobody Knows]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Susan|title=Hidden neglect brought to light|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/09/entertainment/et-nobody9|accessdate=22 January 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=9 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The incident involved a mother who abandoned her five [[minor (law)|underage]] children whose names were never released, but referred to simply as Children A, B, C, D, and E.

==Background==
Child A, a boy, was born in 1973; Child B in 1981. Child C died soon after birth in 1984. Children D and E were born in 1985 and 1986 respectively. All of the children had different fathers. Although it is unclear, it appears that besides Child A, several (perhaps all) of the other children were unregistered. None of the children attended school. In Autumn 1987, having met a new boyfriend, the mother placed Child A in charge of the others, leaving him with ¥50,000 (around US$350 at the time) for their living expenses in their Tokyo apartment.

==Discovery==
In April 1988, the youngest, Child E, was assaulted by friends of Child A (known only as Friend A and Friend B), and died as a result. On July 17 of the same year, acting on a tip from the landlord, [[Sugamo]] officials entered the apartment and discovered the severely [[malnourishment|malnourished]] Child A (then 14), Child B (seven), and Child D (three). They also found the body of Child C, but not Child E.  The information given by the children was vague. It was determined that the malnourishment was caused in part by the children's diet, which consisted largely of food bought at [[convenience store]]s.

As a result of news coverage of the incident, the mother turned herself in on July 23. Her testimony revealed that the children had been alone for about nine months and that the whereabouts of Child E were unknown. On July 25, Child A's testimony revealed that Child E had been killed by Friend B of Child A, and that her body had been buried in a wood in [[Chichibu]] by Child A and Friend A. Friend A and Friend B were sent to a reform school for their involvement in the death.  

In August 1988, the mother was indicted for [[child abandonment]]. She received a three-year sentence, [[suspended sentence|suspended]] for four years. Although Child A was probably not present at the time of his sister's death, he did assist Friend A in burying the body; he was indicted for abandoning a body, but in consideration of the circumstances was remanded to a care facility. After the mother's three-year sentence, she regained custody of the two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=?|first=?|title=Just viewed "Nobody Knows," a true story of four Japanese children abandoned by their young mother, and raised by their oldest brother.  Very tragic story, which was hard to believe would happen in Japan.  Whatever happened to them?|url=http://www.chicago.us.emb-japan.go.jp/JIC/Weblettr/archfeat.html|accessdate=20 October 2016|newspaper=Consulate General of Japan at Chicago - Webletter Archived Features|date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film version==
The 2004 film ''[[Nobody Knows (2004 film)|Nobody Knows]]'', directed by [[Hirokazu Koreeda]], presents a fictionalized and generally less grim account of the incident. There is no mention of Child C, whose body the mother kept in the family apartment following the child's death. Similarly, rather than being killed by Child A's friends, Child E in the film dies after an accidental fall. The police do not become involved, and the film ends with the three surviving children, aided by a female friend of Child A, continuing their impoverished, unsupervised life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2276">The '''TRECVID''' evaluation meetings are an ongoing series of [[workshop]]s focusing on a list of different [[information retrieval]] (IR) research areas in content-based retrieval and exploitation of digital video. TRECVID is co-sponsored by the [[NIST|National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]] and other US government agencies. Various participating research groups make significant contributions. The goal of the workshops is to encourage research in content-based video retrieval and analysis by providing large test collections, realistic system tasks, uniform scoring procedures, and a forum for organizations interested in comparing their results.

== Origin ==

TRECVID was founded in [https://web.archive.org/web/20030204001500/http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/projects/trecvid/ 2003] as an independent evaluation/workshop from [[Text Retrieval Conference|TREC]].

TERAJU operates in collaboration with the '''Bumiputera Economic Empowerment Unit (UPEB)''' that resides in 24 ministries and the [[Prime Minister's Department (Malaysia)|Prime Ministers Department]]. UPEB comes under the purview of the Bumiputera Economic Council or ''Majlis Ekonomi Bumiputera (MEB)'' led by the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Initiatives are carried out alongside with government agencies at various levels, economic corridors, GLCs/GLICs, and the private sector.

TERAJU is mandated to pursue five key thrusts under Malaysia’s '''Bumiputera Economic Transformation Roadmap (BETR) 2.0''' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z7YKYeNzYiazVfDJJM-lkyqO-DkcdOuX/view?usp=sharing|title=Malaysian Digest|last=|first=|date=|work=Najib Unveils Bumiputera Economic Transformation Roadmap 2.0, A New Look In Empowering Bumiputera Agenda|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include strengthening human capital, promoting higher value employment and income, increasing Bumiputera share and value of corporate equity, strengthening entrepreneurship, and increasing ownership of non-financial assets.

The first World Congress on Communication for Development ('''WCCD''') was held in Rome, Italy from October 25 to 27, 2006.

== Main objective==

The '''''First World Congress on Communication for Development''''' was hosted by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and organized by [[The World Bank]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], and The Communication Initiative. It intended to clearly demonstrate to policy and decision-makers the effectiveness of "[[Communication for Development]]" in helping meet today's most pressing development challenges and to advocate among them for the systematic inclusion of communication in development policy and practice.

[[Communication for Development]] — as a process of dialogue, information sharing and building mutual understanding — is a powerful tool to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of development interventions, to assess and mitigate the political and social risks of those interventions and to build social ownership and sustainability.

== Participants==

The '''WCCD''', the first event of its kind, brought together more than 500 policymakers, development practitioners, NGO and CSO representatives, and academics/researchers active in the field. Thousands more from around the world were able to participate via webcasting and broadcasting.

== Organization and structure==

FAO and the World Bank spearheaded this event, and involved more than 75 key institutions, including multilateral and bilateral partners, media institutions, academic and research institutions, and NGOs to help organize the Congress. The three party governance structure consisted of a steering committee (to provide overall advice and guidance to the planning), a Scientific Committee (to conduct the paper review and the Mainstreaming study) and an Advisory Body.

== Invitees profile==

Nobel Prize Keynote Speakers, Highest Level of Representation from the UN and The World Bank, Italian Authorities, High Profile Public Figures, Ministries and Authorities from Developing Countries, Prime International University Representatives and Academicians.

== Themes and structure==

The Congress was structured around four broad thematic areas: Health, Governance, Sustainable Development, and Communication Labs. During the Policymakers Forum leading policy and decision-makers discussed and debated the opportunities and constraints they envisaged vis-à-vis the proposed recommendations for mainstreaming communication in development policies and programs.

A Mainstreaming and Policy Recommendations Study commissioned by the Scientific Committee served as the basis of discussions at the Policymakers' Forum, integrated the outcomes of the Forum and was then published, together with the proceedings of sessions and papers.

== Media partners==

Media Partners included [[Inter Press Service]]-IPS, [[RAI]] (Italy), [[BBC]] (UK) and CNBC (Germany). Additional media outlets were [[Al-Jazeera]] (Qatar), [[Reuters]], CNN Español, and major Latin-American media; Rome-based correspondents of the international press, together with major Italian newspapers covered the event. The BBC broadcast from the Congress site its flagship program, World Debate, while CNBC broadcast the show, Global Players.

== Expectations==

This event generated an enormous amount of interest around the world with more than 600 papers submitted through the call for papers, more than 1,700 registered through the Congress website, more than 600,000 hits on the site, and more than 2,000 people participated in pre-Congress e-discussions on Congress-related topics and themes.

One of the most extensive efforts previous to the Congress was the latinamerican seminar "Sin comunicación no hay desarrollo" (Without Communication No Development), held on August, 2006 in the city of Lima (Perú) with participants from Argentina, Bolivia, Brasil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Perú, Uruguay, Venezuela, Germany and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Calandria, 2007 - Source: [http://issuu.com/calandriaperu/docs/calandria-sin-comunicacion-no-hay-d Official Publication from the Seminar "Sin comunicación no hay desarrollo" (Without Communication No Development)]&lt;/ref&gt; It reunited the following Peruvian (PE) and international institutions (I - International / LA - Latinamerican): Asociación de Comunicadores Sociales Calandria (PE), CESIP (PE), CNR (Perú), Colectivo Radial Feminista (PE),  DEMUS (PE), Equipo Uno (PE), Voces Nuestras, PUCP (PE), Red Científica Peruana (PE), ILLA (PE), IEC (PE), MINSA (PE), CONAM (PE), CONCORTV (PE), IDL (PE), IUCM, Mesa de Comunicadores de Agencias de Cooperación, FELAFACS (LA), OCLAC (LA), OPS (LA), ANDI (LA), ALER (LA), AMARC (LA), Observatorio de Imprensa (LA), World Bank (I), AVINA (I), Broederlijk Delen (I), CAMECO (I), Communication for Social Change Consortium (I), FAO (I), Iniciativa de la Comunicación (I), ONU (I), OXFAM (I), UNICEF (I), USAID (I), WACC (I).&lt;ref&gt;Iniciativa de la Comunicación, 2006 - Source: [http://www.comminit.com/node/196198 Resume and list of presentations from the Seminar "Sin comunicación no hay desarrollo" (Without Communication No Development)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ọba kò so''''' (''The King Did Not Hang'') is a play by [[Duro Ladipo]] depicting the mystical and ambivalent personality known as [[Shango]] of [[Yoruba mythology]].

==Background==
Shango is the protagonist of the play. According to some historians, he reigned as the king of [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] and was a figure feared by both his subjects and, across the [[Niger]], by the [[Borgu]] and [[Nupe Kingdom|Nupe]] empires. He was known for his warring and tyrannical tendencies during his life, and was later deified in tribal history and worshiped by some. His era was one of turbulence and also of intrigue. Duro Ladipo was influenced by the writings of [[Samuel Johnson (Nigerian historian)|the Rev. Samuel Johnson]], a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] historian who used a lot of old Oyo sources for his book on the Yorubas. Duro's play created the image of Sango as a tragic hero.

==Plot==
The play tries to revisit history by portraying a stout and commanding Sango at the height of his powers as a king. Ever mindful of the wishes of the people and in his desire to please them, he set two of his most powerful chiefs against each other. The chiefs, Gbonka and Timi, had grown too powerful and were becoming a nuisance to the kingdom. However, the plot ends up dividing his cabinet and many of his advisers, friends and a wife, Princess [[Oya]], leave him.

Shango's friend Mogba, rather than join the traitors, desires to redeem the battered image of the king. Mogba invokes incantations, causing thunder and lightning to damage the homes of Sango's enemies.
