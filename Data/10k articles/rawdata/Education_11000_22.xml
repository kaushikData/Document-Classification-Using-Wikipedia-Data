== History ==

=== Origins and early years ===
[[File:Senat4.jpg|alt=AMEU senate meeting|thumb|270x270px|A meeting of the Alma Mater Europaea senate]]
In 2007 [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts|European Academy of Sciences and Arts Salzburg]] (EASA) established [[Alma Mater Europaea]] as an academic institution that provides an organizational frame and contents for cultural and professional renewal of the Danube region. AMEU - ECM is part of [[Alma Mater Europaea]] as an academic and research institution, a network of over 250 academic teachers and over 40 academic institutions from 12 countries in the Danube region, also connecting 1400 excellent researchers, several [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prize]] recipients.

In 2011, EASA gave an institutional patronage to the European Centre Maribor, including it into the newly established university network Alma Mater Europaea, established particularly for the Danube region. A new project was placed in hands of AMEU - ECM under this patronage; namely organization of the Regional Interactive Educational Network (RIEN).

In 2011 students started studying [[management]] and social [[gerontology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{url|1=http://www.pomurec.com/vsebina/8138/Evropsko_sredisce_Maribor_edino_s_studijem_socialne_gerontologije | 2="Evropsko središče Maribor edino s študijem socialne gerontologije" Pomurec, 9. 2. 2012.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alma Mater Europaea started offering [[environmental studies]] and [[European studies]] in 2012 and [[archival science]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{url|1=http://www.eumb.si/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=102&amp;Itemid=98&amp;lang=sl | 2=Almamater.si: Razvoj Evropskega centra Maribor }} {{Dead link|date=September 2016}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013 the first group of 50 students graduated. The president of the [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]] prof. ddr. [[Felix Unger]] gave the opening speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{url|1=http://www.almamater.si/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=576:sveana-podelitev-diplom-in-estitke-prvim-diplomantom-ecm&amp;catid=3:dogodki-in-obvestila&amp;Itemid=102&amp;lang=en | 2=Graduation ceremony of the Alma Mater Europaea ECM graduates, Maribor, 2013 {{Dead link|date=September 2016}}

== Teaching and learning ==

=== International research and development programs ===
Some of the successful research projects include:
* Slovene Jews in Prekmurje and Štajerska: survival, remembering and revitalization (holder assistant professor Irena Šumi, Ph.D.)
* Suffrage of persons with special needs – Questions on regulation and improvement of implementation methods (holder assistant professor Jurij Toplak, Ph.D.)
* Cross-border innovation network for value analysis for the endorsement of value analysis as an innovative tool for successfulness enhancement of Slovene and Austrian companies

=== Apple 1-1 ===
The iPad one-to-one program uses technology that’s already a big part of students’ lives to make them more excited about learning. Recognizing that students get most of their information from the internet, AMEU wanted to adapt their teaching methods to an increasingly digital world, to help students better prepare for real life. By incorporating digital literacy standards into the curriculum, the goal was to create a teaching environment using the same technology that students were already using outside school. Because it was important to move away from traditional textbooks, AMEU chose the iPad as a learning tool because it gives students access to the world as it is today. Giving students access to iPad also allows teachers to better adapt to their students’ unique needs and abilities. Students are no longer limited to writing essays and answering multiple-choice questions in order to demonstrate what they’ve learned.

=== Athletics ===
AMEU provides students with opportunities to participate in sporting events and has therefore formed several teams to compete in sports. As of now there is a footbal/soccer team, a volleyball team and basketball team all going by the name Team Alma Mater. The teams were formed in the study year 2014/2015 based on the initiative of the students and the student council. In the year 2016/2016 they elected the president of Team Alma Mater. The team competes in tournaments of footsal, volleybal and street basketball. 
Alma Mater Europaea also provides support for professional athletes competing in individual sports such as martial arts. Most of the professional athletes are students at the Physiotherapy program at Alma Mater Europaea.

==Early life and education==
Arthur Larson (he avoided using his first name) was born in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota|Sioux Falls]], [[South Dakota]]. He was the third of five children of Lewis Larson and Anna Huseboe Larson, both of whom were second-generation Americans of [[Norway|Norwegian]] descent. Larson's father was a family court judge in Sioux Falls. Arthur Larson attended the public schools there and the local Lutheran college, [[Augustana College (South Dakota)|Augustana]], and then studied law at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]] (1932–1935) as a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]].  He was married to Florence Newcomb on July 31, 1935.

==Legal, political, and scholarly pursuits==

Larson then worked as a lawyer for four years (1935–1939) with the firm of Quarles, Spence and Quarles in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]].  When [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era conditions led to his layoff in the summer of 1939, Larson found a job as assistant professor of law at the [[University of Tennessee College of Law]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]. While in [[Tennessee]], he and Florence Newcomb Larson had two children.

In 1941, during [[World War II]], Larson moved to [[Washington, DC]], when he mostly worked as a lumber industry regulator at the [[Office of Price Administration]]. In 1945, he became an assistant professor of law at [[Cornell Law School]] in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Over the next seven years, he produced a legal treatise on the ''Law of [[Workmen's Compensation]]'' (Mathew Bender: 1952), which led to his being named in 1953 as dean of the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Law]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].

==Eisenhower administration==
Larson's status as an expert on the [[welfare state]] and his strong public speaking abilities led to appointment as Under Secretary of Labor in March 1954 in the Eisenhower administration. He supported a [[union shop]] to compel workers into a [[labor union]] as "a case of the individual... having to conform to the will of the majority."&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Review]]'', September 8, 1956, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Larson soon became an articulate spokesman for [[Rockefeller Republican|Moderate Republicans]]. He declared himself part of "the American center" to which he also included President Eisenhower; Eisenhower's two-time opponent, [[Adlai Stevenson II]]; and [[Dean Acheson]], a former secretary of state in the [[Harry Truman]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Matthews, "Now They're for Stevenson", ''National Review'', February 8, 1956, pp., 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; Larson's most popular book, ''A Republican Looks at His Party'' (Harper and Row: 1956) was personally endorsed by Eisenhower.

Eisenhower named Larson the director of the United States Information Agency (USIA) in December 1956 and as his top [[speechwriter]] in October 1957.

==Return to academia==
After leaving the Eisenhower administration in the fall of 1958, Larson became a law professor at [[Duke University]] in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], [[North Carolina]], where he specialized in [[international law]], [[arms control]], and [[disarmament]].

==Death==
He died in Durham on March 27, 1993. It is unknown if he was in his later years a registered Republican in North Carolina.

==Legacy==
Larson is criticized as a prototypical big government Republican in [[Barry Goldwater]]'s landmark small government Republican manifesto, ''[[The Conscience of a Conservative]]''. However, his life and work are treated at length in a biography by [[David Stebenne]], ''Modern Republican: Arthur Larson and the Eisenhower Years'' (Indiana University Press, 2006).

It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its "frenetic and visually stylish" action but criticized the thinly-written characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/the-house-with-a-clock-in-its-walls-ticks-along-tolerably/|title=''The House with a Clock in Its Walls'' Ticks Along Tolerably|first=Jeff|last=Giles|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=September 20, 2018|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film opens with a montage of [[trigger warning]]s that show brief scenes depicting topics ranging from [[toxic masculinity]] and [[transphobia]] to fragile male egos and giant frogs.

In Salem, Massachusetts, Lily Colson ([[Odessa Young]]) is a regular high school senior who is best friends with Bex ([[Hari Nef]]), Em ([[Abra (singer)|Abra]]), and Sarah ([[Suki Waterhouse]]). The girls go to a party where Bex hooks up with her crush Diamond ([[Danny Ramirez]]) while Lily goes to be alone with her boyfriend Mark ([[Bill Skarsgård|Bill Skarsgard]]) while texting someone named "Daddy" behind his back. After sex, Diamond leaves Bex and tells her to keep their hookup a secret as she is [[transgender]].

The next day, Marty ([[Noah Galvin|Noah Gavin]]), a casual hacker, receives a message from an unknown hacker about Mayor Bartlett ([[Cullen Moss]]) a known anti-gay candidate, for engaging with male escorts and dressing up in women's clothing. He sends out Bartlett’s information to the entire town afterwards. The scandal becomes so distressing for Bartlett that he goes before a conference of people and kills himself with a revolver. Principal Turrell's ([[Colman Domingo|Colman Domingo]]) phone is the next to be hacked, and non-sexualized naked pictures of his underage daughter are shown, making people think that Turrell is a pedophile. He goes before a conference of people and refuses to resign, despite being advised otherwise.

As the police question Marty over Bartlett and Turrell's hacked information, a massive data dump of half the people in Salem is posted online. Lily's acquaintance Grace ([[Maude Apatow]]) discovers that her best friend Reagan ([[Bella Thorne]]) spread nude pictures of her to a guy she liked, and attacks Reagan with an aluminum bat at cheerleading practice. "Daddy" is revealed to be Em's neighbor Nick Mathers ([[Joel McHale]]), whose kids Lily babysat. Lily's lewd pictures and videos that she sent to Nick are made public when his information is leaked. As a result, she is exposed and humiliated by Mark, kicked out of the house by her parents, and is sexually harassed on the street when she looks for a place to stay. A man in a truck tries to film her, but she smashes his face in with a shovel.

One week later, most of the men in town have donned masks and taken up arms to defend their secrets and get revenge on people they think have wronged them. A masked Nick and other men find Marty, who they torture into admitting that the source of the hacks is Lily's computer on a live video. The men in the video stab Marty to death, and Lily - now staying with Sarah and Em - and her friends see the video. Unbeknownst to the girls, masked assailants have tracked them down and surrounded them at Sarah and Em’s house. The assailants break in and capture Em and Sarah. Nance ([[Anika Noni Rose]]) kills two of the men, but she is shot and killed by another as Em and Sarah are put into a police car. Bex successfully kills one of the attackers with a [[nail gun]] in the pool and escapes while Lily runs to safety at Nick’s house. Nick at first pretends to help her but then pulls out a knife, revealing his intent to rape her; Lily fights him off and slits his throat with a makeshift weapon made of a bar of soap and a razor blade, killing him. She then goes downstairs to discover a large supply of weapons including firearms and a [[katana]], taking as many as she can carry.

Lily confronts the police officer with Em and Sarah in his car, shoots him to death, and frees her friends. They go to find Bex, who is about to be publicly hanged as retribution for Diamond's humiliation over having sex with a transgender woman. Johnny ([[Cody Christian]]) tries to force Diamond to perform the hanging, but Bex convinces him to change his mind. Johnny takes matters into his own hands to carry out the hanging, but Lily, Em, and Sarah arrive just in time to rescue Bex and kill her assailants. Bex lets Johnny live when he surrenders and also sets Diamond free. Lily then makes a video calling out to the other young women in the neighborhood to stand up and fight back against the armed men. Lily and her friends are joined by an army of young women as they come up against an army of masked assailants. At the end of the final battle, Donny (Caden Swain), Lily's younger brother, is captured by the FBI and revealed as the true perpetrator of the hack, facing a life sentence for his actions. When his father asks why he did it, Donny responds, "I don't know, for the lulz?"

The credits roll over the Salem High marching band marching and dancing down a street surrounded by dead bodies and destroyed vehicles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2584">[[Image:Brand Book.png|thumb|right|150px|A Brand Book published by the Oklahoma Cattlemen's Association.]]
A '''Brand Book''' records all [[Livestock branding|livestock brands]] registered with an organization. In the U.S. most states have branding laws that require brands to be registered before use. This may be a state agency (usually affiliated with each state's [[List of agriculture ministries|Department of Agriculture]]) or a private association regulated by the state. Most states with such laws have a Brand Book for the entire state. [[Texas]], an exception, registers brands at the county level. These book are usually provided free to law enforcement personnel and County Extension Agents. Some states have their Brand Books available online.

A typical Brand Book will usually have an image of the brand, the location of the brand on the animal, and the type of animal that will be branded, as well as the owner of the brand. Many Brand Books also record earmarks.

Brand Books are used by law enforcement officials, brand inspectors, and association investigators to record and track livestock movement, deter loss of livestock by straying or theft, and prosecute thieves.

}}
'''Crowell-Collier Publishing Company''' was an American [[Publishing|publisher]] that owned the popular magazines ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'' and ''[[The American Magazine]]''. Crowell also published general interest books and references such as ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'' and the [[Harvard Classics]] series of books. 

The company was founded by agricultural [[Tool and die maker|tool manufacturer]] P. P. Mast with a single magazine, ''[[Farm &amp; Fireside]] (''later [[Farm &amp; Fireside|the ''Country Home'']]'')'' to sell farm tools and implements in 1877 in [[Springfield, Ohio]]. By 1881, Mast had relinquished control to John S. Crowell who expanded their company by purchasing ''Home Companion'' (later changing the name to ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'').

After P. P. Mast's death in 1898, Crowell obtained control of the company and established it as the Crowell Publishing Company. Crowell Publishing expanded their magazine holdings with ''[[The American Magazine]]'' in 1911 and the weekly ''[[Collier's]]'' in 1919. At one point Collier's weekly had over 1.25 million subscribers. Crowell's also published the ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'' which came under fire from the FTC in 1940 for deceptive sales practices. 

After shuttering the magazine operations in the 1950s, the Crowell-Collier Publishing Company merged with the American [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Company]] in 1960 and became a large [[Education|educational]] company with subsidiaries for books, textbooks, [[Correspondence school|correspondence schools]] and other educational tools and materials. The company officially changed its name to '''Macmillan, Inc.''' in 1973.

The Crowell-Collier Publishing Company had its roots in the agricultural trade of the 19th century. Industrialist Phineas P. Mast, the owner of P. P. Mast, manufactured farm and agricultural tools, and he wanted a magazine to promote his products.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clarkcountyhistory.wordpress.com/tag/phineas-p-mast/|title=Phineas P.

Crowell along with T.J. Kirkpatrick (who was Mast's nephew) then changed the name of the publishing house to Mast, Crowell and Kirkpatrick Publishers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The publishers soon expanded from the one magazine into other markets. They constructed the Farm and Fireside building in Springfield, Ohio, in 1881.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1883, they purchased the ''[[Woman's Home Companion|Home Companion]]'' magazine from a Harvey &amp; Finn of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] to meet the growing demand for content aimed at women.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of American Magazines, Vol IV|last=Mott|first=Frank Luther|publisher=Harvard Press|year=1957|isbn=978-0674395503|location=|pages=769–772}}&lt;/ref&gt; They bought ''Youth's Home Library'', a similar paper that had been published in [[Boston]], and merged it with their youth-oriented publication ''Our Young People''. They then changed the name of the three merged periodicals back to the title ''Home Companion'', a general family magazine. By 1890 the magazine's subscription had reached 100,000.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; The ''Companion'' had a number of names but was changed to ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'' in 1896. By the 1890s, ''Farm &amp; Fireside'' was also publishing regional editions of the periodical.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; After the death of P. P.

As the [[20th century]] began, the company changed hands again and moved into mainstream magazine publishing. P. P.

=== 1910s and Acquisition of Major Periodicals ===
{{see also|Collier's}}
Crowell Publishing acquired ''[[The American Magazine]]'' in 1911 from the Phillips Publishing Company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1911/02/02/archives/elevated-agents-robbed-lone-highwayman-holds-up-two-station-gets.html|title=ELEVATED AGENTS ROBBED.; Lone Highwayman Holds Up Two Station -- Gets All Receipts In one.|date=1911-02-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine had [[Muckraker|muckraking]] roots but with the decline of muckraking journalism it had turned into a general interest magazine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, an article in [[the New York Times]] noted that "the purchase of ''the American Magazine'' by Crowell Publishing Company meant that 'the interests' were bent on swallowing up the muckrakers..."&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1911/02/05/archives/partner-of-morgan-in-magazine-firm-thomas-w-lamont-one-of-the-new.html|title=PARTNER OF MORGAN IN MAGAZINE FIRM; Thomas W.

Lamont]] who was also a partner of the newly formed [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.|J. P. Morgan &amp; Company]].  [[Cleveland Moffett]], a known muckraking journalist was quoted, "...we are up against the powers of darkness. The right of free speech in America is in jeopardy. They are trying to muzzle the magazines. Several magazines have changed hands recently.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; They have come under the control of interests, and in each of them the muckraking features will cease. Muckraking, in spite of its name, is a power in this country, standing as it does to promote good citizenship."&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; However, a second ''New York Times'' article about the acquisition stated that writers such as [[Ida Tarbell]], Peter F. Dunne, and [[William Allen White]] were pleased with the opportunity.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; A spokesman from Phillips said that "...instead of reaching 300,000 readers, we can now reach 3,000,000 readers through our new allies in the publication field. We ourselves were afraid the Trusts were behind the proposition before we looked into it, but all the magazines we affiliate with are insurgent like ourselves, and controlled by persons of insurgent sympathies."&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

That same year, several magazine publishers including Crowell were accused of conspiring to keep up magazine prices through the Periodical Clearing House. According to John Wood, a magazine man whose business had been severely impacted, the Periodical Clearing House was organized by law clerks and employees of the magazines.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1911/06/25/archives/accuses-magazines-of-trade-restraint-club-rate-agent-says-the.html|title=ACCUSES MAGAZINES OF TRADE RESTRAINT; Club Rate Agent Says the Leading Publishers Are in a Conspiracy to Keep Up Prices.|date=1911-06-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood claimed that ruinous fines had impacted his ability to sell subscriptions. At the same time libraries in the Central Western and Western states complained that the clearing house caused the cessation of club rates on magazines to libraries.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In 1919, the Crowell Publishing Company bought another general interest magazine, ''[[Collier's]]: The National Weekly'', and assumed control of Collier's book publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/07/26/issue.html|title=The New York Times: Saturday July 26, 1919|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Collier's'' also had roots in muckraking journalism and social reform and had one of the largest magazine subscription audiences, then around one million weekly.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The book-publishing arm published popular and serious literature topics as well as the ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'' and published six million copies a year of books.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;{{multiple image

=== 1920s ===
By 1924, the weekly circulation of ''Collier's'' had grown to 1,250,000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Crowell moved its print operations to Springfield, Ohio, because of "excessive postage involved in mailing from a seaboard city under wartime postal rates".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1924/05/27/119039162.html?pageNumber=5|title=COLLIER'S PLANT TO MOVE TO OHIO; Publication Follows Others That Have Left New York Because of Union Conditions.

=== 1930s ===
In 1930 ''Farm &amp; Fireside'' magazine changed its name to ''The Country Home''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also in 1930, the Crowell Publishing Company and P. F. Collier and Sons were sued for libel by R.B. Creager, a Republican National Committeeman for Texas. Creager sought $500,000 in damages after an article titled "High-Handed and Hell-Bent" appeared in ''Collier's Weekly''. The article by Owen P. White covered a political situation on the Mexican border in Hidalgo County. The jury returned a verdict for Crowell Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1930/05/16/96123460.html?pageNumber=22|title=CREAGER LOSES SUIT AGAINST COLLIER'S; Republican Leader in Texas Sought $500,000 Damages for Story in Magazine.|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Crowell Publishing merged the New York operations and changed the company name to The Crowell-Collier Publishing Co.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1939/06/02/93923277.html?pageNumber=38|title=Advertising News and Notes; Newspaper Campaigns Listed|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, ''The Country Home'' was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1939/10/25/94729787.html?pageNumber=29|title=Magazine Will Suspend|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1939/10/25/94729996.html?pageNumber=39|title=Advertising News and Notes; Drake's Cake in Newspapers|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1940s ===
In 1940 the [[FTC Fair Information Practice|FTC]] investigated the sales methods used for the ''Collier's Encyclopedia''. The publishing company and its officers and directors of the corporations were charged with misleading sale methods and representations in the sale of books and encyclopedias. The complaint charged that "contrary to claims made, none of the respondents' publications is ever given as the result of a drawing or free, and as a gift or gratuity; that the purchase price of so-called free goods is, in every instance, included in the price of other merchandise sold to the customer; that in no case do they sell at actual cost, that the sum of $59 represented as a reduced price is the regular price, and that other claims are 'also deceptive and misleading.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/11/12/94012745.html?pageNumber=40|title=CROWELL CITED BY FTC; Complaint Charges Book Sales Methods Were Misleading|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During [[World War II]], Crowell-Collier sponsored publication of a magazine for servicemen called ''Victory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1943/02/19/85084679.html?pageNumber=38|title=COPIES OF 'VICTORY' SENT TO SOLDIERS; OWI Office Letter Obtained by Senators Gives Details of Budget and Plans ADVERTISING EXPLAINED Success of 'Signal,' German Propaganda Organ, Caused Agency's Counter-Attack|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, the Vanderbilt mansion at Fifth Avenue and Fifty-First Street was slated to be razed and replaced with a 19-story office building for the Crowell-Collier Publishing Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1946/12/01/88384960.html?pageNumber=206|title=Passing of the Marble Front|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== 1950s financial reverses ===

[[File:Crowell-Collier-Springfield-OH.jpg|thumb|Crowell-Collier building in Springfield, Ohio (2011)]]

In the mid-1950s, Crowell-Collier had heavy deficits and discontinued ''The American Magazine'', ''Collier's'', and ''Woman's Home Companion''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In December 1956 the company closed its Springfield plant, which at one point had employed more than 2,000 people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The closing shocked both publishers and readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1962/06/17/issue.html|title=The New York Times: Sunday June 17, 1962|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many in the magazine field deemed the closing "a foolish and impetuous move",&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1962/06/17/89862835.html?pageNumber=120|title=Advertising: Books and Magazines Merging; Publishing Trend Is Shown by Recent Developments.

=== 1960s and reinvention as educational publisher ===
By the early 1960s, Crowell-Collier had recovered financially. Leaving behind its roots in magazine publishing, it now turned to the growing market for education produced by the [[baby boom]] in the United States. Book sales had surged for [[Reference work|reference books]], [[Textbook|textbooks]], and [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedias]] and like many of the large publishers of that era such as [[Random House]] and [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], Crowell-Collier embarked on a [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger and acquisitions]] spree.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Crowell-Collier kicked off the decade by merging with the American [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]] company and moved into the educational space. This was then followed by a number of mergers and acquisitions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1961/12/20/issue.html|title=The New York Times: Wednesday December 20, 1961|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the move into education, Chairman Raymond C. Hagel said,  "We envision our major role as that of a developer of complete educational systems." He explained that an educational system was a "unified instructional package involving a variety of tools." and that "the business of education has become a successor to the defense industry. It is a security lifeline."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1965/05/16/104229994.html?pageNumber=187|title=Personality: Diversifier in Publishing Field; Crowell Collier Head Sets a 'Pattern for Future'|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowell would end the decade as Crowell Collier &amp; Macmillan, a large conglomeration of subsidiaries that included books, schools, magazines, educational tools, bookstores, [[Book sales club|book club]]s and radio stations and with an annual revenue of $390 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1970/02/11/76699111.html?pageNumber=90|title=Goodyear Rubber and R.J.

=== Merger with Macmillan ===
{{see also|Macmillan Publishers (United States)}}
In December 1959, Crowell-Collier acquired 29 percent of [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillian Company]]&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1960/04/17/99732332.html?pageNumber=76|title=RECENT MERGERS ALTER BOOK FIELD; Holt and 2 Other Concerns Exchanging Stock -- Text House Also in Deal|date=April 17, 1960|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT August 4 1960"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1960/08/04/99508342.html?pageNumber=35|title=CROWELL-COLLIER |date=August 4, 1960|website=[The New York Times|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which published [[fiction]], [[non-fiction]], [[textbook]]s, [[Reference work|reference books]], religious books and [[children's books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1960/12/16/99979696.html?pageNumber=53|title=MERGER IS VOTED FOR PUBLISHERS; Stockholders of Macmillan and Crowell-Collier Back Exchange of Shares|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August 1960, Crowell-Collier held a 52.8 percent interest in Macmillan,&lt;ref name="NYT August 4 1960"/&gt; and on December 30, 1960, the companies merged.&lt;ref name="NYPL Overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.nypl.org/mss/703#overview|title=Crowell-Collier Publishing Company records 1931–1955|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[New York Public Library]]|access-date=2017-07-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822153253/http://archives.nypl.org/mss/703#overview|archivedate=2016-08-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macmillan was once the American division of the [[Macmillan Publishers|British Macmillan]] Publishers (opened in 1869)  and had been run by generations of the Brett family who eventually bought the company from the British in 1896. Macmillan published some notable authors including [[Jack London]], [[Margaret Mitchell]], and [[Winston Churchill]]. 

At the time, the majority of Macmillan's sales came from textbooks&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1960/07/31/99767673.html?pageNumber=114|title=Publishers of Books Are Turning to Mergers; Some Stocks Listed and Advertising Drives Pushed BOOK PUBLISHING IS TURNING A LEAF|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesmachine.nytimes.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1960/12/16/99979696.html?pageNumber=53|title=MERGER IS VOTED FOR PUBLISHERS; Stockholders of Macmillan and Crowell-Collier Back Exchange of Shares|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/03/04/77078525.html?pageNumber=28|title=Book Trade Upset by Changes in Ownership, Size and Staff|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for Macmillan the merger meant access to cash and capital to grow their textbook market.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Crowell-Collier ran Macmillan as a subsidiary but in 1965 Crowell-Collier officially changed its name to Crowell Collier &amp; Macmillan, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1965/05/05/101544765.html?pageNumber=64|title=Advertising: New Name and Emblem at Cities Service|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishing was dropped from the company name to reflect its broadened scope into education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1965/05/05/issue.html|title=The New York Times: Wednesday May 5, 1965|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Encyclopedias, books and educational materials ===
Textbooks and encyclopedias were a booming business in 1959. While general books accounted for $408 million in sales, textbooks and encyclopedias totaled $597 million.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Crowell's subsidiary P. F. Collier and Sons published the ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'' and released a new 24-volume set in 1962.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1962/04/24/82124946.html?pageNumber=49|title=CROWELL-COLLIER MAPS ACQUISITION; Purchase of an Educational Magazine Is Slated|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1909 it also published the 51-volume [[Harvard Classics]], an anthology of classic and world literature.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The company expanded the line of encyclopedias by announcing that it would use the resources of Crowell-Collier, Macmillian and Free Press to begin work on a new multi-volume set on [[social science]]s.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1960/12/16/99979448.html?pageNumber=30|title=ENCYCLOPEDIA SET ON SOCIAL SCIENCE; 3 Publishers Join in Venture Called First of Its Kind in More Than 25 Years|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; W. Allen Wallis, named chairman of the editorial board for the encyclopedia said, "In the past few years we have stressed the physical sciences because of our concern for defense, and the biological sciences because of our interest in better health. Perhaps of even greater importance to the continued survival of our country and, therefore, the whole free world, will be our ability to solve some of the great social problems of the day."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

[[File:UBN Collier's Encyclopedia.JPG|thumb|UBN Collier's Encyclopedia]]
The [[Federal Trade Commission]] again cited Crowell-Collier and subsidiary P. F. Collier and Sons with making false claims through the door-to-door salesmen of the encyclopedias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1960/02/01/99340169.html?pageNumber=38|title=F.T.C.

The agency charged the company with "Implying through promotional literature and door-to-door salesmen that a set of the encyclopedias would be given free or at a reduced price if yearly supplements were purchased."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/02/27/77445371.html?pageNumber=19|title=F.T.C.

In 1960, Crowell began to expand further into general book markets. Collier Books, the paperback division of Crowell-Collier Publishing Company, began publishing in October 1961 at the rate of 50 paperback titles a month.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1962/07/24/80419714.html?pageNumber=18|title=Crowell-Collier to Publish 24 Books in New Series|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1961/06/21/101467452.html?pageNumber=54|title=Crowell-Collier Plans Paper Back Editions|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list included scholarly books, nonfiction and fiction reprints and original works.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1961/07/02/issue.html|title=The New York Times: Sunday July 2, 1961|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowell-Collier Press was a hardcover publisher started in 1962 with a focus on adult nonfiction and children's books.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The children's series, the Modern Masters Books for Children, was edited by anthologist [[Louis Untermeyer]] and included picture books by [[Robert Graves]] (''The Big Green Book''), [[Shirley Jackson]] (''9 Magic Wishes'') and [[Phyllis McGinley]] (''The B Book'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1962/11/11/109373872.html?pageNumber=366|title=Beginners: Easy Reading|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The books were created using a controlled vocabulary of fewer than 800 words created by elementary educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1962/10/31/90577328.html?pageNumber=58|title=Series of Books Uses 800 Words For a Beginner|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Crowell also purchased book club distributor Scientific Materials, Inc., which included Library of Science, Science Book Club, Natural History Book Club, and Basic Book Service. In addition to the four professional level book clubs, two others aimed at young adults including the Young Adults' Division and Junior Scientists Division of the Library of Science were also a part of the acquisition.

In 1962, Crowell made another push into the book market with a purchase of book clubs and retail bookstores. In the same year, they purchased 16 [[Brentano's]] bookstores.

=== Home study and vocational training ===

[[File:La Salle Extension University Alumni Pin.png|thumb|left|upright|La Salle Extension University Alumni Pin]]
[[Vocational education|Vocational training]] became big business in the 1960s as companies attempted fill a void between a [[High school diplomas|high school diploma]] and [[Academic degree|college degrees]] and Crowell-Collier made significant acquisitions expanding into this market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/12/07/issue.html|title=The New York Times: Sunday December 7, 1969|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, Crowell purchased the [[La Salle Extension University]]—a correspondence school.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 1965 Crowell Collier &amp; Macmillan, Inc. purchased [[Berlitz Corporation|Berlitz Schools]] of Languages of America, Inc.and Berlitz Publications for $5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1965/12/16/95920643.html?pageNumber=75|title=Bid Set for Berlitz By Crowell Collier; CROWELL COLLIER BIDS FOR BERLITZ|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1966/02/05/461075662.html?pageNumber=44|title=Atlas Credit Planning Merger With Sunset Petroleum Corp.|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowell purchased [[Gibbs College|Katherine Gibbs School, Inc.]] a secretarial school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/07/30/issue.html|title=The New York Times: Tuesday July 30, 1968|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also attempted to acquire [[Famous Artists School|Famous Artists Schools, Inc]]. a writing and art correspondence school by purchasing 25% of shares which it later sold to institutional investors in 1968.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1965/08/08/98459047.html?pageNumber=125|title=Spotlight; Crowell Collier's Bid for School|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/01/20/79931708.html?pageNumber=40|title=Crowell Collier Receives $19.9-Million for Shares|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Crowell filed a lawsuit against [[National Home Study Council]] of Washington which was a private accrediting agency. The suit said that National Home was a monopoly and had denied re-accreditation to the U.S. School of Music, Inc. and [[La Salle Extension University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/12/16/78548553.html?pageNumber=43|title=Correspondence Schools Sue Accrediting Agency|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1969, Crowell made 22% of its revenue from La Salle Extension University, Berlitz, and Katharine Gibbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/12/07/issue.html|title=The New York Times: Sunday December 7, 1969|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit settled but at the same time, the entire mail-order schooling came under fire from the New York Times for dubious practices including "overblown advertising, fast talking salesmen, questionable instruction and marginal results."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1970/05/31/354979102.html?pageNumber=39|title=Boom in Mail-Order Schooling Marked by Dubious Practices; Mail Order Schooling Beset by Problems|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to magazines ===
In 1968 the company merged with '''Publication Corporation''', a leading printer of Sunday magazines for newspapers and the publisher of ''[[This Week (magazine)|This Week magazine]]''. The companies had a shared history—[[Joseph P. Knapp]], who had helped develop the Crowell Publishing Company, had founded Publication Corporation as '''American Lithograph Company''' in 1891. The Publication had also been a principal stockholder of Crowell-Collier—owning 24% at one point.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/01/10/88920146.html?pageNumber=41|title=CROWELL COLLIER PLANNING MERGER; Offers $33-Million Stock to Publication Corp., Printers|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal for the merger was to distribute periodicals efficiently in the education market.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; By 1969, Crowell made the decision to shut down the ''This Week'' magazine which had a circulation of 9 million as a weekend supplement for papers such as ''[[The Providence Journal]]'' and ''[[the Kansas City Star]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/08/14/78391331.html?pageNumber=27|title=This Week Magazine Ends Publication Nov. 2; 39 Subscribers Given Option to Continue Section on Own But 15 Newspapers Cancel Contracts for Supplement|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 Crowell Collier &amp; Macmillan went back to publishing magazines but with a focus on education.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/04/15/90092742.html?pageNumber=70|title=Advertising: 6 Crowell Collier Specialties|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They acquired six magazines including ''Grade Teacher'', ''the Catholic School Journal'', ''Industrial Arts'' and ''Vocational Education'', ''College Management'', ''School Management'' and ''Business Management''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These magazines made up a subsidiary CCM magazines based in Greenwich, Conn.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Crowell-Collier Broadcasting operated radio stations in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Minneapolis.&lt;ref name="timesmachine.nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/12/12/crowellcollier-elects-a-new-vice-president.html|title=Crowell-Collier Elects A New Vice President|date=1964-12-12|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 Crowell-Collier purchased the [[Gump's]] store in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/01/11/88979590.html?pageNumber=44|title=CROWELL COLLIER SET TO BUY GUMP'S|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowell-Collier purchased [[C.G. Conn]] a manufacturer of musical instruments in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/10/16/88969885.html?pageNumber=64|title=Garden Seeks Office Building;; Talks With Penn Central|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 the company consolidated 1400 employees into a new building on 866 3rd Avenue called the Crowell Collier &amp; Macmillan building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1966/09/17/121031431.html?pageNumber=23|title=Crowell Collier Moving Into Its New Quarters|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s ===
{{see also|Macmillan Publishers (United States)}}
By the start of the 1970s, Crowell Collier &amp; Macmillan was now a $400 million multinational producer of books and educational materials.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/12/12/80804995.html?pageNumber=69|title=2 Macmillans Agree on Use of Name|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowell Collier &amp; Macmillan decided to change the name of the company to [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan, Inc]]. First, though, they encountered a legal battle over the name with Macmillan, Ltd. of London—who had spun-off from the original American Macmillan in 1896. For the name to take effect on January 1, 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1973/01/03/93251013.html?pageNumber=57|title=Canadian Javelin Chief Bows Out; People and Business|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the companies agreed to some conditions including the American company using Crowell-Collier or another name to distinguish the businesses in which the British Macmillan operated. The British Macmillan stated that the name had already been causing confusion with the public resulting in misdirected book orders and the fear that the American company was planning to use the name to compete unfairly in markets where the British company was active. The case cited the [[Lanham Act]], the trademark act of 1946.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

[[File:Harvard Classics books on a bookshelf.jpg|thumb|Harvard Classics books on a bookshelf]]
This was not the only legal battle that the now Macmillan, Inc. faced at the start of the seventies. Macmillan sued Charles F. Berlitz, grandson of the founder of Berlitz to prohibit him from using the Berlitz name in travel and writing businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1970/01/03/80012303.html?pageNumber=27|title=Berlitz Taking Legalese To Win Use of Name|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlitz won the lawsuit and was awarded $376,000 and the right to use his name as an author of books on foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1973/04/14/79850367.html?pageNumber=36|title=A Berlitz Gets Right To Use His Name On Language Books|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Justice Department filed a civil anti-trust suit against Crowell, Collier &amp; Macmillan, Inc. in 1970 and requested that it divest itself from C.G. Conn, Ltd (a manufacturer and retailer of musical instruments) and Uniforms by Ostwald, Inc. (manufacturer and retailer of band uniforms).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1970/02/05/80019430.html?pageNumber=57|title=CROWELL COLLIER NAMED IN U.S. SUIT; Divestiture of Ostwald and Conn Concerns Is Sought|website=timesmachine.NYTimes.com|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowell-Collier was also under fire by the FTC again in 1972 and accused of using deceptive practices in selling its Harvard Classics and in billing encyclopedia buyers and also in recruiting of encyclopedia salesmen. Of the Harvard Classics, the FTC stated that while the company marketed that one or several volumes were offered free or for $1 each "with the understanding that additional volumes priced at $3.98 would be shipped periodically for free examination", many volumes would be shipped in a bulk shipment. Buyers were subjected to repeated mailings of bills. Crowell responded that they had already discontinued the Harvard Classics "continuity" program and that any "isolated" occurrences or procedures had been changed. For the encyclopedias, Crowell was accused of raising the price on Encyclopedia annual supplements called Yearbooks. They were also accused of advertising positions for encyclopedia salesman as "administrative assistant trainees" and "marketing and public relations personnel". Crowell issued a statement disavowing any violations but agreed to negotiate a consent order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/02/29/93415819.html?pageNumber=8|title=BOOK PUBLISHER ACCUSED BY F.T.C.; Deceptive Practices Alleged in Encyclopedia Sales|website=timesmachine.NYTimes.com|access-date=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has changed its vision statement, removing a phrase that some groups deem to be "too sectarian" for a government institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/08/23/14/deped-changes-vision-statement-removes-god-loving |title=DepEd changes vision statement, removes 'God-loving' |work=ABS-CBNnews.com |date=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the early [[Spain|Spanish]] period, [[education in the Philippines]] was [[religion]]-oriented and was primarily for the elite, especially in the first years of Spanish colonization. Access to education by Filipinos was later liberalized through the enactment of the Educational Decree of 1863, which provided for the establishment of at least one [[primary school]] for boys and girls in each town under the responsibility of the municipal government, and the establishment of a [[normal school]] for male teachers under the supervision of the [[Jesuits]]. Primary instruction was secularized and free, and the teaching of Spanish was compulsory. It was also through this decree that the 'Superior Commission of Primary Instruction' was established, the seminal agency of the Department of Education.&lt;ref name="DepEd History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deped.gov.ph/about_deped/history.asp |title=Department of Education of the Philippines - DepEd - History |accessdate=1 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722150827/http://www.deped.gov.ph/about_deped/history.asp |archivedate=22 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of Spain by [[United States]] forces in 1898 paved the way for [[Emilio Aguinaldo|Aguinaldo]]'s Republic under a Revolutionary Government. The schools maintained by Spain for more than three centuries were closed temporarily but were reopened on August 29, 1898 by the Secretary of the Interior. A system of free and compulsory elementary education was established by the [[Malolos Constitution]], under Article 23. However, this first sovereign education system was interrupted in 1899 with the start of the [[Philippine–American War]], and was finally dismantled.

A secularized and free [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] system during the first decade of American rule was established upon the recommendation of the [[Schurman Commission]] in 1900. Free primary instruction that trained the people for the duties of citizenship was enforced by the [[Taft Commission]] as per instructions of [[President of the United States|US President]] [[William McKinley]]. Chaplains and non-commissioned officers were assigned to teach using English as the medium of instruction.&lt;ref name="DepEd History"/&gt;

A highly centralized public school system was instituted in January 1901 by the Taft Commission, by virtue of Act No. 74. This act also established the '''Department of Public Instruction''', headed by a General Superintendent. The implementation of this Act created a heavy shortage of teachers so the Philippine Commission authorized the Superintendent of Public Instruction to brin 500 teachers from the [[United States]] to the Philippines. They would later be popularly known as the [[Thomasites]].

In 1908, the [[Philippine Legislature]] approved Act No. 1870, creating the [[University of the Philippines]].

The [[Jones Law (Philippines)|Organic Act of 1916]] reorganized the Department of Public Instruction, mandating that it be headed by a Secretary. This act also mandated the Filpinization of department secretaries, except that of the Secretary of Public Instruction.

During [[World War II]], the department was reorganized once again through the Japanese's Military Order No. 2 in February 1942, splitting the department into the '''Ministry of Education''' and the Ministry of Health, Labor and Public Instruction. Under the Japanese, the teaching of Tagalog, Philippine history, and character education was given priority. Love for work and the [[dignity of labor]] were also emphasized.

In October 1944, months after Pres. [[Manuel L. Quezon]]'s death, the department was renamed as the '''Department of Public Instruction and Information''', with [[Carlos P. Romulo]] at the helm. Upon the return and resumption of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth Government]] in February 1945, its name was changed to the '''Department of Instruction'''.

In 1947, by virtue of Executive Order No. 94 by Pres. [[Manuel Roxas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/1947/10/04/executive-order-no-94-s-1947/ |title=Executive Order No. 94, s. 1947 |work=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the department was reorganized to the '''Department of Education'''. During this period, the regulation and supervision of public and private schools belonged to the Bureau of Public and Private Schools.

Upon the start of [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial Law]] in September 1972, it became the '''Department of Education and Culture''' and subsequently reorganized into the '''Ministry of Education and Culture''' in June 1978 by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 1397,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno1397.html |title=Presidential Decree No. 1397 |work=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the shift to a [[parliamentary system of government]]. Thirteen regional offices were created and major organizational changes were implemented in the educational system.

The Education Act of 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/bataspam/bp1982/bp_232_1982.html |title=Batas Pambansa Blg. 232 |work=The LAWPHiL Project |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; created the '''Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports''', which became the '''Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS)''' in 1987 via Executive Order No. 117&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/executive/execord/eo1987/eo_117_1987.html |title=Executive Order No. 117 |work=The LAWPHiL Project |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by President [[Corazon C. Aquino]].

The structure of DECS as embodied in EO 117 has practically remained unchanged until 1994, when the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED) was established, and in August 25, 1994, when the [[Technical Education and Skills Development Authority]] (TESDA) was established to supervise tertiary degree programs and non-degree technical-vocational programs, respectively. The trifocal education system refocused the department's mandate to basic education which covers elementary, secondary and non-formal education, including culture and sports. CHED is responsible for tertiary education, while TESDA now administers the post-secondary, middle-level manpower training and development.&lt;ref name="DepEd History"/&gt;

In August 2001, the Governance of Basic Education Act&lt;ref name="RA 9155"/&gt; was passed, renaming the DECS to the '''Department of Education (DepEd)''' and redefining the role of field offices, which include regional offices, division offices, district offices, and schools.

The Act removed the administration of cultural and sports activities from the department. The National Historical Institute, Records Management and Archives Office, and the National Library are now administratively attached to the [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] (NCCA). All previous functions, programs, and activities related to sports competition were transferred to the [[Philippine Sports Commission]] (PSC). In addition, the Bureau of Physical Education and School Sports was abolished.

'''Deweyism''' is the [[philosophy of education]] expounded by [[John Dewey]] in his 1897 article "[[S:My Pedagogic Creed|My Pedagogic Creed]]".&lt;ref name="PC"&gt;Dewey, John (1897). My Pedagogic Creed. ''School Journal'', 54(3), 77–80.&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasized social interaction and group learning over individual education, and became the dominant influence on American education.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Review of John Dewey's ''My Pedagogic Creed''==

===What education is===
According to [[John Dewey]]'s article "[[S:My Pedagogic Creed|My Pedagogic Creed]]" (1897),&lt;ref name="PC"/&gt; education is only as individual as our society allows it to be. We (people) are unconsciously trained from birth. Our social consciousness, our cultural ways and what we value are a mock up of a collective social being, according to Dewey. We are all a product of our social surroundings from birth through adulthood and death. Eventually we "become an inheritor of the funded capital of civilization." Dewey exerts that individual best is achieved in the spirit of and for the greater good. "Through these demands he is stimulated to act as a member of a unity, to emerge from his original narrowness of action and feeling and to conceive of himself from the standpoint of the welfare of the group to which he belongs." As a member of society, we are confined to language and its meanings, but also empowered by it.

Dewey believes that "the educational process has two sides." Psychological and sociological impacts are two sides of the education process that go hand-in-hand; "neither can be subordinated to the other or neglected without evil results following." Psychology provides the foundation of education while sociology provides the scenario. Unless what is taught and how we teach relates to students' lives, it can become stressful. Even good grades are not indicative of authentic learning. Students may become disenfranchised. Psychology and social dynamics must exist in conjunction with each other to create a truly internal experience. It is important to know what is happening in the world-at-large, according to Dewey. One must also look at the student's world to ensure success relevant to their own realm of accomplishment. "We must also be able to project them into the future to see what their outcome and end will be." Dewey holds that we must look into the individual future of every student and see what their own outlook is and how we can get there—not a collective outlook defined by blanket societal expectations of success by every person. Dewey states, "To know what a power really is we must know what its end, use, or function is." In sum, a student cannot achieve power over their future until they know what their future can be. Teachers cannot prepare students for a future we cannot foretell as a result of ever-changing technology. People can truly prepare for the future by empowering students. In Dewey's words, "To prepare him for the future life means to give him command of himself." Hands-on learning that utilizes the senses and capacity of the student creates the most success, intrinsically and externally. Dewey believes "that the individual who is to be educated as a social individual and that society is an organic union of individuals." Demonstration of this success shows a psychological process. Utilizing the skills derived from effective psychological learning, social factors can be successfully recognized and addressed.

===Schools===
Education is a social process. According to the creed, it should not be used for the purposes of preparation for living in the future. Dewey said, "I believe that education, therefore, is a process of living and not a preparation for future living." We can build a child's self-esteem in not only the classroom but in all aspects of his or her life. Education must always stay true to children and align with their reality in order to be true. Dewey argues that some children are over labeled and misunderstood because we take away authentic experiences by not relating education to natural human order. More importantly he emphasizes, "Existing life is so complex that the child cannot be brought into contact with it without either confusion or distraction….and he becomes either unduly specialized or else disintegrated."

Dewey believes that education and school ought to be an extension of home. Personal background is psychological and gives way to new ideas. This is summed up in the quote, "It is the business of the school to deepen and extend his sense of the values bound up in his home life." In schools currently, the information is given, lessons are learned and habits are formed, similar to the [[banking model of education]] criticised by [[Paulo Freire]] in his 1970 book ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Freire, Paulo. ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed''. New York: Continuum, 2007 [1970].&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey states that this is not effective. Working together is vital to unity and success. He states, "The present educational systems, so far as they destroy or neglect this unity, render it difficult or impossible to get any genuine, regular moral meanings."
We need to see school as a social experience, according to this creed. The teacher is the guide and chooses what relevant experience will guide each child through the education process. When it comes to assessment, Dewey states that grading should be relevant to the child's own progress. Exams are to be used for social ordering rather than individual upkeep.

===The subject-matter of education===
Following suit with his other theories, Dewey believes that subject matter should reflect students' real lives. Schools focus on too many subjects, which may not reflect the students' actual experiences. The child's own activities should determine curriculum. For example, students are often given literature lessons at the beginning of the learning experience, when it is the sum of events, making the subject relevant for the end of learning; This gives the student time to shape his or her own views before being told how history or some one else has seen something. It should be given at the end as a summative reflection. 

We need to let children be constructive and pave their own paths, according to Dewey. "I believe that the only way to make a child conscious of his social heritage is to enable him to perform those fundamental types of activity which makes civilization what it is." Dewey takes on a constructive point of view. He says that at times vocations may be more relevant and should be main subjects. In order to learn formal subjects, students need to be relaxed. Dewey explains that in order to achieve that, they must be comfortable with what they have learned up to that point. All subjects are relevant to life.

===Method===
# Dewey asserts that active participation far surpasses passive learning. Action must come before anything else. We create children's negative perceptions of school. Ideas come from movement. Symbols give an inaccurate and incomplete view of the big picture. They impact the student's ability to think authentically.
# Envisioning the message helps with retention. Imagery is so important in generating relevancy to one's life.
# It is the teacher's job to pay attention to student's blooming interests and expand on them for a one of a kind learning experience. Interest is power and we must harbor that interest.
# Welcome emotions in education. They are part of the important aspects of learning.

===School and social progress===
In Dewey's words, "education is the fundamental method of social progress and reform." Social consciousness shapes individual perceptions. Society also has an obligation to reform education. As a society we are responsible for one another. "I believe it is the business of every one interested in education to insist upon the school as the primary and most effective instrument of social progress and reform in order that society may be awakened to realize what the school stands for, and aroused to the necessity of endowing the educator with sufficient equipment properly to perform his task." Education is the perfect combination of art and science. Dewey sees that we must use individuality for the greater good. Dewey recognizes that teaching is noble and selfless. Teachers show us our way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6786">'''E-mentoring''' is a means of providing a guided mentoring relationship using [[Cloud computing|online software]] or [[email]]. It stemmed from [[mentoring]] programs with the invention of the internet, and began to gain popularity around 1993. First used for programs connecting schoolchildren with business people, e-mentoring is now popular throughout [[United States|the US]], [[United Kingdom|the UK]], and some parts of [[Europe]].  A very recent development is websites offering online mentoring (not just matching of a mentor and a mentee).

== Early e-mentoring ==

Many early e-mentoring programs used [[email]] communication to link mentors and mentees. [[Telephone]] communication was also occasionally used, known as telementoring.  One of the first e-mentoring programs was developed in [[Canada]] in 1990, where teachers from schools in [[British Columbia]] were given online support and training by experienced peers. The teachers and peers never met in a [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] context.&lt;ref&gt;"Mentoring: students and young people" Andrew Miller, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Web-based e-mentoring ==

Modern e-mentoring projects tend to rely on [[Web application|web-based]] solutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aimhighersw.ac.uk/cases/casestudy31.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024133434/http://www.aimhighersw.ac.uk/cases/casestudy31.htm |archivedate=2008-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly if children are involved. Online [[software]] allows both mentors and mentees to log into a secure online environment where they can converse under [[supervision]] of moderators and coordinators.

An example of an e-mentoring organization is in the US is MentorNet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mentornet.net Mentoring in Engineering and Science - MentorNet]&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit e-mentoring organization that focuses on women and underrepresented minorities in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields. MentorNet uses an algorithm to match over 27,000 mentor relationships since 1997. The organization is unique because it uses technology to guide relationships between mentors and protégés. MentorNet focuses on college-level protégés for the 8-month matching scheme. Another US provider is Chronus who provide eMentoring services across various sectors from enterprise to non-profit.

An example of an e-mentoring provider in the UK is Brightside,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebrightsidetrust.org Brightside - home]&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit e-mentoring organization that works with 60 businesses, charities and universities. Brightside has developed a secure online portal featuring interactive content and resources through which over 6,000 trained online mentors are connected with over 21,000 young people, providing them with information and guidance about education and employment. Newer entrants to the UK market include sfG MentorNet®,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgmentornet.com sfG MentorNet® Website]&lt;/ref&gt; which was designed jointly with a youth-based mentoring charity but which is also now being used by an increasing number of Careers Departments within UK universities. Others include Aluminati with their Aluminate eMentoring platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aluminati.net/app/aluminate-portal/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626052609/http://www.aluminati.net/app/aluminate-portal |archivedate=2015-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; targeted to alumni and students of higher educational institutions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aluminati.net/clients/]&lt;/ref&gt; and Mentor Match Me.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mentormatchme.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Online mentoring websites attempt to offer a knowledge base with access mechanisms so a user can get mentoring advice comparable to the advice they could get from an experienced mentor -- but get the advice directly from their smartphone, tablet or computer, without having to communicate with a human.  One example of this kind of e-mentoring is the MyCareerMentor app. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stepup.work]&lt;/ref&gt;

==E-mentoring mediums==
E-mentoring can retain the face to face interaction by utilizing video chat services, such as [[FaceTime]], [[Google Hangouts]], [[Skype]], video chat through [[Facebook]], etc.

== Controversy and debate ==

Online mentoring is occasionally compared unfavourably with face to face [[mentoring]]. The medium limits the ability to pick up on visual or social clues, makes immediate feedback difficult and can often be seen as impersonal.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

However, e-mentoring can make participants more willing to offer honest feedback.&lt;ref&gt;"Interpersonal effects in computer-mediated interaction: a relational perspective" JB Walther 1992&lt;/ref&gt; It is also being embraced more readily by those in business who want to become mentors, as e-mentoring is less time-consuming than face-to-face mentoring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthcare.advancementoring.com/index.php?FindPage=Advantages+of+our+hybrid+e+mentoring,+telementorin&amp;LayoutSet=short Advance Mentoring - Database Error]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==

It has been suggested that the quality of the mentoring relationship is heavily influenced by the amount of common interests that the mentor and mentee have. As such, most charities and businesses that offer eMentoring programmes require some shared interest between the mentor and mentee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebrightsidetrust.org/viewabout.php?aid=23 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024031247/http://www.thebrightsidetrust.org/viewabout.php?aid=23 |date=October 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also generally accepted that any mentoring relationship is most effective during a transitional period in the mentee's life, such as applying to university or making decisions about future careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishmentoringnetwork.co.uk/uploads/documents/Hunt1.doc |accessdate=September 24, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

E-mentoring programs also impact beneficially on the motivation of the youth pursuing post [[highschool]] studies. The impression, that is driven from the exchanges with an e-mentor working in the field of interests of the youth, of "how important the studies are" if he wants to get the job he dreams of is tangible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://academos.luka.ca/?BD9E0E81-3080-4AEA-A22F-B01DB6E2924E&amp;lang=EN ]{{dead link|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Education (Scotland) Act 1872''' (35 &amp; 36 [[Queen Victoria|Vict]]. c. 62), also known as '''Forster's Education Act''' made [[primary education]] universal and mandatory in Scotland; poverty was no longer an excuse for truancy. 

The act mandated the exclusive use of English-medium education in Scotland, in effect banning [[Scottish Gaelic medium education]]. For this reason it is credited with causing substantial harm to the [[Scottish Gaelic]] language and contributing to its overall decline.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |title=1872 Education Act's impact on Gaelic to be explored |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-19076304 |website=[[BBC News Online]] |accessdate=13 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robertson |first=Boyd |year=2001 |title=Gaelic: the Gaelic language in education in the UK |publisher=Mercator-Education |location=[[Leeuwarden]] |url=https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/3233/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1866 the government established the Argyll Commission, under [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] grandee [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll]], to look into the schooling system. It found that of 500,000 children in need of education 200,000 were receiving it under efficient conditions, 200,000 in schools of doubtful merit, without any inspection and 90,000 were receiving no education at all. Although this compared favourably with the situation in England, with 14% more children in education and with relatively low illiteracy rates of between 10 and 20%, similar to those in the best-educated nations such as those in [[Unification of Germany|Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Scandinavia]], the report was used as support for widespread reform. The result was the 1872 Education (Scotland) Act, based on that passed for [[England and Wales]] as the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]], but providing a more comprehensive solution.&lt;ref name=Checkland&amp;Checkland1989pp112-13/&gt;

==The Act==
Under the act approximately 1,000 regional [[school boards in Scotland|school boards]] were established&lt;ref name=Paterson2001pp566-9&gt;{{cite book |first=L. |last=Patterson |chapter=Schools and schooling: 3. Mass education 1872–present |editor-first=Michael |editor-last=Lynch |title=The Oxford Companion to Scottish History |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-19-211696-7 |pages=566–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, unlike in England where they merely attempted to fill gaps in provision, immediately took over the schools of the old and new kirks and were able to begin to enforce attendance, rather than after the decade necessary in England.&lt;ref name=Checkland&amp;Checkland1989pp112-13/&gt; Some ragged and industrial schools requested to be taken over by the boards, while others continued as Sunday schools.&lt;ref name=Morton2012p181&gt;{{cite book |first=Graeme |last=Morton |title=Ourselves and Others: Scotland 1832–1914 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=2012 |isbn=0748620494 |page=181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All children aged from 5 to 13&amp;nbsp;years were to attend. Poverty was not accepted as an excuse and some help was supplied under the [[Scottish Poor Laws|Poor laws]]. This was enforced by the School Attendance Committee, while the boards busied themselves with building to fill the gaps in provision. This resulted in a major programme that created large numbers of grand, purpose-built schools.&lt;ref name=Checkland&amp;Checkland1989pp112-13&gt;{{cite book |author1-first=Olive |author1-last=Checkland |author2-first=Sydney |author2-last=Checkland |title=Industry and Ethos: Scotland, 1832–1914 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=1989 |isbn=0748601023 |pages=112–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall administration was in the hands of the Scotch (later Scottish) Education Department in London.&lt;ref name=nationalarchive&gt;{{Citation |title=Education records |journal=[[National Archives of Scotland]] |year=2006 |url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/guides/education.asp |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zt5P28yI?url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/guides/education.asp |archivedate=2 July 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Demand for places was high and for a generation after the act there was overcrowding in many classrooms, with up to 70 children being taught in one room. The emphasis on a set number of passes at exams also led to much learning by rote and the system of inspection led to even the weakest children being drilled with certain facts.&lt;ref name=Checkland&amp;Checkland1989pp112-13/&gt;

==Effect on Gaelic==
The Education (Scotland) Act 1872 effectively put an end to non-English medium education and repressed Gaelic with pupils being punished for speaking the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/18678/Language%20shift%20on%20Skye%20-%20printed%20version.pdf?sequence=2 |title=Gaelic Language Erosion and Revitalization on the Isle of Skye, Scotland |first1=Dick |last1=Smakman |first2=Cassandra |last2=Smith-Christmas |publisher=[[University of Leiden]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pupils were belted if caught speaking in Gaelic and beaten again if they did not reveal the names of other students speaking Gaelic.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The effect of the education act upon the Gaelic language has been described as "disastrous"&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ldowI6VgeMC&amp;pg=PA568 |title=The Edinburgh history of the Scots language |first=Charles |last=Jones |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |date=1997 |page=568 |accessdate=22 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by denying the value of Gaelic culture and language, contributed to destroying the self-respect of Gaelic communities.&lt;ref name="sorrow" /&gt; It was a continuation of a general policy (by both [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish]] and, after [[Acts of Union 1707|1707]], [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British]] governments) which aimed at [[Anglicisation]].&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

As a result of facing punishment and humiliation for speaking Gaelic, many parents decided not to pass on the language to their children, resulting in [[language shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Dunbar |editor-first1=Deirdre |editor-last1=Fottrell |editor-first2=Bill |editor-last2=Bowring |chapter=The European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages: Some Reflections from a Scottish Gaelic Perspective |title=Minority and Group Rights in the New Millennium |date=27 October 1999 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |page=117 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6sI_S_FoMfIC&amp;pg=PA117 |accessdate=13 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scottish Gaelic medium education]] was not established until the 1980s, and the impact of the Act is still being felt in Gaelic communities today.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sorrow"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hunter |first1=James |title=On the Other Side of Sorrow: Nature and People in the Scottish Highlands |date=3 July 2014 |publisher=Birlinn |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZy8BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT66 |accessdate=15 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1706">Monsignor '''Felix Newton Pitt''' was born in 1894. He was born in [[Fairfield, Kentucky]]. He attended the [[St. Meinrad]] Seminary in Indiana from 1911 to 1915. He held a Swiss academic doctorate. One of his achievements was founding and organizing the Catholic school office in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. In 1928 and 1929 while Secretary of the Catholic School Board he formed the Catholic Recreation Commission.  He was a pioneer on WHAS radio in ecumenical broadcast. He has also served on the post-World War II international committee. In 1949 when he was 55 years old he founded Pitt Academy a school for special kids. It was the first facility in Louisville for developmentally disabled students. Msgr. Pitt is also an [[author]] who in 1951 wrote the book "Catholic Education Today and Tomorrow". He died in 1971 at the age of 77. 

A biography was published in 2016 by his nephew on his sister's side, Pitt G. Thome:  Journey of a Country Soul:  The Life and Ministry of Monsignor Felix N. Pitt, Kentucky's Preeminent Catholic Educator of the 20th Century.  While it contains personal anecdotes, much of the book focuses on researched historical information placed in the context of events as they occurred.

The '''[[Grand Challenges]] for Social Work''' is an initiative spearheaded by the [[American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare]].

The [[social work]] profession has identified 12 challenges as inspirational objectives for society in the [[United States]]. The challenges are modeled after a similar undertaking led by the [[National Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalil, T. (2012, April 12). The Grand Challenges of the 21st century.

In 2013, the Grand Challenges for Social Work Executive Committee engaged national social work organizations, interest groups, and academic institutions to conceptualize and outline the Grand Challenges initiative. The committee decided on an inclusive, bottom-up approach, soliciting ideas from academia, the practice community, and the public. More than 80 suggestions for Grand Challenge topics were submitted online and in-person. From the ideas, the committee issued a call for concept papers and approximately 40 papers were submitted. As part of this work, the group commissioned several background papers&lt;ref&gt;Sherraden, M., Barth, R. P., Brekke, J., Fraser, M., Mandersheid, R., &amp; Padgett, D. (2014).

Social work scholars are leading 12 implementation networks, and universities of all sizes are beginning to organize by regional consortia.

== University efforts ==
Several events focused on Grand Challenges are taking place around the country. Berkeley Social Welfare has held sessions on health and mental health, the effect of new technology on [[Social services|social service]] delivery and outcomes, women and poverty, and issues around aging services and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialwelfare.berkeley.edu/newsarticles/grand-challenges-social-work|title=Grand Challenges in Social Work {{!}} Berkeley Social Welfare|website=socialwelfare.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 11, 2016, the University of Iowa, with the support of the National Association of Social Workers, held a day-long conference on the Grand Challenges. The aim of the conference was to bolster the leadership capacity of social work professionals and social justice advocates by detailing the issues and current efforts to address them, as well as initiating conversations around promising new approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clas.uiowa.edu/socialwork/sites/clas.uiowa.edu.socialwork/files/FINAL.pdf|title=University of Iowa Conference on Grand Challenges|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Innovations ==
Social work has been concerned with social policy innovation for some time. The profession has been a leader in freeing families from poor houses and children from orphanages, halting [[Child labour|child labor]], advocating for [[Women's rights|women’s rights]] and [[civil rights]], creating [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Fair Labor Standards Act|fair labor standards]], fighting for fair and inclusive [[housing (residential)|housing]], and much more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The social-justice values of social work, combined with research and evidence to inform policy, have made these contributions possible. The profession continues this social policy mission and leadership with the Grand Challenges initiative.&amp;nbsp;In September 2016, the [[George Warren Brown School of Social Work|Brown School of Social Work at Washington University in St. Louis]] hosted a Grand Challenges Policy Conference in partnership with the AASWSW to specify steps toward positive policy action.

The Grand Challenges for Social Work offer an interdisciplinary approach to major issues facing our society, on a national level and locally. In Detroit, Tam Perry, PhD, has called for researchers, community members, practitioners, and policymakers to collaborate on making real, sustained changes to benefit the city’s residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.authorityhealth.org/-/population-health-blog/uncategorized/social-works-grand-challenges-and-its-relevance-to-health-concerns-in-detroit|title=» Social Work’s Grand Challenges and their relevance to health concerns in Detroit|website=www.authorityhealth.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defining the profession ==
The Grand Challenges initiative is also helping to define social work as a profession. Many people outside the field of social work do not realize the breadth of issues that social workers affect. There have been several efforts to help the public better understand the various roles social workers play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teasley|first=M. L.|date=2015-07-01|title=Social Work Grand Challenges: An Opportunity to Increase Student Success|url=https://academic.oup.com/cs/article-abstract/37/3/131/404174/Social-Work-Grand-Challenges-An-Opportunity-to?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Children &amp; Schools|language=en|volume=37|issue=3|pages=131–133|doi=10.1093/cs/cdv019|issn=1532-8759}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.socialworker.com/extras/social-work-month-project-2016/grand-challenges-for-social-work-initiative-and-our-future/|title=The Grand Challenges for Social Work Initiative and Our Future|date=2016-02-29|work=SocialWorker.com|access-date=2017-07-28|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grand Challenges initiative also provides an opportunity to further define the profession through curriculum changes in schools of social work. The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has published a paper that “describes the relevance of the GCSWI to professional education and suggests the collective-impact model as a heuristic for professional preparation to collaborate in grand challenge contexts.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialwork.illinois.edu/implementing-the-grand-challenges-for-social-work-initiative/|title=Implementing the Grand Challenges for Social Work Initiative – School of Social Work, University of Illinois|website=socialwork.illinois.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And the Grand Challenges initiative has already reached beyond the United States. Social workers in the United Kingdom are considering a similar effort as a way forward for the field of social work there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baron|first=Sam|last2=McLaughlin|first2=Hugh|title=Grand challenges: a way forward for social work?|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02615479.2017.1283729|journal=Social Work Education|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–5|doi=10.1080/02615479.2017.1283729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22101">'''Hazing in Greek letter organizations''' is defined as any act or set of acts that constitutes [[hazing]] and occurs in connection to a [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternity or sorority]].

Hazing is often cited as one of the most harmful aspects of fraternities and sororities and poses a major threat to their existence, drawing great criticism from educators and administrators {{Harv|Whipple|Sullivan|1998}}. As fraternities and sororities are very diverse in their structures, regulations, governing entities, and memberships, and as hazing can take on many forms, the issue of hazing within these organizations is complex and multifaceted.

==Definitions==
While most educational institutions include [[hazing]] in their disciplinary procedures, definitions of hazing can vary substantially {{Harv|Hollmann|2002}}.

The Fraternal Information &amp; Programming Group (FIPG) defines hazing activities as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = FIPG Risk Management Policy | publisher = Fraternal Information &amp; Programming Group | date = July 2008 | url = http://www.fipg.org/FIPG/FIPG.nsf/835fe7d91217664d8525723c007a7545/9c0d3c4d4ca5614e8525734b007b08a4/$FILE/FIPG%20Policy%20July%202008.pdf | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | accessdate = 27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Any action taken or situation created, intentionally, whether on or off fraternity premises, to produce mental or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment, or ridicule.  Such activities may include but are not limited to the following:  use of alcohol, paddling in any form, creation of excessive fatigue, physical and psychological shocks, quests, treasure hunts, scavenger hunts, road trips or any other such activities carried on outside or inside of the confines of the chapter house; wearing of public apparel which is conspicuous and not normally in good taste, engaging in public stunts and buffoonery, morally degrading or humiliating games and activities, and other activities which are not consistent with academic achievement, fraternal law, ritual or policy or the regulations and policies of the educational institution or applicable state law.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hazing is a crime in 44 states.&lt;ref name=laws&gt;{{cite web | title = State Anti-Hazing Laws | work = StopHazing.org: Educating to Eliminate Hazing | url = http://www.stophazing.org/laws.html | accessdate = 26 May 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090422161349/http://www.stophazing.org/laws.html | archivedate = 22 April 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Arizona Revised Statutes provides the following definition:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/13/03107.htm 15-2301 - Hazing prevention policies; definitions]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Hazing" means any intentional, knowing or reckless act committed by a student, whether individually or in concert with other persons, against another student, and in which both of the following apply:
(a) The act was committed in connection with an initiation into, an affiliation with or the maintenance of membership in any organization that is affiliated with an educational institution.
(b) The act contributes to a substantial risk of potential physical injury, mental harm or degradation or causes physical injury, mental harm or personal degradation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Most educational institutions have their own definitions of hazing, and many are required to by state statutes.

Generally, institutions of higher education will have their own definitions of hazing, though they may closely mirror definitions found in their respective state statutes. For example, the [[University of Arizona]] provides the following definition of hazing in its “University of Arizona Hazing Policy”, revised October 25, 2001:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=University of Arizona Hazing Policy|url=http://web.arizona.edu/~policy/Hazing.pdf|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|accessdate=31 May 2009|date=25 October 2001|publisher=University of Arizona Dean of Student’s Office|ref=harv|postscript=.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616190132/http://web.arizona.edu/~policy/Hazing.pdf|archivedate=16 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Hazing" means any intentional, knowing or reckless act committed by a student, whether individually or in concert with other persons, against another student, and in which both of the following apply:
(a) The act was committed in connection with an initiation into, an affiliation with or the maintenance of membership in any organization that is affiliated with the University.
(b) The act contributes to a substantial risk of potential physical injury, mental harm or degradation or causes physical injury, mental harm or personal degradation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Note that the University of Arizona’s definition of hazing is virtually identical to the definition outlined in the Arizona Revised Statutes.

The current [[North American Interfraternity Conference]] (NIC) definition of hazing also includes anything that could turn into hazing. This is the reason that many potentially innocent activities, such as a scavenger hunt, are included under hazing; they could start out as perfectly legal events, but could easily be modified to include some activity that could make it hazing (ex. stealing some of the items on the list or adding heavy drinking before or during). Requiring candidates, or even members as there is "brother on brother hazing", to attend events or be at a certain place at a certain time is also hazing. Many also consider the use of the term 'pledge' to be hazing. It should also be noted that things like physical activity will be condoned if there are fraters that are in the [[US Army]] or other armed forces present, whereas if those members weren't there it would be considered hazing.(Godwin, 2012)

==Problems in the quantitative analysis==
Due to the nature of hazing, the secretive nature of Greek letter organizations, and the fear of negative repercussions, hazing is largely underreported. Most, if not all, hazing activities take place either during pledge (or “interest”) activities or rituals, which are almost always secretive. Additionally, since many Greek letter organizations, such as those governed by the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] (NPHC) and the [[National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations]] (NALFO), prohibit their pledges (also known as “interests” or “new members”) from revealing their association with their organization until they have been initiated, it becomes increasingly difficult for institutions to reach out to members in anti-hazing efforts. It also becomes virtually impossible for these pledges or interests to reach out for help, especially if they wish to remain members, pledges, or interests of their organizations. However, Cheryl Drout and Christie Corsoro of State University of New York at Fredonia state, "Hazing, which is officially banned by all national Greek organizations, frequently comes to the public’s attention through the popular news media when the activities become fatal” (Drout &amp; Corsoro, 2003). Unfortunately for multitudes of members of Greek organizations, “Sororities and fraternities have come to be synonymous with elitism, sexual assault, high-risk hazing (initiation ceremonies) and other bad behavior on American university campuses” (Marcus, 2007). 

Fraternities and sororities are commonly associated with [[paddle (spanking)|paddling]] of members, especially new members or pledges, as part of their hazing rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Emily E.[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/frat_treated_student_to_badly_his_cv2oyewTIJtQF6XdIjNCDK#ixzz1KJ2MySsR "Frat treated student so badly that 'his life may be ruined': suit"]. ''[[New York Post]]'', April 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses to hazing==
Many educational institutions have developed anti-hazing programs, which encourage alternatives to hazing through the planning of purposeful activities, inform students of how to take action and avoid being a [[Bystander effect|bystander]], and provide clear consequences for those students and/or organizations who violate hazing policies {{Harv|Hollmann|2002}}. Additionally, hazing has become a central focus of programs designed to help Greek letter organizations become more value congruent through institutionalized standards and expectations {{Harv|Shonrock|1998}}.

Attempts at preventing hazing have also targeted Greek letter organizations at the national level. {{Harvtxt|Cobb|McRee|2007}} note the important role of culture change within the North American fraternity and sorority movement and even encourage the closure of chapters that consistently partake in illegal and risky activities and pose threats to their local and university communities. {{Harvtxt|DeSousa|Gordon|Kimbrough|2004}} propose the creation of a recognized pledge program in which national fraternity and sorority leaders participate, under the recognized supervision of university officials, as well as the yearly evaluation of fraternities and sororities to determine their eligibility for continued recognition and sponsorship. Again, such a proposal is difficult since many NPHC and NALFO organizations, not to mention other organizations not governed by these umbrella organizations, keep their pledge, interest, or new member programs completely secretive.

Greek letter organizations have themselves taken measures to prevent hazing within their member chapters. As such, individual national organizations have taken various measures to ensure the safety of members with regard to hazing. The [[National Panhellenic Conference]], which governs 26 national and international women’s sororities, includes sanctions against both individuals and groups ranging from member/chapter probation to expulsion of offending members or revocation of the chapter’s charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Frequently Asked Questions About Hazing | publisher = National Panhellenic Council | url = https://www.npcwomen.org/resources/pdf/FAQ-About%20Hazing.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140408041425/https://www.npcwomen.org/resources/pdf/FAQ-About%20Hazing.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 8 April 2014 | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | accessdate = 16 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also runs an anti-hazing hotline for anonymous incident reporting.

Similarly, the North American Interfraternity Conference released a resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = NIC Resolutions | publisher = North-American Interfraternity Conference, Inc. | url = http://www.nicindy.org/nic-resolutions1.html | accessdate = 16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; condemning the practice. In 2010, NIC CEO and President Peter Smithhisler derided the use of hazing as a means of building comradery:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Can Hazing Be Stopped? | publisher = Inside Higher Ed | url =  https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/11/24/hazing | accessdate = 19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“The intention of the hazer is to create unity, to create trust, to establish a person’s commitment to the organization,” he said. “But in reality, what he is doing is creating a bond among the hazees while eliminating the trust between hazer and hazee, ultimately breaking down the bond of brotherhood.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additionally, there are individual national Greek Letter Organizations taking the initiative against activities related to hazing. For example, in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Phi Beta Sigma General Board Mandates All Chapters Conduct Anti-Hazing Workshops | publisher = Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. | url = http://www.phibetasigma1914.org/anti-hazing/ | accessdate = 20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phi Beta Sigma fraternity adopted an anti-hazing campaign to eradicate hazing practices in its individual chapters, providing numerous support resources to effectively combat the practice.

==Fraternity hazing characteristics==
In an article by Hank Nuwer, a professor of journalism and an author of books on hazing, he compared the hazing rituals of fraternities to [[cult]]s. Nuwer talks about the aspects of hazing that make the pledge keep coming back to the fraternity and the ramifications of dropping out. Nuwer consulted with a professor in psychology, [[Margaret Thaler Singer]], to get a better understanding of the characteristics of cults to relate those behaviors with fraternity hazing. Nuwer believes that hazing, along with a cult, is a “’systematic’ manipulation and coercion to effect ‘psychological and social influence’” (Nuwer, B7). The first aspect Nuwer wrote about was “’enforced dependency’” (Nuwer, B7). He talked about how the hazing process where fraternities make their pledges stay at the house the whole time, keeping them sleep deprived and cutting them off from daily activities makes them dependent on their fraternity. Even though the "pledges" may fall behind in school or lose friends outside of their fraternity, the fraternity convinces the pledge that after the hazing ceases, it will all be worth it. This reassurance keeps the pledges coming back, reliant on the people who are hazing them; relating to the next aspect of "family" (Nuwer, B7). Fraternities continually tell their pledges they are joining a family. This aspect appeals to most college freshman that are having a hard time making friends in a different environment. Last, Nuwer discussed how fraternities "make it hard for their members to leave" (Nuwer, B7). He says that those who decide not to join after being hazed have already given up so much for the fraternity that they feel alone and may even experience [[post-traumatic stress]]. Nuwer gives solutions to hazing in fraternities including stronger consequences for those involved in the hazing and that colleges should become more intertwined with the Greek letter community to learn about hazing and to stop it.&lt;ref&gt;Nuwer&lt;/ref&gt;

In a {{Harvtxt|Smith|2015}} article on the motivations for hazing, she states that such actions come from a desire to prove a state of "manliness." Hazing practices in fraternity life began to appear shortly after the [[American Civil War |Civil War]]. Veterans brought the hazing practices of their battalions back with them, adopting such activities into fraternity life. The purpose of hazing was perceived as a way of providing young males an outlet to prove their manliness through rites and trials, showing themselves to be men and not boys. Other hazing practices served to put an individual in his place, reducing his sense of personal omnipotence to "subsume his individuality into something larger and better than himself" (Smith, 2015).

==In popular culture==
The 1977 film ''[[Fraternity Row (film)|Fraternity Row]]'', set in the 1950s, deals with the subject of hazing at a college fraternity, depicting a number of such practices and culminating with [[Gregory Harrison]] as a victim of a hazing ritual that inadvertently takes a fatal turn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4484">'''Hotchkiss Scholar''' 
The highest honor conferred upon a graduating student from [[Lake Forest Graduate School of Management]] (LFGSM) is to be named a Hotchkiss Scholar.  Hotchkiss Scholars are selected on the basis of outstanding academic achievement and demonstrated commitment to the spirit of excellence. Hotchkiss Scholar eligibility is limited to the top 5% of the graduating class, based on Grade Point Average (GPA) ranking.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lakeforestmba.edu/Alumni/alumni_news_success/hotchkiss_scholars.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hotchkiss Scholar award was established in 1984 in honor of Dr. Eugene Hotchkiss III, President Emeritus of [[Lake Forest College]] and former member of the LFGSM Board of Directors.

Hotchkiss Scholars are announced at graduation because the final ranking of the graduating class is not known until after final exams are graded and the final GPA for each graduating student is calculated. Prior to the beginning of the graduation ceremony, the new Hotchkiss Scholars are presented with the Hotchkiss Scholars medallion, which is worn during the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Hotchkiss Scholar Medallion - Obverse.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Hotchkiss Scholar Medallion - Reverse.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt; The new scholars are also announced from the podium during the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iAXCn4S4uI 2011 Hotchkiss Scholars announced at graduation&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake Forest Graduate School of Management hosts an annual recognition dinner to honor the Hotchkiss Scholars. This dinner is usually scheduled for October or November and typically held at the Lake Forest campus. All prior Hotchkiss Scholars are invited to attend.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lakeforestmba.edu/upload/docs/hotchkiss%20happenings/hotchkisshappeningsoctober2005.pdf LFGSM Hotchkiss Scholar E-Newsletter, October 2005 Annual Recognition Dinner
&lt;/ref&gt; The guest of honor is Dr. Eugene Hotchkiss III, for whom the scholarship is named. This dinner features a cocktail reception, welcoming speech, buffet dinner, featured presentation or panel discussion, and introduction of the new class of Hotchkiss Scholars. The new scholars receive a certificate of recognition and a memento marking the occasion.

The '''House of Wisdom''' ({{lang-ar|بيت الحكمة}}; ''Bayt al-Ḥikmah'') refers either to a major [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] public academy and intellectual center in [[Baghdad]] or to a large private library belonging to the Abbasid Caliphs during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].&lt;ref name="Gutas1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dimitri Gutas|title=Greek Thought, Arabic Culture: The Graeco-Arabic Translation Movement in Baghdad and Early ʻAbbāsid Society (2nd–4th/8th–10th Centuries)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6cm_KK6Ubk8C&amp;pg=PA53|year=1998|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-06132-2|pages=53–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Khalili2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jim Al-Khalili|title=The House of Wisdom: How Arabic Science Saved Ancient Knowledge and Gave Us the Renaissance|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJ5zDM1KfewC&amp;pg=PT53|date=31 March 2011|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-47623-9|page=53|chapter=5: The House of Wisdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Wisdom is the subject of an active dispute over its functions and existence as a formal academy, an issue complicated by a lack of physical evidence following the collapse of the Abbasid Caliphate and a reliance on corroboration of literary sources to construct a narrative. The House of Wisdom was founded either as a library for the collections of the Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] in the late 8th century and later turned into a public academy during the reign of [[Al-Ma'mun]] or was a private collection created by [[Al-Mansur]] (reign 754–775) to house rare books and collections of poetry in both Arabic and Persian.&lt;ref name="Gutas1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Cambridge History of Islam|last=Brentjes|first=Sonja|last2=Morrison|first2=Robert G.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=|volume=4|location=Cambridge|pages=569|chapter=The Sciences in Islamic Societies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the House of Wisdom existed as a part of the major [[Translation Movement]] taking place during the Abbasid Era, translating works from Greek and Syriac to Arabic, but it is unlikely that the House of Wisdom existed as the sole center of such work, as major translation efforts arose in Cairo and Damascus even earlier than the proposed establishment of the House of Wisdom.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval Islamic medicine|last=Pormann|first=Peter E.|last2=Savage-Smith|first2=Emilie|date=2007|publisher=Georgetown University Press|others=|isbn=9781589011601|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=20–29|oclc=71581787|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This translation movement lent momentum to a great deal of original research occurring in the Islamicate world, which had access to texts from Greek, Persian and Indian sources, as opposed to the "Bookshelf Thesis" that reduces the contributions of Islamicate scholars to mere translation and preservation of Greek texts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The House of Wisdom was made possible by the consistent flow of Arab, Persian, and other scholars of the Islamicate world to Baghdad, owing to the city's position as capital of the Abbasid Caliphate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is evidenced by the large number of scholars known to have studied in Baghdad between the 8th and 13th centuries, such as [[Al-Jahiz]], [[Al-Kindi]], and [[Al-Ghazali]] among others,  all of whom would have contributed to a vibrant academic community in Baghdad, producing a great number of notable works, regardless of the existence of a formal academy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The fields to which scholars associated with the House of Wisdom contributed include, but are not limited to [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]], [[medicine]], [[astronomy]], and [[optics]].&lt;ref&gt;"Al-Khalili 2011, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The early name of the library, ''Khizanat al-Hikma'' (literally, "Storehouse of Wisdom"), derives from its function as a place for the preservation of rare books and poetry, a primary function of the House of Wisdom until its destruction.&lt;ref name="Gutas1998" /&gt; The House of Wisdom and its contents were destroyed in the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)]], leaving very little in the way of archaeological evidence for the House of Wisdom, such that most knowledge about it is derived from the works of contemporary scholars of the era such as [[Al-Tabari]] and [[Ibn al-Nadim]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== History of ==

=== Foundation and origins ===
[[File:ManuscriptAbbasid.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The earliest scientific [[manuscript]]s originated in the Abbasid era.]]

Throughout the 4th to 7th centuries, scholarly work in the Arabic languages was either newly initiated, or carried on from the Hellenistic period. Centers of learning and of transmission of classical wisdom included colleges such as the [[School of Nisibis]] and later the [[School of Edessa]], and the renowned hospital and medical [[Academy of Gondishapur|academy of Jundishapur]]; libraries included the [[Library of Alexandria]] and the [[Imperial Library of Constantinople]]; and other centers of translation and learning functioned at [[Merv]], [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]], [[Nishapur]] and [[Ctesiphon]] situated just south of what was later to become Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;Kaser, Karl [https://books.google.com/books?id=j3i8muwLf8AC&amp;pg=PA137 The Balkans and the Near East: Introduction to a Shared History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151128060615/https://books.google.com/books?id=j3i8muwLf8AC&amp;pg=PA137# |date=2015-11-28 }} p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yazberdiyev, Dr. Almaz [http://www.turkmenhost.com/documents/Journal2/merv.html Libraries of Ancient Merv] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032324/http://www.turkmenhost.com/documents/Journal2/merv.html# |date=2016-03-04 }} Dr. Yazberdiyev is Director of the Library of the Academy of Sciences of Turkmenistan, Ashgabat.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Umayyad]] era, [[Muawiyah I]] started to gather a collection of books in [[Damascus]]. He then formed a library that were referred to by the name of "Bayt al-Hikma".&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalili 2011, pp.67-78&lt;/ref&gt; Books written in Greek, Latin, and Persian in the fields of medicine, alchemy, physics, mathematics, astrology and other disciplines were also collected and translated by Muslim scholars at that time.&lt;ref name="Lyons"&gt;Lyons, pp. 55-77&lt;/ref&gt; Remarkably, the Umayyads also appropriated [[history of paper|paper-making techniques]] from the Chinese and joined many ancient intellectual centers under their rule, and employed Christian and Persian scholars to both translate works into Arabic, and to develop new knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Meri, Josef W. and Jere L. Bacharach. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MypbfKdMePIC&amp;pg=PA304  “Medieval Islamic Civilization”. Vol. 1 Index A – K].  2006, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; These were fundamental elements that contributed directly to the flourishing of scholarship in the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref name="Lyons" /&gt;

In 750, the [[Abbasid]] dynasty replaced the Umayyad as the ruling dynasty of the Islamic Empire, and, in 762, the caliph [[al-Mansur]] (r. 754 – 775) built [[Baghdad]] and made it his capital, instead of Damascus. Baghdad's location and cosmopolitan population made the perfect location for a stable commercial and intellectual center.&lt;ref name="Lyons" /&gt; The Abbasid dynasty had a strong Persian bent,&lt;ref name="Wiet. Baghdad"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/wiet.html# |title=Wiet. Baghdad&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-12-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107030859/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/wiet.html# |archive-date=2010-01-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted many practices from the [[Sassanian Empire]] – among those, that of translating foreign works, except that now texts were translated into Arabic. For this purpose, al-Mansur founded a palace library, modeled after the Sassanian Imperial Library, and provided economic and political support to the intellectuals working there. He also invited delegations of scholars from India and other places to share their knowledge of mathematics and astronomy with the new Abbasid court.&lt;ref name="Lyons" /&gt;

In the [[Abbasid Empire]], many foreign works were translated into [[Arabic]] from [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. The Translation Movement gained great momentum during the reign of caliph [[Harun al-Rashid|al-Rashid]], who, like his predecessor, was personally interested in scholarship and poetry. Originally the texts concerned mainly medicine, mathematics and astronomy; but, other disciplines, especially philosophy, soon followed. Al-Rashid's library, direct predecessor to the House of Wisdom, was also known as Bayt al-Hikma or, as the historian [[Al-Qifti]] called it, Khizanat Kutub al-Hikma (Arabic for "Storehouse of the Books of Wisdom").&lt;ref name="Al-Khalili 2011, pp. 67–78"&gt;Al-Khalili 2011, pp. 67–78&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Under Al-Ma'mun ===
[[File:ChirurgicalOperation15thCentury.JPG|250px|left|thumb|[[Physician]]s employing a [[Surgery|surgical]] method. From [[Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu]]'s ''Imperial Surgery'' (1465)]]

Under the sponsorship of caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] (r. 813 – 833), economic support of the House of Wisdom and scholarship in general was greatly increased. Furthermore, Abbasid society itself came to understand and appreciate the value of knowledge, and support also came from merchants and the military.&lt;ref name="Lyons" /&gt; It was easy for scholars and translators to make a living and an academic life was a symbol of status; scientific knowledge was considered so valuable that books and ancient texts were sometimes preferred as war booty rather than riches.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalili 2011, pp. 67-78&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'' was claimed as a condition for peace by al-Ma'mun after a war between the Abbasids and the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name="Angelo2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph A. Angelo|title=Encyclopedia of Space and Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VUWno1sOwnUC&amp;pg=PA78|date=14 May 2014|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1018-9|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The House of Wisdom was much more than an academic center removed from the broader society. Its experts served several functions in Baghdad. Scholars from the Bayt al-Hikma usually doubled as engineers and architects in major construction projects, kept accurate official calendars, and were public servants. They were also frequently medics and consultants.&lt;ref name="Lyons" /&gt;

Al-Ma'mun was personally involved in the daily life of the House of Wisdom, regularly visiting its scholars and inquiring about their activities. He would also participate in and arbitrate academic debates.&lt;ref name="Lyons" /&gt; Inspired by Aristotle, al-Mamun regularly initiated regular discussion sessions and seminars among experts in ''kalām''. ''Kalām'' is the art of philosophical debate that al-Mamun carried on from his Persian tutor, Ja’far. During debate, scholars would discuss their fundamental Islamic beliefs and doctrines in an open intellectual atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Al-Khalili2011" /&gt; Furthermore, he would often organize groups of sages from the Bayt al-Hikma into major research projects to satisfy his own intellectual needs. For example, he commissioned the mapping of the world, the confirmation of data from the ''Almagest'' and the deduction of the real size of the Earth (see section on the [[#Main activities|main activities]] of the House). He also promoted Egyptology and participated himself in excavations of the [[Great Pyramids of Giza|pyramids of Giza]].&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalili 2011, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Ma’mun built the first astronomical observatories in Baghdad, and he was also the first ruler to fund and monitor the progress of major research projects involving a team of scholars and scientists. His greatest legacy to science is that he was the first ruler to fund "big science".&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalili 2011, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mamun sends an envoy to Theophilos.png|thumb|400px|Al Ma'mun sends an envoy to the Byzantine Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]].]]

Following his predecessors, al-Ma'mun would send expeditions of scholars from the House of Wisdom to collect texts from foreign lands. In fact, one of the directors of the House was sent to Constantinople with this purpose. During this time, Sahl ibn Harun, a Persian poet and astrologer, was the chief librarian of the Bayt al-Hikma. [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]] (809–873) an [[Arabs|Arab]] [[Nestorian]] [[Christian]] physician and scientist, was the most productive translator producing 116 works for the Arabs. The patron of this foundation was under Caliphe al-Ma'mon. Al-Ma'mun established the House of Wisdom, putting Hunayn ibn Ishaq in charge, who then became the most celebrated translator of Greek texts.  As "Sheikh of the translators" he was placed in charge of the translation work by the caliph. Hunayn ibn Ishaq translated the entire collection of Greek medical books, including famous pieces by Galen and Hippocrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4425-0_9796|encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-4020-4559-2|editor-last1 = Selin|editor-first1 = Helaine|last= Iskandar|first=Albert Z.|title=Ḥunayn Ibn Isḥāq}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sabaeans|Sabian]] [[Thābit ibn Qurra]] (826–901) also translated great works by [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]], [[Archimedes]], [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]]. Translations of this era were superior to earlier ones, since the new Abbasid scientific tradition required better and better translations, and the emphasis was many times put in incorporating new ideas to the ancient works being translated.&lt;ref name="Lyons" /&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gingerish|first1=Owen|title=Islamic Astronomy|journal=4|date=April 1986|volume=254|pages=74–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the second half of the ninth century al-Ma'mun's Bayt al-Hikma was the greatest repository of books in the world and had become one of the greatest hubs of intellectual activity in the Middle Ages, attracting the most brilliant Arab and Persian minds.&lt;ref name="Al-Khalili 2011, pp. 67–78"/&gt; The House of Wisdom eventually acquired a reputation as a center of learning, although [[Medieval university|universities]] as we know them did not yet exist at this time — knowledge was transmitted directly from teacher to student, without any institutional surrounding. [[Maktab]]s soon began to develop in the city from the 9th century on, and in the 11th century, [[Nizam al-Mulk]] founded the [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad]], one of the first institutions of higher education in Iraq.

=== Decline under Al-Mutawakkil ===
The House of Wisdom flourished under al-Ma'mun's successors [[al-Mu'tasim]] (r. 833 – 842) and his son [[al-Wathiq]]  (r. 842 – 847), but considerably declined under the reign of [[al-Mutawakkil]] (r. 847–861). Although al-Ma'mun, al-Mu'tasim, and al-Wathiq followed the sect of [[Mu'tazili]], which supported mind-broadness and scientific inquiry, al-Mutawakkil endorsed a more literal interpretation of the [[Qur'an]] and [[Hadith]]. The caliph was not interested in science and moved away from rationalism, seeing the spread of Greek philosophy as anti-Islamic.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalili 2011, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Destruction by the Mongols ===

On February 13, 1258, the Mongols entered the city of the caliphs, starting a full week of pillage and destruction.

== Main activities ==
The House of Wisdom included a society of scientists and academics, a translation department and a library that preserved the knowledge acquired by the Abbasids over the centuries.&lt;ref name="Lyons" /&gt; They also researched and studied alchemy, which was later used to create the structure of modern chemistry. Furthermore, linked to it were also astronomical observatories and other major experimental endeavors. Institutionalized by Al-Ma'mun, the academy encouraged the transcription of Greek philosophical and scientific efforts. Additionally, he imported manuscripts of important texts that were not accessible to the Islamic countries from Byzantium to the library. The House of Wisdom was much more than a library, and a considerable amount of original scientific and philosophical work was produced by scholars and intellectuals related to it. This allowed Muslim scholars to verify astronomical information that was handed down from past scholars.&lt;ref name="Al-Khalili2011" /&gt;

=== Translation ===
The [[Translation Movement]] started in this House of Wisdom and lasted for over two centuries. Over a century and a half, primarily Middle Eastern Oriental Syriac Christian scholars translated all scientific and philosophic Greek texts to Arabic language in the House of Wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, Franz  [https://books.google.com/books?id=I1mkhQYvPIoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Franz+Rosenthal+in+The+Classical+Heritage+in+Islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vWgJUsWDJ8amygGn34DYDA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=%20translators%20&amp;f=false The Classical Heritage in Islam] The University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1975, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, London Peter [https://books.google.com/books?id=KjOkI5VflygC The Great Medieval Thinkers: Al-Kindi] Oxford University Press, New York, 2007, p. 6. London Peter Adamson is a Lecturer in Late Ancient Philosophy at King's College.&lt;/ref&gt; The translation movement at the House of Wisdom was inaugurated with the translation of Aristotle's ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]''. By the time of al-Ma'mun, translators had moved beyond Greek astrological texts, and Greek works were already in their third translations.&lt;ref name="Gutas1998" /&gt; Authors translated include: [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Euclid]], [[Plotinus]], [[Galen]], [[Sushruta]], [[Charaka]], [[Aryabhata]] and [[Brahmagupta]]. Many important texts were translated during this movement including a book about the composition of medicinal drugs, a book on this mixing and the properties of simple drugs, and a book on medical matters by [[Pedanius Dioscorides]]. These, plus many more translations, helped with the advancements in medicine, agriculture, finance, and engineering.

Furthermore, new discoveries motivated revised translations and commentary correcting or adding to the work of ancient authors.&lt;ref name="Lyons"/&gt; In many cases names and terminology were changed;  a prime example of this is the title of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Almagest'', which is an Arabic modification of the original name of the work: ''Megale Syntaxis''.&lt;ref name="Lyons"/&gt;

=== Original contributions ===
[[File:Image-Al-Kitāb al-muḫtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala.jpg|thumb|A page from al-Khwarizmi's ''Kitab al-Jabr.'']]
[[File:Banu musa mechanical.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of ''Self trimming lamp'' in [[Ahmad ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir]]'s treatise on mechanical devices.]]

Besides their translations of earlier works and their commentaries on them, scholars at the Bayt al-Hikma produced important original research. For example, the noted mathematician [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|al-Khwarizmi]] worked in al-Ma'mun's House of Wisdom and is famous for his contributions to the development of algebra. Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi was born around 780 and died around 850. He was known as a mathematician and an astronomer in the House of Wisdom,&lt;ref name="Al-Khalili2011" /&gt; and is also known for his book ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Kitab al-Jabr]]'' in which he develops a number of algorithms.&lt;ref name="Al-Khalili2011" /&gt; The application of the word  "algebra" to mathematics and the etymology of the word "algorithm" can be traced back to al-Khwarizmi — the actual concept of an algorithm dates back before the time of [[Euclidean algorithm|Euclid]]. The term 'algorithm' is derived from a Latin version of al-Khwarizmi's name which is 'Algorithmus'. He was instrumental in introducing the Arabs to Hindu numerals and algebra so he is known as "The Father of Algebra".&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalili 2011, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, al-Khwarizmi wrote about the astrolabe, sundial, and elaborated on Ptolemy's geometric model. Al-Khwarizmi is also known as the first geographer of Islam with his famous ''Picture of the Earth'' treatise. In ''Picture of the Earth'', he arranged the coordinates of hundreds of cities in the world at that time and gave instructions for drawing a new map of the world. George Sarton, one the most famous historians of science known for his book, ''Introduction to the History of Science'', called the period between 800 and 850 AD "The Time of al-Khwarizmi".&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalili 2011, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Besides that, this mathematician is responsible for the introduction of the Hindu decimal system to the Arab world, and through it to Europe. [[Al-Kindi]] also made important breakthroughs in cryptanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalili 2011, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; In al-Khwarizmi's early career, he proposed ideas towards the Hindu astronomical tables known as Sindhind. As a result, Caliph Al-Ma'mun sought al-Khwarizmi out to work on the science of equations.&lt;ref name="Arndt1983"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. B. Arndt|title=Al-Khwarizmi|journal=The Mathematics Teacher|date=December 1983|volume=76|issue=9|page=668|jstor=27963784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu Yusuf Ya‘qub ibn Ishaq Al-Kindi was also another historical figure that worked at the House of Wisdom. He studied cryptanalysis but he was also a great mathematician. Al-Kindi is the most famous for being the first person to introduce Aristotle’s philosophy to the Arabic people. He fused Aristotle's philosophy with Islamic theology which created an intellectual platform for philosophers and theologians to debate over 400 years. A fellow expert on Aristotle was an East African descent named Abu Uthman al-Jahith who was born in Basra around 776 but he spent most of his life in Baghdad. Al-Ma’mun employed al-Jahith as a personal tutor for his children, but he had to dismiss him because al-Jahith was "Goggled-Eyed", i.e., he had wide, staring eyes which made him frightening to look at. Al-Jahith was one of the few Muslim scholars who was deeply concerned with biology. He wrote ''Book of Animals,'' which discusses the way animals adapt to their surroundings, similarly to Aristotle’s ''History of Animals''.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Jahiz, ''Kitab al-Haywān'', vol. 4 (Al-Matba’ah al-Hamīdīyah al-Misrīyah, Cairo, 1909), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, al-Jahith argued that animals like dogs, foxes, and wolves must have descended from a common ancestor because they shared similar characteristics and features such as four legs, fur, tail, and so on.

Mūsā ibn Shākir was an astrologer, and a friend of Caliph Harun al-Rashid's son, al-Ma'mun. His sons, collectively known as the [[Banū Mūsā]] (Sons of Moses), also contributed with their extensive knowledge of mathematics and astrology. When their father died, al-Ma'mun became their guardian. Between 813 and 833, the three brothers were successful in their works in science, engineering, and patronage.&lt;ref name="MuslimJHeritage2018"&gt;{{cite web|author1=FSTC|title=The Mechanics of Banu Musa in the Light of Modern System and Control Engineering|url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/mechanics-of-banu-musa|website=www.muslimheritage.com|publisher=Foundation for Science Technology and Civilisation (FSTC)|accessdate=25 April 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425131652/http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/mechanics-of-banu-musa#|archive-date=2018-04-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Abū Jaʿfar, Muḥammad ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir (before 803 – February 873), Abū al‐Qāsim, Aḥmad ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir (d. 9th century) and Al-Ḥasan ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir (d. 9th century) are widely known for their [[Book of Ingenious Devices]], which describes about one hundred devices and how to use them. Among these was "The Instrument that Plays by Itself", the earliest example of a programmable machine,&lt;ref name=Koetsier&gt;Koetsier&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} as well as the Book on Measurement of Plane and Spherical Figures. Mohammad Musa and his brothers [[Ahmad ibn Musa|Ahmad]] and [[al-Hasan ibn Musa|Hasan]] contributed to Baghdad's astronomical observatories under the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun, in addition to the House of Wisdom research.&lt;ref name="TrimbleWilliams2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Josep Casulleras|editors=Virginia Trimble, Thomas R. Williams, Katherine Bracher, Richard Jarrell, Jordan D. Marché, F. Jamil Ragep|title=Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-BF1CHkc50C&amp;pg=PA92|date=18 September 2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-30400-7|pages=92–93|chapter=Banū Mūsā}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having shown much potential, the brothers were enrolled in the library and translation center of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad. They began translating ancient Greek into Arabic after quickly mastering the language, as well as paying large sums to obtain manuscripts from the [[Byzantine Empire]] for translation.&lt;ref name="Masood2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ehsan Masood|title=Science &amp; Islam: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H9yeHB1A-JwC&amp;pg=PA161|date=5 November 2009|publisher=Icon Books Limited|isbn=978-1-84831-160-2|pages=161–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also made many original contributions to astronomy and physics. [[Mohammed Jafar ibn Musa|Mohammad Musa]] might have been the first person in history to point to the universality of the laws of physics.&lt;ref name="Al-Khalili2011" /&gt; In the 10th century, [[Alhazen|Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) performed several physical experiments, mainly in optics, achievements still celebrated today.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalili 2011, pp.152–171&lt;/ref&gt;

In medicine, [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq|Hunayn]] wrote an important treatise on ophthalmology. Other scholars also wrote on smallpox, infections and surgery. Note that these works would later become standard textbooks of medicine during the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Moore&lt;/ref&gt;

Under al-Mamun's leadership science saw for the first time wide-ranging research projects involving large groups of scholars. In order to check Ptolemy's observations, the caliph ordered the construction of the first astronomical observatory in Baghdad (see [[#Observatories|Observatories section]] below). The data provided by Ptolemy was meticulously checked and revised by a highly capable group of geographers, mathematicians and astronomers.&lt;ref name="Lyons"/&gt; Al-Mamun also organized research on the circumference of the Earth and commissioned a geographic project that would result in one of the most detailed world-maps of the time. Some consider these efforts the first examples of large state-funded research projects.&lt;ref name="AK5"&gt;Al-Khalili, pp. 79-92&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Observatories ===
The creation of the first astronomical observatory in the Islamic world was ordered by caliph al-Mamun in 828 in Baghdad. The construction was directed by scholars from the House of Wisdom: senior astronomer Yahya ibn abi Mansur and the younger Sanad ibn Ali al-Alyahudi.&lt;ref&gt;Hockey 1249&lt;/ref&gt; It was located in al-Shammasiyya and was called Maumtahan Observatory. After the first round of observations of Sun, Moon and the planets, a second observatory on [[Mount Qasioun]], near Damascus, was constructed. The results of this endeavor were compiled in a work known as al-Zij al-Mumtahan, which translates as "The Verified Tables".&lt;ref name="AK5"&gt;Al-Khalili, pp. 79-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zaimeche"&gt;Zaimeche, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only did the Muslims in this era build observatories but soon after in Central Asia, they built a paper mill, which then led to the production of dyes, inks, glues, and even book bindings.

== Dispute ==
The existence of the House of Wisdom is presently disputed, as is its form and function. Arabist [[Dimitri Gutas]] posits in his 1998 book that "House of Wisdom" is a translation error from ''Khizanat al-Hikma'', which he asserts simply means a storehouse, and that there are few sources from the era during the Abbasid Era that mention the House of Wisdom by the name ''Bayt al-Hikma.''&lt;ref name="Gutas1998" /&gt; This theory is debatable, owing to the destruction of the [[Round city of Baghdad]] and conflicting sources in both academic texts and poetry.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Science, and Technology in Islam|last=Lyons|first=Jonathan|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=|editor-last=Kalin|editor-first=Ibrahim|volume=|location=Oxford|pages=|chapter=Bayt al-Hikmah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It is likely, given the Abbasid Caliphs' patronage of the arts and sciences, that an extensive library existed in Baghdad, and that scholars could have access to such texts, judging by the volume of work produced by scholars centered in Baghdad.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Without consistent naming conventions, a physical ruin, or corroborating texts, the phrase "House of Wisdom" may just as well have been a metaphor for the larger Academic community in Baghdad rather than a physical academy specializing in translation work.&lt;ref name="Gutas1998" /&gt;

== Other Houses of Wisdom ==

Some other places have also been called ''House of Wisdom'', and should not be confused with Baghdad's Bayt al-Hikma:

* In [[Cairo]], ''[[Dar al-Hikma (Iraqi publishing house)|Dar al-Hikmah]]'', the "House of Wisdom", was another name of the [[House of Knowledge]], founded by the Fatimid Caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] in 1004.&lt;ref name="Al-Khalili2011" /&gt; Included in this House of knowledge was a library that had a collection so vast, it was known as a "Wonder of the world".
* There is a research institute in Baghdad called ''Bayt al-Hikma'' after the Abbasid-era research center. While the complex includes a 13th-century [[madrasa]], it is not the same building as the medieval ''Bayt al-Hikma''. It was damaged during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] {{Coord|33.3423|N|44.3836|E|scale:1250}}. The House of Wisdom was similar to that of the present day [[British Library]] in [[London]] or the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|National Library]] in [[Paris]].
* The main library at [[Hamdard University]] in Karachi, Pakistan is called [[Bait al hikmat|'Bait al Hikmah']].
*  International [[NGO]] based in France, ''La Maison de Sagesse''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maison-de-sagesse.org/qui-sommes-nous.php La Maison de Sagesse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218204740/http://www.maison-de-sagesse.org/qui-sommes-nous.php |date=2016-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lemauricien.com/article/prix-international-memoire-la-democratie-et-la-paix-2016-la-maison-la-sagesse-preselectionne|title=PRIX INTERNATIONAL MÉMOIRE POUR LA DÉMOCRATIE ET LA PAIX 2016 : La Maison de la Sagesse présélectionnée  {{!}} Le Mauricien|website=www.lemauricien.com|language=fr|access-date=2017-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913230746/http://www.lemauricien.com/article/prix-international-memoire-la-democratie-et-la-paix-2016-la-maison-la-sagesse-preselectionne#|archive-date=2017-09-13|dead-url=no|df=|date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 2, launch of the activities of the House of Wisdom ([[Fez-Granada]]) in [[Fez]], [[Morocco]], by cardinal Barbarin and its founder, Khal Torabully, with the Executive Committee, with a view of reactualizing its spirit and mission in the 21st century, Lancement des activités de la Maison de la Sagesse Fès-Grenade à son siège social, le Palais Shéréhézade à Fès, le 2 novembre, par le Cardinal Barbarin, en présence de son fondateur Khal Torabully et le bureau http://www.courrierdesafriques.net/2016/11/le-cardinal-barbarin-a-fes-lancement-des-activites-de-la-maison-de-la-sagesse

* Programme of THE NEW SILK AND CONVIVENCIA ROUTES, FEZ, MOROCCO : http://www.courrierdesafriques.net/2018/02/maison-de-la-sagesse-fes-grenade-fes-a-lheure-chinoise-sur-les-nouvelles-routes-de-la-soie-et-de-la-convivencia
* Signature of a Memorandum of Understanding between the House of Wisdom of Fez-Granada and the International Institute for Central Asia Studies, on March 31, 18, at Samarkand. The IICAS is a UNESCO organization regrouping 10 countries on the Silk Routes and this MOU links the House of Wisdom to Central Asia for further developments regarding the humanities and diversities on the Silk Routes.

* The [[Library of Alexandria|Royal Library of Alexandria]] is located in Alexandria, Egypt. In the ancient world, it was once known as not only the most significant library but also the largest. The library was created by Ptolemy I Soter and its construction was done in the 3rd century BC and the library was dedicated to [[Muses]], the nine goddesses of the arts. After many years of accumulating scrolls adding up to anywhere from 40,000 to 400,000 the library was burned down. This caused the loss of many important scrolls and cultural knowledge.
* Located in the Byzantine Empire and founded by Constantius II, The [[Imperial Library of Constantinople]] was famously known as last of the great ancient libraries. It housed a lot of knowledge of the Greek and Roman people. This library also experienced fires throughout its lifetime ending with the final destruction during the conquering by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Most of the classical Greek work that we know today is originally from this library. 
* The [[School of Nisibis]] was founded in 350 and was located in what is known as present-day Turkey. This was a spiritual center that had three primary departments, theology, philosophy, and medicine.

==History==
JSTOR was founded in 1995 under the direction of current ITHAKA president Kevin M. Guthrie. Guthrie also served as the founding president of ITHAKA in 2004.&lt;ref name="Guthrie Bio"/&gt; Both organizations were initially funded by grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The two organizations announced that they would merge in 2009 after years of working together closely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/Digest/JSTOR-and-Ithaka-Merge-52456.asp|website=Info Today|title=Archived copy|access-date=2015-01-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410122508/http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/Digest/JSTOR-and-Ithaka-Merge-52456.asp|archive-date=2015-04-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The organizations stated that the merger was "a natural progression" and that they would work together to help "academic institutions use digital technology to enhance scholarship and teaching and reduce system-wide costs through collective action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=JSTOR, Ithaka join forces |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-197106559.html |newspaper=[[Information Today]] |date=April 1, 2009 |accessdate=January 19, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==

===JSTOR===
[[JSTOR]] is a major database of academic research materials, with content that includes books, journals, and primary sources. 

===Portico===
Portico was created by JSTOR in 2002 as the ''Electronic-Archiving Initiative''. It was transferred to ITHAKA in 2004. Portico operates as a "'dim' archive for [[e-journal]] content" that stores information from scholarly journals so it cannot be lost, an example being when the part of it housing the ''Graft: Organ and Cell Transplantation'' journal was "lit up" and became publicly accessible after access to that journal's website was removed by its publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Portico's "Dim" E-Archive Lights Up with Member Access to Graft |first=Andrew |last=Albanese |url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2008/03/ljarchives/porticos-dim-e-archive-lights-up/ |newspaper=[[Library Journal]] |date=December 5, 2007 |accessdate=January 19, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407171203/http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2008/03/ljarchives/porticos-dim-e-archive-lights-up/ |archive-date=April 7, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Portico generated $5.7 million in revenue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Ithaka S+R===
Ithaka S+R is a research and consulting service that releases public research reports and offers consulting services to libraries, publishers, scholarly societies, universities, and other non-profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sr.ithaka.org/clientservices|title="Our Services"|publisher=Ithaka S+R|access-date=2015-01-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215010013/http://sr.ithaka.org/clientservices|archive-date=2015-02-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ithaka S+R conducts triennial surveys of faculty members and library directors in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/03/11/survey-university-libraries-finds-diversity-developing-institutional-type|title=Beyond eBooks|date=13 March 2014|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|last1=Straumsheim|first1=Carl|accessdate=13 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202044643/https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/03/11/survey-university-libraries-finds-diversity-developing-institutional-type|archive-date=2 February 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/04/11/interesting-findings-from-ithaka-srs-latest-faculty-survey/|title=Interesting Findings from Ithaka S&amp;R’s Latest Faculty Survey|date=11 April 2013|publisher=Scholarly Kitchen|last1=Anderson|first1=Rick|accessdate=13 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915073705/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/04/11/interesting-findings-from-ithaka-srs-latest-faculty-survey/|archive-date=15 September 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Ithaka S+R generated $1.2 million in revenue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Awards==
The same year that Ithaka Harbors obtained ''Portico'', the [[Library of Congress]] gave a $3 million [[NDIIPP]] grant to the company for it to "develop, test, and operate one or more electronic archives for electronic journals", along with providing "long-term access to those journals". The endeavor was known as the ''Portico Project''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Library of Congress]] |first= |authorlink= |title=Annual Report of the Librarian of Congress |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AtvgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Ithaka+Harbors%22&amp;dq=%22Ithaka+Harbors%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R2b6UKfkL6Tg2gWAwYCQDA&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBTgK |accessdate=January 19, 2013 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |location= |isbn= |page=110 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]] named Ithaka Harbors as one of the four recipients of their 2008 Digital Partnership grant awards. The company was chosen because of its ''Protecting Future Access Now: Developing a Prototype Preservation Model for Digital Books'' project, which is meant to be a "prototype preservation service that will provide a practical model for the preservation of digitized books."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=National Endowment for the Humanities, Institute of Museum and Library Services award Advancing Knowledge Digital Partnership grants |author= |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1542341671.html |newspaper=[[US Federal News]] |date=August 26, 2008 |accessdate=January 19, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ithaka Harbors received federal contract awards in 2010 and 2011. The former was $75,000 given by the [[US Department of Labor]] for their "Archived E-jornal Collections".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Contract Award: Ithaka Harbors Wins Federal Contract for "Archived E-jornal Collections" |author= |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2112972081.html |newspaper=[[US Federal News]] |date=August 18, 2010 |accessdate=January 19, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, the [[Department of the Army]] awarded $17,000 for collection additions of "books, maps and other publications".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Contract Award: Ithaka Harbors Wins Federal Modification Contract for Books, Maps and Other Publications |author= |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2545794021.html |newspaper=[[US Federal News]] |date=December 23, 2011 |accessdate=January 19, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joanna Evans''' (also '''Hartman''') is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'', played by [[Emma Harrison]]. Joanna was introduced as the younger half-sister of established character, [[Annalise Hartman]] ([[Kimberley Davies]]). She made her first on screen appearance on 26 May 1995. Following Davies' departure from ''Neighbours'' in 1996, rumours began that Harrison's character would be written out of the show. However, the actress signed a new long-term contract with ''Neighbours'' a few months later. In February 1997, producers decided to write Joanna out of the show. A reporter for the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' said Harrison was written out due to rows with the producers over her poor acting. Joanna departed on screen on 15 April 1997. In 2005, Harrison was invited to return to ''Neighbours'' for the 20th anniversary episode, but she did not appear.

Joanna comes to [[Erinsborough]] to meet Annalise and introduce her to their father, Tony ([[Michael Carman]]). The sisters display different personalities; Annalise is high maintenance, while Joanna is uncomplicated and down to earth. The author of ''Neighbours: the first 10 years'' said Joanna was vacuous and branded her as bright as a glowworm. Writers for the ''Daily Mirror'' called her glamorous and said she was as just as stunning as her sister. Joanna and Annalise set up their own public relations company, but their first client turns out to be a con man. Joanna's next job was as an aerobics instructor. She followed this with a stint as co-owner of the Chez Chez bar. Joanna has a brief relationship with her sister's ex-fiancé, [[Mark Gottlieb]] ([[Bruce Samazan]]), before marrying Rob Evans ([[Graham Harvey (actor)|Graham Harvey]]). Joanna splits from Rob for a short time when she realises their marriage is loveless, but she decides to leave Erinsborough to reunite with him.

==Creation and casting==
When Harrison auditioned for a role on ''Neighbours'', she was unaware the character she was reading for was [[Annalise Hartman]]'s ([[Kimberley Davies]]) long lost sister, Joanna.&lt;ref name="SupermodelStandIn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/I+was+a+supermodel's+stand-in%3B+INTERVIEW%3A+Emma+Harrison.-a061306423|title=I was a supermodel's stand-in; Interview: Emma Harrison|date=16 October 1996|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison told the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', "I was thrilled – and doubly excited when I read the script that had me stealing her TV boyfriend. That was a real bonus."&lt;ref name="SupermodelStandIn"/&gt; The character of Joanna was Harrison's first major television role, following a successful modelling career.&lt;ref name="SupermodelStandIn"/&gt; She relocated from Queensland to Melbourne for the part.&lt;ref name="Happy"&gt;{{cite journal|date=10–23 August 1996|title=Happy days are here again!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=55|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joanna was introduced as a replacement for Davies' character, but Harrison said she was determined "not to become a Kimberley clone."&lt;ref name="SupermodelStandIn"/&gt; The actress revealed it took ten months for her to feel comfortable in her new role and she said "When you start in a show like this, where everyone is very busy, you have to make your mark quickly. It's a case of sink or swim."&lt;ref name="Blonde"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Blonde+ambition.-a061282617|title=Blonde ambition|date=28 November 1996|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Davies' departure from the show, rumours circulated that Harrison and her character would be written out of the show. However, the actress signed a new long-term contract with ''Neighbours''.&lt;ref name="SignsOn"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herbison|first=Jason|date=6–19 April 1996|title=Emma signs on|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=Attic Futura (UK) Ltd|issue=46|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1997, producers told Harrison they were writing her out of ''Neighbours''.&lt;ref name="Axe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NEIGHBOURS+AXE+%60USELESS'+EMMA%3B+TV+beauty+in+bad-acting+row.-a061105622|title=Neighbours axe 'useless' Emma; TV beauty in bad-acting row|last=Hughes|first=Chris|date=24 February 1997|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Hughes of the ''Daily Mirror'' reported Harrison was written out due to rows with the producers, who claimed her acting was not good enough.&lt;ref name="Axe"/&gt; A show inside told Hughes, "She was called in to see the bosses and told that her acting was bad. They've always been harsh on models, but she had little ability and the role went to her head. When she started it was suggested she take acting lessons but after a while she stopped. She had decided she didn't need them any more. A lot of us felt she had become a prima donna."&lt;ref name="Axe"/&gt; In 2005, Harrison was invited back to ''Neighbours'' for the 20th anniversary episode, but she did not appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/news/a19419/host-of-neighbours-stars-tapped-to-return.html|title=Host of 'Neighbours' stars tapped to return|last=Wilkes|first=Neil|date=23 February 2005|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joanna is "uncomplicated", while Annalise is high maintenance.&lt;ref name="JH"/&gt; Joanna is also "down to earth" and Annalise becomes jealous of her sister's stable home life.&lt;ref name="JNeigbours"/&gt; Joanna was more accepting of their father's job as a female impersonator, but Annalise became embarrassed by it.&lt;ref name="JH"/&gt; Of Joanna's personality, Josephine Monore, author of ''Neighbours: the first 10 years'', said "Jo was even more vacuous than her blond looks would have you stereotype her. She was dizzy, forgetful and about as bright as a glowworm."&lt;ref&gt;Monroe, Josephine, p.37&lt;/ref&gt; Fiona Parker of the ''Daily Mirror'' said Joanna was "glamorous", while a colleague called her a siren and said she was as "equally-stunning" as her sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Rocking+on+Ramsay+St.-a061305962|title=Rocking on Ramsay St|last=Parker|first=Fiona|date=19 October 1996|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Who's+the+Queen+of+the+soaps%3F%3B+Meet+the+hot+contenders.-a061116643|title=Who's the Queen of the soaps?|date=11 January 1997|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Johnston, author of ''Neighbours: 20 years of Ramsay Street'', said Joanna was so "chirpy and over-helpful" that she drove everyone crazy.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Tony, p.185&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1996, Harrison commented on Joanna's development saying "When I started with ''Neighbours'' I came in as the little confused sister of Annalise but now Joanna Hartman is developing as a solid confident character."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=age&amp;kw=Emma+Harrison+and+Neighbours&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=entire&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=news960713_0234_4988|title=Backbeat|last=Tubb|first=Rochelle|date=13 July 1996|work=[[The Sun-Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said that she and Joanna were complete opposites. Harrison called her character "quite immature" and obsessed with men.&lt;ref name="Happy"/&gt;

===Career===
When Tony gives Joanna and Annalise some money, the sisters decide to set up their own public relations company from their living room.&lt;ref name="AnnaJo"&gt;{{cite journal|date=6–19 April 1996|title=Way to go, AnnaJo!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=Attic Futura (UK) Ltd|issue=46|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joanna and Annalise decide to combine their names and they call the company Anna-Jo Promotions. ''[[Inside Soap]]'' said the name was the best thing about the company.&lt;ref name="AnnaJo"/&gt; While Joanna has some experience promoting her father's act, Annalise does not know a lot about PR.&lt;ref name="AnnaJo"/&gt; However, the girls do attract a client, Roger Reynolds (Roger O'Connor), who asks Joanna and Annalise to get him some publicity for his magazine publishing business.&lt;ref name="AnnaJo"/&gt; Unbeknownst to the girls, Roger is a con man and he manages to cheat them out of everything they have. ''Inside Soap'' commented on the situation saying, "An experienced crook like Reynolds can sniff out easy targets like the Hartman sisters a mile away."&lt;ref name="AnnaJo"/&gt; The police tell the girls what has happened and they go undercover to catch Roger.&lt;ref name="AnnaJo"/&gt; After Anna-Jo Promotions comes to an end, Joanna takes a job as an aerobics instructor.&lt;ref name="Melinda"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=age&amp;kw=Emma+Harrison+and+Neighbours&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=entire&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=AGE0604274758T64TR0B|title=Street of Dreams|last=Houston|first=Melinda|date=27 April 2006|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is offered the position by the owner of the local fitness centre, Bruce Styles (Paul El Deir), who is impressed by her efforts.&lt;ref name="Happy"/&gt; Joanna later becomes a co-owner of Chez Chez with [[Cheryl Stark]] ([[Caroline Gillmer]]), a role which prompted a writer for the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' to comment "Joanna is thrilled to be part of Chez Chez - but proves to be anything but a silent partner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SOAP+BOX%3b+Anne+going+for+Curly's+blood.-a061045990|title=Soap Box; Anne going for Curly's blood|date=8 February 1997|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Joanna begins dating [[Mark Gottlieb]] ([[Bruce Samazan]]), which displeases Annalise as she was once engaged to him. Joanna becomes obsessed with Mark and he is forced to admit that their relationship is only a fling.&lt;ref name="JH"/&gt; Joanna eventually realises that the relationship is going nowhere and ends it.&lt;ref name="JH"/&gt; Joanna meets Rob Evans ([[Graham Harvey (actor)|Graham Harvey]]), a rich businessman, at an aerobics class.&lt;ref name="JH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melinda"/&gt; Rob sends Joanna a note and they get to know each other better, they then begin a relationship.&lt;ref name="Belles"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruben|first=Amanda|date=11 May 1996|title=Wedding Belles|journal=[[TV Week]]|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]|issue=45|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of Joanna and Rob, Harrison told Amanda Ruben of ''[[TV Week]]'' "It all happens very quickly, but Joanna is really drawn to Rob's energy and she thinks he's gorgeous. I think it's true love. She really does fall head over heels."&lt;ref name="Belles"/&gt; Joanna considers leaving Australia to work with her father in Asia, but when she realises she is in love with Rob, she turns the job down.&lt;ref name="MarryMe"&gt;{{cite journal|date=30 November – 13 December 1996|title=Marry me, Jo!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=Attic Futura (UK) Ltd|issue=63|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joanna worries about revealing her true feelings to Rob because she ruined her relationship with Mark by moving too quickly.&lt;ref name="MarryMe"/&gt; She decides to tell him about the job offer to see if he feels the same way about her, but she starts to feel like she has waited for too long for a reply. A writer for ''Inside Soap'' said "Jo's really shocked at Rob's indifference to the thought of her leaving and, in typical Jo style, she breaks down and blurts out all her feelings."&lt;ref name="MarryMe"/&gt;

Joanna flees from Rob in tears and prepares to leave and join her father abroad, but she then finds Rob on her doorstep begging for her hand in marriage.&lt;ref name="MarryMe"/&gt; Joanna accepts his proposal and she shocks everyone when she reveals she is engaged to Rob after only knowing him for a short time.&lt;ref name="Belles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MarryMe"/&gt; Joanna's visions of a "rosy future" are shattered when Rob reveals that he has been hiding something from her for a while. He explains that he had a vasectomy and cannot have children.&lt;ref name="MarryMe"/&gt; Despite setting her heart on having a family, Joanna stays with Rob and their wedding is "a beautiful, lavish affair", though it does not go without a hitch.&lt;ref name="Belles"/&gt; The gazebo that is being built for the ceremony is not finished in time and Joanna is not pleased with the dress [[Danni Stark]] ([[Eliza Szonert]]) has made for her. It is too revealing and not what Joanna wants at all.&lt;ref name="Belles"/&gt; Joanna and Rob are married on 21 June 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=age&amp;kw=Emma+Harrison+and+Neighbours&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=entire&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=news960608_0216_6807|title=Vow power|last=Southward|first=Jane|author2=Browne, Rachel|date=8 June 1996|work=[[The Sun-Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joanna leaves Rob when she realises their marriage is loveless, but she later decides to reunite with him.&lt;ref name="Axe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JH"/&gt;

==Storylines==
Joanna arrives in Erinsborough to meet Annalise Hartman. She reveals they are half-sisters, but Annalise does not believe her. She eventually realises Joanna is telling the truth and she tries to accept her. Annalise cancels her trip overseas to stay and get to know her sister. Joanna realises Annalise has not met their father, Tony, and she arranges for them to meet. Annalise is shocked that Tony is a female impersonator called "Tarquin Sequin" and Joanna becomes upset when her sister cannot see past her father's job. She begs Annalise to give him a chance, but Annalise is set against it as Tony had humiliated her in public. Joanna becomes desperate to get them to reconcile, as Tony plans to leave. She succeeds and Annalise makes friends with her father. Joanna then leaves with Tony.

Joanna later returns to Erinsborough to spend more time with Annalise. The sisters become close and after reading an article [[Libby Kennedy]] ([[Kym Valentine]]) has written about their father, the girls get revenge on her. Joanna and Annalise go into business together and call their company Anna-Jo Promotions. Joanna moves into Number 24 and gets off on the wrong foot with landlady [[Marlene Kratz]] (Moya O'Sullivan) and [[Cody Willis]] ([[Peta Brady]]). Joanna and Annalise's first client turns out to be a criminal and the police ask them to go undercover to catch him. Joanna begins dating Annalise's ex-fiancé, Mark Gottlieb. Joanna worries Mark still has feelings for Annalise, but he convinces her she is the only girl he is interested in. Joanna begins to get obsessed with Mark and her friends became worried for her. When Mark tells her their relationship is just a fling, Joanna breaks down and realises she needs help.

After her relationship with [[Sam Kratz]] ([[Richard Grieve]]) ends, Annalise leaves Erinsborough for good. Joanna is sad when she is left behind, but she helps [[Stonefish Rebecchi]] (Anthony Engelman) get into a Performance Arts course at University and finds employment at the gym as an aerobics instructor. Joanna meets Rob Evans and he employs her as his personal trainer. They begin a relationship and Rob proposes to Joanna. Joanna asks Danni Stark to make her wedding dress, but she is horrified at the result. Joanna becomes difficult and unpleasant to be around and she later realises she has let the wedding plans get on top of her. She asks Danni to make her another dress and she is delighted when Rob arranges for Tony to return for the wedding. Following the wedding, Joanna becomes disappointed in married life. She dislikes Rob going away on business all the time and she decides to become a silent partner in Chez Chez. Rob returns and tells Joanna they are moving to Europe because of his job. Joanna says goodbye to her friends and leaves.

Joanna returns a few months later and announces she and Rob have broken up. [[Luke Handley]] ([[Bernard Curry]]) allows Joanna to move into Number 30. She goes on a date with [[Malcolm Kennedy]] ([[Benjamin McNair]]), but he realises they have nothing in common and he tells her he is not interested in pursuing a relationship with her. [[Lou Carpenter]] ([[Tom Oliver]]) purchases Joanna's shares in Chez Chez and Joanna decides to invest in [[Debbie Martin]]'s ([[Marnie Reece-Wilmore]]) coffee shop. Joanna also turns her attentions to Lou's used car business. Joanna and Rob's love letters are made public and Joanna decides to contact her husband. The next day, Joanna leaves Erinsborough to reunite with Rob.

'''John Eliot, Ph.D''' is a [[professor]] who teaches [[Organizational and Performance Psychology]], [[Leadership]], and [[Ethics]].  Currently at Texas A&amp;M University, he has also held appointments at the [[University of Virginia]], [[Rice University]], SMU's [[Cox School of Business]], and [[Stanford]].  His courses are perennial campus favorites.

Eliot is also a bestselling author, with top titles including "Overachievement" and "Help the Helper".  Using field research and case studies, he debunks some of the misunderstandings that pop-psychology creates regarding tools such as goal setting and stress management.  He advocates that success generally stems from developing sound and consistent philosophies, self-evaluation measures, perspective, confidence, and trust.

'''King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi''' ('''KMUTT''', {{lang-th|มหาวิทยาลัยเทคโนโลยีพระจอมเกล้าธนบุรี; {{RTGS|''maha witthayalai theknoloyi phrachomklao thonburi''}} ) or colloquially "Bangmot" ({{lang-th|บางมด}}; {{rtgs|''bang mot''}} ) is a engineering and technology university in [[Thailand]], focusing on teaching and research. It is one of nine national research universities (NRU) in [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fact Sheet |url=http://global.kmutt.ac.th/about/fact-sheet |website=King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT)|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in Bang Mot Sub-district, [[Thung Khru District]], [[Bangkok]]. It was founded on 18 April 1960, making it the third oldest engineering school and seventh oldest university in [[Thailand]].{{CN|date=August 2018}}

==History==
King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi can trace its origin to the Thonburi Technical College (TTC) which was established on 4 February 1960, by the Department of Vocational Education, Ministry of Education. TTC had the mission of training technicians, technical instructors, and technologists. By virtue of the Technology Act, enacted 21 April 1971, three technical institutes are under the Department of Vocational Education: Thonburi Technical Institute (TTI), North Bangkok Technical Institute, and Nonthaburi Telecommunication Institute. They were combined to form one degree-granting institution under the name King Mongkut's Institute of Technology (KMIT) spread across three campuses. TTC thus became KMIT Thonburi campus. In 1974, KMIT was transferred from the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of University Affairs.{{Citation needed|date = May 2015}}

A new technology act was enacted 19 February 1986: the three campuses of KMIT became three autonomous institutes, each having university status. KMIT Thonburi campus became King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Thonburi (KMITT).

KMITT purchased {{Convert|460|acres|km2}} of land to expand the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = KMUTT Ratchaburi Learning Park|url = http://global.kmutt.ac.th/campus/ratchaburi-campus|website = global.kmutt.ac.th|accessdate = 2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Koofers''' is a private company, founded in 2008 and headquartered in [[Reston, VA]] (a part of the [[Washington, DC]] metropolitan area). Koofers is an interactive community that serves the academic needs of college students through information sharing. All college students have access to the service by creating an account with their e-mail address. Many of Koofers' services span the entire academic calendar from course selection through final exams, and include interactive flashcards, course &amp; instructor ratings, professors’ grading histories, and an online library for sharing past exams &amp; study materials.

'''Koofers.com''' is a free service to all students and faculty at colleges and universities worldwide.

==History of the Word "Koofer"==
The term “[[koofer]]” originated&lt;ref name=koofersoriginated&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alumni.vt.edu/traditions/index.htm | title=Virginia Tech Traditions - coofer|accessdate=2010-05-26| publisher=Virginia Tech Alumni Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1940s at [[Bluefield College]], a former extension branch of [[Virginia Tech]], and was likely derived from the word “coffer” (synonym for a strongbox). It is often used as a verb in such constructions as “to coofer a problem,” also sometimes spelled “koofer.” A student from Bluefield College transferred to the Virginia Tech and first introduced the term there. The term then began to refer to tests or homework completed in an earlier course that is made available to students taking the course later, and used for studying or preparing.

Koofers.com took it a step further and re-branded the term “koofers” to refer to all previously used/administered college-level, academic information or data that can help students with their courses (i.e. exams, study guides, ratings, grade distributions, etc.).

==Company history==
Koofers.com was created in 2006 by [then] Virginia Tech students Michael Rihani and Patrick Gartlan, along with Virginia Tech alumnus Glynn LoPresti. Their vision was to enable students to make the, relatively opaque, process of class and teacher selection fully transparent, by providing grading histories and professor reviews to help students shape their class schedules, based on their individual needs and learning styles (e.g., “I am fine with exams, but I hate teachers who give tons of quizzes”).

The reaction from its alpha deployment at Virginia Tech, coupled with positive feedback from a quick pilot during the last week of a Spring term at the University of Maryland, lead to a nationwide launch in the Fall of 2009. Today Koofers.com continues to launch at more higher-education schools and grow its products and services each semester.

The '''Korean Mathematical Olympiad''' is a [[List of mathematics competitions|Mathematical Olympiad]] held by the Korean Mathematical Society (KMS) in [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]].

== History ==
In 1988, only high school students were tested and middle school students were supposed to take the 'high school exam'. From the 11th exam,{{when?|date=May 2017}} the middle school students' test was introduced (JKMO, Junior Korean Mathematical Olympiad). In the 53rd International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), the Korean delegation won 209 out of 252 out of the total score and 6 gold medals and ranked the first place for the first time in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www2/common/search.asp|title=The Korea Times|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then, Korean mathematicians have made outstanding achievements in advanced math research and International Mathematical Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2014/08/137_163052.html|title=Korean Times|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business Background ==
In order to obtain excellent grades in the International Mathematics Olympiad, the Korean Mathematical Society holds the Korean Mathematical Olympiad, and through the operation of the seasonal school, KMS will discover gifted students and educate them to contribute the development of mathematics, science, and engineering in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kmo.or.kr/imo/sub01.html|title=The Korean Mathematical Olympiad|website=www.kmo.or.kr|language=ko|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==

=== The Primary Test ===
The primary test, usually called PKMO, is held between May and June. The current test consists of twenty multiple-choice questions, and students have to take the test in 4 hours and 30 minutes. The trend is to present five problems from each subject, which are [[number theory]], [[geometry]], [[algebra]], and [[combinatorics]]. The awards are divided into regional and national awards, and they are divided into honorable mention, bronze award, silver award, and gold award. To take the second test, students must receive the bronze award or higher.

=== Summer School ===
Students who have a good score in PKMO can have the opportunity to attend in the summer school. It is held between July and August, and the students sleep together for 12 days and take lectures.

=== Autumn Communication Lecture ===
Students who have completed Summer School are subjected to the Summer Communication Lecture. They have weekly online training and performance assessments.

=== The Secondary Test ===
The secondary test is composed of 8 questions with a narrative type. It is usually held between November and December. The test is divided in morning and afternoon time and 4 problems are given each period with a time limit of 3 hours. The trend is to present two problems from number theory, geometry, algebra, and combinatorics each. Local awards are not awarded separately and are divided into honorable mention, bronze award, silver award, and gold award.

=== Winter School ===
Students who have a good grade in the second test is entitled to attend winter school. It is progressed for 2 weeks in early January. Every weekend, there is a Winter School Mock Examination which is similar to FKMO. It is reflected in the selection of the national team. On the days without exams, there is a professor’s lecture in morning, assistant’s problem-solving in the noon, and self-study in evening. If a student gets enough grades in the winter school mock examination, he or she will be exempted for PKMO next year.

=== Spring Communication Lecture ===
Students who have completed Winter School are subjected to the Spring Communication Lecture for 6 weeks. They have weekly online training and performance assessments.

=== Asia Pacific Olympiad (APMO) ===
APMO is held in March. Winter School Participants are subjected to take the test. There are 5 problems in the exam, and the awards are divided into honorable mention, bronze award, silver award, and gold award. Only up to 10 people can get an award in this exam.  

=== The Final Test (FKMO) ===
The students who have won higher than the bronze prize in the High School Level Secondary Test or those who have completed the Middle School Level Winter School are entitled to take FKMO. The exam consists of 6 questions in a narrative form. It is taken for two days at the end of March, and each day you are required to solve 3 problems in 4 hours and 30 minutes. Awards are divided into Grand Prize, Excellence Prize, and Encouragement Prize, and 13 people are selected as representative candidates. Six students are selected from the candidates to represent Korea in the IMO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kmo.or.kr/main.html|title=KMO official website(click the button on the left bottom('연간계획'))|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gauss Part and Euler Part ==
Since 2017, KMO has been divided into two parts: [[Gauss]] Part and [[Euler]] Part. The Gauss Part is open to all students under the age of 20 and the Euler Part is available for high school students other than science high school students.

== Final representative selection process ==
About 12 to 13 students are selected based on the grades obtained by multiplying the grades of five tests (KMO second test, Romanian Master of Mathematics, winter school mock test, APMO, and KMO final exam) by the weights set by the Korea Math Olympiad Committee. IMO mock test is conducted for these 12 students. Six finalists will be selected by the Korea Mathematics Olympiad Committee based on the results of combining the results of the tests held before and the results of this IMO mock test. The final candidates and the target students will perform the weekend training for about 5 weeks in May, and the final representative student will hold the intensive training before the participation in IMO, which is held from June to July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kmo.or.kr/imo/sub01.html|title=The Korean Mathematical Olympiad|website=www.kmo.or.kr|language=ko|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|State of equilibrium between buoyancy and weight of a fully immersed object}}
'''Neutral buoyancy''' is a condition in which a physical body's average [[density]] is equal to the density of the fluid in which it is immersed. The buoyancy offsets the force of gravity that would otherwise cause the object to [[wikt:sink|sink]] (if the body's density is greater than the density of the fluid in which it is immersed) or rise (if it's less). An object that has neutral buoyancy will neither sink nor rise.
[[File:Principio di Archimede spinta e peso.png|thumb|Balance of forces on objects with negative, neutral and positive buoyancy]]
[[File:Diver trimmed level.png|thumb|A neutrally buoyant diver does not need to fin to maintain depth]]
In [[scuba diving]], the ability to maintain neutral [[buoyancy]] through controlled breathing, accurate weighting, and management of the buoyancy compensator is an important skill. A scuba diver maintains neutral buoyancy by continuous correction, usually by controlled breathing, as neutral buoyancy is an unstable condition for a compressible object in a liquid.

==History==
The mathematician [[Archimedes]] discovered much of how buoyancy works more than 2000 years ago. In his research, Archimedes discovered that an object is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the water displaced by the object. In other words, an inflatable boat that displaces 100 pounds (45 kilograms) of water is buoyed up by that same weight of support. An object that floats in the water is known as being ''positively'' buoyant. An object that sinks to the bottom is ''negatively'' buoyant, while an object that hovers at the same level in the water is ''neutrally'' buoyant. Scientists later discovered ways to manipulate buoyancy and developed equipment such as the [[life jacket]], which is filled with compressed air and helps to lower a person's average density, assisting in floating and swimming, as well as certain diving equipment (including [[submarines]] and [[submersibles]]) which have air chambers similar to [[swim bladder]]s to regulate depth.

==Uses==
Buoyancy is important in a large number of fields. Boats, [[ship]]s and [[seaplane]]s are [[engineering|engineered]] in a way that ensures that they remain afloat. [[Submarine]]s have controllable buoyancy to make them submerse and rise on demand. Many objects were developed with buoyancy in mind, such as [[Personal flotation device|life preservers]] and [[Float (nautical)|pontoons]].

Buoyancy is essential to most [[water sports]]. Many [[human swimming|swimmers]] know that there are easy ways to float at the surface, such as lying on one's back or holding a full breath. Buoyancy becomes noticeable when a swimmer tries to dive to the bottom of the pool, which can take effort. Scuba divers work with many buoyancy issues, as divers must know how to float, hover and sink in the water. Scuba divers often wear lead weights to counteract the positive buoyancy of their bodies and gear.

===Microgravity simulation===
{{main|Neutral buoyancy simulation as a training aid|Neutral buoyancy pool}}
Neutral buoyancy is used extensively in training [[astronaut]]s in preparation for working in the [[microgravity]] environment of space. [[NASA]] and the [[Russian Federal Space Agency|Russian space program]] maintain facilities in which [[spacesuit|suited]] astronaut trainees interact with mock-up space hardware, with the assistance of scuba divers. At the University of Maryland's [[Space Systems Laboratory]], a neutral buoyancy tank is similarly used to evaluate the performance of prototype space robots.

When neutral buoyancy is taking place, it appears as though the object/substance is floating in the middle of the fluid, or somewhere in between the bottom and the surface.

==Appearance in nature==
A [[fish]]'s [[swim bladder]] controls buoyancy by adjusting the amount of gas in the swim bladder, allowing it to achieve neutral buoyancy at different depths. When a fish's overall density becomes higher or lower than the surrounding water due volume change of the swim bladder following ascent or descent, it can correct this difference over time by a physiological process involving controlled absorption and elimination of gases via the blood circulation, the gills, and a gland adjacent to the swim bladder.

The human brain exhibits approximately neutral buoyancy as a result of its suspension in [[cerebrospinal fluid]].  The actual mass of the human brain is about 1400&amp;nbsp;grams; however the net weight of the brain suspended in the CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25&amp;nbsp;grams. The brain therefore exists in nearly neutral buoyancy, which allows the brain to maintain its density without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill neurons in the lower sections.

{{Nihongo|'''Nihonjin gakkō'''|日本人学校|''Nihonjin gakkō''}}, also called '''Japanese school''', is a full-day school outside [[Japan]] for native speakers of [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. It is an [[expatriate]] school designed for children whose parents are working on diplomatic, business, or education missions overseas and have plans to repatriate to Japan.

The schools offer exactly the same curriculum used in public [[Elementary school in Japan|elementary]] and [[Secondary education in Japan#Lower Secondary School (Junior High School)|middle school]]s in Japan, so when the students go back to Japan, they will not fall behind in the class. Some schools accept Japanese [[Citizenship|citizen]]s only; others welcome Japanese speaking students regardless of citizenship.

They are accredited by Japan's [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of education and science]] and receive funding from the Japanese government. Every school has teachers transferred from Japan on a two- to three-year assignment. They hire {{clarify|text=locals|date=January 2016}} as Japanese-speaking teachers, English and other language instructors, administrative assistants, gardeners, janitors and security guards. There were 85 schools worldwide as of April 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/shotou/clarinet/f_sijo22.html 在外教育施設の概要]&lt;/ref&gt; and all of these schools provide English classes in the primary education.

Schools that partially offer the nihonjin gakkō's curriculum after school hours or on weekends are sometimes called Japanese Schools, too, but strictly speaking they are categorized as ''[[hoshū jugyō kō]]'' or ''hoshūkō'', a supplementary school.

==History==
[[File:SJSPudong0.jpg|thumb|The [[Shanghai Japanese School]] (Pudong Campus pictured) is the only ''nihonjin gakkō'' in the world that  offers senior high school classes]]
Some of the ''nihonjin gakkō'' in [[Asia]] have a long history, originally established as public schools in the Japan-occupied territories in [[Thailand]], [[Philippines]], and [[Taiwan]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

As Japan recovered after [[World War II]], increased numbers of Japanese international schools serving elementary and junior high school levels opened around the world.&lt;ref name=Iwasakip24&gt;Iwasaki, Toshio.

"The number of overseas elementary and junior high schools for Japanese children has increased in postwar years in parallel with the growth of the Japanese economy and the surge in the number of Japanese corporate employees dispatched abroad. However, there was no senior Japanese high school outside Japan until Rikkyo School in England was founded in 1972 in the suburbs of London. It remained the only overseas Japanese senior high school for the next 14 years."&lt;/ref&gt; The first postwar Japanese overseas school was the [[Japanese School of Bangkok]], which opened in 1956.&lt;ref name=Fukudap216&gt;{{ca icon}} Fukuda, Makiko.

The [[Ministry of Education (Japan)|Ministry of Education of Japan]], as of 1985, encouraged the development of ''nihonjin gakkō'', in [[developing countries]], while it encouraged the opening of ''[[hoshū jugyō kō]]'', or part-time supplementary schools, in [[developed countries]]. However, some Japanese parents in developed countries, in addition to those in developing countries, campaigned for the opening of ''nihonjin gakkō'' in developed countries due to concern about the education of their children.&lt;ref name=Goodmanp179&gt;Goodman, Roger.

"Official policy (see Monbusho, 1985) was that Nihonjingakko should be set up in developing countries, hoshuko in the developed world."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, there were 22 ''nihonjin gakkō'' worldwide.&lt;ref name=Goodmanp179/&gt; During the [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|postwar rapid economic growth]] in 1950s to early 1970s and [[Japanese asset price bubble]] in 1980s, the country gained economic power and many [[sogo shosha]]s and major industries sent their employees all over the world. That was when many ''nihonjin gakko'' were established to educate their children in Asia, [[Europe]], [[Middle East]], [[North America|North]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The number of ''nihonjin gakkō'' increased to 80 in 1986 with the opening of Japanese schools in [[Colegio Japonés de Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[Japanese School of Melbourne|Melbourne]]. As of May of that year 968 teachers originating in Japan were teaching at these Japanese schools worldwide. That month 15,811 students were enrolled in those schools.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/other/bluebook/1987/1987-8-4.htm Section 4.

In the early 1980s, 40% of Japanese national children living in Europe attended ''nihonjin gakkō'', while almost 95% of Japanese national children living abroad in Asia attended ''nihonjin gakkō''.&lt;ref name=Goodmanp179/&gt;

Many Japanese parents abroad sent their children to Japan to attend high school after they completed the junior high school abroad, or leaving the children behind, so they could become accustomed to the difficult Japanese university entrance systems. Toshio Iwasaki, the editor of the ''[[Journal of Japanese Trade &amp; Industry]]'', stated that this reason inhibited the development of Japanese senior high schools in other countries.&lt;ref name=Iwasakip24/&gt; The first overseas international schools that served the senior high school level were the [[Rikkyo School in England]],&lt;ref name=Iwasakip24/&gt; gaining senior high school level classes after 1975,&lt;ref name=RikkyoEnglishinfo&gt;"[http://www.rikkyo.co.uk/special/information-in-english.html INFORMATION IN ENGLISH]."

By 1991 Japanese international senior high schools were in operation in the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Germany, Denmark, and Ireland.&lt;ref name=Iwasakip24/&gt;

By 1991 many overseas Japanese high schools were accepting students who were resident in Japan, and some wealthier families in Japan chose to send their children to Japanese schools abroad instead of Japanese schools in Japan.&lt;ref name=Iwasakip25&gt;Iwasaki, Toshio.

While Japan was experiencing a major [[recession]] called the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]] in the 1990s, so were ''nihonjin gakkō''. Many of them were closed due to a dramatic decrease in enrollment.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Since the early 1990s more parents have chosen a local school or an [[international school]] over a ''nihonjin gakkō''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
* The parents prefer the children to receive education in English: Nihonjin gakkō has only [[Primary education|elementary]] and [[middle school]]s (Grade 1 through 9) that are mandatory in Japan. Some offer a [[kindergarten]] program as well as a high school program but it is uncommon. The children educated in English-speaking environment will be able to continue their education where they live with their parents. Otherwise they need to pass the entrance exam to enroll in a boarding school in Japan or one of the seven (as of October 2006) ''[[Shiritsu zaigai kyōiku shisetsu]]'' ([[:ja:在外教育施設#私立在外教育施設|私立在外教育施設]]) Japanese boarding schools worldwide.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
* The parents take advantage of the situation and let the children be exposed to local culture and make non-Japanese friends.
* Many private and public Japanese schools have become flexible and accept expatriate students by having a separate requirements for admissions or offering exams in English.

Nihonjin gakkos tend to be in the following types of areas in the world:
* Area with a big Japanese temporary resident population such as [[London]] and [[New York City]]. Many students are staying only for a few years for their parent's business. Many parents would send their child to a local school if they lived in an English-speaking country.
* Area where English is not the official language such as [[Düsseldorf]], [[São Paulo]], [[Dubai]], [[Shanghai]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]].

He became a successful TV director, directing numerous episodes of the ''[[Tatort]]'' and ''Kommissar Rex'' series. His first theatrical release was the well-received movie ''[[Das Experiment]]''.

In 2004, he attracted world-wide attention with the film ''Der Untergang'' (released in English-speaking countries as ''[[Downfall (2004 film)|Downfall]]''), produced by [[Bernd Eichinger]]. It recounts [[Adolf Hitler]]'s last days, and sparked an extensive debate in Germany over the portrayal of Nazi leaders. The film was a critical and commercial success, winning numerous awards and a nomination for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for the best foreign film. One scene from the film has become the basis for a widespread [[Downfall (2004 film)#Parodies|viral video phenomenon]].

He directed his first Hollywood feature ''[[The Invasion (film)|The Invasion]]'', which was partly re-shot by [[Australia]]n director [[James McTeigue]], at the request of the studio.

Hirschbiegel directed the biographical film ''[[Diana (film)|Diana]]'', about [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], which was released in September 2013. Actress [[Naomi Watts]] plays the title role.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16968014 |title=Naomi Watts lands Princess Diana role  |accessdate=2012-02-10|work=BBC News|date=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His film ''[[13 Minutes]]'' was selected to be screened out of competition at the [[65th Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Berlin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/wettbewerb/wettbewerb-presse-detail_26644.html |title=Berlinale 2015: Competition Complete |accessdate=28 January 2015 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2794">'''"Professional studies"''' is a term used to classify academic programs which are applied or interdisciplinary in focus. The term can also be used for non-academic training for a specific [[profession]].

Professional studies usually combine theory and [[practice-based professional learning]], focusing on a [[body of knowledge]] that is more strictly delineated and [[canon (basic principle)|canon]]ical than non-professional studies. Students are trained to ensure expected [[Standard of care|standards]] and adequate service delivery in the [[best practice]] of a profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/edlite-professional-studies.html| title=First-Professional Studies| accessdate=2007-04-25| author=US Department of Education| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214142648/http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/edlite-professional-studies.html| archivedate=2007-12-14| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional studies may lead to [[academic degrees]] such as the Bachelor of Professional Studies (BPS), [[Master of Professional Studies]] (MPS), or [[Doctor of Professional Studies]] (DPS). A BPS is similar to a [[Bachelor of General Studies]] with a greater emphasis on practical and technical training (and a corresponding lower emphasis on [[liberal arts]]), and therefore of greater interest to mid-career students.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} MPS degrees are usually course-based with a report or project component rather than a research [[thesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/edlite-masters-degree.html| title=Master's Degrees Programs| accessdate=2007-04-25| author=US Department of Education |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070219224943/http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/edlite-masters-degree.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[US National Science Foundation]] considers a DPS to be equivalent to a [[PhD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/edlite-research-doctorate.html| title=Research Doctorate Programs| accessdate=2007-04-25| author=US Department of Education |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070303214708/http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/edlite-research-doctorate.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4566">A '''radio reading service''' or '''reading service for the blind''' is a [[Public services|service]] of many [[universities]], community groups and [[public radio]] [[radio station|station]]s, where a [[narrator]] reads [[books]], [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s aloud for the benefit of the [[blindness|blind]] and [[Visual perception|vision]]-impaired.  It is most often carried on a [[subcarrier]], with [[radio]] [[receiver (radio)|receiver]]s permanently [[Tuner (radio)|tuned]] to a given station in the area, or an [[HD Radio]] subchannel of the offering station.  Some reading services use alternative methods for reaching their audiences, including broadcasting over SAP, streaming Internet radio, cable TV, or even terrestrial TV.

The International Association of Audio Information Services (IAAIS) serves as the primary member organization for radio reading services, and has member services or has consulted with and assisted local organizations in Canada, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Jamaica, Japan, Mexico, Panama, New Zealand, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.

The first radio reading service in the United States was the Minnesota Radio Talking Book Network, started in 1969 by C. Stanley Potter and Robert Watson.  After six years of researching the concept, a Kansas philanthropist learned of the Minnesota service, and with their help in 1971 Petey Cerf founded [[Audio-Reader]], the second reading service in the nation, in Lawrence.  In the late 1970s, Audio-Reader director Rosie Hurwitz and Stan Potter served as the first two presidents of the Association of Radio Reading Services, which came to be known as the National Association of Radio Reading Services, and, finally, IAAIS.

The first radio reading service in Canada was founded by Richard Moses and Gordon Norman in Oakville, Ontario, in the basement of the Woodside Branch of the Oakville Public Library in the mid-1970s. 

In the [[United States]], many public radio stations carry a local or regional reading service on an FM subcarrier.  They are commonly affiliated with universities, libraries and other non-profit institutions. Reception of these stations require a special receiver, available at no cost to the listener, though most organizations require certification that the potential listener is unable to use normal printed material. Stations in other countries also carry such a service in this fashion.  Some radio reading services are broadcast on standard FM stations.  [[WRBH]] in [[New Orleans]] was the first full-time open channel radio reading service, although [[WRKC]] in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]] has been broadcasting a two-hour-a-day service, the [[Radio Home Visitor]], since 1974. [[WYPL]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], run by volunteers of the Memphis Public Library, devotes nearly its entire broadcast day to a mixture of live readings and prerecorded readings overnight.

The first internet-based reading service was [[Assistive Media]], founded in 1996 by David Erdody in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/06/cyber/articles/30audio.html New Media Helps Visually Impaired Hear Old Media]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.AssistiveMedia.org Assistive Media]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the over 100 audio information services in the U.S. today stream their broadcasts live on the internet, and some offer online archives of previously broadcast programming.  Some organizations are providing their listeners with internet radios preprogrammed to easily find the internet stream.

[[File:PortalSJR.JPG|thumb|Portal SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank screenshot]]

'''SCImago Journal Rank''' (SJR indicator) is a [[citation metric|measure]] of scientific influence of [[academic journal|scholarly journal]]s that accounts for both the number of [[citation]]s received by a journal and the importance or prestige of the journals where such citations come from. A journal's SJR is a numeric value indicating the average number of weighted citations received during a selected year per document published in that journal during the previous three years. Higher SJR values are meant to indicate greater journal prestige. 

The SJR indicator is a variant of the [[centrality|eigenvector centrality measure]] used in network theory. Such measures establish the importance of a node in a network based on the principle that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node. The SJR indicator has been developed to be used in extremely large and heterogeneous journal citation networks. It is a size-independent indicator and its values order journals by their "average prestige per article" and can be used for journal comparisons in science evaluation processes. The SJR indicator is a free journal metric inspired by, and using an algorithm similar to, [[PageRank]].

The ''SJR indicator'' provides an alternative to the [[impact factor]] (IF) or average citations per document in a 2-year period, abbreviated as "Cites per Doc. (2y)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080102/full/451006a.html | title= Free journal-ranking tool enters citation market | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | date= 2 January 2008 | volume= 451 | issue= 6 | doi= 10.1038/451006a | author = Declan Butler | pmid= 18172465 | pages= 6 |accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/short/22/8/2623 | title = Comparison of SCImago journal rank indicator with journal impact factor | author= Matthew E.

== Rationale ==
If scientific impact is considered related to the number of endorsements, in the form of citations, a journal receives, then prestige can be understood as a combination of the number of endorsements and the prestige or importance of the journals issuing them. The ''SJR indicator'' assigns different values to citations depending on the importance of the journals where they come from. This way, citations coming from highly important journals will be more valuable and hence will provide more prestige to the journals receiving them. The calculation of the ''SJR indicator'' is very similar to the ''[[Eigenfactor]] score'', with the former being based on the [[Scopus]] database and the latter on the [[Web of Science]] database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank (SJR) as an alternative to Thomson Reuters's Impact Factor and EigenFactor | url=http://www.scimagojr.com/news.php?id=41 | date=21 Aug 2008 | accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computation ==
The SJR indicator computation is carried out using an iterative [[algorithm]] that distributes prestige values among the journals until a steady-state solution is reached. The SJR algorithm begins by setting an identical amount of prestige to each journal, then using an iterative procedure, this prestige is redistributed in a process where journals transfer their achieved prestige to each other through citations. The process ends up when the difference between journal prestige values in consecutive iterations do not reach a minimum threshold value any more. The process is developed in two phases, (a) the computation of ''Prestige SJR'' (''PSJR'') for each journal: a size-dependent measure that reflects the whole journal prestige, and (b) the normalization of this measure to achieve a size-independent measure of prestige, the ''SJR indicator''.&lt;ref name="DESCRIPTION OF SCIMAGO JOURNAL RANK INDICATOR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank|title=DESCRIPTION OF SCIMAGO JOURNAL RANK INDICATOR|url=http://www.scimagojr.com/SCImagoJournalRank.pdf|website=SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bynum is a graduate of [[Brown University]] and the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop|University of Iowa Writers' Workshop]]. Fairy tales are a common theme in many of her works. Bynum expressed her interest in fairy tales is because "they always walk that line between wonder and darkness," as well as the "disturbing energy" that they hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/w_apa/showarticle.aspx?articleID=16340 | title = Wonder and Darkness: interview with writer Sarah Shun-lien Bynum | publisher = Asia Pacific Arts | date = 2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Madeleine is Sleeping'' was published by Harcourt in 2004, was a finalist for the [[National Book Award]], and winner of the [[Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize]].

In a 2009 book review of ''Ms. Hempel Chronicles'' published in the Sunday book review of ''The New York Times'', Josh Emmons notes Bynum's "prose remains nimble and entertaining, a model of quiet control well suited to its subject" and the "deftness with which [Ms. Hempel] observes and describes her world and its inhabitants is so engaging that for all its circumspection and regrettable lacunae, “Ms. Hempel Chronicles” works as an account of how nostalgia — both for what was and might have been — can generate a thousand mercies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/books/review/Emmons-t.html|title=Chalk Dust Memories|last=Emmons|first=Josh|date=January 2009|work=The New Yorker|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Bynum was named one of ''New Yorker'' magazine's top "20 Under 40" fiction writers in which the editors note her works "offer idiosyncratic, voice-driven narratives." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/06/14/20-under-40|title=20 Under 40|last=The Editors|first=|date=June 2010|work=The New Yorker|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''SimHealth: The National Health Care Simulation''''' is a [[Business simulation game|management simulation]] video game, developed by Thinking Tools and published by [[Maxis]] with assistance from the [[Markle Foundation]] for [[MS-DOS]] in [[1994 in video gaming|1994]]. It is a simulation of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Healthcare]] system. The game was released during Congressional debates on the [[Clinton health care plan]].

Due to the complexity of the game, SimHealth was seen as being very difficult. Armed with none of the [[tongue-in-cheek]] humor that Maxis's prior games were known for, the only real link to the franchise was the ''[[SimCity 2000]]''-inspired [[user interface]]. The game was seen as more serious than other Maxis games. Noel Fritzinger, who with Lyman Orton first conceptualized [[CommunityViz]], says that his inspiration came from seeing ''SimHealth'' and wondering if the same concepts could be applied to real-world [[land-use planning]].{{fact|date=August 2017}}

==Critical reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s Keith Schlesinger in June 1994 said that "''SimHealth'' is a trailblazer in the simulations genre, but as a game it has problems". Acknowledging that "it wasn't primarily designed as an entertainment product", he criticized the "not well developed" victory conditions, reporting that he got a high score in one game by "sacrific[ing] nearly all of the big and small business firms in the country to achieve the win! What kind of a victory is that?" Schlesinger found that adopting an extreme libertarian ideology including ending [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and many other government services resulted in almost hands-off victory although "the entire private insurance industry goes bankrupt in the first three months". He nonetheless concluded that "''SimHealth'' offers much at a good price, and in a good cause", and recommended it to those "not too fussy about winning and losing", or wanting to be able to alter the model's 152 assumptions.&lt;ref name="miller199406"&gt;{{Cite magazine

'''''SimTower: The Vertical Empire''''' (known as {{nihongo|'''''The Tower'''''|ザ・タワー|Za Tawā}} in Japan) is a [[construction and management simulation]] [[video game]] developed by [[OPeNBooK Co., Ltd.|OpenBook Co., Ltd.]] and published by [[Maxis]] for the [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[System 7|Macintosh System 7]] operating systems in November 1994. In Japan, it was published by OpenBook that same year and was later released for the [[Sega Saturn]] and [[Sony PlayStation]] in 1996.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The game allows players to build and manage a tower and decide what facilities to place in it, in order to ultimately build a five-star tower. Random events take place during play, such as terrorist acts that the player must respond to immediately.

Critical reception towards the game was generally positive. Reviews praised the game's formula, including its open-ended nature and its ability to immerse the player into the game. Criticism targeted the game's lack of documentation, which some reviewers found made it harder to learn how to play the game. The in-game speed was also criticized for being too slow, which was a crucial issue in the game because time must pass for the player to earn income to purchase new facilities.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Simtower.gif|thumb|left|The player views a cross-section of the building from the side]]

''SimTower'' allows the player to build and manage the operations of a modern, multi-use [[skyscraper]]. They must plan where to place facilities in the tower that include restaurants, condominiums, offices, hotel rooms, retail stores and elevators. To prevent tenants from vacating their properties, the player must keep their stress low by fulfilling their demands for medical centers, parking lots, recycling facilities, clean hotel rooms with the help of housekeepers, and an efficient transportation system, which involves managing elevator traffic.&lt;ref name=southchina /&gt; ''SimTower'', which was built around an elevator simulation program, places a strong emphasis on good elevator management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20041018/adams_01.shtml |title=Designer's Notebook |last=Adams |first=Ernest |publisher=Gamasutra |accessdate=September 30, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916193335/http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20041018/adams_01.shtml |archivedate=September 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game begins with a one-star tower with limited building options. To increase the tower's star rating, it must attract more tenants by providing more living space (or office space, and later in the game, hotel and various commercial space). New facilities are made available while the tower progresses from a one-star rating to a five-star rating. The highest achievable rating is the designation of "Tower" which can only be awarded by building a cathedral at the very top of a five-star building with all possible tower levels above ground developed. The tower is limited to a maximum of 100 floors above ground and nine stories below ground. Standard elevators, which can span a maximum of 30 floors, and express elevators, which can span the entire height of the building, must be used efficiently to decrease tenant stress.&lt;ref name=southchina /&gt;

Certain events can take place while managing the tower. For example, terrorists may phone the player to let them know that they have hidden a bomb in the building, and that they demand a ransom. If the ransom is not paid, then security services must find the bomb before it detonates, or else the tower will incur significant damages.&lt;ref name=southchina /&gt; If the player builds facilities underground, the game may notify them that their workers have discovered gold treasure, which gives the player a significant amount of funds. At random intervals during the game, there are notifications that state that a [[Very Important Person|VIP]] will be visiting the tower soon, so the player must prepare for their visit. If the VIP enjoys their visit because of variables such as a comfortable hotel suite and efficient navigation, the VIP will give the tower a favorable rating. A favorable rating would then allow the tower to advance to the next star level, assuming the other qualifications are met. Although it does not have any impact on the tower, at the end of the fourth quarter every year in the game, [[Santa Claus]] and his reindeer fly across the tower.&lt;ref name=allgame /&gt;

==Development==
Developed by [[Yoot Saito]] of [[Vivarium Inc.|OpenBook]], ''SimTower'' was originally titled ''The Tower''.&lt;ref name="GameAxis"&gt;{{cite journal| journal = GameAxis Unwired| publisher = [[Singapore Press Holdings|SPH Magazines]]|date=September 2000| issue = 60| title = Origin of Species| first = Jonathan| last = Leo| page = 27| issn = 0219-872X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It works on computers that can run the [[Microsoft Windows]] or [[System 7|Macintosh System 7]] operating systems; the game will operate on 68k-based Macs at the minimum. It requires [[8-bit color]]s and four megabytes of [[random-access memory]].&lt;ref name=southchina /&gt; Graphics and sounds used in ''SimTower'' are similar to [[List of Sim video games|previous ''Sim'' games]], and high resolution graphics are also used. The sound effects are kept to a minimum; noises that are played in the background include office "buzz" and elevator bells.&lt;ref name=theage /&gt;

While attending [[Waseda University]], Saito played ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]'' on the Macintosh, which prompted him to pursue video game creation after graduating. His first game was a simulation title that was part of a future media project for a publishing house. When Saito asked to develop a second, the business refused because it was not a video game company. He left the company to personally produce the second game, which built on ideas he conceived while working on his first: elevators and towers. Saito teamed up with freelance programmer Takumi Abe to complete the project.&lt;ref name="gamesTM-Retro"&gt;{{cite journal| journal = [[GamesTM]]| publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]]| title = Sonic Yoot| pages = 252–255| author = GamesTM Staff| series = The Ultimate Retro Companion| year = 2010| volume = 3| isbn = 978-1-906078-56-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; To research the gameplay, Saito contacted an elevator company to learn about elevator scheduling and management. However, the company declined to provide the information.&lt;ref name="Dragon217"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Eye of the Monitor |author=Jay &amp; Dee |journal=Dragon |issue=217 |date=May 1995 |pages=65–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saito handled the graphic design, and started with a monochromatic scaled tower created in [[HyperCard]]. The designer added color to differentiate between office- and hotel-type buildings. As development neared completion, Saito noticed that the Mac's performance had improved and decided to increase the [[Palette (computing)|color palette]] size from 16 to 256&amp;nbsp;colors. Saito enlisted a second designer to produce animation for the graphics and improve the details for the color increase.&lt;ref name="gamesTM-Retro" /&gt;

''SimTower'' was successful in Japan, earning the developers a profit. The ''[[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]]'' awarded Saito the "Best Young Manager/Venture of the Year" for his work on the game. After the initial Japanese release, Maxis president Jeff Braun contacted Saito regarding a worldwide release; ''SimCity'' creator [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]] informed Braun of the game.&lt;ref name="gamesTM-Retro" /&gt; The company localized the game for sale in the United States, and changed the name to capitalize on the popularity of the ''Sim'' franchise and increase sales figures.&lt;ref name="GameAxis" /&gt; Maxis published ''SimTower'' for the Windows and [[System 7|Macintosh System 7]] operating systems in November 1994 in the United States.&lt;ref name=southchina /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 22, 2010 |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/simtower-the-vertical-empire/release-info |title=Release Information for SimTower: The Vertical Empire |publisher=MobyGames |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908175821/http://www.mobygames.com/game/simtower-the-vertical-empire/release-info |archivedate=September 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, it was ported to the [[Sega Saturn]] and [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] in Japan.&lt;ref name="gamesTM-Retro" /&gt;

The ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' praised the game's formula, noting that it followed in the footsteps of previous open-ended Maxis games. Comparing to ''[[SimCity 2000]]'', the review remarked that it was more interesting to watch people live out their lives in a tower rather than to observe cars moving around. They also appreciated the "homely" feeling of ''SimTower'', in contrast with other ''Sim'' games such as ''[[SimEarth]]'' and ''[[SimLife]]'', which they felt were too universal to take on a personal identity.&lt;ref name=southchina&gt;{{cite news |title=The race to build is on! |work=South China Morning Post |date=February 26, 1995 |author=Chan, Margaret }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin Svetkey of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the game and commented that it is "more fun than [the concept] sounds". However, he stated that the gameplay may be too much for fans of the series.&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20184081,00.html |title=SimEarth Review |first=Benjamin |last=Svetkey |date=1995-01-13 |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |issue=257 |accessdate=2010-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501024634/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C20184081%2C00.html |archivedate=2011-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' panned the game, saying it lacks the bustling interactivity of previous games in the Sim franchise: "There are bug infestations and the occasional fire with which to deal, but most of the time, ''SimTower'' sees you standing around waiting for cash reserves to grow in order to add more floors. Not much fun at all."&lt;ref name="NGen3"&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first=|title=Condemned |journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=3|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1995|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia's ''[[The Age]]'' found ''SimTower'' a pleasing return to form for Maxis, after the release of the disappointing ''[[SimFarm]]''.&lt;ref name=theage&gt;{{cite news |title=Tower infernal |work=The Age |date=July 20, 1995 |author=Bowtell, Jed |page=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Karen Savignano of [[Allgame]] stated that the game had decent graphics and sound. However, she also felt that ''SimTower'' had good [[replay value]] due to the non-linear gameplay, giving the game four stars out of five.&lt;ref name=allgame&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2010-04-24 |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=642&amp;tab=review |title=SimTower |publisher=Allgame |year=1997 |author=Savignano, Lisa Karen |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115143324/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=642&amp;tab=review |archivedate=2014-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was criticized by the ''South China Morning Post'' for lacking documentation, making it more difficult to learn how to play the game. They also predicted that players would be unhappy with the game's speed, as time plays an important role in earning money from tenants. Before the player can purchase new facilities, a long period of time must pass before income is earned from tenants. The newspaper was also unhappy with complaints from tenants; specific reasons for their dissatisfaction are never given.&lt;ref name=southchina /&gt; ''The Age'' was disappointed by the lack of pre-built towers and scenarios, suggesting that one along the lines of ''[[The Towering Inferno]]''{{'}}s plot could have been included.&lt;ref name=theage /&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' referred to ''SimTower'' as a "lesser-known" simulation game, and described it as "fun and addictive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal = [[Game Informer]]| publisher = [[GameStop|GameStop Corporation]]|date=June 2007| issue = 170| title = Classic GI: The Forgotten Sims| page = 124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'', Matt Miller felt that, when compared to ''[[SimCity 2000]]'' (1993), gameplay in ''SimTower'' moved slowly. He also disliked the moments when he had to wait several minutes to pass by before he could make enough money to purchase new additions for his building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=High-rise anxiety builds with Maxis treat Addictive CD-ROM turns kids, adults into developers, tower landlords |work=San Diego Union-Tribune |date=1995-06-06 |author=Miller, Matt |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine's reviewers Jay and Dee praised the visuals and gameplay. However, the two commented that the game can feel slow because it lacks gameplay elements and options present in other strategy games.&lt;ref name="Dragon217" /&gt; In 1995, the Software and Information Industry Association listed ''SimTower'' as the "Best Simulation Program" in the Consumer software category of their annual [[Software and Information Industry Association#CODiE Awards|Codie award]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siia.net/codies/2009/pw_1995.asp |title=Past Winners - 2009 SIIA CODiE Awards |publisher=Software and Information Industry Association |accessdate=2009-01-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015120544/http://www.siia.net/codies/2009/pw_1995.asp |archivedate=2009-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was followed by ''[[Yoot Tower]]'' (called ''The Tower II'' in Japan), also designed by Yoot Saito, which was initially released on November 24, 1998 for the Macintosh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=July 12, 2010 |url=http://www.giantbomb.com/yoot-tower/61-4881/releases/?r=93799 |title=Release Summary |publisher=GaintBomb.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406070606/http://www.giantbomb.com/yoot-tower/61-4881/releases/?r=93799 |archivedate=April 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal = [[Maximum PC]]| publisher = [[Future plc|Future US]]|date=February 1999| volume = 4| issue = 2| title = Yoot Tower| page = 44| issn = 1522-4279}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later made available for the Windows operating systems in January 1999. ''Yoot Tower''{{'}}s gameplay is similar to that of ''SimTower''—players build hotels, resorts, and office buildings, and work towards building a five-star tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Interactive Games Make Their Play |work=Daily News of Los Angeles |date=July 7, 1999 |author=Bloom, David }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vivarium]] launched a version of ''SimTower'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]], called ''[[The Tower SP]]'', published by [[Nintendo]] in Japan on April 28, 2005, and by [[Sega]] in the United States on March 15, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-10-07 |url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/725/725107p1.html |title=The Tower SP |publisher=IGN |date=2006-07-06 |author=DeVries, Jack |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008000408/http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/725/725107p1.html |archivedate=2008-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A version of ''SimTower'' called ''The Tower DS'' was published by [[DigiToys]] in Japan on June 26, 2008.&lt;ref name=tower-ds&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2010-04-18 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/strategy/thetowerds/similar.html?mode=versions |title=The Tower DS – Related Games |publisher=GameSpot }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=July 12, 2010 |url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/725/725107p1.html |title=The Tower DS announcement |publisher=IGN |work= |author= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205174342/http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/725/725107p1.html |archivedate=December 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Yoot Tower]]'' was also released for [[iPad]] devices via the online iOS App Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2012-02-27 |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yoot-tower/id379197311?mt=8 |title=Yoot Tower in iTunes iOS App Store for iPad's |publisher=iTunesiOSAppStore |work= |author=DigiToys Inc. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128113657/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yoot-tower/id379197311?mt=8 |archivedate=2012-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To become a professional [[securities broker]] in the United States, an individual must take and pass the [[General Securities Representative Exam]] (Series 7) and in most states, the [[Uniform Securities Agent State Law Examination]] (Series 63). To take the test, you must be sponsored by "a member firm, a self-regulatory organization (SRO), or an exchange." This requirement, as well as the administration of the test, is under the jurisdiction of FINRA, the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]].&lt;ref name="Investo"&gt;{{cite web |title = Investopedia FAQs | url =http://www.investopedia.com/professionals/FAQs/series7/260304_1.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For individuals who are interested only in managing their own investments, several options exist to obtain a [[stock market]] education:

* Traditional classroom setting
* Non-traditional classroom settings
* Self-education
* Mentor/[[apprentice]]ship relationship

== Traditional classroom settings ==
Many colleges and universities offer courses of study in business, economics, and finance. However, the coursework is aimed at preparing the student for the professional world. They are not designed or intended to teach a student how to trade in the stock market, although the introductory/basic courses would provide a good basic foundation of knowledge. Those intending to follow the professional stockbroker career path usually begin their education by obtaining a degree in business, economics, or finance.

Some of the core subjects covered by an [[undergraduate|undergraduate education]] during the course of a financial/business college education are:

* Basic marketing
* Business communication
* [[Business ethics]]
* Financial accounting
* [[Macroeconomics]]
* Mathematics
* [[Microeconomics]]
* Real estate
* [[financial risk management|Risk management]]
* [[Statistics]]
&lt;ref name="Florida"&gt;{{cite web |title = Florida State University, College of Business undergraduate course requirements | url =http://cob.fsu.edu/fin/fin_ba_curriculum.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calif"&gt;{{cite web |title = University of California, Haas School of Business undergraduate course requirements |url = http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/core.html |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100202052836/http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/core.html |archivedate = 2010-02-02 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-traditional classroom settings ==
Non-traditional classroom settings are offered by:

* Non-profit organizations that offer stock market educational material
* Stock market organizations that offer stock market educational material
* For-profit businesses

For-profit financial education companies exist that offer programs of study (also referred to as "systems" or "courses" &amp;ndash; the terminology varies) on stock market education. Unlike colleges that prepare students for working in the financial arena, these companies educate students with a more narrow focus &amp;ndash; how to trade [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] for the purpose of personal investing. Examples of such companies are [[thinkorswim]] (formerly Investools), Invested Central, [[Trading Advantage]], Global Finance School, and Rich Dad's Education (based on the "[[Rich Dad, Poor Dad]]" book by [[Robert Kiyosaki]]). These types of companies offer both classroom settings for learning and [[distance education]] programs.

Another aspect that differentiates for-profit stock market education companies from traditional colleges is the commercialization factor. For-profit stock market education companies frequently develop other products &amp;ndash; such as software and newsletters &amp;ndash; that they market to their students. Colleges and universities, frequently founded for the purpose of providing education and established as non-profit organizations, do not follow this business model.

== Mentor/apprentice relationship ==
Also referred to as "personal coaches," [[mentor]]s work one-on-one with a student, In this situation, the student receives more personal attention from the instructor than from a classroom or distance learning education. Some mentors offer their services for a fee.&lt;ref name="Mentor_1"&gt;{{cite web |title = Boris Gurevich, Ph.D. #1 Education Partner with InteractiveBrokers, AskTradeMentor.com | url =http://www.AskTradeMentor.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mentor_2"&gt;{{cite web |title = Chicago School of Trading | url =http://www.thechicagoschooloftrading.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-taught ==
The following resources exist in libraries and on the Internet for an individual to learn about investing in the stock market:

* A [[stock market simulator]] allows one to trade without using real funds (also referred to as "[[paper trading]]"). These simulators are offered by organizations associated with the stock market (such as the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]]) and the types of [[for-profit education]] companies mentioned in [[#Non-traditional_classroom_settings|Non-traditional classroom settings]].
* Articles
** Financial magazines like ''[[Money (magazine)]]'',''[[Kiplinger]]'' and ''[[Forbes]]'' provide investing articles, though their target market is aimed at more general investors. Magazines that focus on trading derivatives are ''Active Trader'' and ''Tradersworld''. Magazines with an online presence also offer access to some, if not all, of their articles online.
** Web sites devoted to the stock market or trading arena post articles online or send them via email to subscribers. These web sites can be free, non-profit, or for-profit.
* Books written by investors and traders.
* Online forums that discuss subjects related to the stock market and trading derivatives.
* Non-profit organizations that offer stock market educational material:    
** [[American Association of Individual Investors]]   
** [[Alliance for Investor Education]]    
** BetterInvesting Community    
** Investor Protection Trust   
** National Endowment for Financial Education    
** [[North American Securities Administrators Association]]    
** Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Investor Education and Assistance
* Stock market organizations that offer stock market educational material:    
** [[American Stock Exchange]]    
** [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]] (CBOE)    
** [[Council for Economic Education]]    
** [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]]    
** [[NASDAQ Educational Foundation]]    
** [[New York Stock Exchange]]

== Stock market subjects to learn ==
Whether an individual chooses a traditional or non-traditional education to learn how the stock market works, the following basic subjects are covered:

* How the stock market [[stock exchange]] works
* Live trading on various trading terminals
* Risks Management which can be managed by learning Derivatives( [[Futures contract]] and [[Option contract]] and Portfolio Management
* Money Management
* Behavioral Finance
* How to interpret financial or economic news
* What to look for in a broker or brokerage firm

'''More advanced topics would include:'''

* Trading strategies
* [[Fundamental analysis]]
* [[Technical analysis]]

'''TED Conferences LLC''' ('''Technology, Entertainment, Design''') is a media organization that posts talks online for free distribution under the slogan "ideas worth spreading."

==History==

===1984-99: Founding and early years===
[[File:Bill Clinton talking at TED 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Clinton]] addresses TED, 2007]]
TED was conceived in 1984 by architect and graphic designer [[Richard Saul Wurman]], who observed a [[technological convergence|convergence]] of the fields of technology, entertainment, and design (that is, "TED").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tatvasoft world of inspiring people and their ideas |url=https://www.ted.com/profiles/5778538}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first conference, organized by Harry Marks and Wurman in the same year, featured demos of the [[compact disc]], co-developed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] and one of the first demonstrations of the [[Apple Macintosh]] computer.&lt;ref name="addict"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forum"&gt;Cadwalladr, Carole [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jul/04/ted-conference-oxford-carole-cadwalladr Ted – the ultimate forum for blue-sky thinking] July 4, 2010, [[The Guardian]], Retrieved September 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Presentations were given by famous mathematician [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] and influential members of the [[digerati]] community, like [[Nicholas Negroponte]] and [[Stewart Brand]]. The event was financially unsuccessful; it took six years before the second conference was organized.&lt;ref name="ted.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/pages/16|title=History of TED {{!}} Our Organization {{!}} About {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990 onward, a growing community of "TEDsters" gathered annually at the event in California State University Monterey Bay, until 2009, when it was relocated to [[Long Beach, California]] due to a substantial increase in attendees.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Victoria|title=Long Beach to host influential TED conference|date=January 16, 2008|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/16/business/fi-ted16|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the speakers had been drawn from the fields of expertise behind the acronym TED, but during the nineties, the roster of presenters broadened to include scientists, philosophers, musicians, religious leaders, philanthropists, and many others.&lt;ref name="ted.com"/&gt;

===2000-16: Recent growth===
[[File:Chris Anderson 2007.jpg|thumb|Curator [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]] in 2007]]
In 2000, Wurman, looking for a successor at age 65, met with new-media entrepreneur and TED enthusiast [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]] to discuss future happenings. Anderson's UK media company [[Future plc|Future]] bought TED. In November 2001, Anderson's non-profit The [[Sapling Foundation]] (motto: ''"fostering the spread of great ideas."'')&lt;ref name="sapling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/pages/42 |title=About TED: Who we are: Who owns TED |work=TED: Ideas Worth Sharing |publisher=TED Conferences, LLC |accessdate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; acquired TED from Future for £6m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/i-was-losing-1-million-a-day-every-day-for-18-months-meet-chris/|title='I was losing $1 million a day, every day for 18 months': Meet Chris Anderson, the man behind TED talks|date=April 29, 2016|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2002, Anderson gave a TED Talk in which he explained his vision of the conference and his future role of [[curator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/chris_anderson_shares_his_vision_for_ted.html|title=TED's nonprofit transition|last=Anderson|first=Chris|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wurman left after the 2002 conference.

In 2006, attendance cost was $4,400 per person and was by invitation only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/about/invitations|title=Getting Invited (attendees)|work=TED: Ideas Worth Spreading|publisher=TED Conferences, LLC|accessdate=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The membership model was shifted in January 2007 to an annual membership fee of $6,000, which includes attendance of the conference, club mailings, networking tools, and conference DVDs. The 2018 conference was $10,000 per attendee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/attend/conferences/ted-conference#h3--ted-conference-standard-membership|title=TED Conference|website=www.ted.com|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the conference was relocated to Vancouver.

TED is currently funded by a combination of various revenue streams, including conference attendance fees, corporate sponsorships, foundation support, licensing fees, and book sales. Corporate sponsorships are diverse, provided by companies such as [[Google]], [[General Electric|GE]], [[AOL]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[The Coca-Cola Company]], among others. Sponsors do not participate in the creative direction of the event, nor are they allowed to present on the main stage, in the interests of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How TED Works|url=https://www.ted.com/about/our-organization/how-ted-works|website=TED.com|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=americanu&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ochoa|first1=Rosmari|title=Technology, Entertainment and Design (TED): A case study on how complimentary on- and off-line approaches can build community and cultivate platformsfor innovation and creativity|url=https://www.american.edu/soc/communication/upload/Rosemari-Ochoa.pdf|website=American University School of Communication|publisher=American University|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TED staff consists of about 180 people headquartered in [[New York City]] and [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/about/our-organization/who-we-are|title=Who we are - Our organization - About - TED|website=TED.com|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TED Prize==
The TED Prize was introduced in 2005. Until 2010, it annually granted three individuals $100,000 and a "wish to change the world".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruno Giussani]].  [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruno-giussani/ted-2008-day-2-dave-egger_b_89106.html "Day 2: Dave Eggers and Tutoring, Neil Turok and the next African Einstein, Karen Armstrong and the Charter for Compassion"], ''Huffington Post'', February 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Each winner unveils their wish at the main annual conference. Since 2010, in a changed selection process, a single winner is chosen to ensure that TED can maximize its efforts in achieving the winner's wish. In 2012, the prize was not awarded to an individual, but to a concept connected to the current global phenomenon of increasing [[urbanization]]. In 2013, the prize amount was increased to $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tedprize.org/|title=TED Prize {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=www.tedprize.org|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TED Prize winners in previous years:

In 2005, Chris Anderson hired [[June Cohen]] as Director of TED Media. In June 2006, after Cohen's idea of a TV show based on TED lectures was rejected by several networks, a selection of talks that had received the highest audience ratings was posted on the websites of TED, [[YouTube]], and [[iTunes]], under [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0.&lt;ref name="giving"&gt;{{cite web |title=Giving Away Information, but Increasing Revenue |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/16/technology/16ecom.html |publisher=NYT |accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/tedtalksdirector|title=TED|work=YouTube|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, only a handful of talks were posted, to test if there was an audience for them. In January of the next year, the number of TED Talks on the site had grown to 44, and they had been viewed more than three million times. On the basis of that success, the organization pumped hundreds of thousands of dollars into its video production operations and into the development of a website to showcase about 100 of the talks.&lt;ref name="giving"/&gt;

In April 2007, the new TED.com was launched, developed by design firm Method. In subsequent years, the website has won many prizes, among which seven [[Webby Award]]s, iTunes' "Best Podcast of the Year" (2006-2010), the [[Communication Arts (magazine)|Communication Arts]] Interactive Award for "Information Design" in 2007, the OMMA Award for "video sharing" in 2008, the Web Visionary Award for "technical achievement" in 2008, [[The One Club|The One Show Interactive]] Bronze Award in 2008, the [[AIGA]] Annual Design Competition (2009), and a [[Peabody Award]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bibliotech.stanford.edu/conf11_speakers|title=2011 Speakers {{!}} BiblioTech Program|website=bibliotech.stanford.edu|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://method.com/about/awards|title=Work|website=Method|access-date=June 18, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807060646/http://method.com/about/awards|archivedate=August 7, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/ted.com|title=TED.com|website=www.peabodyawards.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TED Review|publisher=[[MacWorld]]|url=http://www.macworld.com/appguide/app.html?id=707209|date=December 22, 2009|accessdate=December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---Not sure if is exactly the right link.

As of January 2018, over 2600 TED talks had been posted.&lt;ref name="numbertalks"/&gt; Every week 5-7 new talks are published. In January 2009, the then number of videos had been viewed 50 million times. In June 2011, the number of views totaled 500 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/06/27/ted-anniversary/|title=With 500 Million Views, TED Talks Provide Hope for Intelligent Internet Video|last=Kessler|first=Sarah|website=Mashable|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on November 13, 2012, TED reached its billionth video view.&lt;ref name="billion"/&gt; Chris Anderson in an interview in March 2012:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It used to be 800 people getting together once a year; now it's about a million people a day watching TED Talks online. When we first put up a few of the talks as an experiment, we got such impassioned responses that we decided to flip the organization on its head and think of ourselves not so much as a conference but as "ideas worth spreading," building a big website around it. The conference is still the engine, but the website is the amplifier that takes the ideas to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.departures.com/articles/teds-chris-anderson|title=TED’s Chris Anderson|website=Departures|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 2012, [[Netflix]] announced a deal to [[streaming media|stream]] an initial series of 16 two-hour shows, consisting of TED Talks covering similar subjects, from multiple speakers. The content was made available to subscribers in the US, Canada, Latin America, the UK, and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2012/03/15/netflix-to-stream-ted-talks/|title=Netflix To Stream TED Talks|last=Savitz|first=Eric|website=Forbes|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hosted by Jami Floyd, ''[[TED (conference)#TED.com|TED Talks NYC]]'' debuted on [[NYC Media|NYC Life]] on March 21, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TED TALKS IN NYC –FEATURING WORLD-RENOWNED TALKS FROM TED.COM – PREMIERES ON NYC LIFE |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/media/html/news/tedtalksinnycpremieres.shtml |accessdate=January 17, 2012 |newspaper=.nyc.gov |date=March 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103151258/http://www.nyc.gov/html/media/html/news/tedtalksinnycpremieres.shtml |archivedate=November 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TEDGlobal===
In 2005, under Anderson's supervision, a more internationally oriented sister conference was added, under the name TEDGlobal. It was held, in chronological order: in [[Oxford]], [[UK]] (2005), in [[Arusha]], Tanzania (2007, titled TEDAfrica), in Oxford again (2009 and 2010), and in [[Edinburgh]], UK (2011, 2012, and 2013). In 2014, it was held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/pages/ted_conferences_about_past_teds_v2|title=Past TEDs {{!}} Conferences {{!}} About {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there was TED India, in [[Mysore]] (2009) and TEDGlobal London in [[London]] (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/tedgloballondon_programbrochure.pdf|title=TEDGlobal&gt;London Tuesday 16 June 2015|website=tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com|access-date=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; TEDGlobal 2017 was held again in Arusha, Tanzania and it was curated and hosted by Emeka Okafor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ted-global-2017-arusha-tanzania|title=Ten years on, TEDGlobal is tackling Africa's education crisis|last=Christian|first=Bonnie|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TED Translators (formerly The Open Translation Project (OTP))===
TED Translators started as TED Open Translation Project in May 2009 and aims to "[reach] out to the 4.5 billion people on the planet who don't speak English", according to TED Curator Chris Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/OpenTranslationProject|title=TED Open Translation Project|publisher=|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OTP utilizes crowd-based subtitling platforms to translate the text of TED and TED-Ed videos, as well as to caption and translate videos created in the TEDx program (with its technology partner [[dotSUB]] until May 2012, and then with [[open source]] translation tool [[Amara (subtitling)|Amara]]). At the time of the launch, 300 translations had been done by 200 volunteer transcribers in 40 languages.&lt;ref name="TED"/&gt; In May 2015, over 70,000 sets of subtitles in 107 languages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/participate/translate/otp-2014-annual-report|title=2014 annual report: TED Open Translation Project {{!}} Translate {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been completed by (an all-time total of) 38,173 volunteer translators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amara.org/en/teams/ted/|title=Dashboard - TED {{!}} Amara|website=www.amara.org|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project contributed to a significant increase in international visitors to TED's website, with traffic from outside the US growing 350 percent, 600 percent growth in Asia, and more than 1000 percent in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/at-1-year-anniversary-teds-open-translation-project-celebrates-more-than-7000-completed-translations-from-4000-volunteers-in-75-languages-93683249.html|title=At 1-Year Anniversary, TED's Open Translation Project Celebrates More Than 7,000 Completed Translations From 4,000 Volunteers in 75 Languages|website=www.prnewswire.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TEDx===
{{See also|List of TEDx conferences}}
TEDx are independent TED-like events, which can be organized by anyone who obtains a free license from TED, agreeing to follow certain principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/fashion/26TEDX.html|title=A Conference Makes Learning Free (and Sexy)|last=Rosenbloom|first=Stephanie|date=September 24, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TEDx events are non-profit but may use an admission fee or commercial sponsorship to cover costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/pages/view/id/493#general-rules|title=TEDx Rules {{!}} Before you start {{!}} Organize a local TEDx event {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, speakers are not paid. They must also relinquish the copyrights to their materials, which TED may edit and distribute under a [[Creative Commons]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mypages.iit.edu/~tedxiit/|title=TEDxIIT|website=mypages.iit.edu|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TEDx event is organized by volunteers from the local community, and just like TED events, it lacks any commercial, religious, or political agenda. Its goal is to spark conversation, connection, and community.

As of January 2014, the TEDxTalks library contained some 30,000 films and presentations from over 130 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tedxtalks.ted.com/|title=TED {{!}} TEDx Events {{!}} TEDxTalks|website=tedxtalks.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/markfidelman/2012/06/19/heres-why-ted-and-tedx-are-so-incredibly-appealing-infographic/2/|title=Here's Why TED and TEDx are So Incredibly Appealing (infographic)|author=Mark Fidelman|date=June 19, 2012|work=Forbes|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2017, the TEDx archive surpassed 100,000 talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.ted.com/achievement-unlocked-tedx-celebrates-100000-talks/|title=Achievement unlocked: TEDx celebrates 100,000 talks!|date=October 19, 2017|work=TED Blog|access-date=October 30, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, eight TEDx events were organised every day; raised up from five in June 2012, the previous year, in 133 countries.&lt;ref name="listen"&gt;Heller, Nathan [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/07/09/120709fa_fact_heller ''Listen and Learn''], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', July 9, 2012.

===TED Fellows===
[[File:TEDGlobal2012.jpg|thumb|TEDGlobal 2012 at the [[Edinburgh International Conference Centre]]]]
TED Fellows were introduced in 2007, during the first TEDAfrica conference in [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]], where 100 young people were selected from across the continent. Two years later, during TEDIndia, 99 Fellows were recruited, mainly from South Asia. In 2009, the Fellows program was initiated in its present form. For every TED or TEDGlobal conference, 20 Fellows are selected; a total of 40 new Fellows a year. Each year, 20 past Fellows are chosen to participate in the two-year Senior Fellows program (in which they will attend four more conferences).

Acceptance as a Fellow is not based on academic [[credential]]s, but mainly on past and current actions, and plans for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/pages/248|title=Application tips {{!}} Apply to be a TED Fellow {{!}} TED Fellows Program {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides attending a conference free of charge, each Fellow takes part in a special program with [[mentorship|mentoring]] by experts in the field of spreading ideas, and he or she can give a short talk on the "TED Fellows" stage. Some of these talks are subsequently published on TED.com. Senior Fellows have additional benefits and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/18/tedglobal-fellows|title=Wired meets 2011's TED Fellows|last=Rowan|first=David|date=July 18, 2011|website=Wired|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720175312/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/18/tedglobal-fellows|archive-date=July 20, 2011|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TED-Ed===
TED-Ed is a category of TED talks which are short animated lessons aimed at children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ed.ted.com/about|title=Lessons Worth Sharing|website=TED-Ed|language=en|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It creates explanatory animation videos on various concepts. TED-Ed lessons are created in collaboration with educators and animators. Current advisers for Ted-Ed lessons include [[Aaron Sams]], Jackie Bezos, John Hunter, [[Jonathan Bergmann]], [[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Sir Ken Robinson]], [[Melinda Gates|Melinda French Gates]], and [[Sal Khan|Salman Khan]].

===TEDMED===
{{Main|TEDMED}}

[[TEDMED]] is an annual conference concerned with health and medicine. It is an independent event operating under license from the nonprofit TED conference.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.ted.com/tedmed_a_new_pa/|title=TEDMED: a new partnership|date=January 19, 2010|website=TED Blog|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TEDMED was founded in 1998 by TED's founder Ricky Wurman. After years of inactivity, in 2008 Wurman sold TEDMED to entrepreneur [[Marc Hodosh]], who recreated and relaunched it. The first event under Hodosh's ownership was held in San Diego in October 2009. In January 2010, TED.com began including videos of TEDMED talks on the TED website.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The second Hodosh-owned edition of TEDMED took place in October 2010, also in San Diego.  It sold out for a second year and attracted notable healthcare leaders and Hollywood celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDMED|title=Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne with Nathaniel Pearson at TEDMED 2010|date=December 8, 2010|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX0culYjU_A|accessdate=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Jay S. Walker|Jay Walker]] and a group of executives and investors purchased TEDMED from Hodosh for $16 million with future additional payments of as much as $9 million. The conference was then moved to Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |

==Criticism==

===Pricing===
Frank Swain,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2832933/The-man-HEARS-Wi-Fi-Deaf-man-uses-hearing-aid-listen-invisible-networks.html|title=What does the internet SOUND like?|website=Mail Online|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a deaf journalist, refused to participate in a TEDx event without getting paid. He said that it is unacceptable that TED, which is a non-profit organization, charges attendees $6,000 but cannot afford to pay anything to their speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/futures-exchange/why-im-not-a-tedx-speaker-3be652b8eccb|title=Why I'm Not a TEDx Speaker|last=Swain|first=Frank|date=November 8, 2013|website=Medium|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakers at the independently-organized TEDx talks may not be paid; speakers at the official, yearly, TED Conference are compensated for their talks.

[[Sarah Lacy]] of ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' and ''[[TechCrunch]]'' wrote in 2010 that TED attendees complained of elitism from a "hierarchy of parties throughout the LA-area with strict lists and security" after the sessions. She gave TED credit for making talks free online or live streamed.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/09/ted-now-with-more-elitism/|title=TED: Now with More Elitism?|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TED Talk content===
Disagreements have also occurred between TED speakers and organizers. In her 2010 TED Talk, comedian [[Sarah Silverman]] referred to adopting a "retarded" child. TED organizer [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]] objected via his [[Twitter]] account, leading to a Twitter skirmish between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/14/ted-organizer-trashes-speaker-fails-social-iq-test/|title=TED Organizer Trashes Speaker, Fails Social IQ Test|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/15/the-ted-v-sarah-silverman-fight-turns-really-retarded/|title=The TED v. Sarah Silverman Fight Turns Really Retarded|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2010, noted statistician [[Nassim Taleb]] called TED a "monstrosity that turns scientists and thinkers into low-level entertainers, like circus performers." He claimed TED curators did not initially post his talk "warning about the financial crisis" on their site on purely cosmetic grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taleb|first=Nassim|year=2010|title=The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a New Section: 'On Robustness and Fragility'|publisher=Random House Trade|page=336|isbn=0-8129-7381-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nick Hanauer]] spoke at TED University, challenging the popular belief that top income earners in America are the engines of job creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/here-is-the-full-inequality-speech-and-slideshow-that-was-too-hot-for-ted/257323/|title=Here Is the Full Inequality Speech and Slideshow That Was Too Hot for TED|author=National Journal|date=May 17, 2012|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; TED was accused of censoring the talk by not posting it on the website.&lt;ref name=IBT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/342291/20120517/ted-censors-nick-hanauer-talk-income-inequality.htm|title=TED Censors Seattle Multimillionaire Nick Hanauer?s Talk On Income Inequality, Taxing The Rich|date=May 17, 2012|work=International Business Times|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/features/restoration-calls/too-hot-for-ted-income-inequality-20120516|title=Too Hot for TED: Income Inequality|work=www.nationaljournal.com|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[National Journal]]'' reported Chris Anderson had reacted by saying the talk probably ranked as one of the most politically controversial talks they had ever run, and they needed to be careful about when they posted it.&lt;ref name=IBT/&gt; Anderson officially responded, indicating that TED only posts one talk every day, selected from many.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tedchris.posterous.com/131417405|title=Good night, Posterous|website=tedchris.posterous.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' staff writer Bruce Upbin described Hanauer's talk as "shoddy and dumb"&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Upbin. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2012/05/17/the-real-reason-that-ted-talk-was-censored-its-shoddy-and-dumb/ The Real Reason That TED Talk Was 'Censored'? It's Shoddy And Dumb], ''Forbes'', May 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine condemned the conference's move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/arts/all/approvalmatrix/approval-matrix-2012-5-28/|title=The Approval Matrix|date=May 28, 2012|publisher=New York magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a TEDx talk by [[Rupert Sheldrake]], TED issued a statement saying their scientific advisors believed that "there is little evidence for some of Sheldrake's more radical claims" made in the talk and recommended that it "should not be distributed without being framed with caution". The video of the talk was moved from the TEDx YouTube channel to the TED blog accompanied by the framing language called for by the advisors. The move and framing prompted accusations of censorship, to which TED responded by saying the accusations were "simply not true" and that Sheldrake's talk was "up on our website".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.ted.com/2013/03/19/the-debate-about-rupert-sheldrakes-talk/ |title=The debate about Rupert Sheldrake's talk |publisher=TED |date=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bignell, Paul |newspaper=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/ted-conference-censorship-row-8563105.html |title=TED conference censorship row |publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TED has also been accused of censoring a presentation by [[Graham Hancock]] in which he discussed the effects of legal versus illegal drugs, by removing it from YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/04/11/ted-bans-graham-hancocks-talk-on-consciousness/|title=Banned TED Talk: Graham Hancock – The War on Consciousness|publisher=|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Professor [[Benjamin H. Bratton|Benjamin Bratton]] at [[University of California, San Diego]], TED Talks' efforts at fostering progress in socio-economics, science, philosophy, and technology have been ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/30/we-need-to-talk-about-ted "We need to talk about TED"], Prof. Benjamin Bratton, ''The Guardian'', December 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Anderson responded that some critics have a misconception of TED's goals, and failed to recognise that TED aimed to instill excitement in the audience in the same way the speaker felt it. He stated that TED only wishes to bring news of the significance of certain topics to a large audience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/08/ted-not-civilisational-disaster-but-wikipedia "TED is not a recipe for civilisational disaster"], Chris Anderson, ''The Guardian'', January 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Antonio Narro Agrarian Autonomous University''' or Universidad Autónoma Agraria Antonio Narro in Spanish ('''UAAAN''') is a public [[university]] in [[Mexico]] dedicated to the Agricultural, Silvicultural, Animal Production, food and Environmental Sciences. It is located 6 kilometers south of [[Saltillo]], in the Mexican state of [[Coahuila]]. The Antonio Narro Agrarian Autonomous University is one of the most important agricultural college of America Latina and the "Narro" have national and international recognition in the agricultural and animal industry and the high academic level. There is also a campus in [[Torreón]], Coahuila. It is also called "Universidad Antonio Narro" for short, or simply, "La Narro". In 2008 the UAAAN has an enrollment of about 4,500 students in both campuses, all in agriculture and related sciences. 

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:narromainoffice.jpg|thumb|left|The old main building of the Universidad Autónoma Agraria Antonio Narro (originally the main home of Don Antonio Narro; the building also has served as a student dormitory and office of the University President/Rector.]] --&gt;

== History ==

The Antonio Narro Agrarian Autonomous University (UAAAN) was founded on March 4, 1923, after the philanthropist Antonio Narro Rodríguez donated his Buenavista Estate for a public agricultural university, which became the "Regional School of Agriculture Antonio Narro".  The main objective of this university consisted on preparing young people in a professional discipline of agricultural work in the field.  Two months before dying on September 24, 1912, Antonio Narro Rodriguez had bequeathed a substantial part of its personal fortune: his property in Buenavista and $22,000 [[Mexican peso]]s, the value of six urban properties in the city of [[Saltillo]], for constituting a school of agriculture.

Over the years, the university college changed its name several times. In 1938, it became the ''Superior School of Agriculture'' (''Escuela Superior de Agricultura''); by 1957, then became a founding institution of the ''[[Universidad Autónoma de Coahuila|University of Coahuila]]''. In 1975, it became ''Antonio Narro Agrarian Autonomous University'' by a decree of the Coahuila state congress.  Finally, in 2006, UAAAN was recognized as a Federal University, through a decree approved by the House of Representatives, the Senators Chamber and published in the federal registry by the President of Mexico, April 26, 2006.

In the 1990s, the university built and signed on a radio station, [[XESAL-AM]] 1220.

== Shield ==
The emblem that carries the Universidad Autónoma Agraria Antonio Narro expresses the ancestral eagle of Mexico, holding in its talons the spike of wheat as a symbol of life and bread. It holds the wisdom (represented by the owl) surrounded by clouds (rain) that  germinate the seed. Wisdom stands on the plough and the land. Mind and force together for a single purpose: the love of mother earth (Alma Terra Mater), for the life of man.

== Mascot ==

In the same year he was born the team mascot is looking for the same, one day, after an intense practice, team members began to eat with great appetite, which made someone cry "... They eat like vultures ... ". Students found in this bird similar to the colors "black and gold" (some vultures are black, some are white-yellowish neck) also has claw vulture, which was characteristic of the founding team, and lives in the mountains while the school is located in the foothills of the majestic Sierra de "Zapalinamé" and guarded by a jealous guardian: "EI Old Picacho," San Lorenzo Canyon. Thus was born "the Vultures" so much tradition.

== Physical setting ==

Climate at the main (Saltillo) campus of the UAAAN is dry semicalid; there are occasional freezes. Temperature seldom  drops below -2 °C (26 F) (once in some years).  Annual rainfall is about 300 mm.  Natural vegetation is short [[Chihuahuan desert]] brush of several species of ''[[Acacia]]''; there are also ''[[Yucca]]'' spp., [[Agave lechuguilla|lechuguilla]] (''Agave lechuguilla''), [[creosotebush]] (''Larrea tridentata''), [[mesquite]] (''Prosopis''), and granjeno (''Celtis'').

== Facilities ==
The main ([[Saltillo]]) campus of the UAAAN occupies more than 4 square kilometres in a fertile valley a few kilometres south of the city of Saltillo on the [[Zacatecas]] highway. A substantial amount of this land is occupied by experimental and demonstrative plots including annual and perennial crops like: corn, wheat, triticale; vegetables such as temperate (Cruciferae: [[broccoli]], [[cabbage]]), warm-season (Solanaceae: [[Capsicum|peppers]], tomatoes), and others ([[Squash (fruit)|squash]], [[cilantro]], [[onion]]s, [[garlic]], etc.); [[pecan]] and [[pistachio]] orchards; [[greenhouses]] (growing [[vegetables]] and [[ornamentals]]). All agriculture must use [[irrigation]]; there is no [[dryland]] agriculture.  The University also includes animal production facilities (barns for intensive rearing of pigs, cows, goats, and dairy cows, mainly) including [[fistulated cattle]].  There is also has a cattle ranch (Rancho Los Angeles) (extensively colonized by the endangered Mexican prairie dogs, ''[[Cynomys mexicanus]]''); a [[reforestation]] woodland occupying more than 4 km² of [[pine]]s; and a [[botanical garden]] featuring mainly desert plant species ([[cacti]], [[agave]]s) and trees. 

The UAAAN has several agricultural experimental fields across Mexico, encompassing climates from the wet tropics ([[Veracruz]]) to the [[Chihuahuan desert]]: Ocampo, Coahuila state; [[Matehuala]], [[San Luis Potosi]] state (cactus botanical garden); Noria de Guadalupe, [[Zacatecas]] state; [[Cuencamé, Durango|Cuencamé]], [[Durango]] state. Also, in the Sierra Madre Oriental valleys: Navidad, [[Nuevo Leon]] (potato), and Los Lirios, Coahuila state (apple).
