      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1924">'''Adolf Gottlieb (also: Gottlob) Fiedler''' (1771 &amp;ndash; 12 August 1850) was a [[Germany|German]] entrepreneur in [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Congress Poland|Poland]].

==Life==
Born in [[Dresden]] as the son of Christian Gottlob Fiedler, Adolf was one of the most important cloth producers of Saxony in the beginning of the 19th century. The operational seat of the company was in [[Oederan]] in Saxony. He also had factories in [[Kalisz]] and [[Opatówek]] (both in Poland), [[Wegefarth]], [[Wingendorf]], [[Falkenau]] and [[Berthelsdorf]] (all in Saxony). He followed other cloth producers to eastern regions at the time of the German [[industrial revolution]] because of lower salaries and large loans offered by the Polish government. The German investments in Poland were followed by experienced Saxon and [[Bohemia]]n specialists to run the factories. An additional reason was local water power.

From 1824-1826 Fiedler established one of the biggest cloth mills in Congress Poland. He employed around 600 workers in his Polish mill in Opatówek. The products of Fiedler were well known for their quality and won several international prizes.

Fiedler was also [[mayor]] of Oederan.
He had one son, Eduard Magnus and he died in Dresden.

[[Malay titles|Datuk]] '''Ahmad bin Ismail''' (born 1955&lt;ref name="The Sun details"&gt;{{cite news|date=10 September 2008 |url=http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=25544 |title=Man of controversy |work=Himanshu Bhatt |publisher=[[The Sun (Malaysia)|Sun2Surf]] |accessdate=10 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210152441/http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=25544 |archivedate=10 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), is a Malaysian politician and a member of the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), serving as the chief of UMNO's [[Penang Hill|Bukit Bendera]] ([[Penang Hill]]) division in the state of [[Penang]].&lt;ref name="The Sun details"/&gt;

Ahmad Ismail is known for controversial actions and remarks made in the fields of politics, business and sports, including the latest controversy in which he uttered incendiary remarks about the Chinese community during and after the [[Permatang Pauh by-election, 2008|Permatang Pauh by-election in August 2008]], leading to his suspension by UMNO in September 2008.

== Political career ==

=== Accusations of racism ===

==== "Chinese as squatters" remark ====
In late August 2008, Ahmad Ismail was highlighted over racist remarks uttered during campaigning in [[Permatang Pauh by-election, 2008|a by-election]] in [[Permatang Pauh]] that primarily pitted [[Barisan Nasional]] candidate Arif Shah Omar Shah (UMNO) against [[Pakatan Rakyat]] candidate [[Anwar Ibrahim]] (PKR) for the [[Permatang Pauh]] parliamentary seat.

On 25 August 2008 local Chinese daily ''[[Sin Chew Daily]]'' reported a speech made by Ahmad Ismail on the evening of 23 August 2008 at [[Kampung Pelet]] to campaign for Arif Shah, in which he allegedly stated [[Malaysian Chinese]] were "immigrants" and "squatters", and could not have equal rights.&lt;ref name="The Sun details"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters via Yahoo"&gt;{{cite news|date=9 September 2008 | url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/137/20080910/362/twl-malaysia-ruling-party-suspends-offic_1.html| title=Malaysia ruling party suspends official in race row | agency=[[Reuters]] | publisher=[[Yahoo! News]] | accessdate=10 September 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 6 September statement by Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi, Ahmad was quoted that he merely uttered the remark based on historical facts and claimed it was not a racist statement as reported by ''Sin Chew Daily'', accusing the paper of misinterpreting him.&lt;ref name="Don't create tension"&gt;{{cite news | date=6 September 2008 | url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/9/6/nation/20080906213834 | title=PM: Don't create tension among races | work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] | accessdate=10 October 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005213/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F9%2F6%2Fnation%2F20080906213834 | archive-date=4 June 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite criticism of his remark in the by-election and expressing regret that it resulted in controversy, Ahmad remained defiant and refused to apologise. In a further outburst during a press conference on 8 September, Ahmad seditiously warned the Chinese community not to seek political power:&lt;ref name="AFP via Yahoo"&gt;{{cite news|date=9 September 2008 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080909/wl_asia_afp/malaysiapoliticsrace_080909145027| title=Malaysia faces race row over 'anti-Chinese' comments | agency = [[Agence France-Presse]] | publisher = [[Yahoo! News]] |  accessdate=10 September 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSN news"&gt;{{cite news | date = 9 September 2008 | url = http://news.my.msn.com/regional/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1667156 | title = Malaysia faces race row over 'anti-Chinese' comments | agency = [[Agence France-Presse]] | publisher = [[MSN|MSN Malaysia News]] | accessdate = 10 October 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080917012749/http://news.my.msn.com/regional/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1667156 | archive-date = 17 September 2008 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Straits Times"&gt;{{cite news|date = 9 September 2008 |url = http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/SE%2BAsia/Story/STIStory_276781.html | title = Official to be punished | work = [[The Straits Times]] |  accessdate=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The patience of the Malays and Muslims has a limit. Do not push us to the wall, as when we turn back we will be forced to push the Chinese in the interests of our own survival [...] The Chinese should not try to be like the [[Jews]] in [[United States|America]]. It is not enough they control the economy, now they want political control."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following a meeting with Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi on 9 September,&lt;ref name="Meeting Utusan"&gt;{{cite news|date = 9 September 2008 |url = http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/arkib.asp?y=2008&amp;dt=0909&amp;pub=utusan_malaysia&amp;sec=terkini&amp;pg=bt_10.htm&amp;arc=hive |language=Malay| title = Ahmad Ismail jumpa PM di Putrajaya  | publisher = [[Utusan Malaysia]] | quote = ''Ketua UMNO Bahagian Bukit Bendera, Datuk Ahmad Ismail tiba di pejabat Perdana Menteri di sini pukul 12.50 tengah hari ini untuk mengadakan pertemuan dengan Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. [...] Beliau dipanggil oleh Perdana Menteri untuk memberi penjelasan mengenai tindak-tanduknya selepas satu ucapannya berhubung kedudukan orang Cina sebelum merdeka menimbulkan keretakan politik Barisan Nasional (BN).''| accessdate=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad would later be quoted in stating Malays were "frustrated" and that Malay "dignity" was at stake, remaining convinced that he is more nationalistic defending the Malays rather than being racist:&lt;ref name="AFP via Yahoo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSN news"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Half the Chinese say I'm a racist but most Malays say I'm a nationalist defending my race [...] What I see now is a rise of the Malay people, and I feel we should capitalise on the strength, the support we get from the Malay people... I know they are with me."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Reaction to His Comments ====
Revelations of Ahmad Ismail's comments during and after the by-election drew widespread criticism predominantly from the Chinese community. On 27 August, the youth wing of the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA) demanded an apology from Ahmad, with secretary-general [[Wee Ka Siong]] stating Ahmad had angered the Chinese as well as other non-Malay communities; Wee had also received numerous complaints from the Chinese community in the past two days.&lt;ref name="Star MCA Youth"&gt;{{cite news | date = 9 September 2008 | url = http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/8/27/nation/20080827152034 | title = MCA Youth want apology from Umno chief for racist statement | author = Sim Leoi Leoi | work = [[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] | accessdate = 10 October 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005227/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F8%2F27%2Fnation%2F20080827152034 | archive-date = 4 June 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 September, [[Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia|Gerakan]] president [[Koh Tsu Koon]] announced Penang Gerakan has dissociated itself from UMNO's Penang branch, holding leaders of UMNO Penang accountable for failing to condemn Ahmad's conduct:&lt;ref name="MT Gerakan"&gt;{{cite news|date = 9 September 2008 |url = http://www.malaysiatoday.com/Latest-News/we-no-longer-want-to-be-associated-with-penang-umno-dr-koh.html | title =  We no longer want to be associated with Penang Umno – Dr Koh | work = Zen | publisher = [[Malaysia Today]] | accessdate = 10 October 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We no longer want to be associated with Penang UMNO. We condemned the statement and irresponsible behaviour by Ahmad and his supporters. We are also extremely disappointed and saddened by the fact that many Penang UMNO leaders were present and condoned such irresponsible and insensitive statement and behaviour. He had twisted and turned a personal mistake into a conflict and crisis among BN component parties and the communities."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Views among members of UMNO were less conclusive. Following revelations of Ahmad's comments in the by-election, Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi stated party leaders expressed "regret and anger" over Ahmad Ismail's remark, as UMNO considered actions to be taken against Ahmad.&lt;ref name="AFP via Yahoo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSN news"/&gt; Former Law Minister [[Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz]] and former Prime Minister [[Mahathir bin Mohamad|Mahathir Mohammad]] voiced similar views that Ahmad Ismail should be held accountable for his remarks and issue an apology.&lt;ref name="Star Nazri M"&gt;{{cite news |date = 6 September 2008 |url = http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/9/6/nation/20080906143533 |language = Malay |title = No harm in saying sorry: Nazri |author = V.

==== Suspension from UMNO ====
In 2008, UMNO imposed a suspension on Ahmad for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=358360|title=Ahmad Accepts Umno Supreme Council's Decision|date=10 September 2008 |agency=Bernama|accessdate=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reactions to His Suspension ===
However stronger action than had been expected in a bid to soothe growing anger from the Chinese community and among parties in [[Barisan Nasional]] ruling coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=9 September 2008 |url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/137/20080910/362/twl-malaysia-ruling-party-suspends-offic_1.html |title=Malaysia ruling party suspends official in race row |publisher=Reuters via Yahoo! News }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 September 2008 Sin Chew Daily reporter Tan Hoon Cheng who reported the speech made by Ahmad Ismail, had been arrested under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] at 8.30pm at her home in Bukit Mertajam, Penang.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=13 September 2008| title=Sin Chew reporter released after one day under ISA detention |url=http://www.thenutgraph.com/sin-chew-reporter-released-after-one-day-under-isa-detention|publisher=The Nut Graph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=12 September 2008| title=Sin Chew Reporter Picked Up Under ISA|url=http://www.mysinchew.com/node/16188|publisher=Sin Chew}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCA, a component party of the Barisan National, has expressed shock that Ahmad Ismail, who made racist remarks has not been taken to task but reporter Tan Hoon Cheng, who wrote about the incident, has been arrested instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=28 January 2010|title=Press statement by MCA's Datuk Dr Ng Yen Yen|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/8938-media-statement-by-wanita-mca-chairman-and-minister-of-womenfamily-and-comminity-development-in-response-to-the-isa-arrests-of-sin-chew-reporter-tan-hoon-cheng|publisher=The Malaysian Insider|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323155603/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/8938-media-statement-by-wanita-mca-chairman-and-minister-of-womenfamily-and-comminity-development-in-response-to-the-isa-arrests-of-sin-chew-reporter-tan-hoon-cheng|archive-date=23 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The perpetrator who vowed to conduct a nationwide roadshow on his remarks without any remorse is still at large," MCA vice-president Datuk Ong Tee Keat said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=14 September 2008|title=Sin Chew reporter goes home a day after ISA arrest|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?sec=nation&amp;file=/2008/9/14/nation/2025921|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|access-date=5 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011095346/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?sec=nation&amp;file=%2F2008%2F9%2F14%2Fnation%2F2025921|archive-date=11 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business ==
In 1995, Peninsular Metroworks {{h:title|Private Limited|Sdn Bhd|}} was founded with Ahmad Ismail as its executive chairman.
The company was a special purpose vehicle, intended to receive concession to develop the [[Penang Outer Ring Road]] (PORR), a project which was subsequently delayed by the federal government in 2008 following the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 general election]].&lt;ref name="The Sun details"/&gt; Additionally, a majority stake in Peninsular Metroworks was indirectly linked to Ahmad Ismail: A 55% stake in the company was held in its early years by Nadi Senandung Sdn Bhd, which Ahmad was the director of; the remaining 45% was held by Setegap Bhd and Kumpulan Pinang Holdings Sdn Bhd, the latter a full subsidiary of Yayasan Bumiputra Pulau Pinang {{h:title|Limited|Bhd|}}.&lt;ref name="The Sun details"/&gt;

Ahmad Ismail was also the director of Popular Profile Sdn Bhd, which the Penang Development Corporation believed had wrongfully taken and kept RM500,000 from the state in a botched land transaction for [[Bukit Minyak]] in 1998, before winding up in 2005; Ahmad was believed to have cut links with the company in 1998.&lt;ref name="The Sun details"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Star PDC"&gt;{{cite news |date = 3 September 2008 |url = http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/9/3/nation/20080903173006 |title = PDC lodges report against Ahmad and former company |author = Andrea Filmer |work = [[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |accessdate = 10 October 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005259/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F9%2F3%2Fnation%2F20080903173006 |archive-date = 4 June 2011 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A police report was lodged by Penang Development Corporation on 3 September 2008.&lt;ref name="The Sun details"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Star PDC"/&gt;

Crossback Arowana Farm at Bukit Merah Perak is Ahmad's latest business venture. He is a major shareholder for this golden arowana breeding farm and most of his pricey arowanas are exported to Mainland China.

== Sports ==
In addition to interests in politics and business, Ahmad Ismail was also the president of the Malaysian Sepak Takraw Association.&lt;ref name="The Sun details"/&gt; During the [[2007 Southeast Asian Games]] in [[Korat]], [[Thailand]], Ahmad led the pullout of Malaysia's [[sepak takraw]] team at the last minute.&lt;ref name="The Sun details"/&gt;

'''Arthur Joseph Rooney Sr.''' (January 27, 1901 – August 25, 1988), often referred to as "The Chief", was the founding owner of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], an [[American football]] franchise in the [[National Football League]] (NFL), from 1933 until his death.  Rooney is a member of the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]], was an Olympic qualifying boxer, and was part or whole owner in several track sport venues and Pittsburgh area pro teams.  He was the first president of the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1933 to 1974, and the first chairman of the team from 1933 to 1988.

==Family history==
Rooney's great-grandparents, James and Mary Rooney, were [[Irish Catholic]]s who [[Emigration|emigrated]] from [[Newry]] in [[County Down]], Ireland to Canada during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish potato famine]] in the 1840s. While living in [[Montreal]], the Rooneys had a son, Arthur (who would become Art Rooney's grandfather). James and Mary later moved to [[Ebbw Vale]], [[Wales]], where the iron industry was flourishing, taking their son Arthur, then 21, with them. This Arthur Rooney married Catherine Regan (who was also Irish Catholic), in Wales, and they had a son, Dan. Two years after Dan Rooney was born, the family moved back to Canada and eventually ended up in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] in 1884. Along the way the family grew to include nine children of which Dan was the second.&lt;ref name="Ruanaidh2-5"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rooney |first1=Arthur J. (Jr.) |last2=McHugh |first2=Roy |title=Ruanaidh:The Story of Art Rooney and his clan |year=2008 |publisher=artrooneyjr.com |isbn=978-0-9814760-3-2 |pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Rooney remained in the Pittsburgh area, and eventually opened a saloon in the [[Monongahela Valley]] coal town of [[Coulter, Pennsylvania]] (or Coultersville). This is where Dan Rooney met and wed Margaret "Maggie" Murray, who was the daughter of a coal miner, and where the couple's first son, Arthur Joseph Rooney, was born. Dan and Maggie would eventually settle their family in Pittsburgh's [[North Side (Pittsburgh)|North Side]] in 1913, where they bought a three-story building at the corner of Corey Street and General Robinson Street. Dan operated a cafe and saloon out of the first floor with the family living above. The building was located just a block from [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park]], which had been home to the [[History of the Pittsburgh Pirates#1901–1969|Pittsburgh Pirates]] baseball team until [[1909 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1909]].&lt;ref name="Ruanaidh2-5" /&gt;

==Education and athletics==
Rooney attended St. Peter's Catholic School in Pittsburgh, [[Duquesne University]] Prep School, then several semesters at [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania|Indiana Normal School]] before completing a final year at [[Temple University]] on an athletic scholarship.&lt;ref name="post-gazette.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sports/steelers/from-the-pg-archives-rooney-unique-in-pro-football-hall-of-fame-503918/ |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |first=Vince |last=Johnson |title=From the PG Archives: Rooney Unique in Pro Football Hall of Fame |date=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After graduation, he dedicated himself to sports, winning the AAU welterweight belt in 1918 and tried out for the 1920 Olympic Team,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanmemorabilia.com/Auction_Item.asp?Auction_ID=56181]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; he played minor league baseball for both the [[Flint Vehicles|Flint, Michigan "Vehicles"]] and the [[Wheeling Stogies|Wheeling, West Virginia "Stogies"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=rooney001art |title=Art Rooney Register Statistics &amp; History – Baseball-Reference.com |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1925 he served as Wheeling's player-manager and led the [[Middle Atlantic League]] in games, hits, runs, stolen bases and finished 2nd in batting average as his brother Dan Rooney (Wheelings catcher that year) finished 3rd in BA.  Art also played halfback for the semi-pro Pittsburgh "Hope Harvey" and "Majestic Radio" clubs which he later took over and renamed the [[J.P. Rooneys]] before purchasing an NFL franchise for $2,500 in 1933.&lt;ref name="post-gazette.com" /&gt;

Rooney's affiliation with the [[National Football League]] (NFL) began in 1933 when he paid a $2,500 franchise fee to found a club based in the city of Pittsburgh. He had named his new team the "Pirates" which was also the name of the city's long-established [[Major League Baseball]] [[Pittsburgh Pirates|club]] of which Rooney was a fan since a childhood spent in the shadow of the team's stadium.

Since the league's inception in 1920, the NFL had wanted a team in Pittsburgh due to the city's already-long history with [[American football|football]] as well as the popularity of the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football]] team, an [[NCAA]] national championship contender during this period. The league was finally able to take advantage of [[Pennsylvania]] relaxing their [[blue laws]] that prior to 1933 prohibited sporting events from taking place on Sundays, when most NFL games take place.

In 1936, Rooney won a [[Parlay (gambling)|parlay]] at [[Saratoga Race Course]], which netted him about $160,000. He used the winnings to hire a coach, [[Joe Bach]], give contracts to his players and almost win a championship. The winnings funded the team until 1941 when he sold the franchise to NY playboy Alex Thompson. Thompson wanted to move the franchise to Boston so he could be within a five-hour train ride of his club. At the same time, the Philadelphia Eagles ran into financial problems. Rooney used the funds from the sale of franchise to get a 70% interest in the Eagles, the other 30% held by Rooney friend and future NFL commissioner, Bert Bell. Bell and Rooney agreed to trade places with Thompson. Bell took the role of President of the Steelers that he relinquished to Rooney in 1946 when Bell became Commissioner. Rooney got his good friend and his sister's father in law, Barney McGinley, to buy Bell's shares. Barney's son Jack, Art's brother in law, retained the McGinley interest that passed to his heirs when he died in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tucker |first1=Murray |title=Screamer: The Forgotten Voice of the Pittsburgh Steelers |isbn=978-0595471256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooney sent shock waves through the NFL by signing [[Byron White|Byron "Whizzer" White]] to a record-breaking $15,000 contract in 1938. This move, however, did not bring the Pirates a winning season, and White left the team for the [[Detroit Lions]] the following year. The club did not have a season above .500 until 1942, the year after they were renamed the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].

During World War II, the Steelers had some financial difficulties and were merged with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] [[Steagles|in 1943]] and the [[Chicago Cardinals]] [[Card-Pitt|in 1944]].

After the war, Rooney became team president. He longed to bring an NFL title to [[Pittsburgh]] but was never able to beat the powerhouse teams, like the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Green Bay Packers]]. The Steelers also struggled with playing in a city and era where baseball was king and were treated as something of a joke compared to the Pirates. The team also made some questionable personnel calls at the time such as cutting a then-unknown [[Johnny Unitas]] in training camp (Unitas would go on to a [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] career with the [[Baltimore Colts]]) and trading their [[1965 NFL Draft|first round pick in the 1965 draft]] to the [[Chicago Bears]] (who would draft [[Dick Butkus]] with the pick), among others.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ArtRooneyStatueHeinzFieldGateD.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Art Rooney statue outside of [[Heinz Field]] in Pittsburgh. The "Gate D" sign behind the statue is the last surviving [[relic]] from the Steelers former home, [[Three Rivers Stadium]].]]   --&gt;Nevertheless, Rooney was popular with owners as a mediator, which would carry over to his son [[Dan Rooney]]. He was the only owner to vote against moving the rights of the [[New York Yanks]] to [[Dallas, Texas]] after the [[1951 NFL season|1951 season]] due to concerns of [[racism]] in the [[Southern United States|South]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;''75 Seasons: The Complete Story of the National Football League'', pg. 103&lt;/ref&gt; (Ultimately, the [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]] failed after one year, and the rights were moved to [[Baltimore]], where the team became the [[Baltimore Colts]]. [[Indianapolis Colts|The team]] now [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|plays in Indianapolis]].) In 1963, along with Bears owner [[George Halas]], Rooney was one of two owners to vote for the [[1925 NFL Championship controversy|1925 NFL Championship]] to be reinstated to the long-defunct [[Pottsville Maroons]].

==Pittsburgh Penguins==
As a pillar of the community in many aspects, Rooney was asked to lend his considerable influence in the city's bid to reclaim a [[National Hockey League|NHL]] franchise during the league's expansion in 1967.  Although Pittsburgh enjoyed championship hockey with the professional but "minor league" [[Pittsburgh Hornets]] since its NHL franchise (the [[Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL)|Pirates hockey team]]) disbanded in 1930 from the effects of the [[Great Depression]], many city leaders were pushing for the region to become more "major league" suggesting that Mr. Rooney use his influence in the sports industry to have the league award Pittsburgh a franchise.  Rooney proved his worth and from 1967 until the early 1970s was a part owner of the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pittsburghhockey.net/old-site/PensPages/66-69ERA/67Expansion.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510131830/http://pittsburghhockey.net/old-site/PensPages/66-69ERA/67Expansion.html |archivedate=2012-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yS1UAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QjoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=pittsburgh%20mcgregor&amp;pg=7126,3658716 |title=Lawrence Journal-World – Google News Archive Search |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homestead Grays==
In a 1981 interview by the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' Rooney related that "from time to time he had helped financially support the Negro League team, the [[Homestead Grays]], and . . . was a better baseball fan than football fan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KKkcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=e2MEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=art%20rooney&amp;pg=4092,6282476 |title=The Pittsburgh Press – Google News Archive Search |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Track sports==
Rooney also acquired the [[Yonkers Raceway]] in 1972, the Palm Beach Kennel Club, Green Mountain Kennel Club in Vermont, Shamrock Stables in Maryland and owned the [[Liberty Bell Park Racetrack]] outside Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sports/steelers/from-the-pg-archives-steelers-art-rooney-in-retrospect-506028/#ixzz2cJNb9100 |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |first=Gary |last=Tuma |title=From the PG Archives: Steelers' Art Rooney in retrospect |date=October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Following the [[AFL–NFL merger]] in 1970, the Steelers agreed to leave the NFL Eastern Conference and joined the AFC Central Division.

Through expert scouting, the Steelers became a power. In 1972, they began a remarkable 8–year run of playoff appearances, and thirteen straight years of winning seasons, including three additional playoff berths. In Rooney's 41st season as owner, the club won the [[Super Bowl]]. During Rooney's lifetime the team also had [[Super Bowl]] victories following the 1975, 1978 and 1979 seasons.  They also won the Super Bowl in the 2005 and 2008 seasons, making the Steelers the first team following the AFL–NFL merger to win six Super Bowls.

Following the Steelers' victory in [[Super Bowl IX]], Rooney stepped down from day-to-day management of the team, but remained the ultimate source of authority until his death. [[Dan Rooney|Dan]], his son, took over as team president. Rooney died from complications of a stroke on August 25, 1988. An August 1987 ''Pittsburgh Press'' story stated that Rooney never missed a Hall of Fame induction ceremony in all 25 years, and that he was asked to present his third inductee, [[John Henry Johnson]] that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LKkcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OWMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=rooney%20hall%20of%20fame&amp;pg=6978,412908 |title=The Pittsburgh Press – Google News Archive Search |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In memory of "The Chief", Steelers wore a patch on the left shoulder of their uniforms with Rooney's initials '''AJR''' for the entire season. The team [[1988 Pittsburgh Steelers season|ended up finishing 5-11]], their worst record since a 1–13 showing in [[1969 Pittsburgh Steelers season|1969]]. He is buried at the [[North Side (Pittsburgh)|North Side]] Catholic [[Cemetery]] in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.post-gazette.com/Steelers/19980830chief3.asp ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

In 1964, he was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]. [[Duquesne University]] named their football field in his honor in 1993. In 1999 Rooney ranked 81st on the ''[[Sporting News]]''' "100 Most Powerful Sports Figures of the 20th Century" list. A statue of his likeness graces the entrance to the home of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], [[Heinz Field]]. The street that runs adjacent to Heinz Field on Pittsburgh's North Side is named "Art Rooney Avenue" in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Map of Art Rooney Avenue |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?q=art+rooney+avenue+pittsburgh+pa&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.447098,-80.014163&amp;spn=0.00307,0.004056&amp;hnear=Art+Rooney+Ave,+Pittsburgh,+Pennsylvania&amp;gl=us&amp;sqi=2&amp;t=h&amp;z=18&amp;vpsrc=6 |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barnes |first=Tom |title=There has been development near the new stadiums, but no one is sure what will happen between them |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/steelers/20010824hdevelop0824P.asp |accessdate=December 16, 2011 |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=August 1, 2001 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63yxoR5WQ?url=http://www.post-gazette.com/steelers/20010824hdevelop0824P.asp |archivedate=December 16, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he was inducted as a "pioneer" into the American Football Association's Semi-Pro Football Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2010 Hall of Fame listing |url=http://americanfootballassn.com/forms/2010HallofFameListing.pdf |publisher=americanfootballassn.com/ American Football Association |accessdate=December 16, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63yyR3crb?url=http://americanfootballassn.com/forms/2010HallofFameListing.pdf |archivedate=December 16, 2011 |format=PDF |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Rooney's life, the Steelers would often use a late-round draft pick on a player from a local college like [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pitt]], [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] or [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]]. Though these players rarely made the team, this practice was intended to appeal to local fans and players. The team has occasionally employed this practice after Rooney's death, however, they now focus more on talent than geography throughout the entire draft. Rooney also supposedly liked players from [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] due to his [[Irish Catholic]] background, which some say explains why he allegedly had the team keep Notre Dame alumnus and wounded [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] veteran [[Rocky Bleier]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}  Bleier would go on to become one of the key members of the team's success in the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

'''Bashir Ahmad''' (12 February 1940 – 6 February 2009) was a successful businessman and a [[Scottish National Party]] politician. He made history when he was elected to the [[Scottish Parliament]] to represent the [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Glasgow region]] at the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 election]], as the first [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] to be elected from [[Asian-Scots]], [[Mohammedan|Muslim]] and non-White backgrounds.&lt;ref name="BBC News death"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7876038.stm |title=Scotland's first Muslim MSP dies |work=[[BBC News]] |date=6 February 2009 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ahmad was born in [[Amritsar]], [[British India]] on 12 February 1940. In 1961, at the age of 21, he emigrated to Scotland from Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Scotsman interview July 2007"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/keeping-the-faith-1-907247 |title=Keeping the Faith |first=Jim |last=Gilchrist |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=2 July 2007 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served five terms as President of the Pakistan Welfare Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5133456.stm|title=Scotland set for first Asian MSP |work=BBC News |date=30 June 2006 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

[[Image:Scottish Parliament flags half-staff.jpg|thumb|Flags outside of the Scottish Parliament flying at half-mast following the death of Bashir Ahmad MSP]]

Ahmnad joined the SNP in 1992. In 1995, he founded [[Asian Scots for Independence]] to attract more [[Asian-Scots]] to the party. When Bashir launched Scots Asians for Independence at the SNP conference in 1995, he gave a speech saying "it isn't important where you come from, what matters is where we are going together as a nation"&lt;ref name="scotsman obituary"&gt;{{cite news|last=Davison |first=Phil |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/bashir-ahmad-1-828488 |title=Bashir Ahmad |work=The Scotsman |date= 10 February 2009|accessdate=6 June 2018 |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired from business in 2003 to devote himself to [[Politics of Scotland|politics]]. In [[Glasgow City Council election, 2003]], he defeated Labour to become the Councillor for the Pollokshields East ward.

Upon his selection as second on the SNP's Glasgow list, Ahmad said: "The lack of any Asian or ethnic minority voice in the Scottish Parliament has been felt deeply in my community. But SNP members have righted that wrong. By doing so, they have proved that the SNP aspires to lead a Scottish Parliament that will represent all of Scotland – a truly national parliament. I firmly believe the SNP can now earn the trust of the Asian community throughout Scotland and that this will be a bond that endures for generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12772876.Society__The_race_for_Holyrood/ |title=Society: The race for Holyrood |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |date=26 March 2007|accessdate=6 June 2018 |location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 elections]], Ahmad was elected to the [[Scottish Parliament]] on the Glasgow regional list. He thus became the first non-white and first Muslim [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6622915.stm |title=First Asian MSP goes to Holyrood |work=BBC News |date=4 May 2007 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwitness.co.uk/scottish/0706s-01.htm] Interview with The iWitness, Scotland's Muslim Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6622865.stm] BBC election report, Friday, 4 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On the opening day of the [[3rd Scottish Parliament]], he wore traditional Pakistani clothing and took his oath of office using both the [[Urdu]] and [[English language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6638173.stm |title=MSPs at their best for ceremony |first=Andrew |last=Black |work=BBC News |date=9 May 2007 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6637097.stm |title=New members sworn in at Holyrood |work=BBC News |date=9 May 2007 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmad lead the bill on making [[forced marriage]]s a criminal offence in Scotland and participated in a humanitarian campaign for Scottish hospitals to treat the most serious casualties of [[Israel]]'s attacks on the [[Gaza Strip]], particularly women and children with life-threatening burns or other wounds.&lt;ref name="scotsman obituary"/&gt;
He was a member of the Scottish Parliament's [[Public Petitions Committee]], which decides which action should be taken on petitions submitted by individuals, groups or organisations.&lt;ref name="scotsman obituary"/&gt;

Ahmad died of a heart attack on 6 February 2009 at the age of 68.&lt;ref name="BBC News death"/&gt; His funeral was held at the [[Glasgow Central Mosque]] and he was buried in [[Cathcart Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/politicians-pay-respects-at-funeral-of-msp-ahmad-1-1303875 |title=Politicians pay respects at funeral of MSP Ahmad |first1=Lucinda |last1=Cameron |first2=Sam |last2=Reeves |work=[[Scotland on Sunday]] |date=7 February 2009 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Big Soda''' is a term used by the media&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/may2006/pi20060504_428474.htm "Big Soda's Sticky End." ''Business Week.'']&lt;/ref&gt; and various activist groups&lt;ref&gt;"Big Soda vs. Our Kids: Better Beware of Benzene in Soda Pop." ''CommonDreams.org Newsletter''[http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0312-24.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;, including [[CrossFit]] to describe the [[soft drink]] industry as a collective entity.

The term connotes the business and [[lobbying]] power of soft drink companies who, like [[Big Oil]] and [[Big Tobacco]], would use that power to influence politicians and voters.&lt;ref&gt;http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/big-soda-echoing-big-tobacco-s-tactics-report/306232/&lt;/ref&gt;

Big Soda usually refers to the giants of the soft drink industry, [[The Coca-Cola Company]], [[PepsiCo]], and to a lesser extent, the [[Dr Pepper Snapple Group]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/opinion/fight-big-soda.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Business Today''''' is an American, [[non-profit]] student organization that seeks to bridge the communication gap between college students and business executives. The organization publishes a magazine and hosts three national conferences: the International Conference, the Her Ventures Conference and the Designation Conference.

''Business Today'' is headquartered in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], and run by [[Princeton University]] undergraduates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/odus/activities/organizations/directory/ Princeton University student groups listing]&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has 15 student officers who commit their time to running the logistics, programs and new strategic initiatives. Past Business Today alumni sit on the company's Board of Trustees to provide guidance.

==Business Today Magazine==
''Business Today'' is an American magazine created by and for college students. It was founded in 1968 by three students at [[Princeton University]]—Jonathan Perel, [[Steve Forbes]], and Michael Mims. Currently, ''Business Today'' is the largest student-run magazine in the United States.  It is published twice a year, and has a distribution base of over 200,000 college students and business executives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ulm.edu/lyceum/forbes.html ULM Presidential Lyceum Series]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Conference==
Founded in 1974, the Business Today International Conference is the organization's largest and signature event. The conference brings 150 distinguished undergraduate students from around the world together with current business and world leaders to discuss and share perspectives on relevant business issues. Past keynote speakers at the conference have included [[Gerald Ford]], [[Andrea Jung]], and [[Henry Kissinger]]. 

In 2017, the 43rd Annual International Conference attracted over 2000 applications and the conference itself focused on the theme of Redefining Innovation. Speakers included [[Brad Smith (American lawyer) | Brad Smith]], President of Microsoft, 

It is the largest conference of its kind in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryvillecollege.edu/news/news.asp?id=1336&amp;pgID=1354 "Maryville College Junior Participates in Prestigious Business Today Conference" by Karen B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5446">A '''consultant''' (from {{lang-la|consultare}} "to discuss") is a [[professional]] who provides professional or expert advice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/consultant |title=Consultant &amp;#124; Define Consultant at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date=2004-03-09 |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a particular area such as security ([[information security|electronic]] or [[physical security|physical]]), [[management]], [[accountancy]], [[law]], [[human resources]], [[marketing]] (and [[public relations]]), [[finance]], [[engineering]], [[science]] or any of many other specialized fields.

A consultant is usually an expert or a professional in a specific field and has a wide knowledge of the subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Pieter P. Tordoir (1995). ''The professional knowledge economy: the management and integration services in business organizations.'' p.140.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of consultant outside the medical sphere (where the term is used specifically for a grade of doctor) can fall under one of two general categories:
* Internal consultant – someone who operates within an organization but is available to be consulted on areas of specialism by other departments or individuals (acting as clients); or
* External consultant – someone who is employed externally (either by a firm or some other agency) whose expertise is provided on a temporary basis, usually for a fee.  As such this type of consultant generally engages with multiple and changing clients.

The overall impact of a consultant is that clients have access to deeper levels of expertise than would be feasible for them to retain in-house, and may purchase only as much service from the outside consultant as desired.

== Qualifications ==
{{unreferenced-section|date=March 2017}}
Consultant [[Peter Block]] defines a consultant as "someone who has influence over an individual, group, or organization, but who has no direct authority to implement changes." He contrasts this with a ''surrogate manager'' who is a person who "acts on behalf of, or in place of, a manager." The key difference is that a consultant never makes decisions for the individual or group, whereas a surrogate manager does make decisions.

Accredited Associates are bound by a [[Code of Ethics]] that requires the consultant to only provide “practical advice that works” — by “Analysing as a Generalist and Solving as a Specialist” — using the skills and experience of a sub-contracted fellow Associate, thus at all times providing the client with the best available advice and support.

There is no single qualification to be a consultant other than those laid down in relation to medical &amp; engineering personnel who have attained this level-degree in it.

Internationally the accreditation of Management Consultants is overseen by higher education training and accreditation organizations.

The International Council of Management Consulting Institutes (ICMCI) was founded in 1987 and has around 50 member institutes covering the globe. The award of [[Certified management consultant|Certified Management Consultant (CMC)]] status is its internationally recognized accreditation (in some countries like the US, conforms to ISO/IEC 17024:2003 standards) that is not specific to the technical content of the consultant's practice.  For instance this could be held equally by a [[Human resources|Human Resources (HR)]] expert or a [[chemical engineer]] operating as management consultants in their field(s) of expertise. There are about 10,000 CMCs worldwide.

Chartered Institute of Management Consultants (CIMC) is a not-for-profit professional body chartered federally under Letters Patent granted by the Government of Canada. CIMC is also chartered under the Laws of the State of Delaware, USA. CIMC is also registered with the National Certification Commission, USA. The CIMC award Chartered Management Consultant Ch.MC designation as a global management credential.

[[International Federation of Consulting Engineers]] (FIDIC) is a Federation whose members are national associations of Consulting Engineers.

'''Chrysler House''' is a 23-story, {{convert|99|m|abbr=on}} [[skyscraper]] located at 719 Griswold Street in [[Downtown Detroit|Downtown]] [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. The [[Class A office|class-A office building]] is adjacent to the [[Penobscot Building]] in the heart of the U.S. designated [[Detroit Financial District]]. It is used as an [[office building]], with [[retail]] space on the street level.

==History==
The building was constructed between 1910 and 1912&lt;ref name="austin"&gt;[http://historicdetroit.org/building/dime-building/ Dime Building]. ''Historic Detroit''. Retrieved on April 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and known for many years as the '''Dime Building'''. When completed, the tower was named the Dime Savings Bank Building for its primary tenant. It was later renamed the Commonwealth Building, briefly known as Griswold Place. It became the Dime Building again in 2002, before being renamed in 2012.

The original [[Lincoln Highway|Lincoln Highway Association]] national headquarters occupied office 2115 on the 21st floor from 1913 to 1928.

For several years through 1983, the building housed the headquarters of Bank of the Commonwealth until the bank merged with [[Comerica]]. In 2002, a $40-million renovation was completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/dime-building Dime Building]. ''Detroit Historical Society''. Retrieved on April 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, [[Quicken Loans]] founder [[Dan Gilbert (businessman)|Dan Gilbert]] purchased the building along with the nearby [[The Qube (Detroit)|Qube]], [[First National Building]] and [[Wright-Kay Building]].&lt;ref name="quicken"&gt;{{cite news| title=Dan Gilbert scoops up three more downtown Detroit buildings, fourth on the way| date=27 December 2011| author=Michael Wayland| url=http://www.mlive.com/business/detroit/index.ssf/2011/12/dan_gilbert_scoops_up_three_mo.html| work=[[Grand Rapids Press]]| publisher=mlive.com| accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 2012, Gilbert and [[Chrysler Group LLC]] chairman [[Sergio Marchionne]] announced that Chrysler will move its Great Lakes Business Center and some executive offices, with approximately 70 employees, into the two top floors of the building. As part of the lease, the building was renamed for the company.&lt;ref name="chrysler"&gt;{{cite news| title=Chrysler's Dime Building Move A Strong Symbol Of Detroit Commitment| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kiley/chrysler-dime-building-detroit-chrysler-house_b_1464466.html?ref=business| publisher=[[Huffington Post]]| author=David Kiley| date=30 April 2012| accessdate=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The tower was designed in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical architectural style]] by [[Daniel Burnham]].&lt;ref name="aia"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Hill, Eric J. and John Gallagher | title=AIA Detroit: The American Institute of Architects Guide to Detroit Architecture | year=2002 | publisher=Wayne State University Press | isbn=0-8143-3120-3}} P. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author= Sharoff, Robert | title=American City: Detroit Architecture, 1845-2005| publisher=Wayne State University Press| year=2005| isbn=0-8143-3270-6| authorlink= Robert Sharoff}} P. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The steel-framed structure is faced with white glazed brick and terra cotta trim. The most distinctive feature is the central light court which begins on the third floor and creates a U-shaped floor plan on the upper office floors.&lt;ref name="aia"/&gt; This feature can be seen in an earlier version on Burnham's Miner's National Bank Building, now Citizens Bank financial Center, completed one year earlier in downtown [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]]. Miner's National Bank is a similar, but smaller-scale design with the main banking hall in the space below the light court and featuring a large skylight. A later expansion of the building altered the U-shape of the upper floors.&lt;ref name="emporis"&gt;{{cite web| title=Citizens Bank Financial Center| url=http://www.emporis.com/building/citizensbankfinancialcenter-wilkesbarre-pa-usa| work=Emporis | accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a subsequent renovation, the lower two floors were refaced with gray granite and a pediment above the central entrance and cornice were removed.

The '''Cook–Craigie plan''' is an approach to the development process of civil and military aircraft that can dramatically reduce the time needed to bring a new design into service. In the late 1940s, USAF Major Generals [[Laurence C. Craigie]], deputy chief of staff for development, and [[Orval R. Cook]], deputy chief of staff for materiel, proposed that new designs should move directly into the production phase without the construction of prototypes.&lt;ref name="Pike"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/b-58-pc.htm|title = B-58 Primary Construction|accessdate = 2 July 2014|last = Pike|first = John|date = 24 July 2011| work = globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, this approach has been used in an increasing number of aviation projects.

Traditional aircraft design follows a time-honored formula. After the design drawings (or "[[blueprints]]") are prepared, a small series of prototype aircraft are constructed in order to test the concept. Data from the flight tests influences the revisions that are made to the design. If these changes are wide-ranging and/or significant, more prototypes will need to be built. Once the prototype cycle is complete, the development can enter the "pre-production" stage and further evaluation. Once this stage is completed satisfactorily, series production can begin.

The Cook–Craigie plan promoted the elimination of the entire prototype cycle and entering straight into the pre-production stage. If these examples flew as expected, production could start immediately. The plan required considerable confidence in the design from the outset; if the design had an inherent flaw, the jigs used during pre-production would have to be replaced.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The plan seems inherently more risky than the traditional prototype cycle, but Cook and Craigie pointed out that for the advanced designs that were entering service in the late 1940s, any prototype was likely to be so different from the production variant that any data collected could be entirely misleading.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Moreover, since several aircraft designs are typically ordered for competitive testing, the chance that all of the designs would fail is extremely low, and if even one design passes testing, it can immediately enter production.

One of the first designs to use the plan was the [[F-102 Delta Dagger]]&lt;ref name="Combat"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://airtoaircombat.com/background.asp?id=52&amp;bg=225|title = Convair F-106A Delta Dart|accessdate = 15 July 2014|last = Baugher|first = Joseph|date = 18 December 1999 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070204033724/http://www.airtoaircombat.com/background.asp?id=52&amp;bg=225 |archivedate = 4 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=July 2014}}. Although this design had a number of new features, it was based to a large degree on the earlier [[Xf-92|XF-92]] prototype, and thus considered to be a fairly "well understood" design. This confidence proved to be misplaced, as the F-102 underwent a lengthy series of upgrades, and was eventually replaced in service by a redesigned version, the [[F-106 Delta Dart]]. Another example of the Cook–Craigie method is the development of the [[Avro CF-105 Arrow]], which passed through the testing phase with few required changes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

As the potential of [[computer-aided design]] has increased since the 1950s, aircraft designs have generally performed much closer to their original goals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} For example, the production specification of the [[Boeing 777]] was within 20&amp;nbsp;lb of its predicted weight. Today the Cook–Craigie plan is so common that it no longer even has a name.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

'''Sir David Arculus''' (born 2 June 1946),&lt;ref name=Birth&gt;{{cite web|title=Birthday's today|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/archive/2011-6-2.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=31 May 2014|date=2 June 2011|quote=Sir David Arculus, company chairman, 69|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101232957/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/archive/2011-6-2.html|archivedate=1 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2017}} is a British media figure, [[business]]man and advisor to Government who has appeared several times in ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' Power 100, ranked at number 39 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17709-1861705,00.html | work=The Times | location=London | title=30 Sir David Arculus | date=2005-11-07 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educated at [[Bromsgrove School]] (Wendron House) and [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]], [[University of Oxford]] and the [[London Business School]], he started his career as a writer and was a producer for the [[BBC]] from 1968 to 1974. He joined [[EMAP]] in 1972, and took it from being a small regional newspaper publisher to a large media group.  He was involved in launching many new magazines – for instance, ''[[Smash Hits]]'', a journal that printed words to pop songs, which went from an initial circulation of 10,000 to one million within a year, which provided the cash which helped Emap to subsequently become a leader in the world of business communications encompassing magazines, events, exhibitions and data products.

As a result of these successes Arculus worked his way up to Group Managing Director in 1989, leaving Emap in 1997. He subsequently became Chief Operating Officer of [[United News and Media]] and then became Chairman of IPC Media which at the time was Britain’s largest management buy-out.  Arculus also headed [[Earls Court]] and Olympia Ltd and spent nearly ten years as a Non-Executive Director of [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]] plc.

Away from the media sector, he was a Non-Executive Director of [[Severn Trent]] plc from 1996, serving as Chairman from 1998 until 2004. Arculus held a range of further non-executive jobs of which perhaps the most noteworthy was with [[Barclays Bank]] plc from 1997 to 2006.

He joined the Board of [[Telefónica Europe|O2]] plc in 2003, and in 2006 as Chairman was responsible with the management team for the sale of O2 to [[Telefónica]] of Spain.  At £18bn this was the largest cash deal ever done in Europe, and the second biggest in the world.  Following the 2006 merger of O2 and Telefonica he sat on the Board of Telefonica. David has also served as a Director of Barclays and Pearson and of a variety of private equity backed companies and was Chairman of [[ExCeL Exhibition Centre]]

During his career David has also undertaken a number of non-business roles including four years (2002 to 2006) as Tony Blair’s "Red Tape Czar" when he was Chairman of the British Government’s Better Regulation Task Force. During this time he helped bring about a number of regulatory initiatives intended to reduce burdens on business.  These included improved impact assessments; the introduction of common commencement dates and the measurement of administrative burden in the UK economy which led to government imposing a 25% red tape reduction across all departments.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  He also led the effort during the UK Presidency to reduce EU bureaucratic burdens which resulted in the notable claim from MEPs that "the European Parliament now has nothing to do".

Arculus has also been a member of the National Consumer Council and chaired both the [[Royal Institution]] and the Advisory Council of The [[British Library]] as well as being a Trustee of various charitable organisations.

Alongside his role as High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire 2016{{ndash}}2017, David is currently the Chairman of Energy UK.

[[File:Dequindre Cut Detroit a.JPG|thumb|left|Dequindre Cut Greenway looking north.]]

===Dequindre Cut Greenway===
{{Main|Dequindre Cut}}
'''Dequindre Cut Greenway'''  is a non-motorized trail extending from the [[Detroit River]] northward, with the future potential to connect to the Ferndale-Birmingham greenway in [[Oakland County]]. The mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) long trail primarily connects the [[Lafayette Park, Detroit|Lafayette Park]] neighborhood and [[Eastern Market Historic District|Eastern Market]] to the Riverwalk. The [[Greenway (landscape)|greenway]] utilizes half of the corridor, with a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} wide paved path with separate lanes for biking and walking.&lt;ref name=conservancy/&gt;

Construction of phase I of the Dequindre Cut Greenway, extending from the River one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) north to Gratiot Avenue, is complete. Funded by MDOT’s Transportation Enhancement Program and the Community Foundation of Southeast Michigan, this portion of the greenway sets the template for future phases and includes a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} bituminous path; access ramps for bicyclists, pedestrians and emergency vehicles; landscaping; lighting; signage and security cameras. The first phase of the trail officially opened May 14, 2009 with an opening ribbon-cutting ceremony at the Woodbridge Street entrance of the greenway between Orleans Street and St. Aubin Street.

The Dequindre Cut Greenway phase II North project begins at the northern terminus of the phase I at [[Gratiot Avenue]] and continues for over one-half mile to Mack Avenue.  The strategic plan for phase II provides a design approach and project budget that builds on the lessons learned in phase I construction.

The Dequindre Cut is noted for the high quality [[graffiti]] covering the walls of the corridor. The Riverfront Conservancy which operates the greenway will permit current and future painted art work to remain as long as it is not deemed offensive. The trail is one of the city's few public art parks and is a major attraction for urban photographers.&lt;ref name=conservancy/&gt;

A cruise-ship passenger terminal stands on Hart Plaza, adjacent to the Renaissance Center.
In 2003, [[General Motors]] completed a $500 million renovation of the Renaissance Center for its world headquarters which it had purchased in 1996. [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]], Gensler, the [[Smith Hinchman &amp; Grylls|Smith Group]], and Ghafari Associates were among the architects for the renovation.

The Detroit International Riverfront includes a 5½-mile (8.8&amp;nbsp;km) promenade called the River Walk which is to extend from the [[Ambassador Bridge]] to [[Belle Isle (Michigan)|Belle Isle]]. The path is located directly on the river, sometimes bridging it.

Pavilions, fishing piers and benches are located at intervals along the path.&lt;ref name=conservancy/&gt;

The east riverfront promenade connects an area known as Rivertown. It extends along the east riverfront area from the [[Cobo Center]] convention and exhibit facility to the [[Belle Isle Park|Belle Isle State Park]] bridge and includes the [[Renaissance Center]], GM Plaza and Promenade, [[William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor]], [[Stroh Brewery Company|Stroh]] [[River Place Complex (Detroit, Michigan)|River Place]], Chene Park, Mt Elliott Park and [[Gabriel Richard]] Park. The river walk is designed to supplement new retail and residential development, and includes the newly renovated historic [[Alden Park Towers]]. Architect [[Eric J. Hill]] aided in its design.&lt;ref name=conservancy/&gt;

The first {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} of continuous riverfront promenade and two of the four planned pavilions opened to the public on June 6, 2007. Rivard Plaza located at the foot of Rivard Street features a covered seating, a carousel, concessions and bike rentals. Richard Plaza located in Gabriel Richard Park features covered seating, concessions and a butterfly garden. The River Walk is continuous from Joe Louis Arena to Milliken State Park with unfinished sections between the state park and River Place. From River Place the River Walk is then continuous through Mt Elliott Park to the former site of the Uniroyal Tire factory west of Belle Isle. The west riverfront promenade development is not expected to be completed before 2012.  The west riverfront includes the high-rise [[Riverfront Condominiums Detroit|Riverfront Towers]]. The west riverfront promenade will eventually connect to [[River Rouge (Michigan)|River Rouge]] in the southwest side.&lt;ref name=conservancy/&gt;

===William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor===
{{main|William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor}}
'''[[William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor]]''' (formerly ''Tri-Centennial State Park and Harbor'') is a [[state park]] in [[Michigan]], and one of only two state parks located within an urban area. The park consist of the former city-owned St. Aubin Park and Marina. Located just east of downtown [[Detroit]] in the Near-East Riverfront, it covers {{convert|31|acre|ha}} on the [[Detroit River]], and includes a 52-slip harbor of refuge. A {{convert|63|ft|m|adj=on}} conical brick light tower marks the harbor entrance. The park's first phase opened in 2003, included refurbishing of the marina and construction of lighthouse. Construction on the second phase, adjacent to Rivard Plaza, to expand the park started in summer 2008 and was completed in summer 2009.  In fall 2009, the state park was renamed in honor of former Michigan [[Governor of Michigan|Governor]] [[William G. Milliken]].

==Riverfront activities==
[[File:Fireworks DetroitWindsorIntlFreedomFest.jpg|thumb|right|Freedom festival's fireworks]]
Detroit River Days, a five-day festival on the International Riverfront, marked the 2007 opening of the riverfront promenade along the east river leading up to the [[Windsor-Detroit International Freedom Festival|Detroit-Windsor International Freedom Festival]] fireworks. [[Detroit]] and [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] jointly celebrate the multi-day festival the last week of June which draws about 3.5 million visitors during the week in order to commemorate each country's respective [[National Day|National holiday]] - ([[Independence Day (United States)|US Independence Day]] on July 4 and [[Canada Day]] on July 1). The festival began in 1959. It is organized by the Parade Company, a well sponsored not-for-profit organization governed by the Michigan Thanksgiving Parade Foundation.

Traditionally, several days of events were planned, ending with one of the world's largest [[fireworks]] displays,&lt;ref name=Mink&gt;Mink, Randy, and Karen Mink (July 2001).Detroit Turns 300 - Detroit 300 Festival. ''Travel America'', World Publishing Co., Gale Group.&lt;/ref&gt; sponsored by [[Target Corporation|Target]]. In prior years, the fireworks display has been billed as the world's largest.  On the Windsor side, there is a midway consisting of carnival rides and concessions during the festival.  The Midway operates as stand-alone attraction at the end of June, beginning of July.

The [[Detroit Electronic Music Festival]] (DEMF) is an electronic dance music showcase held in Hart Plaza each Memorial Day weekend since 2000. In subsequent years, the similarly themed festivals Movement (2003–2004), Fuse-In (2005) and currently, Movement: Detroit's Electronic Music Festival (2006–present) continue the DEMF's traditions, with each name change reflecting shifts in festival management. All of these festivals featured performances by musicians and DJs, and emphasized the progressive qualities of the culture surrounding electronic music.

The International Riverfront is host to part of the [[Detroit International Jazz Festival]] held in Hart Plaza each Labor Day weekend. Hart Plaza is also the traditional location of rallies to celebrate championships won by Detroit's major sports teams. Both Detroit and Windsor have hosted the [[Red Bull Air Race World Championship]] on the International Riverfront.

[[File:Location-based asset management.png|thumb|500x500px|A critical requirement for distribution software is '''Inventory Visibility''' which includes both internal inventory visibility (above) as well as visibility across the supply chain (vendors and customers)]]
'''Distribution software''' refers to software which manages everything from [[order processing]] and [[inventory]] control to [[accounting]], purchasing and [[customer service]], [[supply chain]] management, sales, [[customer relationship management]], and finance management.

More sophisticated solutions can cover areas such as advanced forecasting and replenishment, warehouse management, pick, pack &amp; shipping, EDI or [[Electronic Data Interchange]], Trade Spend Management and more.

Distribution software helps companies to manage internal and external resources efficiently by minimizing stockouts but ensuring overstocking doesn't occur as well.

Numerous ERP vendors such as [[Acumatica]], [[NAV-X|Microsoft Dynamics NAV-X]], [[Netsuite]], [[Infor|Infor Distribution]], and [[SAP ERP]] offer distribution software as part of their ERP systems.

'''Enrolled agent''' (or '''EA''') is a [[tax advisor]] who is a federally authorized tax practitioner empowered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Enrolled agents represent taxpayers before the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) for tax issues including audits, collections and appeals.

Enrolled agent status is the highest credential awarded by the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;Enrolled Agent Information, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, at [https://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Enrolled-Agents/Enrolled-Agent-Information].&lt;/ref&gt; The EA credential is recognized across all 50 [[U.S. states]]. [[Attorneys in the United States|Attorneys]] and [[Certified Public Accountant|certified public accountants]] (CPAs) are licensed on a state by state basis, and are also empowered by the Department of the Treasury to represent taxpayers before the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Enrolled Agents, "What Is An Enrolled Agent?"&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Association of Enrolled Agents, there are approximately 53,000 practicing EAs in the United States.

==History==
The position of enrolled agent was created as a reaction to fraudulent war loss claims in the wake of the [[American Civil War]] with roots tracing back to the General Deficiency Act of July 7, 1884,&lt;ref&gt;In section 3 of the General Deficiency Act of July 7, 1884, under the heading “War Department,” Congress authorized appropriation of $125,787.03 for “horses and other property lost in the military service prior to July 1, 1881."&lt;/ref&gt; or General Deficiency Appropriation Bill (H.R. 2735), also known as the "Horse Act of 1884", which was signed into law by President [[Chester A. Arthur]] on July 7, 1884. After the Civil War, many citizens faced difficulties in settling claims with the government for property confiscated for use in the war effort. As a result, Congress endowed enrolled agents with the power of advocacy to prepare claims against the government. From 1884 through the early 20th century, this statute remained largely unchanged.

When the [[Revenue Act of 1913]] was passed, signed into law by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] on October 3, 1913, the scope of the enrolled agent was expanded to include claims for monetary relief for citizens whose taxes had become inequitable.  As [[Income tax in the United States|income]], [[Estate tax in the United States|estate]], [[Gift tax in the United States|gift]] and other sources of tax collections became more complex, the role of the enrolled agent increased to include the preparation of the many tax forms that were required. As a result of this complexity, audits became more prevalent and the enrolled agent role evolved into taxpayer representation, promulgating a series of statutes which were combined into a single Treasury Department Circular in February 19, 1921, known as [[Circular 230]], to address "the laws and regulations governing the recognition of agents, attorneys, and other persons representing claimants before the Treasury Department and offices thereof."

==Becoming an enrolled agent==
To become an enrolled agent, an applicant must obtain a [[Preparer Tax Identification Number|PTIN]] and achieve passing scores on all three parts of the [[Special Enrollment Examination]], which covers many aspects of the [[Internal Revenue Code]], or must have worked at the IRS for five consecutive years in a position which regularly engaged in applying and interpreting the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations relating to income, estate, gift, employment, or excise taxes. A [[background check]], including a review of the applicant’s personal and business tax compliance,&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Michael R., Deputy Inspector General for Audit, Office of Professional Responsibility, Memorandum 2006-10-170. [http://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2006reports/200610170fr.html www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2006reports/200610170fr.html].&lt;/ref&gt; is conducted after an applicant files Form 23, ''Application for Enrollment to Practice Before the Internal Revenue Service'', within one year of completing all three parts of the examination.

==Maintaining enrolled agent status==

===Renewal for active enrolled agents===
To qualify for renewal as an enrolled agent, an individual must complete 72 hours of continuing professional education (CPE) every three years, including two hours of ethics or professional conduct in each of the three years.&lt;ref name="seq"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sequoiacpe.com/ea-cpe-requirements|title=Enrolled Agent CPE Requirements|publisher=SequoiaCPE|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent overloading of CPEs in any year of an enrollment cycle, the IRS requires a minimum of 16 hours of CPE every year.&lt;ref name="CPE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mypescpe.com/CPE-Self-Study-CPE-for-Accounting-Audit-Ethics-Tax-CFPs-Etc.cmc?&amp;view=4E|title=EA CPE Requirements|publisher=www.mypescpe.com|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Individuals must renew their PTIN between October 16 and December 31 of each year.

Individuals must file Form 8554, ''Application for Renewal of Enrollment to Practice Before the Internal Revenue Service'', within the applicable renewal period.

Renewal periods are based on the last digit of an enrolled agent's [[Social Security number]] (SSN)&lt;ref name="CPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seq"/&gt; or [[Tax Identification Number|tax identification number]]:
{| class="wikitable sortable"

| 7, 8, 9 || 11/01/17 – 01/31/18 || 04/01/18 || 01/01/15 – 12/31/17
|}

===Renewal after initial enrollment cycle===
Individuals admitted to practice at any time during an enrollment cycle, "the three successive enrollment years preceding the effective date of renewal,"&lt;ref&gt;TreasuryDepartment Circular No. 230 § 10.6(e)(1)(ii)&lt;/ref&gt; must complete two hours of continuing professional education for each month of enrollment, including two hours of ethics or professional conduct in each year. If an individual receives initial enrollment between November 1 and April 1 of their applicable renewal period, they will not be required to renew until the expiration of the first full three-year enrollment cycle following their initial enrollment.

===Failure to renew===
An individual who has not filed a timely application for renewal, who has not made a timely response to the notice of noncompliance, or who has not satisfied the requirements of eligibility for renewal, will be placed on a roster of inactive enrolled individuals. During this time, the individual will be ineligible to practice before the Internal Revenue Service and may not state or imply that they are eligible to represent taxpayers, use the term enrolled agent, or use the EA designation.

==Practice before the IRS: Enrolled agents and other practitioners==
The right to practice before the Internal Revenue Service is regulated by Federal statute,&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|31|330}} and {{usc|5|500}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and persons authorized to practice are known as "Federally Authorized Tax Practitioners",&lt;ref&gt;See also {{usc|26|7525(a)(3)(A)}}, relating to confidentiality of communications.&lt;/ref&gt; or "FATPs". The FATP status is granted to attorneys, [[Certified Public Accountants|certified public accountants]], and enrolled agents, each having unlimited representation rights before the Internal Revenue Service. These practitioners may represent their clients on any matters including audits, collection actions, payment issues, tax refund matters, and appeals.&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Service, "[https://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Understanding-Tax-Return-Preparer-Credentials Understanding Tax Return Preparer Credentials]"&lt;/ref&gt; FATP status is also granted with limited representation rights to [[Enrolled actuary|enrolled actuaries]], enrolled retirement plan agents, and [[Registered Tax Return Preparer|registered tax return preparers]].

Enrolled agents, like other FATPs, are subject to a set of procedures and regulations described in Treasury Department Circular No. 230,'' Regulations Governing the Practice of Attorneys, Certified Public Accountants, Enrolled Agents, Enrolled Actuaries, and Appraisers before the Internal Revenue Service''.&lt;ref&gt;Codified in regulations at 31 C.F.R. subtitle A, part 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

When practicing before the Internal Revenue Service, enrolled agents may not use the term "certified" in describing their professional designation. An enrolled agent admitted to practice before the Internal Revenue Service may not state or imply that an employer/employee relationship exists between the enrolled agent and the Internal Revenue Service.

==Practice in federal courts==
Enrolled agent status does not authorize the enrollee to practice before the [[United States Tax Court]] or in any other court.

Practice in U.S. Tax Court is limited to members of the Bar of the Court. The Internal Revenue Code states, "No qualified person shall be denied admission to practice before the Tax Court because of his failure to be a member of any profession or calling."&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|7452}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-attorneys must pass a Tax Court exam for admission to the Bar of the Court. Attorneys are admitted to the Bar of the Tax Court without having to take the Tax Court examination.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Rule 200, Rules of Practice and Procedure, United States Tax Court (eff. July 6, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Practice in other federal courts is generally limited to persons licensed as attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Rule 5, Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States, effective July 1, 2013; Rule 46, Rules and Internal Operating Procedures of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (May 2016); Attorney Admissions Requirements, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas (July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The brothers '''Giovanni "Hans" Schlumpf''' (b. in [[Omegna]], [[Italy]], February, 1904; died 1989) and '''Federico "Fritz" Schlumpf''' ([[Omegna]], [[Italy]], February, 1906; April 18, 1992) were Swiss textile industrialists and collectors of automobiles.  They are best known for the [[Schlumpf Collection]] housed at the [[Musée National de l'Automobile de Mulhouse]].

They were sons of the textile industrialist Carl Schlumpf and his wife Jeanne Becker. The Schlumpf family moved to [[Mulhouse, France]] (then in Germany) in 1908.  Hans and Fritz Schlumpf lived in Mulhouse at their country house, Malmerspach, until they escaped and became Swiss exiles in 1977.

After World War II Fritz and Hans Schlumpf gathered an enormous collection of classic automobiles, including several hundred Bugattis (many of them in pieces or unrestored, but many were also completed cars). To fund this hobby they encumbered their enterprise to such an extent that by 1977 it became insolvent. Until this time the automobile collection was unknown to the public, but the excesses were revealed in 1977 during a strike by the former Schlumpf textile workers.

The '''Industry Social Service of the State of Rio de Janeiro''' comprehends SESI's work in [[Rio de Janeiro state]]. The institution focuses in bettering [[workplace|work environment]], [[quality of life]] and [[education]] level of [[Collaboration|collaborators]] from Rio de Janeiro's enterprises. Through programs and mobile units, it carries out actions related to [[health]], education, [[sports]], [[leisure]], [[culture]], [[occupational health]], [[work safety]] and [[environmental protection]]. These activities are aimed at workers and companies, as much as to [[society]] in general. SENAI Rio's history is parallel to the Brazilian industrial development and its designation accompanies Rio de Janeiro's changes, as when it became a capital and was renamed [[Guanabara (state)|Guanabara state]].

== Fields of action ==
SESI Rio's programs and unities are meant for industry workers, their families and Rio de Janeiro´s population as a whole. In companies, the institution focuses attention on the socially responsible management aiming Brazilian's [[competitive advantage]] and [[sustainable development]]. Besides the quality of life of workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abqv.com.br/portal/Content.aspx?id=372|title=ABQV celebra convênio com SESI-RJ|accessdate=1 July 2014|website=Associação Brasileira de Qualidade de Vida}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a general way, SESI Rio works in four big fields:&lt;ref name="DR"&gt;Rio de Janeiro, Departamento Regional do Estado do.

== Mobile units ==

The mobile units are trailers and vans with office structure to take up to companies health care for employees. Units can be [[dentistry|dental]], [[occupational health]] and [[x-ray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celi.com.br/noticias/leitura/id/840/A_saude_do_colaborador_em_primeiro_lugar|title=A saúde do colaborador em primeiro lugar|accessdate=1 July 2014|date=16 July 2009|website=Construtora Celi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Until the early 1940s, Brazil was an agricultural, rural and dependent on imported manufactured goods economy. Gradually the industrial sector was being equipped, but it was still difficult to meet all the needs of the worker. Further during the [[Second World War]]. Then, in 1946 (post-war), the private sector exercised its social function and created SESI.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/1937-1946/Del9403.htm Decreto-Lei n&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 9.403, from 25 June 1946], whereby the president of the Brazilian republic ([[Eurico Gaspar Dutra]]) gave "the National Confederation of Industry (CNI) the mission to create, organize and direct the Industry Social Service".&lt;/ref&gt; It was industry [[legitimizing]] [[social service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebah.com.br/content/ABAAAAoUwAG/servico-social-na-sociedade-capitalista|title=O serviço social na sociedade capitalista|accessdate=30 May 2014|website=Ebah}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same date, its National Department formed the Regional Division of Rio de Janeiro. It was "the beginning of Brazilian industrialization and a new cycle of development that sought to guarantee the country a place in the new international environment."&lt;ref name="DR"/&gt;

=== Industrialization ===
Between the 50s and the 70s the [[economy]] has changed, with the goal of building an industrialized and competitive society. In 1953, Rio de Janeiro's Regional Division becomes the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District's]] Regional Department, with [[jurisdiction]] on the federal capital. But when the Federal District is transferred to [[Brasília]] and Guanabara State is created, in 1960, it receives the name of Guanabara State's Regional Department. It turns out that, in 1974, then-President [[Ernesto Geisel]] decided to merge the states of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro (preserving the name of the latter), returning to Rio its ''status'' of the state capital. It is precisely in this time of transition, between 1974 and 1979, that it is created the Regional Department of the State of Rio de Janeiro, current SESI Rio.

=== The so called "lost decade” ===
During the 80s, dubbed "[[La Década Perdida|the lost decade]]" by economists, SESI Rio "increased in 328% the number of its services in the areas of Food, Entertainment, Health, Education, Service and Community Actions, ie, from 4.2 million to 18 million people."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Beloch|first1=I.|last2=Fagundes|first2=L. R.|title=Sistema Firjan: a história dos 170 anos da representação industrial no Rio de Janeiro, 1827-1997|publisher=Memória Brasil Projetos Culturais Ltda.|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;From 1980 to 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 1990s ===
In the 90s, the policy of expanding through the interior has been strengthened with the installation of units in approximately 10 municipalities.

=== The 2000s ===
In the 2000s the focus has changed to:
* Expertise in Corporate Social Responsibility, with focus on hearing the demands of [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] (e.g. [[employees]], [[consumers]], community, government and environment);
* Creation of a network of alliances between similar entities;
* Increase in the number of Mobile Units;
* Appreciation of the sport (as leisure and [[social inclusion]]) through championships;
* Creation of [[Distance education|distance learning]] courses for personal qualification.

In recent years, SESI Rio has sought to strengthen its programs for the welfare and quality of life of the citizens of Rio de Janeiro state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cursogratisonline.com.br/sesi-rj-cursos-e-inscricoes/|title=O SESI do Rio de Janeiro (FIRJAN)|accessdate=1 July 2014|website=Cursos Gratuitos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atelrj.org/home/convenios-educacao-1/sesi-rj|title=SESI-RJ|accessdate=1 July 2014|website=Associação dos Técnicos Industriais no Estado do Rio de Janeiro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir James Burns''' [[Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]] (10 February 1846{{spaced ndash}}22 August 1923) was a noted businessman, shipowner and philanthropist in Australia. In particular, he is known as the co-founder of [[Burns Philp]] and Company, a shipping and trading company, and for establishing the Burnside Presbyterian Homes for Children in [[North Parramatta, New South Wales|North Parramatta]] (now known as UnitingCare Burnside), a children and family welfare organisation.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography

==Early life==

Burns was born at [[Polmont]], Stirlingshire, [[Scotland]], the son of a merchant, David Burns, and educated at [[University of Edinburgh|Newington Academy]] and the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]] in Edinburgh.  He migrated to [[Queensland]] in 1862 and worked for three years in Western Queensland as a [[Jackaroo (trainee)|jackaroo]].  In 1865 he formed a [[Brisbane]] store, Burns &amp; Scott, in partnership with his brother, and established the first stores in [[Gympie]] and nearby One Mile Creek and [[Kilkivan, Queensland|Kilkivan]] in 1867, when gold was found there.  He sold his interests and returned to Scotland in 1870 after the death of his father.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; He briefly visited France as an observer and assistant in relief efforts after the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871 before returning to Queensland.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

==Business and other Activities==

In 1871, Burns returned to North Queensland to establish a new trading company in [[Townsville]]. He later loaned [[Robert Philp]] enough money to become a partner in the enterprise. The company thrived through ownership of sail and steam powered trading ships, initially leased to ensure a steady supply of goods between Queensland and Sydney. This formed the basis of the Queensland Steam Shipping Company Limited, later amalgamated into [[Burns Philp|Burns Philp and Company]], which remains as a major trading company today. The shipping expanded into various ports in the [[East Indies]] and the [[Pacific Islands]], and the company branched into various trading endeavours throughout the following decades.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;
 
In addition to establishing [[Burns Philp and Company]], his business interests include serving as chairman of the (North) Queensland Insurance Co. Ltd in 1886–1923, the New South Wales Mortgage, Land, and Agency Co. and the Solomon Islands Development Co. Ltd. He was also a director of the [[AMP Limited|Australian Mutual Provident Society]], the Sydney Exchange Co., the Bank of North Queensland, and various collieries, as well as owning extensive Queensland pastoral properties.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=nsw&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 4 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns served on a royal commission of inquiry into railway administration in 1906 and was appointed to the [[Legislative Council of New South Wales]] in 1908.&lt;ref name=nsw/&gt; 
He joined the Parramatta troop of the 1st Light Horse Regiment (New South Wales Lancers) as a trooper in June 1891 and was immediately promoted Captain, and became Major in January 1896. From September 1897 to June 1903 he commanded the regiment as its Lieutenant-Colonel. He was promoted to Colonel in July 1903 and commanded the 1st Australian Light Horse Brigade until January 1907, when he retired.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

Burns was president of the Caledonian Society for twenty years. During [[World War I]] Burns helped establish a scheme for insuring enlisted men with dependants, personally contributing £2000 a year during the duration of the war.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

==Later life==
From the 1880s, Burns was based at a property known as Gowan Brae, North of [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]]. He retired from government and business activities due to ill health in 1908, and lived at Gowan Brae from that time on. Shortly afterwards, he approached the [[Presbyterian Church of Australia]], suggesting that they establish a Presbyterian home for children. In 1910 he endowed some of the Gowan Brae property, to establish the Presbyterian Homes for Children (later renamed Burnside and currently known as UnitingCare Burnside&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title =About Burnside
  | publisher =UnitingCare Burnside
  | url =http://www.burnside.org.au/organisation/page.cfm?id=4
  | accessdate = 5 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and was chairman of its board for ten years.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; It became his passion in his "retired" years, as he made numerous contributions towards new homes and the children. His business and government connections ensured that donations from other sources were also forthcoming, with houses named after sponsors and officially opened by dignitaries.

Burns continued to live at Gowan Brae until his death and was buried there in a family cemetery.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; He left the property to his son, James, but suggested that, should James not need the property, it should be given to the (then) Burnside Presbyterian Orphans Homes. James honoured this request, and the property was donated.&lt;ref name=stb/&gt;
  
Much of the land has since been sold or leased to other organisations, or as residential developments.  The property immediately around Gowan Brae is now owned by [[The King's School, Sydney|The Kings School]], while sections of the property are now owned by the [[Redeemer Baptist School]] and [[Tara Anglican School for Girls]], with some still owned by the [[Synod of New South Wales and the ACT]] of the [[Uniting Church in Australia]] for Burnside's own operations and the synod's activities such as the archives, Camden Library and the Uniting Theological College.

'''John Bartholomew''' Junior (25 December 1831 – 29 March 1893) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[cartographer]].

==Life==
He was born in [[Edinburgh]].

His father [[John Bartholomew Senior]] started a cartographical establishment in Edinburgh,Scotland and he was educated in the work. He was subsequently assistant to the [[Germany|German]] geographer [[August Petermann]], until in 1856 he took up the management of his father's firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bartholomew 150 Years|author=Leslie Gardiner|publisher=John Bartholomew &amp; Son Ltd|isbn=0-85152-791-4|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this establishment, now known as the [[Edinburgh Geographical Institute]], Bartholomew built up a reputation unsurpassed in [[Great Britain]] for the production of the finest cartographical work. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
Bartholomew was an in-house cartographer for [[George Philip (cartographer)|George Philip]].
Bartholomew is best known for the development of colour contouring (or [[hypsometric tints]]), the system of representing altitudes on a graduated colour scale, with areas of high altitude in shades of brown and areas of low altitude in shades of green. He first showcased his colour contouring system at the [[Paris Exhibition of 1878]]; although it initially met with skepticism, it went on to become standard cartographical practice.

Among his numerous publications, particularly worthy of note is the series of maps of Great Britain reduced from the [[Ordnance Survey]] to scales of ½ inch and ¾ inch to 1 mile, with relief shown by [[contour line]]s and [[hypsometric tints]]. The ½ inch series is among the finest of its kind ever produced. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In [[management]], a '''line function''' is any kind of daily operation such as [[purchasing]], [[manufacturing]], and [[marketing|selling]] that is directly involved in carrying out the purpose of an [[organization]]. This contrasts to a [[staff function]] (such as the [[human resources]] department), which involves the provision of advice and other support to those involved in a line function.

==Statements of Financial Accounting Concepts==
'''Statements of Financial Accounting Concepts''' are a part of the FASB conceptual framework project.

'''Managerial psychology''' is a sub-discipline of industrial and organizational [[psychology]], which focuses on the efficacy of individuals, groups and organizations in the [[workplace]]. Its purpose is to specifically aid [[Management|managers]] in gaining a better understanding of the psychological patterns common among individuals and groups within any given organisation. Managerial psychology can be used to predict and prevent harmful psychological patterns within the workplace and can also be implemented to control psychological patterns among individuals and groups in a way that will benefit the organisation long term. (Robbins, SP et al.2010).

== Managerial psychologists ==
If in the early stages managerial psychologists used to study the problems of fatigue, boredom, and other working conditions that could impede efficient work performance. More recently, their contributions have expanded to include [[learning]], [[perception]], [[personality]], [[emotion]]s, training, leadership, effectiveness, needs and motivational forces, job satisfaction, decision-making processes, performance appraisals, attitude measurement, employee-selection techniques, work design, and job stress(Robbins, SP et al.2010). This means that they apply psychology principles to the workplace and use their skills to study workplace productivity, morale, employee screening or organizational development. Apart from this, they can also train and screen job applicants, assist with organizational development, and consult with corporations on a problem-solving basis.

== Objectives ==
* To understand how to manage stress, change and personal problems
* To understand how to work with a diverse group of people
* To understand how to conduct conflict resolution and the importance of effective confrontation skills
* To understand the importance of ethics in the workplace
* To identify effective leadership styles and the importance of leadership and what makes someone a successful leader
* To learn how to identify skills, motivate, develop and persuade others.

== Personality, motivation and job satisfaction ==
Herzberg et al.’s (1959) seminal [[Two-factor theory|two-factor theory of motivation]] theorized that satisfaction and dissatisfaction were not two opposite extremes of the same sequence, but two separate entities caused by quite different facets of work – these were labelled as “hygiene factors” and “motivators”. Hygiene factors are characterized as extrinsic components of job design that contribute to employee dissatisfaction if they are not met. Examples include: supervision, working conditions, company policies, salary, and relations with co-workers. Motivators, however, are intrinsic to the job itself and include aspects such as achievement, development, responsibility and recognition. On the other hand, intrinsic factors have long been acknowledged as important determinants of motivation. There is a longstanding debate as to whether hygiene factors really contribute to job satisfaction (Furnham et al., 1999; Warr, 1987). Most job satisfaction and motivation research literature is concerned with organisational or situational predictors (such as pay and supervision) (Locke, 1976) while neglecting individual differences (Staw and Ross, 1985). O’Reilly et al. (1980) discovered that individuals’ significantly differ in the way they perceive their jobs, even if the job description and the tasks they had to perform remained constant, thus suggesting that some individual differences must have an effect on work attitudes.

Staw et al. (1986) argued that individual disposition may have a profound influence over how the working world is perceived (i.e. what is important to the individual), and this is likely to affect the type of jobs that are sought.

=== The ten item personality inventory ===
It was first introduced in Gosling et al., (2003) and the ten items of this measure are scored using a seven-point scale, with two statements (one reversed) used to measure each personality variable. The authors report extensive data showing good reliability and validity of this instrument.

=== The work values questionnaire (WVQ) ===
This inventory introduced in Furnham et al., (2005) consists of 37 items and requires individuals to report the extent to which intrinsic (e.g.responsibility and personal growth) and extrinsic (e.g. pay and benefits) components are important to them on a six-point scale. The WVQ is a revised version of Mantech’s(1983) questionnaire. Previous studies have indicated that between two and four factors tend to be extracted, and that these often correspond to Herzberg et al.’s (1959) hygiene and motivator factors .

=== The job satisfaction scale ===
This scale introduced in Warr et al., (1979) consists of 15 items, seven of which measure intrinsic satisfaction, whilst the remaining eight measure extrinsic job satisfaction. Responses are given on a seven-point scale and can be summed to create and overall satisfaction score as well as an intrinsic and extrinsic value.

=== Experiment on personality, motivation and job satisfaction ===
In a recent issue of Journal of Managerial Psychology published in 2009 is presented an experiment with 202 full-time employees (81 males, mean age=38.3 and 121 females, mean age= 28.4) working in very different jobs in the retail, manufacturing and healthcare to investigate the extent to which personality and demographic factors explain variance in motivation and job satisfaction as defined by Herzberg et al.’s (1959) two-factor theory. Every person was given 3 questionnaires ( The ten item personality inventory, The work values questionnaire (WVQ), The job satisfaction scale) and had to complete them via a website.

As predicted, personality and demographic variables were significant correlates of the extracted factors, accounting for between 9 and 15.2 per cent of the variance. Similarly, personality and demographic variables were also significantly related to all three job satisfaction scores and accounted for between 10.5 and 12.7 per cent of the variance. As expected, conscientiousness was a significant correlate of job satisfaction scores in both correlational and regressional analyses. Contrary to expectations, age, job tenure and years working full-time were not significantly related to job satisfaction scores; however, in line with predictions and the two-factor theory, job status was significantly associated with these scores.

Negative relationships were observed between the security and conditions factor and job status, as well as years in full-time employment. These results suggest that individuals with low job status (e.g. graduate positions and non-managerial roles) are more concerned with working conditions and clarity in their work than those of a higher status and individuals who have been working for longer periods.

These results further validate the contention that work attitudes are not the product of situational factors alone, and that both literature and organisations should further investigate the variables that contribute to these values with the intention of increasing job satisfaction and performance, through effective selection methods and pervasive job interventions.

== Tools used by managerial psychologists ==

=== Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs===
[[File:Maslow's_Hierarchy_of_Needs_Pyramid.png|thumb|Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]]

[[Abraham Maslow]] developed the [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Hierarchy of Needs]] model in 1940-50s USA, and the Hierarchy of Needs theory remains valid today for understanding human motivation, management training, and personal development. Maslow's ideas surrounding the Hierarchy of Needs concern the responsibility of employers to provide a workplace environment that encourages and enables employees to fulfill their own unique potential (self-actualization).

While Maslow referred to various additional aspects of motivation, he expressed the Hierarchy of Needs in these five clear stages.

*'''Biological and Physiological needs''' - air, food, drink, shelter, warmth, sex, sleep, etc.
*'''Safety needs''' - protection from elements, security, order, law, limits, stability, etc.
*'''Belongingness and Love needs''' - work group, family, affection, relationships, etc.
*'''Esteem needs''' - self-esteem, achievement, mastery, independence, status, dominance, prestige, managerial responsibility, etc.
*'''Self-Actualization needs''' - realising personal potential, self-fulfillment, seeking personal growth and peak experiences.

=== Douglas McGregor's XY Theory ===

[[Douglas McGregor]], an American social psychologist, proposed his famous X-Y theory in his 1960 book 'The Human Side Of Enterprise'. [[Theory X and Theory Y]] are still referred to commonly in the field of management and motivation. McGregor's ideas suggest that there are two fundamental approaches to managing people. Many managers tend towards theory x, and generally get poor results. Enlightened managers use theory y, which produces better performance and results, and allows people to grow and develop.

==== Theory x ('authoritarian management' style)      ====
* The average person dislikes work and will avoid it he/she can.
* Therefore, most people must be forced with the threat of punishment to work towards organisational objectives.
* The average person prefers to be directed; to avoid responsibility; is relatively unambitious, and wants security above all else.

==== Theory y ('participative management' style) ====
* Effort in work is as natural as work and play.
* People will apply self-control and self-direction in the pursuit of organisational objectives, without external control or the threat of punishment.
* Commitment to objectives is a function of rewards associated with their achievement.
* People usually accept and often seek responsibility.
* The capacity to use a high degree of imagination, ingenuity and creativity in solving organisational problems is widely, not narrowly, distributed in the population.
* In industry the intellectual potential of the average person is only partly utilised.

=== McClelland's Human Motivation Theory      ===
'''''See also''''' [[Need theory]]

[[David McClelland]] in his 1961 book, "The Achieving Society " identified three motivators that he believed we all have: a need for achievement, a need for affiliation, and a need for power. People will have different characteristics depending on their dominant motivator. According to McClelland, these motivators are learned (which is why this theory is sometimes called the Learned Needs Theory).

McClelland says that, regardless of our gender, culture, or age, we all have three motivating drivers, and one of these will be our dominant motivating driver. This dominant motivator is largely dependent on our culture and life experiences.

==== Achievement ====
People motivated by achievement need challenging, but not impossible, projects. They thrive on overcoming difficult problems or situations, so make sure you keep them engaged this way. People motivated by achievement work very effectively either alone or with other high achievers.

When providing feedback, give achievers a fair and balanced appraisal. They want to know what they're doing right – and wrong – so that they can improve.

==== Affiliation ====
People motivated by affiliation work best in a group environment, so try to integrate them with a team (versus working alone) whenever possible. They also don't like uncertainty and risk. Therefore, when assigning projects or tasks, save the risky ones for other people.

When providing feedback to these people, be personal. It's still important to give balanced feedback, but if you start your appraisal by emphasizing their good working relationship and your trust in them, they'll likely be more open to what you say. Remember that these people often don't want to stand out, so it might be best to praise them in private rather than in front of others.

==== Power ====
Those with a high need for power work best when they're in charge. Because they enjoy competition, they do well with goal-oriented projects or tasks. They may also be very effective in negotiations  or in situations in which another party must be convinced of an idea or goal.

When providing feedback, be direct with these team members. And keep them motivated by helping them further their career goals

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9580">The '''McDonalds''' were a wealthy family of [[California]] during the 19th and 20th centuries. Descended from Mark Lindsay McDonald (1833-1917), they built and owned the historic residence "Mableton", also known as the "[[McDonald Mansion]]", in [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]].

Colonel Mark L. McDonald was born in [[Kentucky]] but settled in California during the 1850s. He made his money in road construction, and later in [[property development]] in Santa Rosa. He was married to Ralphine North McDonald (1843-1918), from [[Mississippi]], and among their seven children it was Mark McDonald Jr. (died 1932) who became heir to Mableton. Mark Jr. was also a successful businessman, running a water works and a fruit packing plant. He and his wife Isabelle, ''{{nee}}'' Juilliard (died 1960), made alterations to Mableton during the 1920s. They had three children, including their son Juilliard who died childless in 1946, and his sister Marcia later became the last McDonald heir. Upon Marcia's death in 1971, Mableton passed to the City of Santa Rosa.

Colonel Mark L. McDonald, Sr., a [[Kentucky]] native, came west as captain of a [[wagon train]] in the early 1850s. Trained in engineering, he first built roadways servicing gold and silver mines. His early successes allowed him to buy a seat on the [[Pacific Exchange|San Francisco Stock Exchange]], during which time he joined the ranks of the rich and powerful, including [[George Hearst]], [[Leland Stanford]] and [[Charles Crocker]].&lt;ref name=Tuomey1926&gt;Tuomey, Honoria.

''Santa Rosa: A Nineteenth Century Town''. 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Connor1970&gt;Connor, Ann M. ''Mableton''. 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1860s, McDonald had begun to apply his wealth, influence and entrepreneurial spirit to new business opportunities in [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]]. These included purchase and subdivision of {{convert|160|acre|km2}} of land in what was known as McDonald’s Addition. During the 1870s, the new development flourished and [http://santarosa.about.com/od/neighborhoodslandmarks/ig/McDonald-Ave--in-Santa-Rosa/ McDonald Avenue] became the premier residential street of Santa Rosa. The neighborhood’s popularity was enhanced by a range of amenities including gas and water service, a new streetcar line established by Colonel McDonald, and an extensive tree planting program implemented with the assistance of famed local [[Horticulture|horticulturist]] [[Luther Burbank]].&lt;ref  name=LeBaronetal1985/&gt;&lt;ref name=Connor1970/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Connor, Ann M. ''McDonald Avenue, A Century of Elegance''. 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

McDonald was active in civic affairs and was instrumental in the development of numerous local improvements, including Santa Rosa’s first library, the first steam railroad brought to Santa Rosa and operation of the Santa Rosa Water Works Company, an early private utility. He capitalized and built the nearby reservoir known as [[Lake Ralphine]], which was named for McDonald’s wife. His other business interests included fruit packing plants and drying yards in the area.&lt;ref name=Tuomey1926/&gt;&lt;ref name=Irvine1905/&gt;&lt;ref  name=LeBaronetal1985/&gt;

The McDonalds’ primary residence was in [[San Francisco]] and '''Mableton''', later known and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the '''[[McDonald Mansion]]''', was built as their summer home. The couple had seven children, although two of their daughters (Ralphine and Alice) died during childhood. Those surviving into adulthood included Mark L. McDonald, Jr., Stewart, Mabel, Edith and Florence.&lt;ref name=Connor1970/&gt;

Mark McDonald Jr. married Isabelle Juilliard, and it was they who would eventually own Mableton. Stewart McDonald died of tuberculosis in 1907. Mabel was an accomplished horsewoman who married William H. Hamilton of San Francisco. Edith married wealthy Selah Chamberlain, a socially prominent San Franciscan. Florence was also an excellent horsewoman who married Maxwell McNutt, of San Francisco.&lt;ref name=Tuomey1926/&gt;&lt;ref name=Connor1970/&gt;

Mark L. McDonald Sr. died in 1917 in San Francisco at the age of 84. Following his death, his wife Ralphine resided at Mableton, where she died in 1918 at the age of 75.

After the death of the senior McDonalds, the eldest son Mark Jr. and his wife Isabelle eventually became sole owners of Mableton, and made it their primary residence. In his career, Mark Jr. followed the example of his father, and found success running the Santa Rosa Water Works, and the M. L. McDonald Jr. and Co. Fruit Packing plant. He also had extensive holdings in orchard land and other real estate.

Like her husband, Isabelle was a native Californian with family roots dating back to the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]]. Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Frederick Juilliard, settled in Santa Rosa. The site of their family home was donated to the city by Isabelle’s father, and survives today as Juilliard Park in downtown Santa Rosa. Isabelle’s privileged upbringing included private East Coast schooling and several years of residence in [[Tuxedo Park, New York]] with her wealthy uncle [[Augustus D. Juilliard]], who was the founder of the [[Juilliard School|Juilliard School of Music]].

By the early 1920s, Mark and Isabelle had begun to extensively remodel Mableton to suit their own tastes. Among the changes they implemented were alterations to the rear of the house, installation of additional bathrooms, and numerous landscape improvements, including a tennis court (now the site of a formal garden). The couple had two children who survived into adulthood: a son, Juilliard, and a daughter, Marcia (a third child, Mark McDonald III, died in infancy).

After Mark L. McDonald, Jr. died in 1932, Isabelle occupied a [[Nob Hill]] apartment in San Francisco as her primary residence. Until her death in 1960, Mableton was once again used mostly as a summer home. Isabelle’s son, Juilliard McDonald, had a successful career and maintained the family’s business interests. Although he was married twice, Juilliard died childless in 1946. Following the death of Isabelle, her daughter Marcia became the last surviving McDonald heir. Like her mother, Marcia chose to make her primary home in a San Francisco apartment. However, she was less inclined to visit Mableton, and allowed the property to fall into disrepair.

When Marcia died in 1971 at the age of 65, the fate of the mansion was uncertain. The terms of Isabelle’s will and trust had dictated that, upon Marcia’s death, Mableton was to be left jointly to the [[University of California]] and [[Stanford University]]. Eventually, the property was offered for sale to the [[Santa Rosa, California|City of Santa Rosa]], and local controversy over possible development plans for the site ensued.

In 1982, Al Jaber founded Jadawel International Construction &amp; Development.

In 1992, AJWA Group for Agro and Food Industries, a company  of which Al Jaber is a shareholder, commenced operations following the construction of the largest rice storage and processing facility in Saudi Arabia at Jeddah Islamic Port.

In 2003, Al Jaber opened negotiations to purchase J.A. Jones Construction, a US subsidiary of [[Philipp Holzmann]] construction group. However, the negotiations were not completed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.handelsblatt.com/archiv/stabilisierung-ist-vorrangig-verkauf-von-holzmanns-us-tochter-aufgeschoben/2243300.html "Stabilisierung ist vorrangig: Verkauf von Holzmanns US-Tochter aufgeschoben"], ''[[Handelsblatt]]'', 30 April 2003 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, Portuguese press revealed that Al Jaber is expanding his business in the Algarve and investing about €200 million to buy the Hotel Dona Filipa in Vale do Lobo, the golf course San Lourenzo in Quinta do Lago, the Hotel Penina and its 3 golf courses from Starman (a joint-venture between the Lehman Brothers bank and Starwood Capital Group).

===Austria===

In 2002, Al Jaber acquired the famous [[Grand Hotel, Vienna]] from the Japanese airline [[All Nippon Airways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grandhotelwien.com/media/2626141/140-years-grand-hotel-wien.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416192350/http://www.grandhotelwien.com/media/2626141/140-years-grand-hotel-wien.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later acquired the premises of a former bank on Kärntner Ring and converted the building to the boutique Ring Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theringhotel.com/|title=Relais &amp; Chateaux Hotel The Ring - stay in the center of everything|website=The Ring Hotel|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, Al Jaber bought the Palais Corso, Vienna's premier luxury shopping and office complex from [[Assicurazioni Generali|Generali]] Versicherung, for about €70 million.&lt;ref&gt;Irina Frühmann, [http://www.wirtschaftsblatt.at/archiv/unternehmen/scheich-kauft-palais-corso-61459/index.do "Scheich kauft Palais Corso"], ''Wirtschaftsblatt'', 5 October 2006 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Al Jaber agreed to invest 10% in the building of the Vienna Tourism University ([[MODUL University Vienna|Modul University Vienna]]), a project handled by the [[Austrian Federal Economic Chamber|Vienna Economic Chamber]] &lt;ref&gt;Magdalena Klemun, [http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/oesterreich/316437/Startschuss-fuer-private-TourismusUni?from=suche.intern.portal%20 "Startschuss für private Tourismus-Uni"], ''Die Presse'', 11 July 2007 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided scholarships for students there both personally and through his Foundation.&lt;ref name="modul.ac.at"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modul.ac.at/article/view/sheikh-mohamed-bin-issa-al-jaber-awarded-as-honorary-senator-of-modul-university-vienna/|title=Sheikh Mohamed Bin Issa Al Jaber awarded as Honorary Senator of MODUL University Vienna|website=MODUL University Vienna|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2007, JJW signed an agreement for the takeover and the expansion of the Palace Schwarzenberg Hotel in Vienna, along with Magnat Real Estate. However, delays to the project led to its cancellation. An amicable settlement  was reached.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Himmelbauer, [http://www.wirtschaftsblatt.at/home/oesterreich/branchen/scheich-al-jaber-zahlt-265-millionen-euro-fuer-streit-beilegung-500244/index.do "Scheich Al Jaber zahlt 2,65 Millionen Euro für Streit-Beilegung"], ''Wirtschaftsblatt'', 14 December 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://immobilien.diepresse.com/home/oesterreich/653187/Hotel-Schwarzenberg_Doch-kein-Geld-von-Al-Jaber "Hotel Schwarzenberg: Doch kein Geld von Al Jaber?"], ''Die Presse'', 24 April 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of 2008, Al Jaber proposed to help the financially troubled [[Austrian Airlines]] with investments through taking a 20% stake in the company. However, he withdrew his offer in May 2008 after the company published its negative quarterly results, based on the grounds that the company intentionally withheld the actual level of trouble faced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://austrianaviation.net/news-regional/news-detail/datum/2011/06/09/mohamed-al-jaber-sagt-engagement-ab.html "Mohamed Al Jaber sagt Engagement ab"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203055317/http://www.austrianaviation.net/news-regional/news-detail/datum/2011/06/09/mohamed-al-jaber-sagt-engagement-ab.html |date=2013-12-03 }}, ''Austrian aviation.net'', 3 May 2008 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditor Herbert Heiser, who was called by the court to consult in the legal dispute between AUA and Al Jaber, agreed with Al Jaber’s conclusions.  He states in his report that rather than its officially declared profit of €3.3 million, the AUA should have revealed a hefty loss – of around €235 million.&lt;ref name="Die Presse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Presse 31.07.12|url=http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/1273525/AUABilanz_Pruefer-entdeckt-Ungereimtheiten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, Al Jaber took a 60% stake in [[Kneissl|Kneissl Holding GmbH]], an Austrian manufacturer of sports equipment. JJA Beteiligungsverwaltungs GmbH bought the entire company in December 2012 for €1,98 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/722406/Geld-an-Kneissl_Scheich-Al-Jaber-raeumt-auf "Geld an Kneissl: Scheich Al Jaber räumt auf"], ''Die Presse'', 9 February 2012 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beate Troger, [http://www.tt.com/Nachrichten/4217648-2/kneissl-gerettet-sanierung-des-scheichs-angenommen.csp "Kneissl gerettet, Sanierung des Scheichs angenommen"], ''Tiroler Tageszeitung'', 26 January 2012 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Vienna's Trialog Institut named Al Jaber 'Man of the Year' for his work in promoting inter-cultural understanding. Presenting the award, Karl Blecha, former Federal Minister of the Interior and of the Austrian-Arabic Association, praised Al Jaber for his work towards building bridges through education and understanding and his support of peace, tolerance and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trialog Man of the Year|url=http://trialoginstitut.at/images/stories/PRESSE/press_07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===London===

In 2007, Al Jaber expanded the portfolio of the Guernsey-based [[JJW Hotels &amp; Resorts]] group by acquiring [[The Eton Collection]] hotels for a reported [[£]]70&amp;nbsp;million. 
During the [[credit crunch|recession]] three years later, five of the hotels went into [[administration (law)|administration]]. A further two hotels were unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/business/upmarket-hotels-group-eton-collapses-6481833.html "Upmarket hotels group Eton collapses"], ''[[Evening Standard]]'', 17 June 2010.

In 2008, Al Jaber personally guaranteed three loans contracted by his hotel and food companies from Standard Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Russell, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financial-crime/8868099/Saudi-billionaire-Sheikh-Mohamed-Bin-Issa-Al-Jaber-accuses-Standard-Bank-in-court-of-conflict-of-interest.html "Saudi billionaire Sheikh Mohamed Bin Issa Al Jaber accuses Standard Bank in court of conflict of interest"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 3 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Following delays to repay the loans, the bank went to court in 2011, resulting in assets freezing, which Al Jaber declared resulted in a personal loss of $1.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg, [http://m.arabianbusiness.com/uk-dispute-cost-me-1-6bn-says-saudi-s-al-jaber-427588.html "UK dispute cost me $1.6bn, says Saudi's Al Jaber", ArabianBusiness.com, 29 October 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The case was settled after the two parties reached a private settlement in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.arabianbusiness.com/saudi-sheikh-buys-hotel-group-out-of-administration-435474.html "Saudi sheikh buys hotel group out of administration"], ArabianBusiness.com, 15 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotel empire of Al Jaber was initially started in France in 1988 and expanded to over 35 hotel properties in France and almost 80 in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/the-chic-sheikh-187470.html|title=The chic Sheikh|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, it was announced that the Group planned to acquire a number of hotels in France from the [[Starwood Capital Group]] for $2billion but the deal was not concluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/10/26/us-starwood-mbi-saudi-idUSTRE49P0TA20081026 | work=Reuters | first=Souhail | last=Karam | title=Saudi group in $2 billion hotel deal with Starwood: paper | date=26 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, facing difficulties, JJW France requested the Paris Court of Commerce to place it under safeguards.&lt;ref&gt;Christophe Palierse, [http://www.lesechos.fr/entreprises-secteurs/service-distribution/actu/0202007875228-le-groupe-hotelier-du-cheikh-al-jaber-en-procedure-de-sauvegarde-312118.php "Le groupe hôtelier du cheikh Al-jaber en procédure de sauvegarde"], ''[[Les Échos (France)|Les Echos]]'', 13 April 2012 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saveguard was granted.

In 2011, proceedings were filed against the Non-Executive Chairman of AJWA group for Food Industries, for facts being documented in the company records by members of the company administration.

'''Mustafa Bin Dardef''' ({{lang-ar|مصطفى بن دردف}}) (1968 – 18 October 2011)&lt;ref&gt;http://forum.kooora.com/f.aspx?t=32903747&lt;/ref&gt; was a popular field commander from the [[Zintan]] brigade of the [[Anti-Gaddafi forces]] during the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]]. He was killed by a mortar round just two days before the [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|fall of Sirte]] and death of former Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]].&lt;ref name="modernghana"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/357000/1/commander-bufa-lost-in-sirte-battle.html|title=Commander 'Bufa' lost in Sirte battle|work=Modern Ghana|agency=Agence France-Presse|first=Herve|last=Bar|date=21 October 2011|accessdate=24 October 2011|location=Benghazi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Bin Dardef was a businessman in the Mediterranean city of Benghazi before he joined the uprising, importing medical equipment and children's toys, and was twice jailed under the Gaddafi regime for his alleged Islamist leanings. He commanded the Fakhri Alsalabi unit, named after a pilot killed in mid-March, and fought in the [[Second Battle of Benghazi|second battle of Benghazi]].&lt;ref name="modernghana" /&gt; He left behind a son and four daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/24501/World/Region/Street-fighting-rocks-Sirte-as-Clinton-visits-Trip.aspx|title=Street fighting rocks Sirte as Clinton visits Tripoli|work=Ahram Online|date=18 October 2011|accessdate=24 October 2011|agency=Agence France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was active in the [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|battle of Sirte]], being the commander who announced the capture of Sirte's port on 26 September&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iukTaF46Mnp4rXQDDrno9_qLyIFg|title=Anti-Kadhafi fighters capture hometown port|work=Google News|agency=Agence France-Presse|last=Deshmukh|first=Jay|date=26 September 2011|accessdate=24 October 2011|location=Sirte}}&lt;/ref&gt; and speaking to news crews discussing the latest advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/22046/World/Region/Advance-on-Gaddafi-hometown-delayed-for-want-of-am.aspx|agency=Agence France-Presse|work=Ahram Online|title=Advance on Gaddafi hometown delayed for want of ammunition|date=22 September 2011|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also announced the reports that Moussa Ibrahim had been captured in September,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=314547|title=Hunt on for Gadaffi's son as key aide held|work=The Gulf Daily News|location=Sirte|date=30 September 2011|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this would later prove untrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/312204|title=NTC commander admits did not capture Moussa Ibrahim|first=Katerina|last=Nikolas|work=Digital Journal|date=1 October 2011|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim was again reported captured when Sirte fell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFL5E7LK3CW20111020|agency=Reuters|title=Gaddafi spokesman Moussa Ibrahim captured --NTC|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=24 October 2011|first=Jon|last=Hemming|location=Sirte|work=Reuters Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this was again proven to be untrue. On 22 October 2011, he was again reportedly captured for a third time, along with [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]], near [[Bani Walid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/313227 Libya's NTC claim Saif al-Islam Gaddafi captured alive, uninjured]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Bin Dardef died when a mortar round slammed into a vehicle packed with ammunition. A piece of metal tore into his bullet-proof vest while another ripped his throat, killing him almost instantly. He was buried in Benghazi's Martyrs' Cemetery, along with other fighters who had died in Sirte.&lt;ref name="modernghana" /&gt;

[[File:Newport City Centre - geograph.org.uk - 325157.jpg|thumb|Junction of Commercial Street, [[Stow Hill]] and [[High Street, Newport, Wales|High Street]] in front of the [[Westgate Hotel]]]]
'''Newport city centre''' is traditionally regarded as the area of [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], Wales bounded by the west bank of the [[River Usk]], the [[George Street Bridge (Newport)|George Street Bridge]], the eastern flank of [[Stow Hill]] and the [[South Wales Main Line]]. Most of the city centre is contained within two conservation areas: the central area and the area around Lower Dock Street. Most of the city centre is located in the [[Stow Hill]] district.

==Description==
The main shopping thoroughfare is [[Commercial Street, Newport|Commercial Street]], which forms part of the north-south axis of High Street, Commercial Street and Commercial Road, linking the heart of the city with [[Newport Docks]]. The streets were laid-out in 1807 by Sir Charles Morgan's Tredegar Wharf Company to connect the expanding docks with the main roads in the centre.

The area between Commercial Street and the river used to contain a mixture of railway lines and river wharves so the street pattern in this area was never fixed. On the removal of the railway lines and wharves in the 1960s the large [[John Frost Square]] (1977) and [[Kingsway Shopping Centre]] were built, close to [[Newport bus station]]. This area has been redeveloped to provide the [[Friars Walk, Newport|Friars Walk]] shopping and leisure complex which was opened in November 2015. As part of this redevelopment, the [[Chartist Mural]] was destroyed.

Towards the northern end of Newport city centre is Westgate Square, named after the [[Westgate Hotel]]. Here, the five roads of Commercial Street, Stow Hill, Bridge Street, [[High Street, Newport, Wales|High Street]] and Skinner Street converge. This is generally regarded as the centre although the actual centre, as measured on road signs, is further up Bridge Street outside the Queen's Hotel where most [[Ordnance Survey|OS]] maps pin point the centre.

On Upper Dock Street is the Chartist Tower, a 15-storey office block, built in 1966 and the tallest building in Newport. It features a secure underground car park. Radio transmitters and mobile phone masts are situated on the roof. During the [[2014 Wales summit|2014 NATO summit]] a security forces command and control team was housed temporarily in the building, with the top floor and roof being used as an observation post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/commercial-property/tallest-building-newport-acquired-multi-14066489|title=The tallest building in Newport acquired in a multi-million pound deal|first=Sion|last=Barry|date=21 December 2017|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the building was sold as party of a £6.5M deal and is planned to be developed into a 163-bed [[Mercure (hotel)|Mercure]] hotel.&lt;ref name=argus-20180127&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/15902058.First_artist_impressions_released_for_Newport_s_Chartist_Tower/ |title=First artist impressions released for Newport's Chartist Tower |last=Farell-Roig |first=Estel |newspaper=The Argus |date=27 January 2018 |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=argus-20180704&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/16332501.council-approve-163-bed-hotel-plans-for-newports-chartist-tower/ |title=Council approve 163-bed hotel plans for Newport's Chartist Tower |last=Griffiths |first=Niall |newspaper=South Wales Argus |date=4 July 2018 |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Bridge Street, the two roads of High Street and Cambrian Road run in parallel towards [[Newport railway station]]. Joining the two roads is the covered [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Newport Arcade. At the western end of the arcade is the Cambrian Centre which is being redeveloped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/9653414.Cambrian_Centre_transformation_could_begin_in_summer/ |title=Cambrian Centre redevelopment |publisher=Southwalesargus.co.uk |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the east of High Street is [[Newport Market]], a Grade II-[[listed building]].

Kingsway/Usk Way is a boulevard on the west bank of the River Usk linking Newport Castle the [[Riverfront Theatre]] and the [[University of South Wales]] to the western ends of [[City Bridge]] and [[Newport Transporter Bridge]]. The city centre is currently being expanded to include areas on the east bank. The area between [[Newport Bridge, Newport|Newport Bridge]] and George Street Bridge is included in the [[Newport Unlimited]] master plan as a new high-density combined commercial and residential area, joined to the west bank by [[Newport City footbridge]]. The plan shows a strong urban form along the riverfront, emphasised with tall landmark buildings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newport.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/agenda/cont042922.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630102312/http://www.newport.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/agenda/cont042922.pdf |date=30 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's major sports stadium, at [[Rodney Parade]] on the east bank of the [[River Usk]], is a short walk from the city centre via [[Newport Bridge, Newport|Newport Bridge]] or [[Newport City footbridge]].

==Business==
[[File:Admiral_House,_Newport.jpg|thumb|right|Admiral House, Queensway, Newport]]
Many of the non-retail city centre businesses are located on Bridge Street. In 2014 [[Admiral Insurance]] opened a large newly constructed office opposite Newport railway station.

==Shopping==
[[File:Friars Walk Shopping Centre 2018.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Friars Walk, Newport|Friars Walk]]]]
Newport's city centre shops are concentrated along the [[Pedestrian zone|pedestrianised]] [[High Street, Newport, Wales|High Street]], [[Commercial Street, Newport|Commercial Street]] and adjoining roads. [[Friars Walk, Newport|Friars Walk]] shopping and leisure complex and, linked by [[John Frost Square]], the adjoining [[Kingsway Shopping Centre]] are the main under-cover shopping areas. The city centre has suffered from competition from [[Cwmbran Centre]] and out-of-town shopping areas at [[Newport Retail Park]] to the east and retail parks around [[Maesglas]] to the west. The protracted development of Friars Walk was also cited as a reason for high street stores, such as [[Marks and Spencer]], leaving the city centre during the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Morris, Steven|date=20 May 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/20/newport-retail-exodus-big-names |title=Newport fails to curb retail exodus as big names pack up shop |newspaper=The Guardian |place=London |accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambrian Centre===
The Cambrian Centre is a small shopping centre in Cambrian Road in Newport city centre. Among other units, it houses one of the city's [[Wetherspoon's]] public houses, the [[John Wallace Linton]].

A planning application by Holder Mathias Architects was approved in 2007 by [[Newport City Council]] for an £87&amp;nbsp;million redevelopment and refurbishment to be known as City Spires&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=City Spires given the go-ahead|journal=[[Building Design]]|date=31 August 2007|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=3 January 2007|title=Wales' newest city rides on the crest of a wave|newspaper=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was mothballed in 2008 before construction started. An alternative redevelopment plan was started in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hamilton, Helen|date=12 November 2011|title=...the party's over|journal=[[Estates Gazette]]|pages=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/9653414.Cambrian_Centre_transformation_could_begin_in_summer/ |title=Cambrian Centre redevelopment |publisher=Southwalesargus.co.uk |date=18 April 2012|accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Crockett, Natalie|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/burnley/9500540.print/|title=New plans for Newport's Cambrian Centre|newspaper=[[Lancashire Telegraph]]|date=30 January 2012|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Barry, Sion|date=31 January 2013|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/business-news/admiral-signs-up-cambrian-centre-2498378|title=Admiral signs up for Cambrian Centre office space|newspaper=Western Mail|page=25|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase of development, Admiral House, was opened in 2014.

The '''North American Industry Classification System''' or '''NAICS''' (pronounced "nakes"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/faqs/faqs.html#q1|title=North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)|last=Division|first=Special Projects Staff, Service Sector Statistics|website=www.census.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is used by business and government to classify business establishments according to type of economic activity (process of production) in [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and the [[United States|United States of America]].  It has largely replaced the older [[Standard Industrial Classification]] (SIC) system; however, certain government departments and agencies, such as the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), still use the [[SIC codes]].

An establishment is typically a single physical location, though administratively distinct operations at a single location may be treated as distinct establishments.  Each establishment is classified to an industry according to the primary business activity taking place there.  NAICS does not offer guidance on the classification of enterprises (companies) which are composed of multiple establishments.

==Codes==

The NAICS numbering system employs a five or six-digit code at the most detailed industry level. The first five digits are generally (although not always strictly) the same in all three countries. The first two digits designate the largest business sector, the third digit designates the subsector, the fourth digit designates the industry group, the fifth digit designates the NAICS [[industry|industries]], and the sixth digit designates the national [[industry|industries]].

==History==

NAICS is a collaborative effort by Mexico's ''[[Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía]]'' (INEGI), [[Statistics Canada]], and the [[United States Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB), through its Economic Classification Policy Committee (ECPC), staffed by the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] (BEA), the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS), and the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]]. The system is designed to be largely compatible with the [[United Nations]] Statistical Office's [[International Standard Industrial Classification]] system (ISIC).  NAICS versions are released every five years.

With the first version, released in 1997, NAICS offered enhanced coverage of the service sector, relative to SIC. The 2002 revision accommodated significant changes in the Information Sector.  The 2012 revision slightly reduced the number of industries and modified six sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/faqs/faqs.html#q14 |title=14.

An '''operational system''' is a term used in [[data warehousing]] to refer to a system that is used to process the day-to-day transactions of an organization. These systems are designed in a manner that processing of day-to-day transactions is performed efficiently and the integrity of the transactional data is preserved.
== Synonyms ==
Sometimes operational systems are referred to as [[operational database]]s, [[transaction processing system]]s, or [[online transaction processing]] systems (OLTP). However, the use of the last two terms as synonyms may be confusing, because operational systems can be [[batch processing]] systems as well.

Any enterprise must necessarily maintain a lot of data about its operation.

''Outsourced'' is set in a [[call center]] in [[Mumbai]], India, where an American [[novelties]] company has recently [[outsourcing|outsourced]] its order processing. A lone American manages the call center and must explain American popular culture to his employees as he tries to understand Indian culture.

==Characters==

===Main characters===
* [[Ben Rappaport]] as Todd Dempsy, a [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] native who is transferred to India to run the call center for Mid American Novelties. He does not understand Indian culture and is constantly offending workers unintentionally. He eventually becomes more aware of Indian culture. He is currently employed as executive manager.
* [[Rizwan Manji]] as Rajiv Gidwani, Todd's assistant manager at Mid American Novelties. He is hard-nosed and unapologetic and he aspires to be Todd's replacement (whether due to Todd's success or his downfall). When Todd is promoted to executive manager, Rajiv is promoted to manager. His intentions are not to be mean, but to only run the company professionally and business-like. It has long been his  dream to become a successful business manager so he can gain the approval of the wealthy father of Vimi, whom he has loved since childhood and wishes to marry. Once he becomes manager, he marries Vimi.
* [[Sacha Dhawan]] as Manmeet, a call center employee for Mid American Novelties, who dreams of America and quickly becomes good friends with his boss, Todd Dempsy. He is known for being the "hip" one, who is fascinated by American culture. Manmeet is girl-crazy; he has had several "over the phone" relationships with American callers and flirts with almost every woman he meets. He seems more interested in American women than Indian women, stating in one episode that American women are not concerned with his father's occupation or where he went to school. This, along with his reluctance to ask one of Tonya's friends to dance at a Halloween party, indicates that Manmeet may actually have a bit of an inferiority complex.
* [[Rebecca Hazlewood]] as Asha, a call center employee for Mid American Novelties and eventual love interest of Todd. She is frequently the voice of reason in the office and plans to pursue an arranged marriage. Early in the series, Todd develops feelings for Asha, who, while responding in some ways, eventually re-asserts her commitment to the arranged marriage process, leading Todd to develop a relationship with Tonya. In the penultimate episode, Tonya breaks up with Todd because he still has feelings for Asha. In the last scene of the finale, Asha, having earlier expressed doubts about her fiancée, tells Todd he should fight for what he wants, and takes his hand as they gaze at the celebratory crowd at Rajiv and Vimi's wedding, strongly implying that she wants him to fight for her because of her feelings for him as well.
* [[Parvesh Cheena]] as Gupta, a very talkative call center employee for Mid American Novelties, who constantly yearns to be the center of attention. After Todd inspires him to grab some independence from his parents, Gupta rents his own place in the apartment directly above Todd's.
* [[Anisha Nagarajan]] as Madhuri, a shy and soft-spoken call center employee for Mid American Novelties whose income  supports her entire family. As time passes, Madhuri opens up, becoming one of the office gossips. Madhuri also has a beautiful singing voice, and the others convince her to enter a singing contest.
* [[Diedrich Bader]] as American Charlie Davies, a call center manager for the company All-American Hunter. Charlie is  friendly and has good intentions but is somewhat socially clueless and a bit gruff, leading to many humorous situations. For several episodes, Charlie nurses a crush on Tonya, convinced he has a chance at a relationship despite her obvious disinterest in him romantically.
* [[Pippa Black]] as Tonya, an Australian call center manager for the company Koala Airlines who is easygoing and flirtatious with a sense of adventure; by mid-season, she and Todd are romantically involved  and remain so until just before the end of the series.

===Main recurring principal characters===

* [[Guru Singh]] as Ajeet, a tall, silent [[Sikh]] whose character frequently shows displeasure at Todd's cultural gaffes. A poet, he first speaks in the season finale, where he becomes Madhuri's love interest and his character is given a more prominent role.
* [[Thushari Jayasekera]] as Pinky, a fun and hardworking call center worker at Mid America Novelties, who is adventure seeking and ready to learn. Does funny and awkward things. Ready to defend her fellow call center team as well as party with the big boss. Played largest role in the season finale.

===Recurring characters===
* A-Team, a group of well-dressed executive employees for a computer support call center located in the same building. The group are conspicuously rude, snobby, and taunting.
* Jerry Stern (played by [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]]), Todd's [[supervisor]] in the U.S.; he is business focused and often reminds Todd of tough choices Todd is reluctant to make, such as firing a staff member due to poor sales. 
*Santosh, the maid at Todd's apartment.
*Vimi, (played by [[Sarayu Rao]] in the Jolly Vindaloo Day episoded and [[Noureen DeWulf]] in later episodes), Rajiv's fiancée and eventual wife.

He confronts Manmeet, who uses his flirtatiousness to sell more novelties and increasing revenue, so no one needs to be laid off.

Organizational resilience is defined as "the ability of a system to withstand changes in its environment and still function".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Ian P|last2=Collard|first2=Mark|last3=Johnson|first3=Michael|title=Adaptive organizational resilience: an evolutionary perspective|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2017.07.005|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|volume=28|pages=33–40|doi=10.1016/j.cosust.2017.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a capability that involves organizations either being able to endure the environmental changes without having to permanently adapt, or the organization is forced to adapt a new way of working that better suits the new environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In recent years, a new consensus of the concept of '''resilience''' emerged as a practical response to the decreasing lifespan of organisations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Upside-Turbulence-Seizing-Opportunity-Uncertain/dp/0061771155/|title=The Upside of Turbulence: Seizing Opportunity in an Uncertain World|first=Donald|last=Sull|date=15 October 2009|publisher=HarperBusiness|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the key stakeholders, including boards, governments, regulators, [[shareholder]]s, staff, suppliers and customers to effectively address the issues of security, [[preparedness]], risk, and survivability.

# Being resilient is a proactive and determined attitude to remain a thriving enterprise (country, region, organization or company) despite the anticipated and unanticipated challenges that will emerge; 
# Resilience moves beyond a defensive security and protection posture and applies the entity’s inherent strength to withstand crisis and deflect attacks of any nature; 
# Resilience is the empowerment of being aware of your situation, your risks, vulnerabilities and current capabilities to deal with them, and being able to make informed tactical and strategic decisions; and, 
# Resilience is an objectively measurable competitive differentiator (i.e., more secure, increased stakeholder and shareholder value).
An organization that realizes the benefits of the above definitions of resilience will have a high likelihood of maintaining a successful and thriving enterprise.

Previously, it was considered that 'organisational resilience' could only be generated from processes and functions such as [[Risk Management]], [[Business Continuity]], IT [[Disaster Recovery]], [[Crisis Management]], [[Information Security]], [[Operational continuity]], Physical Security and so on. These are recognised as key contributors to operational resilience, and “the positive ability of a system or company to adapt itself to the consequences of a catastrophic failure caused by power outage, a fire, a bomb or similar” event or as "the ability of a [system] to cope with change".&lt;ref&gt;Wieland, A. &amp; Wallenburg, C.M.

== Importance ==

Global turbulence is expected. Competition, instability and uncertainty are constants in a changing world. Organizations face an unprecedented and growing number of potential disruptions to the status quo and the best laid strategic plans. As history repeats itself, prominent organizations will fail unless modern risk management and governance models incorporate scalable resilience metrics.

To survive and prosper in this new environment of heightened uncertainty and change, organizations must move past traditional risk and governance models and focus instead on resilience. Resilience applies at all levels: national, regional, organizational and corporate. At the national level, major infrastructure concerns and societal institutions must be robust enough, and unencumbered by legal and regulatory constraints, to serve the national good in normal operations, in crisis, and in recovery. At the regional levels, specific infrastructure assets come together in highly interdependent ways to serve local constituents and be a part of a national infrastructure. At the organizational and corporate level (which owns or operates the vast majority of our critical infrastructure assets), individual companies and operating units must ensure their business operations and service delivery capacities remain able to perform their primary business functions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techzone360.com/topics/techzone/articles/2015/12/03/413946-saying-do-resilience-10-potential-barriers-business-bliss.htm Demrovsky, Chloe. Saying 'I Do' to Resilience: 10 Potential Barriers to Business Bliss. TechZone360. December 3, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Business continuity and competitiveness ==

[[Yossi Sheffi]] extended the resilience concept to business continuity initiatives in his 2005 book ''The Resilient Enterprise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Yossi|last=Sheffi|url=http://resilient-enterprise.mit.edu/ |title=The Resilient Enterprise: Overcoming Vulnerability for Competitive Enterprise|publisher=MIT Press|date=October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheffi analyzed how disruptions can adversely affect the operations of corporations and how investments in resilience can give a business a competitive advantage over entities not prepared for various contingencies. Business organizations such as the [[Council on Competitiveness]] have embraced resilience and have tied economic competitiveness to security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compete.org/publications/detail/31/the-resilient-economy-integrating-competitiveness-and-security/ Transform. The Resilient Economy]. Integrating Competitiveness and Security. Council on Competitiveness. July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Reform Institute]] has highlighted the need to enhance the resilience of the [[supply chain]] and [[electrical grid]] against disruptions that could cripple the U.S. economy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.policyarchive.org/bitstream/handle/10207/8649/Supply_Chain_2-19-08_in_template03-06-08.pdf?sequence=1 Chain of Perils: Hardening the Global Supply Chain and Strengthening America's Resilience].

Many experts and leaders see resilience as a vital component to a [[homeland security]] strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine McIntire Peters.

== Growing support in Washington, D.C. ==

Prominent members in the United States Congress are embracing resilience. The Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, Bennie Thompson (D-MS) declared May 2008 “Resilience Month” as the committee and its subcommittees held a series of hearings to examine the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hlswatch.com/2008/05/01/%e2%80%9cresilience%e2%80%9d-blooming-into-its-own/ 'Resilience' Blooming Into Its Own]. Homeland Security Watch. May 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.cq.com/docs/hs/hsnews110-000002883586.html Committee Leaders Pleased With Month of Hearings on Resiliency]. CQ Homeland Security. May 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/homeland_security/ Homeland Security]. whitehouse.gov. Retrieved 2009-04-05.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Department of Homeland Security]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/DHS_StratPlan_FINAL_spread.pdf One Team, One Mission, Securing Our Homeland].

Homeland Security Advisory Council. September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; have also made resilience an integral component of homeland security policy.

The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, released by the [[Department of Homeland Security]] in February 2010, made resilience a prominent theme and one of the core missions of the U.S. homeland security enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/qhsr_report.pdf Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Report: A Strategic Framework for a Secure Homeland]. U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security. February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competitive advantage in business ==

Business and government enterprises that are able to quickly adapt to or seize [[competitive advantage]] from sudden and/or significant changes in their environments, with minimal interruption to their enterprise missions and manageable impact to their market value, as well as adapt to change in an apparently slower, more evolutionary manner - sometimes over many years or decades - can be described as being more resilient&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newsday.com/2.811/jamie-herzlich/small-business-a-good-plan-shields-from-storm-clouds-1.1322137?firstfree=yes&lt;/ref&gt;. Leading [[management consultancies]] and national governments including the Australia, [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] and the [[UK Cabinet Office]] believe that an organization’s resilience, properly understood, has critical implications for its competitive posture, profitability and shareholder value.

Over the past years, business, academic and government leaders have become aware that certain organizations respond better to disruptions than other, often similarly situated, organizations. For example, a September 2003 Harvard Business Review article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Harvard Business Review|year=2003|title=The Quest for Resilience|author=Gary Hamel and Liisa Välikangis|url=http://www.hbr.org/2003/09/the-quest-for-resilience/ar/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that “momentum is not the force it once was” in ensuring an organization’s success. They noted the emergence of several disruptive trends — including technological discontinuities, regulatory upheavals, [[geopolitical]] shocks, industry [[deverticalization]] and [[disintermediation]], abrupt shifts in consumer tastes, and hordes of nontraditional competitors — that require companies to become resilient to remain successful. The authors concluded that “strategic resilience is not about responding to a one-time crisis.  It’s not about rebounding from a setback. It’s about continuously anticipating and adjusting to deep, secular trends that can permanently impair the earning power of a core business. It’s about having the capacity to change before the case for change becomes desperately obvious.”

Resilience also has important implications for governance processes and systems. In a 2004 white paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2004|title=Redefining the Corporate Governance Agenda |publisher=[[Booz Allen Hamilton]] and Weil, Gotschal and Manges LLP |url=http://www.boozallen.com/media/file/138022.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors wrote that “enterprise resilience marries risk assessment, information reporting, and governance processes with strategic and business planning to create an enterprise-wide early warning capability that is embedded in the business of the company.” They explained that “Enterprise Resilience is predicated on an expanded view of risk—one that focuses on value, and therefore encompasses not only traditional risks (e.g., financial, natural hazards, physical security, legal, compliance) but also risks relating to earnings drivers (e.g., innovation, channel relationships, intellectual property) and company culture.”

Over the past decade, governments worldwide have also become increasingly focused on protecting their facilities, technologies, networks, personnel and other mission-critical assets from attack or misappropriation. The risk of cyber-terrorism and other threats to critical infrastructure are of particular concern.  On March 31, 2011, the President issued Presidential Policy Directive Eight (PPD-8)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PPD-8|url=https://www.dhs.gov/presidential-policy-directive-8-national-preparedness}}&lt;/ref&gt; that directed the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to develop a national preparedness system with the objective of strengthening the security and resilience of the United States through systematic preparation for the threats that pose the greatest risk to the security of the Nation, including acts of terrorism, cyber attacks, pandemics, and catastrophic natural disasters. The directive defined resilience as “the ability to adapt to changing conditions and withstand and rapidly recover from disruption due to emergencies.”

===Security===
[[Security]], whether applied to physical, financial, personnel, cyber information or any other asset, entails the measures to protect against danger or loss with emphasis on being protected from dangers that originate from outside. A significant [[security breach|breach in security]] could certainly impair an organizations ability to exist, and thus is a critical concept underlying the organization’s capacity to be resilient. Resilience is proactive in positioning the company to survive and thrive given known and unknown challenges. Security, as generally practiced, provides specific protection against identified or projected circumstances.

===Protection===
Protection is often associated with the set of actions to harden assets to withstand identified contingencies, mitigate the damage, or make them an unattractive target. The focus is to maintain the assets’ core function and ward off harm. Typically, protection performance objectives are stated as an absolute capability against varying levels of threat (category II or greater hurricane, defined types of breaches, specific acts). Organizations plan for protection against specific threats or categories of threats. Resilience approaches the issue from a standpoint of taking reasonable protective actions, but having alternative capabilities as needed or the ability to withstand the disruption.

===Crisis management===
[[Crisis management]] generally refers to the set of actions and capabilities in place to effectively respond to and contain a situation. The situation can vary from natural, man-made, or environmental challenges, whether internally or externally generated. Most consider crisis management to largely consist of actions that go into play when the crisis occurs and subside after it is considered “over”. There are plans and preparations, but the actions are not often dealt with as part of normal operations. Resilience depends on effective crisis management, but would encourage more prominent treatment of crisis management capabilities throughout the company’s operation than is often the case.

===Preparedness===
[[Preparedness]] consists of the plans of actions for when the disaster or crisis strikes.  Preparedness efforts are very specific sets of tactical actions (evacuation plans, sheltering plans, rehearsals, stockpiles, etc.) that the company and individuals will take to mitigate the effects of predicted disasters/crises. Resilience requires prudent and serious attention to preparations for known likely disasters, particularly those that are highly likely (e.g., hurricanes in Florida). Resiliency would address preparedness as a specific emergency management business function; but more importantly, as being impacted by numerous functions across the organization. These may include human resources, strategic planning, financial management, information technology, and risk management.

===Risk management===
[[Risk management]] consists of formal processes to identify threats and vulnerabilities to the company, and the mitigation approaches it will employ. Risk management is highly sophisticated and the results have application in managing the business, insurance coverage, and in attracting investors. The risk management profession is moving toward a more proactive and return on investment focus, but the traditional focus has been defensive in nature. Identifying and managing risks, particularly operational risks, is arguably the most important factor in achieving resilience; however, it is one of many factors. Resiliency has a healthy consideration of posturing for future opportunities. That is not a traditional consideration in risk management.

== Making resilience reality ==

Some scholars have identified the four facets of resilience as preparedness, protection, response and recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.policyarchive.org/bitstream/handle/10207/9662/Building_Resilience_OCT6.pdf?sequence=1 Building A Resilient Nation: Enhancing Security, Ensuring a Strong Economy report]. Reform Institute. October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, are adopting the resilience concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/resilientnation Resilient Nation]. Demos. April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/getdoc/cd99d136-6195-4b70-b6f4-46202d717f1e/TEN.047.001.0001.pdf Improving Disaster Resilience]. Australian Government. May 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United Kingdom, resilience is implemented locally by the [[Local Resilience Forum]].

==Measuring resilience==
As part of the Canterbury University Resilient Organisations programme, ResOrgs have developed a tool for benchmarking the Resilience of Organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resorgs.org.nz/ Resilient Organisations]. March 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Resilience Diagnostic is an assessment made up of 11 categories, each evaluated by a set of 5 to 7 questions. These categories are defined as either asset or liability. A person’s resilience is determined by the sum of all asset scores divided by the sum of all liability scores, producing a Resilience Ratio. The Resilience Ratio can be reflected both on an organizational and individual level and the assessment provides self-coaching options for participants. Developed in 2011 by The Resilience Institute, the Resilience Diagnostic has been used by corporations worldwide, with key insights reflected in the Global Resilience Report 2016. &lt;ref&gt;[https://resiliencei.com/resilience-diagnostic/ Resilience Diagnostic]. November 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resilience as an acquired skill==
In [[Organizational Studies]], resilience is often referred to as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Here, resilience emerges as the response to specific interruptions of the normal. Sutcliffe and Vogus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.husdal.com/2010/10/14/organizing-resilience/ Organizing for Resilience] Sutcliffe, K. M., &amp; Vogus, T. J. (2003). In K. S. Cameron, J. E. Dutton &amp; R. E. Quinn (Eds.), Positive Organizational Scholarship: Foundations of a New Discipline (pp. 94-110). San Francisco: Berett-Koehler Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; argue that resilience should rather be viewed from a developmental perspective, as an ability that develops over time from continually handling risks. Resilience, then, is "the continuing ability to use internal and external resources successfully to resolve new issues". Thus, "resilience is the capacity to rebound from adversity strengthened and more resourceful".

==Organizational Resilience Management Standard==
[[ASIS International]] have developed and published the definitive Organizational Resilience Management Standard SPC.1-2009. Approved by ANSI and adopted by the Department of Homeland Security under the PS-Prep program, this American Standard provides a practical basis for implementation of preparedness objectives supported by ASIS ORMS (Organizational Resilience Management System) software.

'''Richard Lee Petty''' (born July 2, 1937), nicknamed '''The King''', is a former [[NASCAR]] driver and voice actor who raced in the Strictly Stock/Grand National Era and the [[NASCAR Cup Series|NASCAR Winston Cup Series]]. He won the NASCAR Championship seven times ([[Dale Earnhardt]] and [[Jimmie Johnson]] are the only other drivers to accomplish this feat),&lt;ref name=Daytona&gt;{{cite book|title=Daytona: From the Birth of Speed to the Death of the Man in Black|last=Hinton|first=Ed|year=2001|publisher=Warner Books|location=New York|isbn=0-446-52677-0|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; winning a record 200 races during his career,&lt;ref name=Daytona /&gt; winning the [[Daytona 500]] a record seven times, and winning a record 27 races&lt;ref name=Daytona /&gt; (10 of them consecutively) in the 1967 season alone.&lt;ref&gt;A 1972 rule change eliminated races under {{convert|250|mi|km}} in length, reducing the schedule to 30 (now 36) races.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistically, he is the most accomplished driver in the history&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carophile.org/greatest-race-car-drivers-of-all-time/5/&lt;/ref&gt; of the sport and is one of the most respected figures in motorsports as a whole. He also collected a record number of poles (127) and over 700 Top 10 finishes in his 1,184 starts, including 513 consecutive starts from 1971–1989. Petty was the only driver to ever win in his 500th race start, until [[Matt Kenseth]] joined him in 2013. He was inducted into the inaugural class of the [[NASCAR Hall of Fame]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="NASCAR HF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Inductees|url=http://www.nascarhall.com/inductees/meet-the-inductees/2010|publisher=[[NASCAR Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petty is a second generation driver. His father, [[Lee Petty]], won the first [[Daytona 500]] in [[1959 Daytona 500|1959]] and was also a three-time NASCAR champion. His son [[Kyle Petty|Kyle]] was also a NASCAR driver. His grandson, [[Adam Petty|Adam]] (Kyle's son), was killed in a practice crash at [[New Hampshire International Speedway]] on May 12, 2000, five weeks after Lee's death. Adam's brother Austin works on day-to-day operations of the Victory Junction Gang Camp, a [[Hole in the Wall Gang Camp]] established by the Pettys after Adam's death. Petty married Lynda Owens in 1958. She died on March 25, 2014 at her home in [[Level Cross, Randolph County, North Carolina|Level Cross, North Carolina]] at age 72, after a long battle with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/16795711-first-lady-of-nascar-lynda-petty-dies "First Lady of NASCAR" Lynda Petty Dies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407091132/http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/16795711-first-lady-of-nascar-lynda-petty-dies |date=April 7, 2014 }}, allvoices.com; accessed March 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruce|first=Kenny|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/3/25/lynda-petty-dies-wife-of-richard-petty.html|title=LYNDA PETTY, WIFE OF RICHARD PETTY, DIES AT AGE 72|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=March 25, 2014|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had four children—Kyle Petty, Sharon Petty-Farlow, Lisa Petty-Luck, and Rebecca Petty-Moffit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1872135|title=Lynda Petty|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family resides in Petty's home town of Level Cross, North Carolina and operates [[Richard Petty Motorsports]]. The [[Richard Petty Museum]] was formerly in nearby [[Randleman, North Carolina]] but moved back to its original location in March 2014.

== Racing career ==
Petty was born in [[Level Cross, Randolph County, North Carolina|Level Cross, North Carolina]], the son of Elizabeth ([[married and maiden names|née]] Toomes) and [[Lee Petty|Lee Arnold Petty]], also a NASCAR driver, and the older brother of NASCAR personality [[Maurice Petty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/petty.html|title=Ancestry of Richard Petty|work=wargs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his NASCAR career on July 18, 1958, 16 days after his 21st birthday. His first race was held at [[CNE Stadium]] in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. In 1959, he was named [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year]], after he produced 9 top 10 finishes, including six Top 5 finishes. In Lakewood, Georgia in 1959, Petty won his first race, but his father Lee protested, complaining of a scoring error on the officials' part. Hours later, Lee was awarded the win.

=== The 1960s ===
[[File:RichardPettyRoadrunner.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Petty's famous [[Plymouth Superbird]], on display at The Richard Petty Museum in [[Randleman, North Carolina]]]]
In 1960, he finished 2nd in the NASCAR Grand National Points Race, and got his first career win at the Charlotte Fairgrounds Speedway. 1963 was his breakout year, winning at tracks like [[Martinsville Speedway|Martinsville]] and [[Bridgehampton]]. In 1964, driving a potent [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] with a new [[Hemi]] engine, Petty led 184 of the 200 laps to capture his first [[Daytona 500]], en route to 9 victories, earning over $114,000 and his first Grand National championship.

Joining in the Chrysler boycott of NASCAR due to the organizing body's ban of the Hemi engine, Petty spent much of 1965 competing as a drag racer. Petty Enterprises installed the Hemi in the new compact Barracuda and lettered "OUTLAWED" on the door. He crashed this car at Southeastern Dragway, in Dallas, Georgia, on February 28, 1965, killing a six-year-old boy and injuring seven others.&lt;ref&gt;''Times-Picayune'', March 1, 1965, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Trenton Evening Times'', March 1, 1965, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Petty, his father [[Lee Petty|Lee]], and Chrysler Corporation faced lawsuits totaling more than $1 million, though Petty and his team came to settlements with the lawsuits within 1 month of the suits being filed.&lt;ref&gt;''Plain Dealer'', May 19, 1965, pp. 35, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, a second Hemi Barracuda was built, this time with an altered wheelbase and eventually with Hilborn fuel injection. This car was lettered with a large "43 JR" on the door. The car was very successful, winning its class at the Bristol Spring Nationals and competing in many match races against well known racers such as Ronnie Sox, Don Nicholson, Phil Bonner, Huston Platt, Hubert Platt and Dave Strickler. Even after returning to NASCAR once the Hemi was reinstated, Richard continued drag racing the 43 JR until early 1966.

On February 27, 1966, Richard Petty overcame a 2-lap deficit to win his second Daytona 500 when the race was stopped on lap 198 of 200 because of a thunderstorm. This made him the first driver to win the event twice. 1967 was a milestone year. In that year, Petty won 27 of the 48 races he entered, including a record 10 wins in a row (between August 12 and October 1, 1967). He won his second Grand National Championship. One of the 27 victories was the [[Southern 500]] at [[Darlington Raceway|Darlington]], which would be his only Southern 500 victory. His dominance in this season earned him the nickname "King Richard". He had previously been known as "the Randleman Rocket".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbABCwhdfhAC&amp;pg=PA603&amp;lpg=PA603&amp;dq=richard+petty+the+randleman+rocket&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=G1jXofOYag&amp;sig=R0vcXIvb4MiBGof_CQdflO4svug&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjx-Pm9NTbAhUK34MKHfLRAKs4ChDoAQhBMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=richard%20petty%20the%20randleman%20rocket&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Stock Car Racing [2 Volumes]|last=Freedman|first=Lew|date=2013-03-14|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313387104|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Petty switched brands to Ford, due to his belief the Plymouth was not competitive on super-speedways; he wanted a slippery [[Dodge Charger Daytona|Dodge Daytona]] but Chrysler executives insisted he stay with Plymouth. He would win 10 races and finish second in points. Won back in 1970 by the sleek new [[Plymouth Superbird]] with shark nose and towel rack wing, Petty returned to Plymouth for the 1970 season. This is the car in which Petty is cast in the [[Pixar]] film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' (2006), in which Richard and Lynda Petty had voice roles.

=== The 1970s ===

[[File:RichardPetty43racecar1983.jpg|thumb|right|1983 racecar]]
On February 14, 1971, Petty won his third Daytona 500, driving a brand-new (for 1971) [[Plymouth Road Runner]] and beating [[Buddy Baker]], by little more than a car length en route to another historic year, making him the first driver to win the race 3 times. He won 20 more races (which would make him become the first driver to earn more than $1 million in career earnings) and claimed his 3rd Grand National Championship. At the end of the 1971 season, [[Chrysler]] told the Pettys they no longer would receive direct factory funding support; this gave the Petty team great concern. In 1972, [[STP (motor oil company)|STP]] began what would turn into a successful 28-year sponsorship arrangement with Petty, however it marked the end of his famous all "Petty Blue" paint job. STP previously insisted on an all STP orangish-red color for the cars, but Petty balked and after an all-night negotiation session, the familiar STP orange/"Petty blue" paint scheme was agreed to as a compromise that would find its way to all STP racing operations, most notably [[Gordon Johncock]]'s win in the [[1982 Indianapolis 500]]. Thanks to his 28 Top 10 finishes (25 Top 5 finishes and 8 victories), Petty went on to win his 4th [[NASCAR Cup Series]] championship. 1972 was a year of change in other ways, as it was the last year where Petty would campaign a Plymouth-based race car; as in the middle of the year, he debuted to drive a newly built 1972 [[Dodge Charger]] in a few races (winning one of them), as he believed that the car would have a slight aero advantage over the Plymouth body style. In a driver's duel on February 18, 1973, Petty, in a newly built 1973 Dodge Charger (a body style he would use exclusively until the end of 1977), outlasted Baker (now with the [[K&amp;K Insurance]] Dodge race team) to win his 4th Daytona 500 after Baker's engine gave out with 6 laps to go. A year later, Petty won the Daytona "450" (shortened 20 laps {50&amp;nbsp;mi/80&amp;nbsp;km} due to the [[energy crisis]]) for the fifth time en route to his 5th Winston Cup Championship.

1975 was another historic year for Petty, as he won the [[World 600]] for the first time in his career, one of 13 victories en route to his 6th Winston Cup. The 13 victories is a modern (1972–present) NASCAR record for victories in a season, and was tied in 1998 by [[Jeff Gordon]], although Gordon won 13 out of 33 races, compared to Petty's 13 out of 30 races. In 1976, Petty was involved in one of the most famous finishes in NASCAR history. Petty and [[David Pearson (racing driver)|David Pearson]] were racing on the last lap out of turn 4 in the Daytona 500. As Petty tried to pass Pearson, at the exit of turn 4, Petty's right rear bumper hit Pearson's left front bumper. Pearson and Petty both spun and hit the front stretch wall. Petty's car came to rest just yards from the finish line, but his engine stalled. Pearson's car had hit the front stretch wall and clipped another car, but his engine was running. Members of Petty's pit crew came out onto the track and tried to push the car to the finish line, but ultimately failed. Pearson was able to drive his car toward the finish line, while Petty's car would not restart. Pearson passed Petty on the infield grass and won the Daytona 500. Petty was given credit for second place.

Oddly 1978 will stand out as the one year during his prime that Petty did not visit the winners circle. The Petty Enterprises Team could not get the new 1978 [[Dodge Magnum]] to handle properly, even though much time, effort, and faith were spent massaging the cars. Unhappy with the seven top-five and eleven top ten finishes (including two-second places), Petty decided that his longtime relationship with Chrysler could not continue and he instead began racing a secondhand 1974 [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] at the fall race at Michigan. Returning to the General Motors fold proved successful as Petty recorded six top ten finishes in the final ten races of the 1978 season and finished sixth in the final standings. He would go on to even better results in 1979. Petty won the Daytona 500 in an [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]] and ran most of the remaining races in a Chevrolet, winning four additional races and taking the NASCAR championship for the seventh, and last, time by 11 points which was the closest points margin in NASCAR history until 1992.

=== The twilight years ===
[[File:RichardPetty43car1989.jpg|thumb|right|1989 car at Phoenix]]
Petty won two more Daytona 500s in 1979 and 1981. In 1979, he snapped a 45-race drought, winning his sixth Daytona 500, the first to be televised live flag-to-flag; it would become notorious for a fistfight between competitors following the controversial finish. Petty won the race as the first and second place cars of [[Donnie Allison]] and [[Cale Yarborough]] crashed on the last lap. Petty held off [[Darrell Waltrip]] and [[A. J. Foyt]]. The race is also regarded as being the genesis of the current surge in NASCAR's popularity. The East Coast was snowed in by a blizzard, giving [[CBS]] a captive audience. The win was part of Petty's seventh and last NASCAR Winston Cup Championship. He was able to hold off Waltrip to win the title in 1979.

For 1981, NASCAR dictated that all teams had to show up with the new downsized cars of 110" wheel-base, that Detroit had been building since 1979. Though Petty had been successful with the Chevrolet and Oldsmobile cars he had been running, he wanted to get back to his Mopar roots. After taking a phone call from [[Lee Iacocca]] (who personally asked Petty to campaign a Dodge for 1981), the Petty team built a stunning 1981 [[Dodge Mirada]] and took it to Daytona in January 1981 for high speed tests. Petty's fans were also in a large part fans of his Dodges, so when word got out about the Mirada testing, 15,000 or so showed up on January 17, 1981 at Daytona Speedway to watch Petty put the Dodge through its paces. Sadly for the fans, the car could do no better than 186&amp;nbsp;miles per hour, about eight miles per hour slower than the GM and Ford cars. Petty gave up on returning to Dodge knowing that for the superspeedways the Mirada would not be competitive, and bought a [[Buick Regal]] for the Daytona race. In the 1981 Daytona 500, Petty used a "fuel only" for his last pit stop, with 25 laps to go, to outfox [[Bobby Allison]] and grab his seventh and final Daytona 500 win. This win marked a large change in Petty's racing team. [[Dale Inman]], Petty's longtime crew chief, left the team after the Daytona victory (Inman would win an eighth championship as crew chief in 1984 with [[Terry Labonte]]).

While the 1981 season gave Petty 3 wins, he felt the season was a failure, and the Regals being ill-handling and poor in reliability. For 1982, he made the move to the Pontiac Grand Prix, with the promise of substantial factory support from Pontiac. 1982 was a repeat of 1978, and no victories were to be had. At first, the Grand Prix behaved much like the [[Dodge Magnum]] of 1978, with handling and speed problems. Toward the end of 1982 things improved with several top-10 finishes, which opened the door to a successful 1983 season with three victories, and several top-5 and top-10 finishes. In 1983, he broke his 43-race winless streak from 1982 with a win in the 1983 Carolina 500, barely edging out a young Bill Elliott. After a controversial win at [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] in October 1983 (win No. 198), Petty left the race team his father founded for the 1984 season. He spent '84 and '85 driving for [[Mike Curb]] before returning to Petty Enterprises in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pire3s6v7UA Richard Petty Road To 200 Wins]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 1984, Petty won his 200th (and what would turn to be his final victory) race at the [[1984 Firecracker 400|Firecracker 400]] at [[Daytona International Speedway]]. The race was memorable: On lap 158, [[Doug Heveron]] crashed, bringing out the yellow caution flag, essentially turning lap 158 into the last lap as the two drivers battled back to the start-finish line. Petty and [[Cale Yarborough]] diced it out on that lap, with Yarborough drafting and taking an early lead before Petty managed to cross the start/finish line only a fender-length ahead. (This is no longer possible because of the 2003 rule change freezing the field immediately upon caution. Furthermore, the [[green-white-checkered]] rule was created for if the yellow flag waves with two laps remaining, but not with one lap remaining.) President [[Ronald Reagan]] was in attendance, the first sitting president to attend a NASCAR race. Reagan celebrated the milestone with Petty and his family in victory lane.&lt;ref name="NMAH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&amp;objkey=127|title=Richard Petty's 200th Victory Car|publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=June 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1988, Petty travelled to Australia to help promote a NASCAR exhibition race at the then new [[Calder Park Thunderdome]], the first NASCAR race outside of North America. While he did not compete in the tracks inaugural race, the [[1988 Goodyear NASCAR 500|Goodyear NASCAR 500]] (though his son [[Kyle Petty|Kyle]] did), in testing at the 1.119&amp;nbsp;mi (1.801&amp;nbsp;km) track which owner [[Bob Jane]] had modelled on the [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]], Richard Petty set an unofficial lap record of 28.2 seconds (142.85 mp/h). This would have in fact landed him on pole position for the race as the fastest time in official qualifying was by [[Alabama Gang]] member [[Neil Bonnett]] who recorded a 28.829-second lap (139.734 mp/h) in his Pontiac Grand Prix.

=== Petty's last ride ===
[[File:1993BrickyardtestPetty.JPG|thumb|Petty driving the No. 43 during the [[Brickyard 400]] Open Test at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]].]]
[[File:Petty, Richard (Whitehouse) crop.jpg|thumb|left|Petty in 2006]]
[[File:Richard Petty's first victory flag stand.jpg|thumb|right|Flag stand from Petty's first win]]
On October 1, 1991, Petty announced he would retire after the 1992 season. Petty's final top ten finish came at the 1991 [[Budweiser at the Glen]] which was the same race [[J. D. McDuffie]] was killed in a fifth lap accident. Petty chose to run the entire 1992 season, not just selected events as other drivers have done before retirement. His year-long '''Fan Appreciation Tour''' took him around the country, participating in special events, awards ceremonies, and fan-related meetings. Racing Champions ran a promotional line of diecast cars for every race in Petty's Farewell Tour. In his final year behind the wheel, he had two notable races.

At the 1992 [[Pepsi 400]] on July 4, Petty qualified second. Before the start of the race, he was honored with a gift ceremony which included a visit from President [[George H. W. Bush]]. At the start, Petty led the first five laps, but dropped out on lap 84 due to fatigue.

Despite the tremendously busy appearance schedule, and mediocre race results, Petty managed to qualify for all 29 races in 1992. On his final visit to each track, Petty would lead the field on the pace lap to salute the fans. Petty's final race was the [[1992 Hooters 500|season-ending Hooters 500]] at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]]. The race was notable in that it was the first career start for [[Jeff Gordon]], and it was the second closest points championship in NASCAR history, with six drivers mathematically eligible to win the championship. A record 160,000 spectators attended the race, which went down to the final lap with [[Bill Elliott]] winning the race, and [[Alan Kulwicki]] winning the championship by 10 points over Elliott after [[Davey Allison]] dropped out early after a crash.

Facing intense pressure, Petty barely managed to qualify at Atlanta, posting the 39th fastest speed out of 41 cars. He would not have been eligible for the provisional starting position, and had to qualify on speed. On the 94th lap, Petty became tangled up in an accident, and his car caught fire. Petty pulled the car off the track, and climbed out of the burning machine uninjured. His pit crew worked diligently with less than 20 laps to go to get the car running again, and with two laps to go, Petty pulled out of the pits and was credited as running at the finish in his final race. He took his final checkered flag finishing in 35th position. After the race, Petty circled the track to salute the fans one final time in his trademark STP Pontiac.

The following year, he was back into a race car one more time. On August 18, 1993, NASCAR participated in a tire test at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], in preparations for the [[1994 Brickyard 400]]. Petty drove several laps around the track, and then donated his car to the Speedway's museum.

Petty would again step into a race car in 2003 on the week of the final race under the Winston banner at [[Homestead-Miami Speedway]] and took a solo lap honoring his seven Winston Cup Championships for Winston's salute to the champions.

In 2009 at the Coke Zero 400 in Daytona, for the 25th anniversary of his final, 200th victory in 1984, Petty was behind the wheel of one of his 1980s Pontiac racecars during the pace laps, leading the field for the first pace lap. The field split him and he followed behind the field for one more pace lap before he pulled it in.

=== Petty as an owner ===
In later years of his career, Petty developed the career of crew leader [[Robbie Loomis]], who was at the helm of [[Petty Enterprises]] as crew chief in the 1990s, and won three races—the 1996 [[Checker Auto Parts 500]] at [[Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix]], the 1997 [[Subway 400|ACDelco 400]] at [[North Carolina Speedway]], both with [[Bobby Hamilton]] driving, and the 1999 [[Goody's Body Pain 500]] at [[Martinsville Speedway]], with [[John Andretti]] driving.

He remained as operating owner until his son [[Kyle Petty]] took over day-to-day operations a decade later.

However, in 2008, Kyle Petty was released by [[Petty Enterprises]], and due to lack of sponsorship, Petty Enterprises was bought out by Gillett-Evernham Motorsports. The name was originally going to stay the same, but due to Evernham leaving the team, it was renamed [[Richard Petty Motorsports]], despite [[George N. Gillett, Jr.|George Gillett]] continuing to own the majority of the team.

In November 2010, an investment group including Medallion Financial Corp., [[Douglas G. Bergeron]] and Petty, signed and closed sale on racing assets of Richard Petty Motorsports.&lt;ref name="nydailynews.com"&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/12/14/2010-12-14_taxi_tycoon_andrew_murstein_is_revved_to_build_race_track_in_new_york_bring_spor.html "Taxi tycoon Andrew Murstein is revved to build race track in New York, bring sport to fans"], nydailynews.com, December 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC Sports"&gt;[http://scores.nbcsports.msnbc.com/nascar/story.asp?i=20110816174624103641708&amp;ref=hea&amp;tm=&amp;series=NASCAR ”Ambrose victory validates investment into RPM”], nbcsports.msnbc.com, August 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew M.

=== Petty as a broadcaster ===
In 1995, Petty moved to the television broadcast booth joining [[NASCAR on CBS|CBS]] as a color commentator immediately following his retirement, but his career in television did not last long.

=== Sponsorship ===
Petty promised his mother not to accept [[alcohol sponsorship]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://sports.yahoo.com/nascar/news?slug=jf-petty103009 Petty in a Catch-43] – Jenna Fryer, AP, October 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he never collected purses for the Bud Pole Award, and competed at the [[Busch Clash]] only once, in 1980.

=== Close calls ===
As well as his numerous victories, Petty is also remembered for three of the many incredible crashes that he survived:
* In the 1970 [[Rebel 400]] at Darlington, Petty was injured when his [[Plymouth Road Runner]] cut a tire and slammed hard into the wall separating the track from the pit area. The car flipped several times before coming to rest on its side. This accident injured Petty's shoulder, and helped [[Bobby Isaac]] to win the 1970 Grand National Championship. During the accident, Petty's head hit the track pavement several times, which led [[NASCAR]] to mandate the installation of the Petty-developed safety net that covers the driver's side window.
* In a 1980 race at [[Pocono Raceway|Pocono]], Petty slammed the Turn 2 wall, nearly flipping the car. Petty barely escaped breaking his neck in the wreck and kept his injury hidden from NASCAR officials for the next races, knowing that another wreck could possibly kill him.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Such an incident is unlikely to happen now because of modern NASCAR rules requiring an official series medical liaison to clear a driver after a crash.
* In the 1988 [[Daytona 500]], Petty's crash on Lap 106 hurled parts all over the front stretch at the [[Daytona International Speedway]]. After several flips, Petty walked away with no serious injuries, except for temporary sight loss due to excessive [[g-forces]]. The crash was similar to the accident suffered by [[Bobby Allison]] during the 1987 [[Aaron's 499|Winston 500]] at [[Talladega Superspeedway]] and Carl Edwards 2009 Talladega crash in that all three cars became airborne after turning sideways, and both cars damaged the spectator fencing (though Petty's crash did much less damage to the fencing). Petty's car became airborne despite the use of the [[carburetor]] [[restrictor plate]], which was mandated by [[NASCAR]] for races at Talladega Superspeedway and Daytona International Speedway just prior to the start of the [[1988 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1988 season]].

=== Career awards ===
* He was inducted into the first class of the [[NASCAR Hall of Fame]] on May 23, 2010.
* In 1997, he was inducted into the [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]].
* He was named one of [[NASCAR's 50 Greatest Drivers]] in 1998.
* He was sole stock car representative in the first class inducted in the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 1989.
* He was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom|Medal of Freedom]] by President George Bush in 1992, the first motorsports athlete ever to be honored with this award.

== Life after racing ==
Petty is currently a spokesman for [[Liberty Medical]], [[Cheerios]] and [[GlaxoSmithKline]] products [[Nicorette]] and [[Goody's Powder|Goody's Headache Powder]]. He had also been featured on Brawny towels during a limited time when the company replaced their image with several "real Brawny men". Petty and his son Kyle have lent their talent to host "Lifting It Right" a lift safety training DVD produced and distributed by the Automotive Lift Institute (ALI); it is used in high school vocational programs and community colleges. He has recorded [[public service announcement]]s for [[Civitan International]], a nonprofit organization of which he is a former member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.customerconnection.tv/DIAMONDCLIENTS/CIVITAN/3%20PSAsWMV.wmv Public Service Announcement for Civitan International featuring Richard Petty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529153920/http://www.customerconnection.tv/DIAMONDCLIENTS/CIVITAN/3%20PSAsWMV.wmv |date=May 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is usually seen wearing his trademark sunglasses and a Charlie 1 Horse cowboy hat, with a large snakeskin hat band and a plume of rooster feathers at the front.

Petty has established a summer camp known as "Victory Junction", which is intended to give seriously ill children the outdoors experience and experience of summer camp, and is staffed by round the clock medical staff to be on hand in case of emergencies.
Petty has been a long-time Republican, and in June 2016 he made an appearance on stage with [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abc11.com/politics/on-70th-birthday-trump-holds-greensboro-rally/1384670/#videoplayer]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, he was the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee for [[North Carolina Secretary of State]], but was defeated by State Senator [[Elaine Marshall]] in the general election.  Petty was mistakenly seen as a shoo-in and his campaigning was sporadic.  Following his loss, Petty stated "If I had known I wasn't going to win, I wouldn't have run."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/fix-notes/the-fixs-grab-bag-of-celebrity.html | work=The Washington Post | title=The Fix's Grab Bag of Celebrity Politicians | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cereal "43's" was created with Petty information on the boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/auto_news/112_news030206_king43/|title=Take a Bite Out of "The King" – Richard Petty 43's Cereal|work=[[Motor Trend]]|date=February 6, 2003|accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petty also played himself in the 2008 film ''[[Swing Vote (2008 film)|Swing Vote]]'', where he commends the film's protagonist by allowing him to briefly drive his famous "43" Plymouth.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

After retirement, Petty purchased a 90-acre (36 ha) ranch south of [[Jackson, Wyoming]].&lt;ref name="wyoming"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kingfm.com/wyomings-best-race-car-drivers/ |title=Wyoming's Best Race Car Drivers |publisher=[[KIGN-FM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film and TV appearances ==
* In May 2011, Petty was chosen to be the Grand Marshal for the [[2011 STP 400]] of the Sprint Cup Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansasspeedway.com/Articles/2011/05/The-King-Named-Grand-Marshal.aspx|title=Richard Petty Named Grand Marshal of STP 400 at Kansas Speedway|work=[[Kansas Speedway]]|date=May 26, 2011|accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2011, Petty was featured in the show Modern HotrodZ. Petty's Garage now builds Custom cars for the general public, most of which are Limited Edition.
* He appeared as himself in the movie ''[[Swing Vote (2008 film)|Swing Vote]]'' driving in his famous blue No. 43 car, and letting Bud drive his car to [[Air Force One]] to meet the President.
* Petty voiced [[The King (Cars)|Strip Weathers]], also known as "The King", in the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar Animation Studios|Pixar]] animated movie ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' (2006). His car, the Road Runner Superbird with the distinctive "Petty Blue" tint and the number 43, is also the model used for the car in the movie. The King's accident at the end of the film was also a re-creation of Petty's real-life [[Daytona 500]] accident in [[1988 Daytona 500|1988]] with the exception that it was not caused by a deliberate crash. The bit in which [[Lightning McQueen]] assists him to the finish line is based on the 1976 incident, albeit by the pit crew. Petty's wife Lynda voiced The King's wife, a [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country (1941–1988)|1976 Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] station-wagon (based on Petty's family car), in that movie as well. Petty's character did not appear in ''[[Cars 2]]'' (2011), but did return in ''[[Cars 3]]'' (2017), in which Petty voiced his character as the crew chief of his nephew and new Dinoco racer Hank/Cal Weathers, who was voiced by driver [[Kyle Petty]], who is Richard Petty's son.
* Petty appeared in the [[Tom Cruise]] movie ''[[Days of Thunder]]'' (1990).
* He appeared in the [[Burt Reynolds]] movie ''[[Stroker Ace]]'' (1983).
* Petty appeared as himself in the movie ''43: The Richard Petty Story'' (1972) (a Victory Lane Production, released by Video Gems, distributed by United American Video in 1986).
* In 1989, Petty appeared as himself in the movie ''[[Speed Zone]]'', driving in his famous blue No. 43 car.
* In 1967, Petty appeared in the Elvis Presley movie ''[[Speedway (1968 film)|Speedway]]'' that was shot and filmed at the Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina. This movie was released in 1968.
* He was in ''Petty Blue'', a documentary by NASCAR.

'''Steven Leonard Joyce''' (born 7 April 1963) is a former New Zealand politician, who entered the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]] in 2008 as a member of the [[New Zealand National Party]]. In the same year he became [[Ministry of Transport (New Zealand)|Minister of Transport]] and Minister for Communications and Information Technology. He later became Minister of Science and Innovation, and then served as Minister for [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Finance]] and [[Minister for Infrastructure (New Zealand)|Minister for Infrastructure]].

As a broadcasting entrepreneur with [[RadioWorks]], he was a millionaire before he entered politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&amp;objectid=10600983|title=Key lieutenant makes most of a fast start|date=3 October 2009|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=11 March 2010|first=Patrick|last=Gower}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 March 2018, he announced his resignation from politics.&lt;ref name="Resignation"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bracewell-Worrall|first1=Anna|last2=Lynch|first2=Jenna|last3=Ewing|first3=Isobel|title=Steven Joyce resigns from Parliament|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/03/steven-joyce-resigns-from-the-national-party.html|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=[[Newshub]]|date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Joyce's parents worked as grocers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10543524|title=Former campaign boss the bolter in Key's Cabinet|date=17 November 2008|publisher=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=21 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to school at [[Francis Douglas Memorial College]], before enrolling at [[Massey University]], applying to study [[veterinary medicine|veterinary science]]. However he "missed the cut",&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_A_word"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz-election-2008/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501799&amp;objectid=10537678|title=A word with... Steven Joyce|last=Roughan|first=John|date=16 October 2008|publisher=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; graduating instead with a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] in [[zoology]]. While at university he worked as a presenter and programme director on [[student radio]].&lt;ref name="SST_6m"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sundaystartimes/4761379a6619.html|title=Key's six million dollar man – Steven Joyce|last=Dudding|first=Adam|date=16 November 2008|publisher=Sunday Star Times|accessdate=21 January 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5dzDf0un9?url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sundaystartimes/4761379a6619.html|archivedate=21 January 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also took eleven economics papers at Massey from 1984 to 1986 and failed eight of these through insufficient grade, withdrawal, or failure to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11917623| title=Finance Minister Steven Joyce confirms he dropped out of uni economics papers| work=The New Zealand Herald|access-date=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasting career==
After leaving university Joyce and a group of friends (including radio presenter [[Jeremy Corbett]]) started their own radio station, [[Energy FM (Taranaki)|Energy FM]], in [[New Plymouth]].&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_A_word"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SST_6m"/&gt; With business partners, he built up [[RadioWorks]] over the next seventeen years, both organically and by acquisition, to a network of 22 radio stations and 650 staff. He retired as Managing Director of RadioWorks in April 2001, when [[CanWest]] purchased it, Joyce receiving $6 million for the sale.&lt;ref name="SST_6m"/&gt;

===First term, 2008–2011===
On 8 November 2008, Joyce was elected as a [[Electoral system of New&amp;nbsp;Zealand|list-only candidate]] (ranked 16th on the [[party list]]) at the [[New Zealand general election, 2008|2008&amp;nbsp;election]] in the [[Fifth National Government of New&amp;nbsp;Zealand]] of the [[49th New Zealand Parliament|49th Parliament of New Zealand]] representing the [[New Zealand National Party]].

As a first term [[Member of parliament|MP]], Joyce was appointed to the office of the [[Minister of Transport (New Zealand)|Minister of Transport]] and the office of the [[Minister for Communications and Information (New Zealand)|Communications and Information Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;"Appointment of Ministers" (21 November 2008), 179 [http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/8155efb9e8df9c7ecc25750f0047784d!OpenDocument ''New Zealand Gazette''], pg. 4635.&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce was also appointed as a member of the [[Executive Council of New Zealand|Executive Council]]&lt;ref&gt;"Members of Executive Council Appointed" (21 November 2008), 179 [http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/f0b26c54c2b6dd0ecc25750f00477759!OpenDocument ''New Zealand Gazette''], pg. 4634.&lt;/ref&gt; and was titled as [[The Honourable#New Zealand|The Honourable]] [[Member of Parliament|Steven Leonard Joyce, MP]]. During his tenure as Minister of Transport a number of changes were introduced. In November 2009 a ban on using cellphones while driving came into effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/2750905/Cellphone-ban-comes-with-fines|title=Cellphone ban comes with fines|last=Williams|first=David|date=14 August 2009|work=The Press|accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, New Zealand's unique right-hand rule at intersections was reversed. The minimum driving age was also raised from 15 to 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10629628&amp;pnum=0|title=NZ's right-hand rule set for change|date=3 March 2010|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both measures were subject to cabinet approval and public consultation, and eventually passed into law.&lt;ref name="first actions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.govt.nz/saferjourneys/Documents/Safer%20Journeys%20First%20Actions.pdf|title=Safer Journeys, First Actions|date=March 2010|publisher=Ministry of Transport|accessdate=11 March 2010|location=Wellington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This minimum driving age proposal was criticised by the editorial board of ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' for being too hesitant after experts and the public had favoured raising the driving age as high as 18 and in the opinion of the newspaper, Joyce "had not shown the resolve to follow the recommendations".&lt;ref name="EDIT"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10629519|title=Editorial: Cabinet keeps to slow lane on driving age|date=3 March 2010|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He helped create [[Auckland Transport]] as a [[council-controlled organisation]] for [[Auckland Council|Auckland]]. Joyce stated that "Auckland will need a good agency focused on delivering the projects that have been agreed by council" and noting that Council had a number of ways of ensuring that the entity was accountable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10631260|title=Joyce adamant on city transport giant|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=11 March 2010|first=Bernard|last=Orsman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joyce was also appointed to the Office of [https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2016-go2994 Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment]&lt;ref&gt;"Appointment of Ministers" (27 January 2010) 5 [http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/658bf950ed55760ccc256ce40072801f/e6113ed4e16f69d9cc2576bb00005bcb!OpenDocument ''New Zealand Gazette''], pg. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; replacing Anne Tolley, effective 27 January 2010.

In the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 election]] for the [[50th New Zealand Parliament]] Joyce retained his seat in Parliament (as a list candidate, now rated 13th on the party list) and was appointed to the office of Minister for [[Ministry of Economic Development (New Zealand)|Economic Development]].&lt;ref&gt;"Vice Regal: Appointment of Ministers" (15 December 2011) 193 [http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/70c282b39a4e2bb2cc2579670056d474!OpenDocument ''New Zealand Gazette''], pg. 5651; accessed 25 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand]].

In May 2013, he signed a deal with casino [[Skycity Auckland]], allowing it to install an additional 230 pokie machines and 40 new gambling tables, in exchange for building a $402 million convention centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/skycity-convention-centre-set-create-800-jobs-joyce-5435254|work=TV NZ|title=SkyCity convention centre set to create 800 jobs – Joyce|date=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8664618/Green-Party-threatens-SkyCity-law-repeal|work=Stuff.co.nz|title=SkyCity's pokie full house|date=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third term, 2014–2017===
A [[dildo]] was thrown at him during an anti-[[Trans-Pacific Partnership|TPPA]] protest at the 2016 Waitangi Day celebrations while he was speaking to media. The protester responsible, Josie Butler, a nurse from Christchurch, shouted "That’s for raping our sovereignty". She claimed she was protesting against the TPPA.

These charges were disputed by Labour politicians including [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Opposition Leader]] [[Jacinda Ardern]] and Deputy Leader [[Kelvin Davis (politician)|Kelvin Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Young |first1=Audrey |title=An '$11 billion hole': Expert analysis of Labour's fiscal plan after Steven Joyce called it a 'fiscal hole'|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11917655 |accessdate=23 November 2017| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Satherley|first1=Dan|title=Steven Joyce's 'big fat lie' has backfired – Kelvin Davis|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/09/steven-joyce-s-big-fat-lie-has-backfired-kelvin-davis.html|accessdate=23 November 2017|publisher=[[Newshub]]|date=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2017 election, Joyce stood on the National Party list and was re-elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 General Election – Successful candidates|url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2017/successful-candidates.html|publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]]|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; National won 44% of the popular vote and 56 seats; maintaining its plurality in the New Zealand House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 General Election – Official Results|url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2017/|publisher=Electoral Commission|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, National fell short of the majority needed to govern alone.
