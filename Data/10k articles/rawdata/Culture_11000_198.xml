      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10368">The '''Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus''' (AAT) is a [[controlled vocabulary]] used for describing items of art, architecture, and material culture.  The AAT contains generic terms, such as "cathedral," but no proper names, such as "Cathedral of Notre Dame."  The AAT is used by, among others, [[museum]]s, art libraries, [[archive]]s, [[Cataloging#Cataloging rules|catalogers]], and [[researcher]]s in art and [[art history]].  The AAT is a [[thesaurus]] in compliance with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] and [[NISO]] standards including [[ISO 2788]], [[ISO 25964]] and ANSI/NISO Z39.19.

The AAT is a structured vocabulary of around 44,000 concepts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SPARQL query to count AAT concepts|url=http://vocab.getty.edu/sparql?query=select+%28count%28*%29+as+%3Fc%29+%7B%3Fx+skos%3AinScheme+aat%3A%7D&amp;_implicit=false&amp;implicit=true&amp;_equivalent=false&amp;_form=%2Fsparql|website=Getty Linked Open Data}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 131,000 terms, descriptions, bibliographic citations, and other information relating to fine art, architecture, decorative arts, archival materials, and material culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/|title=Getty Vocabularies (Getty Research Institute)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The AAT project began in the late 1970s in response to the gradual automation of records by art libraries, art journal indexing services, and catalogers of museum objects and visual resources.  Automation required consistency in [[cataloging]] as well as more efficient [[information retrieval|retrieval of information]]; a controlled vocabulary was a solution to both these problems.  The project was conceived by [[library director]]s and architectural experts Toni Petersen, Dora Crouch, and Pat Molholt and was originally headquartered part-time at RPI in Troy, NY, then at Bennington College in Bennington, VT and later moved to [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]], with the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]] providing technical advice and funding.  In 1983 the Getty Trust took over [[editing|editor]]ial responsibility.  The AAT offices relocated to the Getty's Los Angeles headquarters in order to better coordinate with two other similar Getty projects, the [[Union List of Artist Names]] (ULAN) and [[Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names]] (TGN) soon after its publication.

The AAT was published in 1990 and 1994 in both print and electronic form. By 1997, the size and frequency of updates  made hard-copy publication unfeasible and the decision was made to publish via a searchable online Web interface and in data files available for licensing. The online Web interface is freely-accessible from any computer connected to the Internet. Final editorial control of the AAT is maintained by the [[Getty Vocabulary Program]], part of the [[Getty Research Institute]].

Since 2008, Taiwan e-Learning and Digital Archives Program (TELDAP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teldap.tw/en|title=Preface, Taiwan e-Learning and Digital Archives Program, TELDAP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; collaborated with [[Getty Research Institute]] (GRI) in developing the [[Chinese-language]] Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus (AAT-Taiwan). The initial goal of this project is to provide multilingual search and corresponding images in integrate digital archives systems of [[Taiwan]], and broaden the inclusion of terms related to Asian art, architecture and material culture in AAT.

The AAT can be used in several ways:
* at the data entry stage, by catalogers or indexers who are describing works of art, architecture, material culture, archival materials, visual surrogates, or bibliographic materials;
* as knowledge bases, providing information for researchers; 
* as search assistants to enhance end-user access to online resources;
* as target for enriching free-text descriptions of cultural objects;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europeana enriches its data with the AAT|url=http://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-aat|website=Europeana Pro}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* as a pivot vocabulary for coreferencing (interlinking) other art vocabularies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ceri Binding and Douglas Tudhope|title=Vocabulary Linked Data Publication and Mapping|url=http://www.iskouk.org/sites/default/files/Binding_etalSlidesISKO-UK2015.pptx|publisher=ISKO UK 2015 Workshop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AAT is available as [[Linked Open Data]] at vocab.getty.edu&lt;ref&gt;http://vocab.getty.edu&lt;/ref&gt; since February 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/art-architecture-thesaurus-now-available-as-linked-open-data/|title=Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus Now Available as Linked Open Data - The Getty Iris|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is updated bi-weekly.

==Terms==
The initial core set of terms was derived from authority lists and the literature of art and architectural history; this core set was reviewed, approved and added to by an advisory team made up scholars from all relevant disciplines, including art and architectural historians, [[architect]]s, [[librarian]]s, visual resource [[curator]]s, [[archivist]]s, museum personnel, and specialists in [[thesaurus]] construction.  Its [[hierarchy]] was inspired by the [[Medical Subject Headings]].  All eras from antiquity to the present are covered, and it is not limited geographically.

As of January 2007, the AAT contained approximately 131,000 terms. While the thesaurus contains many variations on a term, such as [[grammatical number|singular and plural forms]], spelling variants, various forms of speech, and [[synonym]]s, one is always flagged as the preferred term.  Terms are updated biweekly and regular users are encouraged to propose new terms.

In 2015 AAT contains 354,000 terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SPARQL query to count AAT terms|url=http://vocab.getty.edu/sparql?query=select+%28count%28*%29+as+%3Fc%29+%7B%3Fx+skos%3AinScheme+aat%3A%3B+xl%3AprefLabel%7Cxl%3AaltLabel+%3Fy%7D&amp;_implicit=false&amp;implicit=true&amp;_equivalent=false&amp;_form=%2Fsparql|website=Getty Linked Open Data}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are available in 4 major languages (English, Dutch, Spanish and Chinese), and some terms in various native languages.

==Design==
The AAT is a [[faceted classification]] system as well as a hierarchical one.  There are seven facets:

* Associated Concepts - [[abstract concept]]s, such as beauty, balance, connoisseurship, metaphor, freedom, socialism (Hierarchy: Associated concepts)
* Physical Attributes - perceptible or measurable characteristics such as size, shape, chemical properties, texture and hardness, such as strapwork, borders, round, waterlogged, brittleness. (Hierarchies: Attributes and Properties, Conditions and Effects, Design Elements, Color)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7450">The '''BRD Trilogy''' ({{lang-de|BRD-Trilogie}}) consists of three films directed by [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]: ''[[The Marriage of Maria Braun]]'' (1979), ''[[Veronika Voss]]'' (1982), and ''[[Lola (1981 film)|Lola]]'' (1981). The films are connected in a thematic rather than in a narrative sense. All three deal with different characters (though some actors recur in different roles) and plotlines, but each one focuses on the story of a specific woman in [[West Germany]] after [[World War II]]. The [[three letter acronym]] "BRD" stands for ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'', the official name of West Germany and of the united contemporary Germany.

==Films==
===The Marriage of Maria Braun===

''[[The Marriage of Maria Braun]]'' (1979) begins in the last days of World War II during the rushed marriage ceremony of Maria Braun, after which her husband is sent to battle the advancing [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. After Maria later hears that he has been killed, she becomes the mistress of an [[African American|African-American]] soldier. When Maria’s husband unexpectedly returns alive, she kills the soldier in a scuffle, but her husband takes the blame. Maria becomes the self-centered assistant and lover of a wealthy industrialist and a model of post-war recovery. 

===Veronika Voss===

''[[Veronika Voss]]'' (1982) depicts the twilight years of film actress Veronika Voss in stark black-and-white. A sports reporter becomes enthralled by the unbalanced actress and discovers that she is under the power of a villainous doctor who keeps her addicted to [[opiate]]s in order to steal her wealth. Despite his best attempts, he is unable to save her from a terrible end. The original German title, {{lang|de|Die Sehnsucht der Veronika Voss}}, translates as "The longing of Veronika Voss".

===Lola===

''[[Lola (1981 film)|Lola]]'' (1981) is loosely based on [[Josef von Sternberg]]’s ''[[Der blaue Engel|The Blue Angel]]'' and its source novel ''[[Professor Unrat]]'' by [[Heinrich Mann]]. It tells the story of an upright new building commissioner named Von Bohm who comes to a small town. He falls in love with Lola, innocent of the fact that she is a famed prostitute and the mistress of Shuckert, an unscrupulous developer. Unable to reconcile his idealistic images of Lola with reality, Von Bohm spirals into the very corruption he had sought to fight.

==Background and structure==

Fassbinder had the idea of making a series of films that focus on [[West Germany]] during the "[[Wirtschaftswunder|economic miracle]]" of the 1950s.  The main characters were all female, representing different people in different circumstances.  While the original [[film treatment|treatments]] and stories were developed by Fassbinder himself, the detailed scripts for all three films were written by [[screenwriter]] [[Peter Märthesheimer]], who had worked with the director as a commissioning producer and script editor of some of his TV projects, with the help of his then partner [[Pea Fröhlich]].

The films were shot and released in a slightly different order to their accepted numbering. Maria Braun, released in 1979, is the earliest in terms of both production and the chronology of the plot, beginning in 1945. However it only became part of the trilogy retrospectively, when Fassbinder added the caption "BRD 3" to Lola when it was released in 1981. Veronika Voss, released a year later as Fassbinder's penultimate film before his death, included the caption "BRD 2" and is set in a slightly earlier period than Lola. Fassbinder did not intend the series to stop at a [[trilogy]] but his plans to make further films in the same mould were cut short by his death.

The trilogy was released in a [[DVD]] [[box set]] by the [[Criterion Collection]] in September 2003.

==Unifying elements==

Aside from Fassbinder's original intentions of making films about West Germany after World War II and during the "[[Wirtschaftswunder|economic miracle]]," there are other threads that tie these three distinct films together.

One common thread is the issue of "forgetting the past for the sake of moving to a brighter future."  All the main characters in the three films are trying to overcome their present circumstances, largely created by past experiences. This is a criticism by Fassbinder of West Germany in the 1950s and afterward for "forgetting" its [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] period (i.e. allowing former Nazi officials to function in society, even holding positions of political power) and moving ahead as a country (i.e. regaining international respectability and prestige).  The painful past is neither acknowledged nor confronted in the historical amnesia.

A second parallel is the question of who exactly benefited from West Germany's economic progress.  Fassbinder's view was clearly that some Germans advanced during the "economic miracle," but others fell.  For everyone who has a better life (more wealth, security, and peace), someone else suffers and loses.  Veronika Voss is an example of someone who does not benefit in Germany after the war because her acting career was most prominent during the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]].  Maria Braun is someone who takes a strong initiative to advance economically for the sake of herself and her husband, but she hurts others in the process and in the end is emotionally distant from her husband and her family. Lola tries to take advantage of economic progress and uses her position for advancement, but others who surround her try to achieve the same end with mixed results.

An additional commonality is the inclusion of [[African American|African-American]] soldiers in all three films. In ''The Marriage of Maria Braun'' there are two, a gentlemanly soldier who becomes Maria's lover and another who drunkenly accosts her on a train. The latter character is played by [[Günther Kaufmann]], who also plays African-American soldiers in the other two films. It is unclear if the soldier is supposed to be the same person in all three films. The soldier can be taken as a representation of the influence of the American occupation on post-war Germany, though the fact that he is African-American could have other implications. 

Each of the films employs a very distinctive style (especially in its [[cinematography]]) to better reflect the characters.  ''The Marriage of Maria Braun'' appears with much of its color drained.  ''Veronika Voss'' uses a very rich black and white, similar to [[film noir]] or [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] films of the 1920s.  ''Lola'' is influenced by [[Josef von Sternberg|Josef von Sternberg's]] ''[[Der blaue Engel|The Blue Angel]]'' and uses very bold colors in a manner similar to [[Technicolor]].

'''''Beyond This Horizon''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]]. It was originally published as a two-part serial in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' (April, May 1942, under the pseudonym Anson MacDonald) and then as a single volume by [[Fantasy Press]] in 1948. It was awarded a [[Retro Hugo]] award for best novel in 2018.&lt;ref name="Hugo43"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1943-retro-hugo-awards/ |title=1943 Retro Hugo Awards |publisher=World Science Fiction Society |accessdate=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The novel depicts a world where genetic selection for increased health, longevity, and intelligence has become so widespread that the unmodified '[[control group|control naturals]]' are a carefully managed and protected minority. [[Duel]]ing and the carrying of arms are socially accepted ways of maintaining civility in public; a man can wear distinctive clothing to show his unwillingness to duel, but this results in an inferior social status. The world has become an economic [[utopia]]; the "economic dividend" is so high that [[Post scarcity|work has become optional]]. The chief economic problem is in fact using up the economic surplus: many high-quality goods actually cost ''less'' than those of lower quality. Many people use lower-quality goods as status symbols. The government invests heavily in scientific research, but this has the side effect of further increasing productivity a decade or more later, so long-term projects with no expected economic return are favored above anything but medical research, on the theory that longer lifespans will consume more surplus.

The story's protagonist, Hamilton Felix (surname first), is the archetypal [[superman|übermensch]]. Felix is the penultimate step in a "star line" designed to breed for the highest-quality human characteristics. However, he lacks [[eidetic memory]], which disqualifies him for what many consider to be humanity's most important occupation: that of an "encyclopedic synthesist", one who analyzes the sum total of human knowledge for untapped potential. As such, he finds his life—and the society he lives in—to be enjoyable but meaningless. However, when one of these synthesists seeks him out, inquiring when he plans to continue his line, he finds himself drawn into an adventure which not only gives him purpose but convinces him that his society is worth saving after all.

Major themes in the novel are reincarnation, the immortality of the soul, and telepathy. Hamilton Felix is the product of generations of [[genetic engineering]]. He is almost but not quite the perfect human. In the second half of the book his genetically engineered son is born. The son is the climax of generations of genetic engineering and selective breeding, and is a genetically perfect human. As the son grows he begins to develop almost superhuman mental abilities and a surprising telepathic ability. As the novel draws to a close, it becomes apparent that the son senses that Hamiton Felix's second child, a daughter, is the reincarnation of a wise elderly government official who foresaw her own death and arranged to die shortly before Felix's daughter was born. This official understood that the soul is reincarnated, and in preparation for her own death and reincarnation she was instrumental in the genetic engineering of the son and daughter.

==Reception==
[[Anthony Boucher]] and [[J. Francis McComas]] characterized ''Beyond This Horizon'' as among "the finest science fiction novels of the modern crop."&lt;ref&gt;"Recommended Reading", ''[[F&amp;SF]]'', October 1951, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; [[P. Schuyler Miller]] reviewed the novel favorably, saying "in true Heinlein manner the basic theme of the book smashes the screen of action only in the closing pages."&lt;ref&gt;"Book Reviews", ''[[Astounding Science Fiction|Astounding]]'', February 1949, p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the Japanese visual novel ''[[Eden*]]'', the term 'Felix' is used in the setting to refer to genetically engineered humans with abilities similar to those described in the book, and the connection to Heinlein's work is referred to in dialogue.

[[File:Two complete science adventure books 1952win n7.jpg|thumb|right|''Beyond This Horizon'' was reprinted in ''[[Two Complete Science-Adventure Books]]'' in 1952, appearing under the "Anson McDonald" byline even though the book edition had been published under Heinlein's own name four years earlier]]

The '''Big Rocking Horse''' is a tourist attraction located in the town of [[Gumeracha, South Australia|Gumeracha]], [[South Australia]]. Designed by David McIntosh, the structure weighs 25 tonnes and stands at over 18 metres tall, and is one of a number of [[Australia's big things|Big Things]] in [[Australia]] designed to attract the attention of passing motorists. It is part of a larger complex that includes a wooden toy factory, wildlife park and [[café]]. Owned by the Wilkinson family since the early 1970s, the complex was sold in 2004 and continues to operate today.

== History ==

In 1973, after opening a wooden toy factory in Gumeracha, owner Wal Wilkinson chose to incorporate a large [[roadside attraction]] to the site in order to attract passing traffic.&lt;ref name="Clark2004p191"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|2004|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these was a large wooden [[giraffe]] which stood at approximately five metres in height. This was subsequently replaced by a series of [[rocking horse]]s: a three metre tall horse giving way to a five-metre model, before the process culminated in the decision to build the Big Rocking Horse.&lt;ref name="Morgan19990709"&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|9 July 1999|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting 18.3 metre tall structure was designed by David McIntosh and John Twopenny, and it was opened in 1981 after eight months of construction and an investment of $100,000.&lt;ref name="Clark2004p191" /&gt;

The Big Rocking Horse remained under Wilkinson family's ownership for just over 20 years, although problems arose late in this period with an increase in insurance premiums. Although it remained structurally sound, a fall in 1999 and the change in [[liability insurance]] premiums resulted in the closure of the site to the public in 2001.&lt;ref name="Oakley19991229"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oakley|29 December 1999|p=9}}. The child fell from the platform on the top of the structure to the middle platform, but suffered only minor injuries.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stone20010130"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|30 January 2001|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this date visitors had been able to ascend to a lookout tower on the head of the structure.&lt;ref name="Stone20010130" /&gt;

In September 2003, Graeme Wilkinson placed the Toy Factory—including the Big Rocking Horse—on the market, at an asking price of approximately $900,000.&lt;ref name="DiGirolamo20031008"&gt;{{Harvnb|DiGirolamo|8 October 2003|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sold in 2004 to [[Anthony Miller (Australia)|Anthony Miller]], who had emigrated from [[South Africa]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="Henschke20060602"&gt;{{Harvnb|Henschke|2 June 2006}}. Subsequent to buying the Big Rocking Horse, Miller went on to purchase the nearby [[Warrawong Sanctuary]].&lt;/ref&gt; Under Miller the structure was restored and reopened to the public, with visitor access to the viewing platforms available from April, 2004.&lt;ref name="Innes20041008"&gt;{{Harvnb|Innes|8 October 2004|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes made by Miller, including the reopening of the Big Rocking Horse and the removal of entrance fees to the associated wildlife park, saw an overall increase in visitor numbers to the complex from 65,000 in 2003 to 200,000 in 2006.&lt;ref name="Austin20070609"&gt;{{Harvnb|Austin|9 June 2007|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009 the Big Rocking Horse was purchased by Frans and Lyn Gous, another family of business migrants from South Africa, and remains open to the public.

The Big Rocking Horse is 18.3 metres in height and 17 metres in length.&lt;ref name="Scutt2009p98"&gt;{{Harvnb|Scutt|2009|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Made of [[steel]], the structure weighs 25 tonnes, and it is set in 80 tonnes of concrete to prevent rocking. The steel frame was fabricated by Halwell Engineering in [[Adelaide]] and transported by road to the site, after which the steel cladding was attached.&lt;ref name="Clark2004p191" /&gt; Stairs incorporated inside the rocking horse lead to three viewing platforms: one at the head, one on the saddle, and a third on the "rocker bows" near the base of the structure.&lt;ref name="Clark2004p191" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morgan19990709"/&gt;

The Big Rocking Horse is part of a larger complex incorporating the Toy Factory, a [[Cafeteria|cafe]] and a wildlife park. The factory sells a large range of wooden toys and souvenirs, while the wildlife park (which covers approximately seven acres), features a number of native and introduced species, including [[emu]]s and [[kangaroo]]s.&lt;ref name="Clark2004p192"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|2004|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Wallace Foster''' (January 23, 1932 &amp;ndash; May 10, 2000), known as ''The Fox'', was an [[MC]] on the first season of [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Man Show]]'' under the show's original hosts, [[Adam Carolla]] and [[Jimmy Kimmel]]. He was billed as "The World's Fastest Beer Drinker", a feat which he performed in an appearance on the TV show ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'' as well as numerous times on ''The Man Show''.

==Career==
Foster was a performer of what he called "songs your mother wouldn't sing." Foster had an album called ''Songs Banned in Boston'', which is out of print. Prior to his television career he owned ''The Fox Inn'', a bar in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[California]], where he performed nightly from 1961 to 1989.  The Fox also spent time playing on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas's campus between 1972-1987.  He regularly chugged beers on campus while playing his piano and singing, long before alcohol consumption laws were ever enforced on campus. Foster appeared as a champion fast beer drinker and demonstrated his skill in a 1978 episode of ''Taxi'', "The Great Line". Foster was also featured on an episode of [[NBC]]'s early 80s reality TV show ''[[Real People]]''.

Bill was crowned King of the 12th Occasional Doo Dah Parade in Pasadena, California on November 13, 1988.  He presided over the Parade on November 27, 1988, along with Queen Richelle Small.

As an MC on ''[[The Man Show]]'', Foster chugged beers and sang songs with the audience. He could chug two mugs of beer in less than two seconds, typically after performing the traditional German drinking cheer, "''Zicke, Zacke, Zicke, Zacke, Hoi, Hoi, Hoi!''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://einprosit.us/ Zicke zacke toast lyrics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Zicke zacke zicke zacke hoi hoi hoi|Zicke zacke zicke zacke hoi hoi hoi at the German Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;  

After the sale of ''The Fox Inn'', Foster continued to perform with his companion and agent Nancy Grade in and around Los Angeles. He played regular engagements at Weber's in Reseda, Mom's Cantina in Brentwood, MVP Sports Bar in Simi Valley, and American Pie in Santa Monica.

==Death==
On May 10, 2000, Foster died at his home in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] after a long battle with [[prostate cancer]]. Carolla and Kimmel discussed ''The Fox'' being in the hospital during the first episode of Season 2. During the episode's epilogue, a message read:{{quote|Shortly after taping this episode, our good friend "''The Fox''" passed away from Prostate Cancer. His family asks that we honor his memory by urging our male viewers to get their prostates checked regularly. With early detection his death could have been prevented. We will miss him a lot...}} The hosts continued ''The Fox's'' cheer "''Zicke Zacke Zicke Zacke hoi hoi hoi!''" and chug at the end of every episode.

In the [[history of the United States]], a '''clean living movement''' is a period of time when a surge of health-reform crusades, many with moral overtones, erupts into the popular consciousness. This results in individual, or group reformers such as the anti-tobacco or alcohol coalitions of the late twentieth century, to campaign to eliminate the health problem or to "clean up" society. The term "Clean Living Movement" was coined by [[Ruth C. Engs]], a Professor of Applied Health Sciences at [[Indiana University]] in 1990.

==Background Information==

Cycles of social reforms have been observed in religion, politics, the economy and other areas of human endeavor. Reforms to clean up society in regard to  issues related to health also appear to come in cycles. Reform campaigns during Clean Living Movements include [[Temperance movement|temperance]] (anti-alcohol), social purity (sexuality), diet, [[physical exercise]], [[eugenics]] (heredity), [[public health]], and anti-[[tobacco]] and drug campaigns. Interest in these issues rise and fall more or less simultaneously and often follow a religious [[wiktionary:awakening|awakening]] in which both evangelical sentiments and the development of new sects emerge.  The movements also coincide with episodes of [[xenophobia]] or [[moral panic]] in which various minorities are targeted as undesirable influences for medical or moral reasons.

In the [[United States of America]], and to somewhat of a lesser extent in the [[United Kingdom]] and other Western [[Europe]]an cultures, these health reform movements tend to come in approximate 80-year cycles, ranging from about 70 to 90 years for individual issues. However, the campaign to eliminate [[polio]] would not be considered a clean living movements as it was a single issue crusade.

Reformers in these movements first attempt to convince individuals they should not drink, smoke or engage in behaviors or lifestyles harmful to health. When this does not work, public policies to prohibit the behaviors are instituted. After the main thrust of the movement, when reformers have failed to change behaviors even by legislation, a hereditarian, or eugenics movement reaches its prime. Reformers may reason that the root causes must be in the [[genes]]. During the cycle's ebb, popular changes or reforms that make sense, such as [[personal hygiene]] or [[sanitation]], become institutionalized. On the other hand, a backlash often emerges against unpopular or restrictive reforms, such as [[prohibition]] of alcohol.

In the United States, widespread health agitation and subsequent reforms have, within a decade or so, coincided with the religious awakenings of the Jacksonian (1830-1860), the Progressive (1890-1920), and the Millennial (1970-) reform eras.

==Jacksonian Era Clean Living Movement (1830–1860)==

During the Jacksonian era  and out of the second great awakening a crusade against "Demon rum" and other spirits ensued in states east of the Mississippi River and north of the [[Mason–Dixon line]]. This resulted in statewide prohibition of alcohol in this region beginning in the state of Maine in 1851. However, rampant smuggling across the Ohio River and down from Canada soon ended these state laws as they were unenforceable.  Various ethnic, cultural, and religious minorities such as [[Irish American|Irish immigrants]] and [[Anti-Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] were held up as moral examples during the period, thought to be responsible for both excessive drinking and the spread of diseases such as [[cholera]].

During this era a focus on exercise, non-use of tobacco, and the elimination of coffee, tea, sugar, meat and spice from a diet, called "Grahamism," – named after reformer [[Sylvester Graham]] – was promoted. Eugenic or "hereditarian" concerns that masturbation would lead to [[insanity]] and that choosing sick or feeble spouses would lead to further degeneration was discussed. Out of this era [[Phrenology]] – the study of shapes and bumps on the head –  used to select a healthy marriage partner was  popular. New religions that promoted "pure" lifestyles such as [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and [[Seventh-day Adventists]] emerged.

==Progressive Era Clean Living Movement (1890–1920)==

The [[Progressive era]]'s health reform movement emerged in the third great awakening. Individual health crusades, as part of an overall Clean Living Movement, included the temperance and the anti-saloon movement which evolved into the prohibition movement. This resulted in the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]], or [[prohibition]]. An anti-tobacco movement was found during this era and a number of cities had anti-smoking laws in public buildings. Trains, restaurants, and streetcars often had smoking and non smoking sections. However, these laws by the mid twentieth-century were generally  ignored.

The first regulation of [[narcotic]] drugs were enacted during this period, regulating the contents of [[patent medicine]]s.  The first [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], regulating the labelling of patent medicines and the claims made in their advertising, was passed in 1906.  The smoking of [[opium]] was prohibited by the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] of 1914 as an exotic vice imported with immigration from [[China]].  In addition to these drug prohibitions, further immigration from East Asia was sharply curtailed by the [[Immigration Act of 1924|Asian Exclusion Act]] of 1924.  Likewise, the prohibition of [[cocaine]] during this period was associated with anecdotes about [[African American]]s committing crimes under the influence of the drug.

A "purity" or anti-[[prostitution]] and social hygiene ([[sexually transmitted diseases]]) movement went hand in hand with the elimination of  other supposed evils, such as alcohol, from society. The purity movement also included the elimination of the [[double standard]] of sexuality for men and women. The eugenics movement to improve the human race was intertwined with these other movements. Pre-marital testing to ensure that neither partner had [[syphilis]] were passed in many states. In the United States, Eugenic [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] laws were passed to prevent individuals with severe mental or physical health problems including [[alcoholism]] from reproducing were instituted in over 30 states

==The Millennial era (1970–Present)==

The Clean Living Movement around the turn of the twenty-first century was characterized by many crusades and counter crusades. Activities that surged in the earlier years of the era were often met with counter-movements about ten years later. For example, "women’s liberation" was countered by a "pro-family" movement; the use of [[marijuana]] and other [[drugs]] was followed by a "war on drugs"; lowering of the drinking age was followed by a raising of the drinking age; non-marital sexual activity was challenged by a new "purity" movement; and legal rights to obtaining abortions ("pro-choice") were met with agitation against [[abortion]] ("pro-life").

The [[baby boom generation]] of the post World War II era had experimented with different behaviors not tolerated by the older generation. By the mid 1970s more conservative  Americans began to react against what they perceived as immoral  behaviors. They coalesced into political action that included campaigns against the use of drugs, alcohol, sexual, and other activities. A secular health-reform movement, that to some became a "religion," also surged out of the youthful generation. Fitness and exercise, diet, alternative religions and medicine, consumers rights, smoke-free environments, and other health reforms became prime concerns of the day.

As originally conceived, Powers saw the public watching volunteers undergoing actual [[waterboarding]].&lt;ref name=NYMag2008-06-27/&gt;
''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that on August 17, 2008 Powers brought in [[Mike Ritz]], a former US official experienced in administering waterboarding, for a one time demonstration of waterboarding on volunteers.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost2008-08-17/&gt;  
This demonstration was not open to the general public, but rather for an invited audience.
Powers himself was one of the volunteers.

As built, the [[Amusement ride|thrill ride]] was a diorama, where viewers would mount stairs to a window where they would see a tableau of two models, one a captive, one a masked interrogator.  The captive was wearing an [[Guantanamo captives' uniform|orange uniform]] "[[non-compliant]]" captives wear in the [[United States]]' [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]s, in [[Cuba]], and was spread-eagled on a tilted table.

When the piece was installed, in July 2008, viewers inserted a dollar the interrogator figure would pour water onto a rag over the captive figures' nose and throat, upon which the captive figure would start convulsing.

The piece was installed in a row of ordinary Coney Island freak shows and [[concession stand|concessions]].
When installed the thrill ride triggered coverage and commentary around the world.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Contra vim mortis non crescit herba in hortis''''' (or '''''Contra vim mortis non crescit salvia in hortis''''', [[Latin language|Latin]] meaning "''No herb grows in the gardens against the power of death''", or "''No [[Salvia|sage]] grows in the gardens against the power of death''", respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casperson|first1=John W.|title=A Chalice of Miracles|isbn=9781434395016|page=422|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_CpIlp-e7JQC&amp;pg=PA422}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a phrase that appears in [[medieval literature]]. The broader meaning of the maxim is, "''Although you search any garden, you won't find a medical remedy against the lethal power of death''". The second wording that uses ''salvia'' in place of ''herba'' is a [[wordplay]] with the name of "[[salvia]]" (sage), which literally means healer or healthmaker.

Like many adages and maxims handed on from the Latin cultural tradition, this line is a [[hexameter]], the rhythmical verse typical of the great epic poetry in both [[Greek literature|Greek]] and [[Latin literature]].

According to [[Jan Wielewicki]] in his ''Dziennik spraw Domu zakonnego OO. Jezuitów u św. Barbary w Krakowie'', these words were said by [[Sigismund III Vasa]] on his deathbed. In ''[[Das Buch der Zitate]]'' by [[Gerhard Hellwig]], the phrase appears in ''[[Flos medicinae]]''.

'''''Courtship Rite''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Donald Kingsbury]], originally serialized in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'' magazine in 1982. The book is set in the same universe as some of Kingsbury's other stories, such as "Shipwright" (1978) and the unpublished ''The Finger Pointing Solward''.

In the UK, the novel was entitled ''Geta'', and in France, ''Parade nuptiale''.

''Courtship Rite'' was the first winner of the [[Compton Crook Award]] for best first novel, was nominated for the [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Best Novel]] in 1983 and won the 2016 [[Prometheus Award|Prometheus Hall of Fame Award]].

== Setting ==

=== Geta ===
Geta is a harsh planet settled by humanity centuries before the novel begins.  The planet has one large satellite, Scowlmoon; the two are in a mutual [[Tidal locking|tidal lock]], so the moon is only visible from half the planet. The planet's day is about half as long as Earth's.  Geta is much drier than Earth, with eleven separate bodies of water large enough to be called seas; most of the land area is desert.

The Njarae Sea, the largest, is a narrow body extending around a quarter of the planet's circumference from northeast to southwest. Much of the story takes place in lands along the east coast of the Njarae.&lt;!-- 
In Chapter 9, it says, "Sorrow hugged the western shore formed by the Wailing Mountains." However, other descriptions implicitly put it on the eastern shore, e.g. in Chap. 6, "Getasun, as usual, rose swiftly through the sky, carrying its forge orange bulk out to sea where it would set beside the stationary Scowlmoon before Oelita could reach home."
--&gt;
[[Terraforming]] was never, or very minimally, initiated on the planet's [[biosphere]], leaving it very inhospitable to the descendants of the original settlers, who have become mythic, God-like creatures to its denizens.

Apparently the only Earth-life on Geta are humans, [[bee]]s, and the "Eight Sacred Plants", including [[wheat]], [[soybean]]s, [[barley]], and [[potato]]es.
Native, "profane" life includes plants, a wide variety of sea-creatures and "insects", but no large land-animals. 
Each has a different biochemistry, so each is largely toxic to the other.
Parts of certain profane species can be eaten if prepared correctly.
As a result, food is a commodity that is very precious on Geta, and in most places the only source of meat is humans themselves. [[Cannibalism]] has insinuated itself into the very fabric of social and religious life.
On the other hand, humans are not at risk of infection from native bacteria, and seem not to have brought any pathogens with them.

The planet seems to have been settled centuries before the time of the story by a small group, possibly not by choice.  
Apparently, they made little use of printed materials that could be read in a world without advanced technology. Most knowledge of history and the larger universe was therefore lost, the remainder preserved by oral tradition in "Chants" and stories.
The settlers' ship remains in orbit, but its nature has been forgotten; it is generally referred to as "God". The Horse survives only as a piece in [[chess]], named for a "[[Knight (chess)|mythical sidestepping insect]]".

''Courtship Rite'' is set in a time of rapidly advancing technology. 
The Getans are past masters of [[biology]] and [[genetics]], capable of modifying organisms [[gene]] by gene. 
Apparently this knowledge was maintained from the time of landing, being necessary for survival.
They also make use of [[steam engine]]s and electricity, but are handicapped by an apparent lack of fossil fuels to smelt metals and provide power. 
They have sailing ships on the seas, and [[sailplane]]s, but no powered aircraft. 
As a consequence, few Getans travel far from home; a few have become famous by walking all the way around the world.
At the beginning of the story, one clan, the Kaiel, has developed radio, and are exploiting the advantage of communicating much faster than their rivals. They also develop bicycles and other pedal-powered vehicles using light, metal-spoked wheels.
They have also learned how to extract information from a "Frozen Voice of God" — an optical data-storage crystal left over from the original settlers.

Socially and politically, Geta has no nation-states in the way we recognize the term. 
The "priest clans" have precedence, governing territories and the resident members of the underclans.
In particular, they have the power of deciding, during times of [[famine]], who must make the ultimate "Contribution to the Race":
All individuals are rated in various ways on their "kalothi", or fitness to survive. When the need arises, those lowest on the list are required to perform "Ritual Suicide".
The ordinary clans have generally evolved into differing niches based on some attribute or inclination of their founders. 
For instance, the Ivieth specialize in transportation and haulage duties. "Before puberty an Ivieth hauled his load or was walked to death and eaten."
The o'Tghalie have an ability to perform complex mathematical problems.

== Plot introduction==
The novel details the attempts of two of the priest-clans, the Kaiel and the Mnankrei, to expand into territory controlled by the Stgal.
Ultimately, all the priest clans are trying to attain dominance of the planet through the use of new technology, propaganda, treachery, and "war", a new concept in this world. Previously, killing was done merely in order to provide food.

[[Jo Walton]] remarked that ''Courtship Rite'' "is about a distant generation of colonists on a planet with no usable animals. This is the book with everything, where everything includes cannibalism, [[polyamory]], evolution and getting tattoos so your skin will make more interesting leather when you’re dead."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/06/ok-where-do-i-start-with-that-k "K" authors] by Jo Walton&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[John Clute]], although troubled by its didactic libertarianism and [[Social Darwinism]] as well as the way Kingsbury "rigs his Getan society" to establish his political ideas, concluded that "the book is a considerable accomplishment, that it's a feast (of the imagination) and great fun while it lasted, within its covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Cowles Art School''' (aka '''Cowles School of Art''') was a studio building on 148 Dartmouth Street, [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], United States, that was established in 1883 and continued operation until 1900.&lt;ref name="bacon1886"&gt;Edwin Munroe, George Bacon, Edward Ellis. Bacon’s Dictionary of Boston. 1886. P. 123-124.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was one of the largest art schools in the city, having several hundred scholars.

By the end of the 19th century, Boston had become an important art center.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} A number of highly respected artists were teaching in city. The rich environment for art had been promoted at least in part by the Massachusetts Drawing Act of 1870. The act mandated drawing lessons in public schools. To fill the need for art teachers, [[Massachusetts Normal Art]] (MNA) was established in 1873. Two blocks behind the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]], in the New Studio Building near the [[Back Bay Station]], was the Cowles Art School (1883).

Cowles Art School offered instruction in figure drawing and painting from the flat cast and life, artistic anatomy, perspective and composition, painting still life, drawing and painting the head from life, drawing still life, oil and water colors, ad perspective.&lt;ref name="bacon1886" /&gt;

{{Culture of Croatia}}
[[File:Međimurska narodna nošnja (Croatia).jpg|thumb|right|260px|Women from [[Međimurje]] (northern Croatia) in traditional folk costume.]]
'''Croatian national costume''' or '''Croatian dress''' ({{lang-hr|narodna nošnja}}, plural: ''narodne nošnje'') refers to the traditional clothing worn by Croats living in [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]], with smaller communities in [[Hungary]], [[Austria]], [[Montenegro]], and [[Romania]]. Since today Croats wear Western-style clothing on a daily basis, the [[national costume]]s are most often worn with connection to special events and celebrations, mostly at ethnic festivals, religious holidays, weddings, and by dancing groups who dance the traditional [[Croatian kolo]], or circle dance.

Each [[List of regions of Croatia|cultural and geographical region]] has its own specific variety of costume that vary in style, material, color, shape, and form. Much of these regional costumes were influenced by the [[Austria]]n, [[Hungary|Hungarian]], [[Germany|German]], [[Italy|Italian]], or [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] presence, due to whichever power ruled the region.&lt;ref name="Hrvatski foklor: Narodne nošnje"&gt;[http://www.hrvatskifolklor.com/php/narodnanosnja.php Hrvatski foklor: Narodne nošnje] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125153732/http://www.hrvatskifolklor.com/php/narodnanosnja.php |date=2010-01-25 }} {{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main attire==
[[File:Dinarska nosnja KUU Zvona Zagore Knin 04082011 4910.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Men's Dinaric style costume.]]
For the female dress, attire consists of a plain white dress or blouse (''košulja'') or underskirt (''skutići''), which is usually the basic form of the costume. It is then added with other clothing and decorations, which may include another overdress or skirt (''kotula''), a decorative jacket (''djaketa'', ''paletun'' or ''koret''), apron (''ogrnjač'' or ''pregjača''), scarf (''ubrsac''), kerchief or shawl which are usually decorated with a floral or animal motif. The embroidery is very intricate and is usually red, white, blue, gold, or black. Her jewellery, ranging from necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and rings could consist of [[gold]], [[silver]], beads, [[pearl]]s, or even corral from the [[Adriatic]]. Hair is interwoven into one or two braids and decorated with red ribbons for girls or women that are unmarried, while married women wear woven or silk kerchiefs on their heads. Costumes of brides consists of a crown or wreath often made of flowers (''vijenac'') and large amounts of jewelry. The woman's head could be adorned by a kerchief, cap, or a headdress, the most famous being the headdresses worn by the women from the island of [[Pag (island)|Pag]]. The amount of paraphernalia a woman is adorned with, either very much or rarely any at all, depends on the region. Completing the costume are stockings (''bječve'') or knee-high socks, and boots or a special kind of sandal called [[opanci]].&lt;ref name="Hrvatski foklor: Narodne nošnje"/&gt;

For the males, the national dress usually consists on loose, wide slacks (gače širkoke) and a shirt, and both are usually either black or white, or both. The man may wear a decorative or plain [[vest]] (''fermen'' or ''jačerma''), over his shirt, and possibly a [[waistcoat]]. The man almost always wears a cap, varying in shape and design depending on the region. The most famous cap is perhaps the [[Lika cap]], worn in the [[Lika]] region for centuries by the people. Footwear, like the women's', consists mainly on boots and sandals. Because of the weather, certain places often have woolen vests, cloaks, coats, or fur for the colder regions, and silk and light linens for the warmer climates.&lt;ref name="Hrvatski foklor: Narodne nošnje"/&gt;

There are four main types of costumes associated with the regions: the [[Pannonia]]n style in the north and east, the continental or [[Dinara|Dinaric]] style, and the [[Adriatic|coastal]] style on the coast.&lt;ref&gt;''Dance Occasions and Festive Dress in Yugoslavia'', Elsie Dunin.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Croatia==

===Slavonia and Baranya===
[[File:Nosnje oko Vinkovaca EMZ 300109.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Croatian national dress from [[Vinkovci]] ]]
Both [[Slavonia]] and [[Baranya (region)|Baranya]] are located in the east, and are associated with the Pannonian style of dress and the [[Šokci]]. In Slavonia, the costumes tend to be very elaborate, with floral designs and clothing with silk or wool, fancy embroidery, decorative silk ribbons and bows, lace work, gold or silver jewelry, corals, amber necklaces and pearls for the women. The colors of the dresses tend to be bright and numerous, with colors ranging from gold, red, blue, white, and black all in one costume. The top shirt, or ''odnjica'', of the costume has fringed-wing sleeves, which is generally associated with the Pannonian style.

For the men, they tend to wear not as many colors for the shirt and pants, but often wear thick coats or vests with designs and patterns stitched on and fancy embroidery like the women. Their sleeves might have a slight ruffle at the end, but not as much as the women's' In Baranya, a part of the men's costume is a small apron that is worn over the trousers that ranges in color and design.

===Posavina and Podravina===
[[File:Nosnje Pozeska kotlina Slavonska Podravina EMZ 300109.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Podravina]] style dress]]
[[Posavina]] and [[Podravina]] are both in the north, north-east part of Croatia. Unlike the Slavonians, the costumes from Posavina do not focus on too much elaborate designs and patterns, and instead consists of simple black and white blouses, trousers, and skirts. The men wear black vests and black hats while the women wear beautiful silk shawls, usually blue or red in color with flower motifs. A thick apron with embroidered designs could be worn as well, and their color and detailed patterns are often the main focus of the costume.

Although the clothing may be plain, the shawls and/or aprons worn over the blouses and skirts make up for the plain attire in [[Podravina]], and they are sometimes so colorful and richly garnished with patterns that they completely cover up the main dress. The women in Podravina style their own kerchiefs with a unique embroidery from the region, and they wear aprons over their dresses which are colorful and geometric in design and attached with a multi-colored fringe. The men's vests are usually red or black and color and are garnished with intricate patterns and embroidery as well.

===Međimurje, Zagorje and Zagreb region===
[[File:Nosnje Stupnik Remetinec Brezovica Lomnica EMZ 300109.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Dress from the vicinity of [[Zagreb]] ]]
[[File:Nosnje Medjimurje EMZ 300109.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Dress from [[Međimurje]] ]]
[[Međimurje]], [[Hrvatsko Zagorje|Zagorje]] and [[Zagreb]] are all located in the north, and are therefore influenced by the continental style. White garments are typical for the continental region, but each has its own decorative scarves, shawls, aprons, and jewellery. Red is the most popular color, especially in Zagorje, and the aprons and vests worn by the men and women are red with elaborate stitching and embroidery, mostly with gold thread. Women wear colorful shawls and kerchiefs which are usually red with flower designs. The second most popular color is black, which could have gold or white embroidery, or none at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ma-la.hr/a1.pdf Narodna Nosnja; Međimurje, p.8-9.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Very often, the men and women would not wear any aprons or shawls, and their costumes would mostly consist of their white garments, which they may stitch a border of color at the ends, or add a sash (''tkanica'') for some color.

Hats are an important part of a male's costume, and can come in two forms: the traditional Pannonian hat (''škrlak'') is black and dome-shaped, with a red wool band embroidered with multi-colored thread and white and gold dots attached, or the black felt box-hat (''šešir'') folded into a flat bow at the back with a grosgrain ribbon tied around the body.&lt;ref&gt;''Dance Occasions and Festive Dress in Yugoslavia'', by Elsie Dunin.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the grosgrain ribbon, red, white and blue strings are often tied around the hat (e.g. the Croatian tri-color).

===Istria===
[[File:Nosnje Komaji EMZ 1300109.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Dalmatian style]]
The costumes from [[Istria]] are influenced by the Adriatic style of the coast.

The men's costumes are typically blue or brown or white, and consist of white, ankle length trousers that are tighter than the Slavonian style, shirts, and leather vests. Coats worn over them are generally short and long-sleeved or long, sleeveless ones. Accessories include wide silk belts, red or black caps, and cotton socks worn over their footwear called [[opanci]] (strapped soft soled sandals).

Women on the coast wear broad-sleeved white blouses that are embroidered in silk or lace, as well as pleated skirts or dresses varying in color, and stockings under their ''opanci''. They also cover their shoulders with colorful shawls called ''oplece'', which cover the shoulders and tie around the neck, hanging over their arms and upper-chest. Jewellery is made of colorful glass beads and silver coin discs, which are found hanging around the neck and waist by string of leather.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istrianet.org/istria/literature/travel/jackson_fh/02-races.htm The Races and Their Customs]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lika===
[[File:Nosnje okolica Perusica EMZ 1300109.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Costume from [[Perušić]] ]]
The costumes of [[Lika]] show testament to both the Dinaric and Ottoman influence of the region. Due to the [[Croatian Military Frontier|military history]] of the region, costumes can vary from civilian to military-wear. Because of the ruralness of the region and the prevalence of sheep, wool is spun and dyed (usually red, black, yellow and green) and fur coats and capes are common because of the cold winter weather.

Women tend to wear skirts down to their ankles and a white blouse. Their attire is generally in earth-tones, with white, brown, and black being most common, however, blue dresses and aprons are reserved for married women, while white is for the unmarried ones. Unlike the Croats from the north, the special sandals ([[opanci]]) are worn daily. However, liberties are taken with the apron, which is often woven with colorful stitching and patterns with geometric motifs. Multi-colored wool socks (''priglavci'' or ''nazuvci'') with various geometric design are worn over the ''opanci''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Dance occasions and festive dress in Yugoslavia'', by Elsie Dunin.&lt;/ref&gt;  For headwear, women wear embroidered kerchiefs or white kerchiefs pinned to their hats. Jewelry such as earrings, bracelets, and necklaces are silver, and necklaces (''djerdan'') and earrings are often made of silver coins, traditionally from the 19th century Austrian coins (''talira'').&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The costume of the men varies when taking military uniform in consideration. A simple costume would have trousers and a linen shirt of either white, black or brown color (or blue for military men). The vests can be made of leather, or wool that are either black or red, and can be simple with no designs, or very elaborately designed with intricate patterns. Black or blue coats or capes made of lamb fur are worn during the winter. Red belts or sashes are tied around their waists and used to hold guns or swords, a remnant from the military era. A special carved knife from the Ottoman days (called a ''handžar'' or ''nož'') are mainly used.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A special cap exclusive to the region is the [[Lika cap]] that is worn by all men, regardless of social position.

===Dalmatia===
[[File:Nosnje Ravni Kotari EMZ 1300109.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Costume from northern Dalmatia.]]
[[File:Alkarski Momak portrait.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A man from [[Sinj]].]]
[[File:Alkarski Momak detail.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Detail of belt and weapons.]]
[[Dalmatia]]n costume varies from within its own region; while the coastal areas are Adriatic and coastal in influence, the inner area, called [[Zagora (Croatia)|Zagora]], shows the Dinaric influence similar to the style of Lika and [[Herzegovina]].

Perhaps the most famous example of Zagora costume comes from the small town of [[Vrlika]], rich in dance and tradition still carried  on today. Both men and women's dress wear is characterized by multiple subjects of clothing over another.&lt;ref name="vrlika.hr"&gt;[http://www.vrlika.hr/podstranice/kultura.html Grad Vrlika: Kultura; Vrlička narodna nošnja] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118060257/http://www.vrlika.hr/podstranice/kultura.html |date=2010-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For men, the costume consists of carefully chosen pieces worn over each other: a red sash is tied around dark pants with a fringe of threads hanging from the belt in red, blue, or green colors. Due to centuries of military mentality, a special leather belt is worn to carry weapons.&lt;ref name="vrlika.hr"/&gt; Over the shirt is a decorated tunic, elaborate in design and custom-made fringe. The vest that is worn is vastly decorated with gold and red embroidery and patterns and designs, with different styles or material and cut depending on the seasonal weather. Much like the men, the women's dress consists of clothing worn over more clothing: a white blouse, skirt or tunic is most common, with a colorful apron consisting of complicated geometric patterns and fringe worn over, as well as a red vest with gold stitching made in a way to make it stand out from the white blouse.&lt;ref name="vrlika.hr"/&gt; Jewellery consists mainly of beads worn around the neck and silver coins adorned around the costume. Both men and women wear red felt pillbox caps (''bareta'' or ''crvenkapa''), with a white habit attached to the women's'.

From the coast, the national costume of [[Dubrovnik]] consists mainly of white, black, gold, and red colors. Both men and women wear vests rich with gold embroidery while the women wear the recognizable gold tassels decorating the front blouse and fine jewelry such as earrings, necklaces and hair clips. Men and women usually wear white or black trousers or skirts respectively.

===Islands===
[[File:Nosnje Pag EMZ 300109.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Croatian national dress from the island of [[Pag (island)|Pag]] ]]
The [[List of islands of Croatia|islands of Croatia]] have the most variation in dress due to their geographic distance and isolation from one another. They find more similarity with Dalmatia and Istria, but many have their own unique styles not seen elsewhere.

For example, the national costume from the island of [[Pag (island)|Pag]] has its origins in the fifteenth century, and is characterized by the intricate lace that decorates the front part of blouses and the edges of kerchiefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pag.hr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=17 Grad Pag Kultura]&lt;/ref&gt; The famous lace work of Pag is renowned for its precision and beauty, and is the most prominent part of the costume apart from the large white headdresses worn by the women of the island. Women wear long-sleeved blouses and full pleated skirts (usually gold or red in color) with a red silk scarf tied around their waist. The men wear vests over their shirts with form-fitting trousers with a red silk handkerchief worn around the waist and red hats.

==Bosnia and Herzegovina==
{{Further|Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
[[File:Narodna nošnja iz Tomislavgrada.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Costumes of [[Tomislavgrad]] ]]
Croatian dress from [[Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]] fall under the Dinaric category of dress style, and regional variations between western Herzegovina and central Bosnia is most prominent. In Herzegovina, the style of dress is vastly similar to the inland Dalmatian style.

In central Bosnia however, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] influence is more prominently shown. For women, the dress is mainly white heavy cotton with puckered vertical stripes, while the collar is embroidered with  a crocheted trim and dotted with sequins. The vest is generally dark in color with a golden trim embroidered along the edges, and the apron is made of wool, dyed usually red, black, or dark green with minimal designs. If no apron is worn, than the dress may consist of special embroidery and crocheted lace, and pantaloons (gače) are worn with white, knee-length stockings (''čarape'').&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The sash (''tkanica'') worn around the waist is black with green and gold wool handwoven within. The headscarf can be a kerchief (''krpa'') with various geometric designs and/or floral embroidery, or more elaborate kind (''čember'') with a crocheted edge with a wide band of multi-colored geometric embroidery on one side and half of opposite side.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

For men, white cotton shirts with wide sleeves and black pants with a fringed leg are the basic elements of the costume. The vest is made of thick wool and is dark in color and can be embroidered or crocheted like the females'. The sash around the waist varies in color from region, but is usually dark. Socks are worn to knee length much like the females, and are usually white, red, or gold in color.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Elsewhere==
{{See also|Croats of Serbia|Burgenland Croats|Kosovo Croats|Molise Croats|Croats of Romania|Croats of Boka Kotorska}}

The Croatian dress from [[Serbia]] comes mainly from the [[Vojvodina]] region in the north, with the impact of the Pannonian style figuring very strongly. The most common color for both men and women to wear is white, with elaborate embroidery or stitching at the ends or hems or the sleeves, trousers, or skirts. They would wear blue or black aprons and vests over their garments with gold embroidery. But the most notable Croatian costumes come from the [[Bačka]] region, where for centuries the women have ordered the silk for their costumes from [[Lyon]], [[France]]. They come in a rich blue color that has made them recognizable throughout the region.

The Croats from Kosovo have a dress that has a more Dinaric style, having adapted many of the [[Vardar]]ian style of dress into their traditional costumes. They are called [[Janjevci]], derived from the villages the majority are from. Since most are descended from Dubrovnik traders seven centuries back, they have maintained certain elements of Dubrovnik style clothing that is reflected in their national dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=14787&amp;lang=en | journal = Geoadria | volume = 9 | number = 1 |date=June 2004 | title = Janjevo i Janjevci&amp;nbsp;– od Kosova do Zagreba | authors = Željka Šiljković, Martin Glamuzina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to conflicts plaguing Kosovo over the years, many have migrated to Croatia, where a large cultural community has been set up in [[Zagreb]], preserving the songs, dances, and culture of the Janjevci.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inet.hr/~sebastig/ Mješoviti pjevački zbor "Janjevo"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Croatian girls in folklore costume in Hungary.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Croatian girls in folklore costume in [[Hungary]]]]

Croatian minorities in nearby countries such as [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Italy]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Austria]] continue to have their own traditional dress influenced both by their ancestor's original costume and adaptation of certain local regional styles.

In Hungary, the native Croats often participate in cultural festivities wearing their national costumes, which have been heavily influence by Hungarian style with elaborate colors and rich material.

In Austria, the Croatian Cultural Association helps maintain the culture of the local Croats by sponsoring local kolo, where traditional costumes from [[Nikitsch]] show the German and Austrian [[Alps|Alpine]] influence.

==Literature and theatre==
{{see also|Guyanese literature in the United Kingdom}}

Notable Guyanese authors include [[Wilson Harris]], [[Jan Carew]], [[Denis Williams]], [[Roy A. K. Heath]] and [[E. R. Braithwaite]]. Braithwaite's memoir ''[[To Sir, With Love (novel)|To Sir, With Love]]'' details his experiences as a black high-school teacher in the poor [[East End of London]]. An early Guyanese-born author was [[Edgar Mittelholzer]], who became more well known while living in Trinidad and England. He is well known for his works, which include ''Corentyne Thunder'' and a three-novel set known as the Kaywana Trilogy, the latter focusing on one family through 350 years of Guyana's history. 

Other writers who have made a significant contribution to Guyanese literary culture include [[Fred D'Aguiar]], [[David Dabydeen]], [[Martin Carter]], and [[Jan Carew]].

Although the beginning of theatre in 19th-century [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] was European, in the early 20th century a new African and Indian Guyanese middle-class theatre emerged. In the 1950s there was an explosion of an ethnically diverse and socially committed theatre. Despite an economic depression, there was a struggle to maintain theatre post-1980. Serious repertory theatre was highlighted by [[Carifesta]] and the [[Theatre Guild of Guyana]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank Thomasson, ''A History of Theatre in Guyana 1800–2000''. {{ISBN|1-84523-045-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wordsworth McAndrew]] has been prominent in Guyanese theatre since the 1960s.

Guyanese actors who have been successful internationally include [[Harry Baird (actor)|Harry Baird]], [[Norman Beaton]], [[Anthony Chinn]], [[Tommy Eytle]], [[Cy Grant]], [[Ram John Holder]], [[Pauline Melville]], [[Carmen Munroe]], [[Sol Raye]], and [[Ian Valz]].

==Music and visual arts==
{{main|Music of Guyana}}
Guyana's musical tradition is a mix of African, [[Indigenous peoples in Guyana|Indian]], European, and Latin elements. The most popular type of music is Calypso and its offshoots and mixes, like in other parts of the Eastern Caribbean. The various types of popular music include reggae, [[Calypso music|calypso]], [[Chutney music|chutney]], [[Soca music|Soca]], local Guyanese soca-chutney and Bollywood film songs (or Indian music). Due to globalization, sounds from neighbouring countries can be heard such as [[Merengue music|Merengue]], [[Bachata (music)|Bachata]], [[Salsa music|Salsa]], with [[Reggaeton]] being the most popular.&lt;ref&gt;''From Caroni Gyal To Calcutta Woman: A History Of East Indian Chutney Music In The Caribbean'' by Rajendra Saywack, December 1999, Thomas Hunter College.&lt;/ref&gt; Popular Guyanese performers include Billy (William) Moore, [[Terry Gajraj]], Mark Holder, [[Eddy Grant]], Dave Martins &amp; the Tradewinds, [[Aubrey Cummings]] and Nicky Porter. Among the most successful Guyanese record producers are Rohit Jagessar, [[Eddy Grant]], [[Terry Gajraj]] and Dave Martin.

Visual art takes many forms in Guyana, but its dominant themes are Amerindian, the ethnic diversity of the population and the natural environment. Modern and contemporary visual artists living in, or originally from, Guyana include [[Stanley Greaves]], Ronald Savory, Philip Moore, [[Donald Locke]], [[Frank Bowling]], [[Hew Locke]], [[Roshini Kempadoo]], [[Leila Locke]], [[George Simon (artist and archaeologist)|George Simon]] and [[Aubrey Williams]].

==Film==
The story of cinema in Guyana goes back to the 1920s when the Gaiety, probably British Guiana's first cinema, stood by the [[Brickdam Cathedral|Brickdam Roman Catholic Presbytery]] in Georgetown, and showed [[Charlie Chaplin]]-type silent movies. After the Gaiety burnt down around 1926, other cinemas followed, such as the Metro on Middle Street in Georgetown, which became the Empire; the London on Camp Street, which became the Plaza; and the Astor on Church and Waterloo Streets, which opened around 1940.

The Capitol on La Penitence Street in [[Albouystown]] had a rough reputation. The Metropole was on Robb and Wellington Streets; the Rialto, which became the Rio, on Vlissengen Road; the Hollywood was in Kitty; and the Strand De Luxe on Wellington Street, was considered the luxury showplace.

Cinema seating was distinctly divided. Closest to the screen, with rows of hard wooden benches, was the lowly Pit, where the effort of looking upwards at the screen for several hours gave one a permanent stiff neck. The next section, House, was separated from the Pit by a low partition wall. House usually had individual but connected wooden rows of seats that flipped up or down. Above House was the Box section, with soft, private seats and, behind Box, Balcony, a favourite place for dating couples. These divisions in the cinema roughly represented the different strata existing in colonial society.

Guyanese have produced several feature films over the years. The international award-winner ''[[Guiana 1838]]'', a film by Guyanese-born, US-based writer and director Rohit Jagessar that depicts the arrival of indentured Indian servants to the Caribbean in 1838 following the 1834 abolition of slavery in the British Empire, was released in 2004.

==Architecture==
Guyana's historic architecture reflects the country's British colonial past. Even current houses when made of wood still emulate aspects of the style. Many of the buildings in Georgetown and [[New Amsterdam, Guyana|New Amsterdam]] were built entirely of local wood.

==Sports==
{{See also|Cricket in the West Indies}}
[[File:Providence Stadium outside.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Providence Stadium]] as seen from the East Bank Highway.]]

The major sports in Guyana are [[cricket]] and [[association football|football]]. Guyana plays as part of [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]] team for international cricket. Minor sports include [[beach cricket]], [[netball]], [[rounders]], [[lawn tennis]], [[basketball]], [[table tennis]], [[boxing]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], and a few others.

Guyana hosted international cricket matches as part of the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. The new 15,000-seat [[Providence Stadium]], also referred to as Guyana National Stadium, was built in time for the World Cup and was ready for the beginning of play on March 28. At the first international game of CWC 2007 at the stadium, [[Lasith Malinga]] of the [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lankan team]] performed a "helmet trick" or "double hat-trick" (four wickets in four consecutive deliveries).

==Cuisine==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cook-up Rice.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[Cook-up Rice]]] --&gt;

Guyanese cuisine is similar to the rest of the Anglo Caribbean, especially Trinidad, where the ethnic mix is somewhat similar. The food reflects the ethnic makeup of the country and its colonial history, and includes Ethnic groups of [[Afro-Guyanese|African]], [[Creole peoples|Creole]], [[Indo-Guyanese|East Indian]], Portuguese, Amerindian, [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] and European (mostly British) influences and dishes. The food is diverse and includes dishes such as [[Dal bhat]], curry, [[roti]] and cookup rice (the local variation on the Anglo-Caribbean [[rice and peas#Anglo-Caribbean|rice and peas]]. The one pot meal while not the national dish is one of the most cooked dishes. With its various versions, according to what type of meat, beans and other ingredients available, is a true reflection of the country.

Dishes have been adapted to Guyanese tastes, often by the addition of herbs and spices. Unique preparations&lt;ref&gt;[http://guyanaoutpost.com/recipes/recipes_alpha.shtml Guyanese recipes], Guyana Outpost.&lt;/ref&gt; include [[Guyana Pepperpot]], a stew of Amerindian origin made with meat, ''[[cassareep]]'' (a bitter extract of the cassava), and seasonings. Other favourites are cassava bread, stews, and [[metemgee]], a thick rich type of soup with ground provision, coconut milk and large dumplings (called Duff), eaten with fried fish or chicken. Homemade bread-making, an art in many villages, is a reflection of the British influence that includes pastries such as cheese rolls, pine tarts (pineapple tarts), and patties.

Curry is widely popular in Guyana and most types of meat can be curried: chicken, seafood, goat, lamb, and even duck. Guyanese-style Chow Mein is another dish cooked regularly in many homes.

Caribbean [[ground provisions]] (known colloquially as provisions) are part of the staple diet and include cassava, [[sweet potato]], and [[eddoes]]. There is an abundance of fresh fruits, vegetables and seafood on the coast.

Most individuals use fresh fruits to make their own beverages, which are called "local drink", which are made from readily available fruits or other parts of plants. Popular homemade drinks are Lime Wash (like [[lemonade]]), pine drink (from a pineapple), [[mauby]], made from the bark of a tree; [[sorrel]] drink, made from [[hibiscus]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamaicanteas.com/article-about-sorrell.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[ginger beer]] (made from ginger root), and [[peanut punch]].

Fresh fish and seafood are an integral part of the Guyanese diet especially in the rural areas and small villages along the coast. Popular fish types include gilbaka, butter fish, tilapia, catfish, and hassa ([[Hoplosternum]]). The crab soups with [[okra]] from the [[Berbice]] coastal region resemble the Louisiana Creole soups like [[gumbo]].

Christmas and Old Year's Night (New Year) is the most celebrated time for Guyanese for food and festivities. Advance preparation is part of the exciting pre-preparation for Christmas celebrations. It starts with the preparation and soaking of fruits and rum or wine for [[Black Cake]] weeks or sometimes months ahead to intensify the flavour. Local drinks such as [[ginger beer]], [[mauby]] and [[sorrel]] are fermented and require a sitting (pre-preparation) period prior to making. Ginger beer is the Christmas drink of choice, similar to the popularity of [[eggnog]] in North America. Some dishes certain to be served are [[Guyana pepperpot]], garlic pork, [[black cake]], sponge cake and home-made bread. Some of the local drinks and food require advance preparation.

Guyanese style Chinese food and [[fried chicken]] are the most popular restaurant and take-out items, and are found in the bigger towns.  Popular Chinese dishes include [[lo mein]], chow mein, and "Chicken in the ruff" (fried rice with Chinese-style fried chicken).

==Folklore==
Guyanese folklore is similar to the Caribbean folklores, mixed with African, Indian, Amerindian, and British/European beliefs.

==Language==

English is the main language, and Guyana is the only English-speaking country in South America, though many people in neighbouring Suriname also speak English. British English is taught in school and used in Government and business. Guyanese creole, a pidgin of 17th-century English, African and Hindi words, is used at home and on the street. It is the same as creoles spoken in the Eastern Caribbean such Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and St. Vincent but with different accent or emphasis on how the words are pronounced.

There are also a small number of trace words from the extinct Dutch Creoles, and French. Depending on the race of the person and location, the accent and sprinkling of other words can also change. An example of this would be an Indo Guyanese who would use a word or two words left over from when they spoke Hindi.

As time passes, British terms and phrases for things are being replaced by American ones, due to US influence. Where once people would have said "flats" as in England, the term "apartment" is now being used by some people.

[[File:Tórshavn.old town.4.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional Faroese houses with turf roof in Reyni, [[Tórshavn]]. Most people build larger houses now and with other types of roofs, but the turf roof is still popular in some places.]]
[[File:Johanna.vagur.jpg|thumb|Johanna TG 326 was built in Sussex, England in 1884, but was sold to the village [[Vágur]] in the Faroe Islands in 1894, where it was a fishing vessel until around 1972. The smack was restored in the 1980s and now gives pleasure trips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://johanna.fo/history.htm Johanna.fo, History] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130213085100/http://johanna.fo/history.htm |date=2013-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''culture of the Faroe Islands''' has its roots in the Nordic culture. The [[Faroe Islands]] were long isolated from the main cultural phases and movements that swept across parts of [[Europe]]. This means that they have maintained a great part of their traditional culture. The language spoken is [[Faroese language|Faroese]]. It is one of three [[island|insular]] [[Scandinavian languages]] descended from the [[Old Norse language]] spoken in [[Scandinavia]] in the [[Viking Age]], the others being [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and the extinct [[Norn language|Norn]], which is thought to have been mutually intelligible with Faroese. Until the 15th century, Faroese had a similar [[orthography]] to Icelandic and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 1538, the ruling Danes outlawed its use in schools, churches and official documents. This maintained a rich spoken tradition, but for 300 years the language was not written down. This means that all poems and stories were handed down orally. These works were split into the following divisions: ''sagnir'' (historical), ''ævintyr'' (stories) and ''[[kvæði]]'' (ballads, often set to music and the mediaeval chain dance). These were eventually written down in the 19th century mostly by Danish scholars.

==Music and Chain Dance==
Traditional Faroese music was primarily vocal, and was not accompanied by [[musical instruments]]. Only in Tórshavn instruments like [[fiddle]]s were present in the older days. When trade grew in the 20th century the Faroese started to use imported musical instruments. Much of the imported music and instruments remained popular only in the capital and largest city, [[Tórshavn]]. Rural peoples remained true to traditions of the chain dance and ballads. The Faroese chain dance is a dance, which only survived in the Faroe Islands, while in other European countries it was banned by the church, due to its pagan origin. The dance is danced traditionally in a circle, but when a lot of people take part in the dance they usually let it swing around in various wobbles within the circle. There are no musical instruments used along with the dance, the dancers are singing ballads of various lengths, in either Faroese language or Danish, the latter of which is pronounced in [[Gøtudanskt accent|Gøtudanskt]]. One man or woman leads the song by singing the first few words and then the others follow. The leader is called "skipari" (organizer). A ballad can be very long with a couple of hundred verses, which the skipari is expected to know by heart

The following description is by [[V. U. Hammershaimb]], Færøsk Anthologi, 1891:
''The storyline of the ballad is attended by everybody with great interest, and if something especially pleasant or moving occurs, you can see it in the look and movement of the dancers – when the rage of the battle is described, the hands are clenched together, and when victory is in hand, they make cheering movements''.

Such is the importance of the dance as a cultural element that the Faroese refer to it as Faroese dance. However, it shall be stated that the dance hasn’t the same popularity it once had. This especially applies to younger generations.

==Literature and art==
[[File:Listasavn Føroya.jpg|thumb|[[Listasavn Føroya]] (The National Art Museum of the Faroe Islands is in [[Tórshavn]]).]]
Faroese literature in the traditional sense of the word has only really developed in the past 100–200 years. This is mainly because the Faroese language was not written down in a standardised format until 1890 (in 1854 [[Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb]] published a written standard for Modern Faroese that exists to this day. He produced orthography consistent with a continuous written tradition extending back to [[Old Norse]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Sprog,_religion_og_filosofi/Sprog/Sprogforskeres_biografier/Venceslaus_Ulricus_Hammershaimb DenStoreDanske.dk, V.U. Hammershaimb (''in Danish'')]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Danish language]] was also encouraged at the expense of Faroese. Nevertheless, the Faroes have produced several authors and poets. The most famous of these authors are [[Jørgen-Frantz Jacobsen]] (known for his sole novel ''Barbara'') and [[William Heinesen]]. Both authors wrote in Danish. Other famous authors from the Faroes include [[Heðin Brú]] (''The Old Man and His Sons'') and [[Jóanes Nielsen]]. Poets include the brothers [[Janus Djurhuus|Janus]] and [[Hans Andreas Djurhuus]], and [[Rói Patursson]].
Both Heinesen and Patursson have been awarded [[The Nordic Council's Literature Prize]].

As with literature, painting only really took off in the 20th century in the Faroes. Famous Faroese painters include [[Sámuel Joensen-Mikines]], [[Ingálvur av Reyni]], [[Ruth Smith (artist)|Ruth Smith]], [[Tróndur Patursson]], [[Steffan Danielsen]] and [[Amariel Norðoy]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.fo/en/exhibitions_year_2012.php Art.fo, the Faroese National Art Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923011228/http://art.fo/en/exhibitions_year_2012.php |date=2012-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Handcrafts==
[[File:TB Tvoroyri vs Vikingur Gota - Effodeildin 2012.jpg|thumb|[[TB Tvøroyri]] is the oldest football club of the Faroe Islands, it was founded in 1892. Óli Johannesen (in black/white) holds the record for most capped player of the [[Faroe Islands national football team]]. Here TB plays against [[Víkingur Gøta]].]]
[[File:Fjardastevna 2012 10-mannafor.jpg|thumb|''Kappróður'' is the Faroese word for rowing competition in wooden Faroese rowing boats. There are 7 regattas held around the islands every summer, where boats in different sizes compete. Here is the largest boat type ''10-mannafør''.]]
[[Lace knitting]] is a traditional handcraft of peoples of the [[Faroe Islands]]. The most distinguishing characteristic of Faroese lace [[shawls]] is the center back [[gusset]] shaping.  Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back gusset, an edge treatment, and usually shoulder shaping.

==Sports==
[[File:Pál Joensen a Faroese Silver Medal Winner at The European Swimming Championships 2010.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pál Joensen]] after coming back home to his hometown [[Vágur]] after winning a silver medal at the [[2010 European Aquatics Championships]]]]
Football is the most popular sport on the Faroe Islands, closely followed by [[Team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]].

=== Football ===
60% of those who play sport on the islands play football. A 1-0 victory over [[Austria]] on 12 September 1990 still ranks as the greatest day in the history of football on the islands, but the national team has also recorded a number of impressive results against higher-ranked teams, primarily on home soil.

As of 1 July 2008, the Faroe Islands' international record (in UEFA European Championships qualifiers) was played 48, won 3, drawn 5, lost 40.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/countries/association=51218/fixtureresult.html uefa.com - Football Europe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Five different institutions run football schools, attended by 1,000 children each year. [[Todi Jónsson]] is probably the most famous player from the Faroe Islands of all times. He used to play for [[FC Copenhagen]] in [[Denmark]] and was the top scorer in the 2002/2003 season.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/associations/association=fro/goalprogramme/index.html FIFA.com, Goal Programme - The Faroe Islands Football Association - 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boat race - Kappróður ===
''Kappróður'' is the national sport of the Faroe Islands. There have been rowing competitions a long time back, at least as far back as to the 1930s, and now the competitions are still in a regular routine, held in seven different places during the weekends of June and July. The races are always part of a regional festival, called a [[stevna]], with many other activities as well. The first regatta is always held in Klaksvík on Norðoyastevna in the first Saturday of June, sometimes it can be in the last Saturday of May. The final regatta is always held in Tórshavn on the national day, or actually on the day before the national day, which is called Ólavsøka. The boat race on Ólavsøka is the only race which is not necessarily held on a Saturday, but on the 28 July, whatever the day of the week it is. The regattas in between the Norðoyastevna and Ólavsøka are held in these locations: Jóansøka is every even year held in [[Vágur]] and every odd year in [[Tvøroyri]], both villages are in [[Suðuroy]] (South Island), and this is the only place which is not possible to drive by car from Tórshavn, people have to take the ferry Smyril to Suðuroy, which is a two-hour journey. Jóansøka is held on a Saturday around the 24 June (St. John's Wake). Eystanstevna is always held in Runavík, but the boat race is only held there every second year (even years), odd years the regatta is held in [[Fuglafjørður]] at the Varmakelda Festival (Varmakeldustevna).

=== Swimming ===
[[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]] is a quite popular sport in the Faroe Islands. The Faroese freestyle swimmer [[Pál Joensen]] is the sportsperson of the [[Faroe Islands]] with the best international result for the country, a bronze medal at the [[2012 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m)|2012 FINA World Swimming Championships]]. In July 2011 he qualified for the finals in the men's 800 meters and 1500 meters freestyle at the [[2011 World Aquatics Championships]] in [[Shanghai]]. He placed fourth in the 1500 meter freestyle event, 0,67 second behind the bronze medalist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://omegatiming.com/swimming/racearchives/2011/shanghai2011/C73A1_Results%20(One%20Heat%20-%20Individual)_137_Heat1_Men_1500_Free.pdf Omegatiming.com, Men's 1500m Freestyle, 14th FINA WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS, Shanghai (CHN)]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same competition, he placed fifth in the men's 800 meters freestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://omegatiming.com/swimming/racearchives/2011/shanghai2011/C73A1_Results%20(One%20Heat%20-%20Individual)_117_Heat1_Men_800_Free.pdf |title=Omegatiming.com |access-date=2011-08-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417115216/http://www.omegatiming.com/swimming/racearchives/2011/shanghai2011/C73A1_Results%20(One%20Heat%20-%20Individual)_117_Heat1_Men_800_Free.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Joensen won silver in the 1500 meter freestyle swimming event at the [[2010 European Aquatics Championships|European Aquatics Championship]]. As of 2012, he trained in a 25 meter long pool because there was no 50 meter pool in the Faroe Islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbl.is/vidskipti/frettir/2014/02/13/byggja_fyrstu_50_metra_laugina_i_faereyjum/ mbl.isByggja fyrstu 50 metra laugina í Færeyjum (in Icelandic)]&lt;/ref&gt; The first 50-meter swimming pool is under construction in Pál Joensens hometown Vágur, it is expected to open in 2015. It is named after Pál Joensen: Pálshøll&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudurras.fo/37963 sudurras.fo - Pál vitjaði Pálshøll] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220090333/http://www.sudurras.fo/37963 |date=2014-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joensen competed at the Olympics in London 2012, but he didn't make it to the finals. He competed for Denmark, because the Faroe Islands are not allowed to compete at the Olympics, as they don't accept countries which are not independent. He swam for Denmark in the men's [[Swimming at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's 400 metre freestyle|400m free]], [[Swimming at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's 1500 metre freestyle|1500m free]] and the [[Swimming at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay|4 × 200 meter freestyle relay]]. He was the first Faroese swimmer to compete at the Olympics. Pál Joensen has moved to live and study in Denmark after finishing high school in the Faroe Islands in August 2012. Only one other Faroese athlete has participated in the Olympics, [[Katrin Olsen]] was rowing in a double sculler in 2008, also for Denmark. The Faroe Islands are allowed to compete at the Paralympics under its own flag. Faroese swimmers have represented the Faroe Islands at the Paralympics since 1984. [[Christina Næss]] won the first and only (until now 9 September 2012) gold medal for the Faroe Islands at the [[1988 Summer Paralympics]]. [[Katrin Johansen]], [[Tóra við Keldu]] and [[Heidi Andreasen]] have won silver or bronze medals at the Paralympics. Only one person has competed in another sport than swimming at the Paralympics for the Faroe Islands, which was in table tennis in 1992 when Heini Festirstein competed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/ipc_results/search.php?gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;npc=FRO&amp;games=all&amp;sport=all Paralympic.org, A list with all the Faroese athletes and their medals, if they won any.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831030129/http://www.paralympic.org/ipc_results/search.php?gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;npc=FRO&amp;games=all&amp;sport=all |date=2012-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Island Games ===
The Faroe Islands compete in the biannual [[International Island Games Association|Island Games]], which have been hosted by the islands in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islandgames.net/cms/member_profile_12340.html Islandgames.net, Member profile, Faroe Islands]&lt;/ref&gt; The Faroe Islands won the games in [[2009 Island Games]] with 34 gold medals, 23 silver and 24 bronze.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alandresults2009.com/ Alandresults2009.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[historical linguistics]], a '''daughter language''' or '''son language''', also known as '''offspring language''', is a [[language]] descended from another language through a process of [[Genetic (linguistics)|genetic]] descent. Strictly speaking, the [[metaphor]] of the mother-daughter relationship can lead to misconceptualization of language history, as daughter languages are normally direct continuations of earlier stages, not separate entities in any way "born" to a mother who eventually dies.

'''Decolonizing Architecture Art Residency''' (DAAR) is an architectural studio and a residency program based in [[Beit Sahour]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. DAAR’s work combines spatial interventions, theoretical writings and collective learning. DAAR is dedicated to architectural experimentations on the reuse and transformation of [[colonial architecture]], settlements, [[Military base|military bases]], 1948 cleansed Palestinian villages, primarily in Palestine. DAAR was founded in 2007 in Beit Sahour near [[Bethlehem]] by Alessandro Petti, Sandi Hilal and [[Eyal Weizman]]. The ideas that have been developed and disseminated throughout the region and abroad via exhibitions, seminars, videos and publications.&lt;ref name="sternberg-press.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sternberg Press - Sandi Hilal, Alessandro Petti, Eyal Weizman|url = http://www.sternberg-press.com/?pageId=1480|website = www.sternberg-press.com|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times - Culture Monster (25 January 2011) [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/01/top-redcat-director-leaving-for-post-at-walker-art-center.html ''Top REDCAT curator leaving for post at Walker Art Center in Minneapolis'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCP2010DAi"&gt;Prins Claus Fonds (2010) [http://www.princeclausfund.org/nl/network/user/id/149 profile]&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of local and international architects are allied with the institute. Furthermore, it works together with a large number of artists, film makers and activists.&lt;ref&gt;Decolonizing Architecture institute, [http://www.decolonizing.ps/site/participants/ participants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028045437/http://www.decolonizing.ps/site/participants/ |date=2012-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ozler, Levent (22 November 2010) [http://www.dexigner.com/news/21953 ''Decolonizing Architecture'']&lt;/ref&gt; The architectural studio and art residency was established with the aim of engaging with a complex set of architectural problems centered on one
of the most difficult dilemmas of political practice: how to act both propositionally and critically in an environment in which the political force fields, as complex as they may be, are so dramatically skewed. Are interventions at all possible? How can we find an “autonomy of practice” that is both critical and transformative?

== Prizes ==
In 2010 the institute was honored with a Prince Claus Award, a major cultural development award from the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Prince Claus Fund - Network|url = http://www.princeclausfund.org/en/network/decolonizing.html|website = www.princeclausfund.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury rewards its work "for introducing a non-traditional approach to development in conflict and post-conflict situations, for providing valuable speculation on the future realities of disputed territories, for its critical challenge to outdated urban planning theories based on a more peaceful world, and for highlighting the role of architecture highlighting the role of architecture and visualisation in creating and altering the frontiers of reality."&lt;ref name="PCP2010DAi" /&gt; DAAR was nominated for the Curry Stone Design Price, the Anni and Heinrich Sussmann Artist Award, the New School’s Vera List Center Prize for Art and Politics, the Chrnikov Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Iakov Chernikhovs Architecture Prize 2010 Top Ten Finalists|url = http://www.archdaily.com/92027/iakov-chernikhovs-architecture-prize-2010-top-ten-finalists|website = ArchDaily|accessdate = 2015-11-29|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
DAAR projects have been published and exhibited in various venues including the Venice Biennale, Home Works in Beirut, the Istanbul Biennial, he Bozar in Brussels, NGBK in Berlin, Sharjah Biennale,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sharjah Art Foundation - Decolonizing Architecture Art Residency (DAAR)|url = http://www.sharjahart.org/people/people-by-alphabet/d/daar|website = www.sharjahart.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Architecture Biennale Rveniotterdam, Architekturforum Tirol in Innsbruk, the Tate in London,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Architecture after Revolution {{!}} Tate|url = http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/talks-and-lectures/architecture-after-revolution|website = www.tate.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Oslo Triennial, the Pompidou Centre in Paris.

== Teaching ==
DAAR’s members have taught lectured and published internationally including a term as guest professors at the Berlage Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Return to the Common / 2011–2012 / The Berlage|url = http://www.theberlage.nl/events/details/2012_04_25_return_to_the_common|website = www.theberlage.nl|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bir Zeit University, Bard-Al Quds, Goldsmiths, and other places.

== Book ==
in 2013 DAAR published 'Architecture after Revolution' with the Berlin-based publisher Strenberg Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Critical Proximity|url = http://www.domusweb.it/en/reviews/2014/03/07/critical_proximity.html|website = domusweb.it|accessdate = 2015-11-29|language = it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work presented in this book is an invitation to undertake an urgent architectural and political thought experiment: to rethink today’s struggles for justice and equality not only from the historical perspective of revolution, but also from that of a continued struggle for decolonization; consequently, to rethink the problem of political subjectivity not from the point of view of a Western conception of a liberal citizen but rather from that of the displaced and extraterritorial refugee. You will not find here descriptions of popular uprising, armed resistance, or political negotiations, despite these of course forming an integral and necessary part of any radical political transformation. Instead, the authors present a series of provocative projects that try to imagine “the morning after revolution.”&lt;ref name="sternberg-press.com"/&gt;

'''Doko''' ({{lang-ne|डोको}}) is a kind of [[basket]] made from [[bamboo]]. They are hand-woven in a conical or "V" shape. Dokos are especially used by porters to carry goods in [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]] and northern India's mountainous [[Sikkim]] and [[Uttarakhand]] states.

==Material==
Dokos are made from dry bamboo strips. Bamboo is durable and withstands harsh weather.

==Uses==
[[File:Doko.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Dokos full of [[tomatoes]]]]
Dokos are typically 0.1 to 0.2 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in volume, so an average person can carry 20-50kg. They have shoulder straps, and usually head straps called '''namlo''' ({{lang-ne|नाम्लो}}) that take part of the load off the carrier's shoulders.

They are used to carry goods, vegetables, grains, water pots, etc. Also to carry small animals and poultry, as well as serving as temporary cages.  Where there are no motor roads, special oversize dokos are even used to transport people unable to walk. Doko production has been a good source of income as well.Even blind peoples are trained for doko production to earn their livelihood in Nepal.Almost in every rural areas of Nepal doko is utilized as a common tool for carrying heavy loads.

The fictitious title of '''Duke of Denver''' was created by [[Dorothy Sayers]] for the family of [[Lord Peter Wimsey]]. Lord Peter is the second of the three children of Mortimer Wimsey, 15th [[Duke]] of Denver. Gerald Wimsey, 16th Duke of Denver, and Peter's elder brother, is the chief murder suspect in ''[[Clouds of Witness]]'', in which he is tried by his [[peerage|peer]]s, in full form in the [[House of Lords]].

== Origin of the genealogy ==

[[Wilfrid Scott-Giles|C. W. Scott-Giles]], [[Fitzalan Pursuivant Extraordinary|Fitzalan Pursuivant of Arms Extraordinary]], discussed the family with Miss Sayers from February 1936 until 1940, and they "discovered" many former Wimseys in their correspondence. These came in two types:

* Most Wimseys were like the 16th Duke, and his father: "Bluff, courageous, physically powerful" but not very intelligent; of hearty and voracious appetites of all kinds. They could be "cruel, yet without malice or ingenuity."
* The other type is physically slighter, smarter, with great nervous energy, and "lusts no less powerful, but more dangerously controlled to a long-sighted policy." These became churchmen, statesmen, traitors; but sometimes poets and saints. Obviously, Lord Peter is of this type.

A biographical note, supposedly by his uncle Paul Austin Delagardie, says: 
: "Peter, I am glad to say, takes after his mother and me. True, he is all nerves and nose – but that is better than being all brawn and no brains like his father and brothers [sic], or a mere bundle of emotions, like Gerald's boy, Saint-George. He has at least inherited the Delagardie brains, by way of safeguard to the unfortunate Wimsey temperament."

Miss Sayers published several articles and pamphlets on the Wimseys, including a series of "Wimsey Papers", the wartime letters of the family, which appeared in the ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' from November 1939 to January 1940. After that she turned to her translation of Dante and other religious works. Scott-Giles writes that they met often, but he never ventured to bring up the Wimseys.

After her death, he wrote an article on Wimsey heraldry (''Coat of Arms'', January 1959), and a correspondent discovered a [[Crux (literary)|crux]]. The Wimseys are well-established as being of unbroken succession for sixteen generations (although, as will be seen below, Miss Sayers' genealogy found this too simple) but Gerald Wimsey is described at his trial as "Duke of Denver, in the Peerage of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]]", which would mean that the title was created after the [[Act of Union 1800|Union]] with Ireland, which was passed on 2 July 1800 and came into effect on the following [[Silvester|St. Sylvester's Day]] (New Year's Eve).

Scott-Giles answered this in the manner of a [[The Baker Street Irregulars|Baker Street Irregular]], by assuming that all the data given by Miss Sayers were correct, and coming up with an explanation to save the appearances, and he eventually produced a book on the House of Wimsey. He invented no Wimseys, which explains certain blanks in the list, but he enlarged some from half a sentence.

== Armorial bearings ==

* Arms: [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]], three mice courant [[argent]].
* Crest: A domestic cat, crouched to spring, [[tincture (heraldry)|proper]]
* Supporters: Two [[Saracen]]s armed, proper.
* Motto: "I Hold by my Whimsy" or "As my Whimsy Takes Me"
* Badge: a noose

=== Adoption ===

The arms were altered from 'Sable, three [[roundel (heraldry)|plates]] argent' when a crusading Wimsey advised his King to watch a besieged city as closely as a cat his mousehole. The family chronicles record this as being [[Richard the Lion-Hearted]] at Acre; the arms were actually changed after [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s [[Ninth Crusade|crusade]] while Prince. (Gerald de Wimsey also fought for Prince Edward against [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] at the [[battle of Evesham]] and elsewhere.)

Roger de Wimsey, his father, supported de Montfort; ever since, there has been a Wimsey on each side of civil strife, to preserve the family estates and intercede for their lives.

Gerald's grandfather, Peter de Guimsey, had guided [[John of England|King John]] across [[the Wash]] in 1215, and was very assiduous in searching for the King's treasury after it was swept away. He must have been unsuccessful, for none of it was handed in.

The supporters were adopted under Elizabeth; the badge, now unused, goes back to when Peter, Earl of Denver, left [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]'s camp on the eve of the [[Battle of Bosworth]]. One of King Richard's supporters sent a hangman's rope after him, so that he could get used to the feel; Earl Peter knotted it and sent it back.

XXI&lt;/ref&gt; which would set his dates a century earlier. ). The first baron's younger brother was Ralph de Wimsey, student of [[Roger Bacon]], imprisoned for the heresy of [[calendar reform]].

=== Second creation (1820) ===

* Charles Wimsey, styled 13th Duke of Denver,&lt;ref&gt;Although the Earldom de la Warr is cited as the precedent, a better precedent would be the very real Dukedom of Norfolk, created by Richard III for [[John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk]], co-heir of the Mowbray Dukes of Norfolk, themselves heirs of the Plantagenet earls and Countess of Norfolk. Although the 1st Duke was killed fighting for Richard III at Bosworth (unlike the fictional 1st Duke of Denver), his heirs retained the dukedom. At least two dukes were attainted and the dukedom itself under attainder for a period, but in 1660, the dukedom was restored by Act of Parliament with the same precedence as if it had never been attainted. Otherwise, the Dukes of Norfolk would only have precedence from the 1660 Act of Parliament. The rather less ancestrally distinguished Dukes of Somerset were similarly regranted a 16th-century dukedom, originally created for a maternal uncle of [[Edward VI of England]], only legitimate son of Henry VIII. The 1st Duke was attainted, but his descendants enjoy the precedence from his creation.&lt;/ref&gt; actually 1st Duke of Denver of the 2nd creation ( – ) m. Grace Wimsey.
** George Bredon Wimsey, styled 14th Duke of Denver, actually 2nd Duke of Denver ( – )
* George Bredon Wimsey, styled 14th Duke of Denver, actually 2nd Duke of Denver ( – ) ''m.'' Mary Death.
** Mortimer Gerald Bredon Wimsey, 15th Duke of Denver (1865–1911)
* Mortimer Gerald Bredon Wimsey, styled 15th Duke of Denver, actually 3rd Duke of Denver (1865–1911 ) ''m.'' Honoria Lucasta Delagardie.
** [[Gerald Christian Wimsey, 16th Duke of Denver]], 4th Duke of Denver, but styled 16th Duke of Denver (c. 1888 – ? ) ''m.'' his second cousin Helen Wimsey.
*** Gerald Wimsey, ''styled'' Viscount St. George, only son. ''d. unm. c.'' 1943.
*** Lady Winifred Wimsey, daughter.
** Lord [[Peter Wimsey]], second son (1890 – fl. 1943) ''m.'' Harriet Vane, and had five children, including at least three sons, Bredon Delagardie Peter Wimsey (born October 1936), Roger Wimsey (born 1938) and Paul Wimsey (born 1940). The dukedom eventually devolved upon this line after the death of the 16th Duke.
** Lady Mary Wimsey, daughter, ''m.'' Charles Parker, and had issue one son Peter Charles "Peterkin" Parker, and one daughter, Mary Lucasta Parker. A third child, Harriet Parker, has been added by ''A Presumption in Death'', the continuation of the series by [[Jill Paton Walsh]], where the older children are known by the nicknames "Charlie" and "Polly."

== Abeyance and succession ==

When [[Edward I of England]] summoned his good servant Gerald de Wimsey to [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], the king created a [[barony by writ]]: an hereditary title, and an hereditary right to be summoned to Parliament. It is inherited according to strict customary law: If a Baron Wimsey leaves sons, the eldest succeeds him; if he leaves an only daughter, she succeeds him (compare [[Baron Noel]]). If he dies without descendants, the title goes to the children of the previous Lord Wimsey by the same rules; this usually means his next eldest brother succeeds.

If he leaves no sons, but several daughters, the rules are different: The title is left in [[abeyance]] between the daughters, and no-one succeeds. When all but one of the daughters die without offspring, or the offspring of all but one of them die out, the remaining daughter or her heir ''automatically'' succeed, as if she had been an only daughter all along. (The Crown may, of its grace, choose one of the heirs involved to succeed ''before'' all but one of them die out. It may choose the heir of a younger daughter over the older, and has done so.)

(Cokayne's ''[[Complete Peerage]]'' contains massive evidence that the 13th century did things differently; Edward I summoned many men to Parliament once, without their being summoned, or their sons, ever again. But this did not happen to the Wimseys.)

The other Wimsey titles were granted by letters patent, which specified inheritance by heirs male: no daughters could succeed, and no-one could succeed through descent from a daughter.

== The second creation ==

The 12th Duke of Denver died in 1817 without children, or siblings, and with him the male line from the first Earl of Denver died out. As a result, his higher titles became extinct; and the Barony of Wimsey went into abeyance between his aunts, as daughters of the 10th Duke.

If [[Colonel (British Army)|Colonel]] George Wimsey had not died at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], he would have succeeded, as the only other descendant in the male line of the Earls and Dukes of Denver. (Younger Wimsey sons led adventurous lives; and the practice of having one Wimsey on each side of a civil war kept the property together, but took a high toll in deaths, [[attainder]]s, and executions.) Colonel Wimsey left an only daughter, Grace, who married a Charles Wimsey from another branch of the family; he was descended from the Barons Wimsey, and also from a daughter of the 6th Duke.

Neither of them inherited any titles, but the 12th Duke arranged for them to inherit the ''lands''. In recognition of this, and the multiple family connexion, Charles Wimsey was created, in 1820, Viscount St. George, Earl and Duke of Denver. Although strictly first Duke of the new creation, he is almost always called (as in the case of [[Earl De La Warr|Lord De La Warr]]) 13th Duke of Denver, since the title was recreated promptly in the same family.

=== The 13th Duke ===

Charles Wimsey, 13th Duke of Denver, was the son of [[Sir]] Bredon Wimsey, a [[cadet (genealogy)|cadet]] of the Wimseys, to whom the 12th Duke transferred the Wimsey properties (the [[entail]]s lapsed at his death). Sir Bredon was descended from John Wimsey, Colonel in the Parliamentary armies, during the [[English Civil War]]; who descended in turn from a brother of the first Earl. Matthew Wimsey, Lord Peter's third cousin, the family archivist, would himself descend from a younger son of this Sir Bredon, and thus have no claim on any of the family titles.

Colonel Wimsey was assigned to watch over Duke's Denver and Bredon Hall, in the interests of the [[Commonwealth of England]], while the seventh Duke was in exile as a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] after the [[Battle of Worcester]]. The Colonel did his duty to his government and his family. The Wimsey estates survived the war intact, and Colonel Wimsey's small force did its best to prevent Bredon Hall being used for Royalist intrigue.

The Duke, however, managed to get into the broad Wimsey lands at night, dressed as "Captain Brown", and his efforts helped to persuade the [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]] to support the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. After the Restoration, "Captain Brown" invited Colonel Wimsey to visit Bredon Hall again, and in short order, Colonel John Wimsey married the Duke's sister, Lady Elizabeth Wimsey.

The descent from the Colonel is not specified; but the Wimsey papers tell us that Captain Henry Wimsey, [[Royal Navy|RN]], was a nephew of the 7th Duke, whom his uncle had taken sailing in the yacht which had been used by Captain Brown. He lived to a ripe old age, and his son and grandson were admirals; his [[nautical fiction|sea stories]] may have inspired [[Horatio Nelson]]. He is presumably the younger son of Colonel John and Lady Elizabeth: if the 6th Duke had been his ''paternal'' grandfather, his descendants would have had to be extinct by 1817.

=== His Duchess ===

Lady Grace Wimsey was, as said, the daughter of

* Colonel George Wimsey ( – 1815), "fourth cousin" of the 12th Duke. son of
* Thomas Wimsey, son of
* Christian Wimsey, Major in the French army in 1751, son of
* Mr. Richard Wimsey.

This Richard Wimsey was a "much older first cousin" of the 10th Duke (which implies that ''fourth cousin'' above = "third cousin once removed", as it can), who was also the Duke's next heir after his only son. This makes it likely, but not certain, that he was born about 1685, and his father was the Lord Richard Wimsey who met Evelyn.

=== Gerald Christian Wimsey, 16th Duke of Denver ===
Gerald Christian Wimsey, 16th Duke of Denver, was elder brother of [[Lord Peter Wimsey]]. He appeared most notably as chief murder suspect in the novel ''[[Clouds of Witness]]'', where he is tried in the [[House of Lords]] but eventually acquitted through his brother's efforts.

According to the novel ''[[The Attenbury Emeralds]]'', he died 1951 from a heart attack during a fire at Duke's Denver. As his son, the Viscount St George (a fighter pilot) did not survive the Second World War, his brother Peter inherits the title.

=== Peter Death Bredon Wimsey, 17th Duke of Denver ===
The former [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] accepted the title rather reluctantly. However, out of a sense of duty, he left his former life in London behind, moving to Duke's Denver, rebuilding the estate, and picking up life as a landowner. See also the novel ''[[The Late Scholar]]''.

D.L.S.] ''on Leviathans, and he would have done a great deal more, I dare say, if he hadn't unfortunately been killed by savages on Drake's first voyage into the Indies – I sometimes feel that our young people don't get enough out of life these days.''

Scott-Giles feels this is a bit much, even for an Elizabethan Wimsey, and suggests that the Dowager Duchess had confounded the accomplishments of different Lords Christian.

The '''ensaïmada''' ({{IPA-ca|ənsə.iˈmaðə}}, pl. ''ensaïmades'') is a [[pastry]] product from [[Mallorca]]. It is a common cuisine eaten in most former Castilian territories in [[Latin America]] and the [[Philippines]]. The first written references to the Majorcan ensaïmada date back to the 17th century. At that time, although [[wheat]] flour was mainly used for making [[bread]], there is evidence that this typical pastry product was made for festivals and celebrations.

The ''ensaïmada de Mallorca'' is made with strong [[flour]], [[water]], [[sugar]], [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[mother dough]] and a kind of reduced [[pork]] [[lard]] named ''saïm''. The handmade character of the product makes it difficult to give an exact formula, so scales have been established defining the proportion of each ingredient, giving rise to an excellent quality traditional product. The name comes from the [[Catalan Language|Catalan]] word ''saïm'', which means 'pork lard' (from the [[Arabic]] ''shahim'', meaning 'fat').

In Mallorca and [[Ibiza]] there is a sweet called [[greixonera]] made with ensaïmada pieces left over from the day before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illesbalears.es/ing/balearicislands/cuisine2.jsp?SEC=GAS&amp;id=00000348&amp;lang=0004 Flaó and Greixonera] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919144914/http://www.illesbalears.es/ing/balearicislands/cuisine2.jsp?SEC=GAS&amp;id=00000348&amp;lang=0004 |date=2011-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==

===The Balearic Islands===

Among the variants of ensaimada the most common are:
* ''Llisa'' (literally ''plain'') with no extra ingredient.
* ''[[Cabell d'àngel]]'' (literally ''angel's hair''), the stringy orange strands found inside pumpkins are cooked with sugar to make a sweet filling that is rolled inside the dough.
* ''Tallades'' (literally ''sliced'') covered with [[sobrassada]] and [[pumpkin]], obtaining a bittersweet taste. It is typical of Carnival days, just before [[Lent]], when meat (including lard and sobrassada) are not supposed to be eaten.
* ''Crema'' (literally ''cream'') with cream made with eggs.
* Filled with sweet cream, chocolate or [[turrón]] paste.
* Covered with [[apricot]].


===The Philippines===

The [[Philippines]] also adopted the Majorcan ensaïmada{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} (commonly spelled ''ensaymada'' in [[languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]]). As a Spanish colony for over 300 years, the Philippine variant has evolved over the centuries and is perhaps one of the most common delicacies in the country. The localized pastry is a [[brioche]] baked with butter instead of [[lard]] and topped with grated cheese and sugar. Upscale versions of ensaymada can be topped with [[butter cream]] and sugar. During [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas season]], it is a tradition to top the pastry with a specially aged type of Edam cheese called [[Edam cheese#Popularity|''queso de bola'']]. It is also customary to eat ensaymada with [[hot chocolate]] and [[strawberries]] during Christmas. Due to its extreme popularity as a snack across the islands, popular bakeshop chains such as [[Goldilocks Bakeshop|Goldilocks]], [[Red Ribbon Bakeshop|Red Ribbon]], [[Julie's Bakeshop|Julie's]] and [[Kamuning Bakery Cafe|Kamuning Bakery]] also offer ensaymada with their own recipe.

===Puerto Rico===

In [[Puerto Rico]], another Spanish colony until 1898, the ensaïmada is called ''Mallorca'' and is traditionally eaten for breakfast or as an afternoon snack.

'''Entomological warfare''' ('''EW''') is a type of [[biological warfare]] that uses [[insect]]s to attack the enemy. The concept has existed for centuries and research and development have continued into the modern era. EW has been used in battle by Japan and several other nations have developed and been accused of using an entomological warfare program.

==Description==
Entomological warfare (EW) is a specific type of [[biological warfare]] (BW)&lt;ref name=mont/&gt; that uses [[insect]]s in a direct attack or as vectors to deliver a [[biological agent]], such as [[plague (disease)|plague]] or [[cholera]]. Essentially, EW exists in three varieties.&lt;ref name=lockwood4/&gt; One type of EW involves infecting insects with a [[pathogen]] and then dispersing the insects over target areas.&lt;ref name=sunshine&gt;"[http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf An Introduction to Biological Weapons, Their Prohibition, and the Relationship to Biosafety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512163809/http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf |date=2013-05-12 }}", ''[[The Sunshine Project]]'', April 2002, accessed December 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The insects then act as a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], infecting any person or animal they might bite. Another type of EW is a direct insect attack against crops; the insect may not be infected with any pathogen but instead represents a threat to agriculture.&lt;ref name=sunshine/&gt; The final method of entomological warfare is to use uninfected insects, such as bees, to directly attack the enemy.&lt;ref name=lockwood4&gt;Lockwood, Jeffrey A. ''[[Six-legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War]]'', Oxford University Press, USA, 2008, pp. 9–26, ({{ISBN|0195333055}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
Entomological warfare is not a new concept; historians and writers have studied EW in connection to multiple historic events. A 14th century plague epidemic in Asia Minor that eventually became known as the [[Black Death]] (carried by [[flea]]s) is one such event that has drawn attention from historians as a possible early incident of entomological warfare.&lt;ref name=kirby/&gt; That plague's spread over Europe may have been the result of a biological attack on the [[Crimean]] city of [[Feodosiya#Caffa|Kaffa]].&lt;ref name=kirby&gt;Kirby, Reid. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070611071747/http://www.wood.army.mil/chmdsd/pdfs/Jul-Dec%202005/Kirby.pdf Using the flea as weapon]", ([http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IUN/is_2005_July/ai_n16057441/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 Web version] via ''[[findarticles.com]]''), ''[[Army Chemical Review]]'', July 2005, accessed December 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jeffrey A. Lockwood|Jeffrey Lockwood]], author of ''[[Six-legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War|Six-Legged Soldiers]]'' (a book about EW), the earliest incident of entomological warfare was probably the use of [[bee]]s by early humans.&lt;ref name=laramie&gt;Baumann, Peter. "[http://www.laramieboomerang.com/articles/2008/10/18/news/doc48f977a7251e2862310310.txt Warfare gets the creepy-crawlies]", ''[[Laramie Boomerang]]'', October 18, 2008, accessed December 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The bees or their nests were thrown into caves to force the enemy out and into the open.&lt;ref name=laramie/&gt; Lockwood theorizes that the [[Ark of the Covenant]] may have been deadly when opened because it contained deadly fleas.&lt;ref name=laramie/&gt;&lt;ref name=uw&gt;"[http://www.uwyo.edu/news/showrelease.asp?id=4819 UW Professor Examines Biological Setting of Egyptian Plagues]", ([[Press release]]), ''[[University of Wyoming]]'', December 12, 2005, accessed December 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Civil War]] the Confederacy accused the Union of purposely introducing the [[harlequin bug]] in the South.&lt;ref name=mont/&gt; These accusations were never proven, and modern research has shown it more likely that the insect arrived by other means.&lt;ref name=mont/&gt; The world did not experience large-scale entomological warfare until [[World War II]]; Japanese attacks in China were the only verified instance of BW or EW during the war.&lt;ref name=mont&gt;Peterson, R.K.D. "[http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/insects_as_bioweapons.htm The Role of Insects as a Biological Weapon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705113452/http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/insects_as_bioweapons.htm |date=2008-07-05 }}", Department of Entomology, ''[[Montana State University - Bozeman|Montana State University]]'', notes based on seminar, 1990, accessed December 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; During, and following, the war other nations began their own EW programs.

==World War II==
[[File:Escaravello051eue.jpg|thumb|right|The Colorado potato beetle was considered as an EW weapon by nations on both sides of WWII]]

===France===
[[France]] is known to have pursued entomological warfare programs during World War II.&lt;ref name=lockwoodbost/&gt; Like Germany, the nation suggested that the [[Colorado potato beetle]], aimed at the enemy's food sources, would be an asset during the war.&lt;ref name=lockwoodbost&gt;Lockwood, Jeffrey A. "[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/10/21/bug_bomb/ Bug Bomb]", ''[[Boston Globe]]'', October 21, 2007, accessed December 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1939 biological warfare experts in France suggested that the beetle be used against German crops.&lt;ref name=croddy/&gt;

===Germany===
[[Germany]] is known to have pursued entomological warfare programs during World War II.&lt;ref name=lockwoodbost/&gt; The nation pursued the mass-production, and dispersion, of the [[Colorado potato beetle]] (''Lepinotarsa decemlineata''), aimed at the enemy's food sources.&lt;ref name="lockwoodbost"/&gt; The beetle was first found in Germany in 1914, as an invasive species from North America.&lt;ref name=heather/&gt; There are no records that indicate the beetle was ever employed as a weapon by Germany, or any other nation during the war.&lt;ref name=heather&gt;Heather, Neil W. and Hallman, Guy J. ''Pest Management and Phytosanitary Trade Barriers'' ([Google Books]), CABI, 2008, pp. 17–18, ({{ISBN|1845933435}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the Germans had developed plans to drop the beetles on English crops.&lt;ref name=casper/&gt;

Germany carried out testing of its Colorado potato beetle weaponization program south of [[Frankfurt, Germany|Frankfurt]], where they released 54,000 of the beetles.&lt;ref name=heather/&gt; In 1944, an infestation of Colorado potato beetles was reported in Germany.&lt;ref name=heather/&gt; The source of the infestation is unknown, speculation has offered three alternative theories as to the origin of the infestation. One option is Allied action, an entomological attack, another is that it was the result of the German testing, and still another more likely explanation is that it was merely a natural occurrence.&lt;ref name=heather/&gt;

===North America===
Among the Allied Powers, [[Canada]] led the pioneering effort in vector-borne warfare.&lt;ref name=kirby/&gt; After Japan became intent on developing the plague flea as a weapon, Canada and the United States followed suit.&lt;ref name=kirby/&gt; Cooperating closely with the United States, Dr. G.B. Reed, chief of [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]'s [[Queen's University]]'s Defense Research Laboratory, focused his research efforts on mosquito vectors, biting flies, and plague infected fleas during World War II.&lt;ref name=endicott/&gt; Much of this research was shared with or conducted in concert with the United States.&lt;ref name=endicott/&gt;

Canada's entire bio-weapons program was ahead of the British and the Americans during the war.&lt;ref name=kirby/&gt; The Canadians tended to work in areas their allies ignored; entomological warfare was one of these areas.&lt;ref name=kirby/&gt; As the U.S. and British programs evolved, the Canadians worked closely with both nations. The Canadian BW work would continue well after the war,&lt;ref name=wheelis&gt;Wheelis, Mark, et al. ''Deadly Cultures: Biological Weapons Since 1945'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Usskez9NfEYC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Canada+biological+weapons&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA84,M1 Google Books]), Harvard University Press, 2006, pp. 84-90, ({{ISBN|0674016998}}).&lt;/ref&gt; including entomological research.&lt;ref name=endicott/&gt;

===Japan===
[[Japan]] used entomological warfare on a large scale during World War II in [[China]].&lt;ref name=lockwood/&gt; [[Unit 731]], Japan's infamous biological warfare unit led by Lt. General [[Shirō Ishii]], used plague-infected [[flea]]s and flies covered with cholera to infect the population in China.&lt;ref name=lockwood/&gt; The Japanese military dispersed the insects by spraying them from low-flying airplanes and dropping bombs filled with a mixture of insects and disease.&lt;ref name=lockwoodbost/&gt; Localized and deadly [[epidemics]] resulted and nearly 500,000 Chinese died of disease.&lt;ref name=lockwood&gt;Lockwood, Jeffrey A. "[http://www.the-scientist.com/news/print/55104/ Six-legged soldiers]", ''[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]'', October 24, 2008, accessed December 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=novick&gt;Novick, Lloyd and Marr, John S. ''Public Health Issues Disaster Preparedness'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=AiWKXMn66YcC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%22entomological+warfare&amp;client=firefox-a Google Books]), Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers, 2001, p. 87, ({{ISBN|0763725005}}).&lt;/ref&gt;  An international symposium of historians declared in 2002 that Japanese entomological warfare in China was responsible for the deaths of 440,000.&lt;ref name=lockwoodbost/&gt;

The late Ban Shigeo, a technician at the Japanese Army's 9th Technical Research Institute, left a rare and valuable account of the activities of Noborito Research Institute, which was published in Rikugun Noborito Kenkyujo no shinjitsu – The Truth About the Army Nororito Institute (available only in the Japanese language).  Of the Japanese Army's ten numbered institutes, only the 9th Army Technical Research Institute came under the covert operations section of the Army General Staff's Second Bureau (Intelligence).  On the sensitive issue of Japanese biological warfare, Ban did not shrink from including an account of his trip to Nanking in 1941 to participate in the testing of poisons on Chinese prisoners. One of his book's contributions is to further tie Noborito to the Japanese Army's infamous Unit 731, which participated in biomedical research.  When the war ended, the US Army quietly enlisted certain members of Noborito in its efforts against the communist camp in the early years of the Cold War. The author notes near the end of the book that Ban led the "chemical section" of a US clandestine unit hidden within Yokosuka naval base during the Korean War, and then worked on unspecified projects inside the United States from 1955 to 1959, before returning to Japan to enter the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;CIA review of "Rikugun Noborito Kenkyujo no shinjitsu [The Truth About the Army Noborito Research Institute]" By Ban Shigeo.

In 1989, a British study of Unit 731 strongly supported the theory of United States-Japanese BW culpability in Korea.  Chinese experts insist today that BW weapons created in an American-Japanese collaboration were used in the Korean war.&lt;ref&gt;Factories of Death Japanese biological warfare 1932–45 and the American cover-up by Sheldon H. Harris: https://www.scribd.com/doc/91284707/Factories-of-Death&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
A British scientist, [[J.B.S. Haldane]], suggested that Britain and Germany were both vulnerable to entomological attack via the Colorado potato beetle.&lt;ref name=croddy/&gt; In 1942 the United States shipped 15,000 Colorado potato beetles to Britain for study as a weapon.&lt;ref name=heather/&gt;

==Cold War==

===Soviet Union===

The [[Soviet Union]] researched, developed and tested an entomological warfare program as a major part of an anti-crop and anti-animal BW program. The Soviets developed techniques for using insects to transmit animal pathogens, such as [[foot and mouth disease]]—which they used [[tick]]s to transmit. The nation also used [[avian tick]]s to transmit ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'' to chickens. In addition, the Soviet Union claimed to have developed an automated mass insect breeding facility, capable of outputting millions of parasitic insects per day.&lt;ref name=mipt&gt;Ban, Jonathan.

[[File:Aedes aegypti CDC-Gathany.jpg|thumb|left|The U.S. dropped over 300,000 uninfected [[mosquito]]es on its own population.]]
The [[United States]] seriously researched the potential of entomological warfare during the [[Cold War]]. The [[United States military]] developed plans for an entomological warfare facility, designed to produce 100 million yellow fever-infected mosquitoes per month.&lt;ref name=lockwoodbost/&gt; A [[U.S. Army]] report&lt;ref name=lockwood/&gt; titled "Entomological Warfare Target Analysis" listed vulnerable sites within the Soviet Union that the U.S. could attack using entomological vectors.&lt;ref name=lockwoodbost/&gt; The military also tested the [[mosquito]] biting capacity by dropping uninfected mosquitoes over U.S. cities.&lt;ref name=lockwoodbost/&gt;

[[North Korea]]n and Chinese officials leveled accusations that during the [[Korean War]] the United States engaged in biological warfare, including EW, in North Korea. The claim is dated to the period of the war, and has been thoroughly denied by the U.S.&lt;ref name=regis&gt;[[Ed Regis (author)|Regis, Ed]].

During the 1950s the United States conducted a series of field tests using entomological weapons. [[Operation Big Itch]], in 1954, was designed to test munitions loaded with uninfected fleas (''[[Xenopsylla cheopis]]'').&lt;ref name=croddy&gt;Croddy, Eric and Wirtz, James J. ''Weapons of Mass Destruction: An Encyclopedia of Worldwide Policy, Technology, and History'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzlNgS70OHAC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=%22Operation+Big+Itch%22&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a Google Books]), ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 304, ({{ISBN|1851094903}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Big Itch went awry when some of the fleas escaped into the plane and bit all three members of the air crew.&lt;ref name=croddy/&gt; In May 1955 over 300,000 uninfected mosquitoes (''[[Aedes aegypti]]'') were dropped over parts of the U.S. state of Georgia to determine if the air-dropped mosquitoes could survive to take meals from humans.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; The mosquito tests were known as [[Operation Big Buzz]].&lt;ref name=novick/&gt; [[Operation Magic Sword]] was a 1965 U.S. military operation designed to test the effectiveness of the sea-borne release of insect vectors for biological agents.  The U.S. engaged in at least two other EW testing programs, [[Operation Drop Kick]] and [[Operation May Day]].&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; A 1981 Army report outlined these tests as well as multiple cost-associated issues that occurred with EW.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; The report is partially declassified—some information is blacked out, including everything concerning "Drop Kick"&lt;ref name=rose/&gt;—and included "cost per death" calculations.&lt;ref name=sunshine/&gt; The cost per death, according to the report, for a vector-borne biological agent achieving a 50% mortality rate in an attack on a city was $0.29 in 1976 dollars.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; Such an attack was estimated to result in 625,000 deaths.&lt;ref name=rose&gt;Rose, William H.

At [[Kadena Air Force Base]], an Entomology Branch of the [[United States Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine|U.S. Army Preventive Medicine Activity]], U.S. Army Medical Center was used to grow "medically important" arthropods, including many strains of mosquitoes in a study of disease vector efficiency.&lt;ref name="Stars2" /&gt;  The program reportedly supported a research program studying taxonomic and ecological data surveys for the [[Smithsonian Institution]]."&lt;ref name="Stars2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bugs keep Group Humming at Kadena |author= |url= |newspaper=Pacific Stars and Stripes  |date=August 2, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Smithsonian Institution and [[The National Academy of Sciences]] and [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] administered special research projects in the Pacific.&lt;ref name="Academy" /&gt;  The Far East Section of the Office of the Foreign Secretary administered two such projects which focused "on the flora of Okinawa" and "trapping of airborne insects and arthropods for the study of the natural dispersal of insects and arthropods over the ocean."&lt;ref name="Academy"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Academy of Sciences (U.S.)|title=International Activities of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council, 1964/1965 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KUQrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA59 |accessdate=April 17, 2013 |year=1966 |publisher=National Academies |pages=59– |id=NAP:11015}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|59}} The motivation for civilian research programs of this nature was questioned when it was learned that such international research was in fact funded by and provided to the U.S. Army as requirement related to the U.S. military's biological warfare research.&lt;ref name="India"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=107877&amp;dt=2474&amp;dl=1345 |title=Indian press articles on W.H.O.

The United States has also applied entomological warfare research and tactics in non-combat situations.

==Bioterrorism==
{{Main|Bioterrorism}}
[[Clemson University]]'s Regulatory and Public Service Program listed "diseases vectored by insects" among bioterrorism scenarios considered "most likely".&lt;ref name=rpsp&gt;"[http://drpsp.clemson.edu/Terrorism_Prevention.PDF Regulatory and Public Service Programs’ Strategy for the Prevention Of Bioterrorism in Areas Regulated] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117133829/http://drpsp.clemson.edu/Terrorism_Prevention.PDF |date=2009-01-17 }}", Regulatory and Public Service Program, ''[[Clemson University]]'', 2001, accessed December 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because [[invasive species]] are already a problem worldwide one [[University of Nebraska]] entomologist considered it likely that the source of any sudden appearance of a new agricultural pest would be difficult, if not impossible, to determine.&lt;ref name=uofn&gt;Corley, Heather. "[http://ianrnews.unl.edu/static/0111121.shtml Agricultural Bioterror Threat Requires Vigilance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218075510/http://ianrnews.unl.edu/static/0111121.shtml |date=2012-02-18 }}", ([[Press release]]), Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resource, ''[[University of Nebraska]]'', November 12, 2001, accessed December 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Lockwood considers insects a more effective means of transmitting [[biological agent]]s for acts of bioterrorism than the actual agents.&lt;ref name=lockwood3/&gt; Insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] are easily gathered and their eggs easily transportable without detection.&lt;ref name=lockwood3/&gt; Isolating and delivering biological agents, on the other hand, is extremely challenging and hazardous.&lt;ref name=lockwood3&gt;Lockwood, Jeffrey A.

In one of the few suspected acts of entomological bioterrorism an [[eco-terror]] group known as The Breeders claimed to have released [[Mediterranean fruit flies]] (medflies) amidst an ongoing [[California]] infestation.&lt;ref name=time&gt;Bonfante, Jordan. "[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,969129,00.html Medfly Madness]", ''[[Time Magazine]]'', January 8, 1990, accessed December 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Lockwood asserts that there is some evidence the group played a role in the event.&lt;ref name=casper&gt;Baker, Eric.

==Legal status==
The [[Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention]] (BWC) of 1972 does not specifically mention insect vectors in its text.&lt;ref name=sims/&gt; The language of the treaty, however, does cover vectors.&lt;ref name=sims/&gt; Article I bans "Weapons, equipment or means of delivery designed to use such agents or toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict."&lt;ref name=sims/&gt;&lt;ref name=convtext&gt;"[http://www.opbw.org/convention/documents/btwctext.pdf Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction]", The Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention Website, accessed January 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It would appear, due to the text of the BWC, that insect vectors as an aspect of entomological warfare are covered and outlawed by the Convention.&lt;ref name=zanders&gt;Zanders,  Jean Pascal.

{{Nihongo foot|'''''Final Fantasy Type-0'''''|ファイナルファンタジー零式|Fainaru Fantajī Reishiki|lead=yes|group=Jp.}} is an [[action role-playing game]] developed and published by [[Square Enix]] for the [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP). Released in Japan on October 27, 2011, ''Type-0'' is part of the ''[[Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy|Fabula Nova Crystallis]]'' subseries, a set of games sharing a common mythos which includes ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]''. The gameplay, similar to ''[[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII]]'', has the player taking control of characters in real-time combat during missions across Orience. The player also engages in large-scale strategy-based battles on the world map, and has access to a multiplayer option during story missions and side quests.

The story focuses on Class Zero, a group of fourteen students from the Vermillion Peristylium, a magical academy in the Dominion of Rubrum. When the Militesi Empire launches an assault on the other Crystal States of Orience, seeking to control their respective crystals, Class Zero is mobilized for the defense of Rubrum. Eventually, the group becomes entangled in the secrets behind both the war and the reason for their existence. The setting and presentation were inspired by historical documentaries, and the story itself was written to be darker than other ''Final Fantasy'' titles.

The game was originally announced as a title for mobile phones and the PSP called {{Nihongo foot|''Final Fantasy Agito XIII''.|ファイナルファンタジーアギトXIII|Fainaru Fantajī Agito Sātīn|group=Jp.}} It was directed by [[Hajime Tabata]], who took up the project after completing ''[[Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII]]''. Initially designed to provide players with easy access to the ''Fabula Nova Crystallis'' universe, the mobile version was eventually cancelled and the game's title was changed to distance it from the subseries' flagship title ''Final Fantasy XIII''. Releasing to strong sales, it received praise for its story and gameplay, but was criticized for its camera control and [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]]. Further games related to ''Type-0'' have also been developed, including a [[Final Fantasy Type-0 HD|high definition remaster]] that released internationally in March 2015.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Gameplay==
''Final Fantasy Type-0'' is an [[action role-playing video game]] in which the player controls the 14 members of Class Zero, who are sent on missions across Orience. Outside environments such as the Vermillion Peristylium (Class Zero's home base) and dedicated missions, the game world of Orience is navigated via a scaled-down [[overworld|world map]]. Class Zero are sent on missions across Orience during the course of the game. The player initially travels to preset destinations in the world on an airship supplied by the Peristylium, but gains their own airship to freely navigate the world map with after defeating a powerful enemy guarding it.&lt;ref name="AndraiType02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RPGreview"/&gt; The main gameplay is presented in a mission-based structure.&lt;ref name="1up_type0"/&gt; The two types of missions encountered are story-based missions, and "Practice" missions, which act as side-quests.&lt;ref name="AndriaSummons"/&gt; During missions, optional orders are issued which can be obeyed or ignored as the player chooses. Should they be accepted, the characters receive a temporary power boost, and completing the objectives yields rewards.&lt;ref name="1up_type0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AndriaSummons"/&gt; Players can also engage in real-time strategy battles on the world map, with the player taking control of allied military divisions. Missions involve liberating cities and towns from enemy forces.&lt;ref name="IGN1"/&gt; Timed aerial missions are also available where the characters shoot down attacking dragons using their airship's weapons.&lt;ref name="SilSleep"/&gt;

While outside combat, players can breed [[chocobo]]s, recurring [[galliform]] birds in the ''Final Fantasy'' series. Players must capture two chocobos on the world map and take them to a special ranch within the Peristylium: by pairing certain chocobos and adding specific items, a special chocobo can be bred for use. Players can visit the Peristylium Crystarium to review defeated enemies, character information, in-game lore and special video clips.&lt;ref name="AndraiType02"/&gt; [[Character design of Final Fantasy#Moogle|Moogles]], another recurring creature in the series, hand out missions to the player: the objectives of missions can change during gameplay. Items and new equipment can be bought from shops managed by [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) both within the Peristylium and across Orience. Towns liberated during missions give access to a wider range of shops.&lt;ref name="IGN1"/&gt; After completing the game once, players unlock a "[[New Game+]]" option: in this mode, players keep their stats and weapons from the previous playthrough, while also unlocking story scenes and character-specific missions.&lt;ref name="AndriaType0story"/&gt; ''Type-0'' features three difficulty levels; "normal", "hard", and "impossible".&lt;ref name="SilDifficulty"/&gt;

===Battle system===
[[File:FF Type-0 PSP gameplay.jpg|left|thumb|Screenshot of combat in ''Final Fantasy Type-0'', showing characters Ace, Machina and Rem in combat with one of the game's common enemies.]]
''Type-0'' uses a [[Real-time game|real-time]], [[Action role-playing game|action-based]] battle system similar to the system used in ''[[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII]]''. The player is allowed access to three characters, which they can swap between at any time. The two not being controlled are managed by the game's [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref name="1up_type0"/&gt; Each character has a specific weapon, and special attacks unique to a character are unlocked as they gain [[experience level]]s.&lt;ref name="SilSleep"/&gt; During combat, characters lock onto targets while attacking and can switch targets.&lt;ref name="1up_type0"/&gt; Characters are able to perform precisely timed attacks during the period when an enemy unit is attacking: the "Break Sight", which deals high damage, and the "Kill Sight", which kills a standard enemy with a single hit.&lt;ref name="IGN2"/&gt; Three characters can also be commanded to use a {{Nihongo foot|Triad Maneuver,|三位一体|Sanmi Ittai|"Trinity Attack"|group=Jp.}} combining their attacks to deal higher damage to a target.&lt;ref name="Type0trinity"/&gt; Aside from human enemies, the game features multiple recurring ''Final Fantasy'' monsters.&lt;ref name="AndraiType02"/&gt; In addition to enemies encountered in missions, there are special enemies that can be encountered while exploring the world map.&lt;ref name="AndriaSummons"/&gt;

Defeated enemy units drop a substance called Phantoma. The color of Phantoma indicates what aspect of the character it will replenish, though in general they automatically replenish a set amount of [[Magic (gaming)|magic points]]. Phantoma are used in the game's leveling system, the Altocrystarium, to strengthen a character's magic skills.&lt;ref name="AndriaGameplay"/&gt; The game's magic skills are divided into five basic groups named after types of guns: for example, "Rifle" fires the spell in a straight line, while "Missile" homes in on and chases targeted enemies.&lt;ref name="AndriaSummons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Type0guns"/&gt; Holding down the assigned action button increases the power of the attack.&lt;ref name="Type0summontypes"/&gt; Many combat situations involve timed challenges. Success rewards the character, while failure drains their health. If a character is defeated in battle, the player can instantly select another to replace it, and the defeated character must be revived outside the mission.&lt;ref name="IGN2"/&gt; The game features an arena where practice fights take place. While these fights are not against real foes, the characters continue to [[experience point|level up]] and gain Phantoma after the battle, and twenty battles can be arranged at any one time.&lt;ref name="SilSleep"/&gt; Each character has access to [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Magic|summoned monsters]] called {{Nihongo foot|Eidolons,|軍神|Gunshin|"War Gods"|group=Jp.}} which act as temporary playable characters and have their own set of skills. Summoning them empties the selected character's health gauge, removing them from battle until they are revived. Summons are also affected by the current environment: as an example, Shiva's powers are stronger in snowy weather. After a limited time in battle, the Eidolons are dismissed. Those available to players are series staples Shiva, Ifrit, Golem, Odin, Diablos and Bahamut.&lt;ref name="AndriaSummons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SilDiablos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AndriaMultiplayer"/&gt; Each Eidolon has variants of its original form, many of which are unlocked as the game progresses.&lt;ref name="Type0summontypes"/&gt;

Characters can continue to level up through activities within the Peristylium while the PSP is in sleep mode, the game's [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] is running, and the PSP is charging. The multiplayer function, activated through the game's configuration screen, allows two other players to jump into another host player's game via an online connection. The allotted time for multiplayer is limited to a few minutes, with transitions between zones triggering the end of a multiplayer section. The time limit can be extended by players helping their current host. The first and last segments of the game are not open to multiplayer.&lt;ref name="AndriaType0story"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SilSleep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AndriaMultiplayer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AndraiType01"/&gt; There is also a function called Magical Academy Assist, in which NPCs named after members of the game's production team are summoned into battle to assist the cadets.&lt;ref name="Type0assist"/&gt;

''Note: The plot of Type-0 is the same in its original version and the high-definition remaster [[Final Fantasy Type-0 HD]], so the terms and quotes used in the text are from the localization of the high-definition remaster rather than unofficial translations.''

===Setting===
''Final Fantasy Type-0'' is set within Orience, a land divided between four nations or "Crystal States". Each nation has crystals of power based on the [[Four Symbols (China)|Four Symbols]], which are in turn their national emblems. The Dominion of Rubrum uses the [[Vermilion Bird|Vermillion Bird]] Crystal, which controls magic; the Milites Empire controls the [[White Tiger (China)|White Tiger]] Crystal, containing the power of science and weapons; the Kingdom of Concordia uses the [[Azure Dragon]] Crystal, containing the power of Dragons; and the Lorican Alliance is home to the [[Black Tortoise]] Crystal, containing the power of shielding. Each nation has an academy, or Peristylium, to research and protect the country's respective crystal.&lt;ref name="OrienceDetails"/&gt; The crystals have the ability to mark humans as their countries' servants. These servants, called l'Cie, are branded with a symbol and are given a "Focus", a task to complete. While blessed with long life and the ability to transform into crystal, l'Cie are cursed to lose their memories over time.&lt;ref name="AndriaType02"/&gt; The people of Orience also lose their memories of the dead so they will not be held back by any past regrets and continue strengthening their souls through conflict, a mechanism put in place by the crystals for the convenience of the deities who crafted them.&lt;ref name="AndriaType0story"/&gt;&lt;ref name="T0art"/&gt; The main aim of many characters is to become Agito, a legendary figure who will appear and save the world from Tempus Finis, an apocalyptic event that will destroy Orience.&lt;ref name="QUOTEagito"/&gt;

Supporting Class Zero are their mentor [[Characters of Final Fantasy Type-0 and Agito#Kurasame Susaya|Kurasame Susaya]], and [[Characters of Final Fantasy Type-0 and Agito#Arecia Al-Rashia|Arecia Al-Rashia]], Class Zero's former mentor and the overseer for magical development at the Vermillion Peristylium. Other important characters from Rubrum are [[Characters of Final Fantasy Type-0 and Agito#Dominion of Rubrum|Khalia Chival VI]], the current leader of Rubrum and headmaster of the Vermillion Peristyrium, and the l'Cie [[Characters of Final Fantasy Type-0 and Agito#Dominion of Rubrum|Caetuna]]. Multiple Militesi figures, led by Marshal [[Characters of Final Fantasy Type-0 and Agito#Cid Aulstyne|Cid Aulstyne]], act as the game's main antagonists. Other important characters include the Concordian queen [[Characters of Final Fantasy Type-0 and Agito#Kingdom of Concordia|Andoria]], [[Characters of Final Fantasy Type-0 and Agito#Gala|Gala]], leader of the Rursus Army and the instigator of Tempus Finis, and [[Characters of Final Fantasy Type-0 and Agito#Joker|Joker]] and [[Characters of Final Fantasy Type-0 and Agito#Tiz|Tiz]], two mysterious figures who observe the events of the game.

===Plot===
Marshal Cid Aulstyne leads the army of Milites against the other nations of Orience, launching a devastating attack against the Vermillion Peristylium and neutralising the Vermillion Bird Crystal using a crystal jammer. Class Zero, immune to the effects of the jammer, repel the invasion.&lt;ref name="QUOTErecapture"/&gt; During the conflict Izana Kunagiri, Machina's older brother, is killed while on a mission for Class Zero. This event later creates a rift between Machina and Class Zero. Coordinated by Kurasame and Arecia Al-Rashia, Class Zero plays a key role in freeing Rubrum's territories and launching counterattacks in alliance with Concordia, while Lorica's capital is destroyed by a Militesi bomb. Andoria, Concordia's queen, then forces a ceasefire between the remaining nations.&lt;ref name="QUOTEceasefire"/&gt; During peace talks in the Militesi capital, Class Zero is framed for Andoria's murder, resulting in Concordia's puppet government and Milites launching a united assault on Rubrum.&lt;ref name="QUOTEframed"/&gt; During their flight, Machina storms off after clashing with Class Zero, and becomes a White Tiger l'Cie to protect Rem from his brother's fate before returning to them. The White Tiger Crystal's will eventually forces him to leave.&lt;ref name="QUOTEmachinal'cie"/&gt;

With help from its l'Cie soldiers and Class Zero, Rubrum destroys the forces of Concordia and Milites, uniting Orience under its flag.&lt;ref name="QUOTEfronts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="QUOTEsummon"/&gt; This triggers the arrival of Tempus Finis, with the Rursus Army emerging from the magical fortress Pandaemonium to wipe out Orience's population.&lt;ref name="QUOTEfinis"/&gt; Cid and Class Zero each travel to Pandaemonium: Cid attempts to become Agito and is transformed into the Rursus Arbiter by Gala, while Class Zero resolve to halt Tempus Finis. As Class Zero face the trials of the Arbiter, the Vermillion Bird Crystal offers them the chance to become l'Cie. During the original playthrough, if Class Zero accepts the offer, they go into battle against the Rursus and die, dooming Orience to be destroyed in Tempus Finis and reborn in another spiral of history. &lt;ref name="QUOTEspiral" /&gt;

Class Zero refuse the Crystal's offer and Rem is made a l'Cie in their place. Machina and Rem end up fighting each other in Pandaemonium: Rem is mortally wounded, and she and Machina turn to crystal. Severely weakened by the trials and demoralized at seeing Machina and Rem's condition, Class Zero are initially unable to defeat the Arbiter. Machina and Rem's spirits give them the strength they need to defeat the Arbiter and halt Tempus Finis. Fatally injured, Class Zero spend their final minutes imagining their possible post-war lives.&lt;ref name="QUOTEend1"/&gt; They are found by Machina and Rem, who have returned to human form and, along with the rest of Orience, are allowed to remember the dead. In a post-credits sequence, it is said that the Crystal States fall into turmoil as the Crystals lose their powers. Machina and Rem unite Orience and rebuild the world, and Machina records Class Zero's history before dying with Rem at his side.&lt;ref name="T0art"/&gt;&lt;ref name="QUOTEend2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FFType0_U"/&gt; 

A second playthrough reveals that Orience is trapped in a stable timeloop created by Arecia and Gala, the respective servants of the deities [[Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy#Common elements|Pulse and Lindzei]], as part of an experiment to find the gateway to the Unseen Realm.&lt;ref name="FFType0_U"/&gt; Competing with each other to open the gateway using a different method, both failed and reset the world for another attempt. By the events of ''Type-0'', the experiment had been performed over six hundred million times.&lt;ref name="QUOTEmillion"/&gt; Cid, aware of the cycle, wanted to free Orience from the Crystals' control, and killed himself in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent Gala from using him. In a sequence unlocked during the second playthrough, Joker and Tiz speak with Arecia after the Arbiter's defeat and show her the memories of Class Zero and the people of Orience to make her reconsider restarting the experiment.&lt;ref name="QUOTEmemory1" /&gt; After speaking with Machina and Rem, Arecia decides to abandon the experiment and returns the two to human form.&lt;ref name="QUOTEmemory2" /&gt; In an alternate ending, Arecia chooses to remove the crystals from Orience's history, creating a new timeline where the war never occurred and the world's population can live happily.&lt;ref name="QUOTEspecial"/&gt;

==Development==
''Final Fantasy Type-0'' was originally titled ''Final Fantasy Agito XIII'', envisioned as a game for mobile devices. It was conceived in 2005 as part of ''[[Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy]]'', a subseries of ''Final Fantasy'' games linked by a common mythos. ''Agito XIII'' was the final original ''Fabula Nova Crystallis'' game to be created. The decision to make it a mobile game was based on the popularity of ''[[Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII]]''. [[Hajime Tabata]], who contributed to the ''Fabula Nova Crystallis'' mythos, was searching for a new project after finishing ''Before Crisis'' and became the game's director.&lt;ref name="e32006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FNCinception"/&gt; ''Before Crisis'' producer Kosei Ito acted as producer before his move to [[Capcom]] prior to 2009.&lt;ref name="AgitoXIIIdetails"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ItoCapcom"/&gt; Beginning development in 2006, it was first announced at that year's [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3). It was said to offer on-the-go access to the ''Fabula Nova Crystallis'' universe, using gameplay functions exclusive to mobile phones of the time.&lt;ref name="AgitoXIIIdetails"/&gt;&lt;ref name="T0concept"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FabulaUnveiled"/&gt; The concept was to deliver a game for mobile platforms equivalent to a console game from the main ''Final Fantasy'' series, and to make it available in its entirety upon release rather than in episodic format.&lt;ref name="fan"/&gt;

Developers had been planning a release on the next generation of mobile phones, as those available at the time could not offer all the capabilities they would need.&lt;ref name="fan"/&gt; While it was originally claimed to be a mobile exclusive, versions for both mobiles and the [[PlayStation Portable]] were being developed, with the latter to be revealed when the former was sufficiently advanced.&lt;ref name="AgitoXIIIpsp"/&gt; The original staff members were Tabata, [[Yusuke Naora]] and [[Tetsuya Nomura]]. Nomura acted as a character designer and creative producer.&lt;ref name="AndriaType0story"/&gt; Between 2006 and 2008, development wavered between inactivity and sluggishness since most of the team was devoted to ''[[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII]]''. In 2008, it was said to be facing serious problems due to the scale of the project.&lt;ref name="AndriaStaff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="T0update"/&gt; An issue developers had grappled with was whether or not to make the command buttons used in the game visible on the mobile screen.&lt;ref name="Notes"/&gt; ''Agito XIII'' was described as an online RPG using fully rendered 3D graphics similar to console games, as well as having gameplay elements from multiple genres such as [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]]s, smaller-scale multiplayer-focused games, and standard role-playing games.&lt;ref name="T0update"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="T0online"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FamDevMobile"/&gt; Other unfinished concepts being developed were a day-night cycle, a calendar system linked to real-world time and dates, and a story influenced by player votes.&lt;ref name="T0art"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HajimeSilInterview"/&gt;

In 2008, it was decided to make ''Type-0'' a PSP exclusive, cancelling the mobile version of the game as the developers did not want to wait for mobile technology to reach a level which could handle their full vision for the game. Full development began that year by the same team who developed ''Crisis Core'', but was again slowed as most of them were completing work on ''[[The 3rd Birthday]]''.&lt;ref name="AndriaType0story"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Type-0Update"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PSP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FamAgitoMobiles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Type0Wired"/&gt; Because of these conflicting projects, ''Type-0'' came close to being cancelled outright.&lt;ref name="Type0cancel"/&gt; Between 2009 and 2011, the title was changed to distance it from ''Final Fantasy XIII'', since after the platform change the two games had little in common other than their shared mythos. One of the titles considered and rejected was ''Final Fantasy Live'', referring to the game's multiplayer element. The new title, ''Final Fantasy Type-0,'' was intended to indicate the game's separation from the main series. It was also the beginning of an alternative numbering system parallel to the main series.&lt;ref name="FFType0_Uname"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AgitoChange"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Type0meaning"/&gt; The game made its first official public appearance under the new title at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in Tokyo, along with a new trailer that was released to the public on January 27, 2011.&lt;ref name="JanAnnouncement"/&gt;

===Scenario and design===
[[File:FF Type-0 key art.jpg|thumb|right|Artwork representing the themes and atmosphere of ''Type-0''. The artwork was created by the game's art director [[Yusuke Naora]], who drew on personal experience and the game's themes of war and death.&lt;ref name="NaoraLecture"/&gt;]]
''Type-0''{{'}}s scenario was conceived by Tabata and written by Hiroki Chiba and Sarah Okabe.&lt;ref name="Type0writer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Type0writer2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="T0update"/&gt; While the game was still titled ''Agito XIII'', Tabata described it as "a major title [...] formed from a variety of concepts" which included the collision of four fantasies (the game's view of Orience), a battle between magic and weapons, and the two sides of reality.&lt;ref name="T0themes"/&gt; The early story concept drew heavily from popular [[manga]] and [[anime]], but little survived after the platform change. Tabata instead chose a new style similar to historical films and documentaries.&lt;ref name="T0art"/&gt; The new story's concept started with the idea of a war story told by young people caught up in the event, with its story themes revolving around death and its impact on others.&lt;ref name="AndriaType0story"/&gt; A major inspiration was the Japanese documentary series ''Centuries of Picture''. The final story was darker than many other ''Final Fantasy'' games.&lt;ref name="T0art"/&gt; Despite its title change, the game was kept within the ''Fabula Nova Crystallis'' mythos.&lt;ref name="JanAnnouncement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dengeki"/&gt; The approach taken with the mythos was to portray the roles of its deities from a historical standpoint, while telling a story focused on the human side of events.&lt;ref name="AndriaType0story"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Type-0Update"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AndriaType0update"/&gt; The cyclic nature of the game's universe was created to help incorporate aspects of the mythos.&lt;ref name="Type0mythos"/&gt; The roles and backgrounds for each character in the game were conceived and put into place after the setting and main story had been finalized.&lt;ref name="SilNaora"/&gt; After the game's release, Tabata commented that when he was writing the story he would have liked to have been more thorough, and to have made the story easier for players to understand.&lt;ref name="GamespotTabata"/&gt;

The game's logo artwork was drawn by regular series artist [[Yoshitaka Amano]].&lt;ref name="Type0themesong"/&gt; The kanji symbol used in the logo was drawn by Naora, who had designed the Shinra logo in ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' and its [[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII|companion media]]. Naora specifically requested that he draw the logo due to this previous experience.&lt;ref name="AndriaType0update"/&gt; To achieve the grittier atmosphere, Naora took a research trip to a Japanese military camp to learn what being a military cadet was like. The island of the Vermillion Perystilium was based on an offshore Japanese island he had visited prior to his involvement with the game, adding elements in-game such as an offshore ship wreck to symbolize his fear of the sea. He was also influenced by an incident where he saw a dead cat surrounded by other cats to portray the bond between members of Class Zero, and the game's themes, in promotional artwork.&lt;ref name="NaoraLecture"/&gt;

The gameplay was inspired by the multi-character system of ''Before Crisis'', while the naming of magic styles after weapons of war made reference to first-person shooters.&lt;ref name="Type0guns"/&gt; The combat was designed to be filled with tension and portray each playable character's personality on the battlefield.&lt;ref name="GamespotTabata"/&gt; The Eidolons were originally not controlled in realtime, but during the development of Ifrit, Tabata did some testing with real-time commands. The results impressed him enough that he decided to overcome the technical difficulties involved and make the Eidolons controllable.&lt;ref name="T0JPinterview"/&gt; Due to technical restrictions and the presence of the Academy Assist function, the game's [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] for playable characters needed to be limited to healing, survival and other minor actions.&lt;ref name="TabataReddit"/&gt; The game's multiplayer was deliberately designed around restricted segments. Its development was still ongoing during the summer of 2011, with a [[2011 PlayStation Network outage|temporary stoppage]] of [[PlayStation Network]] that year negatively affecting its development.&lt;ref name="AndriaMultiplayer"/&gt; Because of the size of the project, debugging the game took far longer than anticipated. Between the release of the demo and the full game, adjustments were made to gameplay mechanics and the in-game camera.&lt;ref name="AndriaType0story"/&gt; In a post-release interview, Tabata commented that he would have liked to expand the multiplayer functions to include an ad-hoc function and expanded cooperative gameplay, and create a more forgiving learning curve for players.&lt;ref name="GamespotTabata"/&gt;

The music for ''Type-0'' was composed by [[Takeharu Ishimoto]]. He had previously composed the music for ''Before Crisis'', ''Crisis Core'' and ''[[The World Ends with You]]''. Ishimoto gave the music a dark and heavy feel, describing the themes as "war, life, and death". He used less [[Rock music|rock]] elements than in his previous games to promote a feeling of immersion. One of his primary instruments was the [[guitar]], which Ishimoto played himself during recording sessions.&lt;ref name="Type0music"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IshimotoInterview"/&gt; Although the title was for the PSP, the team did not want to hold back despite hardware limitations, recording a quantity of tracks unusual for a spin-off ''Final Fantasy'' title. Wherever possible, the recording was done live.&lt;ref name="IshimotoInterview"/&gt; The orchestral and choral elements were performed by the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]] and the Cantillation chamber choir, and the recording and mixing of these tracks was done at the [[Sydney Opera House]]. Recording for other tracks was done at Ishimoto's studio in Japan.&lt;ref name="IshimotoInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IshimotoT0HD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OSTliners"/&gt; After recording, Ishimoto combined the orchestral and choral elements, and rearranged the main leitmotifs to create more variety in the score.&lt;ref name="Type0music"/&gt; Arrangements for the orchestral tunes were done by [[Kentaro Sato (composer)|Kentaro Sato]], while arrangements for other tracks were done by Rieko Mikoshiba.&lt;ref name="OSTliners"/&gt;

The game's theme song, "[[Zero (Bump of Chicken song)|Zero]]", was composed and performed by Japanese rock band [[Bump of Chicken]].&lt;ref name="Type0themesong"/&gt; The band, which was a big fan of the ''Final Fantasy'' series, was contacted by Square Enix to compose and perform the song and agreed readily. It was brought in after the platform move onto the PSP, but while the game was still titled ''Agito XIII''. While looking for inspiration, the band was able to see in-development screenshots of the game, samples of the script, and character illustrations.&lt;ref name="BoCfamitsu"/&gt; The band was mostly given a free hand while composing the song. Its one guideline was provided by Tabata, who suggested the theme song for ''Centuries of Picture'', "Is Paris Burning?" by Takeshi Kako, as a source of inspiration. Multiple versions of "Zero" were composed for use in different areas of the game.&lt;ref name="T0art"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BoCfamitsu"/&gt; At the request of band leader Motoo Fujiwara, Amano's logo artwork was used for the cover of the single's limited edition.&lt;ref name="BoCfamitsu"/&gt;

''Final Fantasy Type-0 Original Soundtrack'' was released on October 26, 2011. The soundtrack was released in a standard edition, as well as a limited edition that could be purchased both separately and with the collector's edition of the game.&lt;ref name="SQEXlimited"/&gt; A promotional album featuring five tracks was sold by Square Enix at their booth at the [[Odaiba|Odaiba Expo 2011]].&lt;ref name="Type0promoOST"/&gt; The album stayed on the [[Oricon]] charts for seven weeks, reaching a high of #25.&lt;ref name="ORICON1"/&gt; The soundtrack has received positive reviews in the west from dedicated music outlets ''Original Sound Version'' and ''Game-OST'', with the sites giving both individual tracks and the work in general high praise.&lt;ref name="GOSTreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OSVreview"/&gt; "Zero" was released on October 19, 2011. It was released as a single instead of being part of the main soundtrack, receiving both a limited and standard edition.&lt;ref name="BoCfamitsu"/&gt; The single remained in the Oricon charts for thirty-two weeks, peaking at #2.&lt;ref name="ORICON2"/&gt;

==Release==
''Type-0'' was released on October 27, 2011, receiving both physical and digital releases.&lt;ref name="T0delay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TypeReleases"/&gt; It was initially announced for release in summer of that year, but unspecified difficulties with development including the stoppage of PlayStation Network caused a delay.&lt;ref name="AndriaMultiplayer"/&gt; It was then announced for released on October 13, but was delayed by two weeks. While Square Enix stated it wanted to improve its quality, no other information was given. It was speculated to be due to complaints surrounding the camera control and other gameplay elements. The releases of the soundtrack and the theme song were also delayed.&lt;ref name="T0delay"/&gt; ''Type-0'' was one of a few releases for the PSP to be released on two UMDs, as Tabata wanted to cut as little content as possible, which would have been impossible if they had settled for using one UMD.&lt;ref name="AndraiType01"/&gt; A demo for the original game was released in August 2011, featuring seven playable characters and four missions at locked difficulty levels.&lt;ref name="SilDifficulty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DemoRelease"/&gt; Save data could be transferred to the full game, unlocking special costumes and items and keeping experience points.&lt;ref name="T0demo"/&gt; A second demo was released on November 22, a month after the full game's release. It replaced the original demo and gave players access to exclusive items and costumes.&lt;ref name="Type0secondDemo"/&gt; A collector's edition was released exclusively through Square Enix's online store, containing artwork, a limited edition version of the soundtrack, postcards and a booklet of character introductions.&lt;ref name="GemCollector"/&gt; The title was later added to their Ultimate Hits budget title collection.&lt;ref name="UltimateHits"/&gt;

''Type-0'' has never received an official localization in its original form.&lt;ref name="Type-0Update"/&gt; During development, while it was still titled ''Agito XIII'', Tabata said he was trying to make the game appealing to North American players.&lt;ref name="T0appeal"/&gt; Despite a localization being confirmed as in development in an official guidebook interview, the original version of ''Type-0'' was not released in the west.&lt;ref name="T0Olocal"/&gt; In the wake of the game's release in Japan, [[1UP.com]] and [[Joystiq]] speculated that the game could be successfully brought west as a port to the [[PlayStation Vita]].&lt;ref name="T0vita1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="T0vita2"/&gt; Tabata later commented that the main reasons for the game not being localized were the flagging Western PSP market and uncertainties surrounding the Vita's commercial success.&lt;ref name="Type-0Update"/&gt;

An unofficial [[Fan translation of video games|fan translation]] [[Patch (computing)|patch]] was announced in mid-2012. Work on the fan translation took place over the following two years, during which time Square Enix was noncommittal concerning an official Western release.&lt;ref name="KotakuFanTranslation"/&gt; The patch was initially announced for an August 2014 release, but was instead was released on June 9, 2014. According to the translation team leader, the patch was downloaded 100,000 times in the first four days.&lt;ref name="KotakuFanTranslation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Type0fan"/&gt; It was taken down in July of the same year after Square Enix allegedly threatened unspecified legal action, originally thought to be a [[cease and desist|cease-and-desist]] order.&lt;ref name="CeaseDesist"/&gt; Later statements revealed that the patch was released earlier than originally announced due to the lead translator on the project wanting fans to see their achievements, which ended up causing a rift between him and the rest of the team. Before the release, Square Enix and the translation team had been in friendly communication concerning the translation. The formal requests to take the patch down were made in the weeks following its release, shortly before the announcement of ''Type-0 HD''.&lt;ref name="KotakuFanTranslation"/&gt; Work on the patch was eventually resumed and a second version, which included unofficial compatibility with the [[PlayStation 3]] system and further translation bugfixes, was eventually released in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skybladecloud.net/we-have-arrived/|title=We have arrived! *UPDATE*|date=2014-06-08|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merchandise===
Multiple pieces of merchandise were created for the game. An ''[[List of Square Enix companion books|Ultimania]]'', part of a series of dedicated guidebooks, was released in the same month as the original game. It contained story and character breakdowns, concept art, and interviews with developers.&lt;ref name="SEgameguide"/&gt; A different book, {{Nihongo foot|''Final Fantasy Type-0 World Preview'',|ファイナルファンタジー零式　ワールドプレビュー|Fainaru Fantajī Reishiki Wārudo Purebyū|group=Jp.}} was also released in October. It featured character biographies, details on the world of Orience, and interviews with the voice actors for Class Zero.&lt;ref name="SEworld"/&gt; The following year, a dedicated art book was released containing artwork of the game's characters and monsters, and an interview with Tabata.&lt;ref name="SEgameart"/&gt; Characters from the game, including Ace, Machina and other members of Class Zero, appeared in the fourth series of releases for the ''Final Fantasy Trading Card Game''.&lt;ref name="TradeCard"/&gt; In November 2011, a manga adaptation of ''Type-0'', illustrated by Takatoshi Shiozawa, began serialization in ''[[Gangan Comics|Young Gangan]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Type0manga"/&gt; The manga has been collected into a [[tankōbon]] volume and was released on April 21, 2012.&lt;ref name="manga_compilation"/&gt; Another manga titled {{Nihongo foot|''Final Fantasy Type-0 Side Story: Reaper of the Icy Blade'',|ファイナルファンタジー零式外伝 氷剣の死神|Fainaru Fantajī Reishiki Gaiden Hyouken no Shinigami|group=Jp.}} also illustrated by Shiozawa, began publication in ''Young Gangan'' in April 2012.&lt;ref name="2nd-manga"/&gt; It ended in January 2014, with a bonus chapter being published in February of that year,&lt;ref name="manga_end"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manga_bonus"/&gt; and was later released in five compiled volumes. [[Yen Press]] began distribution of the manga in the west in July 2015.&lt;ref name="ANNlicense"/&gt; Square Enix released two novel adaptations, in April and June 2012, depicting an alternate version of ''Type-0''{{'}}s story: {{Nihongo foot|''Final Fantasy Type-0: Change the World -The Answer-''|ファイナルファンタジー零式 Change the World -The Answer-|Fainaru Fantajī Reishiki Chenji Za Wārudo -Za Ansā-|group=Jp.}} and {{Nihongo foot|''Final Fantasy Type-0: Change the World Volume 2 -The Penultimate Truth-''.|ファイナルファンタジー零式 Change the World　2巻 -最後から二番目の真実-|Fainaru Fantajī Reishiki Chenji Za Wārudo 2-kan -Banme no Shinjitsu-|group=Jp.}} The novels were written by Sōki Tsukishima.&lt;ref name="Novel-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Novel-2"/&gt;

In the first week on sale, ''Final Fantasy Type-0'' sold 472,253 units, topping Japanese sales charts and selling through 79.08% of its initial shipments.&lt;ref name="T0sales1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Type0shipments"/&gt; As of January 16, 2012, the game had sold 746,203 copies in Japan.&lt;ref name="T0sales2"/&gt; It was the best-selling game of 2011 for Japanese media retail shop [[Culture Convenience Club|Tsutaya]], beating ''[[Monster Hunter Portable 3rd]]'' (PlayStation Portable) and ''[[Final Fantasy XIII-2]]'' (PlayStation 3). It was also the store's best-selling PSP title of the year, followed by ''Monster Hunter Portable 3rd'' and ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]''.&lt;ref name="SiliconSales"/&gt;

''[[Famitsu]]'' and ''[[Dengeki PlayStation]]'' both praised the story, with ''Famitsu'' saying it "vividly portrays the fact that this is a deep, intense ''Final Fantasy'' experience, something beyond just a side story".&lt;ref name="FamReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dengeki_review"/&gt; Gaming website PlayStation LifeStyle's Heath Hindman was impressed by the darker presentation, calling it "powerful and well done throughout", and was impressed with the characters despite some awkward introductory scenes.&lt;ref name="lifestyle0"/&gt; Erren Van Duine, writing for RPG Site, said that fans would appreciate the scale of the narrative, and praised the handling of the ''Fabula Nova Crystallis'' mythos. She did note that some plot points seemed only included for the sake of convenience, and that the ending forced a second playthrough to see the whole story.&lt;ref name="RPGreview"/&gt;

''Famitsu'' called the original version's gameplay a "stressless experience", praising the game's size and saying the action-oriented battle system made it "a very different ''Final Fantasy''".&lt;ref name="FamReview"/&gt; ''Dengeki PlayStation'' similarly praised its size and the tense combat, though the review found aspects of the navigation less appealing.&lt;ref name="dengeki_review"/&gt; Hindman was generally positive about most aspects of gameplay and the high replay value, but found faults with the scripted opening of the overworld and the real-time strategy segments.&lt;ref name="lifestyle0"/&gt; Van Duine said the gameplay encouraged immersion and was harsh on novices; she praised several aspects of gameplay, but described the leveling system as "tricky".&lt;ref name="RPGreview"/&gt; The multiplayer functions were universally praised in Japan.&lt;ref name="FamReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dengeki_review"/&gt; Opinions were divided on the original camera, with ''Famitsu'' praising its movement, while Van Duine and ''Dengeki PlayStation'' found issues with it getting stuck in the environment or impeding visibility.&lt;ref name="RPGreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FamReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dengeki_review"/&gt; The character AI also received criticism for being unresponsive or wayward.&lt;ref name="RPGreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lifestyle0"/&gt;

==Legacy==
{{main article|Final Fantasy Type-0 HD|Final Fantasy Agito|Final Fantasy Awakening}}
''Type-0'' affected several other works in multiple ways. During its development, several staff members and voice actors who had worked on ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' reunited. Their meeting triggered the development of ''[[Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster]]''.&lt;ref name="RemasterOrigin"/&gt; In the September 2013 issue of ''Famitsu Weekly'', Square Enix revealed ''[[Final Fantasy Agito]]'', an online companion game to ''Type-0'' for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile devices.&lt;ref name="AgitoDetails"/&gt; The game was released in May 2014, and a localization was announced alongside that of ''Type-0''.&lt;ref name="AgitoRelease"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AgitoE3"/&gt; Its servers were closed down in November 2015, with its localization being cancelled as a result.&lt;ref name="AgitoVersionEnd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AgitoInternational"/&gt; A new online game set in the ''Type-0'' universe, ''[[Final Fantasy Awakening]]'', released in Asian and English-speaking territories between 2016 and 2018.&lt;ref name="TypeOnline"/&gt;

While working on ''Final Fantasy XV'', Tabata decided to make a high-definition remaster of ''Type-0'' for eighth-generation consoles. Developed by Square Enix and [[HexaDrive]], ''[[Final Fantasy Type-0 HD]]'' was originally announced at E3 2014, and released worldwide in March 2015.&lt;ref name="Type0hex"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Type0west"/&gt; After ''Type-0''{{'}}s release, Tabata stated in an interview that he wished to explore the distant history of Orience after the events of the game.&lt;ref name="GamespotTabata"/&gt; Trademarks for ''Type-1'', ''Type-2'' and ''Type-3'' were registered shortly after the ''Type-0'' trademark, but it was suggested that they were simply a protective measure.&lt;ref name="TypesTrademarks"/&gt; During interviews given in 2014, Tabata commented that he wished to work on ''Type-1'' after completing ''XV'', and later explained the conceptual ''Type'' series as a means of publishing ''Final Fantasy'' games too experimental for the main series. He hoped to continue with the ''Type'' series if ''Type-0 HD'' was commercially successful.&lt;ref name="ParisTabata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GemTabataInterviews"/&gt;

Machina foolishly believed he would be able to control the powers granted him, but even after he had returned to Rubrum, he could still sense the Will of the White Tiger Crystal, faintly present in his mind.

Now bereft of their beacons of hope, the civilizations of Orience descended into an age of darkness and destruction. Yet in the midst of this chaos, a young man entreated the denizens of Orience to seek hope in the blessings of nature around them; to rebuild this broken world with their own hands and breathe life anew into the land. The people turned to him as their new beacon of hope, the leader of their new Orience. That man's name was Machina Kunagiri. And, at the age of 67, with a smile on his face and his loving wife at his side, he took one last look at the world he saved. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geneva Villa Moynier 1.jpg|thumb|Geneva Villa Moynier]]
The Geneva Academy is headquartered at the Villa Moynier, a historic villa surrounded by a beautiful park with a view of [[Lake Geneva]] and [[Mont Blanc]]. It was the property of [[Gustave Moynier]], the first President of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]]. It later housed the League of Nations in 1926 and served as headquarters for the ICRC between 1933 and 1946. Villa Moynier forms part of the Graduate Institute’s [[Campus de la paix]] and is five minutes’ walk from the [[Maison de la paix]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8528">The Growing Participator Approach (GPA) is an alternative paradigm for [[Second-language acquisition|second language acquisition]] created by Greg Thomson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://growingparticipatorapproach.blogspot.com|title=Growing Participator Approach to a host world (An Alternative to "Second Language Acquisition")|website=growingparticipatorapproach.blogspot.com|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In GPA, the goal is not language acquisition, but participation in the life of a new community, which is constantly growing over time. Thus, GPA uses the terminology of a 'growing participator' instead of a language learner, and a 'nurturer' instead of a teacher. Theoretically, GPA draws upon James Wersch's sociocultural theory and concepts of mediated learning, along with [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s [[zone of proximal development]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Andrew|first=Sawin, Thor|title=Second Language Learnerhood Among Cross-Cultural Field Workers|date=2013|publisher=University of South Carolina|url=http://scholarcommons.sc.edu/etd/1534|language=en}}p.149.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Language pedagogy|language of pedagogy]], GPA involves an approach, a method, and techniques.

== Approach ==
Thomson suggests three dimensions of language learning (or participation) which are important for GPA.

=== Sociocultural Dimension ===
GPA views language as inseparable from the culture which supports it and the people who live in that culture and their relationships. This sociocultural dimension is fundamental.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mas, Roser Noguera and Baiguatova, Gulnara|first=|date=2015-04-10|title=Growing Participator Approach: Our Experience as Amharic Students and Teachers of Spanish and Russian Languages|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042815019680|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|language=en|volume=178|pages=169–174|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.03.175|issn=1877-0428|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, instead of  learning language in isolation, the goal is to learn a new way of life (languaculture). Hence, GPA uses the terminology of "growing participators" rather than "language learners". The goal of a growing participator is to learn and grow into a new "languacultural world".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://growingparticipatorapproach.wordpress.com/the-growing-participator-approach-gpa-a-brief-state-of-the-art-and-some-practical-illustrations/|title=The Growing Participator Approach (GPA):  A Brief State of the Art and Some Practical Illustrations|last=Thomson|first=Greg|date=2012|work=Growing Participator Approach|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happens most effectively when a learner is operating within their growth zone ([[Zone of proximal development|ZPD]]). 

=== Cognitive Dimension ===
Drawing on fields of psycholinguistics, and noting that good comprehension of English speech requires a listening vocabulary of over 10,000 words, GPA  emphasizes "massive comprehension vocabulary." However, instead of rote memorisation, GPA advocates for continual exposure, "encountering a massive amount of understandable speech over a long period of time", in order to slowly internalize vocabulary without trying to memorise one by one.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, GPA emphasises comprehension and listening far ahead of speech in the host language.

=== Temporal Dimension ===
All language programs emphasize time, but in GPA the focus is not on quantity of time, but on quality. GPA aims for at least 15 hours/week during which "people interact with me in my growth zone in their languacultural world."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, because a beginning learner's growth zone is that of a child, in order for GPA to be put into practice a dedicated native speaker must be hired in the early stages.

=== Language Acquisition in GPA ===
Based on these three dimensions, GPA's approach can be summarised as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|+Presuppositions about Language Acquisition in GPA&lt;ref&gt;Cassi, Heidi (2005). [http://www.hamline.edu/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2147490891 The Thomson method of study for second language acquisition: A diary study]. (Thesis). St. Paul, MN: Hamline University, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;
| rowspan="5" |Communing
|1. Second language acquisition occurs through comprehension of real messages
|-
|2. Messages must contain input that is a little more than the level the learner currently understands (i.e. in their growth zone).
|-
|3. Acquisition occurs when the learner is focusing on something other than acquisition (i.e. focus on the message).
|-
|4. Second language acquisition occurs when the learner is not ‘on the defensive’.
|-
|5. The learning environment should be comfortable and should keep anxiety levels low.
|-
| rowspan="7" |Understanding
|6. Second language acquisition produces listening skills prior to speaking skills.
|-
|7. Learners should be given a “silent period”.
|-
|8. Second language acquisition is not conscious interaction with/awareness of grammar rules.
|-
|9. Consciously learned grammar is a tool for specific tasks, such as writing and editing, and should be used when time allows.
|-
|10. Second language acquisition does involve the acquisition of grammatical structures, generally in a predictable order. However, this does not mean we should try to teach grammar according to this order.
|-
|11. Subconsciously acquired language is responsible for initiating utterances and for fluency.
|-
|12. Conscious learning does have a role, but not a central role, in second language acquisition.
|-
| rowspan="3" |Talking
|13. Second language acquisition does not require tedious drilling.
|-
|14. Production develops gradually and is not taught directly.
|-
|15. Second language acquisition takes time and develops slowly/subtly as opposed to learning which can be fast/obvious for some people.
|-
| rowspan="2" |Evolving
|16. Focus of study should remain on receiving quality input, not on receiving error correction.
|-
|17. Activities should be adjusted to keep the learner comprehending and processing target language.
|}

== Method ==
The ''Six-Phase Program'' (SPP), created by Thomson, is "an idealised program to guide a growing participator into deep involvement with a community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://growingparticipatorapproach.wordpress.com/an-idealized-program-six-phases-of-super-charged-activities/|title=An Idealized Program ~ Six Phases of Super-Charged Activities|date=2013-01-17|work=Growing Participator Approach|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves 1,500 hours of special-growth activities, assisted (initially) by a dedicated native speaker - who does not need to be a teacher. It is "structured in such a way that the activities become increasingly advanced as the user grows, and the activities are "keyed to the sociocultural/human-relationship changes and cognitive changes that the growing participator (GP) undergoes."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Techniques ===
GPA and the SPP utilise a wide array of techniques, such as [[Total physical response|TPR]] activities (in silence for the first 30-40 hrs), back and forth storytelling, wordless picture books, discussing speech acts with the use of resources such as [http://www.lexicarry.com/ Lexicarry], input/output flooding, ethnographic interviews, and extensive recording and playback for revision.

'''Guido Monte''' (born 1962 - died 2017) was an [[Italians|Italian]] writer and poet. In his mature works, he employed linguistic blending in the search for meaningful and archetypal relations between distant cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mid.muohio.edu/segue/contributors2.htm Monte's bio on  ''Segue'', mid.muohio.edu] of [[Miami University Middletown]]&lt;/ref&gt;
His works and translations have been published by international magazines (as  ''[[Words Without Borders]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordswithoutborders.org/contributor/guido-monte Monte on ''Words Without Borders'']. WWB is the magazine of Alane Salierno Mason, translator of [[Elio Vittorini]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Swans (magazine)|Swans Commentary]]'', and ''[[Ars Interpres]]''). On his blending experiments, he uses also Japanese,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://happano.sub.jp/happano/pages/fragments/63.html ''Dapur Vetur'', on ''Happa no kofu'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanskrit]],&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.swans.com/library/art14/gmonte42.html ''Journey n.6...'' on ''Swans Commentary'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheng (linguistics)|Sheng]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swans.com/library/art13/gmonte14.html ''written on my sanbenito'', on ''Swans Commentary'']&lt;/ref&gt; and languages of ethnic groups in [[Kenya]].

== Poetry and linguistic blending ==
On the way of [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Ezra Pound]]'s ''Cantos'' and [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'', Monte thinks that "…if we admit that some archetypal ideas are common among our planet inhabitants, then we can state, in the sense meant by Borges, that just one "Book" has been written, as an evidence of the original and permanent cultural unity of the world and it contains all the chaotic fragments ever thought and written by people searching for the deep truth of things…".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.happano.org/pages/fragments/63-2.html ''Cosmopolitan multilingualism'', on ''Happa no kofu'']&lt;/ref&gt;
Different languages can be approached and mixed "to transmit something that apparently is far in space and time" (on what was defined as ''a meta-communicative way''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swans.com/library/art13/saieva01.html Francesca Saieva, ''Linguistic Blending. A Way...'' Swans.com]&lt;/ref&gt;). On this thinking, a  ''blending'' author can "compose" poems and works without using his own verses, but only other poets' lines (and sometimes this is Monte's peculiarity), remembering every time, in the beginning, the names of the authors.  On another experiment, in fact, Monte puts together, in a common archetypal idea, lines of [[Virgil]], Dante and Blake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mid.muohio.edu/segue/4.2/Segue%204-2.swf ''Origines'', on ''Segue'']&lt;/ref&gt;
If Monte translates, for instance, the first verses of Genesis or any other holy texts in two or three languages, "…we realize that the new and different sounds, irrespective of our linguistic knowledge, suggest new, universal, cosmic vibrations that the original version didn't succeed in transmitting. In any case they reveal the complexity of reading different levels":
''In principio diviserunt Elohim / coelum et terram / and the land was left barren / et les ombres noires / enveloppaient les profondeurs / bade korgolòdei dar ruie / oghionusoh parmisad / et aura divina / super oceani undas'' (''Genesis'', Words Without Borders, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordswithoutborders.org/article/genesis-creation/ Monte on ''Words Without Borders'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Alison Phipps, expert in Intercultural Studies, defines this form of blending as an ''embroidering gossamer''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swans.com/library/past_issues/2008/080922.html Swans commentary, sept.2008]. [http://researchingmultilingually.com/?page_id=806 Alison Phipps] (Professor of Languages and Intercultural Studies at the University of Glasgow) about it: ''“It is good to think with others about how languages find their way into the cracks and crevices of our lives – how they create a gossamer of relatedness which always has an unpredictable feel and future”''. ([http://www.swans.com/library/art14/gmonte52.html A.Phipps on ''Swans Commentary'', 2008]). About her collaboration in eSharp project, see [http://www.sojel.co.uk/SOJEL/Sojel%20Papers/Sojel%20June%202007%20issue.pdf  "Views from the bridge: publishing as a voyage of discovery", SOJEL, June 2007].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In his latest experiments, on [[Swans (magazine)|Swans Commentary]], the [[Visual poetry|visual]] coloured arrangement of verses (one colour for each one of the poem's selected authors) is important in conveying the intended effect of his [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] works.&lt;ref&gt;About Monte and his new blending approach, the French translator [http://www.champendal.com/docs/Le_Rugbyman_Nomade_Richard_Beard.pdf Marie Rennard] said :''"...sa démarche demande à être expliquée, la " résonnance cosmique " qu'il évoque peut faire sourire au prime abord, et pourtant, à le lire, à le relire, on sent naître cette communion des verbes de toutes langues, et sans être forcément à même de saisir toute l'ampleur d'une démarche qui, selon son propre aveu, le dépasse lui-même, on éprouve le plaisir profond que font naître les véritables poètes à l'oreille d'en dedans, pur bonheur, mere happiness, autentica felicità''". ([http://storage.canalblog.com/90/28/320433/17561486.doc ''Langues et mixité'', Introduction de Marie Rennard)])&lt;/ref&gt;

The French writer Orlando de Rudder,&lt;ref&gt;de Rudder teaches Medieval Literature and History of French Language at the ''Ecole Superieure de Commerce'' of Paris, (see [http://www.bibliopoche.com/auteur/De-Rudder-Orlando/23495.html bibliopoche.com] and [http://www.terascia.com/article.php?sid=470 terascia.com])&lt;/ref&gt; thinks that Monte's attempts are the beginning of a new ''"synthèse" des langues'', a form of ''Babel Library'' where all the world poets live together, syncretistically, common universal feelings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orlandoderudder.canalblog.com/archives/2006/09/14/2678504.html comment on de Rudder's blog]&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian writer [[Claudio Magris]] thinks that this kind of poetry is definable as ''meticciato organico'' (''organic blending'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swans.com/library/art17/saieva04.html swans.com, 25 avril 2011]; about Monte's blending, see also the opinion of Magris on [http://riviste.unimi.it/index.php/inkoj/article/view/2388/2617 In Koj] (University of Milan, p.208&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hello Down There''''' (re-released in 1974 as '''''Sub-A-Dub-Dub''''') is a 1969 American [[Comedy film|comedy]]-[[adventure film]] from [[Paramount Pictures]], produced by [[George Sherman]] and [[Ivan Tors]], directed [[Jack Arnold (director)|Jack Arnold]] and [[Ricou Browning]] (underwater sequences), and starring [[Tony Randall]] and [[Janet Leigh]]. The [[screenplay]] was written by [[John McGreevey]] and Frank Telford. Its 1974 re-release was part of  the "Paramount Family Matinee" series.

==Plot==
Fred Miller ([[Tony Randall]]) must prove that his new design for an underwater home is viable by convincing his family to live in it for 30 days. His son and daughter (Gary Tigerman and Kay Cole) are members of an emerging pop rock band ([[Richard Dreyfuss]] and [[Lou Wagner]]) whom they invite to live with them during the experiment. Their temporary home, which Miller dubs the "Green Onion," is 90 feet below the surface of the ocean and is filled with super-modern appliances and amenities for house-wife Vivian ([[Janet Leigh]]), all designed by Miller. A hole in the floor provides direct access to and from the sea.

The group are soon joined by a live-in [[Pinniped|seal]] named Gladys and a pair of dolphins (Duke and Duchess), which stay close at hand and fend off unwanted sharks. They are confronted by many obstacles including a rival designer ([[Ken Berry]]) from Undersea Development, Inc. who begins to cause problems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9900EFDC133AEE34BC4E51DFB0668382679EDE Weiler, A. H. ''Hello Down There (1969) Undersea Rock 'n' Roll'', (1969-06-26) ''The New York Times''], retrieved 2009-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the band's single has gotten the attention of record executive Nate Ashbury ([[Roddy McDowall]]), who decides to sign them sight-unseen. He takes the liberty of booking them for an important television performance on ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' without first communicating with them. After learning that they are inaccessible under the sea, he proves that the show must go on and that he will go to great lengths to reach them. They get their airing on television, but the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] is put on alert by the sounds of music coming from the sea. A naval fleet is dispatched to investigate what must surely be a Communist plot!

An '''Indian princess''' (or '''Native American princess''') is a representation of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous women of the Americas]]. Often, Indian princesses are portrayed as daughters of [[Tribal chiefs]] and are depicted as cartoons that conform to unnatural standards of beauty.&lt;ref name="Garcia_157-166"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garcia|first1=Alma|title=Contested Images: Women of Color in Popular Culture|date=2012|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Lanham, Md|pages=157–166|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous and legendized Indian princess is [[Pocahontas]]. The phrase "Indian princess" is often considered to be a derogatory term and is deemed offensive to Natives.

== Background ==

=== Origin of the Indian princess ===
In the 17th and 18th centuries, American colonial culture portrayed the Native woman as a symbol of the Americas.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Rayna|date=1975|title=The Pocahontas Perplex: The Image of Indian Women in American Culture|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25088595|journal=The Massachusetts Review|volume=16|issue=4|pages=698–714}}&lt;/ref&gt; For colonists, the Native woman represented mysterious new land and enticing new freedoms, and could dignify the Americas as a potential source of power.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As the colonists became more independent, the Native American woman was typecast as the Indian princess. In paintings and engravings, North America was personified by the symbol of the Indian princess, who wore a feathered headdress, gripped a bow and arrow, and was often depicted in pursuit of freedom.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleming|first=E. McClung|date=1965|title=The American Image as Indian Princess 1765-1783|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1180453|journal=Winterthur Portfolio|volume=2|pages=65–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, the Indian princess was pictured leading troops of American colonists into battle; in later years, she could be seen cloaked in the American flag.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The symbol of the Indian princess relied on ideas of freedom, power, wildness, and loyalty to the white man.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These themes can be seen in modern media renditions of the Indian princess; for example, in portrayals of Pocahontas, who has been defined by her untamed connection to nature and her alleged rescue of [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Though the image of the grand and liberated Indian princess was commonly used to epitomize America, icons and accounts depicting Native and indigenous women as savages and [[Squaw|squaws]] were still publicized and normalized.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Historic roles of Native women ===
Generally, Native American and indigenous women of all statuses were in charge of the agricultural sector of tribal life. They cleared fields, planted, and harvested crops, providing most of the food for the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.gen.026|title=NATIVE AMERICAN GENDER ROLES|last=Wishart|first=David J.|date=2011|website=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proximity to nature is reflected and often exaggerated in depictions of Indian princesses in media.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4mj0|title=Jesus and Pocahontas: Gospel, Mission, and National Myth|last=Snyder|first=Howard A.|date=2015|publisher=Lutterworth Press|isbn=9780718894191}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Native woman’s symbolization of American land and agriculture also gave rise to her as a symbol of fertility. Twentieth century poet [[Hart Crane]] describes Pocahontas as “'a woman, ripe, waiting to be taken'” by the white man.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Native women also played integral roles in the [[North American fur trade|fur trade]], acting as interpreters. In some tribes, Native women of higher status were able to participate in council, elect chiefs, and participate in battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shoemaker|first=Nancy|date=1995|title=Native-American Women in History|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25163037|journal=OAH Magazine of History|volume=9|issue=4|pages=10–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Native American life evolved alongside colonial culture, Native women began to play a larger role in [[Euro American|Euro-American]] life. Recruited by settlers as interpreters, guides, craftspeople, and servants, some Native women assimilated, or were forced to assimilate, into colonial society.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parezo|first=Nancy J.|last2=Jones|first2=Angelina R.|date=2009|title=What's in a Name?: The 1940s-1950s "Squaw Dress"|url=http://electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/216862711?accountid=7418|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=33|issue=3|pages=373-404, 423|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native women of higher rank, such as daughters of chiefs, could also be recruited to marry white settlers. Though it was generally seen as cultural advancement for a Native woman to be accepted into Euro-American society, many of these women were still referred to as [[Squaw|squaws]], despite their elevation of class.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

The Native woman’s assimilation into colonial society is a key part of many depictions of Indian princesses in media.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is often conveyed through the religious conversion of the Indian princess, portrayals of the Indian princess and white men in close proximity, and illustrations of the Indian princess with a skin tone lighter than other Natives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Media representation==

=== Common Characteristics ===
The “Indian Princess” is determined by her relationship with the white man and her behavior that deems her the idealized Indian woman. This observation of Native American women in media, like any, is important because it reveals to the audience the lifestyle of a culture that is generally hidden from the public&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/463320173|title=Killing the Indian maiden : images of Native American women in film|last=1963-|first=Marubbio, M. Elise,|date=2009|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=9780813192383|oclc=463320173}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Indian Princess serves to be an important connection between white culture and native culture, specifically the dominance of the former over the latter&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. The Princess thus serves as a model for assimilation into a more civilized society&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. She gains this privilege by guiding the white man into her territory. Native female author, Denise K. Lajimodiere, elaborates on this idea of the Indian Princess being an aid to the white man by claiming that Princesses must help non-indians in their conquest against their own people in order to achieve a likeness to their European counterparts&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lajimodiere|first=Denise K.|date=May 2013|title=American Indian Females and Stereotypes: Warriors, Leaders, Healers, Feminists; Not Drudges, Princesses, Prostitutes|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15210960.2013.781391|journal=Multicultural Perspectives|language=en|volume=15|issue=2|pages=104–109|doi=10.1080/15210960.2013.781391|issn=1521-0960}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Because of this, the Indian Princess is seen as a sidekick to the white hero. John M. Coward asserts that their relationship is based on a power dynamic that shows the colonizers as heroes to a group of savages because they had helped them transition from barbarism to a refined society&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Coward, John M. “The Princess and the Squaw: The Construction of Native American Women in the Pictorial Press.” ''Indians Illustrated: The Image of Native Americans in the Pictorial Press'', University of Illinois Press, Urbana; Chicago; Springfield, 2016, pp. 71–93. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/j.ctt18j8xvg.7.&lt;/ref&gt;. Typically, the Indian Princess serves as a symbol of triumph for white men in colonizing and asserting their power over Native people&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;.

Indian Princesses are considered to be the idealized Indian woman&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;. These woman are commonly depicted with lighter skin and follow other European Beauty standards. Coward claims that Indian women who then follow this standard and show signs of a charming feminine beauty will become the woman men lust after&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;. Their characterization isolates themselves from typical Native American women and portray them as an extension of their white counterparts. This emphasizes the “otherness” of Native American woman who are considered to be a squaw figure if they don’t adopt these beauty regimes&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;. The decision for Native American woman to become an Indian Princess or [[squaw]] depends on their relationship with men&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. [[Squaw|Squaws]] are “uncivilized” Indian woman while Indian Princesses are gentle and loving toward her white hero. The Indian Princess acts as a symbol of the success of these colonizers, the “otherness” of Native Americans is combatted when she acts as a medium between these two cultures&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;. Scholars agree then agree that Indian Princesses in media are portrayed as submissive, idealized supporting figures to the white hero. This sentiment is clearly evident in characters such as [[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]] and [[Tiger Lily (Peter Pan)|Tiger Lily]].

===Tiger Lily===
[[Tiger Lily (Peter Pan)|Tiger Lily]] is an Indian princess character from the [https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/racist-history-peter-pan-indian-tribe-180953500/ Piccaninny Tribe] &lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shipley|first=Heather E.|date=April 2012|title=Fairies, Mermaids, Mothers, and Princesses: Sexual Difference and Gender Roles inPeter Pan|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F15240657.2012.682946|journal=Studies in Gender and Sexuality|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=145–159|doi=10.1080/15240657.2012.682946|issn=1524-0657}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Peter and Wendy]]'' by [[J. M. Barrie]]. In the book, she is captured by [[Captain Hook]] and [[Mr. Smee]] and it is rescued by [[Peter Pan]]. She only speaks in a stereotypical dialect with a limited command of the language&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Citation|last=Wilson|first=Ann|title=Hauntings: Anxiety, Technology, and Gender in Peter Pan|date=2003-01-31|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3138/9781442620926-010|work=Modern Drama|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9781442620926|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; following her rescue. Her most famous depiction in adaptation is in the [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|1953 Disney film]]. Controversy has surrounded the character, as its representation has been touted as racist and sexist. Tiger Lily is depicted as both a sexualized figure&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and a strong warrior&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=FitzPatrick|first=Theresa J.|date=2014|title=Sacred Kisses and Profane Thimbles: Dual Female Identity in J.M.

In an early version of the manuscript, Tiger Lily plays out a rape fantasy by asking Peter Pan what would happen if he attacked her in the woods to which the other Indians replied that “she him’s [[squaw]]”&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;. The depiction of Tiger Lily stands in stark contrast to the female figure of [[Wendy Darling|Wendy]]&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;. While many of the female characters appear to desire the affections of Peter Pan&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;, Wendy, the older sister in the Darling family, is presented as a pure, motherly, and talkative figure, often associated with the color white&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;. Conversely, Tiger Lily is depicted as both ethnic and quiet&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;, but not embodying the stereotypical role of a woman. Although Peter Pan saves both Wendy and Tiger Lily in the story, Tiger Lily promises to protect him from the threat of pirates in return'''&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;'''. Tiger Lily is brave in the face of fear and possesses important knowledge of the forest&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;.   

===Pocahontas===
The Disney character [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]], eponymous star of the [[Pocahontas (1995 film)|1995 Disney film]] is the most famous modern representation of an Indian princess. She has been inducted to the ranks of the [[Disney Princess]] franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pocahontas {{!}} Disney Princess|url=http://princess.disney.com/pocahontas|website=www.princess.disney.com|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical reception of her character has panned her overly sexualized portrayal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edgerton|first1=Gary|last2=Jackson|first2=Kathy Merlock|title=Redesigning Pocahontas|journal=Journal of Popular Film and Television|date=Summer 1996|volume=24|issue=2|page=90|doi=10.1080/01956051.1996.9943718|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01956051.1996.9943718?journalCode=vjpf20#.VI6FsGTF8gA|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her appearance was modeled on a number of sources, including Eskimo-French Canadian/Cree actress [[Irene Bedard]], who provided the character's speaking voice,&lt;ref&gt;Weeks, Janet (June 30, 1995).

She represents the “noble savage” in her willingness to defy the stereotypical traits assigned to indigenous people, instead embracing traits of the colonists, specifically her adventurous spirit which allows her to turn her back on her past and embrace new opportunities&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;.

== Indian Princess Costume ==
Dressing up as Indian costumes is a term referred to as ‘Playing Indian’. 'Playing Indian’ is an American practice that goes back to colonial times. During [[Boston Tea Party|The Boston Tea Party]], colonists were dressed up as Indians, as they threw the English’s tea of the ship and into the harbour. The colonists wore feathers, blankets and drew black soot on their faces to portray themselves as Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=d73a47b0-4fd2-48f2-8ee0-f154a8af9ae5@sessionmgr101|title=Invisibility in the Color-Blind Era|last=Robertson|first=Dwanna L.|date=2015|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ‘Indian princess’ is often used as a form of dress-up, costume or a form of ‘playing Indian’. Many non-indigenous people believe that dressing up as and Indian princess’ is innocent, inoffensive and harmless. The [[cultural appropriation]] of native traditional dress as a costume is often viewed as offensive because it ignores the traditional Native-American regalia as significant and regularly sexualizes Native American women.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=c023f3c0-4b21-4ee7-86fb-86a28168a315%40pdc-v-sessmgr01|title='My culture is not a costume': the influence of stereotypes on children in middle childhood|last=Lara-Cooper|first=Kisban|last2=Cooper|first2=Sammy|date=2016|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to authors, Kisban Lara-Cooper and Sammy Cooper, Society’s idea of the image of an Indian princess exists only historically. Therefore Indian princess costumes represent historical figures and representations. The costumes are not Indian princesses living and existing in today’s society.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This is because today’s populations of Indian-Americans lack relations with the rest of America. 57% of Native Americans live off reserves, while 34% do live on [[Indian reserve|Indian reserves]], being the smallest population of any other racial groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&amp;sid=29e03e66-1c75-4e56-9fd2-8d58cb15ba88@sdc-v-sessmgr04|title=Of Warrior Chiefs and Indian Princesses: The Psychological Consequences of ...: EBSCOhost|last=Fryberg|first=Stephanie A.|date=July 2008|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Reclaiming the stereotype==

=== Real Life Indian Princesses ===
[[Sarah Winnemucca]], a Northern [[Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah|Paiute]] educator, translator, author, and activist, is a well known performer who acted as an Indian princess. She played many roles in the late 1800s after she came to northeastern United States in 1883. She had previously spent more than 13 years negotiating with the press on presentations of herself and American Indians in newspaper media. It is debated on whether she is considered a positive figure for the Indian princess stereotype as her actions are contested by scholars as conforming to [[European Americans|Euro-American]] standards. 

She often referred to herself as a “princess” and dressed the part despite the fact that her familial status did not uphold that power, nor was it recognized as part of the structure of her tribe’s leadership. Sorisio argues that by using the English term “princess” to refer to herself, she claimed power that the press was able to attribute to her and the Paiute nation. Her role as a princess served to “legitimize in non-Native discourse Northern Paiutes’ political identity”. Scholar, [http://americanhistory.si.edu/profile/411 Rayna Green], argues that this persona feeds into colonial desires for Native Americans to be a “helpmate”. The question of her legitimacy is further contested in her costuming. 

Scholars argue that the inaccuracies within the costuming that Winnemucca models suggests compliance with the non-Native desires of an Indian princess. [https://anthropology.si.edu/staff/Scherer/Scherer.html Joanna Cohan Scherer], argues that Winnemucca exhibits a "Pocahontas complex”  as she dresses in clothing that is not representative of a Paiute woman. She dresses in cloth rather than buckskin and in “elaborate nontraditional costumes”. Some critic her actions as a form of complacency in colonialism. Even so, some scholars see her actions as a means of working through the system to achieve societal presence. [https://english.uiowa.edu/people/linda-bolton Linda Bolton] argues that the persona that Winnemucca presents acts as a bridge to help non-natives see Native Americans. She states that even by wearing the inauthentic clothing, she presents an irony of the Indian identity. She states that there is an “authentic Indian self, the vanishing American” that is difficult to translate into Euro-American culture. Media represents the Native American culture as an “unknowable other”, so the irony of a real Native American in inauthentic clothing reveal the absence of the real individuals that exist, in media. According to Bolton, the “unknowable other” is made “present” by Winnemucca. Winnemucca even references the issue of costuming in her lectures. She states that the lack of materials needed to recreate the clothing is understood by the audience because it is a performance. As an Indian princess, she uses the performances to reflect presentations of herself and Native Americans regardless. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorisio|first=Carolyn|date=2011|title=Playing the Indian Princess?

===Indian princess pageants===
Indian princess pageants have taken the stereotype and used it as a form of [[empowerment]] for young indigenous women.&lt;ref name="Powwow"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Clyde|last2=Lassiter|first2=Luke Eric|last3=Dunham|first3=Gary H.|title=Powwow|date=2005|publisher=Lincoln and London: University of Nebraska Press|pages=152–171|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to typical beauty pageants that judge based on physical appearance, indigenous women who compete in Indian princess pageants are judged on how well they promote traditional values and represent their community and not on how they look.&lt;ref name="Powwow"/&gt;

==== Indian princess pageants throughout history ====
In 1940 [[Ella Cara Deloria|Ella Deloria]], a [[Yankton Sioux Tribe|Yankton Sioux]] scholar, produced a pageant named ''The Life Story of a People'' for the Native Americans of Robeson Country and surrounding areas &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gardner|first=Susan|date=2006|title=“‘Weaving an Epic Story’: Ella Cara Deloria’s Pageant for the Indians of Robeson County, North Carolina, 1940-1941.”|url=electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edsglr&amp;AN=edsgcl.188999147&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|journal=The Mississippi Quarterly|volume=1|pages=33-39|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was part of a morale and community-building effort that is also now recognized by American Indian scholars as an important effort toward accurate representation of Native Americans in theatre &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. It was supported by the [https://www.dakotaindianfoundation.net/ Dakota Indian Foundation] and had since become a tradition &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. [http://www.lumbeetribe.com/history--culture Lumbee Indians], the ninth largest tribe in the United States, has referenced the pageants done by Deloria within their historical narrative, demonstrating the pageants’ “contribut[ion] to the persistence and revitalization of […] Indian identity through narrative and performance” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Deloria’s pageantry began with the assimilation and accommodation of Euramerican institutions, but later developed into an exploration of “Indian identities under siege” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; where Native American people performed themselves and acted out their stories in her pageants. According to [https://www.umass.edu/history/member/david-glassberg David Glassberg], pageantry characteristically has a “theme of […] keeping pace with modernity [and] retaining a particular version of their traditions”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/246734754|title=American historical pageantry : the uses of tradition in the early twentieth century|last=David.|first=Glassberg,|date=1990|publisher=Univ. of North Carolina Pr|isbn=0807819166|oclc=246734754}}&lt;/ref&gt;, an effort that Native American pageantry has since been able to accomplish. According to Deloria, the purpose of her pageants were to “reclaim, with pride, the cultural resources of the past” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; through theatre. American Indian scholars agree that pageantry was able to reclaim the historical tellings of history that had thus been juxtaposed by media’s representation of the past.  

Feminist writers like Wendy Kozol make note of beauty pageant winners who exemplify Native American tradition within the Euro-American cultural context. According to Kozol, Viola Noah a runner-up for the [http://www.choctawindianfair.com/pageant/index.html Choctaw Princess award] in the1973 Labor Day gathering stepped away from the typical photo rendering of Native American princesses &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kozol|first=Wendy|date=2005-04-01|title=Miss Indian America: Regulatory Gazes and the Politics of Affiliation|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/20459007|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=31|issue=1|pages=64|doi=10.2307/20459007|issn=0046-3663}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Previous winners were typically shown with traditional Native American attire in natural settings for an ‘“authentic”’ rendering of Native Americans &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. This, however, is interpreted by feminist writers like Kozol as more of a suggestion that Native Americans are “living relics of the past” (Kozol 70) because it suggests a society that has been untouched by time or colonization. Kozol calls the photo of Noah a “competing form […] of affiliation” &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; because she wears traditional attire with modern American elements within the photo. She explains that Native tribes have often used pageants and parades as cultural practices to keep tradition alive.

===Calgary Stampede Indian Princess===
The [[Calgary Stampede]] Indian Princess contest began in 1964.&lt;ref name="facebook.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestones Calgary Stampede Indian Princess|url=https://www.facebook.com/CSIndianPrincess/info?tab=milestone|website=www.Facebook.com|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Calgary Stampede Indian Princess joins the Calgary Stampede Rodeo Queen and Princesses to complete the Calgary Stampede Rodeo Royalty.

Evelyn Locker (née Eagle Speaker) of the [[Kainai Nation]] was the first [[First Nations]] woman to participate in and be crowned as Calgary Stampede royalty in 1954.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jourdey|first1=Susan L|title=The Expectations of a Queen: Identity and Race Politics at the Calgary Stampede|url=https://www.academia.edu/537721/The_Expectations_of_a_Queen_Identity_and_Race_Politics_in_the_Calgary_Stampede|website=www.academia.edu|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy erupted after Evelyn Eagle Speaker’s crowning because she was of Aboriginal descent. The issues surrounding her crowning focused on how she should represent the Calgary Stampede and perform her role as Queen, specifically what kind of clothing she should wear (her traditional regalia or cowgirl gear). Most of the time the Calgary press referred to her as the Indian Princess instead of her rightful title as Rodeo Queen.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt;

Various terms have been used to refer to the '''religious beliefs of the 175 ethnolinguistic groups of the Philippines''', where each had their own form of indigenous government prior to colonization from Islam and Spain. They are characterized as being [[Animism|animistic]], and have been collectively referred to as '''Anitism''' or '''Bathalism''' or the more modern and less Tagalog-centric '''Dayawism'''.&lt;ref name="Almocera2005"&gt;Almocera, Ruel A., (2005) Popular Filipino Spiritual Beliefs with a proposed Theological Response. in Doing Theology in the Philippines.

The profusion of different terms arises from the fact that these indigenous religions mostly flourished in the pre-colonial period before the Philippines had become a single nation.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Scott  | first = William Henry  | authorlink = William Henry Scott (historian)   | coauthors =  | title = Barangay: Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society  | publisher = Ateneo de Manila University Press  | date = 1994  | location = Quezon City  | isbn = 971-550-135-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The various peoples of the Philippines spoke different languages and thus used different terms to describe their religious beliefs.   While these beliefs can be treated as separate religions, scholars have noted that they follow a "''common structural framework of ideas''" which can be studied together.&lt;ref name="SitoyJr1985"/&gt;

Some writers have noted that these beliefs have similarities with the [[Shinto]] religion of [[Japan]], although they do not draw a historical linkage between the two belief systems.&lt;ref name="Gutierrez2017"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=mYEoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=anito+Philippines+shinto&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eXCig7dTQ9&amp;sig=1HJUBcwvyTpVNsBipF2PStnEh-U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-sLWXt9TXAhWBuZQKHam4BhQQ6AEIggEwDg#v=onepage&amp;q=anito%2520Philippines%2520shinto&amp;f=false |title=Mixed Magic: Global-local Dialogues in Fairy Tales for Young Readers |last=Gutierrez |first=Anna Katrina |date=2017-06-15 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |isbn=9789027265456 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; More historically linked are the various indigenous religious beliefs the various religions of Oceania and the maritime Southeast Asia, which draw their roots from Austronesian beliefs as those in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborne2004"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Osborne  | first = Milton  | authorlink = Milton Osborne  | coauthors =  | title = Southeast Asia: An Introductory History  | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin  | date = 2004  | location = Australia  | pages =  | volume =  | edition = Ninth  | url =  | doi =  | id =    | isbn = 1-74114-448-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, an estimated 2% of the Philippine population identified as practicing indigenous beliefs - the majority of whom live in isolated areas where [[Islam]], [[Catholicism]], or [[Protestantism]] have not become dominant. Since the entrance of the 21st century, streams of Christian and Muslim Filipinos are steadily reverting to their indigenous ethnic religions that were once branded as lowly by Spanish, American, and Arabians colonizers, but have been affirmed by the social sciences as comprehensive and highly in nature.&lt;ref name=pew&gt;[http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/philippines/religious_demography Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project: Philippines]. [[Pew Research Center]]. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, many aspects of these traditions have been integrated into the local practice of Catholicism and Islam, resulting in syncretistic practices called "[[Folk Catholicism]]"&lt;ref name="Almocera2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maggay1999"/&gt; and "[[Folk Islam]]".&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;

The folklore narratives associated with these religious beliefs constitute what is now called [[Philippine mythology]], and is an important aspect of the study of [[Philippine culture]] and [[Filipino psychology]].

== Religious worldview ==
{{Main|Anito}}
[[File:Ifugao sculpture Louvre 70-1999-4-1.jpg|thumb|15th century ''[[bulul]]'', an ''[[anito]]'' representation, with a ''pamahan'' (ceremonial bowl) in the [[Louvre Museum]]]]
Historian T. Valentino Sitoy, in his review of documents concerning pre-Spanish religious beliefs, notes that three core characteristics which shaped the religious worldview of Filipinos throughout the archipelago before the arrival of Spanish colonizers. First, Filipinos believed in the existence of parallel [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]], which was invisible but had an influence on the visible world.  Second, Filipinos believed that there were spirits (''[[anito]]'') everywhere - ranging from the high creator gods to minor spirits that lived in the environment such as trees or rocks or creeks. Third, Filipinos believed that events in the human world were influenced by the actions and interventions of these spirit beings.&lt;ref name="SitoyJr1985"/&gt;

''Anito'' were the [[ancestor spirit]]s (''umalagad''), or nature spirits and deities (''[[diwata]]'') in the indigenous [[Animism|animistic]] religions of [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|precolonial Philippines]]. ''Paganito'' (also ''maganito'' or ''anitohan'') refers to a [[séance]], often accompanied by other rituals or celebrations, in which a shaman ([[Visayan languages|Visayan]]: ''[[babaylan]]'', [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''[[katalonan]]'') acts as a [[mediumship|medium]] to communicate directly with the spirits. When a nature spirit or deity is specifically involved, the ritual is called ''pagdiwata'' (also ''magdiwata'' or ''diwatahan''). ''Anito'' can also refer to the act of worship or a religious sacrifice to a spirit.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rosa"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio Sánchez de la Rosa|title =Diccionario Hispano-Bisaya para las provincias de Samar y Leyte, Volumes 1-2|publisher =Tipo-Litografia de Chofre y Comp.|year =1895|page=414|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=7EwHAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Spanish missionaries arrived in the Philippines, the word "''anito''" came to be associated with the physical representations of spirits that featured prominently in ''paganito'' rituals. During the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American rule of the Philippines (1898–1946)]], the meaning of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''idolo'' ("a thing worshiped") has been further conflated with the English word "[[Cult image|idol]]", and thus ''anito'' has come to refer almost exclusively to the carved figures or statues (''taotao'') of ancestral and nature spirits.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sawyer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederic H. Sawyer|title =The Inhabitants of the Philippines|publisher =Charles Scribner's Sons|year =1900|url =https://archive.org/details/inhabitantsofphi00sawy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief in ''anito'' is sometimes referred to as [[anitism]] in scholarly literature (Spanish: ''anitismo'' or ''anitería'').&lt;ref name="hislop"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephen K. Hislop|year=1971|title=Anitism: a survey of religious beliefs native to the Philippines |journal=Asian Studies|volume=9|issue=2|pages=144&amp;ndash;156|url=http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-09-02-1971/hislop-anitism-survey-religious%20beliefs-native-philippines.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deities and spirits ==
{{Main|Deities of Philippine mythology}}

=== Creator gods in Filipino religions ===
Many indigenous Filipino cultures assert the existence of a high god, creator god, or sky god.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991" /&gt;  Among the Tagalogs, the supreme god was known as [[Bathala]], who was additionally described as Maykapal (the all-powerful) or  Lumikha (the creator).  Among the Visayan peoples the creator God is referred to as [[Laon]], meaning "the ancient one."  Among the Manuvu, the highest god was called Manama.  Among most of the Cordilleran peoples (with the Apayao region as an exception), the creator and supreme teacher is known as [[Kabuniyan]].&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991" /&gt;

In most cases, however, these gods were considered such great beings that they were too distant for ordinary people to approach.&lt;ref name="Maggay1999"/&gt;  People thus tended to pay more attention to "lesser gods" or "assistant deities" who could more easily approached, and whose wills could more easily be influenced.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maggay1999"/&gt;

=== "Lower gods" in Filipino religions===
Lesser deities in Filipino religions generally fit into three broad categories: nature spirits residing in the environment, such as a mountain or a tree; guardian spirits in charge of specific aspects of daily life such as hunting or fishing; and deified ancestors or tribal heroes.  These categories frequently overlap, with individual deities falling into two or more categories, and in some instances, deities evolve from one role to another, as when a tribal hero known for fishing becomes a guardian spirit associated with hunting.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;

==Filipino folk healers==
{{Unreferenced section|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}
During the pre-Hispanic period, ''[[babaylan]]'', functioned as shamans and spiritual leaders and ''[[mananambal]]'' were for folk healers.  At the onset of the Colonial era, the suppression of the ''babaylans'' and the native Filipino religion gave rise to the ''[[albularyo]]''. By exchanging the native prayers and spells with Catholic ''oraciones'' and Christian prayers, the albularyo was able to synchronize the ancient mode of healing with the new religion.

''Albularyos'' employ herbs, [[alum]], coconut oil, etc., in their healing practices as well as various prayers, chants and "supernatural" cures—especially for cases involving supernatural causes. As time progressed, the ''albularyo'' became more prominent in rural areas in the Philippines. Lacking access to scientific medical practices, rural Filipinos trusted the ''albularyos'' to rid them of common (and sometimes believed to be supernatural) sicknesses and diseases.

However, the role of the ''albularyo'' was slowly overshadowed by the rise of modern medical facilities. Urbanization gave the masses access to more scientific treatments, exchanging the chants and herbs of the ''albularyos'' with the newer technologies offered by the medical field. Still, ''albularyos'' flourish in many rural areas in the Philippines where medical facilities are still expensive and sometimes inaccessible.

===Rituals===
Some of the rituals observed by Filipino Folk Healers include:
*''Pangalap'' - the aforementioned yearly search for concoction ingredients
*''Halad'' - ritual offering of food and drink to honor the spirits of the dead
*''Palínà'' - ritual fumigation; called ''tu-ob'' in the islands of [[Panay]] and [[Negros Island|Negros]]
*''Pangadlip'' - the chopping or slicing of ''pangalap'' ingredients 
*''Pagpagong'' - burning or reducing the ingredients into charcoal or ashes
*Making of ''Minasa'' - concoctions made from the ''pangalap'' ingredients 
*Rubbing with ''Lana'' - medicinal oil concocted from [[coconut]]

{{nihongo|'''''Infinite Undiscovery'''''|インフィニット アンディスカバリー|Infinitto Andisukabarī}} is an [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[tri-Ace]] and published by [[Square Enix]] for the [[Xbox 360]] in September 2008. It tells the story of the main character Capell and his journey to sever the chains that are holding the moon, with the help of the Liberation Force. The game received mixed to positive reviews from critics.

==Gameplay==
''Infinite Undiscovery'' is based on the player making real-time decisions that can affect the outcome of the story. These decisions can occur at any time, even while the player is going through inventory in the menu.

The player controls the main character, Capell, from a third-person perspective while three other characters are controlled by AI. The player fights battles with this team of four, or sometimes with multiple teams formed from a possible 18 characters. In battle, Capell has the ability to use connect actions, which give him access to other team members' skills.

The game was originally meant to transition between day and night every 10 minutes, giving the player different opportunities; for instance, stealth would be easier at night. However, this system was later removed. Director Hiroshi Ogawa explained that other forms of stealth remained in the game: “As an example, when you’re running away from a hunting dog, you can distract him by dropping apples from the trees. However, the guards may catch you when they hear the thud of the apples.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reyes |first=Francesca |url=http://oxmonline.com/article/features/infinite-possibilities?page=0%2C1 |title=Infinite Possibilities (Page 2) |publisher=''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' |date=April 28, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502174738/http://oxmonline.com/article/features/infinite-possibilities?page=0%2C1 |archivedate=May 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
''Infinite Undiscovery'' was announced in September 2006 by ''[[Famitsu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gantayat |first=Anoop |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/09/15/infinite-undiscovery-discovered |title=Infinite Undiscovery Discovered |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=September 15, 2006 |accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was believed that [[Microsoft Game Studios|Microsoft]] would publish the game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.microsoft.com/2006/09/20/microsoft-showcases-library-of-nearly-110-high-definition-xbox-360-games-at-the-tokyo-game-show/#sm.0000079k55s66sdo6vaf1ayzzq97d |title=Microsoft Showcases Library of Nearly 110 High-Definition Xbox 360 Games at the Tokyo Game Show |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=September 20, 2006 |accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but at [[Tokyo Game Show|TGS]] 2007, Hajime Kojima and Hiroshi Ogawa stated that Square Enix would take over publishing duties because they have more "know-how" with RPGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=GameSpot staff |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/tgs-07-infinite-undiscovery-qanda-session/1100-6179702/ |title=TGS '07: Infinite Undiscovery Q&amp;A Session |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=September 21, 2007 |accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Microsoft was the original publisher, it holds the trademark for the game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks/en-us.aspx |title=Microsoft Trademarks |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shares the copyright with Square Enix.&lt;ref name="iubox"&gt;{{cite video game |title=Infinite Undiscovery |developer=[[tri-Ace]] |publisher=Square Enix |date=September 2, 2008 |platform=Xbox 360 |quote=© 2008 SQUARE ENIX CO., LTD. / Microsoft Corporation. All Rights Reserved. Developed by tri-Ace Inc. (back of case for ''Infinite Undiscovery'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to tri-Ace co-founder and R&amp;D programmer Yoshiharu Gotanda, the game is set to contain 10 years' worth of ideas that can finally be realized with the Xbox 360, and with it, role-playing video games "will undergo a true evolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nolan |first=Richard |url=http://play.tm/story/18847 |title=Infinite Undiscovery - preview |publisher=Play.tm |date=June 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701112629/http://play.tm/story/18847 |archivedate=July 1, 2008 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tri-Ace wished to achieve this by putting the player through "situational battles" that would lead to "unknown discoveries" and cause permanent changes to the world.

The game was directed by Hiroshi Ogawa and produced by [[Hajime Kojima]], both of whom are also credited in the tri-Ace titles ''[[Star Ocean: Till the End of Time]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie Profile#Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth|Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth]]''. Tri-Ace president [[Yoshiharu Gotanda]] signed on as the game's lead programmer. Scenario was handled by ORG Ltd., including [[Ryo Mizuno]] and [[Shoji Gatoh]]. The game's characters were designed by Yukihiro Kajimoto.

The English dub was the first title released from [[New Generation Pictures]]'s Shanghai Studios. As such it features voice actors from Texas and Los Angeles, as well as a large helping of new talent from Shanghai.

Felix Vasquez from ''Cinema Crazed.com'' gave the film a mostly positive review, commending the film's strong performances, writing, "Jeffery Lando’s monster mash is firmly entrenched in the schlock arena, it’s a guiltless and shameless piece of exploitation that is so based around the sexy female cast, even the bugs want to strip them naked and mount them."&lt;ref name="vasquez11"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vasquez|first1=Felix|title=Insecticidal (2005)|url=http://cinema-crazed.com/blog/2011/02/03/insecticidal-2005/|website=Cinema Crazed.com|publisher=Felix Vasquez|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Popcorn Pictures'' awarded the film a score of 6/10, writing, "A guilty pleasure if there was one, Insecticidal is the silly tonic fans need to down after they’ve sat through the never-ending dreck that the Sci-Fi Channel has been churning out lately.

The inuksuk may have been used for navigation, as a point of reference, a marker for travel routes, fishing places, camps, hunting grounds, places of [[veneration]], [[drift fence]]s used in hunting,&lt;ref name=ReferenceA&gt;{{cite book |last=Gray |first=Charlotte |title=The Museum Called Canada, 25 Rooms of Wonder |date=2004 |publisher=Random House Canada |location=Toronto |isbn=978-0679312208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or to mark a [[Food storage|food cache]].&lt;ref name=sfu_aboriginal&gt;{{cite web |title=The Inuit Inukshuk |url=https://www.sfu.ca/aboriginalpeoples/inukshuk.html |publisher=Simon Fraser University |accessdate=1 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223083538/http://www.sfu.ca/aboriginalpeoples/inukshuk.html |archive-date=23 December 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iñupiat in northern Alaska used inuksuit to assist in the herding of [[Reindeer|caribou]] into contained areas for slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnobiology.org/conference/abstracts/pdfs/28th_abstracts.pdf 28 Ethnobiology Conference Abstracts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530011304/http://www.ethnobiology.org/conference/abstracts/pdfs/28th_abstracts.pdf |date=2008-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Varying in shape and size, the inuksuit have ancient roots in Inuit culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freespiritgallery.ca/inukshuk.htm The Inuit Inukshuk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the most common types of inuksuk are built with stone placed upon stone, and the simplest type of which is a single stone positioned in an upright manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/inuksuk-inukshuk/ Inuksuk]. The Canadian Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate as to whether the appearance of human- or cross-shaped cairns developed in the [[Inuit culture]] before the arrival of European [[missionary|missionaries]] and explorers.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The size of some inuksuit suggest that the construction was often a communal effort.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

At [[Inuksuk Point]] (Enukso Point) on [[Baffin Island]], there are over 100 inuksuit. The site was designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inuksuk National Historic Site of Canada |url=https://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=18947 |work=Canada's Historic Places - Inuksuk National Historic Site of Canada|publisher=Parks Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc.gc.ca/docs/r/system-reseau/sec6/sites-lieux74_e.asp National Historic Sites of Canada System Plan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529114414/http://www.pc.gc.ca/docs/r/system-reseau/sec6/sites-lieux74_e.asp |date=2006-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word {{lang|iu-Latn|inuksuk}} means "that which acts in the capacity of a human."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Tukiliit: An introduction to inuksuit and other stone figures of the North |last=Hallendy |first=Norman |publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre and University of Alaska Press |date=2009 |isbn=9781553654247 |location=Vancouver, British Columbia |pages=60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from the morphemes {{lang|iu-Latn|inuk}} ("person")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingdictionary.com/search/viewResults.jsp?resultsId=1446885870825ri Nunavut Living Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|iu-Latn|-suk}} ("[[wikt:ersatz|ersatz]], substitute"). It is pronounced {{lang|iu-Latn|inutsuk}} in [[Nunavik]] and the southern part of [[Baffin Island]] (see [[Inuit phonology]] for the linguistic reasons). In many of the central [[Nunavut]] dialects, it has the etymologically related name {{lang|iu-Latn|inuksugaq}} (plural: {{lang|iu-Latn|inuksugait}}).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

A structure similar to an inuksuk is called an {{lang|iu-Latn|inunnguaq}} ({{lang|iu|ᐃᓄᙳᐊᖅ}}, "imitation of a person", plural {{lang|iu-Latn|inunnguat}}); it is meant to represent a human figure. {{lang|iu-Latn|Inunnguaq}} has become widely familiar to non-Inuit, and particularly found in Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fitzhugh |first=William W. |date=2017-03-01 |title=Mongolian Deer Stones, European Menhirs, and Canadian Arctic Inuksuit: Collective Memory and the Function of Northern Monument Traditions |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-017-9328-0 |journal=Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=149–187 |doi=10.1007/s10816-017-9328-0 |issn=1072-5369 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not the most common type of inuksuk. It is distinguished from inuksuit in general.

Inuksuit continue to serve as an Inuit cultural symbol. An inuksuk is the centrepiece of the [[Flag of Nunavut|flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Nunavut|coat of arms]] of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian territory]] of Nunavut, and the [[flag of Nunatsiavut]]. The [[Inuksuk High School]] in [[Iqaluit]] is named after the landmark.

Inuksuit{{emdash}}particularly, but not exclusively, of the ''inunnguaq'' variety{{emdash}}are also increasingly serving as a mainstream Canadian [[national symbol]]. In 1999, Inukshuk was the name for the International Arctic Art &amp; Music Project of [[Arbos – Company for Music and Theatre|ARBOS]] in the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Nunavik, and Nunavut; and in Greenland, Austria, Denmark and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;''Inukshuk – The Arctic Art &amp; Music Project of ARBOS'', Edition Selene, Vienna, 1999. {{ISBN|3-85266-126-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, 2005, Canadian military personnel erected an inuksuk on [[Hans Island]], along with a plaque and a [[Flag of Canada|Canadian flag]], as part of Canada's longstanding dispute with Denmark over the small Arctic island.&lt;ref&gt;Press release from the Government of Canada, Foreign Affairs and International Trade. [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ZDN3uoDK-n0J:www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/canadaeuropa/Hans%2520Island%2520-%2520website.doc Google cache copy]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The markers have been erected throughout the country, including a {{convert|9|m|abbr=on}} inuksuk that stands in [[Toronto]] on the shores of [[Lake Ontario]].  Located in Battery Park, it commemorates the [[World Youth Day 2002]] festival that was held in the city in July 2002.

An ''inunnguaq'' is the basis of the logo of the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] designed by [[Vancouver]] artist Elena Rivera MacGregor. Its use in this context has been controversial among the Inuit, and the [[First Nations]] within [[British Columbia]]. Although the design has been questioned, people believe it pays tribute to Alvin Kanak's 1986  inuksuk at [[English Bay (Vancouver)|English Bay]]. Friendship and the welcoming of the world are the meanings of both the English Bay structure and the 2010 Winter Olympics emblem.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The Vancouver 2010 logo and the construction of inuksuit around the world have led to increasing recognition of them.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} There are five authentic inuksuit which were donated{{emdash}}wholly or in part{{emdash}}by the government of Canada: in [[Brisbane]], Australia; [[Monterrey]], Mexico; [[Oslo]], Norway; [[Washington, D.C.]], United States; and [[Guatemala City]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, Sarah. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071105041036/http://www.torontosun.com/News/Canada/2007/11/02/4624880-sun.html "Inuit art finds home in Mexico"], ''Toronto Sun'', 2 Nov 2007, Retrieved 2007-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent Canadian-donated inuksuk was built in Monterrey, Mexico, in October 2007 by the [[Inuvialuit]] artist [[Bill Nasogaluak]]. The sculpture was presented to the people of the northern state of [[Nuevo León]] as a gift from the Monterrey chapter of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Mexico and the Government of Canada, to mark the chamber's 10th anniversary in the city. The sculpture stands over the [[Santa Lucía Riverwalk]]. Nasogaluak, of [[Tuktoyaktuk]], personally chose the rocks for the structure from a local quarry near Monterrey. The inuksuk contains two rocks which the artist took to Mexico from Canada, one from the high Arctic and another from his home town of Toronto. Together they form the inuksuk's heart.

The inuksuk was also used as the symbol of the [[Summit of the Americas]], because of its connotations of "guidance and unity...towards common goals."&lt;ref&gt;[http://summit-americas.org/SIRG/XLVI%20SIRG/Acta_ENG%2010-16-06.DOC Proceedings of the XLVI Meeting of the Summit Implementation Review Group (SIRG)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials in various wilderness parks throughout Canada routinely dismantle inuksuit constructed by hikers and campers, for fear that they could misdirect park visitors from the cairns and other markers that indicate hiking trails. The practice of erecting inuksuit in parks has become so widespread that [[Killarney Provincial Park]], on the north shore of Ontario's [[Georgian Bay]], issued a notice in 2007 urging visitors to "stop the invasion" of inuksuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dubé |first=Rebecca |date=August 15, 2007 |title=Enough with the inukshuks already |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/enough-with-the-inukshuks-already/article1080258/ |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |location=Toronto }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of inuksuit have been built in some areas along the [[Trans-Canada Highway]], including [[Northern Ontario]]. In 2010, a journalist from [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]]'s ''[[Northern Life (newspaper)|Northern Life]]'' counted 93 inuksuit along [[Ontario Highway 69|Highway 69]] between Sudbury and [[Parry Sound, Ontario|Parry Sound]]. The journalist successfully tracked down a person who had built two inuksuit along the route; he attributed his action to having had a "fill the dreams moment where I needed to stop and do it" while driving home from a family funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Inukshukification of Highway 69 |url=http://www.northernlife.ca/news/lifestyle/2010/09/inukshuk230910.aspx |publisher=[[Northern Life (newspaper)#Northern Life|''Northern Life'']] |date=September 22, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030143846/http://www.northernlife.ca/news/lifestyle/2010/09/inukshuk230910.aspx |archivedate=October 30, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', the tallest inuksuk is in [[Schomberg, Ontario]], Canada. Built in 2007, it is {{convert|11.377|m}} tall.&lt;ref name=guinness&gt;{{cite web |title=Tallest Inukshuk |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/5000/tallest-inukshuk |publisher=Guinness World Records |accessdate=1 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] featured a lone inuksuk on the cover of their 1996 album ''[[Test for Echo]]''.

On the occasion of the 20th Anniversary of the [[Rome Statute]] and to mark Canada’s support for the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.gc.ca/court-cour/index.aspx?lang=eng ''Canada and the International Criminal Court'']&lt;/ref&gt; and as a symbol for its commitment to reconciliation with Canada’s [[First Nations]]{{citation needed|daate=November 2018|date=November 2018}}, Canadian Minister of Justice and Attorney General [[Jody Wilson-Raybould|Wilson-Raybould]] on 7 March 2018 handed over an Inukshuk as a gift to the ICC, which was revealed by her and ICC President Judge [[Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi]] at its premises in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diplomatmagazine.nl/2018/03/08/canada-justice-minister-icc-president-unveil-artwork-donation/ ''Canada Justice Minister and ICC President unveil artwork donation'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6733">The list below includes [[Women in Ancient Rome|Roman women]] who were notable for their family connections, or their sons or husbands, or their own actions.  In the earlier periods, women came to the attention of (later) historians either as poisoners of their husbands (a very few cases), or as wives, daughters, and mothers of great men such as Scipio Africanus.  In later periods, women exercised or tried to exercise political power either through their husbands (as did [[Fulvia]] and [[Livia Drusilla]]) or political intrigues (as did [[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Metellus)|Clodia]] and [[Servilia (mother of Marcus Junius Brutus)|Servilia]]), or directly (as did [[Agrippina the younger]] and later Roman empresses).

==Distinguished women of the Middle Republic==
* [[Aemilia Tertia]] (3rd century BC-2nd century BC), wife of [[Scipio Africanus Major]] and mother of [[Cornelia Africana]] (see below), noted for the unusual freedom given her by her husband, her enjoyment of luxuries, and her influence as role model for elite Roman women after the Second Punic War.  Her date of birth, marriage, and death are all unknown. Her husband's birth and death dates are also not known precisely, but approximated.
* [[Cornelia Africana]] (2nd century BC), virtually deified by Roman women as a model of feminine virtues and [[Stoicism]], but never officially deified.  The first Roman woman, whose approximate birth year and whose year of death is known, thanks to a law she had passed to allow her granddaughter to inherit.
* [[Licinia]], the name of the women of the gens Licinius. Notable members include
** Licinia, a woman killed by her relatives in 142 BC for murdering her husband;
* [[Murcia]], the name of the women of the gens Murcius.
** Licia, a woman killed by her relatives in 142 BC for murdering her husband.  Both Licinania and Murcia appealed for a trial, and before they could come to trial, they were tried by their relatives and executed.  This was a major scandal in the censorship of [[Lucius Mummius Achaius]] and [[Scipio Aemilianus]].
* [[Pomponia (mother of Scipio)]] (2nd century BC), daughter, niece, wife, and mother of consuls; born a plebeian noblewoman but married to a patrician. Mother of [[Scipio Africanus Major]] and [[Scipio Asiaticus]]. She was reportedly very religious and devout, but nothing else is known of her including the year of her marriage or death.
* [[Publilia]] (1st century BC), the name of a woman of the gens Publilius. She was killed in 154 BC for poisoning her husband, the consul of the preceding year.

==Distinguished women of the Julio-Claudian House==
* [[Agrippina the Elder]] (1st century), wife of [[Germanicus]], granddaughter of [[Augustus]], mother of emperor [[Caligula]] and [[Agrippina the Younger]] (below)
* [[Agrippina the Younger]] (1st century), niece and wife of emperor [[Claudius]], mother of emperor [[Nero]]; held up as a bad example.
* [[Aurelia Cotta]] (1st century BC), Mother of [[Julius Caesar]]
* [[Antonia Major]] (1st century BC), grandmother of Emperor [[Nero]]
* [[Antonia Minor]] (1st century BC-1st century AD), mother of Emperor [[Claudius]] and [[Germanicus]], favorite niece of [[Augustus Caesar]], considered a role model for women in the Roman Empire after she refused to remarry and spent the rest of her life raising her children and grandchildren.
* [[Atia Balba Caesonia]], mother of [[Augustus]] and [[Octavia Minor]]
* [[Claudia Julia]] (1st century),
* [[Claudia Pulchra (great-niece of Augustus)|Claudia Pulchra]], wife of [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]]
* [[Claudia Marcella]], nieces of [[Caesar Augustus]]
* [[Domitia Lepida the Elder]], aunt of Emperor [[Nero]]
* [[Domitia Lepida the Younger]], sister of the following, Mother of the Empress [[Valeria Messalina]]
* [[Domitia Longina]], wife of Emperor [[Domitian]]
* [[Domitia Lucilla]], mother of Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]
* [[Domitia Paulina]], [[Aelia Domitia Paulina]], [[Julia Serviana Paulina]], female relatives of Emperor [[Hadrian]]
* [[Julia the Elder]], daughter of Augustus
* [[Livia Drusilla]] (1st century BC), wife of Tiberius Claudius Nero, mother of the Emperor [[Tiberius]], and then wife of [[Augustus Caesar]]. The first woman to be officially deified.
* [[Livilla]] (1st century), granddaughter of Livia
* [[Marcia (gens)|Marcia]], sister of the consul [[Quintus Marcius Rex (consul 118 BC)|Quintus Marcius Rex]], wife of [[Gaius Julius Caesar II]], paternal grandmother of [[Julius Caesar]]
* [[Messalina]], Emperor [[Claudius]]' wife, notorious for her promiscuity.
* [[Octavia Minor]], sister of [[Caesar Augustus]] and fourth wife of [[Marcus Antonius]] (Mark Antony)
* [[Plautia Urgulanilla]], Emperor [[Claudius]]' first wife
* [[Scribonia]], second wife of [[Augustus]] and mother of his only legitimate child (whom she apparently ignored until her exile)
* [[Vipsania]], first wife of [[Tiberius]] and the only one he loved
* [[Vipsania Julia]], granddaughter of Augustus

==Distinguished women of the Western Roman Empire==
* [[Claudia Metrodora]] (1st century AD), Greco-Roman public benefactor, lived on [[Kos]]
* [[Lucilla]], (2nd century AD) Roman Empress, failed in her coup attempt on brother [[Commodus]]
* [[Aquilia Severa]] (3rd century), [[Vestal Virgin]] and wife of [[Elagabalus]]
* [[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Metellus)|Clodia]] (1st century BC), [[Catullus]]'s ''Lesbia''
* [[Domitia Decidiana]] - wife of Roman General [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] and mother-in-law to historian [[Tacitus]].
* [[Galla Placidia]], (5th century)
* [[Julia Avita Mamaea]] (3rd century AD), mother of emperor [[Alexander Severus]].
* [[Julia Domna]] (3rd century AD), wife of [[Septimius Severus]]
* [[Julia Maesa]] (3rd century), grandmother of [[Elagabalus]] and [[Alexander Severus]]
* [[Pomponia Graecina]], possibly the saint Lucina, a descendant of [[Vipsania]] (above)
* [[Saint Procula]] wife of [[Pontius Pilate]]
* [[Servilia (mother of Marcus Junius Brutus)|Servilia]], mother of [[Brutus]] and lover of [[Julius Caesar]]
* [[Ulpia Severina]] (3rd century AD), wife of emperor [[Aurelian]]. There's evidence to suppose that, after Aurelian's death, she ruled the Roman Empire for a short period of time, until the new emperor, [[Marcus Claudius Tacitus]] was chosen by the Senate. This is the only moment in the history of the Western Roman Empire when the ruler was a woman, several women would rule as Empress in their own right in the Eastern Roman Empire.

==Gameplay==
{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}
The player controls up to 4 units on the field at one time including the player's avatar and up to 90 total cost of units at one time.  When a unit dies it must be returned to the inactive area and after a set amount of time it can be used again.  Active units can only be switched in and out while the players units are in the gate area.  Players can damage enemy arcane crystals, the search eye, the crystal shield or gates by putting their units in the associated area as long as no enemies are present.  Players can also damage the arcane crystals by destroying all of the opponents units that are on the field.

==Story==
In ancient times, before the creation of the worlds, there lived a God. He opened his heart and brought forth a vermilion stone in order to create seven different worlds. Whosoever held the vermilion stone held the power to create worlds, and would reign over the seven worlds as a god, the "Lord of Vermilion". The seven worlds existed side by side in harmony for millennia, their inhabitants separated by boundaries and unable to interfere with one another... until the "Great Collapse".

The lord of the human world, consumed by ambition, sought to use the forbidden magic of the vermilion stone, called the "Arcana", in order to become a god. However, he was unable to wield the power and the Arcana was shattered into seven pieces and scattered amongst the seven worlds, destroying their boundaries. The six worlds were drawn into the human world and they merged. With the six races of the six worlds thrust into the human world, chaos and war broke out.

Ages later, the world, called the "Land of Acheron", is still in turmoil. The six "Lords" of the six races sow strife across the land, warring for each other's Arcana. The player takes the role of a legendary warrior who holds the seventh Arcana and seeks to obtain the Arcana and upset the balance of the world, gathering an army of "Familiars" who hold faith in the legend of the "Lord of Vermilion".

==Characters==
[[File:Lord of Vermilion videogame - Taito Station.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A gamer plays Lord of Vermilion video game on arcade. (Shibuya – Tokyo, Taito Station)]]

*'''Player Character''': The player character is one of the few humans to survive the Great Collapse, and can be customized by the player. A legendary warrior with mysterious origins, the player seeks to use the power of Arcana, "Miracle", to reshape the world and return harmony to the land, and as such gathers an army of faithful followers in order to wage war on the six "Lords" and become the "Lord of Vermilion". There are two characters which the player may select from: the male {{nihongo|Nido|ニド}}, or the female {{nihongo|Rishia|リシア}}. They each have similar backstories and roles within the story mode.
*'''Dux''': A mysterious knight completely clad in heavy armor, which completely conceals their identity and gender, who first appears in the tutorial and holds extensive knowledge on Arcana and the world. Dux is later revealed to be a former friend of the player's deceased father who agreed to watch over the player several years earlier.

{{nihongo|'''''Nanashi no Game'''''|ナナシ ノ ゲエム|Nanashi no Geemu|lit. "Nameless Game" or "The Game with No Name"}} is a  [[first person (video games)|first-person]] [[survival horror]] video game developed by Epics and published by [[Square Enix]] for the [[Nintendo DS]]. The game follows a university student who becomes cursed by the titular role-playing game, which causes people to die in seven days upon starting. It was released on July 3, 2008 in Japan.&lt;ref name=ign_a1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ds.ign.com/articles/869/869391p1.html|title=Square Enix Tries Survival Horror|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=beginnings&gt;{{cite web|author=Spencer|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/03/28/nanashi-no-game-was-considered-for-north-america-focus-groups-killed-it/|title=Nanashi No Game Was Considered For North America, Focus Groups Killed It|publisher=Siliconera|date=2011-03-28|accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sequel, titled ''Nanashi no Game: Me'', was later released on August 27, 2009 in Japan, followed by another sequel in 2012.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Nanashi no Game - Gameplay - Exploration.jpg|thumb|left|The 3D exploration mode in ''Nanashi no Game''. The player holds their DS sideways, so that the touch screen (the player character's forward facing direction) is on the right.]]

''Nanashi no Game'' involves two separate modes of play. Most of the game takes place in the real world, where the player navigates real-time 3D environments using the DS's D-Pad and Touch Screen. While exploring, the player must solve puzzles and reach locations. The player can switch to the TS Menu at any time, where they can play the cursed game, read e-mail messages, and load a previous save file. In many cases, an e-mail message or update to the cursed game will interrupt the player's exploration. In the cursed game, which only uses the top DS screen, the player controls a 2D [[History of video game consoles (third generation)|8-bit]] RPG that provides clues to the current situations and can, in some cases, advance the story.&lt;ref name=siliconera_surviving&gt;{{cite web|author=Spencer|title=Surviving Nanashi no Game’s cursed game|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2008/06/26/surviving-nanashi-no-games-cursed-game/|accessdate=23 May 2011|date=26 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partway into the game, the player will encounter {{nihongo|Regrets|ルグレ|Rugure}}, [[zombie]]-like spirits that roam the area in exploration mode. If a Regret comes into contact with the player, it is [[game over]].&lt;ref name=gspy_overview/&gt;&lt;ref name=nng_homepage/&gt; Regrets take several roles in the game, from standing guard at stationary posts to actively chasing (or attempting to scare) the player. In some situations, the cursed game provides clues for bypassing Regrets in a given situation.&lt;ref name=gspy_overview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/nanashi-no-game/|title=Nanashi no Game - Nintendo DS|work=[[GameSpy]]|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=2008-07-03|accessdate=2013-03-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513100221/http://ds.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/nanashi-no-game/|archivedate=2008-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nng_homepage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/774_2008/|title=ナナシ ノ ゲエム|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|work=Square-enix.co.jp|year=2008|accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{plot|date=June 2013}}
An [[urban legend]] has been circulating about a nameless, cursed [[role-playing video game]] for the fictional Twin Screen (TS) handheld game system. According to the rumor, anyone who plays this {{nihongo|"Cursed Game"|呪いのゲーム|Noroi no Game}} and does not complete it within seven days will die.

The player assumes the role of a college student at Nanto University, [[Tokyo]]. The player has started playing the cursed game, sent to them by classmate {{Nihongo|Fumihito Odaka|尾高 文人|Odaka Fumihito}}, who has been absent recently. {{Nihongo|Riko Nagasawa|長沢 理子|Nagasawa Riko}}, Odaka's girlfriend requests that the player go to Odaka's apartment. The player obliges, but makes a horrific discovery: Odaka has mysteriously died of [[drowning]], with his TS system in his hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Spencer |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2008/06/26/surviving-nanashi-no-games-cursed-game/|title=Surviving Nanashi no Game's cursed game|publisher=Siliconera|date=2008-06-26|accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite video game|title=Nanashi no Game|script-title=ja:ナナシ ノ ゲエム|developer=Epics|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|date=3 June 2008|platform=[[Nintendo DS]]|scene=|level=|language=Japanese|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player also discovers that Odaka hadn't sent the game to the player, as he was trying to stop it from "spreading and killing others". The next day, a distressed Riko dies on the Nanto Express subway, having received the cursed game six days before the protagonist.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

On the player's third day, Nanto University professor {{nihongo|Houki Ooyama|大山 法基|Ōyama Houki}} calls the player to his office. An IT expert on [[digital information]] with an interest in folklore, Ooyama confirms that a "killer curse" is a very real possibility, and sees the nameless game as an opportunity to conduct research on its mysteries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} He first directs the player to investigate {{nihongo|Jikyuu General Hospital|慈急総合病院|Jikyū Sōgō Byōin}}, the abandoned location of the cursed game's domain. Partway through, Ooyama has the player look for a medical chart for {{nihongo|Shin Yutani|湯谷 紳|Yutani Shin}}, a man who died in a similar fashion to Odaka. The player soon discovers that they are being pursued by spirits devoid of eyes or mouth, and discovers Riko as one of them. Riko's "spirit" appears after the player obtains Yutani's chart and receives a disturbing game update, and chases them out of the hospital.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

On the fourth day, Professor Ooyama and the player learn that Yutani was the president of a video game company called Uta-Soft, located on the fourth floor of the {{nihongo|[[Nakano, Tokyo|Nakano]] Broadway Center|中野ブロードウェイセンター}}; Ooyama directs the player there, warning them to avoid the spirits, which he dubs "Regrets", while exploring. Along the way, Ooyama sends the player information on Uta-Soft, including the fact that the company has gone [[bankrupt]], with most of its workers missing and presumed dead. At the abandoned office, the player collects various pieces of information, including a plan for the unnamed game and an employee roster, before escaping the Regrets.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

On the fifth day, Ooyama finds that only one person from Uta-Soft is still alive: {{nihongo|Ushio Ikuta|生田 潮|Ikuta Ushio}}, the creative director of the unnamed game. The player travels to the abandoned Ikuta residence, where they find a near-[[catatonic]] Ushio in the closet. Almost immediately after, a game update takes the player into a flashback of events inside the house. Yutani, constantly stressed from work and jealous of Ikuta's love for his family, brutally murdered his wife Tomoka while Ikuta was at work. Ikuta's daughter Asahi, who hated video games (as they kept Ikuta from spending time with the family), came home to find an indescribably bloody scene, with Yutani splattered in blood and grinning madly. Luckily, Asahi was able to escape the house before Yutani could catch her as well. After the vision ends, Ikuta utters Asahi's name, and gives the player her picture diary.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

On the sixth day, Ooyama explains to the player that after Tomoka's death, Ikuta continued to work on the cancelled game, angering Asahi into running away from home. From the information in the diary, Ooyama guesses that Asahi may have gone to the capeside {{nihongo|Misaki Hotel|ミサキホテル|Misaki Hoteru}}; he directs the player there, telling them he would meet them there later. When the player finds Asahi's body there, she communicates to the player through the game, asking why they came for her despite her attempts to kill them, before vanishing. The player leaves the hotel to meet with Ooyama, but is forced to flee upon making a shocking discovery: Ooyama has been turned into a Regret (most likely from freezing to death). Asahi again communicates to the player, declaring that her actions were to avenge her mother, and that she will never forgive her father, video games, or even the player. Later, a delayed e-mail message from Ooyama asks the player what the drawing in Odaka's apartment stood for. Realizing that it was the {{nihongo|Seven Capes [[Lighthouse]]|七支崎灯台|Nana Sasō saki tōdai}} located nearby, the player heads there.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

On the seventh and last day, the player arrives at the lighthouse. There, they learn that Asahi is the true source of the game's curse, having committed [[suicide]] by jumping from the top of the lighthouse. The player then heads for the nearby cliff (depicted many times in the cursed game) to reach Asahi before daybreak, in 3 minutes. Along the way, they must speak to the now-harmless spirits of the curse, in reverse chronological order, through the cursed game. Ooyama's spirit explains that he became a Regret because he wanted to see what would happen if one received the game, but never played it. Having received the game one day before the player, that makes Ooyama another victim. Ooyama explains that he now understands Ikuta's reason for working on the nameless game: to show that video games can be used to show someone how much they love them. After talking with Riko, Odaka, and the three missing Uta-Soft employees, the player speaks to Yutani, the curse's first victim. Acknowledging that he was the reason the curse began (by murdering Asahi's mother), Yutani tells the player to speak with Asahi and help her realize what she had in terms of family and love.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

When the player communicates to Asahi, they show her the happy memories that she and her family shared. Suddenly, Tomoka's spirit appears through the game, telling Asahi that she is sad that her daughter had died, and also closed her heart. When Tomoka mentions Ikuta directly, the player finds Ikuta standing next to them in the real world, having been led here by Tomoka's spirit. He explains his good intentions for creating the game, and apologizes to Asahi. In the game, Asahi responds, saying {{nihongo|"Papa!"|パパ！|lit. "Daddy!"}}; and the scene fades to white, before returning to the player, sitting at the cliff and very much alive. Ikuta, who notices the player, asks if they have met before; the player confirms this, before asking how the nameless game ends. Ikuta, taken aback by the player's interest, decides to complete the game's story to make amends to his family. Afterward, the game credits play, revealing the name of the nameless game: "Road to Sunrise"&lt;!-- {{nihongo| ||}}--&gt;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Endings===
The game has two different endings, depending on whether the player obtained all of the special items found in the nameless game. If the player obtains every single item, they will unlock the good ending; otherwise, they will receive the bad ending.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
*'''Good Ending''': after the nameless game fades to white, the player will see Asahi's spirit, now smiling with gratitude, before she passes on. The scene returns to the player, who bids her farewell, before Ikuta speaks to them. After the credits, the player receives a message from Asahi—"Thank you."—indicating that her curse has been broken.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
*'''Bad Ending''': after the nameless game fades to white, the scene skips directly to the player, who expresses relief that the nightmare is finally over, before Ikuta speaks to them. After the credits, an on-screen message will say "Transfer Complete", implying that the curse has instead transferred to someone else.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Development==

The game's soundtrack was composed by [[Masayoshi Soken]] under the pseudonym {{nihongo|"Luis Noma"|ルイーズ 野間|Ruīzu Noma}}, a name which in the game refers to the composer for the cursed game's soundtrack. On 7 July 2008, Square Enix released a five-track [[extended play|EP]] of music from ''Nanashi no Game'' titled {{nihongo|''Nanashi no Game Sound''|ナナシ ノ ゲエム 音|Nanashi no Geemu On}}.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

{{nihongo|'''''Nanashi no Game: Me'''''|ナナシ ノ ゲエム 目|Nanashi no Geemu Me|lit. "Nameless Game: Eye"}} is a [[survival horror]] [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo DS]], and the sequel to the original ''Nanashi no Game''. It was developed by Epics, published by [[Square Enix]], and released on August 27, 2009 in Japan.&lt;ref name=famitsu_a&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1224326_1124.html |title=『ナナシ ノ ゲエム』公式サイトに異変！？ - ファミ通.com |work=Famitsu.com |publisher=[[Famitsu]] |date=2009-05-22 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story follows an [[anthropology]] student from Nanto University, as he discovers two cursed games, an RPG and a [[platform game|platformer]].

Much like in the original, ''Nanashi no Game: Me'' involves two separate modes of play. Most of the game takes place in the real world, where the player navigates real-time 3D environments using the DS's D-Pad and Touch Screen. While exploring, the player must solve puzzles and reach locations. The player can switch to the TS Menu at any time, where they can play the cursed game, read e-mail messages, and load a previous save file. In many cases, an e-mail message or update to the cursed game will interrupt the player's exploration. In the cursed game, which only uses the top DS screen, the player controls a 2D [[History of video game consoles (third generation)|8-bit]] RPG that provides clues to the current situations and can, in some cases, advance the story.&lt;ref name="siliconera_surviving"/&gt; In ''Nanashi no Game: Me'', the player can now choose the locations they want to explore out of the two available for each day (for three days only). Each destination provides different experiences, including the Regrets the player will encounter.&lt;ref name=nngm_hmpg /&gt;

Two spin-off [[DSiWare]] titles, named {{nihongo|''Noroi no Game: Chi''|ノロイ ノ ゲエム 血|Noroi no Gēmu Chi|lit. "''Cursed Game: Blood''"}} and {{nihongo|''Noroi no Game: Oku''|ノロイ ノ ゲエム 獄|Noroi no Gēmu Oku|lit. "''Cursed Game: Prison''"}} respectively, have also been released on 9 September 2009.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Another sequel, {{nihongo|''Nanashi no Appli''|ナナシ ノ 或プリ|Nanashi no Apuri|lit. "''Nameless App''"}}, was released on 26 January 2012 for [[iOS]], and in February 2012 for [[Android (operating system)|Android]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=『ナナシ ノ 或プリ』あの『ナナシノゲエム』シリーズ最新作がiOSで配信　現実とリンクする恐怖を体感せよ！ - ファミ通App|url=http://app.famitsu.com/20120126_25674/|work=Famitsu.com|date=26 January 2012|accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/games/774-deaths-134044/iphone-131257|title=774 Deaths|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=IGN|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7262">[[File:Income consumption curve graph - upward sloping (normal goods).svg|alt=Graph of a normal good|frame|'''Example of a normal good:'''

As income increases from ''B1'' to ''B3'', the outward movement of utility curve ''I'' dictates that the quantity of good ''X&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'' increases in tandem. Therefore, ''X&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'' is a normal good. 
Put another way, the positively sloped income consumption curve demonstrates that ''X&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'' is normal. The [[Engel curve]] of ''X&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'' would also be positively sloped.
]]
In [[economics]], a '''normal good''' is any [[Good (economics)|good]] for which [[Demand (economics)|demand]] increases when income increases, i.e. with a positive [[income elasticity of demand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/economics-a-to-z|title=Economics A-Z terms beginning with N|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/normal-good.html|title=What is normal good? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==
A good is normal when the income elasticity of demand is greater than or equal to zero. In mathematical terms, good ''g'' is normal if and only if:

&lt;math&gt;\xi _g \geq 0, \text{ where } \xi _x = \frac{\Delta Q_x / Q_x}{\Delta Y / Y}&lt;/math&gt;

In the above definition, ''Q&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents the quantity of good ''x'' demanded and ''Y'' represents the income of the given consumer being modeled. Intuitively, a good is normal if a change in the consumer's income causes the same direction change in the consumer's demand for good ''x.''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/876140973|title=Microeconomics|last=M.,|first=Perloff, Jeffrey|isbn=9780133456912|edition=Seventh|location=Boston|oclc=876140973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of normal goods: [[necessity good]]s and [[luxury good]]s. A normal good is classified as a necessity good when ξ &lt; 1 (i.e. when an ''x''% change in income causes a change in x ''less than x%''), whereas a normal good is a luxury good when ξ &gt; 1 (i.e. when an ''x''% change in income causes a change in x ''greater than x%'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.econport.org/content/handbook/Elasticity/Income-Elasticity.html|title=Income Elasticity|last=|first=|date=2006|website=EconPort|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good where ξ &lt; 0 is an [[inferior good]].

According to economic theory, there must be at least one normal good in any given bundle of goods (i.e. not all goods can be inferior). Economic theory assumes that a [[Good (economics)|good]] provides always marginal utility (holding everything else equal). Therefore, if consumption of all goods decrease when income increases, the resulting consumption combination would fall short of the new budget constraint frontier.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This would violate the economic rationality assumption.

When the price of a normal good is zero, the demand is infinite.

A caveat to the table above is that not all goods are strictly normal or inferior across all income levels. For example, average used cars could have a positive income elasticity of demand at low income levels - extra income could be funneled into replacing public transportation with self-commuting. However, the income elasticity of demand of average used cars could turn negative at higher income levels, where the consumer may elect to purchase new and/or luxury cars instead.

Another potential caveat is brought up by "The Notion of Inferior Good in the Public Economy" by Professor Jurion of University of Liège (published 1978). [[Public good]]s such as online news are often considered inferior goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chyi|first=Hsiang Iris|date=Autumn 2009|title=Is Online News an Inferior Good? Examining the Economic Nature of Online News among Users|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/107769900908600309|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly|volume=86|pages=592–612|via=Sage Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the conventional distinction between inferior and normal goods may be blurry for public goods. (At least, for goods that are non-[[Rival good|rival]] enough that they are conventionally understood as "public goods.") Consumption of many public goods will decrease when a rational consumer's income rises, due to replacement by private goods, e.g. building a private garden to replace use of public parks. But when effective congestion costs to a consumer rises with the consumer's income, even a normal good with a low income elasticity of demand (independent of the congestion costs associated with the non-[[Excludable good|excludable]] nature of the good) will exhibit the same effect. This makes it difficult to distinguish inferior public goods from normal ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jurion|first=B.J.|date=January 3, 1978|title=The Notion of Inferior Good in Public Economy|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8292.1978.tb01763.x/abstract|journal=Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics|volume=49|pages=|via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Statue of Sekhemka.jpg|thumb|Statue of Sekhemka]]
The '''Northampton Sekhemka statue''' is an [[Ancient Egyptian]] artefact, given by the [[Marquess of Northampton]] to [[Northampton Museum]], in or about 1870. The statue dates from the [[5th dynasty]] (c. 2494–2345 BC, making it slightly older than [[Stonehenge]]) and depicts Sekhemka the scribe with his wife, Sitmerit. It was the subject of a controversial sale in July 2014, that raised questions of the museum's ownership and the [[Deaccessioning (museum)|ethics of selling artefacts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/news/11072014-ma-condemns-sale-sekhemka#.U8U4TPnIbck | title=MA Condemns Sale of Sekhemka Statue | publisher=11 July 2014 | date=11 July 2014 |author=Heal, Sharon | accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was sold to an unidentified buyer for £15.76m, which broke the world record for Ancient Egyptian art at auction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Museum faces outcry over sale of ancient Egyptian statue", ''Financial Times'' (London), 11 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August 2014, Northampton Museums had their accreditation removed by [[Arts Council England]], which ruled that the sale did not meet the accredited standards for museums in managing their collections.&lt;ref name="losesaccreditationbbc"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-28602849 | title=Sekhemka statue: Northampton Museum loses Art Council accreditation | publisher=BBC News | date=1 August 2014 | accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The statue depicts Sekhemka sitting in a traditional scribal pose and holding on his knees a partly unrolled papyrus which lists various offerings. He is named in an inscription on the plinth of his statue as "Inspector of Scribes in the House of Largesse, one revered before the Great God". His wife Sit-Merit is shown sitting at his feet. The limestone statue is {{conv|75|cm|in}} tall with the base from front to rear being {{conv|43|cm|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ahram Weekly Issue 1205, T. G. H. James, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist [[Mike Pitts (archaeologist)|Mike Pitts]], editor of ''British Archaeology'', took many detailed colour photographs of the statue whilst it was on display in [[Christie's]] prior to auction and has published them on his own blog.&lt;ref name="archaeologyuk.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Six Things About Sekhemka|author= Mike Pitts|url=http://www.archaeologyuk.org/cba/staff/mikepitts|accessdate=1 December 2015}}{{cite web|url=http://mikepitts.wordpress.com/2014/07/13/six-things-about-sekhemka/|title=DIGGING DEEPER|date= 13 July 2014|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provenance ==
[[File:A Victorian Journey.jpg|thumb|Display case from "Ancient Egypt: The Northampton Collection" 1987]]
The statue's provenance is unclear. ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]'' reports that one account describes the statue as being acquired by Northampton Museum in 1849 from the Ottoman sultan, while another version holds that it was acquired by the [[Spencer Compton, 2nd Marquess of Northampton|2nd Marquess of Northampton]] during a trip to Egypt, after which his son offered it to Northampton Museum in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Al-Ahram Weekly Issue 1205"&gt;Al-Ahram Weekly Issue 1205&lt;/ref&gt; [[T. G. H. James]] noted in 1961 that Northampton Museum held no precise information regarding the acquisition of the statue, but that it was presented to the museum around 1870 by the [[Charles Compton, 3rd Marquess of Northampton|3rd Marquess of Northampton]] and, based on a record from 1899, it is likely to have been acquired by the 2nd Marquess during a trip to Egypt in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;The Northampton Statue of Sekhemka, T. G. H. James, ''Journal of Egyptian Archaeology'', Vol. 49, (Dec. 1963), pp. 5-12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial sale==
Northampton Borough Council claimed that they learned the full value of the Sekhemka statue in 2012 during an insurance assessment, and according to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' it "immediately began making plans to cash it in and use the money for other heritage projects in the region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cross |first1=Charlotte |title=Lord Northampton fights council over £2m Egyptian statue |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/10077157/Lord-Northampton-fights-council-over-2m-Egyptian-statue.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then leader of Northampton Borough Council, [[David Mackintosh (politician)|David Mackintosh]], told the BBC that the statue had "been in our ownership for over 100 years and it's never really been the centrepiece of our collection", and that "We want to expand our museum and to do that we need to raise the money".&lt;ref name="The Guardian, 10 July 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnston |first1=Chris |title=Northampton borough council sells Egyptian statue for almost £16m |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/10/northampton-borough-council-sells-egyptian-statue-sekhemka |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council proposed to use the amount realized through a sale for funding “the restoration of [[Delapre Abbey]], improvements to the museum service and/or other cultural or heritage projects” but the Museum Association asked that proposed sale be halted pending consultation which "was needed to establish the financially motivated disposal was 'last resort'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/news/25092012-museums-association-ethics-committee-advises-northampton-borough-council-hold-off-sale-2-million-pound-monument#.U8UuXfnIbcl|title=Ethics Committee advises Northampton to hold off sale of £2m monument - Museums Association|work=museumsassociation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security concerns ===
The council stated that when the statue was valued in 2010 it was taken off display because of security concerns, and that it would have required 24-hour guarding.&lt;ref&gt;''Northampton Chronicle and Echo'', 18 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, Axa Art Insurance Ltd subsequently reported that the cabinet display previously used in Northampton Museum was "adequate".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;,{{cite news |title=SPECIAL REPORT: Should Northampton’s Sekhemka statue be sold off? |url=http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/local/special-report-should-northampton-s-sekhemka-statue-be-sold-off-1-6128571 |work=Northampton Chronicle and Echo |date=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council were also asked "why, when the Friends of Northampton Museum and Art Gallery offered £8,000 to buy a new cabinet, was the offer not taken up?" but did not reply to this specific question.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Public consultation===
In October 2012, the council published the results of a petition that was signed by 199 (average of all petitions 193 as of July 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northamptonboroughcouncil.com/councillors/mgEPetitionListDisplay.aspx?XXR=0&amp;VM=2&amp;DR=19/06/2001%20-%2017/07/2014&amp;ACT=Go|title=Northampton Borough Council - Active and Completed ePetitions|work=northamptonboroughcouncil.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;):
:We the undersigned petition the council to Reconsider the proposed sale of Sekhemka in view of the comments below it is believed that the proposed sale will have a profound detrimental effect on Northampton Museums, is against the intentions of the original Donors, will possibly cause the Museums to lose both Accredited and Designated Status and this lose access to significant public funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northamptonboroughcouncil.com/councillors/mgEPetitionDisplay.aspx?ID=27&amp;RPID=11994184&amp;HPID=11994184|title=Northampton Borough Council - ePetition - Proposed sale of Sekhemka|work=northamptonboroughcouncil.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Northampton Borough Council claimed in January 2013 to have sought the views of the public regarding the proposed sale of the statue, but the form this took was criticised by the Museum Associations ethics committee:&lt;ref&gt;"Consultation into Sale of Statue Provokes Criticism", Patrick Steel, Issue 112/12, P. 7, 1 December 2012 [http://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/01122012-consultation-into-sale-provokes-criticism#.U8PcnPnIbck]&lt;/ref&gt;
:"In particular, the questionnaire just asks respondents to tick which area of investment the sale proceeds should go to. It does not ask people whether the sale should go ahead, and does not "acknowledge the historical importance of the object to the museum".

Nevertheless, the BBC repeated the council's claim that the consultation indicated that of the 173 replies 51% were in favour and 49% were against the sale.&lt;ref name="BBC News, 11 July 2014"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lord Northampton to get £6m from Egyptian Sekhemka sale|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-28260067|work=BBC News|date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; No question in the consultation document asked whether the statue should be sold or not; however, those who participated in the consultation could leave optional narrative comments, and the council used these to claim a small majority in favour of selling the statue.&lt;ref&gt;"Results of Consultation on the proposed sale of an Egyptian funerary monument of Sekhemka", Northampton Burgh Council, 17 January 2013 [http://www.northampton.gov.uk/downloads/file/5615/results_of_consultation_on_the_proposed_sale_of_an_egyptian_funerary_monument_of_sekhemka]&lt;/ref&gt; The Save Sekhemka Action Group objected to the methods used in the consultation document:
:In order to get a better picture of the public’s opinion the Action Group hereby launches its OWN survey; it does take NBC’s views into account but also offers an opportunity for sensible and detailed answers.&lt;ref&gt;"Action Group Launches Own Survey on Proposed Sale of Sekhemka", The Save Sekhemka Action Group, 14 November 2012 [http://sekhemka.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/action-group-launches-own-survey-on.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Save Sekhemka Action Group reported that their own survey showed "overwhelming support for protecting the museum's accredited status and keeping the statue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sekhemka.blogspot.co.uk/2012_12_01_archive.html|title=Save Sekhemka Action Group|author=Phil Cotter|work=sekhemka.blogspot.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Northampton Chronicle and Echo'' carried out a Facebook poll in June 2014, and found that the majority wanted to keep the statue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;''Northampton Chronicle and Echo'', 19 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Private deal between Council and Lord Northampton===
The present [[Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton|Lord Northampton]] originally protested at the decision of Northampton Borough Council to sell the statue. However, the BBC reported that, following negotiations lasting a year, he struck a private deal with the council which resulted in him receiving £6 million from the sale. Northampton Borough Council has refused to release details of the legal arrangement.&lt;ref name="BBC News, 11 July 2014"/&gt; The Marquess had previously been involved with the controversial attempted sale of the [[Sevso Treasure]].&lt;ref name="archaeologyuk.org"/&gt;

In June 2014, the council was asked by a local newspaper: "Are you prepared to show the documents and agreements made with the Marquess of Northampton to any member of the public who asks to see them? If not, why not?" and replied "The details of the agreement are confidential between Lord Northampton and the borough council, but we can confirm that 55% of the sale will go to the council and 45% will go to Lord Northampton."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The council also stated "The council’s ownership of Sekhemka has been confirmed following advice from lawyers, who are satisfied we have legal right to proceed with the sale. We do not have any deed specifically relating to Sekhemka."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; After the sale of the statue The Save Sekhemka Action Group questioned why the Marquess of Northampton would be receiving over £5 million from the proceeds since, according to Northampton Borough Council, the council owned the statue.&lt;ref name="sekhemka.blogspot.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sekhemka.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/Statement.html|title=Save Sekhemka Action Group|work=sekhemka.blogspot.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protests===
The Egyptian [[Supreme Council of Antiquities|Ministry of Antiquities]] asked the Egyptian Embassy in London to take all legal procedures to stop the sale of the statue. Minister Mamdouh Al-Damati condemned the sale as being incompatible with the values and role of museums worldwide which should spread culture rather than seeking to earn money.&lt;ref name="Al-Ahram Weekly Issue 1205"/&gt; He also called on the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM) to stop the sale on ethical grounds. The Museum Association for the United Kingdom warned the council that it would review Northampton’s membership if it went ahead with the sale.&lt;ref name="Al-Ahram Weekly Issue 1205"/&gt; The [[Arts Council of England]] said the sale could jeopardise the accreditation status of Northampton Museums and that could in future limit the museum's ability to obtain grant funding.&lt;ref name="Al-Ahram Weekly Issue 1205"/&gt; Archaeologist Andy Brockman, who took part in the Save Sekhemka campaign said the sale would "bring Northampton Council into disrepute" and that the sale was "opposed by museum and archaeological professionals who wish to make sure no part of Egypt's cultural history is sold off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sale of Sekhemka statue at Christie's – ICOM CIPEG expresses concern |url=http://www.heritagedaily.com/2014/07/sale-of-sekhemka-statue-at-christies-icom-cipeg-expresses-concern/104104 |work=Heritage Daily |date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The sale of artefacts to pay institutional expenses is strictly against the ethical codes of national and international heritage bodies... CIPEG is concerned that, as a consequence, a well-known masterpiece of Egyptian art may disappear into a private collection, making it inaccessible to the general public, students, and scholars. CIPEG urges the Northampton Borough Council to abandon the sale of the statue of Sekhemka, and thereby to set an example of ethical behaviour on the part of a public institution which acts as custodian for objects of world cultural importance.&lt;ref&gt;"''Statement from CIPEG, the International Committee for Egyptology in the International Council of Museums on the sale of the statue of Sekhemka''",cipEG, 9 July 2014 [http://icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/News/CIPEG-statement_final.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

ICOM CIPEG also expressed concern that the sale might encourage illegal excavation and plundering of Ancient Egyptian antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egyptian Sekhemka Statue Achieves £15m In Northampton Museum Sell Off At Christie's|url=http://www.artlyst.com/articles/egyptian-sekhemka-statue-achieves-15m-in-northampton-museum-sell-off-at-christies?_source=rss|work=artlyst|date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "The Curse of Sekhemka"===
{{see also|Curse of the Pharaohs}}
In July 2013, a local politician who opposed the sale of the statue commented: "I've read there is a curse attached to Sekhemka and if it should fall on anyone, it should fall on this administration for not having the courage to change their minds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Northampton Borough Council 'should be cursed' for statue sale |url=http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/politics/northampton-borough-council-should-be-cursed-for-statue-sale-1-5295007 |work=Northampton Chronicle and Echo |date=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the sale was scheduled to take place the estate office of the Marquess of Northampton's [[Castle Ashby]] caught fire leading to stories about the "Curse Of Sekhemka".&lt;ref name="heritagedailycurse"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heritagedaily.com/2014/07/the-curse-of-sekjemka-strikes-northampton-as-alan-moore-condemns-15-million-sale-of-statue/104116 | title=The curse of Sekjemka strikes Northampton as Alan Moore condemns £15 million sale of statue | work=Heritage Daily | date=11 July 2014 | accessdate=2 May 2015 | author=Brockman, Andy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire crews from three counties fought the blaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Huge fire severely damages building at historic Castle Ashby House in Northamptonshire |url=http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/top-stories/video-huge-fire-severely-damages-building-at-historic-castle-ashby-house-in-northamptonshire-1-6168780 |work=Northamptonshire Telegraph |date=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auction ===
[[Christie's]] sold the Sekhemka statue for £15.76 m at an auction on 10 July 2014 to an anonymous buyer.&lt;ref name="BBC News, 11 July 2014"/&gt; The auction was briefly halted by a protester who called out that “no-one should bid or buy it...stolen property,” while a small, vocal group of Egyptian protesters demonstrated outside.&lt;ref name="heritagedailycurse" /&gt; The final auction price was almost £10 m more than Christie's guide price.&lt;ref name="The Guardian, 10 July 2014"/&gt; The price obtained broke the existing world record for an Ancient Egyptian artwork sold at auction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Reaction to sale===
The Save Sekhemka Action group described the sale as a "day of shame for Northampton", and said that selling the statue had been "the decision of one man [council leader David Mackintosh], taken against all professional advice locally, nationally and internationally"&lt;ref name="sekhemka.blogspot.co.uk"/&gt; The sale was described by the Egyptian Embassy as a "shameful and unethical act".&lt;ref name="BBC News, 11 July 2014"/&gt; Scott Furlong, of Arts Council England, said: "It is very disappointing that the local authority committed to the sale and entered into an agreement with an auction house before our discussions with them were concluded."&lt;ref name="BBC News, 11 July 2014"/&gt; Northampton council leader David Mackintosh said the council's share of the proceeds would be used to develop the existing museum.&lt;ref name="BBC News, 11 July 2014"/&gt; The writer [[Alan Moore]] also condemned the council's decision to sell the statue.&lt;ref name="The Guardian, 10 July 2014"/&gt;
[[The Art Fund]] commented the day after the sale:
:The Art Fund supports careful collections management, which includes responsible deaccessioning, ideally with an item being freely transferred to another body so it can remain on public display. However, in line with the Museum Association’s Code of Ethics for museums, we remain strongly opposed to deaccessioning any item for financial reasons except in exceptional circumstances, where the funds will directly benefit the museum collection and only after all other options have been explored.
: This is not the case with the sale of Sekhemka and as such, having gone against the sector's ethical guidance, it risks being stripped of its accredited status. This is therefore a financially as well as morally harmful decision for Northampton Borough Council to take. Not only will they receive only 55% of the final hammer price of £15.8m, but Northampton Museum and Art Gallery will no longer be eligible to apply to us and other major funders for funding for acquisitions, capital projects (including the planned £14m extension), and artistic or educational programming.&lt;ref&gt;"Statement about the Egyptian statue of Sekhemka", The Art Council, 11 July 2014 [http://www.artfund.org/news/2014/07/11/statement-about-the-egyptian-statue-of-sekhemka]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Arts Council]] announced that Northampton Museums' accreditation would be reviewed on 24 July 2014:
: We are saddened to hear that Northampton Borough Council has now sold Sekhemka, the Egyptian statue, from its public museum collection. It is very disappointing that the local authority committed to the sale and entered into an agreement with an auction house before our discussions with them were concluded...Those who choose to approach the sale of collections cynically or with little regard for the sectoral standards or their long-term responsibilities will only further alienate both key funders and the public who put their trust in them to care for our shared inheritance. It is of great importance that the public retain trust in museums to look after the collections held in their name. We are concerned that this trust may be undermined if disposals from public collections are seen to be driven by financial considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.northampton-news-hp.co.uk/News/Northampton-News/Arts-Council-announces-date-for-review-of-Northampton-Museums-accreditation-after-sale-of-Sekhemka-statue-for-15m-20140714183552.htm#ixzz37Y4YTUxz|title=Arts Council Announces Date For Review of Northampton Museums Accreditation|work=Northampton Herald and Post|date=14 July 2014|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Museum loses accreditation ===
[[File:Northampton Museum front.jpg|thumb|Northampton Museum]]
On 1 August 2014, Northampton Museums had their accreditation removed by the Arts Council England, who ruled that the sale broke the required standards for museums managing their collections, rendering the museums ineligible for funding from a range of arts grants and funding bodies. The museums are excluded from future participation until at least August 2019.&lt;ref name="losesaccreditationbbc" /&gt; Scott Furlong of the Arts Council commented: "It is always hugely regrettable when we have to exclude a museum from the Accreditation Scheme. However, it is equally important that we are robust in upholding the standards and principles which underpin the scheme and are shared by the vast majority of museums."&lt;ref name="losesaccreditationbbc" /&gt; The leader of Northampton borough council, David Mackintosh said the Arts Council decision was "disappointing" and "puzzling", and stated "We are possibly one of the only local authorities in the country with plans for a multimillion pound investment in their museum service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arts Council strips Northampton Museum of accreditation |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9f4763b0-197e-11e4-8730-00144feabdc0.html#axzz39A9JQg6e |work=Financial Times |author=Pickford, James |date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Save Sekhemka Action Group commented "This is indeed a black and shameful day for Northampton's Culture and Heritage" and that "it will mean the certain decline of both the Central and [[Abington Park#Abington Park Museum|Abington Museum]] since the loss of this statue stops the Museum Service being eligible for outside grants from the Lottery, Arts Council England and other art/cultural grant giving bodies." They said that the monetary loss through loss of accreditation is likely to be in excess of the £8m gross the council received from the sale of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Northampton Museum loses Accreditation due to Sekhemka sale |url=http://sekhemka.blogspot.co.uk/ |work=Save Sekhemka Action Group |date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, the Borough Council's bid for a [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] grant of £240,400 was rejected. The funding was being sought for an exhibition of designer shoes dating from the 19th century to the present. The council said it was "disappointed". The [[Museums Association]] decided to ban the council from membership for five years.&lt;ref name  = "BBC4Nov14"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-29903549 |title=Sekhemka statue: HLF rejects Northampton Council grant bid |date=4 November 2014 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Friends of Museums winds itself up ===
In September 2014, the Friends of Northampton Museums and Art Gallery decided to wind itself up after 55 years' financial and practical service to the town. The sale of the statue was partly to blame for this; the group was against the sale, though some felt it did not fall within the group's functions.&lt;ref name ="NCE 250914"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/local/friends-group-that-fought-northampton-borough-council-sekhemka-sale-disbands-1-6309572|title=Friends group that fought Northampton Borough Council Sekhemka sale disbands|archivedate=2 December 2014|accessdate=2 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202192254/http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/local/friends-group-that-fought-northampton-borough-council-sekhemka-sale-disbands-1-6309572|newspaper=Northampton Chronicle &amp; Echo|date=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Export licence refused ===
On 30 March 2015, British culture minister [[Ed Vaizey]] placed a four-month temporary export ban on the statue, which had been sold to an unidentified overseas buyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/30/export-block-on-ancient-egyptian-statue-sold-by-northampton-council|title=Export bar on ancient Egyptian treasure sold by Northampton council|author=Caroline Davies|date=30 March 2015|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arts Council said there was a chance the statue could be sold to a UK buyer if "a serious intention to raise funds to purchase the statue is made at the recommended price of £15,732,600 plus [[Value added tax|VAT]]."&lt;ref name = "exportban"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-32117427|title=Export ban on £15m Egyptian Sekhemka statue sold by Northampton council|date=30 March 2015|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian Ambassador Ahsraf Elkholy condemned the sale as "an abuse to the Egyptian archaeology and the cultural property," saying that the statue should have been given back to Egypt if the council no longer wanted it.&lt;ref name = "exportban" /&gt;

On 2 October 2015, Vaizey extended the export ban until 29 March 2016, after hearing of a serious bid to raise funds to save the statue for the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-34428993|title=Serious intention to raise funds to save Sekhemka Egyptian statue|work=BBC News|date=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since no-one made a counter-offer during this extension, in April 2016 the ban was lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/ancient-egyptian-sekhemka-statue-sold-by-northampton-museum-to-leave-the-country-after-no-a6968621.html|title=Ancient Egyptian statue sold by Northampton museum to leave the country after no alternative buyers come forward|work=Independent|date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Group claims sale may have been illegal ===
On 21 April 2015 the Save Sekhemka Action Group said that they think that a condition of the original Deed of Gift was that the statue should never be sold, making the auction illegal. The group said that they had no intention of trying to buy the statue back but suggest that it is put on display at a major museum. It is also challenging the £6m donation from the sale proceeds to the Marquess of Northampton's family. It will also examine borough council records to determine "the legal and financial arrangements reached with the Marquis of Northampton".&lt;ref name ="BBC 21-4-2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-32399404|title=Sekhemka action group to probe Northampton statue sale|date=21 April 2015|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC reported in October 2016 that the statue now is thought to have been exported to the United States. BBC news revealed how the council, which made £8m from the sale, had been warned by lawyers not to sell it for "financial motives".
The council said it sold the figurine to help fund a £14m extension to its museum and art gallery.&lt;ref name ="BBC 15-10-2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-37552316|title=Sekhemka reported to be in USA|date=15 October 2016|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Wright of Derby The Alchemist.jpg|thumb|''[[The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus|The Alchymist, in Search of the Philosopher's Stone]]'' by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]], 1771.]]

The '''philosopher's stone''', or '''stone of the philosophers''' ({{lang-la|lapis philosophorum}}) is a legendary [[alchemy|alchemical]] substance capable of turning [[base metal]]s such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] into [[gold]] ({{Lang|grc-Latn|[[chrysopoeia]]}}, from the Greek χρυσός ''khrusos'', "gold", and ποιεῖν ''poiēin'', "to make") or silver. It is also called the [[elixir of life]], useful for [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] and for achieving [[immortality]]; for many centuries, it was the most sought goal in [[alchemy]]. The philosopher's stone was the central symbol of the mystical terminology of alchemy, symbolizing perfection at its finest, [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], and heavenly bliss. Efforts to discover the philosopher's stone were known as the [[Magnum opus (alchemy)|Magnum Opus]] ("Great Work").&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Heindel|Heindel, Max]], ''[http://www.rosicrucian.com/frc/frceng01.htm Freemasonry and Catholicism]'', {{ISBN|0-911274-04-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Ancient Greece===
Mention of the philosopher's stone in writing can be found as far back as ''Cheirokmeta'' by [[Zosimos of Panopolis]] (c. 300 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Ede, Lesley B. Cormack. ''A History of Science in Society: from philosophy to utility.'' University of Toronto Press. p .66&lt;/ref&gt; Alchemical writers assign a longer history. [[Elias Ashmole]] and the anonymous author of ''Gloria Mundi'' (1620) claim that its history goes back to [[Adam]] who acquired the knowledge of the stone directly from God. This knowledge was said to be passed down through biblical patriarchs, giving them their longevity. The legend of the stone was also compared to the biblical history of the [[Temple of Solomon]] and the rejected cornerstone described in [[Psalm 118]].&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Patai. ''The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book'' Princeton University Press, 1995. p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical roots outlining the stone’s creation can be traced to Greek philosophy. Alchemists later used the [[classical element]]s, the concept of [[anima mundi]], and Creation stories presented in texts like Plato's [[Timaeus (dialogue)|''Timaeus'']] as analogies for their process.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton J. Linden. ''The alchemy reader: from Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton'' Cambridge University Press. 2003. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Plato, the four elements are derived from a common source or [[prima materia]] (first matter), associated with [[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]. ''Prima materia'' is also the name alchemists assign to the starting ingredient for the creation of the philosopher's stone. The importance of this philosophical first matter persisted throughout the history of alchemy. In the seventeenth century, [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] writes, "the first matter of the stone is the very same with the first matter of all things".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Haeffner. Dictionary of Alchemy: From Maria Prophetessa to Isaac Newton. Karnac Books, 2004. p.211&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
Early medieval alchemists built upon the work of Zosimos in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the Arab empires. Byzantine and Arab alchemists were fascinated by the concept of metal transmutation and attempted to carry out the process.&lt;ref name="Strohmaier"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Umara ibn Hamza, Constantine V, and the invention of the elixir|page=147-150|last1=Strohmaier|first1=Gotthard|title=Hellas im Islam: Interdisziplinare Studien zur Ikonographie, Wissenschaft und Religionsgeschichte|year=2003|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=9783447046374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 8th-century [[Muslim]] alchemist [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]] ([[Latin]]ized as ''Geber'') analyzed each classical element in terms of the four basic qualities. Fire was both hot and dry, earth cold and dry, water cold and moist, and air hot and moist. He theorized that every metal was a combination of these four principles, two of them interior and two exterior. From this premise, it was reasoned that the transmutation of one metal into another could be affected by the rearrangement of its basic qualities. This change would be mediated by a substance, which came to be called ''xerion'' in Greek and ''al-iksir'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (from which the word ''[[elixir]]'' is derived). It was often considered to exist as a dry red powder (also known as ''al-kibrit al-ahmar'', red sulfur) made from a legendary stone—the philosopher's stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Philosopher's Stone: Alchemy and Chemistry|first=Jehane|last=Ragai|journal=Journal of Comparative Poetics|volume=12|issue=Metaphor and Allegory in the Middle Ages|year=1992|pages=58–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Maslama al-Majriti and the Rutbatu'l-Hakim|first=E. J.|last=Holmyard|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|volume=6|issue=3|year=1924|pages=293–305|doi=10.1086/358238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elixir powder came to be regarded as a crucial component of transmutation by later Arab alchemists.&lt;ref name="Strohmaier" /&gt;

In the 11th century, there was a debate among [[Muslim world]] chemists on whether the transmutation of substances was possible. A leading opponent was the Persian polymath [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina), who discredited the theory of transmutation of substances, stating, "Those of the chemical craft know well that no change can be effected in the different species of substances, though they can produce the appearance of such change."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Briffault]] (1938). ''The Making of Humanity'', p. 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, the 13th-century scientist and philosopher [[Albertus Magnus]] is said to have discovered the philosopher's stone. Magnus does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings, but he did record that he witnessed the creation of gold by "transmutation".&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn and Frederick E. Budd. ''A Survey of the Occult.'' Electric Book Company. 2001. p. 28-30. {{ISBN|1-84327-087-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance to early modern period===
[[File:Squaredcircle.svg|thumb|The Squared Circle: an [[alchemical symbol]] (17th century) illustrating the interplay of the four [[Classical element|elements]] of matter symbolising the philosopher's stone]]
The 16th-century Swiss alchemist [[Paracelsus]] (''Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim'') believed in the existence of [[alkahest]], which he thought to be an undiscovered element from which all other elements (earth, fire, water, air) were simply derivative forms. Paracelsus believed that this element was, in fact, the philosopher's stone.

The English philosopher Sir [[Thomas Browne]] in his spiritual testament ''[[Religio Medici]]'' (1643) identified the religious aspect of the quest for the philosopher's Stone when declaring:
 
{{quote|The smattering I have of the Philosophers stone, (which is something more than the perfect exaltation of gold) hath taught me a great deale of Divinity.|(R.M.Part 1:38)&lt;ref&gt;The Major Works ed C.A. Patrides Penguin 1977&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A mystical text published in the 17th century called the ''[[Mutus Liber]]'' appears to be a symbolic instruction manual for concocting a philosopher's stone. Called the "wordless book", it was a collection of 15 illustrations.

===In Buddhism and Hinduism===
{{main|Cintamani}}
The equivalent of the philosopher's stone in [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] is the ''Cintamani''.&lt;ref&gt;[[René Guénon|Guénon, René]] (2004) (1962). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qEQQht2Y2CQC Symbols of Sacred Science]''. Sophia Perennis, USA. {{ISBN|0-900588-78-0}}. pp. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to&lt;ref&gt;DICTIONARY.COM&lt;/ref&gt; as Paras/Parasmani ([[Hindi]]: पारस/पारसमणि) or Paris ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]: परिस).

In Mahayana Buddhism, ''Chintamani'' is held by the [[bodhisattva]]s, [[Avalokiteshvara]] and [[Ksitigarbha]]. It is also seen carried upon the back of the [[Lung ta]] (wind horse) which is depicted on Tibetan [[Prayer flag#Symbols and prayers|prayer flags]]. By reciting the [[Dharani]] of Chintamani, Buddhist tradition maintains that one attains the Wisdom of Buddhas, is able to understand the truth of the Buddhas, and turns afflictions into [[Bodhi]]. It is said to allow one to see the Holy Retinue of [[Amitabha]] and his assembly upon one's deathbed. In Tibetan Buddhist tradition the Chintamani is sometimes depicted as a luminous pearl and is in the possession of several of different forms of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Donkin, ''Beyond price: pearls and pearl-fishing : origins to the Age of Discoveries'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=leHFqMQ9mw8C&amp;pg=PA170 p. 170]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Hinduism it is connected with the gods [[Vishnu]] and [[Ashtavinayak#Shri Chintamani|Ganesha]]. In Hindu tradition it is often depicted as a fabulous jewel in the possession of the [[Nāga]] king or as on the forehead of the [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|Makara]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The ''[[Yoga Vasistha]]'', originally written in the 10th century AD, contains a story about the philosopher's stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Concise Yoga Vasistha |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany |first=Swami |last=Venkatesananda |authorlink=Swami Venkatesananda |year=1984 |isbn=0-87395-955-8 |oclc=11044869 |pages=346–353 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1FFdOj2dv8cC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A great Hindu sage wrote about the spiritual accomplishment of [[Gnosis]] using the metaphor of the philosopher's stone. Saint [[Dnyaneshwar|Jnaneshwar]] (1275–1296) wrote a commentary with 17 references to the philosopher's stone that explicitly transmutes base metal into gold. The seventh century [[Siddhar]] [[Tirumular|Thirumoolar]] in his classic ''Tirumandhiram'' explains man's path to immortal divinity. In verse 2709 he declares that the name of God, [[Shiva]] is an alchemical vehicle that turns the body into immortal gold.

==Properties==
The most commonly mentioned properties are the ability to transmute base metals into gold or silver, and the ability to heal all forms of illness and prolong the life of any person who consumes a small part of the philosopher's stone.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Theophrastus Paracelsus. ''The Book of the Revelation of Hermes''. 16th century&lt;/ref&gt; Other mentioned properties include: creation of perpetually burning lamps,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; transmutation of common crystals into precious stones and diamonds,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; reviving of dead plants,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; creation of flexible or malleable glass,&lt;ref&gt;An unknown German Sage. ''A Very Brief Tract Concerning the Philosophical Stone''. (unknown date, possibly 16th century)&lt;/ref&gt; or the creation of a clone or [[homunculus]].&lt;ref&gt;Theophrastus Paracelsus. ''Of the Nature of Things''. 16th century&lt;/ref&gt;

===Names===
Numerous synonyms were used to make oblique reference to the stone, such as "white stone" (''calculus albus'', identified with the ''calculus candidus'' of Revelation 2:17 which was taken as a symbol of the glory of heaven&lt;ref&gt;Salomon Glass, Johann Gottfried Olearius, ''Philologia sacra: qua totius Vet. et Novi Testamenti Scripturae tum stylus et litteratura, tum sensus et genuinae interpretationis ratio et doctrina libris V expenditur ac traditur'' ^, imp. J. Fred. Gleditschius (1743)&lt;/ref&gt;), ''[[vitriol]]'' (as expressed in the [[backronym]] ''Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem''), also ''lapis noster'', ''lapis occultus'', ''in water at the box'', and numerous oblique, mystical or mythological references such as ''[[Adam]], Aer, Animal, Alkahest, Antidotus, [[Antimony|Antimonium]], Aqua benedicta, Aqua volans per aeram, [[wikt:arcanum|Arcanum]], Atramentum, Autumnus, Basilicus, Brutorum cor, Bufo, Capillus, Capistrum auri, Carbones, [[Cerberus]], [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], Cinis cineris, [[Crocus]], Dominus philosophorum, Divine quintessence, Draco elixir, Filius ignis, Fimus, Folium, Frater, Granum, Granum frumenti, Haematites, Hepar, Herba, Herbalis, Lac, Melancholia, Ovum philosophorum, Panacea salutifera, [[Pandora]], [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]], Philosophic mercury, Pyrites, Radices arboris solares, Regina, Rex regum, Sal metallorum, Salvator terrenus, Talcum, Thesaurus, Ventus hermetis''.&lt;ref&gt;listed e.g. in W. Schneider, ''Lexikon alchemistisch-pharmazeutischer Symbole'', Weinheim 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the medieval allegories for a Christ were adopted for the ''lapis'', and the Christ and the Stone were indeed taken as identical in a mystical sense. The name of "Stone" or ''lapis'' itself is informed by early Christian allegory, such as [[Priscillian]] (4th century), who stated ''Unicornis est Deus, nobis petra Christus, nobis lapis angularis Jesus, nobis hominum homo Christus''.&lt;ref&gt;''Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum '' t. XVIII, p. 24, cited by C. G. Jung in ''Roots of Consciousness''.&lt;/ref&gt; In some texts it is simply called 'stone', or our stone, or in the case of [[Thomas Norton (alchemist)|Thomas Norton's]] Ordinal, "oure delycious stone".&lt;ref&gt;Line 744 in Thomas Norton's The Ordinal of Alchemy by John Rediry. The Early English Text Society no. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The stone was frequently praised and referred to in such terms.

It needs to be noted that ''philosophorum'' does not mean "of the philosopher" or "the philosopher's" in the sense of a single philosopher. It means "of the philosophers" in the sense of a plurality of philosophers.

===Appearance===
[[File:Michael Maier Atalanta Fugiens Emblem 21.jpeg|thumb|Philosopher's stone as pictured in ''[[Atalanta Fugiens]]'' Emblem 21]]
[[File:The First Key of Basil Valentine. Wellcome M0012394.jpg|thumb|The first key of [[Basil Valentine]], emblem associated with the 'Great Work' of obtaining the Philosopher's stone (''Twelve Keys of Basil Valentine'').]]
Descriptions of the Philosopher's Stone are numerous and various.&lt;ref&gt;John Read "From Alchemy to Chemistry" p.29&lt;/ref&gt; According to alchemical texts, the stone of the philosophers came in two varieties, prepared by an almost identical method: white (for the purpose of making silver), and red (for the purpose of making gold), the white stone being a less matured version of the red stone.&lt;ref name="A German Sage 1423"&gt;A German Sage. ''A Tract of Great Price Concerning the Philosophical Stone''. 1423.&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient and medieval alchemical texts leave clues to the physical appearance of the stone of the philosophers, specifically the red stone. It is often said to be orange (saffron colored) or red when ground to powder. Or in a solid form, an intermediate between red and purple, transparent and glass-like.&lt;ref&gt;John Frederick Helvetius. ''Golden Calf''. 17th Century.&lt;/ref&gt; The weight is spoken of as being heavier than gold,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Anonymous. ''On the Philosophers' Stone''. (unknown date, possibly 16th century)&lt;/ref&gt; and it is soluble in any liquid, yet incombustible in fire.&lt;ref&gt;Eirenaeus Philalethes. ''A Brief Guide to the Celestial Ruby''. 1694 CE&lt;/ref&gt;

Alchemical authors sometimes suggest that the stone's descriptors are metaphorical.&lt;ref&gt;Charles John Samuel Thompson. Alchemy and Alchemists. p.70&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance is expressed geometrically in Michael Maier's ''[[Atalanta Fugiens]]''. "Make of a man and woman a circle; then a quadrangle; out of this a triangle; make again a circle, and you will have the Stone of the Wise. Thus is made the stone, which thou canst not discover, unless you, through diligence, learn to understand this geometrical teaching."&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Craven. "Count Michael Maier". p.90&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean de Roquetaillade|Rupescissa]] uses the imagery of the Christian passion, telling us it ascends "from the sepulcher of the Most Excellent King, shining and glorious, resuscitated from the dead and wearing a red diadem...".&lt;ref&gt;[[Leah DeVun]]. ''Prophecy, alchemy, and the end of time: John of Rupescissa in the late Middle Ages''. Columbia University Press, 2009. p.118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretations===
The various names and attributes assigned to the philosopher's stone has led to long-standing speculation on its composition and source. Esoteric candidates have been found in metals, plants, rocks, chemical compounds, and bodily products such as hair, urine, and eggs. [[Justus von Liebig]] states that 'it was indispensable that every substance accessible... should be observed and examined'.&lt;ref&gt;John Read. ''From Alchemy to Chemistry'' London: G. Bell. 1957. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Alchemists once thought a key component in the creation of the stone was a mythical [[chemical element|element]] named carmot.&lt;ref name=Burt1885&gt;Burt, A.L. 1885. ''The National Standard Encyclopedia: A Dictionary of Literature, the Sciences and the Arts, for Popular Use'' p. 150. [https://books.google.com/books?id=J6QRAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA151&amp;dq=carmot+philosopher+stone#PRA2-PA150,M1 Available online.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anton1999&gt;Sebastian, Anton. 1999. ''A Dictionary of the History of Medicine.'' p. 179. {{ISBN|1-85070-021-4}}.

Esoteric [[hermeticism|hermetic]] alchemists may reject work on exoteric substances, instead directing their search for the philosopher's stone inward.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton J. Linden. ''The alchemy reader: from Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton'' Cambridge University Press. 2003. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Though esoteric and exoteric approaches are sometimes mixed, it is clear that some authors "are not concerned with material substances but are employing the language of exoteric alchemy for the sole purpose of expressing theological, philosophical, or mystical beliefs and aspirations".&lt;ref&gt;Eric John Holmyard. ''Alchemy'' Courier Dover Publications, 1990. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; New interpretations continue to be developed around [[spagyric]], chemical, and esoteric schools of thought.

==Creation==
{{Main|Magnum opus (alchemy)}}
The philosopher's stone is created by the alchemical method known as The Magnum Opus or The Great Work. Often expressed as a series of color changes or chemical processes, the instructions for creating the philosopher's stone are varied. When expressed in colors, the work may pass through phases of [[nigredo]], [[albedo (alchemy)|albedo]], [[citrinitas]], and [[rubedo]]. When expressed as a series of chemical processes it often includes seven or twelve stages concluding in [[multiplication (alchemy)|multiplication]], and [[projection (alchemy)|projection]].

==Art and entertainment==
{{Main|Alchemy in art and entertainment}}

The philosopher's stone has been an inspiration, plot feature, or subject of innumerable artistic works: [[animation]]s, [[comic]]s, [[film]]s, [[music]]al compositions, [[novel]]s, and [[video game]]s.

'''Punk ideologies''' are a group of varied social and political beliefs associated with the [[punk subculture]] and [[punk rock]]. In its original incarnation, the punk subculture originated out of working class angst and the frustrations many youth were feeling about economic inequality and the bourgeois hypocrisy and neglect of working people and their struggles.  It was primarily concerned with concepts such as [[poverty]], [[egalitarianism]], [[humanitarianism]], [[anti-authoritarianism]], [[anti-corporatism]], [[anti-consumerism]], [[anti-war]], [[media culture|anti-media culture]], [[mainstream media|anti-mainstream or mainstream media]], [[anti-intellectualism]], against [[selling out]], [[anti-conservative]],  [[anti-nationalism]], anti-[[corporate greed]], anti-infatuation, against vagrancy laws, [[anti-racism]], anti-[[sexism]], [[gender equality]], [[racial equality]], [[civil rights]], [[animal rights]], [[environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]], [[social rights]], [[free-thought]] and [[non-conformity]]. One of its main tenets was a rejection of mainstream, corporate [[mass culture]] and its values.  It continued to evolve its ideology as the movement spread throughout North America from its origins in England and New York and embrace a range anti-racist and anti-sexist belief systems. Punk ideologies range from [[left wing]] views (e.g., [[NOFX]]) to [[right wing]] beliefs (e.g., [[No Remorse (band)|No Remorse]]) or [[apolitical]] (e.g., [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]]).

Punk ideologies are usually expressed through [[punk rock]] music and lyrics, [[punk literature]] such as amateur [[fanzines]], [[spoken word]] performances or recordings, [[punk fashion]], or [[punk visual art]]. Some punks have participated in [[direct action]], such as protest or demonstration disruption, political violence, [[ecotage]], street barricades, [[squatting]], [[pirate radio]], [[off-grid energy]], [[vandalism]] and public and business [[property destruction]]. Indirect action through counter-propaganda, [[protest]]s or [[boycott]]s. They support and squat in urban and rural collective house's with held group funds in common. [[Punk fashion]] was originally an expression of nonconformity, as well as opposition to both mainstream culture and the [[status quo]]. Punk fashion often displays aggression, rebellion, and individualism. Some punks wear clothing or have [[tattoos]] that express sociopolitical messages. They stage Punk Rock Food Drives such as D.O.A's Unity for Freedom. Punk visual art also often includes political messages. Many punks wear second-hand clothing, partly as an anti-consumerist statement.

An attitude common in the punk subculture is the opposition to [[selling out]], which refers to abandoning of one's values and/or a change in musical style toward [[Pop music|pop]] and embracing anything in mainstream capitalist culture or more radio-friendly [[Rock music|rock]] in exchange for wealth, status, or power. Selling out also has the meaning of adopting a more mainstream lifestyle and ideology. The issue of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] is important in the punk subculture—the pejorative term ''[[poseur]]'' is applied to those who associate with punk and adopt its stylistic attributes but are deemed not to share or understand the underlying values or philosophy.

Because [[anti-establishment]] attitudes are such an important part of the punk subculture, a network of [[independent record label]]s, venues and distributors has developed. Some punk bands have chosen to break from this independent system and work within the established system of [[major label]]s. The [[do it yourself]] (DIY) ideal is common in the punk scene, especially in terms of music recording and distribution, concert promotion, and photocopying magazines, posters and flyers. The expression [[DIY]] was coined by commentators after the fact.

On religious issues, punk is mostly [[atheism|atheist]] or [[agnosticism|agnostic]], but some punk bands have promoted religions such as [[Christian punk|Christianity]], [[Buddhism]],  [[Taqwacore|Islam]], the [[Rastafari movement]] or [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Krishna]].

==Specific ideologies and philosophies==
The following include some of the most common ideologies and philosophies within the punk subculture (in alphabetical order).

===Anarchism===
{{Main|Anarcho-punk}}
[[File:Punk Occupy Pittsburgh protestors (6262172208).jpg|thumb|right|170px|A punk protester carries a sign including an anarchy symbol.]]
There is a complex and worldwide underground of punks committed to anarchism as a serious political ideology, sometimes termed "peace punks" or "[[anarcho-punk]]s." While some well-known punk bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Exploited]] had songs about [[anarchy]], notably the Pistols' ''[[Anarchy in the UK]]'', they did not embrace anarchism as a disciplined ideology. As such, these bands are not considered part of the anarcho-punk scene.&lt;ref&gt;Glasper, Ian (2006), ''The Day the Country Died: A History of Anarcho Punk 1980 to 1984'', Cherry Red publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-901447-70-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-punks typically believe in [[direct action]]. Many anarcho-punks are [[pacifism|pacifists]] (e.g. Crass and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]]) and therefore believe in using non-violent means of achieving their aims. These include peaceful protest, [[squatting]], [[graffiti]], [[culture jamming]], [[ecotage]], [[freeganism]], [[boycott]]ing, [[civil disobedience]], [[hacktivism]] and [[subvertising]]. Some anarcho-punks believe that violence or property damage is an acceptable way of achieving social change (e.g. [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]]). This manifests itself as [[riot]]ing, [[vandalism]], wire cutting, [[Hunt saboteur|hunt sabotage]], participation in [[Animal Liberation Front]]- or [[Earth Liberation Front]]-style activities, and in extreme cases, bombings. Notable anarchist punk artists include: [[Aus-Rotten]], [[Dave Insurgent]], [[Crass]], [[Subhumans (British band)]], [[Colin Jerwood]], and [[Dave Dictor]].

===Animal rights and veganism===
In the 1980s, both [[straight edge]] hardcore punk in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helton|first=Jesse J.|last2=Staudenmeier|first2=William J.|year=2002|title=Re-imagining being 'straight' in straight edge|journal=Contemporary Drug Problems|volume=29|issue=2|page=465|issn=0091-4509|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Robert T.|title=Nailed to the X: A Lyrical History of Straightedge|journal=Journal of Youth Studies|year=1999|volume=2|issue=2|pages=133–151|ref=harv|doi=10.1080/13676261.1999.10593032}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name="descartes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/len-tilburger-and-chris-p-kale-nailing-descartes-to-the-wall-animal-rights-veganism-and-punk-cu|last1=Tilbürger|first1=Len|last2=Kale|first2=Chris P|title="Nailing Descartes to the Wall": Animal Rights, Veganism and Punk Culture|publisher=Active Distribution|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; became associated with [[animal rights]]. Consequently, [[vegetarianism]] and [[veganism]] became a feature of the punk subculture.&lt;ref name="descartes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haenfler|first=Ross|title=Straight Edge: Hardcore Punk, Clean Living Youth, and Social Change|year=2006|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-3851-3|ref=harv|page=53 and 427–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association continues on into the 21st century, as evidenced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as [[Fluff Fest]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="sober"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=YWb7BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sober Living for the Revolution: Hardcore Punk, Straight Edge, and Radical Politics|page=137|last=Kuhn|first=Gabriel|publisher=PM Press|date=2010|isbn=1604860510|author-link=Gabriel_Kuhn|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bandcamp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://daily.bandcamp.com/2017/09/20/czech-diy-list/|title=The Sincere and Vibrant World of the Czech DIY Scene|publisher=Bandcamp|first=Jacopo|last=Sanna|date=20 September 2017|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apoliticism===
Some punks claim to be non-political, such as the band [[Charged GBH]] and the singer [[G.G. Allin]], although some socio-political ideas have appeared in their lyrics. Some Charged GBH songs have discussed social issues, and a few have expressed anti-war views. G.G. Allin expressed a vague desire to kill the United States president and destroy the political system in his song "Violence Now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/ekx001/LYRIC/VNATP.html |title=The GG Allin SuperSite Lyrics - Violence Now - Assassinate The President |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027094628/http://geocities.com/ekx001/LYRIC/VNATP.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Punk subgenres that are generally apolitical include: [[glam punk]], [[psychobilly]], [[horror punk]], [[punk pathetique]], [[deathrock]] and [[pop punk]]. Many of the bands credited with starting the punk movement were decidedly apolitical, including [[The Dictators]], [[Ramones]] (which featured staunch [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Johnny Ramone]] alongside [[liberalism|liberal]] activist [[Joey Ramone]]), [[New York Dolls]], [[Television (band)|Television]], [[Johnny Thunders &amp; The Heartbreakers]], and [[Richard Hell &amp; The Voidoids]].

===Christianity===
{{main|Christian punk}}
[[Christian punk]] is a subgenre of punk rock with some degree of Christian lyrical content. Some Christian punk bands are associated with the [[Contemporary Christian music|Christian music industry]],&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/christian-punk-ma0000002639/artists|title=Christian Punk Music Artists - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others reject that association. Ideologies within Christian punk vary, though a number of bands lean towards traditional left-wing politics, most prominently [[Crashdog]], [[Ballydowse]] and [[The Psalters]], the latter two of whom identified as [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bramboniusinenglish.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/the-lost-psalters-interview-from-august-11-kortrijk/ |title=The Lost Psalters Interview |date=March 14, 2012 |publisher=Brambonius}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://londoncelticpunks.wordpress.com/tag/ballydowse/ |title=Tribute to Ballydowse |publisher=London Celtic Punks Web-Zine |date=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further examples of notable Christian punk bands include [[Altar Boys]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/altar-boys-mn0000793617/biography |title=Altar Boys |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Crucified]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-crucified-mn0000135837|title=The Crucified - Biography, Albums, Streaming Links - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Five Iron Frenzy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/five-iron-frenzy-mn0000178494 |title=Five Iron Frenzy |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flatfoot 56]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/flatfoot-56-mn0000921885 |title=Flatfoot 56 |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pop-punk band [[MxPx]], who earned a [[Music recording certification|gold record]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mxpx-mn0000521851 |title=MxPx |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservatism ===
{{see also|Conservative Punk}}
A small number are [[Conservatism|conservative]], rejecting leftist-[[anarchism]], [[liberalism]], [[communism]] and [[socialism]] in favor of conservatism. Notable conservative punks include [[Johnny Ramone]], [[Forgotten Rebels]], [[Billy Zoom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markprindle.com/zoom-i.htm |title=Billy Zoom interview |publisher=Markprindle.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Escalante]], [[Bobby Steele]], [[Duane Peters]] and [[Dave Smalley]]. Some [[Christian punk]] and hardcore bands have [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political stances, in particular some of the [[New York hardcore|NYHC]] bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McPheeters |first=Sam |url=https://www.vice.com/read/survival-of-the-streets-137-v16n9 |title=Survival Of The Streets &amp;#124; VICE United States |publisher=Vice.com |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hare Krishna===
{{Further|Krishnacore}}
The Filipino punk band the [[Krishnacore|Wuds]] which was formed in the early 1980s is the first known punk band who composed songs dedicated to [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allmusic.com/artist/wuds-mn0001790200&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, some notable members of the [[New York hardcore]] scene, including [[Ray Cappo]] ([[Youth of Today]], [[Shelter (band)|Shelter]] and other bands), [[John Joseph (rock singer)|John Joseph]] ([[Cro-Mags]]) and [[Harley Flanagan]] (Cro-Mags) converted to [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.punkbands.com/reviews.php?id=661]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823161134/http://www.punkbands.com/reviews.php?id=661|date=August 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to trend within the western hardcore scene that became known as Krishnacore.

===Islam===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[Taqwacore]] is a punk subgenre centred on [[Islam]], its culture and its interpretation. The Taqwacore scene is composed mainly of young Muslim artists living in the United States and other western countries, many of whom openly reject traditionalist interpretations of Islam. There is no definitive Taqwacore sound, and some bands incorporate styles including hip-hop, techno, and/or musical traditions from the Muslim world. Examples of Muslim punk bands include [[Alien Kulture]], [[The Kominas]] and [[Secret Trial Five]].

===Liberalism===
[[Liberalism|Liberal]] punks were in the punk subculture from the beginning, and are mostly on the [[social liberalism|liberal left]]. Notable liberal punks (second wave, mid-1990s to 2000s) include: [[Joey Ramone]], [[Fat Mike]] of [[NOFX]], [[Ted Leo]], [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] of [[Green Day]], [[Crashdog]],  [[Dropkick Murphys]], [[Hoxton Tom McCourt]], [[Jared Gomes]] of [[Hed PE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johndoerevolution.com/2010/08/hd-pe.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129035243/http://www.johndoerevolution.com/2010/08/hd-pe.html |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Latest-hed-p-e-album-has-plenty-of-messages-116661.php|title=Latest (hed) p.e. album has plenty of messages|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killyourstereo.com/interviews/1025867/hedp-e|title=(Hed)p.e - Interviews - Killyourstereo.com|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ownblood-magazine.de/interviews187.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218034734/http://www.ownblood-magazine.de/interviews187.htm |archivedate=2014-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Armstrong]] of [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and [[Tim McIlrath]] of [[Rise Against]]. Some punks participated in the [[Rock Against Bush]] movement in the mid-2000s, in support of the Democratic Party candidate [[John Kerry]].

===Libertarianism===
Libertarian punks advocate [[free market]] [[capitalism]], a [[Night-watchman state|minimal government]] and private ownership of property. Joe Young of the band [[Antiseen]],&lt;ref name=slug&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slugmag.com/articles/106/ANTiSEEN.html |title=SLUG Magazine &amp;#124; ANTiSEEN |publisher=Slugmag.com |date=2004-09-29 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exene Cervenka]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/24-7/2012/10/13/punk-icon-exene-cervenka-endorses-gary-j |title=Punk Icon Exene Cervenka Endorses Gary Johnson - Reason 24/7 |publisher=Reason.com |date=2012-10-13 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mojo Nixon]] have expressed support for libertarianism. Though originally a conservative,  [[Michale Graves]] has shifted towards libertarianism in recent years.

===Neo-Nazism===
{{Main|Nazi punk|White power rock|Rock Against Communism}}
[[Nazi punk]]s have a [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] ideology that is closely related to that of [[white power skinhead]]s. [[Ian Stuart Donaldson]] and his band [[Skrewdriver]] are credited with popularizing [[white power rock]] and [[hatecore]] (for its hateful lyrical themes), or [[Rock Against Communism]]. Nazi punks are different from early punks such as [[Sid Vicious]] and [[Siouxsie Sioux]], who are believed to have incorporated Nazi imagery such as [[Swastika]]s for shock or comedy value.

===Nihilism===
Centering on a belief in the abject lack of meaning and value to life, [[nihilism]] was a fixture in some early punk rock and [[protopunk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/interview-with-simon-critchley/|title=Nihilism, Punk and the International Necronautical Society: an interview with Simon Critchley -|date=30 March 2009|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sex Pistols]] were central to the association of punk and nihilsm, with the ''Trouser Press Record Guide'' writing that their "confrontational, nihilistic public image and rabidly nihilistic socio-political lyrics set the tone that continues to guide punk bands."&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Ira, "Sex Pistols", in ''The Trouser Press Record Guide'', 4th ed., ed. Ira Robbins, p.585, Collier, 1991. {{ISBN|0-02-036361-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, researcher Neil Eriksen argues that though "much of the critical realism [of punk rock] expresses cynicism and nihilism, it does serve to question existing relations in such a way that listeners are forced to think about what is being said",&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/periodicals/theoretical-review/19801802.htm|title=Popular Culture and Revolutionary Theory: Understanding Punk Rock|first=|last=EROL|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that overt rejection of meaning is primarily concerned with challenging existing values.

=== Situationism ===
[[File:DUST Flyer.jpg|thumb|Flyer for DUST happening circa. 1992]]
The [[Situationist International]] (SI) was an early influence on punk subculture in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Marcus, Greil 1989"&gt;Marcus, Greil, Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century, Harvard University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-571-23228-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Started in continental Europe in the 1950s, the SI was an avant-garde political movement that sought to recapture the ideals of surrealist art and use them to construct new and radical social situations. [[Malcolm McLaren]] introduced situationist ideas to punk through his management of the band [[Sex Pistols]].&lt;ref name="Marcus, Greil 1989" /&gt; [[Vivienne Westwood]], McLaren's partner and the band's designer/stylist, expressed situationist ideals through fashion that was intended to provoke a specific social response. 15% Pus and DUST, subversive 1990s Manchester bands, staged psycho-geographic walks around [[Hulme]] and created human collages from road signs as part of what became known as 'psycho-spectre.' [[Jamie Reid]]'s distinctive album cover artwork was openly situationist.

===Socialism===
[[The Clash]] were a blatantly political punk rock band, introducing [[socialism]] to the punk scene.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yfMIaUCBTWMC&amp;pg=PA47 Ensminger, David, ''Left of the Dial: Conversations with Punk Icons'' (Oakland, CA: PM Press) p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9qfACzulTwIC&amp;pg=PT327 |title=Seventies Unplugged - Gerard DeGroot - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clash frontman [[Joe Strummer]] said of his socialist views "I believe in socialism because it seems more humanitarian, rather than every man for himself and 'I'm alright jack' and all those asshole businessmen with all the loot. I made up my mind from viewing society from that angle. That's where I'm from and there's where I've made my decisions from. That's why I believe in socialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salewicz|first1=Chris|title=Redemption Song: The Ballad of Joe Strummer|date=May 13, 2008|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0865479821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the original [[Oi!]] bands expressed a rough form of socialist [[working class]] [[populism]] — often mixed with [[patriotism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Worley |url=http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/20/tcbh.hwt001.full |title=Oi!

In the 1980s, several notable British socialist punk musicians were involved with [[Red Wedge]]. Notable socialist punks include: [[Attila the Stockbroker]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Bruce La Bruce]], [[Garry Bushell]] (until the late 1980s), [[The Redskins|Chris Dean]], [[The Dicks|Gary Floyd]], [[Jack Grisham]], [[Stewart Home]], [[Dennis Lyxzén]], [[Angelic Upstarts|Thomas Mensforth]], [[Fermin Muguruza]], [[Boikot|Alberto Pla]], [[Tom Robinson (musician)|Tom Robinson]], [[Seething Wells]], [[The Men They Couldn't Hang|Paul Simmonds]], [[Rob Tyner]], Joe Strummer, [[Ian Svenonius]], [[Mark Steel]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] (guitarist for British powerhouse, new wave band, The Jam). Neil Eriksen wrote in 1980: "... we feel that elements of punk rock fulfill a revolutionary cultural function".&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt;

[[Bernie Sanders]], a [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] running for [[president of the United States]] in 2016, was endorsed by various bands and musicians including [[Jello Biafra]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]], [[Mike Watt]], [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]], [[Keith Morris]], [[Cheetah Chrome]], [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], [[Jesse Malin]], [[Belinda Carlisle]] and [[Pussy Riot]] among others. In April 2016, a [[Richmond, VA]] artist named Mickael Broth, created a large mural of a Sanders which was inspired by a classic [[Circle Jerks]]   logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.styleweekly.com/Studi/archives/2016/04/05/punk-rock-bernie-sanders-mural-goes-up-on-broad-street|title=Punk Rock Bernie Sanders Mural Goes Up on Broad Street|first=Brent|last=Baldwin|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders has also been credited as having a major impact on the east coast punk scene in the United States. In the early 1980s as mayor of [[Burlington, VT]], Sanders fought a government ban on live music and had a major goal of building a youth center. That center became [[242 Main Street]], which is currently one of the United States longest running all-ages youth-run DIY punk venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/how-bernie-sanders-242-main-street-shaped-the-northeast-punk-scene-515|title=How Bernie Sanders Shaped the Northeast Punk Scene|website=Vice|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Straight edge===
{{Main|Straight edge|Hardline (subculture)}}
[[Straight edge]], which originated in the [[Washington DC]] hardcore punk scene with [[Minor Threat]] song "Straight Edge" written by frontman [[Ian MacKaye]] and guitarist Brian Baker. Straight edge involves abstaining from [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], and [[recreational drug use]]. Some who claim the title straight edge also abstain from [[caffeine]], casual sex and meat. (Although the Washington DC straight-edge scene exhibited a fierce allegiance for Coca-Cola, with supporters rarely, if ever, seen drinking anything else in public.) Those more strict individuals may be considered part of the [[Hardline (subculture)|hardline subculture]]. Unlike the shunning of meat and caffeine, refraining from casual sex was without question a practice in the original straight edge lifestyle, but it has been overlooked in many of the later reincarnations of straight edge. For some, straight edge is a simple lifestyle preference, but for others it is a political stance. In many cases, it is a rejection of the perceived self-destructive qualities of punk and hardcore culture. MacKaye has often spoken out against others labeling themselves as being Straight edge, which was never his intentions for it being a label but it became a movement one in which he became annoyed with. Notable straight edgers: [[Tim McIlrath]], [[CM Punk]] and [[Davey Havok]].

==Criticism of punk ideologies==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
Punk ideologies have been criticized from outside and within. [[The Clash]] occasionally accused other contemporary punk acts of selling out, such as in their songs "[[(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais]]" and "[[London Calling|Death or Glory]]". [[Crass]]'s song "White Punks on Hope" criticized the late-1970s British punk scene in general and, among other things, accused [[Joe Strummer]] of selling out and betraying his earlier socialist principles. Their song "Punk is Dead" attacked corporate [[Recuperation (sociology)|co-option]] of the [[punk subculture]]. [[Dead Kennedys]] frontman [[Jello Biafra]] wrote many songs, such as '' [[Nazi Punks Fuck Off]]'', criticizing aspects of the punk subculture:  ''"Punk ain't no religious cult
Punk means thinking for yourself
You ain't hardcore cos you spike your hair...''

[[Misfits (band)|Misfit]] frontman [[Michale Graves]], who cofounded the [[Conservative Punk]] website, argued that punks have become "[[hippie]]s with [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawks]]". However, he has since distanced himself from conservatism.

Author [[Jim Goad]] has been very critical of punk ideologies in many of his writings. In his essay "The Underground is A Lie!", Goad argued that many punks are hypocrites, and he claimed that many punks act poor while hiding the fact they come from [[middle class|middle]] to [[upper class]] backgrounds. In ''Farts from Underground'', Goad claimed that the [[DIY ethic]] never produces anything original, and it allows poor quality work to be championed.

In their book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'', [[Joseph Heath]] and [[Andrew Potter]] argued that [[counterculture]] politics have failed, and that the punk understanding of society is flawed. They also argued that alternative and mainstream lifestyles ultimately have the same values.

'''Speech-language pathology,''' also known as ''communication sciences and disorders'' in the United States, is a fast-growing profession that, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, offers about 120,000 jobs in the United States alone.  The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) has 166,000 members, who are audiologists, speech-language pathologists, speech, language, and hearing scientists, and speech language pathology assistants.  To begin practice in most areas of the [[United States]], a prospective therapist must have an undergraduate degree (preferably in some area of communications) and a graduate degree (with two externships; usually about 2 to 2 1/2 years) in speech pathology.  A 9-month, supervised clinical fellowship year is then completed, after which the Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) in speech pathology from the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) is granted.  In order to be certified clinically competent the Praxis exam must be passed.  In some areas the master's degree is not required.  In some areas additional requirements must be met: an additional certification from ASHA in school speech pathology and audiology, certification in special education instruction, and/or and must have passed any other federal or state examinations for licensure and certification.  To retain the ASHA license a minimum amount of continuing education must be completed.  A doctorate is not currently required (as of June 2011), but that may change, as it has for many other areas of therapy.  Speech-language pathology overlaps with many educational disciplines, such as communication sciences, linguistics, special education, and health care.  This article will explore some of the fundamental elements of speech-language pathology, looking at the career in an educational setting.

==Speech and language pathology==
{{main|Speech and language pathology}}
Speech-Language Pathologists (SLP) are professionals who assess and diagnose individuals with speech, language, cognitive, and swallowing disorders. SLPs are informally referred to as ''speech therapist''s. SLPs may also  conduct research in the field, run a private practice, or work with large companies to improve employee-customer communication ([[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]]).  This article will focus on the aspects of speech-language pathology as practiced with young children in a school setting.

For most people, the terms ''speech'', ''language'', and ''communication'' have nearly the same definition.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}  However, in the realm of speech-language pathology, there are important distinctions to be made.

'''Speech''' is the spoken production of language and the process through which sounds are produced.  Several parts of the body work together to produce sound waves, and this motor production of speech is called articulation.  The parts of the vocal tract involved with speech include the lips, tongue, teeth, throat, vocal folds, and lungs.  Speech disorders affect the physical mechanisms of communication and cause problems with articulation or phonology.  Examples of speech disorders include [[stuttering]], [[lisp]]ing, and voice disorders.

'''Language''' is a system used to represent thoughts and ideas.  Language is made up of several rules that explain what words mean, how to make new words, and how to put words together to form sentences.  A community must share the same language in order to attach meaning to utterances. The method of delivery of language may be visual (e.g., [[American Sign Language]]), auditory (e.g., English), and/or written. Humans are the only creatures innately capable of using language to discuss an endless number of topics.  Language disorders can be developmental or acquired (e.g., [[specific language impairment]] and [[aphasia]], respectively).

'''Communication''' is the exchange of information and ideas through the use of speech and language.  The transfer of information is often spoken, but may also be implied through body language or contextual cues such as intonation or hesitation.  Usually, communication is a four-step process:

# Encoding: the speaker creates the message in his mind
# Transmittal: the speaker sends the message
# Reception: the listener receives the message
# Decoding: the listener breaks down the message in his mind

If a problem occurs at any step of the process, the message might not be communicated.  Without the ability to communicate through speech and language, we would not be able to tell a doctor that we have a stomach ache, choose food from a menu, or say “I love you” to our children.  Communication is a most basic component of human nature and it develops before we are even conscious of it.

'''PHAGIA &amp; SWALLOWING'''
The process of grasping, biting, sucking, mucose making, swallowing and routine eating ability. Dysphagia can effect in many aspect of life. Dysphagia accurs in developments disorder and acquired brain and buccofacial anomalies or disease.

==Speech and Language Pathology Jobs==
{{main|Speech and language pathology}}
Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) have several options when seeking employment. One of the most popular is to secure a school-based position through an agency that specializes in this area. One of the largest and most respected agencies is [http://www.txsource.com Therapy Source], a nationwide organization founded in 2001, and based out of Plymouth Meeting, PA.

==Development of speech and language==

Every child develops at a different rate, but most go through the same stages.  Listed below are the average ages of some important language and comprehension milestones as developed by the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]].  Please note that like with any developmental timeline, these stages may be quite varied and perhaps met in a different order.  A child who accomplishes these milestones differently may not necessarily have a developmental delay or speech disorder (and a child who hits these stages early is not necessarily a prodigy!).

* birth to 3 months
** startles to loud sounds
** smiles when spoken to
** responds to pleasure with 'cooing' noises
* 4 months to 6 months
** notices and pays attention to sounds and music
** shifts eyes in direction of sounds
** makes babbling noises that resemble speech
* 7 months to 1 year
** recognizes basic familiar words such as ''cup'' or ''ball''
** imitates different speech sounds
** produces first words such as ''bye-bye'' or ''mama''
* 1 year to 2 years
** listens to simple stories
** identifies pictures by name when directed (''point to the cow'', e.g.)
** speaks two-word sentences such as ''more juice'' or ''where daddy?''
* 2 years to 3 years
** understands differences in meaning for basic words (''up-down'' or ''in-out'')
** produces three-word sentences
** can name most objects
* 3 years to 4 years
** understands questions
** talks about events
** speech is understood by most people
* 4 years to 5 years
** pays attention and responds to stories and questions
** speaks clearly
** tells detailed, ordered stories

Problems can arise at any stage of development, as well as much later in life.  They can be the result of a congenital defect, a developmental disorder, or an injury.  If a problem is suspected, an assessment should be made by an SLP who can diagnose and treat communication disorders.

==Diagnosis of communication disorders==

In a school setting, children are often screened when they start kindergarten.  This process involves a rapid assessment to determine which children need further testing, diagnosis, or treatment.  Often, a screening is a sort of informal interview between an SLP and a child or group of children.  The child may be asked to give their name, count, pronounce the names of pictured objects, and answer open-ended questions.  The purpose of these tasks is to elicit a brief language sample from the child which the SLP will use to evaluate articulation, fluency, and other aspects of speech.  Screenings usually last about five minutes (Oyer 10).

After a screening is done, an individual diagnosis must be made.  This involves a one-on-one evaluation which may last two hours or more.  If an individual has been referred for testing, either by a doctor, teacher, or other professional, the screening process is skipped and testing starts here.  This session allows the SLP to gather information that will help in the diagnosis of a speech or language problem, as well as provide insight to possible causes, goals and objectives for therapy, and which techniques will work best for that individual.  Individual evaluations often include the following components:

* A visual examination of the oral cavity and throat (typically with a flashlight and tongue depressor) to determine whether the physical structures appear to be capable of speech production
* Tests of articulation of speech sounds in words and sentences as well as alone
* A measure of the ability to hear the difference between correct speech sounds and sounds actually produced
* Tests of expressive language and spontaneous speech
* Evaluations of fluency and voice
* A hearing test
* A case history

After this evaluation, the SLP will review the results and information gathered and determine whether the individual would benefit from speech therapy.  Goals and objectives of therapy are outlined and a specific treatment plan is created, drawing on the strengths and weaknesses and unique situation of that individual (Oyer 11).

==Common communication and language disorders==

Disorders that affect children may affect adults differently, or even not at all.  As the body grows and develops, the types of disorders that affect an individual change.  Children typically exhibit developmental language disorders, but may also experience problems due to illness or injury.

In developing children, language disorders are often related to congenital disabilities or neurological or physiological results of childhood illness.  These seemingly unrelated problems can seriously affect speech and language development.  Children that have cognitive impairments are often delayed in development of communication skills.  Different genetic syndromes that often cause cognitive impairment, such as [[Down syndrome]] or [[Williams syndrome]], often affect different areas of speech.  Children with autism tend to have difficulty communicating and expressing their emotions or desires.  Sometimes this is due to specific problems with articulation or semantics, but often it is an issue of neurological development directly related to autism.  Brain injuries, tumors, or seizures in children can also cause loss of language skills.  Children with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) commonly have learning difficulties which also affect their language development.  Emotional disturbances early in childhood can also affect the growth of basic communicative skills.  Perhaps more obvious are the developmental and communicative consequences of childhood hearing loss (Boone 200-05).

Some disorders commonly diagnosed in children:

===Specific language impairment/ Developmental Language Disorder (#DevLangDis)===
Some children have language development deficits that cannot be linked to neurological, intellectual, social, or motor causes.  The child’s language skills grow much more slowly than those of typically developing children.  While other children are speaking in complete sentences, using conjugated verb forms, the SLI child’s speech sounds telegraphic- lacking grammatical and functional morphemes (e.g., ''He go store''. rather than ''He goes to the store''.)  Their vocabulary remains relatively small while other children are adding new words every day.  The SLI child often produces short sentences in order to avoid embarrassment and may have problems understanding complex or figurative structures (such as metaphors or multi-clausal sentences).  Problems due to SLI can also lead to learning disabilities as the child fails to understand information being presented in science, language arts, or math classes.  Studies suggest that the cause of SLI is a biological difference in brain anatomy and development (Boone 204).  Treatment objectives generally focus on vocabulary development, verb morphology, memory and recall, and narrative skills (Goffman 154).

===Articulation disorders===
An [[Articulatory phonetics|articulation]] disorder may be diagnosed when a child has difficulty producing [[phoneme]]s, or speech sounds, correctly. When classifying a sound, speech pathologists refer to the [[manner of articulation]], the [[place of articulation]], and voicing. A speech sound disorder may include one or more errors of place, manner, or voicing of the phoneme.

Different types of articulation disorders include:

; omissions : certain sounds are deleted, often at the ends of words; entire syllables or classes of sounds may be deleted; e.g., ''fi''' for ''fish''
; substitutions : one sound is substituted for another, often with similar places or manners or articulation; e.g., ''{{sic|hide=y|fi|th}}'' for ''fish''
; distortions : sounds are changed slightly by what may seem like the addition of noise, or a change in voicing; e.g., ''filsh'' for ''fish''
; additions : an extra sound is added to one already produced correctly; often occurs at the ends of words; may include changes in voicing; e.g., ''fisha'' for ''fish'' (Boone 256-58)

The phonemes that present the greatest challenge for children include /l/ as in ''pull'', /r/ as in ''mirror'', /ʃ/ ("sh") as in ''shut'', /tʃ/ ("ch") as in ''church'', /dʒ/ ("j") as in ''fu'''dg'''e'', /z/ as in ''zoo'', /ʒ/ ("zh") as in ''mea'''s'''ure'', /θ/ ("th") as in ''math'' and /ð/ ("th") as in ''this'' (Boone 112).

Articulation disorders may be attributed to a variety of causes.  A child with hearing loss may not be able to hear certain phonemes pronounced at certain frequencies, or hear the error in their own production of sounds.  Oral-motor problems may also be at fault, such as ''[[developmental verbal dyspraxia]]'' (a problem with coordination of speech muscles) or ''[[dysarthria]]'' (abnormal facial muscle tone, often due to [[neurology|neurological]] problems such as [[cerebral palsy]]).  Abnormalities in the structure of the mouth and other speech muscles can cause problems with articulation; [[cleft palate]], tongue thrust, and dental-orthodontia abnormalities are some common examples.  Finally, it is difficult for children to hear and produce all of the different phonemes of a given language.  Development is slow, and may take up to seven years.  Sometimes, as children grow, articulation problems fade and disappear without treatment.  Often, however, therapy is necessary.  Treatment therapies may target semantic differences related to phonemic differences (e.g., teaching a child the difference between ''toe'' and ''toad'', underlining the importance of the final consonant), physical-motor differences (e.g., using a mirror to show a child the correct tongue placement for a particular sound), or behavior-modification techniques (e.g., repetitive production through prompts and fun learning games).  Support and reinforcement of therapy practices, both in the classroom and at home, are crucial to the success of articulation disorder treatment (Boone 122-24, 259-62, 274-76).

It is necessary to note the difference between articulation disorders and dialectical variations.  There are several dialects of English spoken in the United States, influenced by socioeconomic status, geographic isolation, and other languages either brought to the U.S. by settlers or indigenous languages of the Native Americans.  These social dialects are rule-governed and are not to be considered lesser than, but simply different from standard English.  Examples of dialectical features that may be mistaken for articulation disorders include the 'r-lessness' of New York City speech in words like floor, here, and paper as well as the reduction of consonant clusters in [[African American Vernacular English|African-American Vernacular English]] (AAVE).  If a word ends with two or more consonants such as in ''cold'', and is followed by another word that begins with a consonant such as ''cuts'', ''cold'' is shortened to ''col'', producing ''col cuts''.  These features alone should not be treated as articulation disorders to be 'cured' by speech therapy.  However, it is possible for a child with a dialectal variation to also have a [[communication disorder]].  It is important for a [[Speech-language pathology|speech pathologist]] to be able to tell the difference (Oyer 170).

===Voice disorders===
Children may experience problems with their voice due to misuse or abnormalities in the vocal mechanisms.  There are two types of voice disorders: those of phonation, and those of resonance.  Both types can be the result of either abuse or physical structure.  Voice disorders are among the most successfully treated speech and language problems because they can be solved with surgery or reconditioning of the voice (Boone 286).

A '''phonation disorder''' is a problem with pitch, loudness, or intensity that originates in the vocal folds of the larynx.  Phonation disorders may be ''functional'', caused by continuous yelling or throat clearing, excessive smoking, or speaking at an abnormally low frequency or pitch.  The results may be an increased size or thickening of the vocal folds, lesions or polyps on the vocal folds, or problems with elasticity of the larynx.  In these cases, the treatment involves resting the voice and learning to speak at optimal pitches and volumes, as well as eliminating external causes such as smoking.  Phonation disorders may also be ''organic'', due to viral growths, cancer, paralysis of laryngeal nerves, surgical intubation, or external traumas such as being hit in the throat with a baseball.  These problems may require surgical removal of growths or reconstruction of the larynx, accompanied by voice therapy (Boone 287-96).

A '''resonance disorder''' occurs when any part of the vocal tract is altered or dysfunctional.

In the case of an ''oral'' resonance disorder, the tongue sits too high in the front or back of the mouth.  When the tongue is too far forward in the mouth, a type of ‘baby voice’ occurs, and a lisp may also result.  Treatment involves practicing back vowels such as /a/ in ''father'', /o/ in ''boat'', and /u/ in ''spoon'', accompanied by back consonants like /k/ in ''broke'' and /g/ in ''bog''.  When the tongue sits toward the back of the mouth, the voice sounds dull, and problems with articulation at the front of the mouth may also occur.  Treatment focuses on front consonants such as /w/ in ''where'' or ''work'', /p/ in ''pink'', /b/ in ''ball'', /f/ in ''laugh'', /v/ in ''leave'', /l/ in ''mail'', and /th/ in ''with'' or ''bath'' coupled with high-front vowels like /i/ in ''wheat'', /I/ in ''fit'', /e/ in ''pay'', /E/ in ''bet'', and /ae/ in ''slat''.  This type of resonance disorder is commonly seen in children with severe hearing impairment.

''Nasal'' resonance disorders occur when the space between the oral and nasal cavities remains open or closed, producing a ''hypernasal'' or ''denasal'' resonance.  Causes of hypernasality include paralysis of the velum, a short velum, or a cleft palate which allows air to escape to the nasal cavity.  The speech of actor James Stewart is a recognizable example of hypernasality (although in this case, there was no structural problem; rather, he employed the highly nasal voice as part of his character).  Denasality is often caused by a structural blockage which doesn’t allow air to pass between the oral and nasal cavities.  A child experiencing denasality may sound like they have a bad cold.  If a structural problem is to blame, surgery is the most common treatment.  After surgery, or if there is no structural cause, voice therapy is often given, involving massive amounts of practice (Boone 305-12).

===Fluency disorders===
As a child’s language and [[vocabulary]] grows, they may struggle to locate a particular word or sound. Normal dysfluency occurs in developing children as a repetition of whole words or phrases while the child searches for a particular thought or word.  Around age three-and-a-half, children may compulsively repeat words or phrases.  This tends to fade by the time the child is five.  [[Stuttering]], in contrast, results in repeated or prolonged speech sounds or syllables.  Often, involuntary blocks in fluency will be accompanied by muscle tension due to frustration.  The mouth may tighten up or the eyes may blink rapidly.  A child may become so embarrassed by stuttering that they talk as little as possible to avoid the struggle. This may have serious academic and social implications.  The cause of stuttering is unknown, yet widely debated.  Most theories suggest emotional, psychological, or neurological origins.  Psychological treatment aims at improving the self-image of the child and the child’s attitude toward the problem, while other therapies attempt to increase fluency by modifying the rhythm and rate of speech (Boone 316-29, 335-38).

==How many people are affected by communication disorders?==

According to the National Institutes of Health,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} it is estimated that, in the United States,

* between 8 and 10 percent of people have a communication disorder
* 7.5 million people have voice disorders
* cleft palate affects 1 in 700 live births
* 5 percent of children have noticeable communication disorders
* stuttering affects more than 3 million people, mostly children age 2 through 6

According to the United States Department of Education,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} speech, language, and hearing impairments account for 20.1 percent of all Special Education students in the United States.

==Benefits of speech therapy==

Communication skills play an important part in life’s experiences.  In elementary school, children are developing language and learning to read and write.  In order for a child to learn, he has to communicate and interact with his peers and adults.  Spoken language is the basis for written language.  As a child grows and develops, the two types of language interact and build upon each other to improve literacy and language.  This process continues throughout a person’s life.  If a child has a communication disorder, they are often delayed in other areas, such as reading and math.  The child may be very bright but unable to express themselves correctly, and the learning process can be affected negatively.

Speech therapy can help children learn to communicate effectively with others and learn to solve problems and make decisions independently.  Communication with peers and educators is an essential part of a fulfilling educational experience.
Also, children who are able to overcome communication disorders feel a great sense of pride and confidence.  Children who stutter may be withdrawn socially, but with the help of therapy and improved confidence, they can enjoy a fully active social life (''ASHA'').

'''Tefaro''' is a [[Papuan language]] of the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[Papua (province)|Papua]], on the eastern shore of [[Cenderawasih Bay]].

Tefaro is lexically similar to the [[East Geelvink Bay languages]] and presumably belongs in that family, but is too poorly attested to be sure.

[[File:Three kings or three gods.jpg|thumb|right|This part of a 12th-century Swedish tapestry has been interpreted to show, from left to right, the one-eyed [[Odin]], the hammer-wielding [[Thor]] and [[Freyr]] holding up wheat. Terje Leiren  believes this grouping corresponds closely to the trifunctional division.]]

The '''trifunctional hypothesis''' of prehistoric [[Proto-Indo-European society]] postulates a tripartite ideology ("''idéologie tripartite''") reflected in the existence of three classes or castes—[[clergy|priests]], [[warrior]]s, and [[commoners]] (farmers or tradesmen)—corresponding to the three functions of the [[sacred|sacral]], the [[war|martial]] and the [[economic]], respectively. The trifunctional thesis is primarily associated with the [[French people|French]] [[mythography|mythographer]] [[Georges Dumézil]],&lt;ref&gt;According to Jean Boissel, the first description of Indo-European trifunctionalism was by Gobineau, not by Dumézil. ([[Bruce Lincoln|Lincoln]], 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;268, cited below).&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed it in 1929 in the book ''Flamen-Brahman'',&lt;ref name="Flamen-Brahman" /&gt; and  later in ''Mitra-Varuna''.&lt;ref name="Mitra-Varuna" /&gt;

==Three-way division==
According to [[Georges Dumézil|Dumézil]] (1898-1986), [[Proto-Indo-European society]] comprised three main groups corresponding to three distinct functions:&lt;ref name="Flamen-Brahman"&gt;Dumézil, G. (1929). ''Flamen-Brahman''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitra-Varuna"&gt;Dumézil, G. (1940). ''Mitra-Varuna'', Presses universitaires de France.
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sovereignty]], which fell into two distinct and complementary sub-parts: 
:* one formal, juridical and priestly but worldly; 
:* the other powerful, unpredictable, and also priestly but rooted in the supernatural world. 
* [[Military]], connected with force, the [[military]] and [[war]].
* [[agriculture|Productivity]], [[pastoralism|herding]], [[agriculture|farming]] and [[crafts]]; ruled by the other two. 

In the [[Proto-Indo-European mythology]] each [[social group]] had its own [[deity|god]] or family of gods to represent it and the function of the god or gods matched the function of the group. Many such divisions occur in the history of Indo-European societies:
* Southern Russia: [[Bernard Sergent]] associates the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]] with certain archaeological cultures in Southern [[Russia]] and reconstructs an Indo-European religion based upon the tripartite functions.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Sergent, ''Les Indo-Européens - Histoire, langues, mythes'',  Payot, 1995 {{ISBN|2-228-88956-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Early Germanic society: The supposed division between the [[Germanic king|king]], [[earl|nobility]] and regular freemen in early [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] society.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil, Georges.

Berkeley: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-03507-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Norse mythology: [[Odin]] (sovereignty), [[Týr]] (law and justice), the [[Vanir]] (fertility).{{sfn|Turville-Petre|1964|p=103}}{{sfn|Polomé|1970|p=58—59}}{{refn|group=note|Terje Leiren discerns another grouping of three Norse gods that may correspond to the trifunctional division: [[Odin]] as the patron of priests and magicians, [[Thor]] of warriors, and [[Freyr]] of fertility and farming.&lt;ref&gt;Leiren, Terje I.

* India: The three Hindu castes, the [[Brahmins]] or priests; the [[Kshatriya]], the warriors and military; and the [[Vaishya]], the agriculturalists, cattle rearers and traders. The [[Shudra]], a fourth Indian caste, is a peasant or serf. A 2001 study found that the genetic affinity of Indians to Europeans is proportionate to caste rank, the upper castes being most similar to Europeans whereas lower castes are more like Asians. The researchers believe that the Indo-European speakers entered India from the Northwest, mixing with or displacing [[proto-Dravidian]] speakers, and may have established a caste system with themselves primarily in higher castes.&lt;ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=April 2012}}
Supporters of the hypothesis include scholars such as [[Émile Benveniste]], [[Bernard Sergent]] and [[Iaroslav Lebedynsky]], who concludes that "the basic idea seems proven in a convincing way".&lt;ref&gt;[[Iaroslav Lebedynsky|Lebedynsky, I.]]. (2006). ''Les Indo-Européens'', éditions Errance, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis was embraced outside the field of [[Indo-European studies]] by some mythographers, anthropologists, and historians such as [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Marshall Sahlins]], [[Rodney Needham]], [[Jean-Pierre Vernant]] and [[Georges Duby]].&lt;ref name="Theorizing myth"&gt;[[Bruce Lincoln|Lincoln, B.]] (1999).

On the other hand, Allen&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2007/2007-10-53.html Allen, N. J. ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'' 2007.10.53]&lt;/ref&gt; concludes that the tripartite division may be an artefact, a [[selection effect]] rather than an organizing principle used in the societies themselves. Benjamin W. Fortson reports&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin W. Fortson. Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction p.&amp;nbsp;32&lt;/ref&gt; a sense that Dumézil blurred the lines between the three functions and the examples that he gave often had contradictory characteristics, causing detractors&lt;ref&gt;Gonda, J.

John Brough surmises that societal divisions are common outside of Indo-European societies as well, and consequently the hypothesis has only limited utility in illuminating prehistoric Indo-European society.&lt;ref&gt;Lindow, J. (2002). ''Norse mythology: a guide to the Gods, heroes, rituals, and beliefs'', p.&amp;nbsp;32. Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-515382-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cristiano Grottanelli states that while Dumézilian trifunctionalism may be seen in modern and medieval contexts, its projection onto earlier cultures is mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;Grottanelli, Cristiano. Dumézil and the Third Function. In ''Myth and Method''.&lt;/ref&gt; Belier is strongly critical.&lt;ref&gt;Belier, W. W. (1991). ''Decayed Gods: Origin and Development of Georges Dumézil's Idéologie Tripartite'', Leiden.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis has been criticised by historians [[Carlo Ginzburg]], [[Arnaldo Momigliano]]&lt;ref&gt;Wolin, Richard. ''The seduction of unreason: the intellectual romance with fascism'', p.&amp;nbsp;344&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bruce Lincoln]]&lt;ref name="aryan_idols"&gt;Arvidsson, Stefan. ''Aryan idols: Indo-European mythology as ideology and science'', p.&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/ref&gt; as being based on Dumézil's sympathies with the political right.

'''''World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War''''' is a [[2006 in literature|2006]] [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] [[horror novel]] written by American author [[Max Brooks]]. The novel is [[Epistolary novel|a collection of individual accounts]] narrated by an agent of the [[United Nations]] Postwar Commission, following the devastating global conflict against the [[Zombie (fictional)|zombie]] [[Epidemic|plague]]. Other passages record a decade-long desperate struggle, as experienced by people of various nationalities. The personal accounts also describe the resulting social, political, religious, and environmental changes.

''World War Z'' is a follow-up to Brooks' "survival manual", ''[[The Zombie Survival Guide]]'' ([[2003 in literature|2003]]), but its tone is much more serious. It was inspired by ''[[The Good War|The Good War: An Oral History of World War Two]]'' ([[1984 in literature|1984]]) by [[Studs Terkel]], and by the zombie films of [[George A. Romero]]. Brooks used ''World War Z'' to comment on government ineptitude and U.S. [[isolationism]], while also examining [[survivalism]] and uncertainty. The novel was a commercial hit and was praised by most critics.

Its audiobook version, performed by a full cast including [[Alan Alda]], [[Mark Hamill]], and [[John Turturro]], won an [[Audie Award]] in 2007. A [[World War Z (film)|film with the same name as the novel]], directed by [[Marc Forster]] and starring [[Brad Pitt]], was released in 2013.

== Plot== &lt;!-- don't add any commentary, original research or otherwise, and keep it short --&gt;

The story is told in the form of a series of interviews conducted by the narrator, [[Max Brooks]], an agent of the [[United Nations]] Postwar Commission. Although the exact origin of the plague is unknown, a young boy from a village in [[Chongqing]], [[China]] is identified as the plague's official [[Index case|patient zero]]. The plague spreads to various nations by human trafficking, refugees and the black market organ trade. Initially these nations are able to cover up their smaller outbreaks, until a much larger outbreak in [[South Africa]] brings the plague to public attention.

As the infection spreads, [[Israel]] abandons the [[Palestinian territories]] and initiates a nationwide [[protective sequestration|''cordon sanitaire'']], closing its borders to everyone except uninfected Jews and Palestinians. The [[United States]] does little to prepare because of its overconfidence in its ability to suppress any threat. Although [[United States special operations forces|special forces]] teams contain initial outbreaks, a widespread effort never starts: the nation is deprived of political will by "[[brushfire war]]s", and a widely distributed and marketed [[placebo]] [[vaccine]], Phalanx, creates a false sense of security.

After a journalist reveals that Phalanx does nothing to prevent zombification, a period known as the "Great Panic" begins. Pakistan and Iran destroy each other in a [[nuclear war]] over Pakistani refugees entering Iran. After zombies overrun [[New York City]], the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] sets up a high-profile defense in the nearby city of [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]]. The "Battle of Yonkers" is a disaster; modern weapons and tactics prove ineffective against zombies, which have no self-preservation instincts, feel no pain, and can only be stopped if shot through the head. The unprepared and demoralized soldiers are routed on live television. Other countries suffer similarly disastrous defeats, and human civilization teeters on the brink of collapse.

In South Africa, the government adopts a contingency plan drafted by [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]]-era intelligence consultant Paul Redeker, known as the Redeker Plan. It calls for the establishment of small sanctuaries, leaving large groups of survivors abandoned in special zones as human baits in order to distract the undead and allowing those within the main safe zone time to regroup and recuperate. Governments worldwide assume similar plans. As zombies freeze solid in extreme cold, many civilians in North America flee to the wildernesses of [[northern Canada]] and the [[Arctic]], where eleven million people die of starvation and [[hypothermia]]. Several astronauts stranded aboard the [[ISS]] witness the profound environmental impact as most of humanity resorts to burning wood and trash for warmth.

After the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] relocates to [[Hawaii]], the military abandons the eastern United States and establishes safe zones west of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. All aspects of civilian life are devoted to supporting the war effort; people with skills such as carpentry and construction find themselves more valuable than people with managerial skills.

Seven years after the outbreak began, a conference is held off the coast of [[Honolulu]], aboard the decommissioned {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|6}}, where the new [[United Nations]] headquarters are located. Most of the world's leaders argue that they can outlast the zombie plague if they stay in their safe zones while the zombies  rot away. However, the [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] argues for going on the offensive, and a general vote results in most countries either voting "no" or "abstain" while the remainder decide to attack. Determined to lead by example, the U.S. military reinvents itself to meet the specific strategic requirements of fighting the undead. Backed by a resurgent U.S. wartime economy, the military begins the three-year-long process of retaking the [[contiguous United States]] from both the undead swarms and groups of hostile human survivors. Other nations that voted to attack go about their own offensives: Britain takes a slow-but-steady approach, taking until five years after the official end of the war to finish clearing London, while France, set on restoring its pride and reputation after [[Vichy France|embarrassments]] and [[Dien Bien Phu Battle|defeats]] going back to World War II, charges headlong against the undead, its armed forces displaying extreme valor at an extraordinarily high cost. An unnamed British Army general comments as the war ends that there are "enough dead heroes for the end of time."

Ten years after the official end of the zombie war, millions of zombies are still active, mainly on the ocean floor or on [[snow line]] islands. The United Nations fields a large military force to eliminate them. [[Cuba]] has become a democracy and hosts the world's most thriving economy. [[Tibet]] is freed from Chinese rule, which in turn becomes a democracy as well, and hosts [[Lhasa]] as the world's most populated city. Following a religious revolution, Russia is now an expansionist [[theocracy]] and adopts a repopulation programme. [[North Korea]] is completely empty, with the entire population presumed to have disappeared into underground bunkers or been wiped out in the outbreak. [[Iceland]] has been depopulated and remains the world's most heavily infested country.

== Development ==
Brooks designed ''World War Z'' to follow the "laws" set up in his earlier work, ''[[The Zombie Survival Guide]]'' (2003), and explained that the guide may exist in the novel's [[fictional universe]].&lt;ref name=eat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eatmybrains.com/showfeature.php?id=55 |title=Exclusive Interview: Max Brooks on World War Z |work=Eat My Brains! |date=October 20, 2006 |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zombies of ''The Zombie Survival Guide'' are human bodies reanimated by an incurable virus (Solanum), devoid of intelligence, desirous solely of consuming living flesh, and cannot be killed unless the brain is destroyed. It is said that the undead contain a black, foul pus-like liquid instead of blood. Decomposition will eventually set in, but this process takes longer than for an uninfected body and can be slowed even further by effects such as freezing. Although zombies do not tire and are as strong as the humans they infect (though they appear to be slightly stronger due to lack of normal restraint), they are slow-moving and are incapable of planning or cooperation in their attacks. Zombies usually reveal their presence by moaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title='The Zombie Survival Guide' With Max Brooks |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2003/10/26/DI2005033114558.html |work=Washington Post |date=October 30, 2003 |accessdate=April 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brook-right Romero left.JPG|thumb|[[Max Brooks]] (right) with [[George Romero]] at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|SDCC]] 2007]]

Brooks discussed the cultural influences on the novel. He claimed inspiration from ''[[The Good War|"The Good War": An Oral History of World War Two]]'' ([[1984 in literature|1984]]) by [[Studs Terkel]], stating: "[Terkel's book is] an oral history of World War II. I read it when I was a teenager and it's sat with me ever since. When I sat down to write ''World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War'', I wanted it to be in the vein of an oral history."&lt;ref name="eat" /&gt; Brooks also cited renowned zombie film director [[George A. Romero]] as an influence and criticized the ''[[The Return of the Living Dead|Return of the Living Dead]]'' films: "They cheapen zombies, make them silly and campy. They've done for the living dead what the old [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' TV show]] did for the [[Batman|Dark Knight]]."&lt;ref name="eat" /&gt; Brooks acknowledged making several references to popular culture in the novel, including one to alien robot franchise ''[[Transformers]]'', but declined to identify the others so that readers could discover them independently.&lt;ref name="eat" /&gt;

Brooks conducted copious research while writing ''World War Z''. The technology, politics, economics, culture, and military tactics were based on a variety of reference books and consultations with expert sources.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; Brooks also cites the U.S. Army as a reference on firearm statistics.&lt;ref name=comic-con&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlsEBBZx8g8 |title=Max Brooks Talks pt. 1, Comic-Con 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Clear}}

Many U.S. characters blame the United States' inability to counter the zombie threat on low confidence in their government due to conflicts in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="sh" /&gt;

Brooks shows his particular dislike of government [[bureaucracy]]. For example, one character in the novel tries to justify lying about the zombie outbreak to avoid widespread panic, while at the same time failing to develop a solution for fear of arousing public ire.&lt;ref name=dc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://host.madison.com/daily-cardinal/news/brooks-redefines-the-zombie-genre-in-wwz/article_b57a0349-5688-5482-aba1-cf4d8f98fa6c.html |title=Brooks redefines the zombie genre in WWZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eagle&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.www.theeagleonline.com/media/storage/paper666/news/2006/10/02/TheScene/Brooks.Puts.Brains.In.Print.For.Zombie.Fanatics-2319449.shtml |title=Brooks puts brains in print for zombie fanatics |accessdate=September 9, 2008 |last=Utter |first=Alden |date=October 2, 2006 |work=The Eagle |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828013829/http://media.www.theeagleonline.com/media/storage/paper666/news/2006/10/02/TheScene/Brooks.Puts.Brains.In.Print.For.Zombie.Fanatics-2319449.shtml |archive-date=August 28, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also criticized [[United States non-interventionism|U.S. isolationism]]:

{{quote box|I love my country enough to admit that one of our national flaws is isolationism. I wanted to combat that in ''World War Z'' and maybe give my fellow Americans a window into the political and cultural workings of other nations. Yes, in ''World War Z'' some nations come out as winners and some as losers, but isn't that the case in real life as well? I wanted to base my stories on the historical actions of the countries in question, and if it offends some individuals, then maybe they should reexamine their own nation's history.&lt;ref name="eat" /&gt;}} {{Clear}}

=== Themes ===

==== Survivalism ====
[[Survivalism]] and [[Disaster preparedness|disaster preparation]] are prevalent themes in the novel. Several interviews, especially those from the United States, focus on policy changes designed to train the surviving U.S. population to fight the zombies and rebuild the country.&lt;ref name="sh" /&gt; For example, when cities were made to be as efficient as possible in order to fight the zombies, the plumber could hold a higher status than the former CEO. The ultra-rich hid in their homes, which had been turned into fortified compounds, when they were overwhelmed by others trying to get in, it became a mass slaughter. Throughout the novel, characters demonstrate the physical and mental requirements needed to survive a disaster.&lt;ref name=EW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1535157,00.html |title=Book Review World War Z |accessdate=September 19, 2008 |last=Cruz |first=Gilber |date=September 15, 2006 |work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks described the large amount of research needed to find optimal methods for fighting a worldwide zombie outbreak. He also pointed out that the U.S. likes the zombie genre because it believes that it can survive anything with the right tools and talent.&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/10/03/DI2006100300686.html |title=Zombie Wars |accessdate=September 19, 2008 |date=October 6, 2006 |work=Washington Post | first=Max | last=Brooks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fear and uncertainty ====
Brooks considers the theme of uncertainty central to the zombie genre. He believes that zombies allow people to deal with their own anxiety about the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/features/preview-max-brooks-festival-of-the-living-dead-barbican-london-422481.html |title=Preview: Max Brooks' Festival Of The (Living) Dead! Barbican, London |accessdate=September 19, 2008 |last=Cripps |first=Charlotte |date=November 1, 2006 |work=The Independent |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks has expressed a deep fear of zombies:

{{quote box|They scare me more than any other fictional creature out there because they break all the rules. [[Werewolf|Werewolves]] and [[vampire]]s and [[mummy|mummies]] and [[Jaws (film)|giant sharks]], you have to go look for them. My attitude is if you go looking for them, no sympathy. But zombies come to you. Zombies don't act like a predator; they act like a virus, and that is the core of my terror. A predator is intelligent by nature, and knows not to overhunt its feeding ground. A virus will just continue to spread, infect and consume, no matter what happens. It's the mindlessness behind it.&lt;ref name="PW" /&gt;}} {{Clear}}

This mindlessness is connected to the context in which Brooks was writing. He declared: "at this point we're pretty much living in an irrational time", full of human suffering and lacking reason or logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6359995.html?nid=2286 |title=Three Answers: Max Brooks |accessdate=January 15, 2009 |last=Donahue |first=Dick |date=August 7, 2006 |work=Interview |publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106051656/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6359995.html?nid=2286 |archivedate=November 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked in a subsequent interview about how he would compare terrorists with zombies, Brooks said:

{{quote box|The lack of rational thought has always scared me when it came to zombies, the idea that there is no middle ground, no room for negotiation. That has always terrified me. Of course that applies to terrorists, but it can also apply to a hurricane, or [[flu pandemic]], or the potential earthquake that I grew up with living in [[Los Angeles|L.A]]. Any kind of mindless extremism scares me, and we're living in some pretty extreme times.&lt;ref name="WP" /&gt;}} {{Clear}}

During an appearance on ''[[George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight]]'', Brooks' friend and contemporary novelist [[Chuck Palahniuk]] revealed that a major influence on ''World War Z'' was the deterioration and death via cancer of Brooks' mother, [[Anne Bancroft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Molb1Uvk4y8|title=Chuck Palahniuk On Death, Grief, World War Z And Using Metaphor In A "Really Overblown Way"|publisher=YouTube|first1=Strombo|date=October 31, 2013|access-date=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Palahniuk, Brooks' attempt to find the right oncologists to treat Bancroft parallels the mission in the novel to find a cure for the zombie plague. Brooks subsequently dedicated to novel to Bancroft.

== Reception ==
Reviews for the novel have been generally positive. Gilbert Cruz of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the novel an "A" rating, commenting that the novel shared with great zombie stories the use of a central metaphor, describing it as "an addictively readable oral history."&lt;ref name="EW" /&gt; [[Steven H. Silver]] identified Brooks' international focus as the novel's greatest strength and commented favorably on Brooks' ability to create an appreciation for the work needed to combat a global zombie outbreak. Silver's only complaint was with "Good-Byes"—the final chapter—in which characters get a chance to give a final closing statement. Silver felt that it was not always apparent who the sundry, undifferentiated characters were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsite.com/12a/ww237.htm |title=World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War Review |accessdate=September 19, 2008 |last=Silver |first= Steven H. |year=2006 |work=SF Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Eagle'' described the book as being "unlike any other zombie tale" as it is "sufficiently terrifying for most readers, and not always in a blood-and-guts way, either."&lt;ref name="Eagle" /&gt; Keith Phipps of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' stated that the format of the novel makes it difficult for it to develop momentum, but found the novel's individual episodes gripping.&lt;ref name="AV" /&gt; Patrick Daily of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' said the novel transcends the "silliness" of ''The Zombie Survival Guide'' by "touching on deeper, more somber aspects of the human condition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://events.chicagoreader.com/events/Event?oid=852597 |title=Max Brooks |accessdate=October 28, 2008 |last=Daily |first=Patrick |work=Chicago Reader }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] Chicago'', Pete Coco declared that "[b]ending horror to the form of alternative history would have been novel in and of itself. Doing so in the mode of [[Studs Terkel]] might constitute brilliance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/chicago/articles/books/23231/world-war-z |title=Review: World War Z |accessdate=September 19, 2008 |last=Coco |first=Pete |date=October 11, 2008 |work=Time Out Chicago |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908021532/http://www.timeout.com/chicago/articles/books/23231/world-war-z |archive-date=September 8, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ron Currie Jr.]] named ''World War Z'' one of his favorite apocalyptic novels and praised Brooks for illustrating "the tacit agreement between writer and reader that is essential to the success of stories about the end of the world ... [both] agree to pretend that this is not fiction, that in fact the horrific tales of a war between humans and zombies are based in reality."&lt;ref name="RC" /&gt; Drew Taylor of the ''[[Fairfield County Weekly]]'' credited ''World War Z'' with making zombies more popular in mainstream society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bargainbookplace.com/the-hunt-for-real-october/ |title=The Hunt for Real October |accessdate=October 30, 2008 |last=Taylor |first=Drew |date=October 28, 2008 |work=Fairfield Count Weekly }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hardcover version of ''World War Z'' spent four weeks on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]], peaking at number nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DEEDA1530F936A25753C1A9609C8B63 |title=Best Sellers: October 15, 2006 |accessdate=October 2, 2008 |date=October 15, 2006 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/index.asp?layout=pwkprofileTitle&amp;iMarketID=2&amp;iReleaseID=369153&amp;view=iReleaseID&amp;text=369153&amp;vchProductTitle=World+War+Z&amp;iContributorID=611551|title=Title Profile: ''World War Z'' |accessdate=January 15, 2009 |work=[[Publishers Weekly]]}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 2011, according to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', ''World War Z'' had sold one million copies in all formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brooks's 'World War Z' Hits Sales Milestone |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/49456-brooks-s-world-war-z-hits-sales-milestone.html |date=November 10, 2011 |publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Audiobook ==
[[Random House]] published an [[abridgement|abridged]] [[audiobook]] in 2007, directed by John Mc Elroy and produced by Dan Zitt, with sound editing by Charles De Montebello. The book is read by Brooks but includes other actors taking on the roles of the many individual characters who are interviewed in the novel. Brooks' previous career in [[voice acting]] and [[voice-over]] work meant he could recommend a large number of the cast members.&lt;ref name=PW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6376416.html |title=Zombies Spreading like a Virus: PW Talks with Max Brooks |accessdate=January 15, 2009 |author=Lance Eaton |date=October 2, 2006 |work=Interview |publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106001755/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6376416.html |archivedate=November 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2013, [[Random House Audio]] released a lengthier audiobook titled ''World War Z: The Complete Edition (Movie Tie-in Edition): An Oral History of the Zombie War''. It contains the entirety of the original, abridged audiobook, as well as new recordings of each missing segment.

'''*''' The Complete Edition

=== Reception ===
In her review of the audiobook for ''[[Strange Horizons]]'', Siobhan Carroll called the story "gripping" and found the listening experience evocative of [[Orson Welles]]'s famous radio narration of ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]'' (broadcast October 30, 1938). Carroll had mixed opinions on the voice acting, commending it as "solid and understated, mercifully free of 'special effects' and 'scenery chewing' overall", but lamenting what she perceived as undue cheeriness on the part of Max Brooks and inauthenticity in Steve Park's Chinese accent.&lt;ref name="sh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2006/10/world_war_z_an_.shtml |title=World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War by Max Brooks |accessdate=September 19, 2008 |last=Carroll |first=Siobhan |date=October 31, 2006 |work=Strange Horizons}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' also criticized Brooks' narration, but found that the rest of the "all-star cast deliver their parts with such fervor and intensity that listeners cannot help but empathize with these characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6376146.html |title=Audio Reviews: Week of 10/2/2006 |accessdate=January 15, 2009 |date=October 2, 2006 |work=Book review |publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106011734/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6376146.html |archivedate=November 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' concerning the mistakes producers make on publishing audiobooks, Nate DiMeo used ''World War Z'' as an example of dramatizations whose full casts contributed to making them "great listens" and described the book as a "smarter-than-it-has-any-right-to-be zombie novel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2200177/ |title=Read Me a Story, Brad Pitt |accessdate=September 20, 2008 |last=DiMeo |first=Nate |date=September 18, 2008 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''World War Z'' audiobook won the 2007 [[Audie Award]] for Multi-Voiced Performance and was nominated for Audiobook of the Year.&lt;ref name="pr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audiopub.org/files/public/Audieswinnersrelease.pdf |title= Audie Award press release |accessdate=November 12, 2007 |publisher=Audio Publishers Association |year=2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070719083737/http://www.audiopub.org/files/public/Audieswinnersrelease.pdf |archivedate=July 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.audiopub.org/audies07winners.asp?page=1 |title=Audies Gala 2007 Winners and nominees |publisher=Audio Publishers Association |accessdate=April 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620142147/http://www.audiopub.org/audies07winners.asp?page=1 |archivedate=June 20, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film adaptation ==
{{Main|World War Z (film)}}
&lt;!-- This section is a summary of the main film article. Information relating to the film should first be included in the film article, not here --&gt;

In June 2006, [[Paramount Studios]] secured the film rights for ''World War Z'' for [[Brad Pitt]]'s production company, [[Plan B Entertainment]], to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117945332.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |title=Par, Plan B raise 'Zombie' |accessdate=November 12, 2007 |work=Variety |last=LaPorte |first=Nicole |author2=Fleming, Michael  |date=June 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screenplay was written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]], with [[Marc Forster]] directing and Pitt starring as the main character, UN employee Gerry Lane.&lt;ref name=JMS&gt;{{Cite news| last=Marshall |first=Rick |title=J.

Despite being the draft that got the film green-lit, Straczynski's script was tossed aside. Production was to begin at the start of 2009, but was delayed while the script was completely re-written by [[Matthew Michael Carnahan]] to set the film in the present, leaving behind much of the book's premise to make it more of an action film. In a 2012 interview, Brooks stated the film now had nothing in common with the novel other than the title.&lt;ref name=BrooksMU&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Dennis|title=Max Brooks discusses World War Z, the movie|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QEq-ud0NIc|work=Mansfield University - MU on YouTube|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming commenced mid-2011, and the film was released in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/paramount-release-one-shot-world-war-z-release-brad-pitt-tom-cruise-299280 |title=Paramount Release Shakeup: Tom Cruise's 'One Shot' to Christmas; Brad Pitt's 'World War Z' to Summer |last=McClintock |first=Pamela |date=13 March 2012 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
