== Location ==
The collision between the oil tanker and the cargo vessel occurred at the Shela River in Sundarbans, [[Khulna Division]], Bangladesh.

== Casualties and losses ==
[[File:The oil Tank.jpg|thumb|Salvaged oil tanker]]

Seven crew members of the sunken ship managed to swim ashore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India on alert after oil spill in Sundarbans|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/12/us-india-sundarbans-idUSKBN0JQ1BZ20141212|accessdate=17 December 2014|work=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the captain of the ship, Mokhlesur Rahman, died, and his body was recovered a few kilometers away from the spot where the ship sank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Callousness cause for Sundarban environmental disaster|url=http://www.observerbd.com/2014/12/17/61220.php|accessdate=17 December 2014|work=observerbd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts estimated that {{currency|1000000000|BDT}} was lost as a result of the sinking of the oil-tanker.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.clickittefaq.com/more-stories/tk-100-cr-loss-feared-sundarban-oil-spill/|title = TK 100 cr. loss feared from Sundarban oil spill|last = |first = |date = |work = [[The Daily Ittefaq]]|accessdate = 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residents of the surrounding area are at a health risk. 
The government of Bangladesh told the local residents to collect the oil and sell it to the [[Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation]]. The local oil collectors faced health risks and various skin diseases, including hair fallout if furnace oil mixed with water contacts a person's face or hair.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Environmental issues ==

[[File:Golpata tree oil covered.jpg|thumb|Oil covered trees]]
Environmentalists warned that the event was an ecological "catastrophe",&lt;ref name=":132"/&gt; as the spill occurred at a protected area where rare dolphins were present.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Experts expressed concerns that the oil spill will hamper the well-being of the aquatic organisms in the area. Wildlife near the river are at a risk of death, because the smell of oil makes breathing difficult.&lt;ref name=":722"&gt;{{cite news|title=Oil spill in Sundarbans threatens food cycle|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/57215/Oil-spill-in-Sundarbans-threatens-food-cycle|accessdate=19 December 2014|work=[[Prothom Alo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some images indicate that the disaster killed some animals.&lt;ref name="Global Voices Online"/&gt;

On 13 December 2014, a dead Irrawaddy dolphin was seen floating on the Harintana-Tembulbunia channel of the Shela River.&lt;ref name=":622"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2014/dec/14/first-dead-dolphin-spotted|title = First dead dolphin spotted|last = Siddique|first = Abu Bakar|date = |work = The Dhaka Tribune|accessdate = 18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not confirmed that the dolphin's death was caused by the oil spill. According to the local residents, few dolphins have been seen in the area since the oil spill.
Oriental small-clawed otter (''Amblonyx cinereus'') aquatic carnivore animal lives in the aquatic ecosystem of Sundarbans.&lt;ref&gt;Bautista H. and Rahman K. M. M. (2016). Review On the Sundarbans Delta Oil Spill: Effects On Wildlife and Habitats. International Research Journal, 1(43), Part 2, pp: 93-96. DOI: 10.18454/IRJ.2016.43.143&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 December 2014, two dead [[otter]]s were recovered from the Shela River by forest department workers. An [[autopsy]] of the two otters confirmed that they had died from ingesting oil. The otter is considered to be an [[endangered species]], and has been included in the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] endangered list.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/57260/Two-otters-dead-in-oil-spill|title = Two otters dead in oil spill|last = Mahmud|first = Iftekhar|date = |work = [[Prothom Alo]]|accessdate = 22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team of forest department workers saw [[crocodile]]s, [[monitor lizard]]s and many other animals smeared with oil at the Chandpai range of the Sundarbans.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The oil spill is also posing a major threat to the forest's food cycle. Reports from various sources showed that the microorganisms, the primary level of the food cycle, are dying.&lt;ref name=":722"/&gt; The [[United Nations]] expressed deep concern over the oil spill, urging the government of Bangladesh to impose a "complete ban" on commercial vessels moving through the forest.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/18/un-sends-team-to-clean-up-sunderbans-oil-spill-in-bangladesh|title = UN sends team to clean up Sunderbans oil spill in Bangladesh|last = |first = |date = 18 December 2014|work = [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|accessdate = 19 December 2014|publisher = [[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shajahan Khan]], the shipping minister of Bangladesh, told [[Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha]] that he has talked with environmental experts, and they said that there will likely be no major damage as a result of the oil spill.&lt;ref name=":622"/&gt; Researchers said that Khan's claim was "unscientific and misleading".&lt;ref name=":722"/&gt;

Ten species that are at risk as a result of the spill have been listed by [[National Geographic Traveller|The National Geographic Traveler]]. These species are the [[Irrawady dolphin]]s, [[Bengal tiger]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[great egret]]s, [[rhesus macaque]]s, [[northern river terrapin]]s, [[black-capped kingfisher]]s, [[chital]]s, [[saltwater crocodile]]s, and [[horseshoe crab]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2014/dec/20/bnp-probe-sundarbans-oil-spill|title = BNP to probe Sundarbans oil spill|last = |first = |date = |work = The Dhaka Tribune|accessdate = 22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The presence of White Rumped Vulture (''Gyps bengalensis'') over the Sundarbans sky also indicated the large scale death of wild fauna. The secondary
effect of oil spill is always much greater than the primary effects.&lt;ref&gt;Rahman K. M. M. &amp; Rakhimov I. I. (2015). Ecological Effects of Oil Spill on Bangladesh Sundarbans Biodiversity.

==Oil collection==
[[File:Oil collection by local residents of Sundarbans.jpg|thumb|Local residents collecting oil]]

After the spill, primarily [[Bangladeshi]] fishermen began to clean up the oil using sponges and sacks.&lt;ref name=":132"/&gt; [[Padma Oil Company]], a government-owned corporation, bought the oil at a price of 30 takas per litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/12/12/suranjit-peeved-over-sundarbans-oil-spill|title = Suranjit peeved over Sundarbans oil spill|last = |first = |date = |work = [[Bdnews24.com]]|accessdate = 19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bangladeshi navy initially sent four ships to deal with the spill, and planned to use chemicals to disperse the oil,&lt;ref name=":132"/&gt; but the plan was canceled, as there were concerns that dispersing the oil would further damage the ecology and biodiversity of the mangrove forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2014/dec/13/dilly-dallying-delays-clean-sundarbans-spill|title = Dilly dallying delays clean-up of Sundarbans spill|last = |first = |date = |work = The Dhaka Tribune|accessdate = 19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Bangladesh closed the Shela River to all vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-asia/river-route-closed-after-sundarbans-oil-spill/article6683452.ece|title = River route closed after Sundarbans oil spill|last = |first = |date = |work = [[The Hindu]]|accessdate = 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner of the sunken oil tanker, MS Harun &amp; Co., began salvage efforts, assisted by three private rescue vessels. The Bangladesh Forest Department filed a 1 billion taka lawsuit against the owners of the two cargo ships involved in the collision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/12/10/govt-files-tk-1-billion-compensation-suit-for-sundarbans-oil-spill|title = Govt files Tk 1 billion compensation suit for Sundarbans oil spill|last = |first = |date = |work = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 12 January 2015, the government, with the help of local residents, the Bangladesh Navy, and the owner of the oil tanker, had collected {{convert|70000|l|impgal usgal}} of oil.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Bangladesh government said that they do not have the capacity to manage oil spills.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{cite news |title=No capacity to tackle oil spills |url=http://www.hawker.com.bd/news_details.php?news_id=389549 |work=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=16 December 2014 |accessdate=16 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2014/dec/14/india-alert-after-sunderbans-oil-spill|title = India on alert after Sundarbans oil spill|last = |first = |date = |work = The Dhaka Tribune|accessdate = 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Economic Relations Division of the Bangladesh government sent a letter to the United Nation's Bangladesh office on 15 December 2014, asking for help in the oil collection efforts. The United Nations accepted the request, and a team from the [[UNEP]] and [[OCHA]] went to the site of the spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN agrees to help govt contain oil spread|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/57157/Govt-seeks-UN-help-for-Sundarbans|accessdate=17 December 2014|work=[[Prothom Alo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team from the [[United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination]] arrived in the [[Dhaka]] to support the cleanup efforts.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

[[Image:JO200109337.png|thumb|The Law as published in the ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]]'']]

The 2001 '''About-Picard law''' [abu pika:r] (named after French parliament members [[Nicolas About]] and [[Catherine Picard]]), a controversial piece of [[France|French]] legislation, broadly speaking, makes it possible to act against organisations (legal entities) when such organisations have become involved in certain crimes. The law, in its own words, aimed at movements deemed cultic (''mouvements sectaires'') that "undermine human rights and fundamental freedoms".  The law has caused controversy internationally, with some commentators alleging that it infringes [[religious freedom]] while proponents content it reinforces religious freedom.

==Background on Government and Religion in France ==
:{{Main|Status of religious freedom in France}}

[[Freedom of religion]] and [[separation of church and state]] have formed part of the French idea of the state since at least the [[French Revolution]] and in some ways long before, since the 16th century period of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and of the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. Separation of religion and state in France takes the form of ''[[laïcité]]'', by which political power avoids interference in the sphere of religious dogma, and religion avoids interference in public policies. The French understand "freedom of religion" primarily as the freedom of the individual to believe or not to believe what any religion teaches. Also, because of a long history of one single dominating church (the [[Catholic Church]]), the French state sees its duty less in protecting religion from state interference than in protecting the individual from interference by religion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In the wake of the [[Order of the Solar Temple]] murders and suicides, the [[French National Assembly|French Parliament]] established the [[Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France]] to investigate cults. In December 1995 the Commission delivered a report on cults which caused much controversy, some of it due to a list extracted from a report by the [[French National Police]] on purported cults.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp
&lt;/ref&gt; (The Commission assimilated information and analysis from the French police secret service, the [[Direction centrale des renseignements généraux|Renseignements généraux]].)

Following the recommendations of the report, Prime Minister [[Alain Juppé]] set up in 1996 the "Interministerial board of observation of sects", followed in 1998 by the "Interministerial Mission in the Fight Against Sects" ([[Mission interministérielle de lutte contre les sectes|MILS]]). In 2002 the "Interministerial Monitoring Mission Against Sectarian Abuses" ([[MIVILUDES]]) replaced MILS.

Other action of the French government against potential abuses by cults resulted in the passing of the About-Picard law.

== The About-Picard law==

Commentators often refer to the Law 2001-504 of June 12, 2001&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=JUSX9903887L    &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021114222634/http://religionandpolicy.org/show.php?p=1.1.105 approximate translation into English]&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as the About-Picard law, from the name of its ''[[rapporteur]]s'' (parliamentarians who report upon the draft law), [[French Senate|senator]] [[Nicolas About]] ([[Union pour la Démocratie Française|UDF]] center-right party)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.senat.fr/rap/l99-131/l99-131.html
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[French National Assembly|deputy]] [[Catherine Picard]] ([[French Socialist Party|PS]] center-left party).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nat.fr/rapports/r2472.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208022636/http://www.assemblee-nat.fr/rapports/r2472.asp |archivedate=2005-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French parliament adopted the law with broad cross-party support under the government of center-right president [[Jacques Chirac]] and socialist prime minister [[Lionel Jospin]].

'''Article 223-15-2 of Penal code:'''&lt;br /&gt;(Act no. 2001-504 of 12 June 2001, article 10 Official Journal of 13 June 2001 ; Ordinance No. 2000-916 of 19 September 2000, article 3 Official Journal of 22 September 2000, into force 1 January 2002) 
       
« Fraudulently abusing the ignorance or state of weakness of a minor, or of a person whose particular vulnerability, due to age, sickness, infirmity, to a physical or psychological disability or to pregnancy, is apparent or known to the offender, or abusing a person in a state of physical or psychological dependency resulting from serious or repeated pressure or from techniques used to affect his judgement, in order to induce the minor or other person to act or abstain from acting in any way seriously harmful to him, is punished by three years' imprisonment and a fine of € 375,000.
Where the offence is committed by the legal or de facto manager of a group that carries out activities the aim or effect of which is to create, maintain or exploit the psychological or physical dependency of those who participate in them, the penalty is increased to five years' imprisonment and to a fine of € 750,000. »

The additional penalties that natural or legal persons may incur are mentioned in the following articles 223-15-3 and 4.

===Main points ===
Notable new points introduced by the law include:
* In the case of certain crimes, the law extends legal responsibility from individuals to organizations (corporations, associations, and other [[Juristic person|legal entities]]...).
* Courts can order the dissolution of organizations if they or their executives have been found guilty of these crimes.
 
The initial draft of the About-Picard law included the criminalization of "mental manipulation". Many organizations criticised this clause for its vagueness.  [[Minister of Justice (France)|Minister of Justice]] [[Élisabeth Guigou]] pushed for the removal of this clause, which the legislators excluded from the final version of the law. However, the law makes it a crime to defraud a person weakened by illness, old age, etc., but also of a person in a state of ''psychological or physical subjection resulting from grave or reiterated pressures or techniques able to alter judgement''.

=== Application of the law ===
There was one famous application of the law since its adoption: that of [[Arnaud Mussy]], leader of the tiny ''Néo-Phare'' (New Lighthouse) cult. Mussy, who claims that he is the [[Christ]], had announced imminent [[apocalypse]], resulting in the suicide of one of his followers and the attempted suicides of two others, who were severely wounded in 2001. The criminal court in Nantes sentenced him to three years in prison and 90,000 [[French Franc|FF]] damages in November 2004. It ruled that he had "abused fraudulently the state of ignorance and weakness of several persons in the state of bodily or mental dependence".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prevensectes.com/rev0506.htm#6a&lt;/ref&gt; A higher court in Rennes confirmed the sentence in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prevensectes.com/rev0507.htm#12
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the Law ==
:''See [[Status of religious freedom in France]] for expressed concerns about other aspects of French policies with respect to minority religions.''

The French government, when challenged on issues of religious discrimination, states that it has no concern in any way with religious doctrine ''per se''. The government has taken the position that it will deal with the concrete consequences of cult affiliation, especially with respect to children. The government sees this as particularly important in the light of past abuse committed in some criminal cults, such as [[sexual slavery]] and [[mass suicide]].  According to government sources, none of the criteria listed in related government documents on sects discuss [[theology]]; they only focus on the actions and the methods of the groups.

Critics of the law see this as merely a semantic change &lt;!-- change from what? --&gt; and maintain that no empirical studies support claims of the use of techniques of coercive persuasion by NRMs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theology.homestead.com/Papers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions inside France ===
{{See also|Status of religious freedom in France#Complaints by minority religions and groups|l1=Status of religious freedom in France: Complaints by minority religions}}

The [[Bishop of Soissons]], [[Marcel Herriot]], defended the law on 25 June 2000 asserting it was necessary to protect by law persons, family, society and religions themselves from sects that are violating fundamental freedoms and human dignity.

Some groups claim that the Parliamentary Reports and the controversy surrounding the About-Picard law have created an unhealthy atmosphere, resulting in minority religious groups suffering from excessively strict, uneven, or even abusive discrimination in the application of other laws by local authorities. For example, the group ''Coordination des Associations et Particuliers pour la Liberté de Conscience'' (Co-ordination of Associations and Individuals for Freedom of Conscience) requested the repeal of the law, asserting laws should not specify groups as "sectarian" or "cultic" as, in a democracy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coordiap.com/Gtemo01.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However, an [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] report has described this group as a partisan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc05/EDOC10470.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219055614/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc05/EDOC10470.htm |archivedate=2005-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The umbrella association of French [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] sued the French government in the [[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]] in case #53430/99, alleging that the publication of the parliamentary reports and the enactment of the About-Picard law infringed its civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=671525&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=1132746FF1FE2A468ACCBCD1763D4D8149&lt;/ref&gt; The court rejected the application.

In other cases (#53934/00), the Court affirmed that the publication of a Parliamentary Report disparaging to some groups did not constitute an infringement of human rights, even though these groups were not given a [[legal recourse]] for the removal of their name from the report.&lt;ref&gt;http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=682416&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=1132746FF1FE2A468ACCBCD1763D4D8149
&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights activists dubbed the law "un délit d'opinion" (a thought crime).&lt;ref&gt;The New Heretics of France: Minority Religions, la Republique, and the Government-Sponsored "War on Sects" Susan J. Palmer 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statements by the Council of Europe ===

Forty different religious and human-rights groups submitted a petition to the [[Council of Europe]]'s Parliamentary Assembly. This petition led to a report (Report 9612 of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of Europe) containing an expert paper by Swiss professor Joseph Voyame, who concluded:
:''"On the basis of the foregoing, I conclude that the French Law of 12 June 2001 is not incompatible with the Council of Europe’s values."''
Voyame deduces that the law clearly responds to a need, that the measure of dissolution appears radical, but also effective and reliable, and that judicial guarantees surround it. He also discusses the title with its mentioning of "cultic groups", but comes to the conclusion that the uncertainty regarding the definition has little importance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The title is undeniably part of the [Act], but has no legislative authority in itself. Although it may be useful for the purposes of interpretation, it cannot be used in making a ruling that runs counter to a clear legal provision [...] As we will see, [Sections] 1, 19 and 20 of this [Act] identify the targeted incorporated organizations and groups with the greatest possible precision. It is these standard-setting texts that are decisive.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report discussed several objections regarding the word "secte" (cult):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... the word ‘sect’ has taken on an extremely pejorative connotation. In the eyes of the public, it stigmatises movements whose activities are dangerous either for their members or for society. Today, the world contains dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of groups both large and small, all with various beliefs and observances, which are not necessarily dangerous or prejudicial to freedom. It is true that among these groups are some which have committed criminal acts. Nevertheless, the existence of a few dangerous movements is not enough to condemn all the rest (...)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The act for the most part simply reiterates existing provisions in the Criminal Code, the Code of Consumption, the Code of Public Health and the New Code of Civil Procedure and does so for a precise purpose in conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights, as we have just seen. Consequently, even if it had been possible to achieve the same objective by recourse to existing provisions, there is nothing to prevent the passing of an act which has the advantage of grouping together all the provisions necessary to achieve that objective.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 2002, the Council of Europe passed a resolution inviting the Government of France to reconsider the About-Picard Law and to clarify certain terms in the law. It referred, however, to the Recommendation 1412 (1999) on the illegal activities of sects, where it had concluded that it was ''"essential to ensure that the activities of groups, whatever religious, esoteric or spiritual description they adopted, were in keeping with the principles of democratic societies and, in particular, the provisions of Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)."'' and it stated that ''"ultimately, should the case arise, it will be for the [[European Court of Human Rights]], and it alone, to say whether or not this law is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights."'' .

=== Reactions outside of France===
In an open letter dated June 2000 to Alain Vivien about religious freedom in France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df= 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aaron Rhodes]], Executive Director of the [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights]] (IHFHR), wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We question ourselves how such a law can claim to guarantee human rights when it goes against the rights of association, expression, religion and conscience; when it puts in danger the right of minorities and maintains prejudices that are so incompatible with the concept of tolerance intrinsic to that of human rights. France must deal with its responsibilities and obligations as a signatory for the International Conventions and respect the European laws and its interpretation by the Court of Strasbourg, before one of its citizens become a victim of discrimination due to the law which you propose.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alain Vivien responded: "[The IHFHR] seems today to have passed into the hands of [[Scientology|Scientologists]] and perhaps other transnational organizations". [[Aaron Rhodes]] then acknowledged that the Moscow office of the IHFHR had received funding from the [[Church of Scientology]] to print a leaflet about religious freedom in Russia, and voiced his astonishment at the charge. Rhodes voiced his embarrassment: "[...]for you and your fellow French citizens by your recourse to methods of denunciations and insinuations that remind us of those sometimes used by totalitarian and backward regimes."{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

====Reaction of the government of the United States of America ====
Some groups sought the help of their governments to fight what they saw as religious intolerance in France.&lt;ref&gt;http://bahai-library.com/newspapers/2000/090500-4.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New Heretics of France: Minority Religions, la Republique, and the Government-Sponsored "War on Sects" Susan J. Palmer 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the [[Church of Scientology]] utilised pressure groups against the French government, and had some success with the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration, which repeatedly brought the matter before the French government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antisectes.net/monde-usa.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193106/http://www.antisectes.net/monde-usa.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to pastor [[Jean-Arnold de Clermont]], head of the French Protestant federation and himself a strong critic of the first draft of the law, the complaints originating in the United States concerning religious freedom in France were largely based on biased, poor information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apologeticsindex.org/news1/an010521-20.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a newspaper article published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in June 2000,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,331743,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; the French government considered American interference regarding religious freedom in France as unwarranted meddling by the US government in France's internal affairs. Paul Webster wrote that President [[Jacques Chirac]] told Clinton that religious freedom would no longer be a subject for bilateral presidential talks, "in the light of what has been officially described as 'shocking' White House support for [[Church of Scientology|Scientologists]] and [[Unification Church|Moonies]]". The French government also described the  [[United States Congress]]'s introduction of laws protecting religious freedom internationally as "an unacceptable intrusion into internal affairs". [[Alain Vivien]], former chairman of the French ministerial mission to combat the influence of cults (MILS), and the president of the ''Centre Contre les Manipulations Mentales'' (Centre Against Mental Manipulation), said many observers believed that Clinton was making his peace with big religious movements, "because they offer an indispensable source of [[campaign finance|political financing]]", and that with the help of Scientologists, cults were infiltrating UN and European human rights associations and collaborating on virulent reports against France's policies.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,331743,00.html "France to crack down on sects"], by Paul Webster; Wednesday June 14, 2000. Retrieved 2007-01-01.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The French did not alter their law following these requests; and the claims and actions of the US government regarding the religious situation in France largely ceased with the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration.

Some critics of French legislation have voiced concerns that countries which do not have the same legal safeguards and constitutional rights as France may emulate this legislation. In the words of a US official:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/rm/14258.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116064332/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/rm/14258.htm |archive-date=2009-01-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yet the law itself remains problematic not only because of the threat the language carries in France, but because it is even now being considered for emulation by countries that lack France’s commitment to [[rule of law]] and human rights. Such a model serves only too well as cover for those nations who persecute under the guise of law enforcement.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 15 September 2006 the United States [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] released a report on religious freedom in France.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71380.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This report noted that "The constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice." It reported mostly anonymous concerns over repression of religious freedom in France, notably in regards to what the report referred to in one case as "cult groups", as well as the law banning religious symbols in schools, and rising anti-semitism in France.

An '''academy''' ([[Attic Greek]]: Ἀκαδήμεια; [[Koine Greek]] Ἀκαδημία) is an institution of [[secondary education]], [[higher education|higher learning]], research, or honorary membership.
The term '''academia''' refers to the worldwide human group composed of professors and researchers at institutes of higher learning.

The name traces back to [[Plato]]'s school of [[philosophy]], founded approximately 385 BC at [[Akademia]], a [[sanctuary]] of [[Athena]], the goddess of [[wisdom]] and [[Skills|skill]], north of [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], [[Greece]].

== Etymology ==
The word comes from the ''Academy'' in [[ancient Greece]], which derives from the [[Athenian]] [[hero]], ''[[Akademos]]''. Outside the city walls of [[Athens]], the [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] was made famous by [[Plato]] as a center of learning. The sacred space, dedicated to the goddess of wisdom, [[Athena]], had formerly been an [[olive]] [[Grove (nature)|grove]], hence the expression "the groves of Academe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|academe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In these gardens, the philosopher [[Plato]] conversed with followers. Plato developed his sessions into a method of teaching philosophy and in 387 BC, established what is known today as the [[Old Academy]].

By extension ''academia'' has come to mean the cultural accumulation of [[knowledge]], its development and transmission across generations and its practitioners and transmitters. In the 17th century, [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[France|French]] scholars used the term to describe types of institutions of higher learning.

==Origins==
===The original Academy===
[[File:Raffael 058.jpg|thumb|''[[The School of Athens]]'', fresco by [[Raphael]] (1509–1510), of an idealized academy]]
{{main article|Platonic Academy}}
Before ''Akademia'' was a school, and even before [[Cimon]] enclosed its precincts with a wall,&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]] ''Life of Cimon'' 13.8&lt;/ref&gt; it contained a sacred grove of olive trees dedicated to [[Athena]], the goddess of [[wisdom]], outside the city walls of ancient [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]] ii:34&lt;/ref&gt; The archaic name for the site was ''Hekademia'', which by classical times evolved into ''Akademia'' and was explained, at least as early as the beginning of the 6th century BC, by linking it to an Athenian [[Greek hero cult|hero]], a legendary "[[Akademos]]". The site of ''Akademia'' was sacred to [[Athena]] and other immortals.

Plato's immediate successors as "scholarch" of ''Akademia'' were [[Speusippus]] (347–339 BC), [[Xenocrates]] (339–314 BC), [[Polemon (scholarch)|Polemon]] (314–269 BC), [[Crates of Athens|Crates]] (ca. 269–266 BC), and [[Arcesilaus]] (ca. 266–240 BC). Later scholarchs include [[Lacydes of Cyrene]], [[Carneades]], [[Clitomachus (philosopher)|Clitomachus]], and [[Philo of Larissa]] ("the last undisputed head of the Academy").&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', 3rd ed. (1996), s.v. "Philon of Larissa."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See the table in [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521250285 The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy] (Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other notable members of ''Akademia'' include [[Aristotle]], [[Heraclides Ponticus]], [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], [[Philip of Opus]], [[Crantor]], and [[Antiochus of Ascalon]].

===The Neoplatonic Academy of Late Antiquity===
{{further|End of Hellenic Religion}}

After a lapse during the early Roman occupation, ''Akademia'' was refounded&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cameron, "The last days of the Academy at Athens," in ''Proceedings of the Cambridge Philological Society'' vol 195 (n.s. 15), 1969, pp 7–29.&lt;/ref&gt; as a new institution of some outstanding Platonists of late antiquity who called themselves "successors" (''[[diadochus (disambiguation)|diadochoi]]'', but of Plato) and presented themselves as an  uninterrupted tradition reaching back to Plato.  However, there cannot have actually been any geographical, institutional, economic or [[personal continuity]] with the original Academy in the new organizational entity.&lt;ref name="bechtle"&gt;[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2000/2000-04-19.html Gerald Bechtle, Bryn Mawr Classical Review of Rainer Thiel, ''Simplikios und das Ende der neuplatonischen Schule in Athen''. Stuttgart, 1999] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20050313013529/http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2000/2000-04-19.html |date=2005-03-13 }} (in English).&lt;/ref&gt;

The last "Greek" philosophers of the revived ''Akademia'' in the 6th century were drawn from various parts of the [[Hellenistic]] cultural world and suggest the broad [[syncretism]] of the common culture (see ''[[koine]]''): Five of the seven ''Akademia'' philosophers mentioned by Agathias were [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]] in their cultural origin: Hermias and Diogenes (both from Phoenicia), Isidorus of Gaza, [[Damascius]] of Syria, [[Iamblichus]] of Coele-Syria and perhaps even [[Simplicius of Cilicia]].&lt;ref name="bechtle"/&gt;

The [[Byzantine Empire|emperor]] [[Justinian I|Justinian]] closed the school in AD 529, a date that is often cited as the end of [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]]. According to the sole witness, the historian [[Agathias]], its remaining members looked for protection under the rule of [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] king [[Khosrau I of Persia|Khosrau I]] in his capital at [[Ctesiphon]], carrying with them precious scrolls of literature and philosophy, and to a lesser degree of science. After a peace treaty between the Persian and the Byzantine empire in 532 guaranteed their personal security (an early document in the history of [[freedom of religion]]), some members found sanctuary in the [[paganism|pagan]] stronghold of [[Harran]], near [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]. One of the last leading figures of this group was Simplicius, a pupil of Damascius, the last head of the Athenian school.

It has been speculated that ''Akademia'' did not altogether disappear.&lt;ref name="bechtle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sorabji11"&gt;Richard Sorabji, (2005), ''The Philosophy of the Commentators, 200–600 AD: Psychology (with Ethics and Religion)'', page 11. Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt; After his exile, Simplicius (and perhaps some others), may have travelled to [[Harran]], near [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]. From there, the students of an Academy-in-exile could have survived into the 9th century, long enough to facilitate the Arabic revival of the Neoplatonist commentary tradition in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="sorabji11"/&gt;

==Ancient and medieval institutions==

===Ancient world===
{{main|Ancient higher-learning institutions}}

====Greece and early Europe====
{{Main|Academy}}
In ancient Greece, after the establishment of the original Academy, [[Plato]]'s colleagues and pupils developed spin-offs of his method. [[Arcesilaus]], a Greek student of Plato established the [[Middle Academy]]. [[Carneades]], another student, established the [[New Academy]]. In 335 BC, [[Aristotle]] refined the method with his own theories and established the [[Lyceum]] in another gymnasium.

====Africa====
The [[library of Alexandria]] in [[Egypt]] was frequented by [[intellectual]]s from Africa, Europe and Asia studying various aspects of philosophy, language and mathematics.

The [[University of Timbuktu]] was a medieval university in [[Timbuktu]], present-day [[Mali]], which comprised three schools: the Mosque of Djinguereber, the Mosque of Sidi Yahya, and the Mosque of Sankore. During its zenith, the university had an average attendance of around 25,000 students within a city of around 100,000 people.

====China====
In China a higher education institution [[Shang Xiang]] was founded by [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]] in the [[Youyu]] era before the 21st century BC. The Imperial Central Academy at [[Nanjing]], founded in 258, was a result of the evolution of Shang Xiang and it became the first comprehensive institution combining education and research and was divided into five faculties in 470, which later became [[Nanjing University]].

In the 8th century another kind of institution of learning emerged, named [[Shuyuan]], which were generally privately owned. There were thousands of Shuyuan recorded in ancient times. The degrees from them varied from one to another and those advanced Shuyuan such as [[Bailudong Shuyuan]] and [[Yuelu Shuyuan]] can be classified as higher institutions of learning.

====India====
[[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]] or [[Taxila (ancient)|Takshashila]], in ancient [[Hindustan|India]], modern-day [[Pakistan]], was an early centre of learning, near present-day [[Islamabad]] in the city of [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]]. It is considered as one of the ancient universities of the world. According to scattered references which were only fixed a millennium later it may have dated back to at least the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Scharfe (2002): ''Education in Ancient India'', Brill Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|90-04-12556-6}}, p. 141: {{quote|We have to be extremely cautious in dealing with the literary evidence, because much of the information offered in the secondary literature on Taxila is derived from the Jataka prose that was only fixed in Ceylon several hundred years after the events that it purports to describe, probably some time after Buddhaghosa, i.e. around A.D. 500.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars date Takshashila's existence back to the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name="Britannica Education"&gt;"History of Education", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The school consisted of several monasteries without large dormitories or lecture halls where the religious instruction was most likely still provided on an individualistic basis.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Scharfe (2002): ''Education in Ancient India'', Brill Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|90-04-12556-6}}, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Takshashila is described in some detail in later [[Jataka tales|Jātaka]] tales, written in [[Sri Lanka]] around the 5th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall 1975:81&lt;/ref&gt;

It became a noted centre of learning at least several centuries BC, and continued to attract students until the destruction of the city in the 5th century AD. Takshashila is perhaps best known because of its association with Chanakya. The famous [[treatise]] [[Arthashastra]] ([[Sanskrit]] for The knowledge of [[Economics]]) by Chanakya, is said to have been composed in Takshashila itself. Chanakya (or Kautilya),&lt;ref&gt;[http://britannica.com/eb/article-9044882 Kautilya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110120535/http://britannica.com/eb/article-9044882 |date=2008-01-10 }}  Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] Emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]]&lt;ref&gt;Radhakumud Mookerji (1941; 1960; reprint 1989).

''Ancient Indian Education: Brahmanical and Buddhist'' (p. 478-489). Motilal Banarsidass Publ. {{ISBN|81-208-0423-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, a student entered Takshashila at the age of sixteen. The [[Vedas]] and the [[Eighteen Arts]], which included skills such as [[archery]], [[hunting]], and [[elephant]] lore, were taught, in addition to its [[law school]], [[medical school]], and school of [[military science]].&lt;ref name=Mookerji/&gt;

It survived until 1197 when it was set upon, destroyed and burnt by the marauding forces of [[Ikhtiyar Uddin Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji]]. It was devoted to Buddhist studies, but it also trained students in fine arts, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, politics and the art of war.&lt;ref name="Nalanda University, as described by the dean of Yale school of management"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/09/opinion/09garten.htm OpEd in New York Times: Nalanda University]&lt;/ref&gt;

It had a nine-story library where monks meticulously copied books and documents so that individual scholars could have their own collections.

====Islamic world====
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
{{Main|Islamic Golden Age#Education}}
Founded in [[Fes]], [[University of Al-Karaouine]] in the 9th century and in [[Cairo]], [[Al-Azhar University]] in the 10th century, and in [[Mali]], the [[University of Timbuktu]] in about 1100. [[Mustansiriya Madrasah]] in [[Baghdad]], Iraq was established in 1227 as a [[madrasah]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Caliph]] [[Al-Mustansir (Baghdad)|al-Mustansir]]. Its library had an initial collection of 80,000 volumes, given by the Caliph. The collection was said to have grown to 400,000 volumes.

===Medieval Europe===
{{Main|Medieval university}}
In [[Europe]], the academy dates to the ancient Greeks and Romans in the pre-Christian era. Newer universities were founded in the 12th and 13th centuries, and the European institution of academia took shape. Monks and priests moved out of monasteries to [[cathedral|cathedral cities]] and other towns where they opened the first schools dedicated to advanced study.

The most notable of these new schools were in [[Bologna]], [[Salamanca]], [[Paris]], [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]], while others were opened throughout Europe.

The seven [[liberal arts]] — the [[trivium (education)|Trivium]] ([[Grammar]], [[Rhetoric]], and [[Logic]]), and the [[Quadrivium]] ([[Arithmetic]], [[Geometry]], [[Music]], and [[Astronomy]]) — had been codified in [[late antiquity]]. This was the basis of the curriculum in Europe until newly available Arabic texts and the works of Aristotle became more available in Europe in the 12th century.

It remained in place even after the new scholasticism of the [[School of Chartres]] and the encyclopedic work of [[Thomas Aquinas]], until the humanism of the 15th and 16th centuries opened new studies of arts and sciences.

==Renaissance academies in Italy==
With the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist revival]] that accompanied the revival of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist studies]], ''accademia'' took on newly vivid connotations.

===15th-century ''accademie''===
During the [[Florentine Renaissance]], [[Cosimo de' Medici]] took a personal interest in the new [[Platonic Academy (Florence)|Platonic Academy]] that he determined to re-establish in 1439, centered on the marvellous promise shown by the young [[Marsilio Ficino]]. Cosimo had been inspired by the arrival at the otherwise ineffective [[Council of Florence]] of [[Gemistos Plethon]], who seemed a dazzling figure to the Florentine intellectuals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} In 1462 Cosimo gave Ficino a villa at [[Careggi]] for the Academy's use, situated where Cosimo could see it from his own villa, and drop by for visits.  The academy remained a wholly informal group, but one which had a great influence on [[Platonism in the Renaissance|Renaissance Neo-Platonism]].

{{main article|Roman academies}}
In Rome, after unity was restored following the [[Western Schism]], humanist circles, cultivating philosophy and searching out and sharing ancient texts tended to gather where there was access to a library. The [[Vatican Library]] was not coordinated until 1475 and was never catalogued or widely accessible: not all popes looked with satisfaction at gatherings of unsupervised intellectuals. At the head of this movement for renewal in Rome was [[Cardinal Bessarion]], whose house from the mid-century was the centre of a flourishing academy of Neoplatonic philosophy and a varied intellectual culture. His valuable Greek as well as Latin library (eventually bequeathed to the city of [[Venice]] after he withdrew from Rome) was at the disposal of the academicians. Bessarion, in the latter years of his life, retired from Rome to [[Ravenna]], but he left behind him ardent adherents of the classic philosophy.

The next generation of humanists were bolder admirers of pagan culture, especially in the highly personal academy of [[Julius Pomponius Laetus|Pomponius Leto]], the natural son of a nobleman of the [[Sanseverino]] family, born in [[Calabria]] but known by his academic name, who devoted his energies to the enthusiastic study of classical antiquity, and attracted a great number of disciples and admirers. He was a worshipper not merely of the literary and artistic form, but also of the ideas and spirit of classic paganism, which made him appear a condemner of [[Christianity]] and an enemy of the Church. In his academy every member assumed a classical name. Its principal members were humanists, like Bessarion's protégé [[Giovanni Antonio Campani]] (Campanus), [[Bartolomeo Platina]], the papal librarian, and [[Filippo Buonaccorsi]], and young visitors who received polish in the academic circle, like [[Publio Fausto Andrelini]] of Bologna who took the [[New Learning]] to the [[University of Paris]], to the discomfiture of his friend [[Erasmus]]. In their self-confidence, these first intellectual [[Neopaganism|neopagans]] compromised themselves politically, at a time when Rome was full of conspiracies fomented by the Roman barons and the neighbouring princes: [[Pope Paul II|Paul II]] (1464–71) caused [[Julius Pomponius Laetus|Pomponio]] and the leaders of the academy to be arrested on charges of irreligion, immorality, and conspiracy against the [[Pope]]. The prisoners begged so earnestly for mercy, and with such protestations of repentance, that they were pardoned. The Letonian academy, however, collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Pastor]], ''History of the Popes, ii, 2, gives an unsympathetic account.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Naples, the ''[[Quattrocento]]'' academy founded by [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso of Aragon]] and guided by [[Antonio Beccadelli (poet)|Antonio Beccadelli]] was the ''Porticus Antoniana'', later known as the ''[[Accademia Pontaniana]]'', after [[Giovanni Pontano]].

===16th-century literary-aesthetic academies===
The 16th century saw at Rome a great increase of literary and aesthetic academies, more or less inspired by the Renaissance, all of which assumed, as was the fashion, odd and fantastic names. We learn from various sources the names of many such institutes; as a rule, they soon perished and left no trace. In the 1520s came the ''[[Accademia degli Intronati]]'', for the encouragement of theatrical representations. There were also the Academy of the "[[Vignaiuoli]]", or "[[Vinegrowers]]" (1530), and the ''{{illm|Accademia della Virtù|it}}'' (1542), founded by [[Claudio Tolomei]] under the patronage of Cardinal [[Ippolito de' Medici]]. These were followed by a new academy in the "[[Orti]]" or [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] gardens. There were also the academies of the "[[Intrepidi]]" (1560), the "[[Animosi]]" (1576), and the "[[Illuminati (Roman)|Illuminati]]" (1598); this last, founded by the [[Marchesa Isabella Aldobrandini Pallavicino]]. Towards the middle of the 16th century there were also the Academy of the "[[Notti Vaticane]]", or "[[Vatican Nights]]", founded by [[Saint|St]]. [[Charles Borromeo]]; an "Accademia di [[Diritto]] civile e canonico", and another of the university scholars and students of philosophy ([[Accademia Eustachiana]]). As a rule these academies, all very much alike, were merely circles of friends or clients gathered around a learned man or wealthy patron, and were dedicated to literary pastimes rather than methodical study. They fitted in, nevertheless, with the general situation and were in their own way one element of the historical development. Despite their empirical and fugitive character, they helped to keep up the general esteem for literary and other studies. Cardinals, prelates, and the clergy in general were most favourable to this movement, and assisted it by patronage and collaboration.

In Florence, the Medici again took the lead in establishing the [[Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze|Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno]] in 1563, the first of the more formally organised art academies that gradually displaced the medieval artists' [[guild]]s, usually known as the [[Guild of Saint Luke]], as the bodies responsible for training and often regulating artists, a change with great implications for the development of art, leading to the styles known as [[Academic art]].  The private [[Accademia degli Incamminati]] set up later in the century in [[Bologna]] by the [[The Carracci|Carracci]] brothers was also extremely influential, and with the [[Accademia di San Luca]] of Rome (founded 1593) helped to confirm the use of the term for these institutions.

==17th- and 18th-century academies in Europe==
Gradually academies began to specialize on particular topics (arts, language, sciences) and began to be founded and funded by the kings and other sovereigns (few republics had an academy). And, mainly, since 17th century academies spread throughout Europe.

===Literary-philosophical academies=== &lt;!-- courtesy note: [Draft:]Lumières links here --&gt;
In the 17th century the tradition of literary-philosophical academies, as circles of friends gathering around learned patrons, was continued in Italy; the "[[Umoristi]]" (1611), the "[[Fantastici]] (1625), and the "[[Ordinati]]", founded by [[Cardinal Dati]] and [[Giulio Strozzi]]. About 1700 were founded the academies of the "[[Infecondi]]", the "[[Occulti]]", the "[[Deboli]]", the "[[Aborigini]]", the "[[Immobili]]", the "[[Accademia Esquilina]]", and others. During the 18th century many Italian cities established similar philosophical and scientific academies. In the first half of the 19th century some of these became the [[National Academy|national academies]] of pre-unitarian states: the Academy of [[Accesi]] became the [[Panomitan Academy of Buon Gusto]] ([[Trento]]); the Academy of [[Timidi]] became the Royal Academy of [[Mantua]]; the [[Accademia dei Ricovrati]] became the [[Galileiana Academy of Arts and Science]] ([[Padova]]); the Academy of [[Dissonanti]] became the Royal Academy of [[Modena]] and the Academy of [[Oscuri]] became the Royal Academy of [[Lucca]].

===Academies of the arts===
The [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]] in Paris, established by the monarchy in 1648 (later renamed) was the most significant of the artistic academies, running the famous [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] exhibitions from 1725.  Artistic academies were established all over Europe by the end of the 18th century, and many, like the [[Akademie der Künste]] in Berlin (founded 1696), the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]]  in Madrid (founded 1744), the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]]  in Saint Petersburg (1757), the [[Royal Academy]] in London (1768) and the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera]] in Milan (1776) still run art schools and hold large exhibitions, although their influence on taste greatly declined from the late 19th century.

A fundamental feature of academic discipline in the artistic academies was regular practice in making accurate drawings from antiquities, or from casts of antiquities, on the one hand, and on the other, in deriving inspiration from the other fount, the human form. Students assembled in sessions [[Figure drawing|drawing the draped and undraped human form]], and such drawings, which survive in the tens of thousands from the 17th through the 19th century, are termed '''''académies''''' in French.

Similar institutions were often established for other arts: Rome had the [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia|Accademia di Santa Cecilia]] for music from 1585; Paris had the [[Académie Royale de Musique]] from 1669 and the [[Académie Royale d'Architecture]] from 1671.

===Linguistic academies===
{{main article|List of language regulators}}
The [[Accademia degli Infiammati]] of [[Padova]] and the Accademia degli Umidi, soon renamed the [[Accademia Fiorentina]], of [[Florence]] were both founded in 1540, and were both initially concerned with the proper basis for literary use of the ''volgare'', or [[vernacular language]] of Italy, which would later become the [[Italian language]]. In 1582 five Florentine literati gathered and founded the [[Accademia della Crusca]] to demonstrate and conserve the beauty of the Florentine vernacular tongue, modelled upon the authors of the Trecento. The main instrument to do so was the ''[[Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca]]''. The Crusca long remained a private institution, criticizing and opposing the official Accademia Fiorentina.

The first institution inspired by the Crusca was the [[Fruitbearing Society]] for German language, which existed from 1617 to 1680.

The Crusca inspired [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]] to found in 1634 the analogous [[Académie française]] with the task of acting as an official authority on the [[French language]], charged with publishing the official dictionary of that language. The following year the Académie received letters patent from the king Louis XIII as the only recognized academy for French language.

In its turn the state established Académie was the model for the [[Real Academia Española]] (founded in 1713) and the [[Swedish Academy]] (1786), which are the ruling bodies of their respective languages and editors of major dictionaries. It also was the model for the [[Russian Academy]], founded in 1783, which afterwards merged into the Russian Academy of Sciences.

===Academies of sciences===
{{main article|Academy of Sciences}}

After the short-lived [[Academia Secretorum Naturae]] of Naples, the first academy exclusively devoted to sciences was the [[Accademia dei Lincei]] founded in 1603 in Rome, particularly focused on natural sciences.
In 1657 some students of [[Galileo]] founded the [[Accademia del Cimento]] (Academy of Experiment) in [[Florence]], focused on physics and astronomy. The foundation of Academy was funded by [[Leopoldo de' Medici|Prince Leopoldo]] and [[Rulers of Tuscany|Grand Duke]] [[Ferdinando II de' Medici]]. This academy lasted after few decades.

In 1652 was founded the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina|Academia Naturae Curiosorum]] by four physicians.&lt;ref&gt;As for instance in the monumental ''A History of Magic and Experimental Science'' by [[Lynn Thorndike]] (see [https://books.google.com/books?id=M8zF_ESLDd0C&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=%22Academy+of+the+Curious+as+to+Nature%22+inauthor:Thorndike&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Academy%20of%20the%20Curious%20as%20to%20Nature%22%20inauthor%3AThorndike&amp;f=false online]).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1677, [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], recognised the society and in 1687 he gave it the epithet ''Leopoldina'', with which is internationally famous.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[http://www.leopoldina-halle.de/broscheng.pdf Self-produced overview of the Leopoldina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928014914/http://www.leopoldina-halle.de/broscheng.pdf |date=2007-09-28 }} (accessed May 27, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, p.&amp;nbsp;7–8; &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="b"&gt;[http://www.groschenheft.de/aus_leopoldina.htm Groschenheft magazine on the Leopoldina's anniversary (German)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311200937/http://www.groschenheft.de/aus_leopoldina.htm |date=March 11, 2007 }} (accessed May 27, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;
So, it became the academy of sciences for the whole [[Holy Roman Empire]].

On 28 November 1660, a group of scientists from and influenced by the Invisible College (gathering approximately since 1645) met at Gresham College and announced the formation of a "College for the Promoting of Physico-Mathematical Experimental Learning", which would meet weekly to discuss science and run experiments. In 1662 [[Charles II of England]]  signed a  [[Royal Charter]] which created the "Royal Society of London", then "Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge".

In 1666 [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] gathered a small group of scholars to found a scientific society in Paris. The first 30 years of the Academy's existence were relatively informal, since no statutes had as yet been laid down for the institution.  In contrast to [[Royal Society]], the Academy was founded as an organ of government. In 1699, [[Louis XIV]] gave the Academy its first rules and named it [[Académie des sciences|Académie royale des sciences]].

Although Prussia was a member of Holy Roman Empire, in 1700 [[Prince-elector]] [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III]] of [[Brandenburg]] founded its own [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] upon the advice of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who was appointed president.

During the 18th century many European kings followed and founded their own academy of sciences: in 1714 the [[Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna]], in 1724 the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], in 1731 the [[Royal Dublin Society]], in 1735 in [[Grand duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], in 1739 the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], in 1742 the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]], in 1751 the [[Göttingen Academy of Sciences]], in 1754 in [[Erfurt]], in 1759 the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]], in 1763  the [[Academia Theodoro-Palatina]] in [[Heidelberg]], in 1779 the [[Sciences Academy of Lisbon]], in 1783 the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], in 1782 the [[Accademia dei Quaranta]] in Rome, in 1784 in [[Turin]].

This kind of academy lost importance after the university reform begun with the foundation of the [[University of Berlin]], when universities were provided with laboratories and clinics, and were charged with doing experimental research.

===Academic societies===
{{Main|Learned society}}

Academic societies or [[learned society|learned societies]] began as groups of academics who worked together or presented their work to each other. These informal groups later became organized and in many cases state-approved. Membership was restricted, usually requiring approval of the current members and often total membership was limited to a specific number. The [[Royal Society]] founded in 1660 was the first such academy. The [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] was begun in 1780 by many of the same people prominent in the [[American Revolution]]. Academic societies served both as a forum to present and publish academic work, the role now served by academic publishing, and as a means to sponsor research and support academics, a role they still serve. Membership in academic societies is still a matter of prestige in modern academia.

===Military academies===
At first such institutions only trained the [[Artillery]] and [[Military Engineering]] officers, like the ''Aula da Artilharia'' (founded in 1641) and the ''Aula de Fortificação'' (1647) in Lisbon, the [[Military Academy of Modena|Real Accademia di Savoia]] in Turin (opened in 1678), the [[Soviet military academies|Imperial Artillery Military Academy]] of Saint Petersburg (1698), the  [[Royal Military Academy Woolwich]] (1741), the ''Real Colegio de Artilleria'' in Segovia (1764).

Starting at the end of the 16th century in the Holy Roman Empire, France, Poland and Denmark, many [[Knight academy|Knight academies]] were established to prepare the aristocratic youth for state and military service. Many of them lately turned into [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], but some of them were transformed into true military academies.

The [[Royal Danish Military Academy]] began to educate all [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] for the [[Royal Danish Army]] by request of [[Frederick IV of Denmark|King Frederick IV]] in 1713.

The [[École Militaire]] was founded by [[Louis XV of France]] in 1750 with the  aim of creating an academic college for cadet officers from poor families. The construction began in 1752, but the school did not open until 1760.

The [[Theresian Military Academy]] was founded on 14 December 1751 by [[Maria Theresa of Austria]]. Per year the Academy accepted 100 noblemen and 100 commoners to start their education there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmlv.gv.at/karriere/offizier/geschichte.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806051814/http://www.bmlv.gv.at/karriere/offizier/geschichte.shtml |archivedate=2014-08-06 |df= }}, Feb. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These were the model for the subsequent military academies throughout Europe, like the ''Reale Accademia Militare'' of Naples in 1787 and the [[Military Academy Karlberg]] in 1792.

==Modern use of the term ''academy''==
[[File:Athens academy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The modern [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]], next to the [[University of Athens]] and the National Library forming 'the Trilogy', designed by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel|Schinkel's]] Danish pupil [[Theophil Freiherr von Hansen|Theofil Hansen]], 1885, in [[Ionic order|Greek Ionic]], academically correct even to the polychrome sculpture.]]

The term is used widely today to refer to anything from schools to [[Learned society|learned societies]] to [[Funding agency|funding agencies]] to private industry associations.

[[National academies]] are bodies for scientists, artists or writers that are usually state-funded and often are given the role of controlling much of the state funding for research into their areas, or other forms of funding.  Some use different terms in their name – the British [[Royal Society]] for example.  The membership typically comprises distinguished individuals in the relevant field, who may be elected by the other members, or appointed by the government.  They are essentially not schools or colleges, though some may operate teaching arms.  The [[Académie Française]] was the most influential pattern for these. Finland even has two separate "academies": [[Academy of Finland]] is a government-run funding agency, Suomalainen tiedeakatemia is a learned society.

The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], which presents the annual [[Academy Awards]], is an example of a purely industry body using the name.  College-type specialized academies include the [[Royal Academy of Music]] of the [[United Kingdom]]; the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]], [[New York (state)|New York]]; the [[United States Naval Academy]]; [[United States Air Force Academy]]; and the [[Australian Defence Force Academy]]. In emulation of the military academies, police in the United States are trained in [[Police academy|police academies]].

Because of the tradition of intellectual brilliance associated with this institution, many groups have chosen to use the word "academy" in their name, especially specialized tertiary educational institutions.  In the early 19th century "academy" took the connotations that "[[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]" was acquiring in German-speaking lands, of school that was less advanced than a college (for which it might prepare students) but considerably more than elementary. Early American examples are the prestigious preparatory schools of [[Phillips Andover Academy]], [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and [[Deerfield Academy]].  In England, "academy" had a specialized meaning for schools, but the [[Edinburgh Academy]] was more like the American examples.  Academy was also used very loosely for various commercial training schools for dancing and the like.

[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] organized public subscription performances of his music in Vienna in the 1780s and 1790s, he called the [[concert]]s "academies". This usage in musical terms survives in the concert orchestra [[Academy of St Martin in the Fields]] and in the [[Brixton Academy]], a concert hall in Brixton, South London.

Academies proliferated in the 20th century until even a three-week series of lectures and discussions would be termed an "academy". In addition, the generic term "the academy" is sometimes used to refer to all of academia, which is sometimes considered a global successor to the Academy of [[Athens]].

===French regional academies overseeing education===
[[File:French academies map.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|A map outlining the academies overseeing education in France.]]

In France, regional academic councils called academies are responsible for supervising all aspects of education in their region. The academy regions are similar to, but not identical to, the standard French administrative regions. the rector of each academy is a revocable nominee of the Ministry of Education. These academies' main responsibility is overseeing primary and secondary education, but public universities are  in some respects also answerable to the academy for their region. However, French private universities are independent of the state and therefore independent of the regional academies.

===Russian research academies===
In [[Imperial Russia]] and [[Soviet Union]] the term "academy", or [[Academy of Sciences]] was reserved to denote a state research establishment, see [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. The latter one still exists in [[Russia]], although other types of academies (study and honorary) appeared as well.

===English school types===

====[[Tertiary education]]====
{{main article|Dissenting academies}}
From the mid-seventeenth to the 19th centuries, educational institutions in [[England]] run by [[nonconformist]] groups that did not agree with the [[Church of England]] teachings were collectively known as "[[dissenting academies|the dissenting academies]]". As a place at an English public school or university generally required conformity to the Church of England, these institutions provided an alternative for those with different religious views and formed a significant part of [[education in England|England’s educational system]].

[[University College London]] (UCL) was founded in 1826 as the first publicly funded English university to admit anyone regardless of religious adherence; and the [[Test and Corporation Acts]], which had imposed a wide range of restrictions on citizens who were not in conformity to the Church of England, were abolished shortly afterwards, by the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Act]] of 1829.

====[[Primary education|Primary]] and [[secondary education]]====
{{main article|Academy (English school)}}
In 2000, a form of "independent state schools", called "[[Academy (English school)|academies]]", were introduced in [[England]]. They have been compared to US [[charter school]]s.&lt;ref name="smithers"&gt;Rebecca Smithers, ''[[The Guardian]]'', July 6, 2005, [http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,5500,1522109,00.html "Hedge fund charity plans city academies"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060202165655/http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0%2C5500%2C1522109%2C00.html |date=2006-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are directly funded from central government rather than through local councils, and are partly privately sponsored. Often the sponsors are from business, but some are sponsored by universities and charities. These schools have greater autonomy than schools run by the local councils. They are usually a type of secondary school, but some are "all through" schools with an integral primary school.  Some of the early ones were briefly known as "city academies"—the first such school opening on 10 September 2002 at the [[Business Academy Bexley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2249188.stm|title=BBC NEWS – UK – Education – Academy opens doors to the future|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040628210928/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2249188.stm|archivedate=28 June 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Queen's Speech, which followed the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], included proposals for a bill to allow the Secretary of State for Education to approve schools, both Primary and Secondary, that have been graded "outstanding" by [[Ofsted]], to become academies. This will be through a simplified streamlined process which will not require the sponsors to provide capital funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/academieshl.html|title=Page not found|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217031235/http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/academieshl.html|archivedate=17 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the UK government began forcing some schools which had been graded satisfactory or lower into becoming academies, unilaterally removing existing governing bodies and head teachers in some cases. An example was Downhills Primary School in Haringey, where the head teacher refused to turn the school into an academy. OFSTED were called in to assess the school, failed it, and both the head and the governing body were removed and replaced with a Government-appointed board despite opposition from the school and parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-17385311|title=BBC News – Academy row school governors sacked by Michael Gove|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813033727/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-17385311|archivedate=13 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haringeyindependent.co.uk/news/9592486.Protesting_parents__disgusted__with_Downhills_governors__removal/|title=Protesting parents 'disgusted' with Downhills governors' removal|author=David Hardiman|work=Haringey Independent|accessdate=17 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723074454/http://www.haringeyindependent.co.uk/news/9592486.Protesting_parents__disgusted__with_Downhills_governors__removal/|archivedate=23 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{see also|History of higher education in the United States}}

Prior to the twentieth century, education was not as carefully structured in the United States as it is in the twenty-first. There was not a rigid division between high school and colleges. In many cases, educational records were not kept nor diplomas issued.

A reference to academia, in the United States, is to post-secondary education, especially the most elite or liberal arts part of it. However, an academy was what later became known as a high school. Some older high schools, such as [[Corning Free Academy]], retained the term in their names (Corning Free Academy, demoted to a [[middle school]], closed in 2014). However, the [[United States Military Academy]] is a college. A number of colleges began as (high school) academies.

Academia began to splinter from its [[Christianity|Christian]] roots in 18th-century colonial [[United States|America]]. In 1753, Benjamin Franklin established the Academy and Charitable School of the Province of Pennsylvania. In 1755, it was renamed the College and Academy and Charitable School of Philadelphia. Today, it is known as the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. For the first time, academia was established as a [[secular]] institution. For the most part, church-based dogmatic points of view were no longer thrust upon students in the examination of their subjects of study. Points of view became more varied as students were free to wander in thought without having to add religious dimensions to their conclusions.

In 1819, Thomas Jefferson founded the [[University of Virginia]] and developed the standards used today in organizing colleges and universities across the globe. The curriculum was taken from the traditional liberal arts, classical [[humanism]] and the values introduced with the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Jefferson offered his students something new: the freedom to chart their own courses of study rather than mandate a fixed curriculum for all students. Religious colleges and universities followed suit.

The Academy movement in the U.S. in the early 19th century arose from a public sense that education in the classic disciplines needed to be extended into the new territories and states that were being formed in the [[Old Northwest]], in western [[New York State]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]], [[Indiana]] and [[Illinois]]. Dozens of academies were founded in the area, supported by private donations.

===Germany===
During [[the Age of Enlightenment]] in 18th-century Europe, the academy started to change in Europe. In the beginning of the 19th century [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] not only published his philosophical paper ''On the Limits of State Action'', but also directed the educational system in [[Prussia]] for a short time. He introduced an academic system that was much more accessible to the lower classes. [[Humboldt's Ideal]] was an education based on individuality, creativity, wholeness, and versatility. Many continental European universities are still rooted in these ideas (or at least pay lip-service to them). They are, however, in contradiction to today's massive trend of specialization in academia.

==Academic personnel==
{{main|Faculty (academic staff)}}
{{main listing|Academic ranks}}
{{see also|Academic administration}}

An ''academic'' is a person who works as a teacher or researcher at a [[university]] or other higher education institution.
An academic usually holds an [[postgraduate education|advanced degree]].
The term ''scholar'' is sometimes used with equivalent meaning to that of ''academic'' and describes in general those who attain mastery in a research discipline. It has wider application, with it also being used to describe those whose occupation was researched prior to organized higher education.

Academic administrators such as [[Chancellor (education)#University president|university presidents]] are not typically included in this use of the term ''academic'', although many administrators hold advanced degrees and pursue scholarly research and writing while also tending to their administrative duties.

In the [[Academic ranks in the United States|United States]], the term academic is approximately synonymous with that of the job title [[professor]] although in recent decades a growing number of institutions include [[librarian]]s in the category of "academic staff."
In the [[Academic ranks in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], various titles of [[list of academic ranks|academic rank]] are used, typically [[research associate]], [[research fellow]] (also senior research fellow and principal research fellow), [[lecturer]] (also senior lecturer and principal lecturer), [[reader (academic rank)|reader]], and [[professor]]. The colloquial term [[University don|don]] is sometimes substituted for teaching staff at Oxford and Cambridge.{{or?|date=May 2018}}

==Structure==
Academia is usually conceived of as divided into ''[[academic discipline|disciplines]]'' or ''fields'' of study. These have their roots in the subjects of the medieval [[trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]], which provided the model for scholastic thought in the first [[Medieval university|universities in medieval Europe]].

The disciplines have been much revised, and many new disciplines have become more specialized, researching smaller and smaller areas. Because of this, ''[[Inter-disciplinary|interdisciplinary]]'' research is often prized in today's academy, though it can also be made difficult both by practical matters of administration and funding and by differing research methods of different disciplines. In fact, many new fields of study have initially been conceived as interdisciplinary, and later become specialized disciplines in their own right – a recent example is [[cognitive science]].

Most academic institutions reflect the divide of the disciplines in their [[academic administration|administrative]] structure, being divided internally into ''departments'' or ''programs'' in various fields of study. Each department is typically administered and funded separately by the academic institution, though there may be some overlap and [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] members, research and administrative staff may in some cases be shared among departments. In addition, academic institutions generally have an overall administrative structure (usually including a [[University president|president]] and several [[dean (education)|deans]]) which is controlled by no single department, discipline, or field of thought. Also, the [[tenure]] system, a major component of academic employment and research in the US, serves to ensure that academia is relatively protected from political and financial pressures on thought.

===Qualifications===
{{Main|Academic degree}}

The degree awarded for completed study is the primary academic qualification. Typically these are, in order of completion, [[associate's degree]], [[bachelor's degree]] (awarded for completion of [[undergraduate]] study), [[master's degree]], and [[doctorate]] (awarded after [[graduate school|graduate]] or [[postgraduate]] study). These are only currently being standardized in Europe as part of the [[Bologna process]], as many different degrees and standards of time to reach each are currently awarded in different countries in Europe. In most fields the majority of academic researchers and teachers have doctorates or other terminal degrees, though in some [[Professional studies|professional]] and creative fields it is common for scholars and teachers to have only master's degrees.

===Academic conferences===
{{Main|Academic conference}}
Closely related to academic publishing is the practice of bringing a number of intellectuals in a field to give talks on their research at an academic conference, often allowing for a wider audience to be exposed to their ideas.

===Conflicting goals===
Within academia, diverse constituent groups have diverse, and sometimes conflicting, goals. In the contemporary academy several of these conflicts are widely distributed and common. A salient example of conflict is that between the goal to improve teaching quality and the goal to reduce costs. The conflicting goals of professional education programs and general education advocates currently are playing out in the negotiation over accreditation standards.

====Practice and theory====
Putting theory into practice can result in a gap between what is learned in academic settings and how that learning is manifested in practical settings. This is addressed in a number of professional schools such as [[teacher education|education]] and [[social work]], which require students to participate in practica for credit. Students are taught to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Not everyone agrees on the value of theory as opposed to practice. Academics are sometimes criticized as lacking practical experience and thus too insulated from the 'real world.' Academic insularity is colloquially criticized as being "[[ivory tower]]"; when used pejoratively, this term is criticized as [[anti-intellectualism]].

To address this split, there is a growing body of [[practice research]], such as the [[practice-based research network]] (PBRN) within clinical [[medical research]]. [[Arts]] and [[humanities]] departments debate how to define this emerging research phenomenon. There are a variety of contested models of practice research (practice-as-research, practice-based and practice through research), for example, [[screen media practice research]].

====Town and gown====
{{Main|Town and gown}}
Universities are often culturally distinct from the towns or cities where they reside. In some cases this leads to discomfort or outright conflict between local residents and members of the university over political, economic, or other issues. Some localities in the Northeastern United States, for instance, have tried to block students from registering to vote as local residents—instead encouraging them to vote by absentee ballot at their primary residence—in order to retain control of local politics.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Other issues can include deep cultural and class divisions between local residents and university students. The film ''[[Breaking Away]]'' dramatizes such a conflict.

====Commerce and scholarship====
The goals of research for profit and for the sake of knowledge often conflict to some degree.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==Academic publishing==
{{Main|Academic publishing}}

===History of academic journals===
Among the earliest [[research journal]]s were the Proceedings of Meetings of the [[Royal Society]] in the 17th century. At that time, the act of publishing academic inquiry was controversial, and widely ridiculed. It was not at all unusual for a new discovery to be announced as an [[anagram]], reserving priority for the discoverer, but indecipherable for anyone not in on the secret: both [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] used this approach. However, this method did not work well. [[Robert K. Merton]], a sociologist, found that 92 percent of cases of simultaneous discovery in the 17th century ended in dispute. The number of disputes dropped to 72 percent in the 18th century, 59 percent by the latter half of the 19th century, and 33 percent by the first half of the 20th century. The decline in contested claims for priority in research discoveries can be credited to the increasing acceptance of the publication of papers in modern academic journals.

The Royal Society was steadfast in its unpopular belief that science could only move forward through a transparent and open exchange of ideas backed by experimental evidence. Many of the experiments were ones that we would not recognize as scientific today—nor were the questions they answered. For example, when the [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] was admitted as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] on June 5, 1661, he presented the Society with a vial of powdered "[[unicorn]] horn". It was a well-accepted 'fact' that a circle of unicorn's horn would act as an invisible cage for any [[spider]]. [[Robert Hooke]], the chief experimenter of the Royal Society, emptied the Duke's vial into a circle on a table and dropped a spider in the centre of the circle. The spider promptly walked out of the circle and off the table. In its day, this was cutting-edge research.

===Current status and development===
Research journals have been so successful that the number of journals and of papers has proliferated over the past few decades, and the credo of the modern academic has become "[[publish or perish]]". Except for generalist journals such as ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' or ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', the topics covered in any single journal have tended to be narrow, and readership and citation have declined. A variety of methods for reviewing submissions exist. The most common involves initial approval by the journal, [[peer review]] by two or three researchers working in similar or closely related subjects who recommend approval or rejection as well as request error correction, clarification or additions before publishing. Controversial topics may receive additional levels of review. Journals have developed a hierarchy, partly based on reputation but also on the strictness of the review policy. More prestigious journals are more likely to receive and publish more important work. Submitters try to submit their work to the most prestigious journal likely to publish it to bolster their reputation and [[curriculum vitae]].

[[Andrew Odlyzko]], an [[academician]] with a large number of published research papers, has argued that research journals will evolve into something akin to [[Internet]] forums over the coming decade, by extending the interactivity of current Internet [[preprint]]s. This change may open them up to a wider range of ideas, some more developed than others. Whether this will be a positive evolution remains to be seen. Some claim that forums, like markets, tend to thrive or fail based on their ability to attract talent. Some believe that highly restrictive and tightly monitored forums may be the least likely to thrive.

==Academic dress==
{{Main|Academic dress}}

Gowns have been associated with academia since the birth of the university in the 14th and 15th centuries, perhaps because most early scholars were [[priest]]s or church officials. Over time, the gowns worn by degree-holders have become standardized to some extent, although traditions in individual countries and even institutions have established a diverse range of gown styles, and some have ended the custom entirely, even for graduation ceremonies.

At some universities, such as the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], undergraduates may be required to wear gowns on formal occasions and on graduation. Undergraduate gowns are usually a shortened version of a bachelor's gown. At other universities, for example, outside the UK or U.S., the custom is entirely absent. Students at the University of Trinity College at the University of Toronto wear gowns to formal dinner, debates, to student government, and to many other places.

In general, in the U.S. and UK recipients of a bachelor's degree are entitled to wear a simple full-length robe without adornment and a [[mortarboard]] cap with a tassel. In addition, holders of a bachelor's degree may be entitled to wear a ceremonial hood at some schools. In the U.S., bachelor's hoods are rarely seen. Bachelor's hoods are generally smaller versions of those worn by recipients of master's and doctoral degrees.

Recipients of a master's degree in the U.S. or UK wear a similar cap and gown but closed sleeves with slits, and usually receive a ceremonial hood that hangs down the back of the gown. In the U.S. the hood is traditionally edged with a silk or velvet strip displaying the disciplinary color, and is lined with the university's colors.

According to The American Council on Education “six-year specialist degrees ([[Educational Specialist|Ed.S.]], etc.) and other degrees that are intermediate between the master's and the doctor's degree may have hoods specially designed (1) intermediate in length between the master's and doctor's hood, (2) with a four-inch velvet border (also intermediate between the widths of the borders of master's and doctor's hoods), and (3) with color distributed in the usual fashion and according to the usual rules. Cap tassels should be uniformly black.”&lt;ref name="ACE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acenet.edu/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=10625#6-year |title=Six-Year Specialist Degrees |accessdate=2006-12-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206113630/http://www.acenet.edu/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;template=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=10625 |archivedate=6 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recipients of a doctoral degree tend to have the most elaborate academic dress, and hence there is the greatest diversity at this level. In the U.S., doctoral gowns are similar to the gowns worn by master's graduates, with the addition of velvet stripes across the sleeves and running down the front of the gown which may be tinted with the disciplinary color for the degree received. Holders of a doctoral degree may be entitled or obliged to wear ''scarlet'' (a special gown in scarlet) on high days and special occasions. While some doctoral graduates wear the mortarboard cap traditional to the lower degree levels, most wear a cap or ''Tudor bonnet'' that resembles a [[tam o'shanter (hat)|tam o'shanter]], from which a colored tassel is suspended.

In modern times in the U.S. and UK, gowns are normally only worn at graduation ceremonies, although some colleges still demand the wearing of academic dress on formal occasions (official banquets and other similar affairs). In the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was more common to see the dress worn in the classroom, a practice which has now all but disappeared. Two notable exceptions are [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and a society at [[Sewanee, The University of the South|Sewanee]], where students are required to wear formal academic dress in the examination room.

The '''activation-synthesis hypothesis''', proposed by [[Harvard University]] [[psychiatrist]]s [[Allan Hobson|John Allan Hobson]] and [[Robert McCarley]], is a [[neurobiological]] theory of [[dream]]s first published in the [[American Journal of Psychiatry]] in December 1977. The differences in neuronal activity of the [[brainstem]] during waking and [[REM sleep]] were observed, and the hypothesis proposes that dreams result from [[brain]] activation during REM sleep.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn2716 |title=REM sleep and dreaming: Towards a theory of protoconsciousness |year=2010 |last1=Hobson |first1=J. Allan |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |pmid=19794431 |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=803–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the hypothesis has undergone an evolution as technology and experimental equipment has become more precise. Currently, a three-dimensional model called AIM Model, described below, is used to determine the different states of the brain over the course of the day and night. The AIM Model introduces a new hypothesis that [[primary consciousness]] is an important building block on which [[secondary consciousness]] is constructed.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt;

== Introduction ==

With the advancement of [[brain imaging]] technology, the sleep-waking cycle can be studied as never before. The brain can be objectively quantified and identified as being in either one of three states:  [[awake]], [[REM sleep]], and [[NREM sleep]] due to these advanced methods of measurement. It has been shown that global deactivation of the brain from waking state to NREM sleep occurs, and a subsequent reactivation during REM sleep, to a degree greater than during waking.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt;  [[Consciousness]] and its substates, [[primary consciousness]] and [[secondary consciousness]], play a part in identifying the state of the brain. Primary consciousness is the simple awareness of [[perception]] and [[emotion]]; that is, the awareness of the world via advanced visual and [[motor coordination]] information your brain receives.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; Secondary consciousness is an advanced state that includes both primary consciousness and abstract analysis, or thinking, and [[metacognitive]] components, or the awareness of being aware.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; Most animals show some stages of primary consciousness, but only humans have been experimentally shown to experience secondary consciousness. The cycle of waking-NREM-REM sleep is essential to mental health of mammals. It has been shown through experimentation that animals subjected to inability to enter REM sleep show an immediate attempt to quickly enter REM stages and long-term effects on motor coordination and habitual motor habits, eventually leading to the death of the animal. It has also been shown that [[homeothermic]] animals might require sleep to maintain body weight and temperature.

== Background ==

=== Waking ===

The waking consciousness is the awareness of the world, our bodies, and ourselves.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; This includes humans experiencing the awareness of being aware of ourselves, an intrinsic ability to humans.  It's the ability to look in a mirror and know that you are looking at yourself, and not just another human being. Being awake allows the distinction between tasks and default brain states, and also distinguishes between background and foreground processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1965.01720310073009 |title=Eye Movements During Fantasies: Imagining and Suppressing Fantasies |year=1965 |last1=Singer |first1=Jerome L. |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=12 |pages=71–6 |pmid=14221693 |last2=Antrobus |first2=JS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being awake allows the person to not only be aware of themselves and the world, but also to have conscious motor coordination and understand the difference between need and want that comes from secondary consciousness.

== Difference between sleep and dream{{anchor|Difference between Sleep and Dream}} ==

There is a difference between being just asleep and in a state of mind called dreaming. Sleeping can be described as the lack of conscious awareness of the outside world, meaning large portions of the brain that receive and interpret signals are deactivated during this time, while dreaming is a specific state of sleep in which enhanced brain activity has been shown to occur,&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; theorizing the primary consciousness could be active during dreaming. Indeed, during dreams we are consciously aware of our surroundings, and assuredly have a certain perception and emotion throughout the course of the dream, suggesting that at least part of the primary consciousness is activated during the dream.

== Dream ==

A dream has all features of primary consciousness but is produced in the brain without external stimulation. Unlike the waking state, the brain cannot recognize its own condition; that it is in the midst of the dream and is not the same as the real world.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; The brain has a single-minded state of primary consciousness during dreaming, which allows the brain to reach greater perception and awareness of a single scenario out of images and dreams.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; This is called the dream consciousness.

=== Four stages of sleep{{anchor|Four stages of Sleep}} ===

The four [[sleep]] stages have been identified as follows: sleep onset stage I, late-night stage II, and deep sleep stages III and IV. Deep sleep stages III and IV all occur during the first half of the night, while lighter stages I and II occur during the later half. During standard sleep laboratory measurements, the states of sleep and waking have [[behavioral]], polygraphic, and [[psychological]] manifestation within the [[pons|pontine]] brainstem. These states are regulated by a reciprocal relationship between two types of neuronal cells, aminergic inhibitory cells such as [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]] and [[cholinergic]] excitatory cells such as [[acetylcholine]]. Changes in the sleep stages occur when the activity curves of these neurons cross. REM sleep stage I is a state of sleep just above and most closely linked to sleep onset stage I.

==== NREM ====

NREM sleep can be described as the stages of sleep that show greatly decreased brain activity. There are four different stages of NREM sleep. The brain shows dulled or limited senses of perception, though the thought process has been shown to be logical and perseverative.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; Episodic movements of the body occur during these stages, though they are involuntary movements.

=== REM ===

REM sleep is an evolutionarily recent behavior of humans.&lt;ref name=Allison&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allison |first1=T. |last2=Van Twyer |first2=H. |year=1970 |title=The evolution of Sleep |journal=Natural History |volume=79 |pages=56–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; REM stands for rapid eye movement. It is the deepest sleep a mammal can go into.&lt;ref name=Allison /&gt; It is regulated by the pontine brainstem. Infants spend most of their time in REM sleep, and rather than enter stage 1 sleep they go directly to REM sleep. Most REM sleep occurs just above stage I of sleep, and experiences different mental abilities than during NREM sleep. The thought process is non-logical and often bizarre, sensation and perception is vivid but created internally by the brain, and the body's movements are inhibited.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; Most REM stages last 10–15 minutes, and the average human will go through 4–6 of these stages during sleep each night. Subsequent REM stages increase in duration, so the last REM stage before awakening is the longest and most vivid. During REM sleep the brain shows increased states of minimal inhibition, which degrades in our ability to recognize the state for which it is; a dream.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; It has been proposed that REM sleep is necessary for preparation of many integrative functions, of which one is consciousness.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; It supports the idea that sleep, and dreaming, is necessary preparation for the next day's processes. The scientific tracking of REM sleep stages can be measured by neuronal signals within the pontine brainstem. The interactions of aminergic inhibitory neurons and cholinergic excitatory neurons can be measured, and REM sleep occurs when aminergic cells are at their least active and cholinergic cells are at their most active.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt;

==== Evolution of REM ====

It has been stated that REM sleep is a recent evolutionary behavior in homeothermic animals. In both, there is increased REM sleep in the early stages of life. In humans, REM sleep peaks during the third trimester of gestation, and quickly falls after birth as primary consciousness declines and secondary consciousness grows with the development of the brain.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; The developing control over stages of sleep and waking suggests that sleep and REM has developed as a way to self-activate in order to anticipate awake-state circumstances.

=== Neuronic modeling{{anchor|Neuronic Modeling}} ===

Within the [[pons]], the modeling and tracking of these aminergic inhibitory neurons and cholinergic excitatory neurons occurs via the study of [[PGO waves]].&lt;ref name="Gott"&gt;Gott, J.A., Liley, D.T.J., Hobson, J.A., 2017. [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00089/full Towards a Functional Understanding of PGO Waves]. Front. Hum. Neurosci. 11:89. doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2017.00089.&lt;/ref&gt;
 These are phasic waves that occur in cycles, and originate from the pontine brainstem (P), [[lateral geniculate]] of [[thalamus]] (G), and [[occipital cortex]] (O). Aminergic [[monoamines]] serotonin, [[noradrenaline]], [[histamine]], and [[dopamine]] are balanced between acetylcholine cholinergic signals, and play a part in the regulation of cognition. Aminergic cell signal strength is lowest during REM sleep, increases during NREM, and is highest at waking.  Cholinergic cell signal strength is highest during REM, declines during NREM, and is lowest at waking. Changes in sleep state and phase occur when two activity paths cross.

== Theory ==

The development of consciousness is a gradual, time-consuming and lifelong process that builds upon and uses a more primitive virtual reality generator that is more definable in our dreams.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; As such, the development of secondary consciousness during the lifetime requires a blank consciousness that during REM sleep creates an imaginary self that has movements and experiences emotions.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; This is an experimental state not associated with awareness, and this state, or protoconscious, is able to be reached during childhood. This protoconsciousness is a protoself created early in life by the brain as a building block for consciousness to develop, and provides intrinsic predictions of external inputs created by dreaming.

=== Original activation-synthesis hypothesis model{{anchor|Original Activation-Synthesis Hypothesis Model}} ===

Hobson and McCarley originally proposed in the 1970s that the differences in the waking-NREM-REM sleep cycle was the result of interactions between aminergic REM-off cells and cholinergic REM-on cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1135627 |title=Neuronal excitability modulation over the sleep cycle: A structural and mathematical model |year=1975 |last1=McCarley |first1=R. |last2=Hobson |first2=J. |journal=Science |volume=189 |issue=4196 |pages=58–60 |pmid=1135627}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was perceived as the activation-synthesis model, stating that brain activation during REM sleep results in synthesis of dream creation.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; Hobson's five cardinal characteristics include: intense emotions, illogical content, apparent sensory impressions, uncritical acceptance of dream events, and difficulty in being remembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baruss |first=Imants |title=Alterations of Consciousness |year=2003 |publisher=American Psychological Association |location=Washington, DC |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current model – AIM{{anchor|Current Model - AIM}} ===

Thanks to the development of technology since the original proposal, new experimental data has been collected and additional mechanistic details of neuronal control have been developed. It has been determined that consciousness states can be described with three values, and the AIM model is a model that uses these values for representing the similarities and differences between waking and dreaming. It is a three-dimensional [[state-space]] model that describes different states of the brain and their variance throughout the day and night. It is composed of three different values: A – activation, I – input-output gating, and M – modulation. The model is limited however, in that it cannot yet explain the regional differences in brain activity that distinguish REM sleep from waking. Other limitations include the inability to quantifiably identify and measure M in humans. During waking and activation of primary and secondary consciousnesses, high values of A, I, and M have been observed, but during REM sleep high values of A but low I and M have been observed.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt;

==== Protoconsciousness ====

The protoconsciousness is template of consciousness that occurs during sleep, and on which can be constructed other mental conscious processes. Early in childhood, it has been said that this protoconsciousness is where secondary aspects of consciousness are originally developed and tested by the primary consciousness, and the person can slowly develop increased secondary consciousness throughout their life as their protoconscious template is further expanded, developed, and creates more vivid ideas and representations of secondary consciousness.

==== Activation (A) ====

Large parts of the brain that are activated and sending signals during waking are inactive during NREM sleep and become reactivated during REM sleep. It is based on the fact that the brain and its neural circuitry is plastic and self-regulating, especially in its own activation and inactivation. This was observed by two experiments: development of sleepiness after dopamine neuron destruction in [[substantia nigra]] in the [[midbrain]], and discovery of the [[reticular activating system]], which are visual cues received through our eyes and to our brain that begin the waking process, that waking consciousness depends sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=von Economo |first1=C. |year=1930 |title=Sleep as a problem of localization |journal=Journal of Nervous &amp; Mental Disease |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=249–59 |doi=10.1097/00005053-193003000-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(49)90219-9 |title=Brain stem reticular formation and activation of the EEG |year=1949 |last1=Moruzzi |first1=G. |last2=Magoun |first2=H.W. |journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=1 |pages=455–73 |pmid=18421835 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these studies, it became clear that activity levels and quality of consciousness were functions of brain activation and deactivation.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt;

==== Input-output gating (I){{anchor|Input-Output Gating (I)}} ====

It has been shown that the internal activation of the brain is associated with the inhibition of both external sensory input and motor output.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; This implies that the brain is actively kept offline during REM, and the brainstem guarantees the coordination of factors I and A via the input-output gate control within the brainstem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pmid=4867152 |year=1967 |last1=Pompeiano |first1=O |chapter=The neurophysiological mechanisms of the postrual and motor events during desynchronized sleep |pages=351–423 |editor1-first=Seymour S |editor1-last=Kety |editor2-first=Edward V |editor2-last=Evarts |editor3-first=Harold L |editor3-last=Williams |title=Sleep and altered states of consciousness |location=Baltimore |publisher=Williams and Wilkins |oclc=152543313}}&lt;/ref&gt; PGO waves play a part in the ability of the brain to remain asleep while constituting the building blocks for perception and fine motor control via their phasic coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00003976 |title=Dreaming and the brain: Toward a cognitive neuroscience of conscious states |year=2000 |last1=Hobson |first1=J. Allan |last2=Pace-Schott |first2=Edward F. |last3=Stickgold |first3=Robert |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=793–842; discussion 904–1121 |pmid=11515143}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has therefore been proposed that PGO signals are used in the construction of visual imagery of dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21570 |year=1977 |last1=Hobson |first1=J. Allan |last2=McCarley |first2=Robert W. |title=The Brain as A Dream State Generator: An Activation-Synthesis Hypothesis of the Dream Process |volume=134 |issue=12 |pages=1335–48 |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=134&amp;page=1335 |doi=10.1176/ajp.134.12.1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Modulation (M) ====

The neuromodulator release of aminergic neurons have a broad chemical influence on the brain; they instruct other neurons to keep or discard a record of information they've processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=J.R. |last2=Bloom |first2=F.E. |last3=Roth |first3=R.H. |year=1996 |title=The biochemical basis of Neuropharmacology |edition=7th |publisher=Oxford Univ. Press |location=Oxford}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanics of modulation are not known at this time, and modulation has yet to be quantitatively identified. Qualitatively, aminergic modulation has been shown to be strong during waking but lower during sleep, but more studies need to be conducted. Numerous studies have emerged from the discipline of [[computational neuroscience]] that support to the AIM model. The theory of [[Metalearning (neuroscience)|Metalearning]] in particular describes how these neuromodulators facilitate dynamic learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Implications ==

The three-dimensional AIM model shows that during the cycle of brain states waking-NREM-REM, the brain is dynamically changing constantly, and that this state space described by the AIM has an infinite number of subregions other than the main three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19750924 |year=2009 |last1=Voss |first1=U |last2=Holzmann |first2=R |last3=Tuin |first3=I |last4=Hobson |first4=JA |title=Lucid dreaming: A state of consciousness with features of both waking and non-lucid dreaming |volume=32 |issue=9 |pages=1191–200 |pmc=2737577 |journal=Sleep}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposes that via a protoconsciousness brain activation during sleep is necessary for the development and maintenance of waking consciousness and other higher-order brain functions such as problem solving. It suggests the possibility that the state of waking consciousness is only present in humans due to the evolution of extensive cortical structures within the brain.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; Dreaming is a state of the brain that is similar to yet different from the waking consciousness, and interaction and correlation between the two is necessary for optimal performance from both. One study conducted measuring brain activity via [[EEG]] used Hobson's AIM model to show that quantitatively dream consciousness is remarkably similar to waking consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.12.001 |title=Dreaming and the brain: From phenomenology to neurophysiology |year=2010 |last1=Nir |first1=Yuval |last2=Tononi |first2=Giulio |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=88–100 |pmid=20079677 |pmc=2814941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the philosophical term||Aletheia (disambiguation)}}

'''''Aletheia''''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀλήθεια|ἀλήθεια]]}}) is truth or disclosure in philosophy. It was used in Ancient Greek philosophy and revived in the 20th century by [[Martin Heidegger]].

It is a [[Greek (language)|Greek]] word variously translated as "unclosedness", "unconcealedness", "[[world disclosure|disclosure]]" or "[[truth]]". The literal meaning of the word {{lang|grc|[[alpha privative|ἀ]]–[[Lethe|λήθ]]εια}} is "the state of not being hidden; the state of being [[evidence|evident]]." It also means factuality or reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)lh/qeia|ἀλήθεια|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the opposite of [[lethe]], which literally means "oblivion", "forgetfulness", or "concealment".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|lh/qh|λήθη|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pindar's Olympian Ode,&lt;ref&gt;Pindar Olympian Ode.11.6 ff (trans. Conway) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.)&lt;/ref&gt; Aletheia is the daughter of Zeus, while Aesop in his Fables&lt;ref&gt;Aesop, Fables 530 (from Phaedrus Appendix 5)&lt;/ref&gt; said that she was crafted by Prometheus.

==Heidegger and ''aletheia''==
{{Further information|World disclosure}}
[[File:Van-gogh-shoes.jpg|thumb|300px|A painting that reveals (''alethe'') a whole world.  Heidegger mentions this particular work of Van Gogh's in "[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]".]]

In the early to mid 20th-century, [[Martin Heidegger]] brought renewed attention to the concept of ''aletheia'', by relating it to the notion of [[world disclosure|disclosure]], or the way in which things appear as entities in the world. While he initially referred to ''aletheia'' as "truth", specifically a form that is [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] in origin, Heidegger eventually corrected this interpretation, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To raise the question of ''aletheia'', of disclosure as such, is not the same as raising the question of truth. For this reason, it was inadequate and misleading to call ''aletheia'', in the sense of opening, truth."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''On Time and Being'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1972), p. 70, translation amended. The original in ''Zur Sache des Denkens'' (Tübingen: Max Niemayer, 1969), p. 86. Cited in [[Nikolas Kompridis]], ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future,'' (Boston: MIT Press, 2006), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heidegger gave an [[etymology|etymological]] analysis of ''aletheia'' and drew out an understanding of the term as 'unconcealedness'.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, M.  "Parmenides". Translated by Andre Schuwer and Richard Rojcewicz, Bloomington and Indianapolis, Indiana University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''aletheia'' is distinct from conceptions of truth understood as statements which accurately describe a state of affairs ([[Correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]]), or statements which fit properly into a system taken as a whole ([[Coherence theory of truth|coherence]]).  Instead, Heidegger focused on the elucidation of how an [[ontology|ontological]] "world" is disclosed, or opened up, in which things are made intelligible for human beings in the first place, as part of a holistically structured background of meaning.

Heidegger also wrote that "''Aletheia'', disclosure regarded as the opening of presence, is not yet truth. Is ''aletheia'' then less than truth? Or is it more because it first grants truth as ''adequatio'' and ''certitudo'', because there can be no presence and presenting outside of the realm of the opening?"&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''On Time and Being'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1972), p. 69, translation amended. Cited in Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future,'' (Boston: MIT Press, 2006), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger began his discourse on the reappropriation of ''aletheia'' in his magnum opus, ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927),&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, M. ''Being and Time''. translated by Joan Stambaugh, Albany, State University of New York Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded on the concept in his ''Introduction to Metaphysics''. For more on his understanding of ''aletheia'', see ''Poetry, Language, and Thought'', in particular the essay entitled "[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]", which describes the value of the work of art as a means to open a "clearing" for the appearance of things in the world, or to disclose their meaning for human beings.&lt;ref&gt;According to Heidegger, art "gives things their look, and human beings their outlook." From "The Origin of the Work of Art."&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger revised his views on ''aletheia'' as truth, after nearly forty years, in the essay "The End of Philosophy and the Task of Thinking," in ''On Time and Being''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4630">The '''biopsychosocial model''' is a model of health that includes  [[Biology|biological,]] [[Psychology|psychological,]] and [[Interpersonal relationship|social factors]], The model was proposed by [[George L. Engel]] in 1977 for understanding health and illness. It has been criticized for lacking philosophical coherence and being undisciplined.

==History==
The biopsychosocial model was proposed by George L. Engel to better reflect the development of illness through the complex interaction of [[biology|biological factors]] (genetic, biochemical, ''etc''), [[psychology|psychological factors]] (mood, personality, behavior, etc.), and [[interpersonal relationship|social factors]] (cultural, familial, socioeconomic, medical, etc.).&lt;ref name=Engel977&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Engel |first1=GL |title=The need for a new medical model: a challenge for biomedicine. |journal=Science |date=8 April 1977 |volume=196 |issue=4286 |pages=129–36 |pmid=847460}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Engel G. L. | year = 1980 | title = The clinical application of the biopsychosocial model | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 137 | issue = 5 | pages = 535–544 | doi=10.1176/ajp.137.5.535 | pmid=7369396}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=September 2018}}  The model provides a blueprint for research, a framework for teaching, and a design for action in the real world of health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Engel |first1=George L. |title=The Need for a New Medical Model: A Challenge for Biomedicine |journal=Holistic Medicine |date=6 July 2009 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=37–53 |doi=10.3109/13561828909043606}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=September 2018}}

The proposal of the model was in reaction to the perceived lack of science being used in psychiatry at the time and the reductionist approach used in other medicine fields—neither of which were adequate for treating illness.&lt;ref name=Engel977/&gt;{{primary-inline|date=September 2018}} In developing the model, Engel noted that it needed to be equally applicable for illnesses, rather than being for either physical or psychological problems.  By considering both in the same terms, it became obvious that both the inclusion of somatic and psychosocial factors were indispensable and the exclusion of either would impact on patient care.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Criticisms==
There have been a number of criticisms of the biopsychosocial model. Benning summarised the arguments against the model including that it lacked philosophical coherence, was insensitive to patients' subjective experience, was unfaithful to the general systems theory that Engel claimed it be rooted in, and that it engendered an undisciplined eclecticism that provides no safeguards against either the dominance or the under-representation of any one of the three domains of bio, psycho, or social.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Benning |first1=TB |title=Limitations of the biopsychosocial model in psychiatry. |journal=Advances in Medical Education and Practice |date=2015 |volume=6 |pages=347–52 |doi=10.2147/AMEP.S82937 |pmid=25999775 |pmc=4427076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that the approach borders on anarchy because of the suggestion that the target and focus on intervention is determined by the practitioner based on personal preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ghaemi |first1=SN |title=The rise and fall of the biopsychosocial model. |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |date=July 2009 |volume=195 |issue=1 |pages=3–4 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.109.063859 |pmid=19567886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, some became reductionistic about the model itself, attempting to predict small parts of one aspect to predict the functioning in one field of medicine, for example psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McLaren |first1=N |title=A critical review of the biopsychosocial model. |journal=The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry |date=February 1998 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=86–92; discussion 93–6 |doi=10.3109/00048679809062712 |pmid=9565189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6106">In mathematics, the '''Birman-Murakami-Wenzl (BMW) algebra''', introduced by {{harvtxt|Birman|Wenzl|1989}} and {{harvtxt|Murakami|1986}}, is a two-parameter family of [[algebra (mathematics)|algebra]]s C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ℓ'',&amp;nbsp;''m'') of dimension 1·3·5&amp;nbsp;···&amp;nbsp;(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) having the [[Hecke algebra of a finite group|Hecke algebra]] of the [[symmetric group]] as a quotient.  It is related to the  [[Kauffman polynomial]] of a [[link (knot theory)|link]]. It is a deformation of  the [[Brauer algebra]] in much the same way that Hecke algebras are deformations of the [[group algebra]] of the symmetric group.

==Definition==

For each natural number ''n'', the BMW algebra C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ℓ'',&amp;nbsp;''m'') is generated by G&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;,G&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;,...,G&lt;sub&gt;''n-1''&lt;/sub&gt;,E&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;,E&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;,...,E&lt;sub&gt;''n-1''&lt;/sub&gt; and relations:

:&lt;math&gt; G_iG_j=G_jG_i, \mathrm{if} \left\vert i-j \right\vert \geqslant 2,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G_i G_{i+1} G_i=G_{i+1} G_i G_{i+1},&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; E_i E_{i\pm1} E_i=E_i, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; G_i + {G_i}^{-1}=m(1+E_i), &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; G_{i\pm1} G_i E_{i\pm1} = E_i G_{i\pm1} G_i = E_i E_{i\pm1},&lt;/math&gt;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; G_{i\pm1} E_i G_{i\pm1} ={G_i}^{-1} E_{i\pm1} {G_i}^{-1}, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; G_{i\pm1} E_i E_{i\pm1}={G_i}^{-1} E_{i\pm1}, &lt;/math&gt;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; E_{i\pm1} E_i G_{i\pm1} =E_{i\pm1} {G_i}^{-1},  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; G_i E_i= E_i G_i = l^{-1} E_i,&lt;/math&gt;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; E_i G_{i\pm1} E_i =l E_i. &lt;/math&gt;

These relations imply the further relations: &lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; E_i E_j=E_j E_i, \mathrm{if} \left\vert i-j \right\vert \geqslant 2,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; (E_i)^2 = (m^{-1}(l+l^{-1})-1) E_i, &lt;/math&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; {G_i}^2 = m(G_i+l^{-1}E_i)-1. &lt;/math&gt;

This is the original definition given by Birman &amp; Wenzl. However a slight change by the introduction of some minus signs is  sometimes made, in accordance with Kauffman's 'Dubrovnik' version of his link invariant. In that way, the fourth relation in Birman &amp; Wenzl's original version is changed to &lt;br&gt;
(1) (Kauffman skein relation) 
::&lt;math&gt; G_i - {G_i}^{-1}=m(1-E_i), &lt;/math&gt;

:Given invertibility of ''m'', the rest of the relations in Birman &amp; Wenzl's original version can be reduced to &lt;br&gt;
(2) (Idempotent relation) 
::&lt;math&gt; (E_i)^2 = (m^{-1}(l-l^{-1})+1) E_i, &lt;/math&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
(3) (Braid relations) 
::&lt;math&gt; G_iG_j=G_jG_i, \text{if } \left\vert i-j \right\vert \geqslant 2, \text{ and } G_i G_{i+1} G_i=G_{i+1} G_i G_{i+1}, &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
(4) (Tangle relations) 
::&lt;math&gt; E_i E_{i\pm1} E_i=E_i \text{ and }  G_i G_{i\pm1} E_i = E_{i\pm1} E_i,&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
(5) (Delooping relations) 
::&lt;math&gt; G_i E_i= E_i G_i = l^{-1} E_i \text{ and } E_i G_{i\pm1} E_i =l E_i. &lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
*The dimension of C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ℓ'',&amp;nbsp;''m'') is &lt;math&gt; (2n)!/(2^nn! )&lt;/math&gt;.
*[[Iwahori-Hecke algebra]] associated with the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{S}_n,&lt;/math&gt; is a quotient of the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
*The [[Braid group]] embeds in the BMW algebra &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal{B}}_n \hookrightarrow {\mathcal{C}}_n  &lt;/math&gt;.

==Isomorphism between the BMW algebras and Kauffman's tangle algebras==
It is proved by {{harvtxt|Morton|Wassermann|1989}} that the BMW algebra C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ℓ'',&amp;nbsp;''m'') is isomorphic to the Kauffman's tangle algebra KT&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[isomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\phi : C_n \to KT_n &lt;/math&gt; is defined by &lt;br&gt;
[[Image:KauffmannTangleAlg 2.PNG]] and [[Image:KauffmannTangleAlg 3.PNG]]

==Baxterisation of Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra==
Define the face operator as
:&lt;math&gt; U_i(u)=1- \frac{i\sin u}{\sin \lambda \sin \mu}(e^{i(u-\lambda)} G_i -e^{-i(u-\lambda)}{G_i}^{-1})&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; are determined by 
:&lt;math&gt; 2\cos \lambda=1+(l-l^{-1})/m&lt;/math&gt; 
and 
:&lt;math&gt; 2\cos \lambda = 1+(l-l^{-1})/(\lambda \sin \mu)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Then the face operator satisfies the [[Yang-Baxter equation]]. 
:&lt;math&gt; U_{i+1}(v) U_i(u+v) U_{i+1}(u) = U_i(u) U_{i+1}(u+v) U_i(v)&lt;/math&gt; 
Now &lt;math&gt; E_i=U_i(\lambda) &lt;/math&gt; with 
:&lt;math&gt; \rho(u)=\frac{\sin (\lambda-u) \sin (\mu+u)}{\sin \lambda \sin \mu} &lt;/math&gt;. 
In the [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] &lt;math&gt; u \to \pm i  \infty &lt;/math&gt;, the [[braid theory|braid]]s &lt;math&gt; {G_j}^{\pm} &lt;/math&gt; can be recovered [[up to]] a [[scale factor]].

==History==
In 1984, [[Vaughan Jones]] introduced a new polynomial invariant of link isotopy types which is called the [[Jones polynomial]]. The invariants are related to the traces of irreducible representations of [[Hecke algebra of a finite group|Hecke algebras]] associated with the [[symmetric group]]s. In 1986, {{harvtxt|Murakami|1986}} showed that the [[Kauffman polynomial]] can also be interpreted as a function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; on a certain associative algebra. In 1989, {{harvtxt|Birman|Wenzl|1989}} constructed a two-parameter family of algebras C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ℓ'',&amp;nbsp;''m'') with the Kauffman polynomial K&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ℓ'',&amp;nbsp;''m'') as trace after appropriate renormalization.

==History==
The 2007-08 annual report of the [[Department of Telecommunications]] (DoT) stated that the requirements for the CMS project had been finalized by the [[Telecommunication Engineering Center]] (TEC), after deliberations with security agencies, and that the first phase of the project, covering the "national capital", was scheduled to be implemented by 31 March 2008. It also stated that C-DOT had finalized the "scope, architecture and dimensioning of the network".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/English%20annual%20report%202007-08_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008-09 annual report stated that proof of concept had been demonstrated and that R&amp;D activities for the project were "ongoing".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/AR_English_2008-09_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of India budgeted $150 million for the system as part of its [[12th Five Year Plan (Government of India)|12th Five Year Plan]], with [[Cabinet of India|Cabinet]] ultimately approving a higher amount.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The CMS was fast-tracked following the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]]. However, it faced repeated delays and missed the original deployment deadline of the end of 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-06-27/news/40233413_1_surveillance-system-government-surveillance-business-climate |title=Beyond Snowden: US surveillance system a useful model for democratic, terror-hit India|publisher=The Economic Times |date=2013-06-27 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the next deadline of March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=PTI|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/telecom-central-monitoring-system-in-10-circles-by-december-914389.html |title=Telecom Central Monitoring System in 10 circles by December |publisher=''Firstpost'' |date=2013-06-28 |accessdate=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMS was first announced publicly in a press release by the [[Press Information Bureau]] (PIB), dated 26 November 2009.&lt;ref name="firstpost1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Raza |first=Danish |url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/indias-central-monitoring-system-security-cant-come-at-cost-of-privacy-944475.html |title=India's Central Monitoring System: Security can't come at cost of privacy |publisher=''Firstpost'' |date=2013-07-10 |accessdate=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release lacked details on the system but stated that CMS was a "centralized system to monitor communications on mobile phones, landlines and the internet in the country" and claimed that the project would "strengthen the security environment in the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=54679 |title=Press Information Bureau English Releases |publisher=Pib.nic.in |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; CMS was mentioned by [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (India)|Minister of Communications and Information Technology]] [[Kapil Sibal]] on 1 January 2011, while addressing the media to announce his 100-day agenda for the Indian telecom sector. Sibal mentioned it in passing, telling the media that "Steps will be taken to establish the Central Monitoring System which will facilitate and prevent misuse of lawful interception facility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sandeep Joshi |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1023117.ece |title=100-day plan: Sibal promises transparency in telecom sector |publisher=The Hindu |date=2011-01-01 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=PTI |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-01/india/28373595_1_spectrum-telecom-minister-new-telecom-policy |title=Govt to come out with new telecom policy: Sibal |publisher=The Times of India |date=2011-01-01 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement was described as "muted" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' [[Time (magazine)|magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trivedi |first=Anjani |url=http://world.time.com/2013/06/30/in-india-prism-like-surveillance-slips-under-the-radar/ |title=In India, Prism-like Surveillance Slips Under the Radar |publisher=World.time.com |date=2013-06-30 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March 2011, Minister of State for Communications &amp; Information Technology, [[Sachin Pilot]] stated that the CMS was to be set up for the "[[Lawful Interception]] and [[Surveillance|Monitoring]] of communications to address the national security concerns. It will automize the present manual system of interception and monitoring, which will enhance the secrecy of intercepted numbers and will cut down the delay in provisioning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=70747 |title=Press Information Bureau English Releases |publisher=Pib.nic.in |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 2012, ''[[The New Indian Express]]'' reported that the [[National Investigation Agency]] (NIA) had requested for authorization to access CMS once it became functional. The paper also stated that a pilot trial was underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yadav |first=Yatish |url=http://newindianexpress.com/nation/article1300012.ece |title=NIA seeks Central Monitoring System to tap phones |publisher=The New Indian Express |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mint'' cited an internal note from the DoT dated 10 June 2013, which reportedly said that CMS had "undergone successful pilots" and was "likely to be commissioned" by the end of 2013.&lt;ref name="livemint1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Leslie D’Monte &amp; Joji Thomas Philip |url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/pR5zc8hCD1sn3NWQwa7cQJ/The-new-surveillance-state.html |title=How the world's largest democracy is preparing to snoop on its citizens |publisher=Livemint |date=2013-07-03 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government began rolling out the CMS, state by state, in April 2013.&lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt;

In July 2013, [[BlackBerry (company)|BlackBerry]] granted the Indian Government access to its messaging services.&lt;ref name="indiatimes5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-07-10/news/40492683_1_blackberry-services-blackberry-messenger-interception-solution |title=Government, BlackBerry end dispute over interception of BB devices|publisher=The Economic Times |date=2013-07-10 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is presumed that CMS will be used to monitor these services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Phil Muncaster |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/07/11/blackberry_gives_indian_spooks_access/ |title=BlackBerry gives Indian spooks BBM and BIS access |publisher=The Register |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it may be done through C-DOT's [[Lawful Intercept and Monitoring]] (LIM) system.&lt;ref&gt;http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/india-spies-on-its-internet-users-too&lt;/ref&gt; It will make two amendments to the Indian Telegraph Act to allow for intercepting and monitoring through the CMS and to allow "collecting, storing and analyzing message pertaining to information of any nature by the Telegraph Authority".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=tech2 News Staff |url=http://tech2.in.com/news/general/norms-for-interception-of-calls-and-messages-expected-to-be-finalised-by-august-end/907410 |title=Norms for interception of calls and messages expected to be finalised by August end |publisher=Tech2.in.com |date=2013-07-10 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interception Authorization ==
In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 7 of the [[Indian Telegraph Act]], 1885 (13 of 1885), the Government of [[India]] made [http://cis-india.org/internet-governance/resources/rule-419-a-indian-telegraph-rules-1951 Rule 419A] of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directions for interception of any message or class of messages under sub-section (2) of Section 5 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 shall not be issued except by an order made by the Secretary to the Government of India in the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] in the case of Government of India and by the Secretary to the State Government in-charge of the Home Department in the case of a State Government. In unavoidable circumstances, such order may be made by an officer, not below the rank of a Joint Secretary to the Government of India, who has been duly authorized by the Union Home Secretary or the State Home Secretary, as the case may be:

Provided that in emergent cases:

(i) in remote areas, where obtaining of prior directions for interception of messages or class of messages is not feasible; or

(ii) for operational reasons, where obtaining of prior directions for interception of message or class of messages is not feasible;

the required interception of any message or class of messages shall be carried out with the prior approval of the Head or the second senior most officer of the authorized security ''i.e.'' Law Enforcement Agency at the Central Level and the officers authorised in this behalf, not below the rank of Inspector General of Police at the state level but the concerned competent authority shall be informed of such interceptions by the approving authority within three working days and that such interceptions shall be got confirmed by the concerned competent authority within a period of seven working days. If the confirmation from the competent authority is not received within the stipulated seven days, such interception shall cease and the same message or class of messages shall not be intercepted thereafter without the prior approval of the Union Home Secretary or the State Home Secretary, as the case may be.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court has upheld the constitutional validity of interceptions and monitoring under Section 5(2) of the Act through its order dated 18.12.1996 in Writ Petition (C) No.256/1991 by People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) Vs. Union of India. It has also observed that the right to hold a telephone conversation in the privacy of one's home or office without interference can certainly be claimed as “Right to Privacy”, and accordingly, held that telephone tapping would infringe the Right to Life and Right to Freedom of Speech &amp; Expression enshrined in Articles 21 and 19(1)(a) respectively of the Constitution of India, unless it is permitted under the procedure established by law. The Hon’ble Court further observed that Section 5(2) of the Act clearly provides that ‘occurrence of any public emergency’ or ‘interest of public safety’ is a sine qua non for the application of these provisions. Neither of these are secretive conditions or situations. Either of the situations would be apparent to a reasonable person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==System details==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
Earlier the provisioning of Interception of the Telephone was being done by the Telecom operators on the basis of duly authorized order by the competent authority in accordance with 419A telephone rule. Traditionally, the Law Enforcement Agency was approaching the various telecom companies based on the numbering scheme of the target telephone number. In CMS setup there is no change in the Interception authorization order envisaged in 419A telephone rule except that now the [[Law Enforcement]] Agency will go to only TERM Cell for any interception order provisioning irrespective of telephone numbering scheme. There is no change in the existing LIS / LIM system in the telecom network. The TERM Cell who are the field unit of DOT and carries the enforcement and regulation of licensing conditions in the field will be sole authority to provision the interception orders but interception orders will be obtained by Law Enforcement Agencies in according to the 419A telephone rule.

==Government objective==
Government has set up the Centralized Monitoring System (CMS) to automate the process of Lawful Interception &amp; Monitoring of telecommunications technology. Government of India on 2015-12-02 in a reply to parliament question no. 595 on scope, objectives and framework of the CMS has struck a balance between national security, online privacy and free speech informed that to take care of the privacy of citizens, lawful interception and monitoring is governed by the Section 5(2) of Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 read with Rule 419A of Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Rules, 2007 wherein oversight mechanism exists in form of review committee under chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary at Central Government level and Chief Secretary of the State at the State Government level. The same mechanism is applicable for the interception under the CMS Project also. Additionally, there is an inbuilt mechanism of check and balance as Security Agencies/Law Enforcement Agencies cannot provision the target and the provisioning agency cannot see the content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Media reaction==
''[[Business Standard]]'' criticised the fact that a warrant need not be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/india-s-digital-battleground-113062101013_1.html|title=India's digital battleground|last=Shukla|first=Ajai|date=21 June 2013|work=[[Business Standard]]|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Firstpost]]'' criticised the lack of information from the government about the project and the lack of a legal recourse for a citizen whose personal details were misused or leaked.&lt;ref name="firstpost1"/&gt; ''[[The Hindu]]'' also criticised the lack of information available about the system.&lt;ref name="thehindu2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Deepa Kurup |url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/in-the-dark-about-indias-prism/article4817903.ece |title=In the dark about 'India's Prism' |publisher=The Hindu |date=2013-06-16 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Indian Express]]'' criticised the introduction of the system in the absence of accountability and "any reasonably effective safeguards" to protect privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/way-to-watch/1133737/0 |title=Way to watch |publisher=Indian Express |date=2013-06-26 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times of India]]'' criticised the introduction of CMS without public debate or Parliamentary accountability. The paper also felt that Indian privacy laws were "lax",&lt;ref name="indiatimes3"/&gt; and "far worse than American law on these matters".&lt;ref name="indiatimes3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-06-13/news/39952596_1_nsa-india-us-homeland-security-dialogue-national-security-letters |title=Indian surveillance laws &amp; practices far worse than US|publisher=The Economic Times |date=2013-06-18 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Forbes|Forbes India]]'' pointed out that a consequence of CMS would be that innocent citizens could be wrongly accused of criminal activity.&lt;ref name="forbesindia1"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' argued that India did not need centralised interception facilities to have centralised tracking of interception requests. The paper also expressed supported for a strong privacy law, and advised Indian citizens to "take greater care of their own privacy and safeguard the security of their communications".&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Prakash |first=Pranesh |url=http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/11/can-india-trust-its-government-on-privacy/ |title=Can India Trust Its Government on Privacy? |location=Hyderabad |publisher=India.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2012-10-11 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights and civil-liberties groups reactions==
Human rights and civil-liberties groups have expressed concerns that the CMS is prone to abuse, and is an infringement of privacy and civil liberties.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|author=R. Jai Krishna |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/07/06/indias-surveillance-program-stalled/ |title=India's Surveillance Program Stalled |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=2013-07-06 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have described it as "abuse of privacy rights and security-agency overreach".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Meenakshi Ganguly, the [[South Asia]] director of [[Human Rights Watch]], felt that the move toward extensive "surveillance capabilities enabled by digital communications" suggests that governments are now "casting the net wide, enabling intrusions into private lives". Ganguly also felt that increasing surveillance around the world was an attempt by governments to "grapple with the power of social media that can enable spontaneous street protests".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

[[Praveen Swami]], strategic affairs editor of [[Network 18|Network18]], felt that "There is also the argument that the threat of a cyber attack is deliberately overplayed&amp;nbsp;... it is far-fetched. So there is a need for balance".&lt;ref name="business-standard1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/india-s-digital-battleground-113062101013_1.html |title=India's digital battleground |publisher=''Business Standard'' |date=2013-06-21 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cynthia Wong |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/06/07/india-new-monitoring-system-threatens-rights |title=India: New Monitoring System Threatens Rights |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=2013-06-07 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pawan Sinha, a human rights teacher at Delhi University, believes that bypassing courts was "really very dangerous" and could be "easily misused".&lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt;

Anja Kovacs of the Internet Democracy Project, and a fellow at the New Delhi-based Centre for Internet and Society, felt that there was "a growing discrepancy and power imbalance between citizens and the state" and that in the Indian scenario, there were "no checks and balances in place".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Trivedi |first=Anjani |url=http://world.time.com/2013/06/30/in-india-prism-like-surveillance-slips-under-the-radar/#ixzz2YpWhRsrB |title=In India, Prism-like Surveillance Slips Under the Radar |publisher=''Time'' |date=2013-06-30 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunil Abraham, executive director of Bangalore-based non-profit Centre for Internet and Society, advised Indians to "stop using proprietary software, shift to free/open source software" and "encrypt all sensitive Internet traffic and email using software like TOR and GNU Privacy Guard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-22/internet/40133453_1_source-software-cyanogenmod-encryption |title=Cyber experts suggest using open source software to protect privacy |publisher=The Times of India |date=2013-06-22 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pranesh Prakash, director of policy at the Centre for Internet and Society, warned that the lack of privacy laws and government accountability makes the programme "very worrisome."&lt;ref name="indiatimes2"&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:E8086-Bishkek-glass-bottle-collection-point.jpg|thumb|Refillable glass bottles collected, and deposits refunded, at a collection point in [[Bishkek]], [[Kyrgyzstan]]. Deposit values (from 50 tyiyn to 2 [[Kyrgyz som]], i.e. 2–5 U.S. cents) for various bottle types are posted next to the sample bottles on a rack.]]

'''Container-deposit legislation''' (also known as a '''deposit-refund system''', '''bottle bill''', or '''deposit-return system''') is any law that requires the collection of a monetary deposit on beverage containers (refillable or non-refillable) at the point of sale.  When the container is returned to an authorized redemption center, or retailer in some jurisdictions, the deposit is partly or fully refunded to the redeemer (presumed to be the original purchaser). It is a [[deposit-refund system]].

Governments may pass container deposit legislation for several reasons, including, for example:
* To encourage recycling and complement existing curbside recycling programs, to reduce energy and material usage for containers
* To specifically reduce beverage container [[litter]] along [[highway]]s, in lakes and rivers, and on other public or private properties (where beverage container litter occurs, a nominal deposit provides an economic incentive to clean it up; this is a significant source of [[income]] to some poor individuals and [[non-profit]] civic organizations)
* To extend the usable lifetime of taxpayer-funded landfills

Deposits that are not redeemed are often kept by distributors or bottlers to cover the costs of the system (including handling fees paid to retailers or redemption enters to collect, sort, and handle the containers) or are escheated to the governmental entity involved to fund environmental programs. 

==History==
A &amp; R Thwaites &amp; Co in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], announced in 1799 the provision of artificial "[[soda water]]" and that they paid 2 shillings a dozen for returned bottles. [[Schweppes]] that also was in the business of artificially made [[mineral water]]s, had a similar recycling policy about 1800, without any legislation.&lt;ref name="britishsoftdrinks.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishsoftdrinks.com/PDF/history.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014013216/http://www.britishsoftdrinks.com/PDF/history.pdf |archivedate=October 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish bottled beverage companies also voluntarily introduced such a scheme to encourage the return of their bottles for reuse.[https://web.archive.org/web/20140426202005/http://www.agbarr.co.uk/ces_general.nsf/wpg/about_us-frequently_asked_questions.html] In Sweden a standard system for deposits on bottles and recycling was established in 1884, eventually by law. The popular demand for a deposit on [[aluminium can]]s to reduce littering led to legislation in 1984.

In North America, [[British Columbia]]'s legislated deposit-return system, enacted in 1970, is the oldest such program in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bottlebill.org/legislation/canada/britishcolumbia.htm|title=BottleBill.org - The British Columbia Deposit Law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===

[[File:Reverse vending machine for the NSW Container Deposit Scheme at the Kooringal Mall 2.jpg|thumb|Reverse container vending machine in [[Kooringal, New South Wales]]]]
In the days when bottles were washed and re-used, drinks manufacturers paid for the return of their (proprietary) containers, but with the advent of [[disposable|single-use]] containers great savings were possible, leaving their disposal as the consumer's responsibility.

While a national scheme has been repeatedly delayed largely due to unveiled threats from the beverage industry of multimillion-dollar ad campaigns against politicians who support it and disagreements between the states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/millions-of-dollars-in-attack-ads-coming-in-march-20141024-11b5pi.html|title=Millions of dollars in attack ads coming in March|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been a growing momentum of state-based operated container deposit schemes (CDS). Currently all states except Victoria and Tasmania look to have some sort of state-based container deposit scheme operating within the next 2 years. With 8 billion beverage containers landfilled or littered every year in Australia, proponents argue that it is the most effective method to reduce such litter; and improve recycling above that achieved by kerbside. It also has many co-benefits such as funds for charities and several thousand new jobs, that cannot be achieved by other approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boomerangalliance.org.au|title=Boomerang Alliance|work=Boomerang Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The state of [[South Australia]] charges a refundable deposit of AUD 10 [[Australian dollar|cents]] per drinks carton, can or bottle (only containers marked as eligible for refund; does not include wine &amp; spirits bottles, milk cartons, or concentrated/and or vegetable juice intended to be diluted before consumption). This has been in place since 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.sa.gov.au/environmental_info/container_deposit|title=Request Rejected|website=www.epa.sa.gov.au|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall return rate is 79.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Container deposits|url=http://www.epa.sa.gov.au/environmental_info/container_deposit|website=Environment Protection Authority|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Northern Territory]] introduced a container deposit scheme in 2012.  A 10-cent (AUD) refundable deposit is charged on all beverage containers with the exception of unflavoured milk, soy milk, cordial bottles (undiluted), concentrated fruit/vegetable juice intended to be diluted before consumption, and still or sparkling wine (in glass bottles). Unredeemed deposits remain with the producer/filler. In 2015-2016, the system achieved a total return rate of 54%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Annual Report 2015-16|journal=Environment Protection (Beverage Containers and Plastic Bags) Act|url=https://ntepa.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/387987/2015-16-CDS-Annual-Report.pdf|publisher=Northern Territory Environment Protection Authority|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The state of [[New South Wales]] (the most populated state, with 7.5 million residents) recently announced that it would be adopting a 10-cent (AUD) deposit scheme, which commenced on December 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSW CDS|url=http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/waste/cds-intro.htm|website=NSW Environment &amp; Heritage|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is expected to double the state's beverage container recycling rate to roughly 80 percent. 
* On July 22, 2016, the [[Queensland]] government announced that the state would introduce a container deposit scheme. The government has confirmed that the initiative will start in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2016/7/22/container-deposit-scheme-for-queensland|title=Container deposit scheme for Queensland|website=qld.gov.au|publisher=Queensland government|language=en-AU|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the scheme, it is expected that a 10-cent (AUD) refund will be provided for empty drink containers between 150ml and 3L. 
* The state of [[Western Australia]] has announced the start date of a state-based scheme commencing in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-17/10-cent-container-deposit-scheme-for-wa-recyclable-bottles-cans/7751328|title=Premier Colin Barnett announces 2018 start date for cash for containers scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme will apply to certain empty drink containers ranging in size from 150ml to 3L and will exclude domestically consumed drink containers such as wine and spirit bottles, milk and juice containers. The amount of the deposit/refund will be AUD 10-cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Programs - Department of Water and Environmental Regulation|url=https://www.der.wa.gov.au/our-work/programs/111-wa-container-deposit-scheme|website=Department of Water and Environmental Regulation|publisher=Government of Western Australia|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=en-au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belgium ===
Smaller beer bottles (250 or 330&amp;nbsp;mL) carry a [[Euro|€]]0.10 deposit, and larger ones (750&amp;nbsp;mL or 1&amp;nbsp;L) a €0.20 one. Some fruit-juice bottles, such as those sold by Oxfam Wereldwinkels/Magasins du Monde], carry a €0.30 deposit. Some hard plastic milk bottles such as those sold by [[Delhaize Group|Delhaize]] carry a €0.20 deposit.

===Canada===
{{See also|Recycling in Canada}}In 1970, British Columbia became the first Canadian province to establish a mandatory deposit-return system for soft drinks and beer containers. Today, nearly all provinces and territories in Canada have followed suit; the territory of Nunavut is the only jurisdiction in Canada that has yet to implement some sort of deposit refund system. 

Deposits range from CAD$0.05 to CAD$0.40 per unit depending on the material and size of the container and whether the container contains an alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage. 

Below is a brief summary of each program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/WPW2016-FINAL-with-cover.pdf|title=Who Pays What 2016|last=CM Consulting|first=|date=2016|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
* British Columbia: While the original program covered only carbonated soft drinks and beer, the deposit legislation expanded to include any ready-to-serve beverage sold in a container that is sealed by its manufacturer (e.g. bottled water, juice, new age drinks, and alcohol), excluding milk and milk substitutes. There are currently two stewardship agencies in BC that carry out deposit-refund obligations on behalf of beverage producers: [[Encorp Pacific]] (for non-alcoholic beverages, wine, spirits, some ciders and coolers, and some import beer) and Brewers Distributor Ltd. (BDL) (for domestic coolers, beers, and ciders). In 2017, BC's program recovered over 1 billion containers for an overall return-rate of 75.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.return-it.ca/ar2017/executive-summary.php|title=Encorp Pacific Executive Summary 2017|access-date=2 October 2018|publisher=[[Encorp Pacific]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alberta: All beverage containers ([[glass bottle]]s, [[Beverage can|metal cans]], [[Tetra Pak]]s, gable-top cartons, bags-in-boxes, [[plastic bottle]]s and jugs, drink pouches), including milk containers (Alberta was the first jurisdiction in North America to accept and charge a deposit on milk containers in June 2009), are charged deposits at the point of sale; 10¢ for containers 1 L or less, and 25¢ for containers larger than 1 L. Containers can be dropped off at depots and are picked up by the Alberta Beverage Container Recycling Corporation. In 2014, over 2 billion beverage containers were returned to Alberta depots for an overall return rate of 83%. 
* Saskatchewan: Established in 1988, Saskatchewan's deposit-return program applies to all ready-to-serve beverage containers, except those for meal replacements, or dietary supplements. SARCAN began taking milk and milk substitutes on April 1, 2017. SARCAN Recycling is responsible for administering the program and operates under contract to the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment. In fiscal 2014-2015, a total of 405.6 million beverage containers were returned to SARCAN recycling depots for an overall container return rate of 87%. 
* Manitoba: Manitoba's program was implemented in 2010 and is limited to beer containers, which are charged a deposit of CAD$0.10 or $0.20 depending on the size. Other containers (except milk) are charged a non-refundable $0.02 per unit levy (Container Recycling Fee) and can be recycled in municipal curbside recycling programs.
* Ontario: The Ontario Deposit Return Program (ODRP), which came into force in February 2007, is a voluntary program implemented by the provincial government that covers wine, spirits, and imported beer containers (plastics, metal, bimetal, glass, gable top, Tetra Pak, bag-in-box containers). Because there is no law mandating that wine and spirits be placed on deposit, they may be added to municipal blue box programs voluntarily. Refillable and non-refillable beer containers are collected through a separate program administered and operated by Brewers Retail Inc. (The Beer Store). Alcoholic beverage containers, as well as any associated packaging, can be returned to 443 beer store locations, 113 breweries (beer containers only), 141 retail partner stores, 63 LCBO northern agency stores, 4 additional LCBO stores, and 115 empty bottle dealers (small independent depots contracted in more remote locations where beer retailers are not available), for a total of 879 redemption locations. TBS trucks collect these empty containers and back-haul them to various distribution centres where recyclables are sent to a processing facility for sorting, baling, and shipping to market. Refillable bottles are sent back to the brewers for washing and refill. Containers returned through Ontario's deposit-return system showed a total recycling rate of 89% for 2014-2015, while refillable beer bottles were returned at a rate of 98%.

* Quebec: Quebec's deposit-return system was established in 1984 and covers beer and carbonated soft drink containers. Deposits range from CAD$0.05¢ to $0.20 depending on the size, material and content of the container. Boissons Gazeuses Environnement (BGE) administers the program for non-refillable soft-drink containers on behalf of industry, while Recyc-Quebec oversees the beer container collection program. In 2014, the recycling rate for containers recovered via the deposit-return system was 78% (includes data for refillable bottles). 
* New Brunswick: This program was created in 1992 and covers all ready-to-drink, non-refillable beverage containers 5L and under, including soft-drinks, beer, wine, spirits, flavoured waters, fruit juices, vegetable juices, and low alcohol drinks. Containers for milk and milk products (and substitutes) as well as processed apple cider are exempt. Encorp Atlantic Inc. is the stewardship agency responsible for managing the collection, transportation, and partial processing of non-alcoholic beverage containers on behalf of brand-owners, and New Brunswick Liquor (NB Liquor) is responsible for the collection of alcoholic beverage containers. Program oversight is the responsibility of the Department of Environment. New Brunswick's deposit-return program is somewhat unique in that it operates under a “half-back” model where only half of the original deposit is refunded to the consumer when a container is returned for recycling. The unrefunded portion of the deposit is used to cover the costs of administering the program and part of it also goes towards the province's Environmental Trust Fund, which is used for environmental conservation and other provincial initiatives aimed at reducing waste. In 2014, New Brunswick's recycling rate for non-refillable containers was 73%.
* Nova Scotia: Launched on April 1, 1996, Nova Scotia's deposit-return program applies to all ready-to-drink beverage containers excluding milk, milk products, soya milk, and rice beverages. Other containers that are exempt from the program are certain meal replacements, formulated liquid diets, foods for very low energy diets, thickened juices, baby formulas, concentrates, and non-alcoholic beverages in containers of 5L or more. The organization responsible for managing the program is DivertNS (formerly the Resource Recovery Fund Board Inc.). Like New Brunswick's program, Nova Scotia's deposit-return system is based on a “half-back” model where only half of the original deposit paid per container is refunded to the consumer. The non-refundable portion of the deposit is used as revenue by DivertNS to help pay for program costs. In 2014, the program collected 334 million non-refillable beverage containers for a recycling rate of 84%. 
* Prince Edward Island: The province's deposit-return system was launched on May 3, 2008 as a replacement to a law that had prohibited the sale of non-refillable soft drink containers. The program is overseen and administered by the Department of Environment, Energy, and Forestry and covers all ready-to-drink beverage containers up to 5L, except those used for dairy products, milk substitutes, or nutritional supplements. Similar to the other Atlantic provinces, PEI's deposit-return system is based on a “half-back” model where only 50% of the original deposit paid is refunded to the consumer when he/she returns the empty container to a depot. In 2014-2015, PEI had a non-refillable beverage container recycling rate of 80% and a total container recycling rate of 82%. 
* Yukon: Introduced in 1992, Yukon's deposit-return program covers all ready-to-drink beverage containers (glass, plastic, steel, aluminum, and Tetra Pak), excluding those containing milk and milk substitutes. The program is managed by the Department of Community Services and requires consumers to pay a surcharge on the purchase of certain beverage containers, which includes a refundable deposit and a non-refundable recycling fund fee (RFF). Upon return of the empty container to a depot or processor, a portion of the surcharge (the refundable deposit) is refunded to the consumer, while the non-refundable RFF is kept by the retailer and remitted to the territorial Recycling Fund, where unredeemed deposits also go. In 2014, Yukon had a non-refillable recycling rate of 82%. In May 2016, the Yukon government announced changes to the Beverage Container Regulation. These changes, which are expected to be implemented August 1, 2017, will affect the surcharges and refunds applicable to beverage containers including milk and milk substitutes, and will simplify the regulation. Once the territory's new regulations kick in, all beverage containers will fall into two categories: (1) 750ml and less, including all milk &amp; milk substitutes (surcharge 10-cents, refund 5-cents), and (2) 750ml and more (surcharge 35-cents, refund 25-cents). 
* Northwest Territories: Launched on November 1, 2005, Northwest Territories’ deposit-return program covers all ready-to-serve beverage containers made of glass, plastics, aluminum, bi-metal, and mixed materials, including juice, milk and liquid milk products (added February 2010), soda, water, beer, wine, liquor and other alcoholic beverages. Excluded from the program are containers for infant formula; containers for milk and liquid milk products smaller than 30ml; and powder milk. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DNR) is responsible for administering the program. Similar to Yukon's program, the total surcharge per container includes a refundable deposit and a non-refundable handling fee. Whereas the refundable deposit is returned to the consumer when they return the beverage container to a depot, the non-refundable handing fee is put into the Environment Fund and is used to help cover program costs. In fiscal 2014, approximately 26 million beverage containers were returned for reuse or recycling, translating into an overall recycling rate of 89%.

=== Croatia ===
Since 2006, a refundable deposit of 0.5 HRK (Croatian Kuna) has been levied on non-refillable containers (except dairy products) with minimum volume of 200ml. Retailers over 200m2 are obliged to take-back containers. Collection is mostly manual, although some collection occurs with reverse vending machines. Retailers must sort containers by material type (PET bottles, aluminum/steel cans, and glass bottles). The scheme is government operated and there is a collection target of 95%. In 2015, the scheme recovered up to 90% of all non-refillable containers placed on the Croatian market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BOOK-Deposit-Global-24May2017-for-Website.pdf|title=Deposit Systems for One-Way Beverage Containers: Global Overview (2016)|last=Reloop Platform &amp; CM Consulting|first=|date=2016|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Czech Republic ===
In the [[Czech Republic]] most beer is sold in returnable glass bottles that carry a CZK 3 deposit. These bottles are collected by shops and supermarkets. Reverse vending machines have mostly replaced human staff. There is also a CZK 100 deposit on plastic beer crates with a 20 bottle capacity. Most reverse vending machines accept an entire crate full of empty bottles, returning CZK 160. There is no deposit on other containers.

===Denmark===
&lt;!--[[Image:DK_PantC.jpg|thumb|right|Deposit type C in Denmark]]--&gt;
In [[Denmark]] the selling of aluminium beverage cans was forbidden between 1982 and 2002. However this regulation violated [[European Union law]]. Therefore, the [[European Union|EU]] forced Denmark to replace it, and the new legislation, passed in 2002, introduced a container deposit scheme. The law covers beer (alcohol content &gt;0.5% by volume), carbonated soft drinks (alcohol content 0-0.5%), energy drinks, mineral water, iced tea, ready-to-drink beverages, and mixer products (alcohol content 0.5%-10%). Excluded from the scheme are fruit squash, juice, cocoa, wine and spirits, and milk. The deposit levels are as follows&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.danskretursystem.dk/en/all-about-deposits/deposit-amounts/|title=Deposit Amounts in Denmark|last=Dansk Retur System|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 
* Disposable aluminium and glass containers under 1L and refillable glass bottles  under 0.5L: 1DKK 
* Disposable and refillable plastic containers under 1L: 1.5DKK
* Metal and plastic containers equal to or greater than 1L or refillable glass bottles over 0.5L: 3DKK
The deposit system operator is [[Dansk Retursystem]] A/S, a private non-profit organization. Most collection (95%) is done automatically using reverse vending machines, but some (5%) is done manually. In 2014, the system achieved a total return rate of 89%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BOOK-Deposit-Global-24May2017-for-Website.pdf|title=Deposit Systems for One-Way Beverage Containers|last=Reloop Platform &amp; CM Consulting|first=|date=2016|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Estonia ===
&lt;!--[[Image:PfandEstlandB.jpg|thumb|right|Deposit symbol in Estonia ("B" on a 1.5&amp;nbsp;L-bottle)]]--&gt;
In [[Estonia]] there is a universal deposit and recycling system since 2005 for one-time and refillable containers. This includes soft drinks, water, beer, cider, juice, juice concentrates, nectars, and low-ethanol alcoholic beverages (up to 6% volume). It does not include strong alcoholic beverages such as wine or vodka, glass jars, or Tetra Paks. The deposit is €0.10 on all metal, plastic, and glass beverage containers of all sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eestipandipakend.ee/en/how-does-the-deposit-system-work/|title=How does the deposit system work?|last=Eesti Pandipakend OU|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is operated by Eesti Pandipakend OÜ, which is a producer responsibility organization representing the Estonian Association of Brewers, the Association of Producers of Soft Drinks, the Association of Importers of Soft Drinks and Beer, and the Estonian Retailers Association.

In 2015, 90% of all PET bottles, 70% of all aluminum cans and 87% of all glass bottles sold in Estonia were returned for recycling and/or reuse. The overall return rate was 82.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BOOK-Deposit-Global-24May2017-for-Website.pdf|title=Deposit Systems for One-Way Beverage Containers: Global Overview|last=Reloop Platform &amp; CM Consulting|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Fiji===
The United Nations Development Programme had funded a feasibility study to look at the possibility of establishing a deposit-return system in Fiji, building on the experience gained from their successful projects in Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uncrd.or.jp/content/documents/RT4_01_Fiji.pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Fijian Government approved the Environment Management [Waste Disposal and Recycling][Amendment] Regulations 2011, and the Environment Management [Container Deposit] Regulations 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.abc.us.org/index.php/apjee/article/download/724/pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regulations provide the legal framework for the introduction of a container deposit and refund system, allowing beverage producers and importers to adjust pricing and accommodate deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fijisun.com.fj/2011/09/29/cabinet-approves-waste-management-laws/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regulations will also allow the Department of Environment to register and establish the Managing Agency that will administer Fiji's container deposit system, and establish a revolving fund account to receive all deposits paid by producers for all beverages sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fbc.com.fj/fiji/174/cabinet-approves-amendments-to-laws|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No further details are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4943:cabinet-approves-environment-management-waste-disposal-and-recycling-amendment-regulations-2011&amp;catid=49:cabinet-releases&amp;Itemid=166 |title=Cabinet Approves Environment Management (Waste Disposal And Recycling) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 |date=29 September 2011 |publisher=Fijian Government |accessdate=2 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311150347/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4943%3Acabinet-approves-environment-management-waste-disposal-and-recycling-amendment-regulations-2011&amp;catid=49%3Acabinet-releases&amp;Itemid=166 |archivedate=11 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
Deposits were introduced on aluminum cans in 1996, on PET bottles in 2008, and on glass bottles in 2012. Almost all soft drinks are covered by the program, in addition to water, beer, cider, long drinks, sport drinks, juice, and liquor/spirits/wine sold by Alko. Milk is exempt. The system is administered by Suomen palautuspakkaus Oy (abbr. Palpa), which is a private consortium of beverage importers and manufacturers. In 2016, aluminum cans were recovered at a rate of 96%, PET bottles 92%, and one-way glass 88%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.palpa.fi/news/horeca/return-rates-of-palpa-s-deposit-packages-in-2016/?Nav=ajankohtaista&amp;type=Return+rates+of+Palpa%27s+deposit+packages+in+2016|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deposit values for these containers are as follows&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BOOK-Deposit-Global-24May2017-for-Website.pdf|title=Deposit Systems for One-Way Beverage Containers: Global Overview (2016)|last=Reloop Platform &amp; CM Consulting|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

The scheme is, in technical sense, voluntary and Palpa does not hold a legal monopoly for container deposits systems. However, it is the only such system in operation. Those beverage containers that do not belong to a container deposit system are levied an excise tax of €0.51/L, regardless of the container size.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2004/20041037 Laki eräiden juomapakkausten valmisteverosta (1037/2004)].

===Germany===
[[Image:Aldi-Pfandrückgabeautomat.JPG|thumb|[[Reverse vending machine]] in an [[Aldi]] supermarket in Germany.]]
In [[Germany]] container deposit legislation, known as ''Einwegpfand'' (single-use deposit), was passed in 2002, and was implemented on 1 January 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccr-clearing.de/en/about-deposit-clearing|title=About deposit clearing: The German deposit system|last=|first=|date=|website=CCR Clearing Reverse Logistics Group|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its implementation was fought by [[lobby group]]s of German bottling industry and [[retailer]]s. This fight also included [[Trial (law)|trials]] at the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany]] and the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]], but all trials were won by the German federal government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rk20021227_1bvr235102a.html "Ruling of the Constitutional Court of Germany"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928194845/http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rk20021227_1bvr235102a.html |date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deposit legislation covers plastic, aluminum, and glass containers for water, beer, mixed drinks containing beer, carbonated/non-carbonated soft drinks, and mixed alcoholic drinks. Excluded from the program are containers for fruit and vegetable juice, milk products, wine, spirits, liquors, and certain dietary drinks. Also excluded are containers smaller than 100mL and larger than 3L. At any given time, an estimated 2&amp;nbsp;billion [[beer bottle]]s are in circulation in Germany, each of which sees an average of 36 reuses.&lt;ref name=DieWelt&gt;{{cite news |last=Gassmann |first=Michael |date=April 9, 2014 |title=Der Wahnsinn, wenn Sie in München Flens trinken |url=https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article126732784/Der-Wahnsinn-wenn-Sie-in-Muenchen-Flens-trinken.html |newspaper=[[Die Welt]] |language=de |trans-title=The Madness of drinking Flens in Munich |access-date=October 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2016, the standard deposit for all single-use containers (cans, single-use glass and plastic bottles) 0.1L-3L in volume is [[Euro|€]]0.25. Retailers are only obliged to take back the material fractions that they sell. 

The deposit for refillable bottles is not defined by law. The usual rates are locally €0.02 for some wine bottles, €0.08 for beer bottles up to 0.5&amp;nbsp;L, and €0.15 for beer bottles with [[flip-top]] closures, beer bottles over 0.5&amp;nbsp;L and other bottles (mostly water and soft-drinks, lesser fruit drinks, milk, cream, yoghurt). Some bottles have an even higher deposit. [[Bottle crate]]s have a deposit of €1.50. Shops only accept bottles of sold vendors and sizes.
[[File:German plastic bottle with sign .jpg|thumb|German bottle with sign ]]
Germany's collection system is 80% automated and 20% manual. Most supermarkets in Germany have a [[reverse vending machine]] that is designed to be used by customers and which scans "Pfand" returns and prints a receipt for the total value of the refund which can be exchanged for cash or put towards the cost of future purchases. 

Supermarkets near the Danish border have established a scheme, where Scandinavian residents are exempt from "Pfand", by signing an "Export declaration" and providing that cans are exported within 24 hours and the contents are not consumed within Germany.

===Hungary===
In [[Hungary]], [[beer]], [[wine]] and standardized [[liquor]] bottles carry a deposit on them, which was liberalized in the recent past. Beer bottles have 25&amp;nbsp;[[Hungarian Forint|forints]] on them, but for wine glasses and for liquor bottles, the sum is decided by the trader, which people can exploit by buying a drink in a certain retailer and bringing the bottle back to its rival who have a bigger deposit on it. PET bottles and metal beverage containers are taken back only by some super- and [[hypermarkets]], such as [[Lidl]], [[Auchan]], [[Tesco]], [[Spar (retailer)|Interspar]]. They all use [[reverse vending machine]]s to collect them: for bottles and in most places for the PET bottles they use a Wincor-Nixdorf or a Tomra machine, while [[beverage can|ALU cans]] are collected by the Hungarian ALU-press machine. Its advantage is that it accepts flattened or pressed cans as well, and it crushes them with a pressing machine, thus improving the storage capacity of the machine. The containers' prices - 2&amp;nbsp;forints/ALU can and 1&amp;nbsp;forint/PET bottle - do not widely motivate people to revend these containers.

===Iceland===
[[Iceland]] has had a deposit system on a national scale for a wide range of containers (plastic, aluminum, and glass) since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://endurvinnslan.is/english/|title=Endurvinnslan - English|author=Nethönnun ehf.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All ready-to-drink beverages, wine, and liquor are included in the program. Milk, milk products, and juice extracts are excluded. The deposit is the same for all bottles and cans, [[Icelandic Krona|ISK]] 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endurvinnslan.is/english/|title=Deposit System|last=Endurvinnslan hf. (Recycling Ltd)|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The recycling rate per product is approximately 90% aluminum, 87% PET, and 83% glass.

===Israel===
In Israel, there is a 0.30-[[Israeli new shekel|shekel&amp;nbsp;(₪)]] deposit on beverage containers over 100ml and under 5L, except for dairy products. The system is operated by the ELA Recycling Corporation, a private non-profit organization owned by Israel's beverage manufacturers. Businesses are required to accept bottles if they sold them, or if they are over 28 square meters and sell beverages from the same manufacturer or importer. Businesses are not required to accept more than 50 bottles per customer per day. The deposit was initially ₪0.25, but was raised shortly after the ₪0.05 coin was discontinued.

In 2015, the system achieved a total return rate of 77%.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Most 500&amp;nbsp;mL beer bottles (local brands such as Goldstar and Maccabee plus certain imported ones like Carlsberg and Tuborg) have a deposit of ₪1.20, and are willingly accepted even by smaller businesses (plastic water bottles, glass wine bottles and soda cans are mostly accepted by larger supermarket chains, some of which possess [[reverse vending machines]]).

===Japan===
The container deposit legislation, as a monetary approach to the garbage/recycling problem, has never caught on in [[Japan]]. However, under increasingly ever stricter sorting rules announced by each town or city, garbage is meticuously sorted into kitchen garbage, newspapers/books, metal cans (washed)/plastic bottles (rinsed), garden weeds, etc. in each neighborhood for pickkup by collection cars, usually on different days notified by the local government. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jpninfo.com/9826|title=A Guide to Trash and Garbage Disposal in Japan – Japan Info|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Lithuania===

Lithuania implemented container deposit legislation for single-use cans and bottles in February 2016. Lithuania's program is comprehensive and charges a deposit on nearly all types of beverage containers, including those made of plastic, metal, and glass 0.1L to 3L. The deposit is applicable to beer and beer cocktails; cider and other fermented beverages; mixed alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages; all types of water; juice and nectars (sold in glass, plastic, and metal packaging); and fruit wines and wine-product cocktails sold in plastic and metal packaging. Milk, wine, and spirits are exempt. The deposit is the same for all containers and is €0.10 per bottle/can, and most collection is done using reverse vending machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grazintiverta.lt/en/for-business/about-the-system/#|title=Deposit|last=Užstato Sistemos Administratorius|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lithuania's deposit return system is operated by Užstato Sistemos Administratorius (USAD). Container return rates for plastic bottles were 34% before the deposit scheme, 74.3% at end of 2016, 91.9% at end of 2017, and 93% in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/recycling-lithuania-deposit-system-exceeds-all-expectations/45003/|title=Recycling: Lithuania deposit system exceeds all expectations|website=Open Access Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.foodbev.com/news/vending-in-reverse-the-industry-is-leading-on-returnable-plastics/|title=Vending in reverse: the industry is leading on returnable plastics|website=Foodbev Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
{{See also|Recycling in the Netherlands}}
Under the current deposit-return scheme, large [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET) bottles greater than 0.5L are subject to a [[Euro|€]]0.25 deposit, but only those for soft drinks and water. All other beverage types, such as medical drinks, wine, spirits, etc., are excluded. The system, which is operated by Stichting Retourverpakkingen NL, is mostly automated collection (89%) with only 11% of returns being done manually.  Beer bottles carry a €0.10 deposit, and beer crates €1.50.

In 2014, the Netherlands' deposit system recovered 95% of the containers covered by the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BOOK-Deposit-Global-24May2017-for-Website.pdf|title=Deposit Systems for One-Way Beverage Containers: Global Overview (2016)|last=Reloop Platform &amp; CM Consulting|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
[[New Zealand]] had no container-deposit legislation until 2008 when the [[Waste Minimisation Act 2008]] passed into law. The Act has provision for [[product stewardship]] of which container-deposit legislation is the most familiar type. {{As of|2010}} there is no widespread deposits available on containers with some beer bottles being a notable exception.

===Norway===
[[Image:Container deposit machine.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Tomra]] reverse vending machine in [[Hammerfest]], Norway]]
Automated recycling of bottles has been in use since the 1970s. Aluminum and steel beverage cans had a 5,60 kr surtax in [[Norway]] up until the end of the 20th century. In 1999, a container deposit legislation was passed, which also abolished this regulation. Today, these are the following container deposits in Norway:
* Cans, glass and plastic bottles up to 0.5&amp;nbsp;L: 2.00&amp;nbsp;[[Norwegian krone|krone]]
* Cans, glass and plastic bottles over 0.5&amp;nbsp;L: 3&amp;nbsp;kr
* Bottle crates are also reverse vended.

In 2018 the rates were increased to 2 NOK (formerly 1 NOK) and 3 NOK (previously 2.50 NOK) due to inflation and the discontinuation of the 50-øre coin.

[http://infinitum.no Infinitum AS] (formerly Norsk Resirk A/S) is responsible for operating the national recycling scheme for non-refillable plastic bottles and beverage cans in Norway. The non-profit corporation was founded in 1999 and is owned by companies and organizations in the beverage industry and food trading. 

The Norwegian system works in such a way that the excise tax decreases as the returns increases, meaning that for example that 90 per cent returns for cans translates into a 90 per cent discount on the excise tax. This again allows drink products to be sold at lower prices.

In 2014, 95.4% of PET bottles and 96.6% of all drink cans in Norway were returned under the scheme. 

Deposits on drink containers have a long history in Norway, starting with deposits on beer bottles in 1902. The deposit back then was 0.06 kr (3.30 kr in 2006 currency value).
This deposit arrangement was later expanded to include soft drink bottles.

Up until 1 January 2001, the [[Vinmonopolet]] government wine and spirits monopoly chain had deposits on products made by the company itself, this did not include imported products.

All sellers of deposit marked drinking containers are required by law to accept returns of empty containers for cash. As of 2016, drink containers can be returned and deposits retrieved at over 15,000 establishments in Norway. The collection system is 95% automated (using reverse vending machines) and only 5% manual. Most reverse vending machines in Norway are manufactured by [[Tomra|Tomra Systems ASA]].

===Sweden===
[[Image:Pant 50 öre.jpg|thumb|200px|Deposit symbol of the old Swedish 50&amp;nbsp;öre 33-cl [[aluminium]] can.]]
In [[Sweden]], there are deposits on nearly all ready-to-serve beverages, including beer, soft drinks, cider, and bottled water. Dairy products, vegetable juice, fruit juice, and berry drinks are excluded from the program. The deposit values are as follows: 
* Metal: [[Swedish Krona|SEK]] 1
* Plastic &lt; 1l: SEK 1
* Plastic &gt; 1l: SEK 2
* Glass 33 cl: SEK 0,60, an empty red bottle crate for 20 bottles have a SEK 22,40 deposit. 
* Glass 50 cl: SEK 0,90, an empty blue bottle crate for 15 bottles have a SEK 28,00 deposit. 
AB Svenska Returpack ([http://pantamera.nu/om-oss/returpack-in-english/ Pantamera]) is responsible for the deposit system for aluminium cans and PET bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fakta om Returpack |publisher=AB Svenska Returpack |url=http://www.returpack.se/flash.php?pageId=106 |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830063036/http://www.returpack.se/flash.php?pageId=106 |archivedate=2009-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aluminum cans have had a deposit since 1984, and PET bottles since 1994.

Until 1998, the hard alcohol and wine bottles sold at [[Systembolaget]] — the government owned alcohol retail monopoly — had a deposit as well, but due to the deregulation of the Systembolaget's suppliers, the former sole supplier [[V&amp;S Group]] dropped the deposit on their bottles due to the restricted bottle shapes giving V&amp;S a disadvantage compared to the competitors. The bottles could be returned and deposit refunded until early 1999 at Systembolaget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sista chansen att panta vin- och spritflaskor|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/telegram/0,1082,1269668_INR_p_,00.html|date=1999-02-21|accessdate=2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation regarding container deposit systems was updated so that from January 1, 2006, containers from other plastics and metals, e.g., steel cans, can be included in the deposit systems.&lt;ref name="sr-steelcans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.returpack.se/download/pdf/bakgrundsfakta.pdf|title=Fakta om Returpack|publisher=AB Svenska Returpack|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919154813/http://www.returpack.se/download/pdf/bakgrundsfakta.pdf|archivedate=September 19, 2007|accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Svensk författningssamling SFS 2005:220 |publisher=[[Parliament of Sweden]] |url=http://62.95.69.3/SFSdoc/05/050220.PDF |date=2005-04-14 |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011824/http://62.95.69.3/SFSdoc/05/050220.PDF |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law also makes it illegal in Sweden to sell consumption-ready beverages in containers that are not part of an authorized Swedish container deposit system, with the exception of beverages that mainly consist of dairy products or vegetable, fruit, or berry juice. However, private importation from (mainly Eastern European) countries without deposit occurs by vendors that thus compete with a somewhat lower customer price. The recycling of these contraband cans has not been seen as a problem, but Returpack made a campaign in 2010 offering 0.10 [[Swedish krona|krona]] for each imported can (without deposit) to the benefit of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], retrieving 17 million cans. In 2011, a similar campaign was repeated, retrieving almost 18 million cans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.returpack.se|title=Välkommen till Pantamera|work=Pantamera}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Non-deposit glass containers are collected in large glass garbage bins, for clear or coloured glass, placed centrally in most urban areas.

The 1.5&amp;nbsp;L refillable PET bottle with a deposit of 4.00&amp;nbsp;kr has been discontinued, and has been replaced by the 1.5&amp;nbsp;L non-refillable PET bottle. The last day for returning bottles made by [[Spendrups]] for deposit was 30 June 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Viktig information angående 4:- pant för hårda retur-PET flaskor Sverige |publisher=Sveriges Bryggerier |date=July 2007 |url=http://www.sverigesbryggerier.se/pressrum/enskilda-nyheter-2007/0707-pressmed%20pant%20for%20harda%20retur-pet.pdf |format=PDF |language=Swedish |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320014134/http://www.sverigesbryggerier.se/pressrum/enskilda-nyheter-2007/0707-pressmed%20pant%20for%20harda%20retur-pet.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the last day for bottles made by [[Coca-Cola]] Sweden was 30 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pant upphör 30 juni 2008 |publisher=Sveriges Bryggerier |url=http://www.sverigesbryggerier.se/emballage/pant%204%20kr.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423223055/http://www.sverigesbryggerier.se/emballage/pant%204%20kr.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2008-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Sweden is one of the leading countries in recycling of beverage containters, Returpack uses TV commercials to promote more recycling. Commercials have been made with well-known melodies sung, like "[[Guantanamera]]" and "Pata pata"—sounding like Returpack's slogan "panta mera" (i.e., "recycle more").

In 2016, the overal recycling rate was 84.9% for both aluminum cans and PET bottles, which translates to 177 packages per person in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pantamera.nu/om-oss/returpack-in-english/about-returpack/|title=About Returpack|last=Pantamera|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
In [[Switzerland]], there is a government ruling that 75% of containers must be returned, otherwise a deposit system may be introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/814_621/index.html|title=SR 814.621 Verordnung vom 5. Juli 2000 über Getränkeverpackungen (VGV)|author=Bundeskanzlei - P|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
Until the turn of the 21st century, most British bottled beer was sold (whether in off-licences or pubs) in standard quart, pint, half-pint or third-pint (nip) [[beer bottle|bottles]], although some brewers preferred their own distinctive designs. The standard deposit was 7[[Penny (British decimal coin)|pence (p)]] for a pint bottle and 5p for a half-pint. However, in the absence of legislation, and given the switch from pub to supermarket sales, and from Imperial to metric measures, the industry has now entirely abandoned refillable bottles.

Beer casks sold for the home or party consumption of draught beer are usually also loaned out against a deposit which may run to several tens of pounds.

====England ====

In England, in January 2017, ministers were reported to be considering a 10p or 20p refundable deposit on plastic bottles and containers after Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas had voiced her support of such a scheme at the end of 2016. As of February 2017, the idea of a plastic bottle levy was unlikely as the government rejected the deposit scheme proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ciwm-journal.co.uk/deposit-return-scheme-plastic-bottles-unlikely/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, the UK government announced plans to introduce a deposit return scheme in England for drinks containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-43563164|title=Drinks bottles and can deposit return scheme proposed|work=BBC News|date=28 March 2018|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Ireland ====

As of June 2015, Northern Ireland had been considering a drinks deposit scheme, following the publication of a feasibility study for a deposit return scheme for drinks containers in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ciwm-journal.co.uk/northern-ireland-considers-drinks-deposit-scheme/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has yet to implement such a scheme.

==== Scotland ====

In Scotland, some Barr products in 750&amp;nbsp;mL glass bottles, had a 30p container deposit although this was discontinued in August 2015. Some Tesco stores have reverse vending machines which pay ½p per aluminium can (equivalent value in Tesco Clubcard Points). Furthermore, the landmark Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 passed by the Scottish Parliament contains within it powers for Scottish ministers to implement a national scheme.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2009/12/part/5/crossheading/deposit-and-return{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2017, a Holyrood motion supporting the idea of a small deposit on all drinks containers was signed by 66 MSPs, including member from every party. In May 2015, the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland (APRS) published Scottish polling which revealed overwhelming support for deposit-return. The figures showed that 78.8% of those who expressed a view supported this approach for Scotland, while just 8.5% opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haveyougotthebottle.org.uk/campaign-news/new-campaign-launched-deposit-return-system-scotland/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several companies, most notably large drinks corporations like Coca-Cola, are known to have lobbied against the introduction of a national deposit scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theferret.scot/industry-battle-block-drinks-deposit/|title=Industry’s battle to block drinks deposit scheme|date=3 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/15/plastic-bottle-tax-unlikely-government-rejects-deposit-scheme/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaked documents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4157956/Coca-Cola-plot-kill-bottle-deposits.html|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; reveal that in Europe, Coca Cola had identified deposit programs as a threat and they were planning to fight back. But in February 2017, the drinks company unexpectedly announced its support for a deposit-return program in Scotland, and in a statement to the Independent, Coca-Cola UK stated: "We have embarked on a major review of our sustainable packaging strategy to understand what role we can play in unlocking the full potential of a circular economy in Great Britain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/coca-cola-recycling-scotland-scottish-drinks-bottle-return-scheme-u-turn-a7592971.html|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 5, 2017, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that a deposit-system would be implemented as a means to tackle the rising tide of waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/nicola-sturgeon-announces-can-and-bottle-deposit-return-scheme-1-4551671|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No date has been set for implementation at this time. In the days of refillable milk bottles, such bottles were deposit-free.

As of March 2018, Welsh ministers are working on a plan to introduce a deposit return scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-43567768|title=Bottle deposit scheme: Welsh ministers 'already working' on plan|date=28 March 2018|accessdate=28 March 2018|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main article|Container deposit legislation in the United States}}
The [[United States]] container-deposit laws are popularly called "bottle bills" after the [[Oregon Bottle Bill]], which was the first U.S. state to pass container deposit legislation in 1971.

Efforts to pass container deposit legislation in the 39 states that do not have them are often politically contentious.  The U.S. beverage container industry—including both the bottlers of water, soda, [[beer]], and the [[Corporation|corporate]] owners of grocery stores and convenience stores—often spends large amounts of money lobbying against the introduction of both new and amended beverage container deposit legislation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Because of this, a new bottle bill has not been passed since 2005, and Delaware repealed its law in 2010 in favour of a non-refundable USD $0.04 tax per beverage container sold (Universal Recycling Law).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bottlebill.org/news/articles/2010/DE-5-17-DEReplacesBottleDeposits.htm|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delaware's bottle bill was introduced in 1982 and had charged a $0.05 deposit on all beverage container (except aluminum) under 2 quarts. 

There are currently 10 states that have container deposit laws: 
* California: Enacted in 1981 and operated by CalRecycle, California's bottle bill charges a USD$0.05 refundable deposit on containers less than 24 fl. oz, and USD$0.10 for containers 24 fl. oz or greater.  The deposit is applicable to plastic, aluminum, bimetal, and glass containers, including beer, malt, wine and distilled spirits, and all non-alcoholic beverages. Milk, 100% fruit juice ≥46 oz., vegetable juice ≥16 oz, and refillables are excluded. The total return rate in 2015 was 81%.
* Connecticut: Connecticut's bottle bill was introduced in 1980, but was expanded in 2009 to include bottled water. The program now includes beer, malt, carbonated soft drinks, and noncarbonated beverages in plastic, metal, or glass containers &lt;3L. Juices and HDPE containers are exempt from the deposit. The deposit is the same for all container types and is USD$0.05. In 2015, the total return rate was 50% (does not include 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; quarter). Before water bottles were added to the deposit system, redemption rates were higher (65-70% range). 
* Hawaii: Hawaii's bottle bill has been in place since 2005 and is government-operated. A refundable deposit of USD$0.05 is charged on all plastic (PET, HDPE), metal, bi-metal, and glass beverage containers 2L or less, except for milk and dairy products. In 2015, the system achieved a total return rate of 68%
* Iowa: Introduced in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Evan (June 9, 1985). "Handling Called Messy: Iowa Cleaner; Bottle Law Praised". ''Omaha World-Herald'' (Omaha, Nebraska).&lt;/ref&gt; Iowa's bottle bill covers beer, carbonated soft drinks, mineral water, wine coolers, wine and liquor. All types of containers are accepted, including sealed glass, plastic, or metal bottles, can, jars or cartons. Fruit and vegetable juices, fruit drinks, and milk and milk products are exempt. The deposit is uniform across beverage categories and is currently USD$0.05. It is estimated that the return rate is around 86%.
* Maine: Established in 1978 after a [[ballot initiative]],&lt;ref&gt;Merry, George B. (January 27, 1981). "New 'bottle bills' face crucial test in months ahead". ''The Christian Science Monitor''. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Maine's bottle bill charges a USD$0.05 deposit on plastic, metal, and glass containers and USD$0.015 for most liquor and wine bottles. All beverages in containers 4L or less are included, with the exception of dairy products and unprocessed cider. According to testimony provided by a beverage industry lobbyist to the state, the 2015 return rate was 90%. 
* Massachusetts: The state's bottle bill was effective as of January 17, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Merry, George B. (November 18, 1981). "Bay State places 'nickel-and-dime' bounty on all beverage containers". ''The Christian Science Monitor''. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It applies to beer, malt, carbonated soft drinks, and mineral water in plastic, metal, bimetal, or glass containers (or any combination of those materials). The deposit levied is USD$0.05. In 2015, 57% of beverage containers covered by the bottle bill were returned for a refund of the deposit.
* Michigan: Implemented in 1978, Michigan's bottle bill charges a USD$0.10 deposit on plastic, metal, glass, and paper containers less than 1 gallon. The types of beverages included in the bill include beer/ale, soft drinks, carbonated and mineral water, wine coolers, canned cocktails, and malt drinks. Milk, juice, tea, sport drinks, and foil pouches are excluded.  In 2014, the total return rate was 94%.
* New York: New York's bottle bill has been in place since January 12, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;"New York stores carry the (empty) can". ''Financial Times'' (London, England). September 17, 1983. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; New York charges a USD$0.05 deposit on plastic, metal, and glass containers 3.78L or less. The deposit is applicable to carbonated soft drinks, soda water, energy drinks, juices (anything &lt;100% juice), beer and other malt beverages, mineral water, wine products, water that does not contain sugar, including flavored or nutritionally enhanced water. Excluded from the program are milk products, wine and liquors, tea, sports drinks, juice that is not 100%, drink boxes, and water containing sugar. In 2015, the system achieved a return rate of 65%. 
* Oregon: Oregon's bottle bill, introduced in 1972, is the oldest in the U.S. It covers plastic, metal, and glass beverage containers containing water/flavoured water, beer/malt, soda water, mineral water, teas, juice, and carbonated soft drinks 3L or less. Wine and liquor, as well as milk and milk substitutes are excluded from the program. Up until April 2017, the deposit has been USD$0.05 per container. It is now $0.10 per container. In 2014, Oregon's bottle bill had a 68% return rate. This is expected to increase as a result of the increase in the deposit level. 
* Vermont: Implemented in 1973, Vermont's bottle bill charges a USD$0.05 deposit on plastic, metal, and glass beer, wine coolers and other malt beverages, soft drinks and other carbonated beverage containers. Most liquor and spirits bottles are charged a deposit of USD$0.15. Wine and hard cider, water, milk, juices, sports drinks, and other non-carbonated beverages are excluded from the bottle deposit law. In 2012-2013, the system achieved a return rate of 75%. 

States that formerly have can deposit regulation:
* [[Delaware]] (5¢), introduced 1982, abolished 2009, replaced by Universal Recycling law.

The '''denomination effect''' is a form of [[cognitive bias]] relating to [[currency]], suggesting people may be less likely to spend larger currency denominations than their equivalent value in smaller denominations.&lt;ref name="Business Insider - Kane"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kane|first1=Libby|title=15 cognitive biases that could keep you from building wealth|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/cognitive-biases-affect-wealth-2016-9/#anchoring-bias-3|accessdate=25 January 2017|publisher=Business Insider|date=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed by Priya Raghubir, professor at the [[New York University Stern School of Business]], and Joydeep Srivastava, professor at [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], in their 2009 paper "Denomination Effect".&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why We Spend Coins Faster Than Bills|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104063298|accessdate=24 January 2017|publisher=NPR|date=May 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=701}}

Raghubir and Srivastava conducted three studies in their research on the denomination effect; their findings suggested people may be more likely to spend money represented by smaller denominations and that consumers may prefer to receive money in a large denomination when there is a need to control spending. The denomination effect can occur when large denominations are perceived as less exchangeable than smaller denominations.

The effect's influence on spending decisions has implications throughout various sectors in society, including [[Welfare economics|consumer welfare]], [[monetary policy]] and the [[Financial services|finance industry]]. For example, during the [[Great Recession]], one businessman observed employees using more coins rather than banknotes in an office vending machine, perceiving the customers used coins to feel thriftier. Raghubir and Srivastava also suggested the effect may involve incentives to alter future behavior and that a large denomination can serve as a mechanism to prevent the urge to spend.

==Raghubir and Srivastava experiment==
[[File:Exchange Money Conversion to Foreign Currency.jpg|thumb|The denomination effect influences spending decisions.]]
Raghubir and Srivastava conducted three distinct studies as part of their experiment. Their first experiment involved 89 [[undergraduate]] students from two United States universities. As a cover story, the students were thanked for their participation and randomly given  either a small [[Denomination (currency)|denomination]] (four quarters) or a large denomination ($1 bill) and told they could keep or spend the money on confectionery. Small denominations were given to 43 students (48% of study group) and 46 students (52% of study group) were given large denominations. Approximately 44% (39/89) of the participants, in both conditions, chose to purchase confectionery. About 63% of the participants with the four quarters purchased candy, yet only 26% of the participants with the $1 bill spent money, suggesting the students were more inclined to spend when given a smaller denomination.{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=701}}

In a second study, 75 gas-station customers were each asked to participate in a short survey on gas usage. Each participant was given $5 as either five $1 bills, five $1 coins or one $5 bill and told they could spend the money at the gas station store. Customers who were given five $1 bills were more likely to buy something compared to customers receiving a single $5 bill. Customers who received five $1 coins had the lowest likelihood of spending, however the currency is in low-circulation and some are retained as [[souvenir]]s.{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=705}}

A third study sought to understand whether the effect was particular to American culture. In China, 150 housewives were given an envelope of money in exchange for completing a survey, containing either a single [[Renminbi]] (CNY) 100 banknote or five banknotes of equivalent value (in 2009, CNY 100 was equivalent to roughly $14.63 [[USD]] or €10.40 [[EUR]]&lt;ref name="currency_conv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.x-rates.com/average/?from=CNY&amp;to=USD&amp;amount=1&amp;year=2009 |title=Historic exchange rate: CNY to USB as of 2009 |publisher=X-Rates |access-date=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The cash represented a significant amount of money based on the monthly income of the participants, as 18.7% (28/150) earned less than CNY 300, 65% earned (97/150) between CNY 301 and 600 and 16.7% (25/150) earned over CNY 600. The average household size was about 3.3 people in both conditions. Some who purchased household items were less satisfied if they had received a large banknote, compared to the others who felt more satisfied spending smaller denominations.{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=704-706}}

==Early studies==
[[File:Credit-cards.jpg|thumb|Alternate payment methods]]
One study, conducted by marketing professors Arul Mishra, Himanshu Mishra and Dhananjay Nayakankuppam in 2006, documented a phenomenon whereby consumers spent less of a large denomination, but not with smaller denominations.&lt;ref name="Advances in Consumer Research"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mishra|first1=Arul|last2=Mishra|first2=Himanshu|last3=Nayakankuppam|first3=Dhananjay|title=Money: a Bias For the Whole|journal=Advances in Consumer Research|volume=34|page=166|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v34/500822_100201_v1.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study, they concluded that people give higher value to a large single denomination because it is more difficult to process the transaction, leading people to overvalue it and make them less likely to spend compared to an identical amount in smaller denominations. Unlike Mishra et al., who studied purchase intentions, Raghubir and Srivastava examined actual purchase decisions.{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=701,702,704,706}}

Previous research by Raghubir and Srivastava in 2008 found a higher inclination to spend using alternative payment methods, such as a credit or gift cards.{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=701,712}} Their experiment built on earlier research studies, including one by [[Harvard]] business professor [[John Gourville]] in 1998,{{sfn|Gourville|1998|p=395-498}} which showed that people are more likely to analyze a transaction positively when the same amount of money is presented as an equally distributed sum each day instead of a single lump sum each year.{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=701}}

==Conclusions==
Raghubir and Srivastava concluded in study 1 that people are more likely to spend when an equivalent amount of money is represented by a smaller denomination relative to a single large denomination. In study 2, they concluded that consumers prefer to receive money in a large denomination compared to small denominations when there is a need to control spending. Study 3 further proves that the denomination effect depends on an individual's desire to reduce the uneasy feeling associated with spending money. The denomination effect occurs because people perceive a large denomination as less replaceable than smaller denominations, which can be used to control and regulate spending.{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=701-713}}

In 2009, Sean Gregory with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine explained that consumers view large denominations as more valuable than smaller denominations and that they tend to isolate the cash in their minds. Each smaller denomination $20 bill, he noted, is a less valuable entity than the single large denomination $100 bill. It's easier to spend five $20 bills than it is to spend a single $100 bill. Gregory also added that consumers fear breaking a single large denomination because they won't be able to stop spending the change.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gregory|first1=Sean|title=Want to Save Money? Carry Around $100 Bills|url=http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1887485,00.html|accessdate=24 January 2017|publisher=Time|date=March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers suggested that the denomination effect may involve imposing self-constraints or [[incentive]]s to alter future behavior, noting a large denomination can serve as a [[precommitment]] mechanism to prevent the urge to spend compared to small denominations.{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=702-704}}

==Applications==
Raghubir and Srivastava believe the influence of denomination on spending decisions has implications on consumer welfare and [[monetary policy]].{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=712}} Raghubir suggested offering smaller denominations to encourage spending and proposed increasing circulation of $1 coins and introduce $2 coins in the United States.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

[[File:Stockmarket.jpg|thumb|The denomination effect has implications in buying and selling stocks.]]
In 2012, Gary Belsky and Tom Gilovich of ''Time'' magazine stated that Raghubir and Srivastava's results were consistent with what they called ''mental accounting'', suggesting small denomination banknotes tend to get assigned to a "mental petty cash account" to spend on trivial things. In contrast, larger denomination banknotes are perceived as "real money" and likely to spend on things of greater importance.&lt;ref name="Time - Bill size"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilovich|first1=Tom|last2=Belsky|first2=Gary|title=Why (Bill) Size Really Does Matter|url=http://business.time.com/2012/01/26/why-bill-size-really-does-matter/|accessdate=25 January 2017|publisher=Time|date=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economic Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riju|first1=Dave|title=Going shopping? Don't fall for these 14 retailer tricks to make you spend more|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/spend/going-shopping-dont-fall-for-these-14-retailer-tricks-to-make-you-spend-more/articleshow/54377119.cms|accessdate=25 January 2017|publisher=Economic Times|date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 [[National Public Radio]] report noted that as the [[recession]] worsened, a [[Sacramento]] businessman noticed that people were using more coins, rather than banknotes, in his office [[vending machine]]. The businessman believed the consumers were feeling economic hardship and that using coins instead of banknotes made them feel thriftier.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

John Manning, columnist at the ''International Banker'', noted the effect surfaces in the finance field, when an asset's unit of value exposes an investor's tendency to spend less when given in larger amounts. Manning cited the example of a [[stock split]], suggesting the number of shares is increased by a certain ratio and diminished in price by the same factor, so that the company's total [[equity value]] remains the same. Stock splits are done largely because of the denomination effect, as the belief is that a less expensive share price can increase stock demand.&lt;ref name="International Banker"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Manning|first1=John|title=Cognitive Bias Series: 6.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12032">'''Djwal Khul''' (variously spelled 'Djwhal Khul', 'Djwal Kul', the 'Master D.K.', 'D.K.', or simply 'DK'), is believed by some [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] and others to be a [[Tibet]]an disciple in the tradition of ancient [[esoteric]] spirituality known as The Ageless Wisdom tradition. The texts describe him as a member of the '[[Spiritual Hierarchy]]', or 'Brotherhood', of [[Mahatma]]s, one of the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]], defined as the spiritual guides of mankind and teachers ancient [[cosmological]], [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], and esoteric principles that form the origin of all the world's great philosophies, mythologies and spiritual traditions.&lt;ref name="neff"&gt;{{cite book|last= Neff |first=Mary K. |title= Brothers of Madame Blavatsky |pages= 31, 46–47|year=2003 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn= 0766157822}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Theosophical writings, Djwal Khul is said to work on furthering the spiritual evolution of our planet through the teachings offered in the 24 books by [[Alice Bailey]] of Esoteric Teachings published by The Lucis Trust; he is said to have telepathically transmitted the teachings to Bailey and is thus regarded by her followers as the [[communications director]] of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom.

==In Theosophy and the writings of Alice Bailey==
{{Theosophy}}

Djwal Khul's name first appeared in the work of [[Madame Blavatsky]], a co-founder of the [[Theosophical Society]] and author of "[[The Secret Doctrine]]", published in 1888, which was primarily written by Koot Hoomi and Morya, according to Blavatsky and others in the Mahatma letters.&lt;ref&gt;The Writing of The Secret Doctrine - By Kirby Van Mater - www.theosociety.org/pasadena/invit-sd/invsd-4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letters from the Masters of the Wisdom, No. 19, 1:47, 5th ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey writes in August 1934, in the first person voice of DK: [I am] "a Tibetan disciple of a certain degree, and this tells you but little, for all are disciples from the humblest aspirant up to and beyond The Christ Himself. I live in a physical body like other men on the borders of Tibet and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over a large group of Tibetan Lamas, when my other duties permit."&lt;ref name="bailey"&gt;{{cite book|last= Bailey |first= Alice. A |title= Discipleship in The New Age vol.1|pages= vii|year=1944|publisher=Lucis Trust }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some writings, his name was omitted and he was referred to by the abbreviation "Master D. K." or the appellation "The Tibetan".&lt;ref name="neff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guenon"&gt;{{cite book|last= Guenon |first= Rene |translator=Alvin Moore, Jr. |translator2=Cecil Bethell|title= Theosophy: History of a Pseudo-Religion|pages= 41–42|year=2004 |publisher=Sophia Perennis |isbn= 0900588802}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackay,  Alex, ''The History of Tibet.'' Routledge University Press, 2003, p. 714&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Esoteric Healing,'' Lucis Trust. 1951. p 714&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 [[Alice Bailey]] (1880–1949), severed her links with the Theosophical Society for various reasons and later began writing books she described as being [[telepathy|telepathically]] dictated to her by Djwhal Khul whom she referred to as "The Tibetan"&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Unfinished Autobiography''. Lucis Trust. 1951. pp 162-163&lt;/ref&gt; (later associated with the initials ''D.K.'').  According to Bailey, her D.K. was the main author behind Blavatsky's "The Secret Doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation Human and Solar,'' Lucis Trust., p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Esoteric Healing'', Lucis Trust., p. 521, 536, og 565&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Rays and Initiations,'' Lucis Trust., p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy,'' Lucis Trust., p. 685&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey stated that after initial resistance, she was eventually persuaded by the quality of what she had written in 'dictation' in the first few weeks work with DK to continue to write down the communications from this source.  She wrote for 30 years, from 1919 to 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Unfinished Autobiography''. Lucis Trust. 1951. From the Preface by Foster Bailey, p 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey wrote that Djwal Khul's intention was the revelation of [[esoteric]] teachings that were valuable for the continued training and teaching of spiritual aspirants in the 20th and early 21st century. She believed her work was done on behalf of the "spiritual hierarchy" of advanced beings, that included Djwal Khul, whose sole interest was to guide humanity towards the establishing of goodwill and right human relations, the vital first steps that would help prepare the way for the "Reappearance of the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Christ]]" (called by Theosophists ''The [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]]''). Alice Bailey's 24 books with DK were to be the second in a series of three revelations, after Blavatsky's "The Secret Doctrine", that were meant present the preparatory teachings that would serve to usher in the [[New Age]] referred to as the ''[[Age of Aquarius]]'',  because the astrological sign of Aquarius will soon succeed this present Piscean cycle in the cycle of the [[astrological age]]s.

In a preface included in many of Bailey's books, Djwal Khul, in the dictations described by Bailey, refers to the fact that he has been reported to be an abbot of a Tibetan monastery and the spiritual preceptor of a large group of [[lama]]s. She wrote that he lived in Northern India, near the borders of [[Tibet]]. Other than that the books do not include personal details about Djwal Khul and the dictated content focuses on his [[esoteric]] teachings.  Of the minimal personal details, Bailey writes that Djwhal Khul considers himself a disciple of a certain degree in the spiritual,  non-physical, [[ashram]] of the Master [[Koot Hoomi]], who is considered by Theosophists and other students of Alice Bailey's books to be another member of the same "spiritual hierarchy" of advanced beings.

[[C. W. Leadbeater]] claimed that he saw Djwal Khul [[Teleportation in theology|teleport]] into a room in which he and Madame Blavatsky were sitting.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 Theosophical Publishing House Pages 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey's work and her books with Djwal Khul were published by the [[Lucis Trust]],  an organization she set up with her husband, [[Foster Bailey]]. Over time, Djwal Khul's name has appeared in the writings about [[Ascended Master]]s (a phrase not used or sanctioned by either The Tibetan or Mrs. Bailey) of various [[New Age]] organizations (of debatable credibility according to some{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}) such as the ''[[Ascended Master Teachings]]'' of [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], who claims that she has channeled Djwal Khul as well as the other Mahatmas, such as ''[[Koot Hoomi]]'' and ''the Master El [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]]'', among many others, resulting in dozens of volumes of transcriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Klimo |first= Jon|author2=Charles Tart |title= Channeling: Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources|year= 1998 |publisher=North Atlantic Books |isbn= 1556432488 |page= 54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of these groups described themselves as having direct contact with him and other "Masters of Wisdom", and to be working as their disciples on the physical plane. Within the Arcane School founded by Bailey, DK's works are studied along with other spiritual teachings of all ages. He is treated as a teacher and neither he nor his books have become objects of devotion.

==Previous incarnation==

According to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], one of Djwal Khul's previous incarnations was as Caspar, one of the [[Three Wise Men]] (the one who gave gold to [[Jesus]]).&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 - Summit University Press - Page 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function in the spiritual hierarchy==

It is believed by the followers of [[Benjamin Creme]] and the followers of the [[Alice Bailey]] teachings, that Djwal Khul coordinates the activities of the seven masters of the [[Seven Rays]] to advance the ''Plan of the Masters'' and functions as the [[communications director]] of the Ascended Masters since he is believed to have telepathically transmitted the teachings in the Alice A. Bailey material to Alice Bailey.

==Criticism==

The teachings of Djwal Khul, as conveyed through Bailey's many books in his name, contain and deal with many controversial topics, stating that there are widespread evils ingrained in popular ideas and statements about [[nationalism]], [[race relations]], [[American isolationism]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet totalitarianism]], [[fascism]], [[Nazism]], and [[Zionism]]. The books include content critical of the then current 19th century and early 20th century ideas and views about people of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] descent, [[Aboriginal Australians]], the [[Jewish people]] and [[Arabs]], and of [[Judaism]] and orthodox [[Christianity]] and fundamentalist movements of both East and West.

==Skeptical view==

The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.

The '''Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox''' ('''EPR paradox''') is a [[thought experiment]] proposed by physicists [[Albert Einstein]], [[Boris Podolsky]] and [[Nathan Rosen]] (EPR) that they interpreted as indicating that the explanation of physical reality provided by Quantum Mechanics was incomplete.&lt;ref name="EPR"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete? | date = 1935-05-15 | first = A | last = Einstein |author2=B Podolsky |author3=N Rosen  | journal = [[Physical Review]] | volume = 47 | issue = 10 | pages = 777–780 | url=http://www.drchinese.com/David/EPR.pdf |bibcode = 1935PhRv...47..777E |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.47.777 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1935 paper titled ''Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete?'', they attempted to mathematically show that the [[wave function]] does not contain complete information about physical reality, and hence the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is unsatisfactory; resolutions of the paradox have important implications for the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]].

The work was done at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton University in 1934, which Einstein [[Albert_Einstein#1933:_Emigration_to_the_US|had joined the prior year]] after he had fled Nazi Germany. 

[[File:Einstein.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Albert Einstein]]]] The essence of the paradox is that particles can interact in such a way that it is possible to measure both their position and their momentum more accurately than [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] allows, unless measuring one particle instantaneously affects the other to prevent this accuracy, which would involve information being transmitted faster than light as forbidden by the [[theory of relativity]] ("[[action at a distance (physics)|spooky action at a distance]]"). This consequence had not previously been noticed and seemed unreasonable at the time; the phenomenon involved is now known as [[quantum entanglement]].

== History of EPR developments ==
The article that first brought forth these matters, "Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?" was published in 1935.&lt;ref name="EPR"/&gt; The paper prompted a response by Bohr, which he published in the same journal, in the same year, using the same title.&lt;ref name='Bohr1935'&gt;{{cite journal |title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete? |date=1935-10-13 |first=N. |last=Bohr |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=696–702 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.696|bibcode=1935PhRv...48..696B |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/1060284/files/PhysRev.48.696.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There followed a debate between Bohr and Einstein about the fundamental nature of reality. Einstein had been skeptical of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the role of chance in quantum theory.  But the crux of this debate was not about chance, but something even deeper: Is there one objective physical reality, which every observer sees from his own vantage? (Einstein's view)  Or does the observer co-create physical reality by the questions he poses with experiments? (Bohr's view)

Einstein struggled to the end of his life for a theory that could better comply with his idea of [[Causality (physics)|causality]], protesting against the view that there exists no objective physical reality other than that which is revealed through measurement interpreted in terms of quantum mechanical formalism. However, since Einstein's death, experiments analogous to the one described in the EPR paper have been carried out, starting in 1976 by French scientists Lamehi-Rachti and Mittig&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dkaCKHKLo3gC&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330&amp;dq=%22Saclay%22+%22Bell%27s+inequality%22&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2 Advances in atomic and molecular physics, Volume 14 By David Robert Bates]&lt;/ref&gt;  at the [[Saclay Nuclear Research Centre]]. These experiments appear to show that the [[local realism]] idea is false,&lt;ref name='Gribbin'&gt;{{cite book |title=In Search of Schrödinger's Cat |publisher=Black Swan |year=1984 |first=J. |last=Gribbin |isbn=978-0-7045-3071-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; vindicating Bohr.

Per EPR, the paradox demonstrated that quantum theory was incomplete, and needed to be extended with [[hidden variable theory|hidden variables]]. One modern resolution is as follows: for two "entangled" particles created at once (e.g., an electron-positron pair from a photon), measurable properties have well-defined meaning only for the ensemble system. Properties of constituent subsystems (e.g., the individual electron or positron), considered individually, remain undefined. Therefore, if analogous measurements are performed on the two entangled subsystems, there will always be a correlation between the outcomes, and a well-defined global outcome for the ensemble. However, the outcomes for each subsystem, considered separately, at each repetition of the experiment, will not be well defined or predictable. This correlation does not imply that measurements performed on one particle influence measurements on the other. This modern resolution eliminates the need for hidden variables, action at a distance, or other schemes introduced over time, in order to explain the phenomenon.

According to quantum mechanics, under some conditions, a pair of quantum systems may be described by a single [[wave function]], which encodes the probabilities of the outcomes of experiments that may be performed on the two systems, whether jointly or individually. At the time the EPR article discussed below was written, it was known from experiments that the outcome of an experiment sometimes cannot be uniquely predicted. An example of such indeterminacy can be seen when a beam of light is incident on a [[half-silvered mirror]]. One half of the beam will reflect, and the other will pass. If the intensity of the beam is reduced until only one photon is in transit at any time, whether that photon will reflect or transmit cannot be predicted quantum mechanically.

The routine explanation of this effect was, at that time, provided by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Physical quantities come in pairs called [[conjugate quantities]]. Examples of such conjugate pairs are (Position, momentum), (Time, energy), and (Angular position, angular momentum). When one quantity was measured, and became determined, the conjugated quantity became indeterminate. Heisenberg explained this uncertainty as due to the quantization of the disturbance from measurement.

The EPR paper, written in 1935, was intended to illustrate that this explanation is inadequate. It considered two [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles, referred to as A and B, and pointed out that measuring a quantity of a particle A will cause the conjugated quantity of particle B to become undetermined, even if there was no contact, no classical disturbance. The basic idea was that the quantum states of two particles in a system cannot always be decomposed from the joint state of the two, as is the case for the [[Bell state]], &lt;math&gt;|\Phi^+\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|00\rangle+|11\rangle\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Heisenberg's principle was an attempt to provide a classical explanation of a quantum effect sometimes called [[Quantum nonlocality|non-locality]]. According to EPR there were two possible explanations.  Either there was some interaction between the particles (Even though they were separated) or the information about the outcome of all possible measurements was already present in both particles.

The EPR authors preferred the second explanation according to which that information was encoded in some '[[Hidden variable theory#EPR paradox|hidden parameters]]'. The first explanation of an effect propagating instantly across a distance is in conflict with the [[theory of relativity]]. They then concluded that quantum mechanics was incomplete since its formalism does not permit hidden parameters.

Violations of the conclusions of Bell's theorem are generally understood to have demonstrated that the hypotheses of Bell's theorem, also assumed by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen, do not apply in our world.&lt;ref name=Gaasbeek2010&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint= 1007.3977v1 |class=quant-ph|last= Gaasbeek |first= Bram |title= Demystifying the Delayed Choice Experiments |date= Jul 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most physicists who have examined the issue concur that experiments, such as those of [[Alain Aspect]] and his group, have confirmed that physical probabilities, as predicted by quantum theory, do exhibit the phenomena of Bell-inequality violations that are considered to invalidate EPR's preferred "local hidden-variables" type of explanation for the correlations to which EPR first drew attention.&lt;ref name=Bell1964&gt;Bell, John.

== Quantum mechanics and its interpretation ==
{{main article|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}
Since the early twentieth century, quantum theory has proved to be successful in describing accurately the physical reality of the [[mesoscopic scale|mesoscopic]] and microscopic world, in multiple reproducible physics experiments.

Quantum mechanics was developed with the aim of describing atoms and explaining the observed spectral lines in a measurement apparatus. Although disputed especially in the early twentieth century, it has yet to be seriously challenged. Philosophical interpretations of quantum phenomena, however, are another matter: the question of how to ''interpret'' the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics has given rise to a variety of different answers from people of different philosophical persuasions (see [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]]).

Quantum theory and quantum mechanics do not provide single measurement outcomes in a deterministic way. According to the understanding of quantum mechanics known as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], measurement causes an instantaneous collapse of the [[wave function]] describing the quantum system into an [[eigenstate]] of the [[observable]] that was measured. Einstein characterized this imagined collapse in the [[Solvay conference#Fifth Conference|1927 Solvay Conference]]. He presented a [[Einstein's thought experiments|thought experiment]] in which electrons are introduced through a small hole in a sphere whose inner surface serves as a detection screen. The electrons will contact the spherical detection screen in a widely dispersed manner. Those electrons, however, are all individually described by wave fronts that expand in all directions from the point of entry. A wave as it is understood in everyday life would paint a large area of the detection screen, but the electrons would be found to impact the screen at single points and would eventually form a pattern in keeping with the probabilities described by their identical wave functions. Einstein asks what makes each electron's wave front "collapse" at its respective location. Why do the electrons appear as single bright scintillations rather than as dim washes of energy across the surface? Why does any single electron appear at one point rather than some alternative point? The behavior of the electrons gives the impression of some signal having been sent to all possible points of contact that would have nullified all but one of them, or, in other words, would have preferentially selected a single point to the exclusion of all others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-epr/ The Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen Argument in Quantum Theory (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Einstein's opposition==
Einstein was the most prominent opponent of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]]. In his view, quantum mechanics was incomplete. Commenting on this, other writers (such as [[John von Neumann]]&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann, J. (1932/1955). In ''Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik'', Springer, Berlin, translated into English by Beyer, R.T., Princeton University Press, Princeton, cited by Baggott, J. (2004) ''Beyond Measure: Modern physics, philosophy, and the meaning of quantum theory'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, {{ISBN|0-19-852927-9}}, pages 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Bohm]]&lt;ref&gt;Bohm, D. (1951). [https://books.google.com/books?id=9DWim3RhymsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=david+bohm+quantum+theory&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6G-2u1wtav&amp;sig=Q1GcoVDLFRmKOmDYFAJte6LzrZU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Pv45TNSnLYffcfnS6foO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Quantum Theory''], Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, page 29, and Chapter 5 section 3, and Chapter 22 Section 19.&lt;/ref&gt;) hypothesized that consequently there would have to be [[hidden variable theory|'hidden' variables]] responsible for random measurement results, something which was not expressly claimed in the original paper.

The [[1935 in science|1935]] EPR paper&lt;ref name="EPR"/&gt; condensed the philosophical discussion into a physical argument. The authors claim that given a specific experiment, in which the outcome of a measurement is known before the measurement takes place, there must exist something in the real world, an "element of reality", that determines the measurement outcome. They postulate that these elements of reality are [[principle of locality|local]], in the sense that each belongs to a certain point in [[spacetime]]. Each element may only be influenced by events which are located in the backward [[light cone]] of its point in spacetime (i.e., the past). These claims are founded on assumptions about nature that constitute what is now known as [[local realism]].

Though the EPR paper has often been taken as an exact expression of Einstein's views, it was primarily authored by Podolsky, based on discussions at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] with Einstein and Rosen. Einstein later expressed to [[Erwin Schrödinger]] that, "it did not come out as well as I had originally wanted; rather, the essential thing was, so to speak, smothered by the formalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Description of the paradox ==
The original EPR paradox challenges the prediction of quantum mechanics that it is impossible to know both the position and the momentum of a quantum particle. This challenge can be extended to other pairs of physical properties.

===EPR paper===
The original paper purports to describe what must happen to "two systems I and II, which we permit to interact ...", and, after some time, "we suppose that there is no longer any interaction between the two parts." As explained by [[Manjit Kumar]] (2009), the EPR description involves "two particles, A and B, [which] interact briefly and then move off in opposite directions."&lt;ref name=Kumar2011&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]], it is impossible to measure both the momentum and the position of particle B exactly. However, it is possible to measure the exact position of particle A. By calculation, therefore, with the exact position of particle A known, the exact position of particle B can be known. Alternatively, the exact momentum of particle A can be measured, so the exact momentum of particle B can be worked out. Kumar writes: "EPR argued that they had proved that ... [particle] B can have simultaneously exact values of position and momentum. ... Particle B has a position that is real and a momentum that is real."&lt;blockquote&gt; EPR appeared to have contrived a means to establish the exact values of ''either'' the momentum ''or'' the position of B due to measurements made on particle A, without the slightest possibility of particle B being physically disturbed.&lt;ref name=Kumar2011/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
EPR tried to set up a paradox to question the range of true application of Quantum Mechanics: Quantum theory predicts that both values cannot be known for a particle, and yet the EPR thought experiment purports to show that they must all have determinate values. The EPR paper says: "We are thus forced to conclude that the quantum-mechanical description of physical reality given by wave functions is not complete."&lt;ref name=Kumar2011/&gt;

The EPR paper ends by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;While we have thus shown that the wave function does not provide a complete description of the physical reality, we left open the question of whether or not such a description exists. We believe, however, that such a theory is possible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Measurements on an entangled state ===
{{Main|Measurement in quantum mechanics}}
We have a source that emits electron–positron pairs, with the electron sent to destination ''A'', where there is an observer named [[Alice and Bob|Alice]], and the positron sent to destination ''B'', where there is an observer named [[Alice and Bob|Bob]]. According to quantum mechanics, we can arrange our source so that each emitted pair occupies a quantum state called a [[spin singlet]]. The particles are thus said to be [[quantum entanglement|entangled]]. This can be viewed as a [[quantum superposition]] of two states, which we call state I and state II. In state I, the electron has [[spin (physics)|spin]] pointing upward along the ''z''-axis (''+z'') and the positron has spin pointing downward along the ''z''-axis (−''z''). In state II, the electron has spin −''z'' and the positron has spin +''z''. Because it is in a superposition of states it is impossible without measuring to know the definite state of spin of either particle in the spin singlet.&lt;ref name=Griffiths2004&gt;{{citation| author=Griffiths, David J.|title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (2nd ed.) | publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2004 |isbn= 978-0-13-111892-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|421–422}}

[[Image:EPR illustration.svg|thumb|500px|center|The EPR thought experiment, performed with electron–positron pairs. A source (center) sends particles toward two observers, electrons to Alice (left) and positrons to Bob (right), who can perform spin measurements.]]

Alice now measures the spin along the ''z''-axis. She can obtain one of two possible outcomes: +''z'' or −''z''. Suppose she gets +''z''. According to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, the quantum state of the system [[wavefunction collapse|collapses]] into state I. The quantum state determines the probable outcomes of any measurement performed on the system. In this case, if Bob subsequently measures spin along the ''z''-axis, there is 100% probability that he will obtain −''z''. Similarly, if Alice gets −''z'', Bob will get +''z''.

There is, of course, nothing special about choosing the ''z''-axis: according to quantum mechanics the spin singlet state may equally well be expressed as a superposition of spin states pointing in the ''x'' direction.&lt;ref name=Laloe&gt;{{citation|last=Laloe|first=Franck|title=Do We Really Understand Quantum Mechanics|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=69|issue=6|pages=655–701| publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012| isbn = 978-1-107-02501-1|arxiv=quant-ph/0209123|bibcode=2002quant.ph..9123L|doi=10.1119/1.1356698}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|318}} Suppose that Alice and Bob had decided to measure spin along the ''x''-axis. We'll call these states Ia and IIa. In state Ia, Alice's electron has spin +''x'' and Bob's positron has spin −''x''. In state IIa, Alice's electron has spin −''x'' and Bob's positron has spin +''x''. Therefore, if Alice measures +''x'', the system 'collapses' into state Ia, and Bob will get −''x''. If Alice measures −''x'', the system collapses into state IIa, and Bob will get +''x''.

Whatever axis their spins are measured along, they are always found to be opposite. This can only be explained if the particles are linked in some way. Either they were created with a definite (opposite) spin about every axis—a "hidden variable" argument—&lt;!-- Is it too obvious to point out that by using a spin singlet both particles by definition have opposite spin? --&gt;or they are linked so that one electron "feels" which axis the other is having its spin measured along, and becomes its opposite about that one axis—an "entanglement" argument. Moreover, if the two particles have their spins measured about ''different'' axes, once the electron's spin has been measured about the ''x''-axis (and the positron's spin about the ''x''-axis deduced), the positron's spin about the ''z''-axis will no longer be certain, as if (a) it knows that the measurement has taken place, or (b) it has a definite spin already, about a ''second'' axis—a hidden variable. However, it turns out that the predictions of Quantum Mechanics, which have been confirmed by experiment, cannot be explained by any local hidden variable theory. This is demonstrated in [[Bell's theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;George Greenstein and Arthur G. Zajonc, ''The Quantum Challenge'', p. "[Experiments in the early 1980s] have conclusively shown that quantum mechanics is indeed orrect, and that the EPR argument had relied upon incorrect assumptions."&lt;/ref&gt;

In quantum mechanics, the ''x''-spin and ''z''-spin are "incompatible observables", meaning the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] applies to alternating measurements of them: a quantum state cannot possess a definite value for both of these variables. Suppose Alice measures the ''z''-spin and obtains ''+z'', so that the quantum state collapses into state I. Now, instead of measuring the ''z''-spin as well, Bob measures the ''x''-spin. According to quantum mechanics, when the system is in state I, Bob's ''x''-spin measurement will have a 50% probability of producing +''x'' and a 50% probability of -''x''. It is impossible to predict which outcome will appear until Bob actually ''performs'' the measurement.

One might imagine that, when Bob measures the ''x''-spin of his positron, he would get an answer with absolute certainty, since prior to this he hasn't disturbed his particle at all.  &lt;!-- Why would I imagine that? There seems to be no obvious link between the ''z''-axis and the ''x''-axis, hence no reason for the ''x''-axis to favour one direction over another. --&gt;   But it turns out that Bob's positron has a 50% probability of producing +''x'' and a 50% probability of −''x'', meaning the outcome is not certain. It's as if Bob's positron "knows" that Alice has measured the ''z''-spin of her electron, and hence his positron's own ''z''-spin must also be set, but its ''x''-spin remains uncertain.

Put another way, how does Bob's positron know which way to point if Alice decides (based on information unavailable to Bob) to measure x (i.e., to be the opposite of Alice's electron's spin about the ''x''-axis) and ''also'' how to point if Alice measures z, since it is only supposed to know one thing at a time?  &lt;!-- Is it too obvious to point out that in a spin singlet both particles have opposite spin? Therefore, Bob's particle will have the opposite ''x''-spin to Alice's. --&gt;    The Copenhagen interpretation rules that say the wave function "collapses" at the time of measurement, so there must be action at a distance (entanglement) or the positron must know more than it's supposed to know (hidden variables).  &lt;!-- To make the mixed part-quantum and part-classical descriptions of this experiment local, we have to say that the notebooks (and experimenters) are entangled and have linear combinations of + and – written in them, like [[Schrödinger's Cat]]. --&gt;

It is one thing to say that physical measurement of the first particle's momentum affects uncertainty in its ''own'' position, but to say that measuring the first particle's momentum affects the uncertainty in the position of the ''other'' is another thing altogether. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen asked how can the second particle "know" to have precisely defined momentum but uncertain position? Since this implies that one particle is communicating with the other instantaneously across space, i.e., faster than light, this is the "paradox".

Incidentally, Bell used spin as his example, but many types of physical quantities—referred to as "observables" in quantum mechanics—can be used. The EPR paper used [[momentum]] for the observable. Experimental realisations of the EPR scenario often use [[photon polarization]], because polarized photons are easy to prepare and measure.

=== Locality in the EPR experiment ===
EPR describe the principle of locality as asserting that physical processes occurring at one place should have no immediate effect on the elements of reality at another location. At first sight, this appears to be a reasonable assumption to make, as it seems to be a consequence of [[special relativity]], which states that energy can never be transmitted faster than the [[speed of light]] without violating [[causality (physics)|causality]].&lt;ref name=Griffiths2004/&gt;{{rp|427–428}}&lt;ref name=Blaylock&gt;{{Cite journal

However, it turns out that the usual rules for combining quantum mechanical and classical descriptions violate EPR's principle of locality without violating special relativity or causality.&lt;ref name=Griffiths2004/&gt;{{rp|427–428}}&lt;ref name=Blaylock/&gt; Causality is preserved because there is no way for Alice to transmit messages (i.e., information) to Bob by manipulating her measurement axis. Whichever axis she uses, she has a 50% probability of obtaining "+" and 50% probability of obtaining "−", completely at [[randomness|random]]; according to quantum mechanics, it is fundamentally impossible for her to influence what result she gets. Furthermore, Bob is only able to perform his measurement ''once'': there is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics, the [[no cloning theorem]], which makes it impossible for him to make an arbitrary number of copies of the electron he receives, perform a spin measurement on each, and look at the statistical distribution of the results. Therefore, in the one measurement he is allowed to make, there is a 50% probability of getting "+" and 50% of getting "−", regardless of whether or not his axis is aligned with Alice's. 

Note that in this argument, we never assumed that energy could be transmitted faster than the speed of light. This shows that the results of the EPR experiment do not contradict the predictions of special relativity.

However, the principle of locality appeals powerfully to physical intuition, and Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen were unwilling to abandon it. Einstein derided the quantum mechanical predictions as "[[action at a distance (physics)|spooky action at a distance]]". The (incorrect) conclusion they drew was that quantum mechanics is not a complete theory.&lt;ref name=Bell1981&gt;{{cite journal

The word [[principle of locality|locality]] has several different meanings in physics. For example, in [[quantum field theory]] "locality" means that quantum fields at different points of space do not interact with one another. However, quantum field theories that are "local" in this sense ''appear'' to violate the [[principle of locality]] as defined by EPR, but they nevertheless do not violate locality in a more general sense.  [[Wavefunction collapse]] can be viewed as an epiphenomenon of [[quantum decoherence]], which in turn is nothing more than an effect of the underlying local time evolution of the wavefunction of a system and ''all'' of its environment.  Since the ''underlying'' behaviour doesn't violate causality or special relativity, it follows that neither does the additional effect of wavefunction collapse, whether real ''or'' apparent.  Therefore, as mentioned above, neither the EPR experiment nor any quantum experiment demonstrates that superluminous signaling is possible.

== Resolving the paradox ==

=== Hidden variables ===
{{main|Hidden-variable theory}}
There are several ways to resolve the EPR paradox. The one suggested by EPR is that quantum mechanics, despite its success in a wide variety of experimental scenarios, is actually an incomplete theory. In other words, there is some yet undiscovered theory of nature to which quantum mechanics acts as a kind of statistical approximation (albeit an exceedingly successful one). Unlike quantum mechanics, the more complete theory contains variables corresponding to all the "elements of reality". There must be some unknown mechanism acting on these variables to give rise to the observed effects of "non-commuting quantum observables", i.e., the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]. Such a theory is called a [[hidden variable theory]].&lt;ref name=Kumar2011/&gt;{{rp|334}}&lt;ref name="WheelerZurek2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Archibald Wheeler|author2=Wojciech Hubert Zurek|title=Quantum Theory and Measurement|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5455-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|357–358}}

To illustrate this idea, we can formulate a very simple hidden variable theory for the above thought experiment. One supposes that the quantum spin-singlet states emitted by the source are actually approximate descriptions for "true" physical states possessing definite values for the ''z''-spin and ''x''-spin. In these "true" states, the positron going to Bob always has spin values opposite to the electron going to Alice, but the values are otherwise completely random. For example, the first pair emitted by the source might be "(+''z'', −''x'') to Alice and (−''z'', +''x'') to Bob", the next pair "(−''z'', −''x'') to Alice and (+''z'', +''x'') to Bob", and so forth. Therefore, if Bob's measurement axis is aligned with Alice's, he will necessarily get the opposite of whatever Alice gets; otherwise, he will get "+" and "−" with equal probability.&lt;ref name=Sakurai&gt;{{Citation  | last1 = Sakurai  | first1 = J. J.  |last2 = Napolitano  | first2 = Jim  | title = Modern Quantum Mechanics  | edition = 2nd  | publisher = Addison-Wesley  | year = 2010|isbn =978-0805382914  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|239–240}}

Assuming we restrict our measurements to the ''z''- and ''x''-axes, such a hidden variable theory is experimentally indistinguishable from quantum mechanics. In reality, there may be an infinite number of axes along which Alice and Bob can perform their measurements, so there would have to be an infinite number of independent hidden variables. However, this is not a serious problem; we have formulated a very simplistic hidden variable theory, and a more sophisticated theory might be able to patch it up. It turns out that there is a much more serious challenge to the idea of hidden variables.

==== Bell's inequality ====
{{Main article|Bell's theorem}}
In 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that the predictions of quantum mechanics in the EPR thought experiment are significantly different from the predictions of a particular class of hidden variable theories (the ''local'' hidden variable theories). Roughly speaking, quantum mechanics has a much stronger statistical [[correlation]] with measurement results performed on different axes than do these hidden variable theories. These differences, expressed using [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality relations]] known as "Bell's inequalities", are in principle experimentally detectable. After the publication of Bell's paper, a variety of experiments to test Bell's inequalities were devised. These generally relied on measurement of [[photon polarization]]. All experiments conducted to date have found behavior in line with the predictions of standard quantum mechanics theory.

Later work by [[Henry Stapp]] showed that a key property of local hidden variable theories which lead to Bell's inequalities was [[counterfactual definiteness]]. Building on Stapp's observations, P.H. Eberhard showed that any local counterfactual model results in Bell's inequality even without the assumption of there being hidden variables unknown to physics upon which the relevant observables depend. [[Arthur Fine]] subsequently showed that any theory satisfying the inequalities can be modeled by a local hidden variable theory. (Although Eberhard referred to his result as "Bell's theorem without hidden variables", Fine used a more general definition of "hidden variables" that includes the possibility of the observables being elementary.) Fine went on to show that any stochastic factorizable model leads to Bell's inequality. Itamar Pitowsky showed that Bell's inequality was a special case of an inequality discovered by George Boole which provides a consistency check on whether data can be represented by variables on a single classical probability space. He interpreted this to be an indication that the locality assumption prevented the data from being represented as events on such a space.&lt;ref name="Pitowsky1989"&gt;{{cite book | last=Pitowsky | first=Itamar | title=Bell's Theorem, Quantum Theory and Conceptions of the Universe | chapter=From George Boole To John Bell — The Origins of Bell’s Inequality | publisher=Springer Netherlands | location=Dordrecht | year=1989 | isbn=978-90-481-4058-9 | doi=10.1007/978-94-017-0849-4_6 | pages=37–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Eberhard's proof made use of both locality and counterfactual definiteness it was assumed that an interpretation could reject either one of these to escape Bell's inequality. Violation of locality is difficult to reconcile with [[special relativity]], and is thought to be incompatible with the principle of causality, nevertheless there was renewed interest in the [[Bohm interpretation]] of quantum mechanics which keeps counterfactual definiteness while introducing a conjectured non-local mechanism in the form of the '[[quantum potential]]' that is defined as one of the terms of the Schrödinger equation. Mainstream physics preferred to keep locality and reject counterfactual definiteness. Fine's work showed that, taking locality as a given, there exist scenarios in which two statistical variables are correlated in a manner inconsistent with counterfactual definiteness, and that such scenarios are no more mysterious than any other, despite the fact that the inconsistency with counterfactual definiteness may seem counterintuitive.

Further insights resulted from the work of Lawrence J. Landau. Landau showed that if it is assumed that there is a single classical probability space underlying all the observables under consideration in the EPR experiment, Bell's inequality will result.&lt;ref name=landau87&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. J.|last=Landau|title=On the violation of Bell's inequality in quantum theory|journal=[[Physics Letters]]|volume=120|issue=2|pages=4–6|year=1987|doi=10.1016/0375-9601(87)90075-2|bibcode=1987PhLA..120...54L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the fundamental issue is that Quantum mechanical probabilities cannot be modeled using classical (Kolmogorovian) probability regardless of whether Quantum Mechanics is considered a complete description of reality or not. Regarding Landau's proof [[Ray Streater]] notes that it shows that Bohmian mechanics is inconsistent with Quantum mechanics and succumbs to Bell's inequality despite claims to the contrary by its proponents. Streater notes that Landau's proof only requires the assumption of a single classical probability space (a condition still satisfied by Bohm's theory) and the fact that Bohmian mechanics additionally postulates the existence of a non-local mechanism, cannot prevent Bell's inequality from applying to it.&lt;ref name="streater2007lost"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Streater, R.F.|title=Lost Causes in and beyond Physics|date=2017|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540365822}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99–102}}

Similar observations have been made by Karl Hess, Walter, Philipp, Hans de Raedt and Kristel Michielsen, who note that in Bell's proof, Bell's assumption of a space of hidden variables behaving as a classical probability space is sufficient to produce a contradiction with the predications of Quantum mechanics via a consistency theorem of N. N. Vorob'ev, a statistician who had built on the same work of Boole used by Pitowsky. The additional assumption of locality used by Bell is redundant and indeed Fine's work had included a derivation of Bell's inequality that did not require the assumption of locality .&lt;ref name="Hess2005"&gt;{{cite conference | last=Hess | first=Karl | title=Bell’s theorem: Critique of proofs with and without inequalities | publisher=AIP | year=2005 | issn=0094-243X | doi=10.1063/1.1874568 | pages=150–157| arxiv=quant-ph/0410015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Bell's theorem does not apply to all possible [[philosophical realism|philosophically realist]] theories. It is a common misconception that quantum mechanics is inconsistent with all notions of philosophical realism. Realist interpretations of quantum mechanics are possible, although as discussed above, such interpretations must reject counterfactual definiteness. Examples of such realist interpretations are the [[consistent histories]] interpretation and the [[transactional interpretation]] (first proposed by [[John G. Cramer]] in 1986). Griffiths notes that it is not "local realism" that is ruled out by quantum mechanics but "classical realism".&lt;ref name="Griffiths"/&gt;  Some workers in the field have also attempted to formulate hidden variable theories that exploit [[Loopholes in Bell test experiments|loopholes in actual experiments]], such as the assumptions made in interpreting experimental data, although no theory has been proposed that can reproduce all the results of quantum mechanics.

Alternatives are still possible. A recent review article based on the [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory|Wheeler–Feynman time-symmetric theory]] rewrites the entire theory in terms of retarded [[Liénard–Wiechert potential]]s only, which becomes manifestly causal, and, establishes a conservation law for total generalized momenta held instantaneously for any closed system.&lt;ref name=scott15&gt;{{cite journal |first=T. C. |last=Scott |first2=D. |last2=Andrae |title=Quantum Nonlocality and Conservation of momentum|journal=[[Physics Essays|Phys.

There are also individual EPR-like experiments that have no local hidden variables explanation. Examples have been suggested by [[David Bohm]] and by [[Lucien Hardy]].

===Einstein's hope for a purely algebraic theory===
The [[Bohm interpretation]] of quantum mechanics hypothesizes that the state of the universe evolves smoothly through time with no collapsing of quantum wavefunctions. One problem for the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is to precisely define wavefunction collapse. Einstein maintained that quantum mechanics is physically incomplete and logically unsatisfactory. In "The Meaning of Relativity", Einstein wrote, "One can give good reasons why reality cannot at all be represented by a continuous field. From the quantum phenomena it appears to follow with certainty that a finite system of finite energy can be completely described by a finite set of numbers (quantum numbers). This does not seem to be in accordance with a continuum theory and must lead to an attempt to find a purely [[Local quantum field theory|algebraic theory]] for the representation of reality. But nobody knows how to find the basis for such a theory."
If time, space, and energy are secondary features derived from a substrate below the [[Planck scale]], then Einstein's hypothetical algebraic system might resolve the EPR paradox (although Bell's theorem would still be valid). If physical reality is totally finite, then the Copenhagen interpretation might be an approximation to an information processing system below the Planck scale.

==="Acceptable theories" and the experiment===
According to the present view of the situation, quantum mechanics flatly contradicts Einstein's philosophical postulate that any acceptable physical theory must fulfill  "local realism".

In the EPR paper (1935), the authors realised that quantum mechanics was inconsistent with their assumptions, but Einstein nevertheless thought that quantum mechanics might simply be augmented by hidden variables (i.e., variables which were, at that point, still obscure to him), without any other change, to achieve an acceptable theory. He pursued these ideas for over twenty years until the end of his life, in 1955.

In contrast, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]], in his 1964 paper, showed that quantum mechanics and the class of hidden variable theories Einstein favored&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Clearing up mysteries: the original goal | url = http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmystery.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; would lead to different experimental results: different by a factor of {{sfrac|3|2}} for certain correlations. So the issue of "acceptability", up to that time mainly concerning theory, finally became experimentally decidable.

There are many [[Bell test experiments]], e.g., those of [[Alain Aspect]] and others. They support the predictions of quantum mechanics rather than the class of hidden variable theories supported by Einstein.&lt;ref name=Aspect1999/&gt;

=== Implications for quantum mechanics ===
Most physicists today believe that quantum mechanics is correct, and that the EPR paradox is a "paradox" only because classical intuitions do not correspond to physical reality. How EPR is interpreted regarding locality depends on the [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation of quantum mechanics]] one uses.  In the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], it is usually understood that instantaneous [[wave function collapse]] does occur.  However, the view that there is no ''causal'' instantaneous effect has also been proposed within the Copenhagen interpretation: in this alternative view, measurement affects our ability to define (and measure) quantities in the physical system, not the system itself. In the [[many-worlds interpretation]], locality is strictly preserved, since the effects of operations such as measurement affect only the state of the particle that is measured.&lt;ref name=Blaylock/&gt;  However, the results of the measurement are not unique—every possible result is obtained.

The EPR paradox has deepened our understanding of quantum mechanics by exposing the fundamentally non-classical characteristics of the [[measurement (quantum mechanics)|measurement]] process. Before the publication of the EPR paper, a measurement was often visualized as a physical disturbance that had to be inflicted ''directly'' upon the measured subsystem. For instance, when measuring the position of an electron, one imagines shining a light on it, thus disturbing the electron and producing the quantum mechanical uncertainties in its position. Such pat and convenient but unhelpful explanations of quantum mechanics remain commonplace today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Furuta|first1=Aya|title=One Thing Is Certain: Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle Is Not Dead|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/heisenbergs-uncertainty-principle-is-not-dead/|accessdate=16 January 2017|work=Scientific American|quote=Yet the uncertainty principle comes in two superficially similar formulations that even many practicing physicists tend to confuse.

In fact, [[Yakir Aharonov]] and his collaborators have developed a whole theory of so-called [[Weak measurement]].&lt;ref name=Laloe/&gt;{{rp|181–184}}

Technologies relying on quantum entanglement are now being developed. In [[quantum cryptography]], entangled particles are used to transmit signals that cannot be [[Eavesdropping|eavesdropped]] upon without leaving a trace. In [[quantum computation]], entangled quantum states are used to perform computations in [[parallel computing|parallel]], which may allow certain calculations to be performed much more quickly than they ever could be with classical computers.&lt;ref name=Haroche&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Haroche | first1 =Serge | last2 =Raimond | first2 =Jean-Michel | title =Exploring the Quantum: Atoms, Cavities, and Photons | publisher =Oxford University Press | edition =1st  | date =2006 | isbn =978-0198509141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|83–100}}

== Mathematical formulation ==
The above discussion can be expressed mathematically using the [[spin (physics)|quantum mechanical formulation of spin]]. The spin degree of freedom for an electron is associated with a two-dimensional complex [[vector space]] ''V'', with each quantum state corresponding to a vector in that space. The operators corresponding to the spin along the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' direction, denoted ''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''S&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' respectively, can be represented using the [[Pauli matrices]]:&lt;ref name=Sakurai /&gt;{{rp|9}}

:&lt;math&gt;
  S_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp;  1 \\ 1 &amp;  0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
  S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -i \\ i &amp;  0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
  S_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;  0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck constant]] (or the Planck constant divided by 2π).

The [[eigenstate]]s of ''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' are represented as

:&lt;math&gt;
  \left|+z\right\rangle \leftrightarrow \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}, \quad
  \left|-z\right\rangle \leftrightarrow \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the eigenstates of ''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' are represented as

:&lt;math&gt;
  \left|+x\right\rangle \leftrightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}, \quad
  \left|-x\right\rangle \leftrightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix}1\\-1\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The vector space of the electron-positron pair is &lt;math&gt; V \otimes V &lt;/math&gt;, the [[tensor product]] of the electron's and positron's vector spaces. The spin singlet state is

:&lt;math&gt;
  \left|\psi\right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \bigg (
    \left|+z\right\rangle \otimes \left|-z\right\rangle -
    \left|-z\right\rangle \otimes \left|+z\right\rang
  \bigg)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the two terms on the right hand side are what we have referred to as state I and state II above.

From the above equations, it can be shown that the spin singlet can also be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
  \left|\psi\right\rangle = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \bigg(
    \left|+x\right\rangle \otimes \left|-x\right\rangle -
    \left|-x\right\rangle \otimes \left|+x\right\rangle
  \bigg)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the terms on the right hand side are what we have referred to as state Ia and state IIa.

To illustrate how this leads to the violation of local realism, we need to show that after Alice's measurement of ''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' (or ''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''), Bob's value of ''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' (or ''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'') is uniquely determined, and therefore corresponds to an "element of physical reality". This follows from the principles of [[measurement in quantum mechanics]]. When ''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; is measured, the system state ψ collapses into an eigenvector of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;.  If the measurement result is ''+z'', this means that immediately after measurement the system state undergoes an orthogonal projection of ψ onto the
space of states of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \left| +z \right\rangle \otimes \left| \phi\right\rangle \quad \phi \in V &lt;/math&gt;

For the spin singlet, the new state is

:&lt;math&gt; \left| +z \right\rangle \otimes \left| -z \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, if Alice's measurement result is −''z'', the system undergoes an orthogonal projection onto

:&lt;math&gt; \left| -z \right\rangle \otimes \left| \phi\right\rangle \quad \phi \in V &lt;/math&gt;

which means that the new state is

:&lt;math&gt; \left|-z\right\rangle \otimes \left|+z\right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that the measurement for ''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; for Bob's positron is now determined.  It will be −''z'' in the first case or +''z'' in the second case.

It remains only to show that ''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' cannot simultaneously possess definite values in quantum mechanics. One may show in a straightforward manner that no possible vector can be an [[eigenvector]] of both matrices. More generally, one may use the fact that the operators do not [[commutation relation|commute]],

:&lt;math&gt;\left[S_x, S_z\right] = -i\hbar S_y \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;

along with the Heisenberg uncertainty relation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4160">A '''formal proof''' or '''derivation''' is a finite sequence of [[Proposition (philosophy)|sentences]] (called [[well-formed formula]]s in the case of a [[formal language]]), each of which is an [[axiom]], an assumption, or follows from the preceding sentences in the sequence by a [[rule of inference]]. If the set of assumptions is empty, then the last sentence in a formal proof is called a [[theorem]] of the [[formal system]]. The notion of theorem is not in general [[effective method|effective]], therefore there may be no method by which we can always find a proof of a given sentence or determine that none exists. The concept of [[natural deduction]] is a [[generalization]] of the concept of proof.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, ''deduction''&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorem is a [[syntactic consequence]] of all the well-formed formulas preceding it in the proof. For a well-formed formula to qualify as part of a proof, it must be the result of applying a rule of the [[deductive apparatus]] of some formal system to the previous well-formed formulae in the proof sequence. 

Formal proofs often are constructed with the help of computers in [[interactive theorem proving]]. Significantly, these proofs can be [[automated proof checking|checked automatically]], also by computer. Checking formal proofs is usually simple, while the problem of ''finding'' proofs ([[automated theorem proving]]) is usually [[Computationally intractable#Intractability|computationally intractable]] and/or only [[semi-decidable]], depending upon the formal system in use.

== Background ==
=== Formal language ===
{{Main|Formal language}} 

A ''formal language'' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of finite [[sequence (mathematics)|sequences]] of [[symbol]]s. Such a language can be defined without [[reference]] to any [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]s of any of its expressions; it can exist before any [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] is assigned to it &amp;ndash; that is, before it has any meaning. Formal proofs are expressed in some formal languages.

=== Formal grammar ===
{{main|Formal grammar|Formation rule}}

A ''formal grammar'' (also called ''formation rules'') is a precise description of the [[well-formed formula]]s of a formal language. It is synonymous with the set of [[String (computer science)|strings]] over the [[alphabet]] of the formal language which constitute well formed formulas. However, it does not describe their [[semantics]] (i.e. what they mean).

=== Formal systems ===
{{main|Formal system}}

A ''formal system'' (also called a ''logical calculus'', or a ''logical system'') consists of a formal language together with a [[deductive apparatus]] (also called a ''deductive system''). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of [[transformation rule]]s (also called ''inference rules'') or a set of [[axiom]]s, or have both. A formal system is used to [[Proof theory|derive]] one expression from one or more other expressions.

=== Interpretations ===
{{main|Formal semantics (logic)|Interpretation (logic)}}

An ''interpretation'' of a formal system is the assignment of meanings to the symbols, and values to the sentences of a formal system. The study of interpretations is called [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]]. ''Giving an interpretation'' is synonymous with ''constructing a [[Structure (mathematical logic)|model]].

[[File:Garrote Execution - 1901.png|thumb|A 1901 execution at the old Bilibid Prison, [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]]]
A '''garrote''' or '''garrote vil''' (a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word; alternative spellings include '''garotte''' and similar variants&lt;ref name=COED&gt;''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary|Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 11th Ed: '''garrotte''' is normal British English spelling, with single r alternate. Article title is US English spelling variant.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[weapon]], most often a handheld [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]] of chain, rope, scarf, wire or fishing line used to [[Strangling|strangle]] a person.&lt;ref name=NEW&gt;Newquist, H.P. and Maloof, Rich, ''This Will Kill You: A Guide to the Ways in Which We Go'', New York: St. Martin's Press, {{ISBN|978-0-312-54062-3}} (2009), pp. 133-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination weapon==
[[File:Fomfr garrote.jpg|thumb|From the torture museum of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]]]
A garrote can be made out of many different materials, including ropes, [[cable tie]]s, fishing lines, nylon, guitar strings, telephone cord or [[piano wire]].&lt;ref name=NEW/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHI&gt;Whittaker, Wayne, ''Tough Guys'', Popular Mechanics, February 1943, Vol. 79 No. 2, pp. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=STE&gt;Steele, David E., ''Silent Sentry Removal'', Black Belt Magazine, August 1986, Vol. 24 No. 8, pp. 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

A stick may be used to tighten the garrote; the Spanish word actually refers to the stick itself, so it is a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' where the eponymous component may actually be absent. In Spanish, the term may also refer to a rope and stick used to constrict a limb as a torture device.&lt;ref name=NEW/&gt;&lt;ref name=DRAE&gt;''[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?TIPO_HTML=2&amp;TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=garrote#0_7 garrote]'', 7th sense, ''[[Diccionario de la Real Academia Española]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since World War II, the garrote has been regularly employed as a weapon by soldiers as a silent means of killing sentries and other enemy personnel.&lt;ref name=WHI/&gt;&lt;ref name=STE/&gt; Instruction in the use of purpose-built and improvised garrottes is included in the training of many elite military units and special forces.&lt;ref name=STE/&gt; A typical military garrote consists of two wooden handles attached to a length of flexible wire; the wire is looped over a sentry's head and pulled taut in one motion.&lt;ref name=WHI/&gt;&lt;ref name=STE/&gt; Soldiers of the [[French Foreign Legion]] have used a particular type of double-loop garrote (referred to as ''la loupe''), where a double coil of rope or cord is dropped around a victim's neck and then pulled taut. Even if the victim pulls on one of the coils, he only succeeds in tightening the other.&lt;ref name=STE/&gt;

The garrote was widely employed in 17th- and 18th-century India as an assassination device, particularly by the [[Thuggee]] cult.&lt;ref name=NEW/&gt; Practitioners used a yellow silk or cloth scarf called a [[rumāl]].&lt;ref name=NEW/&gt; The Indian version of the garrote frequently incorporates a knot at the center intended to aid in crushing the [[larynx]] while someone applies pressure to the victim's back, usually with a foot or knee.

==Execution device==
[[File:Pedro_Berruguete_Saint_Dominic_Presiding_over_an_Auto-da-fe_1495.jpg|thumb|In this 15th-century depiction of the burning of [[Albigensian]]s after an ''[[auto da fe]]'', the condemned had been garroted previously. It is one of the first depictions of a garrote. [[Pedro Berruguete]], ''[[Saint Dominic]] Presiding over an Auto-da-fe.'']]
The garrote ({{lang-la|laqueus}}) is known to have been used in the first century BC in Rome. It is referred to in accounts of the [[Catiline#Second Catilinian Conspiracy|Second Catilinian Conspiracy]], where conspirators including [[Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura]] were strangled with a ''laqueus'' in the [[Mamertine Prison|Tullianum]], and the implement is shown in some early reliefs, e.g., ''Répertoire de Reliefs grecs et romains'', tome I, p.&amp;nbsp;341 (1919).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediterranees.net/civilisation/Rich/Articles/Supplices/Laqueus.html|title=Laqueus|publisher=Mediterranees.net|date=|accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in the [[Middle Ages]] in Spain and Portugal. It was employed during the ''[[Spanish colonization of the Americas|conquista]]'' of the Americas, notably in the execution of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] emperor [[Atahualpa]].

In the [[Ottoman Empire]], execution by strangulation was reserved for very high officials and members of the ruling family. Unlike the Spanish version, a bowstring was used instead of a tightening collar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AluFxq_GeLMC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=execution+by+the+bowstring|title=The Ottoman Empire: the classical ... - Google Books|publisher=|date=|accessdate=2009-09-16|first=Halil|last=Inalcik|isbn=978-1-84212-442-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Peninsular War#Course of the war|Peninsular War]] of 1808–1814, French forces regularly used the garrote to execute Spanish ''guerrilleros'', priests, and other opponents of Napoleonic rule. Around 1810 the earliest known metallic garrote appeared in Spain, and on 28 April 1828, the garrote was declared the sole method of executing civilians in that country. In May 1897, the last public garroting in Spain was performed in [[Barcelona]]. After that, all executions were performed inside prisons. 

===Abolition===
The last civilian executions in Spain, both by garroting, were those of [[Pilar Prades]] in May 1959 and [[José María Jarabo]] in July 1959. Recent legislation had caused many crimes (such as robbery-murder) to fall under the jurisdiction of [[Military justice|military law]]; thus, prosecutors rarely requested civilian executions. Military executions were still performed in Spain until the 1970s. The garrotings of [[Heinz Chez]] (real name Georg Michael Welzel) and [[Salvador Puig Antich]] in March 1974, both convicted in the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist State]] of killing police officers, were the last state-sanctioned garrotings in Spain and in the world.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

With the 1973 Penal Code, [[prosecutor]]s once again started requesting execution in civilian cases. If the death penalty had not been abolished in 1978 after [[caudillo]] [[Francisco Franco]]'s death, it is most likely that civilian executions would have resumed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The last man to be sentenced to death by garroting was [[José Luis Cerveto]] "el asesino de Pedralbes" in October 1977, for a double robbery–murder in May 1974.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Cerveto requested execution, but his sentence was [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]]. Another prisoner whose civilian death sentence was commuted was businessman Juan Ballot, for the [[contract killing]] of his wife in [[Navarre]] in November 1973.

In Spain, the death penalty was abolished after a new constitution was adopted in 1978. The writer [[Camilo José Cela]] obtained a garrote (which had probably been used for the execution of Puig Antich) from the ''[[General Council of the Judiciary|Consejo General del Poder Judicial]]'' to display at his foundation. The device was kept in storage in Barcelona. It was displayed in the room&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacioncela.com/asp/lasede/salas_pascualduarteI.asp|title=La Sede. Exposiciones permanentes|publisher=Fundacioncela.com|date=|accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacioncela.com/asp/lasede/salas_pascualduarteII.asp|title=La Sede. Exposiciones permanentes|publisher=Fundacioncela.com|date=|accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Cela Foundation devoted to his novel ''[[The Family of Pascual Duarte|La familia de Pascual Duarte]]'' until Puig Antich's family asked for its removal.&lt;ref name=Voz&gt;[http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/ed_corunia/noticia.jsp?CAT=127&amp;TEXTO=5302415 El director de cine Manuel Huerga presenta el libro «Cómo se hizo: Salvador»]. ''[[La Voz de Galicia]]'', 21 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, [[Andorra]] became the last country to officially abolish the death penalty by garrotting, though this method had not been employed there since the late 12th century.

A '''gladiator''' ({{lang-la|gladiator}}, "swordsman", from {{lang|la|[[gladius]]}}, "sword") was an armed combatant who entertained audiences in the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire]] in violent confrontations with other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals. Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their lives and their legal and social standing by appearing in the arena. Most were despised as slaves, schooled under harsh conditions, socially marginalized, and segregated even in death.

Irrespective of their origin, gladiators offered spectators an example of Rome's martial ethics and, in fighting or dying well, they could inspire admiration and popular acclaim. They were celebrated in high and low art, and their value as entertainers was commemorated in precious and commonplace objects throughout the Roman world.

The origin of gladiatorial combat is open to debate. There is evidence of it in funeral rites during the [[Punic Wars]] of the 3rd century BC, and thereafter it rapidly became an essential feature of politics and social life in the Roman world. Its popularity led to its use in ever more lavish and costly [[Ludi|games]].

The gladiator games lasted for nearly a thousand years, reaching their peak between the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD.  The games finally declined during the early 5th century after the adoption of [[Christianity]] as [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in 380, although beast hunts (''[[venatio]]nes'') continued into the 6th century.

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Fronton marmol anfiteatro romano de Merida.JPG|thumb|Relief of gladiators from [[Amphitheatre of Mérida]], Spain]]
Early literary sources seldom agree on the origins of gladiators and the gladiator games.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=17}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1st century BC, [[Nicolaus of Damascus]] believed they were [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|pp=16–17}}. Nicolaus cites [[Posidonius]]'s support for a [[Celt]]ic origin and Hermippus' for a [[Mantinea]]n (therefore [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]) origin.&lt;/ref&gt; A generation later, [[Livy]] wrote that they were first held in 310 BC by the [[Campania]]ns in celebration of their victory over the [[Samnium|Samnites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=4–7}}. Futrell is citing Livy, 9.40.17.&lt;/ref&gt; Long after the games had ceased, the 7th century AD writer [[Isidore of Seville]] derived Latin ''[[wiktionary:lanista#Latin|lanista]]'' (manager of gladiators) from the Etruscan word for "executioner," and the title of [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] (an official who accompanied the dead from the Roman gladiatorial arena) from [[Charun]], [[psychopomp]] of the Etruscan underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=14–15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was accepted and repeated in most early modern, standard histories of the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reappraisal of pictorial evidence supports a Campanian origin, or at least a borrowing, for the games and gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=3–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Campania hosted the earliest known gladiator schools (''[[Ludus (ancient Rome)|ludi]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=226}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tomb [[fresco]]es from the Campanian city of [[Paestum]] (4th century BC) show paired fighters, with helmets, spears and shields, in a propitiatory funeral blood-rite that anticipates early Roman gladiator games.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=226}}. Paestum was colonized by Rome in 273 BC.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to these images, supporting evidence from Etruscan tomb-paintings is tentative and late. The Paestum frescoes may represent the continuation of a much older tradition, acquired or inherited from Greek colonists of the 8th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|pp=15, 18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Livy places the first Roman gladiator games (264 BC) in the early stage of Rome's [[First Punic War]] against [[Carthage]], when Decimus Iunius Brutus Scaeva had three gladiator pairs fight to the death in Rome's "cattle market" Forum (''[[Forum Boarium]]'') to honor his dead father, Brutus Pera. This is described as a ''[[wiktionary:munus#Latin|munus]]'' (plural: ''[[Munera (ancient Rome)|munera]]''), a commemorative duty owed the [[manes]] of a dead ancestor by his descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|pp=18–19}}. Livy's account (summary 16) places beast-hunts and gladiatorial ''munera'' within this single ''[[wikt:munus|munus]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A single, later source describes the gladiator type involved as [[Thraex|Thracian]]. See {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=19}}. Welch is citing Ausanius: Seneca simply says they were "war captives".&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the ''munus'' and its [[List of Roman gladiator types|gladiator types]] was most strongly influenced by Samnium's support for [[Hannibal]] and the subsequent punitive expeditions against the Samnites by Rome and her Campanian allies; the earliest and most frequently mentioned type was the [[Samnite (gladiator type)|Samnite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=33}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=273}}. Evidence of "Samnite" as an insult in earlier writings fades as Samnium is absorbed into the Republic.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The war in Samnium, immediately afterwards, was attended with equal danger and an equally glorious conclusion. The enemy, besides their other warlike preparation, had made their battle-line to glitter with new and splendid arms. There were two corps: the shields of the one were inlaid with gold, of the other with silver&amp;nbsp;... The Romans had already heard of these splendid accoutrements, but their generals had taught them that a soldier should be rough to look on, not adorned with gold and silver but putting his trust in iron and in courage&amp;nbsp;... The [[Roman dictator|Dictator]], as decreed by the [[Roman senate|senate]], celebrated a triumph, in which by far the finest show was afforded by the captured armour. So the Romans made use of the splendid armour of their enemies to do honour to their gods; while the Campanians, in consequence of their pride and in hatred of the Samnites, equipped after this fashion the gladiators who furnished them entertainment at their feasts, and bestowed on them the name Samnites. (Livy 9.40)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=4–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Livy's account skirts the funereal, sacrificial function of early Roman gladiator combats and reflects the later theatrical ethos of the Roman gladiator show: splendidly, exotically armed and armoured [[barbarians]], treacherous and degenerate, are dominated by Roman iron and native courage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=67 (Note #84)}}. Livy's published works are often embellished with illustrative rhetorical detail.&lt;/ref&gt; His plain Romans virtuously dedicate the magnificent spoils of war to the Gods. Their Campanian allies stage a dinner entertainment using gladiators who may not be Samnites, but play the Samnite role. Other groups and tribes would join the cast list as Roman territories expanded. Most gladiators were armed and armoured in the manner of the enemies of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;The ''velutes'' and later, the ''provocatores'' were exceptions, but as "historicised" rather than contemporary Roman types. See [[List of Roman gladiator types|Gladiator types]].&lt;/ref&gt; The ''munus'' became a morally instructive form of historic enactment in which the only honourable option for the gladiator was to fight well, or else die well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=80–81}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
In 216 BC, [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 232 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], late [[Roman consul|consul]] and [[augur]], was honoured by his sons with three days of ''gladiatora munera'' in the [[Forum Romanum]], using twenty-two pairs of gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}. Welch is citing Livy, 23.30.15. The Aemilii Lepidii were one of the most important families in Rome at the time, and probably owned a gladiator school (''ludus'').&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, [[Scipio Africanus]] gave a commemorative ''munus'' in Iberia for his father and uncle, casualties in the Punic Wars. High status non-Romans, and possibly Romans too, volunteered as his gladiators.&lt;ref name="Futrell, 8-9"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=8–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The context of the [[Punic Wars]] and Rome's near-disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Cannae]] (216 BC) link these early games to munificence, the celebration of military victory and the religious expiation of military disaster; these ''munera'' appear to serve a morale-raising agenda in an era of military threat and expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The next recorded ''munus'', held for the funeral of [[Publius Licinius Crassus Dives (consul 205 BC)|Publius Licinius]] in 183 BC, was more extravagant. It involved three days of funeral games, 120 gladiators, and public distribution of meat (''visceratio data'')&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 39.46.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– a practice that reflected the gladiatorial fights at Campanian banquets described by Livy and later deplored by Silius Italicus.&lt;ref&gt;Silius Italicus quoted in {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=4–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The enthusiastic adoption of ''gladiatoria munera'' by Rome's Iberian allies shows how easily, and how early, the culture of the gladiator ''munus'' permeated places far from Rome itself. By 174 BC, "small" Roman ''munera'' (private or public), provided by an ''[[wiktionary:editor#Latin|editor]]'' of relatively low importance, may have been so commonplace and unremarkable they were not considered worth recording:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Many gladiatorial games were given in that year, some unimportant, one noteworthy beyond the rest&amp;nbsp;— that of [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus|Titus Flamininus]] which he gave to commemorate the death of his father, which lasted four days, and was accompanied by a public distribution of meats, a banquet, and scenic performances. The climax of the show which was big for the time was that in three days seventy four gladiators fought.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''Annal for the Year 174 BC'' (cited in {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 105 BC, the ruling consuls offered Rome its first taste of state-sponsored "[[barbarian]] combat" demonstrated by gladiators from Capua, as part of a training program for the military. It proved immensely popular.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=6–7}}. Wiedemann is citing Valerius Maximus, 2.3.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the gladiator contests formerly restricted to private ''munera'' were often included in the state games (''[[ludi]]'')&lt;ref&gt;The games were always referred to in the plural, as ''ludi''. Gladiator schools were also known as ''ludi'' when plural; a single school was ''ludus''&lt;/ref&gt; that accompanied the major religious festivals. Where traditional ''ludi'' had been dedicated to a deity, such as [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the ''munera'' could be dedicated to an aristocratic sponsor's divine or heroic ancestor.&lt;ref name="Lintott 2004 183"&gt;{{harvnb|Lintott|2004|p=183}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peak===
[[File:Retiarius stabs secutor (color).jpg|thumb|A ''[[retiarius]]'' stabs at a ''[[secutor]]'' with his [[trident]] in this mosaic from the villa at [[Nennig]], Germany, c. 2nd–3rd century AD.]]
Gladiator games offered their sponsors extravagantly expensive but effective opportunities for self-promotion, and gave their clients and potential voters exciting entertainment at little or no cost to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mouritsen|2001|p=97}}; {{harvnb|Coleman|1990|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gladiators became big business for trainers and owners, for politicians on the make and those who had reached the top and wished to stay there. A politically ambitious ''[[privatus]]'' (private citizen) might postpone his deceased father's ''munus'' to the election season, when a generous show might drum up votes; those in power and those seeking it needed the support of the [[plebeian]]s and their [[tribune]]s, whose votes might be won with the mere promise of an exceptionally good show.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=287}}; {{harvnb|Mouritsen|2001|pp=32, 109–111}}. Approximately 12% of Rome's adult male population could actually vote; but these were the wealthiest and most influential among ordinary citizens, well worth cultivation by any politician.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sulla]], during his term as [[praetor]], showed his usual acumen in breaking his own [[sumptuary]] laws to give the most lavish ''munus'' yet seen in Rome, on occasion of his wife's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=285}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the closing years of the politically and socially unstable Late Republic, any aristocratic owner of gladiators had political muscle at his disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=287}}; such as Caesar's Capua-based gladiators, brought to Rome as a private army to impress and overawe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=24}}. Gladiator gangs were used by Caesar and others to overawe and "persuade".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mouritsen|2001|p=61}}. Gladiators could be enrolled to serve noble households; some household slaves may have been raised and trained for this.&lt;/ref&gt; In 65 BC, newly elected [[curule aedile]] [[Julius Caesar]] held games that he justified as ''munus'' to his father, who had been dead for 20 years. Despite an already enormous personal debt, he used 320 gladiator pairs in silvered armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mouritsen|2001|p=97}}. For more details see Plutarch's ''Julius Caesar'', 5.4.&lt;/ref&gt; He had more available in Capua but the Senate, mindful of the recent [[Spartacus]] revolt and fearful of Caesar's burgeoning private armies and rising popularity, imposed a limit of 320 pairs as the maximum number of gladiators any citizen could keep in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|pp=285–287}}. See also Pliny's ''Historia Naturalis'', 33.16.53.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar's showmanship was unprecedented in scale and expense;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|pp=280, 287}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had staged a ''munus'' as memorial rather than funeral rite, eroding any practical or meaningful distinction between ''munus'' and ''ludi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=8–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladiatorial games, usually linked with beast shows, spread throughout the Republic and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}. Antiochus IV Epiphanes of Greece was keen to upstage his Roman allies, but gladiators were becoming increasingly expensive, and to save costs, all his were local volunteers.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-corruption laws of 65 and 63 BC attempted but failed to curb the political usefulness of the games to their sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=280}}. Kyle is citing Cicero's ''Lex Tullia Ambitu''.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Caesar's assassination and the [[Roman Civil War]], [[Augustus]] assumed Imperial authority over the games, including ''munera'', and formalised their provision as a civic and religious duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death as Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 184}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His revision of sumptuary law capped private and public expenditure on ''munera'', claiming to save the Roman elite from the bankruptcies they would otherwise suffer, and restricted their performance to the festivals of [[Saturnalia]] and [[Quinquatria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=45}}. Wiedemann is citing Cassius Dio, 54.2.3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Henceforth, the ceiling cost for a [[praetor]]'s "economical" official ''munus'' employing a maximum 120 gladiators was to be 25,000 denarii; a "generous" Imperial ''ludi'' might cost no less than 180,000 denarii.&lt;ref&gt;Prices in denarii cited in "Venationes," [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/venationes.html ''Encyclopaedia Romana''].&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the Empire, the greatest and most celebrated games would now be identified with the state-sponsored [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]], which furthered public recognition, respect and approval for the Emperor's divine [[numen]], his laws, and his agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Auguet|1994|p=30}}. Augustus's games each involved an average 625 gladiator pairs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lintott 2004 183"/&gt; Between 108 and 109 AD, [[Trajan]] celebrated his [[Dacia]]n victories using a reported 10,000 gladiators and 11,000 animals over 123 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death as Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 181}}. Brown is citing Dio Cassius, 68.15.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of gladiators and ''munera'' continued to spiral out of control. Legislation of 177 AD by [[Marcus Aurelius]] did little to stop it, and was completely ignored by his son, [[Commodus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
The earliest ''[[Munera (ancient Rome)|munera]]'' took place at or near the tomb of the deceased and these were organised by their ''munerator'' (who made the offering). Later games were held by an ''editor'', either identical with the ''munerator'' or an official employed by him. As time passed, these titles and meanings may have merged.&lt;ref name="Kyle 1998 80"&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Republican era, private citizens could own and train gladiators, or lease them from a ''lanista'' (owner of a gladiator training school). From the Principate onwards, private citizens could hold munera and own gladiators only under Imperial permission, and the role of ''editor'' was increasingly tied to state officialdom. Legislation by [[Claudius]] required that [[quaestor]]s, the lowest rank of Roman magistrate, personally subsidise two-thirds of the costs of games for their small-town communities&amp;nbsp;– in effect, both an advertisement of their personal generosity and a part-purchase of their office. Bigger games were put on by senior magistrates, who could better afford them. The largest and most lavish of all were paid for by the emperor himself.&lt;ref name="Futrell, 43"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=440–446}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The gladiators==
{{Main|List of Roman gladiator types}}
The earliest types of gladiator were named after Rome's enemies of that time: the [[Samnite (gladiator type)|Samnite]], [[Thraex|Thracian]] and [[List of Roman gladiator types#Gallus|Gaul]]. The Samnite, heavily armed, elegantly helmed and probably the most popular type, was renamed [[secutor]]  and the Gaul renamed [[murmillo]], once these former enemies had been conquered then absorbed into Rome's Empire. In the mid-republican ''munus'', each type seems to have fought against a similar or identical type. In the later Republic and early Empire, various "fantasy" types were introduced, and were set against dissimilar but complementary types. For example, the bareheaded, nimble [[retiarius]] ("net-man"), armoured only at the left arm and shoulder, pitted his net, trident and dagger against the more heavily armoured, helmeted Secutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most depictions of gladiators show the most common and popular types. Passing literary references to others has allowed their tentative reconstruction. Other novelties introduced around this time included gladiators who fought from [[Essedarius|chariots or carts]], or from [[Eques (ancient Rome)|horseback]].

The trade in gladiators was empire-wide, and subjected to official supervision. Rome's military success produced a supply of soldier-prisoners who were redistributed for use in State mines or amphitheatres and for sale on the open market. For example, in the aftermath of the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish Revolt]], the gladiator schools received an influx of Jews&amp;nbsp;– those rejected for training would have been sent straight to the arenas as ''noxii'' (lit. [[wiktionary:noxius#Latin|"hurtful ones"]]).&lt;ref&gt;Josephus. ''The Jewish War'', 6.418, 7.37–40; {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=93}}. ''noxii'' were the most obnoxious of criminal categories in Roman law.&lt;/ref&gt; The best&amp;nbsp;– the most robust&amp;nbsp;– were sent to Rome. In Rome's military ethos, enemy soldiers who had surrendered or allowed their own capture and enslavement had been granted an unmerited gift of life. Their training as gladiators would give them opportunity to redeem their honour in the ''munus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=120–125}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean-Leon Gerome Pollice Verso.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Pollice Verso (Gérôme)|Pollice Verso]]'' ("With a Turned Thumb"), an 1872 painting by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]]]

Two other sources of gladiators, found increasingly during the Principate and the relatively low military activity of the [[Pax Romana]], were slaves condemned to the arena (''damnati''), to gladiator schools or games (''ad ludum gladiatorium'')&lt;ref&gt;''Ludus'' meant both a game and a school&amp;nbsp;— see entries 1 to 2.C, at Lewis and Short ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=lu_dus Perseus Project]).&lt;/ref&gt; as punishment for crimes, and the paid volunteers (''[[wiktionary:auctoro#Latin|auctorati]]'') who by the late Republic may have comprised approximately half&amp;nbsp;– and possibly the most capable half&amp;nbsp;– of all gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=124}}. See also Cassius Dio's accusation of entrapment by informers to provide "arena slaves" under Claudius; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=103}}. "the best gladiators", Futrell citing Petronius's ''Satyricon'', 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of volunteers had a precedent in the Iberian ''munus'' of [[Scipio Africanus]]; but none of those had been paid.&lt;ref name="Futrell, 8-9" /&gt;

For the poor, and for non-citizens, enrollment in a gladiator school offered a trade, regular food, housing of sorts and a fighting chance of fame and fortune. [[Mark Antony]] chose a troupe of gladiators to be his personal bodyguard.&lt;ref name="Futrell, 129: citing Dio"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=129}}. Futrell is citing Cassius Dio.&lt;/ref&gt; Gladiators customarily kept their prize money and any gifts they received, and these could be substantial. [[Tiberius]] offered several retired gladiators 100,000 ''sesterces'' each to return to the arena.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius. ''Lives'', "Tiberius", [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/suet-tiberius-rolfe.html 7].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nero]] gave the gladiator Spiculus property and residence "equal to those of men who had celebrated triumphs."&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius. ''Lives'', "Nero", [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/suet-nero-rolfe.html 30].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===
{{main|Gladiatrix}}
From the 60s AD [[female gladiator]]s appear as rare and "exotic markers of exceptionally lavish spectacle".&lt;ref name="Futrell 2006 153–156"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=153–156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 66 AD, [[Nero]] had Ethiopian women, men and children fight at a ''munus'' to impress the King [[Tiridates I of Armenia|Tiridates I]] of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=112}}; {{harvnb|Jacobelli|2003|p=17}}, citing Cassius Dio, 62.3.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Romans seem to have found the idea of a female gladiator novel and entertaining, or downright absurd; Juvenal titillates his readers with a woman named "Mevia", hunting boars in the arena "with spear in hand and breasts exposed",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobelli|2003|p=17}}, citing Juvenal's ''Saturae'', 1.22–1.23.&lt;/ref&gt; and Petronius mocks the pretensions of a rich, low-class citizen, whose ''munus'' includes a woman fighting from a cart or chariot.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobelli|2003|p=18}}, citing Petronius's ''Satyricon'', 45.7.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''munus'' of 89 AD, during [[Domitian]]'s reign, featured a battle between female gladiators, described as "Amazons".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobelli|2003|p=18}}, citing Dio Cassius 67.8.4, Suetonius's ''Domitianus'' 4.2, and Statius's ''Silvae'' 1.8.51–1.8.56: see also Brunet (2014) p.480.&lt;/ref&gt; In Halicarnassus, a 2nd-century AD relief depicts two female combatants named "Amazon" and "Achillia"; their match ended in a draw.&lt;ref name="Jacobelli 2003 18"&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobelli|2003|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Potter|2010|p=408}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same century, an epigraph praises one of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]'s local elite as the first to "arm women" in the history of its games.&lt;ref name="Jacobelli 2003 18" /&gt; Female gladiators probably submitted to the same regulations and training as their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|2010|p=408}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman morality required that all gladiators be of the lowest social classes, and emperors who failed to respect this distinction earned the scorn of posterity. [[Cassius Dio]] takes pains to point out that when the much admired emperor [[Titus]] used female gladiators, they were of acceptably low class.&lt;ref name="Futrell 2006 153–156" /&gt;

Some regarded female gladiators of any type or class as a symptom of corrupted Roman appetites, morals and womanhood. Before he became emperor, [[Septimius Severus]] may have attended the [[Antioch]]ene Olympic Games, which had been revived by the emperor [[Commodus]] and included traditional Greek female athletics. His attempt to give Rome a similarly dignified display of female athletics was met by the crowd with ribald chants and cat-calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|2010|p=407}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Probably as a result, he banned the use of female gladiators in 200 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobelli|2003|p=18}}, citing Dio Cassius 75.16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|2010|p=407}}, citing Dio Cassius 75.16.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emperors===
[[Caligula]], [[Titus]], [[Hadrian]], [[Lucius Verus]], [[Caracalla]], [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] and [[Didius Julianus]] were all said to have performed in the arena, either in public or private, but risks to themselves were minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudius]], characterised by his historians as morbidly cruel and boorish, fought a whale trapped in the harbor in front of a group of spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|2006|p=576}}. Fox is citing Pliny.&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators invariably disapproved of such performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=158}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commodus]] was a fanatical participant at the ''ludi'', and compelled Rome's elite to attend his performances as gladiator, ''[[Bestiarii|bestiarius]]'' or ''[[Venatio|venator]]''. Most of his performances as a gladiator were bloodless affairs, fought with wooden swords; he invariably won. He was said to have restyled Nero's colossal statue in his own image as "[[Hercules]] Reborn", dedicated to himself as "Champion of ''secutores''; only left-handed fighter to conquer twelve times one thousand men."&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio. ''Commodus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/73*.htm 73 (Epitome)]&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to have killed 100 lions in one day, almost certainly from an elevated platform surrounding the arena perimeter, which allowed him to safely demonstrate his marksmanship. On another occasion, he decapitated a running ostrich with a specially designed dart, carried the bloodied head and his sword over to the Senatorial seats and gesticulated as though they were next.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gibbon|Womersley|2000|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As reward for these services, he drew a gigantic stipend from the public purse.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio. ''Commodus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/73*.html 73 (Epitome)]. Commodus was assassinated and posthumously declared a public enemy but was later deified.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The games==
===Preparations===
Gladiator games were advertised well beforehand, on billboards that gave the reason for the game, its editor, venue, date and the number of paired gladiators (''ordinarii'') to be used. Other highlighted features could include details of ''venationes'', executions, music and any luxuries to be provided for the spectators, such as an awning against the sun, water sprinklers, food, drink, sweets and occasionally "door prizes". For enthusiasts and gamblers, a more detailed program (''libellus'') was distributed on the day of the ''munus'', showing the names, types and match records of gladiator pairs, and their order of appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=85, 101, 110}}. Based on fragmentary Pompeian remains and citing of Pliny's ''Historia Naturalis'', 19.23–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Left-handed gladiators were advertised as a rarity; they were trained to fight right-handers, which gave them an advantage over most opponents and produced an interestingly unorthodox combination.&lt;ref name="Coleman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coleman|first=Kathleen|title=Gladiators: Heroes of the Roman Amphitheatre|work=BBC|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=21 April 2017|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/gladiators_01.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The night before the ''munus'', the gladiators were given a banquet and opportunity to order their personal and private affairs; Futrell notes its similarity to a ritualistic or sacramental "last meal".&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. ''Moral Essays'', 1099B (fully cited in {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=86–87}}): "Even among the gladiators, I see those who...find greater pleasure in freeing their slaves, and commending their wives to their friends, than in satisfying their appetites."&lt;/ref&gt; These were probably both family and public events which included even the ''noxii'', sentenced to die in the arena the following day; and the ''damnati'', who would have at least a slender chance of survival. The event may also have been used to drum up more publicity for the imminent game.&lt;ref name="Potter and Mattingly, 313"&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=313}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=86}}. Gladiatorial banquet on mosaic, El Djem.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''ludi'' and ''munus''===
Official ''munera'' of the early Imperial era seem to have followed a standard form (''munus legitimum'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A procession (''pompa'') entered the arena, led by [[lictors]] who bore the [[fasces]] that signified the magistrate-''editor'''s power over life and death. They were followed by a small band of trumpeters (''tubicines'') playing a fanfare. Images of the gods were carried in to "witness" the proceedings, followed by a scribe to record the outcome, and a man carrying the palm branch used to honour victors. The magistrate ''editor'' entered among a retinue who carried the arms and armour to be used; the gladiators presumably came in last.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=85}}. See ''[[pompa circensis]]'' for the similar procession before games were held in the circus.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The entertainments often began with ''venationes'' (beast hunts) and ''bestiarii'' (beast fighters).&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes beasts were simply exhibited, and left unharmed; see {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Next came the ''ludi meridiani'', which were of variable content but usually involved executions of ''noxii'', some of whom were condemned to be subjects of fatal re-enactments, based on Greek or Roman myths.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gladiators may have been involved in these as executioners, though most of the crowd, and the gladiators themselves, preferred the "dignity" of an even contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=94–95}}. Futrell is citing Seneca's ''On Providence'', 3.4.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also comedy fights; some may have been lethal. A crude Pompeian graffito suggests a burlesque of musicians, dressed as animals named ''Ursus tibicen'' (flute-playing bear) and ''Pullus cornicen'' (horn-blowing chicken), perhaps as accompaniment to clowning by ''[[List of Roman gladiator types|paegniarii]]'' during a "mock" contest of the ''ludi meridiani''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wisdom|McBride|2001|p=18}}. Author's drawing.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Paegniarii gladiators (from Nennig mosaic).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A duel, using whip, cudgel and shields, from the Nennig mosaic (Germany)]]

The gladiators may have held informal warm-up matches, using blunted or dummy weapons&amp;nbsp;– some ''munera'', however, may have used blunted weapons throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|2004|pp=43, 46–49}}. In the Eastern provinces of the later Empire the state ''archiereis'' combined the roles of ''editor'', Imperial cult priest and ''lanista'', giving ''gladiatoria munera'' in which the use of sharp weapons seems an exceptional honour.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''editor,'' his representative or an honoured guest would check the weapons (''probatio armorum'') for the scheduled matches.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius encouraged the use of blunted weapons: see Cassius Dio's ''Roman History'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/72*.html#p51 71.29.4].&lt;/ref&gt; These were the highlight of the day, and were as inventive, varied and novel as the ''editor'' could afford. Armatures could be very costly&amp;nbsp;– some were flamboyantly decorated with exotic feathers, jewels and precious metals. Increasingly the ''munus'' was the ''editor'''s gift to spectators who had come to expect the best as their due.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=99–100}}; {{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combat===
Lightly armed and armoured fighters, such as the [[retiarius]], would tire less rapidly than their heavily armed opponents; most bouts would have lasted 10 to 15 minutes, or 20 minutes at most.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late Republican ''munera'', between 10 and 13 matches could have been fought on one day; this assumes one match at a time in the course of an afternoon.&lt;ref name="Potter and Mattingly, 313" /&gt;

Spectators preferred to watch highly skilled, well matched ''ordinarii'' with complementary fighting styles; these were the most costly to train and to hire. A general ''[[melee]]'' of several, lower-skilled gladiators was far less costly, but also less popular. Even among the ''ordinarii'', match winners might have to fight a new, well-rested opponent, either a ''tertiarius'' ("third choice gladiator") by prearrangement; or a "substitute" gladiator (''suppositicius'') who fought at the whim of the ''editor'' as an unadvertised, unexpected "extra".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|pp=313–314}}&lt;/ref&gt; This yielded two combats for the cost of three gladiators, rather than four; such contests were prolonged, and in some cases, more bloody. Most were probably of poor quality,&lt;ref&gt;Dunkle, Roger, ''Gladiators: Violence and Spectacle in Ancient Rome'', Routledge, 2013, pp. 69 – 71; Dunkle is discussing the use of a ''suppositicius'' (a substitute used only at need, probably to prolong a particular scheduled fight) and a ''tertiarius'', citing Petronius for the latter as offering a poor quality bout.&lt;/ref&gt; but the emperor [[Caracalla]] chose to test a notably skilled and successful fighter named Bato against first one ''supposicitius'', whom he beat, and then another, who killed him.&lt;ref name="Dunkle_2013_p70-71"&gt;Dunkle, Roger, ''Gladiators: Violence and Spectacle in Ancient Rome'', Routledge, 2013, pp. 70 – 71&lt;/ref&gt; At the opposite level of the profession, a gladiator reluctant to confront his opponent might be whipped, or goaded with hot irons, until he engaged through sheer desperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fagan | first = Garrett | year = 2011 | title = The Lure of the Arena: Social Psychology and the Crowd at the Roman Games | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Pp. 217 – 218,  273, 277| isbn = 9780521196161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combats between experienced, well trained gladiators demonstrated a considerable degree of stagecraft. Among the cognoscenti, bravado and skill in combat were esteemed over mere hacking and bloodshed; some gladiators made their careers and reputation from bloodless victories. Suetonius describes an exceptional ''munus'' by Nero, in which no-one was killed, "not even ''noxii'' (enemies of the state)."&lt;ref name="Fagan"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fagan | first = Garrett | year = 2011 | title = The Lure of the Arena: Social Psychology and the Crowd at the Roman Games | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Pp. 217 – 218,  273, 277| isbn = 9780521196161 }} Fagan speculates that Nero was perversely defying the crowd's expectations, or perhaps trying to please a different kind of crowd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trained gladiators were expected to observe professional rules of combat. Most matches employed a senior referee (''summa rudis'') and an assistant, shown in mosaics with long staffs (''rudes'') to caution or separate opponents at some crucial point in the match. Referees were usually retired gladiators whose decisions, judgement and discretion were, for the most part, respected;&lt;ref&gt;Though not always: the gladiator Diodorus blames "murderous Fate and the cunning treachery of the ''summa rudis''" for his death, not his own error in not finishing off his opponent when he had the chance: see Robert, Gladiateurs, no. 79 = SgO 11/02/01&lt;/ref&gt; they could stop bouts entirely, or pause them to allow the combatants rest, refreshment and a rub-down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=101}}; based on mosaics and a Pompeian tomb relief.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludi and ''munera'' were accompanied by music, played as interludes, or building to a "frenzied crescendo" during combats, perhaps to heighten the suspense during a gladiator's appeal; blows may have been accompanied by trumpet-blasts.&lt;ref&gt;The gravestones of several musicians and gladiators mention such modulations; see Fagan, pp. 225 – 226, and footnotes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coleman"/&gt; The [[Zliten mosaic]] in Libya (circa 80–100 AD) shows musicians playing an accompaniment to provincial games (with gladiators, ''bestiarii'', or ''venatores'' and prisoners attacked by beasts). Their instruments are a long straight trumpet (''[[Lituus|tubicen]]''), a large curved horn (''[[Cornu (horn)|Cornu]]'') and a [[water organ]] (''hydraulis'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=15–16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar representations (musicians, gladiators and ''bestiari'') are found on a tomb relief in [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=15}}. Wiedemann is citing Kraus and von Matt's ''Pompei and Herculaneum'', New York, 1975, Fig. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victory and defeat===
{{See also|Pollice verso}}
A match was won by the gladiator who overcame his opponent, or killed him outright. Victors received the palm branch and an award from the ''editor''. An outstanding fighter might receive a laurel crown and money from an appreciative crowd but for anyone originally condemned ''ad ludum'' the greatest reward was manumission (emancipation), symbolised by the gift of a wooden training sword or staff (''rudis'') from the ''editor''. Martial describes a match between [[Priscus (gladiator)|Priscus]] and [[Verus (gladiator)|Verus]], who fought so evenly and bravely for so long that when both acknowledged defeat at the same instant, [[Titus]] awarded victory and a ''rudis'' to each.&lt;ref&gt;Martial. ''Liber de Spectaculis'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Flamma was awarded the ''rudis'' four times, but chose to remain a gladiator. His gravestone in [[Sicily]] includes his record: "Flamma, ''[[secutor]]'', lived 30 years, fought 34 times, won 21 times, fought to a draw 9 times, defeated 4 times, a [[Syria (Roman province)|Syrian]] by nationality. Delicatus made this for his deserving comrade-in-arms."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=112}}. Kyle is citing Robert.&lt;/ref&gt;

A gladiator could acknowledge defeat by raising a finger (''ad digitum''), in appeal to the referee to stop the combat and refer to the ''editor'', whose decision would usually rest on the crowd's response.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the earliest ''munera'', death was considered a righteous penalty for defeat; later, those who fought well might be granted remission at the whim of the crowd or the ''editor''. During the Imperial era, matches advertised as ''sine missione'' (without remission from the sentence of death) suggest that ''missio'' (the sparing of a defeated gladiator's life) had become common practice. The contract between ''editor'' and his ''lanista'' could include compensation for unexpected deaths;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; this could be "some fifty times higher than the lease price" of the gladiator.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Carter, "Gladiatorial Combat: The Rules of Engagement",
''The Classical Journal'', Vol. 102, No. 2 (Dec. – Jan., 2006/2007), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Augustus' rule, the demand for gladiators began to exceed supply, and matches ''sine missione'' were officially banned; an economical, pragmatic development that happened to match popular notions of "natural justice". When Caligula and Claudius refused to spare defeated but popular fighters, their own popularity suffered. In general, gladiators who fought well were likely to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=144–145}}. Futrell is citing Suetonius's ''Lives'', "Augustus", 45, "Caligula", 30, "Claudius", 34.&lt;/ref&gt; At a Pompeian match between chariot-fighters, Publius Ostorius, with previous 51 wins to his credit, was granted missio after losing to Scylax, with 26 victories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=85}}. This is evidenced on a roughly inscribed libellus.&lt;/ref&gt; By common custom, the spectators decided whether or not a losing gladiator should be spared, and chose the winner in the rare event of a standing tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even more rarely, perhaps uniquely, one stalemate ended in the killing of one gladiator by the ''editor'' himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=102}} (The evidence is on a stylised mosaic from Symmachus; the spectators praise the ''editor'' for "doing the right thing").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barton 2728"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barton|first=Carlin A.|date=1989|title=The Scandal of the Arena|jstor=2928482|journal=Representations|issue=27|pages= 27, 28, note 33|doi=10.2307/2928482}} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, the final decision of death or life belonged to the ''editor'', who signalled his choice with a gesture described by Roman sources as ''[[pollice verso]]'' meaning "with a turned thumb"; a description too imprecise for reconstruction of the gesture or its symbolism. Whether victorious or defeated, a gladiator was bound by oath to accept or implement his editor's decision, "the victor being nothing but the instrument of his [editor's] will."&lt;ref name="Barton 2728"/&gt; Not all ''editors'' chose to go with the crowd, and not all those condemned to death for putting on a poor show chose to submit:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Once a band of five ''[[retiarius|retiarii]]'' in tunics, matched against the same number of ''[[secutores]]'', yielded without a struggle; but when their death was ordered, one of them caught up his trident and slew all the victors. [[Caligula]] bewailed this in a public proclamation as a most cruel murder.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius. ''Lives'', "Caligula", 30.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Death and disposal===
A gladiator who was refused ''missio'' was despatched by his opponent. To die well, a gladiator should never ask for mercy, nor cry out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=140}}. Futrell is citing Cicero's ''Tuscullan Disputations'', 2.17.&lt;/ref&gt; A "good death" redeemed the gladiator from the dishonourable weakness and passivity of defeat, and provided a noble example to those who watched:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=38–39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For death, when it stands near us, gives even to inexperienced men the courage not to seek to avoid the inevitable. So the gladiator, no matter how faint-hearted he has been throughout the fight, offers his throat to his opponent and directs the wavering blade to the vital spot. (Seneca. ''Epistles'', 30.8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some mosaics show defeated gladiators kneeling in preparation for the moment of death. Seneca's "vital spot" seems to have meant the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edwards|2007|pp=66–67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gladiator remains from Ephesus confirm this.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curry|2008}}. Marks on the bones of several gladiators suggest a sword thrust into the base of the throat and down towards the heart.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GladiatorFeldflasche.jpg|thumb|A flask depicting the final phase of the fight between a ''[[murmillo]]'' (winning) and a ''[[thraex]]'']]
The body of a gladiator who had died well was placed on a couch of [[Libitina]] and removed with dignity to the arena morgue, where the corpse was stripped of armour, and probably had its throat cut to prove that dead was dead. The Christian author [[Tertullian]], commenting on ''ludi meridiani'' in Roman [[Carthage]] during the peak era of the games, describes a more humiliating method of removal. One arena official, dressed as the "brother of Jove", [[Dis Pater]] (god of the underworld) strikes the corpse with a mallet. Another, dressed as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], tests for life-signs with a heated "wand"; once confirmed as dead, the body is dragged from the arena.&lt;ref&gt;By Tertullian's time, Mercury was identified with Greek [[Hermes#Epithets of Hermes|Hermes psychopompos]], who led souls into the underworld.  Tertullian describes these events as examples of hollow impiety, in which Rome's false deities are acceptably impersonated by low and murderous persons for the purposes of human sacrifice and evil entertainment. See {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=155–168}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether these victims were gladiators or ''noxii'' is unknown. Modern pathological examination confirms the probably fatal use of a mallet on some, but not all the gladiator skulls found in a gladiators' cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossschmidt|Kanz|2006|pp=207–216}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle (1998) proposes that gladiators who disgraced themselves might have been subjected to the same indignities as ''noxii'', denied the relative mercies of a quick death and dragged from the arena as carrion. Whether the corpse of such a gladiator could be redeemed from further ignominy by friends or ''familia'' is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=40, 155–168}}. ''Dis Pater'' and Jupiter Latiaris rituals in Tertullian's ''Ad Nationes'', 1.10.47: Tertullian describes the offering of a fallen gladiator's blood to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Latiaris]] by an officiating priest&amp;nbsp;– a travesty of the offering of the blood of martyrs&amp;nbsp;– but places this within a ''munus'' (or a festival) dedicated to Jupiter Latiaris; no such practice is otherwise recorded, and Tertullian may have mistaken or reinterpreted what he saw.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bodies of ''noxii'', and possibly some ''damnati'', were thrown into rivers or dumped unburied;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=14 (including note #74)}}. Kyle contextualises Juvenal's ''panem et circenses''&amp;nbsp;– bread and games as a sop to the politically apathetic plebs (Satires, 4.10) &amp;nbsp;– within an account of the death and ''damnatio'' of [[Sejanus]], whose body was torn to pieces by the crowd and left unburied.&lt;/ref&gt; Denial of funeral rites and memorial condemned the shade (''manes'') of the deceased to restless wandering upon the earth as a dreadful ''[[lemures|larva'' or ''lemur]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius. ''Lives'', "Tiberius", 75. Suetonius has the populace wish the same fate on [[Tiberius]]'s body, a form of ''damnatio'': to be thrown in the Tiber, or left unburied, or "dragged with the hook".&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary citizens, slaves and freedmen were usually buried beyond the town or city limits, to avoid the ritual and physical pollution of the living; professional gladiators had their own, separate cemeteries. The taint of ''infamia'' was perpetual.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=128–159}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remembrance and epitaphs===
Gladiators could subscribe to a union (''collegia''), which ensured their proper burial, and sometimes a pension or compensation for wives and children. Otherwise, the gladiator's ''familia'', which included his ''lanista'', comrades and blood-kin, might fund his funeral and memorial costs, and use the memorial to assert their moral reputation as responsible, respectful colleagues or family members. Some monuments record the gladiator's career in some detail, including the number of appearances, victories  —  sometimes represented by an engraved crown or wreath  —  defeats, career duration, and age at death. Some include the gladiator's type, in words or direct representation: for example, the memorial of a retiarius at Verona included an engraved trident and sword.&lt;ref name="FIGHTING FOR IDENTITY 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=HOPE|first1=VALERIE|title=FIGHTING FOR IDENTITY: THE FUNERARY COMMEMORATION OF ITALIAN GLADIATORS*|journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies|date=January 2000|volume=44|issue=S73|pages=93–113|doi=10.1111/j.2041-5370.2000.tb01940.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=133, 149–153}}. The single name form on a gladiator memorial usually indicates a slave, two a freedman or discharged ''auctoratus'' and, very rare among gladiators, three (''"[[Roman naming conventions|tria nomina]]"'') a freedman or a full Roman citizen. See also [http://www.vroma.org/~bmcmanus/roman_names.html vroma.org] on Roman names.&lt;/ref&gt;  A wealthy editor might commission artwork to celebrate a particularly successful or memorable show, and include named portraits of winners and losers in action; the Borghese [[Gladiator Mosaic]] is a notable example. According to Cassius Dio, the emperor [[Caracalla]] gave the gladiator Bato a magnificent memorial and State funeral;&lt;ref name="Dunkle_2013_p70-71"/&gt; more typical are the simple gladiator tombs of the Eastern Roman Empire, whose brief inscriptions include the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The familia set this up in memory of Saturnilos."&lt;br /&gt;
"For Nikepharos, son of Synetos, Lakedaimonian, and for Narcissus the secutor. Titus Flavius Satyrus set up this monument in his memory from his own money."&lt;br /&gt;
"For Hermes. Paitraeites with his cell-mates set this up in memory".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=149}}. Futrell is citing Robert, #12, #24, and #109.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Very little evidence survives of the religious beliefs of gladiators as a class, or their expectations of an afterlife. Modern scholarship offers little support for the once-prevalent notion that gladiators, ''venatores'' and ''bestiarii'' were personally or professionally dedicated to the cult of the Graeco-Roman goddess [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]]. Rather, she seems to have represented a kind of "Imperial [[Fortuna]]" who dispensed Imperial retribution on the one hand, and Imperially subsidised gifts on the other – including the ''munera''. One gladiator's tomb dedication clearly states that her decisions are not to be trusted.&lt;ref&gt;Nemesis, her devotees and her place in the Roman world are fully discussed, with examples, in Hornum, Michael B., ''Nemesis, the Roman state and the games'', Brill, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Many gladiator epitaphs claim Nemesis, fate, deception or treachery as the instrument of their death, never the superior skills of the flesh-and-blood adversary who defeated and killed them. Having no personal responsibility for his own defeat and death, the losing gladiator remains the better man, worth avenging.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett G. Fagan, ''Gladiators, combatants at games'', Oxford Classical Dictionary online, Jul 2015 DOI: 10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.013.2845: "This refusal to concede honest defeat in the face of superior skill again speaks to professional pride and a certain braggadocio that is still operative today in combat sports."[http://classics.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.001.0001/acrefore-9780199381135-e-2845] (accessed April 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I, Victor, left-handed, lie here, but my homeland was in Thessalonica. Doom killed me, not the liar Pinnas. No longer let him boast. I had a fellow gladiator, Polyneikes, who killed Pinnas and avenged me. Claudius Thallus set up this memorial from what I left behind as a legacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=149}}. Futrell is citing Robert, #34.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Life expectancy===
A gladiator might expect to fight in two or three munera annually, and an unknown number would have died in their first match. Few gladiators survived more than 10 contests, though one survived an extraordinary 150 bouts;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another died at 90 years of age, presumably long after retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; A natural death following retirement is also likely for three individuals who died at 38, 45, and 48 years respectively.&lt;ref name="FIGHTING FOR IDENTITY 2000"/&gt; George Ville, using evidence from 1st century gladiator headstones, calculated an average age at death of 27, and mortality "among all who entered the arena" at 19/100.&lt;ref name="Futrell 2006 144"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=144}}. Futrell is citing George Ville.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus Junkelmann disputes Ville's calculation for average age at death; the majority would have received no headstone, and would have died early in their careers, at 18–25 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Junkelmann|2000|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the early and later Imperial periods the risk of death for defeated gladiators rose from 1/5 to 1/4, perhaps because ''missio'' was granted less often.&lt;ref name="Futrell 2006 144"/&gt; Hopkins and Beard tentatively estimate a total of 400 arenas throughout the Roman Empire at its greatest extent, with a combined total of 8,000 deaths per annum from executions, combats and accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hopkins|Beard|2005|pp=92–94}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools and training==
The earliest named gladiator school (singular: ''ludus''; plural: ''ludi'') is that of Aurelius Scaurus at Capua. He was ''lanista'' of the gladiators employed by the state circa 105 BC to instruct the legions and simultaneously entertain the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=238}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Few other ''lanistae'' are known by name: they headed their ''familia gladiatoria'', and had lawful power over life and death of every family member, including ''servi poenae'', ''auctorati'' and ancillaries. Socially, they were ''infames'', on a footing with pimps and butchers and despised as price gougers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=85, 149}}; {{harvnb|Auguet|1994|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; No such stigma was attached to a gladiator owner (''munerarius'' or ''editor'') of good family, high status and independent means;&lt;ref&gt;Ulpian. ''Edict'', Book 6; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=137–138}}. Futrell is citing ''Digest'', 3.1.1.6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] congratulated his friend Atticus on buying a splendid troop&amp;nbsp;– if he rented them out, he might recover their entire cost after two performances.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. ''Letters,'' 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Third Servile War|Spartacus revolt]] had originated in a gladiator school privately owned by [[Lentulus Batiatus]], and had been suppressed only after a protracted series of costly, sometimes disastrous campaigns by regular Roman troops. In the late Republican era, a fear of similar uprisings, the usefulness of gladiator schools in creating private armies, and the exploitation of ''munera'' for political gain led to increased restrictions on gladiator school ownership, siting and organisation. By [[Domitian]]'s time, many had been more or less absorbed by the State, including those at [[Pergamum]], [[Alexandria]], [[Praeneste]] and Capua.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|pp=285–287, 312}}. This had probably began under Augustus.&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Rome itself had four; the ''[[Ludus Magnus]]'' (the largest and most important, housing up to about 2,000 gladiators), ''[[Ludus Dacicus]]'', ''Ludus Gallicus'', and the ''Ludus Matutinus'', which trained ''bestiarii''.&lt;ref name="Kyle 1998 80" /&gt;

In the Imperial era, volunteers required a magistrate's permission to join a school as ''auctorati''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=103}}. Futrell is citing Petronius's ''Satyricon'', 45.133.&lt;/ref&gt; If this was granted, the school's physician assessed their suitability. Their contract (''auctoramentum'') stipulated how often they were to perform, their fighting style and earnings. A condemned bankrupt or debtor accepted as novice (''novicius'') could negotiate with his  ''lanista'' or ''editor'' for the partial or complete payment of his debt. Faced with runaway re-enlistment fees for skilled ''auctorati'', Marcus Aurelius set their upper limit at 12,000 ''[[sesterces]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=133}}. See also Tiberius's inducement to re-enlist.&lt;/ref&gt;

All prospective gladiators, whether volunteer or condemned, were bound to service by a sacred oath (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacramentum|sacramentum]]'').&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Petronius. ''Satyricon'', 117: "He vows to endure to be burned, to be bound, to be beaten, and to be killed by the sword."&lt;/ref&gt; Novices (''novicii'') trained under teachers of particular fighting styles, probably retired gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=138}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They could ascend through a hierarchy of grades (singular: ''palus'') in which ''primus palus'' was the highest.&lt;ref&gt;''palus'': named after the training poles, 6 Roman feet high, erected in the training arena.&lt;/ref&gt; Lethal weapons were prohibited in the schools&amp;nbsp;– weighted, blunt wooden versions were probably used. Fighting styles were probably learned through constant rehearsal as choreographed "numbers". An elegant, economical style was preferred. Training included preparation for a stoical, unflinching death. Successful training required intense commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=137}}. Futrell is citing Quintilian's ''Oratorical Institute'', 5.13.54; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=140}}. Futrell is citing Cicero's ''Tuscullan Disputations'', 2.17; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=139}}. Futrell is citing Epictetus's ''Discourse'', 3.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those condemned ''ad ludum'' were probably [[Human branding|branded]] or marked with a [[History of tattooing|tattoo]] (''stigma'', plural ''stigmata'') on the face, legs and/or hands. These ''stigmata'' may have been text&amp;nbsp;– slaves were sometimes thus marked on the forehead until Constantine banned the use of facial stigmata in 325 AD. Soldiers were routinely marked on the hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1987|pp=139–155}}. Facial ''stigmata'' represented extreme social degradation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladiators were typically accommodated in cells, arranged in barrack formation around a central practice arena. [[Juvenal]] describes the segregation of gladiators according to type and status, suggestive of rigid hierarchies within the schools: "even the lowest scum of the arena observe this rule; even in prison they're separate". &lt;!-- In the following sentence, phrases in quote-marks are verbatim from English-language source. Please do not remove or substitute for "fag", unless you're prepared to find and cite another translation of the Juvenal passage from a reliable source  --&gt;''Retiarii'' were kept away from ''damnati'', and "fag targeteers" from "armoured heavies". As most ''ordinarii'' at games were from the same school, this kept potential opponents separate and safe from each other until the lawful ''munus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=142}}. Futrell is citing Juvenal's ''Satire'', 6 [Oxford Fragment 7.13], in the translation of [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]].&lt;/ref&gt; Discipline could be extreme, even lethal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=17}}. The burning alive of a soldier who refused to become an ''auctoratus'' at a Spanish school in 43 BC is exceptional only because he was a citizen, technically exempt from such compulsion and penalty.&lt;/ref&gt; Remains of a Pompeian ''ludus'' site attest to developments in supply, demand and discipline; in its earliest phase, the building could accommodate 15–20 gladiators. Its replacement could have housed about 100 and included a very small cell, probably for lesser punishments and so low that standing was impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=148–149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet and medical care===
[[File:Gladiadores después del combate, por José Moreno Carbonero.jpg|thumb|''Gladiators after the fight'', [[José Moreno Carbonero]] (1882)]]
Despite the harsh discipline, gladiators represented a substantial investment for their ''lanista'' and were otherwise well fed and cared for. Their daily, high-energy, [[vegetarian]] diet consisted of [[barley]], boiled [[beans]], [[oatmeal]], ash and [[dried fruit]]. Gladiators were sometimes called ''hordearii'' ("eaters of barley)". Romans considered barley inferior to [[wheat]]&amp;nbsp;— a punishment for [[legionaries]] replaced their wheat ration with it&amp;nbsp;— but it was thought to strengthen the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Follain|first=John|title=The dying game: How did the gladiators really live?|work=Times Online|date=15 December 2002|accessdate=24 March 2009|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article1069977.ece|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429085905/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article1069977.ece|archivedate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular massage and high quality medical care helped mitigate an otherwise very severe training regimen. Part of [[Galen]]'s medical training was at a gladiator school in Pergamum where he saw (and would later criticise) the training, diet, and long term health prospects of the gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=141–142}}; {{harvnb|Carter|2004|pp=41–68}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal and social status==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"He vows to endure to be burned, to be bound, to be beaten, and to be killed by the sword." ''The gladiator's oath as cited by Petronius (Satyricon, 117).''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Modern customs and institutions offer few useful parallels to the legal and social context of the ''gladiatoria munera''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borkowski|du Plessis|2005|p=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman law, anyone condemned to the arena or the gladiator schools (''damnati ad ludum'') was a ''servus poenae'' (slave of the penalty), and was considered to be under sentence of death unless manumitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borkowski|du Plessis|2005}}. Manumission was seldom absolute. Terms of release were negotiated between master and slave; ''Digests'' 28.3.6.5–6 and 48.19.8.11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[rescript]] of Hadrian reminded magistrates that "those sentenced to the sword" (execution) should be despatched immediately "or at least within the year", and those sentenced to the ''ludi'' should not be discharged before five years, or three years if granted [[manumission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=123}}. Futrell is citing Ulpian's 8th book of Proconsular Functions, ''CMRL'', 11.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Only slaves found guilty of specific offences could be sentenced to the arena; however, citizens found guilty of particular offenses could be stripped of citizenship, formally enslaved, then sentenced; and slaves, once freed, could be legally reverted to slavery for certain offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death as Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 185}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Arena punishment could be given for banditry, theft and arson, and for treasons such as rebellion, census evasion to avoid paying due taxes and refusal to swear lawful oaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borkowski|du Plessis|2005|loc=Preface, p. 81}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Offenders seen as particularly obnoxious to the state (''noxii'') received the most humiliating punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coleman|1990|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1st century BC, ''noxii'' were being condemned to the beasts (''[[damnati ad bestias]]'') in the arena, with almost no chance of survival, or were made to kill each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=40–46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the early Imperial era, some were forced to participate in humiliating and novel forms of mythological or historical enactment, culminating in their execution.&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius. ''Metamorphoses'', 4.13; {{harvnb|Coleman|1990|p=71}}; {{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death as Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 185}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Those judged less harshly might be condemned ''ad ludum venatorium'' or ''ad gladiatorium''&amp;nbsp;– combat with animals or gladiators&amp;nbsp;– and armed as thought appropriate. These ''damnati'' at least might put on a good show and retrieve some respect, and very rarely, survive to fight another day. Some may even have become "proper" gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=94}}. Survival and "promotion" would have been extremely rare for ''damnati''&amp;nbsp;– and unheard of for ''noxii''&amp;nbsp;– notwithstanding [[Aulus Gellius]]'s moral tale of [[Androcles]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Painting from the Amphitheatre. Hunter with lioness - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Mérida amphitheatre]], Spain; mural of beast hunt, showing a [[Venatio|venator]] (or [[Bestiarii|bestiarius]]) and lioness]]
Among the most admired and skilled ''auctorati'' were those who, having been granted manumission, volunteered to fight in the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death as Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 186}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these highly trained and experienced specialists may have had no other practical choice open to them. Their legal status – slave or free – is uncertain. Under Roman law, a freed gladiator could not "offer such services [as those of a gladiator] after manumission, because they cannot be performed without endangering [his] life."&lt;ref&gt;D.38.1.38 pr in {{harvnb|Borkowski|du Plessis|2005|p=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All contracted volunteers, including those of equestrian and senatorial class, were legally enslaved by their ''auctoratio'' because it involved their potentially lethal submission to a master.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All ''arenarii'' (those who appeared in the arena) were "''[[infamia|infames]]'' by reputation", a form of social dishonour which excluded them from most of the advantages and rights of citizenship. Payment for such appearances compounded their ''infamia''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, William. ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities''. London: John Murray, 1875, "[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Infamia.html Roman Law&amp;nbsp;– Infamia]".&lt;/ref&gt; The legal and social status of even the most popular and wealthy ''auctorati'' was thus marginal at best. They could not vote, plead in court nor leave a will; and unless they were manumitted, their lives and property belonged to their masters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=131}}. Futrell is citing Tertullian's ''De Speculates'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there is evidence of informal if not entirely lawful practices to the contrary. Some "unfree" gladiators bequeathed money and personal property to wives and children, possibly via a sympathetic owner or ''familia''; some had their own slaves and gave them their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=86–87}}. Futrell is citing Plutarch's ''Moral Essays'', 1099B.&lt;/ref&gt; One gladiator was even granted "citizenship" to several Greek cities of the Eastern Roman world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|2004|pp=52–56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar's ''munus'' of 46 BC included at least one equestrian, son of a Praetor, and two volunteers of possible senatorial rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=25}}. Barton is citing Cassius Dio, 43.23.4–5; Suetonius, in ''Caesar'' 39.1, adds the two Senators.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus, who enjoyed watching the games, forbade the participation of senators, equestrians and their descendants as fighters or ''arenarii'', but in 11 AD he bent his own rules and allowed equestrians to volunteer because "the prohibition was no use".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=25}}. Barton is citing Cassius Dio, 56.25.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Tiberius]], the Larinum decree&lt;ref&gt;David Potter (trans.), "[http://wSalii|priest of Marsww.umich.edu/~classics/programs/class/cc/372/sibyl/db/E012.html The Senatus Consultum from Larinium]".&lt;/ref&gt; (19AD) reiterated Augustus' original prohibitions. Thereafter, [[Caligula]] flouted them and [[Claudius]] strengthened them.&lt;ref&gt;Under Caligula, participation by men and women of senatorial rank may have been encouraged, and sometimes enforced; Cassius Dio, 59.10, 13–14 and Tacitus, ''Caligula'', 15.32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nero]] and [[Commodus]] ignored them. Even after the adoption of Christianity as Rome's official religion, legislation forbade the involvement of Rome's upper social classes in the games, though not the games themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=153}}. Futrell is citing Cassius Dio, 62.17.3; see Cassius Dio, 59.10.13–14 and Tacitus's ''Caligula'', 15.32 for Caligula's extraordinary behaviour as ''editor''; ''Valentinian/Theodosius'', 15.9.1; Symacchus, ''Relatio,'' 8.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout Rome's history, some volunteers were prepared to risk loss of status or reputation by appearing in the arena, whether for payment, glory or, as in one recorded case, to revenge an affront to their personal honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=115–116 (Note #102)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=153, 156}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one extraordinary episode, an aristocratic descendant of the [[Gracchi]], already infamous for his marriage, as a bride, to a male horn player, appeared in what may have been a non-lethal or farcical match. His motives are unknown, but his voluntary and "shameless" arena appearance combined the "womanly attire" of a lowly ''[[retiarius|retiarius tunicatus]]'', adorned with golden ribbons, with the [[Apex (headdress)|apex]] headdress that marked him out as a [[Salii|priest of Mars]]. In Juvenal's account, he seems to have relished the scandalous self-display, applause and the disgrace he inflicted on his more sturdy opponent by repeatedly skipping away from the confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=26}}.

==Amphitheatres==
{{Main|List of Roman amphitheatres}}
[[File:Colosseum in Rome, Italy - April 2007.jpg|thumb|The [[Colosseum]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]]]

As ''munera'' grew larger and more popular, open spaces such as the [[Forum Romanum]] were adapted (as the Forum Boarium had been) as venues in Rome and elsewhere, with temporary, elevated seating for the patron and high status spectators; they were popular but not truly public events:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A show of gladiators was to be exhibited before the people in the market-place, and most of the magistrates erected scaffolds round about, with an intention of letting them for advantage. [[Gaius Gracchus|Caius]] commanded them to take down their scaffolds, that the poor people might see the sport without paying anything. But nobody obeying these orders of his, he gathered together a body of labourers, who worked for him, and overthrew all the scaffolds the very night before the contest was to take place. So that by the next morning the market-place was cleared, and the common people had an opportunity of seeing the pastime. In this, the populace thought he had acted the part of a man; but he much disobliged the tribunes his colleagues, who regarded it as a piece of violent and presumptuous interference.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. ''Caius Gracchus'', [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/gracchus.html 12.3–4].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some Roman writers interpret the earliest attempts to provide permanent venues as populist political graft, rightly blocked by the Senate as morally objectionable; too-frequent, excessively "luxurious" ''munera'' would corrode traditional Roman values. The provision of permanent seating was thought a particularly objectionable luxury. See Appian, ''The Civil Wars'', 128; Livy, ''Perochiae'', 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Towards the end of the Republic, Cicero (''Murena'', 72–3) still describes gladiator shows as ticketed&amp;nbsp;— their political usefulness was served by inviting the rural tribunes of the plebs, not the people of Rome ''en masse'' – but in Imperial times, poor citizens in receipt of the [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|corn dole]] were allocated at least some free seating, possibly by lottery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mouritsen|2001|p=82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others had to pay. [[Ticket resale|Ticket scalpers]] (''Locarii'') sometimes sold or let out seats at inflated prices. [[Martial]] wrote that "Hermes [a gladiator who always drew the crowds] means riches for the ticket scalpers".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=136}}. Futrell is citing Martial's ''Epigrams'', 5.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known Roman amphitheatre was built at [[Pompeii]] by [[Sulla]]n colonists, around 70 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=197}}. Welch is citing ''CIL'', X.852.&lt;/ref&gt; The first in the city of Rome was the extraordinary wooden amphitheatre of [[Gaius Scribonius Curio#Son|Gaius Scribonius Curio]] (built in 53 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=226}}. Potter and Mattingly are citing Pliny the Elder, 36.117.&lt;/ref&gt; The first part-stone amphitheatre in Rome was inaugurated in 29–30 BC, in time for the triple triumph of Octavian (later Augustus).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=226}} (see also Pliny's ''Natural History'', 36.113–5). The amphitheatre was commissioned by T. Statilius Taurus. According to Pliny, its three storeys were marble-clad, housed 3,000 bronze statues and seated 80,000 spectators. It was probably wooden-framed in part.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after it burned down in 64 AD, [[Vespasian]] began its replacement, later known as the Amphitheatrum Flavium ([[Colosseum]]), which seated 50,000 spectators and would remain the largest in the Empire. It was [[Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre|inaugurated]] by [[Titus]] in 80 AD as the personal gift of the Emperor to the people of Rome, paid for by the imperial share of booty after the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish Revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mattern|2002|pp=151–152}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:arlesarena.jpg|thumb|left|Roman arena at [[Arles]], inside view]]
Amphitheatres were usually oval in plan. Their seating tiers surrounded the arena below, where the community's judgments were meted out, in full public view. From across the stands, crowd and ''editor'' could assess each other's character and temperament. For the crowd, amphitheatres afforded unique opportunities for free expression and free speech (''theatralis licentia''). Petitions could be submitted to the ''editor'' (as magistrate) in full view of the community. ''Factiones'' and claques could vent their spleen on each other, and occasionally on Emperors. The emperor Titus's dignified yet confident ease in his management of an amphitheatre crowd and its factions were taken as a measure of his enormous popularity and the rightness of his imperium. The amphitheatre ''munus'' thus served the Roman community as living theatre and a court in miniature, in which judgement could be served not only on those in the arena below, but on their judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death As Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", pp. 184–185}}. Even emperors who disliked ''munera'' were thus obliged to attend them.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=37–42, 105}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Amphitheatres also provided a means of social control. Their seating was "disorderly and indiscriminate" until [[Augustus]] prescribed its arrangement in his Social Reforms. To persuade the Senate, he expressed his distress on behalf of a Senator who could not find seating at a crowded games in [[Pozzuoli|Puteoli]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In consequence of this the senate decreed that, whenever any public show was given anywhere, the first row of seats should be reserved for senators; and at Rome he would not allow the envoys of the free and allied nations to sit in the orchestra, since he was informed that even freedmen were sometimes appointed. He separated the soldiery from the people. He assigned special seats to the married men of the commons, to boys under age their own section and the adjoining one to their preceptors; and he decreed that no one wearing a dark cloak should sit in the middle of the house. He would not allow women to view even the gladiators except from the upper seats, though it had been the custom for men and women to sit together at such shows. Only the Vestal virgins were assigned a place to themselves, opposite the praetor's tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius. ''Lives'', "Augustus", 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These arrangements do not seem to have been strongly enforced.&lt;ref name="Futrell 205"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factions and rivals===
[[File:Pompeii - Battle at the Amphitheatre - MAN.jpg|thumb|The Amphitheatre at [[Pompeii]], depicting the riot between the [[Nocera Inferiore|Nucerians]] and the [[Pompeian]]s]]

Popular factions supported favourite gladiators and gladiator types.&lt;ref&gt;Examples are in Martial's ''Epigrams'' 14, 213 and Suetonius's ''Caligula''.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Augustan legislation, the Samnite type was renamed ''[[Secutor]]'' ("chaser", or "pursuer"). The secutor was equipped with a long, heavy "large" shield called a ''[[Scutum (shield)|scutum]]''); ''Secutores'', their supporters and any heavyweight ''secutor''-based types such as the [[Murmillo]] were ''[[secutor|secutarii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Also ''scutarii'', ''scutularii'', or ''secutoriani''.&lt;/ref&gt; Lighter types, such as the [[Thraex]], were equipped with a smaller, lighter shield called a ''[[Parma (shield)|parma]]'', from which they and their supporters were named ''parmularii'' ("small shields"). Titus and Trajan preferred the ''parmularii'' and Domitian the ''secutarii''; Marcus Aurelius took neither side. Nero seems to have enjoyed the brawls between rowdy, enthusiastic and sometimes violent factions, but called in the troops if they went too far.&lt;ref name="Futrell, 96, 104, 105"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=96,104–105}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also local rivalries. At Pompeii's amphitheatre, during Nero's reign, the trading of insults between Pompeians and [[Nuceria]]n spectators during public ''ludi'' led to stone throwing and riot. Many were killed or wounded. Nero banned gladiator ''munera'' (though not the games) at Pompeii for ten years as punishment. The story is told in Pompeian graffiti and high quality wall painting, with much boasting of Pompeii's "victory" over Nuceria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=107–108}}. See also Tacitus's ''Annals'', 14.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in Roman life==
===Role in the military===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A man who knows how to conquer in war is a man who knows how to arrange a banquet and put on a show.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 45.32–3.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rome was essentially a landowning military aristocracy. From the early days of the Republic, ten years of military service were a citizen's duty and a prerequisite for election to public office. ''[[Devotio]]'' (willingness to sacrifice one’s life to the greater good) was central to the Roman military ideal, and was the core of the Roman military oath. It applied from highest to lowest alike in the chain of command.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=81}}. It was notably fulfilled and celebrated in the battlefield ''devotio'' of two consular [[:Category:Decii|Decii]]; firstly by [[Publius Decius Mus (340 BC)|the father]] and later by his [[Publius Decius Mus (312 BC)|son]].&lt;/ref&gt; As a soldier committed his life (voluntarily, at least in theory) to the greater cause of Rome's victory, he was not expected to survive defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edwards|2007|pp=19–45}}; Livy, 22.51.5–8, has wounded Romans at Cannae stretch out their necks for the death blow by comrades: ''cf'' Cicero's death in Seneca's ''Suasoriae'', 6.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Punic Wars of the late 3rd century BC&amp;nbsp;– in particular the near-catastrophic defeat of Roman arms at Cannae&amp;nbsp;– had long-lasting effects on the Republic, its citizen armies, and the development of the gladiatorial ''munera''. In the aftermath of Cannae, Scipio Africanus crucified Roman deserters and had non-Roman deserters thrown to the beasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate refused to ransom Hannibal's Roman captives: instead, they consulted the [[Sibylline books]], then made drastic preparations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In obedience to the Books of Destiny, some strange and unusual sacrifices were made, human sacrifices amongst them. A Gaulish man and a Gaulish woman and a Greek man and a Greek woman were buried alive under the Forum Boarium&amp;nbsp;... They were lowered into a stone vault, which had on a previous occasion also been polluted by human victims, a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings. When the gods were believed to be duly propitiated&amp;nbsp;... Armour, weapons, and other things of the kind were ordered to be in readiness, and the ancient spoils gathered from the enemy were taken down from the temples and colonnades. The dearth of freemen necessitated a new kind of enlistment; 8,000 sturdy youths from amongst the slaves were armed at the public cost, after they had each been asked whether they were willing to serve or no. These soldiers were preferred, as there would be an opportunity of ransoming them when taken prisoners at a lower price.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 22.55–57.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The account notes, uncomfortably, the bloodless human sacrifices performed to help turn the tide of the war in Rome's favour. While the Senate mustered their willing slaves, Hannibal offered his dishonoured Roman captives a chance for honourable death, in what Livy describes as something very like the Roman ''munus''. The ''munus'' thus represented an essentially military, self-sacrificial ideal, taken to extreme fulfillment in the gladiator's oath.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;  By the ''devotio'' of a voluntary oath, a slave might achieve the quality of a Roman (''Romanitas''), become the embodiment of true ''virtus'' (manliness, or manly virtue), and paradoxically, be granted ''missio'' while remaining a slave.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The gladiator as a specialist fighter, and the ethos and organization of the gladiator schools, would inform the development of the Roman military as the most effective force of its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=274}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 107 BC, the [[Gaius Marius|Marian]] Reforms established the Roman army as a professional body. Two years later, following its defeat at Arausio:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...weapons training was given to soldiers by P. Rutilius, consul with C. Mallis. For he, following the example of no previous general, with teachers summoned from the gladiatorial training school of C. Aurelus Scaurus, implanted in the legions a more sophisticated method of avoiding and dealing a blow and mixed bravery with skill and skill back again with virtue so that skill became stronger by bravery's passion and passion became more wary with the knowledge of this art.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The military were great aficionados of the games, and supervised the schools. Many schools and amphitheatres were sited at or near military barracks, and some provincial army units owned gladiator troupes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Republic wore on, the term of military service increased from ten to the sixteen years formalised by Augustus in the Principate. It would rise to twenty, and later, to twenty five years. Roman military discipline was ferocious; severe enough to provoke mutiny, despite the consequences. A career as a volunteer gladiator may have seemed an attractive option for some.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mattern|2002|pp=126–128}}. Mattern is citing Tacitus's ''Annals'', 1.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In AD 69, the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], [[Otho]]'s troops at [[Bedriacum]] included 2000 gladiators. Opposite him on the field, [[Vitellius]]'s army was swollen by levies of slaves, plebs and gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mattern|2002|p=87}}. Mattern is citing Cassius Dio, 72, 73.2.3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 167 AD, troop depletions by plague and desertion may have prompted Marcus Aurelius to draft gladiators at his own expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mattern|2002|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Civil Wars that led to the Principate, Octavian (later Augustus) acquired the personal gladiator troop of his erstwhile opponent, Mark Antony. They had served their late master with exemplary loyalty but thereafter, they disappear from the record.&lt;ref name="Futrell, 129: citing Dio" /&gt;

===Religion, ethics and sentiment===
Roman writing as a whole demonstrates a deep ambivalence towards the ''gladiatoria munera''. Even the most complex and sophisticated ''munera'' of the Imperial era evoked the ancient, ancestral ''dii manes'' of the underworld and were framed by the protective, lawful rites of ''sacrificium''. Their popularity made their co-option by the state inevitable; [[Cicero]] acknowledged their sponsorship as a political imperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=16}}. Futrell is citing Cicero's ''Letters to Friends'', 2.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the popular adulation of gladiators, they were set apart, despised; and despite Cicero's contempt for the mob, he shared their admiration: "Even when [gladiators] have been felled, let alone when they are standing and fighting, they never disgrace themselves. And suppose a gladiator has been brought to the ground, when do you ever see one twist his neck away after he has been ordered to extend it for the death blow?" His own death would later emulate this example.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero's admiration: ''Tusculan Disputations'', 2.41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=39}}. Barton is citing Seneca's ''Suasoriae'', 6.17 for Cicero's death.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, Cicero could also refer to his popularist opponent [[Publius Clodius Pulcher|Clodius]], publicly and scathingly, as a ''bustuarius''&amp;nbsp;– literally, a "funeral-man", implying that Clodius has shown the moral temperament of the lowest sort of gladiator. "Gladiator" could be (and was) used as an insult throughout the Roman period, and "Samnite" doubled the insult, despite the popularity of the Samnite type.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=273}}. For ''bustuarius'', with reference to Clodius's alleged impious disturbance at the funeral of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]], see Cicero's ''In Pisonem'' (Against Piso). See {{harvnb|Bagnani|1956|p=26}}, for the bustuarius as a lower class of gladiator than one employed in the public ''munus''. Cicero's unflattering references to Marcus Antonius as ''gladiator'' are in his 2nd Philippic.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silius Italicus]] wrote, as the games approached their peak, that the degenerate [[Campania#Ancient tribes and Samnite Wars|Campanians]] had devised the very worst of precedents, which now threatened the moral fabric of Rome: "It was their custom to enliven their banquets with bloodshed and to combine with their feasting the horrid sight of armed men [(Samnites)] fighting; often the combatants fell dead above the very cups of the revelers, and the tables were stained with streams of blood. Thus demoralised was Capua."&lt;ref&gt;Silius Italicus, 11.51 (cited in {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=3}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Death could be rightly meted out as punishment, or met with equanimity in peace or war, as a gift of fate; but when inflicted as entertainment, with no underlying moral or religious purpose, it could only pollute and demean those who witnessed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death As Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 185}}. Tacitus, in ''Annals'' 15.44, describes the public repugnance towards Nero's punishment of Christians, which seemed based on his appetite for cruelty, rather than a desire for the public good.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Retiarius vs secutor from Borghese mosaic.jpg|thumb|210px|Detail of the [[Gladiator Mosaic]], 4th century AD]]

The ''munus'' itself could be interpreted as pious necessity, but its increasing luxury corroded Roman virtue, and created an un-Roman appetite for profligacy and self-indulgence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=4}}. Roman commentators associated ''munera'' with Capua's proverbial luxury and excess.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar's 46 BC ''ludi'' were mere entertainment for political gain, a waste of lives and of money that would have been better doled out to his legionary veterans.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, 43.24.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet for Seneca, and for Marcus Aurelius&amp;nbsp;– both professed [[Stoics]]&amp;nbsp;– the degradation of gladiators in the ''munus'' highlighted their Stoic virtues: their unconditional obedience to their master and to fate, and equanimity in the face of death. Having "neither hope nor illusions", the gladiator could transcend his own debased nature, and disempower death itself by meeting it face to face. Courage, dignity, altruism and loyalty were morally redemptive; [[Lucian]] idealised this principle in his story of Sisinnes, who voluntarily fought as a gladiator, earned 10,000 drachmas and used it to buy freedom for his friend, Toxaris.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=16}}; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=154}}. Futrell is citing Lucian's ''Toxaris'', 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca had a lower opinion of the mob's un-Stoical appetite for ''ludi meridiani'': "Man [is]...now slaughtered for jest and sport; and those whom it used to be unholy to train for the purpose of inflicting and enduring wounds are thrust forth exposed and defenceless."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

These accounts seek a higher moral meaning from the ''munus'', but [[Ovid]]'s very detailed (though satirical) instructions for seduction in the amphitheatre suggest that the spectacles could generate a potent and dangerously sexual atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Futrell 205"/&gt; Augustan seating prescriptions placed women&amp;nbsp;– excepting the Vestals, who were legally inviolate&amp;nbsp;– as far as possible from the action of the arena floor; or tried to. There remained the thrilling possibility of clandestine sexual transgression by high-caste spectators and their heroes of the arena. Such assignations were a source for gossip and satire but some became unforgivably public:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=85}}. This should be considered scandalous and noteworthy, rather than common.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What was the youthful charm that so fired Eppia? What hooked her? What did she see in him to make her put up with being called "the gladiator's moll"? Her poppet, her Sergius, was no chicken, with a dud arm that prompted hope of early retirement. Besides his face looked a proper mess, helmet-scarred, a great wart on his nose, an unpleasant discharge always trickling from one eye. But he was a gladiator. That word makes the whole breed seem handsome, and made her prefer him to her children and country, her sister, her husband. Steel is what they fall in love with.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal. ''Satires'', 6.102ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eppia&amp;nbsp;– a senator's wife&amp;nbsp;– and her Sergius eloped to Egypt, where he deserted her. Most gladiators would have aimed lower. Two wall ''[[graffiti]]'' in Pompeii describe Celadus the Thraex as "the sigh of the girls" and "the glory of the girls"&amp;nbsp;– which may or may not have been Celadus' own wishful thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=146}}. Futrell is citing ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', 4.4342 and 4.4345.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later Imperial era, Servius Maurus Honoratus uses the same disparaging term as Cicero&amp;nbsp;– ''bustuarius''&amp;nbsp;– for gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;Servius. ''Commentary on the "Aeneid" of Vergil'', 10.519.&lt;/ref&gt; Tertullian used it somewhat differently&amp;nbsp;– all victims of the arena were sacrificial in his eyes&amp;nbsp;– and expressed the paradox of the ''arenarii'' as a class, from a Christian viewpoint:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On the one and the same account they glorify them and they degrade and diminish them; yes, further, they openly condemn them to disgrace and civil degradation; they keep them religiously excluded from council chamber, rostrum, senate, knighthood, and every other kind of office and a good many distinctions. The perversity of it! They love whom they lower; they despise whom they approve; the art they glorify, the artist they disgrace.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. ''De Spectaculis'', 22; {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=80}}. ''Bustuarius'' is found in Tertullian's ''De Spectaculis'', 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In Roman art and culture===
[[File:Borghese gladiator 1 mosaic dn r2 c2.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Gladiator Mosaic]], displayed at the [[Galleria Borghese]]. It dates from approximately 320 AD. The Ø symbol (possibly Greek [[theta]], for [[thanatos]]) marks a gladiator killed in combat.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In this new Play, I attempted to follow the old custom of mine, of making a fresh trial; I brought it on again. In the first Act I pleased; when in the meantime a rumor spread that gladiators were about to be exhibited; the populace flock together, make a tumult, clamor aloud, and fight for their places: meantime, I was unable to maintain my place.&lt;ref&gt;Terence. ''Hecyra'', Prologue II.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Images of gladiators could be found throughout the Republic and Empire, among all classes. Walls in the 2nd century BC "Italian [[Agora]]" at [[Delos]] were decorated with paintings of gladiators. Mosaics dating from the 2nd through 4th centuries AD have been invaluable in the reconstruction of combat and its rules, gladiator types and the development of the ''munus''. Throughout the Roman world, ceramics, lamps, gems and jewellery, mosaics, reliefs, wall paintings and statuary offer evidence, sometimes the best evidence, of the clothing, props, equipment, names, events, prevalence and rules of gladiatorial combat. Earlier periods provide only occasional, perhaps exceptional examples.&lt;ref name="Brown, 181"&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death As Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 181}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gladiator Mosaic]] in the [[Galleria Borghese]] displays several gladiator types, and the [[Bignor Roman Villa]] mosaic from [[Roman Britain|Provincial Britain]] shows [[Cupid]]s as gladiators. Souvenir ceramics were produced depicting named gladiators in combat; similar images of higher quality, were available on more expensive articles in high quality ceramic, glass or silver.

[[Pliny the Elder]] gives vivid examples of the popularity of gladiator portraiture in [[Antium]] and an artistic treat laid on by an adoptive aristocrat for the solidly plebeian citizens of the Roman [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When a [[freedman]] of Nero was giving a gladiatorial show at [[Antium]], the public porticoes were covered with paintings, so we are told, containing life-like portraits of all the gladiators and assistants. This portraiture of gladiators has been the highest interest in art for many centuries now, but it was Gaius Terentius who began the practice of having pictures made of gladiatorial shows and exhibited in public; in honour of his grandfather who had adopted him he provided thirty pairs of Gladiators in the Forum for three consecutive days, and exhibited a picture of the matches in the Grove of Diana.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny. ''Natural History'', 30.32 (cited in {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Decline==
The decline of the ''munus'' was a far from straightforward process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mattern|2002|pp=130–131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[crisis of the 3rd century]] imposed increasing military demands on the imperial purse, from which the Roman Empire never quite recovered, and lesser magistrates found the obligatory ''munera'' an increasingly unrewarding tax on the doubtful privileges of office. Still, emperors continued to subsidize the games as a matter of undiminished public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Auguet|1994|pp=30, 32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 3rd century AD, the Christian writer [[Tertullian]] had acknowledged their power over the Christian flock, and was compelled to be blunt: the combats were [[murder]], their witnessing spiritually and morally harmful and the gladiator an instrument of [[pagan]] human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. ''De Spectaculis'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In the next century, [[Augustine of Hippo]] deplored the youthful fascination of his friend (and later fellow-convert and [[Bishop]]) [[Alypius of Thagaste]], with the ''munera'' [[spectacle]] as inimical to a Christian life and [[Salvation#Christianity|salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;Saint Augustine, ''Confessions'', 6.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Amphitheatres continued to host the spectacular administration of Imperial justice: in 315 [[Constantine the Great]] condemned child-snatchers ''[[ad bestias]]'' in the arena. Ten years later, he banned the gladiator ''munera'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In times in which peace and peace relating to domestic affairs prevail bloody demonstrations displease us. Therefore, we order that there may be no more gladiator combats. Those who were condemned to become gladiators for their crimes are to work from now on in the mines. Thus they pay for their crimes without having to pour their blood.&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine'', 9.18.1 and 15.12.1 (see also {{harvnb|Edwards|2007|p=215}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Mosaic museum Istanbul 2007 011.jpg|thumb|A 5th-century mosaic in the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]] depicts two ''venatores'' fighting a tiger.]]
An imperially sanctioned ''munus'' at some time in the 330s suggests that yet again, imperial legislation failed to entirely curb the games, not least when Constantine defied his own [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|2004|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 365, [[Valentinian I]] (r. 364–375) threatened to fine a [[judge]] who sentenced Christians to the arena and in 384 attempted, like most of his predecessors, to limit the expenses of ''munera''.&lt;ref&gt;See Tertullian's ''Apologetics'', 49.4 for Tertullian's condemnation of officials who sought their own "glory" by sponsoring the martyrdom of Christians.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=78}}. Compared to "pagan" ''noxii'', Christian deaths in the arena would have been few.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Theodosianus'', [http://ancientrome.ru/ius/library/codex/theod/liber09.htm 9.40.8 and 15.9.1]; Symacchus. ''Relatio'', 8.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 393, [[Theodosius I]] (r. 379–395) adopted [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicene]] Christianity as the [[state church of the Roman Empire|state religion of the Roman Empire]] and banned pagan festivals.&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Theodosianus'', 2.8.19 and 2.8.22.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ludi'' continued, very gradually shorn of their stubbornly pagan ''munera''. [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] (r. 395–423) legally ended ''munera'' in 399, and again in 404, at least in the [[Western Roman Empire]]. According to [[Theodoret]], the ban was in consequence of [[Saint Telemachus]]' martyrdom by spectators at a ''munus.''&lt;ref&gt;Telemachus had personally stepped in to prevent the ''munus''. See Theoderet's ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', 5.26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valentinian III]] (r. 425–455) repeated the ban in 438, perhaps effectively, though ''venationes'' continued beyond 536.&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Justinianus'', 3.12.9.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, interest in ''munera'' had waned throughout the Roman world. In the [[Byzantine]] Empire, [[Theatre of ancient Rome|theatrical shows]] and [[chariot race]]s continued to attract the crowds, and drew a generous Imperial subsidy.
 
It is not known how many ''gladiatoria munera'' were given throughout the Roman period. Many, if not most, involved ''venationes'', and in the later Empire some may have been only that. In 165 BC, at least one ''munus'' was held during April's [[Megalesia]]. In the early Imperial era, ''munera'' in Pompeii and neighbouring towns were dispersed from March through November. They included a provincial magnate's five-day ''munus'' of thirty pairs, plus beast-hunts.&lt;ref&gt;Alison E. Cooley and MGL Cooley, ''Pompeii, A Sourcebook'', Routledge, 2004, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; A single late primary source, the ''Calendar of Furius Dionysius Philocalus'' for 354, shows how seldom gladiators featured among a multitude of official festivals. Of 176 days reserved for spectacles of various kinds, 102 were for theatrical shows, 64 for [[chariot race]]s and just 10 in December for gladiator games and ''venationes''. A century before this, the emperor [[Alexander Severus]] (r. 222–235) may have intended a more even redistribution of ''munera'' throughout the year; but this would have broken with what had become the traditional positioning of the major gladiator games, at the year's ending. As Wiedemann points out, December was also the month for the [[Saturnalia]], [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn's]] festival, in which death was linked to renewal, and the lowest were honoured as the highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=11–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern reconstructions==
{{further|Roman-era historical reenactment|Combat reenactment|Historical European martial arts#Antiquity}}
Some Roman reenactors attempt to recreate Roman gladiator troupes.  Some of these groups are part of larger Roman reenactment groups, and others are wholly independent, though they might participate in larger demonstrations of Roman reenacting or historical reenacting in general.  These groups usually focus on portraying mock gladiatorial combat in as accurate a manner as possible.

{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}

===1940s–1960s peplum films===
Gladiator fights have been depicted in a number of [[peplum (film genre)|peplum films]] (also known as "sword-and-sandal" movies). This is a genre of largely Italian-made historical epics (costume dramas) that dominated the Italian film industry from 1958 to 1965. They can be immediately differentiated from the competing Hollywood product by their use of [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]].  The pepla attempted to emulate the big-budget Hollywood historical epics of the time, such as ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''. Inspired by the success of ''Spartacus'', there were a number of Italian peplums that emphasized the gladiatorial arena fights in their plots, with it becoming almost a peplum subgenre in itself;  One group of supermen known as "The Ten Gladiators" appeared in a trilogy, all three films starring [[Dan Vadis]] in the lead role.

'''Ignorance''' is a lack of [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ignorance|title=Ignorance|last=|first=|date=|website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ignorant|title=Ignorant meaning|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Dictionary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ignorant is an adjective that describes a person in the state of being [[Awareness|unaware]], and can describe individuals who deliberately ignore or disregard important information or facts, or individuals who are unaware of important information or facts. Ignorance can appear in three different types: factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), objectual ignorance (unacquaintance with some object), and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge of how to do something).&lt;ref&gt;Nottelmann, Nikolaj. "ignorance." ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', edited by Robert Audi, Cambridge University Press, 3rd edition, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for ignorance ==
People do not experience instant gratification and therefore they do not invest time and effort in learning and developing. Eradicating ignorance completely from an individual’s life is an impossible task but reducing the gap can truly benefit the individual in a long term.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, Bryan, and BRYAN CAPLAN. "Rational Ignorance." ''The Encyclopedia of Public Choice'', edited by Charles K. Rowley, and Friedrich Schneider, Springer Science+Business Media, 1st edition, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, making the decision to remain ignorant by committing to an ideology despite scientific proof is a dangerous mindset that can inhibit an individual from discovering the truth and therefore developing as an individual.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, Lee. "The attack on truth: we have entered an age of willful ignorance." ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', 12 June 2015, p. B10+.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignorance can stifle learning, especially if the ignorant person believes it is not ignorant. A person who falsely believes it is knowledgeable, does not try to clarify its beliefs, but rather relies on the ignorant position. It may also reject valid but contrary information, neither realizing its importance nor understanding it. This concept is elucidated in Justin Kruger and [[David Dunning]]'s work, "Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments"{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}, otherwise known as the [[Dunning–Kruger effect]].

Another reason why people are not able to obtain knowledge is inaccessibility to education. In some parts of the world, educational infrastructure is insufficient and therefore people are not able to seek for knowledge. The phenomenon can be observed widely in underdeveloped countries where many children either cannot afford to go to school or live too far from a school. On the other hand, in developed countries most children have access to a K12 education but once they graduate high school they encounter obstacles to pursue a higher education due to high costs. This lack of education can contribute to individuals not being able to practice critical thinking and seek for knowledge for themselves.

==Consequences==
Remaining in a state of ignorance can lead to serious economic downfalls, relationship crises, legal issues, and more. It is important for human survival to be knowledgeable on different topics. For example, one must be aware of ways to prevent certain diseases, avoid certain poisonous foods, avoid war, etc..

Individuals who are financially literate can manage finances wisely and therefore create a more stable life for themselves and their families. People who understand finance and economics can vote better on local and national economic regulations that benefit the whole society.

Another important aspect is ignorance in the legal field. People must be aware of laws so they can live free and in harmony with others. Ignorance of the law is not accepted as a legal defense, so it is the responsibility of the individual to know the law. Willingly ignoring the law can lead to arrest or isolated living.

Ignorance can have a negative effects on individuals and societies, but can also benefit them by creating within them the desire to know more. For example, ignorance within science opens the opportunity to seek knowledge and make discoveries by asking new questions.&lt;ref&gt;[null Firestein], Stuart. ''Ignorance: How It Drives Science''. Oxford University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This though can only take place if the individual possesses a curious mind.

Studies suggest that adults with an adequate education who perform enriching and challenging jobs are happier, and more in control of their environment.&lt;ref&gt;Schieman, Scott and Gabriele Plickert. "How Knowledge Is Power: Education and the Sense of Control." ''Social Forces'', vol. 87, no. 1, Sept. 2008, pp. 153-183.&lt;/ref&gt; The confidence that adults obtain through the sense of control that education provides allows those adults to go for more leadership positions and seek for power throughout their lives.

The writer, [[Thomas Pynchon]], articulated the following about the scope and structure of one's ignorance: "Ignorance is not just a blank space on a person's mental map. It has contours and coherence, and for all I know rules of operation as well. So as a corollary to [the advice of] writing about what we know, maybe we should add getting familiar with our ignorance, and the possibilities therein for writing a good story."{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

An '''involuntary narrative''' occurs as a personal reading of symbolic content transmitted by media-saturated environments. Exposure to postmodern nonlinear narratives, performative and mediated audiovisual arts, predisposes the individual to originate layers of symbolic meaning that overlap with socially codified environments.
The '''involuntary narrative''' has neither been constructed by an author of media content, nor read as such by a reader/spectator.

Illusion and displacement are some of the effects resulting in an individual, when connections are drawn between a trigger in one sensory channel and a result in another, virtual and physical states and conditions of one and the same object, media or technology are perceived as a continuum.  
When a purposeful overlap of the physical and the virtual takes place, it could be called [[vireal]] (Gramelsberger, Klein).

The '''involuntary narrative,''' [[hypnagogia]] and the [[Dreamachine]], trigger what is already in the individual by referring to his or her own past history. The '''involuntary narrative''' is accidental and in that differs from both the hypnagogic state and the state induced by the Dreamachine.

Auditive and visual signals, as for example mobile phone ringtones, virtual identity thumbnails, alert sounds, signals and information screens in public transport, adverts displayed in LED screens, constitute stimuli to trigger the occurrence of an involuntary narrative.
Anamnesis, as used by Pascal Broccolichi in his work ''Lexicon:'' ”when a sound, or a sound context, recalls a situation or an environment that has been taken out of its chronology”.&lt;ref&gt;A dictionary of “sound phenomena noted in various contexts with acoustic or psychoacoustic connotations”, published in: Palais de Tokyo/Magazine 09, Summer 2009, Spy Numbers, and available online at this address: http://www.pascalbroccolichi.com/index.php?/projets/lexicon/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Influences==
As the density of visible and audible mass communication in the urban environment increased in the 20th century, historical predecessors of '''involuntary narratives''' emerged. The attempt to create parallel levels of meaning in the perception of the physically real is an objective these predecessors have in common.
Applying the [[cut-up technique]], invented in the 1960s by [[Bryon Gysin]], to text, [[William Burroughs]]&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs, W. S. (1970). The Electronic Revolution. Ubuweb, 2005 edition. http://www.ubu.com/historical/burroughs/electronic_revolution.pdf (accessed 30-09-2010)&lt;/ref&gt; achieved results of new narratives (whose order/sequence had not been put together willingly) which would often yield surprising results, even giving account of future events that were later verified. 
The [[dérive]] (English: drift) developed in the 1950s by the [[Situationists]] is a technique to explore and navigate urban space without preformalized trajectories.
Misreadings of common everyday objects, as used in [[Surrealism]] and [[Dada]], some of no symbolic content, some of highly symbolic content produce results similar to the ones described here, but are always authored.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15985">'''Jacques Martin''' (1906–2001) was a [[France|French]] [[pacifist]], one of the first [[conscientious objector]]s in France, and a [[Protestant]] [[pastor]].

==Biography==

=== Youth and formative years ===
Jacques Martin was born on 24 June 1906 in [[Sainte-Colombe, Rhône]] where his father was teaching. His grandfather was a [[methodist]] minister. From 1923 to 1927, he studied at the [[Protestant Faculty of Theology in Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajpn.org/juste-Jacques-Martin-1846.html Page on Jacques Martin on the "Anonymes, Justes et Persécutés durant la période Nazie dans les communes de France" website, last accessed on 12 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; There he became friends with [[André Trocmé]], who was a few years older than him. He also met another student, [[Henri Roser]], whose militant [[pacifist]] and [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] ideas shook French protestant society of that time. Jacques Martin then became a pacifist himself, and wished to contribute personally to international reconciliation, starting with France and Germany.&lt;ref name = PC07/&gt; 
He crisscrossed Germany walking through the 1925 summer. As a member of the French branch of the [[World Student Christian Federation]] (WSCF, which is casually referred to as the “Fédé”), he took part in the 1926 German gathering of the WSCF. The same year he took charge of the editing of  “Cahiers de la Réconciliation » (at the time a simple information bulletin which would be taken over and developed by [[Henri Roser]] from November 1927 on).&lt;ref name = past/&gt;
In 1927, he took part in an "international reconciliation youth camp" in [[Vaumarcus]], Switzerland, studied one semester in [[Berlin]] in 1929, where he got in touch with German pacifist [[Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze]]. In 1930, he welcomed [[Gandhi]] in Paris. From 1930 to 1932 he was the secretary of the WSCF.&lt;ref name = PC07/&gt;

=== Conscientious objector ===
In spite of his pacifist convictions, Jacques Martin performed [[military service]] in 1927-1928 - out of care for his father who had just been shaken by the loss of two sons.&lt;ref name = PC07/&gt; However, in December 1930, he returned his military papers, specifying that, as a Christian, he could not bear arms. In 1932, he refused to take part in a training session of the [[military reserve force]] and he was consequently arrested, tried and condemned to 12 months in prison on 11 October 1932.
On 23 janvier 1934, Jacques Martin married Jacqueline Élié in [[Alès]].&lt;ref name = past/&gt;
In the summer of 1934, the young couple was expecting its first child when a new call-in letter arrived for a new follow-up military training, which he again refused to attend. He is arrested in the midst of the “Fédé”’s summer camp, and condemned to another 18 months in prison in February 1935. He was released in January 1936  and again briefly imprisoned in 1937, 1938 and 1939. His only companions on this harsh road of conscience objection were at this stage a protestant theology student, Philippe Vernier&lt;ref name = PC07/&gt; and a protestant primary school teacher Camille Rombault.&lt;ref name = JPC&gt;Jean-Paul Cahn, Françoise Knopper, Anne-Marie Saint-Gille, De la Guerre juste à la paix juste: Aspects confessionnels de la construction de la paix dans l'espace franco-allemand (XVIe-XXe siècle), Collection Histoire et civilisations, Presses Universitaires Septentrion, 2008, 313 pages, {{ISBN|9782757400388}}, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; His failing health ensured his definitive exemption from military service before the start of WWII.

Jacques Martin turned each of his trials into a platform to advertise for conscience objection. His defence counsel was solicitor and socialist MP [[André Philip]], who called upon leading intellectuals like [[Jean Guéhenno]] or [[Marc Sangnier]] and upon representatives of the [[Human Rights League (France)|French Human Rights League]]. As early as 1928, Martin had temporarily given up on his career in church ministry because of the staunch opposition of institutional protestantism towards his pacifist and anti-militaristic positions. In 1938, still unable to become a pastor, he accepted a position of administrative and human resources director in a silk stockings manufacturing plant in [[Ganges, Hérault]].

In the wake of the first [[Vichy anti-Jewish legislation]] by [[Philippe Pétain|Marshall Pétain]]’s government on 3 October 1940,  Jacques Martin decided jointly with Ganges’ pastor Élie Gounelle to call for a regional meeting of all protestant pastors in the area, in order to pray and reflect on the new situation, including the apparent support apparently extended to the Vichy government by the church authorities – including, at that early stage, by the president of the [[Protestant Federation of France]], pastor [[Marc Boegner]]. According to Jacques Martin’s own account, the day was “dedicated to the problem of anti-Semitism or rather to anti-Semitism and the [[Bible]]”.&lt;ref name = PC07/&gt; A second such meeting, in November 1942, would be organised to respond to the new situation created by the roundups of 26 August 1942 in the southern zone of France. In both of these meetings, Jacques Martin shared a very well-informed and accurate documentation which allowed pastors to prepare themselves for resistance to the anti-Semitic policy of the Vichy regime.&lt;ref name = PC07/&gt; 
At the same time, the Martins had joined the [[CIMADE]] in close cooperation with [[Madeleine Barot]]. They intervened in several ways: supplying packages with food or warm clothes for the [[Gurs internment camp]] internees, sheltering fleeing Jews and routing them towards safe caches or appropriate underground escape routes, forging identity cards and ration tickets for the hidden Jews. They also hid Jacques’ brother-in-law, pastor [[André Trocmé]] when he had to go underground in their family house in [[Drôme]]. On 22 June 1944, Jacques Martin was reported to the police by his direct neighbour. He was arrested by the [[Milice]] and detained in [[Montpellier]]’s prison. Strangely, the local Resistance managed to negotiate his release in exchange for a flock of 1’000 sheep. He was freed three days before the liberation of his area&lt;ref name = YVF/&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref name = past/&gt; 
During the war years he became friends with historian [[Jules Isaac]] who had sought refuge in Ganges.

=== Lay and clerical ministries ===
After the war, Jacques Martin was back in touch with the « Social Christians », a mainly protestant movement seeking to join together evangelism and care for the poorer classes of society; after meeting with Élie Gounelle at “[[Musée Social]] “ (a Parisian think tank), he prepared the relaunching of the movement and of its magazine, the “Revue du Christianisme Social”. He also organised the 25th Christian Social Congress in Paris.

In 1948, he participated in the creation of the French branch of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]], called les Amitiés judéo-chrétiennes (A.J.C.  -  Jewish Christian Friendships) whose first president was catholic theologian [[Henri-Irénée Marrou]], while Jacques Martin was both the first vice-president and the AJC bulletin’s editor.
While continuing with its commitments with the CIMADE, A.J.C., and Social Christians, Jacques Martin still didn’t apply to become a pastor although the institutional opposition had then faded away. ([[Henri Roser]] was for instance now in charge of a parish.) He preferred to experience the position of a "committed layman".

From 1947 to 1950, he ran a bookshop in [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon]] where he also taught Latin at the [[Collège Cévenol]], then from 1950 to 1966 he ran another bookshop in [[Lyon]].

On 29 March 1966, he welcomed [[Martin Luther King]] on his visit in Lyon.
Finally he felt the need to "bind the sheaf" and was ordained on 9 January 1966 by the [[French Reformed Church]] (after a last hesitation from the institution, as the candidate is already 60!) and took a position with the Geneva state church. He is put in charge of the creation of a new parish in a newly built area of the greater Geneva. This parish is now known as the Centre Communautaire Protestant du Lignon.&lt;ref name = past/&gt;
Having retired in 1973, he still performed pastoral tasks in Mens&lt;!--[[Mens, Isère]]?--&gt; from 1973 to 1977, and finally took full retirement in the area of [[Die, Drôme|Die]], still acting as a substitute pastor in case of vacancies).&lt;ref name = past/&gt;

He died in [[Die, Drôme|Die]] on 23 July 2001. His wife had died 5 years earlier on 30 September 1996. They had had six children: André (1934-1934), Violaine (born 1937), Daniel (born 1937), Amy-Christiane (1939-1945), Jean-Marc (born 1941) et Ariane (born 1950).&lt;ref name = past/&gt;

==Distinctions==
After WWII, he was awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945 (France)|Croix de guerre]] in tribute to his fight "to help [[Service du travail obligatoire|Compulsory Work Service dodgers]], les réfractaires, les [[Maquis (World War II)|maquisards]] and all victims of enemy repression."!&lt;ref name = YVF/&gt;
On 22 June 1998, [[Yad Vashem]] awarded the recognition of « [[Righteous Among the Nations]]» both to pastor Jacques Martin and to his wife Jacqueline.&lt;ref name = YVF/&gt;

== Contribution and legacy ==

=== Clear-sightedness over Nazism and anti-Semitism ===
Probably unique among pacifists, Jacques Martin was "one of the very few" who rejected the "hopes of a nebulous French-German reconciliation" stemming from the [[Munich agreement]] and who therefore were immediately "in Resistance", according to Jacques Martin’s own words in 1938: "I remain more than ever non-violent. But I do not harbour any confusion between non-violence and non-resistance. Non-violence means placing resistance on another level than the test of military forces. This resistance is necessary… ».&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Jacques Martin to his father-in-law, 26 October 1938, Violaine Kichenin-Martin Archives, quoted by Patrick Cabanel, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;"
In a context where justifications of [[anti-Semitism]] abound, sometimes even from protestants, Jacques Martin published in August 1939 an article entitled « Pagan … and Christian anti-Semitism” (L’Antisémitisme païen… et chrétien). In its first part, the article gives a detailed list, country by country, of anti-Semitic persecutions in Europe, while the second part deals with the Christians’ attitude and sometimes responsibility. Referring to the traditional Christian accusation of [[Jewish deicide]], he asks : « Who does not reject Christ ? Does Christianity not bear the same responsibility than the Jews for the crucifixion of its Master ? Is our own so-called Christian civilisation not bearing more witness of a deeper and more serious rejection and blasphemy than the shouts of a versatile crowd or the calculations of a [[sanhedrin]] lost in its clericalism and its pride? ».&lt;ref&gt;Article by Jacques Martin in Revue du Christianisme Social, August 1939, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preparation for anti-Nazi resistance===
With their two pastoral meeting held in [[Ganges]], Jacques Martin and Elie Gounelle prepared their colleagues to exert solidarity towards the persecuted Jews. « We had gathered all the pastors of this area of the Cevennes to study this question. These were necessary preliminaries. Caring for the Jews didn’t happen spontaneously, not even from the [[camisards]]’ memory ! A long preparation phase, a reflection were needed first, often in opposition with certain protestant theological concepts, where Judaism was regarded as a mere preamble to Christianity, whereas  there was a real spiritual problem, alongside a humanitarian situation from 1942 onwards ».&lt;ref&gt;Autobiographical text by Jacques Martin,  read during the Valleraugue seminar in 1984, quoted by Philippe Joutard, Jacques Poujol &amp; Patrick Cabanel (dir.), Cévennes, terre de refuge, 4e éd., 2006 [1987], pp. 239-240.&lt;/ref&gt; For these meetings, Jacques Martin had gathered very significant documentation, first on the events on the ground which he had ample information about through the Cimade network and through other pastors operating on the ground like [[Henri Manen]], then on the Vichy anti-Semitic laws through articles found in the Swiss protestant Press and in internal French protestant churches texts, like the [[:fr:Thèses de Pomeyrol Pomeyrol theses]].&lt;ref name = PC07/&gt;

=== Forerunner of conscientious objection in France ===
With a few of his fellow protestant theology students, Jacques Martin was a pionnier of [[pacifism]] in France ; in 1923, he was the first editor of the review of ''Mouvement international de la réconciliation'' (MIR), the French branch of the [[International Fellowship of Reconciliation]].&lt;ref name = MB88&gt;Majagira Bulangalire, Le mouvement international de la réconciliation et le problème du pacifisme dans le protestantisme français de l'entre-deux-guerres (avec un aperçu jusqu'à 1960) . In: École pratique des hautes études, Section des sciences religieuses. Annuaire. Tome 97, 1988-1989. 1988. pp. 491-493. [http://www.persee.fr/doc/ephe_0000-0002_1988_num_101_97_18313]&lt;/ref&gt; 
At his two trials, Jacques Martin was defended by sollicitor [[André Philip]], who also defended Camille Rombault and Philippe Vernier. All these trials for draft dodging made big headlines in 1932 and 1933. André Philip used them as platforms for conscientious objectors, developing his arguments further at each trial. He called upon pastors such as [[Marc Boegner]], [[Henri Nick]], [[André Trocmé]] and [[Charles Westphal]] and leading intellectuals such as [[Marc Sangnier]], [[Jean Guehenno]] and [[Julien Benda]].&lt;ref name = JPC/&gt; These trials were a wake-up call for French society and foremost for the French protestants who not only became more visible on the national scene at this occasion but whose internal opinion was also shifted at the same time.&lt;ref name = MB88/&gt; In 1948, the French Reformed Church officially adopted the position that conscientious objection was legitimate and requested the State to grant a legal status to conscientious objectors; the [[Catholic Church in France|French Catholic Church]] will wait until 1965 to take the same position.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Durand, ''La Désobéissance civile et nous; à l'école de Gandhi et Luther King''.

==Background==
Jason Kessler graduated from the [[University of Virginia]] with a bachelor of arts in psychology in 2009. Prior to his involvement in political extremism, Kessler has written that he was employed in various working class jobs as a dishwasher, gym technician, truck driver and handyman.&lt;ref name="kessler1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jasonkessler.us/about/|title=About Jason Kessler|date=October 30, 2017 |accessdate=October 30, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107014546/http://jasonkessler.us/about/ |archivedate=November 7, 2017 |quote=Prior to becoming a writer and activist he did various working class jobs from dishwasher and gym technician to truck driver and handyman.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, Kessler began his original blog JasonKessler.net.&lt;ref name="kessler2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jasonkessler.net/|title=JasonKessler.net|date=December 10, 2015|accessdate=October 30, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229204224/http://www.jasonkessler.net/|archivedate=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was used to publish and take credit for the work of another Jason Kessler, which included a [[Noir fiction|noir crime novel]], ''Badland Blues,'' as well as a work of poetry, ''Midnight Road''.&lt;ref name="kessler1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kessler3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/04/not-that-jason-kessler|title=Not That Jason Kessler|date=December 4, 2017|accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, he revealed lewd and offensive tweets made by Charlottesville vice-mayor and councilman Wes Bellamy, who is also a teacher at Charlottesville's [[Albemarle High School (Virginia)|Albemarle High School]]. Bellamy first drew criticism from Kessler when he called a press conference to call for the removal of the [[Robert E. Lee]] statue in Charlottesville in March 2016. In December, Kessler began circulating a petition demanding that Bellamy resign or be removed from office.&lt;ref name="kessler5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbc29.com/story/34520495/group-files-petition-to-have-charlottesville-vice-mayor-bellamy-recalled|title=Group Files Petition to Have Charlottesville Vice Mayor Bellamy Recalled|publisher=WVIR News|date=February 16, 2017 |access-date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the ensuing investigations, Bellamy voluntarily resigned from his teaching position at Albemarle High School in December 2016.&lt;ref name="kessler6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2016/12/01/virginia-board-of-education-member-resigns-after-vulgar-tweets-surface/|title=Virginia Board of Education member resigns after vulgar tweets surface|publisher=Washington Post|date=December 1, 2016 |access-date=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, while attempting to gain signatures for his petition Kessler was arrested for [[misdemeanor]] [[assault]] after punching a man in the face. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 50 hours of [[community service]].&lt;ref name="assault"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsplex.com/content/news/Jason-Kessler-pleads-guilty-to-assault--418532093.html|title=Jason Kessler pleads guilty to assault charge|publisher=CBS 19 News|date=April 10, 2017 |access-date=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Kessler was contracted to write two pieces for the ''[[Daily Caller]]''.&lt;ref name=nm/&gt; He wrote another piece in May about the first protests in Charlottesville over the statue of Lee.&lt;ref name=nm/&gt; Kessler has also written several posts for the anti-immigrant white nationalist site [[VDare]].&lt;ref name=nm&gt;[http://www.nationalmemo.com/right-wing-media-provided-home-white-supremacist-organized-charlottesville-rally/ nationalmemo.com: "Right-Wing Media Provided Home For White Supremacist Before He Organized Charlottesville Rally"], August 15, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; One of Kessler's posts claimed that the government was waging [[white genocide conspiracy theory|genocide against white people]] by policies that cause low Caucasian birth rates.&lt;ref name=nm/&gt;

After ''[[ProPublica]]'' contacted ''the Daily Caller'' pointing out Kessler's ties to white supremacist groups, the outlet severed its ties with Kessler, and its Executive Editor Paul Conner defended his editorial judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/author/jasonkessler/|title=Jason Kessler - The Daily Caller|date=June 15, 2017|website=archive.org|accessdate=August 21, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615054638/http://dailycaller.com/author/jasonkessler/|archivedate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pp&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/things-got-left-out-of-the-daily-callers-report-confederate-monument-rally|title=A Few Things Got Left Out of The Daily Caller's Report on Confederate Monument Rally|first=A.C.|last=Thompson|date=May 31, 2017|website=propublica.org|accessdate=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kessler was sworn in as a member of the far right organization the [[Proud Boys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Porter|first1=Tom|title=Who are the alt-right leaders and provocateurs addressing the Charlottesville white nationalist rally?|url=http://www.newsweek.com/alt-right-leaders-are-addressing-largest-white-nationalist-rally-decades-650096|accessdate=August 21, 2017|work=Newsweek|date=August 12, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proud Boys founder [[Gavin McInnes]] said that he kicked Kessler out of the group once his views on race became known.&lt;ref name=globeandmail&gt;{{cite news|last1=Houpt|first1=Simon|title=Vice co-founder Gavin McInnes's path to the far-right frontier|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/gavin-mcinnes-path-to-the-far-rightfrontier/article36024918/|accessdate=August 21, 2017|work=Globe and Mail|date=August 18, 2017|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Unite the Right rally}}
Kessler was one of the organizers of the Unite the Right rally on August 12, 2017. The rally was a protest of the removal of the statue of [[Robert E. Lee]], a cause Kessler had taken up a year earlier when he began his crusade against Bellamy. Kessler was also involved in a smaller protest of the removal of the statue on May 14, 2017 which ended in a torch-lit march.

On July 25, Kessler and most speakers scheduled to attend the rally were described by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) as [[alt-right]] leaders. The ADL's director said that Kessler was listed because of both his statements and his activities.&lt;ref name=nbcadl&gt;[http://www.nbc29.com/story/35966208/adl-lists-kessler-other-unite-the-right-speakers-as-white-supremacists nbc29.com: "ADL Lists Kessler, Other 'Unite The Right' Speakers as White Supremacists"], July 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Kessler responded by calling the ADL hypocritical for "attacking uppity whites when they support the ethno-state of Israel" and saying he was "happy to be considered the enemy of the ADL".&lt;ref name=nbcadl/&gt;

On August 7, the city manager attempted to change the location of the rally, away from Emancipation Park towards McIntire Park. The city manager confirmed that Kessler had a [[First Amendment]] right to protest but stressed the city's need to protect public safety.&lt;ref name=cv&gt;[http://www.c-ville.com/rally-relocation-city-okays-permit-mcintire-park-kessler-refuses-change/ c-ville.com: "Rally relocation: City okays permit for McIntire Park, Kessler refuses to change"], August 7, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, the [[Rutherford Institute]] and the Virginia state branch of the [[ACLU]] supported Kessler in an [[injunction]] lawsuit, later known as ''Kessler v City of Charlottesville'', in the United States District Court. They pointed out that "Two other groups that oppose Kessler's message, which have called on thousands of protesters to attend, have been granted permits by the city for downtown parks close to Emancipation Park on August 12." Arguments were heard in [[Glen E. Conrad|Judge Glen Conrad]]'s courtroom on the afternoon of August 11. The court enjoined the city from revoking Kessler's permit to conduct a demonstration at Emancipation Park on August 12, and the rally went ahead.&lt;ref name=dela&gt;[http://www.realnewsdelaware.net/index.php/2017/08/11/unite-right-rally-tomorrow-charlottesville-va/ realnewsdelaware.com: "“Unite the Right” rally tomorrow in Charlottesville, VA"], August 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The rally on August 12 turned violent and resulted in the [[Unite the Right rally#Vehicular attack and homicide|death of Heather Heyer]], when one of the rally attendees drove at high speed into a crowd of counter-protestors several blocks from the rally.&lt;ref name="NYT Heyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USAT Heyer" /&gt; On the day following the rally Kessler attempted to hold a news conference in front of Charlottesville City Hall which was quickly overtaken by protesters. However, before ending the short news conference Kessler stated "I disavow any political violence and what happened yesterday was tragic." He also posted videos online in which he blames the city for the violence and death.&lt;ref name="kessler7"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/kessler-blames-city-officials-as-news-conference-dissolves-into-chaos/article_cc7ae852-8096-11e7-8198-bbb38b7b63d1.html|title=Kessler blames city officials as news conference dissolves into chaos|author=Chris Saurez|publisher=The Daily Progress|date=August 13, 2017|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2018, a jury in Charlottesville ordered Jeffrey Winder to pay a fine of $1 and no jail times for the misdemeanor assault charge against Kessler that took place on August 13, 2017.

In November 2017, Kessler applied for a permit to hold a rally in Charlottesville in August 2018, on the anniversary of the first march.

However, other far-right individuals and groups who participated in the first Unite the Right rally, including [[Richard B.

{{Jainism}}
[[Image:Kevalajnana.jpg|thumb|Kevala Jñāna of Mahavira]]
'''Kevala jñāna''' means [[omniscience]] in [[Jainism]] and is roughly translated as absolute knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|1991|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; or supreme knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kumar|2001|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevala jnana is believed to be an intrinsic quality of all souls. This quality is masked by karmic particles that surround the soul. Every soul has the potential to obtain omniscience by shedding off these karmic particles. Jain scriptures speak of twelve stages through which the soul achieves this goal. A soul who has attained kevala jnana is called a ''kevalin'' ({{lang|sa|केवलिन्}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2000|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Jains, only kevalins can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations; others are only capable of partial knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The views of two sects of Jainism, [[Digambara]] and [[Śvētāmbara]] Jains differ on the subject of ''kevalins''. According to Digambaras, a kevalin does not experience hunger or thirst, whereas according to Svetambaras, a ''kevalin'' has normal human needs and he travels and preaches too. Digambara Jains believe that they do not act in the normal sense of the word, that they sit motionless in [[Lotus position|padmasana]], and that their bodies emit ''Divyadhvani,'' a sacred sound which is interpreted by their followers as the fundamental truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=45 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kabay|first=Paul|date=2013-05-09|title=Interpreting the Divyadhvani: On Why the Digambara Sect Is Right about the Nature of the Kevalin|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/506674|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=63|issue=2|pages=176–193|doi=10.1353/pew.2013.0020|issn=1529-1898}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to both traditions, the last ''kevalin'' was a disciple of one of the eleven chief disciples of the last ''[[tirthankara]]'', [[Mahāvīra]]; his name is recorded as [[Jambuswami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|2004|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that no one after Jambuswami will have the ability to obtain kevala jnana.

==Literary sources==
The claim of existence of omniscience by Jains, who deny the existence of a creator god, is a unique phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2001|p=98 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sutrakritanga]] text of the Svetambara school, elaborates the concept as all-knowing and provides details of his other qualities.&lt;ref name="Dundas 2002 25"&gt;{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another text, the [[Kalpa Sūtra]], gives details of Mahavira's omniscience
{{quote|When the Venerable Ascetic Mahavira had become a [[Tirthankara|Jina]] and Arhat ([[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]]), he was a Kevali, omniscient and comprehending all objects; he knew and saw all conditions of the world, of gods, men, and demons: whence they come, whither they go, whether they are born as men or animals or become gods or hell-beings (''upapada''), the ideas, the thoughts of their minds, the food, doings, desires, the open and secret deeds of all the living beings in the whole world; he the Arhat (Arihant), for whom there is no secret, knew and saw all conditions of all living beings in the world.:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2001|pp=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Immediately after the death of Mahavira, his disciple [[Indrabhuti Gautama]] became a ''kevalin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|2004|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per the tradition, the teachings of the tirthankara were memorized and preserved over many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|2004|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second ''Upanga Agama'', the ''Rājapraśnīya'', there is a dialogue between Kesi, a disciple of [[Pārśva]], and [[Payasi]], a [[materialist]] king. In this dialogue, Kesi proves the existence of [[jiva]] and its ability to obtain kevala jñana to the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jains have a long debate with [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and [[Buddhist]]s regarding omniscience. [[Bhikkhu]] [[Dharmakirti]] criticized the Jain notion of omniscience in his ''Pramanavartika''. The Hindu philosopher [[Kumarila]] argued that only [[Veda]] had the authority to define human moral values since they were "beginningless, authorless and of self-sufficient validity". In response, the [[Jain monasticism|Jain monk]] [[Haribhadra]] (c. 8th century CE) wrote that humans already had knowledge of everything knowable. It only had to be illuminated or uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omniscience was, according to Haribhadra, inherent to living beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samantabhadra (Jain monk)|Samantabhadra]] was the first philosopher-monk in the history of Indian philosophy who tried to use inference as a method to establish the existence of omniscience&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his famous work, ''[[Aptamimamsa]]'', Samantabhadra asserts:{{quote|Objects that are minute (like atoms), past (like Lord Rama), and distant (like Mount Meru), being the objects of inference (''anumeya'' – and, therefore, also objects of knowledge – ''prameya''), must be perceivable directly by someone; like the fire on the hill is an object of inference for a distant person but is perceived directly by the one who is in its proximity. The one who perceives directly the objects of knowledge that are minute, past, and distant is the Omniscient (''sarvajña''); this way the existence of the Omniscient is truly and firmly established.|Āptamīmāṁsā (5){{sfn|Jain|2016|p=10}}}}

[[Akalanka]] (c. 720 760 CE) put forward the concept of ''suniscita-asambhavad-badhaka-pramana'' as a reason for the existence of omniscience. This concept is a well-known fact which is "we have no valid methods of knowing to deny the existence of omniscience".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hemacandra]] (c. 1088 1173) combined Samantabhadra and Akalanka's ideas of ''sarvajña'' in his ''Pramanamimasa'' to establish the existence of omniscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jain epistemology==
{{Main article|Jain epistemology}}
In Jain epistemology, there are two kinds of valid methods of knowledge: ''pratyakṣa'' or "direct knowledge" and ''parokṣa'' or "indirect knowledge". Kevala-jñana is considered ''pratyaksa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five ways of obtaining knowledge are defined: ''matijñana'' acquired through sensory perception; ''srutajñana'' acquired through understanding of verbal and written sentences; ''avadhijñana'', ''manhaparyaya jñana'' and kevala jñana.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jains contrast all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with ''[[Anekantavada]]'', which can be explained through the parable of the "[[blind men and an elephant]]". In this story, each blind man felt a different part of an elephant (trunk, leg, ear, etc.). All the men claimed to understand and explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed, due to their limited perspectives.&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;{{cite book | title=The voice of Prophets | publisher=Lulu.com | last=Hughes | first=Marilynn | series=Volume 2 of 12 | year=2005 | location=Morrisville, North Carolina | pages=590–591 | isbn=1-4116-5121-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is more formally stated by observing that objects are infinite in their qualities and modes of existence, so they cannot be completely grasped in all aspects and manifestations by finite human perception. According to the Jains, only the ''Kevalis''—omniscient beings—can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations; others are only capable of partial knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Jaini | first=Padmanabh | year=1998 | location=New Delhi | pages=91 | isbn=81-208-1578-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, no single, specific, human view can claim to represent [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]].

==Stages of spiritual development==
{{Main article|Gunasthana}}
According to Jain texts, there are fourteen stages (''gunasthana'') of spiritual development. The soul can gradually frees itself, firstly from the worst, then from the less bad and finally from all kinds of karma, and manifests the innate qualities of knowledge, belief and conduct in a more and more perfect form. The first four ''gunasthana'' are related to belief or rationality in perception. As and when the soul acquires rationality in perception it moves on to 4th ''gunasthana''. Stages 5 to 14 relate to conduct. The purity in conduct determines the gunasthana from 5th stage onwards. Those who have taken the ''anuvratas'' {minor vows} may reach up to the 5th Gunasthana. The 6th to 14th Gunasthanas can only be attained by those who have taken the ''[[Mahavrata]]s'' (major vows) of [[Jain ascetic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|2001|pp=186–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following are the stages of spiritual development:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini1998|pp=272–273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tatia|1994|pp=274–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3308">The Swedish psychologist and university professor [[Heinz Leymann]] developed the '''LIPT''' questionnaire. LIPT stands for ''Leymann Inventory of Psychological Terror''.

== Structure ==
The '''LIPT''' questionnaire lists 45 [[mobbing]] actions at the workplace. A person is regarded as being [[Workplace bullying|bullied]] if one or more of the 45 actions happen at least once per week over a period of at least one year. Alternative mobbing definitions require a shorter period of at least 3–6 months and the frequent occurrence of more than one action.

The effects of the actions on the mobbing victim are divided into five categories:

# Effects on self-expression and communication, e.g., the mobbing victim is constantly interrupted, criticized, or yelled at.
# Effects on social contacts, e.g., colleagues and coworkers are forbidden to talk with the victim.
# Effects on personal reputation, e.g., unfounded rumors about the mobbing victim are circulated.
# Effects on occupational situation and quality of life, e.g., the victim is given meaningless jobs or tasks that affect the self-esteem.
# Effects on physical health, e.g., threats of physical violence, damage to the workplace, or outright sexual harassment.

== Completeness ==
The 45 mobbing actions are derived by Leymann from 300 individual interviews in the years of 1981 to 1984. After 1984 the interviews did not find further actions and ended.

[[File:6-crew-habitable-MAV-NASA-Mars-DRA-5-A2.png|thumb|Crewed Mars ascent vehicle from a DRA5 version]]

'''Mars orbit rendezvous''' ('''MOR''') is a space travel concept where two spacecraft meet up and/or dock in Mars orbit.&lt;ref name="portree2001"/&gt; For example, one vehicle takes off from Mars, such as a Martian ascent stage, and does a rendezvous in Mars orbit with another spacecraft.&lt;ref name="portree2001"/&gt; Applied to a [[Mars sample return]] or [[manned mission to Mars]], it allows much less weight to be sent to the surface and back into orbit, because the fuel needed to travel back to Earth is not landed on the planet.&lt;ref name="portree2001"&gt;
Page 8-9 in Chapter 2 of David S. F. Portree's ''Humans to Mars: Fifty Years of Mission Planning, 1950 - 2000,'' NASA Monographs in Aerospace History Series, Number 21, February 2001. Available as [https://history.nasa.gov/monograph21/humans_to_Mars.htm NASA SP-2001-4521].&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been proposed for unmanned [[Mars sample return]] plans.&lt;ref name=sd2000701&gt;
[http://www.spacedaily.com/news/mars-transport-00a.html Mars Sample Return: The Medium-Lift Approach], Morris Jones, Sydney - July 1, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Damario1999&gt;
[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999STIN...0057368D Mars Orbit Rendezvous Strategy for the Mars 2003/2005 Sample Return Mission], DAmario, Louis A.; Bollman, Willard E.; Lee, Wayne J.; Roncoli, Ralph B.; Smith, John C., Technical Report, ''[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]'', [[California Institute of Technology]], 1999-02, accessed 2010-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one mission proposal, MOR was planned for a Mars Descent-Ascent Vehicle (DAV) and Mars Transit Habitat, where a crew would transfer to the DAV after traveling to Mars on the habitat.&lt;ref name=price&gt;[http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/41431/1/09-3642.pdf Hoppy Price - Austere Human Missions to Mars (2009) - JPL]&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the Mars DAV to be launched separately from the transit habitat, and without any crew.&lt;ref name=price/&gt;

MOR is analogous to [[Lunar orbit rendezvous]] (LOR) used on the United States [[NASA]] [[Apollo program]] missions to Earth's moon during 1969 to 1972, as opposed to [[Earth orbit rendezvous]] (EOR) or [[Direct ascent]].&lt;ref name="portree2001"/&gt;

A related concept is a Mars flyby rendezvous, where spacecraft do not enter orbit but rendezvous near the planet.&lt;ref name="portree2001flyby"&gt;{{cite book|pages=15-16|chapter=Chapter 3: EMPIRE and After|first=David S.

&lt;!--
Another variation is that the ascent stage comes from one of the [[Mars moons]], in the case of an expedition to [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] or [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}--&gt;&lt;!-- is there a reliable secondary source for these two assertions? --&gt;

Mars orbit rendezvous was utilized in [[Austere Human Missions to Mars]], a tweak of DRA 5.0.

'''Mary V. Riley''' (December 24, 1908 – October 5, 1987) was an [[Apache]] tribal council member who was instrumental in the economic development of the [[White Mountain Apache]] Tribe. She was the first woman to be elected to serve on the tribal council and worked toward bringing timber and tourism industries to the reservation to ensure their economic stability. She was inducted into the [[Arizona Women's Hall of Fame]] posthumously in 1988.

==Early life==
Mary Velasquez was born on December 24, 1908{{#tag:ref|The 1916 Indian Census gives her birth date as December 20, 1908.{{sfn|U.S. Indian Census|1916|p=339}} (Note, this family reference on various census reports is R-24).{{sfn|U.S. Indian Census|1909|p=151}}|group="Notes"}} at Fort Apache, on the [[Fort Apache Indian Reservation|White Mountain Apache Reservation]]{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}} to Nalatzalay (Belle née Ivins) and Jesus Velasquez.{{sfn|U.S. Indian Census|1909|p=151}}{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}}{{sfn|Arizona Death Records|October 1, 1943}} Her father was born in [[Fort Davis, Texas]] to Mexican nationals from [[Coahuila]], Martín and Juana (née Rivers) Velasquez,{{sfn|Arizona Death Records|October 24, 1943}} and came to Fort Apache traveling with soldiers from Ft. Davis, as a child with his mother. He worked for a time as a translator and scout{{sfn|Richens|1977}}{{sfn|Cavanaugh|1960|p=1}} and then managed a ranch where he provided supplies to the soldiers at the fort.{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}} Her mother was a full-blood Apache and the daughter of Nadischaay.{{sfn|U.S. Indian Census|1909|p=151}} Velasquez and her siblings grew up on their father's farm, helping with farm chores. She attended three years of school, but was forced to leave in the [[1918 flu pandemic]] to help with sick relatives.{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}}

Though she was unable to return to school, Velasquez became fluent in three languages: [[Apache language|Apache]], Spanish, and English. She read newspapers widely.{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}}{{sfn|Adley-SantaMaria|1999|p=16}} Velasquez first married Kurt Johnson{{sfn|''The White Mountain Independent''|2012}} and then around 1936,{{sfn|White|1986|p=10}} married Peter Kessay Riley,{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1987|p=53}}{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1990|p=11}} with whom she raised her five children, all of whom were also trilingual, and to whom she stressed the importance of gaining an education.{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}}{{sfn|Adley-SantaMaria|1999|p=16}} She farmed as her father had, raising corn, potatoes, pumpkin and squash, as well as turkey, goat and sheep.{{sfn|White|1986|p=10}}

==Tribal career==
In 1958, Riley became the first woman elected to serve on the White Mountain Apache Tribal Council.{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}} She served on the health, education and welfare committee of the tribe and at various times, chaired the committee.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1960|p=15}}{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1963|p=8}} She made numerous trips to both the state capital, [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and federal capital in [[Washington, D. C.]], lobbying on behalf of the tribe.{{sfn|Cavanaugh|1960|p=1}}{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1985|p=256}} In an effort to improve situations for tribal members, she evaluated many programs for both economic and socio-cultural gains, looking at federal programs such as [[Job Corps]]{{sfn|MacEarian|1965|p=40}} the [[Boy Scouts of America]],{{sfn|''The Arizona Daily Sun''|1959|p=8}} and [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] loan programs for economic development. Riley represented three districts of the reservation{{sfn|Rolland|1972|p=26}} and was instrumental in projects, such as the Alchesay-Williams Creek National Fish Hatchery Complex, the Fort Apache Timber Company (FATCO), and the [[Sunrise Park Resort|Sunrise Park Ski Resort and Hotel]], among others, to expand the tribal enterprises and provide economic stability for the tribe.{{sfn|White|1986|p=10}}{{sfn|McDowell|1967|p=132}}{{sfn|Rolland|1972|p=26}}

Ground was broken for FATCO in 1962 and by 1963 had replaced the hiring of outside operators to manage the timber reserves of the tribe. By managing their own lumber harvests and operating three saw mills, the tribe was able to provide both jobs for tribal members and goods to sell to a wider clientele.{{sfn|Sheridan|Parezo|1996|p=89}}{{sfn|Cavanaugh|1962|p=12}} Around the same time, the Alchesay-Williams Hatchery was developed to stock the local lakes which had been created on the reservation and protect species listed as [[Threatened species|threatened]] or [[Endangered species|endangered]]. Employment opportunities for tribal members were increased through jobs at the hatchery, related jobs in the tourism sector, and additional revenues were garnered through the sale of fishing licenses.{{sfn|Behnke|2010|p=129}} One of the largest projects was to convert 1.6 million acres of their lands into the Sunrise Park Resort. Constructing 20 recreational lakes, campsites, fishing and hunting venues, a ski resort, and hotels, the Tribal Council utilized their lands to generate a year-round tourist industry.{{sfn|Rolland|1972|p=26}}{{sfn|McDowell|1967|p=132}}

Riley was interviewed as part of an [[Oral history preservation|Oral History Project]] sponsored by the Arizona State Department of Libraries and Archives in 1977.{{sfn|Richens|1977|p=1-2}} After twenty years on the council, Riley retired in 1978.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1985|p=256}} She was honored by the state in 1984 during the Statehood Day Celebrations for her leadership and development.{{sfn|''The Arizona Daily Star''|1984|p=14}} Profits from FATCO were used to build the Mary V. Riley Building, which houses the tribal educational department.{{sfn|Sheridan|Parezo|1996|p=89}}

==Death and legacy==
Riley died on October 5, 1987 at White Mountain River Indian Hospital in [[Whiteriver, Arizona]].{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1987|p=53}} Posthumously, she was inducted into the [[Arizona Women's Hall of Fame]], in 1988.{{sfn|Conner|1988|p=43}}

'''OmniGraffle''' is a diagramming and [[digital illustration]] application for [[macOS]] and [[iOS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.macstories.net/reviews/omnigraffle-30-brings-the-power-of-its-macos-counterpart-to-ios/|title=OmniGraffle 3.0 Brings the Power of Its macOS Counterpart to iOS|work=MacStories|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; created by [[The Omni Group]].

== Uses ==
OmniGraffle is used to create graphics and visuals. The application features several design tools, along with a [[drag-and-drop]] [[WYSIWYG]] interface and a notes function that to annotate and create specification documentation for [[prototypes]] and [[mockups]].

While OmniGraffle can produce graphics and visuals, it is often used as a tool to create content maps, screen flows, and wire frames. Visuals are often referred to as “graffles."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle|title=OmniGraffle - diagramming and graphic design for Mac, iPhone, and iPad - The Omni Group|work=omnigroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although OmniGraffle is an industry tool, it lacks interactivity capabilities and is not easily used for team collaboration due to its limitations as a desktop and tablet application. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Application Resources and Tools ==
OmniGraffle design tools include canvases, templates, stencils, vector drawing, and grid guides. Other features include auto layout and document management.

=== Canvases ===
Canvases are spaces where users can create shapes.  Attributes to creating a canvas include canvas name, sizing options, grid and dimension selections, and diagram layout. Users may create and also share canvases and layers, with automatic updates available. This gives users the option to create layers once, toggle layers to appear on desired canvases, and update automatically if changes occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.omnigroup.com/ipad/omnigraffle/CanvasInfo.html|title=Making Changes to the Canvas|work=omnigroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Templates ===
Templates are OmniGraffle application resources. Template documents can be manipulated by users for their purposes. Some sample templates are preloaded and available for users. Users may also create, edit, and save templates for creating consistent graffles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-wireframing-in-omnigraffle--webdesign-8840|title=A Beginner’s Guide to Wireframing in Omnigraffle|work=Web Design Tuts+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stencils ===
Stencils are OmniGraffle application resources. Stencils are clip art files that serve as elements, such as icons or buttons, for OmniGraffle documents. A wide variety of sample stencils are pre-loaded and available for immediate use. Users can also create, share, download, and preview stencils online as well through OmniGraffle's Stenciltown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stenciltown.omnigroup.com/|title=Stenciltown|work=omnigroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other stencil libraries, such as Graffletopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.graffletopia.com|title=Awesome OmniGraffle stencils - Graffletopia|work=graffletopia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vector Drawing ===
Because OmniGraffle visuals are vector-based, visuals are composed of mathematical representations of pixels. Rather than creating free-hand drawn work, users utilize vectors to create these visuals. To minimize user-end visual creation, vector drawing also allows for all graphic  images to be recreated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle|title=OmniGraffle - diagramming and graphic design for Mac, iPhone, and iPad - The Omni Group|work=omnigroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smart Guides ===
Smart Guides is a tool that can be turned on or off. While moving objects around the canvas, Smart Guides provides users with highlighted grid lines to easily align objects on the canvas. It also provides additional ease for users with a dynamic snap-to-grid functionality for accurately snapping objects into alignment around the canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://veerle-v2.duoh.com/blog/comments/be_smart_and_use_smart_guides/|title=Be smart and use Smart Guides - Veerle's blog|work=duoh.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extra Features ===
Other design features in the latest versions of OmniGraffle include  artistic fill and stroke styles, text and shape scalability, path-following text, shape combinations, diagram styling, auto layout features for treemapping, and documentation management.

== Import and Export ==
OmniGraffle supports filesharing and Visio support in its Pro distribution. All users can export their graffles to JPEG, BMP, EPS, GIF, HTML Images, [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], Template, Stencil, PNG, OO3, TIFF, and PDF &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Additionally, OmniGraffle Pro users can import [[Graphviz|dot/graphviz]], Visio, SVG, PDF, [[Photoshop]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omnigroup.com/blog/OmniGraffle_and_Photoshop_One_Great_Taste_and_One_Acceptable_Taste_that_Tas|title=OmniGraffle and Photoshop: One Great Taste and One Acceptable Taste that Taste Great Together|work=omnigroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with layers, and [[XCode]].

== Competition ==
In many respects, OmniGraffle is similar to [[Microsoft Visio]]. The Pro version of OmniGraffle can both import and export Visio files created using Visio's XML export function. However, Omnigraffle doesn't provide CAD integration like Visio, since it lacks some features such as DWG or DXF (AutoDesk file formats), import/export functions, among others. Also it is important to notice that layers cannot be shared among some versions of Visio and OmniGraffle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Diagram]]s, content or [[mind map]]s, [[flowchart]]s and [[Wire-frame model|wire frame]]s can also be drawn with other [[Comparison of vector graphics editors|applications]]

'''Oscar Tuazon''' (née Hansen) is an American artist based in Los Angeles who works in sculpture, architecture, and mixed media.

==Early life==
Oscar Tuazon was born Oscar Hansen on July 9, 1975, in a geodesic dome his parents built in the woods at Indianola, [[Kitsap County, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historylink.org/File/10987&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Deep Springs College]], [[Cooper Union]], and the Whitney Independent Study Program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/how-do-i-look-oscar-tuazon-artist-35-2008449.html How do I look?: Oscar Tuazon, artist, 35, [[The Independent]], June 26, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 he served as a founding board member at the [[Center for Urban Pedagogy]] in New York with his former Deep Springs classmate [[Damon Rich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://welcometocup.org/People Center for Urban Pedagogy: People, Accessed April 18, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bombmagazine.org/article/5529/city-without-a-ghetto-center-for-urban-pedagogy "City Without a Ghetto, Center for Urban Pedagogy", Bomb Magazine Spring 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oscar met and married Lan Tuazon in New York in the mid-90s and changed his name from Oscar Hansen to Oscar Tuazon. The couple would later be divorced, but he kept the last name.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historylink.org/File/10987&lt;/ref&gt; His brother and frequent collaborator, Eli Hansen, is also an artist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/article/When-brothers-Eli-Hansen-and-Oscar-Tuazon-deliver-1271392.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parcsaintleger.fr/en/portfolio/oscar-tuazon-eli-hansen/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Professionally, he began his career working in the Studio Acconci of architect/artist [[Vito Acconci]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jul/28/artist-week-oscar-tuazon "Artist of the week 98: Oscar Tuazon," The Guardian, July 26, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to Paris in 2007, he began exhibiting widely in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vogue.fr/culture/agenda/articles/rencontre-avec-oscar-tuazon-la-biennale-de-venise-/19265 "Rencontre avec Oscar Tuazon à la Biennale de Venise," Paris Vogue]&lt;/ref&gt; He has since then exhibited at the [[Venice Biennale]], the [[Whitney Biennial]], and many group and solo shows throughout the world, and is in major art collections such as Saatchi's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/the-first-artists-on-the-waterfront/Content?oid=19141739 " The First Artists on the Waterfront," The Stranger, March 26, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2012Biennial/OscarTuazon 2012 Whitney Biennial Exhibitions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418142536/http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2012Biennial/OscarTuazon |date=2015-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A critic in the art magazine [[Frieze]] wrote in 2013 that "like his heroes, from [[Gordon Matta-Clark]] to wilderness survivalists, Tuazon’s non-conformist approach to artistic practice plays at the juncture of architecture, sculpture and performance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/oscar-tuazon/ "Oscar Tuazon," Frieze, April 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[New York Times]] review described his work as "haunting ... pit[ting] Mr. Acconci's robust ego against Mr. Tuazon's raw and fragile subjectivity." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/arts/design/16galleries-005.html "Oscar Tuazon: ‘My Flesh to Your Bare Bones’," New York Times, April 16, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2013, he moved from France to the [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]] neighborhood of Los Angeles with his three children and wife Dorothée Perret, a former editor at [[Purple (magazine)|Purple Magazine]] who now helms the art magazine "Paris, LA."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmagazine.com/people/2013/11/dorothee-perret/ "Dorothée Perret: Saint Laurent designer Hedi Slimane isn’t the only French expat to put down roots in Los Angeles," W Magazine, November 21, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sightunseen.com/2012/01/oscar-tuazon-artist-and-dorothee-perret-editor-2/ "At Home With Oscar Tuazon, artist, and Dorothée Perret, editor," Sight Unseen, January 25, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psychic damage''' is a concept used in the field of [[social psychology]] to describe the negative effects of [[stereotypes]] on individual members of [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] groups. The label "psychic damage" was first used by U.S. historian [[Daryl Scott (historian)|Daryl Scott]] to describe the effects of stereotyping on [[African-Americans]] in his 1997 book ''Contempt and Pity: Social Policy and the Image of the Damaged Black Psyche, 1880–1996'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Whistling Vivaldi: How Stereotypes Affect Us and What We Can Do (Issues of Our Time)|last = Steele|first = Claude M.|publisher = W.

In his book ''[[Claude Steele#Whistling Vivaldi|Whistling Vivaldi: How Stereotypes Affect Us and What We Can Do]],'' U.S. social psychologist Claude Steele wrote that the psyches of individual African-Americans gets damaged "by bad images of the group projected in society -- images of blacks as aggressive, as less intelligent, and so on." Repeated exposure to these images, he wrote, is [[Internalization|internalized]] by members of the stigmatized group, which damages their character by causing low self-esteem, low expectations, low motivation and self-doubt, and contributes to societal problems such as high [[unemployment]], poor marriage success, low educational achievement and [[criminality]].

Initially the concept of psychic damage was used to describe the effects of stigmatization on African-Americans, but the concept has also been applied to other stigmatized groups, such as [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.law.ou.edu/content/american-indian-law-review-2|title = |last = |first = |date = 2003|journal = American Indian Law Review |volume=28|accessdate = 29 November 2014|doi = |pmid = |page = 81}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino people]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Bust Guide to the New Girl Order|last = Karp|first = Marcelle|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Feminists Doing Ethics|last = DesAutels|first = Peggy|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''punishment''' is the imposition of an undesirable or [[unpleasant]] outcome upon a group or individual, meted out by an [[authority]]—in contexts ranging from [[child discipline]] to [[criminal law]]—as a response and deterrent to a particular action or [[behavior|behaviour]] that is deemed undesirable or unacceptable. The reasoning may be to condition a child to avoid self-endangerment, to impose social [[conformity]] (in particular, in the contexts of [[compulsory education]] or [[military discipline]]), to defend [[norm (social)|norm]]s, to protect against future harms (in particular, those from [[violent crime]]), and to maintain the [[law]]—and respect for [[rule of law]]—under which the social group is governed.&lt;ref name=stanford-crimeState&gt;

 | quote =Punishment describes the imposition by some authority of a deprivation—usually painful—on a person who has violated a law, rule, or other norm. When the violation is of the criminal law of society there is a formal process of accusation and proof followed by imposition of a sentence by a designated official, usually a judge. Informally, any organized group—most typically the family, in rearing children—may punish perceived wrongdoers.

 |quote=Punishment under law... is the authorized imposition of deprivations—of freedom or privacy or other goods to which the person otherwise has a right, or the imposition of special burdens—because the person has been found guilty of some criminal violation, typically (though not invariably) involving harm to the innocent. (The classical formulation, conspicuous in Hobbes, for example, defines punishment by reference to imposing pain rather than to deprivations.) This definition, although imperfect because of its brevity, does allow us to bring out several essential points.&lt;!-- author does not seem to present his own def--&gt;}}

 |quote=Punishment... involves the intentional infliction of pain or of something unpleasant on someone who has committed a breach of rules... by someone who is in authority, who has a right to act in this way. Otherwise, it would be impossible to distinguish 'punishment' from 'revenge'. People in authority can, of course, inflict pain on people at whim. But this would be called 'spite' unless it were inflicted as a consequence of a breach of rules on the part of the sufferer. Similarly a person in authority might give a person £5 as a consequence of his breaking a rule. But unless this were regarded as painful or at least unpleasant for the recipient it could not be counted as a case of 'punishment'. In other words at least three criteria of (i) intentional infliction of pain (ii) by someone in authority (iii) on a person as a consequence of a breach of rules on his part, must be satisfied if we are to call something a case of 'punishment'. There are, as is usual in such cases, examples that can be produced which do not satisfy all criteria. For instance there is a colloquialism which is used about boxers taking a lot of punishment from their opponents, in which only the first condition is present. But this is a metaphorical use which is peripheral to the central use of the term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In so far as the different 'theories' of punishment are answers to questions about the meaning of 'punishment', only the retributive theory is a possible one. There is no conceptual connection between 'punishment' and notions like those of 'deterrence', 'prevention' and 'reform'. For people can be punished without being prevented from repeating the offence, and without being made any better. It is also a further question whether they themselves or anyone else is deterred from committing the offence by punishment. But 'punishment' ''must'' involve 'retribution', for 'retribution' implies doing something to someone in return for what he has done.... Punishment, therefore, must be retributive—by definition.}}

&lt;/ref&gt;  Punishment may be self-inflicted as with [[self-flagellation]] and [[mortification of the flesh]] in the religious setting, but is most often a form of social [[coercion]]. 

The unpleasant imposition may include a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]], [[Sanctions (law)|penalty]], or [[Imprisonment|confinement]], or be the removal or denial of something pleasant or desirable.  The individual may be a person, or even an animal. The authority may be either a group or a single person, and punishment may be carried out formally under a system of [[law]] or informally in other kinds of social settings such as within a family.&lt;ref name=punGR /&gt; Negative consequences that are not authorized or that are administered without a breach of rules are not considered to be punishment as defined here.&lt;ref name=Peters1966 /&gt; The study and practice of the punishment of [[crime]]s, particularly as it applies to imprisonment, is called [[penology]], or, often in modern texts, [[corrections]]; in this context, the punishment process is euphemistically called "correctional process".&lt;ref name="StohrWalsh2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Stohr|author2=Anthony Walsh|author3=Craig Hemmens|title=Corrections: A Text/Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LDcB7-EVi0cC&amp;pg=PA2|year=2008|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-3773-3|page=2}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Research into punishment often includes similar research into prevention.

Justifications for punishment include [[Retributive justice|retribution]], [[Deterrence (legal)|deterrence]], [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]], and [[incapacitation (penology)|incapacitation]]. The last could include such measures as isolation, in order to prevent the wrongdoer's having contact with potential victims, or the removal of a hand in order to make theft more difficult.&lt;ref name=justify&gt;

 | quote =Because punishment is both painful and guilt producing, its application calls for a justification. In Western culture, four basic justifications have been given: retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, and incapacitation.

&lt;/ref&gt; Of the four justifications, only retribution is part of the definition of punishment and none of the other justifications is a guaranteed outcome, aside from obvious exceptions such as an executed man being incapacitated with regard to further crimes.&lt;ref name=Peters1966 /&gt;

If only some of the conditions included in the definition of punishment are present, descriptions other than "punishment" may be considered more accurate. Inflicting something negative, or unpleasant, on a person or animal, without authority is considered [[revenge]] or [[spite]] rather than punishment.&lt;ref name=Peters1966/&gt; In addition, the word "punishment" is used as a metaphor, as when a boxer experiences "''punishment''" during a fight. In other situations, breaking a rule may be rewarded, and so receiving such a reward naturally does not constitute punishment. Finally the condition of breaking (or breaching) the rules must be satisfied for consequences to be considered punishment.&lt;ref name=Peters1966/&gt;

Punishments differ in their degree of severity, and may include [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]] such as [[reprimands]], deprivations of privileges or [[liberty]], fines, [[incarceration]]s, [[ostracism]], the infliction of [[pain]], [[amputation]] and the [[death penalty]].
''[[Corporal punishment]]'' refers to punishments in which physical pain is intended to be inflicted upon the transgressor.&lt;!-- some people have no pain receptors--&gt;
Punishments may be judged as fair or unfair in terms of their degree of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]] and [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]]&lt;ref name=stanford-theoryOf /&gt; to the offense.
Punishment can be an integral part of socialization, and punishing unwanted behaviour is often part of a system of [[pedagogy]] or behavioral modification which also includes rewards.&lt;ref name=sociologytimes&gt;{{cite book|title=Sociology in Our Times: The Essentials

===In philosophy===
Various philosophers have presented definitions of punishment.&lt;ref name=stanford-crimeState/&gt;&lt;ref name=punGR/&gt;&lt;ref name=stanford-theoryOf/&gt;&lt;ref name=Peters1966/&gt;&lt;ref name=j-kleining/&gt; Conditions commonly considered necessary properly to describe an action as punishment are that 
# it is imposed by an authority, 
# it involves some loss to the supposed offender, 
# it is in response to an offence and 
# the person (or animal) to whom the loss is imposed should be deemed at least somewhat responsible for the offence.

===In psychology===
{{Main article|Punishment (psychology)}}
Introduced by [[B.F. Skinner]], punishment has a more restrictive and technical definition.  Along with [[reinforcement]] it belongs under the [[operant conditioning]] category.  Operant conditioning refers to learning with either punishment (often confused as negative reinforcement) or a reward that serves as a positive reinforcement of the lesson to be learned. In psychology, punishment is the reduction of a behavior via application of an unpleasant stimulus ("''positive'' punishment") or removal of a pleasant stimulus ("''negative'' punishment"). Extra chores or [[spanking]] are examples of positive punishment, while removing an offending student's recess or play privileges are examples of negative punishment. The definition requires that punishment is only determined after the fact by the reduction in behavior; if the offending behavior of the subject does not decrease, it is not considered punishment.  There is some [[conflation]] of punishment and [[aversives]], though an aversion that does not decrease behavior is not considered punishment in psychology. Additionally, "aversive stimulus" is a label behaviorists generally apply to negative reinforcers (as in avoidance learning), rather than punishers.

===In socio-biology===
Punishment is sometimes called ''[[revenge|retaliatory]]'' or ''[[moralistic aggression]]'';{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason= 1. Why the focus on cheating? 2. Links seem to lead to unexpected articles - moralistic aggression redirects to [[Reciprocal altruism]], which does NOT seem to be the same thing.

Does source say CHEATING and punishment for CHEATING has been observed in ALL social animals? 3. Does source establish what counts as cheating among all social animals?}} species of [[social animal]]s, leading evolutionary biologists to conclude that it is an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]], selected because it favors [[cooperation|cooperative behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Stohr|author2=Anthony Walsh|author3=Craig Hemmens|title=Corrections: A Text/Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LDcB7-EVi0cC&amp;pg=PA3|year=2008|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-3773-3|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples against sociobiological use====
One criticism of the claim of all social animals being evolutionarily hardwired for punishment comes from studies of animals, such as the [[octopus]]es near [[Capri]], Italy that suddenly formed communal cultures from having, until then lived solitary lives.  During a period of heavy fishing and tourism that encroached on their territory, they started to live in groups, learning from each other, especially hunting techniques.  Small, younger octopuses could be near the fully grown octopuses without being eaten by them, even though they, like other Octopus vulgaris, were [[cannibalism|cannibals]] until just before the group formation{{Citation needed|reason=The source paper is missing and can not be found with a cursory google search|date=February 2017}}. The authors stress that this behavior change happened too fast to be a genetic characteristic in the octopuses, and that there were certainly no mammals or other "naturally" social animals punishing octopuses for cannibalism involved. The authors also note that the octopuses adopted [[observational learning]] without any [[evolution]]ary history of specialized adaptation for it.&lt;ref&gt;"Observational Learning in Octopus vulgaris." Graziano Fiorito, Pietro Scotto. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aliens of the deep sea, documentary. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also arguments against the notion of punishment requiring intelligence, based on studies of punishment in very small-brained animals such as [[insect]]s. There is proof of [[honey bee]] workers with mutations that makes them fertile laying eggs only when other honey bees are not observing them, and that the few that are caught in the act are killed{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}. This is corroborated by [[computer simulation]]s proving that a few simple reactions well within mainstream views of the extremely limited intelligence of insects are sufficient to emulate the "political" behavior observed in [[great ape]]s. The authors argue that this [[falsifiability|falsifies]] the claim that punishment evolved as a strategy to deal with individuals capable of knowing what they are doing.&lt;ref&gt;How the Body Shapes the Way We Think: A New View of Intelligence, Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard, foreword by Rodney Brooks. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of more complex brains, the notion of evolution selecting for specific punishment of intentionally chosen breaches of rules and/or wrongdoers capable of intentional choices (for example, punishing [[human]]s for murder while not punishing lethal [[virus]]es) is subject to criticism from [[coevolution]] issues. That punishment of individuals with certain characteristics (including but, in principle, not restricted to mental abilities) selects against those characteristics, making evolution of any mental abilities considered to be the basis for penal responsibility impossible in populations subject to such selective punishment. Certain scientists argue that this disproves the notion of humans having a biological feeling of intentional transgressions deserving to be punished.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche (1886) Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Elizabeth, et al. (1975). "Against 'Sociobiology'". [letter] New York Review of Books 22 (Nov. 13).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1979). Twelve misunderstandings of kin selection&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of application==
Punishments are applied for various purposes, most generally, to encourage and enforce proper behavior as defined by society or family. [[Criminal]]s are punished judicially, by [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], [[corporal punishment]] or [[custodial sentence]]s such as [[prison]]; detainees risk further punishments for breaches of internal rules. [[Child]]ren, pupils and other trainees may be punished by their educators or instructors (mainly [[parent]]s, [[legal guardian|guardian]]s, or [[teacher]]s, tutors and [[coach (sport)|coach]]es) – see [[Child discipline]].

[[Slaves]], domestic and other servants are subject to punishment by their [[Slave master|masters]]. Employees can still be subject to a contractual form of fine or [[demotion]]. Most hierarchical organizations, such as military and police forces, or even churches, still apply quite rigid internal discipline, even with a judicial system of their own ([[court martial]], [[canonical court]]s).

Punishment may also be applied on moral, especially religious, grounds, as in [[penance]] (which is voluntary) or imposed in a [[theocracy]] with a religious police (as in a strict [[Islamic state]] like [[Iran]] or under the [[Taliban]]) or (though not a true theocracy) by [[Inquisition]].

==Hell as punishment==
Belief that an individual's ultimate punishment is being sent by God, the highest authority, to an existence in Hell, a place believed to exist in the after-life, typically corresponds to [[sin]]s committed during their life. Sometimes these distinctions are specific, with [[Damnation#Christianity|damned souls]] suffering for each sin committed (see for example Plato's [[myth of Er]] or Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]]''), but sometimes they are general, with condemned sinners relegated to one or more chamber of Hell or to a level of suffering.

In many religious cultures, including Christianity and Islam, Hell is traditionally depicted as fiery and painful, inflicting guilt and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Numerous verses in the Qu'ran and New Testament.&lt;/ref&gt;{{specify|date=January 2011}} Despite these common depictions of Hell as a place of fire, some other traditions portray Hell as cold. Buddhist – and particularly Tibetan Buddhist – descriptions of hell feature an equal number of hot and cold hells. Among Christian descriptions [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' portrays the innermost (9th) circle of Hell as a frozen lake of blood and guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

But cold also played a part in earlier Christian depictions of hell, beginning with the [[Apocalypse of Paul]], originally from the early third century;&lt;ref&gt;Eileen Gardiner, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/visions-of-heaven-and-hell-before-dante/oclc/18741120 ''Visions of Heaven and Hell Before Dante''] (New York, Italica Press, 1989), p. 43.

==History and rationale==

=== Seriousness of a crime; Punishment fits the crime ===
{{main article|Retributive justice|Eye for an eye}}
{{see also|Felony|Misdemeanor}}
A principle often mentioned with respect to the degree of punishment to be meted out is that the punishment should match the crime.&lt;ref&gt;''Doing Justice – The Choice of Punishments'', A VONHIRSCH'', 1976, p. 220
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
''Criminology'', Larry J. Siegel
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1372651 An Economic Analysis of the Criminal Law as Preference-Shaping Policy], Duke Law Journal, Feb 1990, Vol. 1, Kenneth Dau-Schmidt
&lt;/ref&gt;
One standard for measurement is the degree to which a crime affects others or society. Measurements of the [[degree of seriousness]] of a crime have been developed.&lt;ref name=OSS&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynch | first1 = James P. | last2 = Danner | first2 = Mona J.

A [[felony]] is generally considered to be a crime of "high [[seriousness]]", while a [[misdemeanor]] is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dagger|first=Richard|date=April 1993|title=Playing Fair with Punishment|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2381750?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=The University Chicago Press|volume=103|pages=473-488|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible reasons for punishment==
{{See also|Criminal justice}}
There are many possible reasons that might be given to justify or explain why someone ought to be punished; here follows a broad outline of typical, possibly conflicting, justifications.

=== Deterrence (prevention) ===
One reason given to justify punishment&lt;ref name=justify/&gt; is that it is a measure to prevent people from committing an offence - deterring previous offenders from re-offending, and preventing those who may be contemplating an offence they have not committed from actually committing it.  This punishment is intended to be sufficient that people would choose not to commit the crime rather than experience the punishment.  The aim is to deter everyone in the community from committing offences.

Some criminologists state that the number of people convicted for crime does not decrease as a result of more severe punishment and conclude that deterrence is ineffective.&lt;ref&gt; reference | J. Mitchell Miller | 2009 | 21st Century Criminology: A Reference Handbook &lt;/ref&gt; Other criminologists object to said conclusion, citing that while most people do not know the exact severity of punishment such as whether the sentence for murder is 40 years or life, most people still know the rough outlines such as the punishments for armed robbery or statutory rape being more severe than the punishments for driving too fast or misparking a car. These criminologists therefore argue that lack of deterring effect of increasing the sentences for already severely punished crimes say nothing about the significance of the existence of punishment as a deterring factor.&lt;ref&gt; reference | Gennaro F. Vito, Jeffrey R. Maahs | 2015 | Criminology &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; reference | Frank E. Hagan | 2010 | Introduction to Criminology: Theories, Methods, and Criminal Behavior &lt;/ref&gt;

Some criminologists argue that increasing the sentences for crimes can cause criminal investigators to give higher priority to said crimes so that a higher percentage of those committing them are convicted for them, causing statistics to give a false appearance of such crimes increasing. These criminologists argue that the use of statistics to gauge the efficiency of crime fighting methods are a danger of creating a reward hack that makes the least efficient criminal justice systems appear to be best at fighting crime, and that the appearance of deterrance being ineffective may be an example of this.&lt;ref&gt; reference | Anthony Walsh, Craig Hemmens | 2008 | Introduction to Criminology: A Text/Reader &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; reference | Ronald L. Akers | 2013 | Criminological Theories: Introduction and Evaluation &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rehabilitation ===
{{Main article|Rehabilitation (penology)}}
Some punishment includes work to reform and [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitate]] the culprit so that they will not commit the offence again.&lt;ref name=justify/&gt; This is distinguished from deterrence, in that the goal here is to change the offender's attitude to what they have done, and make them come to see that their behavior was wrong.

=== Incapacitation and societal protection ===
Incapacitation as a justification of punishment&lt;ref name=justify/&gt; refers to the offender’s ability to commit further offences being removed. Imprisonment separates offenders from the community, removing or reducing their ability to carry out certain crimes. The death penalty does this in a permanent (and irrevocable) way. In some societies, people who stole have been punished by having their hands amputated.

=== Retribution ===
{{Main article|Retributive justice}}
Criminal activities typically give a benefit to the offender and a loss to the victim. Punishment has been justified as a measure of [[retributive justice]],&lt;ref name=justify/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falls|first=Margaret|date=1987|title=Retribution, Reciprocity, and Respect for Persons|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3504678?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=Law and Philosophy|volume=6|pages=25-51|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;in which the goal is to try to rebalance any unjust advantage gained by ensuring that the offender also suffers a loss. Sometimes viewed as a way of "getting even" with a wrongdoer—the suffering of the wrongdoer is seen as a desired goal in itself, even if it has no restorative benefits for the victim. One reason [[society|societies]] have administered punishments is to diminish the perceived need for retaliatory "street justice", [[blood feud]], and [[vigilante|vigilantism]].

=== Restoration ===
{{Main article|Restorative justice}}
For minor offenses, punishment may take the form of the offender "righting the wrong", or making restitution to the victim. [[Community service]] or compensation orders are examples of this sort of penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-articles.org.uk/libertarian_restitution.htm |title=restitution |publisher=La-articles.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In models of [[restorative justice]], victims take an ''active'' role in a process with their offenders who are encouraged to take responsibility for their actions, "to repair the harm they've done – by apologizing, returning stolen money, or community service."&lt;ref&gt;"A New Kind of Criminal Justice", ''Parade'', October 25, 2009, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  The restorative justice approach aims to help the offender want to avoid future offences.

=== Education and denunciation ===
[[File:Schwaebisch Hall pillory.jpg|thumb|upright|Gothic [[pillory]] (early 16th century) in [[Schwäbisch Hall]], Germany]]
Punishment can be explained by positive prevention theory to use the criminal justice system to teach people what are the social norms for what is correct, and acts as a reinforcement.

Punishment can serve as a means for society to publicly express denunciation of an action as being criminal. Besides educating people regarding what is not acceptable behavior, it serves the dual function of preventing vigilante justice by acknowledging public anger, while concurrently deterring future criminal activity by stigmatizing the offender.
This is sometimes called the "Expressive Theory" of denunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/crim/crim01.htm |title=Theory, Sources, and Limitations of Criminal Law |accessdate=2011-09-26}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[pillory]] was a method for carrying out public denunciation.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  | title =Theories Of Punishment
  | quote =Theories of punishment can be divided into two general philosophies: utilitarian and retributive.
  | publisher =Free Legal Encyclopedia
  | accessdate =2011-09-26
  | url =http://law.jrank.org/pages/9576/Punishment-THEORIES-PUNISHMENT.html
  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics of the education and denunciation model cite [[evolution]]ary problems with the notion that a feeling for punishment as a social signal system evolved if punishment was not effective. The critics argue that some individuals spending time and energy and taking risks in punishing others, and the possible loss of the punished group members, would have been selected against if punishment served no function other than signals that could evolve to work by less risky means.&lt;ref&gt; reference | J. Robert Lilly, Francis T. Cullen, Richard A. Ball | 2014 | Criminological Theory: Context and Consequences &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; reference | Tim Newburn | 2017 | Criminology &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unified theory ===
A unified theory of punishment brings together multiple penal purposes — such as retribution, deterrence and rehabilitation — in a single, coherent framework. Instead of punishment requiring we choose between them, unified theorists argue that they work together as part of some wider goal such as the protection of rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195396577/obo-9780195396577-0094.xml |title=Thom Brooks on Unified Theory of Punishment |date= |accessdate=2014-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some people think that punishment as a whole is unhelpful and even harmful to the people that it is used against. Detractors argue that punishment is simply wrong, of the same design as "[[two wrongs make a right]]". Critics argue that punishment is simply [[revenge]]. Professor Deirdre Golash, [[author]] of the book, ''The Case against Punishment: Retribution, Crime Prevention, and the Law'', states in her book that,
{{quote|We ought not to impose such harm on anyone unless we have a very good reason for doing so. This remark may seem trivially true, but the history of humankind is littered with examples of the deliberate infliction of harm by well-intentioned persons in the vain pursuit of ends which that harm did not further, or in the successful pursuit of questionable ends. These benefactors of humanity sacrificed their fellows to appease mythical gods and tortured them to save their souls from a mythical hell, broke and bound the feet of children to promote their eventual marriageability, beat slow schoolchildren to promote learning and respect for teachers, subjected the sick to leeches to rid them of excess blood, and put suspects to the rack and the thumbscrew in the service of truth. They schooled themselves to feel no pity—to renounce human compassion in the service of a higher end. The deliberate doing of harm in the mistaken belief that it promotes some greater good is the essence of tragedy. We would do well to ask whether the goods we seek in harming offenders are worthwhile, and whether the means we choose will indeed secure them.&lt;ref name="golash"&gt;https://www.questia.com/read/117883311/the-case-against-punishment-retribution-crime-prevention&lt;/ref&gt;}} Golash also makes statements about [[imprisonment]], {{quote|Imprisonment means, at minimum, the loss of liberty and autonomy, as well as many material comforts, personal security, and access to heterosexual relations. These deprivations, according to Gresham Sykes (who first identified them) “together dealt 'a profound hurt' that went to 'the very foundations of the prisoner's being.}} {{quote|But these are only the minimum harms, suffered by the least vulnerable inmates in the best-run prisons. Most prisons are run badly, and in some, conditions are more squalid than in the worst of slums. In the District of Columbia jail, for example, inmates must wash their clothes and sheets in cell toilets because the laundry machines are broken. Vermin and insects infest the building, in which air vents are clogged with decades' accumulation of dust and grime. But even inmates in prisons where conditions are sanitary must still face the numbing boredom and emptiness of prison life—a vast desert of wasted days in which little in the way of meaningful activity is possible.&lt;ref name="golash" /&gt;}}

=== Destructiveness to thinking and betterment ===
There are critics of punishment who argue that punishment aimed at intentional actions forces people to suppress their ability to act on intent. Advocates of this viewpoint argue that such suppression of intention causes the harmful behaviors to remain, making punishment counterproductive. These people suggest that the ability to make intentional choices should instead be treasured as a source of possibilities of betterment, citing that complex cognition would have been an evolutionarily useless waste of energy if it led to justifications of fixed actions and no change as simple inability to understand arguments would have been the most thrifty protection from being misled by them if arguments were for social manipulation, and reject condemnation of people who intentionally did bad things.&lt;ref&gt;Mind, Brain and Education, Kurt Fischer, Christina Hinton&lt;/ref&gt; Punishment can be effective in stopping undesirable employee behaviors such as tardiness, absenteeism or substandard work performance. However, punishment does not necessarily cause an employee to demonstrate a desirable behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/stories/1996/11/18/focus3.html|title=Punishment in the workplace creates undesirable side effects|last=Milbourn Jr|first=Gene|date=November 1996|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 21 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PC-Netzteil (redundant).jpg|thumb|Redundant power supply]]
[[File:Reliability block diagram.png|thumb|Redundant subsystem "B"]]

In [[engineering]], '''redundancy''' is the duplication of critical [[wikt:component|component]]s or functions of a system with the intention of increasing reliability of the [[system]], usually in the form of a backup or [[fail-safe]], or to improve actual system performance, such as in the case of [[GNSS]] receivers, or [[multi-threaded]] computer processing.

In many [[safety-critical system]]s, such as [[fly-by-wire]] and [[hydraulic]] systems in [[aircraft]], some parts of the control system may be triplicated,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/201/ibmrd2001E.pdf Redundancy Management Technique for Space Shuttle Computers] (PDF), IBM Research&lt;/ref&gt; which is formally termed [[triple modular redundancy]] (TMR). An error in one component may then be out-voted by the other two. In a triply redundant system, the system has three sub components, all three of which must fail before the system fails. Since each one rarely fails, and the sub components are expected to fail independently, the probability of all three failing is calculated to be extraordinarily small; often outweighed by other risk factors, such as [[human error]]. Redundancy may also be known by the terms "majority voting systems"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/ArticleID/6886/6886.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303033411/http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/ArticleID/6886/6886.html |title=Analog Voting Circuit Is More Flexible Than Its Digital Version |author=R.

[[File:Bridge-suspension.svg|thumb|A [[suspension bridge|suspension bridge's]] numerous cables are a form of redundancy.]]

Redundancy sometimes produces less, instead of greater reliability{{snd}} it creates a more complex system which is prone to various issues, it may lead to human neglect of duty, and may lead to higher production demands which by overstressing the system may make it less safe.&lt;ref name=perr2004&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/20276/sagan_oe_dec03.pdf |title=Learning from Normal Accidents |author=Scott D.

== Forms of redundancy ==
In computer science, there are four major forms of redundancy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koren|first1=Israel|last2=Krishna|first2=C. Mani|title=Fault-Tolerant Systems|date=2007|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=0-12-088525-5|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are:
* Hardware redundancy, such as [[dual modular redundancy]] and [[triple modular redundancy]]
* Information redundancy, such as [[error detection and correction]] methods
* Time redundancy, performing the same operation multiple times such as multiple executions of a program or multiple copies of data transmitted
* Software redundancy such as [[N-version programming]]

A modified form of software redundancy, applied to hardware may be:

* Distinct functional redundancy, such as both mechanical and hydraulic braking in a car.  Applied in the case of software, code written independently and distinctly different but producing the same results for the same inputs.
[[Structures]] are usually designed with redundant parts as well, ensuring that if one part fails, the entire structure will not collapse. A structure without redundancy is called [[Fracture critical|fracture-critical]], meaning that a single broken component can cause the collapse of the entire structure. Bridges that failed due to lack of redundancy include the [[Silver Bridge]] and the [[Skagit River Bridge|Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River]].

[[File:Series-Parallel-Systems-Examples.jpg|thumb|Series (A) and parallel (B) systems and their combination (C).&lt;ref&gt;Kokcharov I. Structural Safety http://www.kokch.kts.ru/me/t6/SIA_6_Structural_Safety.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Parallel and combined systems demonstrate different level of redundancy. The models are subject of studies in reliability and safety engineering.

== Function of redundancy ==
The two functions of redundancy are passive redundancy and [[active redundancy]]. Both functions prevent performance decline from exceeding specification limits without human intervention using extra capacity.

Passive redundancy uses excess capacity to reduce the impact of component failures. One common form of passive redundancy is the extra strength of cabling and struts used in bridges. This extra strength allows some structural components to fail without bridge collapse. The extra strength used in the design is called the margin of safety.

Eyes and ears provide working examples of passive redundancy. Vision loss in one eye does not cause blindness but depth perception is impaired. Hearing loss in one ear does not cause deafness but directionality is impaired. Performance decline is commonly associated with passive redundancy when a limited number of failures occur.

Active redundancy eliminates performance declines by monitoring the performance of individual devices, and this monitoring is used in voting logic. The voting logic is linked to switching that automatically reconfigures the components. Error detection and correction and the Global Positioning System (GPS) are two examples of active redundancy.

Electrical power distribution provides an example of active redundancy. Several power lines connect each generation facility with customers. Each power line includes monitors that detect overload. Each power line also includes circuit breakers. The combination of power lines provides excess capacity. Circuit breakers disconnect a power line when monitors detect an overload. Power is redistributed across the remaining lines.

==Disadvantages==
[[Charles Perrow]], author of ''[[Normal Accidents]]'', has said that sometimes redundancies backfire and produce less, not more reliability. This may happen in three ways: First, redundant safety devices result in a more complex system, more prone to errors and accidents. Second, redundancy may lead to shirking of responsibility among workers. Third, redundancy may lead to increased production pressures, resulting in a system that operates at higher speeds, but less safely.&lt;ref name=perr2004/&gt;

== Voting logic ==
Voting logic uses performance monitoring to determine how to reconfigure individual components so that operation continues without violating specification limitations of the overall system. Voting logic often involves computers, but systems composed of items other than computers may be reconfigured using voting logic. Circuit breakers are an example of a form of non-computer voting logic.

Electrical power systems use [[power scheduling]] to reconfigure active redundancy. Computing systems adjust the production output of each generating facility when other generating facilities are suddenly lost. This prevents blackout conditions during major events such as an earthquake.

The simplest voting logic in computing systems involves two components: primary and alternate. They both run similar software, but the output from the alternate remains inactive during normal operation. The primary monitors itself and periodically sends an activity message to the alternate as long as everything is OK. All outputs from the primary stop, including the activity message, when the primary detects a fault. The alternate activates its output and takes over from the primary after a brief delay when the activity message ceases. Errors in voting logic can cause both outputs to be active or inactive at the same time, or cause outputs to flutter on and off.

A more reliable form of voting logic involves an odd number of three devices or more. All perform identical functions and the outputs are compared by the voting logic. The voting logic establishes a majority when there is a disagreement, and the majority will act to deactivate the output from other device(s) that disagree. A single fault will not interrupt normal operation. This technique is used with [[avionics]] systems, such as those responsible for operation of the [[Space Shuttle]].

== Calculating the probability of system failure ==
Each duplicate component added to the system decreases the probability of system failure according to the formula:-

:&lt;math&gt;{p}=  \prod_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} &lt;/math&gt;
where:
* &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; – number of components
* &lt;math&gt; p_{i} &lt;/math&gt; – probability of component i failing
* &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; – the probability of all components failing (system failure)

This formula assumes independence of failure events. That means that the probability of a component B failing given that a component A has already failed is the same as that of B failing when A has not failed. There are situations where this is unreasonable, such as using two power supplies connected to the same socket in such a way that if one power supply failed, the other would too.

It also assumes that at only one component is needed to keep the system running.

'''Reverse engineering''', also called '''back engineering''', is the [[process (engineering)|process]] by which a man-made object is deconstructed to reveal its designs, architecture, or to extract knowledge from the object; similar to [[scientific research]], the only difference being that scientific research is about a [[natural phenomenon]].&lt;ref name="Eilam"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Eilam, Eldad |title=Reversing: secrets of reverseengineering|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7645-7481-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

Reverse engineering is applicable in the fields of [[mechanical engineering]], [[electronic engineering]], [[software engineering]], [[chemical engineering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ken|first1=Thayer|title=How Does Reverse Engineering Work?|url=https://insights.globalspec.com/article/7367/how-does-reverse-engineering-work|website=globalspec|publisher=IEEE Global Spec|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[systems biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alejandro|first1=F.

==Overview==
There are many reasons for performing reverse engineering in various fields. Reverse engineering has its origins in the analysis of hardware for commercial or military advantage.&lt;ref name="Chikofsky"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1109/52.43044 |first=E. J. |last=Chikofsky |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=J. H., II |last2=Cross |title=Reverse Engineering and Design Recovery: A Taxonomy |journal=IEEE Software |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=13–17 |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} However, the reverse engineering process in itself is not concerned with creating a copy or changing the artifact in some way; it is only an [[analysis]] in order to [[Deductive reasoning|deduce]] design features from products with little or no additional knowledge about the procedures involved in their original production.&lt;ref name="Chikofsky"/&gt;{{rp|15}} In some cases, the goal of the reverse engineering process can simply be a [[Documentation|redocumentation]] of [[legacy system]]s.&lt;ref name="Chikofsky"/&gt;{{rp|15}}&lt;ref name="Nelson96"&gt;A Survey of Reverse Engineering and Program Comprehension. Michael L. Nelson, April 19, 1996, ODU CS 551&amp;nbsp;– Software Engineering Survey.{{ arxiv|cs/0503068v1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the product reverse engineered is that of a competitor, the goal may not be to copy them, but to perform [[competitor analysis]].&lt;ref name="RajaFernandes2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vinesh Raja|author2=Kiran J. Fernandes|title=Reverse Engineering: An Industrial Perspective|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-84628-856-2|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reverse engineering may also be used to create [[Interoperability|interoperable products]] and despite some narrowly tailored United States and European Union legislation, the legality of using specific reverse engineering techniques for this purpose has been hotly contested in courts worldwide for more than two decades.&lt;ref name="BandKatoh2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jonathan Band|author2=Masanobu Katoh|title=Interfaces on Trial 2.0|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-29446-1|page=136, }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software reverse engineering can help to improve the understanding of the underlying source code for the maintenance and improvement of the software, relevant information can be extracted in order to make a decision for software development and graphical representations of the code can provide alternate views regarding the source code, which can help to detect and fix a software bug or vulnerability. Frequently, as some software develops, its design information and improvements are often lost over time, but this lost information can usually be recovered with reverse engineering. This process can also help to cut down the time required to understand the source code, reducing the overall cost of the software development.&lt;ref name="IEEE 1990"/&gt; Reverse engineering can also help to detect and eliminate a malicious code written to the software with better code detectors. Reversing a source code can be used to find alternate uses of the source code, such as to detect unauthorized replication of the source code where it wasn't intended to be used, or to reveal how a competitors product was built.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt; This process is commonly used for [[Software cracking|"cracking" software and media]] to remove their [[copy protection]],&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;{{rp|7}} or to create a (possibly improved) [[Copying|copy]] or even a [[knockoff]], which is usually the goal of a competitor or a hacker.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;{{rp|8}} [[Malware]] developers often use reverse engineering techniques to find vulnerabilities in an [[operating system]] (OS), in order build a [[computer virus]] that can exploit the system vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;{{rp|5}} Reverse engineering is also being used in [[cryptanalysis]] in order to find vulnerabilities in [[substitution cipher]], [[symmetric-key algorithm]] or [[public-key cryptography]].&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

* '''Interfacing'''. Reverse engineering can be used when a system is required to interface to another system and how both systems would negotiate is to be established. Such requirements typically exist for [[interoperability]].
* '''Military or commercial [[espionage]]'''. Learning about an enemy’s or competitor’s latest research by stealing or capturing a prototype and dismantling it, which may result in development of similar product, or a better countermeasure against it.
* '''Obsolescence'''. [[Integrated circuit]]s are often designed on proprietary systems, and built on production lines which become obsolete in only a few years.  When systems using these parts can no longer be maintained (since the parts are no longer made), the only way to incorporate the functionality into new technology is to reverse engineer the existing chip and then [[Remake (computing)|redesign]] it using newer tools, using the understanding gained as a guide. Another obsolescence originated problem which can be solved by reverse engineering is the need to support (maintenance and supply for continuous operation) existing, legacy devices which are no longer supported by their [[original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM). This problem is particularly critical in military operations.
* '''Product security analysis'''. To examine how a product works, what are specifications of its components, estimate costs and identify potential [[patent infringement]]. Acquiring sensitive data by disassembling and analysing the design of a system component.&lt;ref name=rfc2828&gt;Internet Engineering Task Force RFC 2828 Internet Security Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; Another intent may be to remove [[copy protection]], or circumvention of access restrictions.
* '''Competitive technical intelligence'''. Understand what one's competitor is actually doing, versus what they say they are doing.
* '''Saving money''', when one finds out what a piece of electronics is capable of, it can spare a user from purchase of a separate product.
* '''[[Repurposing]]''', when obsolete objects are reused in a different but useful manner.

== Common situations ==
===Reverse engineering of machines===
As [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) has become more popular, reverse engineering has become a viable method to create a 3D virtual model of an existing physical part for use in 3D CAD, [[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]], [[computer-aided engineering|CAE]] or other software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0010-4485(96)00054-1|url=http://ralph.cs.cf.ac.uk/papers/Geometry/RE.pdf|title=Reverse engineering of geometric models–an introduction|year=1997|last1=Varady|first1=T|last2=Martin|first2=R|last3=Cox|first3=J|journal=Computer-Aided Design|volume=29|issue=4|pages=255–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reverse-engineering process involves measuring an object and then reconstructing it as a 3D model. The physical object can be measured using [[3D scanner|3D scanning]] technologies like [[coordinate-measuring machine|CMMs]], [[3D scanner#Triangulation|laser scanners]], [[3D scanner#Structured light|structured light digitizer]]s, or [[Industrial CT Scanning]] (computed tomography). The measured data alone, usually represented as a [[point cloud]], lacks topological information and is therefore often processed and modeled into a more usable format such as a triangular-faced mesh, a set of [[Nonuniform rational B-spline|NURBS]] surfaces, or a [[computer assisted design|CAD]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://haman-co.com|title = Haman Engineering Solutions|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrid Modelling is commonly used term when NURBS and [[Solid modeling|Parametric modelling]] are implemented together. Using a combination of geometric and freeform surfaces can provide a powerful method of 3D modelling. Areas of freeform data can be combined with exact geometric surfaces to create a hybrid model. A typical example of this would be the reverse engineering of a cylinder head, which includes freeform cast features, such as water jackets and high tolerance machined areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicaldigital.com/services/reverse-engineering/|title=Reverse Engineering|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverse engineering is also used by businesses to bring existing physical geometry into digital product development environments, to make a digital 3D record of their own products, or to assess competitors' products. It is used to analyse, for instance, how a product works, what it does, and what components it consists of, estimate costs, and identify potential [[patent]] infringement, etc.

[[Value engineering]] is a related activity also used by businesses. It involves de-constructing and analysing products, but the objective is to find opportunities for cost cutting.

===Reverse engineering of software===
In 1990, [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) defined ''reverse engineering'' as "the process of analyzing a
subject system to identify the system's components and their interrelationships and to create representations of the system in another form or at a higher
level of abstraction", where the "subject system" is the end product of software development. Reverse engineering is a process of examination only: the software system under consideration is not modified (which would make it [[reengineering (software)|re-engineering]] or restructuring). Reverse engineering can be performed from any stage of the product cycle, not necessarily from the functional end product.&lt;ref name="IEEE 1990"/&gt;

There are two components in reverse engineering: redocumentation and design recovery. Redocumentation is the creation of new representation of the computer code so that it is easier to understand. Meanwhile, design recovery is the using of deduction or reasoning from general knowledge or personal experience of the product in order to fully understand the product functionality.&lt;ref name="IEEE 1990"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chikofsky | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Cross | first2 = J. H. | doi = 10.1109/52.43044 
| title = Reverse engineering and design recovery: A taxonomy | journal = IEEE Software | volume = 7 | pages = 13–17 |date=January 1990 | url = http://win.ua.ac.be/~lore/Research/Chikofsky1990-Taxonomy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as "going backwards through the development cycle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Warden | first=R. | title=Software Reuse and Reverse Engineering in Practice | year=1992 | publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall | location=London, England | pages=283–305}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the output of the implementation phase (in source code form) is reverse-engineered back to the analysis phase, in an inversion of the traditional [[waterfall model]]. Another term for this technique is [[program comprehension]].&lt;ref name="Nelson96"/&gt; Working Conference on Reverse Engineering (WCRE) has been held yearly to explore and expand the techniques of reverse engineering.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Working Conference on Reverse Engineering (WCRE)|url=http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/wcre/index.html|website=http://dblp.uni-trier.de|publisher=Computer Science bibliography|accessdate=22 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314150255/http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/wcre/index.html|archivedate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer-aided software engineering]] (CASE) and automated code generation have contributed greatly in the field of reverse engineering.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;

[[Software anti-tamper]] technology like [[Obfuscation (software)|obfuscation]] is used to deter both reverse engineering and re-engineering of proprietary software and software-powered systems. In practice, two main types of reverse engineering emerge. In the first case, source code is already available for the software, but higher-level aspects of the program, perhaps poorly documented or documented but no longer valid, are discovered. In the second case, there is no source code available for the software, and any efforts towards discovering one possible source code for the software are regarded as reverse engineering. This second usage of the term is the one most people are familiar with. Reverse engineering of software can make use of the [[clean room design]] technique to avoid copyright infringement.

On a related note, [[black box testing]] in [[software engineering]] has a lot in common with reverse engineering. The tester usually has the [[application programming interface|API]], but their goals are to find bugs and undocumented features by bashing the product from outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/3659140732 | title=Reverse Engineering and Testing of Black-Box Software Components: by Grammatical Inference techniques | publisher=LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing | author=Shahbaz, Muzammil | year=2012 | isbn=978-3659140730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other purposes of reverse engineering include security auditing, removal of copy protection ("[[software cracking|cracking]]"), circumvention of access restrictions often present in [[consumer electronics]], customization of [[embedded systems]] (such as engine management systems), in-house repairs or retrofits, enabling of additional features on low-cost "crippled" hardware (such as some graphics card chip-sets), or even mere satisfaction of curiosity.

====Binary software====
Binary reverse engineering is performed if source code for a software is unavailable.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt; This process is sometimes termed ''Reverse Code Engineering'', or RCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chuvakin | first=Anton |author2=Cyrus Peikari  | edition=1st | title=Security Warrior | publisher=O'Reilly |date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, decompilation of binaries for the [[Java platform]] can be accomplished using Jad. One famous case of reverse engineering was the first non-[[International Business Machines|IBM]] implementation of the [[IBM PC|PC]] [[BIOS]] which launched the historic [[IBM PC compatible]] industry that has been the overwhelmingly dominant computer hardware platform for many years. Reverse engineering of software is protected in the U.S. by the [[fair use]] exception in [[copyright|copyright law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/797533 |authorlink=Pamela Samuelson |first=Pamela |last=Samuelson |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Suzanne |last2=Scotchmer |title=The Law and Economics of Reverse Engineering |volume=111 |journal=[[Yale Law Journal]] |issue= 7|pages=1575–1663 |year=2002 |url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/the-yale-law-journal/content-pages/the-law-and-economics-of-reverse-engineering/|jstor=797533 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Samba software]], which allows systems that are not running [[Microsoft Windows]] systems to share files with systems that are, is a classic example of software reverse engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Samba: An Introduction | url=http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/SambaIntro.html | date=2001-11-27 | accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the Samba project had to reverse-engineer unpublished information about how Windows file sharing worked, so that non-Windows computers could emulate it. The [[Wine (software)|Wine]] project does the same thing for the [[Windows API]], and [[OpenOffice.org]] is one party doing this for the [[Microsoft Office]] file formats. The [[ReactOS]] project is even more ambitious in its goals, as it strives to provide binary (ABI and API) compatibility with the current Windows OSes of the NT branch, allowing software and drivers written for Windows to run on a clean-room reverse-engineered  [[Free Software]] ([[GPL]]) counterpart.  [[WindowsSCOPE]] allows for reverse-engineering the full contents of a Windows system's live memory including a binary-level, graphical reverse engineering of all running processes.

Another classic, if not well-known example is that in 1987 [[Bell Laboratories]] reverse-engineered the [[Mac OS]] System 4.1, originally running on the Apple [[Macintosh SE]], so they could run it on RISC machines of their own.&lt;ref name="Lee2013"&gt;{{cite book|first=Newton|last=Lee|title=Counterterrorism and Cybersecurity: Total Information Awareness (2nd Edition)|url=https://www.amazon.com/Counterterrorism-Cybersecurity-Total-Information-Awareness/dp/1461472040/|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|date=2013|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Binary software techniques=====
Reverse engineering of software can be accomplished by various methods.
The three main groups of software reverse engineering are
#Analysis through observation of information exchange, most prevalent in protocol reverse engineering, which involves using [[bus analyzer]]s and [[packet sniffer]]s, for example, for accessing a [[computer bus]] or [[computer network]] connection and revealing the traffic data thereon. Bus or network behavior can then be analyzed to produce a stand-alone implementation that mimics that behavior. This is especially useful for reverse engineering [[device driver]]s. Sometimes, reverse engineering on [[embedded system]]s is greatly assisted by tools deliberately introduced by the manufacturer, such as [[JTAG]] ports or other debugging means. In [[Microsoft Windows]], low-level debuggers such as [[SoftICE]] are popular.
#[[Disassembly]] using a [[disassembler]], meaning the raw [[machine language]] of the program is read and understood in its own terms, only with the aid of machine-language [[mnemonic]]s. This works on any computer program but can take quite some time, especially for someone not used to machine code. The [[Interactive Disassembler]] is a particularly popular tool.
#Decompilation using a [[decompiler]], a process that tries, with varying results, to recreate the source code in some high-level language for a program only available in machine code or [[bytecode]].

====Software classification====
Software classification is the process of identifying similarities between different software binaries (for example, two different versions of the same binary) used to detect code relations between software samples. This task was traditionally done manually for several reasons (such as patch analysis for vulnerability detection and [[copyright infringement]]) but nowadays can be done somewhat automatically for large numbers of samples.

This method is being used mostly for long and thorough reverse engineering tasks (complete analysis of a complex algorithm or big piece of software). In general, [[statistical classification]] is considered to be a hard problem and this is also true for software classification, therefore there aren't many solutions/tools that handle this task well.

===Source code===
A number of [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] tools refer to the process of importing and analysing source code to generate UML diagrams as "reverse engineering". See [[List of UML tools]].

Although UML is one approach to providing "reverse engineering" more recent advances in international standards activities have resulted in the development of the [[Knowledge Discovery Metamodel]] (KDM). This standard delivers an ontology for the intermediate (or abstracted) representation of programming language constructs and their interrelationships.  An [[Object Management Group]] standard (on its way to becoming an ISO standard as well), KDM has started to take hold in industry with the development of tools and analysis environments which can deliver the  extraction and analysis of source, binary, and byte code. For source code analysis, KDM's granular standards' architecture enables the extraction of software system flows (data, control, &amp; call maps), architectures, and business layer knowledge (rules, terms, process). The standard enables the use of a common data format (XMI) enabling the correlation of the various layers of system knowledge for either detailed analysis (e.g. root cause, impact) or derived analysis (e.g. business process extraction).  Although efforts to represent language constructs can be never-ending given the number of languages, the continuous evolution of software languages and the development of new languages, the standard does allow for the use of extensions to support the broad language set as well as evolution. KDM is compatible with UML, BPMN, RDF and other standards enabling migration into other environments and thus leverage system knowledge for efforts such as software system transformation and enterprise business layer analysis.

===Reverse engineering of protocols===

[[Communications protocol|Protocols]] are sets of rules that describe message formats and how messages are exchanged (i.e., the protocol [[Finite-state machine|state-machine]]). Accordingly, the problem of protocol reverse-engineering can be partitioned into two subproblems; message format and state-machine reverse-engineering.

The message formats have traditionally been reverse-engineered through a tedious manual process, which involved analysis of how protocol implementations process messages, but recent research proposed a number of automatic solutions.&lt;ref&gt;W. Cui, J. Kannan, and H. J. Wang. Discoverer: Automatic protocol reverse engineering from network traces. In Proceedings of 16th USENIX Security Symposium on USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cui, M. Peinado, K. Chen, H. J. Wang, and L. Irún-Briz. Tupni: Automatic reverse engineering of input formats. In Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 391–402. ACM, Oct 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M. Comparetti, G. Wondracek pages 110-125"&gt;P. M. Comparetti, G. Wondracek, C. Kruegel, and E. Kirda. Prospex: Protocol specification extraction. In Proceedings of the 2009 30th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 110–125, Washington, 2009. IEEE Computer Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, these automatic approaches either group observed messages into clusters using various [[Cluster analysis|clustering analyses]], or emulate the protocol implementation tracing the message processing.

There has been less work on reverse-engineering of state-machines of protocols. In general, the protocol state-machines can be learned either through a process of [[offline learning]], which passively observes communication and attempts to build the most general state-machine accepting all observed sequences of messages, and [[online machine learning|online learning]], which allows interactive generation of probing sequences of messages and listening to responses to those probing sequences. In general, offline learning of small state-machines is known to be [[NP-complete]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0019-9958(78)90562-4|title=Complexity of automaton identification from given data|year=1978|last1=Gold|first1=E|journal=Information and Control|volume=37|issue=3|pages=302–320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while online learning can be done in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. Angluin|title= Learning regular sets from queries and counterexamples|doi=10.1016/0890-5401(87)90052-6|journal= Information and Computation|volume= 75|issue=2|pages=87–106|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; An automatic offline approach has been demonstrated by Comparetti et al.&lt;ref name="M. Comparetti, G. Wondracek pages 110-125"/&gt; and an online approach by Cho et al.&lt;ref&gt;C.Y. Cho, D. Babic, R. Shin, and D. Song. [http://www.domagoj-babic.com/index.php/Pubs/CCS10botnets Inference and Analysis of Formal Models of Botnet Command and Control Protocols], 2010 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other components of typical protocols, like encryption and hash functions, can be reverse-engineered automatically as well. Typically, the automatic approaches trace the execution of protocol implementations and try to detect buffers in memory holding unencrypted packets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/polyglot_ccs07_av.pdf Polyglot: automatic extraction of protocol message format using dynamic binary analysis]. J. Caballero, H. Yin, Z. Liang, and D. Song. Proceedings of the 14th ACM conference on Computer and communications security, p. 317-329.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reverse engineering of integrated circuits/smart cards===
Reverse engineering is an invasive and destructive form of analyzing a smart card. The attacker grinds away layer after layer of the smart card and takes pictures with an [[electron microscope]]. With this technique, it is possible to reveal the complete hardware and software part of the smart card. The major problem for the attacker is to bring everything into the right order to find out how everything works. The makers of the card try to hide keys and operations by mixing up memory positions, for example, [[bus scrambling]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Rankl, Wolfgang Effing, Smart Card Handbook (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Welz: [https://archive.is/20120724013648/http://www.crypto.rub.de/its_seminar_ws0708.html Smart cards as methods for payment] (2008), Seminar ITS-Security Ruhr-Universität Bochum&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases, it is even possible to attach a probe to measure voltages while the smart card is still operational. The makers of the card employ sensors to detect and prevent this attack.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Musker: [http://www.jenkins.eu/articles-general/reverse-engineering.asp Protecting &amp; Exploiting Intellectual Property in Electronics], IBC Conferences, 10 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt; This attack is not very common because it requires a large investment in effort and special equipment that is generally only available to large chip manufacturers. Furthermore, the payoff from this attack is low since other security techniques are often employed such as shadow accounts.  It is uncertain at this time whether attacks against CHIP/PIN cards to replicate encryption data and consequentially crack PINS would provide a cost effective attack on multifactor authentication.

===Reverse engineering for military applications===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2014}}
Reverse engineering is often used by people in order to copy other nations' technologies, devices, or information that have been obtained by regular troops in the fields or by [[military intelligence|intelligence]] operations. It was often used during the [[Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]]. Well-known examples from WWII and later include:
* [[Jerry can]]: British and American forces noticed that the Germans had gasoline cans with an excellent design. They reverse-engineered copies of those cans. The cans were popularly known as "Jerry cans".
*[[Panzerschreck]]: The Germans captured an American [[Bazooka]] during World War II, and reverse engineered it to create the larger Panzerschreck.
* [[Tupolev Tu-4]]: In 1944, three American [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] bombers on missions over [[Japan]] were forced to land in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The Soviets, who did not have a similar strategic bomber, decided to copy the B-29. Within three years, they had developed the Tu-4, a near-perfect copy.
* [[SCR-584 radar]]: copied by [[Soviet Union|USSR]] after the Second World War. Known in the form a few modifications - СЦР-584, Бинокль-Д.
* [[V-2]] rocket: Technical documents for the V2 and related technologies were captured by the Western Allies at the end of the war. The American side focused their reverse engineering efforts via [[operation Paperclip]], which led to the development of the [[PGM-11 Redstone]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Dictionary/REDSTONE/DI149.htm |title=Redstone rocket |publisher=centennialofflight.net |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet side used captured German engineers to reproduce technical documents and plans, and work from captured hardware in order to make their clone of the rocket, the [[R-1 (missile)|R-1]]. Thus began the postwar Soviet rocket program that led to the [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] and the beginning of the [[space race]].
* [[Vympel K-13|K-13/R-3S]] missile ([[NATO reporting name]] '''AA-2 Atoll'''), a Soviet reverse-engineered copy of the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], was made possible after a Taiwanese AIM-9B hit a Chinese [[MiG-17]] without exploding in September 1958.&lt;ref&gt;"The Chinese Air Force: Evolving Concepts, Roles, and Capabilities", Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs (U.S), by National Defense University Press, pg. 277&lt;/ref&gt; The missile became lodged within the airframe, and the pilot returned to base with what Russian scientists would describe as a university course in missile development.
* [[BGM-71 TOW]] Missile: In May 1975, negotiations between Iran and Hughes Missile Systems on co-production of the TOW and Maverick missiles stalled over disagreements in the pricing structure, the subsequent [[1979 revolution]] ending all plans for such co-production. Iran was later successful in reverse-engineering the missile and are currently producing their own copy: the [[Toophan]].
* China has [[Intellectual property in the People's Republic of China|reversed engineered many examples]] of Western and Russian hardware, from fighter aircraft to missiles and [[HMMWV]] cars.
* During the Second World War, Polish and British cryptographers studied captured German [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|"Enigma"]] message encryption machines for weaknesses. Their operation was then simulated on electro-mechanical devices called "[[Bombe]]s" that tried all the possible scrambler settings of the "Enigma" machines to help break the coded messages sent by the Germans.
* Also during the Second World War, British scientists analyzed and defeated a [[Battle of the Beams|series of increasingly sophisticated radio navigation systems]] being used by the German Luftwaffe to perform guided bombing missions at night. The British countermeasures to this system were so effective that in some cases German aircraft were led by signals to land at RAF bases, believing they were back in German territory.

=== Overlap with patent law===
Reverse engineering applies primarily to gaining understanding of a process or artifact, where the manner of its construction, use, or internal processes is not made clear by its creator.

[[Patent|Patented items]] do not of themselves have to be reverse-engineered to be studied, since the essence of a patent is that the inventor provides detailed public disclosure themselves, and in return [[intellectual property rights|receives legal protection]] of the [[invention]] involved. However, an item produced under one or more patents could also include other technology that is not patented and not disclosed. Indeed, one common motivation of reverse engineering is to determine whether a competitor's product contains [[patent infringement]]s or [[copyright infringement]]s.

==Legality==
===United States===
In the United States even if an artifact or process is protected by [[trade secret]]s, reverse-engineering the artifact or process is often lawful as long as it has been legitimately obtained.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asme.org/career-education/articles/management-professional-practice/trade-secrets-101 "Trade Secrets 101," Feature Article, March 2011]. ASME. Retrieved on 2013-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverse engineering of [[computer software]] in the US often falls under both [[contract law]] as a [[breach of contract]] as well as any other relevant laws. This is because  most [[EULA]]s (end user license agreement) specifically prohibit it, and U.S. courts have ruled that if such terms are present, they override the copyright law which expressly permits it (see ''[[Bowers v. Baystate Technologies]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utsystem.edu/ogc/intellectualproperty/baystatevbowersdiscussion.htm Baystate v. Bowers Discussion]. Utsystem.edu. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Grant. (2003-06-26) [http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/contract-case-could-hurt-reverse-engineering-337 Contract case could hurt reverse engineering | Developer World]. InfoWorld. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;). Sec. 103(f) of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] ([https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201- 17 U.S.C. § 1201 (f)]) says that a person who is in legal possession of a program, is permitted to reverse-engineer and circumvent its protection if this is necessary in order to achieve "interoperability" — a term broadly covering other devices and programs being able to interact with it, make use of it, and to use and transfer data to and from it, in useful ways. A limited exemption exists that allows the knowledge thus gained to be shared and used for interoperability purposes.&lt;ref&gt;The section states:&lt;br&gt;(f) Reverse Engineering.—&lt;br&gt;(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), a person who has lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of a computer program may circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a particular portion of that program for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing those elements of the program that are necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and that have not previously been readily available to the person engaging in the circumvention, to the extent any such acts of identification and analysis do not constitute infringement under this title.&lt;br&gt;(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(2) and (b), a person may develop and employ technological means to circumvent a technological measure, or to circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure, in order to enable the identification and analysis under paragraph (1), or for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, if such means are necessary to achieve such interoperability, to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title.&lt;br&gt;(3) The information acquired through the acts permitted under paragraph (1), and the means permitted under paragraph (2), may be made available to others if the person referred to in paragraph (1) or (2), as the case may be, provides such information or means solely for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title or violate applicable law other than this section.&lt;br&gt;(4) For purposes of this subsection, the term 「interoperability」 means the ability of computer programs to exchange information, and of such programs mutually to use the information which has been exchanged.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===

[[Computer Programs Directive|EU Directive 2009/24]] on the legal protection of computer programs, which superseded an earlier (1991) directive,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991L0250:EN:HTML Council Directive 91/250/EEC of 14 May 1991 on the legal protection of computer programs]. Eur-lex.europa.eu. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; governs reverse engineering in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1435057541496&amp;uri=CELEX:32009L0024 DIRECTIVE 2009/24/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The directive states:{{quote|The unauthorised reproduction, translation, adaptation or transformation of the form of the code in which a copy of a computer program has been made available constitutes an infringement of the exclusive rights of the author. Nevertheless, circumstances may exist when such a reproduction of the code and translation of its form are indispensable to obtain the necessary information to achieve the interoperability of an independently created program with other programs. It has therefore to be considered that, in these limited circumstances only, performance of the acts of reproduction and translation by or on behalf of a person having a right to use a copy of the program is legitimate and compatible with fair practice and must therefore be deemed not to require the authorisation of the rightholder. An objective of this exception is to make it possible to connect all components of a computer system, including those of different manufacturers, so that they can work together. Such an exception to the author's exclusive rights may not be used in a way which prejudices the legitimate interests of the rightholder or which conflicts with a normal exploitation of the program.}}

[[File:Ripple　- in rail.jpg|thumb|right on water]]
A '''ripple effect''' is a situation in which, like ripples expanding across the water when an object is dropped into it, an effect from an initial state can be followed outwards incrementally.

Ripple effect is often used colloquially to mean a [[multiplier (economics)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/05/27/eveningnews/main4130453.shtml The Economic Ripple Effect Gone Awry].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology]], it can be observed how social interactions can affect situations not directly related to the initial interaction,&lt;ref&gt;Development sociology By Norman Long, [[Routledge]] {{ISBN|978-0-415-23536-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2013}} and in [[Charity (practice)|charitable]] activities where information can be disseminated and passed from community to community to broaden its impact.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/sep/17/tefl3 Experience needed to make VSO's 'ripple effect' work] [[The Guardian]] 17 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has been applied in [[computer science]] within the field of [[software metrics]] as a [[Programming complexity|complexity measure]].&lt;ref name="Black2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Black|first=Sue|year=2001|title=Computing ripple effect for software maintenance|journal=[[Journal of Software Maintenance and Evolution: Research and Practice]]|volume=13|issue=4|pages=263–279|issn=1532-060X|doi=10.1002/smr.233|authorlink=Sue Black (computer scientist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1262">A '''''roman à tiroirs''''' (French for "novel with/made of drawers") is a French term for a novel in which the principal or main [[narrative]] (or "[[frame story]]") is interrupted by secondary narratives (involving secondary characters and/or told by other narrators), which may in turn themselves be interrupted by further narratives/narrators.  As such, it is a form of the "[[story within a story]]" [[literary device]] in which the fiction is nested in two or more layers and where the resolution of the main narrative is delayed because of the inserted secondary tales/stories.  In French, the embedded narratives are referred to as ''récits enchâssés'' or ''récits emboités''.

The expression "à tiroirs" as applied to a work of literature dates from 1752, and appears to have been used originally in reference to theater and plays (a "pièce à tiroirs" or "comédie à tiroirs").&lt;ref&gt;''"Romans à tiroirs" d'hier et d'aujourd'hui: Parodie et experimentation romanesque."''

{{Personality disorders sidebar}}
'''Sadistic personality disorder''' is a [[personality disorder]] involving [[:wikt:sadism|sadism]] which appeared in an appendix of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-III-R]]).&lt;ref name=DSM&gt;Hucker, Stephen J. [https://archive.is/20130101004151/http://www.forensicpsychiatry.ca/paraphilia/sadPD.htm Sadistic Personality Disorder]&lt;/ref&gt; The later versions of the DSM ([[DSM-IV]], [[DSM-IV-TR]] and [[DSM-5]]) do not include it.

The words ''sadism'' and ''sadist'' are derived from [[Marquis de Sade]].

== Definition ==
Sadism involves deriving pleasure through themselves or others undergoing discomfort or pain. The [[opponent-process theory]] explains the way in which individuals not only display, but also enjoy committing sadistic acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Reidy D.E. |author2=Zeichner A. |author3=Seibert L.A. | year = 2011 | title = Unprovoked aggression: Effects of psychopathic traits and sadism | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 79 | issue = 1| pages = 75–100 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00691.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=please explain how the opponent process theory explains this. |date=May 2013 }} Individuals possessing sadistic personalities tend to display recurrent aggression and cruel behavior.&lt;ref name="j.paid.2009.06.020"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.06.020 |title=Contributions of psychopathic, narcissistic, Machiavellian, and sadistic personality traits to juvenile delinquency | volume=47 | journal=Personality and Individual Differences |pages=734–739}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Buckels"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buckels|first=E.

== Comorbidity with other personality disorders ==
Sadistic personality disorder has been found to occur frequently in unison with other personality disorders. Studies have also found that sadistic personality disorder is the personality disorder with the highest level of [[comorbidity]] to other types of psychopathological disorders.&lt;ref name="jaapl1"/&gt; In contrast, sadism has also been found in patients who do not display any or other forms of [[psychopath]]ic disorders.&lt;ref name="j.1467-6494.2010.00691.x"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00691.x | volume=79 | title=Unprovoked Aggression: Effects of Psychopathic Traits and Sadism | journal=Journal of Personality | pages=75–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One personality disorder that is often found to occur alongside sadistic personality disorder is [[conduct disorder]], not an adult disorder but one of childhood and adolescence.&lt;ref name="jaapl1"/&gt;  Studies have found other types of illnesses, such as [[alcoholism]], to have a high rate of comorbidity with sadistic personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016517819390077T|title= Prevalence and characteristics of sadistic personality disorder in an outpatient veterans population| doi=10.1016/0165-1781(93)90077-T | volume=48|journal=Psychiatry Research|pages=267–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have had some level of difficulty distinguishing sadistic personality disorder from other forms of personality disorders due to its high level of comorbidity with other disorders.&lt;ref name="jaapl1"/&gt;

==Removal from the DSM==
Numerous theorists and clinicians introduced sadistic personality disorder to the DSM in 1987 and it was placed in the DSM-III-R as a way to facilitate further systematic clinical study and research.

'''Social security''' is "any government system that provides monetary assistance to people with an inadequate or no income."&lt;ref name="Bach2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Bach|title=1001 Financial Words You Need to Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a5R44srUbsUC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=%22social%20security%22|date=9 October 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-517050-4|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, this is usually called '''welfare''' or a [[social safety net]], especially when talking about Canada and European countries.

Social security is asserted in Article 22 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the [[economic, social and cultural rights]] indispensable for his [[human dignity|dignity]] and the free development of his personality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In simple terms, the signatories agree that the society in which a person lives should help them to develop and to make the most of all the advantages (culture, work, [[social welfare]]) which are offered to them in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/humanrights/resources/plain.asp|work=Plain language version|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=20 April 2012|quote=Art 22. "22 The society in which you live should help you to develop and to make the most of all the advantages (culture, work, social welfare) which are offered to you and to all the men and women in your country."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social security may also refer to the action programs of an organization intended to promote the welfare of the population through assistance measures guaranteeing access to sufficient resources for food and shelter and to promote health and well-being for the population at large and potentially vulnerable segments such as children, the elderly, the sick and the unemployed. Services providing social security are often called '''[[social services]]'''.

Terminology in this area is somewhat different in the [[United States]] from in the rest of the English-speaking world. The general term for an action program in support of the well being of poor people in the United States is ''welfare program'', and the general term for all such programs is simply ''welfare''. In American society, the term ''welfare'' arguably has negative connotations. In the United States, the term ''Social Security'' refers to the [[Social Security (United States)|US social insurance program]] for all retired and disabled people. Elsewhere the term is used in a much broader sense, referring to the economic security society offers when people are faced with certain risks. In its 1952 [[Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952|Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention (nr. 102)]], the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) defined the traditional contingencies covered by social security as including:

*  Survival beyond a prescribed age, to be covered by ''[[old age pension]]s'';
*  The loss of support suffered by a widowed person or child as the result of the death of the breadwinner (''survivor’s benefit'');
*  Responsibility for the maintenance of children (''family benefit'');
*  The treatment of any morbid condition (including pregnancy), whatever its cause (''medical care'');
*  A suspension of earnings due to pregnancy and confinement and their consequences (''maternity benefit'');
*  A suspension of earnings due to an inability to obtain suitable employment for protected persons who are capable of, and available for, work (''[[unemployment benefits]]'');
*  A suspension of earnings due to an incapacity for work resulting from a morbid condition (''sickness leave benefit'');
*  A permanent or persistent inability to engage in any gainful activity (''[[disability benefits]]'');
*  The costs and losses involved in medical care, sickness leave, invalidity and death of the breadwinner due to an occupational accident or disease (''employment injuries'').

People who cannot reach a guaranteed [[minimum wage|social minimum]] for other reasons may be eligible for ''social assistance'' (or [[welfare]], in American English).

Modern authors often consider the ILO approach too narrow. In their view, social security is not limited to the provision of cash transfers, but also aims at security of work, health, and social participation; and new social risks (single parenthood, the reconciliation of work and family life) should be included in the list as well.&lt;ref&gt;See for a more elaborate discussion: {{cite book|author=J.C. Vrooman|title=Rules of Relief; Institutions of Social Security, and Their Impact|url=http://www.transactionpub.com/title/Rules-of-Relief-978-90-377-0218-7.html|year=2009|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]] (The Netherlands Institute for Social Research)|pages=111–126}} {{ISBN|978-90-377-0218-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social security may refer to:
*  '''[[social insurance]]''', where people receive benefits or services in recognition of contributions to an insurance program. These services typically include provision for retirement [[pensions]], [[disability insurance]], survivor benefits and [[unemployment insurance]].
*  '''services''' provided by government or designated agencies responsible for social security provision. In different countries, that may include medical care, financial support during unemployment, sickness, or retirement, health and safety at work, aspects of social work and even industrial relations.
*  '''basic security''' irrespective of participation in specific insurance programs where eligibility may otherwise be an issue. For instance, assistance given to newly arrived refugees for basic necessities such as [[food]], [[clothing]], [[Home|housing]], [[education]], [[money]], and [[medicine|medical care]].

A report published by the ILO in 2014 estimated that only 27% of the world's population has access to comprehensive social security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_244748/lang--en/index.htm|title=More than 70 per cent of the world population lacks proper social protection|author=|date=3 June 2014|website=ilo.org|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

While several of the provisions to which the concept refers have a long history (especially in poor relief), the notion of "social security" itself is a fairly recent one. The earliest examples of use date from the 19th century. In a speech to mark the independence of [[Venezuela]], [[Simón Bolívar]] (1819) pronounced: "El sistema de gobierno más perfecto es aquel que produce mayor suma de felicidad posible, mayor suma de ''seguridad social'' y mayor suma de estabilidad política"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.correodelorinoco.gob.ve/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/EE_CO523.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901103013/http://www.correodelorinoco.gob.ve/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/EE_CO523.pdf |archivedate=1 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which translates to "The most perfect system of government is that which produces the greatest amount of happiness, the greatest amount of social security and the greatest amount of political stability").

In the [[Roman Empire]], the Emperor [[Trajan]] (reigned A.D. 98–117) distributed gifts of money and free [[grain]] to the poor in the city of Rome, and returned the gifts of gold sent to him upon his accession by cities in Italy and the provinces of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/602150/Trajan#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Trajan%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopædia Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan's program brought acclaim from many, including [[Pliny the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/romans/empire/nerva_trajan.html|title=The Roman Empire: in the First Century. The Roman Empire. Emperors. Nerva &amp; Trajan - PBS|author=|date=|website=www.pbs.org|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jewish tradition, charity (represented by [[tzedakah]]) is a matter of religious obligation rather than benevolence. Contemporary charity is regarded as a continuation of the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Maaser Ani]], or poor-[[tithe]], as well as Biblical practices, such as permitting the poor to glean the corners of a field and harvest during the [[Shmita]] (Sabbatical year). Voluntary charity, along with [[prayer]] and [[repentance]], is befriended to ameliorate the consequences of bad acts.

The Song dynasty (c.1000 AD) government supported multiple forms of social assistance programs, including the establishment of retirement homes, public clinics, and pauper's graveyards.&lt;ref&gt;[[Song dynasty]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to economist [[Robert Nelson (economist)|Robert Henry Nelson]], "The [[medieval]] [[Roman Catholic Church]] operated a far-reaching and comprehensive welfare system for the poor..."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Henry Nelson (2001). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rw-bHEGNqqcC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Economics as religion: from Samuelson to Chicago and beyond]''".

The concepts of welfare and [[pension]] were put into practice in the early [[Sharia|Islamic law]]&lt;ref name=Crone/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2010}} of the [[Caliphate]] as forms of ''[[Zakat]]'' (charity), one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], since the time of the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun caliph]] [[Umar]] in the 7th century. The [[tax]]es (including ''Zakat'' and ''[[Jizya]]'') collected in the [[treasury]] of an Islamic government were used to provide [[income]] for the needy, including the [[Poverty|poor]], [[Old age|elderly]], [[orphan]]s, [[widow]]ed persons, and the disabled. According to the Islamic jurist [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel, 1058–1111), the government was also expected to store up food supplies in every region in case a [[disaster]] or [[famine]] occurred.&lt;ref name=Crone&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6u13vgHhSdgC&amp;pg=PA308&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=''Medieval Islamic Political Thought''|first=Patricia|last=Crone|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0-7486-2194-6|pages=308–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hamid&gt;{{Cite journal|title=An Islamic Alternative? Equality, Redistributive Justice, and the Welfare State in the Caliphate of Umar|author=Shadi Hamid|journal=[[Monthly Renaissance|Renaissance: Monthly Islamic Journal]]|volume=13|issue=8|date=August 2003}} (see [http://www.renaissance.com.pk/Augvipo2y3.html online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030901100155/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/Augvipo2y3.html |date=1 September 2003 }})&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Bayt al-mal]] for further information.)

There is relatively little [[statistic]]al data on [[transfer payment]]s before the [[High Middle Ages]]. In the [[medieval]] period and until the [[Industrial Revolution]], the function of welfare payments in [[Europe]] was principally achieved through private giving or [[Charity (practice)|charity]]. In those early times, there was a much broader group considered to be in poverty as compared to the 21st century.

Early welfare programs in Europe included the [[England|English]] [[Poor Law]] of 1601, which gave [[parish]]es the responsibility for providing poverty relief assistance to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/boyer.poor.laws.england The Poor Laws of England] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105105148/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/boyer.poor.laws.england |date=5 January 2010 }} at EH.Net&lt;/ref&gt; This system was substantially modified by the 19th-century [[Poor Law Amendment Act]], which introduced the system of [[workhouse]]s.

It was predominantly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that an organized system of state welfare provision was introduced in many countries. [[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Chancellor of the German Empire|Chancellor]] of Germany, introduced one of the first welfare systems for the [[working class]]es in 1883. In [[Great Britain]] the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government of [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] and [[David Lloyd George]] introduced the [[National Insurance]] system in 1911,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/britain/liberalreformsrev2.shtml Liberal Reforms] at [[BBC]] Bitesize&lt;/ref&gt; a system later expanded by [[Clement Attlee]]. The United States did not have an organized welfare system until the [[Great Depression]], when emergency relief measures were introduced under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Even then, Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] focused predominantly on a program of providing work and stimulating the economy through [[public spending]] on projects, rather than on cash payment.

== Income maintenance ==
{{Main|Unemployment benefits}}
This policy is usually applied through various programs designed to provide a population with income at times when they are unable to care for themselves. Income maintenance is based in a combination of five main types of program:
*  '''Social insurance''', considered above
*  '''Means-tested''' benefits, financial assistance provided for those who are unable to cover basic needs, such as food, clothing and housing, due to [[poverty]] or lack of income because of unemployment, sickness, disability, or caring for children. While assistance is often in the form of financial payments, those eligible for social welfare can usually access health and educational services free of charge. The amount of support is enough to cover basic needs and eligibility is often subject to a comprehensive and complex assessment of an applicant's social and financial situation. See also [[Income Support]].
*  '''Non-contributory''' benefits. Several countries have special schemes, administered with no requirement for contributions and no means test, for people in certain categories of need: for example, veterans of armed forces, people with disabilities and very old people.
*  '''Discretionary''' benefits. Some schemes are based on the discretion of an official, such as a social worker.
*  '''Universal''' or categorical benefits, also known as '''demogrants'''. These are non-contributory benefits given for whole sections of the population without a means test, such as family allowances or the public pension in New Zealand (known as New Zealand Superannuation). See also, [[Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend]].

== Social protection ==
{{main|Social protection}}
Social protection refers to a set of benefits available (or not available) from the state, market, civil society and households, or through a combination of these agencies, to the individual/households to reduce multi-dimensional deprivation. This multi-dimensional deprivation could be affecting less active poor persons (such as the elderly or the disabled) and active [[Poverty|poor]] persons (such as the unemployed).

This broad framework makes this concept more acceptable in developing countries than the concept of social security. Social security is more applicable in the conditions, where large numbers of citizens depend on the formal economy for their livelihood. Through a defined contribution, this social security may be managed.

But, in the context of widespread informal economy, formal social security arrangements are almost absent for the vast majority of the working population. Besides, in developing countries, the state's capacity to reach the vast majority of the poor people may be limited because of its limited infrastructure and resources. In such a context, multiple agencies that could provide for social protection, including health care, is critical for policy consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, Roger Lee (1990).  The political economy of population control and retirement security in China, India and the Philippines.  ''Philippine Economic Review'', 31(2): 174–191.&lt;/ref&gt; The framework of social protection is thus holds the state responsible for providing for the poorest populations by regulating non-state agencies.

Collaborative research from the [[Institute of Development Studies]] debating Social Protection from a global perspective, suggests that advocates for social protection fall into two broad categories: "instrumentalists" and "activists". Instrumentalists argue that [[extreme poverty]], [[economic inequality|inequality]], and [[social vulnerability|vulnerability]] is dysfunctional in the achievement of development targets (such as the MDGs). In this view, social protection is about putting in place risk management mechanisms that will compensate for incomplete or missing insurance (and other) markets, until a time that private insurance can play a more prominent role in that society. Activist arguments view the persistence of extreme poverty, inequality, and vulnerability as symptoms of [[social injustice]] and [[Structural Inequality|structural inequality]] and see social protection as a right of citizenship. Targeted welfare is a necessary step between humanitarianism and the ideal of a "[[guaranteed minimum income]]" where entitlement extends beyond cash or food transfers and is based on citizenship, not philanthropy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntd.co.uk/idsbookshop/details.asp?id=987 'Debating Social Protection'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724102136/http://www.ntd.co.uk/idsbookshop/details.asp?id=987 |date=24 July 2011 }} Devereux, S and Sabates-Wheeler, R.

The organization and definition of groups within a social system depend on various shared characteristics such as location, socioeconomic status, race, religion, societal function, or other distinguishable features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/social-system.html|title=What is social system? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable theorists ==
The study of social systems is integral to the fields of sociology and public policy. Social systems have been studied for as long as sociology has existed.

=== Talcott Parsons ===
[[Talcott Parsons]] was the first to formulate a systematic theory of social systems, which he did as a part of his [[AGIL paradigm]]. He defined a social system as only a segment (or a "subsystem") of what he called [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social System|last=Parsons|first=Talcott|publisher=Routledge|year=1951|isbn=0-203-99295-4|location=England|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons organized social systems in terms of action units, where one action executed by an individual is one unit. He defines a social system as a network of interactions between actors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Parsons, social systems rely on a system of language, and [[culture]] must exist in a society in order for it to qualify as a social system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Parsons' work laid the foundations for the rest of the study of social systems theory and ignited the debate over what framework social systems should be built around, such as actions, communication, or other relationships.

=== Niklas Luhmann ===
[[Niklas Luhmann]] was a prominent sociologist and social systems theorist who laid the foundations of modern social system thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambriapress.com/cambriapress.cfm?template=4&amp;bid=339|title=Observing Society: Meaning, Communication, and Social Systems  By Daniel B. Lee and Achim Brosziewski|website=www.cambriapress.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He based his definition of a "social system" on the mass network of communication between people and defined society itself as an "autopoietic" system, meaning a self-referential and self-reliant system that is distinct from its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMlvNXfpxfoC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=social+systems&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9Tk1wDUDhX&amp;sig=JWsWpj5thEmyB7Afc3fu-JBTbK4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKj8uipq3UAhVi2IMKHZGlDtg4HhDoAQhXMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20systems&amp;f=false|title=Luhmann's "social Systems" Theory: Preliminary Fragments for a Theory of Translation|last=Vermeer|first=Hans J.|date=2006|publisher=Frank &amp; Timme GmbH|isbn=9783865961020|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luhmann considered social systems as belonging to three categories: societal systems, organizations, and interaction systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayrhofer|first=Wolfgang|date=2004|title=Social Systems Theory as Theoretical Framework for Human Resource Management – Benediction or Curse?|jstor=41783463|journal=Management Revue|volume=15|issue=2|pages=178–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luhmann considered societal systems, such as religion, law, art, education, science, etc., to be closed systems consisting of different fields of interaction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Niklas Luhmann and Organizational Studies|last=David Seidl|first=Kai Helge Becker|publisher=CBS press|year=2013|isbn=978-87-630-0304-9|location=Denmark|pages=35–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations were defined as a network of decisions which reproduce themselves; his definition is difficult to apply in terms of finding a real-world example.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, interaction systems are systems that reproduce themselves on the basis of communication rather than decision making.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Jay Wright Forrester ===
[[Jay Wright Forrester]] founded the field of [[system dynamics]], which deals with the simulation of interactions in dynamic systems. In his work on social systems, he discusses the possibilities of social system dynamics, or modeling social systems using computers with the aim of testing the possible effects of passing new public policies or laws. In his paper he recognized the difficulty of producing a reliable computer model system, but argued that an imperfect model was better than none and simply implementing new policy.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.constitution.org/ps/cbss.htm|title=Jay W. Forrester: Counterintuitive Behavior of Social Systems|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forrester argued that unsuccessful public policies aim to treat the symptoms rather than the causes of social issues and that they also generally focus on  rather than  efforts. This occurs because there is either an incomplete understanding or a misunderstanding of the causes of an issue on the part of the policymakers, which often leads to ineffective or detrimental policies which aggravate the issues they were implemented to correct or cause other issues to arise. Another problem Forrester notes is that some policies which may work in the long run may aggravate an issue in the short run. A successful policy according to Forrester must target the correct leverage points, in this case the aspect of the social problem which, if modified, will produce a sizeable enough effect to correct the problem.

== Modeling ==
One significant problem with studying social systems is the difficulty of forming and testing theories; social systems are not easily manipulated or controlled and large-scale systems cannot be reproduced in a lab setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=JACKSON|first=MICHAEL C.|date=1985-01-01|title=Social Systems Theory and Practice: The Need for a Critical Approach|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03081078508934877|journal=International Journal of General Systems|volume=10|issue=2-3|pages=135–151|doi=10.1080/03081078508934877|issn=0308-1079}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rapid increase in the availability of digital [[data]] over the last decade gives scientists studying the behaviors of social systems very detailed and much more holistic pictures of how social systems respond to various events and how networked social systems behave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vespignani|first=Alessandro|date=24 July 2009|title=Predicting the Behavior of Techno-Social Systems|url=http://www.gleamviz.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/science2009.pdf|journal=Science|volume=325|pages=425–428|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the development and popularity of social media platforms such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] offer new ways to study the evolution of social systems and social networking behaviors with [[social graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thesystemsthinker.com/extending-systems-thinking-to-social-systems/|title=Extending Systems Thinking to Social Systems - The Systems Thinker|date=2016-01-23|work=The Systems Thinker|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the behaviors of these systems may be surprising or not yet well understood, the digital age offers a new frontier for the study of social systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/multimedia/simons-science-series/online-social-systems/|title=Online Social Systems {{!}} Simons Foundation|website=www.simonsfoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable past models are the WORLD2 and [[World3|WORLD3]] models: these both aimed to outline the world's distribution of resources. WORLD3 was based on the [[Club of Rome]]'s ''[[The Limits to Growth|Limits to Growth]].''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16300">'''Surveillance capitalism''' is a [[History of capitalism|novel]] market form and a specific logic of [[capitalism|capitalist]] accumulation that was first described in a 2014 essay by business theorist and social scientist [[Shoshana Zuboff]]. She characterized it as a "radically disembedded and extractive variant of information capitalism" based on the [[commodification]] of "reality" and its transformation into behavioral data for analysis and sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/1.3152525|title=A Digital Declaration: Big Data as Surveillance Capitalism|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|date=15 September 2014|work=FAZ.NET|access-date=2018-08-28|language=de|issn=0174-4909|id=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshan-zuboff-on-big-data-as-surveillance-capitalism-13152525.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powles|first1=Julia|title=Google and Microsoft have made a pact to protect surveillance capitalism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/02/google-microsoft-pact-antitrust-surveillance-capitalism|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sterling|first1=Bruce|title=Shoshanna Zuboff condemning Google "surveillance capitalism"|url=https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2016/03/shoshanna-zuboff-condemning-google-surveillance-capitalism/|publisher=WIRED|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/magazine/facebook-google-privacy-data.html|title=The Unlikely Activists Who Took On Silicon Valley — and Won|last=|first=|date=14 August 2018|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a subsequent 2015 scholarly article, Zuboff analyzed the societal implications of this [[Creative destruction|mutation]] of capitalism. She differentiated "surveillance assets", "surveillance capital", and "surveillance capitalism" and their dependence on a global architecture of computer mediation that she calls "Big Other", a distributed and largely uncontested new expression of power which constitutes hidden mechanisms of extraction, commodification, and control that threatens core values such as [[Free will|freedom]], [[democracy|democracy,]] and [[privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|date=4 April 2015|title=Big other: surveillance capitalism and the prospects of an information civilization|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2594754|journal=Journal of Information Technology|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=75–89|doi=10.1057/jit.2015.5|issn=0268-3962|id=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2594754|via=SSRN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theconversation1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/the-price-of-connection-surveillance-capitalism-64124|title=The price of connection: 'surveillance capitalism'|last1=Couldry|first1=Nick|date=23 September 2016|publisher=The Conversation|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Zuboff, surveillance capitalism was pioneered at [[Google]] and later [[Facebook]], in much the same way that [[mass-production]] and managerial capitalism were pioneered at [[Ford]] and [[General Motors]] a century earlier, and has now become the dominant form of information capitalism.&lt;ref name="faz1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshana-zuboff-secrets-of-surveillance-capitalism-14103616.html?printPagedArticle=true|title=Google as a Fortune Teller: The Secrets of Surveillance Capitalism|last1=Zuboff|first1=Shoshana|date=5 March 2016|website=|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|id=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshana-zuboff-secrets-of-surveillance-capitalism-14103616.html?printPagedArticle=true|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In her Oxford University lecture published in 2016, Zuboff identified surveillance capitalism's mechanisms and practices, including the manufacture of "prediction products" for sale in new "behavioral futures markets". She introduced the concept "dispossession by [[surveillance]]" and argued that it challenges the psychological and political bases of [[Self-determination theory|self-determination]] as it concentrates rights in the surveillance regime. This is described as a "coup from above".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/1.4103616|title=Google as a Fortune Teller: The Secrets of Surveillance Capitalism|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|date=5 March 2016|work=FAZ.NET|access-date=2018-08-28|language=de|issn=0174-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Economic pressures of capitalism are driving the intensification of connection and monitoring online with spaces of social life becoming open to saturation by corporate actors, directed at the making of profit and/or the regulation of action.&lt;ref name=theconversation1/&gt; Relevantly, Turow writes that "centrality of [[corporate capitalism|corporate power]] is a direct reality at the very heart of the [[digital age]]". &lt;ref name="theconversation1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turow|first1=Joseph|title=The Daily You: How the New Advertising Industry Is Defining Your Identity and Your Worth|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300165013|date= 10 January 2012|pages=256|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=m9_DyhPGhEMC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}} [[Capitalism]] has become focused on expanding the proportion of social life that is open to [[data collection]] and data processing.&lt;ref name=theconversation1/&gt; This may come with significant implications for vulnerability and control of society as well as for privacy. However, increased data collection may also have various advantages for individuals and society such as self-optimization ([[Quantified Self]]),&lt;ref name=theconversation1/&gt; societal optimizations (such as by [[smart cities]]) and new or optimized services (such as various Google applications). Still, collecting and processing data in the context of capitalism's core [[profit motive|profit-making motive]] might present an inherent danger.

Zuboff contrasts [[mass production]] of [[industrial capitalism]] with surveillance capitalism with the former being interdependent with its populations who were its consumers and employees and the latter preying on dependent populations who are neither its consumers nor its employees and largely ignorant of its procedures.&lt;ref name=faz1/&gt;

She notes that surveillance capitalism reaches beyond the conventional institutional terrain of the private firm and accumulates not only surveillance assets and capital, but also rights and operates without meaningful mechanisms of consent.&lt;ref name=faz1/&gt; Surveillance has been changing power structures in the information economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galič|first1=Maša|last2=Timan|first2=Tjerk|last3=Koops|first3=Bert-Jaap|title=Bentham, Deleuze and Beyond: An Overview of Surveillance Theories from the Panopticon to Participation|journal=Philosophy &amp; Technology|date=13 May 2016|doi=10.1007/s13347-016-0219-1|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This might present a further power shift beyond the nation-state and towards a form of [[corporatocracy]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

[[Oliver Stone]], creator of the film ''[[Snowden (film)|Snowden]]'' pointed to the [[location-based game]] ''[[Pokémon Go]]'' as the "latest sign of the emerging phenomenon of surveillance capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comic-Con 2016: Marvel turns focus away from the Avengers, 'Game of Thrones' cosplay proposals, and more|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-hc-comic-con-updates-oliver-stone-calls-pokemon-go-1469130980-htmlstory.html|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliver Stone Calls Pokémon Go "Totalitarian"|url=http://fortune.com/2016/07/23/oliver-stone-calls-pokemon-go-totalitarian/|publisher=Fortune|date=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Surveillance capitalism, robot totalitarianism’: Oliver Stone lashes out at Pokemon Go|url=https://www.rt.com/usa/352782-pokemon-snowden-oliver-stone/|publisher=RT International|date=22 July 2016|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Vincent Mosco referred to the marketing of information about customers and subscribers to advertisers ''surveillance capitalism'' and makes note of the [[surveillance state]] alongside it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mosco|first1=Vincent|title=To the Cloud: Big Data in a Turbulent World|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317250388|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=YwbvCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Fuchs found that the surveillance state fuses with surveillance capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fuchs|first1=Christian|title=Social Media: A Critical Introduction|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781473987494|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=m3oEDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA204|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Zuboff informs that the issue is further complicated by highly invisible collaborative arrangements with state security apparatuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shoshana Zuboff / Keynote: Reality is the Next Big Thing - Elevate Festival 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QwPHinDdOc?t=12m30s|website=YouTube|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Trebor Scholz, companies recruit people as informants for this type of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scholz|first1=Trebor|title=Uberworked and Underpaid: How Workers Are Disrupting the Digital Economy|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781509508181|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=LiDNDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT128|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "surveillance capitalism" has also been used by [[Political economy|political economists]] [[John Bellamy Foster]] and [[Robert W. McChesney]], though with a different meaning. In an article published in ''[[Monthly Review]]'' in 2014, they apply it to describe the manifestation of the "insatiable need for data" of [[financialization]], which they explain is "the long-term growth speculation on financial assets relative to [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]" introduced in the United States by industry and government in the 1980s that evolved out of the [[Military–industrial complex|military-industrial complex]] and the [[advertising]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2014/07/01/surveillance-capitalism/|title=Surveillance Capitalism {{!}} John Bellamy Foster {{!}} Monthly Review|date=2014-07-01|work=Monthly Review|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key features==
Zuboff identifies four key features in the logic of surveillance capitalism and explicitly follows the four key features identified by Google's chief economist, [[Hal Varian]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Danaher|first1=John|title=The Logic of Surveillance Capitalism|url=https://algocracy.wordpress.com/2016/03/21/the-logic-of-surveillance-capitalism/|website=Algocracy and the Transhumanist Project|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=|date=February 2017}}
&lt;!--https://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.de/2015/06/the-logic-of-surveillance-capitalism.html--&gt;
# The drive toward more and more data extraction and analysis.
# The development of new contractual forms using computer-monitoring and automation.
# The desire to personalize and customize the services offered to users of digital platforms.
# The use of the technological infrastructure to carry out continual experiments on its users and consumers.

==Countermeasures and solutions==
Numerous organizations have been struggling for [[free speech]] and [[privacy rights]] in the new surveillance capitalism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foster|first1=John Bellamy|last2=McChesney|first2=Robert W.|title=Surveillance Capitalism by John Bellamy Foster|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2014/07/01/surveillance-capitalism/|publisher=Monthly Review|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various national governments have enacted [[privacy law]]s. It is also conceivable that new capabilities and uses for mass-surveillance require structural changes towards a new system to prevent misuse.

Zuboff compares demanding privacy from surveillance capitalists or lobbying for an end to commercial surveillance on the Internet to asking [[Henry Ford]] to make each [[Ford Model T|Model T]] by hand and states that such demands are existential threats that violate the basic mechanisms of the entity's survival.&lt;ref name=faz1/&gt;

Zuboff warns that principles of self-determination might forfeit due to "ignorance, learned helplessness, inattention, inconvenience, habituation, or drift" and states that "we tend to rely on mental models, vocabularies, and tools distilled from past catastrophes", referring to the twentieth century's [[totalitarian]] nightmares or the [[monopolistic]] predations of [[Gilded Age]] capitalism with countermeasures that have been developed to fight those earlier threats not being sufficient or even appropriate for the novel challenges.&lt;ref name=faz1/&gt;

She also poses the question: "will we be the masters of information, or will we be its slaves?" and states that "if the digital future is to be our home, then it is we who must make it so".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zuboff|first1=Shoshana|title=Shoshana Zuboff: A Digital Declaration|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshan-zuboff-on-big-data-as-surveillance-capitalism-13152525.html|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Buddhist philosophy, '''Svasaṃvedana''' (also ''Svasaṃvitti'') is a term which refers to the self-reflexive nature of [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams. ''The Reflexive Nature of Awareness: A Tibetan Madhyamaka Defence'', pg. xi. Curzon press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially a theory of [[cognition]] held by the [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahasamghika]] and [[Sautrāntika|Sautrantika]] schools while the [[Sarvastivada]]-[[Vaibhāṣika|Vaibhasika]] school argued against it.

The idea was famously defended by the Indian philosopher [[Dignaga]], and is an important doctrinal term in Indian [[Mahayana]] thought and [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. It is also often translated as self cognition or self [[apperception]]. 

== Sources in the Buddhist schools ==
According to Zhihua Yao, the theory was first presented by the [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahasamghika]] school. Their view was preserved in the [[Sarvastivada]] compendium of [[Abhidharma]] called [[Mahavibhasa|Maha-Vibhasa]] and states:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the nature (''[[svabhava]]'') of awareness (''[[Jnana|jñana]]'') and so forth to apprehend, thus awareness can apprehend itself as well as others. This is like a lamp that can illuminate itself and others owing to its nature of luminosity.&lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The issue is also discussed in the Theravadin [[Kathavatthu|Katthavatthu]] (section V.9) in a dialogue between a Theravadin and an Andhaka (the Mahasamghikas in the [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] region).&lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; In the dialogue, the Andhaka is asked by the Theravadin if one knows an awareness of the present ''by that same awareness.'' The Andhaka first denies this, but then affirms it when asked again. In the commentary to the Katthavatthu, [[Buddhaghoṣa|Buddhaghosa]] explains this because "continuity is concerned", thus if seen by itself a mind moment cannot know itself but in a continuous stream of mind moments it can thus be said.&lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravadin counters with the argument that the other aggregates like feeling do not feel themselves and uses similes like a knife that cannot cut itself or a needle that does not pierce itself. The Andhaka then recovers by making the following argument for his position of self cognition:&lt;blockquote&gt;But, when all phenomena are seen as impermanent, is not that awareness also seen as impermanent?&lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Sarvastivada sources which discuss self-cognition mainly do so in order to refute the idea that a mind moment can know itself in that moment. These include the [[Jnanaprasthana|Jñanaprasthana]] and [[Mahavibhasa]]. &lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; However that does not mean the Sarvastivadins reject all theories of self cognition, they developed their own theory which argued that mind moments know themselves only reflexively in regards to the previous mind moments. As Zhihua Yao states, "in other words, the mind knows itself through a ''reflection'' of the past mind".&lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The Sarvastivadins use their metaphysical theory of the real existence of the past, present and future to allow for a present mind to take a past mind as itself.

Sautrantika authors also discussed the theory. It was extensively covered by the Harivarman, the author of the [[Tattvasiddhi|Tattvasiddhishastra]], and shows that he was in a dialogue with both Sarvastivada and Mahasamghika views.&lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Harivarman's view argues against the Mahasamghika's simultaenous model of self-cognition and instead argues that self-cognition is only seen in the course of successive moments of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; That is, it involves multiple mental processes which Harivarman considers as happening in the "present continuum" and is not a case of a single mind moment knowing itself but is a case of the mind grasping the "image" (''akara'') of itself as it is fading away. &lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; This is also part of his account of how memory works.

The Buddhist philosopher [[Dignāga|Dignaga]] also defended a theory of ''svasamvedana'' drawing on Sautrantika and Yogacara influences. For Dignaga, ''svasamvedana'' is a kind of perception (''pratyaksa'') which is an "internal awareness of mental consciousness" and his theory of perception also entails that it is non-conceptual (unlike the other source of valid cognition, ''anumana -'' inference).&lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 131, 138&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Mahayana scholasticism==
Svasaṃvedana is at the root of a major doctrinal disagreement in Indian Mahayana Buddhism. While defended by the [[Yogacara]] thinkers such as [[Dharmakirti]] and the eclectic [[Santaraksita]], it was attacked by '[[Prasangika]] [[Madhyamika]]' thinkers such as [[Candrakirti]] and [[Santideva]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams. ''The Reflexive Nature of Awareness: A Tibetan Madhyamaka Defence'', pg. xiii. Curzon press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Since in [[Mādhyamika]] thought all [[dharmas]] are [[Shunyata|empty]] of inherent essence ([[Svabhava]]), they argued that consciousness could not be an inherently reflexive ultimate reality since that would mean it was self validating and therefore not characterized by [[emptiness]].

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] there are various competing views regarding svasaṃvedana (Tibetan: Ranggi rig pa). 

In the [[Nyingma]] school's [[Dzogchen]] tradition, svasaṃvedana is often called 'the very nature of mind' (sems kyi chos nyid) and metaphorically referred to as '[[Luminous mind|luminosity]]' (''gsal ba'') or 'clear light' (''[[Ösel (yoga)|'od gsal]]''). A common Tibetan metaphor for this reflexivity is that of a lamp in a dark room which in the act of illuminating objects in the room also illuminates itself. [[Dzogchen]] meditative practices aim to bring the mind to direct realization of this luminous nature. In [[Dzogchen]] (as well as some [[Mahamudra]] traditions) Svasaṃvedana is seen as the primordial substratum or ground (gdod ma'i gzhi) of mind. 

Following [[Je Tsongkhapa]]'s (1357–1419) interpretation of the [[Prasaṅgika]] [[Madhyamaka]] view, the [[Gelug]] school completely denies both the conventional and the ultimate existence of reflexive awareness. This is one of Tsongkhapa's "eight difficult points" that distinguish the [[Prasaṅgika]] view from others.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams. ''The Reflexive Nature of Awareness: A Tibetan Madhyamaka Defence'', pg. xv. Curzon press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nyingma]] philosopher [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso]] (1846–1912) defended the conventional existence of reflexive awareness as per the [[Madhyamaka]] [[two truths doctrine]]. According to Mipham, the Prasangika critique of reflexive awareness only applied to its ultimate inherent reality and not its conventional status.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams. ''The Reflexive Nature of Awareness: A Tibetan Madhyamaka Defence'', pg. xvi. Curzon press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''symbols and conventions used in [[welding]] documentation''' are specified in national and international standards such as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 2553 ''Welded, brazed and soldered joints -- Symbolic representation on drawings'' and ISO 4063 ''Welding and allied processes -- Nomenclature of processes and reference numbers''. The US standard symbols are outlined by the [[American National Standards Institute]] and the [[American Welding Society]] and are noted as "ANSI/AWS".&lt;ref name=greg&gt;{{cite book|author1=E. N. Gregory|author2=Ann A. Armstrong|title=Welding symbols on drawings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X9cxdD6GfdIC&amp;pg=PR7|accessdate=10 October 2011|date=20 April 2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-3591-4|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due in part to the growth of the oil industry, this symbol set was used during the 1990s in about 50% of the world's welding operations.&lt;ref name=greg/&gt; An ISO committee sought to establish a global standard during this decade.&lt;ref name=greg/&gt;

In [[engineering drawing]]s, each weld is conventionally identified by an arrow which points to the joint to be welded.  The arrow is annotated with letters, numbers and symbols which indicate the exact specification of the weld. In complex applications, such as those involving [[alloy]]s other than [[Carbon steel|mild steel]], more information may be called for than can comfortably be indicated using the symbols alone.&lt;ref name=greg/&gt; Annotations are used in these cases.&lt;ref name=greg/&gt;

==Component elements==
[[File:Elements of a welding symbol.PNG|thumb|right|350px|The location of the elements of a welding symbol when following US conventions.]]
In the US, the component elements of the weld specification are:&lt;ref name=TC9237&gt;{{citation |title=Welding Theory and Application |publisher=Department of the Army |date=7 May 1993 |number=Training Circular 9-237 |url=https://armypubs.us.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_aa/pdf/tc9_237.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The reference line - the body of the arrow which is the baseline for the specification.
# The arrow tip which goes at an angle to the reference line, pointing to the joint to be welded.
# The tail which goes at the other end of the reference line.
# The basic welding symbol which goes on the reference line to indicate the shape of the weld such as a fillet or plug.  The symbol is placed on the arrow side or other side of the line to indicate which side of the joint the weld goes.
# The dimensions and other numbers such as the length of the weld or number of spot welds go above and below the reference line.
# Supplementary symbols go at the junction of the reference line and the arrow tip.  One  such symbol is a circle to indicate an all-around weld, which goes on every side of the joint.
# Finish symbols go above the reference line to indicate the surface contour or finish of the weld such as flush, convex or concave.
# Letters indicating the welding process are placed at the tail end, such as AHW for [[atomic hydrogen welding]].  Further examples include:

[[File:NUEVA (ingles).svg|thumb|284x284px|Overhead View of the Ten-Ray Model (Types of reflections)]]

The ten-ray model is a model applied to the transmissions in the urban area, to generate a model of ten rays typically four rays more are added to the  [[Six rays model|six rays model]], these are (&lt;math&gt;R3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R4&lt;/math&gt; bouncing on both sides of the wall); This incorporate paths from one to three reflections: specifically, there is the LOS ([[Line-of-sight propagation|Line of sight]]), GR (ground reflected), SW (single-wall reflected), DW (double-wall reflected), TW (triple-wall reflected), WG (wall-ground reflected) and GW (ground-wall reflected paths). Where each one of the paths bounces on both sides of the wall.

Experimentally, it has been demonstrated that the ten ray model simulates or can represent the  [[Radio propagation|propagation]] of signals through a [[Dielectric|dielectric]] canyon, in it which the rays that travel from a [[Transmitter|transmitter]]   point to a receiver point bounce many times.

As example for this model it is assume: a rectilinear free space with two walls, one upper and the other lower, from which two vertical bases are positioned at their ends, these are the transmitting and receiving [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] that it’s locate in such a way that their heights don’t surpass the limits of the top wall; Achieved this the structure acts as free space for its functioning similar to that of a dielectric canyon of signals propagation, since the rays transmitted from the transmitting antenna will collide each side of the upper and lower walls infinity of times (for this example up to 3 reflections) until reaching the receiving antenna. During the course of the rays for each reflection they suffer, part of the energy of the signal is dissipated in each reflection, normally after the third reflection of said ray its resulting component which is a retro-reflected ray is insignificant with a negligible energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wireless Communications.|last=Goldsmith|first=Andrea|publisher=Cambridge University Press, ed.|year=2005|isbn=978-0521837163|location=New York.|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Mathematical deduction ==


=== Analysis for antennas of heights different heights located in street's any point ===

For the [[mathematical modeling]] of the propagation of ten rays, One has in account a side view and this starts off modeling the two first rays (line by sight and his respective reflection), Considering that antennas have different heights, Then &lt;math&gt;h_{Tx}\neq{h_{Rx}}&lt;/math&gt;, and they have a direct distance d that separates the two antennas; The first ray is formed applying Pitágoras theorem:

: &lt;math&gt;R_0=\sqrt{d^2+(h_t-h_r)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The second ray or the reflected ray is made in a similar way to the first, but in this case the heights of the antennas to form the right angled triangle for the reflection of the height of the transmitter are added up.

: &lt;math&gt;R_0' =\sqrt{d^2+(h_t+h_r)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

In the deduction of the third ray it is necessary find the angle between the direct distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and the distance of line of view &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt;'''&lt;sub&gt;.&lt;/sub&gt;'''

: &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta=\frac{h_t-h_r}{R_0}&lt;/math&gt;

Viewing the model with a side view, it is necessary to find a flat distance between the transmitter and receiver called  &lt;math&gt;d'&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;d'=\sqrt{d^2-(w_{r2}-w_{t2})^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we deduce the remaining height of the wall from the height of the receiver called  &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; by the similarity of triangles:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac z a =\frac{h_t}{d'}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; z =\frac{ {h_t}a }{d'}&lt;/math&gt;

By likeness of triangles we can deduce the distance from where collides the ray to wall until the perpendicular of the receiver called &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, getting:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac a d' = \frac{w_{r2}}{w_{t2}+w_{r2}} &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{d'w_{r2}}{w_{t2}+w_{r2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The third ray is defined as a model of two-rays, by which is:

: &lt;math&gt;R_1=\frac{\sqrt{(h_t-h_r-z)^2+(d'-a)^2}+\sqrt{z^2+a^2}}{\cos\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking a side view it is achieves to evidence the reflected ray that there in &lt;math&gt;R_{1}&lt;/math&gt;  and is find as following manner:

: &lt;math&gt;R_1' =\frac{\sqrt{(h_t+h_r+z)^2+(d'-a)^2}+\sqrt{(2h_r+z)^2+a^2}}{\cos\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

As exist two rays that collide once on the wall, then is find the fifth ray, equating it to the third.

: &lt;math&gt;R_2=R_1 &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, is equalized the sixth ray with the fourth ray, since they have the same characteristics.

: &lt;math&gt;R_2'=R_1'&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Grafica 3 me ingles.svg|thumb|311x311px|Side view of two transmitted beams reflected from one wall to the other side and reflected to the receiver on antennas of different heights at any point on the street.]]

To model the rays that collide with the wall twice, is used the Pythagoras theorem because of the direct distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and the sum of the distances between the receiver to each wall with double of distance of the transmitter to the wall  &lt;math&gt;w_{t2}&lt;/math&gt;, this divides on the angle formed between the direct distance and the reflected ray.

: &lt;math&gt;R_3=\frac{\sqrt{d^2+(w_{r2}+2w_{t2}+w_{r1})^2}}{\cos\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

For the eighth ray is calculate a series of variables that allow to deduce the complete equation, which is composed by distances and heights that were found by likeness of triangles'''.'''

In first instance is take the flat distance between the wall of the second shock and the receiver:

: &lt;math&gt;x=\frac{d' w_{r1}}{w_{r2}+w_{r1}}&lt;/math&gt;

Is found the flat distance between the transmitter and the wall in the first shock.

: &lt;math&gt;h_{p2}=h_r+z_2&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;y=\frac{d'w_{t2}}{w_{r2}+w_{r1}}&lt;/math&gt;

Finding the distance between the height of the wall of the second shock with respect to the first shock, is obtain:

: &lt;math&gt;z_1=\frac{h_t(d'-(x+y))}{d'}&lt;/math&gt;

Deducing also the distance between the height of the wall of the second shock with respect to the receiver:

: &lt;math&gt;z_{2}=\frac{h_t x}{d'}&lt;/math&gt;

Calculating the height of the wall where occurs the first hit:

: &lt;math&gt;h_{p1}=h_r+z_1+z_2&lt;/math&gt;

Calculating the height of the wall where occurs the second shock:

: &lt;math&gt;h_{p2}=h_r+z_2&lt;/math&gt;

With these parameters is calculate the equation for the eighth ray:

: &lt;math&gt;R_3'=\frac{\sqrt{y^2+(h_t+h_{p1})^2}+\sqrt{(d'-(x+y))^2+(h_{p1}+h_{p2}^2}+\sqrt{x^2+(h_r+h_{p2})^2}}{\cos\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

For the ninth ray, equation is the same as the seventh ray due to its characteristics:

: &lt;math&gt;R_4=R_3&lt;/math&gt;

For the tenth ray, the equation is the same as the eighth ray due to its reflected ray shape:

: &lt;math&gt;R_4'=R_3'&lt;/math&gt;

=== Losses for trajectory of free space ===
[[File:Perdidas_10_rayos.jpg|thumb|276x276px|Modeling of the losses by free space trajectory in the 6-ray model when the distances of the wall and the heights are different.]]
Is considered a signal transmitted through free space to a receiver located at a distance ''d'' from the transmitter.

Assuming there are no obstacles between the transmitter and the receiver, the signal propagates along a straight line between the two. The beam model associated with this transmission is denominated line of sight (LOS), and the signal received corresponding is called the LOS signal or beam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wireless &amp; Cellular Communications Class Notes for TLEN-5510-Fall.|last=Schwengler|first=Thomas|publisher=Universidad de Colorado.|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=http://morse.colorado.edu/~tlen5510/text/classwebch3.html|quote=Chapter 3: Radio Propagation Modeling|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A literary '''trope''' is the use of [[figurative language]], via word, phrase or an image, for artistic effect such as using a [[figure of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|year=1990|title=Tropes, Parables, and Performatives|publisher=Duke University Press|page=9|isbn= 0822311119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''trope'' has also come to be used for describing commonly recurring [[Literary technique|literary]] and [[rhetorical device]]s,&lt;ref name=cuddon&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J. A.|first2=C. E.|last2=Preston|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory|edition=4|year=1998|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=9780140513639|page=948|chapter=Trope}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[motif (narrative)|motifs]] or [[cliché]]s in creative works.&lt;ref name="trope_mw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|chapter=trope (revised entry)|year=2014|location=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term ''trope'' derives from the Greek {{lang|el|[[wikt:τρόπος|τρόπος]]}} (''tropos''), "turn, direction, way", derived from the verb τρέπειν (''trepein''), "to turn, to direct, to alter, to change".&lt;ref name="trope_mw"&gt;{{citation|title=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|chapter=trope|year=2009|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trope|accessdate=2009-10-16|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|location=[[Springfield, Massachusetts]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropes and their classification were an important field in [[Rhetoric|classical rhetoric]]. The study of tropes has been taken up again in modern criticism, especially in [[deconstruction]].&lt;ref name="childers"/&gt; Tropological criticism (not to be confused with [[tropological reading]], a type of biblical [[exegesis]]) is the historical study of tropes, which aims to "define the dominant tropes of an epoch" and to "find those tropes in literary and non-literary texts", an interdisciplinary investigation of which [[Michel Foucault]] was an "important exemplar".&lt;ref name="childers"/&gt;

==In medieval writing==
A specialized use is the medieval [[Amplification (rhetoric)|amplification]] of texts from the liturgy, such as in the ''[[Kyrie|Kyrie Eleison]]'' (''Kyrie, / magnae Deus potentia, / liberator hominis, / transgressoris mandati, / eleison''). The most important example of such a trope is the ''[[Quem quaeritis?]]'', an amplification before the ''[[Introit]]'' of the [[Easter Sunday]] service and the source for [[liturgical drama]].&lt;ref name=cuddon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J. A.|first2=C. E.|last2=Preston|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory|edition=4|year=1998|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=9780140513639|page=721|chapter=Quem quaeritis trope}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular practice came to an end with the [[Tridentine Mass]], the unification of the liturgy in 1570 promulgated by [[Pope Pius V]].&lt;ref name="childers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Childers|first1=Joseph|last2=Hentzi|first2=Gary|title=The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism|year=1995|publisher=Columbia UP|location=New York|isbn=9780231072434|page=309|chapter=Trope}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and examples==
[[Rhetoric]]ians have closely analyzed the great variety of "twists and turns" used in [[poetry]] and [[literature]] and have provided an extensive list of precise labels for these poetic devices. These include:

* [[Allegory]] – A sustained metaphor continued through whole sentences or even through a whole discourse. For example: "The ship of state has sailed through rougher storms than the tempest of these lobbyists."
* [[Antanaclasis]] – The stylistic trope of repeating a single word, but with a different meaning each time; antanaclasis is a common type of [[pun]], and like other kinds of pun, it is often found in slogans.
*[[Hyperbole]]
*[[Irony]] – Creating a trope through implying the opposite of the standard meaning, such as describing a bad situation as "good times".
*[[Litotes]]
* [[Metaphor]] – An explanation of an object or idea through juxtaposition of disparate things with a similar characteristic, such as describing a courageous person as having a "heart of a lion".
* [[Metonymy]] – A trope through proximity or correspondence. For example, referring to actions of the U.S. President as "actions of the White House".
*[[Oxymoron]]
*[[Synecdoche]] – Related to metonymy and metaphor, creates a play on words by referring to something with a related concept: for example, referring to the whole with the name of a part, such as "hired hands" for workers; a part with the name of the whole, such as "the law" for police officers; the general with the specific, such as "bread" for food; the specific with the general, such as "cat" for a lion; or an object with its substance, such as "bricks and mortar" for a building.

For a longer list, see [[Figure of speech#Tropes|Figure of speech: Tropes]].

[[Kenneth Burke]] has called metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche and irony the "four master tropes".&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;

{{Other uses|Valence (disambiguation)}}

'''Valence''', as used in psychology, especially in discussing [[emotion]]s, means the intrinsic [[pleasure|attractiveness]]/"good"-ness (positive valence) or [[suffering|averseness]]/"bad"-ness (negative valence) of an event, object, or situation.&lt;ref&gt;Nico H. Frijda, The Emotions. Cambridge(UK): Cambridge University Press, 1986. p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; The term also characterizes and categorizes specific emotions. For example, emotions popularly referred to as "negative", such as [[anger]] and [[fear]], have ''negative valence''. [[Joy]] has ''positive valence''. Positively valenced emotions are evoked by positively valenced events, objects, or situations. The term is also used to describe the '''hedonic tone''' of [[feeling]]s, [[affect (psychology)|affect]], certain [[behavior]]s (for example, approach and avoidance), goal attainment or nonattainment, and conformity with or violation of [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]. [[Ambivalence]] can be viewed as conflict between positive and negative valence-carriers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Theorists taking a valence-based approach to studying affect, judgment, and choice posit that emotions with the same valence (e.g., anger and fear or [[pride]] and [[Surprise_(emotion)|surprise]]) produce a similar influence on judgments and choices.
Stress is negative valence and opposite of this is pleasure or happiness. Stress can mean all unpleasant emotions.

==History of usage==
The term entered English in psychology with the translation from German ("Valenz") in 1935 of works of [[Kurt Lewin]]. Ambivalence has a longer history.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Criterion for emotion==
Valence is one criterion used in some definitions of emotion. The possible absence of valence is cited as a reason to exclude [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]] from the list of emotions, though some would include it.

==Measurement==
Valence could be assigned a number and treated as if it were measured, but the validity of a [[measurement]] based on a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] report is questionable. Measurement based on observations of facial expressions, using the [[Facial Action Coding System]] and [[microexpressions]] (see [[Paul Ekman]]) or muscle activity detected through [[facial electromyography]], or on modern functional [[brain imaging]] may overcome this objection. Emotional valence is represented in right posterior superior temporal sulcus and medial prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kliemann|first=Dorit|last2=Jacoby|first2=Nir|last3=Anzellotti|first3=Stefano|last4=Saxe|first4=Rebecca R.|date=2016-11-16|title=Decoding task and stimulus representations in face-responsive cortex|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02643294.2016.1256873|journal=[[Cognitive Neuropsychology (journal)|Cognitive Neuropsychology]] |volume=33|issue=7–8|pages=362–377|doi=10.1080/02643294.2016.1256873|issn=0264-3294|pmid=27978778|pmc=5673491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of some 12 to 13 million inhabitants in the area, it is estimated  that 48 per cent understand Occitan, 28 per cent can speak it, about 9 per cent of the population use it on a daily basis, 13 per cent can read and 6 per cent can write the language.'&lt;/ref&gt;

==16th to 18th century==
Beginning in 1539 with Art. 111 of the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/villers-cotterets.asp Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêt]&lt;/ref&gt; non-French languages in France were reduced in stature when it became compulsory "to deliver and execute all [legal] acts in the French language" (''de prononcer et expedier tous actes en langaige françoys''). Originally meant as a way to eliminate [[Latin]] in official documents — few 16th-century French subjects were educated and familiar with Latin — it also stated that French and only French was legal in the kingdom (''en langage maternel françoys et non aultrement'').

==Late 18th to late 19th century==
===Abbé Grégoire's "Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois"===
The deliberate process of eradicating non-French [[vernacular]]s in modern France and disparaging them as mere local and often strictly oral dialects was formalized with [[Henri Grégoire]]'s ''Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalise the use of the French language'',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.languefrancaise.net/dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=66 |title=Abbé Grégoire's ''Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalize the use of the French language'' |access-date=2008-04-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405022802/http://www.languefrancaise.net/dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=66 |archive-date=2008-04-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which he presented on June 4, 1794 to the [[National Convention]]; thereafter, all languages other than French were officially banned in the administration and schools for the sake of [[linguistics|linguistically]] uniting post-[[Bastille Day]] France. At the time, only one tenth of the population were fluent in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gwalarn.org/brezhoneg/istor/gregoire.html |title=L'Abbé Grégoire en guerre contre les "Patois", Hervé Luxardo, gwalarn.org |access-date=2007-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609025249/http://www.gwalarn.org/brezhoneg/istor/gregoire.html |archive-date=2007-06-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to "patois", [[Jean Jaurès]] famously claimed that "one names ''patois'' the language of a defeated nation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rleb07.free.fr/opinions/vecteur.html A new "Common Vector", Robert L.E. Billon, April 2000, rleb07.free.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Chambers Dictionary]]'', the origin of the term is disputed but could be a "corruption of ''patrois'', from [[Vulgar Latin|LL]] ''patriensis'', a local inhabitant".

Four months earlier (January 27), [[Bertrand Barère]], although an Occitan from [[Tarbes]] himself, claimed before this same Convention:
{{quote|The monarchy had reasons to resemble the [[Tower of Babel]]; in [[democracy]], leaving the citizens to ignore the national language [that of Paris], unable to control the power, is betraying the motherland... For a free people, the tongue must be one and the same for everyone. [...] How much money have we not spent already for the translation of the laws of the first two [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|national assemblies]] in the various dialects of France! As if it were our duty to maintain those barbaric jargons and those coarse lingos that can only serve fanatics and [[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]] now!&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/Europe/france-2politik_francais.htm L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde – La politique linguistique du français, www.tlfq.ulaval.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The end of traditional provinces===
This policy can be noted by the way France's internal borders were redrawn, creating 83 [[Departments of France|''départements'']]. The law was passed on December 22, 1789 and took effect the following year, on March 4, 1790. As a result, the centuries-old singularities of the various Occitan-speaking parts were overlooked and shaken in a deliberate effort by the newly formed government to weaken and parcel out long-established feudal domains so that republican France would subdue traditional allegiances, as [[Antonin Perbòsc]] reveals in the Foreword to his ''Anthologie'':
{{quote|When the ''Constituante'' ([[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]]) created the ''départements'', their goal was clearly to erase the old geographical and historical distinction of the provinces; however this goal was not as perfectly met as some would have liked: in general, the ''départements'' were made up of pieces of existing provinces, quite seldom of the reunion of parts from different provinces. If one could criticize this territorial division for being too arbitrary and too geometric, what can be said of [[Tarn-et-Garonne]], born of a ''sénatus-consule'' (a law by the [[Senate (France)|Senate of France]]) on November 2, 1808? Of course, one may think that the ''Centralisateur'' ([[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]) felt real pleasure showing he could do even better than the ''centralisateurs'' of the National Constituent Assembly. With fragments of [[Quercy]], [[Rouergue]], [[Agen]]ais, [[Lomagne]], [[Gascony]] and [[Languedoc]], creating a new unit so little vast and yet so diverse of soil, language and race, what a great idea! And maybe the audacious half-god had only one regret: coming a little too late to redesign according to this pattern all the provinces of old France...&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Georges Labouysse's ''Histoire de France: L'Imposture. Mensonges et manipulations de l'Histoire officielle'' p. 234. IEO Edicions&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 20th century, the ''départements'' were grouped into ''[[Regions of France|régions]]'', to create a level of government between the departmental and national. While the ''régions'' were intended to replace the old provinces, they were not necessarily formed along the same boundaries. As the map shows, there were eleven Occitan-speaking enclaves in the pre-1789 state, such as the powerful lands of [[Languedoc]] and [[Gascony]], but they were divided into seven ''régions'' with no regard whatsoever for cultural and linguistic identities. This is how [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] was created out of portions of five Occitan provinces and three capitals were scrapped in favour of [[Marseille]]; and [[Auvergne]] came to comprise both native and ''langues d'oïl'' entities. Meanwhile, the city of [[Nantes]] was administratively removed from [[Brittany]], of which it had been one of two traditional capitals (along with [[Rennes]]), and the city of [[Toulouse]] was not included in the ''région'' of [[Languedoc-Roussillon]], though it had historically been located in that province.

Many of the ''régions'' contain hyphenated names, reflecting the merging of multiple historically distinct areas.  This is true for four of the seven ''régions'' of Occitania: Languedoc-Roussillon, [[Midi-Pyrénées]], Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur and [[Rhône-Alpes]].

==Late 19th century – Policies and legacy of Jules Ferry==
===School discipline===
In the 1880s, [[Jules Ferry]] implemented a series of strict measures to further weaken ''regional'' languages in France, as shown in Bernard Poignant's 1998 report to [[Lionel Jospin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chez.com/buan1/poignant.htm LANGUES ET CULTURES REGIONALES – Rapport de Monsieur Bernard Poignant – Maire de Quimper A Monsieur Lionel Jospin – Premier Ministre Le 1er juillet 1998, chez.com]&lt;/ref&gt; These included children being given [[punishments]] by their teachers for speaking Occitan in a [[Toulouse]] school or [[Breton language|Breton]] in [[Brittany]]. Art. 30 of ''Loi d'éducation française'' (French Teaching Law, 1851) stated that: "It is strictly forbidden to speak patois during classes or breaks."

[[File:SpeakFrenchBeClean.jpg|thumb|right|"Speak French, Be Clean" written on the wall of the [[Ayguatébia-Talau]] school]]

Among other well-known humiliations was ''clogging'' young rebels, namely hanging a clog (''sabot'') around their necks as this young lady recalls her grandparents telling her:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~SuuHialat/hialat3c.html |title=Ecoles Diwan, la bosse du breton|last=de la Casinière|first=Nicolas|date=October 1, 1998|language=fr|accessdate=2008-06-28 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/19991014020922/http://members.tripod.com/~SuuHialat/hialat3c.html |archivedate=1999-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My grandparents speak Breton too, though not with me. As children, they used to [[Rulering (punishment)|have their fingers smacked]] if they happened to say a word in Breton. Back then, the French of the Republic, one and indivisible, was to be heard in all schools and those who dared challenge this policy were humiliated with having to wear a clog around their necks or kneel down on a ruler under a sign that read: "It is forbidden to spit on the ground and speak Breton".&lt;ref&gt;[http://bretagne.lalibreblogs.be/media/01/00/3d75e7dbef78f875f7cc337be5138241.jpg An example sign at bretagne.lalibreblogs.be]. The sign reads (in French): "To all school pupils: It is forbidden 1. to speak Breton and spit on the ground; 2. to wet your fingers with your mouth to turn the pages of books and notebooks; 3. to insert the tip of a pen or penholder into your ear; 4. to clean your slates with your spit or directly with your tongue; 5. to hold pens, penholders, coins etc between your lips. Now do you want to know why these things are forbidden? Ask your teachers: they will give you the necessary explanations. And remember your duty is not just to obey these rules but to make sure everyone else applies them."&lt;/ref&gt; That's the reason why some older folks won't transmit the language to their children: it brings trouble upon yourself...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This practice was referred to as [[Symbole|le symbole]] by officials and "la vache" (the cow) by pupils, with offenders becoming "vachards". Many objects were used, not just clogs: horseshoes, shingles, slates, wooden plates with a message, coins with a cross on them. The following are official instructions from a [[Finistère]] sub-prefect to teachers in 1845: "And remember, Gents: you were given your position in order to kill the Breton language."&lt;ref name="France pp. 90-92"&gt;Georges Labouysse in ''Histoire de France: L'Imposture. Mensonges et manipulations de l'Histoire officielle'' pp. 90–92. IEO Edicions&lt;/ref&gt; The prefect of [[Basses-Pyrénées]] in the French [[Northern Basque Country|Basque Country]] wrote in 1846: "Our schools in the Basque Country are particularly meant to substitute the [[Basque language]] with French..."&lt;ref name="France pp. 90-92"/&gt;

Resorting to the practice of ''clogging'' is confirmed by the Autonomes de Solidarité Laïques website:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autonome-solidarite.fr/?fas-usu=tribune&amp;type=politique&amp;id=1497 La neutralité politique, philosophique et religieuse et l’école, Autonomes de Solidarité Laïques website]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
School has had a unifying role inasmuch as speaking the "noble" language [French] reduced the use of regional dialects and ''patois''. Let us mention the humiliation of children made to wear a clog around their necks for inadvertently speaking a word in the language of the people.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As for signs, they were also found in [[Poitou]] schools:&lt;ref&gt;[http://parlange.free.fr/pages/bas_poitevin.html Parlange : témoignages sur les patois du Bas-Poitou, parlange.free.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It seems as though Jules Ferry making school free and compulsory in 1881 materialized the work started four centuries earlier [with the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]]]; the method of repression and humiliation that was undertaken bore fruit with, for instance, the famous signs in school reading: "It is forbidden to spit on the ground and speak ''patois''."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Conselh de Representacion Generala de la Joventut d'Òc (CRGJOC, General Representation Council of the Occitan Youth), through the Youth of European Nationalities website,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050421083901/http://www.yeni.org/default.php?s=members&amp;p=members/membersitem.php&amp;id=204&amp;m=&amp;l=english Conselh de Representacion Generala de la Joventut d'Òc (CRGJOC) : Organization, at the Youth of European Nationalities Website]&lt;/ref&gt; reports that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our language [Occitan] lost its name, becoming some "''patois''", first at school and then in families through putting pressure on women in education ("''Interdit de cracher par terre et de parler patois''") with the French Third Republic, [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and [[Francisco Franco|Franco]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Confolentés Occitan (Occitan-speaking [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]]) website &lt;ref&gt;[http://ujan.free.fr/englOc2.htm Occitan : a short history, Confolentés Occitan website (ujan.free.fr)]&lt;/ref&gt; testifies of the methods used by French authorities over the past century or so:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To help efface traditional regional identities, the Occitan language was not merely discouraged but actively suppressed. School pupils were punished well within living memory for speaking their native language on school premises.

The French administration managed to make the Occitan speakers think of their own language as a patois, i.e. as a corrupted form of French used only by the ignorant and uneducated. This alienating process is known as ''la vergonha'' ("the shame").

Many older speakers of Occitan still believe that their native language is no more than a shameful patois. This is one reason why you rarely hear it in public — or anywhere outside of the neighbourhood or family circle.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the school of Camélas in [[Northern Catalonia]], a former pupil reports,&lt;ref&gt;''Quatre femmes en Roussillon'', TV show, 1st April 1973&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Everyone but the teacher's children spoke [[Catalan language|Catalan]] among themselves. We'd even get punished for that, because at the time, we all had to speak French. ''Be Clean, Speak French'' could be found written on the school's walls. And if you refused to speak French, they'd give you some sort of wooden sign to wear ''until death came'', as we said, which meant the last offender, in the evening, had twenty lines to copy. We'd speak French in the schoolyard, and for the first ten metres of the way back home, for as long as we thought the teacher would overhear us, and then we'd switch back to our own mother tongue, Catalan.

In those times, Catalan speakers were rather despised. My generation associated speaking Catalan with a disadvantage, with being less than the others, with running the risk of being left behind on the social ladder, in short with bringing trouble.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Abbé Grégoire's own terms were kept to designate the languages of France: while Breton referred to the language spoken in Brittany, the word ''patois'' encompassed all [[Romance languages|Romance]] ''dialects'' such as Occitan and [[Franco-Provençal]]. In his report, [[Corsican language|Corsican]] and [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]] were dismissed as "highly degenerate" (''très-dégénérés'') forms of [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[German language|German]], respectively. As a result, some people still call their non-French language ''patois'', encouraged by the fact they were never taught how to write it and made to think only French exists in the written form.

===Pressure on the church===
In 1902, in a speech before the ''[[Conseil général#Administrative role|Conseil Général]]'' of [[Morbihan]], Chief Education Officer Dantzer recommended that "the Church give [[first communion]] only to French-speaking children".&lt;ref name="livre-blanc-et-noir-de-la-langue-bretonne"&gt;[http://www.kervarker.org/fr/levr_27_period.html Livre blanc et noir de la langue bretonne, kervarker.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, prime minister [[Émile Combes]], himself an Occitan, told the prefects of Morbihan, [[Côtes-d'Armor|Côtes-du-Nord]] and [[Finistère]]&lt;ref name="livre-blanc-et-noir-de-la-langue-bretonne" /&gt; that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Breton priests want to keep their flock in ignorance by refusing to promote education and using only the Breton language in religious teachings and [[catechism]]. The Bretons will only be part of the Republic the day they start speaking French.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mid-20th century to the present==
As the doctor in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] [[philology]] and professor at the [[University of the Balearic Islands]] [[Jaume Corbera Pou]] argues,&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dodeparaula.blogspot.com/search?q=patu%C3%A8s&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When at the mid-19th century, primary school is made compulsory all across the State, it is also made clear that only French will be taught, and the teachers will severely punish any pupil speaking in ''patois''. The aim of the French educational system will consequently not be to dignify the pupils' natural humanity, developing their culture and teaching them to write their language, but rather to humiliate them and morally degrade them for the simple fact of being what tradition and their nature made them. The self-proclaimed country of the "[[Human rights]]" will then ignore one of man's most fundamental rights, the right to be himself and speak the language of his nation. And with that attitude France, the "grande France" that calls itself the champion of liberty, will pass the 20th century, indifferent to the timid protest movements of the various linguistic communities it submitted and the literary prestige they may have given birth to.

[...]

France, that under [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s reign was seen here [in [[Catalonia]]] as the safe haven of freedom, has the miserable honour of being the [only] State of [[Europe]]—and probably the world — that succeeded best in the diabolical task of destroying its own ethnic and linguistic patrimony and moreover, of destroying human family bonds: many parents and children, or grandparents and grandchildren, have different languages, and the latter feel ashamed of the first because they speak a despicable ''patois'', and no element of the grandparents' culture has been transmitted to the younger generation, as if they were born out of a completely new world. This is the French State that has just entered the 21st century, a country where stone monuments and natural landscapes are preserved and respected, but where many centuries of popular creation expressed in different tongues are on the brink of extinction. The "gloire" and the "grandeur" built on a genocide. [[liberté, égalité, fraternité|No liberty, no equality, no fraternity]]: just cultural extermination, this is the real motto of the French Republic.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Constitutional issues===
In 1972, [[Georges Pompidou]], the President of France and a native of an Occitan-speaking region, declared that "there is no room for regional languages in a France whose fate is to mark Europe with its seal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurominority.eu/documents/transferts/Audition%202-3%2007%2007%20discrimination%20linguistique-1.pdf Conséquences sociales, économiques et politiques de la discrimination linguistique.

In a pre-election speech&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pactedeslangues.com/spip.php?article1824 |title=Le temps est venu d’un statut des langues et cultures de France, at pactedeslangues.com |access-date=2008-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908041134/http://pactedeslangues.com/spip.php?article1824 |archive-date=2009-09-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lorient]], on March 14, 1981, [[François Mitterrand]] asserted that:

{{quote|The time has come to give the languages and cultures of France an official status. The time has come to open school doors wide for them, to create regional radio and TV stations to let them be broadcast, to ensure they play all the role they deserve in public life.}}

These declarations however were not followed by any effective measures.
[[File:Occitan Lenga Oficiala.jpg|thumb|Pro-officiality gathering in Carcassonne]]
In 1992, after some questioned the unconstitutional segregation of minority languages in France, Art. II of the 1958 [[French Constitution]] was revised so that "the language of the Republic is French" (''la langue de la République est le français''). This was achieved only months before the [[Council of Europe]] passed the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, Strasbourg, 5.XI.1992]&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Jacques Chirac]] ignored &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanite.fr/popup_print.php3?id_article=291867 Langues régionales : Jospin saisit Chirac, www.humanite.fr, June 24, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; despite [[Lionel Jospin]]'s plea for the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] to amend Art. II and include all vernacular languages spoken on French soil. Yet again, non-French languages in France were denied official recognition and deemed too dangerous for the unity of the country,&lt;ref&gt;Art. 1 of the French Constitution states that ''La France est une République indivisible, laïque, démocratique et sociale'', France is an indivisible, secular, democratic and social Republic.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Occitania|Occitans]], [[Basques]], [[Corsicans]], [[Catalan people|Catalans]], [[Bretons]], [[Alsace|Alsatians]], [[County of Nice|Nissarts]], [[Savoyards]] and [[Flemings]] have still no explicit legal right to conduct public affairs in their regional languages within their home lands. The text was again refused&lt;ref&gt;[http://ouiaubreton.com/spip.php?article3466 Langues régionales : on verra plus tard, ouiaubreton.com]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Union for a Popular Movement|majority]] deputies on January 18, 2008, after the [[Académie française]] voiced their absolute disapproval&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-societe/2008-06-17/l-academie-francaise-contre-les-langues-regionales-dans-la/920/0/253644&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20080616/53482013513.html&lt;/ref&gt; of so-called regional languages, the recognition of which they perceive as "an attack on French national identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/17/france |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Local language recognition angers French academy |first=Angelique |last=Chrisafis |date=June 17, 2008 |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] website,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070825082354/http://www.u-m-p.org/propositions/index.php?id=charte_europeene_des_langues_regionales Charte européenne des langues régionales, L'Abécédaire des propositions de Nicolas Sarkozy, UMP website]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] denies any mistreatment of regional languages. In a pre-[[French presidential election, 2007|electoral]] speech in [[Besançon]] on 13 March 2007 he claimed:

{{quote|If I'm elected, I won't be in favour of the European Charter for Regional Languages. I don't want a judge with a historical experience of the issue of minorities different from ours deciding tomorrow that a regional language must be considered as a language of the Republic just like French.&lt;br&gt;Because, beyond the text itself, there is a dynamic of interpretations and jurisprudence that can go very far. I am convinced that in France, the land of freedom, no minority is discriminated against and consequently it is not necessary to grant European judges the right to give their opinion on a matter that is consubstantial with our national identity and has absolutely nothing to do with the construction of [[European Union|Europe]].}}

His [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] rival, [[Ségolène Royal]], on the contrary, declared herself ready to sign the Charter in a March 2007 speech &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sego29.over-blog.org/article-5914843.html |title=Charte des langues régionales : C'est OUI, sego29.over-blog.org |access-date=2007-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171421/http://sego29.over-blog.org/article-5914843.html |archive-date=2007-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Northern Basque Country|Iparralde]] for the sake of cultural variety in France:

{{quote|Regional identities represent a tremendous asset for the future and I believe that understanding the link between the fundamental values that make the deep-rooted identity between France and the French nation in its diversity, in its authenticity, in its authentic traditions [...] makes the State work well.}}

On 27 October 2015, the [[Senate (France)|Senate]] rejected a bill for the ratification of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], preventing the adoption of a constitutional reform that would have given a degree of official status to regional languages such as Occitan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le Sénat dit non à la Charte européenne des langues régionales|url=http://www.franceinfo.fr/actu/politique/article/le-senat-rejette-le-projet-de-loi-de-ratification-de-la-charte-europeenne-des-langues-regionales-741405|accessdate=1 November 2015|agency=franceinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4892">In [[mathematics]], the '''Veronese surface''' is an [[algebraic surface]] in five-dimensional [[projective space]], and is realized by the '''Veronese embedding''', the embedding of the [[projective plane]] given by the complete [[linear system of conics]]. It is named after [[Giuseppe Veronese]] (1854–1917). Its generalization to higher dimension is known as the '''Veronese variety'''.

The surface admits an embedding in the four-dimensional projective space defined by the projection from a general point in the five-dimensional space. Its general projection to three-dimensional projective space is called a [[Steiner surface]].

==Definition==
The Veronese surface is the image of the mapping
:&lt;math&gt;\nu:\mathbb{P}^2\to \mathbb{P}^5&lt;/math&gt;
given by

:&lt;math&gt;\nu: [x:y:z] \mapsto [x^2:y^2:z^2:yz:xz:xy]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;[x:\cdots]&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[homogeneous coordinates]]. The map &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''Veronese embedding.'''

==Motivation==
The Veronese surface arises naturally in the study of [[conic]]s. A conic is a degree 2 plane curve, thus defined by an equation:
:&lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 +Dxz + Eyz + Fz^2 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
The pairing between coefficients &lt;math&gt;(A, B, C, D, E, F)&lt;/math&gt; and variables &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; is linear in coefficients and quadratic in the variables; the Veronese map makes it linear in the coefficients and linear in the monomials. Thus for a fixed point &lt;math&gt;[x:y:z],&lt;/math&gt; the condition that a conic contains the point is a [[linear equation]] in the coefficients, which formalizes the statement that "passing through a point imposes a linear condition on conics".

==Veronese map== 
The '''Veronese map''' or '''Veronese variety''' generalizes this idea to mappings of general degree ''d'' in ''n''+1 variables. That is, the Veronese map of degree ''d'' is the map

:&lt;math&gt;\nu_d\colon \mathbb{P}^n \to \mathbb{P}^m&lt;/math&gt;

with ''m'' given by the [[multiset coefficient]], or more familiarly the [[binomial coefficient]], as:

:&lt;math&gt;m= \left(\!\!{n + 1 \choose d}\!\!\right) - 1 = {n+d \choose d} - 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The map sends &lt;math&gt;[x_0:\ldots:x_n]&lt;/math&gt; to all possible [[monomial]]s of total degree ''d'', thus the appearance of combinatorial functions; the &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; are due to projectivization. The last expression shows that for fixed source dimension ''n,'' the target dimension is a polynomial in ''d'' of degree ''n'' and leading coefficient &lt;math&gt;1/n!.&lt;/math&gt;

For low degree, &lt;math&gt;d=0&lt;/math&gt; is the trivial constant map to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}^0,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d=1&lt;/math&gt; is the identity map on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}^n,&lt;/math&gt; so ''d'' is generally taken to be 2 or more.

One may define the Veronese map in a coordinate-free way, as

:&lt;math&gt;\nu_d: \mathbb{P}V \to \mathbb{P}(\rm{Sym}^d V)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is any [[vector space]] of finite dimension, and &lt;math&gt;\rm{Sym}^d V&lt;/math&gt; are its [[symmetric power]]s of degree ''d''.  This is homogeneous of degree ''d'' under scalar multiplication on ''V'', and therefore passes to a mapping on the underlying [[projective space]]s.

If the vector space ''V'' is defined over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' which does not have [[characteristic zero]], then the definition must be altered to be understood as a mapping to the dual space of polynomials on ''V''.  This is because for fields with finite characteristic ''p'', the ''p''th powers of elements of ''V'' are not [[rational normal curve]]s, but are of course a line. (See, for example [[additive polynomial]] for a treatment of polynomials over a field of finite characteristic).

=== Rational normal curve ===
{{see|Rational normal curve}}

For &lt;math&gt;n=1,&lt;/math&gt; the Veronese variety is known as the [[rational normal curve]], of which the lower-degree examples are familiar.
* For &lt;math&gt;n=1, d=1&lt;/math&gt; the Veronese map is simply the identity map on the projective line.
* For &lt;math&gt;n=1, d=2,&lt;/math&gt; the Veronese variety is the standard [[parabola]] &lt;math&gt;[x^2:xy:y^2],&lt;/math&gt; in affine coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x,x^2).&lt;/math&gt;
* For &lt;math&gt;n=1, d=3,&lt;/math&gt; the Veronese variety is the [[twisted cubic]], &lt;math&gt;[x^3:x^2y:xy^2:y^3],&lt;/math&gt; in affine coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x,x^2,x^3).&lt;/math&gt;

==Biregular==
The image of a variety under the Veronese map is again a variety, rather than simply a [[Constructible set (topology)|constructible set]]; furthermore, these are isomorphic in the sense that the inverse map exists and is [[regular function|regular]] – the Veronese map is [[biregular]]. More precisely, the images of [[open set]]s in the [[Zariski topology]] are again open.

&lt;!-- Definition --&gt;
'''Violence''' is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as "the intentional use of physical force or [[Power (social and political)|power]], threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation," although the group acknowledges that the inclusion of "the use of power" in its definition expands on the conventional understanding of the word.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;Krug et al., [http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ "World report on violence and health"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822172354/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ |date=2015-08-22 }}, [[World Health Organization]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990.&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm ([[suicide]]), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence ([[war]]) and legal intervention.&lt;ref name=GDB2013 /&gt; In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death.&lt;ref&gt;awake Aug 8/05 pp. 4-7&lt;/ref&gt; Corlin, past president of the [[American Medical Association]] said: "The United States leads the world—in the rate at which its children die from firearms." He concluded: "Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country."&lt;ref&gt;Awake Jul 8/2003 pp. 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/ "Global Burden of Disease"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009053208/http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/ |date=2015-10-09 }}, World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development.

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
In 2013, assault by [[firearm]] was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.&lt;ref name=GDB2013 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention --&gt;
Violence in many forms is preventable. There is a strong relationship between levels of violence and modifiable factors such as [[concentrated poverty]], income and gender inequality, the harmful use of alcohol, and the absence of safe, stable, and nurturing relationships between children and parents. Strategies addressing the underlying causes of violence can be effective in preventing violence.&lt;ref&gt;WHO / Liverpool JMU Centre for Public Health, [http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/en/ "Violence Prevention: The evidence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830082343/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/en/ |date=2012-08-30 }}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
[[File:Typology of violence.jpg|thumb|Typology of violence&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;]]
Violence can be divided into three broad categories:&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;
* self-directed violence
* interpersonal violence
* collective violence

Violent acts can be:
* physical
* sexual
* physiological
* emotional

This initial categorization differentiates between violence a person inflicts upon himself or herself, violence inflicted by another individual or by a small group of individuals, and violence inflicted by larger groups such as states, organized political groups, militia groups and terrorist organizations. These three broad categories are each divided further to reflect more specific types of violence.

Violence is primarily classified as either instrumental or reactive / hostile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://curry.virginia.edu/uploads/resourceLibrary/Violence_Coding_Guide_for_Instrumental_and_Hostile-Reactive_Incidents_10-5-13.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915221238/http://curry.virginia.edu/uploads/resourceLibrary/Violence_Coding_Guide_for_Instrumental_and_Hostile-Reactive_Incidents_10-5-13.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-directed violence ===
Self-directed violence is subdivided into suicidal behaviour and [[Self-harm|self-abuse]]. The former includes [[suicidal thoughts]], [[attempted suicide]]s – also called ''[[para suicide]]'' or ''deliberate self-injury'' in some countries – and completed suicides. Self-abuse, in contrast, includes acts such as [[self-mutilation]].

=== Collective violence ===
{{Citation style|date=February 2017}}
[[File:The Bochnia massacre German-occupied Poland 1939.jpg|thumb|right|[[Massacre]] of [[Poles|Polish]] civilians during [[Nazi occupation of Poland]], 1939]]

Collective violence is subdivided into [[structural violence]] and [[economic violence]]. Unlike the other two broad categories, the subcategories of collective violence suggest possible motives for violence committed by larger groups of individuals or by states. Collective violence that is committed to advance a particular social agenda includes, for example, crimes of hate committed by organized groups, terrorist acts and mob violence. Political violence includes war and related violent conflicts, state violence and similar acts carried out by larger groups. Economic violence includes attacks by larger groups motivated by economic gain – such as attacks carried out with the purpose of disrupting economic activity, denying access to essential services, or creating economic division and fragmentation. Clearly, acts committed by larger groups can have multiple motives.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1300/J137v04n02_03|title=Poverty as a Form of Violence|journal=Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment|volume=4|issue=2–3|pages=45–59|year=2001|last1=Allen|first1=Josephine A. V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This typology, while imperfect and far from being universally accepted, does provide a useful framework for understanding the complex patterns of violence taking place around the world, as well as violence in the everyday lives of individuals, families and communities. It also overcomes many of the limitations of other typologies by capturing the nature of violent acts, the relevance of the setting, the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, and – in the case of collective violence – possible motivations for the violence. However, in both research and practice, the dividing lines between the different types of violence are not always so clear.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}. State violence also involves upholding, forms of violence of a structural nature, such as poverty, through dismantling welfare, creating strict policies such as 'welfare to work', in order to cause further stimulation and disadvantage&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Poverty as a form of violence may involve oppressive policies that specifically target minority or low socio-economic groups. The 'war on drugs', for example, rather than increasing the health and well-being of at risk demographics, most often results in violence committed against these vulnerable demographics through incarceration, stigmatization and police brutality&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02249526|title=Political ideologies and drug policy|journal=European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research|volume=1|pages=94–105|year=1993|last1=Scheerer|first1=Sebastian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Warfare ===

{{Main|War}}

[[File:UStankParis-edit1.jpg|thumb|A United States [[M8 Greyhound]] armoured car in Paris during World War II]]
War is a state of prolonged violent large-scale conflict involving two or more groups of people, usually under the auspices of government. It is the most extreme form of collective violence.&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2013): ''The Use of Force in International Relations'',  p. 64, {{ISBN|978-80-224-1341-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
War is fought as a means of resolving territorial and other conflicts, as [[war of aggression]] to conquer territory or loot resources, in national [[self-defence]] or liberation, or to suppress attempts of part of the nation to [[secession|secede]] from it. We know also ideological, religious and revolutionary wars.&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2013): ''The Use of Force in International Relations'',  p. 84, {{ISBN|978-80-224-1341-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], the lethality of modern warfare has grown. [[World War I casualties]] were over 40 million and [[World War II casualties]] were over 70 million.

=== Non-physical ===
Violence includes those acts that result from a power relationship, including threats and [[intimidation]], [[neglect]] or acts of omission. Such non-physical violence has a broad range of outcomes – including psychological harm, deprivation and maldevelopment. Violence may not necessarily result in injury or death, but nonetheless poses a substantial burden on individuals, families, communities and health care systems worldwide. Many forms of violence can result in physical, psychological and social problems that do not necessarily lead to injury, disability or death. These consequences can be immediate, as well as latent, and can last for years after the initial abuse. Defining outcomes solely in terms of injury or death thus limits the understanding of the full impact of violence.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

=== Interpersonal violence ===
[[File:Interpersonal violence world map-Deaths per million persons-WHO2012.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Deaths due to interpersonal violence per million persons in 2012 {{refbegin|3}}{{legend|#ffff20|0-8}}{{legend|#ffe820|9-16}}{{legend|#ffd820|17-24}}{{legend|#ffc020|25-32}}{{legend|#ffa020|33-54}}{{legend|#ff9a20|55-75}}{{legend|#f08015|76-96}}{{legend|#e06815|97-126}}{{legend|#d85010|127-226}}{{legend|#d02010|227-878}}{{refend}}]]
Interpersonal violence is divided into two subcategories: Family and [[intimate partner violence]] – that is, violence largely between family members and intimate partners, usually, though not exclusively, taking place in the home. Community violence – violence between individuals who are unrelated, and who may or may not know each other, generally taking place outside the home. The former group includes forms of violence such as [[child abuse]], intimate partner violence and [[elderly abuse|abuse of the elderly]]. The latter includes youth violence, random acts of violence, [[rape]] or [[sexual assault]] by strangers, and violence in institutional settings such as schools, workplaces, prisons and nursing homes.  When interpersonal violence occurs in families, its psychological consequences can affect parents, children, and their relationship in the short- and long-terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schechter DS, Willheim E, McCaw J, Turner JB, Myers MM, Zeanah CH | year = 2011 | title = The relationship of violent fathers, posttraumatically stressed mothers, and symptomatic children in a preschool-age inner-city pediatrics clinic sample | url = | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 26 | issue = 18| pages = 3699–3719 | doi=10.1177/0886260511403747 | pmid=22170456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Child maltreatment ====
{{Main|Child abuse}}
Child maltreatment is the abuse and neglect that occurs to children under 18 years of age. It includes all types of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], [[neglect]], [[negligence]] and commercial or other [[child exploitation]], which results in actual or potential harm to the child’s health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust, or power. Exposure to intimate partner violence is also sometimes included as a form of child maltreatment.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2006). [http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/violence/child_maltreatment/en/index.html "Preventing child maltreatment: a guide to taking action and generating evidence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719072520/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/violence/child_maltreatment/en/index.html |date=2012-07-19 }} Geneva: WHO and International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect.&lt;/ref&gt;

Child maltreatment is a global problem with serious lifelong consequences, which is, however, complex and difficult to study.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Willheim E (2009).  The Effects of Violent Experience and Maltreatment on Infants and Young Children.  In CH Zeanah (Ed.).  Handbook of Infant Mental Health—3rd Edition.  New York: Guilford Press, Inc.  pp. 197-214.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no reliable global estimates for the prevalence of child maltreatment. Data for many countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are lacking. Current estimates vary widely depending on the country and the method of research used. Approximately 20% of women and 5–10% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25–50% of all children report being physically abused.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Stoltenborgh M. |author2=Van IJzendoorn M.H. |author3=Euser E.M. |author4=Bakermans-Kranenburg M.J. | year = 2011 | title = A global perspective on child abuse: Meta-analysis of prevalence around the world | url = | journal = Child Maltreatment | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 79–101 | doi = 10.1177/1077559511403920 |pmid=21511741 |citeseerx=10.1.1.1029.9752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequences of child maltreatment include impaired lifelong physical and mental health, and social and occupational functioning (e.g. school, job, and relationship difficulties). These can ultimately slow a country's economic and social development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gilbert R. |author2=Spatz Widom C. |author3=Browne K. |author4=Fergusson D. |author5=Webb E. |author6=Janson J. | year = 2009 | title = Burden and consequences of child maltreatment in high-income countries | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 373 | issue = 9657| pages = 68–81 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(08)61706-7 | pmid=19056114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ace/index.html|title=Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preventing child maltreatment before it starts is possible and requires a multisectoral approach. Effective prevention programmes support parents and teach positive parenting skills. Ongoing care of children and families can reduce the risk of maltreatment reoccurring and can minimize its consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=MacMillan HL, Wathen CN, Barlow J, Fergusson DM, Leventhal JM, Taussig HN | year = 2009 | title = Interventions to prevent child maltreatment and associated impairment | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 373 | issue = 9659| pages = 250–266 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(08)61708-0| pmid = 19056113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mikton Christopher |author2=Butchart Alexander | year = 2009 | title = Child maltreatment prevention: a systematic review of reviews | url = | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 87 | issue = 5| pages = 353–361 | doi=10.2471/blt.08.057075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Youth violence ====
[[File:Kids off the Block Rocks in grass IMG 4815.JPG|thumb|The [[Kids off the Block]] memorial featuring hundreds of simple stone blocks, one for each child killed by violence in [[Roseland, Chicago]] ]]

Following the World Health Organization, youth are defined as people between the ages of 10 and 29 years. Youth violence refers to violence occurring between youths, and includes acts that range from [[bullying]] and physical fighting, through more severe sexual and physical assault to homicide.&lt;ref name="Mercy, J.A. 2002 pp 23"&gt;Mercy, J.A., Butchart, A., Farrington, D., Cerda, M. (2002). Youth violence. In Etienne Krug, L.L. Dahlberg, J.A. Mercy, A.B. Zwi &amp; R. Lozano (Eds.), [http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ World Report on Violence and Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822172354/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ |date=2015-08-22 }} pp 23–56. Geneva, Switzerland: [[World Health Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide some 250,000 homicides occur among youth 10–29 years of age each year, which is 41% of the total number of homicides globally each year ("Global Burden of Disease", World Health Organization, 2008). For each young person killed, 20-40 more sustain injuries requiring hospital treatment.&lt;ref name="Mercy, J.A. 2002 pp 23" /&gt; Youth violence has a serious, often lifelong, impact on a person's psychological and social functioning. Youth violence greatly increases the costs of health, welfare and criminal justice services; reduces productivity; decreases the value of property; and generally undermines the fabric of society.

Prevention programmes shown to be effective or to have promise in reducing youth violence include life skills and social development programmes designed to help children and adolescents manage anger, resolve conflict, and develop the necessary social skills to solve problems; schools-based anti-bullying prevention programmes; and programmes to reduce access to alcohol, illegal drugs and guns.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization and Liverpool John Moores University.[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241598507_eng.pdf "Violence prevention: the evidence: overview"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122193235/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241598507_eng.pdf |date=2013-01-22 }} Geneva, WHO, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, given significant neighbourhood effects on youth violence, interventions involving relocating families to less poor environments have shown promising results.&lt;ref name="Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/1467-8721.01216 | volume=12 | title=Children and youth in neighborhood contexts | journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science | pages=27–31 | year=2003 | author=Leventhal Tama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, urban renewal projects such as [[business improvement district]]s have shown a reduction in youth violence.&lt;ref name="Rand report"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/technical_reports/2009/RAND_TR622.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020054800/http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/technical_reports/2009/RAND_TR622.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different types of youth on youth violence include witnessing or being involved in physical, emotional and sexual abuse (e.g. physical attacks, bullying, rape) and violent acts like gang shootings and robberies.  According to researchers in 2018, "More than half of children and adolescents living in cities have experienced some form of community violence." The violence "can also all take place under one roof, or in a given community or neighborhood and can happen at the same time or at different stages of life." &lt;ref name="The Conversation US Darby Saxbe 2018"&gt;{{cite magazine | department=The Conversation US |author=Darby Saxbe | title=Living with Neighborhood Violence May Shape Teens' Brains | magazine=Scientific American | date=June 15, 2018 |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/living-with-neighborhood-violence-may-shape-teens-rsquo-brains/ | access-date=November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;    It seems that youth violence is on the rise due to the growing number of legal and illegal guns on the streets especially in low income neighborhoods. Youth violence has immediate and long term adverse impact whether the individual was the recipient of the violence or a witness to it. Our knowledge about the impact of trauma on the brain, mind and body is growing every day as more research studies have been conducted and results are published. "Youth violence is a leading cause of death for adolescents and young adults. Some forms of youth violence, such as bullying, slapping, or hitting, can cause severe emotional harm, nonfatal physical injuries, and long-lasting problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Consequences Youth Violence |url=https://vetoviolence.cdc.gov/consequences-youth-violence |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost to individuals, their families, and society in general is huge and rising. These people often have lifelong injuries which means ongoing doctor and hospital visits the cost of which quickly adds up. Since the victims of youth on youth violence may not be able to attend school or work because of their physical and/or mental injuries, it is often up to their family members to take care of them (including paying their daily living expenses and medical bills). Their caretakers may have to give up their jobs or work reduced hours to provide help to the victim of violence. This causes a further burden on society because the victim and maybe even their caretakers have to obtain government assistance to help pay their bills. Recent research has found that psychological trauma during childhood can change a child's brain. "Trauma is known to physically affect the brain and the body which causes anxiety, rage, and the ability to concentrate. They can also have problems remembering, trusting, and forming relationships." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=09/08/2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=464 |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/313183/the-body-keeps-the-score-by-bessel-van-der-kolk-md/9780143127741 |accessdate=11/24/18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the brain becomes used to violence it may stay continually in an alert state (similar to being stuck in the fight or flight mode). "Researchers claim that the youth who are exposed to violence may have emotional, social, and cognitive problems. They may have trouble controlling emotions, paying attention in school, withdraw from friends, or show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder".&lt;ref name="The Conversation US Darby Saxbe 2018" /&gt; Youth who do not get help and get it under control may have more issues down the line.

It is important for youth exposed to violence to understand how their bodies may react so they can take positive steps to counteract any possible short and long term negative effects (e.g., poor concentration, feelings of depression, heightened levels of anxiety). By taking immediate steps to mitigate the effects of the trauma they’ve experienced negative repercussions can be reduced or eliminated. As an initial step, the kids need to understand why they may be feeling a certain way and to understand how the violence they have experienced may be causing negative feelings and making them behave differently. Pursuing a greater awareness of their feelings, perceptions, and negative emotions is the first step that should be taken as part of recovering from the trauma they have experienced. “Neuroscience research shows that the only way we can change the way we feel is by becoming aware of our inner experience and learning to befriend what is going on inside ourselves”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=September 8, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=464 |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/313183/the-body-keeps-the-score-by-bessel-van-der-kolk-md/9780143127741 |accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this initial awareness step is not sufficiently completed the youth may then knowingly or unknowingly resort to bullying as a way to release their own anger, compulsive behaviors (eating, drinking, drugs), anger management problems; and avoidance of social interactions. These types of behaviors may put them at an even greater risk for future violence in their lives. 
 
Some of the ways to combat the adverse effects of exposure to youth violence would be to try various mindfulness and movement activities, deep breathing exercises and  other actions that enable these kids to release their pent up emotions. Using these techniques will teach body awareness, reduce anxiety and nervousness, and reduce feelings of anger and annoyance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=September 8, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=464 |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/313183/the-body-keeps-the-score-by-bessel-van-der-kolk-md/9780143127741}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time these types of activities will help these younger victims of violence to have greater control over their feelings and behaviors and avoid unhealthy ways of coping. Another way to help trauma victims of youth violence is through the arts. This can be accomplished by giving them the opportunity to engage in drawing, painting, music, and singing which will give them an outlet to express themselves and their emotions in a positive way.

It’s been discovered that having youth who have experienced violence benefit from having a close relationship with one or more people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=Setember 08, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=464 |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/313183/the-body-keeps-the-score-by-bessel-van-der-kolk-md/9780143127741 |accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important because the trauma victims need to have people who are safe and trustworthy that they can relate and talk to about their horrible experiences. Some youth do not have adult figures at home or someone they can count on for guidance and comfort. Schools in bad neighborhoods where youth violence is prevalent should assign counselors to each student so that they receive regular guidance. In addition to counseling/therapy sessions and programs, schools should offer mentoring programs where the kids can interact with adults who can be a positive influence on them. Another way is to create more neighborhood programs to ensure that each child has a positive and stable place to go when school in not in session. It doesn’t have to be a formal organization just a place where the kids can have positive role models in their lives and engage in stress relieving activities (sports, yoga, and arts). Many kids have benefited from formal organizations now which aim to help mentor and provide a safe environment for the youth especially those living in neighborhoods with higher rates of violence. This includes organizations such as Becoming a Man, CeaseFire Illinois, Chicago Area Project, Little Black Pearl, and Rainbow House".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WCL: Stop the Violence Resources for Illinois |url=https://abc7chicago.com/archive/9009544/ |website=ABC 7 Windy City Live |publisher=ABC 7 Windy City Live |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are designed to help give the youth a safe place to go, stop the violence from occurring, offering counseling and mentoring to help stop the cycle of violence. For example, Derek grew up amongst the violence in Chicago in the 1980's and was even a former gang leader. It took him thirty years in a gang and time in jail to realize he was on the wrong path. He created a boxing program called "Boxing Out Negativity" which provides youth in high crime areas a safe place to get out their anger and energy. It helps them in a positive way and keeps them off the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schmich |first1=Mary |title=In a tough Chicago neighborhood, comfort and safety in boxing |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/schmich/ct-chicago-violence-lawndale-boxing-mary-schmich-0918-20160916-column.html |accessdate=11/20/18 |publisher=Chicago Tribume |date=09/16/16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of programs to help victims of youth violence there is a greater opportunity for these youth to turn their lives around.

==== Intimate partner violence ====
{{Main|Domestic violence|Intimate partner violence}}
Intimate partner violence refers to behaviour in an intimate relationship that causes physical, sexual or psychological harm, including physical aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse and controlling behaviours.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

Population-level surveys based on reports from victims provide the most accurate estimates of the prevalence of intimate partner violence and sexual violence in non-conflict settings. A study conducted by WHO in 10 mainly developing countries&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Moreno, C. et al. (2005). [http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/en/ "WHO multi-country study on women’s health and domestic violence against women"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224124426/http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/en/ |date=2011-02-24 }} Geneva: WHO&lt;/ref&gt; found that, among women aged 15 to 49 years, between 15% (Japan) and 70%  (Ethiopia and Peru) of women reported physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner.

Intimate partner and sexual violence have serious short- and long-term physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems for victims and for their children, and lead to high social and economic costs. These include both fatal and non-fatal injuries, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, [[unintended pregnancy|unintended pregnancies]], sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stith SM | year = 2004 | title = Intimate partner physical abuse perpetration and victimization risk factors: a meta-analytic review | url = | journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 65–98 | doi=10.1016/j.avb.2003.09.001|display-authors=etal| hdl = 2097/14851 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors associated with the perpetration and experiencing of intimate partner violence are low levels of education, history of violence as a perpetrator, a victim or a witness of parental violence, harmful use of alcohol, attitudes that are accepting of violence as well as marital discord and dissatisfaction. Factors associated only with perpetration of intimate partner violence are having multiple partners, and [[antisocial personality disorder]].

A recent theory named "The [[Criminal Spin]]" suggests a mutual flywheel effect between partners that is manifested by an escalation in the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bensimon M. |author2=Ronel N. | year = 2012 | title = The flywheel effect of intimate partner violence: A victim-perpetrator interactive spin | url = | journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 423–429 | doi=10.1016/j.avb.2012.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A violent spin may occur in any other forms of violence, but in Intimate partner violence the added value is the mutual spin, based on the unique situation and characteristics of intimate relationship.

The primary prevention strategy with the best evidence for effectiveness for intimate partner violence is school-based programming for adolescents to prevent violence within dating relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Foshee V.A. | year = 2004 | title = Assessing the long-term effects of the Safe Dates program and a booster in preventing and reducing adolescent dating violence victimization and perpetration | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 94 | issue = 4| pages = 619–624 | doi=10.2105/ajph.94.4.619|display-authors=etal| pmc = 1448308 | pmid=15054015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence is emerging for the effectiveness of several other primary prevention strategies – those that: combine microfinance with gender equality training;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kim J | year = 2009 | title = Assessing the incremental effects of combining economic and health interventions: the IMAGE study in South Africa | url = | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 87 | issue = 11| pages = 824–832 | doi=10.2471/blt.08.056580|display-authors=etal| pmc = 2770274 | pmid=20072767}}&lt;/ref&gt; promote communication and relationship skills within communities; reduce access to, and the harmful use of alcohol; and change cultural gender norms.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;WHO(2010).[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/violence/9789241564007_eng.pdf "Preventing intimate partner and sexual violence against women: Taking action and generating evidence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112035242/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/violence/9789241564007_eng.pdf |date=2011-11-12 }} World Health Organization: Geneva&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sexual violence ====
{{Main|Sexual violence}}
[[File:DRC raped women.jpg|thumb|Meeting of victims of [[sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]].]]
Sexual violence is any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed against a person’s sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting. It includes rape, defined as the physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration of the vulva or anus with a penis, other body part or object.&lt;ref&gt;Krug et al.,[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ "World report on violence and health"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822172354/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ |date=2015-08-22 }}, World Health Organization, 2002, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Population-level surveys based on reports from victims estimate that between 0.3–11.5% of women reported experiencing sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Moreno, C. et al. (2005).[http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/24159358X/en/ "WHO multi-country study on women’s health and domestic violence against women"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122193441/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/24159358X/en/ |date=2013-01-22 }} Geneva: WHO&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence has serious short- and long-term consequences on physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health for victims and for their children as described in the section on intimate partner violence. If perpetrated during childhood, sexual violence can lead to increased smoking,&lt;ref&gt;Ford, S.E. et al. (2011). Adverse childhood experiences and smoking status in five states. Preventive Medicine: 43, 3, 188-193.&lt;/ref&gt; drug and alcohol misuse, and risky sexual behaviors in later life. It is also associated with perpetration of violence and being a victim of violence.

Many of the risk factors for sexual violence are the same as for [[domestic violence]]. Risk factors specific to sexual violence perpetration include beliefs in family honor and sexual purity, ideologies of male sexual entitlement and weak legal sanctions for sexual violence.

Few interventions to prevent sexual violence have been demonstrated to be effective. School-based programmes to prevent child sexual abuse by teaching children to recognize and avoid potentially sexually abusive situations are run in many parts of the world and appear promising, but require further research. To achieve lasting change, it is important to enact legislation and develop policies that protect women; address discrimination against women and promote gender equality; and help to move the culture away from violence.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;

==== Elder maltreatment ====
{{Main|Elder abuse}}
Elder maltreatment is a single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person. This type of violence constitutes a violation of human rights and includes [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], emotional; [[financial abuse|financial]] and material abuse; abandonment; [[neglect]]; and serious loss of [[dignity]] and [[respect]].&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

While there is little information regarding the extent of maltreatment in elderly populations, especially in developing countries, it is estimated that 4–6% of elderly people in high-income countries have experienced some form of maltreatment at home&lt;ref&gt;Sethi et al. [http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/Life-stages/healthy-ageing/publications/2011/european-report-on-preventing-elder-maltreatment "WHO European report on preventing elder maltreatment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122231547/http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/Life-stages/healthy-ageing/publications/2011/european-report-on-preventing-elder-maltreatment |date=2013-01-22 }}, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper C, Selwood A, Livingston G | year = 2008 | title = The prevalence of elder abuse and neglect: a systematic review | url = | journal = Age Ageing | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 151–60 | doi=10.1093/ageing/afm194 | pmid=18349012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, older people are often afraid to report cases of maltreatment to family, friends, or to the authorities. Data on the extent of the problem in institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are scarce. Elder maltreatment can lead to serious physical injuries and long-term psychological consequences. Elder maltreatment is predicted to increase as many countries are experiencing rapidly ageing populations.

Many strategies have been implemented to prevent elder maltreatment and to take action against it and mitigate its consequences including public and professional awareness campaigns, screening (of potential victims and abusers), caregiver support interventions (e.g. stress management, respite care), adult protective services and self-help groups. Their effectiveness has, however, not so far been well-established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ploeg Jenny |author2=Fear Jana |author3=Hutchison Brian |author4=MacMillan Harriet |author5=Bolan Gale | year = 2009 | title = A Systematic Review of Interventions for Elder Abuse | url = | journal = Journal of Elder Abuse &amp; Neglect | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 187–210 | doi=10.1080/08946560902997181|pmid=19827325 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pillemer K et al.

=== Targeted violence ===

Several rare but painful episodes of [[assassination]], attempted assassination and [[school shooting]]s at elementary, middle, high schools, as well as colleges and universities in the United States, led to a considerable body of research on ascertainable behaviors of persons who have planned or carried out such attacks. These studies (1995–2002) investigated what the authors called "targeted violence," described the "path to violence" of those who planned or carried out attacks and laid out suggestions for law enforcement and educators. A major point from these research studies is that targeted violence does not just "come out of the blue".&lt;ref&gt;Fein, R.A., Vossekuil, B. &amp; Holden, G.

=== Everyday violence ===
As an anthropological concept, "everyday violence" may refer to the incorporation of different forms of violence (mainly political violence) into daily practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gammeltoft|first=Tine M.|date=2016-12-01|title=Silence as a Response to Everyday Violence: Understanding Domination and Distress Through the Lens of Fantasy|journal=Ethos|volume=44|issue=4|pages=427–447|doi=10.1111/etho.12140|issn=1548-1352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ethnographyofpoliticalviolence.wordpress.com/tag/everyday-violence/|title=everyday violence {{!}} The Ethnography of Political Violence|website=ethnographyofpoliticalviolence.wordpress.com|access-date=2018-02-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213200042/https://ethnographyofpoliticalviolence.wordpress.com/tag/everyday-violence/|archivedate=2018-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://istmo.denison.edu/n08/articulos/power.html|title=Philippe Bourgois - The Power of Violence in War and Peace|website=istmo.denison.edu|access-date=2018-02-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423065302/http://istmo.denison.edu/n08/articulos/power.html|archivedate=2016-04-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors ==
Violence cannot be attributed to a single factor. Its causes are complex and occur at different levels. To represent this complexity, the ecological, or [[social ecological model]] is often used. The following four-level version of the ecological model is often used in the study of violence:

The first level identifies biological and personal factors that influence how individuals behave and increase their likelihood of becoming a victim or perpetrator of violence: demographic characteristics (age, education, income), [[Genetics of aggression|genetics]], [[brain lesion theory|brain lesions]], [[personality disorders]], [[substance abuse]], and a history of experiencing, witnessing, or engaging in violent behaviour.&lt;ref name=Patrick&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patrick | first1 = C. J. | title = Psychophysiological correlates of aggression and violence: An integrative review | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 363 | issue = 1503 | pages = 2543–2555 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18434285 | pmc = 2606710 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCrory&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCrory | first1 = E. | last2 = De Brito | first2 = S. A. | last3 = Viding | first3 = E. | title = The link between child abuse and psychopathology: A review of neurobiological and genetic research | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 105 | issue = 4 | pages = 151–156 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22532655 | pmc =  3343716| doi = 10.1258/jrsm.2011.110222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second level focuses on close relationships, such as those with family and friends. In youth violence, for example, having friends who engage in or encourage violence can increase a young person’s risk of being a victim or perpetrator of violence. For intimate partner violence, a consistent marker at this level of the model is marital conflict or discord in the relationship. In [[elder abuse]], important factors are stress due to the nature of the past relationship between the abused person and the care giver.

The third level explores the community context—i.e., schools, workplaces, and neighbourhoods. Risk at this level may be affected by factors such as the existence of a local drug trade, the absence of social networks, and concentrated poverty. All these factors have been shown to be important in several types of violence.

Finally, the fourth level looks at the broad societal factors that help to create a climate in which violence is encouraged or inhibited: the responsiveness of the criminal justice system, social and cultural norms regarding gender roles or parent-child relationships, income inequality, the strength of the social welfare system, the social acceptability of violence, the availability of weapons, the exposure to violence in mass media, and political instability.

=== Child-rearing ===

Cross-cultural studies have shown that greater prevalence of [[corporal punishment]] of children tends to predict higher levels of violence in societies. For instance, a 2005 analysis of 186 [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial societies]] found that corporal punishment was more prevalent in societies which also had higher rates of homicide, assault, and war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045300461.html "Corporal Punishment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031091526/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045300461.html |date=2010-10-31 }} (2008). ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[domestic corporal punishment]] has been linked to later violent acts against family members and spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gershoff, E.T. |date=2008 |title=Report on Physical Punishment in the United States: What Research Tells Us About Its Effects on Children |format=PDF |location=Columbus, OH |publisher=Center for Effective Discipline |page= |url=http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127213730/http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While studies showing associations between physical punishment of children and later aggression cannot prove that physical punishment causes an increase in aggression, a number of [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Durrant |first=Joan |last2=Ensom |first2=Ron |date=4 September 2012 |title=Physical punishment of children: lessons from 20 years of research |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=184 |issue=12 |pages=1373–1377 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.101314 |pmid=22311946 |pmc=3447048}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American family violence researcher [[Murray A. Straus]] believes that disciplinary [[spanking]] forms "the most prevalent and important form of violence in American families", whose effects contribute to several major societal problems, including later domestic violence and crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Straus Murray A | year = 2000 | title = Corporal punishment by parents: The cradle of violence in the family and society" (PDF) | url = http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CP62.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Virginia Journal of Social Policy &amp; the Law | volume =  | issue =  | page =  | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111110040441/http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CP62.pdf | archivedate = 2011-11-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychology ===

The causes of violent behaviour in humans are often a topic of research in [[psychology]]. [[Neuroscientist|Neurobiologist]] Jan Volavka emphasizes that, for those purposes, "violent behavior is defined as intentional physically aggressive behavior against another person."&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071127111237/http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/11/3/307.pdf The Neurobiology of Violence, An Update], Journal of Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci 11:3, Summer 1999. As Mexican Biologist and Scientologist Adri Rodriguez says, Violence is a recurring motif in today's society.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the idea of human nature, scientists do agree violence is inherent in humans. Among prehistoric humans, there is archaeological evidence for both contentions of violence and peacefulness as primary characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Whipps,[http://www.livescience.com/history/060316_peace_violence.html Peace or War? How early humans behaved] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715062002/http://www.livescience.com/history/060316_peace_violence.html |date=2007-07-15 }}, LiveScience.Com, March 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since violence is a matter of perception as well as a measurable phenomenon, psychologists have found variability in whether people perceive certain physical acts as "violent". For example, in a state where execution is a legalized punishment we do not typically perceive the executioner as "violent", though we may talk, in a more metaphorical way, of the state acting violently. Likewise, understandings of violence are linked to a perceived aggressor-victim relationship: hence psychologists have shown that people may not recognise defensive use of force as violent, even in cases where the amount of force used is significantly greater than in the original aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rowan | first = John | year = 1978 | title = The Structured Crowd | publisher = Davis-Poynter. | title-link = The Structured Crowd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "violent male ape" image is often brought up in discussions of human violence. Dale Peterson and [[Richard Wrangham]]in "Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence" write that violence is inherent in humans, though not inevitable.
However, William L. Ury, editor of a book called "Must We Fight? From the Battlefield to the Schoolyard—A New Perspective on Violent Conflict and Its Prevention" criticizes the "killer ape" myth in his book which brings together discussions from two Harvard Law School symposiums. The conclusion is that "we also have lots of natural mechanisms for cooperation, to keep conflict in check, to channel aggression, and to overcome conflict.

The psychiatrist [[James Gilligan]] argues that most violent behavior represents an effort to eliminate feelings of [[shame]] and [[humiliation]], which he calls "the death of self".&lt;ref name="Gilligan 2001"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilligan |first=James |title=Preventing Violence |date=2001 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0-50-077056-6 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books/about/Preventing_Violence.html?id=7_06CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT15 |chapter=Shame and the Death of Self}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilligan 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilligan |first=James |title=Shame, Guilt, and Violence |journal=Social Research |date=2003 |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=1149–1180 |jstor=40971965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of violence often is a source of [[pride]] and a defence of honor, especially among males who believe violence defines manhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/violence.htm Emotional Competency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323204810/http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/violence.htm |date=2007-03-23 }}; Michael Obsatz,[http://www.angeresources.com/shamebased.html From Shame-Based Masculinity to Holistic Manhood] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201053950/http://angeresources.com/shamebased.html |date=2007-12-01 }}, Robin Morgan, The Demon Lover On the Sexuality of Terrorism, W.W.

In an article entitled "The History of Violence" in ''[[The New Republic]]'', [[Steven Pinker]] posits that, on average, the amount and cruelty of violence to humans and animals has decreased over the last few centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pinker, [http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2007_03_19_New%20Republic.pdf The History of Violence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127111245/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2007_03_19_New%20Republic.pdf |date=2007-11-27 }}, The New Republic, March 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker's observation of the decline in interpersonal violence echoes the work of [[Norbert Elias]], who attributes the decline to a "civilizing process", in which the state's monopolization of violence, the maintenance of socioeconomic interdependencies or "figurations", and the maintenance of behavioural codes in culture all contribute to the development of individual sensibilities, which increase the repugnance of individuals towards violent acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=CaWFQgAACAAJ | last = Elias | first = N. | year = 1994 | title = The Civilizing Process | location = Oxford | publisher = Blackwell | isbn = 978-0-631-19222-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars disagree with the argument that all violence is decreasing arguing that not all types of violent behaviour are lower now than in the past. They suggest that research typically focuses on lethal violence, often looks at [[homicide]] rates of death due to [[warfare]], but ignore the less obvious forms of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Gorelik, G., Shackelford, T.K., Weekes-Shackelford, V.A., 2012.

(Eds.), The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Perspectives on Violence, Homicide, and War. Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp. 506–524&lt;/ref&gt;  However, non-lethal violence, such as assaults or bullying appear to be declining as well.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelhor, D., Turner, H., Ormrod, R., &amp; Hamby, S.

In his article [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/02/the-coming-anarchy/304670/ "The Coming Anarchy"], Robert D. Kaplan introduces the notion of liberating violence. According to Kaplan, we will observe more violent [[civil war]]s in the future, which will be fought due to economic inequalities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/02/the-coming-anarchy/304670/ "The Coming Anarchy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407054749/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/02/the-coming-anarchy/304670/ |date=2017-04-07 }}, Robert D.

The concept of violence normalization, is known as socially sanctioned or [[structural violence]], and is a topic of increasing interest to researchers trying to understand violent behavior. It has been discussed at length by researchers in [[sociology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Galtung Johan | authorlink = Johan Galtung | year = 1969 | title = Violence, Peace and Peace Research | url = | journal = Journal of Peace Research | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 167–91 | doi=10.1177/002234336900600301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Galtung Johan |author2=Höivik Tord | year = 1971 | title = Structural and Direct Violence: A Note on Operationalization | url = | journal = Journal of Peace Research | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 73–76 | doi=10.1177/002234337100800108}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[medical anthropology]],&lt;ref&gt;Farmer, Paul, M.

[[Evolutionary psychology]] offers several explanations for human violence in various contexts, such as [[sexual jealousy in humans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Daly Martin |author2=Wilson Margo | year = 1982 | title = Male Sexual Jealousy | url = | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 11–27 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(82)90027-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; child abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Daly Martin |author2=Wilson Margo I | year = 1981 | title = Child Maltreatment from a Sociobiological Perspective | url = | journal = New Directions for Child Development | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 93–112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[homicide]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Margo, and Martin Daly. Homicide. Hawthorne: Aldine de Gruyter, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Goetz (2010) argues that humans are similar to most [[mammal]] species and use violence in specific situations. He writes that "Buss and Shackelford (1997a) proposed seven adaptive problems our ancestors recurrently faced that might have been solved by aggression: co-opting the resources of others, defending against attack, inflicting costs on same-sex rivals, negotiating status and hierarchies, deterring rivals from future aggression, deterring mate from infidelity, and reducing resources expended on genetically unrelated children."&lt;ref name=EP&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goetz | first1 = A. T. | title = The evolutionary psychology of violence | journal = Psicothema | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–21 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20100422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goetz writes that most [[homicide]]s seem to start from relatively trivial disputes between unrelated men who then escalate to violence and death. He argues that such conflicts occur when there is a status dispute between men of relatively similar status. If there is a great initial status difference, then the lower status individual usually offers no challenge and if challenged the higher status individual usually ignores the lower status individual. At the same an environment of great inequalities between people may cause those at the bottom to use more violence in attempts to gain status.&lt;ref name=EP /&gt;

=== Media ===
{{further|Media violence research}}
Research into the media and violence examines whether links between consuming media violence and subsequent aggressive and violent behaviour exists. Although some scholars had claimed media violence may increase aggression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anderson Craig A. |author2=Berkowitz Leonard |author3=Donnerstein Edward |author4=Huesmann L. Rowell |author5=Johnson James D. |author6=Linz Daniel |author7=Malamuth Neil M. |author8=Wartella Ellen | year = 2003 | title = The Influence of Media Violence on Youth | url = | journal = [[Psychological Science in the Public Interest]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3|pages=81–110 | doi = 10.1111/j.1529-1006.2003.pspi_1433.x | pmid=26151870}}&lt;/ref&gt; this view is coming increasingly in doubt both in the scholarly community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ferguson Christopher J | year = 2010| title = Blazing Angels or Resident Evil?

Entertainment Merchants Association|Brown v EMA]] case, as well as in a review of video game violence by the Australian Government (2010) which concluded evidence for harmful effects were inconclusive at best and the rhetoric of some scholars was not matched by good data.

== Prevention ==

The threat and enforcement of physical punishment has been a tried and tested method of preventing some violence since civilisation began.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Code-of-Hammurabi|title=Code of Hammurabi {{!}} Summary &amp; History|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313150613/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Code-of-Hammurabi|archivedate=2017-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in various degrees in most countries.

=== Interpersonal violence ===
A review of scientific literature by the [[World Health Organization]] on the effectiveness of strategies to prevent interpersonal violence identified the seven strategies below as being supported by either strong or emerging evidence for effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/en/ "Violence Prevention: the evidence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830082343/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/en/ |date=2012-08-30 }}, World Health Organization/Liverpool John Moores University, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies target risk factors at all four levels of the ecological model.

==== Child–caregiver relationships ====
Among the most effective such programmes to prevent child maltreatment and reduce childhood aggression are the Nurse Family Partnership home-visiting programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olds DL, Sadler L, Kitzman H | year = 2007| title = Programs for parents of infants and toddlers: recent evidence from randomized trials | url = | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 48| issue = 3–4| pages = 355–391 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01702.x | pmid=17355402}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Triple P (Parenting Program)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Prinz | year = 2009 | title = Population-based prevention of child maltreatment: the US Triple P system population trial | journal = Prevention Science | volume =  10| issue = 1| pages =  1–12| doi = 10.1007/s11121-009-0123-3 | pmid = 19160053 |display-authors=etal| pmc =4258219}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also emerging evidence that these programmes reduce convictions and violent acts in adolescence and early adulthood, and probably help decrease intimate partner violence and self-directed violence in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Caldera D, etal | year = 2007 | title = Impact of a statewide home visiting program on parenting and on child health and development | url = | journal = Child Abuse and Neglect | volume = 31 | issue = 8| pages = 829–852 | doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2007.02.008| pmid = 17822765 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Caldera | year = 1997 | title = Long-term effects of home visitation on maternal life course and child abuse and neglect: 15 year follow-up of a randomized trial | doi = 10.1001/jama.1997.03550080047038 | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 278 | issue = 8| pages = 637–643 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Life skills in youth ====
Evidence shows that the [[life skills]] acquired in social development programmes can reduce involvement in violence, improve social skills, boost educational achievement and improve job prospects. Life skills refer to social, emotional, and behavioural competencies which help children and adolescents effectively deal with the challenges of everyday life.

==== Gender equality ====
Evaluation studies are beginning to support community interventions that aim to prevent [[violence against women]] by promoting [[gender equality]]. For instance, evidence suggests that programmes that combine microfinance with gender equity training can reduce intimate partner violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Pronyk PM, etal | year = 2006| title = Effect of a structural intervention for the prevention of intimate-partner violence and HIV in rural South Africa: a cluster randomised trial | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 368| issue = 9551| pages = 1973–83 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69744-4 | pmid=17141704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kim JC, Watts CH, Hargreaves JR, etal | year = 2007| title = Understanding the impact of a microfinance-based intervention on women's empowerment and the reduction of intimate partner violence in South Africa | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 97| issue = 10| pages = 1794–1802 | doi=10.2105/ajph.2006.095521 | pmid=17761566 | pmc=1994170}}&lt;/ref&gt; School-based programmes such as Safe Dates programme in the United States of America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Foshee VA, etal | year = 1998| title = An evaluation of safe dates an adolescent dating violence prevention programme | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 1998 | issue = 88| pages = 45–50 | doi=10.2105/ajph.88.1.45| pmc = 1508378 | pmid=9584032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Foshee| year = 2005 | title = Safe Dates" using random coefficient regression modelling | url = | journal = Prevention Science | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 245–257 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Youth Relationship Project in Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Wolfe D, etal | year = 2009 | title = Dating violence prevention with at risk youth: a controlled outcome evaluation | url = | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 71 | issue = 2| pages = 279–291 | doi=10.1037/0022-006x.71.2.279}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been found to be effective for reducing dating violence.

==== Cultural norms ====
Rules or expectations of behaviour – norms – within a cultural or social group can encourage violence. Interventions that challenge cultural and [[social norms]] supportive of violence can prevent acts of violence and have been widely used, but the evidence base for their effectiveness is currently weak. The effectiveness of interventions addressing [[dating violence]] and [[sexual abuse]] among teenagers and young adults by challenging social and cultural norms related to gender is supported by some evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fabiano P | year = 2003 | title = Engaging men as social justice allies in ending violence against women: evidence for a social norms approach | url = | journal = Journal of American College Health | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 105–112 | doi=10.1080/07448480309595732| pmid = 14992295 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce S.

Little Falls, NJ, PaperClip Communications, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Support programmes ====
Interventions to identify victims of interpersonal violence and provide effective care and support are critical for protecting health and breaking cycles of violence from one generation to the next. Examples for which evidence of effectiveness is emerging includes: screening tools to identify victims of intimate partner violence and refer them to appropriate services;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Olive P | year = 2007 | title = Care for emergency department patients who have experienced domestic violence: a review of the evidence base | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Nursing | volume = 16 | issue = 9| pages = 1736–1748 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.01746.x| pmid = 17727592 }}&lt;/ref&gt; psychosocial interventions – such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy – to reduce mental health problems associated with violence, including post-traumatic stress disorder;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roberts GL | year = 1997 | title = Impact of an education program about domestic violence on nurses and doctors in an Australian emergency department | url = | journal = Journal of Emergency Nursing | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 220–226 | doi=10.1016/s0099-1767(97)90011-8|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and protection orders, which prohibit a perpetrator from contacting the victim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Holt VL, etal | year = 2003| title = Do protection orders affect the likelihood of future partner violence and injury? | url = | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 2003 | issue = 24| pages = 16–21 | doi=10.1016/s0749-3797(02)00576-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=McFarlane J, etal | year = 2004| title = Protection orders and intimate partner violence: an 18-month study of 150 Black, Hispanic, and White women | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 2004 | issue = 94| pages = 613–618 | doi=10.2105/ajph.94.4.613| pmc = 1448307 | pmid=15054014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce repeat victimization among victims of intimate partner violence.

=== Collective violence ===
Not surprisingly, scientific evidence about the effectiveness of interventions to prevent collective violence is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Zwi, Garfield, &amp; Loretti (2002) Collective violence, In Krug et al (Eds) World report on violence and health, WHO&lt;/ref&gt;  However, policies that facilitate [[poverty reduction|reductions in poverty]], that make [[decision-making]] more accountable, that reduce inequalities between groups, as well as policies that reduce access to biological, chemical, nuclear and other weapons have been recommended. When planning responses to violent conflicts, recommended approaches include assessing at an early stage who is most vulnerable and what their needs are, co-ordination of activities between various players and working towards global, national and local capabilities so as to deliver effective health services during the various stages of an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;Zwi, Garfield, &amp; Loretti (2002) Collective violence, In Krug et al (Eds) World report on violence and health&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminal justice ===
One of the main functions of [[law]] is to regulate violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = David Joseph E | year = 2006 | title = The One who is More Violent Prevails – Law and Violence from a Talmudic Legal Perspective | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Law and Jurisprudence | volume = 19 | issue = 2| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Max Weber]] stated that the state claims the [[monopoly of the legitimate use of force]] practised within the confines of a specific territory. [[Law]] enforcement is the main means of regulating nonmilitary violence in society. Governments regulate the use of violence through [[legal system]]s governing individuals and political authorities, including the [[police]] and [[military]]. Civil societies authorize some amount of violence, exercised through the [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]], to maintain the status quo and enforce laws.

However, German political theorist [[Hannah Arendt]] noted: "Violence can be justifiable, but it never will be legitimate ... Its justification loses in plausibility the farther its intended end recedes into the future. No one questions the use of violence in self-defence, because the danger is not only clear but also present, and the end justifying the means is immediate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Arendt | first = Hannah | title = On Violence | publisher = Harvest Book | page = 52 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt made a clear distinction between violence and power. Most political theorists regarded violence as an extreme manifestation of power whereas Arendt regarded the two concepts as opposites.&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, H. (1972) On Violence in Crises in the Republic, Florida, Harcourt, Brace and Company, pp 134-155.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 20th century in acts of [[democide]] governments may have killed more than 260 million of their own people through [[police brutality]], [[execution]], [[massacre]], slave [[labour camps]], and sometimes through intentional [[List of famines#20th century|famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM|title=20th Century Democide|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301064559/http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM|archivedate=2006-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/war-1900.htm|title=Atlas – Wars and Democide of the Twentieth Century|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110130810/http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/war-1900.htm|archivedate=2007-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violent acts that are not carried out by the military or police and that are not in [[self-defense]] are usually classified as [[crimes]], although not all crimes are [[violent crime]]s. [[Property damage|Damage to property]] is classified as violent crime in some jurisdictions but not in all.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) classifies violence resulting in [[homicide]] into [[murder|criminal homicide]] and [[justifiable homicide]] (e.g. self-defense).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/handbook/ucrhandbook04.pdf|title=Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook|year=2004|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503055659/https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/handbook/ucrhandbook04.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-03|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal justice approach sees its main task as enforcing laws that proscribe violence and ensuring that "justice is done". The notions of individual blame, responsibility, guilt, and culpability are central to criminal justice's approach to violence and one of the criminal justice system's main tasks is to "do justice", i.e. to ensure that offenders are properly identified, that the degree of their guilt is as accurately ascertained as possible, and that they are punished appropriately. To prevent and respond to violence, the criminal justice approach relies primarily on deterrence, incarceration and the punishment and rehabilitation of perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;M. Moore "Public Health and Criminal Justice Approaches to Prevention."1992. In Vol. 16 of Crime and Justice: A Review of Research, edited by M. Tonry. Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal justice approach, beyond justice and punishment, has traditionally emphasized indicated interventions, aimed at those who have already been involved in violence, either as victims or as perpetrators. One of the main reasons offenders are arrested, prosecuted, and convicted is to prevent further crimes – through deterrence (threatening potential offenders with criminal sanctions if they commit crimes), incapacitation (physically preventing offenders from committing further crimes by locking them up) and through rehabilitation (using time spent under state supervision to develop skills or change one's psychological make-up to reduce the likelihood of future offences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Prothrow-Stith D | year = 2004 | title = Strengthening the collaboration between public health and criminal justice to prevent violence | url = | journal = Journal of Law, Medicine, and Ethics | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 82–94 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2004.tb00451.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades in many countries in the world, the criminal justice system has taken an increasing interest in preventing violence before it occurs. For instance, much of community and [[problem-oriented policing]] aims to reduce crime and violence by altering the conditions that foster it – and not to increase the number of arrests. Indeed, some police leaders have gone so far as to say the police should primarily be a crime prevention agency.&lt;ref&gt;Bratton W (with Knobler P). Turnaround: how America's top cop reversed the crime epidemic. New York: Random House, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenile justice systems – an important component of criminal justice systems – are largely based on the belief in rehabilitation and prevention. In the US, the criminal justice system has, for instance, funded school- and community-based initiatives to reduce children's access to guns and teach conflict resolution. In 1974, the US Department of Justice assumed primary responsibility for delinquency prevention programmes and created the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, which has supported the "Blueprints for violence prevention" programme at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence [http://www.colorado.edu/cspv/blueprints "Blueprints for violence prevention/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103080341/http://www.colorado.edu/cspv/blueprints/ |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public health ===
The public health approach is a science-driven, population-based, interdisciplinary, intersectoral approach based on the ecological model which emphasizes primary prevention.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt; Rather than focusing on individuals, the public health approach aims to provide the maximum benefit for the largest number of people, and to extend better care and safety to entire populations. The public health approach is interdisciplinary, drawing upon knowledge from many disciplines including medicine, epidemiology, sociology, psychology, criminology, education and economics. Because all forms of violence are multi-faceted problems, the public health approach emphasizes a multi-sectoral response. It has been proved time and again that cooperative efforts from such diverse sectors as health, education, social welfare, and criminal justice are often necessary to solve what are usually assumed to be purely "criminal" or "medical" problems. The public health approach considers that violence, rather than being the result of any single factor, is the outcome of multiple risk factors and causes, interacting at four levels of a nested hierarchy (individual, close relationship/family, community and wider society) of the [[Social ecological model]].

From a public health perspective, prevention strategies can be classified into three types:
* Primary prevention – approaches that aim to prevent violence before it occurs.
* Secondary prevention – approaches that focus on the more immediate responses to violence, such as pre-hospital care, emergency services or treatment for sexually transmitted infections following a rape.
* Tertiary prevention – approaches that focus on long-term care in the wake of violence, such as rehabilitation and reintegration, and attempt to lessen trauma or reduce long-term disability associated with violence.

A public health approach emphasizes the primary prevention of violence, i.e. stopping them from occurring in the first place. Until recently, this approach has been relatively neglected in the field, with the majority of resources directed towards secondary or tertiary prevention. Perhaps the most critical element of a public health approach to prevention is the ability to identify underlying causes rather than focusing upon more visible "symptoms". This allows for the development and testing of effective approaches to address the underlying causes and so improve health.

The public health approach is an evidence-based and systematic process involving the following four steps:
# Defining the problem conceptually and numerically, using statistics that accurately describe the nature and scale of violence, the characteristics of those most affected, the geographical distribution of incidents, and the consequences of exposure to such violence.
# Investigating why the problem occurs by determining its causes and correlates, the factors that increase or decrease the risk of its occurrence (risk and protective factors) and the factors that might be modifiable through intervention.
# Exploring ways to prevent the problem by using the above information and designing, monitoring and rigorously assessing the effectiveness of programmes through outcome evaluations.
# Disseminating information on the effectiveness of programmes and increasing the scale of proven effective programmes. Approaches to prevent violence, whether targeted at individuals or entire communities, must be properly evaluated for their effectiveness and the results shared. This step also includes adapting programmes to local contexts and subjecting them to rigorous re-evaluation to ensure their effectiveness in the new setting.

In many countries, violence prevention is still a new or emerging field in public health. The public health community has started only recently to realize the contributions it can make to reducing violence and mitigating its consequences. In 1949, Gordon called for injury prevention efforts to be based on the understanding of causes, in a similar way to prevention efforts for communicable and other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon JE, "The epidemiology of accidents," ''American Journal of Public Health'', 1949; 504–15.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Gomez, referring to the WHO definition of health, stated that it is obvious that violence does not contribute to "extending life" or to a "complete state of well-being". He defined violence as an issue that public health experts needed to address and stated that it should not be the primary domain of lawyers, military personnel, or politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Abad Gomez H | year = 1962 | title = Violence requires epidemiological studies | url = | journal = Tribuna Medica | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is only in the last 30 years that public health has begun to address violence, and only in the last fifteen has it done so at the global level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dahlberg L. |author2=Mercy J. | year = 2009 | title = History of violence as a public health issue | url = | journal = AMA Virtual Mentor | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 167–172 | doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2009.11.2.mhst1-0902|pmid=23190546 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a much shorter period of time than public health has been tackling other health problems of comparable magnitude and with similarly severe lifelong consequences.

The global public health response to interpersonal violence began in earnest in the mid-1990s. In 1996, the World Health Assembly adopted Resolution WHA49.25&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/resources/publications/en/WHA4925_eng.pdf "WHA49.25 Prevention of violence: a public health priority"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122193242/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/resources/publications/en/WHA4925_eng.pdf |date=2013-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which declared violence "a leading worldwide public health problem" and requested that the World Health Organization (WHO) initiate public health activities to (1) document and characterize the burden of violence, (2) assess the effectiveness of programmes, with particular attention to women and children and community-based initiatives, and (3) promote activities to tackle the problem at the international and national levels. The World Health Organization's initial response to this resolution was to create the Department of Violence and Injury Prevention and Disability and to publish the World report on violence and health (2002).&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

The case for the public health sector addressing interpersonal violence rests on four main arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Prothrow-Stith D | year = 2004 | title = Strengthening the collaboration between public health and criminal justice to prevent violence | url = | journal = Journal of Law, Medicine, and Ethics | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 82–88 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2004.tb00451.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the significant amount of time health care professionals dedicate to caring for victims and perpetrators of violence has made them familiar with the problem and has led many, particularly in emergency departments, to mobilize to address it. The information, resources, and infrastructures the health care sector has at its disposal are an important asset for research and prevention work. Second, the magnitude of the problem and its potentially severe lifelong consequences and high costs to individuals and wider society call for population-level interventions typical of the public health approach. Third, the criminal justice approach, the other main approach to addressing violence (link to entry above), has traditionally been more geared towards violence that occurs between male youths and adults in the street and other public places – which makes up the bulk of homicides in most countries – than towards violence occurring in private settings such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence and elder abuse – which makes up the largest share of non-fatal violence. Fourth, evidence is beginning to accumulate that a science-based public health approach is effective at preventing interpersonal violence.

=== Human rights ===
[[File:Abdulredha Buhmaid on floor.jpeg|thumb|[[Bahrain]]'s pro-democracy protesters killed by military, February 2011]]
The [[human rights]] approach is based on the obligations of states to respect, protect and fulfill human rights and therefore to prevent, eradicate and punish violence. It recognizes violence as a violation of many human rights: the rights to life, liberty, [[autonomy]] and security of the person; the rights to equality and non-discrimination; the rights to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment; the right to [[privacy]]; and the [[right to health|right to the highest attainable standard of health]]. These human rights are enshrined in [[international human rights law|international and regional treaties]] and national constitutions and laws, which stipulate the obligations of states, and include mechanisms to hold states accountable. The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], for example, requires that countries party to the Convention take all appropriate steps to end violence against women. The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] in its Article 19 states that States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.

=== Geographical context ===
Violence, as defined in the dictionary of human geography, "appears whenever power is in jeopardy" and "in and of itself stands emptied of strength and purpose: it is part of a larger matrix of socio-political power struggles".&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009"&gt;Hyndman, J. (2009) Violence in Gregory, D., Johnston, R., Pratt, G., Watts, M. and Whatmore, S. eds. Dictionary of Human Geography, Wiley-Blackwell, NJ: 798-799.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence can be broadly divided into three broad categories – direct violence, structural violence and cultural violence.&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt; Thus defined and delineated, it is of note, as Hyndman says, that "geography came late to theorizing violence"&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt; in comparison to other social sciences. Social and human geography, rooted in the [[Humanism|humanist]], [[Marxist]], and [[Feminist theory|feminist]] subfields that emerged following the early positivist approaches and subsequent behavioral turn, have long been concerned with social and spatial justice.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, S. (2001) Social Geography, in Smelser, N. and Baltes, P. eds. International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences, Oxford, Elsevier, 14293-14299.&lt;/ref&gt;
Along with critical geographers and political geographers, it is these groupings of geographers that most often interact with violence. Keeping this idea of social/spatial justice via geography in mind, it is worthwhile to look at geographical approaches to violence in the context of politics.

Derek Gregory and Alan Pred assembled the influential edited collection ''Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence'', which demonstrates how place, space, and landscape are foremost factors in the real and imagined practices of organized violence both historically and in the present.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Derek and Pred, Alan'', 2006 Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, political violence often gives a part for the state to play. When "modern states not only claim a monopoly of the legitimate means of violence; they also routinely use the threat of violence to enforce the rule of law",&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt; the law not only becomes a form of violence but is violence.&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt; Philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]]'s concepts of [[state of exception]] and ''[[homo sacer]]'' are useful to consider within a geography of violence. The state, in the grip of a perceived, potential crisis (whether legitimate or not) takes preventative legal measures, such as a suspension of rights (it is in this climate, as Agamben demonstrates, that the formation of the Social Democratic and Nazi government's lager or concentration camp can occur). However, when this "in limbo" reality is designed to be in place "until further notice…the state of exception thus ceases to be referred to as an external and provisional state of factual danger and comes to be confused with juridical rule itself".&lt;ref name="Agamben, G. 1998"&gt;Agamben, G. (1998) ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life'', Stanford University Press, Stanford.&lt;/ref&gt; For Agamben, the physical space of the camp "is a piece of land placed outside the normal juridical order, but it is nevertheless not simply an external space".&lt;ref name="Agamben, G. 1998" /&gt; At the scale of the body, in the state of exception, a person is so removed from their rights by "juridical procedures and deployments of power"&lt;ref name="Agamben, G. 1998" /&gt; that "no act committed against them could appear any longer as a crime";&lt;ref name="Agamben, G. 1998" /&gt; in other words, people become only ''homo sacer''. [[Guantanamo Bay]] could also be said to represent the physicality of the state of exception in space, and can just as easily draw man as homo sacer.

In the 1970s, genocides in Cambodia under the [[Khmer Rouge]] and [[Pol Pot]] resulted in the deaths of over two million Cambodians (which was 25% of the Cambodian population), forming one of the many contemporary examples of state-sponsored violence.&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002"&gt;Ringer, G. (2002) "Killing Fields", in Christensen, K. and Levinson, D. eds. ''Encyclopedia of Modern Asia'', Charles Scribner's Sons, New York: 368-370.&lt;/ref&gt; About fourteen thousand of these murders occurred at [[Choeung Ek]], which is the best-known of the extermination camps referred to as the [[Killing Fields]].&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; The killings were arbitrary; for example, a person could be killed for wearing glasses, since that was seen as associating them with intellectuals and therefore as making them part of the enemy. People were murdered with impunity because it was no crime; Cambodians were made ''homo sacer'' in a condition of bare life. The Killing Fields—manifestations of Agamben's concept of camps beyond the normal rule of law—featured the state of exception. As part of Pol Pot's "ideological intent…to create a purely agrarian society or cooperative",&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; he "dismantled the country's existing economic infrastructure and depopulated every urban area".&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; Forced movement, such as this forced movement applied by Pol Pot, is a clear display of structural violence. When "symbols of Cambodian society were equally disrupted, social institutions of every kind…were purged or torn down",&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; cultural violence (defined as when "any aspect of culture such as language, religion, ideology, art, or cosmology is used to legitimize direct or structural violence"&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt;) is added to the structural violence of forced movement and to the direct violence, such as murder, at the Killing Fields. Vietnam eventually intervened and the genocide officially ended. However, ten million landmines left by opposing guerillas in the 1970s&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; continue to create a violent landscape in Cambodia.

Human geography, though coming late to the theorizing table, has tackled violence through many lenses, including anarchist geography, feminist geography, Marxist geography, political geography, and critical geography. However, [[Adriana Cavarero]] notes that, "as violence spreads and assumes unheard-of forms, it becomes difficult to name in contemporary language".&lt;ref name="Cavarero, A. 2009"&gt;Cavarero, A. (2009) ''Horrorism: Naming Contemporary Violence'', Columbia University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Cavarero proposes that, in facing such a truth, it is prudent to reconsider violence as "horrorism"; that is, "as though ideally all the…victims, instead of their killers, ought to determine the name".&lt;ref name="Cavarero, A. 2009" /&gt; With geography often adding the forgotten spatial aspect to theories of social science, rather than creating them solely within the discipline, it seems that the self-reflexive contemporary geography of today may have an extremely important place in this current (re)imaging of violence, exemplified by Cavarero.{{clarify|date=November 2014}}

== Epidemiology ==
[[File:No Violence Sign.jpg|thumb|A sign that calls to stop violence]]
As of 2010, all forms of violence resulted in about 1.34 million deaths up from about 1 million in 1990.&lt;ref name=Loz2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 15, 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095–128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0|first2=M|last3=Foreman|first3=K|last4=Lim|first4=S|last5=Shibuya|first5=K|last6=Aboyans|first6=V|last7=Abraham|first7=J|last8=Adair|first8=T|last9=Aggarwal|first9=R|last10=Ahn|first10=SY|last11=Alvarado|first11=M|last12=Anderson|first12=HR|last13=Anderson|first13=LM|last14=Andrews|first14=KG|last15=Atkinson|first15=C|last16=Baddour|first16=LM|last17=Barker-Collo|first17=S|last18=Bartels|first18=DH|last19=Bell|first19=ML|last20=Benjamin|first20=EJ|last21=Bennett|first21=D|last22=Bhalla|first22=K|last23=Bikbov|first23=B|last24=Bin Abdulhak|first24=A|last25=Birbeck|first25=G|last26=Blyth|first26=F|last27=Bolliger|first27=I|last28=Boufous|first28=S|last29=Bucello|first29=C|last30=Burch|first30=M|last2=Naghavi|display-authors=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suicide]] accounts for about 883,000, interpersonal violence for 456,000 and collective violence for 18,000.&lt;ref name=Loz2012 /&gt; Deaths due to collective violence have decreased from 64,000 in 1990.&lt;ref name=Loz2012 /&gt;

By way of comparison, the 1.5 millions deaths a year due to violence is greater than the number of deaths due to tuberculosis (1.34 million), road traffic injuries (1.21 million), and malaria (830'000), but slightly less than the number of people who die from HIV/AIDS (1.77 million).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html "Global Burden of Disease, Disease and injury regional estimates"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224055121/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html |date=2010-12-24 }}, World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

For every death due to violence, there are numerous nonfatal injuries. In 2008, over 16 million cases of non-fatal violence-related injuries were severe enough to require medical attention. Beyond deaths and injuries, forms of violence such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and elder maltreatment have been found to be highly prevalent.

=== Self-directed violence ===
In the last 45 years, suicide rates have increased by 60% worldwide.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Suicide is among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15–44 years in some countries, and the second leading cause of death in the 10–24 years age group.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} These figures do not include suicide attempts which are up to 20 times more frequent than completed suicide.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Suicide was the 16th leading cause of death worldwide in 2004 and is projected to increase to the 12th in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/EN_WHS08_Full.pdf "World Health Statistics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030212923/http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/EN_WHS08_Full.pdf |date=2011-10-30 }} World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although suicide rates have traditionally been highest among the male elderly, rates among young people have been increasing to such an extent that they are now the group at highest risk in a third of countries, in both developed and developing countries.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Interpersonal violence ===
Rates and patterns of violent death vary by country and region. In recent years, homicide rates have been highest in developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean and lowest in East Asia, the western Pacific, and some countries in northern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html "Global Burden of Disease"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224055121/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html |date=2010-12-24 }}, World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show a strong, inverse relationship between homicide rates and both economic development and economic equality. Poorer countries, especially those with large gaps between the rich and the poor, tend to have higher rates of homicide than wealthier countries. Homicide rates differ markedly by age and sex. Gender differences are least marked for children. For the 15 to 29 age group, male rates were nearly six times those for female rates; for the remaining age groups, male rates were from two to four times those for females.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg ML, Butchart A, Mercy J, Narasimhan V, Waters H, Marshall MS. Interpersonal violence. In Jamison DT, Breman JG, Measham AR, Alleyne G, Claeson M, Evans DB, Prabhat J, Mills A, Musgrove P (eds.) Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, 2nd Edition. Washington, D.C.: Oxford University Press and The World Bank, 2006: 755-770.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in a number of countries show that, for every homicide among young people age 10 to 24, 20 to 40 other young people receive hospital treatment for a violent injury.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

Forms of violence such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence are highly prevalent. Approximately 20% of women and 5–10% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25–50% of all children report being physically abused.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs150/en/index.html "Child maltreatment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229124411/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs150/en/index.html |date=2011-12-29 }}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A WHO multi-country study found that between 15–71% of women reported experiencing physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/index.html "Violence against women"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228151643/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/index.html |date=2011-12-28 }}, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collective violence ===
Wars grab headlines, but the individual risk of dying violently in an armed conflict is today relatively low—much lower than the risk of violent death in many countries that are not suffering from an armed conflict. For example, between 1976 and 2008, [[African American]]s were victims of 329,825 homicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homicide trends in the United States |publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics |url=http://www1.cj.msu.edu/~outreach/mvaa/Homicide/Homicide%20Trends%20in%20the%20United%20States.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010151657/http://www.cj.msu.edu/~outreach/mvaa/Homicide/Homicide%20Trends%20in%20the%20United%20States.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homicide Victims by Race and Sex |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/law_enforcement_courts_prisons/crimes_and_crime_rates.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323173400/http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/law_enforcement_courts_prisons/crimes_and_crime_rates.html |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is a widespread perception that war is the most dangerous form of armed violence in the world, the average person living in a conflict-affected country had a risk of dying violently in the conflict of about 2.0 per 100,000 population between 2004 and 2007. This can be compared to the average world homicide rate of 7.6 per 100,000 people. This illustration highlights the value of accounting for all forms of armed violence rather than an exclusive focus on conflict related violence. Certainly, there are huge variations in the risk of dying from armed conflict at the national and subnational level, and the risk of dying violently in a conflict in specific countries remains extremely high. In Iraq, for example, the direct conflict death rate for 2004–07 was 65 per 100,000 people per year and, in Somalia, 24 per 100,000 people. This rate even reached peaks of 91 per 100,000 in Iraq in 2006 and 74 per 100,000 in Somalia in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Krause, Robert Muggah, and Achim Wennmann, "Global Burden of Armed Violence," Geneva Declaration Secretariat, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fry]] writes that scholars are divided on the origins of this greater degree of violence—in other words, war-like behavior: {{quote|There are basically two schools of thought on this issue. One holds that warfare... goes back at least to the time of the first thoroughly modern humans and even before then to the primate ancestors of the hominid lineage. The second positions on the origins of warfare sees war as much less common in the cultural and biological evolution of humans. Here, warfare is a latecomer on the cultural horizon, only arising in very specific material circumstances and being quite rare in human history until the development of agriculture in the past 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fry, Douglas P.|title=War, Peace, and Human Nature: The Convergence of Evolutionary and Cultural Views|page=168|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8eJoAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22one+of+the+critical+issues%22|isbn=978-0-19-985900-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jared Diamond]] in his books ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel]]'' and ''[[The Third Chimpanzee]]'' posits that the rise of large-scale warfare is the result of advances in technology and city-states. For instance, the rise of agriculture provided a significant increase in the number of individuals that a region could sustain over hunter-gatherer societies, allowing for development of specialized classes such as soldiers, or weapons manufacturers.

In academia, the idea of the peaceful pre-history and non-violent tribal societies gained popularity with the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial perspective]]. The trend, starting in [[archaeology]] and spreading to [[anthropology]] reached its height in the late half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Keely1&gt;Keeley, Lawrence H. War before Civilization.

Lawrence H. Keeley at the University of Illinois writes in ''[[War Before Civilization]]'' that 87% of [[tribal societies]] were at war more than once per year, and that 65% of them were fighting continuously. He writes that the attrition rate of numerous close-quarter clashes, which characterize [[endemic warfare]], produces casualty rates of up to 60%, compared to 1% of the combatants as is typical in modern warfare. "Primitive Warfare" of these small groups or tribes was driven by the basic need for sustenance and violent competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.troynovant.com/Franson/Keeley/War-Before-Civilization.html Review of book "War Before Civilization" by Lawrence H.

Fry explores Keeley's argument in depth and counters that such sources erroneously focus on the ethnography of hunters and gatherers in the present, whose culture and values have been infiltrated externally by modern civilization, rather than the actual archaeological record spanning some two million years of human existence. Fry determines that all present ethnographically studied tribal societies, "by the very fact of having been described and published by anthropologists, have been irrevocably impacted by history and modern colonial nation states" and that "many have been affected by state societies for at least 5000 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fry, Douglas P.|title=War, Peace, and Human Nature: The Convergence of Evolutionary and Cultural Views|pages=171–3|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Better Angels of Our Nature'' ===
[[Steven Pinker]]'s 2011 book, ''[[The Better Angels of Our Nature]]'', roused both acclaim and controversy by asserting that modern society is less violent than in periods of the past, whether on the short scale of decades or long scale of centuries or millennia.

Steven Pinker argues that by every possible measure, every type of violence has drastically decreased since ancient and medieval times. A few centuries ago, for example, [[genocide]] was a standard practice in all kinds of warfare and was so common that historians did not even bother to mention it. According to Pinker, rape, murder, warfare and animal cruelty have all seen drastic declines in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Pinker&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Steven Pinker]] |title=The Better Angels of Our Nature |isbn=978-0-670-02295-3|year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pinker's analyses have met with much criticism;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=bookreview-steven-pinker-the-better-angels-of-our-nature-why-violence-has-declined |title=Book Review |author=R Epstein |publisher=Scientific American |date=October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914140139/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=bookreview-steven-pinker-the-better-angels-of-our-nature-why-violence-has-declined |archivedate=2016-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laws"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=702 |title=Against Pinker's Violence |first=Ben |last=Laws |journal=[[Ctheory]] |date=21 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512052358/http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=702 |archivedate=12 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Herman Edward S. | author2 = Peterson David | year =  | title = Steven Pinker on the alleged decline of violence | url = http://isreview.org/issue/86/steven-pinker-alleged-decline-violence | journal = International Socialist Review | volume = 86 | issue =  | page =  | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150319022936/http://isreview.org/issue/86/steven-pinker-alleged-decline-violence | archivedate = 2015-03-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/03/the_big_kill?page=full |title=The Big Kill – By John Arquilla |publisher=Foreign Policy |date=2012-12-03 |accessdate=2013-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107171044/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/03/the_big_kill?page=full |archivedate=2013-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, Pinker himself, on his FAQ page, states that he does not include catastrophic ecological violence (including violence against wild or domesticated non-human animals or plants, or against ecosystems) or the violence of economic inequality and of coercive working conditions in his definition; he controversially regards these forms of violence as "metaphorical". Some critics have therefore argued that Pinker suffers from "a reductive vision of what it means to be violent."&lt;ref name="Laws" /&gt;

== Society and culture ==

Beyond deaths and injuries, highly prevalent forms of violence (such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence) have serious lifelong non-injury health consequences. Victims may engage in high-risk behaviours such as alcohol and substance misuse and smoking, which in turn can contribute to cardiovascular disorders, cancers, depression, diabetes and HIV/AIDS, resulting in premature death&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ace/index.htm "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170920185014/https://www.cdc.gov/ace/index.htm |date=2017-09-20 }}, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eye for an eye|Violence may beget violence]]. The balances of prevention, mitigation, mediation and exacerbation are complex, and vary with the underpinnings of violence.

=== Economic effects ===
In countries with high levels of violence, economic growth can be slowed down, personal and collective security eroded, and social development impeded. Families edging out of poverty and investing in schooling their sons and daughters can be ruined through the violent death or severe disability of the main breadwinner. Communities can be caught in poverty traps where pervasive violence and deprivation form a vicious circle that stifles economic growth. For societies, meeting the direct costs of health, criminal justice, and social welfare responses to violence diverts many billions of dollars from more constructive societal spending. The much larger indirect costs of violence due to lost productivity and lost investment in education work together to slow economic development, increase socioeconomic inequality, and erode human and social capital.

Additionally, communities with high level of violence do not provide the level of stability and predictability vital for a prospering business economy. Individuals will be less likely to invest money and effort towards growth in such unstable and violent conditions.

In 2016, the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]], released the [http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/02/The-Economic-Value-of-Peace-2016-WEB.pdf Economic Value of Peace] report, which estimates the economic impact of violence and conflict on the global economy, the total economic impact of violence on the world economy in 2015 was estimated to be $13.6 trillion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/how-much-does-violence-really-cost-our-global-economy/|title=How much does violence really cost our global economy?|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2017-06-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913201606/https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/how-much-does-violence-really-cost-our-global-economy|archivedate=2017-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[purchasing power parity]] terms.

Throughout history, most religions and individuals like [[Mahatma Gandhi]] have preached that humans are capable of eliminating individual violence and organizing societies through purely [[nonviolent]] means. Gandhi himself once wrote: "A society organized and run on the basis of complete non-violence would be the purest [[anarchy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Bharatan Kumarappa, Editor, "For Pacifists," by M.K. Gandhi, Navajivan Publishing House, Ahmedabad, India, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern political ideologies which espouse similar views include pacifist varieties of [[Voluntaryism|voluntarism]], [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], [[anarchism]] and [[libertarianism]].

Terence Fretheim writing about the Old Testament:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

For many people, ... only physical violence truly qualifies as violence. But, certainly, violence is more than killing people, unless one includes all those words and actions that kill people slowly. The effect of limitation to a “killing fields” perspective is the widespread neglect of many other forms of violence. We must insist that violence also refers to that which is psychologically destructive, that which demeans, damages, or depersonalizes others.  In view of these considerations, violence may be defined as follows: any action, verbal or nonverbal, oral or written, physical or psychical, active or passive, public or private, individual or institutional/societal, human or divine, in whatever degree of intensity, that abuses, violates, injures, or kills. Some of the most pervasive and most dangerous forms of violence are those that are often hidden from view (against women and children, especially); just beneath the surface in many of our homes, churches, and communities is abuse enough to freeze the
blood. Moreover, many forms of systemic violence often slip past our attention because they are so much a part of the infrastructure of life (e.g., racism, sexism, ageism).&lt;ref name=Fretheim&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Word &amp; World |first=Terence |last=Freitheim |title=God and Violence in the Old Testament |volume=24 |issue=1 |date=Winter 2004 |url=http://wordandworld.luthersem.edu/content/pdfs/24-1_Violence/24-1_Fretheim.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119093532/http://wordandworld.luthersem.edu/content/pdfs/24-1_Violence/24-1_Fretheim.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vyūha''' ([[Sanskrit]]: व्यूह) means - 'to arrange troops in a battle array (formation)', 'to arrange, put or place in order, to dispose, separate, divide, alter, transpose, disarrange, resolve (vowels syllables etc.)'. Its root is व्यः which means - a 'cover' or 'veil'. This word also refers to emanation and to the manifest power of Lord [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=the Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|pages=157, 1522|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?p.5:192.apte }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has different meanings depending on the doctrine of the treatise and the context, such as revealing of the knowledge of Vedas, manifestation of Vishnu or Buddha, and the war formations of Mahabharata.

==Concept of Vyuh in Upanishads: Unraveling of the Knowledge==
In the [[Upanishads]] the word ''vyuha'' occurs once, it appears in śloka 16 of the [[Isha Upanishad]] :-

:पूषन्नेकर्षे यम सूर्य प्राजापत्य व्यूह रश्मिन्समूह |
:तेजो यत्ते रूपं कल्याणतमं तत्ते पश्यामि योऽसावसौ पुरुषः सोऽहमस्मि ||

:"O Sun, sole traveler of the Heavens, controller of all, [[Surya]], son of [[Prajapati]]; remove thy rays and gather up the burning light. I behold thy glorious form; I am he, the [[Purusha]] within thee."

In this passage ''vyūha'' means – 'remove' (to a distance thy rays). The sage declares that the Truth is concealed in the [[Vedas]], covered by a golden lid or vessel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Upanishads and Sri Sankara’s Bhasya|publisher=V.C. Seshacharri|page=24|url= https://archive.org/stream/upanishadssrisan00sita#page/24/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Badarayana]], by declaring  – उत्पत्त्यसम्भवात् (Owing to the impossibility of origin) - [[Brahma Sutras]] (II.ii.42) refutes the [[Bhagavata]] view that the ''Chatur-vyūha'' forms originate successively from [[Vasudeva]], for any origin for the soul is impossible, an implement cannot originate from its agent who wields it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sankaracarya|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=439|url= http://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Detail/8121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in a ''vyūha'' an army re-sets its different able warriors and weaponry into a specific arrangement as per battle demands, the Supreme Being re-sets the contents of consciousness through yogamaya with each formation concealing yet another formation. The five layers of matter (''prakrti'') that constitute the human body are the five sheaths (''panchakosa''), one moves inwards from the visible layers through more refined invisible layers in search of own true self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Body of God|author=D.Dennis Hudson|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=40, 42|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=IMCxbOezDi4C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=vyuha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y02eVLTXIc2HuAT76ILACQ&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=vyuha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept of Vayuh in Pancaratra: The Vaishnav doctrine of manifestation==
The [[Pancaratra|Pāñcarātra Āgama]], which are based on ''Ekāyana'' recension of the [[Yajurveda|Śukla Yajurveda]], is later than the [[Vedas]] but earlier than the [[Mahabharata]], the main ''[[Agama (Hinduism)|āgamas]]'' are- the ''[[Vaishnavism|Vaiśnava]]'' (worship of [[Vishnu]]), the ''[[Shaivism|Śaiva]]'' (worship of [[Shiva]]) and the ''[[Shaktism|Śākta]]'' (worship of [[Devi]] or [[Shakti]]) ''āgamas''; all ''āgamas'' are elaborate systems of [[Vedic]] knowledge. According to [[Vedanta Desika]], the ''Pāñcarātra āgama'' teaches the five-fold daily religious duty consisting of – ''abhigamana'', ''[[upādāna]]'', ''ijyā'', ''[[svādhyāya]]'' and ''[[yoga]]'', the name of this ''āgama'' is derived on account of its description of the five-fold manifestation of the Supreme Being viz, ''para'' (supreme or the transcendental form), ''vyūha'' (formation or manifestation as the four ''vyūha''), ''vibhava'' (reincarnation or descent to earth as avtāra), ''arcā'' (the visible image of God) and ''antaryāmi'' (the cosmic form of God as existing everywhere and in everything).  [[Lakshmi]] accompanies Vishnu in His ''vyūha'' manifestation which is four-fold (''Chatur-vyūha'') – [[Vāsudeva]] (as the creator), [[Balarama|Samkarśana]] (as the sustainer), [[Pradyumna]] (as destroyer - dissolution of the universe) and [[Aniruddha]] (as promulgator of spiritual knowledge).

The Chatur-vyūha forms of Vishnu are related to four of the six causes of creation which six are God Himself as the final cause of creation and His five aspects – Narāyana ('thinking'), Vāsudeva ('feeling'), Samkarśana ('willing'), Pradyumna ('knowing') and Aniruddha ('acting') successively; each divinity controls its specific creative energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Creationism|author=Ashish Dalela|publisher=iUniverse|page=327|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=qLe-aZfl7YEC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;dq=vyuha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y02eVLTXIc2HuAT76ILACQ&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=vyuha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The six gunas – '' [[jnana]] '' (omniscience), '' [[aishvarya]] '' (lordship), '' [[shakti]] '' (potency), '' [[Five Strengths|bala]] '' (force), '' [[Vīrya (Hinduism)|virya]] '' (virtue) and ''tejas'' (self-sufficiency), acting in pairs and in totality, are the instruments and the subtle material of pure creation.

==Concept of Vyuha in Buddhism: The manifestation of a Buddha==
One of the five Dhyāni Buddhas, Amitābha, who does not appear in any [[Pali]] Buddhist text or in [[Sanskrit]] Buddhist text, and his active manifestation in Bodhisttava form, Avalokiteśvara, are known through the two-versioned [[Mahāyāna]] [[Buddhist]] sūtra [[Infinite Life Sutra|Sukhāvatī-vyūha]] ('Array of the Land of Bliss') which text pertains to [[Gautama Buddha]]’s recollection of one of his previous births as Amitābha, as told to [[Ānanda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World Vol.2|publisher=Concept Publishing|page=383|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=WjDcd0cTFxQC&amp;pg=PA507&amp;dq=antaryami+hinduism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U4WeVIbILdWfugSFpoHoCQ&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=vyuha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was also told about 81 Buddhas of the past, the last named being Lokeśvararāja who taught Dharmākara who having practiced the virtues of a Bodhisttava and attained enlightenment was reborn as Amitābha whose land this text describes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Literature|author=Moriz Winternitz|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=298|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Lgz1eMhu0JsC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;dq=vyuha+++buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2ZGfVIfqEIqyuATRqYD4AQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vyuha%20%20%20buddhism&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mahāyāna Buddhism, the word ''vyūha'' means – 'arrangement', the like of marvellous, supernatural, magical arrangements, or supernatural manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Visions of Sukhavati|author=Julian F.Pas|publisher=SUNY Press|page=369|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Wjv85t5E0hQC&amp;pg=PA369&amp;dq=vyuha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y02eVLTXIc2HuAT76ILACQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=vyuha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept of Vyuha in Mahabharata: The war formations==
The [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Manusmṛti|Manu Samhita]] list by name and formation many ''vyūhas'' ('battle formations'), some were small in size and others, gigantic, such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science, Technology, Imperialism and War|publisher=Pearson publication|pages=295–296|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=EJuM4FylchwC&amp;pg=PA295&amp;dq=vyuha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y02eVLTXIc2HuAT76ILACQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=vyuha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;
