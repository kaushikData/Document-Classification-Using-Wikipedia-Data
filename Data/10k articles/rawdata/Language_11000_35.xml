'''András Visky''' (born April 13, 1957) is a Romanian poet, playwright and essayist and the resident [[dramaturg]] at [[Cluj-Napoca Hungarian Theatre]], Romania, where he also holds the position of associate artistic director.  His plays have been staged in several countries including Romania, Hungary, France, Italy, Poland, Slovenia, England, Scotland and the United States.
He has a DLA (Doctor of Liberal Arts) from the University of Theatre and Film, Budapest and since 1994 he has lectured at the [[Babeş-Bolyai University]] in the Department of Theatre and Television.  He is one of the co-founders and the former executive director of Koinónia Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huntheater.ro/cv.php?soid=1 Official Website of the Hungarian Theatre of Cluj]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Childhood ==
Visky's father, Ferenc Visky, was a minister of the Hungarian Reformed Church who in 1958 was sentenced to 22 years in prison and forced labor by the Romanian Communist authorities for "the crime of organization against socialist public order."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koinonia.ro/?konyv=30&amp;kategoria= Ferenc Visky, ''The Foolishness of God''. Cluj: Koinónia Publishing, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after, his wife and their seven children were deported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.filmintezet.hu/uj/kiadvanyok/filmevkonyv/2004/dokfilm_e.htm |title=''Két hét pihenõ (Two Weeks Off).'' Documentary directed by András Z. Surányi, Duna TV, 2003 |access-date=2011-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001132132/http://www.filmintezet.hu/uj/kiadvanyok/filmevkonyv/2004/dokfilm_e.htm |archive-date=2011-10-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the Bărăgan (see [[Bărăgan deportations]]); Visky was only two years old at the time.  In 1964, his father and other political prisoners were released during a short-lived period of relative thaw in which the regime relaxed its repressive policies.  Visky himself was released the same year along with his mother and siblings.

== Professional life ==
Visky joined the [http://www.huntheater.ro Hungarian Theatre of Cluj] as dramaturg in 1990.  This was also the beginning of his long professional collaboration with [[Gábor Tompa]], the artistic director of the theatre.  The pair have worked together on innumerable performances, including plays by Shakespeare, Chekhov, Ionesco, Caragiale, Gombrowicz and Beckett, and Tompa has directed Visky's ''Júlia'', ''Tanítványok'', ''Hosszú péntek'', ''Visszaszületés'' and ''Alkoholisták''.  Visky has also worked with directors [https://web.archive.org/web/20091218063111/http://www.teatrul-odeon.ro/eng/oameni/regizori/galgotiu.htm Dragoş Galgoţiu], [[Mihai Măniuţiu]], Robert Raponja, David Zinder, [[Robert Woodruff (director)|Robert Woodruff]] and [[Karin Coonrod]].

For the 2009-2010 academic year, Visky was the Spoelhof Chair at [[Calvin College]], Grand Rapids, Michigan where he taught courses in playwriting and Hungarian and Romanian theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2009/11/two_playwrights_to_close_out_w.html Michigan Live, November 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also led workshops or taught as a guest lecturer at the [[Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design]] (Budapest), [[Northern Illinois University]] (DeKalb IL), the [[University of Michigan]] (Kalamazoo MI), the [[University of California, San Diego]] (CA), [[Yale School of Drama]] (New Haven CT), [[Károli Gáspár University]] (Budapest), [[Josai International University]] (Tokyo, Japan), and [[Osaka University]] (Osaka, Japan). In 2017 he spoke at the European Division of the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/today/cyberlc/feature_wdesc.php?rec=8016&amp;loclr=eanw András Visky's Barrack Dramaturgy Webcast, Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plays ==
Over the course of his play writing, Visky has developed what he terms a "barrack dramaturgy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://clubs.calvin.edu/chimes/article.php?id=4841 Chimes, Apriŀ 23, 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928213905/http://clubs.calvin.edu/chimes/article.php?id=4841 |date=September 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-09-14/entertainment/ct-live-0914-juliet-review-20100914_1_juliet-war-era-gulag Chicago Tribune, September 14, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415658492/ András Visky, "Barrack-dramaturgy and the captive audience" in ''The Routledge Companion to Dramaturgy'' edited by Magda Romanska.

Chicago/Bristol: University of Chicago Press/Intellect, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Having grown up in an eastern European gulag, he returns again and again in his plays to what it means to be a prisoner and the problem of being set free. His most well-known plays include ''Júlia (Juliet)'', ''Megöltem az anyámat (I Killed My Mother)'', ''Tanítványok (Disciples)'', ''Alkoholisták (Alcoholics)'', ''Visszaszületés (Born for Never'' or ''Backborn)'', ''Hosszú péntek (Long Friday)'', ''Pornó (Porn''), and ''Caravaggio Terminal (Caravaggio Terminal'').

'''''Buchwald vs. Paramount''''' (1990), {{law report|1990|Cal. App. LEXIS|634}}, was a [[breach of contract]] lawsuit filed and decided in [[California]] in which humorist and writer [[Art Buchwald]] alleged that [[Paramount Pictures]] stole his script idea and turned it into the 1988 movie ''[[Coming to America]]''. Buchwald won the lawsuit and was awarded damages, and then accepted a settlement from Paramount before any appeal took place.

The decision was important mainly for the court's determination in the damages phase of the trial that Paramount used "[[unconscionable]]" means of determining how much to pay authors, which is widely called "[[Hollywood Accounting]]." Paramount claimed, and provided accounting evidence to support the claim, that despite the movie's $288 million in revenues, it had earned no [[net profit]], according to the definition of "net profit" in Buchwald's contract, and hence Buchwald was owed nothing. The court agreed with Buchwald's argument that this was "unconscionable" and therefore invalid. Fearing a loss if it appealed, and the subsequent implications of the unconscionability decision across all its other contracts, Paramount settled for $900,000.&lt;ref&gt;(http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-17/local/me-3895_1_net-profit Buchwald, Partner Win $900,000 From Studio)&lt;/ref&gt; The case was the subject of a 1992 book, ''Fatal Subtraction: The Inside Story of Buchwald v. Paramount'' by Pierce O'Donnell, the lawyer who represented Buchwald, and ''Los Angeles Times'' reporter [[Dennis McDougal]].

==Timeline==
In 1982, Buchwald wrote a [[Film treatment|screen treatment]] titled "It's A Crude, Crude World" (later renamed "King for a Day") that was pitched to [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] of Paramount, with the intention of starring [[Eddie Murphy]], who was under contract to Paramount at the time. According to the court documents, the synopsis for "King for a Day" was:

{{quote|A rich, educated, arrogant, extravagant, despotic African [[potentate]] comes to America for a state visit. After being taken on a grand tour of the United States, the potentate arrives at the White House. A gaffe in remarks made by the President infuriates the African leader. His sexual desires are rebuffed by a black woman State Department officer assigned to him. She is requested by the President to continue to serve as the potentate's United States escort. While in the United States, the potentate is [[Deposition (politics)|deposed]], deserted by his entourage and left destitute. He ends up in the Washington ghetto, is stripped of his clothes, and befriended by a black lady. The potentate experiences a number of incidents in the ghetto, and obtains employment as a waiter. In order to avoid extradition, he marries the black lady who befriended him, becomes the emperor of the ghetto and lives happily ever after.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.degenevieve.com/files/Buchwald%20v%20Paramount.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810112608/http://www.degenevieve.com/files/Buchwald%20v%20Paramount.pdf# |date=2007-08-10 }} Buchwald v. Paramount, pp.18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Paramount [[option (films)|optioned]] the treatment in early 1983 and commissioned several unsuccessful scripts from several screenwriters. [[John Landis]] was considered as the director from time to time. After two years of [[development hell]], Paramount decided to abandon the project in March 1985.

In May 1986, Paramount's rival [[Warner Bros.]] optioned Buchwald's treatment.

In the summer of 1987, Paramount began to develop a movie that was credited as being based on a story by Eddie Murphy, and which was to be directed by John Landis. The story outline was similar to Buchwald's story idea, and to the failed Paramount scripts that had been based on it.

In January 1988, Warner Bros. canceled their version of Buchwald's project, citing the Paramount project.

When the movie ''[[Coming to America]]'' was released by Paramount in 1988, Eddie Murphy was given sole story credit. Buchwald was not paid, or even credited as the story writer. Buchwald sued Paramount for breach of contract, as his contract with Paramount stated that he would be paid a certain amount if his treatment were made into a film.

==Decision==
The California Superior Court decided in 1990 that Buchwald had demonstrated by a [[preponderance of the evidence]] that his story treatment and Paramount's unsuccessful scripts based on the treatment were "similar" to that of the ''Coming to America'' movie. Together with the evidence that Murphy and Landis previously had access to Buchwald's treatment, the court determined that the movie's story was indeed "based upon" Buchwald's treatment. Since Paramount never paid Buchwald, as the option agreement specified would occur if a movie based on his treatment were ever released, Paramount did indeed breach the contract.

In the second phase of the trial in which the court determined the appropriate amount of damages to be paid to Buchwald, Paramount testified that despite the movie's $288 million in ticket sales, it had spent so much money on the movie's development and [[marketing]] that, according to the formula specified in Buchwald's contract, Paramount had made no "net profit". The court then found that the formula was "unconscionable" and that Buchwald therefore could pursue a separate [[tort]] lawsuit against the company.

Fearing a loss on appeal and, presumably, a wave of lawsuits by authors claiming they, too, had been wronged by the unconscionable net profit formula, Paramount settled with Buchwald and his producing partner for $900,000.&lt;ref&gt;(http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-17/local/me-3895_1_net-profit Buchwald, Partner Win $900,000 From Studio)&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the settlement, the "unconscionability" decision was vacated.

==Implications==
{{sources|Sections|date=October 2014}}The accounting formulas used by the studios have allegedly been designed specifically to ensure that it is mathematically impossible for almost any movie to show a net profit. Specifically, the net profit formula in authors' contracts does not correspond to the net profit formula of [[generally accepted accounting principles]] that the movie studios use when creating their [[financial statements]] that are reported to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] and to the investing public. The "unconscionable" formula in the authors' contracts effectively double-count many costs borne by the movie studio.

Some commentators have claimed this lawsuit was a watershed that would affect Hollywood's payments to anyone who enjoyed "profit participation" by forcing a change to the net profit formulas. However, a ruling by the California Superior Court in ''[[Batfilm Productions v. Warner Bros.]]'' regarding the 1989 ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' movie stated that a similar formula was not unconscionable. To date, there has been no review of this type of claim by an appellate court, meaning that the superior courts cannot look to an appellate court's decision for guidance.

Still, the case has caused nearly all studios and production companies to be more careful about how they handle scripts. Concerned that "similarities" between future script drafts and movies could cause lawsuits, nearly all studios and production companies now return unsolicited scripts to their authors unopened.

==Response from John Landis==
In the retrospective interviews included on the 2007 DVD release of ''Coming to America'', John Landis and screenwriters Barry Blaustein and [[David Sheffield]] make no mention of Art Buchwald's lawsuit, and maintain that the film's story originated with Eddie Murphy, with Blaustein and Sheffield writing the screenplay from Murphy's 25-page treatment. In an interview filmed around the time of the film's theatrical release, and included on the DVD, Murphy himself claims that he came up with the idea for the movie whilst on tour.

In Giulia D'Agnolo Vallan's 2008 book ''John Landis'', Landis is quoted as saying that Art Buchwald's case against Paramount was "without merit," going on to state the following:

{{quote|I preface this by saying that I don't know Art Buchwald, and I have nothing against him. I should point out that for all of the media attention to that case, no one ever mentions Barry Blaustein and David Sheffield, the men who actually wrote the script! Every movie I have been involved with that was a big hit had people suing the studio saying it was their idea. We live in a very litigious society. You can sue anybody for anything here.&lt;ref&gt;John Landis, cited in ''John Landis'' by Giulia D'Agnolo Vallan. (2008, M Press), pp.125–126&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Landis also provided the following response as to why Buchwald's lawsuit receive more attention in the press than other similar lawsuits:

{{quote|Well, because it was Art Buchwald! He is an old [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] media darling. The other lawsuits came from less famous people. I remember on ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House|Animal House]]'', there were four or five lawsuits. And Universal just settled them, as that was cheaper than fighting and even prevailing! Art Buchwald is not only East Coast, he's also a newspaperman. The press is going to take his side. The irony of that case is that the only people that his lawsuit benefited were Eddie Murphy and me because it forced Paramount to open their books.&lt;ref&gt;John Landis, cited in ''John Landis'' by Giulia D'Agnolo Vallan. (2008, M Press), p.126&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Blanc de blanc grand Cru champagne.jpg|thumb|A {{ill|blanc de blancs|fr}} Champagne made 100% from [[Chardonnay]]]]

'''Cru''' is "a vineyard or group of vineyards, especially one of recognized quality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cru|title=cru - definition of cru in English - Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[French language|French]] [[wine]] [[Glossary of wine terms|term]] which is traditionally translated as  "growth", as it was originally the past participle of the verb "croître" (to grow). As a wine term it is closely connected to [[terroir]] in the sense of  an "extent of terrain having a certain physical homogeneity . . . considered from the point of view of the nature of the soil as communicating a particular character to its produce, notably to wine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/terroir/substantif|title=TERROIR : Définition de TERROIR|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may thus be defined as: "Terroir as a place of production"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/dmf/cru1?idf=dmfXeXrmXcbgcf;str=0|title=CRU1 : Définition de CRU1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or an "Ensemble of terrains considered from the point of view of what grows there, from  a particular cultivation."&lt;ref name="cnrtl.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/cru|title=CRU : Définition de CRU|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, ''cru'' is often used to indicate a specifically named and legally defined vineyard or ensemble of vineyards and the vines "which grow on [such] a reputed terroir; by extension of good quality."&lt;ref name="cnrtl.fr"/&gt;  The term is also used to refer to the wine produced from such vines. The term ''cru'' is often used within [[classification of wine|classifications]] of [[French wine]]. By implication, a wine that displays (or is allowed to display) the name of its ''cru'' on its [[wine label]] is supposed to exhibit the  typical characteristics of this ''cru''. The terms ''Premier Cru'', ''Grand Cru'', etc.,  are generally translated into English as First Growth, Great Growth, etc.;{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} they designate levels of presumed quality that are variously defined in different wine regions.

==Premier cru==
'''Premier cru''' is a [[French language]] wine term corresponding to "First Growth", and which can be used to refer to classified [[vineyard]]s, [[winery|wineries]] and [[wine]]s, with different meanings in different [[wine region]]s:&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 544"&gt;J. Robinson (ed.). ''The Oxford Companion to Wine'', Third Edition. p. 544. Oxford University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* For [[Bordeaux wine]], the term is applied to classified wineries:
** In the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]], ''Premier cru'' or ''Premier cru classé'' is the highest level of five within the "''Grand cru classé''" designation for red wines from the [[Médoc]] and [[Graves (wine region)|Graves]], and the second-highest of three in [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]] where the highest is ''Premier Cru Supérieur'' (superior first growth). These wines are often referred to as '''[[First Growth]]s''' in English.
** In the [[Classification of Saint-Émilion wine]], the highest level is ''Premier grand cru classé A'' and the second-highest ''Premier grand cru classé B''. The term ''Saint-Émilion Grand cru'' refers to wineries or wines below the overall ''Grand cru classé'' level, and is integrated within the [[AOC (wine)|appellation rules]].
* For [[Burgundy wine]], the term is applied to classified vineyards, with ''Premier cru'' being the second-highest classification level, below that of ''Grand cru'' and above the basic ''village'' AOCs. For Burgundy wines, the terms Premier Cru or 1er Cru are usually kept rather than being translated into English.

==''Grand cru''==
[[File:Grand Cru champagne 2.jpg|thumb|A French Grand Cru Champagne from the village of [[Ambonnay]], a Bernard Brémont {{ill|Millésime|fr}} 2004]]

'''''Grand cru''''' ([[French language|French]] for 'great growth'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/grand-cru "grand cru"] at Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[regional wine classification]] that designates a [[vineyard]] known for its favorable reputation in producing [[wine]]. Although often used to describe grapes, wine or cognac, the term is not technically a classification of wine quality ''per se'', but is intended to indicate the potential of the vineyard or ''[[terroir]]''. It is the highest level of classification of ''[[Appellation d'origine contrôlée]]'' (AOC) wines from [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]] or [[Alsace wine|Alsace]]. The same term is applied to ''Châteaux'' in [[Saint-Émilion AOC|Saint-Émilion]], although in that region it has a different meaning and does not represent the top tier of classification. In Burgundy the level immediately below grand cru is known as premier cru, sometimes written as ''1er cru''.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 321"&gt;J. Robinson (ed.). ''The Oxford Companion to Wine'', Third Edition. p. 321. Oxford University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History in Burgundy===
{{See also|List of Burgundy Grand Crus}}
Early Burgundian wine history is distinctly marked by the work of the [[Cistercians]] with the [[Catholic Church]] being the principal vineyard owner for most of the [[Middle Ages]]. Receiving land and vineyards as [[tithe]]s, [[Financial endowment|endowments]] and as exchanges for [[indulgence]]s the monks were able to studiously observe the quality of wines from individual plots and over time began to isolate those areas that would consistently produce wine of similar aroma, body, color and vigor and designate them as ''crus''.&lt;ref name="Johnson pg 131"&gt;H. Johnson. ''Vintage: The Story of Wine''. p. 131. Simon and Schuster, 1989. {{ISBN|0-671-68702-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]], Jules Lavalle developed an informal classification of vineyards of the [[Côte d'Or (escarpment)|Côte d'Or]] in his book ''History and Statistics of the Côte d'Or''. In 1861, Lavalle's classification was formalized by the Beaune Committee of Agriculture.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 175"&gt;J. Robinson (ed.). ''The Oxford Companion to Wine'', Third Edition. p. 175. Oxford University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The designations of ''grand cru'' and ''premier cru'' were later developed and expanded on in the 1930s with the creation of the AOC system.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 115"&gt;J. Robinson (ed.). ''The Oxford Companion to Wine'', Third Edition. p. 115. [[Oxford University Press]], 2006. {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DPSIR''' (drivers, pressures, state, impact and response model of intervention) is a causal framework for describing the interactions between society and the environment: [[Human impact on the environment]] and vice versa because of the [[interdependence]] of the components.

== Description ==

This framework has been adopted by the [[European Environment Agency]]. The components of this model are:
* '''D'''riving forces: e.g. [[industry]], [[tourism]], [[economic growth]]
* '''P'''ressures: e.g. [[pollution]], [[land-use change]], [[population growth]]
* '''S'''tates : e.g. [[water quality]], [[soil quality]], [[air quality]], [[habitat]], [[vegetation]]
* '''I'''mpacts : e.g. ill [[public health]], [[habitat fragmentation]], [[economic crisis]], [[environmental damage]], [[biodiversity loss]]
* '''R'''esponses : e.g. [[tax]]es, [[environmental law]]s, 

This framework is an extension of the pressure-state-response model developed by [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As a first step, data and information on all the different elements in the DPSIR chain is collected. Then possible connections between these different aspects are postulated. Through the use of the DPSIR modelling framework, it is possible to gauge the effectiveness of responses put into place.

'''Damascus Arabic''' (''llahže ššāmiyye'') is a [[North Levantine Arabic]] spoken dialect, indigenous to and spoken primarily in [[Damascus]]. As the dialect of the capital city of Syria, and due to its use in the Syrian broadcast media, it is prestigious and widely recognized by speakers of other Syrian dialects, and in Lebanon, Palestine, and Jordan. Accordingly, in modern times it is sometimes known as '''Syrian Arabic'''. However, that term may also be used to mean the group of similar urban sedentary dialects of the Levant, or to mean [[Levantine Arabic]] in general.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Versteegh |first1=Kees |title=Encyclopedia of Arabic language and linguistics |publisher=Brill |isbn=9004144730 |pages=v1.492, v1.546, v1.604, v4.403–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowell 205"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Mark W.|last1=Cowell|title=A Reference Grammar of Syrian Arabic (based on the Dialect of Damascus)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dNZ2anC6jmIC&amp;pg=PR17|pages=xv, xvii|publisher=Georgetown University Press|date=2005 |isbn=1589010515|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media ===
DA most influential position is in media, where it is the ''de facto'' official Syrian dialect/accent in the media when [[Modern Standard Arabic|MSA]] is not used and is the most influential dialect in Arabic drama. It has been said that DA is taking the traditional place of Egyptian Arabic there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Uthman |first1=Ahmad |title=Ahmad Maher: Damascus Arabic is a real threat to Egyptian drama |url=https://www.eremnews.com/entertainment/arts-celebrities/935281 |website=www.eremnews.com |accessdate=23 November 2018 |language=ar-AR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most influential Syrian series that is used almost only in DA, [[Bab Al-Hara]], acquired a staggering 50 million view per episode in its peaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Does Syrian star Jihad Abdo turned pizza delivery boy still have a shot at Hollywood fame? |url=https://www.albawaba.com/entertainment/does-syrian-star-jihad-abdo-turned-pizza-delivery-boy-still-have-shot-hollywood-fame-9 |website=www.albawaba.com |accessdate=23 November 2018 |language=en |date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===
It is not common for DA to be written in literature as [[Modern Standard Arabic|MSA]] is usually used in this genre instead. Although it made its way to ''al-turath al-sha'bi'' in several pieces of literature like Siham Turjuman's '''Yā māl al-Shām''', Munīr Kayāl's '''Ḥikāyāt dimašqiyya''' and Institut Francais du Proche-Orient's '''Sirat Al-Malik Al-Zahir Baibars Hsab Al-Riwaya Al-Shamiyya'''.

*The phonemes {{IPA|/p, v, g, q/}} appear mainly in borrowings and loanwords. A rare /tʃ/ has been reported in Turkish loanwords. 
*{{IPA|/p/}} is not generally replaceable by {{IPA|/b/}}, as in ''kɔmpyūtər'' 'computer'; although unaspirated [p] is a frequent allophone of /b/ before voiceless obstruents /f, k, x, ħ, q, s, ʃ, sˤ, t, tˤ/ and at the end of phrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowell |first1=Mark W. |title=A reference grammar of Syrian Arabic with audio CD : (based on the dialect of Damascus) |publisher=Georgetown University Press |isbn=1589010515 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Uvular {{IPA|/q/}} is frequent in borrowings from [[Classical Arabic]] and sometimes alternates freely with {{IPA|/ʔ/}}.
*All of {{IPA|/m, b, l/}} have emphatic marginal-phonemes but a standard method of writing them in the Arabic script does not exist. e.g. Minimal pairs typically exist in ''Mayy'' for (a female name) while /mˤ/ in ''ṃayy'' for (water), /b/ in ''bab[h]a'' (her door) and two /bˤ/ in ''ḅaḅa'' (father, in a childish tone), two /l/ in '' 'all[h]a '' (he told her) and two /lˤ/ in '''aḷḷa[h]'' (Allah).
*While Lentin argues that /r/ contrasts with /rˤ/ as in ''[i]nhār'' (he broke down)  and ''nhāṛ'' (daytime), Cowell denies that an /r/ and /rˤ/ distinction exists in DA.
*DA makes frequent use of doubled (long) consonants and the difference is phonemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowell |first1=Mark W. |title=A reference grammar of Syrian Arabic with audio CD : (based on the dialect of Damascus) |publisher=Georgetown University Press |isbn=1589010515 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. ''katab'' (wrote) and ''kattab'' (made someone write), ''ġani'' (rich) and ''ġanni'' (sing!).

=== Vowels ===
DA typically contains at most eleven different phonemic vowels with six of them (including schwa) being short vowels or at least eight phonemic vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/99474/1/ICPHS0612.pdf|title=Acoustic analysis of the Syrian Arabic vowel system|last1=Almbark|first1=Rana|last2=Hellmuth|first2=Sam|date=|website=University of York|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*No standard method of writing [e], [o], or [ə] exists in the typical Arabic script. Usually, [e] and [i] are considered two ''kasrah'', [u] and [o] are considered as two ''dhammah'', while [ə] is occasionally represented by both diacritics for DA speakers. Similarly, /e:/ and /i:/ are considered ''mad bil-ya''' while /o:/ and /u:/ are considered ''mad bil-waw''.
*The phonemic quality of [e], [o] and [ə] is disputed by some researchers who analyse them as allophones; nevertheless, Lentin analyses every non-final syllable /e, i, u, o/ as /ə/ although this /ə/ has different allophones. 
*Typically, most diphthongs in Classical Arabic are monophthonged in DA with a fixed pattern: *aw= /o:/, *ay=/e:/, *ey &amp; *əy=/i:/, *əw=/u:/; exceptions to this include: *aww and *ayy are preserved (at the end of syllables they change to *aw and *ay though), morphological constraints occasionally prevent monophthongization and diphthongs could occur as loanwords from Classical Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Versteegh |first1=Kees |title=Encyclopedia of Arabic language and linguistics |publisher=Brill |isbn=9004144730 |page=547 v.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7511">{{unsolved|mathematics|Can every simplex be dissected into a bounded number of orthoschemes?}}
In geometry, it is an unsolved [[conjecture]] of [[Hugo Hadwiger]] that every [[simplex]] can be [[Dissection problem|dissected]] into [[Schläfli orthoscheme|orthoscheme]]s, using a number of orthoschemes bounded by a function of the dimension of the simplex.{{r|bkks}} If true, then more generally every [[convex polytope]] could be dissected into orthoschemes.

==Definitions and statement==
In this context, a simplex in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] is the [[convex hull]] of &lt;math&gt;d+1&lt;/math&gt; points that do not all lie in a common [[hyperplane]]. For example, a 2-dimensional simplex is just a [[triangle]] (the convex hull of three points in the plane) and a 3-dimensional simplex is a [[tetrahedron]] (the convex of four points in three-dimensional space). The points that form the simplex in this way are called its [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]].

An orthoscheme, also called a path simplex, is a special kind of simplex. In it, the vertices can be connected by a [[path graph|path]], such that every two edges in the path are at right angles to each other. A two-dimensional orthoscheme is a [[right triangle]]. A three-dimensional orthoscheme can be constructed from a [[cube]] by finding a path of three edges of the cube that do not all lie on the same square face, and forming the convex hull of the four points on this path.

[[File:Triangulated cube.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Dissection of a cube into six orthoschemes]]
A dissection of a shape &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; (which may be any [[closed set]] in Euclidean space) is a representation of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; as a union of other shapes whose [[Interior (topology)|interiors]] are [[disjoint sets|disjoint from each other]]. That is, intuitively, the shapes in the union do not overlap, although they may share points on their boundaries. For instance, a [[cube]] can be dissected into six three-dimensional orthoschemes. A similar result applies more generally: every [[hypercube]] or [[hyperrectangle]] in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensions can be dissected into &lt;math&gt;d!&lt;/math&gt; orthoschemes.

Hadwiger's conjecture is that there is a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that every &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional simplex can be dissected into at most &lt;math&gt;f(d)&lt;/math&gt; orthoschemes. Hadwiger posed this problem in 1956;{{r|hh}} it remains unsolved in general, although special cases for small values of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; are known.{{r|bkks}}

==In small dimensions==
[[File:Altezza.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The altitude from a sharp angle may fail to dissect a triangle, but the altitude from its widest angle always dissects it into two right triangles]]
In two dimensions, every triangle can be dissected into at most two right triangles, by dropping an [[Altitude (triangle)|altitude]] from its widest angle onto its longest edge.{{r|hh}}

In three dimensions, some tetrahedra can be dissected in a similar way, by dropping an altitude perpendicularly from a vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; in an opposite face, connecting &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; perpendicularly to the sides of the face, and using the three-edge perpendicular paths through &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to a side and then to a vertex of the face.{{r|hh}} However, this does not always work. In particular, there exist tetrahedra for which none of the vertices have altitudes with a foot inside the opposite face.
Using a more complicated construction, {{harvtxt|Lenhard|1960}} proved that every tetrahedron can be dissected into at most 12 orthoschemes.{{r|len}}
{{harvtxt|Böhm|1980}} proved that this is optimal: there exist tetrahedra that cannot be dissected into fewer than 12 orthoschemes.{{r|bohm}} In the same paper, Böhm also generalized Lenhard's result to three-dimensional [[spherical geometry]] and three-dimensional [[hyperbolic geometry]].

In four dimensions, at most 500 orthoschemes are needed.{{r|tschirpke93}} In five dimensions, a finite number of orthoschemes is again needed, roughly bounded as at most 12.5 million. Again, this applies to spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry as well as to Euclidean geometry.{{r|tschirpke94}}

Hadwiger's conjecture remains unproven for all dimensions greater than five.{{r|bkks}}

==Consequences==
Every [[convex polytope]] may be dissected into simplexes. Therefore, if Hadwiger's conjecture is true, every convex polytope would also have a dissection into orthoschemes.{{r|tschirpke94}}

A related result is that every orthoscheme can itself be dissected into &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;d+1&lt;/math&gt; smaller orthoschemes.{{r|debrunner|bkk}} Therefore, for simplexes that can be partitioned into orthoschemes, their dissections can have arbitrarily large numbers of orthoschemes.

A typical doorbuster deal is an item or selection of items which is given a special [[Discounts and allowances|discount]] price for a limited amount of time. This offer is referred to as a doorbuster in reference to literal incidents in which doors were broken down by a flood of people struggling to get the goods before they sold out. Doorbuster deals are usually employed on major shopping days, such as [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] and [[Boxing Day]].

An unfair practice of "doorbusting" consists in advertising great deals on products despite possessing a low quantity in stock ("while quantities last" as it may be advertised in small prints) in order to lure customers in the store to buy other regular-priced products when the discounted one run out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/11/20/news/economy/black_friday_doorbuster_secrets/|title=Dirty secrets of Black Friday 'doorbusters'|website=Money.cnn.com|date=20 November 2009|author=Parija B. Kavilanz|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, a crowd of 2,000 waiting for the 5 am opening of a doorbuster event at a [[Walmart]] in New York broke the sliding-glass doors out of impatience and the following stampede of the crowd rushing in the store fatally injured a store employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/29/business/29walmart.html|title=Wal-Mart Employee Trampled to Death|website=Nytimes.com|date=28 November 2008|author=Robert McFadden|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doteli''', or '''Dotyali''' (डोटेली) is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] spoken by about 800,000 people, most of whom live in [[Nepal]]. It was traditionally considered the western dialect of [[Nepali language|Nepali]], and is written in the [[Devanagari]] script. It has official status in Nepal as per Part 1, Section 6 of [[Constitution of Nepal]] 2072 (2015).&lt;ref name="NepalConstitution"/&gt;
There are four main dialects of Doteli, namely Baitadeli, Bajhangi Nepali, Darchuli and Doteli. The [[mutual intelligibility]] between these dialects is high and all dialects of Doteli are able to share language-based materials.

An '''expansion team''' is a new team in a sports league, usually from a city that has not hosted a team in that league before, formed with the intention of satisfying the demand for a local team from a population in a new area. Sporting leagues also hope that the expansion of their competition will grow the popularity of the sport generally. The term is most commonly used in reference to the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|North American major professional sports leagues]] but is applied to sports leagues in other countries with [[Professional sports league organization#Structure of North American leagues|a closed franchise system]] of league membership. The term comes from the expansion of the sport into new areas. That sometimes results in the payment of an expansion fee to the league by the new team and an [[expansion draft]] to populate the new roster.

{{TOC right}}

==Reasons for expansion==
In North America, expansion often takes place in response to [[population growth]] and geographic shifts of population. Such demographic change results in financial opportunities to engage with the new market as consumers of sports demand local teams to support. [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) was limited to 16 teams located north and east of [[St. Louis, Missouri]] for the first half of the 20th century. During that time, the United States population doubled and expanded to the south and west. Rival interests explored the possibility of forming a [[Continental League|rival league]] in the untapped markets. To forestall that possibility, one of the measures that MLB took was to expand by four teams in 1961 and 1962. Over the past four decades, MLB expanded further, to its current 30-team membership. In the context of MLB, the term "expansion team" is also used to refer to any of the 14 teams enfranchised in the second half of the 20th century.

Leagues that are new and/or financially struggling may also admit large numbers of expansion teams so that the existing franchises can pocket more revenue from expansion fees. [[Indoor American football]] leagues are notorious for doing so: the leagues can double the number of teams and have many new teams fail within a year or two. [[Major League Soccer]], after spending most of its first decade of existence with relatively stable membership and struggling finances, adopted a policy of continuous expansion beginning in 2005, a policy that the league as of 2017 has no intention of stopping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/04/14/commissioner-garber-next-round-mls-expansion-likely-happening-2020|title=Commissioner Garber: Next round of MLS expansion "likely happening in 2020"|website=mlssoccer.com |date=April 14, 2016 |accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an expansion team begins play, it is generally stocked with less talented [[free agent]]s, inexperienced players, and veterans nearing retirement. Additionally, prospective owners may face expensive fees to the league as well as high startup costs such as stadiums and facilities, and the team is also at a disadvantage in that it has not been together as a team as long as its opponents and thus lacks the cohesiveness other teams have built over years. As a result, most expansion teams are known for their poor play during their first few seasons, which can be exacerbated by the fact that leagues sometimes expand by two or four teams in one season for scheduling reasons, such as eliminating the possibility of a team being without an opponent on a preferred date by an odd number of teams. In those cases, expansion teams must compete with their expansion rivals for available talent. Expansion teams are not usually doomed to mediocrity forever, as most leagues have policies which promote parity, such as drafts and salary caps, which give some expansion teams the opportunity to win championships only a few years after their first season. The [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] won the [[2001 World Series]] in only their fourth season. The [[Milwaukee Bucks]] won the [[1971 NBA Finals]] in only their third year of existence, greatly helped by drafting [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] in the [[1969 NBA Draft|1969 draft]] and acquiring [[Oscar Robertson]] from the [[Sacramento Kings|Cincinnati Royals]] before the [[1970-71 NBA season|1970-71 season]] began. The [[Chicago Fire SC|Chicago Fire]] won [[MLS Cup '98|MLS Cup]] in 1998 in just their first year of existence in [[Major League Soccer]]. In 2011, the [[Portland Timbers]] started their MLS franchise, and they won the MLS Cup in 2015. The [[Florida Panthers]] made the Stanley Cup Finals in only [[1996 Stanley Cup Finals|their 3rd season]] in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) even though, like MLB, the league then had no salary cap. The NHL's [[Vegas Golden Knights]] quickly emerged as one of the NHL's best teams in its first season, thanks to a generous expansion draft, eventually advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals. The [[National Football League]], despite being considered the most generous in its revenue sharing and the strictest with its salary cap, has had far more difficulty bringing expansion teams up to par with their more established brethren: since the [[AFL–NFL merger]], the soonest that any of the six expansion teams that have been added after the merger would win a [[Super Bowl]] was 27 seasons (the time it took for the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] after the team's 1976 establishment to win [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] in early 2003); none of the four that have been added since 1995 have ever won that contest, with only one, the [[Carolina Panthers]] (who reached the game eight years after their founding, and again 12 years later) even playing in the NFL's championship game. The transplantation of the [[Cleveland Browns]]' roster to Baltimore and its restocking via expansion has so far crippled the franchise, with it ranking among the worst in league history since the expansion and only appearing in the NFL playoffs once, having yet to win a playoff game since then.

Most teams are considered as an expansion team usually in their first season and sometimes in their second season, but especially for purists, Major League Baseball teams can be considered "expansion teams" indefinitely. A team that moves to another location and/or changes its name is not an expansion team. If it moves, it is known as a ''relocated team'', and if the name changes, the team is known as a ''renamed team''. In response to a negative attitude that some fans have towards relocated teams,{{according to whom|date=January 2015}} there have recently been instances where relocating clubs change their identity completely; name, colors and mascot; but because the roster is the same and the league does not expand as a result, they are not regarded as expansion teams. One exception is the [[Baltimore Ravens]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL): when the [[Cleveland Browns]] moved to Baltimore, an agreement was reached for which the trademark and history of the pre-1996 Cleveland Browns remained in that city and was claimed by the post-1999 Browns when the league placed a new franchise there, even though the personnel and roster had moved to Baltimore to become the Ravens.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}Another exception is the [[New Orleans Pelicans]], who were previously known as the New Orleans Hornets after relocating to New Orleans from Charlotte, N.C., in 2002. After the 2012 sale of the Hornets, new owner [[Tom Benson]] changed the name, colors and mascot from Hornets to Pelicans. The Charlotte Hornets segment of the franchise's history was sold to the then-[[Charlotte Hornets|Charlotte Bobcats]] (themselves formerly considered a 2004 expansion team) and the 2002 New Orleans Hornets are now officially regarded as an expansion team.

Cities and regions with large populations that lack a team are generally regarded to be the best candidates for new teams. The [[Super League|European Super League]] in [[rugby league]] has added teams from [[France]] and [[Wales]] to cover a great demographic spread. The operator of Super League, England's [[Rugby Football League]], has also added teams to the lower levels of its league pyramid, specifically the [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]] and [[League 1 (rugby league)|League 1]], from both France and Wales, and most recently [[Canada]]. In [[rugby union]], the competition originally known as the Celtic League and now as [[Pro14]], which began with sides only from the [[Celtic nations]] of [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and Wales, has added teams from [[Italy]] and more recently [[South Africa]]. The U.S.-based NFL has been laying groundwork for a potential [[Potential London NFL franchise|franchise in the UK]], tentatively slated to launch in 2022.

'''Giwi Margwelaschwili''' ({{lang-ka|გივი მარგველაშვილი}}) (born December 14, 1927 in [[Berlin]]) is a [[German-language]] [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] writer and philosopher.

He is the son of the notable Georgian intellectual [[Tite Margwelaschwili]], who moved to [[Germany]] after the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia]] in 1921 and was chairman of the Georgian political emigre organization in Berlin. Due to allied [[bombing]] he attended three different [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] schools in Berlin and participated in the [[Anti-fascism|anti-Fascist]] youth movement ''[[Swing Kids]]''.

After the war the family lived in [[Wilmersdorf|Berlin-Wilmersdorf]] in the [[United Kingdom|British]] sector of Berlin. In December 1945 Giwi and his father were abducted by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] secret police [[NKVD]] and confined in the cellar of a Soviet commandantura in [[Berlin-Weissensee]] for six weeks. Subsequently he was detained in a Soviet [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Special Camp at Sachsenhausen]]. While his father was deported to [[Tbilisi]] and shot as a traitor after eight months of interrogation and torture, Giwi was released after 18 months in the camp. He was not allowed to return to [[West Berlin]] and moved to his relatives in Tbilisi.

Margwelaschwili learned Georgian and Russian, and graduated from high school. He studied English at the [[Tbilisi State University]] and was an aspirant for foreign languages. 1957-1970 he taught English and German at the [[Ilia Chavchavadze State University|Tbilisi Institute of Foreign Languages]]. In the 1950s, he composed his first novels and philosophic writings on [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]] (2002), ''Phenomenology World Wide: Foundations - Expanding Dynamics - Life-Engagements: A Guide for Research and Study'', pp. 310-2. Springer, {{ISBN|1-4020-0066-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, he was allowed to travel to [[East Germany]] as a translator for the [[Rustaveli Theatre]] for the first time since 22 years. In 1970 his first scientific work about "The role of the language in Heidegger's philosophy" was published. In 1971 he was appointed to the Institute of Philosophy at the [[Georgian Academy of Sciences]] and visited [[dissident]] and [[songwriter]] [[Wolf Biermann]] in Berlin. Due to that contact he was prohibited to leave the Soviet Union until 1987. In 1972 Giwi met [[Heinrich Böll]], a [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate in literature]] from Germany, who was impressed by his unpublished autobiography ''Kapitän Wakusch''. Böll tried to help him get a passport but was not successful.

In 1990 he settled in Berlin with the help of civil rights activist Ekkehard Maaß and was naturalized as a German citizen in 1994. In 1991 his first autobiographic work, ''Muzal. Ein georgischer Roman'', was published in Germany. Several books followed, including novels, philosophic commentaries on [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] authors, and poems, which quickly won a nationwide and international acclaim. Nevertheless, most of his work remained unpublished.

In 1995 he was awarded the ''Literature Prize of [[Brandenburg]] federal state''. He became a member of the [[International PEN]] and received a [[scholarship]] of the [[President of Germany]]. The [[University of Bamberg]] appointed him professor for poetry. The [[Academy of Arts, Berlin]] decorated him with the ''[[Kunstpreis Berlin]]'' for his life's work. In 2006, the [[Goethe Institute]] awarded the prestigious [[Goethe Medal]] to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literaturfestival.com/bios1_3_6_460.html Giwi Margwelaschwili]. International Literature Festival, Berlin. Retrieved on April 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He has an honorary doctorate from Tbilisi State University.

He is married to the author and [[German studies|German philologist]] [[Naira Gelashvili]]. His daughter Anna is also a German philologist.

'''''Glottolog''''' is a [[bibliographic database]] of the world's lesser-known languages, developed and maintained first at the former [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany, and since 2015 at the [[Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History]] in [[Jena]], Germany.

Glottolog provides a catalogue of the world's languages and language families and a bibliography on the world's less-spoken languages. It differs from the similar catalogue ''[[Ethnologue]]'' in several respects: it attempts to only accept languages which the editors have been able to confirm both exist and are distinct (varieties which have not been confirmed, but are inherited from another source, are tagged as "[[Spurious languages|spurious]]" or "[[Unattested language|unattested]]");&lt;ref&gt;See for example the {{glottolink|book1242|bookkeeping}} section for ISO languages that ''Glottolog'' has deemed to be spurious distinctions.&lt;br /&gt;This discrimination does not apply to dialects, many of which have been inherited from [[MultiTree]] or other sources without verification.&lt;/ref&gt; it attempts only to classify languages into families which have been demonstrated to be valid; bibliographic information is provided, especially for lesser-known languages; and, to a limited extent, alternative names are listed according to the sources which use them. The language names used in the bibliographic entries are identified by [[ISO 639-3]] code or Glottolog's own code (Glottocode); apart from a single point-location on a map at its geographic centre, no ethnographic or demographic information is provided. External links are provided to ISO, ''Ethnologue'' and other online language databases.

__FORCETOC__

==Language families==
''Glottolog'' is more conservative in its classification than most online databases in establishing membership of languages and groups within families but more liberal in considering unclassified languages to be [[Language isolate|isolates]]. Edition 2.4 lists 425 [[Spoken language|oral-language]] families, including isolates, and 75 [[Sign language|sign-language]] families and isolates,&lt;ref&gt;Sign languages are listed together, including those grouped typologically as [[village sign language]]s, as are pidgins and unclassified languages, but without a claim that they are necessarily related.&lt;/ref&gt; as follows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15480">'''Grassroots lobbying''' (also indirect lobbying) is lobbying  with the intention of reaching the [[legislature]] and making a difference in the decision-making process. [[Grassroots]] [[lobbying]] is an approach that separates itself from [[direct lobbying]] through the act of asking the ''general public'' to contact legislators and government officials concerning the issue at hand, as opposed to conveying the message to the legislators directly. &lt;!-- The goal is to influence legislation through the general public. redundant--&gt; Companies, associations and citizens are increasingly partaking in grassroots lobbying as an attempt to influence a change in legislation.&lt;ref name="Pluralism and Democracy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Graziano|first=Luigi|title=Lobbying, Pluralism and Democracy|year=2001|publisher=palgrave|isbn=0-333-92056-2|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique characteristic of grassroots lobbying, in contrast to other forms of lobbying, is that it involves stimulating the politics of specific communities. This type of lobbying is different from the more commonly known [[direct lobbying]], as it is naturally brought upon by the organization&lt;!-- , unlike the structural lobbying seen elsewhere "structural or direct?" when in doubt, leave it out--&gt;.

== Tactics ==
There are several tactics used by groups in order to promote or [[advocate]] different issues politically, but the main two tactics used in grassroots or "outside" advocacy are education of constituents through holding [[press conferences]] or organizing [[press releases]], and mobilizing targeted people who will be impacted negatively or positively  &lt;!-- do you mean general public ? --&gt; to create a ''movement''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baumgartner|first=Frank|title=Lobbying and Policy Change: Who wins, Who loses, and Why|year=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-0-226-03945-9|pages=151–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media Lobbying ===
Grassroots lobbying often implement the use of media to expand their outreach. Campaigns are developed and are published in all forms of media ranging from television to magazines and internet. Because grassroots lobbying is geared toward local organizations and communities, these types of media outlets are used mainly by large associations that can afford them. Smaller organizations tend to use free media on public television, radio and other smaller outlets. Other forms of free media that make a large impact are things like boycotting, protesting and demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hrebenar|first=Ronald J.|last2=Morgan|first2=Bryson B.|title=Lobbying In America|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=978-1598841121|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social Media ====
The trend of the past decade has been the use of social media outlets to reach people across the globe. Social media are by nature grassroots organizers. They provide a way for communities, not only to interact, but to form around topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Kyle|title=Top Down and Bottom Up: Integrating Grassroots and Social Media Efforts|url=http://doteduguru.com/id1148-integrating-grassroots-social-media-efforts.html|accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementing social media tactics in grassroots lobbying would provide a much broader outreach and would allow activists to not only inform but interact with various people about their cause.

Some advocates are now are using social media to reduce the cost of traditional campaigns, and to more precisely target public officials with political messages.&lt;ref&gt;http://fortune.com/2016/07/13/government-lobbyists-social-media/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass movements===
By mobilizing the group that the lobby has built, this puts pressure on the legislature to listen and take notice of what concerns they may have. These tactics are used after the lobbying group gains a portion of the publics trust and support through speaking out in crowded areas, passing out flyers and even campaigning through web and television outlets. More recently, due to the potential of other modern communication devices, grassroots lobbying is expected to only increase as a form of shaping public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=George|title=The Tax Treatment of Business Grassroots Lobbying: Defining and Attaining the Public Policy Objectives|journal=Columbia Law Review|date=May 1968|volume=68|issue=5|pages=801–859|jstor=1121034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tea Party ====
Several grassroots lobbying groups have become popular over time, due to their prominent stances and eye catching tactics to get the publics attention. Most recently in the United States, the [[Tea Party Movement]] of 2011 wished to limit government spending. Most of the movements started by the group have to do with less government, tax cutting; something they believe will bring the United States back to what it used to stand for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Page|first=Susan|title=What is the Tea Party? A growing state of mind|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2010-07-01-tea-party_N.htm|accessdate=28 April 2011|newspaper=USA Today|date=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Tea Party sees themselves as a "movement that calls awareness to any issue that challenges the security, sovereignty, or domestic tranquility of our beloved nation, the United States of America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.teaparty.org/about.php|publisher=TeaParty.org|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the Tea Party's successful tactics in grassroots, they get their point across and potentially sway the general public on a very large scale.   Now, somewhat indirectly (as is the intention of grassroots lobbying), the Tea Party holds a great deal of influence over legislation.  This has gone as far as penetrating Congress with candidates personally supported by the Tea Party Movement, therefore giving them a direct outlet for their ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zernike|first=Kate|title=Tea Party Set to Win Enough Race for Wide Influences|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/us/politics/15teaparty.html|accessdate=28 April 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Large company campaigns ===
Large companies take advantage &lt;!-- or do they employ? --&gt;of grassroots lobbying as a means of impacting change in [[legislation]]. There are certain steps that need to be implemented before the outcome of the lobbying can take place.
* The first step is a 'legislative action program'. This is the role of the management to make the action important in the eyes of the rest of the organization. Not only must they identify specific legislation concerns to the rest of the company, the lobbyists must also perform a type of study identifying the sectors of the public that are being affected.
* The second step is to sensitize the members of the organization to writing, calling or visiting officials and the Member of Congress as soon as an 'alert' is given. This will bring about internal communication with levels of authority.
* Finally, the third step is media planning. There must be use of advertising, posting articles, commercials and TV programming that feature people impacted by the specific cause. These will be geared to those representatives of a Congressional district.&lt;ref name="Pluralism and Democracy" /&gt;

== Trends ==
Trends from the past decade in grassroots lobbying have been the increase in aggressive recruiting of volunteers and starting campaigns early on, way before the legislature must make a decision.  Also, with increasing technology and modern communication techniques, lobbying groups have been able to create interactive web pages to email, recruit volunteers, assign them to tasks and keep the goal of the lobbying group on the right track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonner|first=Jack|author2=Edward Grefe |author3=Richard Minard |title=Trends in Grassroots Lobbying: Consultant Q &amp; A|journal=Campaigns and Elections|date=1 February 1999|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-38176470.html|accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the added devices of today such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], Grassroots lobbyists have an even easier, cheaper, and faster way to reach the masses and develop a strong base for their issues to be heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ward|first=Scott|title=Growing the Grassroots at the State Level|url=http://www.apta.org/Blogs/MovingForward/2011/2/25/|publisher=American Physical Therapy Association|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hot topics for lobbyists ==
&lt;!-- not sure what is meant by title ...  are you still talking about trends--&gt;
The major concerns of the general public do not reflect those of the lobbying groups.  This is why the lobbying groups feel that they must use the aforementioned tactics to sway the public a certain way on an issue that they may never knew existed. To the general public, [[crime]] is the number one problem in nation, followed by the state of the [[economy]] and [[international relations|international affairs]].  However, the main concern for lobbying groups in the past has been on health concerns.  A study done in 2009 shows that over 20 percent of lobbying groups put health concerns such as [[disease prevention]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], or [[prescription drugs]] as a top priority.  This interest in health is followed closely by environmental concerns as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baumgartner|first=Frank|title=Lobbying and Policy Change: Who Wins, Who Loses, and Why|year=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-0-226-03945-9|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Although Grassroots lobbying has changed the stage of such advocacy, it is still concerning the same issues as other more traditional or direct lobbying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barmgartner|first=Frank|author2=Beth Leech|title=Interest Niches and Policy Bandwagons: Patterns of Interest Group Involvement in National Politics|journal=The Journal of Politics|year=2001|pages=1193–1195|url=http://www.unc.edu/~fbaum/teaching/PLSC083_Fall_2008/JOP_2001_Issue_Niches.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulations ==
Lobbying and the stimulation of '''grassroots lobbying''', is protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights of speech, association, and petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maskell|first=Jack|title=Grassroots Lobbying: Constitutionality of Disclosure Requirement|url=http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL33794_20080226.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Federal law does not mandate grassroots lobbying disclosure, yet, 36 states regulate grassroots lobbying. 22 states define lobbying as direct or indirect communication to public officials, and 14 additional states define lobbying as any attempt to influence public officials.&lt;ref name="Milyo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Milyo|first=Jeffrey|title=Mowing Down the Grassroots|url=http://ij.org/images/pdf_folder/washington/mowing_down_the-grassroots.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A group or individual classified as a lobbyist must submit regular disclosure reports. Reports accurately disclose activities and all financial support, however, reporting requirements vary from state to state. Some states disclosures are minimal and require only registration, while some states disclosure requirements are extensive, including but not limited to: filing of monthly to quarterly expense reports, including all legislative activity relevant to the individual or groups activities, amounts of contributions and donations, as well as the names and addresses of contributors and specified expenses.&lt;ref name="Milyo"/&gt;
The grassroots lobbying disclosure law in Washington requires that any person or group that spends more than $500 per month or $1000 in three months from grassroots lobbying expenditures is required to file with the states [[Washington State Public Disclosure Commission|Public Disclosure Commission]] and disclose his or hers name/ groups name, business, occupation, and address. Also the names and addresses of anyone or any group the grassroots lobbyists are working with, as well as anyone who contributes more than $25 towards lobbying efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grassroots Lobbying Disclosure Laws and the First Amendment|url=http://www.ombwatch.org/node/10934|publisher=OMB Watch|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part-time employment or expenses of $500 per month on communications efforts is a common onset for disclosure reports, varying from states. Penalties range from civil fines to criminal penalties if regulations are not complied.&lt;ref name="Milyo"/&gt;

=== IRS ===
Grassroots lobbying is classified under [[Schedule C]] ([[form 990]] or 990-EZ), [[Political Campaign]] and Lobbying Activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Instructions for 990 or 990-EZ|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i990sc.pdf|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schedule C is used by [[Section 501 (c)]] and [[527 organization|Section 527]] organizations.&lt;ref name="Instructions for Schedule C"&gt;{{cite web|title=Instructions for Schedule C|url=https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i990sc/ch01.html|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations are  required to use Schedule C to provide additional information on political campaign activities and lobbying activities.&lt;ref name="Instructions for Schedule C"/&gt;

==Astroturfing==
A common misconception about the grassroots style lobbying is that it goes hand in hand with what is known as Astroturf lobbying or [[Astroturfing]]. Astroturf-style activism has been deemed by many as "artificial", being because it uses techniques different from the original grassroots style of over-all citizen participation. Unlike genuine grassroots activism which tends to be money-poor but people-rich, astroturf campaigns are typically people-poor but cash-rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Astroturf|url=http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Astroturf|accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lobbyists in charge of this type of activism usually come from non-governmental organizations and political public relations firms. Inside these Astroturf organizations are workers hired to rally up people to support a particular cause and instruct them on how to take political action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson Truett|first=Walter|title=Astroturf -- The Big Business of Fake Grassroots Politics|url=http://www.pacificnews.org/jinn/stories/2.01/960105-astroturf.html|accessdate=30 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129034915/http://www.pacificnews.org/jinn/stories/2.01/960105-astroturf.html|archivedate=29 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many times grassroots organizations have felt interference by these organizations when their efforts are reorganized with an Astroturf –Lobbying approach. Although many don't agree with this form of activism because it somewhat dismisses the general public's involvement, Astroturf lobbying groups defend their position, saying that monitoring the collection of peoples voices would infringe on First Amendment rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Daniel|title=The Browning of Grassroots|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2009/08/19/the-browning-of-grassroots.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sameera Reddy From The Sameera Reddy at Auto Expo (6).jpg|thumb|upright|Actress [[Sameera Reddy]] wearing black high-waisted trousers.]]
A '''high-rise''' or '''high-waisted''' [[garment]] is one designed to sit high on, or above, the wearer's [[hips]], usually at least 8 centimetres (3&amp;nbsp;inches) higher than the [[navel]]. In western cultures, high-rise jeans were especially common in the 1970s, in competition with [[low-rise pants]].

==Modern fashion==
In western culture, high-waisted pants tend to have long zippers, ranging from about 7-10 inches long, and leave the navel either completely covered or barely shown. Zipper lengths are not to be confused with rises. High-waisted pants have rises typically 10 inches long or longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primermagazine.com/2013/spend/pants-rise-explained-and-why-low-rise-isnt-always-your-best-choice |title=Pants Rise Explained (and Why Low Rise Isn’t Always Your Best Choice) |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In European menswear, pants sat level with the navel until the 1950s, and were held up by a pair of [[suspenders]]. During the 1940s, [[Zoot suit]]ers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083365/ Zoot suit]&lt;/ref&gt; wore pants with a waistband so high that they often reached the chest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://invention.smithsonian.org/centerpieces/whole_cloth/u7sf/u7materials/cosgrove.html Zoot suits and style warfare] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813123335/http://invention.smithsonian.org/centerpieces/whole_cloth/u7sf/u7materials/cosgrove.html |date=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s to 1990s===
Low-waisted [[drainpipe jeans]] and [[flared trousers]] were a counterculture statement among the [[Mod (subculture)|Mod]]s and [[hippies]] of the late 1960s and early 1970s, in contrast to the higher waisted [[Levi Strauss]] jeans teenagers had worn previously. During the late 1970s, however, there was a [[disco backlash|backlash]] against disco and hippie fashions, and members of [[Generation X]] opted for higher rise pants. These straight leg [[acid wash]] jeans remained popular throughout the 1980s and 1990s, until [[hip hop fashion]] went mainstream and it became [[1990s fashion|fashionable]] for teenagers to [[Sagging (fashion)|sag]] their [[baggy pants]].&lt;ref&gt;Keyes, Cheryl (2004). Rap Music and Street Consciousness (Music in American Life). University of Illinois Press. p. 152. {{ISBN|978-0-252-07201-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival===
During the mid and late-2010s, high waisted pants underwent a revival among younger women, in reaction to the low-rise [[skinny jeans]] that were popular during the previous decade. Female celebrities who were seen in high-rise clothing included [[Lady Gaga]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2591158/Heavy-Metal-Lover-Lady-Gaga-goes-Eighties-ripped-high-waisted-acid-wash-jeans-sweet-rock-roll-tribute-T-shirt-father-Joe.html Lady gaga]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rihanna]], [[Pixie Lott]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2738189/Pixie-Lott-shows-seriously-toned-stomach-striped-crop-high-waisted-jeans.html Pixie Lott] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140901200742/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2738189/Pixie-Lott-shows-seriously-toned-stomach-striped-crop-high-waisted-jeans.html |date=2014-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kim Kardashian]], and [[Selena Gomez]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2609830/Selena-Gomez-puts-stylish-spin-high-waist-jeans-crop-1-500-Emilio-Pucci-bag-coffee-run.html Selena gomez]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2000s and 2010s, male celebrities who wore high-rise jeans, including President [[Barack Obama]], [[Simon Cowell]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/its-not-simon-cowells-age-3193797 Simon Cowell jeans]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]] presenter [[Jeremy Clarkson]], were ridiculed by the press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/03/14/obama-wants-people-to-quit-bashing-his-jeans/ Obama jeans]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1218753/Why-OK-look-like-Jeremy-Clarkson-17-reassuring-winter-style-tips.html Jeremy Clarkson look]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian culture==
In ancient India, some Indian philosophers opposed [[sari]]s that expose the [[midriff]]. They considered it to be a symbol of adultery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eFoOAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=midriff#search_anchor Sarvajna: the omniscient poet of Karnataka - Basavaraj Naikar].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dharmasastra]] writers stated that women should be dressed such that the navel would not become visible.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NH1qr33kfXAC Encyclopedia of Indian Women Through the Ages: Ancient India – Simmi Jain].&lt;/ref&gt; Still today, some corporate offices in India have strict [[dress code]]s for women, requiring high-rise saris to be worn to avoid navel exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr Saurabh Bhatia |title=Indian Corporate Etiquette |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bmnto6wQ-8cC |accessdate=11 June 2011 |publisher=Saurabh Bhatia |isbn=9788190696401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hindi Divas''' ({{Lang|hi|हिन्दी दिवस}}; {{lit| Hindi day}}) is an annual day celebrated on 10 January in [[India]] to celebrate the popularity of [[Hindi]] as an official language of India. Mostly this celebration is a government sponsored event in [[Central government of India|Central government]], but many private organizations and voluntary groups also celebrate the day.

== History ==
[[File:Beohar Rajendra Simha 1964.jpg|thumb|Beohar Rajendra Simha, the acclaimed Hindi-stalwart. On his 50th birthday (14-09-1949), Hindi was adopted as the Official Language of Republic of India, celebrating it as "Hindi-Day" since then.]]
'''Hindi Divas''' is celebrated on 10 January because on this day in 1949, the [[Constituent Assembly of India]] had adopted Hindi written in [[Devanagari]] script as the [[Official languages of Union govt of India|official language of the Republic of India]]. But this didn't come as easily as it sounds. To this end, several stalwarts rallied and lobbied pan-India in favor of Hindi, most notable person 
Beohar Rajendra Simha along with [[Hazari Prasad Dwivedi]], [[Kaka Kalelkar]], [[Maithili Sharan Gupt]] and [[Seth Govind Das]] who even debated in Parliament on this issue. As such, on the 50th birthday of Beohar Rajendra Simha on 14 September 1949, the efforts came to fruition following adoption of Hindi as the official language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.patrika.com/news/jabalpur/know-hindi-had-the-status-of-national-language-1398330|title=हिन्दी दिवस विशेष: इनके प्रयास से मिला था हिन्दी को राजभाषा का दर्जा|last=|first=|date=|work=[[patrika.com]]|access-date=2018-11-01|language=hi-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was ratified by the Constitution of India that came into effect on 26 January 1950. Under the Article 343 of the Indian Constitution, Hindi written in [[Devanagari]] script was adopted as the official language. In all, there are 22 [[Scheduled languages of India]], of which, two are officially used at [[Union government of India]] level: Hindi and English.
Hindi is spoken by 250 million people as the original language and it is the fourth language of the world.

== Notable events ==
Apart from local-level events in schools and other institutions, a few of the notable events include
* The former President of India, [[Pranab Mukherjee]] had conferred awards in different categories for the excellence in different fields pertaining to Hindi at a function in Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi.
* Rajbhasha Awards were conferred upon the Ministries, Departments, PSUs and Nationalised Banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = India observed Hindi Divas on 10 January | url = http://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/india-observed-hindi-divas-on-14-september-1410778557-1 
|work=Jagran Josh|date=15 Sep 2014| accessdate = 2014-09-16  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] in its order dated 25 March 2015 has changed name of two awards given annually on Hindi Divas. 'Indira Gandhi Rajbhasha Puraskar' instituted in 1986 changed to 'Rajbhasha Kirti Puraskar'  and 'Rajiv Gandhi Rashtriya Gyan-Vigyan Maulik Pustak Lekhan Puraskar' changed to "Rajbhasha Gaurav Puraskar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Names of Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi knocked off Hindi Diwas awards|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/names-of-indira-gandhi-rajiv-gandhi-knocked-off-hindi-diwas-awards/articleshow/46994365.cms|accessdate=21 April 2015|publisher=The Economic Times|date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IsiNgqumo is a [[Nguni languages|Nguni language]] and seems to have derived from [[Zulu language|Zulu]]. IsiNgqumo is often considered a Western invention by indigenous Zimbabweans but it was actually a creation of indigenous homosexuals, an only recently self-aware group.&lt;ref name=Epprecht/&gt;

==Sample==
Although the following sample conversation may be slightly obscene, it is a good representative of IsiNgqumo's use as most of its vocabulary has some connection to sex or gay men.&lt;ref name=CameronGevisser&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Edwin|author1-link=Edwin Cameron|last2=Gevisser|first2=Mark|author2-link=Mark Gevisser|title=Defiant Desire: Gay and Lesbian Lives in South Africa|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136656026|page=183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8RzeAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IsiNgqumo:
:"''Isiphukwana sake, kuyavuswa na?''"
:"''Maye''"
:"''Injini!''"
:"''Kuncishiwe''" (or) "''kuyapholwa''"

Zulu translation (to show difference):
:"''Ubolo sake, kuyakhulu na?''"
:"''Yebo''"
:"''Imbuqo!''"
:"''Kuyancane''"

English ([[literal translation]]):
:"His little stick, has it awoken?"
:"Yes"
:"Lie!"
:"It's not talented" (or) "it makes one cold"

English translation:
:"His penis, is it big?"
:"Yes"
:"Lie!"
:"It's small" (both terms mean the same thing, and are very derogatory{{why|date=December 2015}})

===Etymology===
The origin of the vocabulary used in the above sample is given below:&lt;ref name=CameronGevisser/&gt;
*The word ''isiphukwana'' comes from the Zulu word ''uphuku'' (meaning "stick") with the suffix "-ana" (meaning "small"). ''Iisiphukwana'' is the IsiNgqumo variant of the Zulu word ''uphukwana''.
*''Vuswa'' is the Zulu word for "woken up" in the passive tense.
*''Maye'' comes from the Zulu word for expressing shock. This is used instead of the Zulu word for yes, ''yebo''.
*''Injini'' literally means "taking on for a ride", and finds its origins in the Zulu word for "engine". In Zulu, the word ''imbuqo'' word is used for the same purpose.
*The word ''uncishiwe'' originates from Zulu as "not given", but is used in IsiNgqumo to mean "not talented". ''Kuncishiwe'' has the same meaning as "It is not talented". ''Uncishiwe'' can also mean "ugly", or can be used as a generic insult.
*''Pholwa'' is passive tense for the Zulu word for "cool". ''Kuyapholwa'' could be translated as "it makes one cool". Like ''ncishiwe'', ''pholwa'' can be used as an insult.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3523">'''John W. Etchemendy''' (born 1952 in [[Reno, Nevada]]) was [[Stanford University]]'s twelfth  [[Provost (education)|Provost]]. He succeeded [[John L. Hennessy]] to the post on September 1, 2000 and stepped down on January 31, 2017.  
[[File:Stanford2010HennessyAndRiceAndEtchemendy.png|thumb|''Left to right:'' [[John L. Hennessy]], [[Susan Rice]], and '''John Etchemendy''', June 2010]] 
[[File:Stanford2010JohnEtchemendy.png|thumb|John Etchemendy]]
John Etchemendy received his bachelor's and master's degrees at the [[University of Nevada, Reno]] before earning his PhD in [[philosophy]] at Stanford in 1982.

He has been a faculty member in Stanford's Department of Philosophy since 1983, prior to which he was a faculty member in the Philosophy Department at [[Princeton University]]. He is also a faculty member of Stanford's Symbolic Systems Program and a senior researcher at the [[Center for the Study of Language and Information]] at Stanford.

Etchemendy's research interests include [[logic]], [[semantics]] and the [[philosophy of language]].  He has challenged orthodox views on the central notions of truth, [[logical consequence]] and [[logical truth]].  His most well-known book, ''The Concept of Logical Consequence'' (1990, 1999), criticizes [[Alfred Tarski]]'s widely accepted analysis of logical consequence.  ''The Liar: An essay on truth and circularity'' (1987, 1992), co-authored with the late [[Jon Barwise]], develops a formal account of the [[liar paradox]] modelled using a version of [[set theory]] incorporating the so-called Anti-Foundation Axiom.

Etchemendy's recent work has focused on the role of diagrams and other nonlinguistic forms of representation in reasoning. His latest book, written with Jon Barwise and Dave Barker-Plummer, is ''[[Language, Proof and Logic]]'' (2000, 2006), a popular introductory logic textbook. He has also developed numerous pieces of instructional software, including ''Turing's World,'' ''[[Tarski's World]],'' ''Fitch,'' and ''Hyperproof,'' software that allows computers to support the reasoning process.

At Stanford, Etchemendy served as director of the Center for the Study of Language and Information from 1990 to 1993, senior associate dean in the School of Humanities and Sciences from 1993 to 1997, and chair of the Department of Philosophy from 1998 to 2000.

He is a member of the American Philosophical Association, on the editorial boards of ''Synthese'' and ''Philosophia Mathematica,'' and a former editor of the ''Journal of Symbolic Logic.''  His wife is the writer [[Nancy Etchemendy]] and they have one son Max Etchemendy.

[[Malta]] has two official languages: [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and [[English language|English]]. Maltese is the national language. Until 1934, [[Italian language|Italian]] was also an official language in Malta.  The country having been governed by many different countries in the past, the [[Maltese people|Maltese population]] is generally able to converse in languages which are not native to the country, namely English and Italian. 

According to the [[Eurobarometer]] poll conducted in 2012, 98% of Maltese people can speak Maltese, 88% can speak English, 66% can speak Italian, and more than 17% speak French.&lt;ref name="Eurobarometer"/&gt; This shows a recent increase in fluency in languages, since in 1995, only 98% of the population spoke Maltese, 76% English, 36% Italian, and 10% French. Surprisingly, it also shows an increase in Italian fluency compared to when Italian was an official language of Malta.&lt;ref name=BBCMalta&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/1045691.stm Country profile: Malta] BBC News; [2008/01/10]; [2008/02/21]&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the 2011 census, there were 377,952 people aged 10 and over, of whom 357,692 people (94.7%) declared they spoke [[Maltese language|Maltese]] at least at an average level, 248,570 (82.1%) declared they spoke English at least at an average level and 93,401 (43.7%) declared they spoke Italian at least at an average level, out of a scale made of "Well", "Average", "A little" and "Not at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014|title=Final Report of the 2011 CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING|url=https://nso.gov.mt/en/publicatons/Publications_by_Unit/Documents/01_Methodology_and_Research/Census2011_FinalReport.pdf|journal=National Statistics Office, Malta|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; French, Russian and Spanish are the other main languages studied in [[Secondary education|secondary]] and [[tertiary education]].&lt;ref name=LinguisticView&gt;Ignasi Badia i Capdevila; [http://www.gencat.cat/llengua/noves/noves/hm04primavera-estiu/docs/a_badia.pdf A view of the linguistic situation in Malta]; NovesSL; [2004]; retrieved on [2008-02-24]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Maltese language}}
[[Image:Lija - city limits sign.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A Maltese welcome sign to the village of [[Ħal Lija]], making use of the letter [[Ħ]], unique to Maltese.&lt;br/&gt;''Suavi fructo rubeo'' is a Latin motto, meaning "I glow red with sweet fruit", referring to the many orange orchards present in the village. ]]

Maltese is the national language of the Maltese people, and one of the official languages of Malta and the [[European Union]]. It is a [[Semitic language]] derived from [[Siculo-Arabic]]; however a majority of vocabulary comes from [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], as described by Maltese linguist [[May Butcher]]. 52% of Maltese words are of Romance origin, a result of significant influence from Italy (in particular [[Sicily]]) and, to a lesser extent, France. Malta holds the distinction of being the only country in Europe with a historically Semitic language. The Maltese language is written with a modified Latin Alphabet which includes the graphemes [[ż]], [[ċ]], [[ġ]], [[ħ]], and [[għ]].

Various localities have accents and dialects divergent from standard Maltese. There has been a decline in the number of dialectal speakers, mostly because of exposure to standard Maltese in the media and the institutionalisation of education. The standard language also shows a more pronounced Italianization and Anglicization of the language.&lt;ref name=LinguisticView /&gt;

== English ==
{{main article|English language}}
[[File:Malta - Ghajnsielem - Comino - Pig farm 01 ies.jpg|thumb|Bilingual danger sign at [[Comino]] in both Maltese and English]]

Before independence in 1964, Malta was a [[United Kingdom|British]] possession, and as a result English is an official language, with government business being carried out in both English and Maltese. Most Maltese learn English in school, as it is obligatory in most cases. Secondary and tertiary education is conducted exclusively in English. Today, 88% of Malta's population speak English. Aside from [[Maltese language|Maltese]], English is the only other official language of the country. Although standard English is official, the variety of English commonly spoken in Malta is heavily influenced by Italian, not only in vocabulary (most commonly by pronouncing Franco-Latin loan words in English in an Italian style) but extending to phonology, with the English being heavily accented; however, [[Received Pronunciation]] remains standard amongst Maltese individuals of a high socioeconomic bracket. Malta also shares with the [[Republic of Ireland]] the distinction of being both officially Anglophone, both members of the [[Eurozone]], and a Catholic dominance.

==French==
During the rule of the Order of St. John the majority of knights were French and French was used by the community in everyday life. However, Italian remained dominant for official purposes. Despite this, it was often used for documentation and maps, because prominent [[military engineer|military engineers]] of the order were French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pullicino|first=Mark|date=2013|title=The Obama Tribe Explorer, James Martin's Biography|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=xRdnDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|publisher=MPI Publishing|isbn=978-99957-0-584-8|oclc=870266285|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[French language|French]] was the official language of the Maltese islands during the [[French occupation of Malta]] (1798-1800).&lt;ref name="Marco"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marco|first1=Elena di|title=The state of the Maltese economy at the end of the eighteenth century.

[[File:Żabbar Tal-Kmand inscription.jpg|thumb|left|Italian inscription from the former ''[[Ġonna tal-Kmand|Ġnien tal-Kmand]]'' at [[Żabbar]]. This inscription dates back from the early 19th century, when Malta was a [[Malta Protectorate|British protectorate]]]]

For many centuries and until 1934, Italian was the official language of Malta. Indeed, it was considered the language of culture in Malta since the Italian [[Renaissance]]. In the 19th century  [[Italian irredentism in Malta|Italian irredentists]] and [[Italian Maltese]] wanted to promote its use throughout Malta for plans to re-unify it to Italy as Malta was part of the Kingdom of Sicily up to 13th century. In the first decades of the 20th century there was even a struggle within Maltese society and politics over the "language problem", which came to a head before [[World War II]]. In 1933 the Constitution was withdrawn over the Government's budgetary vote for the teaching of Italian in elementary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le iniziative culturali italiane negli anni ’30 per Malta e per le comunità maltesi all’estero|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ITA2413/_P6.HTM|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although only the rich could speak Italian, it was however understood by nearly all the population, and with Maltese being generally spoken by those less well-off, Italian was regarded as the official language.

Today, 66% of the Maltese population can speak Italian, and 8% of the population "prefer" to use it in day-to-day conversation, due to the large recent influx of Italian immigrants.&lt;ref name="Eurobarometer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=LinguisticView/&gt; Although Italian has been replaced by English as the official language, it is still used and is spoken commonly in certain professional workplaces by Italian immigrants. The percentage of speakers today, 66%, is in fact much greater than when the language was actually official, in 1931, when only 14% spoke it.&lt;ref name=LinguisticView/&gt;

A large number of Maltese learn Italian through Italian television, mainly [[Mediaset]] and [[RAI]], as their broadcasts reach the [[Maltese Islands]].&lt;ref name=BBCMalta/&gt; In addition to this, many products, services, and businesses that reach Malta are Italian, and many people are exposed to Italian that way.

Recently the Maltese government has mooted the possibility of reinstating Italian as an official language.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

==Greek==
Greek was made an official language of Malta in antiquity in 553 A.D. as part of Sicily by [[Emperor Justinian]]. Though Siculo-Arabic became officially used, Greek remained in use by the upper class until Norman rule which ended in 1194. Greek started to be replaced by Latin around 1130.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.um.edu.mt/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/310729/JMH-2016JohnVella.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin==
[[File:St. Agatha's Tower-main Inscription.JPG|thumb|A Latin inscription from 1649 at [[Saint Agatha's Tower]].]]
For several centuries, Malta was ruled by the order of the [[Knights of Malta]], with members coming from different parts of Europe, when, beside [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] Italian, Latin was commonly used for official purposes such as at the [[Castellania (Valletta)|Castellania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Turkish Historical Review|last=Cassar|first=Carmel|date=2011|title=Malta and the study of Arabic in the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries|url=https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/handle/123456789/16631/OA%20Malta_and_the_study_of_Arabic_in_the_six.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y|volume=2|issue=2|page=128-130|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|doi=10.1163/187754611X603083|issn=1877-5454}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cassar Pullicino|first=J.|date=|title=G.

== Foreign languages ==

In addition to Italian, many Maltese generally have some degree of proficiency in French, and quite a few understand or speak Spanish or [[German language|German]].  Several other languages are studied too, and Arabic and Russian are offered in schools.

The Governmental Circular letter for the school year 2011-2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://schoolnet.gov.mt/sanfrangisktassisi/library/Circulars_Latest/Circulars_2011/02_February/week4b/28.02.CMeLD_43_2011.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722222243/http://schoolnet.gov.mt/sanfrangisktassisi/library/Circulars_Latest/Circulars_2011/02_February/week4b/28.02.CMeLD_43_2011.PDF |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the following language options should be available in schools:

Form I (around the age of 11)
*Arabic
*French
*German
*Italian
*Spanish
This language is studied for the five years in Secondary School

Form III (around the age of 13)
*Arabic
*French
*German
*Italian
*Russian
*Spanish
This language is studied for the last three years in Secondary School

== Media ==

=== Publications ===
There are equal numbers of newspapers published in English and Maltese, with none in Italian.

The vast majority of people preferred English as their choice of reading, with English being preferred by 61.1% of the population for books and 70.89% for magazines. Only 35.8% of the population preferred to read books in Maltese, and 22.7% of them preferred it for magazines.

===Radio===
Regarding radio, Italian takes the place of English, with radio stations being predominantly in Maltese and Italian, with a few in English too.

82.41% of the population regularly listens to Maltese radio, 25.41% listens to Italian, and a smaller 14.69% listens to English radio.&lt;ref name=LinguisticView/&gt;

===Television===
[[Television in Malta|Local television]] channels are broadcast mainly in Maltese and sometimes English. However, many people have access to foreign television channels from Italy, the UK, or other [[Europe]]an countries, or from the United States, either via local [[Melita Cable|cable]] or [[GO (Malta)|digital terrestrial]] services, or directly via [[satellite television|satellite]].

===Online usage of Maltese language===

As at 2005, Maltese was not a commonly used language on the internet, with the majority of "Maltese" websites being written in other languages. Out of a survey conducted on 13 Maltese websites, 12 of them were entirely in English, with one being bilingual, but not Maltese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mek.oszk.hu/minerva/html/dok/malta.doc Country report for MINERVA Plus in 2005]; Multilingual issues in Malta; Retrieved on [2008-02-24]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Possible scenarios for the future of Maltese are a subject of speculation among scholars. Dialectal variation of Maltese is in decline. There is influence from English and Italian. There is a perceived [[language shift]] towards English amongst the [[Maltese people|Maltese]], with lexological and grammatical patterns in the Maltese increasingly anglicized.&lt;ref name=LinguisticView/&gt; However this absorption of linguistic influences saturates the history of the Maltese, which remains spoken by almost 100% of the population.&lt;ref name=LinguisticView/&gt;

A '''lightning talk''' is a very short [[presentation]] lasting only a few minutes, given at a [[Academic conference|conference]] or similar forum. Several lightning talks will usually be delivered by different speakers in a single session, sometimes called a '''data blitz'''.

Some formats of lightning talk, including [[PechaKucha]] and [[Ignite (event)|Ignite]], involve a specific number of slides that are automatically advanced at fixed intervals.  Lightning talks are often referred to as ignite talks.

==History==
The [[Yet Another Perl Conference|YAPC]] (Yet Another Perl Conference) 19100 Conference came up with the term “lightning talk” at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. The term was first coined by Mark Jason Dominus in June 2000.&lt;ref name="yapc2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perl.plover.com/lt/talks-2000.html | title=Talks that were presented at YAPC 19100 | accessdate=2007-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/01/14/presentations-pecha-kucha-technology-breakthroughs-oreilly.html |title=The End Of Boring Presentations |first=Scott |last=Berkun |date=January 14, 2010 |work=[[Forbes.com]] |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=January 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of lightning talks was first known to be used at the Python Conference in 1997, but was not named until the YAPC 19100 Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dominus|first=Mark|title=Reports From YAPC 19100|url=http://www.perl.com/pub/2000/07/yapc19101.html|publisher=Perl.com|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and format==
Lightning talks are designed to be short presentations between five and ten minutes long, but are usually capped at five minutes.&lt;ref name="Giving Lightning Talks"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler|first=Mark|title=Giving Lightning Talks|url=http://www.perl.com/pub/2004/07/30/lightningtalk.html|publisher=Perl.com|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most conferences will allot a segment of roughly 30 to 90 minutes long to speakers. Talks are arranged one after the other during the sessions. The talks are usually given at conferences in order for the event to have many speakers discuss a multitude of topics. The conferences are held in order for individuals to be able to share their ideas and concepts to people who have experience in the specific field.&lt;ref name="Why You Should Give a Lightning Talk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Corkey|first=Joe|title=Why You Should Give a Lightning Talk|url=http://businessofsoftware.org/2013/07/why-you-should-give-a-lightning-talk-2/|publisher=Business of Software|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lightning talks are brief which requires the speaker to make their point clearly and rid the presentation of non-critical information.  This causes the audience to be more attentive to the speaker and gain a broader array of knowledge from the presentations given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lightning Talks|url=http://perl.plover.com/lt/lightning-talks.html|publisher=http://perl.plover.com/|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The format of lightning talks varies greatly from conference to conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ERSI International User Conference|url=http://www.esri.com/events/user-conference/sessions/lightning-talks|publisher=Esri|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[slideshow|Slides]] may be discouraged, and a single computer running a [[Presentation program]] is used by all speakers. In general lightning talks are given in a format that can include slides but if so, the speaker must be careful not to read the details which they include.&lt;ref name="Giving Lightning Talks" /&gt; 

The term ''data blitz'' is sometimes used to refer to a session of lightning talks, particularly at academic conferences in the sciences and social sciences such as the annual conference of the [[Society for Personality and Social Psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SPSP 2012 Data Blitz |url=http://spspmeeting.org/2013/Sessions/Data-Blitz.aspx |work=SPSP 2012 Conference |publisher=The Society for Personality and Social Psychology |accessdate=29 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916015953/http://spspmeeting.org/2013/Sessions/Data-Blitz.aspx |archivedate=16 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The goal of lightning talks is to articulate a topic in a quick, insightful, and clear manner. These concise and efficient talks are intended to grab the attention of the audience, convey key information, and allow for several presenters to share their ideas in a brief period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giving a good lightning talk|url=http://software.ac.uk/home/cw11/giving-good-lightning-talk|publisher=Software Sustainability Institute|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A list of [[Urdu language]] films in year order. The films listed here are mostly from [[Pakistan]]. For a full list of Pakistani films which includes [[Punjabi language]], and [[Bengali language]] films in addition to Urdu see [[List of Pakistani films]]. Most films from Bollywood (India) are in mixed Hindi and Urdu with a spectrum ranging from entirely Urdu to mostly Hindi.&lt;ref name="scienceandmediamuseum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Decoding the Bollywood poster|url=https://blog.scienceandmediamuseum.org.uk/decoding-the-bollywood-poster/|website=[[National Science and Media Museum]]|date=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Akhtar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aḵẖtar|first1=Jāvīd|authorlink1=Javed Akhtar|last2=Kabir|first2=Nasreen Munni|title=Talking Films: Conversations on Hindi Cinema with Javed Akhtar|date=2002|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780195664621|page=49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JILAQAAMAAJ|language=en|quote=JA: I write dialogue in Urdu, but the action and descriptions are in English.

Not only me, I think most of the writers working in this so-called Hindi cinema write in Urdu: [[Gulzar]], or [[Rajinder Singh Bedi]] or [[Inder Raj Anand]] or [[Rahi Masoom Raza]] or [[Wajahat Mirza|Vahajat Mirza]], who wrote dialogue for films like ''[[Mughal-e-Azam]]'' and ''[[Gunga Jumna]]'' and ''[[Mother India]]''. So most dialogue-writers and most song-writers are from the Urdu discipline, even today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="film-world"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Film World|journal=Film World|year=1974|volume=10|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sHlTAAAAYAAJ|publisher=T.M. Ramachandran|language=en|quote=I feel that the Government should eradicate the age-old evil of certifying Urdu films as Hindi ones. It is a known fact that Urdu has been willingly accepted and used by the film industry. Two eminent Urdu writers [[Krishan Chander]] and [[Ismat Chughtai]] have said that "more than seventy-five per cent of films are made in Urdu." It is a pity that although Urdu is freely used in films, the producers in general mention the language of the film as "Hindi" in the application forms supplied by the Censor Board. It is a gross misrepresentation and unjust to the people who love Urdu.}}&lt;/ref&gt; See article on [[Hindustani language]] and [[list of Bollywood films]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37782">The '''Massachusett dialects''', as well as all the SNEA languages, could be dialects of a common SNEA language just as Danish, Swedish and Norwegian are mutually intelligible languages that essentially exist in a dialect continuum and three national standards.  With the exception of Massachusett, which was adopted as the ''lingua franca'' of Christian Indian proselytes and survives in hundreds of manuscripts written by native speakers as well as several extensive missionary works and translations, most of the other SNEA languages are only known from fragmentary evidence, such as place names.  [[Quinnipiac]] (Quiripey) is only attested in a rough translation of the [[Lord's Prayer]] and a bilingual catechism by the English missionary Abraham Pierson in 1658.  Coweset is only attested in a handful of lexical items that bear clear dialectal variation after thorough linguistic review of [[Roger Williams]]' ''[[A Key into the Language of America]]'' and place names, but most of the languages are only known from local place names and passing mention of the Native peoples in local historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, D. J. (2007). pp. 82-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within what is usually regarded as Massachusett, there were certainly dialects as it was spoken by several different peoples across a broad region, and widely adopted as a second language over most of New England and Long Island.&lt;ref name="Pidgin"&gt;Goddard, I. (2000). 'The Use of Pidgins and Jargons on the East Coast of North America' in Gray, E. G. and Fiering, N. (eds.) The Language Encounter in the Americas, 1492-1800: A Collection of Essays. (pp. 61-80).&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of the dialect of the Massachusett—specifically the speech of the Praying town of Natick, with some Nipmuc influences—in the Bible led to it assuming the role of a ''de facto'' standard and prestige variant, especially in regards to writing.  The spoken language was also highly influenced by the speech of Natick since a large number of the Indian missionaries, teachers and clerks included many men from prestigious, chiefly families from or with kinship connections there or had spent several years there in training before going on to serve other Indian communities.  The Indians adopted literacy with the orthography of Eliot's Bible, and even began to adjust their speech, leading to [[dialect levelling|dialect leveling]] across the region.&lt;ref&gt;Connole, D. A. (2007). pp. 101-104.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1722, only fifty-nine years after the publication Eliot's Bible translation, [[Experience Mayhew]] remarked on the leveling effects on Martha's Vineyard, where the local speech was quite distinct, '... most of the little differences betwixt them have been happily Lost, and our Indians Speak, but especially write much as the Natick do.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, J. (1830). ''Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society.  John Davis (ed.) Vol II(3). pp. 242-243. Cambridge, MA: E. W. Metcalf Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wamp"&gt;Mandell, D. R. (1996). ''Behind the Frontier: Indians in Eighteenth-Century Eastern Massachusetts''. (p. 59). Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some vestiges of dialects continued even with leveling, and Martha's Vineyard islanders continued to use variant forms such as '''''ohkuh''''' instead of '''''ohke''''' ('''''ahkee''''') {{IPA|/ahkiː/}}&lt;ref&gt;Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; 'earth' or 'land,' and ''ummenaweankanut'', 'in his posterity,' instead of '''''uppommetuwonkkanit''''' ('''''upumeetyuwôkanut''''') {{IPA|/əpəmiːtʲəwãkanət/}}&lt;ref&gt;Baird, J. L. D. (c. 1993). Wôpanâak-language Dictionary. [http://web.mit.edu/norvin/www/pumeetyuwok.pdf Sample entry for ''pumeetyuwôk(an)''], with third-person prefix (''-[w]u'') and locative suffix (-''ut'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goddon"&gt;Goddard, I., &amp; Bragdon, K. (1988). p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Occasional variation in spelling seems to indicate some dialectal interference.  Syncopation, relatively rare in Natick speech, was a spreading feature and seems to have been an obligatory feature of late-stage SNEA languages, possibly an influence from the Abenakian languages.  Thus, '''''kuts''''', 'cormorant,' and '''''ꝏsqheonk''''', 'his blood,' but more generally these words are found as non-syncopated '''''kuttis''''' ('''''kutuhs''''') {{IPA|/kətəhs/}}&lt;ref&gt;Costa, D. J. (2007). p. 97. From PA *''kentehsiwa''.&lt;/ref&gt; and '''''wusqueheonk''''' ('''''wusqeeheôk''''') {{IPA|/wəskʷiːhiːjᵊãk/}}, respectively, that appeared in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, D. J. 2007. pp. 96-99.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, most of the surviving manuscripts and documents that do demonstrate dialectal variation are often of uncertain geographical and ethnic origin.

[[Daniel Gookin]], who had traveled with [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] on his missions, brought the Indians under the jurisdiction of the colonial government and was responsible for bringing the Indians under English laws and governance.  He noted that the Pawtucket, Massachusett and Pokanoket (Wampanoag) all spoke the same language, and may have considered the separate peoples to have spoken distinct dialects. Ives Goddard proposed the dialects of Natick, North Shore (Pawtucket), Wampanoag, Nauset and Coweset, produced somewhat similarly below, and is mostly grouped according to the various peoples known in history that are believed to have spoken the language.&lt;ref name="Goddard, I. 1990 pp. 227-244"&gt;Goddard, I. (1990). 'Unhistorical features of massachusett.' J. Fisiak (Ed.), ''Historical Linguistics and Philology: Trends in Linguistics. Studies and Monographs [TILSM]'' (Vol. 46, pp. 227–244). Berlin, Germany: Walter de Gruyter&lt;/ref&gt;

==Massachusett==

{{See also|Massachusett}}
[[File:Eliot Church of South Natick - DSC09557.JPG|right|thumb|140px|The Church of South Natick built over the original church in 1828.  Services were conducted by Indian congregants in ''Massachusee unnont&amp;#xA74F;waonk'' well into the mid-18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot Church of Natick. (2016). '[http://www.theeliotchurch.org/our-history/ Our History – From 1651 to the Present].' Retrieved 27 Nov 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The dialect specific to the Massachusett people was likely a prestigious dialect.  Elderly converts in Natick informed Eliot and Gookin that the Massachusett leaders were able to exert political influence and exact tribute over most of the other Massachusett-speaking peoples and all the tribes as far west as the [[Pioneer Valley]], such as the [[Nipmuc]], [[Nashaway]] and [[Pocomtuc]], before weakened by epidemics that greatly reduced the population, warfare with enemy tribes and competition with English settlers.&lt;ref name="Confederacy"&gt;Bragdon, K. J. (2005). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fKarAgAAQBAJ The Columbia Guide to American Indians of the Northeast]''. (pp. 133-135). New York, NY: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a practical feature, the Massachusett were centrally located between other Massachusett speakers, thus it was understood over a broader region of the dialect continuum.

The dialect was likely the basis of Massachusett Pidgin, adopted as a regional language of commerce and intertribal communication over most of New England and Long Island.&lt;ref name="Pidgin"/&gt;  The Natick variety was used by Eliot as the basis of the written language used in his translations of the Bible and other works, thus making it an unofficial standard language of writing, and also prestigious variety because of the pronounced role of Natick and its people in the mission to the Indians.  The influence caused significant dialect leveling as speakers adjusted their speech, thus the Natick variety greatly influenced dialects enough to erase many of the differences.

From place name and document evidence, Massachusett seems to prefer the locative suffix '''''-et'''''/'''''-it'''''/'''''-ut''''' {{IPA|/ət/}} over the older form {{IPA|/ək/}} form that generally appears elsewhere, and many place names were 'standardized' to Massachusett spellings and norms across the region.  Although the latter form still appears in Massachusett written sources of Natick until a late period, in place names, it is not found in traditional Massachusett or Narragansett place names and had varying mixtures of usage elsewhere.  The dialect of the Massachusett also seems to have resisted syncope, which is obligatory in many late-stage SNEA languages, which may have been prevented in Massachusett due to fossilization as a written language.

Massachusett people historically ranged over much of the [[Greater Boston]] region, lining the shores of [[Boston Harbor]] and extending west towards the fall line, corresponding roughly to the [[Massachusetts Route 128|128 beltway]], and much of the [[South Shore (Massachusetts)|South Shore]] almost as far south as Plymouth.  They were later confined to the Praying towns of Natick and Ponkapoag, in [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]] and [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]], and Titicut and Mattakeesett, corresponding to [[Bridgewater, Massachusetts|Bridgewater]] and [[Pembroke, Massachusetts]].

As the Massachusett were mainly confined to the Praying towns and adjusted to the written language, it is uncertain if there was any internal diversity.  Natick was originally settled by Massachusett people from Nonantum, later joined by the Nipmuc that lived west of Natick.  Although the community remained a Massachusett-speaking one, it is quite possible that Nipmuc influenced it to some extent.  Titicut and Mattakeesett were near Wampanoag areas, and many of the Praying Indians in those communities were close to and had kinship relations with Wampanoag just to the south.  The language survived until the 1740s when the Indians were reduced to colonial wards under appointed guardians and large portions of the town were either sold or rented to English settlers. Only one speaker could be found in 1798, and the language likely went exist in the dawning years of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Goddard, I. p. 20"&gt;Goddard, I., &amp; Bragdon, K. (1988). (185 ed., p. 20).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although no speakers remain today, the two state-recognized Massachusett tribes of Natick and of Ponkapoag continue to use the language in its colonial orthography for cultural, sacred and liturgical purposes.&lt;ref name="Our History"&gt;''Sachemsquaw''Naticksqw, C.

The written language survives in the records of Natick until 1721, when administrative control of the town passed into the hands of English settlers.  In addition, it is essentially the language of all of Eliot's translations of the Bible and several other religious works by other English missionaries and some personal letters from Natick.

==Wampanoag (Pokanoket)==

{{See also|Wampanoag}}
[[File: Wampanoag clothing.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional Wôpanâak clothing on display at the Cape Cod Museum.  The Wampanoag were able to preserve much of their native culture and identity, and as of 1993, have also reclaimed their language.]]

('''''Wôpanâôt8âôk''''') {{IPA|/wãpanaːãtuːaːãk/}}, 'Wampanoag language,' historically represented several divergent forms, mainly due to the insular regions.  The Wampanoag inhabited most of southeastern Massachusetts, with more isolated, and likely divergent, communities found on Cape Cod, the Elizabeth Islands, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.  In addition, Wampanoag inhabited much of what is now south-eastern Rhode Island.  The name of the people refers to the 'east' or 'dawn,' from Massachusett '''''wompan-''''' ('''''wôpan-''''') {{IPA|/wãpan/}}.  In terms of contemporary speakers of the Massachusett language, all of them are speakers of the revived Wampanoag dialect of the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project and come from the Aquinnah, Assonet, Herring Pond and Mashpee tribes.  Historically, the Wampanoag were also known as the Pokanoket, which was actually the name of a confederacy that included most of the Wampanoag tribes.

The isolation of the islanders from the mainland led to a large amount of internal diversity.  John Cotton, Sr., who had grown up as missionary on Martha's Vineyard, told his son, who had become a missionary to the Wampanoag just south of Plymouth, on the mainland, the following to describe mutual intelligibility:

''''''Mat woh nummissohhamꝏ͝un asuh matta newahĭteo webe yeu noowahteauun yeug Indiansog mat wahtanooog uag Indiansog ut nishnoh kuttooonganit.''''''&lt;br&gt;
'I can't tell or don't know, only this I know, that these Indians don't understand every word of them Indians.'&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, J. (1830). pp. 242-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

The island regions of Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and the Elizabeth Islands all shared some common features that kept them distinct from the mainland, but were distinct from each other.  Martha's Vineyard was the most divergent speech, difficult for off-islanders from the mainland or other islands.  Despite [[dialect levelling|dialect leveling]] that helped erase these features, the written documents continue to have a small set of divergent vocabulary that persists in native documents produced by Martha's Vineyard islanders.  For example, '''''nehpuk''''', 'my blood,' continues in use despite the standard form '''''nusqeheonk''''' ('''''nusqeeheôk''''') {{IPA|/nəskʷiːhjãk/}}.&lt;ref name="Goddon"/&gt;  The continued use of variant forms in writing probably was a legacy of the separate network of missionaries and missionary schools.  The Wampanoag on the mainland often accepted ministers and literate Indians from or who had trained in Natick, whereas the Martha's Vineyard Wampanoag were administered by the Mayhew family, with several generations of bilingual ministers working the mission and providing instruction and establishment of Indian schools which may have re-enforced local features.

The Wampanoag on Cape Cod and the Islands were fortunate to have been isolated from the ravages of [[King Philip's War]] and for having the trust of their English neighbors, and these Wampanoag tribes emerged from the war relatively unscathed.  The population of Wampanoag increased after the war as many Indians joined the larger settlements, where the English settlers were more tolerant, land was still ample, proximity to seaports where men could find work on whaling vessels and ability to find Indian spouses, and by the early eighteenth century, it is estimated that 70 per cent of the Indians in Massachusetts were Wampanoag or had assimilated into the Wampanoag community.  As a result, the spoken language was able to cling on as the dominant language until the 1770s, but the last native speakers died in Martha's Vineyard sometime in the late nineteenth century.  Rememberers that knew bits of the language were recorded by Frank Speck and Gladys Tantaquidgeon in the 1920s, but Gordon Day was able to record some vocabulary from a remember as late as the 1960s.

The documents from the Wampanoag make up the majority of surviving written records, such as the marriage, baptism and death records of Indian churches; deeds and land sales; petitions to the court; personal letters; marginalia on the edges of books, letters and other records.  In addition, the Wampanoag dialect was an influence on the second publication of the Massachusett-language Bible, edited with the help of John Cotton, Sr., and the five contributions of Experience Mayhew to Indian missionary literature, including the most widespread primer for teaching Indians to read and write in the first quarter of the eighteenth century.  Both John Cotton, Sr. and Experience Mayhew were fluent speakers of Martha's Vineyard speech.

With the current success of the language thanks to the work of the WLRP, there is a growing L2 community of 15 '''''(Wôpanâôt8âôk)''''' speakers and 500 and growing students from the participating Mashpee, Aquinnah, Herring Pond and Assonet tribes and new records in the revived orthography such as complete teaching materials for pre-school through high school, a dictionary, a grammar and numerous other didactic publications.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2011/11/we-still-live-here.html Saskia De Melker, "'We Still Live Here' Traces Comeback of Wampanoag Indian Language"], [[PBS Newshour]], 11-10-2011, accessed 18 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;Rose, Christina (2014-02-25).

==Pawtucket==

{{See also|Pennacook}}
[[File:Pawtucket Falls viewed from Pawtucket Gatehouse; Lowell, MA; 2012-05-19.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Pawtucket Falls (Massachusetts)|Pawtucket Falls]].  This is close to the site of the former Praying Town of Wamesit, but the Pawtucket fled north to join the Pennacook and Abenaki after Metacomet's Rebellion.]]

The Pawtucket were a collection of tribes living north of the Massachusett, corresponding to the regions of the [[North Shore (Massachusetts)|North Shore]], [[Cape Ann]], the northern third of [[Central Massachusetts]] and the lower [[Merrimack Valley]] and its tributaries.  It includes the [[Naumkeag people|Naumkeag]], [[Agawam people|Agawam]] and ''Aberginian'' peoples listed in early colonial sources.  Prior to English settlement, the Pawtucket were likely part of the Massachusett Confederacy, but as the Massachusett were weakened by disease, loss of land, attacks from enemy tribes and competition from English settlers, most of the tribes fell under the influence of the [[Pennacook]], an Abenakian people that traditionally inhabited the Merrimack Valley of southern and central New Hampshire, extending into northern areas of Central Massachusetts.  The name derives from '''''pawtucket''''', a common place name in New England which seems to be a contraction of '''''pentucket''''' ('''''punuhtukut''''') {{IPA|/pənəhtəkət/}}&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, N. (2007). p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bright, W. (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5XfxzCm1qa4C Native American Placenames of the United States].'' p. 119. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and signifies 'at the waterfall,' specifically [[Pawtucket Falls (Massachusetts)|Pawtucket Falls]], a major waterfall on the Merrimack in the city of [[Lowell, Massachusetts]].

The dialect of the Pawtucket is mainly known from a vocabulary of roughly three hundred words in William Wood's 1634 ''New-Englands Prospect'' as well as place names.  The vocabulary is too small to provide clear information about the Pawtucket dialect, but it does demonstrate that the Pawtucket, at least along the coast, essentially spoke the same language as the Massachusett.  What might appear as dialectal differences are often because many words seem to be suffixed with the obviative or diminutive endings, but some might vocabulary might have Abenakian influence, as the Pawtucket occupied the SNEA frontier with Abenakian languages, but even Gookin and Eliot considered the Pawtucket to have spoken essentially the same language as the Massachusett.&lt;ref name="Goddard, I. 1990 pp. 227-244"/&gt;

The dialect was likely extinct by the early eighteenth century if not earlier.  Most of the Pawtucket had fled north and joined the Pennacook due to usurpation of their lands, but some came under the influence of Eliot's mission to the Indians, settling with Pennacook and Nipmuc in the Praying town of Wamesit and the Nipmuc and Massachusett in the Praying town of Okommakamesitt ([[Marlborough, Massachusetts]]) where these Indians may have fallen under the influence of the Massachusett dialect of Natick as used in writing.  After King Philip's War, those that returned to Wamesit and Okommakamesitt faced harassment, vandalized property, retaliatory attacks and continuous challenges to their land.  Under threats and pressure, Wamesit was sold by 1685, with its people following the Merrimack north with other peoples to seek shelter with the Pennacook, who in turn, later merged into the Abenaki of northern New England and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Chelmsford Historical Society. (2018). '[http://www.chelmhist.org/indians.htm Indian History from the ''History of Chelmsford'' by Wilson Waters].' Retrieved 12 Feb 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  Okommakamesitt was sold in 1686 by the General Court with a false deed produced by the English settlers on the edges of the Praying town.  All but a handful of Indians retained their lands in Marlborough until they too were dispossessed in 1716, with most resettling in Natick, joining relatives up north or quietly assimilating into the surrounding community.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, C.

==Nauset==

{{See also|Nauset}}
[[File:Good_stories_for_great_birthdays,_arranged_for_story-telling_and_reading_aloud_and_for_the_children's_own_reading_(1922)_(14768269922).jpg|thumb|left|110 px|Illustration of ''Sachem'' [[Iyannough]] bringing the lost boy, [[John Billington]], back to Plymouth.]]

The Nauset dialect was supposed to have been spoken by the Nauset people, traditionally inhabiting all the lands of 'Mid Cape' and 'Outer' or 'Lower Cape' regions of the Cape Cod Peninsula, roughly coinciding with all the portions of the peninsula east of the [[Bass River (Massachusetts)|Bass River]], including the sharp bend north from [[Chatham, Massachusetts|Chatham]] to [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]], and associated islands such as [[Monomoy Island]].  The Nauset may have also had outposts or settled parts of Nantucket.&lt;ref name="Speck"&gt;Speck, F. G. (1928). ''Territorial Subdivisions and Boundaries of the Wampanoag, Massachusett and Nauset Indians.'' Frank Hodge (ed). Lancaster, PA: Lancaster Press. p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  The name may derive from '''''nashw-''''' ('''''nuhshw-''''') {{IPA|/nəhʃw/}},&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, N. (2006). p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; 'three' but also used in the sense of 'between' as in 'third between two others,' due to the location of their principal settlement between two harbors, but probably derives from '''''nôset'''''&lt;ref&gt;Trumbull, J. H. (1903). p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; ('''''nôw[ee]sut''''') {{IPA|/nãw[iː]sət/}},&lt;ref name="Hicks, N. 2006. p. 24"&gt;Hicks, N. (2006). p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to a 'place of small distance' probably referring to the narrowness of the Cape Cod peninsula.

There is little known about the dialect of the Nauset, as it only exists in place names.  It is uncertain if the Nauset were a separate entity.  Despite a somewhat difference of culture, due to salty and sandy soils that forced a heavier reliance on exploitation of resources from the sea, the Nauset were likely a tribe of Wampanoag and therefore consideration of their speech as a separate dialect is probably because of their listing in historical, and many current, sources that list the Nauset as a separate people.  However, the Nauset could have been a separate entity, given their isolation on the edge of the narrows of the Outer Cape and their resistance to joining the Pokanoket Confederacy, which governed all the Wampanoag tribes, at various points in history.

The Nauset are extinct as a people today.  The Nauset were able to survive the ravages of King Philip's War unscathed due to their isolation, trust of the local English settlers and neutrality.  Most of the Nauset relocated to Mashpee where they joined the local Wampanoag when it was established as a Praying town of the Plymouth Colony, and thus, many Mashpee Wampanoag likely have significant Nauset ancestry in their Native bloodlines.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, F. W. (1910). p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  The unique features of the speech of the Wampanoag remembers from Mashpee recorded by Speck may be due to Nauset features but could just as easily be considered dialectal variation, late-stage language usage and incorrect 'remembering' of the language as it was recorded from elders that did not speak the language.&lt;ref name="Speck"/&gt;

==Coweset dialect (Narragansett?)==

[[File:Roger_Williams_and_Narragansetts.jpg|thumb|right|Engraving of [[Roger Williams]] meeting with members of the [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]].  In addition to many words of Narragansett and Massachusett origin, Williams recorded some terms of Coweset in his 1643 ''A Key into the Language of America.'']]

The Coweset people inhabited much of what is now central and northern [[Rhode Island]], wedged between the [[Nipmuc]] to the north and north-west and the [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] (Nanhigganeuck), with the town of [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]] purchased by [[Roger Williams]] from local Nipmuc and Cowest peoples. The Coweset were sometimes considered a tribe of Nipmuc, but they seem to have spoken an N-dialect, akin to Massachusett, and came under the political control of the Narragansett until they were able to shake off Narragansett domination in the late seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Coweset"&gt;Hodge, F. W. (1912a). p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from Massachusett '''''kꝏwaset''''' (*'''''k8wasut''''') {{IPA|/kuːwasət/}}, 'small pine place.'&lt;ref&gt;Trumbull, J. H. (1903). pp. 41, 307.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bright, W. (2004). pp. 124-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Very little is known about the dialect of the Coweset.  From place names, the language was an N-dialect, like Massachusett, but was wedged in a transitional area Massachusett to the north and north-east, L-dialect Nipmuc to the north-west and the Narragansett Y-dialect to the south.  It is only attested in dialectal variation that appear in doublets and triplets in Roger Williams' ''A Key into the Language of America.'' By Williams' own accounts, most of his time in Rhode Island was spent with the Coweset, and the Narragansett were Y-dialect speakers, yet most of the vocabulary of the ''Key'' features N-dialect vocabulary.

The majority of vocabulary in the ''Key'' is essentially Massachusett with the idiosyncratic system Williams used to write Algonquian words, followed by Y-dialect words.  A small subset include N-dialect words with pronounced features of Y-dialects.  For instance, the word to refer to the animal 'deer' is listed by Williams as '''''attuck''''', cognate to Massachusett '''''attuck''''' ('''''ahtuq'''''') {{IPA|/ahtək/}} and '''''nóonatch''''', which seems to be related to Mohegan-Pequot Y-dialect '''''noyuhc''''' {{IPA|/nuːjəhtʃ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Fielding, S. (2006). ''A Modern Mohegan Dictionary.'' Uncasville, CT: Mohegan Tribe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Costa, D. J. (2007). p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;  In another instance, the PSNEA verb *'''''ərāyəw''''', 'it is so,' appears in a cognate Massachusett form '''''nni''''', related to Massachusett '''''unnai''''' ('''''unây''''') {{IPA|/ənaːj/}}, Y-dialect '''''eîu''''' {{IPA|*/əjaːjəw/}} and transitional N-dialect '''''nnîu''''' {{IPA|*/[ə]naːjəw/}}, which preserves the final {{IPA|/-əw/}} that was seldom used in Massachusett.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, D. J. (2007). p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Narragansett is a Y-dialect, as seen in the short word list recorded by Ezra Stiles in 1769 from an elderly Narragansett women near Aquidneck ([[Newport, Rhode Island]]) and twenty words extracted by Alfred Gatschet from a Narragansett-language '[[speaker types|rememberer]]' in Pôcasset ([[Providence, Rhode Island]]), it is clear that the language spoken near the end was unambiguously a Y-dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Mithun, M. (1999). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ALnf3s2m7PkC The Languages of Native North America].'' p. 330. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this may be because the Narragansett were greatly reduced by King Philip's War and survivors joined the Eastern Niantic, who also spoke a Y-dialect, so that most Narragansett after the war have significant Eastern Niantic ancestry and this may have re-enforced Y-dialect features.  It is the position of Ives Goddard and David Costa that the N-dialect vocabulary identical to Massachusett is Massachusett, since Williams spent his formative years in the New World bouncing between the Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies; the N-dialect with Y-dialect features represents a transitional dialect that Coweset would likely have been due to its location and Y-dialect vocabulary that represents Narragansett or possibly Eastern Niantic.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, D. J. (2007). pp. 111-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coweset are extinct as a people today.  It is likely that many Coweset joined the Narragansett in seeking refuge with the Eastern Niantic and have distant descendants in current members of the Narragansett.  Many Coweset likely fled and joined the [[Stockbridge-Munsee Community|Stockbridge-Munsee]], [[Schaghticoke people|Schaghticoke]] in northwestern Connecticut, the Abenaki in Canada or the [[Brothertown Indians|Brothertown]] tribe, which together with the Stockbridge-Munsee, were removed to Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;Swanton, J. R. 1952. pp. 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other dialects and dialect comparison==

The Aquidneck Indian Council, a Rhode Island-recognized educational and cultural institution for Native Americans, re-translated the Algonquian content of Roger Williams' ''Key into the Language of America'', in an effort to better document and revive the [[Narragansett language]], using comparisons with the Massachusett-language corpus as well as reconstructions based on evolutionary patterns of linguistic change from PA to SNEA.  This, however, would be considered by other specialists, such as Goddard and Costa, as conflation of the mixed dialects found in the ''Key.''  However, even if only using Y-dialect material to reconstruct Narragansett would still produce a language similar still similar to other SNEA languages, which were most likely as related to each other as the dialects of the [[North Germanic languages|Nordic languages]] whose speakers can communicate, using their respective languages, and still understand and be understood by other parties, with difficulties increasing with distance and certain aberrant dialects.

The Massachusett language also spread, with the majority of Eliot's Praying towns established in Nipmuc country as well as a few located near the confluence of Nipmuc, Pawtucket, Massachusett and Pennacook influence, such as Wamesit, but possibly also possibly Nashoba ([[Littleton, Massachusetts]]) as well as other missionary communities such as Washacum ([[Sterling, Massachusetts]]) and Nashaway ([[Lancaster, Massachusetts]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mandell, D. R. (1996). pp. 17, 27, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nipmuc also came to settle Natick, with [[James Printer]] said to be the most prolific translator as well as printer of [[Eliot's Indian Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Conole, D. A. (2007). pp. 100-110.&lt;/ref&gt; The Indians that chose to stay away likely preserved their languages.  For instance, a French missionary priest near [[Montreal, Quebec]] recorded a language sometime in the mid-eighteenth century that was most similar to Massachusett, complete with numerous loan words from English but was clearly an L-dialect, so may represent the original Nipmuc language removed from the standardizing effects of the prestigious Massachusett used by the literate Indians or a related but unknown language of New England's central interior.&lt;ref name="Gust"&gt;Gustuffson, H.

'''Movima''' is a language that is spoken by about 1,400 (nearly half) of the Movima, a group of Native Americans that resides in the [[Llanos de Moxos]] region of the [[Bolivia]]n Amazon, in northeastern Bolivia. It is considered a [[language isolate]], as it has not been proven to be related to any other language.

==Phonology==
Movima has five [[vowel]]s:
{|class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
|+ The vowels of Movima
|-
! &amp;nbsp; !! [[Front vowel|Front]] !! [[Central vowel|Central]] !! [[Back vowel|Back]]

| i

|-
! [[Mid vowel|Mid]]
| e
|
| o
|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
|
| a
|
|}
{{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} more closely resemble {{IPA|[ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}}, respectively, than the [[close-mid vowel]]s {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[o]}}. Vowels have a phonemic length distinction, although some prosodic processes can lengthen otherwise short vowels. Movima does not have [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_mov |title=WALS – Movima |accessdate=2008-10-24 |work=World Atlas of Language Structures Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plosive {{IPA|/p/}} is realized as {{IPA|[p]}} in the syllable onset but as {{IPA|[pʔᵐ]}} (which contrasts with the simple nasal phoneme {{IPA|/m/}}) in the coda. Similarly, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} are realized as {{IPA|[tʔⁿ]}} and {{IPA|[ʔ&lt;sup&gt;ɤ&lt;/sup&gt;]}} (i.e., as a [[glottal stop]] with a vocalic release), respectively, in the syllable coda.&lt;ref name="Katharina Haude 2006"/&gt; In vowel-initial words and between adjacent vowels, an epenthetic glottal stop appears.

The phonemes {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} are only present in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] loanwords.

==Morphology==
In Movima, [[compound (linguistics)|compound]]ing and [[incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]] are productive [[derivational morphology|derivational]] processes. [[Reduplication]] and [[affix]]ation, including some processes (such as the [[irrealis]] marker ''(k)a''') that resemble [[infix]]ation, are also common. Typical examples of [[inflection]], such as [[grammatical number|number]], [[grammatical case|case]], [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], and [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], are not obligatorily marked in Movima.&lt;ref name="Katharina Haude 2006"/&gt; Many derivational processes can be applied to a single Movima word. The same morpheme may appear multiple times in one word this way, for instance, ''tikoy-na-poj-na'' "I make X kill Y."

An '''[[Ordinal number|ω]]-language''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of infinite-length sequences of [[symbol (formal)|symbols]].

==Formal definition==

Let Σ be a set of symbols (not necessarily finite). Following the standard definition from [[formal language]] theory, Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is the set of all ''finite'' words over Σ. Every finite word has a length, which is, obviously, a natural number. Given a word ''w'' of length ''n'', ''w'' can be viewed as a function from the set {0,1,...,''n''-1} → Σ, with the value at ''i'' giving the symbol at position ''i''. The infinite words, or ω-words, can likewise be viewed as functions from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; to Σ. The set of all infinite words over Σ is denoted Σ&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;. The set of all finite ''and'' infinite words over Σ is sometimes written Σ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;.

Thus, an ω-language ''L'' over Σ is a [[subset]] of Σ&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Operations==

Some common operations defined on ω-languages are:

* ''Intersection and union''. Given ω-languages ''L'' and ''M'', both ''L'' ∪ ''M'' and ''L'' ∩ ''M'' are ω-languages.
* ''Left concatenation''. Let ''L'' be an ω-language, and ''K'' be a language of finite words only. Then ''K'' can be concatenated on the left ''only'' to ''L'' to yield the new ω-language ''KL''.
* ''Omega (infinite iteration)''. As the notation hints, the operation (&lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; is the infinite version of the [[Kleene star]] operator on finite-length languages. Given a formal language ''L'', ''L''&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; is the ω-language of all infinite sequences of words from ''L''; in the functional view, of all functions &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;→''L''.
* ''Prefixes''. Let ''w'' be an ω-word. Then the formal language Pref(''w'') contains every ''finite'' [[Prefix (computer science)|prefix]] of ''w''.
* ''Limit''. Given a finite-length language ''L'', an ω-word ''w'' is in the ''limit'' of ''L'' if and only if Pref(''w'') ∩ ''L'' is an ''infinite'' set. In other words, for an arbitrarily large natural number ''n'', it is always possible to choose some word in ''L'', whose length is greater than ''n'', ''and'' which is a prefix of ''w''. The limit operation on ''L'' can be written ''L''&lt;sup&gt;δ&lt;/sup&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\vec{L}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Distance between &amp;omega;-words==

The set Σ&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; can be made into a [[metric space]] by definition of the [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] d:Σ&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; × Σ&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R''' as:

: d(''w'',''v'')= inf {2&lt;sup&gt;−|''x''|&lt;/sup&gt; : ''x'' in &amp;Sigma;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''x'' in both Pref(''w'') and Pref(''v'') }.

where |''x''| is interpreted as "the length of ''x''" (number of symbols in ''x''), and '''inf''' is the [[infimum]] over sets of [[real number]]s. If ''w''=''v'', they have no longest finite prefix, and d(''w'',''v'')=0; it can be shown that d satisfies all the other necessary properties of a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]].

==Important subclasses==
The most widely used subclass of the ω-languages is the set of [[omega-regular language|&amp;omega;-regular languages]], which enjoy the useful property of being recognizable by [[Büchi automaton|Büchi automata]]; thus the [[decision problem]] of ω-regular language membership is decidable using a Büchi automaton and fairly straightforward to compute.

The first pastebin was the eponymous [[pastebin.com]]. Other sites with the same functionality have appeared, and several [[Open-source model|open-source]] pastebin scripts are available. Pastebins may allow commenting where readers can post feedback directly on the page. [[GitHub]] Gists are a type of pastebin with [[version control]].

==History==
Pastebins developed in the late 1990s to facilitate IRC chatrooms devoted to [[computing]],{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} where users naturally needed to share large blocks of computer input or output in a line-oriented medium. On such IRC channels, where the formatting clues are subtle and several conversations can be closely interleaved, blocks of computer data flood the queue, disrupting the intricate flow. Users are often warned to instead use pastebins, or risk being banned from the service in the event of disruption. A reference to a pastebin entry, however, is a one-line hyperlink.

A new class of [[IRC bot]] has evolved. In a chatroom that is largely oriented around a few pastebins, nothing more needs to be done after a post at its pastebin. The receiving party then awaits a [[IRC bot|bot]] to announce the expected posting by the known user.

After the use of the pastebin.com pastebin  for a [[data breach]], Pastebin started monitoring the site for illegally pasted data and information, leading to a backlash from [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. Hacktivists teamed up with an organization calling itself the People's Liberation Front, launching an alternative called AnonPaste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/pastebin-to-hunt-for-hacker-pastes-anonymous-cries-censorship/|title=Pastebin to hunt for hacker pastes, Anonymous cries censorship|last=Emil|first=Protalinski|date=4 April 2012|website=[[ZDNet]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205153321/http://www.zdnet.com/article/pastebin-to-hunt-for-hacker-pastes-anonymous-cries-censorship/|archive-date=5 February 2015|dead-url=no|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/01/07/morgan-stanley-data-leak-not-the-first-headache-for-pastebin/|title=Morgan Stanley Data Leak Not the First Headache for Pastebin|last=Sidel|first=Robin|date=7 January 2015|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109181906/http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/01/07/morgan-stanley-data-leak-not-the-first-headache-for-pastebin/|archivedate=9 November 2016|deadurl=no|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phạm Thị Hoài''' (born 1960) is an influential contemporary [[Vietnam]]ese [[writer]], [[editing|editor]] and [[translator]], living in [[Germany]].

== Biography ==
Born in [[Hải Dương]] province, Phạm Thị Hoài grew up in [[North Vietnam]]. In 1977, she went to former [[East Berlin]] to study at [[Humboldt University]], where she earned a degree in Archival Studies. Returning to Vietnam in 1983, she lived in [[Hanoi]] where she worked as an archivist and began to write seriously.

Her first novel, ''Thiên sứ'' (''The Heavenly Messenger'' and ''The Crystal Messenger'', {{ISBN|1875657711}}), was published in Hanoi in 1988, and was subsequently banned by the Vietnamese government. ''Thiên sứ'' has since been translated into English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Finnish. In 1993, the German translation was awarded the annual [[Frankfurt LiBeraturpreis]], awarded for the best foreign novel published in Germany and the English the [[Dinny O'Hearn Prize]] for Literary Translation in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the Afterword to his translation of ''The Crystal Messenger'' Ton-That Quynh-Du writes of Phạm Thị Hoài:

:In Vietnam her writing drew enthusiastic acclaim from readers and literary critics. Her detractors were just as vocal. Vietnam’s cultural bureaucrats objected to her critical views of contemporary Vietnam, and were offended by her lack of respect for traditions and disregard of social taboos […] Despite having been attacked in a public forum, Pham Thi Hoai has never been accused of political dissent. Instead, her detractors have charged her with holding an ‘excessively pessimistic view’ of Vietnam, of abusing the ‘sacred mission of a writer,’ and even of ‘salacious’ writing. But even her strongest critics acknowledge that she is a writer with a keen eye for detail, a humorous, acerbic wit, and a fine ear for the rhythms of the Vietnamese language.&lt;ref&gt;Ton-That Quynh-Du, “Afterword” in {{cite book

In addition to the internationally acclaimed ''Thiên sứ'', Phạm Thị Hoài has also published essays, two collections of short stories, ''Mê Lộ'' (1989) and ''Man Nương'' (1995), and another novel ''Marie Sến'' (1996). She is a noted translator of [[German literature]] and has translated works by [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], [[Bert Brecht]], [[Thomas Bernhard]], and [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]] into Vietnamese. She is also the editor of ''Trần Dần – Ghi: 1954-1960'' ([[Paris]]: TD Mémoire, 2001), a collection of Trần Dần's journal entries.

It is most commonly employed in situations such as [[trade]], or where both groups speak languages different from the language of the country in which they reside (but where there is no common language between the groups). Fundamentally, a pidgin is a simplified means of linguistic communication, as it is constructed impromptu, or by convention, between individuals or groups of people. A pidgin is not the native language of any speech community, but is instead learned as a second language.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvcoltxt|Todd|1990|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pidgin may be built from words, sounds, or body language from a multitude of languages as well as [[onomatopoeia]]. As the [[lexicon]] of any pidgin will be limited to core vocabulary, words with only a specific meaning in [[lexifier]] language may acquire a completely new (or additional) meaning in the pidgin.

Pidgins have historically been considered a form of ''[[patois]]'', unsophisticated simplified versions of their lexifiers, and as such usually have low [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] with respect to other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bakker|1994|p= 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all simplified or "unsophisticated" forms of a language are pidgins. Each pidgin has its own norms of usage which must be learned for proficiency in the pidgin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bakker|1994|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pidgin differs from a [[creole language|creole]], which is the [[first language]] of a speech community of [[native speaker]]s that at one point arose from a pidgin. Unlike pidgins, creoles have fully developed vocabulary and patterned grammar. Most linguists believe that a creole develops through a process of [[nativization]] of a pidgin when children of acquired pidgin-speakers learn and use it as their native language.

== Etymology ==
''Pidgin'' derives from a [[Chinese Language|Chinese]] pronunciation of the English word ''business'', and all attestations from the first half of the nineteenth century given in the third edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' mean 'business; an action, occupation, or affair' (the earliest being from 1807). The term ''pidgin English'' ("business English"), first attested in 1855, shows the term in transition to referring to language, and by the 1860s the term ''pidgin'' alone could refer to Pidgin English. The term was coming to be used in the more general linguistic sense represented by this article by the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;"pidgin, n." ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, January 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/143533. Accessed 23 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=etymonline&gt;{{Citation | title = Online Etymology Dictionary | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pidgin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular [[folk-etymology]] for ''pidgin'' is English ''[[pigeon]]'', a bird sometimes used for [[messenger pigeon|carrying brief written messages]], especially in times prior to modern telecommunications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Crystal |first=David |author-link=David Crystal |contribution=Pidgin |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"pidgin, n." ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, January 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/143533. Accessed 23 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
The word ''pidgin'', formerly also spelled ''pigion'',&lt;ref name="etymonline"/&gt; used to refer originally to [[Chinese Pidgin English]], but was later generalized to refer to any pidgin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bakker|1994|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pidgin'' may also be used as the specific name for local pidgins or [[Creole language|creoles]], in places where they are spoken. For example, the name of the creole language [[Tok Pisin]] derives from the English words ''talk pidgin''. Its speakers usually refer to it simply as "pidgin" when speaking English.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Geoff P. ''Growing Up with Tok Pisin: Contact, creolization, and change in Papua New Guinea's national language''. London: Battlebridge. 2002. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thus the published court reports of Papua New Guinea refer to Tok Pisin as "Pidgin": see for example ''Schubert v The State'' [1979] PNGLR 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Hawaiian Creole English]] is commonly referred to by its speakers as "Pidgin".

The term ''jargon'' has also been used to refer to pidgins, and is found in the names of some pidgins, such as [[Chinook Jargon]]. In this context, linguists today use ''jargon'' to denote a particularly rudimentary type of pidgin;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bakker|1994|pp25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this usage is rather rare, and the term ''[[jargon]]'' most often refers to the words particular to a given profession.

Pidgins may start out as or become trade languages, such as [[Tok Pisin]]. Trade languages can eventually evolve into fully developed languages in their own right such as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], distinct from the languages they were originally influenced by. Trade languages and pidgins can also influence an established language's [[vernacular]], especially amongst people who are directly involved in a trade where that pidgin is commonly used, which can alternatively result in a [[regional dialect]] being developed.

== Common traits ==
Pidgins are usually less morphologically complex but more syntactically rigid than other languages, usually have fewer morphosyntactic irregularities than other languages. 

Characteristics shared by most pidgins:

* Typologically most closely resemble [[isolating languages]]
* Uncomplicated [[clause|clausal]] structure (e.g., no [[subordinate clause|embedded]] clauses, etc.)
* Reduction or elimination of [[syllable coda]]s
* Reduction of consonant clusters or breaking them with [[epenthesis]]
* Elimination of [[Aspiration (linguistics)|aspiration]] or [[sound changes]]
* [[Monophthongization]] is common, employment of as few basic vowels as possible, such as {{IPA|[a, e, i, o, u]}}
* Lack of [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic variation]]
* Lack of [[tone (linguistics)|tones]], such as those found in West African, Asian and many North American Indigenous languages
* Lack of [[grammatical tense]]; use of separate words to indicate tense, usually preceding the [[verb]]
* Lack of [[Conjugation (grammar)|conjugation]] or [[declension]]
* Use of [[reduplication]] to represent [[plurals]], [[superlatives]], and other parts of speech that represent the concept being increased

== Development ==
The initial development of a pidgin usually requires:

* prolonged, regular contact between the different language communities
* a need to communicate between them
* an absence of (or absence of widespread proficiency in) a widespread, accessible [[interlanguage]]

Keith Whinnom (in {{Harvcoltxt|Hymes|1971}}) suggests that pidgins need three languages to form, with one (the superstrate) being clearly dominant over the others.

Linguists sometimes posit that pidgins can become [[creole language]]s when a generation of children learn a pidgin as their first language,&lt;ref&gt;

| quote            = [...] the children of pidgin-speaking parents face a big problem, because pidgins are so rudimentary and inexpressive, poorly capable of expressing the nuances of a full range of human emotions and life situations. The first generation of such children spontaneously develops a pidgin into a more complex language termed a creole. [...] [T]he evolution of a pidgin into a creole is unconscious and spontaneous.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
a process that regularizes speaker-dependent variation in grammar. Creoles can then replace the existing mix of languages to become the native language of a community (such as the [[Chavacano language]] in the [[Philippines]], [[Sierra Leone Krio language|Krio]] in [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Tok Pisin]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]). However, not all pidgins become creole languages; a pidgin may die out before this phase would occur (e.g. the [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]]).

Other scholars, such as [[Salikoko Mufwene]], argue that pidgins and creoles arise independently under different circumstances, and that a pidgin need not always precede a creole nor a creole evolve from a pidgin. Pidgins, according to Mufwene, emerged among trade colonies among "users who preserved their native vernaculars for their day-to-day interactions". Creoles, meanwhile, developed in settlement colonies in which speakers of a European language, often [[indentured servants]] whose language would be far from the standard in the first place, interacted extensively with non-European [[slave]]s, absorbing certain words and features from the slaves' non-European native languages, resulting in a heavily [[basilect]]alized version of the original language. These servants and slaves would come to use the creole as an everyday vernacular, rather than merely in situations in which contact with a speaker of the superstrate was necessary.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Brazil|Federative Republic of Brazil]] has seen limited discussion among authorities regarding its potential as a superpower.

Writing for ''[[The Diplomatic Courier]]'', former British Ambassador to Brazil, Peter Collecott, identifies that Brazil's recognition as a potential superpower largely stems from its own national identity and ambition. Collecott points out that for the past two hundred years Brazil has sought to emerge as a serious global economic and political power, a position "that [Brazil] instinctively feels is her due."&lt;ref name="Collecott"&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Collecott|url=http://www.diplomaticourier.com/2011/10/29/brazil-s-quest-for-superpower-status/|title=Brazil's Quest for Superpower Status|publisher=The Diplomatic Courier|date=29 October 2011|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Collecott also argues that while Brazil has certainly fulfilled some of its aspirations and finally started to gain the international recognition it deserves, it perhaps won't quite emerge as a superpower; instead, its current position as an [[emerging power]] will allow Brazil to shape the future with more realistic aspirations.&lt;ref name="Collecott"/&gt;

In his 2014 publication, ''The BRICs Superpower Challenge: Foreign and Security Policy Analysis'', professor Kwang Ho Chun carefully assesses the likelihood of the BRICs countries attaining the status of superpowers.&lt;ref name="Kwang Ho Chun"/&gt; Regarding Brazil, Kwang Ho Chun highlights that the country possesses enormous and almost untouched "strategic" natural resources, including valuable [[mineral|minerals]], a tenth of the world's [[fresh water]] and Earth's largest remaining [[rainforest]]. Because of this, Kwang Ho Chun feels it is likely that Brazil could gain a dominant role in international relations, especially when it comes to environmental issues.&lt;ref name="Kwang Ho Chun"/&gt; This [[soft power]] influence is further enhanced by Brazil's policy makers seeking to engage in as many [[international organization|international organizations]] as possible and forming alliances, most notably on social, diplomatic and economic issues.&lt;ref name="Kwang Ho Chun"/&gt; Despite its economic potential and Brazil's "self-image as a country with a great destiny," Kwang Ho Chun believes that the country "falls far short of the levels required for a superpower."&lt;ref name="Kwang Ho Chun"/&gt; Supporting his belief, he emphasizes Brazil's apparent lack of "traditional [[hard power]]" (i.e. military power and global security influence) as a major obstacle. Kwang Ho Chun writes that Brazil has "little incentive to invest in its military" as "the country developed in an environment with hardly any inter-state security threats", therefore Brazil "may never be in a position to accumulate enough influence on global security matters to meet the criteria of being a superpower."&lt;ref name="Kwang Ho Chun"/&gt; Instead, Ho Chun feels that Brazil will emerge as a [[great power]] with an important position in some spheres of influence but limited in others such as international security.&lt;ref name="Kwang Ho Chun"/&gt;

[[Barry Buzan]] asserted in 2004 that "China certainly presents the most promising all-round profile" of a potential superpower.&lt;ref name="The United States and the Great Powers"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buzan|first=Barry|title=The United States and the Great Powers|publisher=Polity Press|year=2004|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|page=70|isbn=0-7456-3375-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buzan claimed that "China is currently the most fashionable potential superpower and the one whose degree of alienation from the dominant international society makes it the most obvious political challenger." However, he noted this challenge is constrained by the major challenges of development and by the fact that its rise could trigger a counter coalition of states in [[Asia]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[Parag Khanna]] stated in 2008 that by making massive trade and investment deals with Latin America and Africa, China had established its presence as a superpower along with the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]]. China's rise is demonstrated by its ballooning share of trade in its [[gross domestic product]]. He believed that China's "consultative style" had allowed it to develop political and economic ties with many countries including those viewed as [[rogue state]]s by the United States. He stated that the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]] founded with Russia and the Central Asian countries may eventually be the "[[NATO]] of the East".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/magazine/27world-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|last=Khanna|first=Parag|title=Waving Goodbye to Hegemony|accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist and author of ''Eclipse: Living in the Shadow of China's Economic Dominance'' [[Arvind Subramanian]] argued in 2012 that China will direct the world's financial system by 2020 and that the Chinese [[renminbi]] will replace the [[United States dollar|dollar]] as the world's [[reserve currency]] in 10 to 15 years. The United States' [[soft power]] will remain longer. He stated that "China was a top dog economically for thousands of years prior to the [[Ming dynasty]]. In some ways, the past few hundred years have been an aberration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ted Greenwald&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; |url=https://www.wired.com/2012/02/st_subramanianqa/ |title=Taming the Dragon: One Scholar's Plan to Soften Chinese Dominance &amp;#124; Magazine |publisher=WIRED |date=February 28, 2012|accessdate=June 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence Saez at the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies]], London, argued in 2011 that the United States will be surpassed by China as military superpower within twenty years. Regarding economic power, the Director of the China Center for Economic Reform at [[Peking University]] Yao Yang stated that "Assuming that the Chinese and U.S. economies grow, respectively, by 8% and 3% in real terms, that China's inflation rate is 3.6% and America's is 2% (the averages of the last decade), and that the renminbi appreciates against the dollar by 3% per year (the average of the last six years), China will become the world's largest economy by 2021. By that time, both countries' GDP will be about $24 trillion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thair Shaikh |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311061413/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-06-10/world/china.military.superpower_1_superpower-military-spending-military-dominance/2?_s=PM%3AWORLD |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-06-10/world/china.military.superpower_1_superpower-military-spending-military-dominance/2?_s=PM:WORLD |title=When Will China Become a Global Superpower? |publisher=CNN |date=10 June 2011 |archivedate=11 March 2012 |accessdate=28 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Timothy Garton Ash]] argued in 2011, pointing to factors such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] predicting that China's GDP ([[purchasing power parity]] adjusted) will overtake that of the United States in 2016, that a power shift to a world with several superpowers was happening "Now". However, China was still lacking in soft power and power projection abilities and had a low [[Per capita income|GDP/person]]. The article also stated that the [[Pew Research Center]] in a 2009 survey found that people in 15 out of 22 countries believed that China had or would overtake the US as the world's leading superpower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.caixin.com/2012-02-27/100360946.html|publisher=[[Caixin]]|title=Oxford Prof on China and the New World OrderPart 1|date=27 February 2012|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview given in 2011, Singapore's first premier, [[Lee Kuan Yew]], stated that while China supplanting the United States is not a foregone conclusion, Chinese leaders are nonetheless serious about displacing the United States as the most powerful country in Asia. "They have transformed a poor society by an economic miracle to become now the second-largest economy in the world. How could they not aspire to be number 1 in Asia, and in time the world?"&lt;ref name="LeeAllison2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kuan Yew Lee|author2=Graham Allison|author3=Robert D.

Chinese foreign policy adviser [[Wang Jisi]] in 2012 stated that many Chinese officials see China as a first-class power which should be treated as such. China is argued to soon become the world's largest economy and to be making rapid progress in many areas. The United States is seen as a declining superpower as indicated by factors such as poor economic recovery, financial disorder, high deficits gaining close to GDP levels and unemployment, increasing political polarization, and overregulation forcing jobs overseas in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epi.org/publication/counting_the_jobs_lost_to_china/|title=Counting the jobs lost to China|work=Economic Policy Institute|date=31 March 2010|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Kenneth Lieberthal|author2=Wang Jisi|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/us-china-experts-warn-of-growing-bilateral-distrust-145900615/179594.html|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|title=US, China Experts Warn of Growing Bilateral Distrust|date=2 April 2012|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2012/3/30-us-china-lieberthal/0330_china_lieberthal.pdf|publisher=China Center at Brookings|title=Addressing U.S.-China Strategic Distrust|date=March 2012|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timothy Beardson, founder of Crosby International Holdings, stated in 2013 that he doesn't see "China becoming a superpower". He writes that China has basically worked as a manufacturing location for foreign companies, as 83% of all high-tech products made in China were produced for foreign companies.&lt;ref name="articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-06-28/news/40234296_1_challenges-facing-china-foreign-companies-china-20-years | work=The Times Of India | title=I don't see China becoming a superpower in this century|last=Beardson|first=Timothy| date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that China has problems regarding wages, an aging and declining population, and gender imbalance (with China's 6:5 gender ratio, 1 in 6 males will be unable to find a female partner), and he suggested that such problems would lead to crime. He also pointed out that China continually polluted its environment during its 30 years of economic growth.&lt;ref name="articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Timothy Beardson|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/timothy-beardson/china-pollution_b_3331929.html|title=Action Needed on the Environment|work=Huffington Post|date=24 May 2013|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoffrey Murray's ''China: The Next Superpower'' (1998) argued that while the potential for China is high, this is fairly perceived only by looking at the risks and obstacles China faces in managing its population and resources. The political situation in China may become too fragile to survive into superpower status, according to [[Susan Shirk]] in ''China: Fragile Superpower'' (2008). Other factors that could constrain China's ability to become a superpower in the future include limited supplies of energy and raw materials, questions over its innovation capability, inequality and corruption, and risks to social stability and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Shirk|date=2008|title=China: Fragile Superpower|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-537319-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minxin Pei]] argued in 2010 that China is not a superpower and it will not be one anytime soon and argued that China faces daunting political and economic challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Minxin Pei|url=http://apac2020.thediplomat.com/feature/china%E2%80%99s-not-a-superpower/|title=China's Not a Superpower|publisher=The Diplomat|date=20 January 2010|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 he argued that China, despite using its economic power to influence some nations, has few real friends or allies and is surrounded by potentially hostile nations. This situation could improve if regional territorial disputes were resolved and China participated in an effective regional defense system that would reduce the fears of its neighbors. Alternatively, a democratization of China would dramatically improve foreign relations with many nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Minxin Pei|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/03/20/the-loneliest-superpower/|title=The Loneliest Superpower|publisher=Foreign Policy|date=20 March 2012|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amy Chua]] stated in 2007 that whether a country is attractive to immigrants is an important quality for a superpower. She also wrote that China lacks the pull to bring scientists, thinkers, and innovators from other countries as immigrants.&lt;ref name="Chua, A 2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amy Chua|year=2007|title=Day of Empire: How Hyperpowers Rise to Global Dominance – and Why They Fall|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-385-51284-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These prognoses, however, all predate the [[euro crisis]] and [[ Brexit]]. See; [[Political midlife crisis]].

Mark Leonard cites several factors: the EU's large population, large economy, low inflation rates, the unpopularity and perceived failure of US foreign policy in recent years, and certain EU member states' high quality of life (especially when measured in terms such as hours worked per week, health care, social services).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cer.org.uk/in-the-press/europe-new-superpower|title=Europe: the new superpower|publisher=CER|date=18 February 2005|accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John McCormick (political scientist)|John McCormick]] believes that the EU has already achieved superpower status, based on the size and global reach of its economy and on its global political influence. He argues that the nature of power has changed since the [[Cold War]]-driven definition of superpower was developed, and that military power is no longer essential to great power; he argues that control of the means of production is more important than control of the means of destruction, and contrasts the threatening [[hard power]] of the United States with the opportunities offered by the [[soft power]] wielded by the European Union.&lt;ref name="The European Superpower"&gt;{{cite book|author=John McCormick|title=The European Superpower|isbn=978-1-4039-9846-0|date=14 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, the EU as a whole has some of the world's largest and most influential languages being official within its borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nocturne.ca/nn-worldlanguages.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302063751/http://www.nocturne.ca/nn-worldlanguages.htm|archivedate=2 March 2010|title=Languages of the world|work=Nocturne|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Reding also takes the [[Future enlargement of the European Union|future EU enlargement]] into account. An eventual future accession of the rest of [[Europe]], the whole of [[Russia]], and [[Turkey]], would not only boost [[Economy of the European Union|its economy]], but it would also increase the EU's population to about 800 million, which he considers almost equal to that of [[India]] or [[China]]. The EU is qualitatively different from India and China since it is enormously more prosperous and technologically advanced.&lt;ref name="A. R." /&gt; Turkish PM [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] said in 2005: "In 10 or 15 years, the EU will be a place where civilizations meet. It will be a superpower with the inclusion of Turkey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/2005/06/04/news/-eu-will-be-super-power-with-turkey/|publisher=Turkish Weekly|title='EU will be Super Power with Turkey'|date=4 June 2005|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert J. Guttman wrote in 2001 that the very definition of the term superpower has changed, and in the 21st century it does not only refer to states with military power, but also to groups such as the European Union, with strong market economics, young, highly educated workers savvy in high technology, and a global vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbi7eVIcyD4C&amp;dq=Europe+emerging+superpower&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QxLIyJCn7Q&amp;sig=MVdQdAbG6-3ee0A5-UjCEbNNpEE&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=wBgUSuf7CJmv-AbooqioDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#PPP1,M1|title=Europe in the New Century: Visions of an Emerging Superpower|publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]]|year=2001|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friis Arne Petersen, the [[Denmark|Danish]] ambassador to the US, has expressed similar views but has conceded that the EU is a "special kind of superpower", one that has yet to establish a unified military force that exerts itself even close to the same level as many of its individual members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Trevor Williams|url=http://www.globalatlanta.com/danish-envoy-economic-strength-makes-eu-a-rising-superpower/|title=Danish Envoy: Economic Strength Makes EU a 'Rising Superpower'|work=Globalatlanta|date=29 October 2008|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it is argued by commentators that full political integration is not required for the European Union to wield international influence: that its apparent weaknesses constitute its real strengths (as of its low-profile diplomacy and the emphasis on the rule of law)&lt;ref name="The European Superpower"/&gt; and that the EU represents a new and potentially more successful type of international actor than traditional ones;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|author=Adrian Hyde-Price|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326212441/http://www.arena.uio.no/cidel/WorkshopOsloSecurity/Hyde-Price.pdf|archivedate=26 March 2009|date=23 October 2004|url=http://www.arena.uio.no/cidel/WorkshopOsloSecurity/Hyde-Price.pdf|title=The EU, Power and Coercion: From 'Civilian' to 'Civilising' Power|publisher=ARENA Centre for European Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it is uncertain if the effectiveness of such an influence would be equal to that of a more politically integrated union of states such as the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2005/02/10/europe-vs-america/|title=Europe vs. America by Tony Judt|publisher=The New York Review of Books|date=10 February 2005|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry Buzan notes that the EU's potential superpower status depends on its "stateness". It is unclear though how much state-like quality is needed for the EU to be described as a superpower. Buzan states that the EU is unlikely to remain a potential superpower for a long time because although it has material wealth, its "political weakness and its erratic and difficult course of internal political development, particularly as regards a common foreign and defence policy" constrains it from being a superpower.&lt;ref name="The United States and the Great Powers" /&gt;

[[Alexander Stubb]], the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)|foreign minister]], has said that he thinks the EU is both a superpower and not a superpower. While the EU is a superpower in the sense that it is the largest [[political union]], [[single market]] and aid donor in the world, it is not a superpower in the defense or foreign policy spheres. Like Barry Buzan, Alexander Stubb thinks that the major factor constraining the EU's rise to superpower status is its lack of statehood in the international system; other factors are its lack of internal drive to project power worldwide, and continued preference for the sovereign nation-state among some Europeans. To counterbalance these, he urged the EU leaders to approve and ratify the [[Lisbon Treaty]] (which they did in 2009), create an EU foreign ministry ([[European External Action Service|EEAS]], established in 2010), develop a [[Military of the European Union|common EU defense]], hold one collective seat at the [[United Nations Security Council]] and [[G8 (forum)|G8]], and address what he described as the "sour mood" toward the EU prevalent in some European countries today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/files/0717carnegie-stubb.pdf|publisher=Carnegie Endowment|title=Will the EU Ever Become a Superpower?|format=PDF|date=17 July 2008|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contrary views ===
Some commentators do not believe that the EU will achieve superpower status. "The EU is not and never will be a superpower", according to the former UK [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] [[David Miliband]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gees.org/documentos/Documen-02639.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726024647/http://www.gees.org/documentos/Documen-02639.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-26|title=(FCO) Europe 2030: Model power not Superpower - Bruges Speech by the Rt Hon David Miliband MP Foreign Secretary|format=PDF|date=15 November 2007|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking a unified foreign policy and with an inability to project military power worldwide, the EU lacks "the substance of superpowers", who by definition have "first of all military reach [and] possess the capacity to arrive quickly anywhere with troops that can impose their government's will."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Amotz Asa-El|author-link=Amotz Asa-El|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1226404727902|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081117034827/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1226404727902&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull|archivedate=17 November 2008|title=Middle Israel: Barack Obama and the decline of America|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=13 November 2008|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; EU parliamentarian Ilka Schroeder argues that the high degree of involvement in conflicts such as the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] is used by the EU largely to compensate for European inability to project military power internationally, particularly in contrast to the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Julie Stahl|url=http://www.crosswalk.com/1238927/|title=Europe Wants to Rival US as Military Superpower, Says EU Parliamentarian|publisher=Crosswalk.com|date=2 January 2004|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'''s [[Robert Lane Greene]] notes that the lack of a strong European military only exacerbates the lack of unified EU foreign policy and discounts any EU arguments towards superpower status, noting especially that the EU's creation of a global response force rivaling the superpower's (United States) is "unthinkable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Lane Greene|url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/173-sovereign/30500.html|title=EU Constitution: A 'Superpower Europe' It Won't Be|publisher=Globalpolicy.org|date=18 July 2003|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Colin S. Gray]] finds that “EU-Europe remains a political pygmy and all but military zero in any collective sense.”&lt;ref&gt;Colin S. Gray, "Document No. 1: The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), 2006, and the Perils of the Twenty-First Century," ''Comparative Strategy'', 25/2, (2006): p 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], the European Union did not produce a real "union" but a "misnomer." It failed to use the years of “Europe whole and free” to make Europe truly whole and its freedom firmly secure. The notion of Europe as “a political and military heavyweight" became "increasingly illusory.” Europe, once the center of the West, became an extension of a West whose defining player is America.&lt;ref&gt;Zbigniew Brzezinski, ''Strategic Vision: America and the Crisis of Global Power'', (New York: Basic Books, 2012), p 22, 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Osborne]], former British [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], has also pointed out the economic crisis of the European Union. Osborne said, "The biggest economic risk facing Europe doesn't come from those who want reform and re-negotiation. It comes from a failure to reform and renegotiate. It is the status quo which condemns the people of Europe to an ongoing economic crisis and continuing decline." Osborne also said that the EU is facing growing competition with global economic powers like China, India and the US, and the European Union should "reform or decline."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Kirkup|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/10572725/George-Osborne-lectures-the-EU-on-reform.html|title=George Osborne lectures the EU on reform|publisher=Telegraph|date=14 Jan 2014|accessdate=17 March 2014|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/EU-falling-behind-India-China-British-finance-minister/articleshow/28839348.cms|title=EU falling behind India, China: British finance minister|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date=15 January 2014|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Osborn|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-osborne-idUSBREA0F05020140116#lYdgZKhqtUbbQehB.97|title=Reform or lose us as member, Britain's finance minister tells EU|publisher=Reuters|date=15 January 2014|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anil Kumar Gupta|Anil Gupta]] is almost certain that India will become a superpower in the 21st century. As an example, he states that due to India's functional institutions of democracy and its relatively [[corruption]]-free society, it will emerge as a desirable, entrepreneurial and resource and energy-efficient superpower in the near future. He had predicted that by 2015 India would overtake China to be the fastest growing economy in the world and predicts an emergence as a full-fledged economic superpower by 2025. In addition to that, he states, India has the potential to serve as a leading example of how to combine rapid economic growth with fairness towards and inclusion of those at the bottom rungs of the ladder and of efficient resource utilization, especially in energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-01-09/news/29382860_1_third-largest-economy-superpower-india-s-gdp |title=India 2025: What kind of superpower? |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=2011-01-09 |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; India became the world's fastest growing economy in 2015 and will continue to do so in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India to beat China again as fastest-growing economy in 2016: IMF|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-07-09/news/64243978_1_growth-projection-world-economic-outlook-update-fastest-growing-economy|accessdate=20 November 2015|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robyn Meredith points out that the average incomes of European and Americans are higher than Chinese and Indians, and hundreds of millions of Chinese as well as Indians live in poverty, she also suggested that economic growth of these nations has been the most important factor in reducing global poverty of the last two decades, as per the World Bank report.&lt;ref name="elephantdragon"/&gt; [[Amy Chua]] adds to this, that India still faces many problems such as "pervasive rural poverty, entrenched [[Corruption in India|corruption]], and high [[Economic inequality|inequality]] just to name a few". However, she notes that India has made tremendous strides to fix this, stating that some of India's achievements, such as working to dismantle the centuries-old [[Caste|caste system]] and maintaining the world's largest diverse democracy, are historically unprecedented.&lt;ref name="Chua, A 2007"/&gt;

[[Fareed Zakaria]] pointing out that India's young population coupled with the [[List of countries by English-speaking population|second-largest]] [[English language|English]]-speaking population in the world could give India an advantage over China. He also believes that while other industrial countries will face a youth gap, India will have lots of young people, or in other words, workers, and by 2050, its per capita income will rise by twenty times its current level. According to Zakaria, another strength that India has is that its democratic government has lasted for 60 years, stating that a democracy can provide for long-term stability, which has given India a name.&lt;ref&gt;Zakaria, F.

[[Lant Pritchett]], reviewing the book ''In Spite of the Gods: The Strange Rise of Modern India'', writes that, while India has had impressive growth and has some world-class institutions, several other indicators are puzzlingly poor. The [[malnutrition in India|malnutrition]] and the coverage of [[immunization]] programs are at levels similar or worse than in many sub-Saharan African nations. In the [[Demographic and Health Surveys]], India's child malnutrition was the worst of the 42 nations with comparable and recent data.&lt;ref name="doi10.1257/jel.47.3.771"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pritchett | first1 = L. | title = A Review of Edward Luce'sIn Spite of the Gods: The Strange Rise of Modern India | doi = 10.1257/jel.47.3.771 | journal = Journal of Economic Literature | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 771–081 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult [[literacy]] is 61%. In one study, 26% of teachers were absent from work and 1/3 of those showing up did not teach. 40% of health care workers were absent from work. [[Caste politics in India]] remains an important force. Pritchett argues that a very large population, a very long statistical "tail" of high quality students, and some very good higher education institutions gives a misleading impression of Indian education. Indian students placed forty-first and thirty-seventh in a study comparing students in the two Indian states [[Odisha]] and [[Rajasthan]] to the forty-six nations in the 2003 [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study]].&lt;ref name="doi10.1257/jel.47.3.771"/&gt;

First, [[New Delhi]]'s foreign policy decisions are highly individualistic.&lt;ref name="FA Miller 14"/&gt; "This autonomy, in turn, means that New Delhi does very little collective thinking about its long-term foreign policy goals, since most of the strategic planning that takes place within the government happens on an individual level."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Manjari Chatterjee|title=India's Feeble Foreign Policy|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=May–June 2013|volume= 92|issue= 3|page=15|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/india/2013-04-03/indias-feeble-foreign-policy|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, a dearth of [[think tank]]s helps insulate Indian foreign policymakers from outside influences.&lt;ref name="FA Miller 14"/&gt; "U.S. foreign policymakers, by contrast, can expect strategic guidance from a broad spectrum of organizations that supplement the long-term planning that happens within the government itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Miller| first=Manjari Chatterjee| title=India's Feeble Foreign Policy| journal=Foreign Affairs| date=May–June 2013| volume= 92| issue= 3| page=17| url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/india/2013-04-03/indias-feeble-foreign-policy| accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, many of India's political elites believe that the country's inevitable rise is a [[Western world|Western]] construct that has placed unrealistic expectations on India's economic growth forecasts and its international commitments.&lt;ref name="FA Miller 14"/&gt; By contrast, Miller notes that Chinese political leaders pay very close attention to the international hype surrounding their country's growing stature.&lt;ref name="FA Miller 14"/&gt; Miller concludes that "India's inability to develop top-down, long-term strategies means that it cannot systematically consider the implications of its growing power.

''[[Forbes]]'' writer Jonathan Adelman has summarized the arguments against Russia's superpower potential thus: "While Russia may have grabbed the headlines for hosting the forthcoming [[2014 Winter Olympics|Olympics]] and [[Edward Snowden]], it's no super power.

In radio broadcasting, '''quasi-synchronous transmission''' is a method of achieving wider area coverage using multiple transmitters but without needing multiple frequencies. It became technically feasible in the mid 1970s, but was rapidly superseded by [[cellular network]]s in the early 1980s, so it is rarely found today. It was invented by engineer J. T. Murasko of UK [[radiotelephone]] manufacturer Dymar Electronics.

The principle of operation is to precisely control the transmission frequency so accurately that interference between adjacent transmitters is kept under control, with a [[beat frequency]] of about 10-15 [[hertz]] only. While this creates some audible affects in the receiver in the overlap region, it is usually tolerable and doesn't affect the intelligibility of the signal. [[Narrowband]] [[Frequency modulation]] is used exclusively, so that the [[capture effect]] will select the stronger of two transmitters wherever one predominates. While frequency control down to 1-2 hertz accuracy is achievable, this is undesirable, since the cancellation of signals would wipe out the signal at the receiver for up to a second. The deliberate offset prevents this at the expense of a "motorboating" effect.

Transmitters use highly stable [[crystal oven]]s as their primary oscillator and [[frequency synthesiser]]s to generate multiple channels from this.

'''Samoan Sign Language''' is the [[deaf sign language]] of [[Samoa]].

"A lot of" Samoan Sign Language is based on [[Australian Sign Language]], though there are local signs for Samoan food.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/australianetwork/nexus/stories/s2049605.htm Monologue by Donna Lene] on Nexus&lt;/ref&gt;  It's not clear if this means Samoan Sign Language is related to Australian Sign Language, or if it merely has lots of loanwords from Australian Sign Language.

A short dictionary has been compiled for Samoan Sign Language, and evidently a separate dictionary has been compiled for American Samoan Sign Language.&lt;ref&gt;Don Cabbage &amp; John Peterson, 1990, ''Samoan Sign Language,'' vol. 1. International Communication Publishers. 166 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don Cabbage &amp; John Peterson, 1990, ''American Samoa Sign Language,'' vol. 1. International Communication Publishers. 168 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;  "American Samoan Sign Language" may just be [[American Sign Language]] as used in American Samoa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libguides.gallaudet.edu/content.php?pid=114804&amp;sid=997863]&lt;/ref&gt;

In computer [[metadata]], '''semantic equivalence''' is a declaration that two [[data element]]s from different vocabularies contain data that has similar meaning.  There are three types of semantic equivalence statements:

* '''[[Class (computer science)|Class]] or [[concept]] equivalence.'''  A statement that two high level concepts have similar or equivalent meaning.
* '''[[Property (philosophy)|Property]] or [[Attribute (computing)|attribute]] equivalence.'''  A statement that two properties, descriptors or attributes of classes have similar meaning.
* '''[[Object (computer science)|Instance]] equivalence.'''  A statement that two instances of data are the same or refer to the same instance.

==Example==

Assume that there are two organizations, each having a separate data dictionary.  The first organization has a data element entry:

  &lt;DataElement&gt;
     &lt;Name&gt;'''PersonFamilyName'''&lt;/Name&gt;
     &lt;Definition&gt;'''The name of a person shared with other members of their family.'''&lt;/Definition&gt;
  &lt;DataElement&gt;

and a second organization has a data dictionary with a data element with the following entry:

  &lt;DataElement&gt;
     &lt;Name&gt;'''IndividualLastName'''&lt;/Name&gt;
     &lt;Definition&gt;'''The name of an individual person shared with other members of their family.'''&lt;/Definition&gt;
  &lt;DataElement&gt;

these two data elements can be considered to have the same meaning and can be marked as semantically equivalent.

[[File:Dan Quayle crop.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Dan Quayle]]]]
"'''Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy'''" was a remark made during the 1988 United States vice-presidential debate by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] vice-presidential candidate [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Lloyd Bentsen]] to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] vice-presidential candidate Senator [[Dan Quayle]] in response to Quayle's mentioning the name of [[John F. Kennedy]], the 35th [[President of the United States]]. Since then, the words "You're no Jack Kennedy", or some variation on Bentsen's remark, have become a part of the [[List of political catch phrases|political lexicon]] as a way to deflate politicians or other individuals perceived as thinking too highly of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1844704_1844706_1844605,00.html|title=Quayle's Unwelcome Analogy|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
The debate was held on October 5, 1988, at the [[Omaha Civic Auditorium|Civic Auditorium]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/06/us/vice-presidential-debate-bentsen-quayle-attack-question-competence-serve.html|author=E. J. Dionne Jr.|title=The Vice Presidential Debate; Bentsen and Quayle Attack on Question of Competence to Serve in the Presidency|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 7, 1988|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the moderators, [[Judy Woodruff]], set the stage by addressing the audience: "Based on the history since World War II, there is almost a 50–50 chance that one of the two men here tonight will become President of the United States." She was referring to the probability that the man elected vice president would later become president, either by [[United States presidential line of succession|succession]] or by a presidential bid. (As it stands, neither man ascended to the presidency; Bentsen died in 2006, and Quayle would make only one bid for the Republican presidential nomination, an unsuccessful one in 2000.)

At the time of the debate, three vice-presidents had succeeded to the presidency due to death or resignation since World War II (nine in total), and one former vice-president had gone on to be elected president since World War II (four in total; then-Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]] would be the fifth).

After Quayle became Bush's vice presidential running mate, questions were raised in the press about his age (he was 41 at the time); his limited term of service in the Senate; his grades in college; his [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] duty (which [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrats]] claimed helped him avoid serving in the military during the [[Vietnam War]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Isaacs, Arnold R.|title=Vietnam Shadows|publisher=JHU Press|year=2000|pages=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-wJv7TzkVSYC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ut5iGyGY_i&amp;sig=YJrrYnl8dUNwftopU5EkM_fvUV4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result

Dionne, Jr.|date=August 23, 1988|publisher=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his overall ability to lead the nation in the case of the incapacitation of the president, which became a central issue in the 1988 debate.

Quayle had routinely been comparing himself to Kennedy in his [[Stump speech (politics)|stump speech]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-debate-quayle-bentsen-20161004-snap-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Dukakis|Dukakis]] adviser [[Susan Estrich]] recalled in 2004:&lt;ref name=estrich&gt;Susan Estrich: "[https://web.archive.org/web/20090510072124/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/9/27/103737.shtml The Debates]", [[Newsmax]] September 2004 (copy at the Internet Archive)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Three days [before the debate], in rehearsal, [Bentsen] had been shocked when the Dan Quayle stand-in compared himself to Jack Kennedy. "Does he really do that?", Bentsen asked at the time. He did. "Can I say something?", Bentsen, ever the gentleman, asked us. We nodded enthusiastically. So as we sat backstage, and heard Quayle compare himself to Kennedy, I turned to the key supporters gathered in the holding room and said, "Here it comes." And it did.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a mock debate with Dennis Eckart, Bentsen used the casual remark "you're no Jack Kennedy and George Bush is no [[Ronald Reagan]]."&lt;ref&gt;Germond &amp; Witcover 1989:440.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quayle did not directly compare himself with Kennedy in terms of accomplishment, but in terms of length of Congressional service; Quayle served for 12 years while Kennedy served for 14. When Kennedy successfully sought the Democratic nomination in 1960, he had less experience than his primary opponents, most of whom had more seniority in the Senate. While it was a statement of fact, some of Quayle's advisors suggested that this comparison could cause trouble.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/spc/debatingourdestiny/interviews/quayle.html|title=Vice President Dan Quayle Interview - Debating Our Destiny|date=December 2, 1999|publisher=[[PBS]]|website=www.pbs.org|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcript==
A full transcript of the 1988 vice-presidential debates from the [[Commission on Presidential Debates]] can be found at [http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=october-5-1988-debate-transcripts www.debates.org].

The relevant portion of that transcript follows:

{{quote|
'''[[Tom Brokaw]]''': Senator Quayle, I don't mean to beat this drum until it has no more sound in it. But to follow up on [[Brit Hume]]'s question, when you said that it was a hypothetical situation, it is, sir, after all, the reason that we're here tonight, because you are running not just for Vice President—''(Applause)''—and if you cite the experience that you had in Congress, surely you must have some plan in mind about what you would do if it fell to you to become President of the United States, as it has to so many Vice Presidents just in the last 25 years or so.

'''Quayle''': Let me try to answer the question one more time. I think this is the fourth time that I've had this question.

'''Brokaw''': The third time.

'''Quayle''': Three times that I've had this question—and I will try to answer it again for you, as clearly as I can, because the question you're asking is, "What kind of qualifications does Dan Quayle have to be president," "What kind of qualifications do I have," and "What would I do in this kind of a situation?" And what would I do in this situation? [...] I have far more experience than many others that sought the office of vice president of this country. I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency. I will be prepared to deal with the people in the Bush administration, if that unfortunate event would ever occur.

'''[[Judy Woodruff]]''': Senator Bentsen?

'''Bentsen''': Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. '''Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.''' ''(Prolonged shouts and applause.)'' What has to be done in a situation like that is to call in the—

'''Woodruff''': ''(Admonishing applauders)'' Please, please, once again you are only taking time away from your own candidate.

'''Quayle''': That was really uncalled for, Senator. ''(Shouts and applause.)''

'''Bentsen''': You are the one that was making the comparison, Senator—and I'm one who knew him well. And frankly I think you are so far apart in the objectives you choose for your country that I did not think the comparison was well-taken.}}

==Aftermath==
Quayle's reaction to Bentsen's comment was played and replayed by the Democrats in their subsequent television ads as an announcer intoned: "Quayle: just a heartbeat away." It proved sure-laugh fodder for comedians, and more and more editorial cartoons depicted Quayle as a child (''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' actually used a child actor to portray Quayle in several sketches).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-lists/public-meltdowns-and-profane-dames-20-off-the-hook-emmy-moments-24081/candice-bergen-mocks-dan-quayle-1992-171901/|title=Public Meltdowns and Profane Dames: 20 Off-the-Hook Emmy Moments|author=Kroll, Katy|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=August 18, 2014|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avoiding going head-to-head with a seasoned Bentsen, Quayle had spent the debate criticizing presidential nominee [[Michael Dukakis]] as too liberal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/2017/01/17/reassessment-dan-quayle-vice-president/96670656/|title=A reassessment: Dan Quayle as vice president|author=Goldstein, Joel K.|work=Indy Star|date=January 17, 2017|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quayle felt that he had successfully got that message across since Bentsen did not defend Dukakis.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

The Bush–Quayle ticket defeated [[Michael Dukakis|Dukakis]]–Bentsen in the presidential election by a [[United States presidential election, 1988|margin]] of 8% of the popular vote and an electoral landslide, with the Democrats winning only ten states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/09/us/1988-elections-bush-elected-6-5-margin-with-solid-gop-base-south-democrats-hold.html|author=E.

==Legacy==
Four years later at the [[1992 Republican National Convention]], [[Ronald Reagan]] answered claims by [[Bill Clinton]]'s campaign, while poking fun at his own age, by saying, "This fellow they've nominated claims he's the new [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Well, let me tell you something. I knew Thomas Jefferson. He was a friend of mine. And governor, you're no Thomas Jefferson."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|title=In Their Own Words: The Overview; Bush Vows A Tough Campaign As G.O.P.

At the [[United States vice-presidential debate, 1992|1992 US vice presidential debate]] during his opening statement, Democratic nominee [[Al Gore]] took a humorous shot at Dan Quayle over the Jack Kennedy comparison. Quayle was running for re-election and trying to make up for his performance in the 1988 debate. Gore was also taking a shot at President [[George H. W. Bush|George Bush]]'s comparisons of the accomplishments of his administration to that of [[Harry Truman]]. Gore said to Quayle, "I'll make you a deal this evening. If you don't try to compare George Bush to Harry Truman, I won't compare you to Jack Kennedy." The audience reacted with laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/14/us/the-1992-campaign-excerpts-from-the-debate-among-quayle-gore-and-stockdale.html|title=THE 1992 CAMPAIGN; Excerpts From the Debate Among Quayle, Gore and Stockdale|date=October 14, 1992|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=october-13-1992-debate-transcript|title=CPD: October 13, 1992 Debate Transcript|website=www.debates.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Ronald Reagan's daughter [[Patti Davis]] paraphrased the quotation in reference to a number of presidential candidates invoking her father's name during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential campaign]], "Where is Lloyd Bentsen when you need him? 'I knew Ronald Reagan... senator (or governor), you're no Ronald Reagan.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|title=The Gipper Gap: In Search of Reagan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/weekinreview/20broder.html|date=January 20, 2008|accessdate=September 19, 2018|author=Broder, John M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, at the UK [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party Conference]] in Birmingham, Foreign Secretary [[William Hague]] made a response to a speech that Labour leader [[Ed Miliband]] had given at his own party conference in the previous week, in which Miliband compared his party with [[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s [[One Nation Conservatism]] ideology. Hague said, "To borrow a turn of phrase, we were led by Disraeli, our predecessors knew Disraeli, Disraeli was a Conservative through and through, and, Ed Miliband, you are no Disraeli."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=BBC News|title=Conservative conference: Miliband no Disraeli, says Hague|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19864819|date=October 7, 2012|accessdate=2012-07-10|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[United States vice-presidential debate, 2012|2012 US vice presidential debate]], Vice President [[Joe Biden]] made a similar statement in reaction to Republican vice presidential nominee [[Paul Ryan]]'s citation of a policy taken by President Kennedy. Biden quipped at Ryan, "Oh, now you're Jack Kennedy?" to laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=NBC Politics|title=Biden plays aggressor in debate as Ryan makes GOP case|url=http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/11/14376267-biden-and-ryan-tangle-in-free-wheeling-debate?lite|date=October 11, 2012|accessdate=September 19, 2018|author=O'Brien, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]], former Reagan administration official Doug Elmets, referencing the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign of Donald Trump]], stated, "I'm here tonight to say: I knew Ronald Reagan. I worked for Ronald Reagan.

In June 2017, after the [[Taoiseach]] of [[Ireland]] [[Leo Varadkar]] nominated former [[Attorney General of Ireland|attorney general]] [[Maire Whelan]] as a judge to the Court of Appeals and was accused of pressuring [[President of Ireland|President]] [[Michael D. Higgins]] to sign off on her confirmation, he claimed appointments like this have precedent such as in the cases of [[Frank Clarke (judge)|Frank Clarke]], [[Adrian Hardiman]] and [[Donal O'Donnell]]. [[Fianna Fáil]] Leader [[Micheál Martin]] claimed it "stunk to high heaven" and quipped "with the greatest of respect, Máire Whelan is no Frank Clarke, is no Adrian Hardiman, and is no Donal O'Donnell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Irish Times|title=Taoiseach defends new judge amid Micheal Martin criticism|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/taoiseach-defends-new-judge-amid-miche%C3%A1l-martin-criticism-1.3127028|date=June 20, 2017|accessdate=September 19, 2018|author=O'Regan, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, 2017, [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]] posted on Twitter, comparing herself to the character [[C. J. Cregg]] from ''[[The West Wing]]'' on an incident involving a situation where the White House was receiving one of the White House Thanksgiving turkeys set to be pardoned by President [[Donald Trump]]. After her tweet, actor [[Bradley Whitford]], who portrayed [[White House Deputy Chief of Staff]] [[Josh Lyman]] on the show, replied saying "I know C.J. Cregg. C.J. Cregg is a friend of mine. You're no C.J. Cregg." Actress [[Allison Janney]], who played C.J. in the series, also replied, thanking Whitford for his sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Newsweek|title=West Wing Cast Hits Out At Sarah Huckabee Sanders: 'You're no C.J.

===Parodies and popular media===

[[File:Short (finance).png|thumb|294px|Schematic representation of short selling in two steps. The short seller [[securities lending|borrows shares]] and immediately sells them. The short seller then expects the price to decrease, when the seller can profit by purchasing the shares to return to the lender.]]
{{Securities}}
In [[finance]], a '''short sale''' (also known as '''a short''', '''shorting''', or '''going short''') is the sale of an asset ([[security (finance)|securities]] or other [[financial instrument]]) that the seller does not own. The seller effects such a sale by borrowing the asset in order to deliver it to the buyer. Subsequently, the resulting short position is "covered" when the seller repurchases the asset in a market transaction and delivers the purchased asset to the lender to replace the quantity initially borrowed. In the event of an interim price decline, the short seller will profit, since the cost of (re)purchase will be less than the proceeds received upon the initial (short) sale. Conversely, the short [[position (finance)|position]] will result in a loss if the price of a shorted instrument rises prior to repurchase.

Potential loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited, as there is no theoretical limit to a rise in the price of the instrument. However, in practice, the short seller is required to post [[Margin (finance)|margin]] or collateral to cover losses, and inability to do so in a timely way would cause its broker or [[counterparty]] to liquidate the position. In the securities markets, the seller generally must borrow the securities to effect delivery in the short sale. In some cases, the short seller must pay a fee to borrow the securities and must additionally reimburse the lender for cash returns the lender would have received had the securities not been loaned out.

Short selling is most commonly done with instruments traded in [[Financial market|public securities, futures or currency markets]], due to the liquidity and real-time price dissemination characteristic of such markets and because the instruments defined within each class are [[Fungibility|fungible]].

In practical terms, "going short" can be considered the opposite of the conventional practice of "[[Long (finance)|going long]]", whereby an investor profits from an increase in the price of the asset. Mathematically, the return from a short position is equivalent to that of owning (being "long") a negative amount of the instrument.  (Nevertheless, one main discrepancy in the short against a long position is that the short position must exclude the dividends paid, if any.)

A short sale may have a variety of objectives.  [[speculation|Speculators]] may sell short hoping to realize a profit on an instrument that appears overvalued, just as [[long (finance)|long]] investors or speculators hope to profit from a rise in the price of an instrument that appears undervalued.  Traders or fund managers may [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] a long position or a portfolio through one or more short positions.

In contrast to a traditional merchant who sets out to "buy low, sell high", a short-seller sets out to "sell high, buy low", or even to "buy high, sell low" when this buy is in fact "on tick".

Research indicates that banning short selling is ineffective and has negative effects on markets.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr518.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://people.stern.nyu.edu/mbrenner/research/short_selling.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1704&amp;context=njilb&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.imd.org/news/upload/Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722034426/http://www.imd.org/news/upload/Report.pdf |archive-date=22 July 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/current_issues/ci18-5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless short selling is subject to criticism and periodically faces hostility from society and policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nber.org/reporter/winter05/lamont.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
{{Finance sidebar}}
The following example describes the short sale of a security. To profit from a decrease in the price of a security, a short seller can [[Securities lending|borrow the security]] and sell it expecting that it will be cheaper to repurchase in the future.  When the seller decides that the time is right (or when the lender recalls the securities), the seller buys equivalent securities and returns them to the lender.  The process relies on the fact that the securities (or the other assets being sold short) are [[Fungibility|fungible]]; the term "borrowing" is therefore used in the sense of borrowing cash, where different bank notes or coins can be returned to the lender (as opposed to borrowing a car, where the same car must be returned).

A short seller typically borrows through a [[brokerage firm|broker]], who is usually holding the securities for another [[investor]] who owns the securities; the broker himself seldom purchases the securities to lend to the short seller.&lt;ref name="langasset"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://langasset.com/ishort.htm |title=Understanding Short Selling - A Primer |publisher=Langasset.com |date= |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lender does not lose the right to sell the securities while they have been lent, as the broker usually holds a large pool of such securities for a number of investors which, as such securities are fungible, can instead be transferred to any buyer. In most market conditions there is a ready supply of securities to be borrowed, held by pension funds, mutual funds and other investors.

The act of buying back the securities that were sold short is called "covering the short" or "covering the position". A short position can be covered at any time before the securities are due to be returned. Once the position is covered, the short seller is not affected by subsequent rises or falls in the price of the securities, as he already holds the securities required to repay the lender.

Short selling refers broadly to any transaction used by an investor to profit from the decline in price of a borrowed asset or financial instrument. However some short positions, for example those undertaken by means of [[derivative (finance)|derivatives contracts]], are not technically short sales because no underlying asset is actually delivered upon the initiation of the position.  Derivatives contracts include [[Futures contract|futures]], [[option (finance)|options]], and [[swap (finance)|swaps]].&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd9hDRR1Yx4C&amp;pg=PA41 |author=Larry Harris |title=Trading and Exchange: Market Microstructure for Practitioners |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195144708 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chance&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DT0nnLDMYTgC&amp;pg=PA6 |authors=Don M.

=== Worked examples ===

====Profitable trade====
Shares in ACME Inc. currently trade at $10 per [[share (finance)|share]].

# A short seller investor borrows from a lender 100 shares of ACME Inc. and immediately sells them for a total of $1,000.
# Subsequently, the price  of the shares falls to $8 per share.
# Short seller now buys 100 shares of ACME Inc. for $800.
# Short seller returns the shares to the lender, who must accept the return of the same number of shares as was lent despite the fact that the market value of the shares has decreased.
# Short seller profits from the $200 difference (minus borrowing fees) between the price at which the short seller sold the shares, which were borrowed, and the lower price at which the short seller repurchased the shares sold.

====Profitable covered trade====
Shares in ACME Inc. currently trade at $10 per [[share (finance)|share]].

# A short seller investor owns 100 shares of ACME Inc. and sells them for a total of $1,000.
# Subsequently, the price  of the shares falls to $8 per share.
# Short seller now buys 100 shares of ACME Inc. for $800, or alternatively, purchases 125 shares for $1,000.
# Short seller retains as profit the $200 difference between the price at which the short seller sold the shares owned and the lower price at which the short seller was able to repurchase the shares.

====Loss-making trade====
Shares in ACME Inc. currently trade at $10 per share.

# A short seller borrows 100 shares of ACME Inc. and immediately sells them for a total of $1,000.
# Subsequently, the price of the shares rises to $25.
# Short seller is required to return the shares, and is compelled to buy 100 shares of ACME Inc. for $2,500.
# Short seller returns the shares to the lender who accepts the return of the same number of shares as was lent.
# Short seller incurs as a loss the $1,500 difference  between the price at which he sold the shares borrowed and the higher price at which the short seller had to repurchase the shares (plus borrowing fees).

The Dutch East India Company and its shareholders played a crucial role in the transformation of modern-day global financial markets, causing a number of 'innovations' to be introduced, such as [[futures contract]]s, [[stock option]]s, [[short selling]], and [[bear raid]].]]

In 1611, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) launched the world's first official [[stock exchange]] in Amsterdam. The first documented effort of the short selling of [[Security (finance)|securities]] in financial history dates to 1609, when [[Isaac Le Maire]], a sizeable [[shareholder]] of the VOC, initiated the first recorded [[bear raid]], selling shares of the Company short in order to buy them back at a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/rise-and-fall-of-united-east-india-2013-11 |author= Taylor, Bryan |title=The Rise and Fall of the Largest Corporation in History |publisher=[[BusinessInsider.com]] |date= 6 November 2013 |accessdate=18 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/01/29/382463501/the-spicy-history-of-short-selling-stocks |author=Kestenbaum, David |title=The Spicy History Of Short Selling Stocks |publisher=[[NPR.org]] |date=29 January 2015 |accessdate=29 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An early practice of [[financial regulation]] was the first recorded ban on short selling that was enacted by the Dutch authorities as early as 1610.]]

This, combined with the seemingly complex and hard-to-follow tactics of the practice, has made short selling a historical target for criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/eblj/issues/volume4/number1/Stanley.pdf|title=Moritz College of Law|work=osu.edu}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; At various times in history, governments have restricted or banned short selling.

The London banking house of [[Neal, James, Fordyce and Down]] collapsed in June 1772, precipitating a major crisis that included the collapse of almost every private bank in Scotland, and a liquidity crisis in the two major banking centres of the world, London and Amsterdam. The bank had been speculating by shorting [[East India Company]] stock on a massive scale, and apparently using customer deposits to cover losses. It was perceived{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} as having a magnifying effect in the violent downturn in the [[Tulip mania|Dutch tulip market]] in the eighteenth century.  In another well-referenced example, [[George Soros]] became notorious for "breaking the [[Bank of England]]" on [[Black Wednesday]] of 1992, when he sold short more than $10 billion worth of [[pounds sterling]].

The term "short" was in use from at least the mid-nineteenth century.  It is commonly understood that "short" is used because the short-seller is in a deficit position with his [[brokerage firm|brokerage house]].  [[Jacob Little]] was known as The Great Bear of Wall Street who began shorting stocks in the United States in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyberpedia.com/jacoblittle.htm |title=Scripophily - PSTA - Professional Scripophily Trade Association |publisher=Encyberpedia.com |date= |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative news, such as litigation against a company, may also entice professional traders to sell the stock short in hope of the stock price going down.

During the [[dot-com bubble]], shorting a start-up company could backfire since it could be taken over at a price higher than the price at which speculators shorted.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}  Short-sellers were forced to cover their positions at acquisition prices, while in many cases the firm often overpaid for the start-up.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

=== Naked short selling restrictions===
During the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]], critics argued that investors taking large short positions in struggling financial firms like [[Lehman Brothers]], [[HBOS]] and [[Morgan Stanley]] created instability in the stock market and placed additional downward pressure on prices. In response, a number of countries introduced restrictive regulations on short-selling in 2008 and 2009. [[Naked short selling]] is the practice of short-selling a tradable asset without first borrowing the security or ensuring that the security can be borrowed &amp;ndash; it was this practice that was commonly restricted.&lt;ref name=Lavinio&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h95B-V4l3w0C&amp;pg=PA3 |title=The Hedge Fund Handbook: A Definitive Guide for Analyzing and Evaluating Alternative Investments |last=Lavinio |first=Stefano |year=1999 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=442–443 |isbn=0071350306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Madura&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIizpVxYjt0C&amp;pg=PA308 |title=Financial Markets and Institutions |last=Madura |first=Jeff |year=2009 |publisher=South-Western College Publishing |page=308 |isbn=1439038848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investors argued that it was the weakness of financial institutions, not short-selling, that drove stocks to fall.&lt;ref name=Story&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/business/08short.html |title=A Debate as a Ban on Short-Selling Ends: Did It Make Any Difference? |last=Harris |first=Larry |year= |work=The New York Times |date=7 October 2008 |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, the Securities Exchange Commission in the United States abruptly banned short sales, primarily in financial stocks, to protect companies under siege in the stock market.

== Mechanism ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
{{see also|Securities lending}}
Short selling stock consists of the following:

* The [[speculation|speculator]] instructs the broker to sell the shares and the proceeds are credited to the broker's account at the firm, on which the firm can earn interest.  Generally, the short seller does not earn interest on the short proceeds and cannot use or encumber the proceeds for another transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Reserve Board.

* Upon completion of the sale, the investor typically has a limited time (for example, 3 days in the US) to borrow the shares.  If required by law, the investor first ensures that cash or equity is on deposit with his brokerage firm as collateral for the [[Margin (finance)|initial short margin requirement]].  Some short sellers, mainly firms and hedge funds, participate in the practice of [[naked short selling]], where the shorted shares are not borrowed or delivered.
* The speculator may close the position by buying back the shares (called covering).  If the price has dropped, he makes a profit.  If the stock advanced, he takes a loss.
* Finally, the speculator may return the shares to the lender or stay short indefinitely.
* At any time, the lender may call for the return of his shares, e.g., because he wants to sell them.  The borrower must buy shares on the market and return them to the lender (or he must borrow the shares from elsewhere).  When the broker completes this transaction automatically, it is called a 'buy-in'.

Short selling stock works similar to buying on [[margin (finance)|margin]], therefore also requires a [[margin account]] as well:

=== Shorting stock in the U.S. ===
To sell stocks short in the U.S., the seller must arrange for a broker-dealer to confirm that it can deliver the shorted securities. This is referred to as a ''[[Locate (finance)|locate]].''  Brokers have a variety of means to borrow stocks to facilitate locates and make good on delivery of the shorted security.

The vast majority of stocks borrowed by U.S. brokers come from loans made by the leading custody banks and fund management companies (see list below). Institutions often lend out their shares to earn extra money on their investments. These institutional loans are usually arranged by the custodian who holds the securities for the institution.  In an institutional stock loan, the borrower puts up cash collateral, typically 102% of the value of the stock.  The cash collateral is then invested by the lender, who often rebates part of the interest to the borrower. The interest that is kept by the lender is the compensation to the lender for the stock loan.

Brokerage firms can also borrow stocks from the accounts of their own customers.  Typical margin account agreements give brokerage firms the right to borrow customer shares without notifying the customer.  In general, brokerage accounts are only allowed to lend shares from accounts for which customers have ''debit balances'', meaning they have borrowed from the account. SEC Rule 15c3-3 imposes such severe restrictions on the lending of shares from cash accounts or excess margin (fully paid for) shares from margin accounts that most brokerage firms do not bother except in rare circumstances. (These restrictions include that the broker must have the express permission of the customer and provide collateral or a letter of credit.)

Most brokers allow retail customers to borrow shares to short a stock only if one of their own customers has purchased the stock on [[Margin (finance)|margin]].  Brokers go through the "locate" process outside their own firm to obtain borrowed shares from other brokers only for their large institutional customers.

Stock exchanges such as the [[NYSE]] or the [[NASDAQ]] typically report the "short interest" of a stock, which gives the number of shares that have been ''legally'' sold short as a percent of the total [[Float (finance)|float]].  Alternatively, these can also be expressed as the [[short interest ratio]], which is the number of shares ''legally'' sold short as a multiple of the average daily volume.  These can be useful tools to spot trends in stock price movements but for them to be reliable, investors must also ascertain the number of shares brought into existence by naked shorters.  Speculators are cautioned to remember that for every share that has been shorted (owned by a new owner), a 'shadow owner' exists (i.e., the original owner) who also is part of the universe of owners of that stock, i.e.,  despite having no voting rights, he has not relinquished his interest and some rights in that stock.

=== Securities lending ===
{{Main|Securities lending}}

When a security is sold, the seller is contractually obliged to deliver it to the buyer. If a seller sells a security short without owning it first, the seller must borrow the security from a third party to fulfill its obligation. Otherwise, the seller ''fails to deliver,'' the transaction does not [[settlement (finance)|settle]], and the seller may be subject to a claim from its [[counterparty]]. Certain large holders of securities, such as a [[custodian bank|custodian]] or [[investment management]] firm, often lend out these securities to gain extra income, a process known as [[securities lending]]. The lender receives a fee for this service. Similarly, retail investors can sometimes make an extra fee when their broker wants to borrow their securities. This is only possible when the investor has full [[title (property)|title]] of the security, so it cannot be used as collateral for [[margin buying]].

=== Sources of short interest data ===
Time delayed short interest data (for ''legally'' shorted shares) is available in a number of countries, including the US, the UK, Hong Kong, and Spain. The number of stocks being shorted on a global basis has increased in recent years for various structural reasons (e.g., the growth of [[130/30]] type strategies, short or bear ETFs). The data is typically delayed; for example, the NASDAQ requires its [[broker-dealer]] member firms to report data on the 15th of each month, and then publishes a compilation eight days later.&lt;ref&gt;NASDAQ. [http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/short-interest.aspx About the Short Interest Page].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some market data providers (like [[Data Explorers]] and SunGard Financial Systems&lt;ref&gt;SunGard's [http://www.sungard.com/financialsystems/products/shortsidecom.aspx ShortSide.com] discusses the product.&lt;/ref&gt;) believe that stock lending data provides a good proxy for short interest levels (excluding any naked short interest). SunGard provides daily data on short interest by tracking the proxy variables based on borrowing and lending data it collects.&lt;ref&gt;SunGard. [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SunGard+Launches+Borrow+Indices%3B+First+Proxy+for+Measuring+Short...-a0123159715 SunGard Launches Borrow Indices; First Proxy for Measuring Short Interest on a Daily Basis]. Business Wire.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Short selling terms ===
'''Days to Cover (DTC)''' is a numerical term that describes the relationship between the number of shares in a given equity that has been ''legally'' short-sold and the number of days of typical trading that it would require to 'cover' all legal short positions outstanding.  For example, if there are ten million shares of XYZ Inc. that are currently legally short-sold and the average daily volume of XYZ shares traded each day is one million, it would require ten days of trading for all legal short positions to be covered (10 million / 1 million).

'''Short Interest''' is a numerical term that relates the number of shares in a given equity that have been legally shorted divided by the total shares outstanding for the company, usually expressed as a percent.  For example, if there are ten million shares of XYZ Inc. that are currently legally short sold, and the total number of shares issued by the company is one hundred million, the Short Interest is 10% (10 million / 100 million).  If however, shares are being created through naked short selling, "fails" data must be accessed to assess accurately the true level of short interest.

'''Borrow cost''' is the fee paid to a securities lender for borrowing the stock or other security. The cost of borrowing the stock is usually negligible compared to fees paid and interest accrued on the margin account - in 2002, 91% of stocks could be shorted for less than a 1% fee per annum, generally lower than interest rates earned on the margin account. However, certain stocks become "hard to borrow" as stockholders willing to lend their stock become more difficult to locate. The cost of borrowing these stocks can become significant - in February 2001, the cost to borrow (short) [[Krispy Kreme]] stock reached an annualized 55%, indicating that a short seller would need to pay the lender more than half the price of the stock over the course of the year, essentially as interest for borrowing a stock in limited supply.&lt;ref name="marketForborrowing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.Cochrane/teaching/35150_advanced_investments/davolio_borrowing_stock_JF.pdf|title=The market for borrowing stock|accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has important implications for derivatives pricing and strategy, as the borrow cost itself can become a significant [[convenience yield]] for holding the stock (similar to additional [[dividend]]) - for instance, [[put-call parity]] relationships are broken and the [[Exercise (options)|early exercise]] feature of American call options on non-dividend paying stocks can become [[Exercise (options)#Exercise Considerations|rational to exercise early]], which otherwise would not be economical.&lt;ref name="hardToBorrow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/Lecture13Quant.pdf|title=Lecture 13: Hard to Borrow Securities|accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naked short selling===
{{Main|Naked short selling}}
A naked short sale occurs when a security is sold short without borrowing the security within a set time (for example, three days in the US.)  This means that the buyer of such a short is buying the short-seller's promise to deliver a share, rather than buying the share itself. The short-seller's promise is known as a hypothecated share.

When the holder of the underlying stock receives a dividend, the holder of the hypothecated share would receive an equal [[dividend]] from the short seller.

Naked shorting has been made illegal except where allowed under limited circumstances by [[market maker]]s.  It is detected by the [[Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation]] (in the US) as a "failure to deliver" or simply "fail.”  While many fails are settled in a short time, some have been allowed to linger in the system.

In the US, arranging to borrow a security before a short sale is called a ''locate''.  In 2005, to prevent widespread failure to deliver securities, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) put in place [[Regulation SHO]], intended to prevent speculators from selling some stocks short before doing a locate.  Requirements that are more stringent were put in place in September 2008, ostensibly to prevent the practice from exacerbating market declines.  The rules were made permanent in 2009.

== Fees ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
When a broker facilitates the delivery of a client's short sale, the client is charged a fee for this service, usually a standard commission similar to that of purchasing a similar security.

If the short position begins to move against the holder of the short position (i.e., the price of the security begins to rise), money is removed from the holder's cash balance and moved to their [[margin balance]].  If short shares continue to rise in price, and the holder does not have sufficient funds in the cash account to cover the position, the holder begins to borrow on margin for this purpose, thereby accruing margin interest charges.  These are computed and charged just as for any other margin debit. Therefore, only margin accounts can be used to open a short position.

When a security's [[ex-dividend date]] passes, the dividend is deducted from the shortholder's account and paid to the person from whom the stock is borrowed.

For some brokers, the short seller may not earn interest on the proceeds of the short sale or use it to reduce outstanding margin debt.  These brokers may not pass this benefit on to the retail client unless the client is very large. The interest is often split with the lender of the security.

== Dividends and voting rights ==
Where shares have been shorted and the company that issues the shares distributes a dividend, the question arises as to who receives the dividend. The new buyer of the shares, who is the ''holder of record'' and holds the shares outright, receives the dividend from the company. However, the lender, who may hold its shares in a [[margin account]] with a [[Prime brokerage|prime broker]] and is unlikely to be aware that these particular shares are being lent out for shorting, also expects to receive a dividend.  The short seller therefore pays the lender an amount equal to the dividend to compensate—though technically, as this payment does not come from the company, it is not a dividend. The short seller is therefore said to be ''short the dividend''.

A similar issue comes up with the voting rights attached to the shorted shares.  Unlike a dividend, voting rights cannot legally be synthesized and so the buyer of the shorted share, as the holder of record, controls the voting rights. The owner of a margin account from which the shares were lent agreed in advance to relinquish voting rights to shares during the period of any short sale.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

As noted earlier, victims of naked shorting sometimes report that the number of votes cast is greater than the number of shares issued by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.com/almID/1202430726911/?slreturn=20180410051827|title=Over-voting at Taser in 2005|author=Greg LandContactAll Articles|first=|date=15 May 2009|website=|publisher=Law.com|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Markets ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}

=== Futures and options contracts ===
When trading [[futures contract]]s, being 'short' means having the legal obligation to deliver something at the expiration of the contract, although the holder of the short position may alternately buy back the contract prior to expiration instead of making delivery.  Short futures transactions are often used by producers of a commodity to fix the future price of goods they have not yet produced.  Shorting a futures contract is sometimes also used by those holding the underlying asset (i.e. those with a long position) as a temporary hedge against price declines.  Shorting futures may also be used for speculative trades, in which case the investor is looking to profit from any decline in the price of the futures contract prior to expiration.

An investor can also purchase a put option, giving that investor the right (but not the obligation) to sell the underlying asset (such as shares of stock) at a fixed price.  In the event of a market decline, the option holder may exercise these put options, obliging the counterparty to buy the underlying asset at the agreed upon (or "strike") price, which would then be higher than the current quoted spot price of the asset.

=== Currency ===
Selling short on the currency markets is different from selling short on the stock markets.  Currencies are traded in pairs, each currency being priced in terms of another.  In this way, selling short on the currency markets is identical to going long on stocks.

Novice traders or stock traders can be confused by the failure to recognize and understand this point: a [[contract]] is always long in terms of one medium and short another.

When the exchange rate has changed, the trader buys the first currency again; this time he gets more of it, and pays back the loan.  Since he got more money than he had borrowed initially, he makes money.  Of course, the reverse can also occur.

An example of this is as follows: Let us say a trader wants to trade with the [[US dollar]] and the [[Indian rupee]] currencies.  Assume that the current market rate is USD 1 to Rs.50 and the trader borrows Rs.100.  With this, he buys USD 2.  If the next day, the conversion rate becomes USD 1 to Rs.51, then the trader sells his USD 2 and gets Rs.102.  He returns Rs.100 and keeps the Rs.2 profit (minus fees).

One may also take a short position in a currency using futures or options; the preceding method is used to bet on the spot price, which is more directly analogous to selling a stock short.

== Risks ==
{{More citations needed|date=April 2009}}
'''Note: this section does not apply to currency markets.'''

Short selling is sometimes referred to as a "negative income investment strategy" because there is no potential for dividend income or interest income. Stock is held only long enough to be sold pursuant to the contract, and one's return is therefore limited to short term [[capital gain]]s, which are taxed as ordinary income. For this reason, buying shares (called "going long") has a very different [[risk]] profile from selling short.  Furthermore, a "long's" losses are limited because the price can only go down to zero, but [[Gain (accounting)|gain]]s are not, as there is no limit, in theory, on how high the price can go.  On the other hand, the short seller's possible gains are limited to the original price of the stock, which can only go down to zero, whereas the loss potential, again in theory, has no limit.  For this reason, short selling probably is most often used as a [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] strategy to manage the risks of long investments.

Many short sellers place a ''[[stop order]]'' with their stockbroker after selling a stock short—an order to the brokerage to cover the position if the price of the stock should rise to a certain level. This is to limit the loss and avoid the problem of unlimited liability described above.  In some cases, if the stock's price skyrockets, the stockbroker may decide to cover the short seller's position immediately and without his consent to guarantee that the short seller can make good on his debt of shares.

Short sellers must be aware of the potential for a [[short squeeze]].  When the price of a stock rises significantly, some people who are shorting the stock cover their positions to limit their losses (this may occur in an automated way if the short sellers had stop-loss orders in place with their brokers); others may be forced to close their position to meet a [[margin call]]; others may be forced to cover, subject to the terms under which they borrowed the stock, if the person who lent the stock wishes to sell and take a profit.  Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes an ever further rise in the stock's price, which in turn may trigger additional covering.  Because of this, most short sellers restrict their activities to heavily traded stocks, and they keep an eye on the "short interest" levels of their short investments.  Short interest is defined as the total number of shares that have been ''legally'' sold short, but not covered. A short squeeze can be deliberately induced.  This can happen when large investors (such as companies or wealthy individuals) notice significant short positions, and buy many shares, with the intent of selling the position at a profit to the short sellers, who may be panicked by the initial uptick or who are forced to cover their short positions to avoid margin calls.

Another risk is that a given stock may become "hard to borrow." As defined by the SEC and based on lack of availability, a broker may charge a hard to borrow fee daily, without notice, for any day that the SEC declares a share is hard to borrow. Additionally, a broker may be required to cover a short seller's position at any time ("buy in").  The short seller receives a warning from the broker that he is "failing to deliver" stock, which leads to the buy-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Arnold |first=Roger |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/862233/1/knowing-the-rules-of-the-shorting-game.html |title=Knowing the Rules of the Shorting Game |publisher=TheStreet |date=14 January 2000 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because short sellers must eventually deliver the shorted securities to their broker, and need money to buy them, there is a credit risk for the broker. The penalties for failure to deliver on a short selling contract inspired financier [[Daniel Drew]] to warn: "He who sells what isn't his'n, Must buy it back or go to pris'n." To manage its own risk, the broker requires the short seller to keep a [[margin (finance)|margin]] account, and charges interest of between 2% and 8% depending on the amounts involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.scottrade.com/online-brokerage/interest-margin-rates.html | work=ScotTrade | title=margin account rates schedule | date=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the eruption of the massive [[Securities fraud|China stock frauds]] on North American equity markets brought a related risk to light for the short seller. The efforts of research-oriented short sellers to expose these frauds eventually prompted NASDAQ, NYSE and other exchanges to impose sudden, lengthy [[trading halt]]s that froze the values of shorted stocks at artificially high values. Reportedly in some instances, brokers charged short sellers excessively large amounts of interest based on these high values as the shorts were forced to continue their borrowings at least until the halts were lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111904113704576383892664177456.html?ru=yahoo&amp;mod=yahoobarrons | work=Barrons | title=Even Short-Sellers Burned by Chinese Shares | date=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short sellers tend to temper overvaluation by selling into exuberance.  Likewise, short sellers are said to provide price support by buying when negative sentiment is exacerbated after a significant price decline.  Short selling can have negative implications if it causes a premature or unjustified share price collapse when the fear of cancellation due to bankruptcy becomes contagious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwXWZzxXxfwC&amp;pg=PP7&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_1#PPA253,M1 |title=The Theory and Practice of Short Selling, Chapter 9, Conclusions and Implications for Investors by Frank J.

== Strategies ==

=== Hedging ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
{{Further|Hedge (finance)}}
Hedging often represents a means of minimizing the risk from a more complex set of transactions.
Examples of this are:
* A farmer who has just planted his wheat wants to lock in the price at which he can sell after the harvest.  He would take a short position in wheat futures.
* A [[market maker]] in [[corporate bond]]s is constantly trading bonds when clients want to buy or sell.  This can create substantial bond positions.  The largest risk is that interest rates overall move.  The trader can hedge this risk by selling government bonds short against his long positions in corporate bonds.  In this way, the risk that remains is [[credit risk]] of the corporate bonds.
* An options trader may short shares to remain [[delta neutral]] so that he is not exposed to risk from price movements in the stocks that underlie his options

=== Arbitrage ===
{{Further|Arbitrage}}
A short seller may be trying to benefit from market inefficiencies arising from the mispricing of certain products.  Examples of this are
* An arbitrageur who buys long futures contracts on a [[Treasury security|US Treasury security]], and sells short the underlying [[Treasury security|US Treasury security]].

=== Against the box ===
One variant of selling short involves a long position.  "Selling short against the box" consists of holding a long position on which the shares have already risen, whereupon one then enters a short sell order for an equal number of shares. The term ''box'' alludes to the days when a [[safe deposit box]] was used to store (long) shares.  The purpose of this technique is to lock in paper profits on the long position without having to sell that position (and possibly incur taxes if said position has appreciated). Once the short position has been entered, it serves to balance the long position taken earlier. Thus, from that point in time, the profit is locked in (less brokerage fees and short financing costs), regardless of further fluctuations in the underlying share price. For example, one can ensure a profit in this way, while delaying sale until the subsequent tax year.

U.S. investors considering entering into a "short against the box" transaction should be aware of the tax consequences of this transaction.  Unless certain conditions are met, the IRS deems a "short against the box" position to be a "constructive sale" of the long position, which is a taxable event.  These conditions include a requirement that the short position be closed out within 30 days of the end of the year and that the investor must hold their long position, without entering into any hedging strategies, for a minimum of 60 days after the short position has been closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550/ch04.html#d0e8793 |title=United States IRS Publication 550 Investment Income and Expenses |publisher=Irs.gov |date= |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==

===United States===
The [[Securities and Exchange Act of 1934]] gave the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] the power to regulate short sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf |title=Securities Exchange Act of 1934 |year=1934 |publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first official restriction on short selling came in 1938, when the SEC adopted a rule known as the [[uptick rule]] that dictated that a short sale could only be made when the price of a particular stock was higher than the previous trade price. The uptick rule aimed to prevent short sales from causing or exacerbating market price declines.&lt;ref name=Lavinio2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pGs-GBn8-k0C&amp;pg=PA86 |title=The Hedge Fund Handbook: A Definitive Guide for Analyzing and Evaluating Alternative Investments |last=Lavinio |first=Stefano |year=1999 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=85–95 |isbn=0071350306}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2005, The Securities and Exchange Commission enacted [[Regulation SHO]] to target abusive naked short selling.

The regulation contains two key components: the "locate" and the "close-out." The locate component attempts to reduce [[failure to deliver]] securities by requiring a broker possess or have arranged to possess borrowed shares. The close out component requires that a broker be able to deliver the shares that are to be shorted.&lt;ref name=Lavinio2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TM-_yRzNx3cC&amp;pg=PA178 |title=The Complete Guide to Selling Stocks Short: Everything You Need to Know Explained Simply |last=Young |first=Matthew G. |year=2010 |publisher=Atlantic Publishing Group Inc. |pages=178–179 |isbn=1601383266}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, [[initial public offering|initial public offers]] (IPOs) cannot be sold short for a month after they start trading. This mechanism is in place to ensure a degree of price stability during a company's initial trading period. However, some [[brokerage firm]]s that specialize in [[penny stock]]s (referred to colloquially as [[bucket shop (stock market)|bucket shops]]) have used the lack of short selling during this month to [[pump and dump]] thinly traded [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]]s. [[Canada]] and other countries do allow selling IPOs (including U.S. IPOs) short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQtdJqdpzUoC&amp;pg=PA233 |title=Security Analysis with Investment and Portfolio Management |author=Mahipal Singh |publisher=Gyan Books |year=2011 |page=233 |isbn=8182055199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Securities and Exchange Commission initiated a temporary ban on short selling on 799 financial stocks from 19 September 2008 until 2 October 2008. Greater penalties for naked shorting, by mandating delivery of stocks at clearing time, were also introduced. Some state governors have been urging state pension bodies to refrain from lending stock for shorting purposes.&lt;ref&gt;

===Europe, Australia and China===
In the UK, the [[Financial Services Authority]] had a moratorium on short selling 29 leading financial stocks, effective from 2300 [[GMT]], 19 September 2008 until 16 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7624012.stm |title=FSA clamps down on short-selling |date=18 September 2008 |author= [[BBC]] |accessdate=4 January 2010 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the ban was lifted, [[John McFall, Baron McFall of Alcluith|John McFall]], chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], made clear in public statements and a letter to the FSA that he believed it ought to be extended.

==Views of short selling==

Advocates of short selling argue that the practice is an essential part of the [[price discovery]] mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=281514 |title=Short Sale Constraints And Stock Returns by C.M Jones and O.A. Lamont |doi=10.2139/ssrn.281514 |date=20 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial researchers at Duke University said in a study that short interest is an indicator of poor future stock performance (the self-fulfilling aspect) and that short sellers exploit market mistakes about firms' fundamentals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/seminarscalendar/Short.pdf |title=Do Short Sellers Convey Information About Changes in Fundamentals or Risk? |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such noted investors as [[Seth Klarman]] and [[Warren Buffett]] have said that short sellers help the market.  Klarman argued that short sellers are a useful counterweight to the widespread bullishness on Wall Street,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Margin of safety (book)|Margin of safety]]'' (1991), by [[Seth Klarman]].  {{ISBN|0-88730-510-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Buffett believes that short sellers are useful in uncovering fraudulent accounting and other problems at companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Casterline |first=Rick |url=http://www.fool.com/news/commentary/2006/commentary06060104.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613161835/http://www.fool.com/news/commentary/2006/commentary06060104.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 June 2006 |title=2006 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting Q&amp;A with Warren Buffett |publisher=Fool.com |date=1 June 2006 |accessdate=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Grammar is all wrong here! --&gt;Shortseller [[James Chanos]] received widespread publicity when he was an early critic of the accounting practices of [[Enron]].&lt;ref name='Times-Chanos'&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim |last=Peterson |coauthors= |authorlink= |title=Balance Sheet : The silly season isn't over yet |date=6 July 2002 |publisher= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/06/your-money/06iht-maccount06_ed3_.html |work=The New York Times |pages= |accessdate=9 August 2009 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531064426/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/06/your-money/06iht-maccount06_ed3_.html |archivedate=31 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chanos responds to critics of short-selling by pointing to the critical role they played in identifying problems at Enron, Boston Market and other "financial disasters" over the years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/retirement/article/108534/contrarian-investor-sees-economic-crash-in-china?mod=retire-planning Contrarian Investor Sees Economic Crash in China] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112054411/https://finance.yahoo.com/retirement/article/108534/contrarian-investor-sees-economic-crash-in-china?mod=retire-planning |date=12 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, research oriented short sellers were widely acknowledged for exposing the China stock frauds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alpert |first=Bill |url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111904113704576383892664177456.html?ru=yahoo&amp;mod=yahoobarrons |title=B.

Commentator [[Jim Cramer]] has expressed concern about short selling and started a petition calling for the reintroduction of the [[uptick rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestreet.com/petition |title=TheStreet |publisher=TheStreet |date= |accessdate=24 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315133930/http://www.thestreet.com/petition |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Books like ''Don't Blame the Shorts'' by [[Robert Sloan]] and ''Fubarnomics'' by [[Robert E. Wright]] suggest Cramer exaggerated the costs of short selling and underestimated the benefits, which may include the [[ex ante]] identification of [[asset]] [[Stock market bubble|bubble]]s.

Individual short sellers have been subject to criticism and even litigation. [[Manuel P. Asensio]], for example, engaged in a lengthy legal battle&lt;!--over what?--&gt; with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Hemispherx Biopharma.&lt;ref name='Forbes-Asensio'&gt;{{cite news | first=Brett | last=Nelson | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Short Story | date=26 November 2001 | publisher= | url =http://members.forbes.com/forbes/2001/1126/216.html | work =Forbes | pages = | accessdate = 9 August 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7558">'''Singmaster's conjecture''' is a [[conjecture]] in [[combinatorial number theory]] in [[mathematics]], named after the British mathematician [[David Singmaster]] who proposed it in 1971. It says that there is a finite [[upper bound]] on the [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicities]] of entries in [[Pascal's triangle]] (other than the number 1, which appears infinitely many times).  It is clear that the only number that appears infinitely many times in [[Pascal's triangle]] is 1, because any other number ''x'' can appear only within the first ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 rows of the triangle. 

==Statement==
Let ''N''(''a'') be the number of times the number ''a'' &gt; 1 appears in Pascal's triangle.  In [[big O notation]], the conjecture is:

:&lt;math&gt;N(a) = O(1).&lt;/math&gt;

==Known bound==

Singmaster (1971) showed that

:&lt;math&gt;N(a) = O(\log a).&lt;/math&gt;

Abbot, [[Paul Erdős|Erdős]], and Hanson (1974) (see [[#References|References]]) refined the estimate to:

:&lt;math&gt;N(a) = O\left(\frac{\log a}{\log \log a}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The best currently known (unconditional) bound is

:&lt;math&gt;N(a) = O\left(\frac{(\log a)(\log \log \log a)}{(\log \log a)^3}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

and is due to [[Daniel Kane (mathematician)|Kane]] (2007).  Abbot, Erdős, and Hanson note that conditional on [[Cramér's conjecture]] on gaps between consecutive primes that

:&lt;math&gt; N(a) = O\left( \log(a)^{2/3+\varepsilon}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

holds for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

Singmaster (1975) showed that the [[Diophantine equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;{n+1 \choose k+1} = {n \choose k+2}&lt;/math&gt;

has infinitely many solutions for the two variables ''n'', ''k''.  It follows that there are infinitely many triangle entries of multiplicity at least&amp;nbsp;6:  For any non-negative ''i'', a number ''a'' with six appearances in Pascal's triangle is given by either of the above two expressions with

:&lt;math&gt;n = F_{2i+2} F_{2i+3} - 1,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k = F_{2i} F_{2i+3} - 1,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''j''th [[Fibonacci number]] (indexed according to the convention that ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1). The above two expressions locate two of the appearances; two others appear symmetrically in the triangle with respect to those two; and the other two appearances are at &lt;math&gt;{a \choose 1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{a \choose a-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Elementary examples==

* 2 appears just once; all larger positive integers appear more than once;
* 3, 4, 5 each appear two times;
* all odd prime numbers appear two times;
* 6 appears three times;
* all numbers of the form &lt;math&gt;{p \choose 2}&lt;/math&gt; for prime &lt;math&gt;p&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; appear four times.
* Each of the following appears six times:
:: &lt;math&gt;120 = {120 \choose 1} ={120 \choose 119} = {16 \choose 2} ={16 \choose 14} = {10 \choose 3} ={10 \choose 7}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- deliberately added extra space --&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;210 = {210 \choose 1} ={210 \choose 209} = {21 \choose 2} ={21 \choose 19} = {10 \choose 4}={10 \choose 6}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- deliberately added extra space --&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;1540 = {1540 \choose 1} ={1540 \choose 1539} = {56 \choose 2} ={56 \choose 54} = {22 \choose 3} = {22 \choose 19}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- deliberately added extra space --&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;7140 = {7140 \choose 1} ={7140 \choose 7139} = {120 \choose 2} ={120 \choose 118} = {36 \choose 3} = {36 \choose 33}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- deliberately added extra space --&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;11628 = {11628 \choose 1} = {11628 \choose 11627} = {153 \choose 2} = {153 \choose 151} = {19 \choose 5} = {19 \choose 14}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- deliberately added extra space --&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;24310 = {24310 \choose 1} = {24310 \choose 24309} = {221 \choose 2} = {221 \choose 219} = {17 \choose 8} = {17 \choose 9}&lt;/math&gt;

* The smallest number to appear eight times – indeed, the only number known to appear eight times – is 3003, which is also a member of Singmaster's infinite family of numbers with multiplicity at least 6:

:: &lt;math&gt;3003 = {3003 \choose 1} = {78 \choose 2} = {15 \choose 5} = {14 \choose 6} = {14 \choose 8} = {15 \choose 10} = {78 \choose 76} = {3003 \choose 3002} &lt;/math&gt;

: The next number in Singmaster's infinite family, and the next smallest number known to occur six or more times, is 61218182743304701891431482520.

The number of times ''n'' appears in Pascal's triangle is
:∞, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, ... {{OEIS|id=A003016}}

By Abbott, Erdos, and Hanson (1974), the number of integers no larger than ''x'' that appear more than twice in Pascal's triangle is ''O''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;).

The smallest natural number (above&amp;nbsp;1) that appears (at least) ''n'' times in Pascal's triangle is
:2, 3, 6, 10, 120, 120, 3003, 3003, ... {{OEIS|id=A062527}}

The numbers which appear at least five times in Pascal's triangle are
:1, 120, 210, 1540, 3003, 7140, 11628, 24310, 61218182743304701891431482520, ... {{OEIS|id=A003015}}

Of these, the ones in Singmaster's infinite family are
:1, 3003, 61218182743304701891431482520, ... {{OEIS|id=A090162}}

==Open questions==

It is not known whether any number appears more than eight times, nor whether any number besides 3003 appears that many times.  The conjectured finite upper bound could be as small as 8, but Singmaster thought it might be 10 or&amp;nbsp;12.

Do any numbers appear exactly five or seven times?
It would appear from a related entry, {{OEIS|id=A003015}} in the [[Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]], that no one knows whether the equation ''N''(''a'') = 5 can be solved for&amp;nbsp;''a''. It is also unknown whether there is any number which appears seven times.

'''Susan Haack''' (born 1945) is a British philosopher. She is Distinguished Professor in the Humanities, Cooper Senior Scholar in Arts and Sciences, Professor of Philosophy, and Professor of Law at the University of Miami. She has written on [[logic]], the [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]], and [[metaphysics]]. Her [[pragmatism]] follows that of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].

==Career==
Haack is a graduate of the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]] (B.A., M.A., B.Phil, Oxford; Ph.D., Cambridge). She was elected into [[Phi Beta Kappa]] as an honorary member. At Oxford, she studied at [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St. Hilda's College]], where her first philosophy teacher was Jean Austin, the widow of [[J. L. Austin]]. As an undergraduate, she took [[Politics, Philosophy and Economics]] and said of her taste for philosophy: "initially, the 'politics' part that most appealed to me. But somewhere down the line, despite encouragement from my politics tutor to pursue that subject, philosophy took over."&lt;ref name="Carrier"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freethoughtblogs.com/carrier/archives/1207|title=Interview with Susan Haack|publisher=Richard Carrier Blogs|date=6 May 2012|accessdate=11 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509022732/http://freethoughtblogs.com/carrier/archives/1207|archivedate=9 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She studied [[Plato]] with [[Gilbert Ryle]] and logic with [[Michael Dummett]]. [[David Pears]] supervised her B.Phil. dissertation on [[ambiguity]]. At Cambridge, she wrote her PhD under the supervision of [[Timothy Smiley]]. She held the positions of Fellow of [[New Hall, Cambridge]] and professor of philosophy at the [[University of Warwick]] before taking her current position at the University of Miami.

Haack has said of her career that she is "very independent":
{{quote|rather than follow philosophical fads and fashions, I pursue questions I believe are important, and tackle them in the ways that seem most likely to yield results; I am beholden to no clique or citation cartel; I put no stock in the ranking of philosophy graduate programs over which my colleagues obsess; I accept no research or travel funds from my university; I avoid publishing in journals that insist on taking all the rights to my work; etc., etc. Naturally, this independence comes at a price; but it also earns me the freedom to do the best work I can, without self-censorship, and to communicate with a much wider audience than the usual "niche literature" does&lt;ref name="Carrier" /&gt;}}

==Ideas==
Haack's major contribution to philosophy, in the 1993 book ''Evidence and Inquiry'' is her [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory called [[foundherentism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aune | first1 = B. | title = Haack's ''Evidence and Inquiry''| journal = Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 627–632 | doi = 10.2307/2108389 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Flage | first1 = D. E. | title = Evidence and Inquiry: Towards Reconstruction in Epistemology | journal = The Review of Metaphysics | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 136–138 | doi =  10.2307/20129822| year = 1995 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fumerton | first1 = R. | title = Evidence and Enquiry | journal = The Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 48 | issue = 192 | pages = 409–412 | doi =  10.2307/2660334| year = 1998 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is her attempt to avoid the logical problems of both pure [[foundationalism]] (which is susceptible to infinite regress) and pure [[coherentism]] (which is susceptible to circularity). She illustrates this idea with the metaphor of the crossword puzzle.  A highly simplified version of this proceeds as follows: Finding an answer using a clue is analogous to a foundational source (grounded in [[empirical evidence]]). Making sure that the interlocking words are mutually sensible is analogous to justification through coherence. Both are necessary components in the justification of knowledge. At least one scholar has claimed that Haack's foundherentism collapses into foundationalism upon further inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tramel | first1 = P. | title = Haack’s foundherentism is a foundationalism | doi = 10.1007/s11229-006-9108-y | journal = Synthese | volume = 160 | issue = 2 | pages = 215–228 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haack has been a fierce critic of [[Richard Rorty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher = Blackwell |isbn = 0-631-11851-9 |publication-place = Oxford UK |title = Evidence and Inquiry |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL1398949M/Evidence_and_inquiry |first = Susan |last=Haack |year = 1993 |chapter=Ch. 9: Vulgar Pragmatism: an Unedifying Prospect}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=rorty |title=Richard Rorty}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote a play, ''We Pragmatists ...: [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] and [[Richard Rorty|Rorty]] in Conversation'', consisting entirely of quotes from both philosophers. She performed the role of Peirce. Haack published a vigorous essay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Haack |first=Susan |title=Vulgar Rortyism |date=November 1997 |work= |publisher=The New Criterion |url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/rortyism-haack-3261}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''[[New Criterion]]'', taking strong exception to many of Rorty's views, especially his claim to be a sort of pragmatist.

In ''Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate'', Haack is highly critical of the view that there is a specifically female perspective on logic and scientific truth and is critical of [[feminist epistemology]]. She holds that many feminist critiques of science and philosophy are excessively concerned with [[political correctness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Susan |last=Haack |title=Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate: Unfashionable Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ezeTXOlQngC |year=2000 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-31137-1 |origyear=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lynn Hankinson Nelson|title=The Very Idea of Feminist Epistemology|jstor=3810236|journal=Hypatia|volume=10|number=3|pages=31–49|year=1995|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1995.tb00736.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haack describes her 2003 book ''Defending Science – Within Reason: Between Scientism and Cynicism'', as a defence of scientific inquiry from the moderate viewpoint. During an interview with [[D.J. Grothe]], then of the [[Center for Inquiry]], Haack put forward the proposition that those on the far left consider science to be rhetoric motivated by power or politics, then proceeds to show how science can, and often does provide real benefits and gains, regardless of what the left may claim. Conversely, Haack argues the book is an attempt to make a sounder and solider defence of inquiry in light of some philosophers of science narrow logical models of rationality. Haack's opinion on the topic of inquiry, whoever may be undertaking it, is that good evidence, sound methods, transparent review and fitting new discovery into the collective sphere of human knowledge are signs of robust inquiry.  Haack claims that quality inquiry can be done by many, however the scientific community has numerous tools or helps that have brought many benefits to mankind, and which help foster science's credibility.  These tools and helps may not be available to those engaged in individual inquiry. When asked about how she responds to paranormal or supernatural claims, Haack indicates supporters of such claims have a heavy burden of proof. Rather than labelling such claims as pseudo-science, she admits these things can be "pretty bad stuff" and if they are to be considered seriously, they would need extraordinary evidence, and that such evidence should fit with the best warranted scientific theory about how things are.  In this interview Haack also responds to the question of religion's compatibility with science.  She agrees there is great tension between the two. While stating her disagreement with British philosopher of religion [[Richard G. Swinburne]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]], she referred to the pertinent chapter of her book for a comprehensive understanding of her views on this matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Susan|first=Haack|title=Interview with D.J Groeth|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/susan_haack_defending_science_within_reason/|publisher=Center for Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the related chapter ten of ''Defending Science'', Haack disagrees with Gould's claim that science and religion have their own distinct domains that do not overlap. (See [[Non-overlapping magisteria|NOMA]]). Haack also disagrees with Swinburne. Haack believes that while scientists, historians and detectives play a useful role in scientific inquiry, theologians do not. Haack shows how religion and science make claims about how the world is.  She shows how science and religion also make assertions as to what could lead to a better human condition. By these statements, Haack shows that religion and science do not enjoy their own separate space. She points out areas where prior and current religious claims about the natural universe are strongly refuted by the best warranted findings of science.  She also stipulates that controversy and unanswered questions abound in modern science. She summarises her defence for scientific inquiry by stating that she makes no apology for reserving her "greatest admiration for those who delight to exercise the mind, no matter which way it takes them…those for whom doing their damnedest with the mind, no holds barred, is a point of honor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haack|first=Susan|title=Defending Science – Within Reason: between Scientisim and Cynicism|year=2003|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Chapter 10 "And, In Conclusion"|isbn=1-59102-117-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has written for ''[[Free Inquiry]]'' magazine and the [[Council for Secular Humanism]]. Haack's work has been reviewed and cited in the popular press, such as ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' as well as in academic journals.

==Memberships==
Haack is an honorary member of [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]] and [[Phi Kappa Phi]], a past President of the [[Charles_Sanders_Peirce#CSPS|Charles S.

The '''Tumbuka language''' is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] which is spoken in the Northern Region of [[Malawi]] and also in the [[Lundazi]] district of [[Zambia]].&lt;ref name=Michigan&gt;[http://africa.isp.msu.edu/afrlang/Tumbuka_root.html Michigan State University African Studies Center information page].&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as Chitumbuka or Citumbuka — the ''chi-'' prefix in front of ''Tumbuka'' means "the language of", and is understood in this case to mean "the language of (the [[Tumbuka people]])". Tumbuka belongs to the same language group ([[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages#Zone N|Guthrie Zone N]]) as [[Chewa language|Chewa]] and [[Sena language|Sena]].&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), pp.21ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Almanac (1998) estimates that there are approximately 2,000,000 Tumbuka speakers, though other sources estimate a much smaller number. The majority of Tumbuka speakers are said to live in Malawi.&lt;ref name=Michigan /&gt; Tumbuka is the most widely spoken of the languages of Northern Malawi, especially in the [[Rumphi]], [[Mzuzu]], and [[Mzimba]] districts.&lt;ref&gt;University of Malawi (2006) Language Mapping Survey for Northern Malawi.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are substantial differences between the form of Tumbuka spoken in urban areas of Malawi (which borrows some words from [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Chewa language|Chewa]]) and the "village" or "deep" Tumbuka spoken in villages. The [[Rumphi]] variant is often regarded as the most "linguistically pure", and is sometimes called "real Tumbuka".&lt;ref&gt;Kamwendo (2004), p.282.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mzimba]] dialect has been strongly influenced by [[Zulu language|Zulu]] (chiNgoni),&lt;ref&gt;University of Malawi (2006), p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; even so far as to have [[click consonant|clicks]] in words like ''chitha'' {{IPA-xx|ʇʰitʰa|}} "urinate", which do not occur in other dialects.

The Tumbuka language suffered during the rule of President [[Hastings Banda|Hastings Kamuzu Banda]], since in 1968 as a result of his one-nation, one-language policy it lost its status as an official language in Malawi. As a result, Tumbuka was removed from the school curriculum, the national radio, and the print media.&lt;ref&gt;Kamwendo (2004), p.278.&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of multi-party democracy in 1994, Tumbuka programmes were started again on the radio, but the number of books and other publications in Tumbuka remains low.&lt;ref&gt;See Language Mapping Survey for Northern Malawi (2006), pp.38-40 for a list of publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tumbuka spelling==
Two systems of writing Tumbuka are in use: the traditional spelling (used for example in the Chitumbuka version of Wikipedia and in the newspaper ''Fuko''), in which words such as ''banthu'' 'people' and ''chaka'' 'year' are written with 'b' and 'ch', and the new official spelling (used for example in the Citumbuka dictionary published online by the Centre for Language Studies and in the online Bible), in which the same words are written with 'ŵ' and 'c', e.g. ''ŵanthu'' and ''caka''. (The sound 'ŵ' is a closely rounded [w] pronounced with the tongue in the close-i position.)&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Guy (1950) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1156786 "Suggestions for an Amended Spelling and Word Division of Nyanja"] ''Africa: Journal of the International African Institute'', Vol. 20, No. 3, p.205.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some uncertainty over where to write 'r' and where 'l', e.g. ''cakulya'' (Dictionary) or ''cakurya'' (Bible) 'food'. (In fact [l] and [r] are [[allophones]] of the same [[phoneme]].)

==Tumbuka nouns==
As is usual with Bantu languages, Tumbuka nouns are grouped into different noun classes according to their singular and plural prefixes. Each class of noun has its own adjective, pronoun, and verb agreements, known as 'concords'. Where the agreements disagree with the prefix, the agreements take precedence in deciding the class of noun. For example, the noun ''katundu'' 'possessions', despite having the prefix ''ka-'', is placed in class 1, since one says ''katundu uyu'' 'these possessions' using the class 1 demonstrative ''uyu''. Malawians themselves (e.g. in the University of Malawi's Citumbuka dictionary) refer to the noun classes by traditional names such as "Mu-Ŵa-"; Bantu specialists, however, refer to the classes by numbers (1/2 etc.) corresponding to the noun-classes of other Bantu languages. Occasionally nouns do not correspond to the classes below, e.g. ''fumu'' 'chief' (class 9) irregularly has a plural ''mafumu'' in class 6.

'''Class 1/2 (Mu-Ŵa-)'''

Some nouns in this class lack the prefix Mu-:
*Munthu pl. ŵanthu (banthu) = person
*Muzungu pl. ŵazungu (bazungu) = foreigner, white man
*Mwana pl. ŵana (bana) = child
*Bulu pl. ŵabulu = donkey
*Sibweni pl. ŵasibweni = maternal uncle
*Katundu (no pl.) = goods, possessions

'''Class 3/4 (Mu-Mi-)'''
*Mutu pl. mitu = head
*Mkuyu pl. mikuyu = fig-tree
*Moyo pl. miyoyo = life
*Mtima pl. mitima = heart

'''Class 5/6 (Li-Ma-)'''
*Bhele pl. mabhele = breast
*Bhoma pl. mabhoma = government, district
*Bhotolo pl. mabhotolo = bottle
*Fuko pl. mafuko = tribe, nation
*Jiso pl. maso = eye
*Maji (no singular) = water
*Phiri pl. mapiri = hill
*Suzgo pl. masuzgo = problem, trouble
*Woko pl. mawoko = hand

'''Class 7/8 (Ci-Vi-)'''
*Caka (chaka) pl. vyaka = year
*Caro (charo) pl. vyaro = country, land
*Ciŵeto (chibeto) pl. viŵeto (vibeto) = farm animal
*Cidakwa (chidakwa) pl. vidakwa = drunkard
*Cikoti (chikoti) pl. vikoti = whip

'''Class 9/10 (Yi-Zi-)'''
*Mbale pl. mbale (mambale) = plate
*Ndalama pl. ndalama = money
*Njelwa pl. njelwa = brick
*Nkhuku pl. nkhuku = chicken
*Somba pl. somba = fish

'''Class 11 (Lu-)'''

Some speakers treat words in this class as if they were in class 5/6.&lt;ref&gt;Shiozaki (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lwande = side
*Lumbiri = fame
*Lulime = tongue

'''Class 12/13 (Ka-Tu-)'''
*Kanthu(kantu) pl. tunthu(tuntu) = small thing
*Kamwana pl. tuŵana (tubana) = baby
*Kayuni pl. tuyuni = bird
*Tulo (no singular) = sleep

'''Class 14/6 (U-Ma-)'''

These nouns are frequently abstract and have no plural.
*Usiku = night
*Ulimi = farming
*Ulalo pl. maulalo = bridge
*Uta pl. mauta = bow

'''Class 15 (Ku-) Infinitive'''
*Kugula = to buy, buying
*Kwibha = to steal, stealing

'''Classes 16, 17, 18 (Pa-, Ku-, Mu-) Locative'''
*Pasi = underneath
*Kunthazi(kuntazi) = in front, before
*Mukati = inside

==Tumbuka concords==
Verbs, adjectives, numbers, possessives, and pronouns in Tumbuka have to agree with the noun referred to. This is done by means of prefixes or suffixes (called 'concords') which differ according to the class of noun. Class 1 has the greatest variety of concords, differing for pronouns, numbers, adjectives, verbs, and possessives:&lt;ref&gt;Chase (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shiozaki (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vail (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mwana u'''yu''' = this child
*Mwana '''yu'''moza = one child
*Mwana u'''yo''' = that child
*Mwana '''yo'''se = the whole child
*Mwana '''wa'''li'''yo'''se = every child
*Mwana '''wa'''ka'''mu'''wona = the child saw him
*Mwana '''mu'''choko (coko) = the small child
*Mwana '''wa''' Khumbo (Kumbo) = Khumbo's child
*Mwana '''wa'''ne = my child
*Mwana '''wa'''wona = the child has seen

Other noun classes have a smaller variety of concords, as can be seen from the table below:

== Linguistic descriptions ==
Some remarks on Tumbuka tenses can be found in Kiso (2012).

==Tumbuka tone==
Tumbuka has a [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] accent but in a very limited way, in that every word, spoken in isolation, has the same falling tone on the penultimate syllable (which also coincides with stress).&lt;ref&gt;Downing (2008, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore not possible in Tumbuka to contrast two different words or two different tenses tonally, as it is in [[Chewa language|Chichewa]] and other Bantu languages. However, this penultimate falling tone occurs not on every word, but only on the last word of a phonological phrase; e.g. in the following sentence, only the second word has a tone, the first being toneless:&lt;ref&gt;Downing (2012), p.123.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ti-ku-phika sî:ma'' 'we are cooking porridge'

A greater variety of tonal patterns is found in the [[ideophone]]s (expressive words) of Tumbuka; for example Low (''yoyoyo'' 'disintegrating into small pieces'), High (''fyá:'' 'swooping low (of birds)'), High-Low (''phúli'' 'sound of thing bursting'), and Low-High (''yií'' 'sudden disappearance'), etc.&lt;ref&gt;Moto (1999), pp.112-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intonational tones are also used in Tumbuka; for example, in yes-no questions there is often a High-Low fall on the final syllable of the question:&lt;ref&gt;Downing (2008), p.55.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ku-limirâ-so ngô:mâ?'' 'are you also weeding the maize?'

There does not seem to be any consistent, direct correlation between tone in Tumbuka and [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]].&lt;ref&gt;Downing (2012), p.129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==An example of Tumbuka==
An example of a folktale translated into Tumbuka and other languages of Northern Malawi is given in the Language Mapping Survey for Northern Malawi carried out by the Centre for Language Studies of the University of Malawi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unima-cls.org/Docs/MappingNorthernMalawi/lm-northernmalawi.pdf Language Mapping Survey], p. 60-64.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tumbuka version of the folktale goes as follows:

:KALULU NA FULU (Citumbuka)
:Fulu wakaluta kukapemphiska vyakulya ku ŵanthu. Pakuyeya thumba lake wakacita kukaka ku cingwe citali na kuvwara mu singo, ndipo pakwenda thumba lake likizanga kunyuma kwakhe.

:Wali mu nthowa, kalulu wakiza kunyuma kwakhe ndipo wakati “bowo, thumba lane!” Fulu wakati, "Thumba ndane iwe, wona cingwe ici ndakaka sono nkhuguza pakwenda.” Kalulu wakakana nipera, ndipo wakati “Tilute ku Mphala yikateruzge.” Mphala yikadumula mlandu na kuceketa cingwe ico Fulu wakakakira thumba. Ŵakatola thumba lira ndipo ŵakapa kalulu.

:Pa zuŵa linyakhe Kalulu wakendanga, Fulu wakamsanga ndipo wakati, “Bowo, mcira wane!” Kalulu wakati, “Ake! Fulu iwe m’cira ngwane.” Fulu wakakana, ndipo wakati, “Ndasola ngwane.” Ŵakaluta ku mphala, kuti yikaŵeruzge. Ku Mphala kula mlandu ukatowera Fulu. Ŵakadumula m’cira wa Kalulu nakupa Fulu.

:(Translation)
:THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE
:Tortoise went to beg food from people. To carry his bag, he tied it to a long string and wore it round his neck. As he walked along, the bag was coming behind him.

:As he was on his way, Hare came up behind him and said, "There it is, my bag!" Tortoise said "The bag is mine, see this string I've tied now I'm pulling it as I go." Hare refused to accept this and said "Let's go the Court, it will judge us." The Court examined the case and cut Tortoise's string which he'd tied the bag with. They took that bag and gave it to Hare. 

:Another day when Hare was walking along, Tortoise found him and said, "There it is, my tail!" Hare said, "Nonsense, this is my tail, Tortoise." Tortoise refused to accept this and said, "What I've got is mine." They went to the Court so that it could make a judgement. In that Court, the case went in Tortoise's favour. They cut off Hare's tail and gave it to Tortoise.

'''Note I:''' The ligatures {{Hebrew|1=&lt;span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',David,Narkisim,Rod"&gt;&amp;#x05f0; &amp;#x05f1; &amp;#x05f2;&lt;/span&gt;}} are intended for [[Yiddish]]. They are not used in Hebrew.&lt;br&gt;
'''Note II:''' The symbol {{Hebrew|&amp;#x05f4;}} is called a [[gershayim]] and is a punctuation mark used in the Hebrew language to denote acronyms. It is written before the last letter in the acronym.  Gershayim is also the name of a note of cantillation in the reading of the [[Torah]], printed above the accented letter.

Remaining graphs are in the Alphabetic Presentation Forms block:

'''Note:''' In [[Yiddish orthography]] only, the glyph, ''{{transl|he|[[yodh#Hebrew Yud|yud]]-[[hiriq#Vowel Length comparison|ḥiriq]]}}'' ({{Hebrew|&amp;#xfb1d;}}), pronounced {{IPA|/i/}}, can be optionally used, rather than typing ''{{transl|he|yud}}'' then ''{{transl|he|ḥiriq}}'' ({{Hebrew|&amp;#x5d9;&amp;#x5b4;}}). In [[Hebrew spelling]] this would be pronounced {{IPA|/ji/}}.&amp;nbsp; {{IPA|/i/}} is written ''{{transl|he|ḥiriq}}'' then ''{{transl|he|yud}}'' ({{Hebrew|&amp;#x202f;&amp;#x5b4;&amp;#x5d9;}}).

'''Note''': [[Character encodings in HTML#HTML character references|HTML numeric character references]] can be in decimal format (&amp;amp;#''DDDD'';) or hexadecimal format (&amp;amp;#x''HHHH'';).  For example, &amp;amp;#1490; and &amp;amp;#x05D2; (1490 in hexadecimal) both represent U+05D2 HEBREW LETTER GIMEL.

==Books authored==
[[William Dwight Whitney|Whitney]]'s principal target in accusing [[Pāṇini]] and Pāṇiniyas of unreliability was the [[Dhatupatha]]. He set forth his views that of nearly 2000 roots of [[Dhatupatha]] published by Westergaard and Bohtlingk more than half of these are not attested in literature. The most ambitious work in the direction noted is ''Pāniniya Dhātupātha Samikşhā''(1965) wherein the author gives an alphabetically arranged catalogue of roots found in different [[Dhatupatha]]s together with attestation – verbal and nominal forms – in [[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]], [[Apabhramsa]] and other [[Prakrit]]s. BPT Vagish Shastri professed aim is to refute [[William Dwight Whitney|Whitney]]'s Claim.&lt;ref&gt;George Cardona, PANINI, A survey of Research, Mouton &amp; Co. B.V. Publisher, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit Pratibha, Sahitya Academy, New Delhi, Vol. 8, No.2, 1970, pp. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.N. Dandekar, Vedic Bibliography, Vol. III, Govt. Oriental Series No.10, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, [[Poona]], 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The radio drama ''Krişakānām Nāgpāshah'' is a symbolic play with the tone and tenor of patriotism which aims at common harmony, pride in one's own nation, and sacrifice for one's motherland which is highly relevant. This is a creative work from the vibrant pen of BPT Vagish Shastri.&lt;ref&gt;S. Ranganath, ''Studies in Rigveda and modern Sanskrit literature'',Eastern Book Linkers, Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1208">'''Vine pull schemes''' are programs whereby [[grape]] growers receive a financial incentive to pull up their grape [[vine]]s, a process known as ''arrachage'' in French. A large program of this kind was initiated by the [[European Union]] ([[European Union|EU]]) in 1988 to reduce the [[wine lake]] glut from [[overproduction]] and declining demand. In the first five years of the program, growers, mainly in southern France and southern Italy, were paid to destroy 320,000 hectares or {{convert|790400|acre|km2}} of [[vineyard]]. This was the equivalent to the entire vineyard area of the world’s fourth largest grower of grapes, the United States. The EU has recently resumed a vine pull scheme and [[Plan Bordeaux]] proposes additional vine pulls to increase prices for generic [[Bordeaux wine]].

It is believed that this has contributed to the "global wine shortage". Research by America's Morgan Stanley financial services firm says demand for wine "exceeded supply by 300m cases in 2012".

He was behind the reissue of the French-Latin dictionary by [[Louis Marie Quicherat|Quicherat]] and Daveluy.

Holder of the chair of paleography at the École Pratique des Hautes Études from its origins, he became interested in manuscripts of the late antiquity and the early Middle Ages and especially the best represented writing, the [[Uncial script]] and the [[palimpsest]]s. 
Under the influence of one of his listeners, Paul Legendre, he devoted considerable research to the use of [[Tironian notes]].&lt;ref&gt;Denis Muzerelle, « Un siècle de paléographie latine en France », dans Armando Petrucci et Alessandro Pratesi, ''Un Secolo di paleografia e diplomatica (1887-1986), per il centenario dell’Istituto di paleografia dell’Università di Roma'', Roma, Gela, 1988, (p.&amp;nbsp;131–158), at page 136&lt;/ref&gt;
