'''Advanced Placement European History''' (commonly known as '''AP Modern European History''', '''AP Euro''', '''AP European''', '''APEH''', or '''MEHAP'''), is  a course and examination offered by the [[College Board]] through the [[Advanced Placement Program]]. This course is for [[high school]] students who are interested in a first year [[university]] level course in European history. The course surveys [[European history]] from between 1300-1450 CE to the present,&lt;ref&gt;{https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-european-history-course-and-exam-description.pdf} Retrieved on February 12, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on religious, social, economic, and political themes. In the [[United States]], the course is usually taken in [[sophomore]] year of [[high school]].

==The exam==
The [[Advanced Placement Exams|AP exam]] for European History is divided into two sections, comprising 55 multiple-choice questions (with four answer choices), three short-answer questions, and two essay responses (one thematic Long Essay Question (LEQ) and one [[Document Based Question]] (DBQ)).&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-european-history-course-and-exam-description.pdf European History Course Description] retrieved on September 7, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  The multiple-choice and short-answer sections are to be completed in 55 minutes and 40 minutes respectively.  The essay section is to be completed in 100 minutes (including the mandated 15-minute reading period). The DBQ is graded out of 7 points and the LEQ is graded out of 6 points. This new structure went into effect beginning Fall 2017.
The exam grade is weighted evenly between the multiple-choice and free-response sections.  The DBQ is weighted at 25 percent while the FRQ/LEQ is weighted at 15 percent.  The Short Answer is weighted 20 percent. Approximately half of the multiple-choice questions cover the period from 1450 to the [[French Revolution]] and [[Napoleonic era]], and half cover the period from the French Revolution and Napoleonic era to the present, evenly divided between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  About one-third of the questions focus on [[Cultural history|cultural]] and [[Intellectual history|intellectual]] themes, one-third on [[Political history|political]] and [[Diplomatic history|diplomatic]] themes, and one-third on [[Social history|social]] and [[Economic history|economic]] themes. Many questions draw on knowledge of more than one chronological period or theme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/members/exam/exam_questions/2085.html European History Exam Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Although this is the general trend based on past AP Exams, it is not mandated that the exam follow this format. In recent years and present, the multiple choice portion is Stimulus Based, meaning the students are given an excerpt of a speech or writing, photograph, or painting, to analyze and answer questions and/or give presentations on the given info.

'''''A proper dyaloge betwene a Gentilman and a Husbandman eche complaynynge to other their miserable calamite through the ambicion of the clergye''''' was printed in two versions by "[[Hans Luft]]" (i.e., [[Johannes Hoochstraten]]) of [[Antwerp]] in 1529. This book appears in Robert Steele's list of books banned in Henry's reign; Steele refers to it as "Dialogue between gentleman &amp; plowman." While clearly in the [[Piers Plowman Tradition]], Piers does not appear as a character. The first version has a 684 line acrostic poem opening and dialogue that was written in the sixteenth-century invention. Following this, there is an authentic, late fourteenth-century [[Lollard]] anti-clerical text, written ca. 1375-85. (It is included in Matthew, ed. ''The English Works of Wyclif''.) To all this, the second version adds another prose tract probably from the late fifteenth century, which argues in favor of vernacular Bible translations. 

The dialogue begins with the gentleman lamenting how his class has fallen low and is unable to help the poor, because long ago they were fooled into giving their lands and wealth to the church. The husbandman then argues for confiscating the possessions of a corrupt clergy which preys upon the poor. Belief in [[purgatory]] and [[indulgences]] is singled out as the favorite swindle of the clergy, who are ultimately to blame for rising rents. The husbandman suggests taking the issue to parliament (the 1529 "Reformation Parliament"), but the gentleman demurs, alluding to [[Simon Fish]]'s ''[[A Supplicacyon for the Beggers]]'' and [[Thomas More]]'s rebuttal and defense of purgatory in ''[[The Supplycacyon of Soulys]]'' (1529). [[John I of England|King John]], [[Sir John Oldcastle]], and [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] are listed as good men who came to bad ends for opposing the clergy. Then there is an allusion to the burning of [[William Tyndale]]'s [[New Testament]] in 1526 and [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s persecution of Lollards. To defend [[Lutherans]] and opposition to clerical possessions from charges of "newfangledness," the husbandman introduces what he takes to be a century-old treatise; i.e., a late-fourteenth-century Lollard text that supports disendowment of the clergy and barring them from secular offices. (The husbandman places it in the time of Richard II.)

    Now I promyse the after my iudgement
    I haue not hard of soche an olde fragment
    Better groundyd on reason with Scripture.
    Yf soche auncyent thynges myght come to lyght
    That noble men hadde ones of theym a syght
    The world yet wolde chaunge perauenture
    For here agaynst the clergye cannot bercke
    Sayenge as they do thys is a newe wercke
    Of heretykes contryued lately.
    And by thys treatyse it apperyth playne
    That before oure dayes men did compleyne
    Agaynst clerkes ambycyon so stately.

The "I" of the husbandman at this point leads into the "I" of the Lollard treatise which is attached at the end with little done to make a transition; it is revised to function as contemporary anti-Roman polemic.

'''All India Bakchod Knockout''' (abbreviated as '''AIB Knockout''') was a [[Roast (comedy)|roast]] comedy show that was held in Mumbai by [[All India Bakchod]] starring [[Ranveer Singh]] and [[Arjun Kapoor]] as the roast and [[Karan Johar]] as the host (roast master). The show, uploaded on [[YouTube]], went viral on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sunitra Pacheco|title=AIB knockout: Twitterati divided on Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor’s ‘roast’-ing|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/twitterati-divided-on-ranveer-singh-and-arjun-kapoors-aib-knockout/|accessdate=3 February 2015|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was held at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium in [[Worli]], [[Mumbai]] on December 20 2014 and was uploaded on [[YouTube]] on 28 January 2015. The episode, (popularly known as webisode) was made available in three parts; where at the beginning of the first part; viewers are warned about the nature of the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Dipti Singh|author2=Rohit Alok|title=AIB Knockout: As video goes viral, Vinod Tawde orders probe into ‘abusive’ content|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/as-video-goes-viral-tawde-orders-probe-into-abusive-aib-knockout-event/|accessdate=3 February 2015|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=3 February 2015|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 February 2015, AIB Knockout was removed from [[YouTube]] by [[All India Bakchod|AIB]] team due to the mounting controversies surrounding the show. While removing, AIB team tweeted, "Have taken down AIB Knockout for now. We will speak soon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Rashmi Mishra|title=AIB Knockout Roast video removed from YouTube for now!

== Controversies ==
[[Mumbai Police]] received several complaints about the usage of abusive language. FIR was then filed by Mumbai Police against the organisers for the show without acquiring any performance license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nithya Nair|title=The joke is on AIB Knockout roast: #AIBNationalShame trends on Twitter|url=http://www.india.com/showbiz/the-joke-is-on-aib-knockout-roast-aibnationalshame-trends-on-twitter-268611/|website=3 February 2015|publisher=India.com|accessdate=3 February 2015|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Minister of Maharashtra, [[Devendra Fadnavis]] warned about action if the show was found to be vulgar and in violation of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Action would be taken if 'AIB Knockout' has violated laws: Devendra Fadnavis|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/action-would-be-taken-if-aib-knockout-has-violated-laws-devendra-fadnavis/15961194|accessdate=3 February 2015|work=[[Mid Day]]|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]|date=3 February 2015|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIR was filed against 14 persons, including filmmaker Karan Johar and actors Arjun Kapoor and Ranveer Singh in [[Pune]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AIB Knockout: FIR against Karan Johar, Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor in Pune|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/aib-knockout-fir-against-karan-johar-ranveer-singh-arjun-kapoor-in-pune/|accessdate=6 February 2015|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=5 February 2015|location=Pune}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Mumbai court also directed the police to file FIRs against the organisers and prominent participants mainly citing the violation of the Indian Penal code dealing with conspiracy and obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIB Roast: Court orders FIR against Ranveer, Deepika, Arjun, Alia, Karan Johar and 9 others|url=http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/aib-knockout-court-orders-fir-against-ranveer-deepika-arjun-alia-karan-johar-and-9-others-2095449.html|publisher=FirstPost.com|accessdate=1 March 2015|date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aamir Khan]] criticized Karan Johar (despite having not seen the video) for participating in the show, adding especially when his mother was sitting in first row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sonal Gera|author2=Sarika Sharma|title=AIB Roast: Salman Khan upset with Karan Johar?|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/aib-roast-shah-rukh-khan-salman-khan-upset-with-karan-johar/|accessdate=1 March 2015|work=The Indian Express|date=6 February 2015|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanjay Leela Bhansali]] also expressed his disapproval to the video as he found it "cheap" and wanted the actors (participants) to behave themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sonal Gera|author2=Sarika Sharma|title=AIB Knockout: Sanjay Leela Bhansali finds Ranveer Singh’s roast ‘cheap’|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/aib-knockout-sanjay-leela-bhansali-finds-arjun-kapoor-ranveer-singhs-roast-cheap/|accessdate=1 March 2015|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=27 February 2015|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the show containing several religious comments, AIB Team also offered an unconditional apology to the archdiocese and the Christian community for any offence caused to religious sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AIB Roast: Comedy group tenders unconditional apology to Christian community|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-aib-roast-comedy-group-tenders-unconditional-apology-to-religious-communities-2059463|accessdate=10 March 2015|work=[[DNA India]]|agency=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apology came after several Christian organisations filling complaints against the use of insulting jokes on Jesus Christ and Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Anjali Lukose|title=AIB team meets city Christian clergy, says sorry|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-others/aib-apologises-to-christian-community/|accessdate=10 March 2015|work=The Indian Express|date=10 February 2015|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bollywood director producer [[Karan Johar]] on 9 January 2016, received summons from Mumbai Police to record his statement in connection with the event that took place in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AIB Roast Controversy: Karan Johar summoned by Mumbai Police|url=http://www.india.com/showbiz/aib-roast-controversy-karan-johar-summoned-deepika-padukone-ranveer-singh-arjun-kapoor-next-848043/|accessdate=9 January 2016|publisher=[[india.com]]|date=January 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Aritra Hazra|title=Karan Johar gets summons in AIB case|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/karan-johar-gets-summons-in-aib-case-ranveer-and-deepika-next/story-nXUTuICEhUiNTFJ5WftuxH.html|accessdate=9 January 2016|publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=January 9, 2016|location=Mumbai|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
Many came out in support of AIB and the notion of free speech. The makers of ''Qtiyapa'', [[The Viral Fever]], in a video on YouTube aired their opinions on online democracy, freedom of expression and audiences' liberty to choose from variety of content online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No funny business: The Viral Fever and other comedians support AIB Knockout|url=http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/no-funny-business-tvf-backs-aib-says-dont-kill-ideas-with-fear-2081273.html|accessdate=7 February 2015|work=The Indian Express|date=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russell Peters]], a Canadian comedian of Indian origin, panned Aamir Khan's criticism to the roast. In reply to Aamir Khan, Peters quoted, "Seriously, who is he, the so-called artist, to say that he found it violent and that AIB and rest involved should have been responsible? He did not even see it! Someone please ask him to shut up and take care of his own business. He is an actor; not even a real artist. He goes in front of the camera and reads out lines that someone else has written. Then, he is giving his opinion about something that is honest!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sonal Gera|author2=Sarika Sharma|title=AIB Roast: Comedian Russell Peters asks Aamir Khan to ‘shut up’|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/aib-roast-comedian-russell-peters-asks-aamir-khan-to-shut-up/|accessdate=17 February 2015|work=[[The Indian Express]]|agency=17 February 2015|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khan further clarified his stand on this issue; he said, “I respect everyone’s opinion. For me freedom of speech and expression is an important right and should be protected at all costs. But I also feel that freedom comes with responsibility which should be self-exercised. It’s unfortunate that caught between the rightwing fascists and the ‘no-holdsbarred’ faction, the moderates are in danger of losing their voice. I’m aware that if you sign up for the Roast, you sign up to insult each other. But, in this case, even those who hadn’t signed up were being targeted, like Farida Jalal, Reema Lagoo and a beautiful, young girl I love dearly.
The young girl whom I’ve known since she was a kid, was the butt of racist and sexist jokes. She did not even know that a live audience was watching this and couldn’t protect herself. That is unfair! This is what I meant when I described the show as “violent”. Films which depict violence are fictional but this young girl is real. So my reaction was more emotional than moralistic.
I wasn’t objecting to the use of expletives or adult jokes. If two consenting adults wish to insult each other, that’s their problem. But you can’t go around attacking anyone you feel like. That is no different from the physical violence we see around us and object to. And when someone uses the words “shut up”, it makes me believe that these people are certainly not a part of the group that is for freedom of speech.”

In response to Aamir Khan's statements, [[Anurag Kashyap]] posted a link on his Facebook page where Aamir had spoken in defence of the DK Bose song from the movie Delhi Belly (produced by Aamir Khan). Aamir had said, "I have already informed my audiences that it is an adult film. Please do not go with your kids and those who have a problem with this kind of language shouldn't come either. I try my best to inform the audiences before-hand. Then they can decide themselves. If the audience is adult, they can decide themselves. So from my end I do all these things for my fans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/bollywood/after-aamir-khans-aib-roast-putdown-anurag-kashyap-reminds-us-of-delhi-belly-738811|title=After Aamir Khans aib roast putdown anurag kashyap reminds us of delhi belly|date= 11 February 2015|work=ABP News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shah Rukh Khan]] has stated that he would not like to take sides saying that humour has always been a tricky thing and it always generates different reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AIB Roast: Shah Rukh Khan would not like to take sides in the controversy|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/aib-roast-shah-rukh-khan-would-not-like-to-take-sides-in-the-controversy/|accessdate=1 March 2015|work=The Indian Express|agency=Press Trust of India|date=21 February 2015|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian-actor [[Vir Das]] along with the Comedy Nights With Kapil stars [[Sunil Grover]] (popularly known as Gutthi) and [[Kiku Sharda]] (known as Palak) have condemned the filing of an FIR against the celebs or makers involved in it. All three of them are of the opinion that the humour may be good or bad, but the freedom of expression should not be restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Subhash K Jha|title=India's comedy actors defend the Roast|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-india-s-comedy-actors-defend-the-roast-2061485|accessdate=27 February 2015|work=[[Daily News and Analysis]]|date=17 February 2015|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As per a report on Bollywoodlife.com, Sanjay Leela Bhansali is not very happy about Ranveer Singh's involvement in the AIB Knockout roast. Ranveer, who was then shooting for Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Bajirao Mastani, got an earful from the director, the report stated. Further to the report, Bhansali also advised Ranveer to behave like Salman and Shah Rukh and not like a 'chichora'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/AIB-Knockout-Roast-Celebrities-react-to-the-controversy/photostory/46393433.cms|title=AIB Knockout Roast: Celebrities react to the controversy|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4360">[[File:First Folio.jpg|thumb|The works of English playwright [[:en:William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]] are considered by many  to be among the highest achievements in Western art.]]
'''Artistic merit''' is the perceived  artistic quality or value of any given [[work of art]], music, film, literature, sculpture or painting. The term can be applied to a [[classic]] or [[masterpiece]] which has stood the test of time and is part of the [[Western canon]].

== Measures of merit==
In Western Europe from around 1500 to 1870, artistic merit was closely related to faithfulness to nature—though not always as literal, precise transcription but certainly as an interest in some aspect of the physical world—and sometimes narrative coherence (in many cases [[history painting]] was considered the highest form of art) and obedience to classical precepts. Such criteria, however, waned with the rise of [[modernism]] and later [[postmodernism]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

There is no correlation between literary merit and product sales. The [[erotic romance]] ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' has sold over 125 million copies worldwide despite being poorly written according to literary critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stedman|first1=Alex|title='Fifty Shades' Spinoff 'Grey' Copy Reportedly Stolen From Publisher|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/fifty-shades-spinoff-grey-stolen-from-publisher-1201516843/|website=Variety|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' has been critically acclaimed for its symbolism, plot, and character development, and has sold only approximately 14 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chilton|first1=Martin|title=The Grapes of Wrath: 10 surprising facts about John Steinbeck's novel|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/john-steinbeck-grapes-of-wrath-what-you-should-know/|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Obscenity and literary merit==

At the trial of James Joyce's novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' in 1921, though not required to do so by law, Quinn the lawyer for the defence decided to produce three literary experts to attest to the literary merits of ''Ulysses'', as well as ''The Little Review''’s broader reputation.&lt;ref&gt;de Grazia 10&lt;/ref&gt; The first expert witness was [[Philip Moeller]], of the [[Theatre Guild]], who interpreted ''Ulysses'' using the [[Freudian]] method of unveiling the subconscious mind, which prompted one of the judges to ask him to "speak in a language that the court could understand".&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Anderson 220&lt;/ref&gt; The next witness was [[Scofield Thayer]], editor of ''[[The Dial]]'', another literary magazine of the time, who "was forced to admit that if he had had the desire to publish ''Ulysses'' he would have consulted a lawyer first—and not published it".&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; The final witness was English novelist, lecturer, and critic [[John Cowper Powys]], who declared that ''Ulysses'' was a "beautiful piece of work in no way capable of corrupting the minds of young girls".&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

There was another important obscenity trial in 1960 Britain, when the full unexpurgated edition of [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' was published by [[Penguin Books]]. The [[R v Penguin Books Ltd.|trial of Penguin]] under the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959]] was a major public event and a test of the new [[obscenity]] law. The 1959 act (introduced by [[Roy Jenkins]]) had made it possible for publishers to escape conviction if they could show that a work was of literary merit. Several academic critics and experts of diverse kinds, including [[E. M. Forster]], [[Helen Gardner (critic)|Helen Gardner]], [[Richard Hoggart]], [[Raymond Williams]] and [[Norman St John-Stevas]], were called as witnesses, and the verdict, delivered on 2 November 1960, was "not guilty".&lt;ref&gt;Feather, John. ''A History Of British Publishing''. p. 205; Rolph, C. H, ed. (1990). ''The Trial of Lady Chatterley'' (2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a far greater degree of freedom for publishing explicit sexual material in the United Kingdom.

In '''Breath of Life workshops''', linguists help members of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American communities]] access and use archival material documenting their ancestral languages in the interest of language restoration and revitalization. 
This is particularly important for the many communities that no longer have fluent speakers of their languages. They are held biannually in June at [[U.C. Berkeley]] and at the [[University of Oklahoma]] in Norman in even-numbered years, and at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, DC in odd-numbered years. The project was initiated in the early 1990s at the [[University of California Berkeley]], in part by linguist [[Leanne Hinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gugliotta|first=Guy|title=Smithsonian archives preserve lost and dying languages|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/smithsonian-archives-preserve-lost-and-dying-languages/2014/01/17/2a2c3218-74a1-11e3-8b3f-b1666705ca3b_story.html|accessdate=24 January 2014|newspaper=Washington Post|date=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norman, Oklahoma==

The '''British Museum''', located in the [[Bloomsbury]] area of [[London]], in the [[United Kingdom]], is a public institution dedicated to [[human history]], art and culture. Its permanent collection numbers some 8 million works,&lt;ref name="britishmuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/management/about_us.aspx |title=About us |work=British Museum |accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is among the [[list of largest art museums|largest]] and most comprehensive in existence&lt;ref name="britishmuseum.org"/&gt; having been widely sourced during the era of the [[British Empire]], and documenting the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Sculptures and applied art are in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the British Museum houses earlier art, non-Western art, prints and drawings, and art of a later date is at [[Tate Modern]].

The British Museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the [[Irish people|Irish]] physician and scientist [[Sir Hans Sloane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/events/the-life-and-curiosity-of-hans-sloane|title=The Life and Curiosity of Hans Sloane|website=The British Library|language=en|access-date=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It first opened to the public on 15 January 1759, in [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], on the site of the current building. Its expansion over the following two and a half centuries was largely a result of expanding [[British Empire|British colonisation]] and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, the first being the British Museum (Natural History) – now the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] – in 1881.

In 1973, the British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the British Museum, but it continued to host the now separated [[British Library]] in the same [[British Museum Reading Room|Reading Room]] and building as the museum until 1997. The museum is a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]], and as with all other national museums in the United Kingdom it charges no admission fee, except for loan exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/visiting/admission_and_opening_times.aspx|title=Admission and opening times|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its ownership of some of its most famous objects originating in other countries is disputed and remains the subject of international controversy, most notably in the case of the [[Parthenon Marbles]].&lt;ref name="looted art"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jun/29/museums-looting-art-artefacts-world-culture|title=Museums and looted art: the ethical dilemma of preserving world cultures|last=Tharoor|first=Kanishk|date=29 June 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Sir Hans Sloane ===
[[File:Sir Hans Sloane, an engraving from a portrait by T. Murray.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sir Hans Sloane]]]]

Although today principally a museum of cultural art objects and [[Ancient history|antiquities]], the British Museum was founded as a "universal museum". Its foundations lie in the will of the [[Irish people|Irish]] physician and naturalist [[Sir Hans Sloane]] (1660–1753), who was a London-based doctor and scientist from [[Ulster]]. During the course of his lifetime Sloane gathered an enviable [[cabinet of curiosities|collection of curiosities]] and, not wishing to see his collection broken up after death, he bequeathed it to [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]], for the nation, for a sum of £20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fathom.com/course/21701728/session1.html| title=Creating a Great Museum: Early Collectors and The British Museum| publisher=Fathom| accessdate=4 July 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102202555/http://www.fathom.com/course/21701728/session1.html| archivedate=2 January 2010| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, Sloane's collection consisted of around 71,000 objects of all kinds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/history/general_history.aspx| title=General history| work=British Museum| date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including some 40,000 printed books, 7,000 [[manuscript]]s, extensive natural history specimens including 337 volumes of dried plants, [[Old master print|prints]] and drawings including those by [[Albrecht Dürer]] and antiquities from [[Kingdom of Kush|Sudan]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], the [[Ancient Near East|Ancient Near]] and [[East Asia|Far East]] and the [[History of the Americas|Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;Gavin R de Beer, Sir Hans Sloane and the British Museum (London, 1953).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation (1753)===
On 7 June 1753, [[George II of Great Britain and Ireland|King George II]] gave his [[Royal Assent]] to the [[Act of Parliament]] which established the British Museum.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|1=By the Act of Parliament it received a name – the British Museum. The origin of the name is not known; the word 'British' had some resonance nationally at this period, so soon after the Jacobite rebellion of 1745; it must be assumed that the museum was christened in this light.&lt;ref&gt;The question of the use of the term 'British' at this period has recently received some attention, e.g. Colley (1992), 85ff. There never has been a serious attempt to change the museum's name.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The [[British Museum Act 1753]] also added two other libraries to the Sloane collection, namely the [[Cotton library|Cottonian Library]], assembled by [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Sir Robert Cotton]], dating back to [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] times, and the [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Harleian Library]], the collection of the [[Earl of Oxford|Earls of Oxford]]. They were joined in 1757 by the "Old Royal Library", now the [[Royal manuscripts, British Library|Royal manuscripts]], assembled by various [[British monarchy|British monarchs]]. Together these four "foundation collections" included many of the most treasured books now in the [[British Library]]&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Charles Long (1823), BMCE115/3,10. Scrapbooks and illustrations of the Museum. (Wilson, David, M.) (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, pg 346&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] and the sole surviving manuscript of ''[[Beowulf]]''.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;The estimated footage of the various libraries as reported to the trustees has been summarised by Harris (1998), 3,6: Sloane 4,600, Harley 1,700, Cotton 384, Edwards 576, The Royal Library 1,890.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The North Prospect of Mountague House JamesSimonc1715.jpg|thumb|right|[[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], c. 1715]]

The British Museum was the first of a new kind of museum – national, belonging to neither church nor king, freely open to the public and aiming to collect everything. Sloane's collection, while including a vast miscellany of objects, tended to reflect his scientific interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bmimages.com/preview.asp?image=00032676001&amp;imagex=90&amp;searchnum=0001| title=The British Museum Images| publisher=Bmimages| accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of the [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Cotton]] and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Harley manuscripts]] introduced a literary and [[antiquarian]] element and meant that the British Museum now became both [[National Museum]] and [[library]].&lt;ref name="world and its people"&gt;{{cite book| last=Dunton| first=Larkin|title=The World and Its People| publisher=Silver, Burdett|year=1896|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabinet of curiosities (1753–78)===
[[File:Rosetta Stone International Congress of Orientalists ILN 1874.jpg|thumb|The [[Rosetta Stone]] on display in the British Museum in 1874]]
The body of trustees decided on a converted 17th-century mansion, [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], as a location for the museum, which it bought from the [[Ralph Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu|Montagu family]] for £20,000. The trustees rejected Buckingham House, on the site now occupied by [[Buckingham Palace]], on the grounds of cost and the unsuitability of its location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=David, M.|year=2002|title=The British Museum: A History|location=London|publisher=The British Museum Press|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;This was perhaps rather unfortunate as the title to the house was complicated by the fact that part of the building had been erected on leasehold property (the Crown lease of which ran out in 1771); perhaps that is why [[George III]] paid such a modest price (nominally £28,000) for what was to become Buckingham Palace. See [[Howard Colvin]]''et al.'' (1976), 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the acquisition of Montagu House, the first exhibition galleries and [[Library|reading room]] for scholars opened on 15 January 1759.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The British Museum opened on January 15th, 1759|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/british-museum-opened|date=January 2009|volume=59|issue=1|magazine=[[History Today]]|last=Cavendish|first=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the largest parts of collection were the library, which took up the majority of the rooms on the ground floor of Montagu House and the natural history objects, which took up an entire wing on the second state storey of the building. In 1763, the trustees of the British Museum, under the influence of [[Peter_Collinson_(botanist)|Peter Collinson]] and [[William_Watson_(scientist)|William Watson]], employed the former student of [[Carl Linnaeus]], [[Daniel Solander]] to reclassify the natural history collection according to the Linnaean system, thereby making the Museum a public centre of learning accessible to the full range of European natural historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=ED|title=Specimens, slips and systems: Daniel Solander and the classification of nature at the world's first public museum, 1753–1768.|journal=British Journal for the History of Science|volume=51|issue=2|date=15 April 2018|pages=1–33|doi=10.1017/S0007087418000249|pmid=29655387}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1823, King George IV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/the_museums_story/kings_library.aspx | title=British Museum - King's Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave the [[King's Library]] assembled by George III, and Parliament gave the right to a copy of every book published in the country, thereby ensuring that the museum's library would expand indefinitely. During the few years after its foundation the British Museum received several further gifts, including the [[Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts]] and [[David Garrick]]'s library of 1,000 printed plays. The predominance of natural history, books and manuscripts began to lessen when in 1772 the museum acquired for £8,410 its first significant antiquities in [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]]'s "first" collection of [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]].&lt;ref name="Hoock2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoock|first1=Holger|title=Empires of the Imagination: Politics, War and the Arts in the British World, 1750–1850|date=2010|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=9781861978592|page=207|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tuW554NdWk8C&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22william+hamilton%22%22british+museum%22+greek+vases#v=onepage&amp;q=%22william%20hamilton%22%22british%20museum%22%20greek%20vases&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indolence and energy (1778–1800)===
[[File:Entrance ticket to the British Museum, London March 3, 1790.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance ticket to the British Museum, London 3 March 1790]]
From 1778, a display of objects from the [[Pacific Ocean|South Sea]]s brought back from the round-the-world voyages of Captain [[James Cook]] and the travels of other explorers fascinated visitors with a glimpse of previously unknown lands. The bequest of a collection of books, [[engraved gem]]s, coins, prints and drawings by [[Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode]] in 1800 did much to raise the museum's reputation; but Montagu House became increasingly crowded and decrepit and it was apparent that it would be unable to cope with further expansion.&lt;ref&gt;BMCE1/5, 1175 (13 May 1820). Minutes of General Meeting of the Trustees, 1754–63. (Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History, p. 78)&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum's first notable addition towards its collection of antiquities, since its foundation, was by Sir [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|William Hamilton]] (1730–1803), British Ambassador to [[Naples]], who sold his collection of Greek and Roman artefacts to the museum in 1784 together with a number of other antiquities and natural history specimens. A list of donations to the museum, dated 31 January 1784, refers to the Hamilton bequest of a "Colossal Foot of an [[Apollo]] in Marble". It was one of two antiquities of Hamilton's collection drawn for him by Francesco Progenie, a pupil of Pietro Fabris, who also contributed a number of drawings of Mount Vesuvius sent by Hamilton to the [[Royal Society]] in London.

===Growth and change (1800–25)===
[[File:British Museum, The Elgin Room, 1937.jpg|thumb|The [[Elgin Marbles|Elgin]] Room, 1937]]
[[File:P8282318.1.JPG|thumb|right|Left to Right: [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], Townley Gallery and [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]]'s west wing under construction, July 1828]]
[[File:Mauso03.JPG|thumb|The [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus|Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] Room, 1920s]]

In the early 19th century the foundations for the extensive collection of sculpture began to be laid and Greek, Roman and Egyptian artefacts dominated the antiquities displays. After the defeat of the [[Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French campaign]] in the [[Battle of the Nile]], in 1801, the British Museum acquired more Egyptian sculptures and in 1802 [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] presented the [[Rosetta Stone]] – key to the deciphering of hieroglyphs.&lt;ref&gt;''Wondrous Curiosities – Ancient Egypt at the British Museum'', pp. 66–72 (Stephanie Moser, 2006, {{ISBN|0-226-54209-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; Gifts and purchases from [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]], British consul general in Egypt, beginning with the [[Younger Memnon|Colossal bust of Ramesses II]] in 1818, laid the foundations of the collection of Egyptian Monumental Sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;''The Story of the British Museum'', p. 24 (Marjorie Caygill, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7141-2772-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; Many Greek sculptures followed, notably the first purpose-built exhibition space, the [[Charles Towneley|Charles Towneley collection]], much of it Roman Sculpture, in 1805. In 1806, [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin]], ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1799 to 1803 removed the large collection of marble sculptures from the [[Parthenon]], on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] in Athens and transferred them to the UK. In 1816 these masterpieces of western art, were acquired by The British Museum by Act of Parliament and deposited in the museum thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;The British Museum – The Elgin Marbles, p. 85 (B.F.Cook, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7141-2134-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collections were supplemented by the [[Bassae]] frieze from [[Phigalia|Phigaleia]], [[Greece]] in 1815. The Ancient Near Eastern collection also had its beginnings in 1825 with the purchase of [[Assyria]]n and [[Babylonia]]n antiquities from the widow of [[Claudius James Rich]].&lt;ref&gt;The British Museum – Assyrian Sculpture, pp. 6–7 (Julian Reade, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7141-2141-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 a buildings committee was set up to plan for expansion of the museum, and further highlighted by the donation in 1822 of the [[King's Library]], personal library of King George III's, comprising 65,000 volumes, 19,000 [[pamphlet]]s, maps, charts and [[Topographic map|topographical drawings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/prbooks/georgeiiicoll/george3kingslibrary.html |title=King's Library |publisher=Bl |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architect, [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]], was asked to draw up plans for an eastern extension to the museum "...&amp;nbsp;for the reception of the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library]], and a Picture Gallery over it ..."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; and put forward plans for today's quadrangular building, much of which can be seen today. The dilapidated Old [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]] was demolished and work on the [[King's Library]] Gallery began in 1823. The extension, the East Wing, was completed by 1831. However, following the founding of the [[National Gallery, London]] in 1824,&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Understanding of the foundation of the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] is complicated by the fact that there is no documented history of the institution. At first the National Gallery functioned effectively as part of the British Museum, to which the [[trustee]]s transferred most of their most important pictures (ex. portraits). Full control was handed over to the National Gallery in 1868, after the [[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1840–1859|Act of Parliament of 1856]] established the Gallery as an independent body.&lt;/ref&gt; the proposed Picture Gallery was no longer needed, and the space on the upper floor was given over to the [[Natural history]] collections.&lt;ref&gt;The Story of the British Museum, p. 25 (Marjorie Caygill, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7141-2772-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===The largest building site in Europe (1825–50)===
[[File:Image-The Grenville Library (1875).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Thomas Grenville|Grenville]] Library, 1875]]
The museum became a construction site as [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]]'s grand [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] building gradually arose. The [[King's Library]], on the ground floor of the East Wing, was handed over in 1827, and was described as one of the finest rooms in London. Although it was not fully open to the general public until 1857, special openings were arranged during [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851. In spite of dirt and disruption the collections grew, outpacing the new building.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

In 1840, the museum became involved in its first overseas [[excavation (archeology)|excavation]]s, [[Charles Fellows]]'s expedition to [[Xanthos]], in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], whence came remains of the tombs of the rulers of ancient [[Lycia]], among them the [[Nereid Monument|Nereid]] and [[Tomb of Payava|Payava]] monuments. In 1857, [[Charles Thomas Newton|Charles Newton]] was to discover the 4th-century BC [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum of Halikarnassos]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. In the 1840s and 1850s the museum supported excavations in [[Assyria]] by [[Austen Henry Layard|A.H. Layard]] and others at sites such as [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]]. Of particular interest to curators was the eventual discovery of [[Ashurbanipal]]'s great library of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]], which helped to make the museum a focus for [[Assyriology|Assyrian studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Reade, Julian (2004). Assyrian Sculpture. London: The British Museum Press, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Grenville|Sir Thomas Grenville]] (1755–1846), a trustee of the British Museum from 1830, assembled a library of 20,240 volumes, which he left to the museum in his will. The books arrived in January 1847 in twenty-one horse-drawn vans. The only vacant space for this large library was a room originally intended for manuscripts, between the Front Entrance Hall and the Manuscript Saloon. The books remained here until the British Library moved to [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] in 1998.

===Collecting from the wider world (1850–75)===
The opening of the forecourt in 1852 marked the completion of [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]]'s 1823 plan, but already adjustments were having to be made to cope with the unforeseen growth of the collections. Infill galleries were constructed for [[Assyria]]n sculptures and [[Sydney Smirke]]'s [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]], with space for a million books, opened in 1857. Because of continued pressure on space the decision was taken to move natural history to a new building in [[South Kensington]], which would later become the [[Natural History Museum, London|British Museum of Natural History]].

Roughly contemporary with the construction of the new building was the career of a man sometimes called the "second founder" of the British Museum, the Italian librarian [[Anthony Panizzi]]. Under his supervision, the British Museum Library (now part of the [[British Library]]) quintupled in size and became a well-organised institution worthy of being called a national library, the largest library in the world after the [[National Library of Paris]].&lt;ref name="world and its people"/&gt; The [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] at the centre of Smirke's design proved to be a waste of valuable space and was filled at Panizzi's request by a circular Reading Room of cast iron, designed by Smirke's brother, Sydney Smirke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dickens Charles Jr. |author-link=Charles Dickens Jr. |year=1879|title=Museum, British|work=[[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]|url=http://www.victorianlondon.org/dickens/dickens-mus.htm|accessdate=22 August 2007|quote=Beyond the new Lycian room is the READING ROOM: [...] ; circular structure; original suggestion of Thomas Watts, improved by A. (Sir A.) Panizzi, carried out by Mr. Sidney Smirke; [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the mid-19th century, the museum's collections were relatively circumscribed but, in 1851, with the appointment to the staff of [[Augustus Wollaston Franks]] to curate the collections, the museum began for the first time to collect British and European medieval antiquities, [[prehistory]], branching out into Asia and diversifying its holdings of [[ethnography]]. A real coup for the museum was the purchase in 1867, over French objections, of the [[Louis, Duke of Blacas|Duke of Blacas]]'s wide-ranging and valuable collection of antiquities. Overseas excavations continued and [[John Turtle Wood]] discovered the remains of the 4th century BC [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus|Ephesos]], another [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Wonder of the Ancient World]].&lt;ref&gt;South from Ephesus – An Escape From The Tyranny of Western Art, pp. 33–34,(Brian Sewell, 2002, {{ISBN|1-903933-16-1}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholarship and legacies (1875–1900)===
The natural history collections were an integral part of the British Museum until their removal to the new British Museum of Natural History in 1887, nowadays the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]. With the departure and the completion of the new White Wing (fronting Montague Street) in 1884, more space was available for antiquities and [[ethnography]] and the library could further expand. This was a time of innovation as electric lighting was introduced in the Reading Room and exhibition galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=The Electric Light in the British Museum| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=18 December 1879| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1879/12/18/80703696.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[William Burges]] collection of [[armoury]] was bequeathed to the museum in 1881. In 1882, the museum was involved in the establishment of the independent [[Egypt Exploration Fund]] (now Society) the first British body to carry out research in Egypt. A bequest from Miss Emma Turner in 1892 financed excavations in Cyprus. In 1897 the death of the great collector and curator, [[Augustus Wollaston Franks|A. W. Franks]], was followed by an immense bequest of 3,300 [[Ring (finger)|finger rings]], 153 drinking vessels, 512 pieces of continental porcelain, 1,500 [[netsuke]], 850 [[inro]], over 30,000 [[bookplates]] and miscellaneous items of jewellery and plate, among them the [[Oxus Treasure]].&lt;ref&gt;Caygill, Marjorie (2006). The British Museum: 250 Years. London: The British Museum Press, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898 [[Ferdinand James von Rothschild|Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild]] bequeathed the [[Waddesdon Bequest]], the glittering contents from his New Smoking Room at [[Waddesdon Manor]]. This consisted of almost 300 pieces of ''[[objets d'art]] et de vertu'' which included exquisite examples of jewellery, plate, enamel, carvings, glass and [[maiolica]], among them the [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]], probably created in the 1390s in Paris for [[John, Duke of Berry]]. The collection was in the tradition of a [[schatzkammer]] or treasure house such as those formed by the [[Renaissance]] princes of Europe.&lt;ref name="rothschild"&gt;{{cite web| title=Creating a Great Museum: Early Collectors and The British Museum| first=Marjorie| last=Caygill| publisher=Fathom| url=http://www.fathom.com/course/21701728/session4.html| accessdate=13 November 2007| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006091742/http://www.fathom.com/course/21701728/session4.html| archivedate=6 October 2007| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baron Ferdinand's will was most specific, and failure to observe the terms would make it void, the collection should be

===New century, new building (1900–25)===

By the last years of the 19th century, The British Museum's collections had increased to the extent that its building was no longer large enough. In 1895 the trustees purchased the 69 houses surrounding the museum with the intention of demolishing them and building around the west, north and east sides of the museum. The first stage was the construction of the northern wing beginning 1906.

All the while, the collections kept growing. [[Emil Torday]] collected in Central Africa, [[Marc Aurel Stein|Aurel Stein]] in Central Asia, [[David George Hogarth|D.G. Hogarth]], [[Leonard Woolley]] and [[T. E. Lawrence]] excavated at [[Carchemish]]. Around this time, the American collector and philanthropist [[J Pierpont Morgan]] donated a substantial number of objects to the museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=101677&amp;peoA=101677-3-9| title=British Museum – Collection search: You searched for| work=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[William Greenwell]]'s collection of prehistoric artefacts from across Europe which he had purchased for £10,000 in 1908. Morgan had also acquired a major part of Sir [[John Evans (archaeologist)|John Evans]]'s coin collection, which was later sold to the museum by his son [[J. P. Morgan Jr.|John Pierpont Morgan Junior]] in 1915. In 1918, because of the threat of wartime bombing, some objects were evacuated to a Postal Tube Railway at Holborn, the [[National Library of Wales|National Library of Wales (Aberystwyth)]] and a country house near [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]]. On the return of antiquities from wartime storage in 1919 some objects were found to have deteriorated. A conservation laboratory was set up in May 1920 and became a permanent department in 1931. It is today the oldest in continuous existence.&lt;ref&gt;Permanent establishment of the Research Laboratory (now the oldest such establishment in continuous existence) {{cite web| url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/conservation_and_scientific/history.aspx| title=History| work=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, the British Museum welcomed over one million visitors.

===Disruption and reconstruction (1925–50)===
New [[mezzanine]] floors were constructed and book stacks rebuilt in an attempt to cope with the flood of books. In 1931, the art dealer [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Sir Joseph Duveen]] offered funds to build a gallery for the [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon sculptures]]. Designed by the American architect [[John Russell Pope]], it was completed in 1938. The appearance of the exhibition galleries began to change as dark Victorian reds gave way to modern pastel shades.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|1=Ashmole, the Keeper of the Greek and Roman Antiquities appreciated the original top-lighting of these galleries and removed the Victorian colour scheme, commenting: &lt;blockquote&gt;The old Elgin Gallery was painted a deep terracotta red, which, though in some ways satisfactory, diminished its apparent size, and was apt to produce a depressing effect on the visitor. It was decided to experiment with lighter colours, and the walls of the large room were painted with what was, at its first application, a pure cold white, but which after a year's exposure had unfortunately yellowed. The small Elgin Room was painted with pure white tinted with prussian blue, and the Room of the metopes was painted with pure white tinted with cobalt blue and black; it was necessary, for practical reasons, to colour all the dadoes a darker colour&lt;ref&gt;Quoted Ashmole (1994), 125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}} However, in August 1939, due to the imminence of war and the likelihood of air-raids, the Parthenon Sculptures, along with the museum's most valued collections, were dispersed to secure basements, [[English country house|country houses]], [[Aldwych tube station|Aldwych Underground station]], the [[National Library of Wales]] and a quarry. The evacuation was timely, for in 1940 the Duveen Gallery was severely damaged by bombing.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, B.F. (2005). The Elgin Marbles. London: The British Museum Press, pg 92&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, prior to the war, the Nazis had sent a researcher to the British Museum for several years with the aim of "compiling an anti-Semitic history of Anglo-Jewry."&lt;ref name="germanlibrariesaronsfeld"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aronsfeld|first1=C. C.|title=Judaica and Hebraica in German libraries: a review article|journal=Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|date=April 1984|volume=16|issue=2|pages=129–132|doi=10.1177/096100068401600204|quote=The Nazis, in fact, went to great lengths in exploiting Jewish (as well as general) literature. For instance, they arranged for a German researcher to spend several years at the British Museum for the purpose of compiling an anti-Semitic history of Anglo-Jewry, which, at the time, with its 562 pages and a bibliography of some 600 items, was an effort more ambitious than hitherto attempted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the museum continued to collect from all countries and all centuries: among the most spectacular additions were the 2600 BC [[Mesopotamia]]n treasure from [[Ur]], discovered during [[Leonard Woolley]]'s 1922–34 excavations. Gold, silver and [[garnet]] grave goods from the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] ship burial at [[Sutton Hoo]] (1939) and late Roman silver tableware from [[Mildenhall Treasure|Mildenhall]], Suffolk (1946). The immediate [[post-war]] years were taken up with the return of the collections from protection and the restoration of the museum after the [[The Blitz|Blitz]]. Work also began on restoring the damaged Duveen Gallery.

===A new public face (1950–75)===
[[File:The Duveen Gallery (1980s).jpg|thumb|The re-opened [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen|Duveen]] Gallery, 1980]]

In 1953, the museum celebrated its [[200 (number)|bicentenary]]. Many changes followed: the first full-time in house designer and publications officer were appointed in 1964, A [[The British Museum Friends|Friends]] organisation was set up in 1968, an Education Service established in 1970 and publishing house in 1973. In 1963, a new Act of Parliament introduced administrative reforms. It became easier to lend objects, the constitution of the [[board of trustees]] changed and the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] became fully independent. By 1959 the [[British Museum Department of Coins and Medals|Coins and Medals]] office suite, completely destroyed during the war, was rebuilt and re-opened, attention turned towards the gallery work with new tastes in design leading to the remodelling of [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke's]] Classical and Near Eastern galleries.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 the Duveen Gallery was finally restored and the Parthenon Sculptures were moved back into it, once again at the heart of the museum.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|1=Ashmole had never liked the Duveen Gallery: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is, I suppose, not positively bad, but it could have been infinitely better. It is pretentious, in that it uses the ancient Marbles to decorate itself. This is a long outmoded idea, and the exact opposite of what a sculpture gallery should do. And, although it incorporates them, it is out of scale, and tends to dwarf them with its bogus Doric features, including those columns, supporting almost nothing which would have made an ancient Greek artist architect wince. The source of daylight is too high above the sculptures, a fault that is only concealed by the amount of reflection from the pinkish marble walls. These are too similar in colour to the marbles...These half-dozen elementary errors were pointed out by everyone in the Museum, and by many scholars outside, when the building was projected.&lt;ref&gt;Ashmole (1994), 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; It was not until the 1980s that the installation of a lighting scheme removed his greatest criticism of the building.}}

By the 1970s the museum was again expanding. More services for the public were introduced; visitor numbers soared, with the temporary exhibition "Treasures of [[Tutankhamun]]" in 1972, attracting 1,694,117 visitors, the most successful in British history. In the same year the Act of Parliament establishing the British Library was passed, separating the collection of [[manuscripts]] and printed books from the British Museum. This left the museum with antiquities; coins, medals and paper money; prints &amp; drawings; and [[ethnography]]. A pressing problem was finding space for additions to the library which now required an extra 1{{fraction|1|4}} miles of shelving each year. The Government suggested a site at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] for the new British Library but the books did not leave the museum until 1997.

===The Great Court emerges (1975–2000)===
The departure of the British Library to a new site at St Pancras, finally achieved in 1998, provided the space needed for the books. It also created the opportunity to redevelop the vacant space in [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke's]] 19th-century central quadrangle into the [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court]] – the largest covered square in Europe – which opened in 2000. The ethnography collections, which had been housed in the short-lived [[Museum of Mankind]] at [[6 Burlington Gardens]] from 1970, were returned to new purpose-built galleries in the museum in 2000.

The museum again readjusted its collecting policies as interest in "modern" objects: prints, drawings, medals and the decorative arts reawakened. Ethnographical fieldwork was carried out in places as diverse as [[New Guinea]], [[Madagascar]], [[Romania]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Indonesia]] and there were excavations in the [[Near East]], Egypt, Sudan and the UK. The [[Weston family|Weston]] Gallery of Roman Britain, opened in 1997, displayed a number of recently discovered [[hoard]]s which demonstrated the richness of what had been considered an unimportant part of the Roman Empire. The museum turned increasingly towards private funds for buildings, acquisitions and other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;

===The British Museum today===
Today the museum no longer houses collections of [[natural history]], and the books and manuscripts it once held now form part of the independent British Library. The museum nevertheless preserves its universality in its collections of artefacts representing the cultures of the world, ancient and modern. The original 1753 collection has grown to over thirteen million objects at the British Museum, 70 million at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] and 150 million at the British Library.

The [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]], which was designed by the architect [[Sydney Smirke]], opened in 1857. For almost 150 years researchers came here to consult the museum's vast library. The Reading Room closed in 1997 when the national library (the British Library) moved to a new building at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]]. Today it has been transformed into the Walter and Leonore [[Annenberg Foundation|Annenberg]] Centre.

With the bookstacks in the central courtyard of the museum empty, the demolition for [[Lord Foster]]'s glass-roofed [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court|Great Court]] could begin. The Great Court, opened in 2000, while undoubtedly improving circulation around the museum, was criticised for having a lack of exhibition space at a time when the museum was in serious financial difficulties and many galleries were closed to the public. At the same time the African collections that had been temporarily housed in 6 Burlington Gardens were given a new gallery in the North Wing funded by the [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|Sainsbury]] family – with the donation valued at £25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/galleries/africa/room_25_africa.aspx |title=Room 25: Africa |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its very large website, the museum has the largest [[online database]] of objects in the collection of any museum in the world, with 2,000,000 individual object entries, 650,000 of them illustrated, online at the start of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database.aspx |title=Search the collection database |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a "Highlights" database with longer entries on over 4,000 objects, and several specialised online research catalogues and online journals (all free to access).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights.aspx Highlights] British Museum, [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_research_catalogues.aspx online research catalogues] British Museum and [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_journals.aspx online journals] British Museum&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the museum's website received 19.5 millions visits, an increase of 47% from the previous year.&lt;ref name="BBC_museum#" /&gt;

==Governance==
The British Museum is a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport|Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]] through a three-year funding agreement. Its head is the [[Director of the British Museum]]. The British Museum was run from its inception by a 'principal librarian' (when the book collections were still part of the museum), a role that was renamed 'director and principal librarian' in 1898, and 'director' in 1973 (on the separation of the British Library).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/the_museum/about_us/management_and_governance/directors.aspx |title=Directors |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A board of [[List of trustees of the British Museum|25 trustees]] (with the director as their [[Chief accounting officer|accounting officer]] for the purposes of reporting to Government) is responsible for the general management and control of the museum, in accordance with the [[British Museum Act]] 1963 and the [[Museums and Galleries Act 1992]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/the_museum/about_us/management_and_governance/museum_governance.aspx |title=Museum governance |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 1963 Act, it was chaired by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the [[Lord Chancellor]] and the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. The board was formed on the museum's inception to [[trust law|hold its collections in trust]] for the nation without actually owning them themselves, and now fulfil a mainly advisory role. [[Trustee]] appointments are governed by the regulatory framework set out in the code of practice on public appointments issued by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/management/trustees/becoming_a_trustee.aspx |title=Becoming a Trustee |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==
[[File:British museum entrance.jpg|thumb|The main entrance to the museum, with Greek temple style [[portico]], 2007]]
The [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] façade facing Great Russell Street is a characteristic building of Sir [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]], with 44 columns in the [[Ionic order]] {{convert|45|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, closely based on those of the temple of [[Athena|Athena Polias]] at [[Priene]] in [[Asia Minor]]. The [[pediment]] over the main entrance is decorated by sculptures by Sir [[Richard Westmacott]] depicting ''The Progress of Civilisation'', consisting of fifteen [[Allegory|allegorical]] figures, installed in 1852.

The construction commenced around the courtyard with the East Wing ([[King's Library|The King's Library]]) in 1823–1828, followed by the North Wing in 1833–1838, which originally housed among other galleries a reading room, now the Wellcome Gallery. Work was also progressing on the northern half of the West Wing (The Egyptian Sculpture Gallery) 1826–1831, with [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]] demolished in 1842 to make room for the final part of the West Wing, completed in 1846, and the South Wing with its great colonnade, initiated in 1843 and completed in 1847, when the Front Hall and Great Staircase were opened to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Building the British Museum, Marjorie Caygill &amp; Christopher Date 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is faced with [[Portland stone]], but the perimeter walls and other parts of the building were built using [[Haytor]] granite from Dartmoor in South Devon, transported via the unique [[Haytor Granite Tramway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.es.ucl.ac.uk/department/collections/RockRoom/building.htm| title=Building London| publisher=[[University College London]]| accessdate=4 July 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207201115/http://www.es.ucl.ac.uk/department/collections/RockRoom/building.htm| archivedate=7 December 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846 Robert Smirke was replaced as the museum's architect by his brother [[Sydney Smirke]], whose major addition was the [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]] 1854–1857; at {{convert|140|ft|m}} in diameter it was then the second widest dome in the world, the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome being slightly wider.

The next major addition was the White Wing 1882–1884 added behind the eastern end of the South Front, the architect being Sir [[John Taylor (architect)|John Taylor]].

In 1895, Parliament gave the museum trustees a loan of £200,000 to purchase from the Duke of Bedford all 69 houses which backed onto the museum building in the five surrounding streets – Great Russell Street, Montague Street, Montague Place, Bedford Square and Bloomsbury Street.&lt;ref&gt;Title deed of the 'perimeter properties' of The British Museum, BM Archives CA TD&lt;/ref&gt; The trustees planned to demolish these houses and to build around the west, north and east sides of the museum new galleries that would completely fill the block on which the museum stands. The architect Sir [[John James Burnet]] was petitioned to put forward ambitious long-term plans to extend the building on all three sides. Most of the houses in Montague Place were knocked down a few years after the sale. Of this grand plan only the Edward VII galleries in the centre of the North Front were ever constructed, these were built 1906–14 to the design by J.J. Burnet, and opened by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] in 1914. They now house the museum's collections of Prints and Drawings and Oriental Antiquities. There was not enough money to put up more new buildings, and so the houses in the other streets are nearly all still standing.

The [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Duveen]] Gallery, sited to the west of the Egyptian, Greek &amp; Assyrian sculpture galleries, was designed to house the Elgin Marbles by the American [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] architect [[John Russell Pope]]. Although completed in 1938, it was hit by a bomb in 1940 and remained semi-derelict for 22 years, before reopening in 1962. Other areas damaged during [[World War II]] bombing included: in September 1940 two unexploded bombs hit the Edward VII galleries, the King's Library received a direct hit from a high explosive bomb, incendiaries fell on the dome of the Round Reading Room but did little damage; on the night of 10 to 11 May 1941 several incendiaries fell on the south-west corner of the museum, destroying the book stack and 150,000 books in the courtyard and the galleries around the top of the Great Staircase – this damage was not fully repaired until the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 65–66, Building the British Museum, Marjorie Caygill &amp; Christopher Date 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] Great Court is a covered square at the centre of the British Museum designed by the engineers [[Buro Happold]] and the architects [[Foster and Partners]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman Foster and the British Museum, Norman Foster, Deyan Sudjic &amp; Spencer de Grey 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Court opened in December 2000 and is the largest covered square in Europe.

At the centre of the Great Court is the Reading Room vacated by the British Library, its functions now moved to St Pancras. The Reading Room is open to any member of the public who wishes to read there.

Today, the British Museum has grown to become one of the largest museums in the world, covering an area of over 92,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (990,000 sq. ft).&lt;ref name="britishmuseum.org"/&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;http://planningonline.camden.gov.uk/MULTIWAM/doc/Supporting%20Documents-2692368.pdf?extension=.pdf&amp;id=2692368&amp;location=VOLUME3&amp;contentType=application/pdf&amp;pageCount=1{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to 21,600&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (232,000 sq. ft)&lt;ref name="museumsassociation.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/news/26012011-cross-calls-for-new-debate-on-stored-collections |title=Cross calls for new debate on stored collections |publisher=Museums Association |date=26 January 2011 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of on-site storage space, and 9,400&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (101,000 sq. ft)&lt;ref name="museumsassociation.org"/&gt; of external storage space.

However, the lack of a large temporary exhibition space has led to the £135 million World Conservation and Exhibition Centre to provide one and to concentrate all the museum's conservation facilities into one Conservation Centre. This project was announced in July 2007, with the architects [[Richard Rogers|Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners]]. It was granted planning permission in December 2009 and was completed in time for the Viking exhibition in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Charlotte| last=Higgins| title=British Museum plans £100m complex for blockbusters| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/art/heritage/story/0,,2118794,00.html| work=The Guardian| page=10| date=5 July 2007| accessdate=5 July 2007| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.designweek.co.uk/news/british-museum-unveils-new-135-million-wing/3038064.article| title=British Museum unveils new £135 million wing| work=[[Design Week]]| date=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Museum houses the world's largest&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;The Cairo Museum has 200,000 artefacts, with leading collections reposited at the Egyptian Museum of Berlin (100,000), Musée du Louvre (60,000), Petrie Museum (80,000), The Metropolitan Museum of art (26,000), University of Pennsylvania (42,000), Ashmolean Museum (40,000), Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (40,000), Museo Egizio, Turin (32,500 objects).&lt;/ref&gt; and most comprehensive collection of [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquities]] (with over 100,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/ancient_egypt_and_sudan/history_of_the_collection/development_of_the_collection/development_since_world_war_ii.aspx |title=Development since World War II (1945 – )|work=British Museum |accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; pieces) outside the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]]. A collection of immense importance for its range and quality, it includes objects of all periods from virtually every site of importance in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the [[History of Sudan|Sudan]]. Together, they illustrate every aspect of the cultures of the [[Nile|Nile Valley]] (including [[Nubia]]), from the [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic]] [[Neolithic]] period (c. 10,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]]) through to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic (Christian)]] times (12th century [[Anno Domini|AD]]), a time-span over 11,000 years.

[[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquities]] have formed part of the British Museum collection ever since its foundation in 1753 after receiving 160 Egyptian objects&lt;ref&gt;Reported in the list of Sloane's collection given to his executors in 1753. Reproduced in MacGregor (1994a:29)&lt;/ref&gt; from Sir [[Hans Sloane]]. After the defeat of the [[Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French]] forces under [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1801, the Egyptian antiquities collected were confiscated by the [[British army]] and presented to the British Museum in 1803. These works, which included the famed [[Rosetta Stone]], were the first important group of large sculptures to be acquired by the museum. Thereafter, the UK appointed [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]] as [[Consul general|consul]] in Egypt who amassed a huge collection of antiquities, some of which were assembled and transported with great ingenuity by the famous Italian explorer [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni|Giovanni Belzoni]]. Most of the antiquities Salt collected were purchased by the British Museum and the [[Musée du Louvre]].

By 1866 the collection consisted of some 10,000 objects. Antiquities from excavations started to come to the museum in the latter part of the 19th century as a result of the work of the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]] under the efforts of [[E. A. Wallis Budge|E.A. Wallis Budge]]. Over the years more than 11,000 objects came from this source, including pieces from [[Amarna]], [[Bubastis]] and [[Deir el-Bahari]]. Other organisations and individuals also excavated and donated objects to the British Museum, including [[Flinders Petrie]]'s Egypt Research Account and the British School of Archaeology in Egypt, as well as the [[Oxford University]] Expedition to [[Kawa (Sudan)|Kawa]] and [[Faras]] in Sudan.

Active support by the museum for excavations in Egypt continued to result in important acquisitions throughout the 20th century until changes in antiquities laws in Egypt led to the suspension of policies allowing finds to be exported, although divisions still continue in Sudan. The British Museum conducted its own excavations in Egypt where it received divisions of finds, including [[Asyut]] (1907), [[El-Badari|Mostagedda]] and [[El-Badari|Matmar]] (1920s), [[Ashmunein]] (1980s) and sites in Sudan such as [[Soba (city)|Soba]], Kawa and the Northern Dongola Reach (1990s). The size of the Egyptian collections now stand at over 110,000 objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/spencer.htm |title=A British Museum Egyptologist's View: The Return of Egyptian Antiquities is Not an Issue |publisher=Touregypt |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In autumn 2001 the eight million objects forming the museum's permanent collection were further expanded by the addition of six million objects from the Wendorf Collection of [[Predynastic Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[History of Sudan|Sudanese]] [[Prehistory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/aes/aesnot.html |title=Ancient Egypt and Sudan |work=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206000328/http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/aes/aesnot.html |archivedate=6 February 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were donated by Professor [[Fred Wendorf]] of [[Southern Methodist University]] in [[Texas]], and comprise the entire collection of artefacts and environmental remains from his excavations at Prehistoric sites in the [[Sahara Desert]] between 1963 and 1997. Other fieldwork collections have recently come from Dietrich and Rosemarie Klemm ([[University of Munich]]) and William Adams ([[University of Kentucky]]).

The seven permanent Egyptian galleries at the British Museum, which include its largest exhibition space (Room 4, for monumental sculpture), can display only 4% of its Egyptian holdings. The second-floor galleries have a selection of the museum's collection of 140 [[Mummy|mummies]] and coffins, the largest outside [[Egyptian Museum|Cairo]]. A high proportion of the collection comes from tombs or contexts associated with the cult of the dead, and it is these pieces, in particular the mummies, that remain among the most eagerly sought-after exhibits by visitors to the museum.

Though not a part of Ancient Egypt but rather part of the wider modern Egypt project, in May 2018, the British Museum added the boots of Egyptian footballer, [[Mohamed Salah|Mo Salah]]. The boots were added to the Egypt collection because of his historical achievement of scoring 32 goals in a 38-game season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/17/mo-salah-scores-boots-enter--british-museum-collection-liverpool-egypt|title=Mo Salah scores again as boots enter British Museum collection|last=Brown|first=Mark|date=17 May 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Museum has one of the world's largest and most comprehensive collections of antiquities from the [[Classical antiquity|Classical world]], with over 100,000 objects. These mostly range in date from the beginning of the [[Bronze Age|Greek Bronze Age]] (about 3200 BC) to the establishment of Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, with the [[Edict of Milan]] under the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I]] in 313 AD. Archaeology was in its infancy during the nineteenth century and many pioneering individuals began excavating sites across the Classical world, chief among them for the museum were [[Charles Thomas Newton|Charles Newton]], [[John Turtle Wood]], [[Robert Murdoch Smith]] and [[Charles Fellows]].

The Greek objects originate from across the Ancient Greek world, from the mainland of Greece and the Aegean Islands, to neighbouring lands in Asia Minor and Egypt in the eastern Mediterranean and as far as the western lands of [[Magna Graecia]] that include Sicily and southern Italy. The [[Cyclades|Cycladic]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] cultures are represented, and the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] collection includes important sculpture from the [[Parthenon]] in Athens, as well as elements of two of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], the [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]] and the [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus|Ephesos]].

Beginning from the early [[Bronze Age]], the department also houses one of the widest-ranging collections of [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italic]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] antiquities outside Italy, as well as extensive groups of material from [[Ancient history of Cyprus|Cyprus]] and non-Greek colonies in [[Lycia]] and [[Caria]] on Asia Minor. There is some material from the [[Roman Republic]], but the collection's strength is in its comprehensive array of objects from across the [[Roman Empire]], with the exception of Britain (which is the mainstay of the Department of Prehistory and Europe).

The collections of ancient jewellery and bronzes, [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]] (many from graves in southern Italy that were once part of [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]]'s and [[Edmé-Antoine Durand|Chevalier Durand]]'s collections), [[Glass|Roman glass]] including the famous [[Cameo glass]] Portland Vase, [[Roman mosaic]]s from [[Carthage]] and [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] in North Africa that were excavated by [[Nathan Davis (traveller)|Nathan Davis]], and silver hoards from [[Roman Gaul]] (some of which were bequeathed by the philanthropist and museum trustee [[Richard Payne Knight]]), are particularly important. Cypriot antiquities are strong too and have benefited from the purchase of Sir [[Robert Hamilton Lang]]'s collection as well as the bequest of Emma Turner in 1892, which funded many excavations on the island. Roman sculptures (many of which are copies of Greek originals) are particularly well represented by the [[Charles Townley#Townley Collection|Townley collection]] as well as residual sculptures from the famous [[Farnese collection]].

Objects from the Department of Greece and Rome are located throughout the museum, although many of the [[architectural]] monuments are to be found on the ground floor, with connecting galleries from Gallery 5 to Gallery 23. On the upper floor, there are galleries devoted to smaller material from ancient Italy, Greece, Cyprus and the Roman Empire.

Key highlights of the collections include:

[[Parthenon]]
*The [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon Marbles (Elgin Marbles)]], (447–438 BC)

With a collection numbering some 330,000 works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/middle_east/research.aspx|title=British Museum – Research| work=britishmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the British Museum possesses the world's largest and most important collection of [[Mesopotamia]]n antiquities outside [[Iraq]].  A collection of immense importance, the holdings of [[Assyrian sculpture]], [[Babylonia]]n and [[Sumer]]ian antiquities are among the most comprehensive in the world with entire suites of rooms panelled in alabaster [[Assyrian palace reliefs]] from [[Nimrud]], [[Nineveh]] and [[Khorsabad]].

The collections represent the civilisations of the ancient Near East and its adjacent areas. These cover [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iran|Persia]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Anatolia]], the [[Caucasus]], parts of Central Asia, [[Syria]], the [[Holy Land]] and [[Phoenicia]]n settlements in the western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] from the [[Prehistory|prehistoric period]] and include objects from the beginning of [[Islam]] in the 7th century.

The first significant addition of [[Mesopotamian]] objects was from the collection of [[Claudius James Rich]] in 1825. The collection was later dramatically enlarged by the excavations of [[Austen Henry Layard|A. H. Layard]] at the [[Assyria]]n sites of [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]] between 1845 and 1851. At Nimrud, Layard discovered the North-West Palace of [[Ashurnasirpal II]], as well as three other palaces and various temples. He later uncovered the Palace of [[Sennacherib]] at Nineveh with 'no less than seventy-one halls'. As a result, a large numbers of [[Lamassu]]'s, palace reliefs, [[Stele|stelae]], including the [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III]], were brought to the British Museum.

[[File:London 307.JPG|thumb|Room 52 – Ancient Iran with the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], considered to be the world's first charter of [[human rights]], 559–530 BC]]
Layard's work was continued by his assistant, [[Hormuzd Rassam]] and in 1852–1854 he went on to discover the North Palace of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh with many magnificent reliefs, including the famous ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'' and [[Lachish relief]]s. He also discovered the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|Royal Library of Ashurbanipal]], a large collection of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] of enormous importance that today number around 130,000 pieces. [[William Loftus|W. K. Loftus]] excavated in Nimrud between 1850 and 1855 and found a remarkable hoard of [[Nimrud ivories|ivories]] in the Burnt Palace. Between 1878 and 1882 Rassam greatly improved the museum's holdings with exquisite objects including the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] from [[Babylon]], the bronze gates from [[Balawat]], important objects from [[Sippar]], and a fine collection of [[Urartu|Urartian]] bronzes from [[Toprakkale]].

In the early 20th century excavations were carried out at [[Carchemish]], [[Turkey]] by [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] and [[Leonard Woolley]], the latter assisted by [[T. E. Lawrence]]. The Mesopotamian collections were greatly augmented by excavations in southern [[Iraq]] after the [[First World War]]. From [[Ubaid period|Tell al-Ubaid]] came the bronze furnishings of a [[Sumer]]ian temple, including life-sized lions and a panel featuring the lion-headed eagle Indugud found by [[Henry Hall (Egyptologist)|H. R. Hall]] in 1919–24. Woolley went on to excavate [[Ur]] between 1922 and 1934, discovering the 'Royal Cemeteries' of the 3rd millennium BC. Some of the masterpieces include the '[[Standard of Ur]]', the 'Ram in a Thicket', the '[[Royal Game of Ur]]', and two bull-headed [[lyres]]. The department also has three [[diorite]] statues of the ruler [[Statues of Gudea|Gudea]] from the ancient state of [[Lagash]] and a series of limestone [[kudurru]] or boundary stones from different locations across ancient [[Mesopotamia]].

Although the collections centre on Mesopotamia, most of the surrounding areas are well represented. The [[Achaemenid]] collection was enhanced with the addition of the [[Oxus Treasure]] in 1897 and objects excavated by the German scholar [[Ernst Herzfeld]] and the Hungarian-British explorer [[Marc Aurel Stein|Sir Aurel Stein]]. Reliefs and sculptures from the site of [[Persepolis]] were donated by Sir [[Gore Ouseley]] in 1825 and the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 5th Earl of Aberdeen|5th Earl of Aberdeen]] in 1861. Moreover, the museum has been able to acquire one of the greatest assemblages of Achaemenid [[Household silver|silverware]] in the world. The later [[Sasanian Empire]] is also well represented by ornate silver plates and cups, many representing ruling monarchs hunting lions and deer. Phoenician antiquities come from across the region, but the [[Tharros]] collection from [[Sardinia]] and the large number of Phoenician stelae from [[Carthage]] are outstanding. Another often overlooked highlight is [[Ancient history of Yemen|Yemeni]] antiquities, the finest collection outside that country. Furthermore, the museum has a representative collection of [[Dilmun]] and [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] material excavated from various burial mounds at the ancient sites of [[A'ali]] and [[Shakhura]] in Bahrain.

From the modern state of [[Syria]] come almost forty funerary busts from [[Palmyra]] and a group of stone [[reliefs]] from the excavations of [[Max von Oppenheim]] at [[Tell Halaf]] that was purchased in 1920. More material followed from the excavations of [[Max Mallowan]] at [[Chagar Bazar]] and [[Tell Brak]] in 1935–1938 and from Woolley at [[Alalakh]] in the years just before and after the [[Second World War]]. Mallowan returned with his wife [[Agatha Christie]] to carry out further digs at Nimrud in the postwar period which secured many [[Nimrud Ivories|important artefacts]] for the museum. The collection of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] material was strengthened by the work of [[Kathleen Kenyon]] at [[Jericho]] in the 1950s and the acquisition in 1980 of around 17,000 objects found at [[Lachish]] by the Wellcome-Marston expedition of 1932–1938.  Archaeological digs are still taking place where permitted in the Middle East, and, depending on the country, the museum continues to receive a share of the finds from sites such as [[:de:Tell es-Sa'idiyeh|Tell es Sa'idiyeh]] in Jordan.

The museum's collection of [[Islamic art]], including archaeological material, numbers about 40,000 objects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/pm_partner.php?id=Mus01;uk&amp;type=museum&amp;theme=ISL&amp;|title=Museum With No Frontiers| publisher=Discover Islamic Art| accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the largest of its kind in the world. As such, it contains a broad range of pottery, paintings, tiles, metalwork, glass, seals, and inscriptions from across the Islamic world, from [[Spain]] in the west to [[India]] in the east. It is particularly famous for its collection of [[İznik pottery|Iznik]] ceramics (the largest in the world), a highlight of which is the mosque lamp from the [[Dome of the Rock]], mediaeval metalwork such as the Vaso Vescovali with its depictions of the [[Zodiac]], a fine selection of [[astrolabes]], and [[Mughal paintings]] and precious artwork including a large [[Jade Terrapin from Allahabad|jade terrapin]] made for the Emperor [[Jahangir]]. Thousands of objects were excavated after the war by professional archaeologists at Iranian sites such as [[Siraf]] by [[David Whitehouse]] and [[Alamut Castle]] by Peter Willey. The collection was augmented in 1983 by the [[Frederick DuCane Godman|Godman]] bequest of Iznik, [[Hispano-Moresque]] and early Iranian pottery. Artefacts from the Islamic world are on display in Gallery 34 of the museum.

A representative selection from the Department of Middle East, including the most important pieces, are on display in 13 galleries throughout the museum and total some 4,500 objects. A whole suite of rooms on the ground floor display the sculptured reliefs from the Assyrian palaces at Nineveh, Nimrud and Khorsabad, while 8 galleries on the upper floor hold smaller material from ancient sites across the [[Middle East]]. The remainder form the study collection which ranges in size from beads to large sculptures. They include approximately 130,000 [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] from Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/middle_east/history_of_the_collection.aspx |title=History of the Collection: Middle East |work=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Department of Prints and Drawings===

The Department of [[Old master print|Prints]] and Drawings holds the national collection of [[Western art history|Western]] prints and drawings. It ranks as one of the largest and best [[print room]] collections in existence alongside the [[Albertina, Vienna|Albertina]] in Vienna, the Paris collections and the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]]. The holdings are easily accessible to the general public in the Study Room, unlike many such collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/prints_and_drawings/facilities_and_services/study_room.aspx |title=Study room page |work=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department also has its own exhibition gallery in Room 90, where the displays and exhibitions change several times a year.&lt;ref name=bmgal&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/prints_and_drawings/galleries.aspx |title=Prints and Drawings galleries |work=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its foundation in 1808, the prints and drawings collection has grown to international renown as one of the richest and most representative collections in the world. There are approximately 50,000 drawings and over two million prints.&lt;ref name=bmgal/&gt; The collection of drawings covers the period from the 14th century to the present, and includes many works of the highest quality by the leading artists of the [[Western art history|European schools]]. The collection of prints covers the tradition of fine [[printmaking]] from its beginnings in the 15th century up to the present, with near complete holdings of most of the great names before the 19th century. Key benefactors to the department have been [[Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode]], [[Richard Payne Knight]], John Malcolm, [[Campbell Dodgson]], César Mange de Hauke and [[Tomás Harris]].

There are groups of drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], (including [[Epifania (Michelangelo drawing)|his only surviving full-scale cartoon]]), [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]] (a collection of 138 drawings is one of the finest in existence), [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]] and [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], and largely complete collections of the works of all the great printmakers including [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]] (99 [[engraving]]s, 6 [[etching]]s and most of his 346 [[woodcut]]s), Rembrandt and [[Francisco Goya|Goya]]. More than 30,000 British drawings and [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] include important examples of work by [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]], [[Paul Sandby|Sandby]], [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]], [[Thomas Girtin|Girtin]], [[John Constable|Constable]], [[John Sell Cotman|Cotman]], [[David Cox (artist)|Cox]], [[James Gillray|Gillray]], [[Thomas Rowlandson|Rowlandson]] and [[George Cruikshank|Cruikshank]], as well as all the great [[Victorian era|Victorians]]. There are about a million British prints including more than 20,000 satires and outstanding collections of works by [[William Blake]] and [[Thomas Bewick]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. The great eleven volume [[Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum]] compiled between 1870 and 1954 is the definitive reference work for the study of British Satirical prints. Over 500,000 objects from the department are now on the online collection database, many with high quality images.&lt;ref&gt;Searches on 8 January 2012, return totals of 700,000, but many are in other departments&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 donation of £1 million enabled the museum to acquire a complete set of [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Vollard Suite]]''.&lt;ref name="TelegNov11"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8923722/City-fund-manager-in-1m-Picasso-giveaway.html| title=City fund manager in £1m Picasso giveaway| work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| first=Anita |last=Singh| accessdate=19 May 2012| date=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Department of Britain, Europe and Prehistory===

[[File:Waddesdon_Bequest_(2).JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|Display case of Renaissance metalware from the [[Waddesdon Bequest]]]]
The Department of Britain, Europe and Prehistory is responsible for collections that cover a vast expanse of time and geography. It includes some of the earliest objects made by humans in east Africa over 2 million years ago, as well as [[Prehistoric]] and neolithic objects from other parts of the world; and the art and archaeology of Europe from the earliest times to the present day. Archeological excavation of prehistoric material took off and expanded considerably in the twentieth century and the department now has literally millions of objects from the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] periods throughout the world, as well as from the [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron age]] in Europe. Stone Age material from Africa has been donated by famous archaeologists such as [[Louis Leakey|Louis]] and [[Mary Leakey]], and [[Gertrude Caton–Thompson]]. Paleolithic objects from the [[William Allen Sturge|Sturge]], [[Henry Christy|Christy]] and [[Édouard Lartet|Lartet]] collections include some of the earliest works of art from Europe. Many Bronze Age objects from across Europe were added during the nineteenth century, often from large collections built up by excavators and scholars such as [[William Greenwell|Greenwell]] in Britain, [[Thomas Tobin|Tobin]] and Cooke in Ireland, [[William Collings Lukis|Lukis]] and de la Grancière in Brittany, [[Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae|Worsaae]] in Denmark, [[Luis Siret|Siret]] at [[El Argar]] in Spain, and [[Gustav Klemm|Klemm]] and Edelmann in Germany. A representative selection of Iron Age artefacts from [[Hallstatt]] were acquired as a result of the [[Sir John Evans|Evans]]/[[Sir John Lubbock|Lubbock]] excavations and from [[Giubiasco]] in [[Ticino]] through the [[Swiss National Museum]].

In addition, the British Museum's collections covering the period AD 300 to 1100 are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world, extending from Spain to the [[Black Sea]] and from North Africa to [[Scandinavia]]; a representative selection of these has recently been redisplayed in a newly refurbished gallery. Important collections include [[Latvia]]n, [[Norway|Norwegian]], [[Gotland]]ic and [[Merovingian]] material from [[Johann Karl Bähr]], Alfred Heneage Cocks, Sir James Curle and Philippe Delamain respectively. However, the undoubted highlight from the early mediaeval period are the magnificent items from the [[Sutton Hoo]] royal grave, generously donated to the nation by the landowner [[Edith Pretty]]. The department includes the national collection of [[horology]] with one of the most wide-ranging assemblage of clocks, watches and other timepieces in Europe, with masterpieces from every period in the development of time-keeping. Choice horological pieces came from the [[Octavius Morgan|Morgan]] and [[Courtenay Adrian Ilbert|Ilbert]] collections. The department is also responsible for the curation of [[Romano-British]] objects – the museum has by far the most extensive such collection in Britain and one of the most representative regional collections in Europe outside [[Italy]]. It is particularly famous for the large number of late Roman silver treasures, many of which were found in [[East Anglia]], the most important of which is the [[Mildenhall Treasure]]. The museum purchased many Roman-British objects from the antiquarian [[Charles Roach Smith]] in 1856.  These quickly formed the nucleus of the collection.

Objects from the Department of Prehistory and Europe are mostly found on the upper floor of the museum, with a suite of galleries numbered from 38 to 51. Most of the collection is stored in its [[archive]] facilities, where it is available for [[research]] and study.

Key highlights of the collections include:

===Department of Asia===
{{Main article|The British Museum Department of Asia}}
[[File:Room 95-6752.JPG|thumb|Room 95 –  The Sir [[Sir Percival David, 2nd Baronet|Percival David]] collection of Chinese ceramics]]
The scope of the Department of Asia is extremely broad; its collections of over 75,000 objects cover the material culture of the whole Asian continent (from East, South, Central and South-East Asia) and from the Neolithic up to the present day. Until recently, this department concentrated on collecting Oriental antiquities from urban or semi-urban societies across the Asian continent. Many of those objects were collected by colonial officers and explorers in former parts of the [[British Empire]], especially the Indian subcontinent. Examples include the collections made by individuals such as [[Hindu Stuart|Charles Stuart]], [[James Prinsep]], [[Charles Masson]], Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]], Sir [[Harold Arthur Deane|Harold Deane]] and Sir [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]]. A large number of Chinese antiquities were purchased from the Anglo-Greek banker [[George Eumorfopoulos]] in the 1930s. In the second half of the twentieth century, the museum greatly benefited from the bequest of the [[philanthropist]] PT Brooke Sewell, which allowed the department to purchase many objects and fill in gaps in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Babs.Guthrie|url=http://www.untoldlondon.org.uk/collections/SE000073.html|title=Collection page|publisher=Untold London|accessdate=4 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921153753/http://www.untoldlondon.org.uk/collections/SE000073.html|archivedate=21 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/en/japaninfo/culture/britishmuseum.html|title=Embassy of Japan in the UK|publisher=Japan Embassy|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/asia.aspx |title=Department of Asia|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the ethnographic collections from Asia were transferred to the department. These reflect the diverse environment of the largest continent in the world and range from India to China, the Middle East to Japan. Much of the ethnographic material comes from objects originally owned by tribal cultures and [[hunter-gatherers]], many of whose way of life has disappeared in the last century. Particularly valuable collections are from the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] (much assembled by the British naval officer [[Maurice Vidal Portman|Maurice Portman]]), Sri Lanka (especially through the colonial administrator [[Hugh Nevill]]), Northern Thailand, south-west China, the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] of Hokaidu in Japan (chief among them the collection of the Scottish zoologist [[John Anderson (zoologist)|John Anderson]]), Siberia and the islands of South-East Asia, especially Borneo. The latter benefited from the purchase in 1905 of the [[Sarawak]] collection put together by Dr [[Charles Hose]], as well as from other colonial officers such as Edward A Jeffreys. In addition, a unique and valuable group of objects from Java, including shadow puppets and a [[gamelan]] musical set, was assembled by [[Sir Stamford Raffles]].

The principal gallery devoted to Asian art in the museum is Gallery 33 with its comprehensive display of Chinese, Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asian objects. An adjacent gallery showcases the Amaravati sculptures and monuments. Other galleries on the upper floors are devoted to its Japanese, Korean, painting and [[calligraphy]], and Chinese ceramics collections.

Key highlights of the collections include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/departments_all_relationships.aspx?Title=Asia&amp;ContentType=Department&amp;PageId=551 |title=Department of Asia – Related Highlight Objects |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Department of Africa, Oceania and the Americas===
[[File:Wellcome Trust Gallery + Living &amp; Dying (Room 24).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Room 24 – The [[Wellcome Trust]] Gallery of Living and Dying, with [[Hoa Hakananai'a]], a ''[[moai]]'', in the centre]]
The British Museum houses one of the world's most comprehensive collections of [[Ethnographic]] material from Africa, Oceania and the Americas, representing the cultures of [[indigenous peoples]] throughout the world. Over 350,000 objects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/the_museum/departments/africa,_oceania_and_americas.aspx |title=Africa, Oceania and the Americas |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; spanning thousands of years tells the history of mankind from three major continents and many rich and diverse cultures; the collecting of modern artefacts is ongoing. Many individuals have added to the department's collection over the years but those assembled by [[Henry Christy]], [[Harry Geoffrey Beasley|Harry Beasley]] and [[William Ockelford Oldman|William Oldman]] are outstanding. Objects from this department are mostly on display in several galleries on the ground and lower floors. Gallery 24 displays [[ethnographic]] from every continent while adjacent galleries focus on [[North America]] and [[Mexico]]. A long suite of rooms (Gallery 25) on the lower floor display African art. There are plans in place to develop permanent galleries for showcasing art from Oceania and South America.

'''Africa'''
[[File:African_throwing_knives.jpg|thumb|left|Room 25 – Collection of African [[Throwing knife|throwing knives]]]]
The Sainsbury African Galleries display 600 objects from the greatest permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world. The three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for the museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of everyday life. A great addition was material amassed by Sir [[Henry Wellcome]], which was donated by the [[Wellcome Collection|Wellcome Historical Medical Museum]] in 1954. Highlights of the African collection include objects found at [[Senegambian stone circles|megalithic circles]] in The Gambia, a dozen exquisite [[Kongo ivories#Afro-Portuguese ivories|Afro-Portuguese ivories]], a series of soapstone figures from the [[Kissi people]] in Sierra Leone and Liberia, Asante goldwork and regalia from Ghana including the [[Thomas Edward Bowdich|Bowdich]] collection, the rare [[Akan Drum]] from the same region in west Africa, the [[Benin Bronzes|Benin]] and [[Igbo-Ukwu]] bronze sculptures, the beautiful [[Bronze Head of Queen Idia]], a magnificent [[Bronze Head from Ife|brass head]] of a Yoruba ruler and quartz throne from [[Ife]], a similar [[terracotta]] head from Iwinrin Grove near Ife, the [[Apapa Hoard]] from Lagos, southern Nigeria, an [[Ikom monoliths|Ikom monolith]] from [[Cross River State]], the [[Emil Torday|Torday]] collection of central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry from the [[Kuba Kingdom]] including three [[Ndop (Kuba)|royal figures]], the unique [[Luzira Head]] from Uganda, processional crosses and other ecclesiastical and royal material from [[Gondar]] and [[Amba Mariam|Magdala]], Ethiopia following the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]], excavated objects from [[Great Zimbabwe]] (that includes a unique soapstone, [[anthropomorphic]] figure) and satellite towns such as [[Mutare]] including a large hoard of Iron Age soapstone figures, a rare divining bowl from the [[Venda]] peoples and cave paintings and [[petroglyph]]s from [[Wildebeest Kuil Rock Art Centre|South Africa]].

'''Oceania'''

The British Museum's Oceanic collections originate from the vast area of the [[Pacific Ocean]], stretching from Papua New Guinea to Easter Island, from New Zealand to Hawaii. The three main anthropological groups represented in the collection are [[Polynesia]], [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]] – Aboriginal art from [[Australia]] is considered separately in its own right.  Metal working was not indigenous to Oceania before Europeans arrived, so many of the artefacts from the collection are made from stone, shell, bone and bamboo. Prehistoric objects from the region include a bird-shaped [[pestle]] and a group of stone [[Pestle and mortar|mortars]] from [[Papua New Guinea]]. The British Museum is fortunate in having some of the earliest Oceanic and Pacific collections, many of which were put together by members of [[James Cook|Cook]]'s and [[George Vancouver|Vancouver]]'s expeditions or by colonial administrators such as Sir [[George Grey]], Sir [[Frederick Broome]] and [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Arthur Gordon]], before Western culture significantly impacted on indigenous cultures. The [[Henry Wilson (sailor)|Wilson]] cabinet of curiosities from [[Palau]] is another example of pre-contact ware. The department has also benefited greatly from the legacy of pioneering [[anthropology|anthropologists]] such as [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Katherine Routledge]]. In addition, the [[Māori culture|Māori]] collection is the finest outside New Zealand with many intricately carved wooden and [[Hei-tiki|jade objects]] and the [[Aboriginal art]] collection is distinguished by its wide range of [[bark paintings]], including two very early bark etchings collected by [[John Hunter Kerr]]. A poignant artefact is the wooden shield found near [[Botany Bay]] during Cook's first voyage in 1770. A particularly important group of objects was purchased from the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1911, that includes the unique [[statue of A'a from Rurutu]] Island, the rare [[Mangareva Statue|idol]] from the isle of Mangareva and the Cook Islands [[Deity Figure from Rarotonga|deity figure]].  Other highlights include the huge Hawaiian statue of [[Kū|Kū-ka-ili-moku]] or god of war (one of three extant in the world) and the famous Easter Island statues [[Hoa Hakananai'a]] and [[Relocation of moai objects|Moai Hava]].

'''Americas'''
The Americas collection mainly consists of 19th and 20th century items although the [[Paracas culture|Paracas]], [[Moche culture|Moche]], [[Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]], [[Taino]] and other early cultures are well represented. The [[Kayung totem pole]], which was made in the late nineteenth century in the [[Queen Charlotte Islands]], dominates the Great Court and provides a fitting introduction to this very wide-ranging collections that stretches from the very north of the North American continent where the [[Inuit]] population has lived for centuries, to the tip of South America where indigenous tribes have long thrived in Patagonia. Highlights of the collection include [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal Canadian]] objects from Alaska and Canada collected by the [[Hugh Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale|5th Earl of Lonsdale]] and the [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Marquis of Lorne]], the [[E. G. Squier|Squier]] and [[Edwin Hamilton Davis|Davis]] collection of prehistoric mound relics from North America, a selection of pottery vessels found in cliff-dwellings at [[Mesa Verde]], a collection of turquoise Aztec [[Double-headed serpent|mosaics]] from Mexico (the largest in Europe), important artefacts from [[Teotihuacan Ocelot|Teotihuacan]] and [[Isla de Sacrificios]], several rare pre-Columbian manuscripts including the [[Codex Zouche-Nuttall]] and [[Codex Waecker-Gotter]], a spectacular series of Mayan [[Yaxchilan Lintel 24|lintels]] from [[Yaxchilan]] excavated by the British Mayanist [[Alfred Maudslay]], a very high quality Mayan collection that includes sculptures from [[Copán Bench Panel|Copan]], [[Tikal Temple I|Tikal]], [[Tulum Stela 1|Tulum]], [[Pusilha]], [[Naranjo]] and [[Nebaj]] (including the celebrated [[Fenton Vase]]), a group of [[Zemi Figures from Vere, Jamaica]], a number of prestigious pre-Columbian gold and [[Lake Guatavita|votive]] objects from Colombia, ethnographic objects from across the Amazon region including the [[Robert Hermann Schomburgk|Schomburgk]] collection, two rare [[Tiwanaku]] pottery vessels from [[Lake Titicaca]] and important items from [[Tierra del Fuego]] donated by Commander [[Phillip Parker King]].

===Department of Coins and Medals===
    {{main article|British Museum Department of Coins and Medals}}

The British Museum is home to one of the world's finest [[Numismatics|numismatic]] collections, comprising about a million objects, including coins, medals, tokens and paper money. The collection spans the entire history of coinage from its origins in the 7th century BC to the present day and is representative of both the [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]]. The Department of Coins and Medals was created in 1861 and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/publications/research_publications_series/2011/the_future_of_UK_numismatics.aspx ''The British Museum and the Future of UK Numismatics. Proceedings of a conference held to mark the 150th anniversary of the British Museum’s Department of Coins and Medals, 2011''], edited by Barrie Cook (British Museum Research Publication 183, 2011) {{ISBN|978-086159-183-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Department of Conservation and Scientific Research===
This department was founded in 1920. [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|Conservation]] has six specialist areas: ceramics &amp; glass; metals; organic material (including textiles); stone, wall paintings and mosaics; Eastern pictorial art and Western pictorial art. The science department&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/science/index.html|title=British Museum – Conservation and Scientific Research|work=thebritishmuseum.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; has and continues to develop techniques to date artefacts, analyse and identify the materials used in their manufacture, to identify the place an artefact originated and the techniques used in their creation. The department also publishes its findings and discoveries.

===Libraries and archives===
This department covers all levels of education, from casual visitors, schools, degree level and beyond. The museum's various libraries hold in excess of 350,000 books, journals and pamphlets covering all areas of the museum's collection. Also the general museum archives which date from its foundation in 1753 are overseen by this department; the individual departments have their own separate archives and libraries covering their various areas of responsibility, which can be consulted by the public on application.  The [[Anthropology]] Library is especially large, with 120,000 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;See the "Facilities and Services" tab on the home page for each department for details on each library; not all are kept at Bloomsbury. [https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/africa,_oceania,_americas/facilities_and_services.aspx Anthropology Library]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Paul Hamlyn]] Library, which had become the central reference library of the British Museum and the only library there freely open to the general public, closed permanently in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press/statements/paul_hamlyn_library.aspx |title=Paul Hamlyn Library |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website and online database of the collection also provide increasing amounts of information.

==British Museum Press==
The British Museum Press (BMP) is the publishing business and a division of the British Museum Company Ltd., a company and a charity (established in 1973) wholly owned by the trustees of the British Museum.&lt;ref name="aboutbmp"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/services/the_british_museum_press/about_the_british_museum_press.aspx |title=About the BMP |accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BMP publishes both popular and scholarly illustrated books to accompany the exhibition programme and explore aspects of the general collection. Profits from their sales goes to support the British Museum.&lt;ref name="aboutbmp" /&gt;

Scholarly titles are published in the Research Publications series, all of which are [[peer-reviewed]]. This series was started in 1978 and was originally called Occasional Papers. The series is designed to disseminate research on items in the collection. Between six and eight titles are published each year in this series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/publications/research_publications_series.aspx |title=Research Publications |accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[File:Elgin Marbles east pediment.jpg|thumb|right|A few of the [[Elgin Marbles]] (also known as the Parthenon Marbles) from the East [[Pediment]] of the [[Parthenon]] in Athens.]]

It is a point of controversy whether museums should be allowed to possess artifacts taken from other countries,&lt;ref name="looted art"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/02/well-travelled-artefacts|title=Where it is safe to do so, cultural artefacts should be repatriated|journal=The Economist|language=en|access-date=18 April 2018|date=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the British Museum is a notable target for criticism. The [[Elgin Marbles]], [[Benin Bronzes]] and the [[Rosetta Stone]] are among the most disputed objects in its collections, and organisations have been formed demanding the return of these artefacts to their native countries of [[Greece]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Egypt]] respectively.  Parthenon Marbles claimed by Greece were also claimed by UNESCO among others for restitution. From 1801 to 1812, Elgin's agents took about half of the surviving sculptures of the Parthenon, as well as sculptures from the Propylaea and Erechtheum.

In recent years, controversies pertaining to reparation of artefacts taken from the [[Old Summer Palace]] in [[Beijing]] during the [[Anglo-French invasion of China]] in 1860 have also begun to surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30810596 |title=The palace of shame that makes China angry |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=3 January 2015| work=BBC News |last=Bowbly |first=Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ransacking and destruction of the Chinese palaces has led to unhealed historical wounds in Chinese culture. [[Victor Hugo]] condemned the French and British for their plundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Chinese expedition: Victor Hugo on the sack of the Summer Palace |url=http://www.napoleon.org/en/reading_room/articles/files/477511.asp |website=www.napoleon.org |accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Museum and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, among others, have been asked since 2009 to open their archives for investigation by a team of Chinese investigators as a part of an international mission to document lost national treasures. However, there have been fears that the United Kingdom may be asked to return these treasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/6374959/China-to-study-British-Museum-for-looted-artefacts.html |title=China to study British Museum for looted artefacts |date=19 October 2009 |accessdate=3 January 2015 | work=The Telegraph |last=Foster |first=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2010}}, [[Neil MacGregor]], the Director of the British Museum, said he hoped that both British and Chinese investigators would work together on the controversial collection, which continues to result in resentment in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8134254/British-Museum-welcomes-investigation-with-Chinese-over-artefacts.html |title=British Museum 'welcomes investigation with Chinese over artefacts' |date=15 November 2010 |accessdate=15 January 2016 |work=The Telegraph |last=Foster |first=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Museum has refused to return these artefacts, stating that the "restitutionist premise, that whatever was made in a country must return to an original geographical site, would empty both the British Museum and the other great museums of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/gr/andart.html |title=Greek and Roman Antiquities |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523194402/http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/gr/andart.html |archivedate=23 May 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum has also argued that the British Museum Act of 1963 legally prevents any object from leaving its collection once it has entered it. Nevertheless, it has returned items such as the Tasmanian Ashes after a 20-year-long battle with Australia.&lt;ref name="ktixsj"&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[Associated Press]] |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/news/2007-10-16-museum-aboriginal-remains_N.htm |title=British museum agrees to return Aboriginal remains to Australia |work=[[USA Today]] |date=16 October 2007 |accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Museum continues to assert that it is an appropriate custodian and has an inalienable right to its disputed artefacts under [[British law]].

In 2016, the British Museum moved its bag searches to marquees in the front courtyard and beside the rear entrance. This has been criticised by heritage groups as out-of-character with the historic building. The British Museum clarified that the change was purely logistical to save space in the main museum entrance and did not reflect any escalation in threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.felixmagazine.com/museum-bag-searches-getting-hand/|title=Are the British Museum Bag Searches Getting Out of Hand? – Felix Magazine|date=17 March 2017|work=Felix Magazine|access-date=20 March 2017|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320233321/http://www.felixmagazine.com/museum-bag-searches-getting-hand/|archive-date=20 March 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Center for Ethical Solutions (CES)''', founded by [[Sigrid Fry-Revere]], is a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit [[bioethics]] [[think tank]] based in Lovettsville, Virginia whose mission is to find practical solutions to controversial problems in the field of [[medical ethics]]. CES supports research and public education, seeking to achieve its goals through research and developing products including books and documentary films to educate the public. Lobbying and participation in political campaigns are specifically excluded from its activities.

*'''Solving the Organ Shortage'''
:CES is studying possible ways to solve the US organ shortage by examining the different [[organ donation]] systems in [[Iran]], which has eliminated its country's waiting list for kidneys&lt;ref name="cjasn.asnjournals.org"&gt;Ghods, Ahad J., and Shekoufeh Savaj. 2006.

The "Iranian model" involves legalizing compensation for organ donation,&lt;ref name="cjasn.asnjournals.org"/&gt; and the "Spanish model" involves a comprehensive national procurement system, maintaining positive views of organ donation in the mass media, and proactive donor detection, all coordinated by the [[Spanish Transplant Organization|National Transplant Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ont.es/contenido.jsp?id_nodo=5&amp;&amp;&amp;keyword=&amp;auditoria=F The Spanish Model] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606195313/http://www.ont.es/contenido.jsp?id_nodo=5&amp;&amp;&amp;keyword=&amp;auditoria=F |date=June 6, 2008 }}". Organización Nacional de Trasplantes. Retrieved 2009-06-30.&lt;/ref&gt; While Spain does employ an opt-out system for organ donation, current legislation requires consent from the relatives of the deceased before organs can be donated, and research has suggested that the increased rate of organ donation should be attributed to the actions of the National Transplant Organization and not the legislative approach.&lt;ref&gt;UK [[Organ donation taskforce]] report ''The potential impact of an opt out system for organ donation in the UK'', page 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
:CES is currently creating a documentary film which chronicles the struggles of American Steve Lessin as he negotiates [[Chronic kidney disease|end stage renal disease]].

*'''Meeting the Needs of America's Veterans'''
:Though the project is still in early stages of development, CES intends to study the medical and healthcare needs of American veterans, including reintegration into society, as well as the readiness of the US healthcare system to accommodate the needs of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Special attention will be paid to the need for mental health care, as a higher percentage of returning soldiers are experiencing [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] than from previous military operations.&lt;ref&gt;The Associated Press (2004-06-30).

*'''Legal Trends in Bioethics'''
:Starting in the Fall of 2009 CES will publish [[Legal Trends in Bioethics]] through its website.  Previously a column in the quarterly Journal of Clinical Ethics, Legal Trends tracks developments in the field of bioethics.  "Through publication on the Internet, the information provided by the column will be more up-to-date and relevant for anyone interested in tracking legal issues in bioethics."&lt;ref&gt;Taken from CATO-at-Liberty blog. http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2007/09/23/legal-trends-in-bioethics/ Accessed 31 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Past editions authored by Sigrid Fry-Revere will also be available through the website.[http://ethical-solutions.org/Legal%20Trends.html]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

===Proposed projects===

*'''Pain Management'''
:This project explores social attitudes towards and public awareness of the need for [[pain management]] with potentially addictive [[opiate]]s for patients with [[end-of-life care|end-of-life]] or serious [[chronic pain]].

*'''Patient Advocacy'''
:CES plans to examine whether [[patient advocacy]] can or should be integrated into common healthcare practices. Currently, the private sector offers private advocates who oversee customers' medical care and act as liaisons between patients and healthcare providers, but this service is often financially accessible to only the wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, Christopher (2009-02-02).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2548">A '''certificate of public convenience and necessity''' or '''certificate of public convenience''' is a type of [[regulatory compliance]] certification for [[public service]] industries. [[Private companies]] wishing to provide essential public services in certain countries must be granted a CPCN before constructing facilities and offering services.

==Philippines==
In the Philippines, a certificate of public convenience (CPC) is required for private provision of public services for which no franchise, either municipal or legislative, is required by law, such as a [[common carrier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batasnatin.com/law-library/mercantile-law/transportation-laws/2218-certificate-of-public-convenience-cpc.html|title=What is a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC)?|work= Philippine Law Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The first [[U.S. state]] statutes for certificate of public convenience (CPCN) were issued in 1870, and the [[U.S. Congress]] included a certification provision in [[U.S. federal law]] in the [[Transportation Act of 1920]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/1121802?sid=21105515254613&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4|title=Origins of the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity: Developments in the States, 1870 - 1920|last=Jones|first=William K.|journal=[[Columbia Law Review]]|volume=79|number=3|pages=426–516|doi=10.2307/1121802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of industries requiring a CPCN from a U.S. state include the provision of [[telecommunications]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/C78F4BE884AA2FA885257687006F3964?OpenDocument|title=CPCN: Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity|publisher=[[New York State Public Service Commission]]|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; transportation of [[natural gas]] in [[Alaska]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/720a|title=15 U.S. Code § 720a - Issuance of certificate of public convenience and necessity|work=[[Legal Information Institute]]|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a range of public services in [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=022000050K8-406|title= Illinois Compiled Statutes: Sec. 8-406.

'''John Christopher Hughes''' "'''Christie'''" '''Davies''' (25 December 1941 – 26 August 2017) was a British [[sociologist]], [[professor emeritus]] of sociology at the [[University of Reading]], England, the author of many articles and books on criminology, the sociology of morality, censorship, and humour. He was also a visiting professor in India, Poland, United States, and Australia.&lt;ref name=mn&gt;''The Mirth of Nations'' book cover&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reading.ac.uk/AcaDepts/lw/Sociol/publish/people/academic/christie/bio.htm Professor Davies; staff webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reading.ac.uk/internal/staffportal/news/articles/spsn-739835.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born John Christopher Hughes Davies in [[Cheam, Surrey]].&lt;ref name="Tele01"&gt;{{cite news | title=Obituaries: Christie Davies | work=The Daily Telegraph (UK) | date=16 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}} His parents were Welsh, his father an inspector of schools and mother a teacher.&lt;ref name=Tele01/&gt;{{rp|31}} He attended secondary school at [[Dynevor School, Swansea|Dynevor School]] in Swansea, Wales. He then studied at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] and graduated with a [[double first]] in Economics. In later life, Davies received a PhD from the same university ([[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]) based on his published works.&lt;ref name=Tele01/&gt;{{rp|31}}

==Career==
In 1964, Davies taught Economics at the [[University of Adelaide]], [[South Australia]].&lt;ref name=Tele01/&gt;{{rp|31}} After coming back to the UK, he spent two years at the [[BBC]] as a radio producer. He then returned to the academia, lecturing at the [[University of Leeds]] for three years, followed by a stint as a visiting lecturer in India.&lt;ref name=Tele01/&gt;{{rp|31}} In 1972 he joined the [[University of Reading]] as a lecturer in Sociology, receiving promotion to a Professor in 1984. In 2002 he retired and was appointed Professor Emeritus at the same university.&lt;ref name=Tele01/&gt;{{rp|31}}

In addition to numerous works on humour, censorship and morality, Davies also published a collection of humorous fantasy stories titled ''Dewi the Dragon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bio: Christie Davies|url=http://www.hungarianreview.com/author/christie_davies|website=Hungarian Review|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humour research==
In his 2002 book ''The Mirth of Nations'', Davies criticised the theories which derive humor from conflict and superiority, and argued instead that humor is a form of [[play (activity)|play]] – a play with aggression, superiority, and taboo-breaking. He also argued against the [[Freud]]ian theory about [[Jewish jokes]] being mostly self-deprecating, claiming that instead they are based on the cultural tradition of analytical thinking and self-awareness. American folklorist [[Alan Dundes]] called the book "the provocative critique of previous scholarship on the subject".&lt;ref name=mn/&gt;

Davies was past president of the [[International Society for Humor Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hnu.edu/ishs/ContactCenter.htm International Society for Humor Studies webpage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716111959/http://www.hnu.edu/ishs/ContactCenter.htm |date=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resettling Hong Kong inhabitants in Northern Ireland==
In 1983, Davies warned that when Britain handed Hong Kong [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|back]] to [[People's Republic of China|China]] in 1997 there would be no future for its 5.5 million inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3147870/Should-entire-population-Hong-Kong-moved-NORTHERN-IRELAND-Bizarre-plan-pondered-mandarins-territory-handed-China-one-joked-cause-exodus-Irish-residents-way.html | date = 3 July 2015 | publisher = [[Daily Mail|Mail Online]] | title = Bizarre plan pondered by mandarins}}&lt;/ref&gt; He jokingly suggested a new "city state" could be created near [[Magilligan|Magilligan Point]] in between [[Coleraine]] and [[Derry]] for resettling Hong Kong inhabitants. Files from [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] show that the idea triggered  some debate among [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Whitehall mandarins]]. David Snoxell, a retired diplomat who took part in the debates revealed it was "a spoof between colleagues who had a sense of humour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33361999 | date = 3 July 2015 | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | title = National Archives reveal Hong Kong-to-NI 'spoof'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29726">[[Non-profit]] housing [[real estate development|developers]] build [[affordable housing]] for individuals under-served by the private market.  The non-profit housing sector is composed of [[community development corporation]]s (CDC) and national and regional non-profit housing organizations whose mission is to provide for the needy, the elderly, working households, and others that the private housing market does not adequately serve.  Of the total 4.6 million units in the social housing sector, non-profit developers have produced approximately 1.547 million units, or roughly one-third of the total stock.&lt;ref name="Bratt 2009"&gt;Bratt, Rachel (2009). Should We Foster the Non-Profit Housing Sector as Developers and Owners of Subsidized Rental Housing. ''Joint Center for Housing Studies''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since non-profit developers seldom have the financial resources or access to [[Financial capital|capital]] that for-profit entities do, they often use multiple layers of [[financing]], usually from a variety of sources for both development and operation of these affordable housing units.

==Non-profit development vs. for-profit development==
Both the non-profit sector and for-profit sector build affordable housing, although missions, operations and financial and technical abilities differ.  The core difference between a for-profit and a non-profit organization is that [[for-profit]] entities operate to produce returns to owners or [[shareholders]], whereas non-profits either reinvest profits into the organization and/or donate money to serve their mission.&lt;ref name="Bratt 2009" /&gt;   This inherent difference of organizational objective dictates the operational strategy of their projects; for-profits are likely to create affordable housing that maximizes profits, where non-profits aim to serve the most vulnerable populations.  Examples of strategies that for-profit entities use to maximize profits include locating their projects in neighborhoods with strong rental markets, mixing market-rate units into their buildings to increase operating income, and developing an exit strategy to maximize sale proceeds from their building.  Conversely, non-profits are more likely to develop in distressed neighborhoods, dedicate all of their units to low-income tenants and operate projects for the long-term in order to fulfill the mission of affordability.&lt;ref name="ULI"&gt;Urban Land Institute (2005).  ''ULI Community Catalyst Report Number 3: Best Practices in Production of Affordable Housing''. Washington D.C.: The Urban Land Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of their business strategy, non-profits lack the financial and technical resources of for-profits, thus, forcing them to rely on multiple funding sources such as public and private [[grants]] and [[subsidies]] in order to cover development costs.  Using multiple funding sources is risky because it creates complex financing which can be both timely and expensive.&lt;ref name=ULI /&gt;   Most of these public and private sources exist exclusively for non-profit entities and although this provides an advantage for the non-profit industry, for-profits would often refrain from spending the uncompensated time and effort for such complicated deals.&lt;ref name="ULI" /&gt;

==Issues during pre-development==
Pre-development efforts such as acquiring land, forming [[partnerships]], performing [[due diligence]] and gaining [[entitlements]] is the important first steps developers make before a project is launched. A major problem for non-profit developers is that their deals are thinly capitalized and funding pre-development costs is difficult; these costs include [[architecture]], [[engineering]], site control and [[feasibility study|feasibility]] analysis.&lt;ref name=ULI /&gt;   Non-profits also confront [[marketing|marketability]], feasibility and financing problems that usually deter for-profit developers.  Pre-development is essential for packaging a project [[proposal (business)|proposal]], and funding is necessary to work through any issues during this time.  Lack of pre-development funding can lead to weak project proposals and failure to seize opportunities to acquire land.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, Christopher (1993). Non-Profit Housing Development: Status, Trends and Prospects. ''Housing Policy Debate'', 4(3),369-414.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, lack of funds increases development risks and decreases the likelihood of attracting capital [[investors]] or securing loans from private [[bank]]s.&lt;ref name=Walker /&gt;

Beginning in the 1980s, national, state and local intermediaries formed to improve the financial and technical plight of non-profit housing developers.  These organizations improved the mobilization of capital including project and operating support, pre-development finance, and provided technical assistance for finance packaging.  As a result, non-profit developers began to increase their technical competence and reduce the risk to potential public and private sector investors.&lt;ref name=Walker /&gt;

National intermediaries include organizations such as the Local Initiatives Support Coalition (LISC), the [[Enterprise Foundation]], [[Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation]] (NRC) and the Housing Assistance Council (HAC).  These organizations help non-profit housing developers access [[tax credits]], corporate [[equity (finance)|equity]] investment, [[secondary mortgage market]]s and lender commitments as well as offering training courses on real estate development and finance and community organizing and [[social service]] provision.  Furthermore, these groups help non-profits form partnerships with each other and public and private parties, helping to foster support and funding for non-profit housing development.&lt;ref name=Walker /&gt;

==Ownership==
Non-profits generally form partnerships to develop and own affordable housing projects.  Some considerations that non-profits evaluate before creating an ownership entity include the ease and speed with which decisions can be made, efficient provision of property management operations, and the number of investors required to meet equity needs and investment objectives of the investors relative to project [[cash flow]], [[Capital appreciation|appreciation]], and attitudes towards [[personal liability]].  Furthermore, impacts of [[tax]] considerations for the ownership entity itself as well as individual investors are also evaluated; this includes apportioning [[ordinary income]] liability and [[capital gains]] liability.&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe, G.

Forms of legal ownership structures that non-profits create include [[general partnerships]], [[limited partnerships]] and [[limited liability companies]] (LLC).  In a general partnership, two or more entities come together to form a new business entity where each partner is jointly and severally liable for all legal and financial obligations.  Also,each member has a right to participate in all partnership decisions unless specified otherwise in the [[partnership agreement]].  Partnerships are not tax entities, so all tax consequences are passed directly to individual partners; partners agree to shares of tax consequences, as well as cash flow and appreciation of the project.  Limited partnerships are similar to a general partnership except that one or more partners act as a general partner, and the rest of the partners are limited partners.  Limited partners are treated differently than general partners in that they are only liable for the capital invested and cannot participate in routine operations or decisions of the partnership without losing their limited liability protection.  The partnership agreement defines the responsibility of each partner and how the share profits and tax consequences.  An LLC combines the advantages of a corporation for personal liability purposes (liability is limited to the amount of capital invested) and those of a partnership for tax purposes (the entity is not taxed).&lt;ref&gt;Brueggeman and Fisher (2011).

==Financing==
Since non-profits lack the funds to develop and operate their buildings they seek funding from external sources such as local, state and federal governments and private entities.   Projects often have layered subsidies in the form of equity, debt, grants and tax concessions (non-profits are tax-exempt entities per section 501(c)(3) of the IRS tax code).&lt;ref name=Walker /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Service.

====Low-Income Housing Tax Credit====
{{Main|Low-Income Housing Tax Credit}}
Through LIHTC, investors receive a tax shelter of one dollar ($1) for every tax credit received over a 10-year period.  The price of individual tax credits may vary and does not necessarily have to be a 1:1 exchange.  The dollar amount of tax credits available to a state is determined by that state's population.  Developers apply to state agencies, such as a state [[Housing Finance Agency]], for allocation of tax credits.  After receiving the tax credits, the developer then sells the credits to investors.  No less than 10% of a state's tax credit allocations must be allocated towards housing development by non-profit organizations.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;

When selling LIHTCs, developers typically enter into a limited partnership ([[Limited partnership|LP]] or [[Limited liability company|LLC]]) with an investor (see discussion above regarding ownership) where the investor becomes 99% partner.&lt;ref name="HUD on LIHTC"&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|title=Syndication|url=http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/affordablehousing/training/web/lihtc/basics/syndication.cfm|work=LIHTC Basics|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   While LIHTC can be used to entice investors to a project, they seldom cover total development costs and developers must find additional sources of "[[gap financing]]".&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;

====Section 8====
{{Main|Section 8 (housing)}}
Currently, the Housing Choice Voucher program (through Section 8) provides funds to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) which pay single and multi-family homeowners the difference between 30% of a tenants’ income and “fair market rent” for providing affordable housing.  There are two methods of distributing Section 8 funds: through project-based assistance and through tenant-based assistance.  Non-profit organizations are not directly allocated project-based assistance; therefore, a partnership with a PHA is required to take advantage of this program. PHAs may use up to 20% of their voucher allocation towards project-based vouchers.&lt;ref name="HUD's Sec 8 Project FAQs"&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|title=Project Based Vouchers - Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=DOC_9157.pdf|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For non-profit developers that own the land where their housing development is located, Section 8 generally affects a project's income since rental subsidies are being provided. Project-based vouchers allow owners to dedicate a portion or all of their property for affordable rental housing and receive subsidies for doing so.  In the event a tenant decides to move out of a subsidized unit, that unit remains affordable.  In contrast, with tenant-based vouchers, the subsidy is tied to the tenant, thus the tenant may move from one household to another and still be eligible for housing assistance.&lt;ref name="HUD's Sec 8 Project FAQs" /&gt;

====Section 202 &amp; Section 811====
{{Main|Supportive Housing}}
Section 202 and 811 are HUD programs that provide capital grants for non-profits to finance the construction, rehabilitation or acquisition of supportive housing for the elderly (Section 202) and the disabled (Section 811).  These programs ensure that non-profit owners of elderly and disabled housing under these programs will not have to pay for long-term financing, by eliminating the need for debt and rental subsidies in order to support very low-income tenants.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program. Accessed December 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons With Disabilities. Accessed December 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal pass-through===
The following funding programs described are provided by HUD, but allocated to states and local jurisdictions for distribution to projects.  Housing developers apply for funds through the states and local jurisdictions; however, the subsidy funding actually comes from federal monies.

====Community Development Block Grant====
{{Main|Community Development Block Grant}}
The CDBG program was established by the [[Housing and Community Development Act of 1974]] and replaced eight federal programs which granted funds to states and local communities based on project-specific proposals and had strict regulations on how the money could be allocated.  In contrast, the CDBG program allows states and municipalities to budget CDBG funds based on their consolidated plan (a mandatory plan which outlines the community’s housing needs, its 5-year strategy, and a 1-year plan focused on resources and implementation).&lt;ref name=Schwartz&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=Alex F.|title=Housing Policy in the United States (2nd Ed.)|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-415-80234-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community participation is required when creating a consolidated plan.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;&lt;ref name="HUD on CDBG"&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|title=Community Development Block Grant Program - CDBG|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/comm_planning/communitydevelopment/programs|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HUD then determines how the funds are distributed to the various applicant communities using a couple formulas which measure the extent of the poverty, population, housing overcrowding, age of housing, and population growth lag compared to metropolitan areas.&lt;ref name="HUD on CDBG" /&gt;

No less than 70% of CDBG funds granted to a community must benefit low- and moderate-income people (up to 80% [[Median household income|AMI]], or Area Median Income).  The remaining amount may be used to prevent or eliminate slums or blight or for community needs caused by natural disaster.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;&lt;ref name="HUD on CDBG" /&gt;  Funds may be used for the acquisition, disposition, or retention of real property; the remodeling of existing residential and non-residential buildings; social services; and economic development.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;

Local governments are prohibited from utilizing CDBG funds for new residential development (except for “last resort housing”, or when comparable replacement housing for a CDBG project can only be accomplished by new construction).&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;&lt;ref name="HUD on CDBG" /&gt;  However, non-profit and other organizations that are part of a neighborhood revitalization, community economic development or energy conservation project are permitted to use the funds for housing.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;

In early 2011, President [[Barack Obama]] had proposed a budget for the 2012 fiscal year which included cutting the CDBG program by 7.5%, or $300 million.&lt;ref name=Lew&gt;{{cite news|last=Lew|first=Jacob|title=The Easy Cuts Are Behind Us|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/opinion/06lew.html|accessdate=20 November 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====HOME funds====
{{Main|HOME Investment Partnerships Program}}
The HOME Investment Partnerships Program, another community block grant program, was created by Congress in 1990 and authorized as Title II of the [[Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act]].&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;  Similar to CDBGs, a consolidated plan is required prior to distribution of HOME funds.&lt;ref name="HUD on HOME"&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|title=HOME Investment Partnerships Program|url=http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/affordablehousing/programs/home/index.cfm|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Unlike CDBGs, HOME funds are granted to states and local jurisdictions specifically for the provision of affordable owned and rental housing for low- and moderate-income households by.  States receive 40% of funds and cities and other local governments receive 60%.  Allocation of funds is based on a needs based formula (similar to the CDBG program).&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;  States are eligible for the higher amount of the formula allotment or $3 million; and local jurisdictions are eligible for at least $500,000.&lt;ref name="HUD on HOME" /&gt;  Of the money allocated to a state or local jurisdiction, at least 15% must be distributed to community-based non-profit organizations (Community Housing Development Organizations, or CHDOs).&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;

HOME funds may be used to assist people in buying a home, to develop owner-occupied and rental housing (including acquisition of land and demolition of existing real property to allow for a HOME-funded project; and payment relocation expenses),to rehabilitate existing homes, and to provide “tenant-based rental assistance” (or TBRA).  Development projects must be aimed towards households with no more than 80% AMI, and for rental projects, at least 90% of the benefiting families must have an income less than 60% AMI. For rental projects with five or more units being assisted, at least 20% of the households must have incomes less than 50% AMI.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;&lt;ref name="HUD on HOME" /&gt;

Other requirements for HOME funds include the match of funds from other sources, minimum affordability terms for projects, limits on TBRA, and a time limit on when the funds must be allocated and spent by.  For every dollar of HOME funds received, jurisdictions must provide a 25 cents match in non-federal sources.&lt;ref name="HUD on HOME" /&gt;  Newly constructed rental housing must remain affordable for at least 20 years.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt; For owner-occupied housing (newly constructed and remodeled), acquired rental housing, and remodeled rental housing, the minimum affordability term ranges from 5 to 15 years depending on the amount of funds received in relation to the number of assisted units.&lt;ref name="HUD on HOME" /&gt;  Unlike Section 8 vouchers, TBRA is limited to two years and may not be used for project-based rental assistance.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;  Finally, HOME funds must be committed (including reserving funds for CHDOs) within two years and be spent within five years.&lt;ref name="HUD on HOME" /&gt;

Oftentimes, HOME funds is not enough to bring rents down to the maximum allowed based on AMI; therefore additional funding must be acquired and used in conjunction with HOME funds, such as the LIHTC.  Both HOME and CDBG funds have been criticized for being unable to provide subsidies large enough to provide housing for households with incomes equal to or less than 30% AMI.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;

===Other public funding sources===

====Tax-exempt bonds====
{{Main|Private activity bond|Municipal bond|Government bond}}
The purpose of tax-exempt bonds, or [[private activity bonds]], is to promote job creation and increase economic development in local areas; therefore, they are not limited to housing creation. These bonds are issued by state Housing Finance Agencies (similar to [[#Low-Income Housing Tax Credit|LIHTCs]]) or by local government development agencies.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;&lt;ref name="US SBA"&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Small Business Administration|title=Tax-Exempt Bonds|url=http://www.sba.gov/content/tax-exempt-bonds|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the interest on the bonds is exempt from state and local taxes, lenders who purchase the bonds pass on this savings onto borrowers through lower interest rates. Tax-exempt bonds are similar to conventional loans in that the borrower must pay back the principle plus interest to the lender; however, tax-exempt bonds typically have longer financing periods compared to conventional loans. In general, this type of bonding is utilized for projects over one million dollars.&lt;ref name="US SBA" /&gt;

There are bonds which exist exclusively for use by non-profit organizations to provide residential rental housing. When used for such purposes, the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] code places use limitations on at least 95% of the bond proceeds. Among the uses permitted, one places minimum affordable occupancy levels.&lt;ref name=IRS&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Internal Revenue Service|title=Tax-Exempt Bonds for 501(c)(3) Charitable Organizations|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4077.pdf|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to LIHTCs, at least 40% of the units must be occupied by households with incomes 60% [[Median household income|AMI]] or less, or at least 20% of the units must be occupied households with no more than 50% AMI.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;

The federal government limits the amount of tax-exempt bonds a state can issue within a given year. Due to the [[late-2000s financial crisis]], state housing finance agencies became “virtually frozen… out of the Housing Bond market” causing many agencies to either suspend or significantly decrease the amount of bonds issued.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;

====Housing trust funds====
{{Main|Housing trust fund}}
Housing trust funds (HTFs) are established at all levels of government (national, state, county and local).&lt;ref name="Comm. Change"&gt;{{cite web|last=Center for Community Change|title=HTF: Housing Trust Funds|url=http://www.communitychange.org/page/htf-housing-trust-funds|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These funds are created specifically for the provision of affordable housing to low- and moderate-income households and are based on collected revenue sources. HTFs generally have far fewer restrictions than other forms of public financing and may be used for a wide range of development activities.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt; For example, eligible activities under the National Housing Trust Fund include but are not limited to: property acquisition, development/rehabilitation costs, construction costs, and some operating expenses.&lt;ref name="HUD on HTFs"&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|title=Housing Trust Fund|url=http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/affordablehousing/programs/home/htf.cfm|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most trust funds have a minimum requirement of affordability ranging from 5 to 30 years.  A majority of the HTFs target those at and below 80% AMI; however, approximately a quarter of HTFs target the homeless or those with incomes at 50% AMI or below.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;

Similar to [[#Section 8|Section 8]] funds, since trust funds are generally administered by governmental or quasi-governmental agencies, to utilize the funds, non-profit development projects much be completed in partnership with housing authorities, community development departments or corporations, redevelopment agencies, or a number of other possible governing agencies.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt; ''(For more information regarding governing agencies, see [[Housing trust fund#Administration or Governance|Housing trust fund – Administration or governance]]'')

===Private===
Private assistance in the form of grants and low-interest loans for affordable housing is usually funded by local community foundations and national non-profits.  Local community foundations focus primarily on improving specific neighborhoods, whereas national non-profits have broader objectives.  For-profit corporations also offer funding opportunities through related non-profit foundations or partnerships such as Living Cities, a housing fund created by the partnership of financial institutions, insurance companies and HUD.  Also, if a private company conducts a large share of their business in a particular area they may also contribute land, money and expertise to non-profit developers.&lt;ref name=Hecht /&gt;

==Operation==
In the final phase of development the non-profit sponsor establishes the long-term viability of the project.  This includes securing [[mortgage loan|permanent financing]] for the project and planning for future building operations and management.&lt;ref name="Hecht"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hecht|first=Bennet L.|title=Developing Affordable Housing: A Practical Guide for Nonprofit Organizations|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley and Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Non-profits will either manage the building themselves or contract a management company to oversee operations.  [[Property management]] requires marketing, tenant selection, rent collection, maintenance, finance, rule enforcement, [[strategic planning]], etc.&lt;ref name=Hecht /&gt;

A critical component of operating affordable housing is managing a project’s financing.&lt;ref name=Hecht /&gt;   Developers create an operating model to determine a property’s financial viability through projected future [[cash flow]]s.  An operating model computes annual [[cash flow]] or [[Earnings before interest and taxes|operating income]] by subtracting [[operating expense]]s (maintenance, water, sewer, electricity, insurance, etc.) from income generated by rents and other income such as laundry, vending and parking services.&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe, G. November 2011. Operating Models. ''Real Estate Development''. Lecture Conducted from the University of Washington, Seattle, WA.&lt;/ref&gt;  Positive operating income is necessary to cover the [[mortgage]] payments on the property and if income is not enough to cover debt than the bank can [[foreclosure|foreclose]] on the property.&lt;ref name=Hecht /&gt;   Lenders measure the ability of a project’s operating income to make mortgage payments by using a [[Debt service coverage ratio|debt-service-coverage ratio]], which is a calculation of annual operating income divided by annual mortgage payments; the higher the ratio the lower the risk of project foreclosure.&lt;ref name=Hecht /&gt;

Maintaining stable [[revenue]] throughout the lifetime is challenging for a non-profit.  Often, affordable housing exists in weak housing markets and in neighborhoods characterized by high crime rates, vacant and abandoned properties and low rent prices.  Housing in these markets is generally unattractive and thus difficult to rent, therefore buildings lose money due to high vacancy.  Projects in poor markets can also experience high costs associated with increased screening of renters and preparation of units due to high [[wikt:tenant|tenant]] turnover.&lt;ref name="Bratt NP Challenge"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratt|first=Rachel G.|title=Challenges for Non-Profit Housing Organizations Created by the Private Housing Market|journal=Journal of Urban Affairs|year=2009|volume=31|issue=1|pages=67–96|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9906.2008.00429.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, affordable projects frequently rely on government subsidies to cover the portion of rent that low-income [[Leasehold estate|tenants]] cannot afford (usually the difference between 30% of tenant income and market rents);  projects are exposed to risk of losing future cash flows if governments cut tenant assistance programs.&lt;ref name="Bratt CDCs"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratt|first=Rachel G.|author2=Rohe, WM.|title=Organizational Changes Among CDCs: Assessing the Impacts and Navigating the Challenges|journal=Journal of Urban Affairs|year=2004|volume=26|issue=2|pages=197–220|doi=10.1111/j.0735-2166.2004.00197.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Furthermore, inadequate property management can affect operating income through the ineffectiveness of collecting rents or managing costs.&lt;ref name="Bratt CDCs" /&gt;

Risks associated with loss of operating income are the physical deterioration of the building and inability to meet debt obligations.  Lack of revenue inhibits the property manager’s ability to make repairs or [[Physical capital|capital]] improvements to the building, causing the property to fall into disrepair.&lt;ref name="Bratt CDCs" /&gt;   To mitigate this risk, non-profit owners often establish a reserve account to cover capital expenditures in the event that a property does not generate enough income to cover maintenance costs.  Furthermore, in the event that debt service cannot be covered, the lender can foreclose on the property, taking the affordable units off of the market and hurting the mission of the non-profit.  Non-profits can reduce the risk of foreclosure by securing long-term debt with public entities because public entities share similar missions as the non-profit and will be more inclined to restructure the financing, rather than foreclosing.&lt;ref name="Bratt CDCs" /&gt;   Also, if the non-profit owns multiple buildings, diversifying the location of the buildings, type of tenants and source of project funding can diminish the risk of the entire organization failing if subsidies run dry or markets collapse.&lt;ref name="Bratt CDCs" /&gt;

==Social discrimination==

In the [[binary gender]] system, genderqueerness is unintelligible and abjected.&lt;ref name="ftmborderlands"&gt;Hale, J.C. (1998) "...[O]ur embodiments and our subjectivities are abjected from social ontology: we cannot fit ourselves into extant categories without denying, eliding, erasing, or otherwise abjecting personally significant aspects of ourselves ... When we choose to live with and in our dislocatedness, fractured from social ontology, we choose to forgo intelligibility: lost in language and in social life, we become virtually unintelligible, even to ourselves..." from ''Consuming the Living, Dis(Re)Membering the Dead in the Butch/FtM Borderlands'' in the ''Gay and Lesbian Quarterly'' 4:311, 336 (1998). Retrieved on 2007-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Individuals who identify as a gender that does not fit the traditional binary system tend to experience higher levels of social discrimination. A 2012 study from the [[National LGBTQ Task Force|''National LGBTQ Task Force'']] showed that genderqueer and other non-binary individuals were more likely to suffer physical assaults (32% vs. 25%), experience police harassment (25% vs. 19%), and suffer sexual assaulted (15% vs. 19%) compared to transgender individuals who identified within the gender binary (i.e., [[Trans man|trans men]] and [[Trans woman|trans women]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/e505652011-001|title=APA Policy Statement: Transgender, Gender Identity, &amp; Gender Expression Non-Discrimination|date=2008|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genderqueer individuals also reported higher rates of harassment in K-12 school (83% vs. 77%), and sexual assault in K-12 schools (16% vs. 11%). This study reported that genderqueer and other non-binary individuals were more likely to be [[people of color]] (30% vs. 23%) and younger (under 45) than binary transgender people (89% vs. 68%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Responders who identified as neither male nor female were less likely to be white and more likely to be multi racial, Black, or Asian, but less likely to be [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latin-American/Spanish in origin]] compared to those who identified as male or female. The study showed that despite genderqueer and other non-nonbinary individuals having received significantly higher education than those who identified within the gender binary, they were more likely to be living in extreme poverty (under $10,000 yearly) than those who identified within the gender binary (21% vs. 14%). They were more likely to be involved in underground economies for income (20% vs. 15%) than those who identified within the gender binary. Respondents disclosed brutal effects of discrimination, which had grave impacts, as 43% of genderqueer participants reported attempting suicide compared to 40% of transgender individuals that identified within the gender binary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Discrimination|Social discrimination]] in the context of discrimination against non-binary and gender non-conforming people includes hate-motivated violence and excusing of such. According to a 2016 study from ''[[Journal of Sex Research|The Journal of Sex Research]],'' one of the most common themes of discrimination for genderqueer people is [[binarism]]. Also the incorrect use of preferred gender pronouns, which the study labeled ‘nonaffirmation’ occurs when others do not affirm one’s sense of gender identity. Participants within this study also reported experiencing [[gender policing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nadal|first=Kevin L.|last2=Whitman|first2=Chassitty N.|last3=Davis|first3=Lindsey S.|last4=Erazo|first4=Tanya|last5=Davidoff|first5=Kristin C.|date=2016-03-11|title=Microaggressions Toward Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Genderqueer People: A Review of the Literature|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F00224499.2016.1142495|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|language=en|volume=53|issue=4-5|pages=488–508|doi=10.1080/00224499.2016.1142495|issn=0022-4499}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article from the book ''Violence and Gender'', states that this experienced violence and discrimination leads to high levels of stress. This article stated that non-binary participants are less likely to experience hate speech (24.4% vs. 50%) compared to trans men and equally as likely (24.4% vs. 24.4%) as trans women, yet genderqueer/nonbinary participants, along with trans women are more likely than trans men individuals to be concerned about the safety of themselves and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veldhuis|first=Cindy B.|last2=Drabble|first2=Laurie|last3=Riggle|first3=Ellen D.B.|last4=Wootton|first4=Angie R.|last5=Hughes|first5=Tonda L.|date=March 2018|title=“I Fear for My Safety, but Want to Show Bravery for Others”: Violence and Discrimination Concerns Among Transgender and Gender-Nonconforming Individuals After the 2016 Presidential Election|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vio.2017.0032|journal=Violence and Gender|volume=5|issue=1|pages=26–36|doi=10.1089/vio.2017.0032|issn=2326-7836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States of America, unemployment rates for transgender people are approximately twice as high as those for cisgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|title=Injustice At Every Turn: A Report Of The National Transgender Discrimination Survey|last=Grant, Jaime M., Mottet, Lisa A., &amp; Tanis, Justin|date=April 26, 2017|website=thetaskforce.org|archive-url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|archive-date=April 26, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the National Transgender Discrimination Survey&lt;ref name="ncte-ntds"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Transgender Discrimination Survey|url=http://www.transequality.org/issues/national-transgender-discrimination-survey|website=National Center for Transgender Equality|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by the LGBTQ+ Task Force, it was found that almost all non-binary persons had experienced discrimination in the workplace. Their findings show that being out as a non-binary person negatively affects that person's employment outcomes. Though non-binary persons have higher unemployment rates than those who identify with a specified gender, masculine non-binary persons who still appear male, or are not "passing as female" generally have a harder time in the work environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1331&amp;context=masters_theses_2|title=Gender Inequality: Nonbinary Transgender People in the Workplace|last=Davidson|first=Skylar|date=April 26, 2017|website=umass.edu|archive-url=http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1331&amp;context=masters_theses_2|archive-date=April 26, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 study by the Center for American Progress, 42% of gay employees said they have experienced discrimination of some form in the workplace; 50% of participants reported being harassed at work and 47% reported an adverse job outcome. That includes being fired or denied a promotion. In addition, 32% felt forced to act “traditionally gendered” to keep their jobs and 22% were denied access to bathrooms of choice based in gender identity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://electra.lmu.edu:2214/science/article/pii/S0001879117300684?#bb2015|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

19% of non-binary trans persons reported job loss due to anti-transgender bias, and 90% reported experiencing anti-transgender bias on the job. 78% of those who had transitioned during their time at the workplace were happy with their choice to do so, and reported feeling more comfortable at work, although they experienced more discrimination.&lt;ref name="transgenderlawcenter" /&gt;{{rp|11}} 

Not only does discrimination against transgender people in the workplace affect transgender employees, but it also affects the entire workplace team, distracting the victim and the perpetrator from the job itself. In 2001 study by the West Lothian Transgender Support Group, it was found that around 50 percent of transgender people do not survive beyond their thirtieth birthday, with most taking their own lives due to discrimination and others losing their lives from violence of cisgender individuals. The study’s statistic is also known as “the 50 percent rule” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/00483480610670625#|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With that being said, transgender individuals in the U.S. often face workplace discrimination like conflicts related to their bathroom usage, backlash over transitioning genders and being “misgendered” by coworkers. The Center of American Progress in 2012 also found that there is also a substantial amount of public ignorance towards transgender communities, in comparison to LGB community peers. Because of that, negative psychological consequences occur as a result like mental health disparities, higher rates in attempted suicide, and paranoid thinking in public spaces &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00918369.2011.534038|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Columbia University’s study in 2003 found that ideas of perceived discrimination are consistent with models of minority stress. It was also found that sexual minorities, such as the transgender community, are vulnerable to physical and mental health difficulties due to an exposure to chronic life stressors. The study finds that the transgender community in the U.S. possesses pre-conceived notions of rejection, hostility and discrimination from gender identities outside their groups &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0141429999&amp;origin=inward&amp;txGid=47bc7b389eee5f9c9f03fbd56fad13c9|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

&lt;br /&gt;
==Health discrimination==

===United States===
Transgender &amp; non-binary peoples generally seek greater care because of the stigma and the lack of knowledge about their experience on the behalf of rural physicians. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitehead|first=J.|last2=Shaver|first2=John|last3=Stephenson|first3=Rob|date=2016-01-05|title=Outness, Stigma, and Primary Health Care Utilization among Rural LGBT Populations|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4701471/|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=11|issue=1|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0146139|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4701471|pmid=26731405}}&lt;/ref&gt; With that being said, non-binary individuals, and members of the LGBTQ community are very tentative when sharing their sexual identities to health care providers in fear of receiving inadequate/unfair treatment. In the 2001 Journal of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association, the study explores factors associated with disclosure. 88 individuals (76% non-binary) gave responses to a questionnaire asking about their most recent interaction with health care, and how their overall experience was. Of this group, more respondents answered that they avoided answering questions about their sexuality (38%) than honestly disclosing it to their health care provider (37%). The respondents who avoided the questions were in agreement that if they gave out their sexual identity, they would be treated differently or poorly. The overall rates of disclosure to health care providers are low because of the perception that health care settings/providers are threatening and unjust. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eliason|first=Michele J.|last2=Schope|first2=Robert|date=2001|title=&lt;Emphasis Type="Bold"&gt;Original Research:&lt;/Emphasis&gt; Does “Don't Ask Don't Tell” Apply to Health Care?

In the 2015 International Journal of Transgenderism, a big portion of non-binary individuals reported to have experienced discrimination from different types of medical services, including: doctors, emergency rooms, and ambulances. From the study, it was discovered that 20.4% of non-binary individuals experienced discrimination when trying to access doctors and hospitals, 11.9% faced discrimination when attempting to access emergency rooms, and 4.6% when attempting to access the service of an ambulance. Based on these statistics, there is a needed change in how health services treat non-binary patients to minimize the discrimination on these individuals. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kattari|first=Shanna K.|last2=Walls|first2=N. Eugene|last3=Whitfield|first3=Darren L.|last4=Langenderfer-Magruder|first4=Lisa|date=2015-04-03|title=Racial and Ethnic Differences in Experiences of Discrimination in Accessing Health Services Among Transgender People in the United States|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15532739.2015.1064336|journal=International Journal of Transgenderism|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=68–79|doi=10.1080/15532739.2015.1064336|issn=1553-2739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, non-binary individuals also experience health discrimination. Under the law of the United Kingdom, individuals are considered by the state to be either male or female, the gender that is stated on their birth certificate. This means that non-binary gender is not recognized in UK law. In a 2015 survey conducted by the Scottish Trans Alliance, three main areas were focused on including, non-binary individuals' experiences of medical services. When asked if they had ever experienced problems getting the help that was needed because of their non-binary identity, 56% said that they had. Some examples of this discrimination included refusal of surgery, withholding of treatment, discharging from clinics for being "untreatable," and no treatment due to not having protocol for non-binary individuals. In addition, more than half of the respondents answered that they experienced a delay in their treatment after being honest and open about their non-binary gender identities. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scottishtrans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Non-binary-GIC-mini-report.pdf|title=Non-binary people’s experiences

===Australia===
Similarly to the UK, a 2013 survey was designed to examine the healthcare experiences of non binary individuals, and all other members of the LGBTQ community. The survey asked participants to rate their mental and physical health, and how their experiences with psychiatrists, general practitioners, and surgeons were. They rated their experience in terms of comfort, discrimination, and information provided. 10 people given the gender male at birth and 78 given female at birth, yet all identifying as gender diverse or non-binary individuals, completed two separate surveys. 70% of the participants accessed a psychiatrist, and on average rated their experience as just below positive. The individuals assigned female at birth rated their experience worse than those assigned male at birth. After this data was recorded, an analysis of the responses suggested that the positive experiences were due to professional, helpful, knowledgeable, and caring practitioners. Negative experiences were due to the amount of ridiculous or offensive questions asked, and for little to no knowledge on their sexual identity. Overall, these findings indicated that medical professionals are falling short of adequately meeting the needs of non binary individuals. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riggs|first=Damien W|last2=Coleman|first2=Katrina|last3=Due|first3=Clemence|date=2014-03-06|title=Healthcare experiences of gender diverse Australians: a mixed-methods, self-report survey|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3973980/|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=14|pages=230|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-230|issn=1471-2458|pmc=3973980|pmid=24597614}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 


==Legal discrimination==
{{distinguish|Legal recognition of non-binary gender}}

===United States===

Despite being more likely to achieve higher levels of education when compared to the general public,&lt;ref name="transgenderlawcenter"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Non-Binary Identities &amp; the Law {{!}} Transgender Law Center|url = http://transgenderlawcenter.org/archives/10208|website = transgenderlawcenter.org|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} 90% of non-binary individuals face discrimination, often in the form of harassment in the workplace. Nineteen percent of genderqueer individuals report job loss as a result of their identities.&lt;ref name="transgenderlawcenter"/&gt; Anti-discrimination laws that prohibit discrimination specifically against non-binary individuals do not exist.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} However, [[Title VII]] and the current proposed version of the federal [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]] use such terms as "gender identity" and "gender expression", categories under which non-binary individuals fall due to the fact that their gender expression cannot be defined as male or female.&lt;ref name="transgenderlawcenter" /&gt;

In 2004, Jimmie Smith was terminated from the fire department in Salem, Ohio after revealing their diagnosis with Gender Identity Disorder and intentions to undergo a male to female transition. The district court determined the reason for termination was because of their "transexuality" and not their gender non-conformity. The case was appealed to the Sixth Circuit, which overturned that decision and clarified to courts that under Title VII, sex discrimination was to be considered broader than only the traditional assumptions of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reineck|first=Katie|date=2017|title=RUNNING FROM THE GENDER POLICE: RECONCEPTUALIZING GENDER TO ENSURE PROTECTION FOR NON-BINARY PEOPLE.|url=|journal=Michigan Journal of Gender &amp; Law|volume=24|pages=265-322|via=OmniFile Full Text Mega (H.W.

Twelve states currently have legislation which bars discrimination based on gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = State Laws That Prohibit Discrimination Against Transgender People - National Center for Lesbian Rights|url = http://www.nclrights.org/legal-help-resources/resource/state-laws-that-prohibit-discrimination-against-transgender-people/|website = www.nclrights.org|accessdate = 2015-10-21|date = 2013-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these efforts, non-binary individuals are subject to higher rates of physical and sexual assault and police harassment than those who identify as men or women, likely due to their gender expression or presentation.&lt;ref name="Harrison2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jack Harrison|author2=Jaime Grant|author3=Jody L.

====Identity documents====

According to the Transgender Law Center, 70% of transgender people are not able to update their identity documents and one-third of have been harassed, assaulted or turned away when seeking basic services,&lt;ref name=osf-2017&gt;{{cite web |title=Gender Identity Recognition at the Border and Beyond |last1=Skeen |first1=Lisa |url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/gender-identity-recognition-border-and-beyond |date=April 5, 2017 |website=Open Society Foundations |publisher= |accessdate=October 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and one third are not able to update their documents post-transition.

In 2016, the U.S. State Department was sued for denying a passport to [[Dana Zzyym]], who is a veteran and an intersex and non-binary person. Zzyym wrote "intersex" on their passport form instead of male or female, which were the only two available gender fields on the form. Zzyym was denied the passport, which led to LGBTQ advocacy organizations filing a lawsuit against the U.S. State Department on Zzyym's behalf. The advocacy group [[Lambda Legal]] argued for gender-neutral terms and a third option on U.S. passports, arguing that the existing passport fields violated the [[Due Process Clause]] and [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the U.S. Constitution. The State Department argued that adding additional gender fields to the passport form would prevent the agency's efforts to combat identity theft and passport fraud. The Tenth Circuit Court ruled in favor of Zzyym, the first time in U.S. history that the federal government recognized non-binary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/intersex-dana-zzyym-passport-decision/|title=Judge rules in favor of intersex veteran who was denied passport|website=PBS NewsHour|date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

California, the District of Columbia, New York City, New York State, Iowa, Vermont, Oregon and Washington State have currently removed the surgical requirement to complete a change on a birth certificate. In these states, to change the gender on a birth certificate, one must fill out a standardized form but legal or medical approvals are not required. In Washington D.C., the applicant fills out the top half of the form and a health or social service professional must fill out the bottom half. A person may face obstacles obtaining a court order in order to make a change to documents in other states. Tennessee is the only state that has a specific statute that forbids altering the gender designation on a birth certificate due to gender surgery, while Idaho and Ohio have the same prohibition, but via court decision rather than by statute; and in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, a court ruled that gender markers could not be changed on identity documents under any circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/article/trans-identity-document-faq|title=FAQ About Identity Documents|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lambda-state&gt;{{cite web |title=Changing Birth Certificate Sex Designations: State-By-State Guidelines |author=&lt;!--staff writers, no byline--&gt; |url=https://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/article/trans-changing-birth-certificate-sex-designations |date=February 3, 2015 |website=Lambda Legal |publisher= |accessdate=October 26, 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, the Gender Recognition Act of 2017 was introduced in the State Senate in Sacramento in January 2017, and signed into law by governor [[Jerry Brown]] on October 19.  The law recognizes a third gender option known as "non-binary" which may be used on state-issued documents such as driver's licenses to more accurately reflect a person's gender. Senate bill SB179 was originally drafted by State Senators [[Toni Atkins]] and [[Scott Wiener]].  The law also makes it easier for existing documents to be changed, by removing requirements for sworn statements by physicians and replacing it with a sworn attestation by the person seeking to make the change to their documents.  The Executive Director of Equality California commented, "It is up to an individual—not a judge or even a doctor—to define a person's gender identity."&lt;ref name="Gutierrez-2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bill seeks 3rd gender option on licenses, birth certificates |last1=Gutierrez |first1=Melody |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Calif-lawmakers-seek-nonbinary-gender-10886782.php |date=January 26, 2017 |website=SFGate |publisher=[[Hearst Communications|Hearst]] |accessdate=October 26, 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowerman-2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=Female, male or non-binary: California legally recognizes a third gender on identification documents |last1=Bowerman |first1=Mary |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/10/19/female-male-non-binary-california-legally-recognizes-third-gender-identification-documents/779188001/ |date=January 26, 2017 |website=USA Today |publisher=[[Gannett]] |accessdate=October 26, 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two US citizens to receive a court decreed gender of non-binary were in Oregon and California. In [[Oregon]], [[Jamie Shupe]] was able to declare their sex as non-binary in June 2016 after a brief legal battle&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.portlandmercury.com/images/blogimages/2016/06/15/1466024211-shupe_ruling.pdf|title=Case No.: 16CV13991: In The Matter Of The Sex Change Of Jamie Shupe, Petitioner|last=Holmes Hehn|first=Amy|date=2016-06-10|work=Portland Mercury|access-date=2018-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160626085558/https://www.portlandmercury.com/images/blogimages/2016/06/15/1466024211-shupe_ruling.pdf|archive-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/16/jamie-shupe-first-non-binary-person-oregon|title=Jamie Shupe becomes first legally non-binary person in the US|first=Lauren|last=Dake|date=16 June 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following in Shupe's footsteps, [[California]] resident Sarah Kelly Keenan was also able to legally change their gender marker to non-binary in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/californian-becomes-second-us-citizen-granted-non-binary-gender-status-n654611|title=Californian becomes second US citizen granted 'non-binary' gender status|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After both Shupe and Keenan had success with their cases, more people have been inspired to take on the legal battle of changing their gender to a non-binary marker. With the help of organizations such as [https://www.intersexrecognition.org/ Intersex &amp; Genderqueer Recognition Project] dozens of these petitions have been granted and additional states have changed regulations to provide a third gender option on state ID, birth certificates, and/or court orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.intersexrecognition.org/resources|title=igrp {{!}} RESOURCES|website=igrp|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

Non-binary is not recognized as a legal gender in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nonbinary.org/wiki/Legal_gender#UK|title=Legal gender - Nonbinary.org|website=nonbinary.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gender Recognition Act 2004]] allowed people to apply to the [https://www.gov.uk/apply-gender-recognition-certificate Gender Recognition Panel] for a change of gender after living as the gender they wished to show on all their legal documents and being given a diagnosis of [[gender dysphoria]] by at least two health professionals. However, this change of gender only allowed for a change from male to female or vice versa.

In 2006 the [[Identity Cards Act 2006]] was introduced, which issued documents to UK residents and linked them back to the National Identity Register database. When the issue of transgender people and their assigned vs. actual gender came up, it was said that transgender people would be issued two cards, each with a separate male and female gender marker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmpublic/identity/100706/am/100706s01.htm|title=House of Commons Public Bill Committee : Identity Documents Bill|website=www.publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also said that eventually the hope for some was that the identity cards would get rid of the gender markers altogether. The [[Identity Documents Act 2010]] made all these cards invalid and called for their immediate destruction.

=== Canada ===
In 2002, the [[Northwest Territories]] was the first of [[Canada]]’s provinces to explicitly include gender identity as a protected group from discrimination under the law, followed by [[Manitoba]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cossman|first=Brenda|date=January 2018|title=Gender identity, gender pronouns, and freedom of expression: Bill C-16 and the traction of specious legal claims|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3138/utlj.2017-0073|journal=University of Toronto Law Journal|volume=68|issue=1|pages=37–79|doi=10.3138/utlj.2017-0073|issn=0042-0220}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, every Canadian province and territory had included similar changes to their discrimination laws.

In 2017, Canada passed [[An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code|Bill C-16]] which formally recognized non-binary gender people and granted them protection under the law towards discrimination on the grounds of “gender identity” and “gender expression.”

===Australia===
The Sex Discrimination Act of 1984 did not explicitly protect non-binary persons from discrimination until the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Act of 2013, which prohibited any discrimination on the grounds of “gender identity” and “intersex status.” This amendment also removed the use of “other” and “opposite sex” in exchange for broader terms like “different sex.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennet|first=Theodore|date=2014|title='NO MAN'S LAND': NON-BINARY SEX IDENTIFICATION IN AUSTRALIAN LAW AND POLICY.|url=|journal=University of New South Wales Law Journal|volume=37|pages=847-873|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[Australian High Court]] legally recognized non-binary as a category for people to identify with on legal documents. After a citizen named Norrie made a request for a third gender identity on legal documents and was eventually denied, Norrie chose to take the matter up with Australia's [[Human Rights Commission]] and their [[Court of Appeal]]. After a four-year long legal battle beginning in 2010, Norrie finally won the case. From this and the legalizing of the matter in [[New South Wales]], the [[Australian Capital Territory]] made the decision to pass a law which recognized non-binary identities. Though this is a step in a positive direction for non-binary identifying Australians, the law currently lacks concise policies on marriage licenses and recognition of partnership for non-binary people. Because of this, Australians registered as non-binary may not be able to legally marry.

In addition to marriage issues, the non-binary marker for Australian citizens requires proof of [[gender confirmation surgery]]. Because non-binary people live outside of the [[gender binary]], they may not wish to obtain gender confirmation surgery. The people not wishing to do so ultimately will not be able to register as non-binary until this portion of the law is amended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xojane.com/issues/recognition-of-nonbinary-gender-in-australian-high-court|title=Australian High Court Legally Recognizes Nonbinary Gender Identities -- But The News Isn't All Good|date=April 8, 2014|author= S.E. Smith|work=xoJane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With much of existing Australian legislature being crafted around a binary interpretation of sex, this “third-sex” approach has lead to complications with how laws interact with this new classification. In response, steps towards the de-emphasis of sex within legislation are being taken by removing sexual identification from legal areas that do not have a necessity for it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Behn Love-Letters 1684.jpg|thumb|200px|Titlepage of [[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister|Love-Letters]]'' (1684)]]

An '''epistolary novel''' &lt;!---or the original [[German language|German]] '''Briefroman'''---&gt; is a [[novel]] written as a series of documents. The usual form is [[Letter (message)|letter]]s, although [[diary|diary entries]], [[newspaper]] clippings and other documents are sometimes used. Recently, electronic "documents" such as recordings and radio, [[blogs]], and [[e-mails]] have also come into use. The word ''[[wikt:epistolary|epistolary]]'' is derived from [[Latin]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ἐπιστολή ''epistolē'', meaning a letter (see [[epistle]]).

The epistolary form can add greater [[realism (arts)|realism]] to a story, because it mimics the workings of real life. It is thus able to demonstrate differing points of view without recourse to the device of an [[omniscient narrator]].

==Early works==
There are two theories on the genesis of the epistolary novel. The first claims that the genre originated from novels with inserted letters, in which the portion containing the third person narrative in between the letters was gradually reduced.&lt;ref&gt;E.Th. Voss. ''Erzählprobleme des Briefromans, dargestellt an vier Beispielen des 18. Jahrhunderts.'' Bonn, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; The other theory claims that the epistolary novel arose from [[Miscellany|miscellanies]] of letters and poetry: some of the letters were tied together into a (mostly amorous) plot.&lt;ref&gt;B.A. Bray. ''L'art de la lettre amoureuse: des manuels aux romans (1550-1700).'' La Haye/Paris, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Both claims have some validity. The first truly epistolary novel, the Spanish "Prison of Love" (''Cárcel de amor'') (c.1485) by [[Diego de San Pedro]], belongs to a tradition of novels in which a large number of inserted letters already dominated the narrative. Other well-known examples of early epistolary novels are closely related to the tradition of letter-books and miscellanies of letters. Within the successive editions of [[Edmé Boursault]]'s ''Letters of Respect, Gratitude and Love'' (''Lettres de respect, d'obligation et d'amour'') (1669), a group of letters written to a girl named Babet were expanded and became more and more distinct from the other letters, until it formed a small epistolary novel entitled ''Letters to Babet'' (''Lettres à Babet''). The immensely famous ''[[Letters of a Portuguese Nun]]'' (''Lettres portugaises'') (1669) generally attributed to [[Gabriel-Joseph de La Vergne, comte de Guilleragues]], though a small minority still regard [[Marianna Alcoforado]] as the author, is claimed to be intended to be part of a miscellany of Guilleragues prose and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;G. de [[Guilleragues]]. ''Lettres portugaises, Valentins et autres oeuvres.'' Paris, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;
The founder of the epistolary novel in English is said by many to be [[James Howell]] (1594–1666) with [[Epistolae Ho-Elianae | "Familiar Letters"]] (1645–50), who writes of prison, foreign adventure, and the love of women.

The first novel to expose the complex play that the genre allows was [[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister]]'', which appeared in three volumes in 1684, 1685, and 1687. The novel shows the genre's results of changing perspectives: individual points were presented by the individual characters, and the central voice of the author and moral evaluation disappeared (at least in the first volume; her further volumes introduced a narrator). Behn furthermore explored a realm of intrigue with letters that fall into the wrong hands, faked letters, letters withheld by protagonists, and even more complex interaction.

The epistolary novel as a genre became popular in the 18th century in the works of such authors as [[Samuel Richardson]], with his immensely successful novels ''[[Pamela (novel)|Pamela]]'' (1740) and ''[[Clarissa]]'' (1749). In France, there was ''[[Lettres persanes]]'' (1721) by [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], followed by ''[[Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse]]'' (1761) by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos|Laclos]]' ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'' (1782), which used the epistolary form to great dramatic effect, because the sequence of events was not always related directly or explicitly. In Germany, there was [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther|Die Leiden des jungen Werthers]]'' (1774) (''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'') and [[Friedrich Hölderlin]]'s ''[[Hyperion (Hölderlin)|Hyperion]]''. The first North American novel, ''The History of Emily Montague'' (1769) by [[Frances Brooke]] was written in epistolary form.

Starting in the 18th century, the epistolary form was subject to much ridicule, resulting in a number of savage [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]]s. The most notable example of these was [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[Shamela]]'' (1741), written as a parody of ''Pamela''. In it, the female narrator can be found wielding a pen and scribbling her diary entries under the most dramatic and unlikely of circumstances. [[Oliver Goldsmith]] used the form to satirical effect in ''[[The Citizen of the World]]'', subtitled "Letters from a Chinese Philosopher Residing in London to his Friends in the East" (1760–61). So did the diarist [[Frances Burney|Fanny Burney]] in a successful comic first novel, ''[[Evelina]]'' (1788).

The epistolary novel slowly fell out of use in the late 18th century. Although [[Jane Austen]] tried her hand at the epistolary in juvenile writings and her [[novella]] ''[[Lady Susan]]'' (1794), she abandoned this structure for her later work. It is thought that her lost novel ''First Impressions'', which was redrafted to become ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', may have been epistolary: ''Pride and Prejudice'' contains an unusual number of letters quoted in full and some play a critical role in the plot.

The epistolary form nonetheless saw continued use, surviving in exceptions or in fragments in nineteenth-century novels. In [[Honoré de Balzac]]'s novel ''[[Mémoires de deux jeunes mariées|Letters of Two Brides]]'', two women who became friends during their education at a convent correspond over a 17-year period, exchanging letters describing their lives. [[Mary Shelley]] employs the epistolary form in her novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818). Shelley uses the letters as one of a variety of framing devices, as the story is presented through the letters of a sea captain and scientific explorer attempting to reach the north pole who encounters Victor Frankenstein and records the dying man's narrative and confessions. Published in 1848, [[Anne Brontë]]'s novel ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' is framed as a retrospective letter from one of the main heroes to his friend and brother-in-law with the diary of the eponymous tenant inside it. In the late 19th century, [[Bram Stoker]] released one of the most widely recognized and successful novels in the epistolary form to date, ''[[Dracula]]''. Printed in 1897, the novel is compiled entirely of letters, diary entries, newspaper clippings, telegrams, doctor's notes, ship's logs, and the like.

==Types==
There are three types of epistolary novels: monologic (giving the letters of only one character, like ''Letters of a Portuguese Nun'' and ''The Sorrows of Young Werther''), dialogic (giving the letters of two characters, like Mme [[Marie Jeanne Riccoboni]]'s ''Letters of Fanni Butlerd'' (1757), and polylogic (with three or more letter-writing characters, such as in Bram Stoker's ''[[Dracula]]''). In addition, a crucial element in polylogic epistolary novels like ''Clarissa'', and ''Dangerous Liaisons'' is the dramatic device of 'discrepant awareness': the simultaneous but separate correspondences of the heroines and the villains creating dramatic tension.

An important strategic device in the epistolary novel for creating the impression of authenticity of the letters is the [[fictional editor]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Takeda. ''Die Erfindung des Anderen: Zur Genese des fiktionalen Herausgebers im Briefroman des 18. Jahrhunderts''. Würzburg, 2008; U. Wirth. ''Die Geburt des Autors aus dem Geist der Herausgeberfiktion. Editoriale Rahmung im Roman um 1800''. Munich, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later works==
{{see also|List of contemporary epistolary novels}}
Epistolary novels have made several memorable appearances in more recent literature:

*[[John Cleland]]'s early erotic novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' (1748) is written as a series of letters from the titular character to an unnamed recipient.
*''[[The Coquette|The Coquette; or, The History of Eliza Wharton]]'' (1797) by [[Hannah Webster Foster]] is a series of letters between several characters.
*[[Sophia Briscoe]] used the form in both her novels: ''Miss Melmoth...'' (1771) and ''The Fine Lady...'' (1772).
*[[Marianne Ehrmann]] wrote the epistolary novel ''Amalie and Minna'' around 1787. 
*[[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] used the epistolary format for his first novel, ''[[Poor Folk]]'' (1846), as a series of letters between two friends, struggling to cope with their impoverished circumstances and life in pre-revolution Russia.
*''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868) by [[Wilkie Collins]] uses a collection of various documents to construct a detective novel in English. In the second piece, a character explains that he is writing his portion because another had observed to him that the events surrounding the disappearance of the eponymous diamond might reflect poorly on the family, if misunderstood, and therefore he was collecting the true story. This is an unusual element, as most epistolary novels present the documents without questions about how they were gathered. He also used the form previously in ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'' (1859).
*Spanish foreign minister [[Juan Valera y Alcalá-Galiano|Juan Valera's]] ''Pepita Jimenez'' (1874) is written in three sections, the first and third being a series of letters, the middle part narrated by an unknown observer.
*[[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897) uses not only letters and diaries, but also dictation [[Phonograph cylinder|cylinders]] and [[newspaper]] accounts.
*[[Jean Webster]]'s ''[[Daddy-Long-Legs (novel)|Daddy-Long-Legs]]'' (1912).
*[[Dorothy L. Sayers]] and [[Robert Eustace]]'s ''[[The Documents in the Case]]'' (1930).
*[[Haki Stërmilli]]'s novel ''[[If I Were a Boy (novel)|If I Were a Boy]]'' (1936) is written in the form of diary entries documenting the life of the protagonist.
*[[Kathrine Taylor]]'s ''[[Kathrine Taylor#Address Unknown .281938.29|Address Unknown]]'' (1938) is an anti-Nazi novel in which the final letter is returned marked "Address Unknown", indicating the disappearance of the German character.
*[[Virginia Woolf]] used the epistolary form for her feminist essay ''[[Three Guineas]]'' (1938).
*[[C. S. Lewis]] used the epistolary form for ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]'' (1942), and considered writing a companion novel from an [[angel]]'s point of view—though he never did so. It is less generally realized that his ''[[Letters to Malcolm: Chiefly on Prayer]]'' (1964) is a similar exercise, exploring theological questions through correspondence addressed to a fictional recipient, "Malcolm", though this work may be considered a "novel" only loosely in that developments in Malcolm's personal life gradually come to light and impact the discussion.
*[[Thornton Wilder]]'s fifth novel ''[[Ides of March (novel)|Ides of March]]'' (1948) consists of letters and documents illuminating the last days of the Roman Republic.
*[[Mark Harris (author)|Mark Harris]]'s comic novel ''Wake Up, Supid'' (1959) is made up of letters, telegrams, newspaper clippings and pamphlets, all sent either to or from the protagonist.
*[[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s short novel ''[[Some of Your Blood]]'' (1961) consists of letters and case-notes relating to the psychiatric treatment of a non-supernatural vampire.
*[[Saul Bellow]]'s novel ''[[Herzog (novel)|Herzog]]'' (1964) is largely written in letter format. These are both real and imagined letters, written by the protagonist Moses Herzog to family members, friends, and celebrities.
*''Up the Down Staircase'' is a novel written by Bel Kaufman, published in 1965, which spent 64 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list. In 1967 it was released as a movie starring Patrick Bedford, Sandy Dennis and Eileen Heckart.
*[[Shūsaku Endō]]'s novel ''[[Silence (novel)|Silence]]'' (1966) is an example of the epistolary form, half of which consists of letters from Rodrigues, the other half either in the third person or in letters from other persons. 
*''[[The Anderson Tapes (novel)|The Anderson Tapes]]'' (1969, 1970) by Lawrence Sanders is a novel primarily consisting of transcripts of tape recordings.
*''[[84, Charing Cross Road]]'' (1970) is not a novel but a true account by [[Helene Hanff]] written in epistolary form as an exchange of letters between the writer in New York City and a bookseller in London over the course of two decades.
*[[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'' (1974) is written in an epistolary structure through newspaper clippings, magazine articles, letters, and book excerpts.
*In [[John Barth]]'s epistolary work ''[[LETTERS (novel)|Letters]]'' (1979), the author interacts with characters from his other novels.
*[[Alice Walker]] employed the epistolary form in ''[[The Color Purple]]'' (1982). The 1985 film adaptation echoes the form by incorporating into the script some of the novel's letters, which the actors deliver as monologues.
*''[[The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13¾]]'' (1982) by [[Sue Townsend]] is a comic novel in the form of a diary set in 1980s Britain.
*''[[The Good War]]: An Oral History of World War II'' (1984) by [[Studs Terkel]] is not a novel but a compilation of interviews with people who lived the events from the beginning of America's involvement in [[World War II]], Pearl Harbor, to the end.
*[[Michael Dibdin]]'s ''A Rich Full Death'' (1986) is an epistolary crime novel set in 19th-century Florence.
*[[John Updike]]'s ''S.'' (1988) is an epistolary novel consisting of the heroine's letters and transcribed audio recordings.
*[[Patricia Wrede]] and [[Caroline Stevermer]]'s ''[[Patricia Wrede#Cecelia and Kate|Sorcery and Cecelia]]'' (1988) is an epistolary fantasy novel in a Regency setting from the first-person perspectives of cousins Kate and Cecelia, who recount their adventures in magic and polite society. Unusually for modern fiction, it's written using the style of the [[letter game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Patricia C. Wrede |url=http://enchantedinkpot.livejournal.com/18779.html |website=The Enchanted Inkpot |accessdate=27 February 2016 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Several of [[Gene Wolfe]]'s novels are written in the forms of diaries, letters, or memoirs.
*''[[La silla del águila]] (The Eagle's Throne)'' by [[Carlos Fuentes]] (2003) is a political satire written as a series of letters between persons in high levels of the Mexican government in 2020. The epistolary format is treated by the author as a consequence of necessity: the United States impedes all telecommunications in Mexico as a retaliatory measure, leaving letters and smoke signals as the only possible methods of communication, particularly ironic given one character's observation that "Mexican politicians put nothing in writing."
*''[[We Need to Talk About Kevin]]'' (2003) is a monologic epistolary novel written as a series of letters from Eva, Kevin's mother, to her husband Franklin.
*The 2004 novel ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]'' by [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell]] tells a story in several time periods in a nested format, with some sections told in epistolary style, including an interview, journal entries and a series of letters.

*''[[The White Tiger]]'' (2008) by [[Aravind Adiga]], winner of the 40th [[Man Booker Prize]] in 2008, is a novel in the form of letters written by an Indian villager to the Chinese Premier [[Wen Jiabao]].

==Other media==
*"[[Dear Dad]]", episode twelve of the first season of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', used the framing device of a letter written by [[Hawkeye Pierce]] to his father to describe the events of the episode.
*"[[The Stackhouse Filibuster]]", episode seventeen of the second season of ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'', used the framing device of emails sent by [[C.J. Cregg]], [[Josh Lyman]] and [[Sam Seaborn]] to their respective parents to describe the events of the episode. Aaron Sorkin also used this device on his earlier show ''[[Sports Night]]''.
*Epistolary songs include [[The Beatles]]' "P.S. I Love You", [[Eminem]]'s "[[Stan (song)|Stan]]", [[Leonard Cohen]]'s "[[Famous Blue Raincoat]]", [[Tom Waits]]'s "[[Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis]]" and [[Bloodhound Gang]]'s "The Ballad of Chasey Lain".
*[[Thomas Bailey Aldrich]]'s ''[[Marjorie Daw (short story)|Marjorie Daw]]'' and [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s ''[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]'' are two examples of epistolary [[short stories]].
*The works of [[Christine Love (visual novelist)|Christine Love]] all share an epistolary style; from the forum documents and e-mails of "[[Digital: A Love Story]]", the e-mails and chat logs of students in "[[Don't take it personally, babe, it just ain't your story]]". "[[Analogue: A Hate Story]]" and "[[Hate Plus]]" are tales told in the form of diary entries and letters between residents of the colonial spaceship, the Mugunghwa.
*''[[Dear Esther]]'' is a 2012 video game by [[thechineseroom]] that allows the player to traverse an uninhabited Hebridean island; as the player does this, letters and diary excerpts are recalled audibly by the narrator to reveal the story and encourage progression towards certain areas. These narrations are randomly chosen, and so a different story (or more details of the same story) are revealed during multiple playthroughs of the game.
*The [[Frictional Games]] video games ''[[Penumbra: Overture]]'' (2007) and its sequel ''[[Penumbra: Black Plague]]'' (2008) are framed in the form of an e-mail written by the protagonist Philip to an outside contact and the story culminates at the point of writing. The developer's later 2010 title ''[[Amnesia: The Dark Descent]]'' would also frequently refer to letters as a means of exposition, as well as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, but this time read through by the original writer Daniel after chemically inducing memory loss.
*The entire ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise can be described as epistolary to a degree, as its characters are frequently heard making entries in their personal or official logs, whichever is applicable.
*The text portions the multimedia webcomic [[Homestuck]] are largely composed of online chats between characters, interspersed with commentary by several omniscient in-universe narrators who interact with the plot.

'''Feminism in the Netherlands''' began as part of the [[first-wave feminism]] movement during the 19th century. Later, the struggles of [[second-wave feminism]] in the [[Netherlands]] mirrored developments in the women's rights movement in other Western countries. Women in the Netherlands still have an open discussion about how to improve remaining imbalances and injustices they face as women.

==History==

===Renaissance and Enlightenment===
The Republic of the Seven United Provinces, known as the [[Netherlands]], was created through the Dutch War of Independence, which began in 1568 and ended with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]]. Women had a limited number of rights, including the right to enter contracts and the right to control their own [[dowry|dowries]]. Though they were still legally subordinate to men, widows such as [[Volcxken Diericx]], an Antwerp publisher, and [[Aletta Hannemans]], a Haarlem brewer, were allowed to continue their husband's business. Girls had no right to an education, and before widowhood, women were not allowed to own property or to participate in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=State|first=Paul F.|title=A Brief History of the Netherlands|year=2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438108322|pages=153–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early to Mid-19th century===
Industrialization in the Netherlands brought jobs to both men and women. Labour unions began organizing by the mid-19th century. In 1841, [[Barbera van Meerten-Schilperoort]] founded ''Hulpbetoon aan Eerlijke en Vlijtige Armoede,'' the first women's organization in the Netherlands. Middle class women began to find paid employment, first in nursing. The first department store in the Netherlands opened in 1860, and women began finding jobs as retail clerks. Kindergartens, which had been pioneered in Germany, spread quickly in the Netherlands and needed a workforce of trained young women to staff them. To train young women to teach primary school, middle schools for girls were established in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=State|first=Paul F.|title=A Brief History of the Netherlands|year=2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438108322|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Young women with academic promise could petition for the right to be admitted to an all-male secondary school. Universities were closed to women until 1871, when [[Aletta Jacobs]] gained admittance to study medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=State|first=Paul F.|title=A Brief History of the Netherlands|year=2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438108322|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated as Europe's first modern woman physician. Jacobs also became prominent in the [[women's suffrage]] movement in the Netherlands. She opened the first women's birth control clinic in Amsterdam in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Robin|title=Sisterhood is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology|year=1996|publisher=Feminist Press at CUNY|isbn=9781558611603|page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First-wave feminists===
In the 1883 Dutch parliamentary elections, Aletta Jacobs petitioned for the right to vote, pointing out that she met all the legal criteria, but she was rejected from voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004224254|page=176|editor1=Blanca Rodriguez Ruiz |editor2=Ruth Rubio-Marín }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This event triggered the women's suffrage movement in the Netherlands. The immediate result was an amendment to the voting rights of the Constitution in 1887, to specify "male" inhabitants of the Netherlands had the vote, adding another barrier to the women's suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004224254|page=177|editor1=Blanca Rodriguez Ruiz |editor2=Ruth Rubio-Marín }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, the ''Vrije Vrouwenvereeniging'' (Free Women's Movement, or VVV) was founded. This was soon followed in 1894 by the creation of a sub-group within the organization, the ''Vereeniging vor Vrouwenkiesrecht'' (Organization of Women's Suffrage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004224254|page=177|editor1=Blanca Rodriguez Ruiz |editor2=Ruth Rubio-Marín }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelmina Drucker]] was less concerned about women winning emancipation—which she saw as easily attainable—than women winning equal opportunity in the workplace, a struggle she saw as facing much more resistance from men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Protecting Women: Labor Legislation in Europe, the United States, and Australia ; 1880 - 1920|year=1995|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252064647|page=45|editor=Ulla Wikander |editor2=Alice. Kessler-Harris |editor3=Jane E. Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, where other feminists in the country pressed for labour laws addressing the specific needs of women workers, Drucker was opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Protecting Women: Labor Legislation in Europe, the United States, and Australia ; 1880 - 1920|year=1995|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252064647|page=200|editor=Ulla Wikander |editor2=Alice. Kessler-Harris |editor3=Jane E. Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Drucker's view, "The state should not interfere with men or with women, nor invent a fictive competition between men and women. It should solely recognize people; members of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004224254|page=179|editor1=Blanca Rodriguez Ruiz |editor2=Ruth Rubio-Marín }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drucker was firmly on the radical edge of feminism in the Netherlands, but she gave speaking tours and published a popular feminist journal, ''Evolutie'' (Evolution). In 1899, she spearheaded a campaign to stop legislation that would ban women under 40 from jobs as teachers or civil servants; after a decade-long campaign, the bill was "crushed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Robin|title=Sisterhood is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology|year=1996|publisher=Feminist Press at CUNY|isbn=9781558611603|page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aletta Jacobs co-founded the [[International Women's Suffrage Alliance]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Robin|title=Sisterhood is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology|year=1996|publisher=Feminist Press at CUNY|isbn=9781558611603|page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women won the right to stand for an election as a candidate in 1917. They gained full suffrage in 1919. This was relatively early compared to most other European nations; only Finland and Sweden had given women the vote earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004224254|page=176|editor1=Blanca Rodriguez Ruiz |editor2=Ruth Rubio-Marín }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women had in part gained the vote to a political compromise "package deal" between socialists, liberals, and "confessionalist" parties. The confessionalists supported state funding for private schools, typically belonging to a religious denomination. This compromise system in Dutch politics was known as [[Pillarisation]]. In the years after women's emancipation, the confessionalists came to dominate moral discourse in the Netherlands, and legislation in support of confessionalist moral views was enacted (prostitution banned, 1912; abortion prohibited, 1911; advertising for contraception criminalized).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004224254|page=184|editor1=Blanca Rodriguez Ruiz |editor2=Ruth Rubio-Marín }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A healthy economy and a rising standard of living characterizes life in the Netherlands during the 1920s. Women, however, faced a backlash against women's rights which reached into the workplace. Women's rights groups multiplied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195148909|page=332|editor=Bonnie G. Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international feminist organizations gained larger memberships as women worldwide continued to struggle for emancipation. Dutch women were active in such international organizations as:
* [[League of Nations]];
* [[International Labour Organization]];
* [[International Council of Women]];
* IWSA/IAW, the International Women's Suffrage Alliance, after 1926 called the [[International Alliance of Women]].

Women were praised for their resilience throughout the [[Hunger Winter]] of 1944-5 when food and fuel were blocked by the Nazi military. A period of conservatism followed for several years, but two notable legal milestones were achieved during the 1950s: in 1955, the law changed so that women could no longer be forced from civil service jobs after marrying, and in 1956, married women became legally competent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195148909|page=332|editor=Bonnie G.

===Second-wave feminism===
[[File:Vrouwenactiegroep Dolle Mina Women's rights group 'Dolle Mina'.jpg|thumb|left|A costume demonstration by the feminist group [[Dolle Mina]] (Mad Mina), 1970.]]

A 1967 essay by [[Joke Smit|Joke Kool-Smits]], "The Discontent of Women", was published in ''De Gids'' and is credited with launching second-wave feminism in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emancipatie.nl/_documenten/js/werk/hetonbehagenbijdevrouw/hetonbehagenbijdevrouw.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://isgeschiedenis.nl/nieuws/joke-smit-feministe-en-journaliste|title=Joke Smit: feministe en journaliste|date=6 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Doing Gender in Media, Art and Culture|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203876800|page=17|editor1=Rosemarie Buikema |editor2=Iris van der Tuin }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, a group of feminist men and women banded together to create the activist group ''Man-Vrouw-Maatschappij'' (Man-Woman society, or MVM). Its dual-gender composition made it rare among Western Second-wave feminist organizations, but it was similar to others in that its membership was predominantly middle or upper class and well-educated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Gisela|title=Contemporary Western European Feminism (RLE Feminist Theory)|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415636810|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissatisfied with the lobbying efforts of the MVM, a more radical group was inspired. The all-female [[Dolle Mina]] society was founded in 1969, naming itself "Mad Mina" after pioneering Dutch feminist Wilhelmina Drucker. Dolle Mina had success as a consciousness-raising force during the 1970s, mainly through its use of imaginative protests, such as an outdoor "Discrimination Fair" to draw attention to the issue of equal pay for equal work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Der Vleuten|first=Anna|title=The Price of Gender Equality (Epub) Member States and Governance in the European Union|year=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=9781409498063|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1976 publication of [[Anja Meulenbelt]]'s novel ''De Schaamte Voorbij'' (''The Shame is Over'') was another important piece of second-wave feminist writing in the Netherlands. The novel was confessional in tone, and made the connection between the body and language politics overt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Discovering the Dutch: on Culture and Society of the Netherlands|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789089641007|pages=195–6|editor1=Emmeline N. Besamusca |editor2=J. Verheul }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s, the fight for access to abortion, rape crisis centres, and women's shelters became a dominant focus of the feminist movement. In 1980, the government was financially supporting 30 rape crisis centres in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Gisela|title=Contemporary Western European Feminism (RLE Feminist Theory)|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415636810|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, feminist periodicals multiplied, such as ''Dolle Mina'', ''Vrouwen'', ''Opzij'', ''Serpentine'', ''Vrouwenkrant'', and ''Lover'', and there were several feminist publishing houses in Amsterdam, the best known being De Bonte Was (1972) and Sara (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Gisela|title=Contemporary Western European Feminism (RLE Feminist Theory)|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415636810|pages=154–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, an estimated 160 feminist groups were active in the Netherlands, covering 25% of Dutch towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henig|first=Simon|title=Women and Political Power: Europe since 1945|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203134269|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s saw many victories for the feminist movement, including the disintegration of the male breadwinner logic as the Netherlands began to prioritize re-gearing the welfare state in favor of incorporating women into the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evertsson|first1=M.|last2=England|first2=P.|last3=Mooi-Reci|first3=I.|last4=Hermsen|first4=J.|last5=de Bruijn|first5=J.|last6=Cotter|first6=D.|title=Is Gender Inequality Greater at Lower or Higher Educational Levels?

==Third-wave feminism==
Despite having won many legal and social battles over the course of the 20th century, Dutch feminists are not ready to claim victory. Feminist activity continues in the Netherlands, and gender equality continues to be a topic of discussion in organizations, and in the media. Areas of concern remain the low participation of women in full-time employment and their low presence in top executive positions,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.government.nl/topics/gender-equality/contents/womens-labour-force-participation&lt;/ref&gt; violence against women,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.government.nl/topics/gender-equality/contents/safety-of-girls-and-women&lt;/ref&gt; and discrimination against ethnic minority women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/co/CEDAW-C-NLD-CO-5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s onwards, the Netherlands has started promoting policies based on gender equality;
and has once been described as having "the most extensive and comprehensive [sex equality apparatus] in Europe"; this is largely due to the appointment of a State Secretary to oversee an Emancipation Council launched in 1977, and its implementation of policies at the local level with help from feminist activists recruited into government positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henig|first=Simon|title=Women and Political Power: Europe since 1945|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203134269|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women of colour have seen the need to create new organizations to advance gaps in meeting their needs: a Moroccan women's group was formed in 1992, and a Surinamese women's group was formed in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195148909|page=332|editor=Bonnie G. Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the Netherlands having an image as progressive on gender issues, women in the Netherlands work less in paid employment than women in other comparable Western countries. In the early 1980s, the Commission of the [[European Communities]] report ''Women in the European Community'' fount that "it is  in  the  Netherlands (17.6%)  and  in  Ireland  (13.6%)  that  we  see  the  smallest  numbers  of  married  women  working  and  the  least  acceptance  of  this  phenomenon  by  the  general  public". (pg 14).&lt;ref&gt;http://aei.pitt.edu/4560/1/4560.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
In the following years the numbers of women entering the workplace have increased, but with most of the women [[part time job|working part time]].

{{blockquote| Nearly 60% of Dutch working women aged 25-54 worked part-time in 2001, compared to 15% in the United States, 25% in France and 35% in Germany; but where 25% of French women working part-time say they want to work full-time, just 4% of Dutch women do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=M.S.|title=Why Dutch women don't work longer hours|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/11/dutch_feminism|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=May 14, 2013|date=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Despite the government identifying this as a social problem in the 1990s, and introducing tax incentives to encourage women to find more paid employment, the opposite happened, and women found a way to use the tax incentives to reduce their working hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=M.S.|title=Why Dutch women don't work longer hours|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/11/dutch_feminism|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=May 14, 2013|date=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of balancing work and home life, parental leave is much more generous in Sweden, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gustafsson|first=Siv|title=Why Is the Netherlands the Best Country?: On Country Comparisons Regarding the Economics of the Family|year=2008|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789056295110|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently a great deal of debate in the Netherlands over whether women simply prefer to care for their children themselves and work reduced hours, or if higher costs are holding women back from seeking further employment. Economist, lawyer and journalist Helen Mees wrote a book exploring the issue of women's low employment rate, called ''Weg met het deeltijdfeminisme'' (''Away with Part-time Feminism'') in 2005. She identified differences between Dutch and American culture that partially explain the discrepancy in working hours between women in the two nations. In her book, Mees discusses the American "marketization" of much of women's former household duties, such as using businesses for laundry, eating out, having groceries delivered, and other services, which are rarely available in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gustafsson|first=Siv|title=Why Is the Netherlands the Best Country?: On Country Comparisons Regarding the Economics of the Family|year=2008|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789056295110|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Childcare is the largest expense for two-income families in the Netherlands, and since it is customarily paid by the hour, this may provide an incentive for families to reduce childcare costs by having the mother do more child-minding and less paid employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gustafsson|first=Siv|title=Why Is the Netherlands the Best Country?: On Country Comparisons Regarding the Economics of the Family|year=2008|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789056295110|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Economist]]'', fewer men had to fight in the World Wars of the 20th century, and so Dutch women did not experience working for pay at rates women in other countries did. The wealth of the country, coupled with the fact that "[Dutch] politics was dominated by Christian values until the 1980s" meant that Dutch women were slower to enter into the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/05/economist-explains-12&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Netherlands, together with Germany and Austria, were identified by the European Commission as countries with a poor integration of women in the workforce; [[Jose Manuel Barroso]] stated "Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, should look at the example of the northern countries."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-persistently-low-birthrate-gets-marginal-boost/a-15325123-0&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, the Netherlands had the highest percentage of part-time women workers in the OECD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/LMF_1_6_Gender_differences_in_employment_outcomes.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071301/http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/LMF_1_6_Gender_differences_in_employment_outcomes.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been criticism that the Netherlands has constructed a policy focused on emphasizing the alleged difference between 'liberated' ethnic Dutch women and 'oppressed' immigrant women, creating a discriminatory dichotomy of "us ''vs''. them".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-kiel.de/psychologie/ispp/doc_upload/Roggeband_migrant_women.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CEDAW]] committee stated that "[t]he Committee remains concerned about the persistence of gender-role stereotypes, in particular about immigrant and migrant 
women and men, both of which are portrayed as being backward and having traditional views about women, denying their right to full development."&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/co/CEDAW-C-NLD-CO-5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Violence against women]] remains a problem in the Netherlands: according to a 2014 study published by the [[European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights]], the Netherlands had the fourth highest prevalence rate of physical and sexual violence against women in Europe, with 45% of women having experienced such violence, which is well above the European average of 33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2014-vaw-survey-main-results_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307224554/http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2014-vaw-survey-main-results_en.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Netherlands was condemned by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 1985 in the case of ''X and Y v. the Netherlands'', for inadequate prosecution of sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-57603#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-57603%22]}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Netherlands ratified the [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]] (Istanbul Convention).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/210/signatures&lt;/ref&gt;

An important (and controversial) contemporary activist  is [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]] a [[Somali people|Somali]]-born Dutch-American dual citizen activist, author, and politician. She is critical of [[female genital mutilation]] and [[Criticism of Islam|Islam]], and supportive of [[women's rights]] and [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;https://nypost.com/2015/03/22/activist-argues-for-a-complete-reformation-of-islam/&lt;/ref&gt;

Where [[metaphysics]] tries to explain what is the universe and what it is like, '''feminist metaphysics''' questions how metaphysical answers have supported [[sexism]].&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Feminist Metaphysics | encyclopedia=[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] | last1=Haslanger|first1=Sally|last2=Sveinsdóttir|first2=Ásta Kristjana | editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N. | year=2011 | edition=Winter 2011|oclc=224325075|issn=1095-5054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Are ideas we have about fundamental subjects like: the self, mind and body, nature, essence, and identity formed with gendered bias? For instance, feminist metaphysics would ask if [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]]&amp;mdash;the concept of humans having minds separate from our bodies&amp;mdash;privileges men or [[masculinity]].&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt;

== Social construction ==
The famous quote “One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman,” coined by [[Simone de Beauvoir]], can be considered feminist metaphysical critique.{{cn|date=January 2018}} De Beauvoir does not deny that some people are born with female body parts, but that those body parts need not imply how one is socially situated. Yet for many societies being in possession of those body parts prescribes social roles, norms, and activities, and the differences are said to be necessary, because they are natural.&lt;ref name=SecondSex-1949&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Second Sex|last = de Beauvoir|first = Simone|publisher = Vintage Books|year = 1949|isbn =978-1-473-52191-9  |location = New York|pages = Chapter 1|oclc=896850610|title-link = The Second Sex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since de Beauvoir many feminists have presented the view that social hierarchies are perpetuated by the fallacy that they are metaphysically "natural". In fact, the power that comes from naturalising myths about universal categories, has made feminists wary of accepting that any category at all is "natural". And subsequently a response is that any such supposedly "natural" category, should not be a basis for how we organize ourselves socially.&lt;ref name=AfterIdentity-2008&gt;{{Cite book|title = After Identity: Rethinking Race, Sex, and Gender|last = Warnke|first = Georgia|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2008|isbn =978-0-521-88281-1 |location = Cambridge, UK  &amp; New York |pages = |oclc=165408056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critique of social construction ===
If being a woman is not due to "situation", like biology, de Beauvoir claims that it is due to "instrumentality" of women's freedom.{{huh|date=January 2018|reason=gobbledygook}} Critic [[Judith Butler]] finds this problematic because de Beauvoir's reasoning, now plots "situation" against "instrumentality", plays into Cartesian [[body-freedom dualism]].&lt;ref name=GenderTrouble-1990&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender Trouble|last = Butler|first = Judith|publisher = Routledge|year = 1990|isbn = 978-0-415-90042-3|location = New York |pages = 12|oclc=19630577|title-link = Gender Trouble}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{huh|date=January 2018|reason=gobbledygook}}

{{for|the American rock band|Grateful Dead}}
'''Grateful dead'''  (or '''grateful ghost''') is a [[Folklore|folktale]] present in many cultures throughout the world. The most common story involves a traveler who encounters a corpse of someone who never received a proper [[burial]], typically stemming from an unpaid debt.&lt;ref name="encybrit"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9037771/grateful-dead#23476.hook|title=Grateful dead|accessdate=2007-12-14|year=2007|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cscmu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mleone/gdead/faq/name.html|title=Dead FAQ: How did they get the name?|accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traveler then either pays off the dead person's debt or pays for burial. The traveler is later rewarded or has their life saved by a person or animal who is actually the soul of the dead person; the grateful dead is a form of the [[donor (fairy tale)|donor]].

The "grateful dead" story is [[Aarne–Thompson]]–Uther type 505.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0505.html|title=The Grateful Dead:  folktales of Aarne–Thompson–Uther type 505|author=D.L. Ashliman|accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ancient Egyptian text explains the [[Golden Rule|principle of reciprocity]] in which the deceased calls for a blessing on the person who remembers his name and helps him into a happy afterlife:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But if there be a man, any one whomsoever, who beholdeth this writing and causeth my soul and my name to become established among those who are blessed, let it be done for him likewise after his final arriving (at the end of life's voyage) in recompense for what was done by him for me, Osiris.&lt;ref&gt;"The Burden of Isis, Being the Laments of Isis and Nephthys", James Teackle Dennis, Dutton &amp; Co, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One variant is the [[Book of Tobit]].&lt;ref name="hibbard74"&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England'' p74. New York Burt Franklin,1963&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[chivalric romance]] ''[[Amadas]]'' has the title knight pay his last coins for such a burial.&lt;ref name="hibbard74"/&gt;  It appears in various fairy tales, such as the Italian ''[[Fair Brow]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 725 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Swedish ''[[The Bird 'Grip']]'' and [[Hans Christian Andersen|H.

'''''Hooray for Diffendoofer Day!''''' is a [[children's literature|children's book]] credited to [[Dr. Seuss]] "with some help from [[Jack Prelutsky]] and [[Lane Smith (illustrator)|Lane Smith]]". The book is based on verses and sketches created by Seuss before his death in 1991, and was expanded to book length and completed by writer Prelutsky and illustrator Smith for publication in 1998.

The story surrounds a school that is well liked by its students notably because of its many eccentric teachers. However, the students must make a good grade on a [[standardized test]] (which turns out in the end to be a revising test on multiple subjects they regularly learn) lest they be sent to an adjacent school, which requires uniforms to be worn and is incredibly dull.{{Dr. Seuss}}

'''''In Theory Only''''' ({{ISSN|0360-4365}}) was a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] specializing in [[music theory]] and [[musical analysis|analysis]]. It began publication in 1975, under the auspices of graduate students in music theory at the [[University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance]], making it the first of the graduate-student produced theory journals to debut in the U.S. (followed two years later by ''[[Indiana Theory Review]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[David Carson Berry]], "Schenkerian Theory in the United States: A Review of Its Establishment and a Survey of Current Research Topics," ''Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft für Musiktheorie'' 2/2–3 (2005), 111 (online version at http://www.gmth.de/zeitschrift/artikel/206.aspx).&lt;/ref&gt; The journal initially employed the subtitle "Newsletter of the Michigan Music Theory Society" (later dropped). The journal is no longer published.

[[File:Jerusalem Jewish Quarter map.svg|right|275px|thumb|Map of Jerusalem's Jewish Quarter. The Israelite Tower stands north of the [[Broad Wall (Jerusalem)|Broad Wall]]]]
The '''Israelite Tower''' ({{lang-he|המגדל הישראלי}}) is an archaeological site in [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]]. The site features remains of the city's [[Iron Age]] fortifications which were later incorporated into the [[Hasmonean]] city walls. It was excavated by Israeli archaeologist [[Nahman Avigad]] during the 1970s. Finds unearthed at the site attest to the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]] [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|destruction of Jerusalem]] in 586 BCE.

==Excavation==
Between 1969 and 1982 Nahman Avigad conducted extensive excavations in the Jewish Quarter, situated on Jerusalem's southwestern hill. These excavations, covering an area of some 5 acres, proved crucial for the understanding of the history of settlement in this section of the old city. In the northern part of the quarter, Avigad and his team uncovered three well-preserved segments of late Iron Age ([[First Temple Period]]) fortifications. One of these was the Israelite Tower, described as "one of the most impressive fortification remains from biblical times to have been found in the land of Israel".&lt;ref name=baa/&gt;

===Israelite Tower===
Slightly north of the [[Broad Wall (Jerusalem)|Broad Wall]], excavations revealed two perpendicular walls about {{convert|4|m|ft}} wide and surviving to a maximal height of {{convert|7|m|ft}}. One is {{convert|12|m|ft}} long, running from east to west, and the other {{convert|8|m|ft}} long and runs from north to south.&lt;ref name=baa/&gt; Standing on bedrock 45 feet below modern ground level, the walls were built of rough-hewn field stones placed in courses along both faces, with the spaces in-between filled with small stones. A surface of beaten earth tightly bonded to the tower, covered by ashes, produced Late Iron Age II [[sherds]] characteristic of the 8th and 7th centuries BCE.&lt;ref name=t10/&gt; Avigad identified the tower as the corner of a four-chambered gatehouse in Jerusalem's northern wall, perhaps the "Middle Gate" mentioned in {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|39:3|HE}}. It had been built to protect the city's vulnerable northern perimeter, probably during the 8th century BCE but perhaps during the reign of [[Manasseh of Judah|Menasseh]] in the 7th century BCE.&lt;ref name=t10/&gt;&lt;ref name=ih/&gt; It is physically close to the Broad Wall, built during the reign of king [[Hezekiah]], but appears to have come into use after the Broad Wall had already fallen into disuse.&lt;ref name=baa/&gt;

Finds at the tower attest to a battle. On the last day of the 1975 excavation season, Avigad's team unearthed four arrowheads buried in the layer of soot and ashes at the base of the tower. One was made of iron and the other three of bronze, including one distinguished from the others by three triangular fins and a hollow socket for the shaft. This was identified as a [[Scythian|Scytho]]-Iranian type in widespread use by Babylonian archers after 600 BCE.&lt;ref name=t10/&gt; As the pottery found within the conflagration layer is dated earlier than 586 BCE, the range of dates for the possible battle at the site is reduced significantly. The four arrowheads are therefore likely remnants of the Babylonian siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BCE. They are thought to be the first remains ever recovered of the Babylonian siege, having come to rest in the ashes of the burning city, as described in {{bibleverse|2|Kings|25|HE}}.&lt;ref name=baa/&gt;&lt;ref name=t10/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco/&gt;

Avigad's discoveries also provided an answer to a contemporary debate about the extent of Iron Age Jerusalem. Before the excavation of the Jewish quarter, scholars had been divided between those that believed the city had been confined to its eastern ridge, including the [[Temple Mount]] and the [[City of David]], and those who believed the biblical city has already expanded to encompass the southwestern hill. Avigad's discoveries, since augmented by additional finds, had proven that by the end of the First Temple period, Jerusalem's city walls had expanded to the [[Hinnom Valley]] in the west and had encompassed the entire southwestern hill.&lt;ref name=baa/&gt;&lt;ref name=t10/&gt;

===Hasmonean Tower===
Abutting and incorporating the Israelite Tower are the remains of another tower and city wall.&lt;ref name=ih/&gt; Shaped like the Greek letter {{pi}}, the tower extends north from the wall. Constructed of medium-size, well-cut, close-fitting rectangular ashlars, the tower walls are {{convert|9|m|ft}} long and between 2.5m and 3m thick. The masonry is characteristic of the 1st or 2nd centuries BCE, as is the pottery found on and below another surface bonded to the wall, 1.3 meters above the earlier 6th century floor. These have linked the later defences to the Hasmonean "First Wall", described in detail in [[Josephus]]' ''[[The Jewish War]]''.&lt;ref name=wall/&gt; Although Josephus erroneously attributes it to [[David]], [[Solomon]] and the kings of Judah, construction of the wall was initiated by [[Jonathan Maccabeus]] and completed by his brother [[Simon Maccabeus|Simon]] during the 2nd century BCE. A nearby gap between fragments of the wall hints that another city gate stood at the site, possibly the [[Gennath gate]] also mentioned by Josephus.&lt;ref name=t10/&gt;&lt;ref name=ih/&gt;&lt;ref name=jer/&gt;&lt;ref name=forts/&gt;

==Access==
The Israelite Tower is located at the modern junction of Plugot HaKotel and Shonei HaLakhot streets,&lt;ref name=ih/&gt; preserved underneath a school.&lt;ref name=sco/&gt; Access is limited and requires reservation.

'''Kvetera Church''' ({{lang-ka|კვეტერის ეკლესია}}) is a [[Georgian Orthodox]] church in a historic fortified town of Kvetera in [[Kakheti]].

Kvetera Church was built in the early part of the 10th century. It is a relatively small church and resembles the Georgian [[cross-dome]]  style of architecture. The dome rests on a round tympanum and rises over the central square pace. The Projections end in an apse, which have niches between them. The facade of the church is not designed with a lot of ornaments which is typical for Kakhetian churches. Most  of the facade is decorated with symmetrical arches. 

Town of Kvetera used to one of the center of the Principality of Kakheti. According to [[Vakhushti Bagrationi]], Kvetera dates back at least to 8th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spiritual Treasure of Georgia'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It is also mentioned in the written document from the 11th century.

[[File:Mobile-shelving-roller-racking-system.jpg|thumb|right|Small mobile aisle shelving / roller racking system]]
'''Mobile shelving''', '''mobile aisle shelving''', '''roller racking''', or '''rolling stack''', are terms applied to shelving or storage units fitted with wheeled traction systems. Units can be closely packed when access is not required, but can be readily moved to open up an aisle to allow access. By eliminating the need for a permanently open aisle between every unit, a smaller proportion of floor space can be allocated to storage than in the case of conventional fixed shelving, or a higher capacity of storage can be met using the same footprint as fixed shelving.

Each shelving unit is normally mounted on a level trackway (to eliminate gradients in the supporting floor), making it possible to move heavy units with minimal effort. Mobile shelving can be moved manually or by the use of electrical motors. The track/flooring can either sit on top of an existing floor or be integrated into raised access flooring allowing for a smooth transition between unit and surrounding floor levels.

== Manual mobile shelving ==
Mobile storage systems are usually constructed with a rotary handle on the exterior accessible face. When rotated, the handle operates the mechanism which winds the single, connected, filing unit either left or right, depending on a clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the handle. In an office, for example, several stacks of movable [[filing cabinets]] may be accommodated in a limited space.

Drive mechanisms vary; traditionally systems were offered with chain drive but modern technology allows belt drive systems which provides smooth, quiet operation.

Although the "bays of shelving" that sit on the mobile chassis  come in many standard sizes, they can be mixed to create run lengths of shelving to maximise the room length.

The tracks can be installed onto many different types of floor and on different levels. The tracks themselves can either have a false floor running in between so that the tracks do not become trip hazards, or they can be put into the floor (usually concrete floor) or have small ramps on either side of the tracks. Either option creates a hazard-free floor and track system.

== Powered mobile shelving ==
[[File:Powered mobile shelving.jpg|thumb|right|Powered mobile shelving]]
Powered shelving is electrically powered. Units normally have a small [[Alternating current|AC]] or [[Direct current|DC]] motor hidden in the base that automatically moves the units when a single button is pressed. High-end versions connect into archiving databases, and using [[RFID]] allows the easy retrieval of archived items with auto-open and close functions.

== Applications ==
[[File:Firestone Library Princeton mobile aisle shelving.jpg|thumb|Princeton University's Firestone Library's mobile aisle shelving / roller racking system]]
Mobile aisle shelving is typically used for academic or commercial applications where a significant volume of physical archive material, filing or books is to be stored. These include medical or government records, file-intensive offices such as the legal or accountancy professions, and public and academic libraries and similar archives. 

Another common use is in retail stockrooms to maximise the stock capacity, or to reduce the back of house storage space required so that a greater proportion of the overall shop space can be used for customer retail purposes.

===Capacity, siting and speed advantages===
A typical bank of mobile office shelving units offers close to a 50% reduction of floor space, or a 50% to 100% increase in storage space, compared to traditional filing cabinets. The ability to concertina individual units until touching means space is only required between units when they are being accessed by users. Applications with a greater number of simultaneous users may require more access spaces (aisles), thus not approaching this 50% target so closely.

When the bank of units is closed, the contents are protected from light and dust, and the whole bank of units can be secured by locking the end unit(s) in place. This makes mobile shelving ideal for holding museum and archive collections.

'''Mountain whites''' were usually poor [[White Americans|whites]] living in the [[Southern United States]] in Pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] America. They inhabited the valleys of the Appalachian range from western Virginia to northern Georgia and Alabama.
&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, David M., Lizabeth Cohen, and Thomas Andrew Bailey. The American pageant: a history of the Republic. 13th ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 

They were often isolated from the rest of Southern society and civilization. Because of this, they did not own slaves and were likelier to be critical of slavery. As independent small farmers living on the harsh frontier, their interests were starkly different from those of white Southerners that lived on commercial plantations or in large cities. They were also able to retain many of their customs they brought over from Europe that had long since died out in Europe. 

During the Civil War, some communities of mountain whites were deeply split by those who identified with the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and those who identified with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Pro-Union attitudes were likelier to prevail among mountain whites in a few states like Virginia, where this sentiment was seen as one of the leading causes of the [[West Virginia]]'s secession from the rest of the state.

Mountain whites also developed their own styles of music which borrowed from Scottish and Irish tradition as many were of [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] descent. The music of mountain whites contributed heavily to the formation of [[bluegrass music]].

[[File:Tradescant's Ark.jpg|thumb|Tradescant's Ark]]
The '''''Musaeum Tradescantianum''''' was the first [[museum]] open to the public to be established in [[England]]. Located in Vauxhall in south [[London]], it comprised a collection of [[curiosities]] assembled by [[John Tradescant the elder]] and [[John Tradescant the younger|his son]] in a building called The Ark, and a botanical collection in the grounds of the building. Turret House, the family home, was demolished in 1881 and the estate has been redeveloped; the house stood on the site of the present Tradescant Road and Walberswick Street, off South Lambeth Road.

Tradescant divided the exhibits into natural objects (''naturalia'') and manmade objects (''artificialia'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/amulets/tradescant/tradescant04.html "Musaeum Tradescantianum", [[Ashmolean Museum]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The first account of the collection, by [[Peter Mundy]], is from 1634.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/amulets/tradescant/tradescant03.html "The Tradescant Collection", Ashmolean Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of the younger Tradescant and his wife, the collection passed into the hands of the wealthy collector [[Elias Ashmole]], who in 1691 gave it to [[Oxford University]] as the nucleus of the newly founded [[Ashmolean Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vauxhallcivicsociety.org.uk/home/history/tradescant-family Tradescant family]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tradescant collection is the earliest major English [[cabinet of curiosities]].  Other famous collections in Europe preceded it, for example Emperor [[Rudolf II]]'s Kunst- und Wunderkammer was well established at [[Prague]] by the end of the 16th century. The [[Garden Museum]] has recently{{When?|date=April 2017}} received a £3.5 million Heritage Lottery grant to recreate a part of the original Ark with loans from the Ashmolean Museum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Garden Museum awarded grant of £3.5million by Heritage Lottery Fund {{!}} Heritage Lottery Fund|url = https://www.hlf.org.uk/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/garden-museum-awarded-grant-%C2%A335million-heritage-lottery-fund|website = www.hlf.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gaspard De La Fontaine.jpg|thumb|[[Gaspard-Théodore-Ignace de la Fontaine]], leader of the Orangists]]
'''Orangism''' was a movement in the 19th century [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] favouring the [[personal union]] of the [[Netherlands]] and Luxembourg under the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. Made up of many notable figures, mainly nobles and Roman Catholic clergy, they were moderate liberals or conservative-liberals and slightly anti-clerical. At first they favoured maintaining the Grand Duchy's autonomous status and, especially during the [[Belgian Revolution]], opposed it being merged into [[Belgium]]. In the end the western part of the Grand Duchy (the present province of [[Luxembourg (province)|Luxembourg]]) passed to Belgium, whilst the eastern part and the Orange grand duchy continued as an independent state. In 1890 the heads of the House of Orange were grand dukes of Luxembourg, but on the death of king and grand duke [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]] in 1890 he was succeeded by his relation [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Adolphe]] as grand duke since Luxembourg's constitution did not allow a woman ([[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Princess Wilhelmina]]) to hold the throne. The movement's newsletter was the ''Journal de la Ville et du Pays Luxembourg''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

It is the only Leoncavallo opera that is still widely performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2016/2/Departments/Operapedia_%E2%80%94_Pagliacci.html |last=Stewart |first=Henry | title=Operapedia: ''Pagliacci'' | journal=Opera News | volume=80 |issue=8 |pages= |date=February 2016 |accessdate=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opera companies have frequently staged ''Pagliacci'' with ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' by [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]], a double bill known colloquially as 'Cav and Pag'.

''Pagliacci'' premiered at the [[Teatro Dal Verme]] in Milan on 21 May 1892, conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]], with [[Adelina Stehle]] as Nedda, [[Fiorello Giraud]] as Canio, [[Victor Maurel]] as Tonio, and [[Mario Ancona]] as Silvio. [[Nellie Melba]] played Nedda in London in 1893, soon after the Italian premiere, and it was given in New York on 15 June 1893, with Agostino Montegriffo as Canio.

==Composition history==
Around 1890, when [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' premiered, Leoncavallo was a little-known composer. After seeing Mascagni's success, he decided to write an opera in response: one act composed in the [[verismo]] style. Leoncavallo wrote that he based the story of ''Pagliacci'' on an incident from his childhood:&lt;ref name="Leoncavallo"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=25119331|last=Leoncavallo|first=R.|title=How I Wrote ''Pagliacci''|journal=The North American Review|volume=175|issue=552|pages=652–654|date=November 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; a murder in 1865, the victim of which was a Leoncavallo family servant, Gaetano Scavello. The murderer was Gaetano D'Alessandro, with his brother Luigi an accomplice to the crime. The incident resulted from a series of perceived romantic entanglements involving Scavello, Luigi D'Alessandro, and a village girl with whom both men were infatuated.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Leoncavallo's father, a judge, was the presiding magistrate over the criminal investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The opera quarterly |volume=3 |issue= 3-4 |series=The opera quarterly|year=1985|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon learning of the plot of Leoncavallo's libretto in an 1894 French translation, the French author [[Catulle Mendès]] thought it resembled his 1887 play ''La Femme de Tabarin'', such as the play-within-the-play and the clown murdering his wife. Mendès sued Leoncavallo for [[plagiarism]]. The composer pleaded ignorance of Mendès' play.&lt;ref name="Leoncavallo" /&gt; Later there were counter-accusations that Mendès' play resembled that of Don Manuel Tamayo y Baus' ''Un Drama Nuevo'' (1867). Mendès dropped his lawsuit. However, the scholar Matteo Sansone has suggested that, as Leoncavallo was a notable student of French culture, and lived in Paris from 1882 to 1888, he had ample opportunity to be exposed to new French art and musical works. These would potentially have included Mendès' play, another version of ''La femme de Tabarin'' by Paul Ferrier, and ''Tabarin'', an opera composed by Émile Pessard that was based on Ferrier's play. Sansone has elaborated on the many parallels among the Mendès, Ferrier, and Pessard versions of the Tabarin story and ''Pagliacci'', noting that Leoncavallo deliberately minimised any sort of connection between his opera and those earlier French works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ml.oxfordjournals.org/content/70/3/342.full.pdf+html|last=Sansone|first=Matteo|title=The 'Verismo' of Ruggero Leoncavallo: A Source Study of ''Pagliacci''|journal=[[Music &amp; Letters]]|volume=70|issue=3|pages=342–362|year=1989|accessdate=22 July 2012|doi=10.1093/ml/70.3.342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leoncavallo originally titled his story ''Il pagliaccio'' (''The Clown''). The baritone Victor Maurel, who was cast as the first Tonio, requested that Leoncavallo change the title from the singular ''Il pagliaccio'' to the plural ''Pagliacci'', to broaden dramatic interest from Canio alone to include Tonio (his own role).&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance history==
''Pagliacci'' received mixed critical reviews upon its world premiere, but was instantly successful with the public&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; and has remained so ever since. The UK premiere of ''Pagliacci'' took place at the [[Royal Opera House]], Covent Garden, in London on 19 May 1893. The US premiere followed a month later at [[Grand Opera House (Manhattan)|Grand Opera House]] in New York on 15 June, with American born tenor Agostino Montegriffo as Canio.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The Metropolitan Opera first staged the work on 11 December as a double-bill with ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'', with [[Nellie Melba]] in the role of Nedda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Pagliacci: Opera in Two Acts |series= G. Schirmer's collection of opera librettos |author= G. Schirmer |year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Met again staged ''Pagliacci'' as a double-bill, this time followed by ''Cavalleria rusticana'' on 22 December 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, M. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metopera.org/metoperafiles/met_history/CavPag-program-1893.jpg Met program], 22 December 1893&lt;/ref&gt; The two operas have since been frequently performed as a double-bill, a pairing referred to in the operatic world colloquially as 'Cav and Pag'. ''Pagliacci'' was produced alone in [[Washington National Opera]]'s November 1997 production by [[Franco Zeffirelli]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillips-Matz, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;  The re-organised [[New York City Opera]] presented ''Pagliacci'' in 2016 on a double bill with Rachmaninoff's ''[[Aleko (Rachmaninoff)|Aleko]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/arts/music/review-new-york-city-opera-aleka-pagliacci.html | title=Review: Signs of Rebirth at New York City Opera | work=The New York Times | author=Anthony Tommasini | date=2016-09-09 | accessdate=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
:Place: [[Calabria]], near [[Montalto Uffugo|Montalto]], on the [[Feast of the Assumption]]
:Time: between 1865 and 1870

===Prologue===
During the [[overture]], the curtain rises. From behind a second curtain, Tonio, dressed as his commedia character Taddeo, addresses the audience (''Si può?... Si può?... Signore! Signori! ... Un nido di memorie''). He reminds the audience that actors have feelings too, and that the show is about real people.

===Act 1===
At three o'clock in the afternoon, the commedia troupe enters the village to the cheering of the villagers. Canio describes the night's performance: the troubles of Pagliaccio. He says the play will begin at ''"ventitré ore"'', an agricultural method of time-keeping that means the play will begin an hour before sunset.&lt;ref group=note &gt;Literally "the twenty-third hour", but not 23:00 hours (11pm), as translated in some libretti. The term refers to when the hours were counted from one ''avemmaria della sera'' (evening [[angelus]]) to the next, and hence one hour before ''avemmaria'' or as in some libretti 'at sundown' {{harv|Trecanni|2015|loc=[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/ventitre_%28Enciclopedia-Dantesca%29/ Ventitre]}} {{harv|Trecanni|2015|loc=[http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/ventiquattro/ Ventiquattro]}} This ''Italian time'' was in use between the fourteenth and eighteenth centuries, but persisted in some isolated rural communities as here, till the mid nineteenth century. {{Harv|Swan|1892|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=asIBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA40 Time p.&amp;nbsp;40]}} In other operas it appears in ''[[Rigoletto]]'' and ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; As Nedda steps down from the cart, Tonio offers his hand, but Canio pushes him aside and helps her down himself.

The villagers suggest drinking at the tavern. Canio and Beppe accept, but Tonio stays behind. The villagers tease Canio that Tonio is planning an affair with Nedda. Canio warns everyone that while he may act the foolish husband in the play, in real life he will not tolerate other men making advances to Nedda. Shocked, a villager asks if Canio really suspects her. He says no, and sweetly kisses her on the forehead. As the church bells ring [[vespers]], he and Beppe leave for the tavern, leaving Nedda alone.

Nedda is frightened by Canio's vehemence (''Qual fiamma avea nel guardo''), but the birdsong comforts her (''Stridono lassù''). Tonio returns and confesses his love for her, but she laughs. Enraged, Tonio grabs Nedda, but she takes a whip, strikes him and drives him off. Silvio, who is Nedda's lover, comes from the tavern, where he has left Canio and Beppe drinking. He asks Nedda to elope with him after the performance and, though she is afraid, she agrees. Tonio, who has been eavesdropping, leaves to inform Canio so that he might catch Silvio and Nedda together. Canio and Tonio return and, as Silvio escapes, Nedda calls after him, "I will always be yours!"

[[File:Enrico Caruso As Canio.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Enrico Caruso]] as Canio in ''Pagliacci'', one of his signature roles]]
Canio chases Silvio, but does not catch him and does not see his face. He demands that Nedda tell him the name of her lover, but she refuses. He threatens her with a knife, but Beppe disarms him. Beppe insists that they prepare for the performance. Tonio tells Canio that her lover will give himself away at the play. Canio is left alone to put on his costume and prepares to laugh (''[[Vesti la giubba]]'' – "Put on the costume").

===Act 2===
As the crowd arrives, Nedda, costumed as [[Colombina]], collects their money. She whispers a warning to Silvio, and the crowd cheers as the play begins.

Colombina's husband Pagliaccio has gone away until morning, and Taddeo is at the market. She anxiously awaits her lover [[Arlecchino]], who comes to serenade her (''{{Lang|it|O Colombina}}'') from beneath her window. Taddeo returns and confesses his love, but she mocks him. She lets Arlecchino in through the window. He boxes Taddeo's ears and kicks him out of the room, and the audience laughs.

Arlecchino and Colombina dine, and he gives her a sleeping [[potion]] to use later. When Pagliaccio returns, Colombina will drug him and elope with Arlecchino. Taddeo bursts in, warning that Pagliaccio is suspicious of his wife and is about to return. As Arlecchino escapes through the window, Colombina tells him, "I will always be yours!"

As Canio (as Pagliaccio) enters, he hears Nedda (as Colombina) and exclaims "Name of God! Those same words!" He tries to continue the play, but loses control and demands to know her lover's name. Nedda, hoping to keep to the performance, calls Canio by his stage name "Pagliaccio," to remind him of the audience's presence. He answers with his [[Aria|arietta]]: ''{{Lang|it|No! Pagliaccio non son!}}'' He sings that if his face is pale, it is not from the stage makeup but from the shame she has brought him. The crowd, impressed by his emotional performance, which they do not realize is real, cheers him.

Nedda, trying to continue the play, admits that she has been visited by the innocent Arlecchino. Canio, furious and forgetting the play, demands the name of her lover. Nedda swears she will never tell him, and it becomes apparent that they are not acting. Beppe asks Tonio to intervene, but Tonio refrains and prevents Beppe from halting the action. Silvio begins to fight his way toward the stage. Canio, grabbing a knife from the table, stabs Nedda. As she dies, she calls: "Help! Silvio!" Silvio attacks Canio, but Canio kills Silvio also. The horrified audience then hears the celebrated final line:
: ''{{Lang|it|La commedia è finita}}!'' – "The comedy is finished!"

==Assignment of the final line==
In the original manuscript, Tonio sang the opera's final line, "{{Lang|it|La Commedia è finita!}}", paralleling the prologue, also sung by Tonio. The appropriation of this final line by Canio dates back to 1895. John Wright has analysed the dramaturgy of the opera in the context of assignment of the final line, and concluded that the original assignment of the final line to Tonio is the most consistent and appropriate assignment. Wright says that Tonio shows more deliberate control in his manipulation of the other characters in order to obtain his revenge upon Nedda, after she has rejected him, and is more aware of the demarcation between life and art. By contrast, Canio is unaware of the behind-the-scenes manipulations and surrenders control of his perception of the difference between life and art as the opera proceeds.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=478969 | last=Wright | first=John | title='La Commedia è finita' – An Examination of Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci'' | journal=Italica | volume=55 | issue=2 | pages=167–178 | date=Summer 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present day, the assignment of the final line to Canio has continued to be standard. Several exceptions, where Tonio delivers the final line, include:

==Recordings and other media==
{{Main|Pagliacci discography}}

In 1907, ''Pagliacci'' became the first opera to be recorded in its entirety, with the Puerto Rican tenor [[Antonio Paoli]] as Canio and under Leoncavallo's personal supervision. In 1931, it became the first complete opera to be filmed with sound, in a now-obscure version starring the tenor Fernando Bertini as Canio, in his only film, with the [[San Carlo Opera Company]]. Franco Zeffirelli directed his 1981 La Scala production with [[Plácido Domingo]] and [[Teresa Stratas]] for a [[Pagliacci (1982 film)|1982 television airing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/09/arts/tv-weekend-zeffirelli-s-pagliacci-from-la-scala-in-1982.html|title=TV Weekend: Zeffirelli's ''Pagliacci'' from La Scala in 1982|work=The New York Times|author=John J O'Connor|date=1984-11-09|accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has since been released on DVD. The movie's soundtrack received a [[Grammy]] nomination for Best Opera Recording. ''Pagliacci'' was also recorded in English in 1997, and released commercially in 1998, for the [[Chandos Records|Chandos]] "Opera in English" label with [[Dennis O'Neill (tenor)|Dennis O'Neill]] as Canio, [[Alan Opie]] as Tonio, and [[Rosa Mannion]] as Nedda.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]''.

'''Penult''' is a linguistics term for the second to last [[syllable]] of a word. It is an abbreviation of ''penultimate'', which describes the next-to-last item in a series. The penult follows the antepenult and precedes the [[ultima (linguistics)|ultima]]. For example, the main stress falls on the penult in such English words as ''banána'', and ''Mississíppi''. Occasionally, "penult" refers to the last word but one of a sentence.

The terms are often used in reference to languages like [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]], where the position of the [[pitch accent]] or [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] of a word only falls on one of the last three syllables, and sometimes in discussing [[poetry|poetic]] [[meter (poetry)|meter]].

In certain languages, such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_wel Welsh] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208235237/http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_wel |date=2015-12-08 }} in the World Atlas of Language Structures&lt;/ref&gt;, stress is always on the penult.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wals.info/chapter/14 Chapter 14: Fixed Stress Locations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151207160058/http://wals.info/chapter/14 |date=2015-12-07 }} in the World Atlas of Language Structures&lt;/ref&gt;

The  '''''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy''''' (''PRIA'') is the journal of the [[Royal Irish Academy]], founded in 1785 to promote the study of [[science]], [[polite literature]], and [[antiquities]]. It was known as several titles over the years:
*1836-1866: ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy''
*1870-1884: ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Science''
*1879: ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Polite Literature and Antiquities''
*1889-1901: ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy''

In 1902, the journal split into three sections ''Section A: Mathematical and Physical Sciences'', ''Section B: Biological, Geological, and Chemical Science'' and ''Section C: Archaeology, Culture, History, Literature''. ''Section A'' is now published as ''Mathematical Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'' since 1998, and ''Section B'' is now published as ''Biology and Environment: Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy''. ''Section C'' is now ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy: Archaeology, Culture, History, Literature''.

Drones are used by the military in situations where manned flight is considered too risky or difficult. The United States Air Force has drones that range from small intelligence drones to surveillance drones and large spy planes. The drones are unmanned, but they have a pilot. Trained crew steer the craft through cameras that send back what they see.

The military began using these crafts to strike suspected militants in Pakistan’s tribal areas under President George W Bush, but the use of drones has almost doubled since the Obama administration took office.

The year before the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, drone funding stood at around $284&amp;nbsp;million. By the fiscal year 2016, the Pentagon spent close to $3&amp;nbsp;billion on drones. Since their start 3,900 people have been killed in 422 strikes in Pakistan, where the drones are controlled by the Central Intelligence Agency. The controversy of drones stems from the American people’s concern of using advanced technologies to kill an enemy in foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-10713898|title=Drones: What are they and how do they work?|date=2012|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since drone strikes had been first used in Pakistan in 2008, members of the military have had differing views on the tactic. Supporters of drone strikes believe that this use of unmanned attacks coerce the civilian population to support the counterinsurgent force. Members of the military also believe that the non-human nature of drones and the distance from the civilians when their attack make them dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khalili|first=Laleh|date=2012|title=Fighting Over Drones|jstor=41702457|journal=Middle East Report|issue=264|pages=18–21|doi=10.2307/41702457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monmouth University Poll on July 25–30, 2013 asked 1,012 adults nationwide the question "How much have you read or heard about the use of unmanned surveillance aircraft, sometimes called drones, by the U.S. military overseas: a great deal, some, just a little, or nothing at all?" 29% replied a great deal, 31% some, 25% just a little and 15% said nothing at all (margin of error of 3.1) The same group of people were asked the question "How confident are you that FEDERAL law enforcement agencies will use drones appropriately: very, somewhat, not too, or not at all confident?" 11% said very confident, 36% somewhat confident, 18% not too confident, 31% not confident at all and 4% unsure (margin of error of 3.1).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/crime.htm|title=Crime|last=|first=|date=|website=www.pollingreport.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a poll was taken by Fox News in February 2013 with a margin of error of 3, the majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents approve of the use of drones to kill a suspected foreign terrorist on US soil. They also collectively disapprove of killing a suspected terrorist who is a US citizen on US soil using drones.

The same group of people were asked the question "Do you think the president of the United States, on his own, should be able to authorize the use of deadly force, such as a drone strike, to kill a suspected terrorist who is a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil?" This question was asked while Barack Obama was in office. The public answered by 32% of people saying yes, 63% of people saying no, and 5% of people saying they were unsure (margin of error of 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/terror.htm|title=Terrorism|website=www.pollingreport.com|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]'s PublicMind poll conducted a study to measure U.S. public opinion on the use of [[UCAV|drone]]s. The study was conducted nationwide, and it asked registered voters whether they "approve or disapprove of the U.S. Military using drones to carry out attacks abroad on people and other targets deemed a threat to the U.S.?" The results showed that three in every four (75%) of voters approved of the U.S. military using drones to carry out attacks, while (13%) disapproved.&lt;ref&gt;Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind, (February 7, 2013). [http://www.publicmind.fdu.edu/2013/drone/ Public says it's illegal to target Americans abroad as some question CIA drone attacks] (press release)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another poll in February 2013 conducted by the Huffington Post was more equivocal: 56% of Americans support using drones to kill "high-level terrorists", 13% support using drones to kill "anyone associated with terrorists", 16% thought no one should be killed with drones, and 15% were not sure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/15/drone-program-poll_n_2696352.html|title=Drone Program Poll: The Public Does Not Uncritically Embrace Targeted Killings|date=15 February 2013|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside America, support for drones is far lower. A Pew Research study of 20 countries in 2012 found widespread international opposition to US drone killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/2013/02/06/u-s-use-of-drones-under-new-scrutiny-has-been-widely-opposed-abroad/|title=U.S. Use of Drones, Under New Scrutiny, Has Been Widely Opposed Abroad|date=6 February 2013|work=Pew Research Center|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this is that there is a shortage of media coverage for drone strikes and the procedure involved with them. This can cause a sense of unease pertaining to the use of drones.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/business/media/the-inconvenient-but-vital-drone-debate.html?_r=0 Debating Drones, in the Open] by David Carr, The New York Times, February 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The web aggregator blog ''[[3 Quarks Daily]]'' in partnership with the Netherlands-based ''Dialogue Advisory Group'' hosted a symposium on drone attacks in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B-5CBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR13&amp;lpg=PR13&amp;dq=founding+of+3+quarks+daily+-3quarksdaily&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fYpws7-gaE&amp;sig=YjYxxWaKgX05S6vt4qWq72Ye9R8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwA2oVChMIsYP_9tDbyAIVyjI-Ch1ifAp2#v=onepage&amp;q=founding%20of%203%20quarks%20daily%20-3quarksdaily&amp;f=false ''Opposing Perspectives on the Drone Debate''] by Bradley Jay Strawser, Palgrave Macmillan [2014], {{ISBN|9781137432612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 poll conducted by Jacquelyn Schneider and Julia Macdonald for Center for New American Security qualified some of this perceived support for drone strikes by giving respondents a chance to choose between drones, manned, neither platform, or both to conduct air strikes.  They found that, while the American public was more likely to support unmanned than manned air strikes by approximately 10-15 percentage points, this support for unmanned was much less pronounced than previous polls suggested. In many cases the U.S. public supported air strikes from both manned and unmanned at similar rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/u-s-public-support-for-drone-strikes/|title=U.S. Public Support for Drone Strikes: When Do Americans Prefer Unmanned Over Manned Platforms?|date=20 September 2016|work=Center for a New American Security|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''racial achievement gap in the United States'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.childcarequarterly.com/pdf/fall09_gap.pdf|title=The achievement gap: What early childhood educators need to know|first=Barbara A.|last=Langham}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the educational disparities between various ethnic groups. It manifests itself in a variety of ways: among students, [[Black Americans|blacks]] and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]] are more likely to receive lower grades, score lower on standardized tests, [[high school dropouts in the United States|drop out of high school]], and they are less likely to enter and complete college than whites, who similarly score lower than [[East Asia|East Asians]] who originate from the rich [[industrialized]] [[developed country|developed countries]] of [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]] and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/achievement-gap/index.html?cmp=SOC-SHR-FB|title=Achievement Gap|first=Susan|last=Ansell|website=Education Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence of the racial achievement gap==
{{Main|National Assessment of Educational Progress}}

Over the past 45 years, students in the [[United States]] have made notable gains in academic achievement. However, the racial achievement gap remains because not all groups of students are advancing at the same rates. Evidence of the racial achievement gap has been manifested through standardized test scores, high school dropout rates, high school completion rates, college acceptance and retention rates, as well as through longitudinal trends. While efforts to close the racial achievement gap have increased over the years with varying success, studies have shown that disparities still exist between achievement levels of minorities compared to their White counterparts.

===Early schooling years===

====Kindergarten through fifth grade====
The racial achievement gap has been found to exist before students enter [[kindergarten]] for their first year of schooling.&lt;ref name="Reardon, S. F. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reardon |first=S. F. |first2=C. |last2=Galindo |title=The Hispanic-White Achievement Gap in Math and Reading in the Elementary Grades |journal=American Educational Research Journal |volume=46 |issue=3 |year=2009 |pages=853–91 |doi=10.3102/0002831209333184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of kindergarten, Hispanic and black students have math and reading scores substantially lower than those of white students. While both Hispanics and blacks scores have  significantly lower test scores than their white counterparts, Hispanic and black have scores that are roughly equal to each other. In a study published in 2009, Reardon and Galindo (2009) specifically examine test scores by race and ethnicity. The data Reardon and Galindo (2009) use comes from the ECLS-K, sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics. The ECLS-K contains data on a nationally representative sample of approximately 21,400 students from the kindergarten class of 1998–1999. Students in the sample were assessed in reading and mathematics skills six times from 1998 to 2004. The content areas of the tests are based on the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] (NAEP) fourth-grade content areas, adapted to be age appropriate at each grade level. The assessments were scored using a three-parameter [[Item Response Theory]] (IRT) model. Reardon and Galindo (2009) found that average Hispanic and black students begin kindergarten with math scores three quarters of a standard deviation lower than those of white students and with reading scores a half standard deviation lower than those of white students. Six years later, Hispanic-white gaps narrow by roughly a third, whereas black-white gaps widen by about a third. More specifically, the Hispanic-white gap is a half standard deviation in math, and three-eighths in reading at the end of fifth grade. The trends in the Hispanic-white gaps are especially interesting because of the rapid narrowing that occurs between kindergarten and first grade. Specifically, the estimated math gap declines from 0.77 to 0.56 standard deviations, and the estimated reading gap from 0.52 to 0.29 in the roughly 18 months between the fall of kindergarten and the spring of first grade. In the four years from the spring of first grade through the spring of fifth grade, the Hispanic-white gaps narrow slightly to 0.50 standard deviations in math and widening slightly to 0.38 deviations in reading.&lt;ref name="Reardon, S. F. 2009"/&gt;

====Third through eighth grade====
In a 2009 study Clotfelter et al. examine test scores of elementary and middle school students by race.&lt;ref name="Clotfelter, Charles T. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clotfelter |first=Charles T. |first2=Helen F. |last2=Ladd |first3=Jacob L. |last3=Vigdor |title=The Academic Achievement Gap in Grades 3 to 8 |journal=[[Review of Economics and Statistics]] |volume=91 |issue=2 |year=2009 |pages=398–419 |doi=10.1162/rest.91.2.398  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The data used in the study comes from administrative records created by North Carolina's Department of Public Instruction and maintained by the North Carolina Education Research Data Center and are not nationally representative. North Carolina requires all students to take standardized achievement tests in both math and reading at the end of every grade between grades 3 and 8. In order to make comparisons across years, Clotfelter et al. (2009) normalized the scaled scores for each test in every year over all students in the state who took the test so that each test would have a mean score of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. On this normalized scale, positive scores denote above-average performances relative to the statewide average, and negative scores denote below-average performance. Analysis by Clotfelter et al. (2009) found gaps between four different racial groups: whites, Asians, Hispanics, and blacks.&lt;ref name="Clotfelter, Charles T. 2009"/&gt; Essentially, while the black-white gaps are substantial, both Hispanic and Asian students tend to gain on whites as they progress in school. The white-black achievement gap in math scores is about half a standard deviation, and the white-black achievement gap in reading is a little less than half a standard deviation. By fifth grade, Hispanic and white students have roughly the same math and reading scores. By eighth grade, scores for Hispanic students in North Carolina surpassed those of observationally equivalent whites by roughly a tenth of a standard deviation. Asian students surpass whites on math and reading tests in all years except third and fourth grade reading.&lt;ref name="Clotfelter, Charles T. 2009"/&gt;

====Secondary school====
In a 2006 study, LoGerfo, Nichols, and Reardon (2006) found that, starting in the eighth grade, white students have an initial advantage in reading achievement over black and Hispanic students but not Asian students.&lt;ref name="Logerfo, Laura 2006"&gt;Logerfo, Laura, Austin Nichols, and Sean Reardon. 2006. "Achievement Gains in Elementary and High School." Washington, DC: The Urban Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Using nationally representative data from  by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] (NCES)—the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K) and the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88), LoGerfo, Nichols, and Reardon (2006)  claim that black students score 5.49 points lower than white students and Hispanic students score 4.83 points lower than white students on reading tests. These differences in initial status are compounded by differences in reading gains made during high school. Specifically, between ninth and tenth grades, white students gain slightly more than black students and Hispanic students, but white students gain less than Asian students. Between tenth and twelfth grades, white students gain at a slightly faster rate than black students, but white students gain at a slower rate than Hispanic students and Asian students.&lt;ref name="Logerfo, Laura 2006"/&gt;

In eighth grade, white students also have an initial advantage over black and Hispanic students in math tests.&lt;ref name="Logerfo, Laura 2006"/&gt; However, Asian students have an initial 2.71 point advantage over white students and keep pace with white students throughout high school. Between eighth and tenth grade, black students and Hispanic students make slower gains in math than white students, and black students fall farthest behind. Asian students gain 2.71 points more than white students between eight and tenth grade. Some of these differences in gains persist later in high school. For example, between tenth and twelfth grades, white students gain more than black students, and Asian students gain more than white students. There are no significant differences in math gains between white students and Hispanic students. By the end of high school, gaps between groups increase slightly. Specifically, the initial 9-point advantage of white students over black students increases by about a point, and the initial advantage of Asian students over white students also increases by about a point. Essentially, by the end of high school, Asian students are beginning to learn intermediate-level math concepts, whereas black and Hispanic students are far behind, learning fractions and decimals, which are math concepts that the white and Asian students learned in the eighth grade. Black and Hispanic students end twelfth grade with scores 11 and 7 points behind those of white students, while the male-female difference in math scores is only around 2 points.&lt;ref name="Logerfo, Laura 2006"/&gt;

=== Standardized test scores ===
The racial group differences across admissions tests, such as the [[SAT]], [[ACT (test)|ACT]], [[GRE]], [[GMAT]], [[MCAT]], [[LSAT]], [[Advanced Placement Program]] examinations and other measures of educational achievement, have been fairly consistent. Since the 1960s, the population of students taking these assessments has become increasingly diverse.  Consequently, the examination of ethnic score differences have been more rigorous.&lt;ref name="camara3"&gt;Camara, W.J., &amp; Schmidt, A.E. (1999). Group differences in standardized testing and social stratification (College Board Report No. 99-5). New York: The College Board.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the largest gaps exist between white and African American students. On average, they score about .82 to 1.18 standard deviations lower than white students in composite test scores.&lt;ref&gt;Hedges, L.V., &amp; Nowell, A. (1998). Black-white test score convergence since 1965. In C. Jencks &amp; M. Phillips (Eds.), The black-white test score gap. (149–81). Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution&lt;/ref&gt; Following closely behind is the gap between white and Hispanic students.  Asian American students overall performance were higher than those of White students except Asian American students performed one quarter standard deviation unit lower on the SAT verbal section, and about one half a standard deviation unit higher in the GRE Quantitative test.&lt;ref name="camara3"/&gt;
However, in the new current version of the SAT, [[Asian-American]] students of [[Taiwan|Taiwanese]], [[South Korea|Korean]], [[Japan|Japanese]], [[India|Indian]] and [[Han Chinese]] descent have scored higher on both the verbal and math sections of the new SAT test than whites and all other student racial groups.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/09/27/scores-new-sat-show-large-gaps-race-and-ethnicity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.braingainmag.com/asians-outshine-whites-blacks-hispanics-in-math-writing-sat.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] reports the national Black-White gap and the Hispanic-White Gap in math and reading assessments, measured at the 4th and 8th grade level. The trends show both gaps widen in mathematics as students grow older, but tend to stay the same in reading. Furthermore, the NAEP measures the widening and narrowing of achievement gaps on a state level. From 2007 to 2009, the achievement gaps for the majority of states stayed the same, although more fluctuations were seen at the 8th grade level than the 4th grade level.&lt;ref name="vanneman1"&gt;Alan Vanneman, Linda Hamilton, Janet Baldwin Anderson, Taslima Rahman (2009). Achievement Gaps: How Black and White Students in Public Schools Perform in Mathematics and Reading on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. NCES&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hemphill2"&gt;Hemphill, F., Vanneman, A., Rahman, T. (2011). How Hispanic and White Students in Public Schools Perform in Mathematics and Reading on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. NCES.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black-White Gap demonstrates:&lt;ref name="vanneman1"/&gt;
* In mathematics, a 26-point difference at the 4th grade level and a 31-point difference at the 8th grade level.
* In reading, a 27-point difference at the 4th grade level and a 26-point difference at the 8th grade level.

The Hispanic White Gap demonstrates:&lt;ref name="hemphill2"/&gt;
* In mathematics, a 21-point difference at the 4th grade level and a 26-point difference at the 8th grade level.
* In reading, there is a 25-point difference at the 4th grade level and a 24-point difference at the 8th grade level (NAEP, 2011).

The National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS, 1988) demonstrates similar findings in their evaluation of assessments administered to 12th graders in reading and math.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Leslie A.; and Ingels, Steven J. (2007). Interpreting 12th-Graders' NAEP-Scaled Mathematics Performance Using High School Predictors and Postsecondary Outcomes From the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88)&lt;/ref&gt;

===High school dropout rates===
According to the [[US Department of Education]], event dropout rate is the percentage of high school students who dropped out of high school between the beginning of one school year and the beginning of the next school year.&lt;ref name="Natl. Cent 1997"&gt;Natl. Cent. Educ. Stat. 1997. Digest of Education Statistics. U.S. Dep. Educ.: Off. Educ. Res. Improv.&lt;/ref&gt; Five out of every 100 students enrolled in high school in October 2000 left school before October 2001 without successfully completing a high school program. The percentage of students who were event dropouts decreased from 1972 through 1987. However, despite some year-to-year fluctuations, the percentage of students dropping out of school each year has stayed relatively the same since 1987. Data from the October 2001 [[Current Population Survey]] (CPS) show that black and Hispanic students were more likely to have dropped out of high school between October 2000 and October 2001 than were white or Asians/Pacific Islander students. During this period, 6.3% of black and 8.8% of Hispanic high school students dropped out compared to 4.1% of white and 2.3% of Asian/Pacific Islander high school students.&lt;ref name="Natl. Cent 1997"/&gt;

According to the US Department of Education, status dropout rates measure the percentage of individuals who are not enrolled in high school and who lack a high school credential, independent of when they dropped out.&lt;ref name="Natl. Cent 1997"/&gt; Status rates are higher than event rates because they include all dropouts in this age range, regardless of when they last attended school or whether or not they  ever entered the US education system. In October 2001, about 3.8 million 16- through 24-year-olds were not enrolled in a high school program and had not completed high school. These individuals accounted for 10.7% of the 35.2 million 16- through 24-year-olds in the United States in 2001. In 1972, the white status dropout rate was 40% and the black status dropout rate was 49%. Because the black rate declined more steeply than the white rate, there has been a narrowing of the gap between the dropout rates for blacks and whites. However, this narrowing occurred in the 1980s, and the gap between whites and blacks has remained fairly constant since 1990. The percentage of Hispanics who were status dropouts has remained higher than that of blacks and whites in every year since 1970. Even though Hispanics represented approximately the same percentage of the young adult population as did blacks, Hispanics were disproportionately represented among status dropouts in 2001. Also in 2001, the status dropout rate for Asians/Pacific Islanders ages 16–24 was lower than for any other 16- through 24-year-olds. Specifically, the status rate for Asians/Pacific Islanders was 3.6%, compared with 27.0% for Hispanics, 20.9% for blacks, and 7.3% for whites.&lt;ref name="Natl. Cent 1997"/&gt;

===High school completion rates===
Status completion rates measure the percentage of a given population that has a high school credential, regardless of when the credential was earned.&lt;ref name="Natl. Cent 1997"/&gt; In 2001, 86.5% of 18- through 24-year-olds not enrolled in elementary or secondary school had completed high school. Status completion rates increased from 82.8% in 1972 to 85.6% in 1990. Since 1991, the rate has shown no consistent trend and has fluctuated between 84.8% and 86.5%. High school status completion rates for white and black young adults increased between the early 1970s and 1990 but has remained relatively the same since 1990. Specifically, status completion rates for white students increased from 86.0% in 1972 to 89.6% in 1990. Since 1990, white completion rates have remained in the range of 89.4–91.8%. In 2001, 91.0% of white and 85.6% of black 18- through 24-year-olds had completed high school. The percentage of black students completing high school rose from 72.1% in 1972 to 85.6% in 2001. The gap between black and white completion rates narrowed between 1972 and 2001. In 2001, 65.7% of all Hispanic 18- through 24-year- olds completed high school. This percentage compares to 91.0% of whites, 85.6% of blacks, and 96.1% of Asians/Pacific Islanders. Essentially, in 2001, whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders were more likely than their black and Hispanic peers to have completed high school. Also, whites completed high school at a higher rate than both blacks and Hispanic students. Black students completed high school at a higher rate than Hispanics.&lt;ref name="Natl. Cent 1997"/&gt;

The four-year completion rate is the percentage of 9th-grade students who left school over a subsequent 4-year period while also completing a high school credential.&lt;ref name="Natl. Cent 1997"/&gt; Data for the 4-year completion rate calculations are taken from the Common Core of Data (CCD). The 4-year completion rate calculation is dependent on the availability of dropout estimates over a 4-year span, and current counts of completers. Because dropout rate information was missing for many states during the 4-year period considered by the US Department of Education, 4- year completion rate estimates for the 2000-01 school year are only available for 39 states. Since data were not available from all states, an overall national rate could not be calculated. However, among reporting states, the high school 4-year completion rates for public school students ranged from a high of 90.1% in [[North Dakota]] to a low of 65.0% in [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref name="Natl. Cent 1997"/&gt;

===SAT scores===
Racial and ethnic variations in SAT scores follow a similar pattern to other racial achievement gaps. In 1990, the average SAT was 528 for [[Asian-Americans]], 491 for whites, , 429 for Mexican Americans and 385 for blacks.&lt;ref name="Miller LS 1995"&gt;Miller LS. 1995. An American Imperative: Accelerating Minority Educational Advancement. New Haven: Yale Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt; 34% of Asians compared with 20% of whites, 3% of blacks, 7% of Mexican Americans, and 9% of Native Americans scored above a 600 on the SAT math section.&lt;ref name="Miller LS 1995"/&gt; On the SAT verbal section in 1990, whites scored an average of 442, compared with 410 for Asians, 352 for blacks, 380 for Mexican Americans, and 388 for Native Americans. 
In 2015, the average SAT scores on the math section were 598 for [[Asian-Americans]], 534 for whites, 457 for [[Hispanic]] [[Latinos]] and 428 for blacks.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brookings.edu/research/race-gaps-in-sat-scores-highlight-inequality-and-hinder-upward-mobility/&lt;/ref&gt; 
Additionally, 10% of [[Asian-Americans]], 8% of whites, 3% of Mexican Americans, 3% of Native Americans and 2% of blacks scored above 600 on the SAT verbal section in 1990.&lt;ref name="Miller LS 1995"/&gt;
Race gaps on the SATs are especially pronounced at the tails of the distribution. In a perfectly equal distribution, the racial breakdown of scores at every point in the distribution should ideally mirror the demographic composition of test-takers as whole i.e. 51% whites, 21% Hispanic Latinos, 14% blacks, and 14% [[Asian-American]]s. But ironically, among the highest top scorers, those scoring between a 750 and 800 (perfect scores) over 60% are [[East Asia|East Asians]] of [[Taiwan|Taiwanese]], [[Japan|Japanese]], [[South Korea|Korean]] and [[Han Chinese]] descent, while only 33% are white, compared to 5% Hispanic Latinos and 2% blacks.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brookings.edu/research/race-gaps-in-sat-scores-highlight-inequality-and-hinder-upward-mobility/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some limitations to the data which may mean that, if anything, the race gap is being understated. The ceiling on the SAT score may, for example, understate the achievement and full potential of [[East Asia|East Asians]] of [[Taiwan|Taiwanese]], [[Japan|Japanese]], [[South Korea|Korean]] and [[Han Chinese]] descent. If the exam was redesigned to increase score variance (add harder and easier questions than it currently has), the achievement gap across racial groups could be even more wider and pronounced. In other words, if the math section was scored between 0 and 1000, we might see more complete tails on both the right and the left. More [[East Asian|East Asians]] score between 750 and 800 than score between 700 and 750, suggesting that many [[East Asian|East Asians]] of [[Taiwan|Taiwanese]], [[Japan|Japanese]], [[South Korea|Korean]] and [[Han Chinese]] descent could be scoring high above 800 if the test allowed them to.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brookings.edu/research/race-gaps-in-sat-scores-highlight-inequality-and-hinder-upward-mobility/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== College enrollment and graduation rates ===
The US Department in Education demonstrates performance of different ethnic groups in colleges and universities. Specifically, they found that about 72% of White students who have completed high school enrolled in college the same year, compared to 44% for Black students, and 50% for Hispanic students.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics. (2011). The Condition of Education 2011 (NCES 2011-033), Indicator 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, trends in undergraduate and graduate enrollment have shown increases in all ethnicity groups, but the largest gap still exists for Black student enrollment. Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islanders student enrollment have experienced the most growth since 1976.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics. (2011). Digest of Education Statistics, 2010 (NCES 2011-015), Chapter 3 .&lt;/ref&gt; The 6-year national college graduation rate is 59% for White students, 51% for Hispanic students, 46% for Black females, and 35% for Black males.&lt;ref&gt;House, G. (2011). Transforming America's High Schools. Strategies for Creating and Sustaining Meaningful Reform. http://www.ncchamber.net/docs/pdfs/EDUsummit_DrHouse.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, even at prestigious institutions, the graduation rate of white students is higher than that of black student.&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education. Black Student College Graduation Rates Remain Low, But Modest Progress Begins to Show. http://www.jbhe.com/features/50_blackstudent_gradrates.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term trends===
The [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] (NAEP) has been testing seventeen-year-olds since 1971. From 1971 to 1996, the black-white reading gap shrank by almost one half and the math gap by almost one third.&lt;ref name="Jencks C 1998"&gt;Jencks C, Phillips M. 1998. The black-white test score gap: an introduction. In The Black- White Test Score Gap: an Introduction, ed. C Jencks, M Phillips. Washington, DC: Brookings Institution&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, blacks scored an average of 239 points, and whites scored an average of 291 points on the NAEP reading tests in 1971. In 1990, blacks scored an average of 267, and whites scored an average of 297 points. On NAEP math tests in 1973, blacks scored an average of 270, and whites scored 310. In 1990, black average score was 289 and whites scored an average of 310 points. For Hispanics, the average NAEP math score for seventeen-year-olds in 1973 was 277 and 310 for whites. In 1990, the average score among Hispanics was 284 compared with 310 for whites.&lt;ref name="Miller LS 1995"/&gt;

Because of small population size in the 1970s, similar trend data are not available for Asian Americans. Data from the 1990 NAEP Mathematics Assessment Tests show that among twelfth graders, Asians scored an average of 315 points compared with 301 points for whites, 270 for blacks, 278 for Hispanics, and 290 for Native Americans.&lt;ref name="Jencks C 1998"/&gt; Racial and ethnic differentiation is most apparent at the highest achievement levels. Specifically, 13% of Asians performed at level of 350 points or higher, 6% of whites, less than 1% of blacks, and 1% of Hispanics did so.&lt;ref name="Jencks C 1998"/&gt;

The NAEP has since collected and analyzed data through 2008. Overall, the White-Hispanic and the White-Black gap for NAEP scores have significantly decreased since the 1970s.&lt;ref name="nation4"&gt;The Nation's Report Card. 2008 Long Term Trend Report Card. http://nationsreportcard.gov/ltt_2008/ltt0001.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
The Black-White Gap demonstrates:&lt;ref name="nation4"/&gt;
* In mathematics, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 14 points from 1973 to 2008.
* In reading, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 24 points from 1971 to 2008.
The Hispanic-White Gap demonstrates:&lt;ref name="nation4"/&gt;
* In mathematics, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 12 points from 1973 to 2008.
* In reading, the gap for 17-year-olds was narrowed by 15 points from 1975 to 2008.

Furthermore, subgroups showed predominant gains in 4th grade at all achievement levels. In terms of achieving proficiency, gaps between subgroups in most states have narrowed across grade levels, yet had widened in 23% of instances. The progress made in elementary and middle schools was greater than that in high schools, which demonstrates the importance of early childhood education. Greater gains were seen in lower-performing subgroups rather than in higher-performing subgroups. Similarly, greater gains were seen in Latino and African American subgroups than for low-income and Native American subgroups.&lt;ref&gt;Chudowsky &amp; Kober. (2007). Are Achievement Gaps Closing and Is Achievement Rising for All? Center on Education Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Income ===
Research that was conducted shows that income is a factor that affects the racial achievement gap. Black and Hispanic students tend to come from low-income communities and they also tend to be behind white students in terms of math and reading scores. Another piece of evidence is that when you compare the gap between white and minority students with similar family economic backgrounds, the achievement gap results are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuhfeld|first=Megan|last2=Gershoff|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Paschall|first3=Katherine|date=July 2018|title=The development of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic achievement gaps during the school years|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appdev.2018.07.001|journal=Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology|volume=57|pages=62–73|doi=10.1016/j.appdev.2018.07.001|issn=0193-3973}}&lt;/ref&gt;Katherine Paschall is a researcher who believes that family income plays more of a factor in the academic achievement gap than race/ethnicity. This is due to the fact that even within racial groups, there are differences in economic statuses. Family income was able to explain most of the evidence that was shown. &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paschall|first=Katherine W.|last2=Gershoff|first2=Elizabeth T.|last3=Kuhfeld|first3=Megan|date=2018-01-08|title=A Two Decade Examination of Historical Race/Ethnicity Disparities in Academic Achievement by Poverty Status|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10964-017-0800-7|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|language=en|volume=47|issue=6|pages=1164–1177|doi=10.1007/s10964-017-0800-7|issn=0047-2891}}&lt;/ref&gt;Katherine Paschall conducted research to see if the achievement gap is due to a combination of race/ethnicity and income rather than just race/ethnicity by itself. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;Paschall discuses how important it is to look at both race/ethnicity and poverty status together. Since there is already research on both factors separately, it is important to look at the intersection between them in order to further understand the achievement gap. Paschall believes that these findings are important in the development of educational policies that try to reduce the achievement gaps.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Theories about the origin of the racial achievement gap==
{{further|Achievement gap in the United States#Debate on the origins of the racial achievement gap}}
The achievement gap between low-income minority students and middle-income White students has been a popular research topic among sociologists since the publication of the report, "Equality of Educational Opportunity" (more widely known as the [[Coleman Report#Coleman Report|Coleman Report]]). This report was commissioned by the U.S. Department of Education in 1966 to investigate whether the performance of African-American students was caused by their attending schools of a lesser quality than white students. The report suggested that both in-school factors and home/community factors affect the academic achievement of students and contribute to the achievement gap that exists between races.&lt;ref name="rothstein5"&gt;Rothstein, Richard. 2004. Class and Schools: Using Social, Economic, and Educational Reform to Close the Black-White Achievement Gap. Washington, D.C: Economic Policy Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of the achievement gap can be addressed from two standpoints—from a supply-side and a demand-side viewpoint of education. In [[Poor Economics]], Banerjee and Duflo explain the two families of arguments surrounding education of underserved populations.&lt;ref&gt;Banerjee, A., Banerjee, A. V., &amp; Duflo, E. (2011). Poor economics: A radical rethinking of the way to fight global poverty. PublicAffairs Store.&lt;/ref&gt; Demand-side arguments focus on aspects of minority populations that influence education achievement. These include family background and culture, which shape perceptions and expectations surrounding education. A large body of research has been dedicated to studying these factors contributing to the achievement gap. Supply-side arguments focus on the provision of education and resources and the systemic structures in place that perpetuate the achievement gap. These include neighborhoods, funding, and policy. In 2006, Ladson-Billings called on education researchers to move the spotlight of education research from family background to take into account the rest of the factors that affect educational achievement, as explained by the Coleman Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ladson-Billings |first=G. |year=2006 |title=From the achievement gap to the education debt: Understanding achievement in US schools |journal=Educational Researcher |volume=35 |issue=7 |pages=3–12 |doi=10.3102/0013189X035007003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of opportunity gaps—rather than achievement gaps—has changed the paradigm of education research to assess education from a top-down approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Milner |first=H. R. |year=2012 |title=Beyond a Test Score Explaining Opportunity Gaps in Educational Practice |journal=Journal of Black Studies |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=693–718 |doi=10.1177/0021934712442539 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-Cognitive Factors ===
==== Social Belonging ====
A person’s sense of social belonging is one non-cognitive factor that plays a part in the racial achievement gap. Some of the processes that threaten a person’s sense of belonging in schools include social stigma, negative intellectual stereotypes, and numeric under-representation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Walton, G. M., &amp; Cohen, G. L. (2011). Sharing motivation. In D. Dunning (Ed.), ''Frontiers of social psychology. Social motivation'' (pp. 79-101). New York, NY, US: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walton and Cohen describe three ways in which a sense of social belonging boosts motivation, the first being positive self-image. By adopting similar interests as those who a person considers to be socially significant, it may help to increase or affirm a person’s sense of his or her personal worth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; People have a basic need to belong, which is why people may feel a sense of distress when social rejection occurs. Students in minority groups have to battle other factors as well, such as peer and friend groups being separated by race. Homogeneous friend groups can segregate people out of important networking connections, thus limiting important future opportunities that non-minority groups have because they have access to these networking connections.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Whistling Vivaldi: And Other Clues to How Stereotypes Affect Us|last=Steele|first=Claude|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company.|year=2011|isbn=978-0393339727|location=New York|pages=1–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who do not fall into the majority or dominant group in their schools often worry about whether or not they will belong and find a valued place in their school. Their thoughts are often centered around whether they will be accepted and valued for who they are around their peers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Social rejection can cause reductions in IQ test performance, self-regulation, and also can prompt aggression.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; People can do more together than they can alone. Social life is a form of collaborative activity, and an important feature of human life. When goals and objectives become shared, they offer a person and the social units he or she is a part of major advantages over if he or she was working alone.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Under performing groups in schools often report that they feel like they do not belong and that they are unhappy a majority of the time. Steele offers an example, explaining an observation done by his colleague, Treisman. It was observed that African American students at Berkeley did their work independently in their rooms with nobody to converse with. They spent most of their time checking answers to their arithmetic in the back of their textbook, weakening their grasp of the concepts themselves. This ultimately caused these students to do worse on tests and assessments than their white peers, creating a frustrating experience and also contributing to the racial achievement gap.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===== Purpose =====
When students feel that what they are doing has purpose, they are more likely to succeed academically. Students who identify and actively work towards their individual, purposeful, life goals have a better chance at eliminating disengagement that commonly occurs in middle school and continues into later adolescence.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David Yeager|first=Matthew Bundick|date=May 2009|title=The Role of Purposeful Work Goals in Promoting Meaning in Life and in Schoolwork in Adolescence|url=|journal=Journal of Adolescent Research|volume=24|pages=423–449|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These life goals give students a chance to believe that their school work is done in hopes of achieving larger, more long-term goals that matter to the world. This also gives students the opportunity to feel that their lives have meaning by working towards these goals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Purposeful life goals, such as work goals, may also increase students motivation to learn. Adolescents may make connections between what they are learning in school and how they will use those skills and knowledge will help them make an impact in the future. This idea ultimately will lead students to create their own goals related to mastering the material they are learning in school.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Adolescents who have goals, and believe that their opinions and voices can impact the world positively, they may become more motivated. They become more committed to mastering concepts and being accountable for their own learning, rather than focusing on getting the highest grade in the class.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Students will study more intently and deeply, as well as persist longer, seeking out more challenges. They will like learning more because the tasks they are doing have purpose, creating a personal meaning to them and in turn leading to satisfaction.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

====== Mindset ======
Students’ mindsets (how they perceive their abilities) play a large role in their achievement and also their motivation. An adolescent's level of self-efficacy is a great predictor of their level of academic performance, going above and beyond a student's measured level of ability and also their prior performance in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Academic Tenacity: Mindsets and Skills that Promote Long-Term Learning|last=Dweck|first=Carol|publisher=Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=1–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students having a growth mindset believe that their intelligence can be developed over time. Those with a fixed mindset believe that their intelligence is fixed and cannot grow and develop. Students with growth mindsets tend to outperform their peers who have fixed mindsets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/09/23/carol-dweck-revisits-the-growth-mindset.html|title=Carol Dweck Revisits "The Growth Mindset"|last=Dweck|first=Carol|date=September 22, 2015|work=Education Week|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students are highly influenced by their teachers in which kind of mindset they develop in school. When people are taught with a growth mindset, the ideas of challenging themselves and putting in more effort follow.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mindset: A New Psychology of Success|last=Dweck|first=Carol|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=1–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; People believe that each mindset is better than the other, which causes students to feel that they are not as good as other students in school. A big question that is asked in schooling is when does someone feel smart: when they are flawless or when they are learning? &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With a fixed mindset, you must be flawless, and not just smart in the classroom. With this mindset, there is even more pressure on students to not only succeed, but to be flawless in front of their peers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Students who have a fixed mindset, have come to change the idea of failure as an action to an identity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They come to think of the idea of failing something as being that they are a failure and that they cannot achieve something. This links back into how they think of themselves as a person and decreases their motivation in school. This sense of "failure" is especially prominent during adolescence. If one thing goes wrong, one with a fixed mindset will feel that they cannot overcome this small failure, and thus their mindset motivation will decrease.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Education Debt ===
Education debt is a theory developed by [[Gloria Ladson-Billings]], a pedagogical theorist.  In her theory of education debt, she likens the focus of the achievement gap to the United States current focus on the national deficit. She argues that instead the true issue is debt rather than deficit: an education debt to African Americans, Native Americans, and Latino/as.  As defined by a colleague of Ladson-Billings, Professor Emeritus Robert Haveman, education debt is the “foregone schooling resources that we could have (should have) been investing in (primarily) low income kids, which deficit leads to a variety of social problems (e.g. crime, low productivity, low wages, low labor force participation) that require on-going public investment”.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ladson-Billings|first=Gloria|date=|title=From the Achievement Gap to Education Debt: Understanding Achievement in U.S. Schools|url=https://www.jstor.org/tc/accept?origin=%2Fstable%2Fpdf%2F3876731.pdf|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=|pages=3-12|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The education debt has historical, economic, sociopolitical and moral components; the structure of the education debt theory makes is a logical cause of the racial achievement gap.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;    

==== Historical Component ====
Historical debt is the concept of inequality throughout history that has prevented equal education of minorities.  Inequities surrounding education throughout history have been designed to prevent people based on their race, class, and gender from receiving quality education.  Disparity in achievement is a result of legislation that has prevented education of minorities, specifically African Americans.  After the abolishment of slavery, African Americans were subject to follow the laws of their bitter oppressors.  This left African Americans with little to no representation.  It was prohibited by law in many places across the United States, specifically the south, for African Americans to attend school. This is an early example in history of education being denied to African Americans.  Similarly, the Native American population was prevented from obtaining a quality education.  After forced labor and genocides, the remaining population was funneled into boarding schools focused on religious teachings and assimilation into European culture.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Native Americans had little to no representation. Latino/as were also denied equal education.  In the case [[Mendez v. Westminster|Mendez vs. West Minister]], Latino fathers challenged the courts as their children, and thousands of others, were victims of racial segregation. Historically, much of the inequalities embedded within legislation was perpetuated by leaders of the country.  The falsity that African Americans were unable to be educated was endorsed by Thomas Jefferson, even though he supported the idea of education for all American people.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Historic events and legislation are both related to economic debt, in the fact that they both affected the education opportunities of minorities. 

==== Economic Component ====
Economic debt has greatly accumulated from the disparities in school funding.  Even after it was deemed unconstitutional for education to be withheld on the basis of race, legislation regarding the allocation of money for public schools was passed regardless of the fact that it left minority school districts with significantly less money than districts of White counterparts.  The concept of separate but equal, made constitutional by [[Plessy v. Ferguson|Plessy vs. Ferguson]], allowed a significant of amount of funding disparity to be perpetuated.  Although, Plessy vs. Ferguson was overturned, the segregation it caused can still be observed today.  Statistics show that Chicago public school spend spend roughly $8,000 a year per child; the population of Chicago public school students is 87% African American and Latino/a. Highland Park school district spends more than double the amount of the Chicago public school district; Highland Park (a neighboring town) public schools has a population of 91% White students.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  It is important to consider an affect of economic debt; earning ratios. Gloria Ladson-Billings points to the relation of level of schoolings and earning ratios. Higher level of income is related to a higher level of education data suggests&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.    

==== Sociopolitical Component ====
Sociopolitical debt “is the degree to which communities of color are excluded from the civic process” (Landson-Billings 2006).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The civic process includes refers to the engagement of conversation or activity that addresses issues or concerns within society. Disenfranchisement of voting rights contributed to and continues to contribute to sociopolitical debt.  With little to no access to franchise, African American, Latino/a, and Native American communities received no representation or legislation that reflected their issues and concerns.  These groups were often excluded from legislation and conversation concerning education which did not allow them to advocate for the equal education. An example of the mitigation of sociopolitical debt is the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].  This piece of legislation ensured a voice to minorities within the political sphere.  No such legislation has been passed that focuses on diminishing education inequalities. [[Affirmative action]] is the closest legislation that has had a strong impact.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Although affirmative action benefited White women the most, observations show that the emergence of the Black middle class was aided by the policy (Bowen and Bok 1999). Members of the Black middle class  and other minority groups continue to fight for change in education despite being silenced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woodruff|first=Darren|date=1999|title=Review of The Shape of the River: Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions by William G. Bowen and Derek Bok|url=www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2668215.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A564a067c1851976d0a95e25ce7a7b601|journal=Journal of Negro Education|volume=|pages=122-124|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The sociopolitical debt has limited access to resources such as policy makers and law experts; disadvantages as these do not allow for the gain of political capital needed to enact change. 

==== Moral Component ====
Moral debt is the final component of the education debt and “reflects disparity between what we know is right and what we actually do” (Ladson-Billings)&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. Moral debt is expressed as the lack of honor given when honor is due.  There is no hesitation in giving honor to Martin Luther King Jr. or Rosa Parks. Another example of repaying moral debt are the reparations placed on Germany after WWII.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Debate is happening on the basis of moral debt, reparations and success but much of the debate focuses on the individual and the responsibility of the individual to ensure success.  “No nation can enslave a race of people for hundreds of years, set them free bedraggled and penniless, pit them, without assistance in a hostile environment, against privileged victimizers, and then reasonably expect the gap between the heirs of the two groups to narrow. Lines, begun parallel and left alone, can never touch.” Randall Robinson states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The debt: What America owes to Blacks|last=Robinson|first=Randall|publisher=Dutton Books|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Individual responsibility becomes an unrealistic expectation when a group has been exploited, disenfranchised and oppressed for centuries.  

===Demand-side===

====Family structure/parenting style====
Children can differ in their readiness to learn before they enter school.&lt;ref name="rothstein5"/&gt; Research has shown that parental involvement in a child's development has a significant effect on the educational achievement of minority children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jeynes |first=W. H. |year=2003 |title=A meta-analysis the effects of parental involvement on minority children's academic achievement |journal=Education and Urban Society |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=202–218 |doi=10.1177/0013124502239392 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociologist [[Annette Lareau]], differences in [[parenting styles]] can affect a child's future achievement. In her book ''[[Unequal Childhoods]]'', she argues that there are two main types of parenting: concerted cultivation and the achievement of natural growth.

* [[Concerted cultivation]] is usually practiced by middle-class parents, regardless of their race. These parents are more likely to be involved in their children's education, encourage their children's participation in extracurricular activities or sports teams, and to teach their children how to successfully communicate with authority figures. These communication skills give children a form of social capital that help them communicate their needs and negotiate with adults throughout their life.
* The achievement of natural growth is generally practiced by poor and working-class families. These parents generally do not play as large a role in their children's education, their children are less likely to participate in extracurriculars or sports teams, and they usually do not teach their children the communication skills that middle- and upper-class children have. Instead, these parents are more concerned that their children obey authority figures and have respect for authority, which are two characteristics that are important to have in order to succeed in working-class jobs.&lt;ref name="lareau6"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lareau |first=Annette |year=2003 |title=Unequal Childhoods: Class, Race, and Family Life |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-23763-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parenting practices that a child is raised with influences their future educational achievement. However, parenting styles are heavily influenced by the parents' and family's social, economic, and physical circumstances. In particular, immigration status (if applicable), education level, incomes, and occupations influence the degree of parental involvement their children's academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kao |first=G. |last2=Thompson |first2=J. |year=2003 |title=Racial and ethnic stratification in educational achievement and attainment |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=29 |issue= |pages=417–442 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These factors directly determine the access of the parents to time and resources to dedicate to their children's development. These factors also indirectly determine the home environment and parents' educational expectations of their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davis-Kean |first=P.

Additionally, parents of children living in poverty are less likely to have cognitively stimulating materials in the home for their children and are less likely to be involved in their child's school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cooper |first=C.

In the United States, most minority groups are more likely to live in poverty than White Americans. Unemployment rate and mortgages for African and Latin Americans are usually higher than White Americans'. And although Asian American families earn, on average, more income than White American families do, there are usually more family members working in the Asian American family than the White American family.&lt;ref name = "bcqnguyen3"&gt;{{cite web |author=American Psychological Association |title=Ethnic and Minorities &amp; Socioeconomic Status |others=Fact sheet |url=https://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/factsheet-erm.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt; These disparities in socioeconomic status between minority groups and White Americans help explain differences in parenting styles, family structure, and the resultant educational achievement of minority children. However, the racial gaps persists when comparing families with similar income. Whites from families with incomes below $10,000 had a mean SAT test score that was 61 points higher than blacks whose families had incomes of between $80,000 and $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Blacks in Higher Education |url=http://www.jbhe.com/features/49_college_admissions-test.html |title=The Widening Racial Scoring Gap on the SAT College Admissions Test }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====African-American family structure=====
{{Main|African-American family structure}}

In 2010, 72% of Black babies were born to unwed mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jesse |last=Washington |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39993685/ns/health-womens_health/t/blacks-struggle-percent-unwed-mothers-rate/ |title=Blacks struggle with 72 percent unwed mothers rate |date=7 November 2010 |work=[[NBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204712904578090483678801780 |title=For Blacks, the Pyrrhic Victory of the Obama Era |first=Jason L. |last=Riley |date=November 4, 2012 |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is consensus in the literature about the negative consequences of growing up in single-parent homes on educational attainment and success.&lt;ref name="Heiss"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heiss |first=J. |year=1996 |title=Effects of African American family structure on school attitudes and performance |journal=[[Social Problems]] |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=246–267 |doi=10.2307/3096977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children growing up in single-parent homes are more likely to not finish school and generally obtain less years of schooling than those in two-parent homes.&lt;ref name="Heiss"/&gt; Specifically, boys growing in homes with only their mothers are more likely to receive poorer grades and display behavioral problems.&lt;ref name="Heiss"/&gt;

For black high school students, the African American family structure does affect their educational goals and expectations also.&lt;ref name="Heiss"/&gt; Studies on the topic have indicated that children growing up in single-parent homes faces disturbances in young childhood, adolescence and young adulthood as well.&lt;ref name="Heiss"/&gt; Although these effects are sometimes minimal and contradictory, it is generally agreed that the family structure a child grows up in is important for their success in the educational sphere.&lt;ref name="Heiss"/&gt;

The black family structure is seen as a source of low student achievement because it is seen as a family structure that creates a “culture of poverty”.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiggan|first=Greg|date=September 2007|title=Race, School Achievement, and Educational Inequality: Toward a Student-Based Inquiry Perspective|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.3102%2F003465430303947|journal=Review of Educational Research|language=en|volume=77|issue=3|pages=310–333|doi=10.3102/003465430303947|issn=0034-6543}}&lt;/ref&gt;Research has found that student’s that come from “culture of poverty” tend to be low achievers due to them already being at a disadvantage, making it hard for them to be high achievers. &lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

====Cultural differences====
Some experts believe that cultural factors contribute to the racial achievement gap. Students from minority cultures face language barriers, differences in cultural norms in interactions, learning styles, varying levels of receptiveness of their culture to White American culture, and varying levels of acceptance of the White American culture by the students. In particular, it has been found that minority students from cultures with views that generally do not align with the mainstream cultural views have a harder time in school.&lt;ref name="ogbu92"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ogbu |first=J. U. |year=1992 |title=Understanding cultural diversity and learning |journal=Educational Researcher |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=5–14 |doi=10.3102/0013189x021008005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, views of the value of education differ by minority groups as well as members within each group. Both Hispanic and African-American youths often receive mixed messages about the importance of education, and often end up performing below their academic potential.&lt;ref name="noguera08"&gt;{{cite book |last=Noguera |first=Pedro A. |year=2008 |title=The Trouble with Black Boys |location=San Francisco |publisher=Jossey Bass |isbn=978-0-7879-8874-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Latino American=====
Many Hispanic parents who immigrate to The United States see a high school diploma as being a sufficient amount of schooling and may not stress the importance of continuing on to college. Parental discouragement from pursuing higher education tends to be based on the notion of "we made it without formal schooling, so you can too". Additionally, depending on the immigration generation and economic status of the student, some students prioritize their obligations to assisting their family over their educational aspirations. Poor economic circumstances place greater pressure on the students to sacrifice time spent working towards educational attainment in order to dedicate more time to help support the family. Surveys have shown that while Latino American families would like their children to have a formal education, they also place high value on getting jobs, marrying, and having children as early as possible, all of which conflict with the goal of educational achievement.&lt;ref name = "bcqnguyen2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Orozco |first=C. S. |last2=Orozco |first2=M. M. S. |year=1995 |title=Trans-formations: Immigration, family life, and achievement motivation among Latino adolescents |location= |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=0-8047-2550-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fuligni |first=A. J. |last2=Tseng |first2=V. |last3=Lam |first3=M. |year=1999 |title=Attitudes toward family obligations among American adolescents with Asian, Latin American, and European backgrounds |journal=Child Development |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=1030–1044 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00075 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, counselors and teachers usually promote continuing on to college. This message conflicts with the one being sent to Hispanic students by their families and can negatively affect the motivation of Hispanic students, as evidenced by the fact that Latinos have the lowest college attendance rates of any racial/ethnic group.&lt;ref name="noguera08"/&gt; Overall, Latino American students face barriers such as financial stability and insufficient support for higher education within their families. Reading to children when they are younger increases literacy comprehension, which is a fundamental concept in the education system; however, it is less likely to occur within Latino American families because many parents do not have any formal education. Currently, Latino Americans over the age of 25 have the lowest percentage in obtaining a bachelor's degree or higher amongst all other racial groups; while only having 11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tienda|first=Marta|title=The National Academies|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19909/|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====African American=====
African American students are also likely to receive different messages about the importance of education from their peer group and from their parents. Many young African-Americans are told by their parents to concentrate on school and do well academically, which is similar to the message that many middle-class white students receive. However, the peers of African-American students are more likely to place less emphasis on education, sometimes accusing studious African-American students of "[[acting white]]." This causes problems for black students who want to pursue higher levels of education, forcing some to hide their study or homework habits from their peers and perform below their academic potential.&lt;ref name="noguera08"/&gt;

=====Asian American=====
Asian American students are more likely to view education as a means to social mobility, as they believe it provides a means to overcome language barriers as well as discrimination. This notion comes from parental expectations of their children, which are rooted in the cultural belief that hard work is the key to educational and eventually occupational attainment. Many Asian Americans immigrated to the United States voluntarily, in search for better opportunities. This immigration status comes into play when assessing the cultural views of Asian Americans since attitudes of more recent immigration are associated with optimistic views about the correlation between hard work and success. Obstacles such as language barriers and acceptance of White American culture are more easily overcome by voluntary immigrants since their expectations of attaining better opportunities in the United States influence their interactions and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goyette |first=K. |last2=Xie |first2=Y. |year=1999 |title=Educational expectations of Asian American youths: Determinants and ethnic differences |journal=[[Sociology of Education (journal)|Sociology of Education]] |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=22–36 |doi=10.2307/2673184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Geographic and neighborhood factors====
The quality of school that a student attends and the socioeconomic status of the student's residential neighborhood are two factors that can affect a student's academic performance.

In the United States, the financing of most public schools is based on local property taxes&lt;ref name="massey7"&gt;{{cite book |last=Massey |first=Douglas S. |year=2004 |chapter=The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America |editor-first=C. Michael |editor-last=Henry |title=Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-09541-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system means that schools located in areas with lower real estate values have proportionately less money to spend per pupil than schools located in areas with higher real estate values. This system has also maintained a "funding segregation:" because minority students are much more likely to live in a neighborhood with lower property values, they are much more likely to attend a school that receives significantly lower funding.&lt;ref name="massey7"/&gt; 

Data from research shows that when the quality of the school is better and students are given more resources, it affects the racial achievement gap by reducing it. When white and black schools were given the equal amount of resources, it shows that black students started improving while white students stayed the same because they didn’t need the resources. This showed that lack of resources is a factor in the racial achievement gap. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jaekyung|date=January 2002|title=Racial and Ethnic Achievement Gap Trends: Reversing the Progress Toward Equity?|url=https://doi.org/10.3102/0013189X031001003|journal=Educational Researcher|language=en|volume=31|issue=1|pages=3–12|doi=10.3102/0013189x031001003|issn=0013-189X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research that was conducted shows that predominantly white schools have more resources than black schools. However, lack of resources is only a small effect on academic achievement in comparison to students’ family backgrounds. &lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiggan|first=Greg|date=September 2007|title=Race, School Achievement, and Educational Inequality: Toward a Student-Based Inquiry Perspective|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.3102%2F003465430303947|journal=Review of Educational Research|language=en|volume=77|issue=3|pages=310–333|doi=10.3102/003465430303947|issn=0034-6543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using property taxes to fund public schools contributes to school inequality. Lower-funded schools are more likely to have (1) lower-paid teachers; (2) higher student-teacher ratios, meaning less individual attention for each student; (3) older books; (4) fewer extracurricular activities, which have been shown to increase academic achievement; (5) poorly maintained school buildings and grounds; and (6) less access to services like school nursing and social workers. All of these factors can affect student performance and perpetuate inequalities between students of different races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kozol |first=J. |year=2005 |title=Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America |location=New York |publisher=Crown |isbn=1-4000-5244-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Living in a high-poverty or disadvantaged neighborhood have been shown to negatively influence educational aspirations and consequently attainment. The [[Moving to Opportunity]] experiment showed that moving to a low-poverty neighborhood had a positive effect on the educational attainment of minority adolescents. The school characteristics associated with the low-poverty neighborhoods proved to be effective mediators, since low-poverty neighborhoods tended to have more favorable school composition, safety, and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leventhal |first=T. |last2=Brooks-Gunn |first2=J. |year=2004 |title=A randomized study of neighborhood effects on low-income children's educational outcomes |journal=[[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=488–507 |pmid=15238038 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.4.488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, living in a neighborhood with economic and social inequalities leads to negative attitudes and more problematic behavior due to and social tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sampson |first=R.

However, other researchers believe that the idea of vouchers promotes equality and doesn’t eliminate it. &lt;ref name=":06"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiggan|first=Greg|date=September 2007|title=Race, School Achievement, and Educational Inequality: Toward a Student-Based Inquiry Perspective|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.3102%2F003465430303947|journal=Review of Educational Research|language=en|volume=77|issue=3|pages=310–333|doi=10.3102/003465430303947|issn=0034-6543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial and ethnic [[residential segregation]] in the United States still persists, with African Americans experiencing the highest degree of residential segregation, followed by Latino Americans and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=U. S. Census Bureau |year=2002 |title=Racial and Ethnic Residential Segregation United States: 1980–2000 |accessdate=October 20, 2013 |url=https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/housing_patterns/papertoc.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; This isolation from White American communities is highly correlated with low property values and high-poverty neighborhoods. This issue is propagated by issues of home ownership facing minorities, especially African Americans and Latino Americans, since residential areas predominantly populated by these minority groups are perceived as less attractive in the housing market. Home ownership by minority groups is further undermined by institutionalized discriminatory practices, such as differential treatment of African Americans and Latino Americans in the housing market compared with White Americans. Higher mortgages charged to African American or Latino American buyers make it more difficult for members of these minority groups to attain full home ownership and accumulate wealth. As a result, African American and Latino American groups continue to live in racially segregated neighborhoods and face the socioeconomic consequences of residential segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Charles |first=C. Z. |year=2003 |title=The dynamics of racial residential segregation |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=29 |issue= |pages=167–207 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krivo |first=L.

Differences in the academic performance of African-American and White students exist even in schools that are desegregated and diverse, and studies have shown that a school's racial mix does not seem to have much effect on changes in reading scores after sixth grade, or on math scores at any age.&lt;ref name="singham11"&gt;{{cite book |last=Singham |first=Mano |year=2005 |title=The Achievement Gap in U.S. Education: Canaries in the Mine |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield Education |isbn=1-57886-217-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, minority students in segregated-minority schools have more optimism and greater educational aspirations as well as achievements than minority students in segregated-white schools. This can be attributed to various factors, including the attitudes of faculty and staff at segregated-white schools and the effect of stereotype threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldsmith |first=P. A. |year=2004 |title=Schools' racial mix, students' optimism, and the Black-White and Latino-White achievement gaps |journal=Sociology of Education |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=121–147 |doi=10.1177/003804070407700202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
The minority status of a student plays a major role in the minority experience of schooling. Non-White minority groups are classified into voluntary and involuntary minority groups, which are differentiated by the reasons that brought the groups to the United States. Voluntary minorities are immigrants who came to the United States for better social, economic, and political opportunities, such as the Chinese and Punjabi Indians. Optimism regarding educational and occupational prospects are reflected in parents' expectations of their children. It should be noted, however, that earlier generations of students from voluntary minority groups tend to perform better and place a higher value on education than native-born and later-generation students of the same group.&lt;ref&gt;Kao, G., &amp; Tienda, M. (1995). Optimism and achievement: The educational performance of immigrant youth. ''Social science quarterly'', 76, 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Involuntary minorities are those from groups who came to the United States or integrated into the United States against their will, such as Native Americans or African Americans. Involuntary minority groups face both external and internal tensions;  institutionalized socioeconomic factors prevent social mobility for these groups, in addition to the identity-related conflicts within a minority culture. These ethnic histories thus define the social status of minority groups and thereby influence the schooling experience of minority students.{{Citation needed|reason=The sentences regarding &amp;quot;involuntary minorities&amp;quot; make several factual claims without citing any sources. The &amp;quot;Social science quarterly&amp;quot; citation only refers to so-called &amp;quot;voluntary minorities&amp;quot;|date=February 2017}}

=====Legacy of discrimination argument=====
An argument has been put that the [[Racial income gap|disparity in income]] that exists between African Americans and Whites directly contributes to the racial achievement gap. This school of thought argues that the origin of this "wealth gap" is the slavery and racism that made it extremely difficult for African-Americans to accumulate wealth for almost 100 years. A comparable history of discrimination created a similar gap between Hispanics and whites. This results in many minority children being born into low socioeconomic backgrounds, which in turn affects educational opportunities.&lt;ref name="singham11"/&gt;

Research has shown time and again that the wealth and income of parents is a primary factor influencing student achievement {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}. A low socioeconomic background can have negative effects on a child's educational achievement before even starting school; indeed, research has shown that the achievement gap is present between races before starting formal education. On average, when entering kindergarten, African-American students are one year behind White students in terms of vocabulary and basic math skills, and this gap continues to grow as a child's education continues.&lt;ref name="espenshade9"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Espenshade | first1 = Thomas J. | last2 = Walton Radford | first2 = Alexandria | title = No longer separate, not yet equal: race and class in elite college admission and campus life | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780691141602 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Refugees=====
Part of the racial achievement gap can be attributed to the experience of the refugee population in the United States. Refugee groups in particular face obstacles such as cultural and language barriers and discrimination, in addition to premigration stresses. These factors affect how successfully refugee children can assimilate to and succeed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McBrien |first=J. L. |year=2005 |title=Educational Needs and Barriers for Refugee Students in the United States: A Review of the Literature |journal=Review of Educational Research |volume=75 |issue=3 |pages=329–364 |doi=10.3102/00346543075003329 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it has been shown that immigrant children from politically unstable countries do not perform as well as immigrant children from politically stable countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levels |first=M. |last2=Dronkers |first2=J. |last3=Kraaykamp |first3=G. |year=2008 |title=Immigrant children's educational achievement in western countries: origin, destination, and community effects on mathematical performance |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=73 |issue=5 |pages=835–853 |doi=10.1177/000312240807300507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetic differences ===
[[J. Philippe Rushton]] and [[Arthur Jensen]] suggested that the results of [[Intelligence quotient|intelligence testing]] demonstrate that genetic differences can explain some or all of the racial achievement gap in American education.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rushton |first=J. Philippe |last2=Jensen |first2=Arthur R. |title=Thirty Years of Research on Race Differences in Cognitive Ability |journal=Psychology, Public Policy, and Law |volume=11 |issue=2 |year=2005 |pages=235–294  |doi=10.1037/1076-8971.11.2.235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Sternberg]] later published a reply to Rushton and Jensen in which he wrote critically of their approach to the subject and of some of their specific claims and rhetoric. Sternberg states his belief that science should be conducted with values in mind. He then argues that Rushton and Jensen were wrong to suggest any policy implications of their research because international variation in social norms and definitions of success may affect the influence IQ has on the attainment of success. While Sternberg acknowledges that there is a genetic factor affecting individual intelligence, he asserts that intelligence is changeable, and at the group level, subjective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sternberg |first=Robert J. |title=There are no public-policy implications: A reply to Rushton and Jensen (2005) |journal=Psychology, Public Policy, and Law |volume=11 |issue=2 |year=2005 |pages=295–301 |doi=10.1037/1076-8971.11.2.295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications of the achievement gap==

===Economic outcomes===
The racial achievement gap has consequences on the life outcomes of minority students. However, this gap also has the potential for negative implications for American society as a whole, especially in terms of workforce quality and the competitiveness of the American economy.&lt;ref name="espenshade9"/&gt; As the economy has become more globalized and the United States' economy has shifted away from manufacturing and towards a knowledge-based economy; education has become an increasingly important determinate of economic success and prosperity. A strong education is now essential for preparing and training the future workforce that is able to compete in the global economy. Education is also important for attaining jobs and a stable career, which is critical for breaking the cycle of poverty and securing a sound economic future, both individually and as a nation. Students with lower achievement are more likely to drop out of high school, entering the workforce with minimal training and skills, and subsequently earning substantially less than those with more education.  Therefore, eliminating the racial achievement gap and improving the achievement of minority students will help eliminate economic disparities and ensure that America's future workforce is well prepared to be productive and competitive citizens.&lt;ref name="kober12"&gt;Kober, Nancy. 2001. "It Takes More Than Testing: Closing the Achievement Gap." Washington, D.C: Center on Education Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reducing the racial achievement gap is especially important because the United States is becoming an increasingly diverse country. The percentage of African-American and Hispanic students in school is increasing: in 1970, African-Americans and Hispanics made up 15% of the school-age population, and that number had increased to 30% by 2000. It is expected that minority students will represent the majority of school enrollments by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ornstein |first=Allan C. |year=2010 |title=Achievement Gaps in Education |journal=Social Science and Public Policy |volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=424–429 |doi=10.1007/s12115-010-9354-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minorities make up a growing share of America's future workforce; therefore, the United States' economic competitiveness depends heavily on closing the racial achievement gap.&lt;ref name="kober12"/&gt;

The racial achievement gap affects the volume and quality of human capital, which is also reflected through calculations of GDP. The cost of racial achievement gap accounts for 2–4 percent of the 2008 GDP. This percentage is likely to increase as blacks and Hispanics continue to account for a higher proportion of the population and workforce. Furthermore, it was estimated that $310 billion would be added to the US economy by 2020 if minority students graduated at the same rate as white students.&lt;ref name="all4ed.org"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Alliance for Excellent Education |year=2009 |title=Potential Economic Impacts of Improved Education on the United States |url=http://www.all4ed.org/files/National_econ.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more substantial is the narrowing of educational achievement levels in the US compared to those of higher-achieving nations, such as Finland and Korea. McKinsey &amp; Company estimate a $1.3 trillion to $2.3 trillion, or a 9 to 16 percent difference in GDP.&lt;ref name="mckinseyonsociety.com"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=McKinsey &amp; Company |title=The Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap in America's Schools |url=http://mckinseyonsociety.com/downloads/reports/Education/achievement_gap_report.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Furthermore, if high school dropouts were to cut in half, over $45 billion would be added in savings and additional revenue. In a single high school class, halving the dropout rate would be able to support over 54,000 new jobs, and increase GDP by as much as $9.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Alliance for Excellent Education, "Education and the Economy: Boosting the Nation's Economy by Improving High School Graduation Rates" (Washington, DC: Author, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the cost of high school drop outs on the US economy is roughly $355 billion.

$3.7 billion would be saved on community college remediation costs and lost earnings if all high school students were ready for college. Furthermore, if high school graduation rates for males raised by 5 percent, cutting back on crime spending and increasing earnings each year would lead to an $8 billion increase the US economy.&lt;ref name="all4ed.org"/&gt;

====Job opportunities====
As the United States' economy has moved towards a globalized knowledge-based economy, education has become even more important for attaining jobs and a stable career, which is critical for breaking the cycle of poverty and securing a sound economic future. The racial achievement gap can hinder job attainment and social mobility for minority students. The [[United States Census Bureau]] reported $62,545 as the median income of White families, $38,409 of Black families, and $39,730 for Hispanic families.&lt;ref&gt;US Census. Table 697. Money Income of Families—Median Income by Race and Hispanic Origin in Current and Constant (2009) Dollars: 1990 to 2009. https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0697.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; And while the median income of Asian families is $75,027, the number of people working in these households is usually greater than that in White American families.&lt;ref name = "bcqnguyen3"/&gt; The difference in income levels relate highly to educational opportunities between various groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Katz |last2=Rodin |date=January 19, 2012 |title=Targeting an Achievement Gap in One of the Country's Most Educated Metros |work=Citylab |url=https://www.citylab.com/life/2012/01/achievement-gap-one-countrys-most-educated-cities/983/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who drop out of high school as a result of the racial achievement gap demonstrate difficulty in the job market. The median income of young adults who do not finish high school is about $21,000, compared to the $30,000 of those who have at least earned a high school credential. This translates into a difference of $630,000 in the course of a lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rouse |first=C.

(2011). The Condition of Education 2011 (NCES 2011–033), Indicator 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stereotype threat===

Beyond differences in earnings, minority students also experience stereotype threat that negatively affects performance through activation of salient racial stereotypes. The [[stereotype threat]] both perpetuates and is caused by the achievement gap.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, J. (2004). The Threat of Stereotype. Closing Achievement Gaps, 62 (3), 14-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, students of low academic performance demonstrate low expectations for themselves and self-handicapping tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerman, M., Kieffer, S., Knee, C.R. (1998). Consequences of Self-Handicapping: Effects on Coping, Academic Performance and Adjustment. 74 (6), 1619-1628.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists [[Claude Steele]], Joshua Aronson, and Steven Spencer, have found that [[microaggressions|Microaggression]] such as passing reminders that someone belongs to one group or another (i.e.: a group stereotyped as inferior in academics) can affect test performance.&lt;ref name="Stereotype Threat"&gt;"Stereotype Threat Widens Achievement Gap" American Psychological Association. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steele, Aronson and Spencer, have examined and performed experiments to see how stereotypes can threaten how students evaluate themselves, which then alters academic identity and intellectual performance. Steele tested the stereotype threat theory by giving Black and White college students a half-hour test using difficult questions from the verbal [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE). In the stereotype-threat condition, they told students the test diagnosed intellectual ability. In saying that the test diagnoses intellectual ability it can potentially elicit the stereotype that Blacks are less intelligent than Whites. In the no-stereotype-threat condition, they told students that the test was a problem-solving lab task that said nothing about ability. This made stereotypes irrelevant. In the stereotype threat condition, Blacks who were evenly matched with Whites in their group by SAT scores, performed worse compared to their White counterparts. In the experiments with no stereotype threat, Blacks performed slightly better than in those with a stereotype threat, though still significantly worse than whites. Aronson believes the study of stereotype threat offers some "exciting and encouraging answers to these old questions [of achievement gaps] by looking at the psychology of stigma -- the way human beings respond to negative stereotypes about their racial or gender group".&lt;ref name="Stereotype Threat"/&gt; When pressed, Steele, Aronson, and Spenser, acknowledge that their experiments on stereotype threat only explain a modest portion of test-score gaps.&lt;ref name="Heterodox" /&gt; However, their findings have consistently been erroneously attributed to explaining the entirety of the test score gap.&lt;ref name="Stereotype Threat"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heterodox&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jussim|first1=Lee|title=Is Stereotype Threat Overcooked, Overstated, and Oversold?|url=http://heterodoxacademy.org/2015/12/30/is-stereotype-threat-overcooked-overstated-and-oversold/|website=Heterodox Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Psychological Association is one such institution that misuses the study to posit that stereotype threat undercuts the tendency of evolutionary psychologists to lay the blame on genetic and cultural factors, such as whether African Americans "value" education.&lt;ref name="Stereotype Threat"/&gt; Researchers from Heterodox Academy, a think tank dedicated to pursuing intellectual diversity in academia, posit that the tendency of some social scientists to over emphasise the potency of stereotype threat, has to do with their loyalty to politically correct clean slate ideology, rather than objective reasoning.&lt;ref name="Heterodox" /&gt; Adherence to such dogma therefore permits these individuals to dismiss the possibility of less palatable explanations for racial group disparities, such as genetics and culture.&lt;ref name="Heterodox" /&gt;

===Political representation===
Another consequence of the racial achievement gap can be seen in the lack of representation of minority groups in public office. Studies have shown that higher socioeconomic status—in terms of income, occupation, and/or educational attainment—is correlated with higher participation in politics.&lt;ref name = "nie87"&gt;{{cite book |first=Sidney |last=Verba |authorlink=Sidney Verba |last2=Nie |first2=N. H. |year=1987 |title=Participation in America: Political Democracy and Social Equality |location= |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-85296-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This participation is defined as "individual or collective action at the national or local level that supports or opposes state structures, authorities, and/or decisions regarding allocation of public goods";&lt;ref name = "cross88"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Conge |first=P. J. |title=The Concept of Political Participation: Toward a Definition |journal=Comparative Politics |volume=20 |issue=2 |year=1988 |pages=241–249 |doi=10.2307/421669 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this action ranges from engaging in activities such as voting in elections to running for public office.

Since median income per capita for minority groups(Except Asians) is lower than that of White Americans, and since minority groups(Except Asians) are more likely to occupy less gainful employment and achieve lower education levels, there is a lowered likelihood of political participation among minority groups. Education attainment is highly [[Correlation and dependence|correlated]] with [[Wage|earnings]] and occupation.&lt;ref name="NCES" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "bcqnguyen5"&gt;US Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics. (2010). ''Occupation of employed persons 25 years old and over, by educational attainment and sex: 2010'' [Table]. Retrieved from http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d11/tables/dt11_394.asp&lt;/ref&gt; And there is a proven disparity between educational attainment of White Americans and minority groups, with only 30% of bachelor's degrees awarded in 2009 to minority groups.&lt;ref name = "bcqnguyen6"&gt;National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics. (2010). ''Science and Engineering Degrees, by Race/Ethnicity of Recipients: 1997–2006'' [Table]. Retrieved from https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf10300/.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus socioeconomic status—and therefore political participation—is correlated with race.&lt;ref name = "bcqnguyen3" /&gt; Research has shown that African Americans, Latino Americans, and Asian Americans are less politically active, by varying degrees, than White Americans.&lt;ref name = "bcqnguyen7"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verba |first=S. |last2=Schlozman |first2=K. L. |last3=Brady |first3=H. |last4=Nie |first4=N. H. |year=1993 |title=Race, ethnicity and political resources: Participation in the United States |journal=British Journal of Political Science |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=453–497 |doi=10.1017/S0007123400006694 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "bcqnguyen8"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lien |first=P. T. |year=2001 |title=The Making of Asian American through Political Participation |page=73 |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=1-56639-894-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consequence of underrepresentation of minority groups in leadership is incongruence between policy and community needs. A study conducted by Kenneth J. Meier and Robert E. England of 82 of the largest urban school districts in the United States showed that African American membership on the school board of these districts led to more policies encouraging more African American inclusion in policy considerations.&lt;ref name="bcqnguyen9"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meier |first=K.

=== Special programs ===

Achievement gaps among students may also manifest themselves in the racial and ethnic composition of [[special education]] and [[gifted education]] programs. Typically, African American and Hispanic students are enrolled in greater numbers in special education programs than their numbers would indicate in most populations, while these groups are underrepresented in gifted programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elliott |first=R. |year=1987 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMX6_zBD3-MC |title=Litigating intelligence: IQ tests, special education, and social science in the courtroom |location=Dover, MA |publisher=Auburn House |via=[[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yoon |first=S.

==Efforts to narrow the achievement gap==
The United States has seen a variety of different attempts to narrow the racial achievement gap.  These attempts include focusing on the importance of early childhood education, using federal standards based reforms, and implementing institutional changes.

===Early childhood education===
There are large cognitive and emotional gaps that form at early ages. They persist throughout childhood and strongly influence adult outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heckman |first=James |authorlink=James Heckman |journal=American Educator |title=The Economics of Inequality: The Value of Early Childhood Education |year=2011 |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=31–35 |doi= |url=http://www.actionforchildren.com/up_doc/heckman.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gaps originate before formal schooling begins and persists through childhood and into adulthood. Remediating the problems created by the gaps is not as cost effective as preventing them at the outset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Marie‐Claude |last=Geoffroy |first2=Sylvana M. |last2=Côté |first3=Charles‐Édouard |last3=Giguère |first4=Ginette |last4=Dionne |first5=Philip David |last5=Zelazo |first6=Richard E. |last6=Tremblay |first7=Michel |last7=Boivin |first8=Jean R. |last8=Seguin |display-authors=1 |title=Closing The Gap In Academic Readiness And Achievement: The Role Of Early Childcare |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume=51 |issue=12 |year=2010 |pages=1359–1367 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02316.x |pmc=3283580 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight psychologists performed an experiment of infant children born in Quebec in 1997/1998 and followed annually until 7 years of age. Children receiving formal childcare were distinguished from those receiving informal childcare. Children of mothers with low levels of education showed a consistent pattern of lower scores on academic readiness and achievement tests at 6 and 7 years than those of highly educated mothers, unless they received formal childcare. The findings provide further evidence suggesting that formal childcare could represent a preventative means of attenuating effects of disadvantage on children's early academic trajectory. Economic research shows that investment at this stage is both more effective and cost effective than interventions later in a child's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Heckman |first=James |authorlink=James Heckman |title=Catch ’em Young: Investing in Disadvantaged Young Children is Both Fair and Efficient |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=January 10, 2006 |page=A14 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113686119611542381 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An evaluation of Chicago Public Schools' federally funded Child Parent Centers find that for every $1 invested in the preschool program, nearly $11 is projected to return to society over the participants' lifetimes. This amount is equivalent to an 18% annual return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Brein |first=Anne |title=The Economic Impact of Early Childhood Education |work=Learning First Alliance |date=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Head Start Program]], Title I of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] (ESEA), and various state-funded pre-kindergarten programs target students from low-income families in an attempt to equal the playing field for these children before school begins. The evidence in favor of investing in early childhood education as a means of closing the achievement gap is strong: various studies have a positive and long-lasting effect on academic achievement of low-income and minority students. Evaluations of Head Start have reported positive results. However, fade-out effects were found in Head Start

Critics question whether an emphasis on early childhood education will benefit long-term kindergarten through 12th grade learning. Critics point to fade-out effects found in Head Start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Barton |first=Paul |last2=Coley |first2=Richard |title=The Black-White Achievement Gap When Progress Stopped |work=Policy Information Report |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Schaeffer, a policy analyst with the Cato Institute highlights research shows that students make some gains in the first two years after preschool but it fades out after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Spotlight on Education |work=Early Childhood Focus |publisher=NACCRRA |date=2008 |url=http://www.earlychildhoodfocus.org/artman2/publish/DC/Spotlight_On_Education.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent literature also reveals positive, short-term effects of early childhood education on children's development that weaken over time.&lt;ref name="Effrem"&gt;{{cite web |last=Effrem |first=Karen |title=Studies on Effectiveness of Early Childhood Programs |work=Edlibertywatch |date=May 2011 |url=http://edlibertywatch.org/2011/03/studies-on-effectiveness-of-early-childhood-programs/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more substantial is the narrowing of educational achievement levels in the US compared to those of higher-achieving nations, such as Finland and Korea. McKinsey &amp; Company estimate a $1.3 trillion to $2.3 trillion, or a 9 to 16 percent difference in GDP. However, Mary Ellen McGuire, an education policy director at think tank New America Foundations, pointed out that early childhood education isn't intended to be a silver-bullet fix to the educational system. It is merely one aspect.&lt;ref name="Effrem"/&gt; In order for those effects to last high-quality early childhood education needs to be connected to high-quality elementary schools.

===Standards-based reform===

Standards-based reform has been a popular strategy used to try to eliminate the achievement gap in recent years. The goal of this reform strategy is to raise the educational achievement of all students, not just minorities. Many states have adopted higher standards for student achievement. This type of reform focuses on scores on standardized tests, and these scores show that a disproportionate share of the students who are not meeting state achievement standards are Hispanic and African-American. Therefore, it is not enough for minorities to improve just as much as Whites do—they must make greater educational gains in order to close the gap.&lt;ref name="kober12"/&gt;

====Goals 2000====
One example of standards-based reform was [[Goals 2000]], also known as the Educate America Act. Goals 2000 was enacted in 1994 by President Clinton and allowed the federal government a new role in its support for education. It aimed to "provide a framework for meeting the National Education Goals".&lt;ref name="Goals2000"&gt;"Goals 2000: Educate America Act." Federal Education Policy History. N.p., June 2011. Web. &lt;http://federaleducationpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/06/15/goals-2000-educate-america-act/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to provide resources to states and communities to make sure that all students achieved their full potential by the year 2000. This program set forth eight goals for American students, including all children in America will start school ready to learn, increasing the high school graduation rate to at least 90%, and increasing the standing of American students to first in the world in achievement in math and science. Goals 2000 also placed an emphasis on the importance of technology, promising that all teachers would have modern computers in their classroom and that effective software would be an integral part of the curriculum in every school. President George Bush's No Child Left Behind Act essentially replaced the Goals 2000 program.&lt;ref name="Goals2000"/&gt;

====No Child Left Behind====
The [[No Child Left Behind Act]](NCLB) legislation was signed by President Bush in January 2002 and dramatically expanded federal influence over the nation's more than 90,000 public schools. The main implications of this legislation was states had to conduct annual student assessments linked to state standards to identify schools failing to make "adequate yearly progress" (AYP) toward the stated goal of having all students achieve proficiency in reading and math by 2013–2014 and to institute sanctions and rewards based on each school's AYP status.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas S. |last=Dee |first2=Brian |last2=Jacob |year=2011 |title=The impact of no Child Left Behind on student achievement |journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=418–446 |doi=10.1002/pam.20586  }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the motivations for this reform is that publicizing detailed information on school-specific performance and linking that "high-stakes" test performance to the possibility of sanctions will improve the focus and productivity of public schools. However, critics charge that test-based school accountability has several negative consequences for the broad cognitive development of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nichols |first=S. L. |last2=Berliner |first2=D. C. |title=Collateral damage: How high-stakes testing corrupts America's schools |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard Education Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-891792-36-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue that NCLB and other test-based accountability policies cause educators to shift resources away from important but non-tested subjects and to focus instruction in math and reading on the relatively narrow set of topics that are most heavily represented on the high-stakes tests. Some even suggest that high-stakes testing may lead school personnel to intentionally manipulate student test scores.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt;

NCLB has shown mixed success in eliminating the racial achievement gap. Although test scores are improving, they are improving equally for all races, which means that minority students are still behind whites. There has also been some criticism as to whether an increase in test scores actually corresponds to improvements in education, since test standards vary from state to state and from year to year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/29/education/29scores.html |title=‘No Child’ Law Is Not Closing a Racial Gap |first=Sam |last=Dillon |date=28 April 2009 |newspaper=[[New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional changes===
Research has shown that making certain changes within schools can improve the performance of minority students. These include lowering class size in schools with a large population of minority students; expanding access to high-quality preschool programs to minority families;&lt;ref name="kober12"/&gt; and focus on teaching the critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are necessary to retain high-level information.&lt;ref name="singham11"/&gt;

====Charter schools====
In the United States there are now 5,042 charter schools serving 1.5 million students in 39 states and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="EdWeek2011"&gt;"Charter Schools". Education Week, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they serve only a fraction of the nation's public school students, charter schools have seized a prominent role in education today. The question of whether charters or traditional public schools do a better job of educating students is still open to debate. The research is highly mixed due the complexities of comparison and wide performance differences among charters.&lt;ref name="EdWeek2011"/&gt;

[[Charter schools]] are by definition independent public schools. Although funded with taxpayer dollars, they operate free from many of the laws and regulations that govern traditional public schools. In exchange for that freedom, they are bound to the terms of a contract, or "charter," that lays out a school's mission, academic goals, and accountability procedures.&lt;ref name="EdWeek2011"/&gt; The average charter school enrollment is 372, compared with about 478 in all public schools. Researchers have linked small schools with higher achievement, more individualized instruction, greater safety, and increased student involvement.&lt;ref name="EdWeek2011"/&gt; With their relative autonomy, charter schools are also seen as a way to provide greater educational choice and innovation within the public school system. Another attraction of charter schools is that they often have specialized educational programs. Charters frequently take alternative curricular approaches, emphasize particular fields of study or serve special populations of students. That growth of charter schools has been particularly strong in cities. More than 55 percent of public charter schools were in urban settings. 
&lt;ref name="USDeptED"&gt;U.S. Department of Education 2011, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Some charters have high concentrations of minority students because demand for schooling alternatives is highest among such students, whom they say are often poorly served by the traditional public school systems. Lastly, another positive argument for charter schools is that they improve the existing school systems through choice and competition.&lt;ref name=" USDeptED "/&gt;

However, there are some criticisms of charter schools. There is a high variability in the quality and success of charter schools across the nation. A high-profile report from the [[American Federation of Teachers]] (2002), for example, argued that many charter school authorizers have failed to hold the administrators and teachers accountable, leaving some students to languish in low-performing schools.&lt;ref&gt;American Federation of Teachers, "Do Charter Schools Measure Up?: The Charter School Experiment After 10 Years," 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern of critics is that charters are more racially segregated than traditional public schools, thus denying students the educational "benefits associated with attending diverse schools".&lt;ref&gt;The Civil Rights Project at Harvard University, "Choice Without Equity:  Charter School Segregation and the Need for Civil Rights Standards," 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics also worry that charter schools unfairly divert resources and policy attention from regular public schools.

Taken together, studies about charter schools are inconclusive and have mixed results. Studies by the Goldwater Institute and California State University-Los Angeles found that students in charter schools show higher growth in achievement than their counterparts in traditional public schools.&lt;ref name=" USDeptED "/&gt; However, another study by the Institute of Race and Poverty at the University of Minnesota Law show that after two decades of experience, most charter schools in the Twin Cities still underperform comparable traditional public schools and are highly segregated by race and income.&lt;ref&gt;.Huff, Cynthia. "Study Shows Charter Schools Still Lag behind Traditional Public Schools in Test Scores and Are Increasingly Segregated by Race and Income." University of Minnesota. N.p., Feb. 2012.

=====Non-English schools=====
To evade a shift to English, some Native American tribes have initiated language immersion schools for children, where a native Indian language is the medium of instruction. For example, the [[Cherokee Nation]] instigated a 10-year language preservation plan that involved growing new fluent speakers of the [[Cherokee language]] from childhood on up through school immersion programs as well as a collaborative community effort to continue to use the language at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Native Now : Language: Cherokee| work = We Shall Remain - American Experience - PBS| accessdate = April 9, 2014| year = 2008| url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/weshallremain/native_now/language_cherokee}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan was part of an ambitious goal that in 50 years, 80% or more of the Cherokee people will be fluent in the language.&lt;ref name=preservation/&gt; The [[Cherokee Preservation Foundation]] has invested $3 million into opening schools, training teachers, and developing curricula for language education, as well as initiating community gatherings where the language can be actively used.&lt;ref name=preservation&gt;{{Cite web| title = Cherokee Language Revitalization| work = Cherokee Preservation Foundation| accessdate = April 9, 2014| year = 2014| url = http://www.cherokeepreservationfdn.org/cultural-preservation-connect/major-programs-and-initiatives/cherokee-language-revitalization| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070520/http://www.cherokeepreservationfdn.org/cultural-preservation-connect/major-programs-and-initiatives/cherokee-language-revitalization| archivedate = April 7, 2014| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in 2006, the Kituwah Preservation &amp; Education Program (KPEP) on the [[Qualla Boundary]] focuses on language immersion programs for children from birth to [[fifth grade]], developing cultural resources for the general public and community language programs to foster the Cherokee language among adults.&lt;ref name="kpep"&gt;Kituwah Preservation &amp; Education Program Powerpoint, by Renissa Walker (2012)'. 2012.

There is also a Cherokee language immersion school in Tahlequah, Oklahoma that educates students from pre-school through eighth grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Chavez, Will| title = Immersion students win trophies at language fair| work = Cherokeephoenix.org| accessdate = April 8, 2013| date = April 5, 2012| url = http://www.cherokeephoenix.org/Article/Index/6142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Oklahoma's official language is English, Cherokee immersion students are hindered when taking state-mandated tests because they have little competence in English.&lt;ref name=immersion&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youthonrace.org/cherokee-immersion-school-strives-to-save-tribal-language |title=Cherokee Immersion School Strives to Save Tribal Language |publisher=Youth on Race |accessdate=June 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703212619/http://www.youthonrace.org/cherokee-immersion-school-strives-to-save-tribal-language |archivedate=July 3, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Department of Education of Oklahoma said that in 2012 state tests: 11% of the school's sixth-graders showed proficiency in math, and 25% showed proficiency in reading; 31% of the seventh-graders showed proficiency in math, and 87% showed proficiency in reading; 50% of the eighth-graders showed proficiency in math, and 78% showed proficiency in reading.&lt;ref name=immersion/&gt; The Oklahoma Department of Education listed the charter school as a Targeted Intervention school, meaning the school was identified as a low-performing school but has not so that it was a Priority School.&lt;ref name=immersion/&gt; Ultimately, the school made a C, or a 2.33 grade point average on the state's A-F report card system.&lt;ref name=immersion/&gt; The report card shows the school getting an F in mathematics achievement and mathematics growth, a C in social studies achievement, a D in reading achievement, and an A in reading growth and student attendance.&lt;ref name=immersion/&gt; "The C we made is tremendous," said school principal Holly Davis, "[t]here is no English instruction in our school's younger grades, and we gave them this test in English."&lt;ref name=immersion/&gt; She said she had anticipated the low grade because it was the school's first year as a state-funded [[charter school]], and many students had difficulty with English.&lt;ref name=immersion/&gt; Eighth graders who graduate from the Tahlequah immersion school are fluent speakers of the language, and they usually go on to attend [[Sequoyah High School (Tahlequah, Oklahoma)|Sequoyah High School]] where classes are taught in both English and Cherokee.

====Private schools====
{{Main|School voucher}}

[[Private schools]] are another institution used in attempt to narrow the racial achievement gap. 
A disparity between achievement gaps in private and public schools can be seen using a U.S. Department of Education database to compute the average [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] test score differences between black students and white students in both public and private schools.

The table on White/Black NAEP Achievement Differences for Public and Private Schools above, shows a sizeable achievement gap between black and white fourth-graders in both public and private schools. However, the private-sector achievement gap is narrower in the 12th grade than the fourth grade for all of the core NAEP subjects. Public schools, on the other hand, see a larger gap in both writing and mathematics at the 12th-grade level than at the fourth. Averaged across subjects, the public school racial achievement gap is virtually unchanged between fourth and 12th grades, while the gap in private schools is an average of 27.5 percentage points smaller in the 12th grade than the fourth.

The achievement gap closes faster in private schools not because white private school students lose ground with respect to white public school students as they move to higher grades, but because black private school students learn at a substantially higher rate than black public school students. Economist Derek Neal has found that black students attending urban private schools are far more likely to complete high school, gain admission to college, and complete college than similar students in urban public schools.&lt;ref name="Coulson"&gt;{{cite web |last=Coulson |first=Andrew |year=2005 |title=Private Schools Are Closing the Achievement Gap |work=Heartlander |url=https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/private-schools-are-closing-the-achievement-gap }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in a study comparing graduation rates of all Milwaukee public school students (of all income levels) with those of the low-income participants in the city's private school voucher program, Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow Jay Greene found the voucher students were more than one-and-a-half-times as likely to graduate as public school students.&lt;ref name=" Coulson "/&gt;

However, others argue that private schools actually perpetuate and exacerbate the achievement gap. Without controlling for student background differences, private schools scored higher than public schools. However, a study showed that demographic differences between students in public and private schools more than account for the relatively high scores of private schools. In fact, after controlling for these differences, the advantageous "private school effect" disappears and even reverses in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |last=Lubienski |first=Christopher |last2=Lubienski |first2=Sarah |year=2006 |title=Charter, Private, Public Schools and Academic Achievement: New Evidence from NAEP Mathematics Data |publisher=National Center for the Study of Privatization in Education Teachers College, Columbia University |url=https://ncspe.tc.columbia.edu/working-papers/OP111.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Private schools have selective acceptance and a different demographic. Another criticism is that private schools only serve a small percent of the population and therefore cannot make a huge effect on closing the achievement gap. 

Greg Wiggan believes that although there is a lot of research on the topic of the racial achievement gap, there is a gap in the research. Wiggan believes that the gap that is missing is the research of the perspective of the students, specifically high-achieving Black students in private schools.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiggan|first=Greg|date=September 2007|title=Race, School Achievement, and Educational Inequality: Toward a Student-Based Inquiry Perspective|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.3102%2F003465430303947|journal=Review of Educational Research|language=en|volume=77|issue=3|pages=310–333|doi=10.3102/003465430303947|issn=0034-6543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Teach For America====

[[Teach for America]] (TFA) recruits and selects graduates from some of the top colleges and universities across the country to teach in the nation's most challenging K-12 schools throughout the nation. It began in 1990 with 500 teachers and has since expanded to over 4,000 teacher placements in 2010.&lt;ref name="Xu"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Xu |first=Zeyu |last2=Hannaway |first2=Jane |last3=Taylor |first3=Colin |title=Making a Difference? The Effect of Teach For America in High School |journal=Journal of Policy Analysis &amp; Management |year=2011 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=447–469 |doi=10.1002/pam.20585 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management they use individual-level student data linked to teacher data in North Carolina to estimate the effects of having a TFA teacher compared to a traditional teacher. According to studies about the effect of different teacher-preparation programs in Louisiana, North Carolina, and Tennessee, TFA is among the most effective sources of new teachers in low-income communities. Each of these statewide studies, conducted between 2009 and 2012, found that corps members often help their students achieve academic gains at rates equal to or larger than those for students of more veteran teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Research |work=Teach For America |url=http://www.teachforamerica.org/our-organization/research }}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings show that TFA teachers are in general more effective, according to student exam scores, than traditional teachers that would be in the classroom in their stead.&lt;ref name="Xu"/&gt; These estimates demonstrate that, compared with traditional teachers with similar levels of experience, TFA teachers have strong positive effects on student test scores. And despite the limitations of TFA teachers, they are no worse than average traditional teachers in teaching math subjects and much more effective in teaching science subjects.

Although TFA teachers tend to have stronger academic credentials, they have not been taught in traditional training programs, are more likely to teach for a few years, and are assigned to some of the most challenging schools in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boyd |first=D. J. |last2=Grossman |first2=P. |last3=Lankford |first3=H. |last4=Loeb |first4=S. |last5=Wyckoff |first5=J. |year=2006 |title=How changes in entry requirements alter the teacher workforce and affect student achievement |journal=Education Finance and Policy |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=176–216 |doi=10.1162/edfp.2006.1.2.176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given these differences, the TFA program has been controversial. Critics of Teach For America point out two of the major problems. The first is that most TFA teachers have not received traditional teacher training. TFA corps members participate in an intensive five-week summer national institute and a two-week local orientation and induction program prior to their first teaching assignment, and therefore some argued they are not as prepared for the demands of the classroom as traditionally trained teachers. The second criticism is that TFA requires only a two-year teaching commitment, and the majority of corps members leave at the end of that commitment. The short tenure of TFA teachers is troubling because research shows that new teachers are generally less effective than more experienced teachers.&lt;ref name="Xu"/&gt;

==== Interventions fon Non-Cognitive Factors ====
Many different types of interventions can be done to help students who are a part of a negative stereotype, but a self-affirmation intervention would be the most helpful for students academic performance.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen, Garcia, Apfel, Master|first=Geoffrey, Julio, Nancy, Allison|date=September 2006|title=Reducing the Racial Achievement Gap: A Social-Psychological Intervention|url=http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs375/fa13/cs375/Science-2006-Cohen-1307-10.pdf|journal=Science|volume=313|pages=1307–1310|doi=10.1126/science.1128317}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This intervention was expected to help improve a group of students who are at risk to intervene with the group’s academic performance. This intervention was tested in two different double-blind field experiences, and then compared.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One of the things seen was that African American students who were a part of the control condition, who saw their performance declining early in the term, their performance did not improve as the term went on, and in fact it got worse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One thing that could lead to a slight improvement is having a small reduction in the psychological threats. Small interventions were seen to have a greater effect when they were carried out in multiple trials, different times. Having just one intervention one time does not have a positive effect on a student, rather if there are multiple smaller interventions carried out different times.

'''Ramon Sainero''' (born May 25, 1944) is the director of the [http://www.uned.es/estudiosceltas/ Institute of Celtic Studies (IEC)] of Spain and Associate Professor and Professor at [[:es:Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia|UNED]] &lt;ref&gt;[[National University of Distance Education]]&lt;/ref&gt; during the last 37 years.

==Studies==
Ramon Sainero has a degree in Philology from the [[Universidad Complutense]] of Madrid. He attended PhD and M.A. studies in Irish literature in the New University of Ulster (Coleraine) and obtained his PhD in the Universidad Complutense of Madrid. He has attended intensive courses in Celtic languages and literature for over ten years in [[Ireland]], at the Universities of Galway (Cararoe), Trinity College (Dublin), The University of Ulster (Coleraine) and Oideas Gael (Donegald). His university teaching has been given at the University of Ulster (Lector) and the Universidad Complutense (Lecturer).

== Field of Research ==

His field of research for many years has been focused on [[Celtic studies|Celtic Studies]] and the influence of early Indo-European culture in the Iberian Peninsula and the British Isles. The commonly maintained theory is that the [[Celts]], or at least [[Celtic Civilization]], originated in central Europe, with [[Halstatt]] (Austria) and [[La Tene]] (Switzerland) as the principal sources of information on these origins. Although it appears evident that Central Europe was a key settlement site, from which the Celtic culture spread outwards, this does not mean the [[Celts]], or the Celtic culture, originated from that part of Europe. The Danube, the Mediterranean Sea and Spain could also have constituted the site from which this invasive wave made its way into the interior of Europe, and this is a possibility that we should not discard. Nowadays a new theory has been developed with historical, archaeological, linguistic and cultural proofs, a theory that during centuries was considered only as mythology.

== Written Works ==

Concerning this new theory, the following is a list of published studies he has authored:

*'''''The Celtic Heritage in Spain and Ireland '''''(1987) contract signed in 1984 and published in 1987 by Ed. Akal (Madrid). It offers some surprising evidences as that the pre-Iberian alphabet of [[Tartessos]] is very similar or the same as continental [[Runes]].
*'''''The Celts and Historical and Cultural Origins of Atlantic Europe''''', ''(The Celtic-Scythians in the [[Leabhar Gabhala]]) ''contract signed in 2003 andpublished in 2013 by [[Academica Press]] (USA)''.''
*'''''The Celtic origins of the kingdom of Brigantia: the genesis of Spain''''', contract signed in 2003 and published in 2009 by Ed. Abada (Madrid). Sainero points out that Celtic manuscripts speak of the [[Scythians]] (mentioned by [[Herodotus]] and [[Scolots]]) and Scots as  the primitive origin of Celtic people. The aim of his research is not to reject any historical or archaeological theory, but rather to contribute further to the existing body of knowledge.
*'''''A Historical and Linguistic reconstruction of [[Celts]] of the Iberian Peninsula''''', contract signed in 2012 and published in 2013, in which Sainero offers the lector a new way of studying the [[Celts]] and the primitive history and culture of the West Atlantic compering [[Old Irish]], [[Hispano-Celtic languages|Hispano-Celt]] and primitive [[Thracian languages]].

== His Theories ==

He offers in his studies a series of surprising data according with the Irish manuscript [[Leabhar Gabhala|Leabhar Gabhala (Book of Invasions)]]&lt;ref&gt;Leabhar Gabhála (Do Ghabhálaibh Érend). The recension of Michael Ócleirigh. Edited by R. A. Stewart Macalister and John MacNeill (irlandés-inglés). Hodges Figgis and Co., Dublin, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; on that perhaps may demonstrate how many of the historical events described in this manuscript were not pure invention and that, moreover, provide a historical and literary interpretation much more truthful than has so far been thought to be the case.

At the estuary of the [[River Danube]] ([[Thrace]]), around the [[Black Sea]] and the eastern end of the Mediterranean, artistic, cultural and archaeological remains exist, some of which predate the 7th century BC, which point to the existence of a people, or series of people, with a shared religion and culture. The nearest inhabitants to them at that time, the [[Greeks]], referred to them as [[Scythians]], and many hypotheses exist that indicate that the [[Celts#Celtic art|Celtic culture]] was influenced by them in its origins, despite the fact that more complex forms were subsequently to develop.&lt;ref&gt;Annals of Clonmacnoise, The (Translated into English A. D. 1627. Faccsimile of the original title page. Printed at the [[University press]], 1896). Reprinted by Llanerch Publishers, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was these [[Scythians]] who, according to the [[Leabhar Gabhála]] ([[Book of Invasions]]), on their journey across the Mediterranean would sometimes, but not always, make their settlements first in [[Greece]], then in [[Egypt]], subsequently in [[Spain]] and finally in [[Ireland]]. It was their descendants who were to go on to create the early [[Celts|Celtic]] kingdoms of Spain and Ireland. Up to this point, the aforementioned book has been considered by many specialists to be a fabulous story full of fantasy.

One important and fundamental consideration in these books&lt;ref&gt;Annals of Ulster:, The: Ed. S. Mac Airt, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ora marítima (autor: Avieno), Ediciones Historia 2000 (Madrid), 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; is that, when we refer to the [[Scythians]] ([[Scolots]]) and the Celto-Scythians ([[Thracian]] and/or Caucasian people?), we are in fact referring to [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European peoples]] who emanated out from the plains bordering on the [[Black Sea]] in a series of waves towards Central Europe, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. According to him, It would perhaps be more accurate to speak of tribes, clans or waves of Indo-European migrants, but it is the Celtic manuscripts that speak of the [[Scythians]] and [[Scoti|Scots]] (¿Scits or Scolots?) as the primitive origin of [[Celtic people]].

It is important to point out that the [[Scythians]] did not leave behind any written documentation. Presumably, they did not have a written language in this sense, but their Greek, Persian, Assyrian and Phoenician neighbours did, and indeed left us clear information on their history and culture. Their migrations were sometimes rapidly undertaken and took them long distances from their previous site, on which basis it is not surprising that the primitive documents, acceptable or not, make references to the Scots in [[Ireland]]&lt;ref&gt;Annals of the Four Masters (Annala Rioghachta Eireann): Ed. de J. O´Donovan, Hodges Smith (Dublin), 1856. Reprinted by The Búrca rare Books (Dublin), 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; (people connected in their pilgrimage with [[Thracians]], [[Greeks]], [[Spaniards]] and other people). Sainero also credits them with possessing a significant army, capable of defeating, at certain times in history, the most fearsome armies of the era, such as the [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].

His comparison, following the above example is this: Approximately one thousand two hundred years previously, the peoples settled on the plains on the shores of [[Thracia]] and/or the [[Caucasus Sea]], the [[Scythians]] and other nearby communities with settlements in [[Greece]] or [[Asia Minor]], nomadic and skilled warriors and horsemen, were able, our evidence shows, to conquer some territories in Europe and, assimilating the culture of those they conquered, to go on to create a new civilization: the [[Celtic civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Primera Crónica General de España (recop.: Alfonso X el Sabio), E. Gredos (Madrid), 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Repetek Biosphere State Reserve''', often referred to as '''Repetek Nature or Desert Reserve''', ({{lang-tk|Repetek goraghanasy}}, ''Репетек горагханасы'') is a [[desert]] [[Protected areas of Turkmenistan|nature reserve]] (''[[zapovednik]]'') of [[Turkmenistan]], located in [[Lebap Province]], East [[Karakum Desert]], near [[Amu Darya]]. It is located approximately {{Convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} south from [[Türkmenabat]] and is known for its ''zemzen'' (desert monitor which is [[Varanus griseus]]). Established in 1928 for the study and preservation of a sand-desert ecosystem, it covers an area of {{Convert|346|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.

==Geography==

The landscape of the reserve is arid, with extensive ridged sand dunes some {{Convert|15|-|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height and {{Convert|8|-|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length in many areas, large areas of sand dune and valley-like depressions.{{Sfn|UNESCO}} [[Haloxylon aphyllum|Black saxaul]] (''Haloxylon aphyllum''), rare to most part of Central Asia covers more than {{Convert|1470|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, approximately 4.5% of the territory of the reserve. The soils have sandy subsoils, but some "21 trees, 104 grasses, 8 mushrooms, 1 moss, 68 soil algae and 197 fungi" grow within the reserve.{{Sfn|UNESCO}}

==History==

The Repetek sandy desert scientific station was organized in 1912 by the decision of the [[Russian Geographical Society]], and the reserve was established in 1928 on the base of the scientific station.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sokolov|Veiisov|Gunin|1990| p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Soviet period the reserve belongs to the Institute of Deserts of the Turkmen SSR Academy of Sciences. The list of scientific publications concerning with the Repetek sandy desert station and the biosphere reserve since 1982 to 1991 consists of about 250 papers (30% on landscape structure and geography, 20% on botany and 50% on zoology).{{Sfn|Kuzmenko, Veiisov|1992|p=76}}

The Institute of Deserts, Flora and Fauna of the Academy of Sciences of Turkmenistan was established in 1962 to study ways of reclaiming desert land for economic use in the reserve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/498342/Repetek-Nature-Reserve Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental protection==
 
The Repetek Biosphere State Reserve is part of an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) and since 1979 has been an under the monitoring of [[UNESCO]] but "the site is under the administration of the Ministry of Nature Protection of Turkmenistan".{{Sfn|UNESCO}} The reserve "supports the most complete assemblage of bird species typical of the sand desert of the Karakum" and "has an important population of [[Goitered Gazelle]] (Gazella subgutturosa) which is listed as Vulnerable (VU) in the [[IUCN Red List]]".{{Sfn|UNESCO}}

==Climate==

Repetek Biosphere State Reserve has a [[desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWk''), with cool winters and very hot summers. Rainfall is generally light and erratic, and occurs mainly in the winter and autumn months.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20792">'''Retail design''' is a creative and [[Commerce|commercial]] discipline that combines several different areas of expertise
together in the [[design]] and construction of [[retail]] space. Retail design is primarily a specialized practice of [[architecture]] and [[interior design]], however it also incorporates elements of [[interior decoration]], [[industrial design]], [[graphic design]], [[ergonomics]], and [[advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7BAPAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Retail+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MneRTJBRwrvyBpu2vd8F&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA "Retail design"] by Otto Riewoldt, te Neues, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6v83ALvUN6kC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=%22Retail+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hXyRTPLKBMOB8gbx8q28Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Retail%20design%22&amp;f=false "Becoming an Architect: A Guide to Careers in Design"] by Lee W.

Retail design is a very specialized discipline due to the heavy demands placed on retail space. Because the primary purpose of retail space is to stock and sell product to consumers, the spaces must be designed in a way that promotes an enjoyable and hassle-free shopping experience for the consumer.
For example, research shows that male and female shoppers who were accidentally touched from behind by other shoppers left a store earlier than people who had not been touched and evaluated brands more negatively.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Brett A. S. (2012), [http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Martin-JCR-2012.pdf "A Stranger’s Touch: Effects of Accidental Interpersonal Touch on Consumer Evaluations and Shopping Time"], ''Journal of Consumer Research'', 39 (June), 174-184.&lt;/ref&gt; The space must be specially-tailored to the kind of product being sold in that space; for example, a [[bookstore]] requires many large shelving units to accommodate small products that can be arranged categorically while a clothing store requires more open space to fully display product.&lt;ref name="Luxury"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a_6CublRtYwC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=%22Retail+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1neRTLXQJoL68AaJ36XMBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Retail%20design%22&amp;f=false "Luxury retail design and atmosphere"], ''Luxury fashion branding: trends, tactics, techniques'' by Uché Okonkwo, Palgrave Macmillan, 2007, Pg. 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NfglUyGCCF4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Retail+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1neRTLXQJoL68AaJ36XMBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Retail%20design%22&amp;f=false "Building type basics for retail and mixed-use facilities"] by Stephen A.

Retail spaces, especially when they form part of a [[retail chain]], must also be designed to draw people into the space to shop. The storefront must act as a [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] for the store, often employing large display windows that allow shoppers to see into the space and the product inside. In the case of a retail chain, the individual spaces must be unified in their design.&lt;ref name="Luxury" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R8N6qJeo1DAC&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=%22Retail+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pHuRTKiHF8K78ga1v5i-BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Retail%20design%22&amp;f=false "Boutiques and other retail spaces: the architecture of seduction"] by Leontine de Wit, Taylor &amp; Francis US, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Retail design first began to grow in the middle of the 19th century, with stores such as [[Bon Marche]] and [[Printemps]] in [[Paris]], "followed by Marshall Fields in Chicago, Selfridges in London and Macy's in New York." These early retail design stores were swiftly continued with an innovation called the [[chain store]]. 

The first known [[chain stores|chain department stores]] were established in Belgium in 1875, when Isidore, Benjamin and Modeste Dewachter incorporated ''Dewachter frères'' (Dewachter Brothers) selling [[ready-to-wear]] clothing for men and children and specialty clothing such as riding apparel and beachwear.&lt;ref name =ACTS&gt;Annexes to the Belgian Monitor of 1875. Acts, Extracts of Acts, Minutes and Documents relating to Corporations, Book #3, Page 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louisdewis.com LouisDewis.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The firm opened with four locations&lt;ref name =ACTS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:La Louvière|The French Wikipedia site reports that ''Dewachter frères'' opened in La Louvière in 1865, but provides no reference.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and, by 1904, ''Maison Dewachter'' (House of Dewachter) had stores in 20 cities and towns in Belgium and France, with multiple stores in some cities.&lt;ref&gt;''Maison Dewachter'' Liège 1891 letterhead&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Maison_Dewachter_Bordeaux,_France_Letterhead_1904.png ''Maison Dewachter'' Bordeaux 1904 letterhead listing 20 cities and towns and three stores in Bordeaux itself]&lt;/ref&gt; Isidore's eldest son, Louis Dewachter, managed the chain at its peak and also became an internationally known landscape artist, painting under the pseudonym [[Louis Dewis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louisdewis.com LouisDewis.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first retail chain store in the United States was opened in the early 20th century by [[Frank Winfield Woolworth]], which quickly became a franchise across the US. Other chain stores began growing in places like the UK a decade or so later, with stores like [[Boots UK|Boots]]. After [[World War II]], a new type of retail design building known as the [[shopping centre]] came into being. This type of building took two different paths in comparison between the US and Europe. Shopping centres began being built out of town within the United States to benefit the [[suburban]] family, while Europe began putting shopping centres in the middle of town. The first shopping centre in the [[Netherlands]] was built in the 1950s, as retail design ideas began spreading east.&lt;ref name="Key"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GPROj1JJIO4C&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=%22Retail+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1neRTLXQJoL68AaJ36XMBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Retail%20design%22&amp;f=false "Retail Design"], ''Design: the key concepts'' by Catherine McDermott, Psychology Press, 2007, Pg. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

The next evolution of retail design was the creation of the [[boutique]] in the 1960s, which emphasized retail design run by individuals. Some of the earliest examples of boutiques are the [[Biba]] boutique created by [[Barbara Hulanicki]] and the [[Habitat (retailer)|Habitat]] line of stores made by [[Terence Conran]]. The rise of the boutique was followed, in the next two decades, with an overall increase in consumer spending across the [[Developed country|developed world]]. This rise made retail design shift to compensate for increased customers and alternative focuses. Many retail design stores redesigned themselves over the period to keep up with changing consumer tastes. These changes resulted on one side with the creation of multiple "expensive, one-off designer shops" catering to specific [[fashion design]]ers and retailers.&lt;ref name="Key" /&gt;

The rise of the [[internet]] and [[Online shopping|internet retailing]] in the latter part of the 20th century and into the 21st century saw another change in retail design to compensate. Many different sectors not related to the internet reached out to retail design and its practices to lure online shoppers back to physical shops, where retail design can be properly utilized.&lt;ref name="Key" /&gt;

==Usage==

===Role===
A retail designer must create a thematic experience for the [[consumer]], by using spatial cues to entertain as well as entice the consumer to purchase goods and interact with the space.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.9&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of their designs are not measured by design critics but rather the records of the store which compare amount of foot traffic against the overall productivity. Retail designers have an acute awareness that the store and their designs are the background to the merchandise and are only there to represent and create the best possible environment in which to reflect the merchandise to the target consumer group.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design elements===
Since the evolution of retail design and its impact on productivity have become clear, a series of standardisations in the techniques and design qualities has been determined. These standardisations range from alterations to the perspective of the structure of the space, entrances, circulation systems, atmospheric qualities (light and sound) and materiality. By exploring these standardisations in retail design the consumer will be given a thematic experience that entices them to purchase the merchandise. It is also important to acknowledge that a retail space must combine both permanent and non permanent features, that allow it to change as the needs of the consumer and merchandise change (e.g. per season).&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, E. and Watson, H., 2007. "Fashion Retail". 2nd ed. West Sussex, England: John Wiley and Sons Ltd. p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of retail space creates the constraints of the overall design; often the spaces already exist, and have had many prior uses. It is at this stage that logistics must be determined, structural features like columns, stairways, ceiling height, windows and emergency exists all must be factored into the final design. In retail one hundred percent of the space must be utilised and have a purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.15-17&lt;/ref&gt; The floor plan creates the circulation which then directly controls the direction of the traffic flow based on the studied psychology of consumer movement pattern within a retail space. [[circulation (architecture)|Circulation]] is important because it ensures that the consumer moves through the store from front to back, guiding them to important displays and in the end to the cashier.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, L.J., 1994. "Store Planning/ Design". United States of America: John Wiley &amp; sons, INC.&lt;/ref&gt; There are six basic store layouts and circulation plans that all provide a different experience:

# '''Straight plan:''' this plan divides transitional areas from one part of the store to the other by using walls to display merchandise. It also leads the consumer to the back of the store. This design can be used for a variety of stores ranging from pharmacies to apparel.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.6"&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.6&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Pathway plan:''' is most suitable for large stores that are single level. In this plan there is a path that is unobstructed by shop fixtures, this smoothly guides the consumer through to the back of the store. This is well suited for apparel department stores, as the clothes will be easily accessible.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.6"/&gt;
# '''Diagonal plan:''' uses perimeter design which cause angular traffic flow. The cashier is in a central location and easily accessible. This plan is most suited for self-service retail.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.6"/&gt;
# '''Curved plan:''' aims to create an intimate environment that is inviting. In this plan there is an emphasis on the structure of the space including the walls, corners and ceiling this is achieved by making the structure curved and is enhance by circular floor fixtures. Although this is a more expensive layout it is more suited to smaller spaces like salons and boutiques.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.7"&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.7&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Varied plan:''' in this plan attention is drawn to special focus areas, as well as having storage areas that line the wall. This is best suited for footwear and jewellery retail stores.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.7"/&gt;
# '''Geometric plan:''' uses the racks and the retail floor fixtures to create a geometric floor plan and circulation movement. By lowering parts of the ceiling certain areas can create defined retail spaces. This is well suited for appeal stores.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.7"/&gt;

Once the overall structure and circulation of the space has been determined, the atmosphere and thematics of the space must be created through lighting, sound, materials and visual branding. These design elements will cohesively have the greatest impact on the consumer and thus the level of productivity that could be achieved.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Lighting can have a dramatic impact on the space. It needs to be functional but also complement the merchandise as well as emphasize key points throughout the store. The lighting should be layered and of a variety of intensities and fixtures. Firstly, examine the natural light and what impact it has in the space. Natural light adds interest and clarity to the space; also consumers also prefer to examine the quality of merchandise in natural light.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.65-80&lt;/ref&gt; If no natural light exists, a sky light can be used to introduce it to the retail space. The lighting of the ceiling and roof is the next thing to consider. This lighting should wash the structural features while creating vectors that direct the consumer to key merchandise selling areas. The next layer should emphasize the selling areas. These lights should be direct but not too bright and harsh. Poor lighting can cause eye strain and an uncomfortable experience for the consumer. To minimize the possibility of eye strain, the ratio of luminance should decrease between merchandise selling areas. The next layer will complement and bring focus onto the merchandise; this lighting should be flattering for the merchandise and consumer. The final layer is to install functional lighting such as clear exit signs.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.147-167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israel, L.J., 1994. "Store Planning/ Design". United States of America: John Wiley &amp; sons, INC.p.183-191&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambiance can then be developed within the atmosphere through sound and audio, the music played within the store should reflect what your target market would be drawn to, this would also be developed through the merchandise that is being marketed. In a lingerie store the music should be soft, feminine and romanticized; where in a technology department the music would be more upbeat and more masculine.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, E. and Watson, H., 2007. "Fashion Retail". 2nd ed. West Sussex, England: John Wiley and Sons Ltd.p.213&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Materiality (architecture)|Materiality]] is another key selling tool, the choices made must not only be aesthetically pleasing and persuasive but also functional with a minimal need for maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.563-566&lt;/ref&gt; Retail spaces are high traffic area and are thus exposed to a lot of wear this means that possible finishes of the materials should be durable. The warmth of a material will make the space more inviting, a floor that is firm and somewhat buoyant will be more comfortable for that consumer to walk on and thus this will allow them to take longer when exploring the store.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p51-64"&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p51-64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Israel, L.J. 1994. p.160-172"&gt;Israel, L.J., 1994. "Store Planning/ Design". United States of America: John Wiley &amp; sons, INC.p.160-172&lt;/ref&gt; By switching materials throughout the store zones/ areas can be defined, for example by making the path one material and contrast it against another for the selling areas this help to guide the consumer through the store. Colour is also important to consider it must not over power or clash against the merchandise but rather create a complementary background for the merchandise. As merchandise will change seasonally the interior colours should not be trend based but rather have timeless appeal like neutral based colours.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p51-64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Israel, L.J. 1994. p.160-172"/&gt;

Visual branding of the store will ensure a memorable experience for the consumer to take with them once they leave the store ensuring that they will want to return. The key factor is consistency exterior [[brand]]ing and signage should continue into the interior, they should attract, stimulate and dramatise the store. To ensure consistency the font should be consistent with the font size altering.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, L.J., 1994. "Store Planning/ Design". United States of America: John Wiley &amp; sons, INC.p.192&lt;/ref&gt; The interior branding should allow the consumer to easily self direct themselves through the store, proper placement of sales signs that will draw consumer in and show exactly where the cashier is located. The branding should reflect what the merchandise is and what the target market would be drawn to.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.81-94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.258&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perspective===
The final element of a well-executed retail space is the staging of the consumer's [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]]. It is the role of retail design to have total control of the view that the consumer will have of the retail space. From the exterior of a retail store the consumer should have a clear unobstructed view into the interior.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.169-170&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rock opera''' is a collection of [[rock music]] songs with lyrics that relate to a common story. Rock operas are typically released as [[concept album]]s and are not scripted for acting, which distinguishes them from operas, although several have been adapted as [[rock musical]]s. The use of various character roles within the song lyrics is a common storytelling device. The success of the rock opera genre has inspired similar works in other musical styles, such as [[rap opera]].
== History ==
In an early use of the term, the July 4, 1966, edition of ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM Magazine]]'' (published in Toronto) reported that "[[Bruce Cockburn]] and Mr [[William Hawkins (songwriter and poet)|[William] Hawkins]] are working on a Rock Opera, operating on the premise that to write you need only 'something to say'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Stuart|last=Maconie|title=The People’s Songs: The Story of Modern Britain in 50 Records|date=2013|page=167|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xmq82qoq70C&amp;pg=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colin Fleming of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' has identified ''[[The Story of Simon Simopath]]'' (1967) by British psychedelic band [[Nirvana (British band)|Nirvana]] as the first recorded rock opera.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/11/the-who-made-the-best-rock-opera-ever-but-its-not-the-one-you-think/248431/|title=The Who Made the Best Rock Opera Ever, but It's Not the One You Think|last=Fleming|first=Colin|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=2011-11-15|accessdate=2014-05-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140524142611/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/11/the-who-made-the-best-rock-opera-ever-but-its-not-the-one-you-think/248431/|archivedate=May 24, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in 1967, Montreal's [[Influence (band)|Influence]] recorded a long suite titled "Mad Birds of Prey (A Mini-Opera)", which closed out their sole album, which was released in January 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes to Pacemaker Entertainment PACE-095, the 2014 CD reissue of the 1968 Influence LP, ABC 630&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps unaware of these earlier efforts, Neil Strauss of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that ''[[S.F.

The resulting rock operas have met varying degrees of success as the worlds of [[high art]] and [[low art]] mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2007/08/17/at_last_a_rock_opera_that_sings/|title=At last, a rock opera that sings|last=Swed|first=Mark|work=[[Boston.com]]|date=2007-08-17|accessdate=2014-05-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525200122/http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2007/08/17/at_last_a_rock_opera_that_sings/|archivedate=May 25, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russian music, the term ''zong-opera'' (Зонг-опера) is sometimes used, since the first Soviet-Russian rock-opera ''[[Orpheus and Eurydice (rock opera)|Orpheus and Eurydice]]'' was described with this term, though the term "rock-opera" was already known in the Soviet rock music circles.

A rock opera that experienced commercial recording and Broadway success is ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', written by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]], and in respect of which Lloyd Webber said "the piece was written as a rock album from the outset and set out from the start to tell the story through the music itself." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicrockreview.com/2013/03/jesus-christ-superstar/|title=&lt;em&gt;Jesus Christ Superstar&lt;/em&gt;, a Rock Opera - Classic Rock Review|author=|date=|website=www.classicrockreview.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124183208/http://www.classicrockreview.com/2013/03/jesus-christ-superstar/|archivedate=November 24, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
According to Fleming, rock operas are more akin to a [[cantata]] or [[suite (music)|suite]], as they are not usually acted out.&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt;  Similarly, Andrew Clements of ''[[The Guardian]]'' called ''Tommy'' a subversively-labeled [[musical theatre|musical]].  Clements states that lyrics drive rock operas, which makes them not a true form of opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/feb/09/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures|title=When is an opera not an opera?|last=Clements|first=Andrew|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2002-02-08|accessdate=2014-05-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525200335/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/feb/09/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures|archivedate=May 25, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Responding to accusations that rock operas are pretentious and overblown, Pete Townshend wrote that pop music by its very nature deflates such attitudes and is simplistic.  Townshend said that the only goal of pop music is to reach audiences, and rock operas are merely one more way to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/mar/31/featuresreview.review3|title=Tommy, get your gun...|last=Townshend|first=Pete|authorlink=Pete Townshend|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2002-03-30|accessdate=2014-05-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525200622/http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/mar/31/featuresreview.review3|archivedate=May 25, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Peter Kiesewalter]], on the other hand, said that rock music and opera are "both overblown, massive spectacles" that cover the same themes.  Kiesewalter, who was originally not a fan of opera, did not think the two styles would mix well together, but his modernized operas with rock music surprised him with their  popularity at the [[East Village Opera Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/27/AR2008032701018.html|title=Rock Opera.

Rock operas are usually recorded and performed on albums by the artists themselves, but they can also be performed on the stage, such as ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'', which played on Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/28/theater/pop-view-can-rock-play-to-the-broadway-crowd.html|title=POP VIEW;Can Rock Play to the Broadway Crowd?|last=Pareles|first=Jon|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1996-04-28|accessdate=2014-05-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525200938/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/28/theater/pop-view-can-rock-play-to-the-broadway-crowd.html|archivedate=May 25, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This usage has also courted controversy; Anne Midgette of ''The New York Times'' called them musicals with "no more than the addition of a keyboard and a drum set".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/28/theater/reviews/28soul.html?_r=0|title=Cruising and Schmoozing While Looking for Mr. Right|last=Midgette|first=Anne|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2006-01-28|accessdate=2014-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the [[recent African origin of modern humans]], the '''Southern Dispersal''' scenario (also the '''coastal migration''' hypothesis) refers to the [[early human migrations|early migration]] along the southern coast of Asia, from the [[Arabian peninsula]] via [[Persian plateau|Persia]] and [[Indian subcontinent|India]] to [[Sundaland|Southeast Asia]] and [[Prehistory of Australia#Arrival|Oceania]].&lt;ref name="endicott2007"&gt;{{Citation | title=The Evolution and History of Human Populations in South Asia: Inter-disciplinary Studies in Archaeology, Biological Anthropology, Linguistics and Genetics |author1=Phillip Endicott |author2=Mait Metspalu |author3=Toomas Kivisild | year=2007 | publisher=[[Springer Netherlands]] | isbn=978-1-4020-5561-4 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x05p66517331h166/fulltext.pdf | quote=''...

The theory proposes that [[archaic humans|early ''Homo sapiens'']], some of the bearers of mitochondrial haplogroup [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3]] arrived in the Arabian peninsula about 70,000 years ago, crossing from East Africa via the [[Bab-el-Mandeb straits]]. It has been estimated that from a population of 2,000 to 5,000 individuals in Africa, only a small group, possibly as few as 150 to 1,000 people, crossed the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2003|last=Zhivotovsky|title=Features of Evolution and Expansion of Modern Humans, Inferred from Genomewide Microsatellite Markers | pmc=1180270 |volume=72 |issue=5 |pmid=12690579 |last2=Rosenberg |first2=NA| last3=Feldman |first3=MW |pages=1171–86 |doi=10.1086/375120|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|display-authors=etal}}{{cite web |year=2008 |first=Gary |last=Stix |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-migration-history-of-humans|title=The Migration History of Humans: DNA Study Traces Human Origins Across the Continents|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group would have travelled along the coastal route around Arabia and Persia to India relatively rapidly, within a few thousand years.

[[File:Statement von GS Kyrle zur Befreiung der Jemen Geiseln (8724149668).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Public figures use [[press conference]]s so often as a way to control the timing and specificity of their messages to the media that press conference facilities have been nicknamed "[[spin room]]s".]]
In [[public relations]] and [[politic]]s, '''spin''' is a form of [[propaganda]], achieved through providing a biased interpretation of an event or campaigning to persuade [[public opinion]] in favor or against some organization or public figure. While traditional public relations and [[advertising]] may also rely on altering the presentation of the facts, "spin" often implies the use of [[Wikt:disingenuous|disingenuous]], [[deceptive]], and highly [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] tactics.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Safire]], "[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/22/magazine/the-spinner-spun.html The Spinner Spun]", ''New York Times'', December 22, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because of the frequent association between spin and [[press conference]]s (especially [[government]] press conferences), the room in which these conferences take place is sometimes described as a "[[spin room]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michael, Powell. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/22/us/politics/22scene.html "Tit for Tat on a Night Where Spin Is Master,"] ''New York Times.'' February 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Public relations advisors, pollsters and media [[consultant]]s who develop deceptive or misleading messages may be referred to as "'''spin doctors'''" or "'''spinmeisters'''".

As such, a standard tactic used in "spinning" is to reframe, reposition, or otherwise modify the perception of an issue or event, to reduce any negative impact it might have on public opinion. For example, a company whose top-selling product is found to have a significant safety problem may "reframe" the issue by criticizing the safety of its main competitor's products or indeed by highlighting the risk associated with the entire product category. This might be done using a "catchy" [[slogan]] or [[sound bite]] that can help to persuade the public of the company's biased [[point of view (philosophy)|point of view]]. This tactic could enable the company to defocus the public's attention on the negative aspects of its product. {{cn|date=June 2017}}

As it takes experience and training to "spin" an issue, spinning is typically a service provided by paid media advisors and media [[consultant]]s. The largest and most powerful companies may have in-house employees and sophisticated units with expertise in spinning issues. While spin is often considered to be a private sector tactic, in the 1990s and 2000s, some politicians and political staff have been accused by their opponents of using deceptive "spin" tactics to manipulate public opinion or deceive the public. Spin approaches used by some political teams include "burying" potentially negative new information by releasing it at the end of the workday on the last day before a long weekend; selectively [[cherry-picking]] quotes from previous speeches made by their employer or an opposing politician to give the impression that they advocate a certain position; and purposely [[News leak|leaking]] [[misinformation]] about an opposing politician or candidate that casts them in a negative light.{{cn|date=June 2017}}


== History ==
[[Edward Bernays]] has been called the "Father of Public Relations". As [[Larry Tye]] describes in his book ''The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and The Birth of [[Public Relations]]'', Bernays was able to help [[tobacco]] and [[alcohol]] companies use techniques to make certain behaviors more socially acceptable in 20th-century United States. Tye claims that Bernays was proud of his work as a propagandist.&lt;ref&gt;Stauber, John and Sheldon Rampton. [http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/1999Q2/bernays.html  "Book Review: ''The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays &amp; The Birth of PR'' by Larry Tye,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121185416/http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/1999Q2/bernays.html |date=2008-11-21 }} ''PR Watch'' (Second Quarter 1999). Vol. 6, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As information technology has increased dramatically since the end of the 20th century, commentators like [[Joe Trippi]] have advanced the theory that modern [[Internet activism]] spells the end for political spin. By providing immediate counterpoint to every point a "spin doctor" can come up with, this theory suggests, the omnipresence of the Internet in some societies will inevitably lead to a reduction in the effectiveness of spin.&lt;ref&gt;Branigan, Tania, "[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jun/13/newmedia.egovernment Internet spells end for political spin, says US web guru]", ''[[The Guardian]]''. 12 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
The techniques of spin include:
*[[File:Picking Cherries.jpg|alt=Cherry picking as a farming and a public relations practice.|thumb|Cherry picking is a practice of using selective facts to present to the public. It refers to the farming practice of picking only ripe cherries. ]]Selectively presenting facts and quotes that support one's position ("[[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]]"). For example, a pharmaceutical company could pick and choose two trials where their product shows a positive effect, ignoring hundreds of unsuccessful trials, or a politician's staff could handpick short speech quotations from past years which appear to show their candidate's support for a certain position.
* [[Non-denial denial]]
* [[Non-apology apology]]
* "[[Mistakes were made]]" is an example of [[distancing language]] commonly used as a rhetorical device, whereby a speaker acknowledges that a situation was managed by using low-quality or inappropriate handling but evades any direct admission or accusation of responsibility by not specifying the person or organization who made the mistakes. Grammatically, the expression uses the [[English passive voice|passive voice]] to focus on the action while omitting the actor. The acknowledgement of "mistakes" is framed in an abstract sense, with no direct reference to who made the mistakes. The speaker neither accepts personal responsibility nor accuses anyone else. The word "mistakes" also does not imply intent. A less evasive [[active voice]] construction would place the focus on the actor, such as: "I made mistakes" or "John Doe made mistakes." 
* Phrasing in a way that [[Begging the question|assumes unproven claims]], or [[avoiding the question]]&lt;ref&gt;Staff. "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/are-these-examples-of-political-spin/7265.html Are these examples of political spin?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815015401/http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/are-these-examples-of-political-spin/7265.html |date=2012-08-15 }}". ''[[BBC Learning Zone]]''. Clip 7265. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Burying bad news": announcing unpopular things at a time when it is believed that the media will focus on other news. In some cases, governments have released potentially controversial reports on summer long weekends, to avoid significant news coverage. Sometimes that "other news" is supplied by deliberately announcing popular items at the same time.
* Misdirection and diversion&lt;ref name=weissman&gt;Weissman, Jerry. "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jerry-weissman/spin-versus-topspin_b_218103.html Spin vs. Topspin]". ''[[The Huffington Post]]''. 19 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Limited hangout]]

For years, businesses have used fake or misleading [[Testimonial#Customer testimonials|customer testimonials]] by editing/spinning customers to reflect a much more satisfied experience than was actually the case. In 2009, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] updated their laws to include measures to prohibit this type of "spinning" and have been enforcing these laws as of late. {{cn|date=June 2017}}

Several companies that verify the authenticity of the testimonials businesses present on the marketing materials in an effort to convince one to become a customer have arisen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://business.trustedcompany.com/blog/en/testimonials-vs-verified-reviews/]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4764">'''Structural priming''' is a form of [[Priming (psychology)#Positive and negative priming|positive priming]], in that it induces a tendency to repeat or more easily process a current sentence that is similar in structure to a previously presented prime. It is a [[phenomenon]] studied in the field of [[psycholinguistics]]. J. Kathryn Bock introduced it in 1986,.&lt;ref name="bock"&gt;Bock, J.K. (1986). Syntactic persistence in language production. ''Cognitive Psychology'', 18, 355-387.&lt;/ref&gt; Several paradigms exist to elicit structural priming.&lt;ref name="bock"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potter, M &amp; Lombardi, L. 1990. Regeneration in short-term recall of sentences. ''Journal of Memory and Language'', 29, 633-654.&lt;/ref&gt; Structural priming persists cross-linguistically.&lt;ref&gt;Loebell, H. &amp; Bock, K. (2003). Structural priming across languages. ''Linguistics'', 41(5), 791-824.&lt;/ref&gt; One specific form of structural priming is syntactic priming.

==Eliciting structural priming==

;Picture description

Bock introduced a picture description task&lt;ref name="bock"/&gt; to investigate this phenomenon. In the study phase, at their own pace, participants read a list of sentences and observe a set of pictures. All these pictures describe events including an [[Thematic relation|agent, patient, and theme]]. Half of the agents pictured are humans and the other half inanimate objects. This phase of the experiment was performed in an attempt to establish a "recognition memory" cover story. In the test phase, participants are asked to read a sentence expressing one of four conditions:
*Transitive active: ''George kicked the ball''
*Transitive passive: ''The ball was kicked by George''
*[[Dative]] double-object: ''George gave the boy the ball''
*Dative prepositional phrase: ''George gave the ball to the boy''
After reading a sentence, the participant repeats it. Following this repetition, the participant describes the picture.

;Results of picture description

Consider a trial wherein the participant is reading a dative double-object construction, ''George gave the boy the ball''. The subject is then significantly more likely to describe the a picture as ''X gave Y the Z'' instead of ''X gave the Z to Y''. This persistence in sentential form is structural priming.&lt;ref name="bock"/&gt;

==Theory of structural priming==
At least four theories exist to explain structural priming: syntactic [[Priming (psychology)#Repetition|repetition]]; thematic congruency, derivation of subjects, and error-based learning.
;Syntactic repetition
In the Bock study, the sentences presented match their primes in syntactic structure. This is trivially true for any type-type prime. However, other structural priming patterns exist that complicate this explanation.
;Thematic congruency
A structure known as the [[Unaccusative verb|unaccusative]], which is unmarked morphologically in [[English language|English]], is capable of priming passive transitive sentences. The two constructions differ in syntax, but in both cases the subject takes a thematic, or at least non-agentive, thematic role.
*Unaccusative: ''The parcel arrived''
*Passive Transitive: ''The parcel was sent by the post''
Because the two constructions have this property in common, it has been suggested that such a thematic relational mapping is what allows structural priming.&lt;ref&gt;Melinger, A. (2006). The influence of thematic role assignment on structural priming. Poster presented at the 19th annual CUNY conference on Human Sentence Processing, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Derivation of subjects
A second possibility for describing the presence of unaccusative-passive priming is their shared characteristic of having a derived subject. For instance, the passive subject is said by some scholars of syntax to be derived via movement, or "smuggling," from the same position where it is generated in the active, to wit, the complement of the transitive verb.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, C. (2005). A smuggling approach to the passive in english. ''Syntax'', August, 81-120.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the derivation of the unaccusative does not seem to be an identical process, it is nevertheless assumed to be derived.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, C. (2006). Structural and Thematic Information in Sentence Production. Proceedings of NELS 37. UIUC.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Error-based learning'''

Another explanation is that syntactic priming is a form of implicit learning supported by a prediction error-based learning mechanism. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Franklin|last2=Dell|first2=Gary S.|last3=Bock|first3=Kathryn|date=2006|title=Becoming syntactic.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-295x.113.2.234|journal=Psychological Review|volume=113|issue=2|pages=234–272|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.113.2.234|issn=1939-1471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14030">'''Suchilquitongo''' is a [[Mesoamerica]]n [[archaeological site]] located in [[Santiago Suchilquitongo]] municipality of [[San Pablo Huitzo]] in the [[Etla District, Oaxaca|Etla District]] of the [[Valles Centrales de Oaxaca|Valles Centrales region]] of [[Oaxaca]] state in south-western Mexico, some 30 kilometers north of the [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca City]] on Federal Highway 190.

According to INAH, this archaeological site is locally called Cerro de la Campana, due to the popular belief that in one of its buildings or mounds a gold bell lies buried. Geographical charts assign the locality Cerro la Cantera since even today pink stone is extracted from quarry deposits. This quarry is of high quality and very useful to construct modern buildings.&lt;ref name=INAH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za01705.html|title=Suchiquitongo INAH web page|date=|publisher=Correa Fuentes, Dora Angelica  [[INAH]]|location=|language=Spanish|accessdate=Sep 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003130143/http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za01705.html|archivedate=2010-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is also known by ''Huijazoo'', which means "war fortress" in the [[Zapotec languages|Zapotec Language]].&lt;ref name= Turimexico&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.turimexico.com/oaxaca/hijazoo.php|title= Huijazoo|date=|publisher=Turimexico.com|location=|language=Spanish|accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oaxaca&gt;{{cite web |url= http://oaxaca-travel.com/guide/cultural.php?getdoc=true&amp;lang=es&amp;doc=home&amp;section=cultural&amp;atractivo=10.02.02.02|title=Huijazoo, Oaxaca Tourist Guide|date=|publisher=Oaxaca Travel|location=|language=Spanish|accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical brief==
According to the Municipalities Encyclopedia, Suchilquitongo name is a contraction of the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] word Xochiliquitonco, consisting of Xochitl, "flower", Quilitl (Sp), quelitón, quelite, and Tontli, "diminutive" of Co, "in"; means: "in the flowered [[quelite (disambiguation)|quelite]]s".&lt;ref name=Municipios&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/municipios/20483a.htm|title=Mexican Municipalities Encyclopedia – Santiago Suchilquitongo|location=|language=Spanish|accessdate=Sep 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041211135701/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/municipios/20483a.htm|archivedate=2004-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to studies conducted by archaeologist Enrique Mendez, this human settlement presumably developed approximately 1000&amp;nbsp;BCE., becoming part of a social nucleus already properly structured, with a correct social formation, territory and proper government forms, by the year 300 or 400 CE., thus forming the main seat of which was the high guijazoo lordship, with chosen buildings where guijazoo powers sat, forming a horseshoe figure, between the towns of San Pablo Huitzo in the north and Santiago Suchilquitongo to the south.&lt;ref name=Municipios /&gt;

The latter, where on the “cerro de la campana” is located the famous Tomb number 5, which has been described as the Zapotec art “Sistine Chapel” which in 1985, was a source of controversy among authorities and people of Santiago Suchilquitongo and San Pablo Huitzo, who claimed ownership of the territory where this archaeological jewel is located, rather this dispute arises from a misunderstanding, when it was mentioned that Tomb 5 was found in cerro de la campana. Both Huitzo and Suchilquitongo, by coincidence, each have such a named hill within their respective territories. Suchilquitecos also call their own hill, “El Mogote”, or the Mound of the Old Lady. On the mound a fortress was discovered, decorated with serpents and a figure representing [[Quetzalcoatl]], who was worshiped by Mesoamerican cultures.&lt;ref name=Municipios /&gt;

However, according to the Municipalities Encyclopedia for San Pablo Huitzo the name in Spanish means “Espinazo” (Ridge). Also Huexolotitlan means place where there are Guajolotes (Turkey). Huexolotl, Turkey; titlan place of. The Zapotec called this town Huijazoo, which means: Atalaya place of warriors.&lt;ref name= Municipios1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/municipios/20294a.htm|title=Mexican Municipalities Encyclopedia – SAN PABLO HUITZO|location=|language=Spanish|accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical research of San Pablo Huitzo notes that the town has a history dating back to 1200&amp;nbsp;BCE. Approximately, history tells us that by the year 1400 CE., the place was known with the Huijazoo name and years later, when it was conquered by the [[Aztecs]], the town was then named Gueixolotitlan and by the 1700s its name was again changed to what is known today.&lt;ref name=Municipios1 /&gt;

==Site history ==
As a result of archaeological explorations, constructive evidence, and human occupation evidence suggest that the oldest remains, within the Huitzo municipality, are those of Barrio del Rosario and the latest or more recent evidence is located within the territorial limits of the municipality of Santiago Suchilquitongo. The “Cueva de la Vieja” complex has not yet been explored. It is believed that the settlement evolution dates back to the earliest times of human development in the Oaxaca valleys, since ancient human evidence have been found from 2799 years ago in the known Barrio del Rosario, in Huitzo.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Local historians and some scholars link this site with the mythical Huijazo or Atalaya War where Zapotec defended their country against Mixtec invaders, fact that remains to be documented by the archaeological record.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

So far it is not known the year in which this ceremonial center was abandoned.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

==The Site==
The architectural complex is located on the summit of a hill, at a height of 150 meters above the floor of the [[Valley of Oaxaca]], provides an exceptional viewing position, which on a clear day provides a view of up to forty kilometers, with clear air and accurate view.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The site is on a small artificially leveled crest, which allows foundation for eight buildings more than four meters high and with foundation bases of up to 25&amp;nbsp;m per side. At its apogee, the hill slopes were contained by rough walls which were coated with flattened stucco lime, giving the complex a fortress aspect. During the ascent to the Summit the remains of platforms and smaller buildings as well as steps are notorious; all of them are coated with lime stucco so it is considered that access should have been restricted to common people. Three of the partially restored buildings show simple walls superimposed with recessed stairways against its façade. One is highlighted by lateral stairways main access. Each of the eight buildings has on top, a single room with a short hallway in front. Due to recovered evidence, possibly priests, sorcerers and nobles used them to perform ceremonies, astronomical observations, and human sacrifices. It is deduced by the decorations that some of these buildings had on their facades that such acts perhaps were dedicated to the rain god [[Cocijo]] cult.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Future archaeological excavations may verify the hypothesis that each of the eight existing buildings contains internal tombs; this sector may be a necropolis.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The complex longitudinal axis was drawn from east to east, leaving the floors of the three existing plazas at different levels in relation to the sunken patio sunk or ballgame court. The level difference is evident between building 1 platform and the sunken patio floor, 6.50 meters, while the difference between building 3 patio and the floor of the Main Plaza is just 4.6 meters.

==Tomb No. 5==
An important finding was made in 1985 with the discovery of tomb 5, located in building 1. Together with the [[Monte Alban]] 105 tomb, both contemporary, these could be considered as the most beautiful archaeology funeral samples in the Oaxaca region. This tomb is below the building at a depth of about six and a half meters, same elevation of the sunken patio floor in the Center of the complex.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The Tomb was built during the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec culture]] classical period (650-900 CE)., hence it is about 1240 years old; some scholars believe that it was used at least twice after the Great Lord who originally ordered its construction for his own burial ceremony, known as “Señor 12 Monos (12 monkey) who probably ruled this land. Entrance is down nine steps leading to a hall, that at the time of its discovery was sealed with a large stone block. Two stones carved in bas-relief with the representation of richly dressed priests form the entry, on top is a large monolithic lintel holding a feline head with open jaws, a precious bird head sticks out the mouth.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

This realistic representation is framed with abstract God Cocijo elements such as the headdress on the feline as ornament, and symbols of defended mountains, water and force winds to the sides of the head. Is noteworthy that the entire composition is embedded inside of a double scapular panel, which except in exceptional cases, only was used as a decorative element of the facades of monumental buildings of the classic period in the valleys of Oaxaca.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Past the portico is the [[antechamber]], which resembles a courtyard flanked by two niches with east and west lintels, communicating the main burial chamber by three short steps which are inserted on a pair of double scapular boards. Each of the existing room spaces has finely bas-reliefs carved jambs painted red, representing governing couples preceding the rule of “12 mono”. The antechamber walls are painted with frescos from the ceremony of burial of the original Tomb; ceremony attended by warriors, priests, whiners (plañideras), musicians, sorcerers and fantastic characters, as well as ballgame players, all of this with a polychromy handling never seen in similar funerary representation.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The access lintel to the main chamber is richly decorated with a character who wearing a helmet with God [[Cocijo]] attributes and the symbol of “bundle of years” that some wish to identify with the intertwined triangles that prehispanic astronomers used in their measurements. Both described lintels decorations were made in fine stone masonry coated with lime plaster. Red dominates all antechamber space, as representing death for the Zapotec.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The burial chamber is a masonry decorated rectangle with frescos from the Lords of the villages under the domination of “12 mono” at the time of his death and at least sixteen individuals dressed as ballgame players, some with the helmet in hand and preceded by a couple of warriors.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

At the back of the camera is a fine [[bas-relief]] carved stonework piece, painted red representing the transmission charge from “12 Mono” parents; “11 movimiento” and lady “4 turquesa”, made in favor of his son and his wife then, lady “10 Mono”. The magnificent carving of face details of the represented characters is striking, as well as their clothing and furnishings used to sit, particularly those used by the main character, located in the far right of the top box of the tombstone.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The archaeological site of the [[Cerro de la Campana]] lacks public services at the time. In the Centre of the village of Santiago Suchilquitongo, visitors can visit the Community Museum that has a replica of 5 Tomb, as well as some of the pieces found in the interior.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Tomb 5 is closed to the public due to the fragile nature of the paintings contained within. It can be entered only enter with [[INAH]] permission.&lt;ref name=DeLange&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mx.images.search.yahoo.com/images/view?back=http%3A%2F%2Fmx.images.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3F_adv_prop%3Dimage%26va%3Dsuchilquitongo%26fr%3Dyfp-t-706&amp;w=596&amp;h=364&amp;imgurl=www.delange.org%2FHuijazoo1%2FDsc00028.jpg&amp;rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.delange.org%2FHuijazoo1%2FHuijazoo1.htm&amp;size=60k&amp;name=Dsc00028+jpg&amp;p=suchilquitongo&amp;oid=c97b1f2d7ff7a8e6&amp;fr2=&amp;no=3&amp;tt=29&amp;sigr=11e43p64h&amp;sigi=1165vg4lh&amp;sigb=12u0hft4b&amp;type=JPG|title=Visit to San Pablo Huitzo, Oaxaca, by Audrey and George DeLange|date=|location=|language=|accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site Museum==
The archaeological site lacks public services. In the Centre of the village of Santiago Suchilquitongo, is a Community Museum that has a replica of Tomb 5, as well as some of the pieces found in its interior.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt; In San Pablo Huitzo, is another small museum with prehispanic items and colonial religious art.&lt;ref name=DeLange/&gt;

==Huijazoo site Orientation==
George DeLange is an astronomer and has been one for over thirty five years. He noticed one unusual alignment, the entire plan of this city seems to be on a very different alignment than most of the cities in Mesoamerica. It seems to be aligned on a SE to NW alignment. He suspects that alignment may have been to the solstices rather than to equinox, as most of the Mesoamerican cities show.&lt;ref name=DeLange /&gt;

Klein]] as a classic in the field of the [[supernatural]].&lt;ref name="American Supernatural Tales 1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Chambers, Robert W(illiam) |first=T. E.

"The Yellow Sign" inspired a [[The Yellow Sign#Film|film of the same name]] released in 2001.

The British first edition was published by [[Chatto &amp; Windus]] in 1895 (316 pages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?25609 |title= The King in Yellow |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stories==
The first four stories are loosely connected by three main devices:

* A play in book form entitled ''The King in Yellow''
* A mysterious and malevolent supernatural entity known as the King in Yellow
* An eerie symbol called the [[Yellow Sign]]

These stories are macabre in tone, centering, in keeping with the other tales, on characters that are often artists or [[decadence|decadents]], inhabitants of the ''demi-monde''.

The first and fourth stories, "The Repairer of Reputations" and "The Yellow Sign", are set in an imagined future 1920s America, whereas the second and third stories, "The Mask" and "In the Court of the Dragon", are set in Paris. These stories are haunted by the theme: "Have you found the Yellow Sign?"

The weird and macabre character gradually fades away during the remaining stories, and the last three are written in the romantic fiction style common to Chambers' later work. They are all linked to the preceding stories by their Parisian setting and their artistic protagonists.

===List of stories===
The stories in the book are:
[[File:Repairer of Reputations Chapter 1.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Hildred Castaigne in "[[The Repairer of Reputations]]", illustration by Tucker Sherry.]]
* "[[The Repairer of Reputations]]" – A weird story of egotism and paranoia which carries the imagery of the book's title.
* "The Mask" – A dream story of art, love, and uncanny science.
* "[[In the Court of the Dragon]]" – A man is pursued by a sinister church organist who is after his soul.
* "[[Yellow Sign|The Yellow Sign]]" – An artist is troubled by a sinister churchyard watchman who resembles a coffin worm.
* "[[The Demoiselle d'Ys]]" – A ghost story, the theme of which anticipates [[H. G. Wells]]' "[[H. G. Wells bibliography#Stories|The Door in the Wall]]" (1906).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/129798.The_King_in_Yellow_and_Other_Horror_Stories | title=The King in Yellow and Other Horror Stories by Robert W. Chambers - Reviews, Discussion, Bookclubs, Lists | publisher=[[Goodreads]] | accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[The Prophets' Paradise]]" – A sequence of eerie prose poems that develop the style and theme of a quote from the fictional play ''The King in Yellow'' which introduces "The Mask".
* "The Street of the Four Winds" – An atmospheric tale of an artist in Paris who is drawn to a neighbor's room by a cat; the story ends with a macabre touch.
* "The Street of the First Shell" – A war story set in the [[Siege of Paris (1870–71)|Paris Siege]] of 1870.
* "The Street of Our Lady of the Fields" – Romantic American bohemians in Paris.
* "Rue Barrée" – Romantic American bohemians in Paris, with a discordant ending that playfully reflects some of the tone of the first story.

==The play called ''The King in Yellow''==
The fictional play ''The King in Yellow,'' has at least two acts and at least three characters: Cassilda, Camilla and "The Stranger", who may or may not be the title character.

Chambers' story collection excerpts some sections from the play to introduce the book as a whole, or individual stories. For example, "Cassilda's Song" comes from Act 1, Scene 2 of the play:

:Along the shore the cloud waves break,
:The twin suns sink behind the lake,
:The shadows lengthen
::In [[Carcosa]].

:Strange is the night where black stars rise,
:And strange moons circle through the skies,
:But stranger still is
::Lost Carcosa.

:Songs that the [[Hyades (mythology)|Hyades]] shall sing,
:Where flap the tatters of the King,
:Must die unheard in
::Dim Carcosa.

:Song of my soul, my voice is dead,
:Die thou, unsung, as tears unshed
:Shall dry and die in
::Lost Carcosa.&lt;ref name="Cassilda"&gt;"The King in Yellow" in e.g. {{cite book

 | title = The Yellow Sign and Other Stories
 | series = Call of Cthulhu Fiction
 | publisher = [[Chaosium]]
 | isbn = 1-56882-170-0
 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short story "The Mask" is introduced by an excerpt from Act 1, Scene 2d:

:''Camilla: You, sir, should unmask.''
:''Stranger: Indeed?''
:''Cassilda: Indeed it's time. We have all laid aside disguise but you.''
:''Stranger: I wear no mask.''
:''Camilla: (Terrified, aside to Cassilda.) No mask? No mask!''&lt;ref name="Mask"&gt;"The Mask" in e.g. {{cite book

 | series = Call of Cthulhu Fiction
 | publisher = [[Chaosium]]
 | isbn = 1-56882-170-0
 | page = 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also stated, in "The Repairer of Reputations", that the final moment of the first act involves the character of Cassilda on the streets, screaming in a horrified fashion, "Not upon us, oh, king! Not upon us!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chambers | first = Robert W. | authorlink = Robert W. Chambers | year = 2004 | title = The Yellow Sign and Other Stories | series = Call of Cthulhu Fiction | publisher = [[Chaosium]] | isbn = 1-56882-170-0 | page = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the excerpts come from Act I. The stories describe Act I as quite ordinary, but reading Act II drives the reader mad with the "irresistible" revealed truths. "The very banality and innocence of the first act only allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect." Even seeing the first page of the second act is enough to draw the reader in: "If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening words in the second act I should never have finished it [...]" ("The Repairer of Reputations").

Chambers usually gives only scattered hints of the contents of the full play, as in this extract from "[[The Repairer of Reputations]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He mentioned the establishment of the Dynasty in Carcosa, the lakes which connected Hastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of the Hyades. He spoke of Cassilda and Camilla, and sounded the cloudy depths of Demhe, and the Lake of Hali. "The scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow must hide Yhtill forever," he muttered, but I do not believe Vance heard him. Then by degrees he led Vance along the ramifications of the Imperial family, to Uoht and Thale, from Naotalba and Phantom of Truth, to Aldones, and then tossing aside his manuscript and notes, he began the wonderful story of the Last King.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A similar passage occurs in "The Yellow Sign", in which two protagonists have read ''The King in Yellow'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Night fell and the hours dragged on, but still we murmured to each other of the King and the Pallid Mask, and midnight sounded from the misty spires in the fog-wrapped city. We spoke of Hastur and of Cassilda, while outside the fog rolled against the blank window-panes as the cloud waves roll and break on the shores of Hali.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influences==
Chambers borrowed the names Carcosa, Hali and [[Hastur]] from [[Ambrose Bierce]]: specifically, his [[short story|short stories]] "[[An Inhabitant of Carcosa]]" and "Haïta the Shepherd". There is no strong indication that Chambers was influenced beyond liking the names. For example, Hastur is a god of shepherds in "Haïta the Shepherd", but is implicitly a location in "The Repairer of Reputations", listed alongside the Hyades and Aldebaran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Stableford]] pointed out that the story "[[The Demoiselle d'Ys]]" was influenced by the stories of [[Théophile Gautier]], such as "Arria Marcella" (1852); both Gautier and Chambers' stories feature a love affair enabled by a supernatural [[time travel|time slip]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Stableford, "The King in Yellow" in Frank N. Magill, ed. ''Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature'', Vol 2. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, Inc., 1983. (pp. 844-847).&lt;/ref&gt; The name Jeanne d'Ys is also a [[homophone]] for the word [[jaundice]] and continues the symbolism of The King in Yellow.

In [[Raymond Chandler]]'s 1938 detective story, also titled "The King in Yellow", the protagonist says "The King in Yellow. I read a book by that title once."

The first season of HBO's ''[[True Detective]]'' television series revolves around a string of crimes committed by the elusive "Yellow King" with [[Carcosa]] also being mentioned on numerous occasions. Black stars are also prominent in reference and imagery during the series.

[[SCP Foundation]] entry SCP-701, The Hanged King, is possibly a reference to this. The titular play being one that causes violence and insanity among both the cast and audience members.

one of his main [[Cthulhu Mythos]] stories. Lovecraft borrowed Chambers' method of only vaguely referring to supernatural events, entities, and places, thereby allowing his readers to imagine the horror for themselves. The play ''The King in Yellow'' effectively became another piece of [[Cthulhu Mythos arcane literature|occult literature in the Cthulhu Mythos]] alongside the ''[[Necronomicon]]'' and others.

In the story, Lovecraft linked the Yellow Sign to [[Hastur]], but from his brief (and only) mention it is not clear what Lovecraft meant Hastur to be. [[August Derleth]] developed Hastur into a [[Great Old One]] in his controversial reworking of Lovecraft's universe, elaborating on this connection in his own mythos stories. In the writings of Derleth and a few other latter-day Cthulhu Mythos authors, the King in Yellow is an [[Avatar]] of Hastur, so named because of his appearance as a thin, floating man covered in tattered yellow robes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In Lovecraft's cycle of horror sonnets, ''Fungi from Yuggoth'', sonnet XXVII "The Elder Pharos" mentions the last Elder One who lives alone talking to chaos via drums: "The Thing, they whisper, wears a silken mask of yellow, whose queer folds appear to hide a face not of this earth...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This thing with a silken mask of yellow also features in ''[[The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath]]''. 

In the [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|''Call of Cthulhu'' roleplaying game]] published by [[Chaosium]], the King in Yellow is an avatar of Hastur who uses his eponymous play to spread insanity among humans. He is described as a hunched figure clad in tattered, yellow rags, who wears a smooth and featureless "Pallid Mask". Removing the mask is a sanity-shattering experience; the King's face is described as "inhuman eyes in a suppurating sea of stubby maggot-like mouths; liquescent flesh, tumorous and gelid, floating and reforming".{{attribution needed|date=November 2010}}

Although none of the characters in Chambers' book describe the plot of the play, Kevin Ross fabricated a plot for the play within the ''Call of Cthulhu'' mythos.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

''[[The Secret World]]'', a Lovecraft-inspired [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]], quotes Cassilda's Song and other elements from ''The King in Yellow'' during a quest.

The theft of a supposed manuscript of the play ''The King in Yellow'' from the British Library forms a major plot element of [[Charles Stross]]'s Lovecraft-inspired book ''[[The Annihilation Score]]''.

In Alan Moore's comic series [[Providence (Avatar Press)|''Providence'']], as well as its sequel ''[[Neonomicon]]'', Moore re-imagines the Lovecraftian mythos while referencing and borrowing heavily from ''The King in Yellow''. The book is referenced by name throughout ''Providence'', as well as referencing a fictional variation ''Sous Le Monde'', French for "Under the World." In both ''Providence'' and its sequel, a recurring character named Johnny Carcosa appears as an avatar/speaker for a Lovecraftian entity, possibly [[Nyarlathotep]] or [[Azathoth]]&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url=https://factsprovidence.wordpress.com/moore-lovecraft-comics-annotation-index/providence-10/ |title=Providence 10 |access-date=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Game designer [[Robin D. Laws]], having written a collection of Chamber-inspired stories entitled ''New Tales of the Yellow Sign'', has converted the story "Repairer of Reputations" for ''[[Trail of Cthulhu]]''. He is currently writing a Yellow King Roleplaying Game, including crossover content for the Cthulhu Mythos.

The "'''Town Musicians of Bremen'''" ({{lang-de|Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten}}) is a popular [[fairy tale]] retrieved and recorded by the [[Brothers Grimm]]. It was first published in [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]] in 1819. It tells the story of four aging domestic animals, who after a lifetime of hard work are neglected and mistreated by their former masters. Eventually, they decide to run away and become town musicians in the city of [[Bremen]]. Contrary to the story's title the characters never arrive in [[Bremen]], as they succeed in tricking and scaring off a band of robbers, capturing their spoils, and moving into their house. According to the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system]], the story qualifies as a ''Type 130'' folktale ("Outcast animals find a new home").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/brementown/other.html | title= Tales Similar To Bremen Town Musicians |author=  | date= | publisher=SurLaLune Fairy Tales| accessdate=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In the story, a [[donkey]], a [[dog]], a [[cat]], and a [[rooster]] (or hen), all past their prime years in life and usefulness on their respective farms, were soon to be discarded or mistreated by their masters. One by one, they leave their homes and set out together. They decide to go to [[Bremen]], known for its freedom, to live without owners and become musicians there ("Something better than death we can find anywhere").

On the way to Bremen, they see a lighted cottage; they look inside and see four robbers enjoying their ill-gotten gains. Standing on each other's backs, they decide to scare the robbers away by making a din; the men run for their lives, not knowing what the strange sound is. The animals take possession of the house, eat a good meal, and settle in for the evening.

Later that night, the robbers return and send one of their members in to investigate. He sees the Cat's eyes shining in the darkness and the robber thinks he is seeing the coals of the fire. He reaches over to light his candle. Things happen in quick succession; the Cat scratches his face with her claws, the Dog bites him on the leg, the Donkey kicks him with his hooves, and the Rooster crows and chases him out the door, screaming. He tells his companions that he was beset by a horrible [[Witchcraft|witch]] who scratched him with her long fingernails (the Cat), an man with a knife (the Dog), a black [[monster]] who had hit him with a club (the Donkey), and worst of all, the [[judge]] who screamed from the rooftop (the Rooster). The robbers abandon the cottage to the strange creatures who have taken it, where the animals live happily for the rest of their days.

In the original version of this story, which dates from the twelfth century, the robbers are a bear, lion, and wolf, all animals featured in heraldric devices. When the donkey and his friends arrive in Bremen, the townsfolk applaud them for having rid the district of the terrible beasts. An alternate version involves the animals' master(s) being deprived of his livelihood (because the thieves stole his money and/or destroyed his farm or mill) and having to send his animals away, unable to take care of them any further. After the animals dispatch the thieves, they take the ill-gotten gains back to their master so he can rebuild. Other versions involve at least one wild, non-livestock animal, such as a [[lizard]], helping the domestic animals out in dispatching the thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://germanstories.vcu.edu/grimm/bremer_dual.html | title= Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten / Bremen Town Musicians |author=  | date= | publisher=German stories| accessdate=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural legacy==
The tale has been retold through [[Animation|animated pictures]], [[motion pictures]] (often [[musical film|musicals]]), theatre plays and operas.

===Screen and stage adaptations===
[[File:Bremenskie muzykanty.jpg|thumb|''[[Town Musicians of Bremen (film)|Town Musicians of Bremen]]'', 1969 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] animated film]]
* German-U.S. composer [[Richard Mohaupt]] created the opera ''Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten'', which premiered in Bremen 1949.
* The tale was adapted in humorous fashion for the British children's series ''[[Wolves, Witches and Giants]]'' narrated by [[Spike Milligan]], but with the action taking place in 'Brum' (short for [[Birmingham]]) rather than Bremen.
* In the Soviet Union, the story was loosely adapted into an animated musical in 1969 by Yuri Entin and [[Vasily Livanov]] at the studio [[Soyuzmultfilm]], ''[[The Bremen Town Musicians (film)|The Bremen Town Musicians]]''. It was followed by a sequel called ''On the Trail of the Town Musicians of Bremen''. In 2000, a second 56-minute sequel was made, called ''The New Bremen Musicians'' ({{lang|ru|Но́вые бре́менские}}, Novyye bremenskiye).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animator.ru/db/?ver=eng&amp;p=show_film&amp;fid=5903 The New Bremen Musicians], Animator.ru&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1976, in Italy, [[Sergio Bardotti]] and [[Luis Enríquez Bacalov]] adapted the story into a musical play called ''I Musicanti'', which two years later was translated into Portuguese by the Brazilian composer [[Chico Buarque]]. The musical play was called ''Os Saltimbancos'', was later released as an album, and became one of the greatest classics for children in Brazil. This version was also made into a movie.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138073/&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Spain]], the story was made into an animated feature film, ''[[Los Trotamúsicos]]'' in 1989, directed by {{Interlanguage link multi|Cruz Delgado|es}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096742/ |title=Los 4 músicos de Bremen (1989) |publisher=IMDb |date= |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in itself inspired the Spanish animated series ''[[Los Trotamúsicos]]''. The series follows the story of four animal friends: ''Koki'' the rooster, ''Lupo'' the dog, ''Burlón'' the cat and ''Tonto'' the donkey; who form a band in the playing respectively guitar, drums, trumpet and saxophone. Unlike in the original story, they arrive to Bremen, before going back to live in the robbers' house.
* In 1972, [[Jim Henson]] produced a version with his [[Muppets]] called ''[[The Muppet Musicians of Bremen]]''.
* In 1981 in Japan, Tezuka Productions made loose science fiction themed animated feature film adaptation titled Bremen 4: Angels in Hell (ブレーメン４ 地獄の中の天使たち/Bremen 4: Jigoku no Naka no Tenshi-tachi)revolving around an Alien visiting Earth, during a military invasion of a fictional Bremen and giving the 4 animals based on the ones from the original tale, a device that can transform them in to humans. Despite being aimed at children the film has a substantial amount of gun violence and depictions of war crimes but its core theme is Anti-war.
* In Germany and the United States, the story was adapted into an animated feature in 1997 under the title ''[[The Fearless Four (film)|The Fearless Four]]'' (''[[:de:Die furchtlosen Vier|Die furchtlosen Vier]]''), though it varied considerably from the source material; while the general plot is the same, the four arrive in Bremen and help to free it from the grasp of the corrupt corporation Mix Max, along with rescuing animals that the company plans to turn into sausage. It starred R&amp;B singer [[James Ingram]] as Buster the dog, guitarist [[B.B. King]] as Fred the donkey, singer and pianist [[Oleta Adams]] as Gwendolyn the cat and Italian musician [[Zucchero Fornaciari]] as Tortellini the Rooster in the original English version. 
* On [[Cartoon Network]] in between cartoon breaks during the ''Out of Tune Toons'' marathon and on Cartoonetwork Video, there are cartoon shorts (called "Wedgies") of an animal garage band based on the tale called ''The Bremen Avenue Experience'' featuring a cat (Jessica), dog (Simon), donkey (Barret) and rooster (Tanner). They are either a modern adaptation of ''Town Musicians of Bremen'' or descendants of the old musicians of Bremen.
* The [[HBO Family]] animated series, ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'', adapted this story in Season 3 and did a country/African-American twist on it featuring [[Jenifer Lewis]] as Hazel (the dog), [[Gladys Knight]] as Chocolate (the donkey), [[Dionne Warwick]] as Miss Kitty (the cat), and [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] as Scratchmo (the rooster).

===Literature===
* [[Richard Scarry]] wrote an adaptation of the story in his book ''Richard Scarry's Animal Nursery Tales'' in 1975. In it, the donkey, dog, cat and rooster set out since they are bored with farming.
* In the visual novel ''Morenatsu'', the dog character Kouya is part of a rock band with three other performers: who are a cat, a bird, and a horse. The protagonist makes note of the resemblance to the Town Musicians of Bremen, with a brief monologue explaining the fairy tale.
* The fourth volume of the comic album series ''[[Blacksad]]'' a mystery unfolds in New Orleans around the remaining members of a defunct musical group formerly composed of a dog, a cat, a rooster, and a donkey, all of whom had migrated to the city from their home on a Southern island.

===Music===
* In the early 20th century, the American folk/swing/children's musician [[Frank Luther]] popularized the musical tale as the ''Raggletaggletown Singers'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://mej.sagepub.com/cgi/content/citation/38/5/48 Sing Alone and like It Music], Charles L. Gary, Educators Journal April/May 1952 38: 48-49&lt;/ref&gt; presented in children's school music books and performed in children's plays.
* In 2015, Japanese rock musician [[Kenshi Yonezu]] released his third album titled ''Bremen'', with the sixth track "Will-O-Wisp"'s lyrics being centred on the Town Musicians of Bremen.
* In 2012, American artists PigPen Theatre Co. released their debut album titled ''Bremen'', with the fifth track "Bremen"'s lyrics telling the story of the Town Musicians of Bremen.
* ''The Musicians of Bremen'' (1972), based on the [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy tale, the "Town Musicians of Bremen", for male voices: two [[Countertenor|countertenors]], tenor, two baritones and bass; premiered by [[King's Singers|The King's Singers]] in Sydney on 15 May 1972.  A recording may be heard here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C57Y7HtiUIE

===Art and sculpture===
[[File:Fort Napoleon034 kopie.jpg|thumb|''[[Persiflage]]'' by Heinrich-Otto Pieper]]
* Statues modeled after the Town Musicians of Bremen statue now reside in front of each of the five [[List of schools of veterinary medicine#Germany|German veterinary schools]]. 
* A [[persiflage]] of this tale can be found on the wall in the Fort Napoleon, [[Ostend]], Belgium. Heinrich-Otto Pieper, a German soldier during World War I, painted the German and the Austro-Hungarian eagles throned on a rock, under the light of a Turkish crescent. They look with contempt on the futile efforts of the Town Musicians of Bremen to chase them away. These animals are symbols for the Allied Forces: on top the French cock, standing on the Japanese jackal, standing on the English bulldog, standing on the Russian bear. Italy is depicted as a twisting snake and Belgium a tricolored [[beetle]].
* A sculpture in [[Riga]] shows the animals breaking through a wall (symbolising the Iron Curtain).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.liveriga.com/en/3123-bremen-town-musicians&lt;/ref&gt;
* A junction in [[Pune]] City of India has been named after Bremen as 'Bremen Chowk' and has sculpture of instrument that four musicians had used.  &lt;ref&gt;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/35-yr-old-transnational-solidarity-forum-downs-shutters-but-bonds-remain/articleshow/47240481.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

|The [[Maury Island]] incident is an early modern UFO encounter incident that happened on June 21, 1947. It allegedly took place shortly after the sighting of the original flying saucers by Kenneth Arnold. It is also one of the earliest reported instances of an alleged encounter with so-called "Men in black suits." Opinions remain divided regarding the case and whether it was genuine or a hoax.

He described the objects as almost blindingly bright when they reflected the sun's rays; their flight as "erratic" ("like the tail of a Chinese kite") and flying at "tremendous speed." Arnold's story was widely carried by the [[Associated Press]] and other news outlets, and is usually credited as the catalyst for modern UFO interest, though many less-publicized UFO incidents preceded it.

|The Roswell UFO Incident involved the recovery of materials near [[Roswell, New Mexico]], in early July 1947 which have since become the subject of intense speculation and research. There are widely divergent views on what actually happened, and passionate debate about what evidence can be believed. The United States military maintains that what was recovered was a top-secret [[research balloon]] that had crashed. However, many UFO proponents believe the wreckage was of a crashed alien craft and that the military covered up the craft's recovery. The incident has evolved into a recognized and referenced pop culture phenomenon, and for some, Roswell is synonymous with the term UFO, and likely ranks as the most famous alleged UFO incident.

Mantell, on January 7, 1948, while in pursuit of a UFO. Historian David Michael Jacobs argues that the Mantell case marked a sharp shift in both public and governmental perceptions of UFOs. Previously, mass media often treated UFO reports with a whimsical or glib attitude reserved for silly season news. Following Mantell's death, however, Jacobs notes "the fact that a person had dramatically died in an encounter with an alleged flying saucer dramatically increased public concern about the phenomenon. Now a dramatic new prospect entered thought about UFO's: they might be not only extraterrestrial but potentially hostile as well." (Jacobs, 45)

|The Chiles-Whitted UFO Encounter is alleged to have occurred on July 24, 1948, when two American commercial pilots reported that their [[Douglas DC-3]] had nearly collided with a strange torpedo shaped object flying near them. It was an important UFO sighting for several reasons: it was perhaps the first that occurred at close distance (allegedly within a few hundred feet); and it was reported by two very experienced pilots, Clarence Chiles and John Whitted. Both pilots had been decorated for their service as airmen during World War II, and both were regarded as valuable, respectable employees of Eastern Airlines. Chiles, in particular, was highly esteemed by his peers and by his employer.  It was a pivotal case for the personnel of the US Air Force's [[Project Sign]], and was a main reason they championed the extraterrestrial hypothesis as the best explanation for UFOs.

|[[2018 Arizona UFO sightings]]
|According to the Federal Aviation Administration, three commercial pilots saw an unidentified object fly over them in open airspace above Arizona. The pilots of a Phoenix Air Learjet 36, an Airbus A321 and American Airlines Flight 1095  radioed-in the sightings minutes from each other. The air traffic controller was unable to verify that any other aircraft in the area at the time, according to the FAA. The odd sightings began around 3:30pm as the Albuquerque Air Traffic Center received reports from several eastbound aircraft that something passed over them at an altitude of 40,000 feet. This incident happened just 500 miles away from historic Roswell, New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fearnow |first1=Benjamin |title=FAA AUDIO: PERPLEXED PILOTS REPORT UFO SIGHTING ABOVE NEW MEXICO, ARIZONA DESERT |url=http://www.newsweek.com/ufo-sighting-new-mexico-arizona-albuquerque-air-traffic-control-american-861975 |website=Tech &amp; Science |publisher=Newsweek |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigator [[Joe Nickell]] researched this sighting and conferred with a former Special Operations pilot [[10036 McGaha|James McGaha]]. They concluded that the shiny object "was relatively stationary" and that a "very bright light source ... during the daytime, it is most likely a reflection of sunlight off an object. After noting the time, and place they concluded that what the pilots saw was mostly likely a "high-altitude research balloon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe|authorlink=Joe Nickell |title=UFO over Arizona Likely an IFO |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=8-9 |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vartan Gregorian''' ({{lang-hy|Վարդան Գրիգորեան}}; {{lang-fa|وارتان گرگوریان}}, born April 8, 1934) is an Iranian-born [[Armenian-American]] academic, serving as the president of [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]].

Gregorian came to the United States in 1956 as a freshman, attending [[Stanford University]], where he completed his B.A., with honors, in two years. After receiving his dual doctorates in history and humanities from Stanford in 1964, Gregorian served on the faculties of several American universities. He taught European and Middle Eastern history at [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]], the [[University of California at Los Angeles]], and the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. In 1972 he joined the [[University of Pennsylvania]] faculty and was appointed Tarzian Professor of History and professor of South Asian history. He was founding dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania in 1974 and four years later became its twenty-third provost until 1981. From 1981 to 1989, Gregorian served as [[List of Presidents of the New York Public Library|president of The New York Public Library]], a post he would hold for eight years.

In 1988, he was chosen to become [[Academic administration|president]] of [[Brown University]], where he served for the next nine years. In 1997, he was appointed president of [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]], the philanthropic foundation created by Andrew Carnegie in 1911. He currently serves as  a trustee of the Aga Khan Museum, the Library of Alexandria, The Hunter Foundation, the National September 11 Memorial and Museum at the World Trade Center, The American Academy in Berlin, and the Patti and Everett B. Biurch Foundation.

In 1986, Gregorian was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor and in 1989 the [https://artsandletters.org/awards/ American Academy of Arts and Letters Award for Distinguished Service to the Arts]. In 1998, President Clinton awarded him the National Humanities Medal. In 2004, President George W. Bush awarded him the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civil award. In 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] appointed him to serve on the President's Commission on [[White House Fellows]]hips. In addition, Gregorian has received the Council on Foundations Distinguished Service Award, 2013; the [https://www.aspeninstitute.org/programs/henry-crown-fellowship/henry-crown-leadership-award/ Aspen Institute's Henry Crown Leadership Award], 2010; the Africa-America Institute Award for Leadership in Higher Education Philanthropy, 2009; and has been honored by various other cultural and professional associations, including the Armenian Cultural Foundation, the Urban League, the League of Women Voters, the Players Club, PEN-American Center, Literacy Volunteers of New York, the American Institute of Architects, the Charles A. Dana Foundation, and the Elysium Between Two Continents. He has been honored by the city and state of New York, the states of Massachusetts, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island, and the cities of Fresno, Austin, Providence and San Francisco and was named a Living Landmark of the City of New York, where he currently resides.

In March 2015, Vartan Gregorian, together with two other philanthropists of Armenian descent, Noubar Afeyan and [[Ruben Vardanyan (businessman)|Ruben Vardanyan]], launched a new humanitarian effort called 100 Lives.

{{quote|The initiative is rooted in next year's centennial of the Armenian Genocide, in which 1.5 million people died at the hands of the Ottoman government between 1915–1923, and one project will be to uncover stories of survivors and people who saved lives during that period.|Excerpt from an article by Don Seifert in the ''Boston Business Journal'', March 11, 2015&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/bioflash/2015/03/flagship-founder-enlists-help-of-george-clooney.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Early life==
Gregorian was born in an [[Iranian Armenians|Armenian]]-Christian community in [[Tabriz, Iran]], to Samuel Gregorian and Shooshanik Mirzaian. When Gregorian was 6 years old, his mother, then 26, died of pneumonia. His father, who worked for the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] in [[Abadan]], was away from home much of the time, and hence Gregorian and his younger sister Ojik were raised by Voski Mirzaian, his maternal grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groong.usc.edu/tcc/tcc-20030616.html |title=Book Review: ''The Road to Home'' by Vartan Gregorian|publisher=Armenian News Network|accessdate=June 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elementary and secondary education===

Gregorian attended elementary school in Iran. In his autobiography, in discussing the events that led to his attending high school in Lebanon, Gregorian refers to several "generous strangers" who helped to make this transformative change in his life possible along with his subsequent move to the United States. First, in 1948, Edgar Maloyan, the French Armenian vice-[[consul (representative)|consul]] in Tabriz at the time, suggested to Gregorian that he ought to go to [[Beirut|Beirut, Lebanon]] to continue his education and provided him with three letters of introduction:&lt;ref name="NEH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2003-09/gregorian.html |title=A Conversation with Vartan Gregorian |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |accessdate=June 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; one to the head of the Lebanese Internal Security Agency, one to the Collège Arménien, the [[Secondary education in France#Lyc.C3.A9e|lycée]] that admitted him as a student, and one to a hotel where he could stay.&lt;ref name="loc-info"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0307-8/gregorian.html |title=Vartan Gregorian Speaks at Library |publisher=''[[Library of Congress]]'' |author=Yvonne French |accessdate=June 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregorian also did chores for another individual in Tabriz, an optometrist named Hrayr Stepanian, who eventually helped Gregorian obtain his passport to get to Lebanon:

{{quote|What also enabled me to do that was that a second stranger, an optometrist in Tabriz, gave me his property deed. That allowed me to obtain a passport because my father had told me if I could get a passport on my own, he would let me go, assuming that no fourteen-year-old kid could get a passport. This optometrist had taken me under his wing.&lt;ref name="NEH"/&gt;|Vartan Gregorian|in an interview with former [[National Endowment for the Humanities|NEH]] Chairman Bruce Cole}}

What Gregorian and his benefactors had not thoroughly planned for was his daily expenses, so after arriving in Beirut, he was confronted with the problem of how to provide for his meals and long-term housing. Once again, he received help: the [[Armenian Red Cross Society]] arranged to provide Gregorian with some of his meals for a monthly cost of U.S. $6.15 and another helpful patron arranged for his lodging. With his circumstances eased somewhat, Gregorian learned French and completed his secondary education at the Collège Arménien in Beirut, where, while a student, he became the assistant to [[Simon Vratzian]], the last prime minister of the pre-Soviet [[First Republic of Armenia|Republic of Armenia]] and then director of the Collège. Vratzian served as Gregorian's mentor and protector, providing him with the advice and assistance that helped Gregorian make arrangements to attend a university in the United States. In 1955, Gregorian, with the assistance of his English teacher, applied to only two universities (the University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford University) and was admitted by both. Stanford's acceptance arrived by airmail months before Berkeley's did by surface mail, at which point Gregorian had already enrolled at Stanford.&lt;ref name="stanmag"&gt;[http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2005/sepoct/features/gregorian.html "The Lionheart"]. ''Stanford Magazine'' (retrieved June 22, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stanford==
Gregorian was twenty-two when he began his undergraduate education at Stanford in 1956. There, [[Wayne S. Vucinich]], who taught the history of the Balkans, Eastern Europe, Byzantium and the Ottoman Empire, became his mentor and advised Gregorian to study history. He completed his B.A. with honors in two years and finished the Humanities Honors program with distinction. His senior thesis for the Humanities Honors Program was on "Toynbee and Islam." In 1958 he was accepted as a Ph.D. candidate in history as well as in the graduate Humanities Program and became a research and teaching assistant to Professor Vucinich. The department awarded him its Wilbur Fellowship. While a student at Stanford, he again received hospitality from members of the Armenian community who were strangers to him. He explains how this consistent benevolence reaffirmed his faith in the [[Armenian diaspora]] community and diaspora communities in general:

{{quote|In Palo Alto, an Armenian family adopted me for all Sunday meals and holidays. All of this reinforced my conviction that diasporas are not ghettos—rather they are connecting bridges to larger communities, be it Jewish, be it Irish, be it Chinese, Armenian, Indian, and so forth. I never realized that until then.&lt;ref name="NEH"/&gt;|Vartan Gregorian|in an interview with former [[National Endowment for the Humanities|NEH]] Chairman Bruce Cole}}

He received his PhD in history and humanities from Stanford in 1964, writing a dissertation entitled "Traditionalism and Modernism in Islam."&lt;ref name="NEH"/&gt; The topic of his dissertation was related to an ongoing research project that he began in 1961, after receiving a [[Ford Foundation]] Foreign Area Training Fellowship, which took him to England, France, Lebanon, Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. These experiences and his related research refocused his thesis on Afghanistan and formed the basis for his first book, ''The Emergence of Modern Afghanistan: Politics of Reform and Modernization, 1840–1946'' (1969, 2013, [[Stanford University Press]]).&lt;ref name="stanmag"/&gt;

==Professorships==
In 1962, Gregorian began teaching European and Middle Eastern history at [[San Francisco State College]] (now San Francisco State University).&lt;ref name=stanmag /&gt; He left San Francisco State in 1968 and for a brief stint served as an associate professor at [[UCLA]]. That same year he joined the faculty of the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where he remained until 1972. He was promoted to full professorship in the Department of History and served as the Director of Special Programs in the College of Arts and Sciences from 1969 to 1971.&lt;ref name=riresolution&gt;[http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/PublicLaws/law97/res97/res97386.html Rhode Island House Resolution 386: Recognizing Gregorian's&amp;#93; Distinguished Academic and Administrative Career]. June 24, 1997. Retrieved September 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregorian resigned in protest the Board of Trustees decision to increase student enrollment and expand the university.

In 1972, he accepted the position of [[Sarkes Tarzian|Tarzian]] Professor of Armenian and Caucasian History and Professor of South Asian history at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], an endowed professorship that allowed him to teach Armenian, South Asian, and European intellectual history.&lt;ref name=NEH /&gt; In 1974, Gregorian was named Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania, the first person to hold this position.&lt;ref name=stanmag /&gt; In 1978, he became Provost, chief academic officer of the university.

In 1980, Gregorian was offered the chancellorship at [[UC Berkeley]], but declined because he had been Provost at Penn for only two years and did not feel it was an appropriate time to leave his post. In 1981, Gregorian resigned as Provost.&lt;ref name=stanmag /&gt; Three years later, the Penn Board of Trustees endowed a professorship and several fellowships in Gregorian's name and awarded him an honorary degree in recognition of his roles as the university's founding Dean of Arts and Sciences and Provost.

==New York Public Library==
Following his stay at Penn, Gregorian found work outside the university walls. The [[New York Public Library]] had suffered budget cuts in the 1970s and, facing a vacancy in its presidency, needed a candidate who could raise money and revitalize the library. After a period of unsuccessful searching, Gregorian was approached. Then library board chairman Andrew Heiskell said of Gregorian: "Out of nowhere, a new candidate appeared. Instinctively I knew he was it."&lt;ref name=stanmag /&gt;

Gregorian arrived in 1981, facing deficits and a deteriorating architecture. Eight years later, the operation budget had doubled, four hundred new employees were hired, the buildings were cleaned and restored, and $327&amp;nbsp;million had been raised, including some $70&amp;nbsp;million in gifts-in-kind from individual collectors and benefactors. Local philanthropists and city leaders agreed that Gregorian restored the NYPL into a cultural landmark. He left the library in 1989, "eager to return to the academic world."&lt;ref name=stanmag /&gt;

==Brown University==
Vartan Gregorian became president of Brown in 1989. During his tenure, he instituted the President's Lecture Series, which brought prominent scholars, leaders, and authors to campus. He presided over the building of a residence quadrangle that now bears his name, and taught senior seminars. His last seminar centered on [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Alexis de Tocqueville's]] ''[[Democracy in America]]''. Each year, he also served as the adviser for nine students. Gregorian led a five-year capital campaign called the Campaign for the Rising Generation, which at the time was the most ambitious capital campaign, not only in Brown's history, but of the state of Rhode Island, as well. The campaign raised some $534 million. By the end of his presidency, Brown's endowment had grown by about 260 percent, passing the $1 billion mark from just under $400 million. Also during his tenure, some 250 general studies courses were established. He received the Graduate Student Council's first endowed Wilson-Deblois Award and the faculty's Rosenberger Medal.

President Gregorian's tenure was marked by increased international prominence for Brown and a significant rise in demand for admission. Equally, the student body grew more diverse than ever. Gregorian informed the Brown community of his resignation on January 7, 1997, and he left Brown in September of that year to assume leadership of Carnegie Corporation of New York. He made and kept a promise to attend the commencement ceremony and shake hands with all undergraduate students who had matriculated during his presidency.

==Carnegie Corporation of New York==
Vartan Gregorian became the twelfth president of [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] in 1997. Notably, Gregorian  is the only naturalized American to head the Corporation and the first chief executive since 1923 to be appointed from outside. When he joined the Corporation, taking on the challenge of heading a philanthropic institution, Gregorian said, "As I had led institutions that were dependent on philanthropy, it was intriguing to enter the field 'from the other side,' especially at a time when interest in philanthropy was blossoming. The challenge of philanthropy is how to contribute to the public good while at the same time assist both the American public and policymakers in understanding the power of philanthropy to effect positive change both in our nation and abroad."&lt;ref&gt;[9] Vartan Gregorian, "Reflections on Encounters With Three Cultures," p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie Corporation is a grantmaking foundation, created by Andrew Carnegie in 1911 with a mandate to support efforts dedicated to "the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and understanding."  Towards that end, in over a century of work, Carnegie Corporation of New York has made grants totaling over $2 billion—more than $1 billion alone in the ten years ended September 30, 2013.  Today, under Gregorian's leadership, the foundation's work incorporates Andrew Carnegie's mandate through an affirmation of its historic role as an [[education foundation]] but also honors Andrew Carnegie's passion for [[international peace]] and the health of American democracy. While Mr. Carnegie's primary aim was to benefit the people of the United States, he later determined to use a portion of the funds for members of the British overseas [[Commonwealth]]. Currently, this area of Corporation grantmaking focuses on selected countries in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4150">'''Yankee ingenuity''' is a [[Cultural stereotype|stereotype]] of inventiveness, technical solutions to practical problems, "know-how," [[Individualism|self-reliance]] and individual enterprise associated with the [[Yankee]]s, who originated in [[New England]] and developed much of the [[industrial revolution in the United States]] after 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene S. Ferguson, "On the Origin and Development of American Mechanical 'know-how'", ''American Studies'' 3.2 (1962): 3–16. [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud/article/viewFile/2075/2034 online]&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotype first appeared in the 19th century. As Mitchell Wilson notes, "Yankee ingenuity and Yankee git-up-and-go did not exist in colonial days."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in  Reynold M. Wik, "Some interpretations of the mechanization of agriculture in the Far West." ''Agricultural History'' (1975): 73–83. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3742110 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yankee ingenuity characterizes an attitude of make-do with materials on hand. It is inventive improvisation, adaptation and overcoming of shortages of materials.

The term 'Yankee ingenuity' originated from the construction of the [[Erie Canal]] across rural [[upstate New York]].{{fact|date=February 2017}} Work began in 1817. The canal opened October 26, 1825.

The term was common worldwide in the wake of [[World War II]], as American forces employed engineering solutions to military problems. Doug Stewart notes of the [[jeep]]: "the spartan, cramped, and unstintingly functional jeep became the ubiquitous World War II four-wheeled personification of Yankee ingenuity and cocky, can-do determination."&lt;ref&gt;Doug Stewart, "Hail to the jeep! Could we have won without it?" ''Smithsonian'' (1992) 23#8 pp 60–69&lt;/ref&gt; Today it refers broadly to a typically American pragmatic approach to problem solving instead of traditional methods.

In the original plan for cutting the canal, owners of the land to be crossed were required to be involved in a complicated process involving cooperation with individuals who didn't know the lay of the land and who were often not present. In this wild, undeveloped place, legal responsibilities for construction were imposed upon involved property owners. Citified strangers enforced the contract. Fines were frequently levied. There was a timetable that seemed unbelievably inadequate. In the first year of construction came the realization: The contractors had a total mess on their hands. Very little had been accomplished. The land was far more rugged than had been realized. Work stopped for the winter.

As soon as work could begin in the spring the property owners took matters into their own hands. Funding had been appropriated. Instead of waiting for the engineers and work crews to arrive from Albany, the farmers put their animals and sons to work. If there was an unmovable object, they plowed around it. They went around, not through, hills and precipices, always returning to the general routing. Changing the course of the canal was a good idea to the pragmatists who knew the land. The work was done with zeal, for all citizens realized the canal would bring great prosperity to the area. Neighbors whose land was not crossed came to help. Hardscrabble land would become valuable. Opportunities to make money would be unlimited.

It was not unusual for a government work crew to arrive, tired from the journey, to find a completed section filling with water from the spring runoff. Of course, as work progressed many reports were filed by many people. In one report one individual described the work of the maverick farmers as "Yankee ingenuity". The coinage went into immediate, widespread use as it captured so well the reality of life in the rural areas. The farmers were admired; elevated as fine examples of how Americans would cooperate with each other but brook no interference from each other either.

'''Jean Paul Louis François Édouard Leuge-Dulaurier''' (29 January 1807 – 21 December 1881) was a French [[oriental studies|Orientalist]], [[Armenian studies]] scholar and [[Egyptologist]].&lt;ref&gt;Polybiblion: Gustave Pawlowski, Société bibliographique (France), Henri Stein - 1882- Volume 34 - Page 171 "M. Jean-Paul-Louis-François-Édouard Dulaurier, membre de l'Institut, est mort à Meudou le 21 décembre 1881. Il était né à Toulouse le 29 janvier 1807. Il s'adonna de bonne heure aux études philologiques et possédait la plupart des ... "&lt;/ref&gt;

Dulaurier was born in [[Toulouse]].  He succeeded Paul Émile Levaillant de Florival, on the former's death in 1862, as professor of the [[Armenian language]] at the [[Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales|Ecole spéciale des Langues orientales]].&lt;ref&gt;Deux Mondes Numéros 10 à 12  "Les Arméniens de la Turquie et les massacres du Taurus Levaillant de Florival (1800-1862), professeur d'arménien à l'École des langues orientales, et son successeur, Édouard Dulaurier (1807-1881),"&lt;/ref&gt; He also established the chair for the [[Malay language]]. He was also a member of the [[Institut de France]] (Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres).  He died in [[Meudon]].

Dulaurier was a major contributor to the ''[[Recueil des historiens des croisades]]'', for the part related to Armenian sources which he edited and translated into French. This work is still considered a major source of the period and is available online.
