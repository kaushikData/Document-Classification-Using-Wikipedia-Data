'''Agnes Ermina Wells''', Ph.D. (January 4, 1876, Saginaw, Michigan – July 6, 1959) was an American educator and a [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's equal rights movement]] activist. She was Dean of Women at [[Indiana University]] and [[Professor of Mathematics|professor of mathematics]] and astronomy there.

==Early life and education==
Wells was born in [[Saginaw, Michigan]] on January 4, 1876.&lt;ref name="Harvard" /&gt; She had a sister Florence and a brother Ben.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/105723540/?terms=Agnes%2BWells%2BIndiana%2BUniversity |title= Miss Agnes E.

She attended the Arthur Hill High School&lt;ref name="Harvard" /&gt; and she then spent one year at the Saginaw County Training School for Teachers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Saginaw Hall of Fame: Biographical Sketches|author= Edward W. J. Miller|publisher=Saginaw County Bicentennial Commission, Saginaw County Bicentennial Commission|year=1976|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another in [[Dresden]], Germany, where she studied the German language and music. She studied at [[Bryn Mawr College]] before transferring to the [[University of Michigan]], where she studied mathematics and graduated in 1903. In 1916, she earned her Master of Arts degree from [[Carleton College]] in Minnesota, where her field of study was astronomy.&lt;ref name="Harvard" /&gt; After completing her dissertation on ''A Study of the Relative Proper Motions and Radial Velocities of Stars in the Pleiades Group'', she received her Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Michigan in 1924.&lt;ref name="Harvard" /&gt;

==Career==
Wells first worked as an educator in [[Crystal Falls, Michigan|Crystal Falls]] in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where she was a high school principal for the 1904 to 1905 school year.&lt;ref name="WWD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Proceedings" /&gt; She then worked at Duluth High School in Minnesota as a mathematics teacher. From 1907 to 1914, she was the head of the mathematics department. While working on her master's degree, she was an instructor at Carleton College.&lt;ref name="Proceedings" /&gt;

In 1917, she was a faculty member and during the summers she was dean of women at the University of Michigan in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]].&lt;ref name="WWD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Proceedings" /&gt; At the Helen Newberry Residence, she was the social director.&lt;ref name="Proceedings" /&gt; She then went to Indiana University and taught mathematics&lt;ref name="IS" /&gt; and was the dean of women beginning in 1919.&lt;ref name="WWD"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://womenwhodared.omeka.net/items/show/61|title=Saginaw Hall of Fame, Biographical Sketches|author1=Ed Miller|author2=Jean Beach|publisher=The Saginaw Hall of Fame|year=2000|via=Women Who Dare, site by historian Amy French of Delta College in University Center, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Proceedings" /&gt;  Wells provided guidance to female students and assisted with them housing,&lt;ref name="Harvard" /&gt; as well as being credited with establishing the dormitory system at the school. In 1924, she became a member of the [[Indiana Academy of Science]],&lt;ref name="Proceedings"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/proceedingsofin691959indi#page/48/mode/2up/search/Agnes|title=Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science|volume=69|year=1959|publisher=Indiana Academy of Science|pages=49–50|accessdate=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that year also began to teach astronomy courses.&lt;ref name="Ogilvie"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marilyn Ogilvie|author2=Joy Harvey|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science: Pioneering Lives From Ancient Times to the Mid-20th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUCUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT660|date=16 December 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-96343-9|page=1362}}&lt;/ref&gt; She retired as the dean of women in 1938, and she taught mathematics and astronomy at the university from that point until 1944.&lt;ref name="Proceedings" /&gt; The Agnes E. Wells quadrangle at Indiana University comprises four buildings: Morrison Hall, Sycamore Hall, Memorial Hall, and Goodbody Hall, all built between 1925 and 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Biographical Sketches|author1= Ed Miller|author2=Jean R.

For the [[American Association of University Women]], she established a fellowship fund in the amount of $1 million.&lt;ref name="WWD" /&gt;

Wells was active in many clubs and organizations. She helped found chapters of the [[Mortar Board]] for senior women at both University of Michigan and Indiana University.&lt;ref name="Proceedings" /&gt; She was a member [[Dean of women#History|American Association of Deans of Women]], Michigan State Society, [[National Education Association]], [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] and [[Phi Beta Kappa]].&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch00957 |title=Wells, Agnes Ermina, 1876-1959.

Prof '''Alexander Christison''' [[FRSE]] (1753-1820) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] educator and mathematician of influence during the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].

==Life==
He was born in 1753, at Redpath House, [[Longformacus]], [[Berwickshire]]. After a local education he began employment as the local schoolteacher before being inspired to attend the [[University of Edinburgh]] to study Classics, graduating in 1775. This background gave him access to teach at a higher calibre of school and he taught both at [[George Watson’s College]], [[Dalkeith Grammar School]] and the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh|High School in Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1780s he lived at Alexander's Land in the Bristo area.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1784-1785&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prince Baldassarre Boncompagni-Ludovisi''' (10 May 1821 &amp;ndash; 13 April 1894), was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[historian]] of [[mathematics]] and aristocrat.

==Biography==
Boncompagni was born in [[Rome]], into an ancient noble and wealthy Roman family, the [[Ludovisi (family)|Ludovisi]]-[[Boncompagni]], as the third son of Prince Luigi Boncompagni Ludovisi and Princess Maria Maddalena [[Odescalchi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Balthasar Boncompagni}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied under the mathematician [[Barnabas Dotterel]] and astronomer [[Ignazio Calandrelli]], developing an interest in the [[history of science]]. In 1847 [[Pope Pius IX]] appointed him a member of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]]. Between 1850-1862 he produced studies on mathematicians of the [[Middle Ages]] and in 1868 founded the ''[[Bullettino di bibliografia e di storia delle scienze matematiche e fisiche]]''. After the annexation of the [[Papal States]] into the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] (1870), he refused further participation in the new Academy of the Lincei, and did not accept the appointment as Senator of the Kingdom offered by [[Quintino Sella]]. He did, however, serve as a member of several other Italian and foreign academies.

Boncompagni edited ''Bullettino di bibliografia e di storia delle scienze matematiche e fisiche'' ("The bulletin of bibliography and history of mathematical and physical sciences") (1868–1887), the first Italian periodical entirely dedicated to the [[history of mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Mazzotti (2000): [http://www.ex.ac.uk/~mmazzott/paper01.pdf ''For science and for the Pope-king: writing the history of the exact sciences in nineteenth-century Rome''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040103194421/http://www.ex.ac.uk/~mmazzott/paper01.pdf |date=2004-01-03 }}, [[The British Journal for the History of Science|BJHS]], 33, pp. 257–282&lt;/ref&gt; He edited every article that appeared in the journal.&lt;ref&gt;A. Favaro, `Don Baldassarre Boncompagni e la storia delle scienze matematiche e fisiche ', Atti del Regio Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti (1894–5), 6, pp. 509–21, 514, cited in Massimo Mazzotti (2000): [http://www.ex.ac.uk/~mmazzott/paper01.pdf ''For science and for the Pope-king: writing the history of the exact sciences in nineteenth-century Rome''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040103194421/http://www.ex.ac.uk/~mmazzott/paper01.pdf |date=2004-01-03 }}, [[British Journal for the History of Science|BJHS]], 33, pp. 257–282&lt;/ref&gt; He also prepared and published the first modern edition of [[Fibonacci]]'s ''[[Liber Abaci]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4011">'''Cavity quantum electrodynamics''' ('''cavity QED''') is the study of the interaction between light confined in a reflective [[Optical cavity|cavity]] and [[atom]]s or other particles, under conditions where the quantum nature of light [[photon]]s is significant.  It could in principle be used to construct a [[quantum computer]].

The case of a single 2-level atom in the cavity is mathematically described by the [[Jaynes-Cummings model]], and undergoes [[vacuum Rabi oscillation]]s &lt;math&gt;|e\rangle|n-1\rangle\leftrightarrow|g\rangle|n\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, that is between an excited atom and n-1 photons, and a ground state atom and n photons.

If the cavity is in resonance with the atomic transition, a half-cycle of oscillation starting with no photons coherently swaps the atom qubit's state onto the cavity field's, &lt;math&gt;(\alpha|g\rangle+\beta|e\rangle)|0\rangle\leftrightarrow|g\rangle(\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;, and can be repeated to swap it back again; this could be used as a single photon source (starting with an excited atom), or as an interface between an atom or [[trapped ion quantum computer]] and optical [[quantum communication]].

Other interaction durations create [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] between the atom and cavity field; for example, a quarter-cycle on resonance starting from &lt;math&gt;|e\rangle|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; gives the [[maximally entangled state]] (a [[Bell state]]) &lt;math&gt;(|e\rangle|0\rangle+|g\rangle|1\rangle)/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  This can in principle be used as a [[quantum computer]], mathematically equivalent to a [[trapped ion quantum computer]] with cavity photons replacing phonons.

==Nobel Prize in Physics==
The [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|2012 Nobel Prize for Physics]] was awarded to [[Serge Haroche]] and [[David Wineland]] for their work on controlling quantum systems.&lt;ref name=HJon&gt;{{cite news |first=Hamish |last=Johnston |date=9 October 2012 |title=Quantum-control pioneers bag 2012 Nobel Prize for Physics |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2012/oct/09/quantum-control-pioneers-bag-2012-nobel-prize-for-physics |work=[[Physics World]] |accessdate=2013-10-09 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haroche was born 1944 in Casablanca, Morocco, and in 1971 gained a PhD from Université Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris. He shares half of the prize for developing a new field called cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) – whereby the properties of an atom are controlled by placing it in an optical or microwave cavity. Haroche focused on microwave experiments and turned the technique on its head – using CQED to control the properties of individual photons. &lt;ref name=HJon/&gt;

In a series of ground-breaking experiments, Haroche used CQED to realize Schrödinger's famous cat experiment in which a system is in a superposition of two very different quantum states until a measurement is made on the system. Such states are extremely fragile, and the techniques developed to create and measure CQED states are now being applied to the development of quantum computers.

The '''Chern Medal''' is an international award recognizing outstanding lifelong achievement of the highest level in the field of [[mathematics]]. The prize is given at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM), which is held every four years.

==Introduction==
It is named in honor of the late Chinese mathematician [[Shiing-Shen Chern]]. The award is a joint effort of the [[International Mathematical Union]] (IMU) and the '''Chern Medal Foundation''' (CMF) to be bestowed in the same fashion as the IMU's other three awards (the [[Fields Medal]], the [[Nevanlinna Prize]], and the [[Gauss Prize]]), i.e. at the opening ceremony of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM), which is held every four years. The first such occasion was at the 2010 ICM in [[Hyderabad, India]].&lt;ref name="Chern Medal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mathunion.org/general/prizes/chern/details/ |title=Chern Medal Award |publisher=[[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM) |year=2010 |accessdate=Aug 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825071850/http://www.mathunion.org/general/prizes/chern/details# |archive-date=2010-08-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each recipient receives a medal decorated with Chern's likeness, a cash prize of $250,000 ([[USD]]), and the opportunity to direct $250,000 of charitable donations to one or more organizations for the purpose of supporting research, education, or outreach in mathematics.&lt;ref name="Chern Medal"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10014">A '''computer-assisted proof''' is a [[mathematical proof]] that has been at least partially generated by [[computer]].

Most computer-aided proofs to date have been implementations of large [[Proof by exhaustion|proofs-by-exhaustion]] of a mathematical [[theorem]]. The idea is to use a computer program to perform lengthy computations, and to provide a proof that the result of these computations implies the given theorem.  In 1976, the [[four color theorem]] was the first major theorem to be verified using a [[computer program]].

Attempts have also been made in the area of [[artificial intelligence]] research to create smaller, explicit, new proofs of mathematical theorems from the bottom up using [[machine reasoning]] techniques such as [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] search. Such [[automated theorem prover]]s have proved a number of new results and found new proofs for known theorems.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}  Additionally, interactive [[proof assistant]]s allow mathematicians to develop human-readable proofs which are nonetheless formally verified for correctness.  Since these proofs are generally [[Non-surveyable proof|human-surveyable]] (albeit with difficulty, as with the proof of the [[Robbins conjecture]]) they do not share the controversial implications of computer-aided proofs-by-exhaustion.

== Methods ==
One method for using computers in mathematical proofs is by means of so-called [[validated numerics]] or [[rigorous numerics]]. This means computing numerically yet with mathematical rigour. One uses set-valued arithmetic and inclusion principle in order to ensure that the set-valued output of a numerical program encloses the solution of the original mathematical problem. This is done by controlling, enclosing and propagating round-off and truncation errors using for example [[interval arithmetic]]. More precisely, one reduces the computation to a sequence of elementary operations, say &lt;math&gt;(+,-,*,/)&lt;/math&gt;. In a computer, the result of each elementary operation is rounded off by the computer precision. However, one can construct an interval provided by upper and lower bounds on the result of an elementary operation. Then one proceeds by replacing numbers with intervals and  performing  elementary operations between such intervals of representable numbers.

==Philosophical objections==
{{main|Non-surveyable proof}}
Computer-assisted proofs are the subject of some controversy in the mathematical world, with [[Thomas Tymoczko]] first to articulate objections. Those who adhere to Tymoczko's arguments believe that lengthy computer-assisted proofs are not, in some sense, 'real' [[mathematical proof]]s because they involve so many logical steps that they are not practically [[Verification and validation|verifiable]] by human beings, and that mathematicians are effectively being asked to replace logical deduction from assumed axioms with trust in an empirical computational process, which is potentially affected by errors in the computer program, as well as defects in the runtime environment and hardware.&lt;ref name="tymoczko"&gt;{{Citation|last = Tymoczko|first = Thomas|author-link = Thomas Tymoczko|title = The Four-Color Problem and its Mathematical Significance|year = 1979|journal = [[The Journal of Philosophy]]|volume = 76|issue = 2|pages = 57–83|doi=10.2307/2025976}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other mathematicians believe that lengthy computer-assisted proofs should be regarded as ''calculations'', rather than ''proofs'': the proof algorithm itself should be proved valid, so that its use can then be regarded as a mere "verification".  Arguments that computer-assisted proofs are subject to errors in their source programs, compilers, and hardware can be resolved by providing a formal proof of correctness for the computer program (an approach which was successfully applied to the four-color theorem in 2005) as well as replicating the result using different programming languages, different compilers, and different computer hardware.

Another possible way of verifying computer-aided proofs is to generate their reasoning steps in a machine-readable form, and then use an [[automated theorem prover]] to demonstrate their correctness. This approach of using a computer program to prove another program correct does not appeal to computer proof skeptics, who see it as adding another layer of complexity without addressing the perceived need for human understanding.

Another argument against computer-aided proofs is that they lack [[mathematical elegance]]—that they provide no insights or new and useful concepts.  In fact, this is an argument that could be advanced against any lengthy proof by exhaustion.

An additional philosophical issue raised by computer-aided proofs is whether they make mathematics into a [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics|quasi-empirical science]], where the [[scientific method]] becomes more important than the application of pure reason in the area of abstract mathematical concepts. This directly relates to the argument within mathematics as to whether mathematics is based on ideas, or "merely" an [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]] in formal symbol manipulation. It also raises the question whether, if according to the [[mathematical Platonism|Platonist]] view, all possible mathematical objects in some sense "already exist", whether computer-aided mathematics is an [[observational study|observational]] science like astronomy, rather than an experimental one like physics or chemistry. This controversy within mathematics is occurring at the same time as questions are being asked in the physics community about whether twenty-first century [[theoretical physics]] is becoming too mathematical, and leaving behind its experimental roots.

The emerging field of [[experimental mathematics]] is confronting this debate head-on by focusing on numerical experiments as its main tool for mathematical exploration.

==Theorems for sale==
In 2010, academics at The [[University of Edinburgh]] offered people the chance to "buy their own theorem" created through a computer-assisted proof. This new theorem would be named after the purchaser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herald Gazette article on buying your own theorem|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/education/your-own-maths-theorem-for-15-1.1068654|work=Herald Gazette Scotland|date=November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121000707/http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/education/your-own-maths-theorem-for-15-1.1068654|archivedate=2010-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School of Informatics, Univ.of Edinburgh website|url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/recentnews/theorem|work=School of Informatics, Univ.of Edinburgh|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''discrete Fourier transform''' ('''DFT''') converts a finite sequence of equally-spaced [[Sampling (signal processing)|samples]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] into a same-length sequence of equally-spaced samples of the [[discrete-time Fourier transform]] (DTFT), which is a [[complex number|complex-valued]] function of frequency. The interval at which the DTFT is sampled is the reciprocal of the duration of the input sequence.  An inverse DFT is a [[Fourier series]], using the DTFT samples as coefficients of [[complex number|complex]] [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]s at the corresponding DTFT frequencies.  It has the same sample-values as the original input sequence.  The DFT is therefore said to be a [[frequency domain]] representation of the original input sequence.  If the original sequence spans all the non-zero values of a function, its DTFT is continuous (and periodic), and the DFT provides discrete samples of one cycle.  If the original sequence is one cycle of a periodic function, the DFT provides all the non-zero values of one DTFT cycle.

The DFT is the most important [[discrete transform]], used to perform [[Fourier analysis]] in many practical applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strang|first=Gilbert|title=Wavelets|journal=American Scientist|date=May–June 1994|volume=82|issue=3|pages=250–255|jstor=29775194|quote=This is the most important numerical algorithm of our lifetime...}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[digital signal processing]], the function is any quantity or [[signal (information theory)|signal]] that varies over time, such as the pressure of a [[sound wave]], a [[radio]] signal, or daily [[temperature]] readings, sampled over a finite time interval (often defined by a [[window function]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sahidullah|first=Md.|author2=Saha, Goutam|title=A Novel Windowing Technique for Efficient Computation of MFCC for Speaker Recognition|journal=IEEE Signal Processing Letters|date=Feb 2013|volume=20|issue=2|pages=149–152|doi=10.1109/LSP.2012.2235067|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6387265&amp;isnumber=6380557|arxiv = 1206.2437 |bibcode = 2013ISPL...20..149S }}&lt;/ref&gt;). In [[image processing]], the samples can be the values of [[pixel]]s along a row or column of a [[raster image]]. The DFT is also used to efficiently solve [[partial differential equations]], and to perform other operations such as [[convolution]]s or multiplying large integers.

Since it deals with a finite amount of data, it can be implemented in [[computer]]s by [[numerical algorithm]]s or even dedicated [[digital circuit|hardware]]. These implementations usually employ efficient [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) algorithms;&lt;ref name=colley&gt;Cooley et al., 1969&lt;/ref&gt; so much so that the terms "FFT" and "DFT" are often used interchangeably.  Prior to its current usage, the "FFT" [[initialism]] may have also been used for the ambiguous term "[[Finite Fourier transform (disambiguation)|finite Fourier transform]]".

==Definition==
The ''discrete Fourier transform'' transforms a [[sequence]] of ''N'' [[complex number]]s &lt;math&gt;   \left \{ \mathbf{ x_n } \right \} := x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; into another sequence of complex numbers,  &lt;math&gt;\left \{ \mathbf{X_k} \right \} := X_0, X_1, \ldots, X_{N-1},&lt;/math&gt; which is defined by

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
X_k &amp;= \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n\cdot e^{-\frac {2\pi i}{N}kn}\\
&amp;= \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n\cdot [\cos(2 \pi k n / N) - i\cdot \sin(2 \pi k n / N)],
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}
where the last expression follows from the first one by [[Euler's formula]].

The transform is sometimes denoted by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, as in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = \mathcal{F} \left \{ \mathbf{x} \right \} &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F} \left ( \mathbf{x} \right )&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F} \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As a [[linear transformation]] on a [[Dimension (vector space)|finite-dimensional vector space]], the DFT expression can also be written in terms of a [[DFT matrix]]; when scaled appropriately it becomes a [[unitary matrix]] and the ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; can thus be viewed as coefficients of ''x'' in an [[orthonormal basis]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
{{EquationNote|Eq.1}} can also be evaluated outside the domain &lt;math&gt;k \in [0,N-1]&lt;/math&gt;, and that extended sequence is &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-[[periodic sequence|periodic]]. Accordingly, other sequences of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; indices are sometimes used,  such as &lt;math&gt;[-N/2,N/2-1]&lt;/math&gt; (if &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is even) and &lt;math&gt;[-(N-1)/2,(N-1)/2]&lt;/math&gt; (if &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is odd), which amounts to swapping the left and right halves of the result of the transform.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shift zero-frequency component to center of spectrum – MATLAB fftshift|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fftshift.html|website=mathworks.com|publisher=The MathWorks, Inc.|accessdate=10 March 2014|location=Natick, MA 01760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{EquationNote|Eq.1}} can be interpreted or derived in various ways, for example:
*It completely describes the [[discrete-time Fourier transform]] (DTFT) of an &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-periodic sequence, which comprises only discrete frequency components.  ([[Discrete-time Fourier transform#Periodic data|Using the DTFT with periodic data]])
*It can also provide uniformly spaced samples of the continuous DTFT of a finite length sequence.  ([[Discrete-time Fourier transform#Sampling the DTFT|Sampling the DTFT]])
*It is the [[cross correlation]] of the ''input'' sequence, &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt;, and a complex sinusoid at frequency &lt;math&gt;k/N&lt;/math&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Thus it acts like a [[matched filter]] for that frequency.
*It is the discrete analogy of the formula for the coefficients of a [[Fourier series]]:

{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;x_n = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_k \cdot e^{i 2 \pi k n / N},  \quad n\in\mathbb{Z},\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}

:which is also &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-periodic.&amp;nbsp; In the domain &amp;nbsp;{{math|''n'' ∈ [0,&amp;nbsp;''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1]}},&amp;nbsp; this is the '''inverse transform''' of {{EquationNote|Eq.1}}.&amp;nbsp; In this interpretation, each &lt;math&gt;X_k&lt;/math&gt; is a complex number that encodes both amplitude and phase of a complex sinusoidal component &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(e^{i 2 \pi k n / N})&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; of function &lt;math&gt;x_n.&lt;/math&gt;  The sinusoid's [[frequency]] is ''k'' cycles per ''N'' samples.&amp;nbsp; Its amplitude and phase are:

::&lt;math&gt;|X_k|/N = \sqrt{\operatorname{Re}(X_k)^2 + \operatorname{Im}(X_k)^2}/N&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\arg(X_k) = \operatorname{atan2}\big( \operatorname{Im}(X_k), \operatorname{Re}(X_k) \big)=-i\cdot \operatorname{ln}\left(\frac{X_k}{|X_k|}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:where [[atan2]] is the two-argument form of the [[arctan]] function. In polar form &lt;math&gt;X_k = |X_k| e^{i \arg(X_k)} = |X_k| \operatorname{cis} \arg(X_k)&lt;/math&gt; where [[Cis (mathematics)|cis]] is the mnemonic for cos + i sin.

The normalization factor multiplying the DFT and IDFT (here 1 and 1/''N'') and the signs of the exponents are merely [[sign convention|conventions]], and differ in some treatments. The only requirements of these conventions are that the DFT and IDFT have opposite-sign exponents and that the product of their normalization factors be &lt;math&gt;1/N&lt;/math&gt;. &amp;nbsp;A normalization of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt{1/N}&lt;/math&gt; for both the DFT and IDFT, for instance, makes the transforms unitary. A discrete impulse, &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; = 1 at n = 0 and 0 otherwise; might transform to &lt;math&gt;X_k&lt;/math&gt; = 1 for all k (use normalization factors 1 for DFT and 1/''N'' for IDFT). A DC signal, &lt;math&gt;X_k&lt;/math&gt; = 1 at k = 0 and 0 otherwise; might inversely transform to &lt;math&gt;x_n=1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (use &lt;math&gt;1/N&lt;/math&gt; for DFT and 1 for IDFT) which is consistent with viewing [[Direct current|DC]] as the [[Mean#Arithmetic mean (AM)|mean average]] of the signal.

==Example==
Let &lt;math&gt;N=4&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} =
\begin{pmatrix}
x_0 \\
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
x_3
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
2-i \\
-i \\
-1+2i
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here we demonstrate how to calculate the DFT of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; using {{EquationNote|Eq.1}}:

&lt;math&gt;X_0 = e^{-i 2 \pi 0 \cdot 0 / 4} \cdot 1 + e^{-i 2 \pi 0 \cdot 1 / 4} \cdot (2-i) + e^{-i 2 \pi 0 \cdot 2 / 4} \cdot (-i) + e^{-i 2 \pi 0 \cdot 3 / 4} \cdot (-1+2i) = 2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;X_1 = e^{-i 2 \pi 1 \cdot 0 / 4} \cdot 1 + e^{-i 2 \pi 1 \cdot 1 / 4} \cdot (2-i) + e^{-i 2 \pi 1 \cdot 2 / 4} \cdot (-i) + e^{-i 2 \pi 1 \cdot 3 / 4} \cdot (-1+2i) = -2-2i&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;X_2 = e^{-i 2 \pi 2 \cdot 0 / 4} \cdot 1 + e^{-i 2 \pi 2 \cdot 1 / 4} \cdot (2-i) + e^{-i 2 \pi 2 \cdot 2 / 4} \cdot (-i) + e^{-i 2 \pi 2 \cdot 3 / 4} \cdot (-1+2i) = -2i&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;X_3 = e^{-i 2 \pi 3 \cdot 0 / 4} \cdot 1 + e^{-i 2 \pi 3 \cdot 1 / 4} \cdot (2-i) + e^{-i 2 \pi 3 \cdot 2 / 4} \cdot (-i) + e^{-i 2 \pi 3 \cdot 3 / 4} \cdot (-1+2i) = 4+4i&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} =
\begin{pmatrix}
X_0 \\
X_1 \\
X_2 \\
X_3
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
2 \\
-2-2i \\
-2i \\
4+4i
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==

===Completeness===
The discrete Fourier transform is an invertible, [[linear transformation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\colon\mathbb{C}^N \to \mathbb{C}^N&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; denoting the set of [[complex number]]s. In other words, for any &lt;math&gt;N&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, an ''N''-dimensional complex vector has a DFT and an IDFT which are in turn ''N''-dimensional complex vectors.

The inverse transform is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
x_n = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_k\cdot e^{i 2 \pi k n / N}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Orthogonality ===
The vectors &lt;math&gt;u_k=\left[ e^{ \frac{2\pi i}{N} kn} \;|\; n=0,1,\ldots,N-1 \right]^T&lt;/math&gt; 
form an [[orthogonal basis]] over the set of ''N''-dimensional complex vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;u^T_k u_{k'}^* 
 = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \left(e^{ \frac{2\pi i}{N} kn}\right) \left(e^{\frac{2\pi i}{N} (-k')n}\right)
 = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} e^{ \frac{2\pi i}{N} (k-k') n} 
 = N~\delta_{kk'}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;~\delta_{kk'}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]]. (In the last step, the summation is trivial if &lt;math&gt;k=k'&lt;/math&gt;, where it is 1+1+⋅⋅⋅=''N'', and otherwise is a [[geometric series]] that can be explicitly summed to obtain zero.)  This orthogonality condition can be used to derive the formula for the IDFT from the definition of the DFT, and is equivalent to the unitarity property below.

=== The Plancherel theorem and Parseval's theorem ===
If &lt;math&gt;X_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_k&lt;/math&gt; are the DFTs of &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_n&lt;/math&gt; respectively then the [[Parseval's theorem]] states:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n y^*_n = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_k Y^*_k&lt;/math&gt;

where the star denotes [[Complex conjugate|complex conjugation]].  [[Plancherel theorem]] is a special case of the Parseval's theorem and states:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} |x_n|^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |X_k|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

These theorems are also equivalent to the unitary condition below.

===Periodicity===
The periodicity can be shown directly from the definition:

: &lt;math&gt;X_{k+N} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \ \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{N} (k+N) n} =
\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{N} k n}  \underbrace{e^{-2 \pi i n}}_{1} = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{N} k n} = X_k. &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, it can be shown that the IDFT formula leads to a periodic extension.

===Shift theorem===
Multiplying &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; by a ''linear phase'' &lt;math&gt;e^{\frac{2\pi i}{N}n m}&lt;/math&gt; for some integer ''m'' corresponds to a ''circular shift'' of the output &lt;math&gt;X_k&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;X_k&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;X_{k-m}&lt;/math&gt;, where the subscript is interpreted [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''N'' (i.e., periodically).  Similarly, a circular shift of the input &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to multiplying the output &lt;math&gt;X_k&lt;/math&gt; by a linear phase. Mathematically, if &lt;math&gt;\{x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; represents the vector '''x''' then

:if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(\{x_n\})_k=X_k&lt;/math&gt;

:then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(\{ x_n\cdot e^{\frac{2\pi i}{N}n m} \})_k=X_{k-m}&lt;/math&gt;

:and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(\{x_{n-m}\})_k=X_k\cdot e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{N}k m}&lt;/math&gt;

===Circular convolution theorem and cross-correlation theorem===
{{anchor|Circular convolution theorem}}
{{anchor|Cross-correlation theorem}}

The [[DTFT#Convolution|convolution theorem]] for the [[discrete-time Fourier transform]] indicates that a convolution of two infinite sequences can be obtained as the inverse transform of the product of the individual transforms. An important simplification occurs when the sequences are of finite length, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.  In terms of the DFT and inverse DFT, it can be written as follows''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{F}^{-1} \left \{ \mathbf{X\cdot Y} \right \}_n \ = \sum_{l=0}^{N-1}x_l \cdot (y_N)_{n-l} \ \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \ \ (\mathbf{x * y_N})_n\ ,
&lt;/math&gt;

which is the convolution of the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; sequence with a &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; sequence extended by [[periodic summation]]''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{y_N})_n \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \ \sum_{p=-\infty}^{\infty} y_{(n-pN)} = y_{n (\text{mod } N)}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the [[cross-correlation]] of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y_N}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; is given by''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{F}^{-1} \left \{ \mathbf{X^* \cdot Y} \right \}_n
= \sum_{l=0}^{N-1}x_l^* \cdot (y_N)_{n+l} \ \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \ \ (\mathbf{x \star y_N})_n\ .
&lt;/math&gt;

When either sequence contains a string of zeros, of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;L+1&lt;/math&gt; of the circular convolution outputs are equivalent to values of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x * y}.&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; Methods have also been developed to use this property as part of an efficient process that constructs &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x * y}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; with an &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; sequence potentially much longer than the practical transform size (&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;). Two such methods are called [[overlap-save method|overlap-save]] and [[overlap-add method|overlap-add]].&lt;ref&gt;T. G. Stockham, Jr., "[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1464209 High-speed convolution and correlation]," in 1966 ''Proc. AFIPS Spring Joint Computing Conf.'' Reprinted in Digital Signal Processing, L. R. Rabiner and C. M. Rader, editors, New York: IEEE Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;  The efficiency results from the fact that a direct evaluation of either summation (above) requires &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle O(N^2)&lt;/math&gt; operations for an output sequence of length &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. &amp;nbsp;An indirect method, using transforms, can take advantage of the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle O(N\log N)&lt;/math&gt; efficiency of the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) to achieve much better performance.  Furthermore, convolutions can be used to efficiently compute DFTs via [[Rader's FFT algorithm]] and [[Bluestein's FFT algorithm]].

=== Convolution theorem duality ===

It can also be shown that''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{F} \left \{ \mathbf{x\cdot y} \right \}_k \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}
\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \cdot y_n \cdot e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{N} k n}
&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{N} (\mathbf{X * Y_N})_k, \,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; which is the circular convolution of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Trigonometric interpolation polynomial===
The [[trigonometric interpolation polynomial]]
:&lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;p(t) = \frac{1}{N} \left[ X_0 + X_1 e^{2\pi it} + \cdots + X_{N/2-1} e^{(N/2-1)2\pi it} + X_{N/2} \cos(N\pi t) + X_{N/2+1} e^{(-N/2+1)2\pi it} + \cdots + X_{N-1} e^{-2\pi it} \right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; for ''N'' [[Even and odd numbers|even]] ,
:&lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;p(t) = \frac{1}{N} \left[ X_0 + X_1 e^{2\pi it} + \cdots + X_{\lfloor N/2 \rfloor} e^{\lfloor N/2 \rfloor 2\pi it} + X_{\lfloor N/2 \rfloor+1} e^{-\lfloor N/2 \rfloor 2\pi it} + \cdots + X_{N-1} e^{-2\pi it} \right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;  for ''N'' odd,
where the coefficients ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are given by the DFT of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; above, satisfies the interpolation property &lt;math&gt;p(n/N) = x_n&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n=0,\ldots,N-1&lt;/math&gt;.

For even ''N'', notice that the [[Nyquist frequency|Nyquist component]] &lt;math&gt;\frac{X_{N/2}}{N} \cos(N\pi t)&lt;/math&gt; is handled specially.

This interpolation is ''not unique'': aliasing implies that one could add ''N'' to any of the complex-sinusoid frequencies (e.g. changing &lt;math&gt;e^{-it}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;e^{i(N-1)t}&lt;/math&gt; ) without changing the interpolation property, but giving ''different'' values in between the &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; points.  The choice above, however, is typical because it has two useful properties.  First, it consists of sinusoids whose frequencies have the smallest possible magnitudes: the interpolation is [[bandlimited]]. Second, if the  &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers, then &lt;math&gt;p(t)&lt;/math&gt; is real as well.

In contrast, the most obvious trigonometric interpolation polynomial is the one in which the frequencies range from 0 to &lt;math&gt;N-1&lt;/math&gt; (instead of roughly &lt;math&gt;-N/2&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;+N/2&lt;/math&gt; as above), similar to the inverse DFT formula. This interpolation does ''not'' minimize the slope, and is ''not'' generally real-valued for real &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt;; its use is a common mistake.

=== The unitary DFT ===
Another way of looking at the DFT is to note that in the above discussion, the DFT can be expressed as the [[DFT matrix]], a [[Vandermonde matrix]], 
[[Generalizations of Pauli matrices#Construction: The clock and shift matrices|introduced by Sylvester]] in 1867,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} =
\begin{bmatrix}
 \omega_N^{0 \cdot 0}     &amp; \omega_N^{0 \cdot 1}     &amp; \ldots &amp; \omega_N^{0 \cdot (N-1)}     \\
 \omega_N^{1 \cdot 0}     &amp; \omega_N^{1 \cdot 1}     &amp; \ldots &amp; \omega_N^{1 \cdot (N-1)}     \\
 \vdots                   &amp; \vdots                   &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots                       \\
 \omega_N^{(N-1) \cdot 0} &amp; \omega_N^{(N-1) \cdot 1} &amp; \ldots &amp; \omega_N^{(N-1) \cdot (N-1)} \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_N = e^{-2 \pi i/N}\,&lt;/math&gt;
is a primitive [[roots of unity|Nth root of unity]].

The inverse transform is then given by the inverse of the above matrix,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}^{-1}=\frac{1}{N}\mathbf{F}^*&lt;/math&gt;

With [[unitary operator|unitary]] normalization constants &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{N}&lt;/math&gt;, the DFT becomes a [[unitary transformation]], defined by a unitary matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}=\mathbf{F}/\sqrt{N}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}^{-1}=\mathbf{U}^*&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\det(\mathbf{U})|=1&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\det()&lt;/math&gt; is the [[determinant]] function. The determinant is the product of the eigenvalues, which are always &lt;math&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\pm i&lt;/math&gt; as described below.  In a real vector space, a unitary transformation can be thought of as simply a rigid rotation of the coordinate system, and all of the properties of a rigid rotation can be found in the unitary DFT.

The orthogonality of the DFT is now expressed as an [[orthonormal]]ity condition (which arises in many areas of mathematics as described in [[root of unity]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^{N-1}U_{km}U_{mn}^*=\delta_{kn}&lt;/math&gt;

If '''X'''  is defined as the unitary DFT of the vector '''x''', then
:&lt;math&gt;X_k=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} U_{kn}x_n&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[Plancherel theorem]] is expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x_n y_n^* = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1}X_k Y_k^*&lt;/math&gt;

If we view the DFT as just a coordinate transformation which simply specifies the components of a vector in a new coordinate system, then the above is just the statement that the dot product of two vectors is preserved under a unitary DFT transformation. For the special case &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;, this implies that the length of a vector is preserved as well—this is just [[Parseval's theorem]],
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}|x_n|^2 = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1}|X_k|^2&lt;/math&gt;

A consequence of the [[Discrete Fourier transform#Circular convolution theorem and cross-correlation theorem|circular convolution theorem]] is that the DFT matrix {{mvar|F}} diagonalizes any [[circulant matrix]].

=== Expressing the inverse DFT in terms of the DFT ===
A useful property of the DFT is that the inverse DFT can be easily expressed in terms of the (forward) DFT, via several well-known "tricks".  (For example, in computations, it is often convenient to only implement a fast Fourier transform corresponding to one transform direction and then to get the other transform direction from the first.)

First, we can compute the inverse DFT by reversing all but one of the inputs (Duhamel ''et al.'', 1988):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\{x_n\}) = \mathcal{F}(\{x_{N - n}\}) / N&lt;/math&gt;

(As usual, the subscripts are interpreted [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''N''; thus, for &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;x_{N-0}=x_0&lt;/math&gt;.)

Second, one can also conjugate the inputs and outputs:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{x}^*)^* / N&lt;/math&gt;

Third, a variant of this conjugation trick, which is sometimes preferable because it requires no modification of the data values, involves swapping real and imaginary parts (which can be done on a computer simply by modifying [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]s). Define swap(&lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt;) as &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; with its real and imaginary parts swapped—that is, if &lt;math&gt;x_n = a + b i&lt;/math&gt; then swap(&lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt;) is &lt;math&gt;b + a i&lt;/math&gt;.  Equivalently, swap(&lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt;) equals &lt;math&gt;i x_n^*&lt;/math&gt;.  Then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\mathbf{x}) = \textrm{swap}(\mathcal{F}(\textrm{swap}(\mathbf{x}))) / N&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the inverse transform is the same as the forward transform with the real and imaginary parts swapped for both input and output, up to a normalization (Duhamel ''et al.'', 1988).

The conjugation trick can also be used to define a new transform, closely related to the DFT, that is [[Involution (mathematics)|involutory]]—that is, which is its own inverse.  In particular, &lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{x}) = \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{x}^*) / \sqrt{N}&lt;/math&gt; is clearly its own inverse: &lt;math&gt;T(T(\mathbf{x})) = \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;.  A closely related involutory transformation (by a factor of (1+''i'') /{{radic|2}}) is &lt;math&gt;H(\mathbf{x}) = \mathcal{F}((1+i) \mathbf{x}^*) / \sqrt{2N}&lt;/math&gt;, since the &lt;math&gt;(1+i)&lt;/math&gt; factors in &lt;math&gt;H(H(\mathbf{x}))&lt;/math&gt; cancel the 2.  For real inputs &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;, the real part of &lt;math&gt;H(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; is none other than the [[discrete Hartley transform]], which is also involutory.

=== Eigenvalues and eigenvectors ===

The [[eigenvalue]]s of the DFT matrix are simple and well-known, whereas the [[eigenvector]]s are complicated, not unique, and are the subject of ongoing research.

Consider the unitary form &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt; defined above for the DFT of length ''N'', where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}_{m,n} = \frac1{\sqrt{N}}\omega_N^{(m-1)(n-1)} = \frac1{\sqrt{N}}e^{-\frac{2\pi i}N (m-1)(n-1)}.&lt;/math&gt;
This matrix satisfies the [[matrix polynomial]] equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}^4 = \mathbf{I}.&lt;/math&gt;
This can be seen from the inverse properties above: operating &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt; twice gives the original data in reverse order, so operating &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt; four times gives back the original data and is thus the [[identity matrix]].  This means that the eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda^4 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt; are the fourth [[roots of unity]]: &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is +1, −1, +''i'',  or −''i''.

Since there are only four distinct eigenvalues for this &lt;math&gt;N\times N&lt;/math&gt; matrix, they have some [[algebraic multiplicity|multiplicity]].  The multiplicity gives the number of [[linearly independent]] eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.  (Note that there are ''N'' independent eigenvectors; a unitary matrix is never [[defective matrix|defective]].)

The problem of their multiplicity was solved by McClellan and Parks (1972), although it was later shown to have been equivalent to a problem solved by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] (Dickinson and Steiglitz, 1982).  The multiplicity depends on the value of ''N'' [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 4, and is given by the following table:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto;"
|+ align="bottom" | Multiplicities of the eigenvalues λ of the unitary DFT matrix '''U''' as a function of the transform size ''N'' (in terms of an integer ''m'').
|-
! size ''N''
! λ = +1
! λ = −1
! λ = -''i''
! λ = +''i''
|-
|    4''m''  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m'' − 1
|-
|    4''m'' + 1  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m''
|-
|    4''m'' + 2  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m''
|-
|    4''m'' + 3  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m''
|}

Otherwise stated, the [[characteristic polynomial]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;\det (\lambda I - \mathbf{U})=
(\lambda-1)^{\left\lfloor \tfrac {N+4}{4}\right\rfloor}
(\lambda+1)^{\left\lfloor \tfrac {N+2}{4}\right\rfloor}
(\lambda+i)^{\left\lfloor \tfrac {N+1}{4}\right\rfloor}
(\lambda-i)^{\left\lfloor \tfrac {N-1}{4}\right\rfloor}.&lt;/math&gt;

No simple analytical formula for general eigenvectors is known.   Moreover, the eigenvectors are not unique because any linear combination of eigenvectors for the same eigenvalue is also an eigenvector for that eigenvalue.  Various researchers have proposed different choices of eigenvectors, selected to satisfy useful properties like [[orthogonality]] and to have "simple" forms (e.g., McClellan and Parks, 1972; Dickinson and Steiglitz, 1982; Grünbaum, 1982; Atakishiyev and Wolf, 1997; Candan ''et al.'', 2000; Hanna ''et al.'', 2004; Gurevich and Hadani, 2008).

A straightforward approach is to discretize an eigenfunction of the continuous [[Fourier transform]],
of which the most famous is the [[Gaussian function]].
Since [[periodic summation]] of the function means discretizing its frequency spectrum
and discretization means periodic summation of the spectrum,
the discretized and periodically summed Gaussian function yields an eigenvector of the discrete transform:
*&lt;math&gt;F(m) = \sum_{k\in\mathbb{Z}} \exp\left(-\frac{\pi\cdot(m+N\cdot k)^2}{N}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The closed form expression for the series can be expressed by
[[Jacobi theta functions]] as

*&lt;math&gt;F(m) = \frac1{\sqrt{N}}\vartheta_3\left(\frac{\pi m}N, \exp\left(-\frac{\pi}N \right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Two other simple closed-form analytical eigenvectors for special DFT period ''N'' were found (Kong, 2008):

For DFT period ''N'' = 2''L'' + 1 = 4''K'' +1, where ''K'' is an integer, the following is an eigenvector of DFT:
*&lt;math&gt;F(m)=\prod_{s=K+1}^L\left[\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{N}m\right)- \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{N}s\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

For DFT period ''N'' = 2''L'' = 4''K'', where ''K'' is an integer, the following is an eigenvector of DFT:
*&lt;math&gt;F(m)=\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{N}m\right)\prod_{s=K+1}^{L-1}\left[\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{N}m\right)- \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{N}s\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

The choice of eigenvectors of the DFT matrix has become important in recent years in order to define a discrete analogue of the [[fractional Fourier transform]]—the DFT matrix can be taken to fractional powers by exponentiating the eigenvalues (e.g., Rubio and Santhanam, 2005).  For the [[continuous Fourier transform]], the natural orthogonal eigenfunctions are the [[Hermite function]]s, so various discrete analogues of these have been employed as the eigenvectors of the DFT, such as the [[Kravchuk polynomials]] (Atakishiyev and Wolf, 1997).  The "best" choice of eigenvectors to define a fractional discrete Fourier transform remains an open question, however.

=== Uncertainty principles ===
==== Probabilistic uncertainty principle ====
If the random variable {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is constrained by
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}|X_n|^2=1  ~,&lt;/math&gt;
then 
:&lt;math&gt;P_n=|X_n|^2&lt;/math&gt; 
may be considered to represent a discrete [[probability mass function]] of {{mvar|n}}, with an associated probability mass function constructed from the transformed variable,
:&lt;math&gt;Q_m=N|x_m|^2 ~.&lt;/math&gt;

For the case of continuous functions &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q(k)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] states that
:&lt;math&gt;D_0(X)D_0(x)\ge\frac{1}{16\pi^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt;D_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_0(x)&lt;/math&gt; are the variances of &lt;math&gt;|X|^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|x|^2&lt;/math&gt; respectively, with the equality attained in the case of a suitably normalized [[Gaussian distribution]]. Although the variances may be analogously defined for the DFT, an analogous uncertainty principle is not useful, because the uncertainty will not be shift-invariant. Still, a meaningful uncertainty principle has been introduced by Massar and Spindel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Massar | first1 = S. | last2 = Spindel | first2 = P. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.190401 | title = Uncertainty Relation for the Discrete Fourier Transform | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 100 | issue = 19 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18518426| pmc = |arxiv = 0710.0723 |bibcode = 2008PhRvL.100s0401M | page=190401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Hirschman [[entropic uncertainty]] will have a useful analog for the case of the DFT.&lt;ref name="DeBrunner"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeBrunner |first1=Victor |last2=Havlicek |first2=Joseph P. |last3=Przebinda |first3=Tomasz|last4=Özaydin |first4=Murad|year=2005 |title=Entropy-Based Uncertainty Measures for &lt;math&gt;L^2(\mathbb{R}^n),\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt; With a Hirschman Optimal Transform for &lt;math&gt;\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt; |journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing |volume=53 |issue=8 |page=2690 |doi=  10.1109/TSP.2005.850329|url=http://redwood.berkeley.edu/w/images/9/95/2002-26.pdf |accessdate=2011-06-23 |bibcode = 2005ITSP...53.2690D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hirschman uncertainty principle is expressed in terms of the [[Entropy (information theory)|Shannon entropy]] of the two probability functions.

In the discrete case, the Shannon entropies are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;H(X)=-\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} P_n\ln P_n&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;H(x)=-\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} Q_m\ln Q_m ~,&lt;/math&gt;
and the [[entropic uncertainty]] principle becomes&lt;ref name="DeBrunner"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H(X)+H(x) \ge \ln(N) ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The equality is obtained for &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt; equal to translations and modulations of a suitably normalized [[Kronecker comb]] of period &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is any exact integer divisor of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. The probability mass function &lt;math&gt;Q_m&lt;/math&gt; will then be proportional to a suitably translated [[Kronecker comb]] of period &lt;math&gt;B=N/A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="DeBrunner"/&gt;

==== Deterministic uncertainty principle ====
There is also a well-known deterministic uncertainty principle that uses signal sparsity (or the number of non-zero coefficients).&lt;ref name="Donoho"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Donoho |first1=D.L. |last2=Stark |first2=P.B |year=1989 |title=Uncertainty principles and signal recovery |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=906–931 |doi=10.1137/0149053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;\|x\|_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|X\|_0&lt;/math&gt; be the number of non-zero elements of the time and frequency sequences &lt;math&gt;x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_0,X_1,\ldots,X_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Then, 
:&lt;math&gt;N\leq \|x\|_0 \cdot \|X\|_0.&lt;/math&gt;
As an immediate consequence of the [[Arithmetic–geometric mean|inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]], one also has &lt;math&gt;2\sqrt{N}\leq\|x\|_0+\|X\|_0&lt;/math&gt;. Both uncertainty principles were shown to be tight for specifically-chosen "picket-fence" sequences (discrete impulse trains), and find practical use for signal recovery applications.&lt;ref name="Donoho"/&gt;

=== DFT of real and purely imaginary signals ===
*If &lt;math&gt;x_0, \ldots, x_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; are [[real number]]s, as they often are in practical applications, then the DFT &lt;math&gt;X_0, \ldots, X_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Even and odd functions|even symmetric]]:
:&lt;math&gt;x_n \in \mathbb{R} \quad \forall n \in \{0,\ldots,N-1 \} \implies X_k = X_{-k \mod N}^* \quad \forall k \in \{0,\ldots,N-1 \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;X^*\,&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[Complex conjugate|complex conjugation]].

It follows that for even &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_{N/2}&lt;/math&gt; are real-valued, and the remainder of the DFT is completely specified by just &lt;math&gt;X/2-1&lt;/math&gt; complex numbers.

*If &lt;math&gt;x_0, \ldots, x_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; are purely imaginary numbers, then the DFT &lt;math&gt;X_0, \ldots, X_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Even and odd functions|odd symmetric]]:
:&lt;math&gt;x_n \in i \mathbb{R} \quad \forall n \in \{0,\ldots,N-1 \} \implies X_k = -X_{-k \mod N}^* \quad \forall k \in \{0,\ldots,N-1 \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;X^*\,&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[Complex conjugate|complex conjugation]].

==Generalized DFT (shifted and non-linear phase)==
It is possible to shift the transform sampling in time and/or frequency domain by some real shifts ''a'' and ''b'', respectively. This is sometimes known as a '''generalized DFT''' (or '''GDFT'''), also called the '''shifted DFT''' or '''offset DFT''', and has analogous properties to the ordinary DFT:

:&lt;math&gt;X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-\frac{2 \pi i}{N} (k+b) (n+a)} \quad \quad k = 0, \dots, N-1.&lt;/math&gt;

Most often, shifts of &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; (half a sample) are used.
While the ordinary DFT corresponds to a periodic signal in both time and frequency domains, &lt;math&gt;a=1/2&lt;/math&gt; produces a signal that is anti-periodic in frequency domain (&lt;math&gt;X_{k+N} = - X_k&lt;/math&gt;) and vice versa for &lt;math&gt;b=1/2&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, the specific case of &lt;math&gt;a = b = 1/2&lt;/math&gt; is known as an ''odd-time odd-frequency'' discrete Fourier transform (or O&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; DFT).
Such shifted transforms are most often used for symmetric data, to represent different boundary symmetries, and for real-symmetric data they correspond to different forms of the discrete [[discrete cosine transform|cosine]] and [[discrete sine transform|sine]] transforms.

Another interesting choice is &lt;math&gt;a=b=-(N-1)/2&lt;/math&gt;, which is called the '''centered DFT''' (or '''CDFT''').  The centered DFT has the useful property that, when ''N'' is a multiple of four, all four of its eigenvalues (see above) have equal multiplicities (Rubio and Santhanam, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Santhanam, Balu; Santhanam, Thalanayar S. [http://thamakau.usc.edu/Proceedings/ICASSP%202007/pdfs/0301385.pdf "''Discrete Gauss-Hermite functions and eigenvectors of the centered discrete Fourier transform''"]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Proceedings of the 32nd IEEE ''International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing'' (ICASSP 2007, SPTM-P12.4), vol. III, pp. 1385-1388.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term GDFT is also used for the non-linear phase extensions of DFT. Hence, GDFT method provides a generalization for constant amplitude orthogonal block transforms including linear and non-linear phase types. GDFT is a framework 
to improve time and frequency domain properties of the traditional DFT, e.g. auto/cross-correlations, by the addition of the properly designed phase shaping function (non-linear, in general) to the original linear phase functions (Akansu and Agirman-Tosun, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Akansu, Ali N.; Agirman-Tosun, Handan 
[http://web.njit.edu/~akansu/PAPERS/AkansuIEEE-TSP2010.pdf "''Generalized Discrete Fourier Transform With Nonlinear Phase''"], IEEE ''Transactions on Signal Processing'', vol. 58, no. 9, pp. 4547-4556, Sept. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discrete Fourier transform can be viewed as a special case of the [[z-transform]], evaluated on the unit circle in the complex plane; more general z-transforms correspond to ''complex'' shifts ''a'' and ''b'' above.

==Multidimensional DFT==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fast Fourier transform]] --&gt;
The ordinary DFT transforms a one-dimensional sequence or [[matrix (mathematics)|array]] &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; that is a function of exactly one discrete variable ''n''.  The multidimensional DFT of a multidimensional array &lt;math&gt;x_{n_1, n_2, \dots, n_d}&lt;/math&gt; that is a function of ''d'' discrete variables &lt;math&gt;n_\ell = 0, 1, \dots, N_\ell-1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;1, 2, \dots, d&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;X_{k_1, k_2, \dots, k_d} = \sum_{n_1=0}^{N_1-1} \left(\omega_{N_1}^{~k_1 n_1} \sum_{n_2=0}^{N_2-1} \left( \omega_{N_2}^{~k_2 n_2} \cdots \sum_{n_d=0}^{N_d-1} \omega_{N_d}^{~k_d n_d}\cdot x_{n_1, n_2, \dots, n_d} \right) \right) \, , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega_{N_\ell} = \exp(-2\pi i/N_\ell)&lt;/math&gt; as above and the ''d'' output indices run from &lt;math&gt;k_\ell = 0, 1, \dots, N_\ell-1&lt;/math&gt;.  This is more compactly expressed in [[coordinate vector|vector]] notation, where we define &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} = (n_1, n_2, \dots, n_d)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k} = (k_1, k_2, \dots, k_d)&lt;/math&gt; as ''d''-dimensional vectors of indices from 0 to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N} - 1&lt;/math&gt;, which we define as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N} - 1 = (N_1 - 1, N_2 - 1, \dots, N_d - 1)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;X_\mathbf{k} = \sum_{\mathbf{n}=\mathbf{0}}^{\mathbf{N}-1} e^{-2\pi i \mathbf{k} \cdot (\mathbf{n} / \mathbf{N})} x_\mathbf{n} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the division &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} / \mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} / \mathbf{N} = (n_1/N_1, \dots, n_d/N_d)&lt;/math&gt; to be performed element-wise, and the sum denotes the set of nested summations above.

The inverse of the multi-dimensional DFT is, analogous to the one-dimensional case, given by:

:&lt;math&gt;x_\mathbf{n} = \frac{1}{\prod_{\ell=1}^d N_\ell} \sum_{\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{0}}^{\mathbf{N}-1} e^{2\pi i \mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{k} / \mathbf{N})} X_\mathbf{k} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

As the one-dimensional DFT expresses the input &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; as a superposition of sinusoids, the multidimensional DFT expresses the input as a superposition of [[plane wave]]s, or multidimensional sinusoids. The direction of oscillation in space is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k} / \mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt;. The amplitudes  are &lt;math&gt;X_\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;.  This decomposition is of great importance for everything from [[digital image processing]] (two-dimensional) to solving [[partial differential equations]]. The solution is broken up into plane waves.

The multidimensional DFT can be computed by the [[function composition|composition]] of a sequence of one-dimensional DFTs along each dimension.  In the two-dimensional case &lt;math&gt;x_{n_1,n_2}&lt;/math&gt; the &lt;math&gt;N_1&lt;/math&gt; independent DFTs of the rows (i.e., along &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt;) are computed first to form a new array &lt;math&gt;y_{n_1,k_2}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the &lt;math&gt;N_2&lt;/math&gt; independent DFTs of ''y'' along the columns (along &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt;) are computed to form the final result &lt;math&gt;X_{k_1,k_2}&lt;/math&gt;.  Alternatively the columns can be computed first and then the rows. The order is immaterial because the nested summations above [[commutative operation|commute]].

An algorithm to compute a one-dimensional DFT is thus sufficient to efficiently compute a multidimensional DFT.  This approach is known as the ''row-column'' algorithm. There are also intrinsically [[Fast Fourier transform#Multidimensional FFTs|multidimensional FFT algorithms]].

=== The real-input multidimensional DFT ===
For input data &lt;math&gt;x_{n_1, n_2, \dots, n_d}&lt;/math&gt; consisting of [[real numbers]], the DFT outputs have a conjugate symmetry similar to the one-dimensional case above:

:&lt;math&gt;X_{k_1, k_2, \dots, k_d} = X_{N_1 - k_1, N_2 - k_2, \dots, N_d - k_d}^* ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the star again denotes complex conjugation and the &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;-th subscript is again interpreted modulo &lt;math&gt;N_\ell&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;\ell = 1,2,\ldots,d&lt;/math&gt;).

== Applications ==
The DFT has seen wide usage across a large number of fields; we only sketch a few examples below (see also the references at the end). All applications of the DFT depend crucially on the availability of a fast algorithm to compute discrete Fourier transforms and their inverses, a [[fast Fourier transform]].

=== Spectral analysis ===
When the DFT is used for [[signal spectral analysis]], the &lt;math&gt;\{x_n\}\,&lt;/math&gt; sequence usually represents a finite set of uniformly spaced time-samples of some signal &lt;math&gt;x(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; represents time.  The conversion from continuous time to samples (discrete-time) changes the underlying [[continuous Fourier transform|Fourier transform]] of &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; into a [[discrete-time Fourier transform]] (DTFT), which generally entails a type of distortion called [[aliasing]].  Choice of an appropriate sample-rate (see ''[[Nyquist rate]]'') is the key to minimizing that distortion.  Similarly, the conversion from a very long (or infinite) sequence to a manageable size entails a type of distortion called ''[[Spectral leakage|leakage]]'', which is manifested as a loss of detail (a.k.a. resolution) in the DTFT.  Choice of an appropriate sub-sequence length is the primary key to minimizing that effect.  When the available data (and time to process it) is more than the amount needed to attain the desired frequency resolution, a standard technique is to perform multiple DFTs, for example to create a [[spectrogram]].  If the desired result is a power spectrum and noise or randomness is present in the data, averaging the magnitude components of the multiple DFTs is a useful procedure to reduce the [[variance]] of the spectrum (also called a [[periodogram]] in this context); two examples of such techniques are the [[Welch method]] and the [[Bartlett method]]; the general subject of estimating the power spectrum of a noisy signal is called [[spectral estimation]].

A final source of distortion (or perhaps ''illusion'') is the DFT itself, because it is just a discrete sampling of the DTFT, which is a function of a continuous frequency domain.  That can be mitigated by increasing the resolution of the DFT.  That procedure is illustrated at [[Discrete-time Fourier transform#Sampling the DTFT|Sampling the DTFT]].
*The procedure is sometimes referred to as ''zero-padding'', which is a particular implementation used in conjunction with the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) algorithm.  The inefficiency of performing multiplications and additions with zero-valued "samples" is more than offset by the inherent efficiency of the FFT.
*As already noted, leakage imposes a limit on the inherent resolution of the DTFT.  So there is a practical limit to the benefit that can be obtained from a fine-grained DFT.

===Data compression===
The field of digital signal processing relies heavily on operations in the frequency domain (i.e. on the Fourier transform). For example, several [[lossy]] image and sound compression methods employ the discrete Fourier transform: the signal is cut into short segments, each is transformed, and then the Fourier coefficients of high frequencies, which are assumed to be unnoticeable, are discarded. The decompressor computes the inverse transform based on this reduced number of Fourier coefficients. (Compression applications often use a specialized form of the DFT, the [[discrete cosine transform]] or sometimes the [[modified discrete cosine transform]].)
Some relatively recent compression algorithms, however, use [[wavelet transform]]s, which give a more uniform compromise between time and frequency domain than obtained by chopping data into segments and transforming each segment.  In the case of [[JPEG2000]], this avoids the spurious image features that appear when images are highly compressed with the original [[JPEG]].

===Partial differential equations===
Discrete Fourier transforms are often used to solve [[partial differential equations]], where again the DFT is used as an approximation for the [[Fourier series]] (which is recovered in the limit of infinite ''N''). The advantage of this approach is that it expands the signal in complex exponentials &lt;math&gt;e^{inx}&lt;/math&gt;, which are eigenfunctions of differentiation: &lt;math&gt;{\text{d} \big( e^{inx} \big) }/\text{d}x = in e^{inx}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, in the Fourier representation, differentiation is simple—we just multiply by &lt;math&gt;in&lt;/math&gt;.  (Note, however, that the choice of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is not unique due to aliasing; for the method to be convergent, a choice similar to that in the [[Discrete Fourier transform#Trigonometric interpolation polynomial|trigonometric interpolation]] section above should be used.) A [[linear differential equation]] with constant coefficients is transformed into an easily solvable algebraic equation. One then uses the inverse DFT to transform the result back into the ordinary spatial representation. Such an approach is called a [[spectral method]].

===Polynomial multiplication===

Suppose we wish to compute the polynomial product ''c''(''x'') = ''a''(''x'') · ''b''(''x'').  The ordinary product expression for the coefficients of ''c'' involves a linear (acyclic) convolution, where indices do not "wrap around."  This can be rewritten as a cyclic convolution by taking the coefficient vectors for ''a''(''x'') and ''b''(''x'') with constant term first, then appending zeros so that the resultant coefficient vectors '''a''' and '''b''' have dimension ''d''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;deg(''a''(''x''))&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;deg(''b''(''x'')).  Then,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{a} * \mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;

Where '''c''' is the vector of coefficients for ''c''(''x''), and the convolution operator &lt;math&gt;*\,&lt;/math&gt; is defined so

:&lt;math&gt;c_n = \sum_{m=0}^{d-1}a_m b_{n-m\ \mathrm{mod}\ d} \qquad\qquad\qquad n=0,1\dots,d-1&lt;/math&gt;

But convolution becomes multiplication under the DFT:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{c}) = \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{a})\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{b})&lt;/math&gt;

Here the vector product is taken elementwise.  Thus the coefficients of the product polynomial ''c''(''x'') are just the terms 0, ..., deg(''a''(''x'')) + deg(''b''(''x'')) of the coefficient vector

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} = \mathcal{F}^{-1}(\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{a})\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{b})).&lt;/math&gt;

With a [[fast Fourier transform]], the resulting algorithm takes O (''N''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''N'') arithmetic operations.  Due to its simplicity and speed, the [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm]], which is limited to [[composite number|composite]] sizes, is often chosen for the transform operation.  In this case, ''d'' should be chosen as the smallest integer greater than the sum of the input polynomial degrees that is factorizable into small prime factors (e.g. 2, 3, and 5, depending upon the FFT implementation).

====Multiplication of large integers====

The fastest known [[multiplication algorithms|algorithms]] for the multiplication of very large [[integer]]s use the polynomial multiplication method outlined above.  Integers can be treated as the value of a polynomial evaluated specifically at the number base, with the coefficients of the polynomial corresponding to the digits in that base.  After polynomial multiplication, a relatively low-complexity carry-propagation step completes the multiplication.

==== Convolution  ====
When data is [[Convolution|convolved]] with a function with wide support, such as for downsampling by a large sampling ratio, because of the [[Convolution theorem]] and the FFT algorithm, it may be faster to transform it, multiply pointwise by the transform of the filter and then reverse transform it.  Alternatively, a good filter is obtained by simply truncating the transformed data and re-transforming the shortened data set.

==Generalizations==

=== Representation theory ===
{{details|Representation theory of finite groups#Discrete Fourier transform}}

The DFT can be interpreted as the complex-valued [[representation theory]] of the finite [[cyclic group]]. In other words, a sequence of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; complex numbers can be thought of as an element of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional complex space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt; or equivalently a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; from the finite cyclic group of order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; to the complex numbers, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n \mapsto \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;. So  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a [[class function]] on the finite cyclic group, and thus can be expressed as a linear combination of the irreducible characters of this group, which are the roots of unity.

From this point of view, one may generalize the DFT to representation theory generally, or more narrowly to the [[representation theory of finite groups]].

More narrowly still, one may generalize the DFT by either changing the target (taking values in a field other than the complex numbers), or the domain (a group other than a finite cyclic group), as detailed in the sequel.

=== Other fields ===
{{Main|Discrete Fourier transform (general)|Number-theoretic transform}}
Many of the properties of the DFT only depend on the fact that &lt;math&gt;e^{-\frac{2 \pi i}{N}}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[primitive root of unity]], sometimes denoted &lt;math&gt;\omega_N&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;W_N&lt;/math&gt; (so that &lt;math&gt;\omega_N^N = 1&lt;/math&gt;).  Such properties include the completeness, orthogonality, Plancherel/Parseval, periodicity, shift, convolution, and unitarity properties above, as well as many FFT algorithms. For this reason, the discrete Fourier transform can be defined by using roots of unity in [[field (mathematics)|fields]] other than the complex numbers, and such generalizations are commonly called ''number-theoretic transforms'' (NTTs) in the case of [[finite field]]s. For more information, see [[number-theoretic transform]] and [[discrete Fourier transform (general)]].

=== Other finite groups ===
{{Main|Fourier transform on finite groups}}
The standard DFT acts on a sequence ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; of complex numbers, which can be viewed as a function {0, 1, …, ''N'' &amp;minus; 1} → '''C'''. The multidimensional DFT acts on multidimensional sequences, which can be viewed as functions
:&lt;math&gt; \{0, 1, \ldots, N_1-1\} \times \cdots \times \{0, 1, \ldots, N_d-1\} \to \mathbb{C}. &lt;/math&gt;
This suggests the generalization to [[Fourier transform on finite groups|Fourier transforms on arbitrary finite groups]], which act on functions ''G'' → '''C''' where ''G'' is a [[finite group]]. In this framework, the standard DFT is seen as the Fourier transform on a [[cyclic group]], while the multidimensional DFT is a Fourier transform on a direct sum of cyclic groups.

Further, Fourier transform can be on cosets of a group.

==Alternatives==
{{Main|Discrete wavelet transform}}
{{details|Discrete wavelet transform#Comparison with Fourier transform}} There are various alternatives to the DFT for various applications, prominent among which are [[wavelets]]. The analog of the DFT is the [[discrete wavelet transform]] (DWT). From the point of view of [[time–frequency analysis]], a key limitation of the Fourier transform is that it does not include ''location'' information, only ''frequency'' information, and thus has difficulty in representing transients. As wavelets have location as well as frequency, they are better able to represent location, at the expense of greater difficulty representing frequency. For details, see [[Discrete wavelet transform#Comparison with Fourier transform|comparison of the discrete wavelet transform with the discrete Fourier transform]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5322">In [[mathematics]], '''duality theory for distributive lattices'''  provides three different (but closely related) representations of [[distributive lattice|bounded distributive lattices]] via [[Priestley space]]s, [[spectral space]]s, and [[pairwise Stone space]]s. This generalizes the well-known [[Stone duality]] between [[Stone space]]s and [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s.

Let {{math|''L''}} be a bounded distributive lattice, and let {{math|''X''}} denote the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[Ideal (order theory)|prime filters]] of {{math|''L''}}. For each {{math|''a'' &lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; L}}, let {{math|''&amp;phi;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'') {{=}} {''x''&lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''X'' : ''a'' &amp;isin; ''x''} }}. Then {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a spectral space,&lt;ref&gt;Stone (1937), Johnstone (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[topological space#Definition|topology]] {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}} on {{math|''X''}} is generated by {{math| {''&amp;phi;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'') : ''a''&lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''L''}}}. The spectral space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is called the ''prime spectrum'' of {{math|''L''}}.

The [[map (mathematics)|map]] {{math|''&amp;phi;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a lattice [[isomorphism]] from {{math|''L''}} onto the lattice of all [[compact set|compact]] [[open set|open]] subsets of {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. In fact, each spectral space is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the prime spectrum of some bounded distributive lattice.&lt;ref&gt;Stone (1937), Johnstone (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, if {{math|''&amp;phi;''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;(a) {{=}} {''x''&lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''X'' : ''a'' &amp;notin; ''x''} }} and {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;}} denotes the topology generated by {{math|{''&amp;phi;''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'') : ''a''&lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''L''}}}, then {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is also a spectral space. Moreover, {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;,''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a [[pairwise Stone space]]. The pairwise Stone space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;,''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is called the ''bitopological dual'' of {{math|''L''}}. Each pairwise Stone space is [[bi-homeomorphic]] to the bitopological dual of some bounded distributive lattice.&lt;ref&gt;Bezhanishvili et al. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, let {{math|&amp;le;}} be set-theoretic inclusion on the set of prime filters of {{math|''L''}} and let {{math|''&amp;tau;'' {{=}} ''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;or;&lt;/small&gt; ''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Then {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} is a [[Priestley space]]. Moreover, {{math|''&amp;phi;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a lattice isomorphism from {{math|''L''}} onto the lattice of all [[clopen set|clopen]] [[up-set]]s of {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}}. The Priestley space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} is called the ''Priestley dual'' of {{math|''L''}}. Each Priestley space is isomorphic to the Priestley dual of some bounded distributive lattice.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

Let '''Dist''' denote the category of bounded distributive lattices and bounded lattice [[homomorphisms]]. Then the above three representations of bounded distributive lattices can be extended to [[Equivalence of categories|dual equivalence]]&lt;ref&gt;Bezhanishvili et al. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; between '''Dist''' and the categories '''Spec''', '''PStone''', and  '''Pries''' of spectral spaces with spectral maps, of pairwise Stone spaces with bi-continuous maps, and of Priestley spaces with Priestley morphisms, respectively:

[[Image:DL Duality.png|thumb|center|alt=Spec, Pries and Pstone are isomorphic, all three are dually equivalent to Dist|Duality for bounded distributive lattices]]

Thus, there are three equivalent ways of representing bounded distributive lattices. Each one has its own motivation and advantages, but ultimately they all serve the same purpose of providing better understanding of bounded distributive lattices.

He had a particular interest in [[numerical analysis]], but also worked on [[celestial mechanics]] and the [[history of physics]]. Near the end of his career he received the [[Copley Medal]], the most prestigious honorary award in British science. The School of Mathematics of the University of Edinburgh holds The Whittaker Colloquium, a yearly lecture in his honour.&lt;ref name="mathgene"&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=18571}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mactutor"&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Whittaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Whittaker was born in [[Southport]], in [[Lancashire]]. He was educated at [[Manchester Grammar School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] from 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=WHTR892ET|name=Whittaker, Edmund Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated as [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Second Wrangler]] in the examination in 1895 and also received the Tyson Medal for Mathematics and Astronomy. In 1896, Whittaker was elected as a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and remained at Cambridge as a teacher until 1906. Between 1906 and 1911, he was the [[Royal Astronomer of Ireland]] and professor of astronomy at [[Trinity College Dublin]] where he taught mathematical physics. In 1911, Whittaker became professor at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and remained there for the rest of his career.

Shortly after coming to [[Edinburgh]], Whittaker established a Mathematical Laboratory, the first enterprise of this kind in Great Britain, and probably one of the first attempts to make [[numerical analysis]] an integral part of the university curriculum. It is probable that in starting this new venture, Whittaker was influenced by his work in astronomy, and by his friendship with the great actuaries of the period. To the knowledge of the present writer, he regarded the introduction of the Mathematical Laboratory course as his most notable contribution to mathematical education. He and his associates, among whom the most outstanding was [[Alexander Aitken|A. C. Aitken]], researched on curve fitting, numerical solution of integral equations, and similar topics. His thorough knowledge of the history and practice of numerical analysis found expression in his ''Calculus of Observations'' (written in collaboration with G. Robinson) which today, more than thirty years after its appearance, and after two revolutions in numerical computing, is still one of the most important works on the subject.

A classmate at Manchester Grammar School, [[Ernest Barker]], with whom Edmund shared the office of [[prefect#Academic|prefect]], later recalled his personality:
:He had a gay, lively, bubbling spirit: he was ready for every prank: he survives in my memory as a natural actor; and I think he could also, on occasion, produce a merry poem.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Barker]] (1953) ''Age and Youth'', p 280, [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whittaker was a [[Christian]] and became a convert to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (1930). In relation to that he was a member of the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]] from 1936 onward and was president of a [[John Henry Newman|Newman Society]]. Earlier at Cambridge in 1901 he married the daughter of a [[Presbyterian]] minister. They had five children, including the mathematician [[John Macnaghten Whittaker]] (1905-1984). His elder daughter, Beatrice, married E.T. Copson, who would later become Professor of Mathematics at St. Andrews University.&lt;ref name="Httpwwwlmsacuknewsletter_html"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lms.ac.uk/newsletter/322/322_03.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050215045321/http://www.lms.ac.uk/newsletter/322/322_03.html |archivedate=15 February 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whittaker wrote the biography of a famous Italian mathematician, [[Vito Volterra]] for the Royal Society in 1941. In 1954, he was awarded the [[Copley Medal]] by the [[Royal Society]], their highest award, "for his distinguished contributions to both pure and applied mathematics and to theoretical physics". Back in 1931 Whittaker had received the Royal Society's [[Sylvester Medal]] ''"for his original contributions to both pure and applied mathematics"''. Whittaker died in Edinburgh, Scotland.

==''Whittaker &amp; Watson''==
Whittaker is remembered as the author of the book ''[[A Course of Modern Analysis]]'', first published in 1902. The book's later editions were in collaboration with [[George Neville Watson]], and so the book became known as "Whittaker &amp; Watson". The book is one of the handful of mathematics texts of its era that was considered indispensable. It has remained in print continuously for over a century.&lt;ref name="Httpwwwlmsacuknewsletter_html" /&gt;

==Special functions==
Whittaker is the [[eponym]] of the [[Whittaker function]] or Whittaker integral, in the theory of [[confluent hypergeometric function]]s. This makes him also the eponym of the [[Whittaker model]] in the local theory of [[automorphic representation]]s. He published also on [[algebraic function]]s and [[automorphic function]]s. He gave [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]]s for the [[Bessel function]]s as [[integral]]s involving [[Legendre function]]s.

==Partial differential equations==
In the theory of [[partial differential equation]]s, Whittaker developed a general solution of the [[Laplace equation]] in [[dimension|three dimension]]s and the solution of the [[wave equation]]. He developed the [[electrical]] [[potential|potential field]] as a [[Wiktionary:bi-|bi-]][[direction (geometry)|direction]]al flow of [[energy]] (sometimes referred to as [[alternating current]]s). Whittaker's pair of papers in 1903 and 1904 indicated that any [[potential]] can be analysed by a [[Fourier series|Fourier-like series]] of waves, such as a [[planet]]'s [[gravitational field]] [[telluric current|point-charge]]. The superpositions of inward and outward wave pairs produce the "static" fields (or [[scalar potential]]). These were [[harmonic]]ally-related. By this conception, the structure of [[electric potential]] is created from two opposite, though balanced, parts. Whittaker suggested that [[gravity]] possessed a wavelike "[[oscillation|undulatory]]" character.

==Special relativity==
In 1910, Whittaker wrote ''A History of the Theories of [[Luminiferous aether|Aether]] and [[Electricity]]'', which gave a very detailed account of the [[aether theories]] from [[René Descartes]] to [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Albert Einstein]], including the contributions of [[Hermann Minkowski]], and which made Whittaker a respected historian of science.

In 1951 (Vol. 1) and 1953 (Vol. 2), he published an extended and revised edition of his book in two volumes. The second volume contains some interesting historical remarks. For example, it contains a chapter named "The Relativity Theory of Poincaré and Lorentz", where Whittaker credited [[Henri Poincaré]] and Lorentz for developing [[special relativity]], and especially alluded to Lorentz's 1904 paper (dated by Whittaker as 1903), Poincaré's St. Louis speech ([[s:The Principles of Mathematical Physics|The Principles of Mathematical Physics]]) of September 1904, and Poincaré's June 1905 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brera.unimi.it/sisfa/atti/1998/Giannetto.pdf|title=The Rise of Special Relativity Henri poincare works|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attributed to Einstein's [[Annus Mirabilis papers#Special relativity|special relativity paper]] only little importance, which he said "set forth the relativity theory of Poincaré and Lorentz with some amplifications, and which attracted much attention”, and he credited Einstein only with being the first to publish the correct relativistic formulas for [[relativistic aberration]] and the [[Doppler effect]]. He also attributed the formula &lt;math&gt;E=mc^2&lt;/math&gt; to Poincaré. In 1984 [[Clifford Truesdell]] wrote that Whittaker "aroused colossal antagonism by trying to set the record straight on the basis of print and record rather than recollection and folklore and professional propaganda,..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Truesdell]], ''An Idiot's Fugitive Essays on Science'', page 432, Springer {{ISBN|0-387-90703-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, [[Abraham Pais]] wrote that "Whittaker's treatment of special relativity shows how well the author's lack of physical insight matches his ignorance of the literature".&lt;ref&gt;Pais, Abraham, "Subtle is the Lord", 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Roberto Torretti]],&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Torretti, "Relativity and Geometry", 1983&lt;/ref&gt; "Whittaker's views on the origin of special relativity have been rejected by the great majority of scholars", and he cites [[Max Born]] (1956), [[Gerald Holton]] (1960,1964), Schribner (1964), Goldberg (1967), Zahar (1973), Hirosige (1976), Schaffner (1976), and [[Arthur I. Miller]] (1981).

Nevertheless, Whittaker gave a concise statement of [[relativity of simultaneity]] by referring to [[conjugate diameters]] of hyperbolas. He wrote, "[the] hyperbola is unaltered when any pair of conjugate diameters are taken as new axes, and a new unit of length is taken proportional to the length of either of these diameters."&lt;ref&gt;E. T. Whittaker (1910) [https://archive.org/details/historyoftheorie00whitrich A History of the theories of aether and electricity] Dublin: [[Longmans, Green and Co.]] (see page 441)&lt;/ref&gt; His observation means that the simultaneous events for a [[worldline]] are [[hyperbolic-orthogonal]] to the worldline.

Such spaces are studied in [[effective descriptive set theory]] and in [[constructive analysis]].  In particular, standard examples of Polish spaces such as the  [[real line]], the [[Cantor set]] and the [[Baire space (set theory)|Baire space]] are all effective Polish spaces.

== Definition ==

An effective Polish space is a complete separable metric space ''X'' with metric ''d'' such that there is a countable dense set ''C'' = (''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...) that makes the following two [[relation (logic)|relations]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^4&lt;/math&gt; computable (Moschovakis 2009:96-7):
:&lt;math&gt;P(i,j,k,m) \equiv \left\{ d(c_i,c_j) \leq \frac{m}{k+1} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Q(i,j,k,m) \equiv \left\{ d(c_i,c_j) &lt; \frac{m}{k+1} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

A complete set of working drawings for the average electrical system in large [[project]]s usually consists of:&lt;ref name="TB04"/&gt;
* A [[plot plan]] showing the building's location and outside electrical wiring
* [[Floor plan]]s showing the location of electrical systems on every floor
* Power-riser diagrams showing panel boards
* Control [[wiring diagram]]s
* Schedules and other information in combination with [[construction drawing]]s.

Electrical [[drafter]]s prepare wiring and layout diagrams used by workers who erect, install, and repair electrical equipment and wiring in communication centers, power plants, electrical distribution systems, and buildings.&lt;ref name="BLC07"&gt; [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], U.S. Department of Labor, [http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/drafters.htm ''Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2014-15 Edition, Drafters''].  accessed: 2 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emanuel Sperner''' (9 December 1905 – 31 January 1980) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]], best known for two [[theorem]]s. He was born in [[Prusinowice, Opole Voivodeship|Waltdorf]] (near Neiße, [[Upper Silesia]], now [[Nysa, Poland]]), and died in [[Sulzburg|Sulzburg-Laufen]], [[West Germany]]. He was a student at Carolinum in Nysa and then [[Hamburg University]] where his advisor was [[Wilhelm Blaschke]]. He was appointed Professor in [[Königsberg]] in 1934, and subsequently held posts in a number of universities until 1974. 

[[Sperner's theorem]], from 1928, says that the size of an [[antichain]] in the [[power set]] of an ''n''-set (a [[Sperner family]]) is at most the middle [[binomial coefficient]](s).&lt;ref&gt;Ein Satz über Untermengen einer endlichen Menge. Math. Z. 27 (1928) 544–548.&lt;/ref&gt; It has several proofs and numerous generalizations, including the [[Sperner property of a partially ordered set]].

[[Sperner's lemma]], from 1928, states that every [[Sperner coloring]] of a [[Triangulation (geometry)|triangulation]] of an ''n''-dimensional [[simplex]] contains a cell colored with a complete set of colors.&lt;ref&gt;Neuer Beweis für die Invarianz der Dimensionszahl und des Gebietes. Abh. Math. Sem. Hamburg VI (1928) 265–272.&lt;/ref&gt; It was proven by Sperner to provide an alternate proof of a theorem of [[Lebesgue]] characterizing [[dimensionality]] of [[Euclidean space]]s.  It was later noticed that this lemma provides a direct proof of the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] without explicit use of [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sehie |last=Park |title=Ninety Years of the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem |journal=Vietnam Journal of Mathematics |volume=27 |issue=3 |year=1999 |pages=187–222|url=http://www.math.ac.vn/publications/vjm/vjm_27/No.3/187-222_Park.PDF |citeseerx=10.1.1.473.5513 |access-date=2018-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], an '''empty product''', or '''nullary product''', is the result of [[multiplication|multiplying]] no factors. It is by convention equal to the multiplicative [[identity element|identity]] [[1 (number)|1]] (assuming there is an identity for the multiplication operation in question), just as the [[empty sum]]&amp;mdash;the result of [[addition|adding]] no numbers&amp;mdash;is by convention [[0 (number)|zero]], or the additive identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Jaroslav Nešetřil]], [[Jiří Matoušek (mathematician)|Jiří Matoušek]] |title=Invitation to Discrete Mathematics |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-19-850207-9 |pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=A.E.

Bloom |title=Linear Algebra and Geometry |year=1979 |isbn=0521293243 |pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''empty product'' is most often used in the above sense when discussing [[arithmetic]] operations. However, the term is sometimes employed when discussing set-theoretic intersections, categorical products, and products in computer programming; these are discussed below.

== Nullary arithmetic product ==
===Justification===
Let ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, … be a sequence of numbers, and let

:&lt;math&gt;P_m = \prod_{i=1}^m a_i = a_1 \cdots  a_m &lt;/math&gt;

be the product of the first ''m'' elements of the sequence. Then

:&lt;math&gt;P_m = a_m \cdot P_{m-1}&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''m'' = 1, 2, … provided that we use the following conventions: &lt;math&gt;P_1 = a_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, a "product" &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; with only one factor evaluates to that factor, while a "product" &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; with no factors at all evaluates to 1. Allowing a "product" with only one or zero factors reduces the number of cases to be considered in many mathematical formulas. Such "products" are natural starting points in [[mathematical induction|induction proofs]], as well as in algorithms. For these reasons, the "empty product is one" convention is common practice in mathematics and computer programming.

=== Relevance of defining empty products ===
The notion of an empty product is useful for the same reason that the number [[0 (number)|zero]] and the [[empty set]] are useful: while they seem to represent quite uninteresting notions, their existence allows for a much shorter mathematical presentation of many subjects.

For example, the empty products 0[[factorial|!]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 shorten [[Taylor series#Definition|Taylor series notation]] (see [[zero to the power of zero]] for a discussion when ''x'' = 0). Likewise, if ''M'' is an ''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' matrix then ''M''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is the ''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' [[identity matrix]], reflecting the fact that applying a [[linear map]] zero times has the same effect as applying the [[identity function|identity map]].

As another example, the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] says that every positive integer can be written uniquely as a product of primes. However, if we do not allow products with only 0 or 1 factors, then the theorem (and its proof) become longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1073.html |title=How Computing Science created a new mathematical style |author=[[Edsger Wybe Dijkstra]] |date=1990-03-04 |work=EWD |accessdate=2010-01-20 | quote=Hardy and Wright: “Every positive integer, except 1, is a product of primes”, Harold M. Stark: “If n is an integer greater than 1, then either n is prime or n is a finite product of primes.”. These examples —which I owe to A.J.M. van Gasteren— both reject the empty product, the last one also rejects the product with a single factor.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://userweb.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD09xx/EWD993.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715202539/http://userweb.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD09xx/EWD993.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-15 |title=The nature of my research and why I do it |author=[[Edsger Wybe Dijkstra]] |date=1986-11-14 |work=EWD |accessdate=2010-07-03 |quote=But also 0 is certainly finite and by defining the product of 0 factors —how else?— to be equal to 1 we can do away with the exception: "If n is a positive integer, then n is a finite product of primes." }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More examples of the use of the empty product in mathematics may be found in the [[binomial theorem]] (which assumes and implies that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 for all ''x''), [[Stirling number]], [[König's theorem (set theory)|König's theorem]], [[binomial type]], [[binomial series]], [[difference operator]] and [[Pochhammer symbol]].

===Logarithms===
Since logarithms turn products into sums, they should map an empty product to an [[empty sum]]. So if we define the empty product to be 1, then the empty sum should be &lt;math&gt;\ln(1)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, the exponential function turns sums into products, so if we define the empty sum to be 0, then the empty product should be &lt;math&gt;e^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_i x_i = e^{\sum_i \ln x_i}&lt;/math&gt;

== Nullary Cartesian product ==
Consider the general definition of the [[Cartesian product]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{i \in I} X_i = \left\{ g : I \to \bigcup_{i \in I} X_i \mid \forall i\ g(i) \in X_i \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''I'' is empty, the only such ''g'' is the [[empty function]] &lt;math&gt;f_\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;, which is the unique subset of &lt;math&gt;\varnothing\times\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; that is a function &lt;math&gt;\varnothing \to \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;, namely the empty subset &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; (the only subset that &lt;math&gt;\varnothing\times\varnothing = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt; has):

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_\varnothing{} = \left\{ f_\varnothing: \varnothing \to \varnothing \right\} = \{\varnothing\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the cardinality of the Cartesian product of no sets is 1.

Under the perhaps more familiar ''n''-[[tuple]] interpretation,

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_\varnothing{} = \{ ( ) \},&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the [[singleton set]] containing the [[empty tuple]]. Note that in both representations the empty product has [[cardinality]] 1.

== Nullary categorical product ==
In any [[category (category theory)|category]], the [[product (category theory)|product]] of an empty family is a [[terminal object]] of that category. This can be demonstrated by using the [[limit (category theory)|limit]] definition of the product. An ''n''-fold categorical product can be defined as the limit with respect to a [[diagram (category theory)|diagram]] given by the [[discrete category]] with ''n'' objects. An empty product is then given by the limit with respect to the empty category, which is the terminal object of the category if it exists. This definition specializes to give results as above. For example, in the [[category of sets]] the categorical product is the usual Cartesian product, and the terminal object is a singleton set. In the [[category of groups]] the categorical product is the Cartesian product of groups, and the terminal object is a trivial group with one element. To obtain the usual arithmetic definition of the empty product we must take the [[decategorification]] of the empty product in the category of finite sets.

[[Dual (category theory)|Dually]], the [[coproduct]] of an empty family is an [[initial object]].
Nullary categorical products or coproducts may not exist in a given category; e.g. in the [[category of fields]], neither exists.

== In logic ==
[[Classical logic]] defines the operation of [[Logical conjunction | conjunction]], which is generalized to [[universal quantification]] in and [[predicate calculus]], and is widely known as logical multiplication because we intuitively identify true with 1 and false with 0 and our conjunction behaves as ordinary multiplier. Multipliers can have arbitrary number of inputs. In case of 0 inputs, we have '''empty conjunction''', which is identically equal to true.

This is related to another concept in logic, [[vacuous truth]], which tells us that empty set of objects can have any property. It can be explained the way that the conjunction (as part of logic in general) deals with values less or equal 1. This means that longer is the conjunction, the higher is probability to end up with 0. Conjunction merely checks the propositions and returns 0 (or false) as soon as one of propositions evaluates to false. Reducing the number of conjoined propositions increases the chance to pass the check and stay with 1. Particularly, if there are 0 tests or members to check, none can fail so, by default, we must always succeed regardless of which propositions or member properties had to be tested.

== In computer programming ==
Many programming languages, such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], allow the direct expression of lists of numbers, and even functions that allow an arbitrary number of parameters. If such a language has a function that returns the product of all the numbers in a list, it usually works like this:

    listprod( [2,3,5] ) --&gt; 30
    listprod( [2,3] )   --&gt; 6
    listprod( [2] )     --&gt; 2
    listprod( [] )      --&gt; 1

This convention helps avoid having to code special cases like "if length of list is 1" or "if length of list is zero" as special cases.

Multiplication is an [[infix notation|infix]] operator and therefore a binary operator, complicating the notation of an empty product. Some programming languages handle this by implementing [[variadic function]]s. For example, the [[S-expression|fully parenthesized prefix notation]] of [[Lisp programming language|Lisp languages]] gives rise to a natural notation for [[nullary]] functions:

 (* 2 2 2)   ; evaluates to 8
 (* 2 2)     ; evaluates to 4
 (* 2)       ; evaluates to 2
 (*)         ; evaluates to 1

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5161">In [[mathematical logic]], two [[theory (mathematical logic)|theories]] are '''equiconsistent''' if the consistency of one theory implies the consistency of the other theory, and [[Vice-versa|vice versa]].  In this case, they are, roughly speaking, "as consistent as each other".

In general, it is not possible to prove the absolute [[consistency]] of a theory ''T''.  Instead we usually take a theory ''S'', believed to be consistent, and try to prove the weaker statement that if ''S'' is consistent then ''T'' must also be consistent—if we can do this we say that ''T'' is ''consistent relative to S''.  If ''S'' is also consistent relative to ''T'' then we say that ''S'' and ''T'' are '''equiconsistent'''.

== Consistency ==

In mathematical logic, formal theories are studied as [[mathematical object]]s. Since some theories are powerful enough to model different mathematical objects, it is natural to wonder about their own [[consistency]].

[[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] proposed a [[Hilbert's program|program]] at the beginning of the 20th century whose ultimate goal was to show, using mathematical methods, the consistency of mathematics. Since most mathematical disciplines can be reduced to [[arithmetic]], the program quickly became the establishment of the consistency of arithmetic by methods formalizable within arithmetic itself. 

[[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]'s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness theorems]] show that Hilbert's program cannot be realized: if a consistent [[recursively enumerable set|recursively enumerable]] theory is strong enough to formalize its own [[metamathematics]] (whether something is a proof or not), i.e. strong enough to model a weak fragment of arithmetic ([[Robinson arithmetic]] suffices), then the theory cannot prove its own consistency. There are some technical caveats as to what requirements the formal statement representing the metamathematical statement "The theory is consistent" needs to satisfy, but the outcome is that if a (sufficiently strong) theory can prove its own consistency then either there is no computable way of identifying whether a statement is even an axiom of the theory or not, or else the theory itself is inconsistent (in which case it can prove anything, including false statements such as its own consistency).

Given this, instead of outright consistency, one usually considers relative consistency: Let ''S'' and ''T'' be formal theories. Assume that ''S'' is a consistent theory. Does it follow that ''T'' is consistent? If so, then ''T is consistent relative to S''. Two theories are equiconsistent if each one is consistent relative to the other.

== Consistency strength ==

If ''T'' is consistent relative to ''S'', but ''S'' is not known to be consistent relative to ''T'', then we say that ''S'' has greater '''consistency strength''' than ''T''.  When discussing these issues of consistency strength the metatheory in which the discussion takes places needs to be carefully addressed. For theories at the level of [[second-order arithmetic]], the [[reverse mathematics]] program has much to say. Consistency strength issues are a usual part of [[set theory]], since this is a recursive theory that can certainly model most of mathematics. The most widely used set of axioms of set theory is called [[ZFC]]. When a set-theoretic statement {{var|A}} is said to be equiconsistent to another {{var|B}}, what is being claimed is that in the metatheory ([[Peano Arithmetic]] in this case) it can be proven that the theories ZFC+{{var|A}} and ZFC+{{var|B}} are equiconsistent. Usually, [[primitive recursive arithmetic]] can be adopted as the metatheory in question, but even if the metatheory is ZFC or an extension of it, the notion is meaningful. The method of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] allows one to show that the theories ZFC, ZFC+CH and ZFC+¬CH are all equiconsistent (where CH denotes the [[continuum hypothesis]]).

When discussing fragments of ZFC or their extensions (for example, ZF, set theory without the axiom of choice, or ZF+AD, set theory with the [[axiom of determinacy]]), the notions described above are adapted accordingly. Thus, ZF is equiconsistent with ZFC, as shown by Gödel.

The consistency strength of numerous combinatorial statements can be calibrated by [[large cardinal]]s.  For example, the negation of [[Kurepa tree|Kurepa's hypothesis]] is equiconsistent with an [[inaccessible cardinal]], the non-existence of special &lt;math&gt;\omega_2&lt;/math&gt;-[[Aronszajn tree]]s is equiconsistent with a [[Mahlo cardinal]], and the non-existence of &lt;math&gt;\omega_2&lt;/math&gt;-[[Aronszajn tree]]s is equiconsistent with a [[weakly compact cardinal]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation | last=Kunen | first=Kenneth | authorlink=Kenneth Kunen | title=Set theory | zbl=1262.03001 | series=Studies in Logic | volume=34 | location=London | publisher=College Publications | isbn=978-1-84890-050-9 | year=2011 | page=225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1744">The '''exponential factorial''' of a positive integer ''n'', denoted by ''n''$, is ''n'' [[exponentiation|raised to the power]] of ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, which in turn is raised to the power of ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2, and so on and so forth, that is,

: &lt;math&gt;n\$ = n^{(n - 1)^{(n - 2) \cdots }}&lt;/math&gt;

The exponential factorial can also be defined with the [[recurrence relation]]

: &lt;math&gt;a_0 = 1,\quad  a_n = n^{a_{n - 1}}&lt;/math&gt;

The first few exponential factorials are [[1 (number)|1]], [[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[9 (number)|9]], 262144, etc. {{OEIS|id=A049384}}. So, for example, [[262144]] is an exponential factorial since

: &lt;math&gt;262144 = 4^{3^{2^{1}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The exponential factorials grow much more quickly than regular [[factorial]]s or even [[hyperfactorial]]s. The exponential factorial of 5 is 5&lt;sup&gt;262144&lt;/sup&gt; which is approximately 6.206069878660874&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183230&lt;/sup&gt;.

The sum of the reciprocals of the exponential factorials from 1 onwards is the [[transcendental number]] 1.6111149258083767361111... {{OEIS2C|id=A080219}}.

Like [[tetration]], there is currently no accepted method of extension of the exponential factorial function to [[real number|real]] and [[complex number|complex]] values of its argument, unlike the [[factorial]] function, for which such an extension is provided by the [[gamma function]].

{{about|a mnemonic|other types of foil|Foil (disambiguation)}}[[Image:MonkeyFaceFOILRule.JPG|thumb|250px|right|A visual representation of the FOIL rule. Each colored line represents two terms that must be multiplied.]]

In [[elementary algebra]], '''''FOIL''''' is a [[mnemonic]] for the standard method of multiplying two [[Binomial (polynomial)|binomials]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wyzant.com/resources/lessons/math/algebra/foil | title=Simplifying using the FOIL Method Lessons | accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;hence the method may be referred to as the '''FOIL method'''. The word ''FOIL'' is an [[acronym]] for the four terms of the product:
* '''F'''irst ("first" terms of each binomial are multiplied together)
* '''O'''uter ("outside" terms are multiplied—that is, the first term of the first binomial and the second term of the second)
* '''I'''nner ("inside" terms are multiplied—second term of the first binomial and first term of the second)
* '''L'''ast ("last" terms of each binomial are multiplied)
The general form is:
: &lt;math&gt;(a+b)(c+d) = \underbrace{ac}_\mathrm{first} + \underbrace{ad}_\mathrm{outside} + \underbrace{bc}_\mathrm{inside} + \underbrace{bd}_\mathrm{last}&lt;/math&gt;
Note that {{math|''a''}} is both a "first" term and an "outer" term; {{math|''b''}} is both a "last" and "inner" term, and so forth. The order of the four terms in the sum is not important, and need not match the order of the letters in the word FOIL.

==History==

The FOIL method is a special case of a more general method for multiplying algebraic expressions using the [[distributive law]]. The word ''FOIL'' was originally intended solely as a [[mnemonic]] for high-school students learning algebra. The term appears in William Betz's 1929 text, ''Algebra for Today'', where he states:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=William|last=Betz|title=Algebra for Today (vol. 1)|year=1929|publisher=Ginn and Company|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;... first terms, outer terms, inner terms, last terms. (The rule stated above may also be remembered by the word FOIL, suggested by the first letters of the words first, outer, inner, last.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
William Betz was active in the mathematics reform movement in the [[United States]] at that time, had written many texts on elementary mathematics topics and had "devoted his life to the improvement of mathematics education."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=W. D. R.|title=Review of Algebra for Today : First Year|journal=The Mathematics Teacher|volume=30|issue=7|date=November 1937|page=348|publisher=National Council for the Teaching of Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many students and educators in the United States now use the word "FOIL" as a [[verb]] meaning "to expand the product of two binomials".{{Fact|date=May 2011}} This [[neologism]] has not gained widespread acceptance in the mathematical community.{{fact|date=March 2012}}

==Examples==
The  method is most commonly used to multiply [[linear function|linear]] binomials. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(x + 3)(x + 5) \,&amp;=\, x\cdot x \,+\, x\cdot 5 \,+\, 3 \cdot x \,+\, 3 \cdot 5 \\
&amp;=\, x^2 + 5x + 3x + 15 \\
&amp;=\, x^2 + 8x + 15
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
If either binomial involves [[subtraction]], the corresponding terms must be negated. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(2x-3)(3x-4) &amp;= (2x)(3x)+(2x)(-4)+(-3)(3x)+(-3)(-4) \\
&amp;= 6x^2 - 8x - 9x + 12 \\
&amp;= 6x^2 - 17x + 12
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==The distributive law==
The FOIL method is equivalent to a two-step process involving the [[distributivity|distributive law]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(a+b)(c+d) &amp;{} = a(c+d) + b(c+d) \\
&amp;{}= ac + ad + bc + bd
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
In the first step, the ({{math|''c'' + ''d''}}) is distributed over the addition in first binomial. In the second step, the distributive law is used to simplify each of the two terms. Note that this process involves a total of three applications of the distributive property. In contrast to the FOIL method, the method using distributive can be applied easily to products with more terms such as trinomials and higher.

==Reverse FOIL==
The FOIL rule converts a [[multiplication|product]] of two binomials into a [[addition|sum]] of four (or fewer, if [[like terms]] are then combined) [[monomial]]s. The reverse process is called ''factoring'' or ''[[factorization]]''. In particular, if the proof above is read in reverse it illustrates the technique called [[Factorization#Factoring by grouping|factoring by grouping]].

==Table as an alternative to FOIL==
A visual memory tool can replace the FOIL mnemonic for a pair of polynomials with any number of terms. Make a table with the terms of the first polynomial on the left edge and the terms of the second on the top edge, then fill in the table with [[multiplication|products]]. The table equivalent to the FOIL rule looks like this.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c|cc}
\times &amp; c &amp; d \\ \hline
a &amp; ac &amp; ad \\
b &amp; bc &amp; bd
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
In the case that these are polynomials, {{math|(''ax'' + ''b'')(''cx'' + ''d'')}}, the terms of a given degree are found by adding along the [[antidiagonal]]s
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c|cc}
\times &amp; cx &amp; d \\ \hline
ax &amp; acx^2 &amp; adx \\
b &amp; bcx &amp; bd
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
so &lt;math&gt;(ax+b)(cx+d) = acx^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd.&lt;/math&gt;

To multiply {{math|(''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'')(''w'' + ''x'' + ''y'' + ''z'')}}, the table would be as follows.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c|cccc}
\times &amp; w &amp; x &amp; y &amp; z \\ \hline
a &amp; aw &amp; ax &amp; ay &amp; az \\
b &amp; bw &amp; bx &amp; by &amp; bz \\
c &amp; cw &amp; cx &amp; cy &amp; cz
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
The sum of the table entries is the product of the polynomials. Thus
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 (a+b+c)(w+x+y+z) &amp; = (aw + ax + ay + az) \\
 &amp; + \,(bw + bx + by + bz) \\
 &amp; + \,(cw + cx + cy + cz) .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, to multiply {{math|(''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx'' + ''c'')(''dx''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''ex''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''fx'' + ''g'')}}, one writes the same table
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c|cccc}
\times &amp; d &amp; e &amp; f &amp; g \\ \hline
a &amp; ad &amp; ae &amp; af &amp; ag \\
b &amp; bd &amp; be &amp; bf &amp; bg \\
c &amp; cd &amp; ce &amp; cf &amp; cg
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
and sums along antidiagonals:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}(ax^2&amp;+bx+c)(dx^3+ex^2+fx+g)\\
&amp;= adx^5 + (ae+bd)x^4 + (af+be+cd)x^3 + (ag+bf+ce)x^2+(bg+cf)x+cg.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==
The FOIL rule cannot be directly applied to expanding products with more than two multiplicands, or multiplicands with more than two summands. However, applying the [[associativity|associative law]] and recursive foiling allows one to expand such products. For instance,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}(a+b+c+d)(x+y+z+w)=&amp;\,((a+b)+(c+d))((x+y)+(z+w)) \\ =&amp;\,(a+b)(x+y)+(a+b)(z+w) \\ &amp;\,{}+(c+d)(x+y)+(c+d)(z+w) \\ =&amp;\,ax+ay+bx+by+az+aw+bz+bw \\ &amp;\,{}+cx+cy+dx+dy+cz+cw+dz+dw. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Alternate methods based on distributing forgo the use of the FOIL rule, but may be easier to remember and apply. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(a+b+c+d)(x+y+z+w)&amp;=(a+(b+c+d))(x+y+z+w) \\
&amp;=a(x+y+z+w)+(b+c+d)(x+y+z+w) \\
&amp;=a(x+y+z+w)+(b+(c+d))(x+y+z+w) \\
&amp;=a(x+y+z+w)+b(x+y+z+w) \\
&amp;\qquad +(c+d)(x+y+z+w) \\
&amp;=a(x+y+z+w)+b(x+y+z+w) \\
&amp;\qquad +c(x+y+z+w)+d(x+y+z+w) \\
&amp;=ax+ay+az+aw+bx+by+bz+bw \\
&amp;\qquad +cx+cy+cz+cw+dx+dy+dz+dw.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7911">In the field of [[mathematical analysis]], a '''general Dirichlet series''' is an [[series (mathematics)|infinite series]] that takes the form of

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n e^{-\lambda_n s},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; are [[complex number]]s and &lt;math&gt;\{\lambda_n\}&lt;/math&gt; is a strictly increasing [[sequence]] of nonnegative [[real numbers]] that tends to infinity.

A simple observation shows that an 'ordinary' [[Dirichlet series]]

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a_n}{n^s},&lt;/math&gt;

is obtained by substituting &lt;math&gt;\lambda_n=\ln n&lt;/math&gt; while a [[power series]]

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n (e^{-s})^n,&lt;/math&gt;

is obtained when &lt;math&gt;\lambda_n=n&lt;/math&gt;.

== Fundamental theorems ==

If a Dirichlet series is convergent at &lt;math&gt;s_0=\sigma_0+t_0i&lt;/math&gt;, then it is [[uniform convergence|uniformly convergent]] in the [[Domain of a function|domain]]

: &lt;math&gt;|\arg(s-s_0)| \leq \theta &lt; \frac \pi 2,&lt;/math&gt;

and [[Convergent series|convergent]] for any &lt;math&gt;s=\sigma+ti&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt;.

There are now three possibilities regarding the convergence of a Dirichlet series, i.e. it may converge for all, for none or for some values of ''s''. In the latter case, there exist a &lt;math&gt;\sigma_c&lt;/math&gt; such that the series is convergent for &lt;math&gt;\sigma&gt;\sigma_c&lt;/math&gt; and [[divergent series|divergent]] for &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;\sigma_c&lt;/math&gt;. By convention, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_c=\infty&lt;/math&gt; if the series converges nowhere and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_c=-\infty&lt;/math&gt; if the series converges everywhere on the [[complex plane]].

== Abscissa of convergence ==

The '''abscissa of convergence''' of a Dirichlet series can be defined as &lt;math&gt;\sigma_c&lt;/math&gt; above. Another equivalent definition is

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_c = \inf\left\{\sigma\in\mathbb{R}:\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n e^{-\lambda_n s} \text{ converges for every } s \text{ for which } \operatorname{Re}(s)&gt;\sigma \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The line &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\sigma_c&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''line of convergence'''. The '''half-plane of convergence''' is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_{\sigma_c}=\{s\in\mathbb{C}: \operatorname{Re}(s)&gt;\sigma_c\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[abscissa]], [[line (geometry)|line]] and [[Half-space (geometry)|half-plane]] of convergence of a Dirichlet series are analogous to [[radius]], [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] and [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] of convergence of a [[power series]].

On the line of convergence, the question of convergence remains open as in the case of power series. However, if a Dirichlet series converges and diverges at different points on the same vertical line, then this line must be the line of convergence. The proof is implicit in the definition of abscissa of convergence. An example would be the series

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac 1 n e^{-ns},&lt;/math&gt;

which converges at &lt;math&gt;s=-\pi i&lt;/math&gt; ([[harmonic series (mathematics)|alternating harmonic series]]) and diverges at &lt;math&gt;s=0&lt;/math&gt; ([[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]]). Thus, &lt;math&gt;\sigma=0&lt;/math&gt; is the line of convergence.

Suppose that a Dirichlet series does not converge at &lt;math&gt;s=0&lt;/math&gt;, then it is clear that &lt;math&gt;\sigma_c\geq0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sum a_n&lt;/math&gt; diverges. On the other hand, if a Dirichlet series converges at &lt;math&gt;s=0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\sigma_c\leq0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sum a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges. Thus, there are two formulas to compute &lt;math&gt;\sigma_c&lt;/math&gt;, depending on the convergence of &lt;math&gt;\sum a_n&lt;/math&gt; which can be determined by various [[convergence tests]]. These formulas are similar to the [[Cauchy–Hadamard theorem]] for the radius of convergence of a power series.

If &lt;math&gt;\sum a_k&lt;/math&gt; is divergent, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\sigma_c\geq0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\sigma_c&lt;/math&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_c=\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{\log|a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n|}{\lambda_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\sum a_k&lt;/math&gt; is convergent, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\sigma_c\leq0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\sigma_c&lt;/math&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_c=\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{\log|a_{n+1}+a_{n+2}+\cdots|}{\lambda_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Abscissa of absolute convergence ==

A Dirichlet series is [[absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]] if the series

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n e^{-\lambda_n s}|,&lt;/math&gt;

is convergent. As usual, an absolutely convergent Dirichlet series is convergent, but the [[Theorem#Converse|converse]] is not always true.

If a Dirichlet series is absolutely convergent at &lt;math&gt;s_0&lt;/math&gt;, then it is absolutely convergent for all ''s'' where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}(s) &gt; \operatorname{Re}(s_0)&lt;/math&gt;. A Dirichlet series may converge absolutely for all, for no or for some values of ''s''. In the latter case, there exist a &lt;math&gt;\sigma_a&lt;/math&gt; such that the series converges absolutely for &lt;math&gt;\sigma&gt;\sigma_a&lt;/math&gt; and converges non-absolutely for &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;\sigma_a&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''abscissa of absolute convergence''' can be defined as &lt;math&gt;\sigma_a&lt;/math&gt; above, or equivalently as

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sigma_a=\inf \Big\{\sigma\in\mathbb{R}:\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n e^{-\lambda_n s} &amp; \text{ converges absolutely for} \\
&amp; \text{every } s \text{ for which} \operatorname{Re}(s)&gt;\sigma\Big\}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The '''line''' and '''half-plane of absolute convergence''' can be defined similarly. There are also two formulas to compute &lt;math&gt;\sigma_a&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\sum |a_k|&lt;/math&gt; is divergent, then &lt;math&gt;\sigma_a&lt;/math&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_a=\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{\log(|a_1|+|a_2|+\cdots+|a_n|)}{\lambda_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\sum |a_k|&lt;/math&gt; is convergent, then &lt;math&gt;\sigma_a&lt;/math&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_a=\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{\log(|a_{n+1}|+|a_{n+2}|+\cdots)}{\lambda_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the abscissa of convergence does not coincide with abscissa of absolute convergence. Thus, there might be a strip between the line of convergence and absolute convergence where a Dirichlet series is [[conditional convergence|conditionally convergent]]. The width of this strip is given by

: &lt;math&gt;0\leq\sigma_a-\sigma_c\leq L:=\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{\log n}{\lambda_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case where ''L'' = 0, then

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_c=\sigma_a=\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{\log |a_n|}{\lambda_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

All the formulas provided so far still hold true for 'ordinary' [[Dirichlet series]] by substituting &lt;math&gt;\lambda_n=\log n&lt;/math&gt;.

== Analytic functions ==

A [[Function (mathematics)|function]] represented by a Dirichlet series

: &lt;math&gt;f(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n e^{-\lambda_n s},&lt;/math&gt;

is [[Analytic function|analytic]] on the half-plane of convergence. Moreover, for &lt;math&gt;k=1,2,3,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;f^{(k)}(s)=(-1)^k\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n\lambda_n^k e^{-\lambda_n s}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Further generalizations ==

A Dirichlet series can be further generalized to the [[variable (mathematics)|multi-variable]] case where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_n\in\mathbb{R}^k&lt;/math&gt;, ''k'' = 2, 3, 4,..., or [[complex analysis|complex variable]] case where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_n\in\mathbb{C}^m&lt;/math&gt;, ''m'' = 1, 2, 3,...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11497">In [[mathematical physics]], '''geometric quantization''' is a mathematical approach to defining a [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] corresponding to a given [[classical theory]]. It attempts to carry out [[Quantization (physics)|quantization]], for which there is [[in general]] no exact recipe, in such a way that certain analogies between the classical theory and the quantum theory remain manifest. For example, the similarity between the Heisenberg equation in the [[Heisenberg picture]] of [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[Hamilton equation]] in classical physics should be built in.

==Origins==

One of the earliest attempts at a natural quantization was [[Weyl quantization]], proposed by [[Hermann Weyl]] in 1927. Here, an attempt is made to associate a quantum-mechanical observable (a [[self-adjoint operator]] on a [[Hilbert space]]) with a real-valued function on classical [[phase space]]. The position and momentum in this phase space are mapped to the generators of the [[Heisenberg group]], and the Hilbert space appears as a [[group representation]] of the [[Heisenberg group]].  In 1946, [[Hilbrand J. Groenewold |
H. J.  Groenewold]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Groenewold| title=On the Principles of elementary quantum mechanics| journal=Physica| volume=12| year= 1946| pages=405–460| bibcode=1946Phy....12..405G| doi=10.1016/S0031-8914(46)80059-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  considered the product of a pair of such observables and asked what the corresponding function would be on the classical phase space. This led him to discover the [[Moyal product|phase-space star-product]] of a pair of functions.

The modern theory of geometric quantization was developed by [[Bertram Kostant]] and [[Jean-Marie Souriau]] in the 1970s. One of the motivations of the theory was to understand and generalize Kirillov's [[orbit method]] in representation theory.

==Deformation quantization==

More generally, this technique leads to [[deformation quantization]], where the  ★-product is taken to be a deformation of the algebra of functions on a [[symplectic manifold]] or [[Poisson manifold]]. However, as a natural  quantization scheme (a functor), Weyl's map is not satisfactory. For example, the Weyl map of the classical angular-momentum-squared  is not just the quantum angular momentum squared operator, but it further contains a constant term 3ħ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2. (This extra term is actually physically significant, since it accounts for the nonvanishing angular momentum of the ground-state Bohr orbit in the hydrogen atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dahl | first1 = J. | last2 = Schleich | first2 = W. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.65.022109 | title = Concepts of radial and angular kinetic energies | journal = Physical Review A | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2002PhRvA..65b2109D |arxiv = quant-ph/0110134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a mere representation change, however, Weyl's map underlies the alternate [[Phase space formulation]] of conventional quantum mechanics.

==Geometric quantization==

The geometric quantization procedure falls into the following three steps: prequantization, polarization, and metaplectic correction. Prequantization produces a natural Hilbert space together with a quantization procedure for observables that exactly transforms Poisson brackets on the classical side into commutators on the quantum side. Nevertheless, the prequantum Hilbert space is generally understood to be "too big".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 22.3&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that one should then select a Poisson-commuting set of ''n'' variables on the 2''n''-dimensional phase space and consider functions (or, more properly, sections) that depend only on these ''n'' variables. The ''n'' variables can be either real-valued, resulting in a position-style Hilbert space, or complex-valued, producing something like the [[Segal–Bargmann space]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 22.4 for simple examples&lt;/ref&gt; A polarization is a coordinate-independent description of such a choice of ''n'' Poisson-commuting functions. The metaplectic correction (also known as the half-form correction) is a technical modification of the above procedure that is necessary in the case of real polarizations and often convenient for complex polarizations.

===Prequantization===

Suppose &lt;math&gt;(M,\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is a symplectic manifold with symplectic form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose at first that &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is exact, meaning that there is a globally defined ''symplectic potential'' &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;d\theta=\omega&lt;/math&gt;. We can consider the "prequantum Hilbert space" of square-integrable functions on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; (with respect to the Liouville volume measure). For each smooth function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, we can define the Kostant–Souriau prequantum operator
:&lt;math&gt;Q(f):= - i\hbar\left( X_f -\frac{i}{\hbar}\theta(X_f)\right) +f&lt;/math&gt;.
where &lt;math&gt;X_f&lt;/math&gt; is the Hamiltonian vector field associated to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

More generally, suppose &lt;math&gt;(M,\omega)&lt;/math&gt; has the property that the integral of &lt;math&gt;\omega/(2\pi\hbar)&lt;/math&gt; over any closed surface is an integer. Then we can construct a line bundle &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with connection whose curvature 2-form is &lt;math&gt;\omega/\hbar&lt;/math&gt;. In that case, the prequantum Hilbert space is the space of square-integrable sections of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, and we replace the formula for &lt;math&gt;Q(f)&lt;/math&gt; above with
:&lt;math&gt;Q(f)= - i\hbar\nabla_{X_f}+f&lt;/math&gt;,
with &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; the connection.
The prequantum operators satisfy 
:&lt;math&gt;[Q(f),Q(g)]=i\hbar Q(\{ f,g\} )&lt;/math&gt;
for all smooth functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Theorem 23.14&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the preceding Hilbert space and the operators &lt;math&gt;Q(f)&lt;/math&gt; is known as ''prequantization''.

===Polarization===
The next step in the process of geometric quantization is the choice of a polarization. A polarization is a choice at each point in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; a Lagrangian subspace of the complexified tangent space of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. The subspaces should form an integrable distribution, meaning that the commutator of two vector fields lying in the subspace at each point should also lie in the vector field at each point. The ''quantum'' (as opposed to prequantum) Hilbert space is the space of sections of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; that are covariantly constant in the direction of the polarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 23.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Section 22.4 of {{harvnb|Hall|2013}} for examples in the Euclidean case&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that in the quantum Hilbert space, the sections should be functions of only &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables on the &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional classical phase space.

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a function for which the associated Hamiltonian flow preserves the polarization, then &lt;math&gt;Q(f)&lt;/math&gt; will preserve the quantum Hilbert space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Theorem 23.24&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption that the flow of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; preserve the polarization is a strong one. Typically not very many functions will satisfy this assumption.

===Half-form correction===
The half-form correction—also known as the metaplectic correction—is a technical modification to the above procedure that is necessary in the case of real polarizations to obtain a nonzero quantum Hilbert space; it is also often useful in the complex case. The line bundle &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by the tensor product of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with the square root of the canonical bundle of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of the vertical polarization, for example, instead of considering functions &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; that are independent of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, one considers objects of the form &lt;math&gt;f(x)\sqrt{dx}&lt;/math&gt;. The formula for &lt;math&gt;Q(f)&lt;/math&gt; must then be supplemented by an additional Lie derivative term.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Sections 23.6 and 23.7&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a complex polarization on the plane, for example, the half-form correction allows the quantization of the harmonic oscillator to reproduce the standard quantum mechanical formula for the energies, &lt;math&gt;(n+1/2)\hbar\omega&lt;/math&gt;, with the "&lt;math&gt;+1/2&lt;/math&gt;" coming courtesy of the half-forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Example 23.53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poisson manifolds===

Geometric quantization of Poisson manifolds and symplectic foliations also is developed. For instance, this is the case of [[integrable system|partially integrable]] and [[superintegrable Hamiltonian system|superintegrable]] Hamiltonian systems and [[non-autonomous mechanics]].

==Example==

In the case that the symplectic manifold is the [[sphere|2-sphere]], it can be realized as a [[coadjoint orbit]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{su}(2)^*&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming that the area of the sphere is an integer multiple of &lt;math&gt;2\pi\hbar&lt;/math&gt;, we can perform geometric quantization
and the resulting Hilbert space carries an irreducible representation of [[SU(2)]]. In the case that the area of the sphere is &lt;math&gt;2\pi\hbar&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the two-dimensional [[spin 1/2]] representation.

A '''hand compass''' (also '''hand bearing compass''' or '''sighting compass''') is a compact magnetic [[compass]] capable of one-hand use and fitted with a sighting device to record a precise [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] or [[azimuth]] to a given target or to determine a location.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, Persifor, ''A Convenient Device to be Applied to the Hand Compass'', Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 22, No. 118 (Mar., 1885), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SCFC, ''Get Acquainted With Forestry Tools'' [http://www.state.sc.us/forest/edutools.htm Article]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hand or sighting compasses include instruments with simple notch-and-post alignment ("gunsights"), [[Prism (optics)|prismatic]] sights, direct or lensatic sights,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Mark, ''The Ultimate Desert Handbook: A Manual for Desert Hikers, Campers, and Travelers'', McGraw-Hill Professional (2003), {{ISBN|0-07-139303-X}}, 9780071393034, p. 134: A ''direct-sighting'' compass uses a magnifying viewfinder mounted in the compass body to directly view a degreed dial and superimposed indicator line; it therefore differs from a ''lensatic sight'' (which uses a simple magnifying lens on a folding arm positioned over the dial), or a ''prismatic sight'' (which uses a magnifying optical prism).&lt;/ref&gt; and mirror/vee (reflected-image) sights.  With the additional precision offered by the sighting arrangement, and depending upon construction, sighting compasses provide increased accuracy when measuring precise bearings to an objective.&lt;ref&gt;Suunto Oy, ''The Suunto KB-14 Story'', [http://www.suunto.com/suunto/main/product_long.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673940088&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723697223383&amp;bmUID=1126122282413 Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409005038/http://www.suunto.com/suunto/main/product_long.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673940088&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723697223383&amp;bmUID=1126122282413 |date=2008-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''hand compass'' is used by some in the forestry and surveying professions to refer to a certain type of hand compass optimized for use in those fields, also known as a '''forester''' or '''cruiser''' compass.&lt;ref&gt;Rutstrum, ''The Wilderness Route Finder'', University of Minnesota Press (2000), {{ISBN|0-8166-3661-3}}, pp. 47-55, 64-72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mooers Jr., Robert L. ''Finding Your Way In The Outdoors'', Outdoor Life Press (1972), {{ISBN|0-943822-41-6}}, p. 47: The term ''cruiser compass'' derives from the practice of foresters ''cruising'' or estimating the value of a stand of timber by taking compass readings to ascertain the size of the stand.&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''hand compass'' may also include the various one-hand or 'pocket' versions of the surveyor's or geologist's '''[[Brunton compass|transit]]'''.

==History and use==
[[File:Brunton.JPG|thumb|A standard Brunton Geo, used commonly by geologists]]
While small portable compasses fitted with mechanical sighting devices have existed for a few hundred years, the first one-hand compass with a sighting device appeared around 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Frazor, Persifor, ''A Convenient Device to be Applied to the Hand Compass'', Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 22, No. 118 (Mar., 1885), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;  These soon evolved into more elaborate and specialized models such as the Brunton ''Pocket Transit'' patented in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, William J., ''The Brunton Pocket Transit'', 26 January 2005 [http://brunton.williamjhudson.net/ Article]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hand compasses were soon widely employed in the practice of [[forestry]], [[geology]], [[archaeology]], [[speleology]], preliminary [[cartography]] and [[land surveying]].

[[File:Stratum compass-clar hg.jpg|thumb|left|Compass used by engineering geologists]]
In the United States, the hand compass became very popular among foresters seeking a compass to plot and estimate stands of timber.  While the ''Pocket Transit'' was more than adequate for such work, it was relatively expensive.  Consequently, a new type of hand compass was introduced: the ''forester'' or ''cruiser compass''.  Traditionally, ''cruiser'' compasses featured a sighting notch, a mechanically-damped&lt;ref&gt;Mooers Jr., Robert L. ''Finding Your Way In The Outdoors'', Outdoor Life Press (1972), {{ISBN|0-943822-41-6}}, pp. 48-49: Most of the traditional designs used a momentary button lock mechanism that froze the needle in position to stop excessive swing and permit a reading.&lt;/ref&gt; or "dry" needle, adjustable declination and a large dial marked in individual degrees using counterclockwise calibration (reversed east and west positions).  A screw base for a [[tripod]] or ''[[Jacob Staff|jacob staff]]'' ([[monopod]]) was often fitted as well.&lt;ref&gt;Rutstrum, pp. 47-55, 64-72&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s many foresters had begun using more modern liquid-damped compass designs, including mirror-sight protractor models such as the ''[[Silva compass|Silva Type 15 ''Ranger'']]'' or the ''[[Suunto|Suunto MC-1]]'' (later, the ''MC-2'').  These compasses were fast to use, particularly along straight cruise lines and were sufficiently accurate for most forestry applications.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner Soil &amp; Water Conservation District, ''Idaho State Forestry Contest'' (October 2004), p. 25 [http://www.idl.idaho.gov/Bureau/ForestAssist/forestry_2005_contest/forestry_contest_manual_04.pdf Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215235309/http://www.idl.idaho.gov/bureau/ForestAssist/forestry_2005_contest/forestry_contest_manual_04.pdf |date=2008-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, geologists, [[speleologists]], [[archaeologist]]s, [[Ornithology|ornithologists]], and foresters engaged in precision survey work often used direct-reading models such as the ''Suunto KB-14'', prismatic compasses such as Suunto ''KB-77'' or the traditional Brunton ''Pocket Transit''.&lt;ref&gt;Nix, Steve, ''The Best Forestry Field Compass'' [http://forestry.about.com/od/toppicks/tp/compass_fav.htm Article]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suunto Oy, ''The Suunto KB-14 Story''&lt;/ref&gt;  Many models featured an optional [[quadrant (plane geometry)|quadrant]] (0-90-0 degree) scale instead of an [[azimuth]]al (0-360 degree) system.&lt;ref&gt;Rutstrum, pp. 47-55, 197-199&lt;/ref&gt;

By using a hand compass in combination with aerial photographs and maps a person can determine his/her location in the field, determine direction to landmarks or destinations, estimate distance, estimate area, and find points of interest (marked boundary lines, USGS marker, plot centers).  For increased accuracy, many professional hand compasses continue to be fitted with [[tripod]] mounts.&lt;ref&gt;Rutstrum, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;  While the hand compass continues to be widely employed in such work, it has been increasingly supplanted in recent years by use of the GPS, or [[Global Positioning System]] receiver.

===Marine hand bearing compass===
[[File:Boussole prisme groupe.jpg|thumb|right|''Floating-card'' compass with prismatic sight (bearing 220° through eyepiece)]]

The marine hand compass, or [[hand bearing compass|hand-bearing compass]] as it is termed in nautical use, has been used by small-boat or inshore sailors since at least the 1920s to keep a running course or to record precise bearings to landmarks on shore in order to determine position via the [[Resection (orientation)|resection]] technique.&lt;ref&gt;Casey, Don, ''Using a Hand Bearing Compass'' [http://www.boatus.com/boattech/casey/27.htm Article]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, David, ''The Complete Sailor: Learning the Art of Sailing'', McGraw-Hill Professional (1995), {{ISBN|0-07-057131-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-07-057131-0}}, pp. 190-194&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of a magnetized needle or disc, most hand bearing compasses feature liquid damping with a ''floating card'' design (a magnetized, degreed float or dial atop a jeweled pivot bearing).&lt;ref&gt;Dickison, Dan, ''Powerboat Reports Guide to Powerboat Gear: Take the Guesswork Out of Gear Buying'', Globe Pequot Press (2006), {{ISBN|1-59228-069-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59228-069-8}}, pp. 91-93&lt;/ref&gt;  Equipped with a viewing prism, the hand bearing compass allows instant reading of forward bearings from the user to an object or vessel, and some provide the reciprocal bearing as well.&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, pp. 190-194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dickison, pp. 91-93&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern examples of marine hand bearing compasses include the ''Suunto KB-14'' and ''KB-77'', and the ''Plastimo Iris 50''.&lt;ref&gt;Suunto Oy, ''The Suunto KB-14 Story''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dickison, pp. 91-93&lt;/ref&gt;  These compasses frequently have battery-illuminated or [[photoluminescent]] degree dials for use in low light or darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Dickison, pp. 91-93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suunto Oy, ''The Suunto KB-14 Story''&lt;/ref&gt;

''How Not to Be Wrong'' explains the [[mathematics]] behind some of simplest day-to-day thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-jordan-ellenberg-how-not-to-be-wrong-20140617-story.html|title=In 'How Not to Be Wrong' Jordan Ellenberg makes math meaningful|last=Times|first=Los Angeles|date=|website=LA Times|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then goes into more complex decisions people make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/f617ecd6-f15c-11e3-9161-00144feabdc0.html|title=‘How Not To Be Wrong: The Hidden Maths of Everyday Life’, by Jordan Ellenberg|last=Bird|first=Review by Orlando|date=2014-06-13|work=|newspaper=Financial Times|issn=0307-1766|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_not_to_be_wrong/2014/06/13/how_not_to_be_wrong_the_author_of_the_book_explains_when_he_was_wrong.html|title=How I Was Wrong|last=Ellenberg|first=Jordan|date=2014-06-13|work=|newspaper=Slate|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Ellenberg explains  many misconceptions about [[Lottery|lotteries]] and whether or not they can be mathematically beaten.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onwisconsin.uwalumni.com/features/thinking-inside-the-box/|title=Thinking  Inside the Box {{!}} On Wisconsin|last=|first=|date=|website=OnWisconsin|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/meetings/calendar-events/how-to-get-rich-playing-the-lottery|title=How to Get Rich Playing the Lottery {{!}} Mathematical Association of America|last=|first=|date=|website=www.maa.org|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellenberg uses mathematics to examine real-world issues ranging from the fetishizing of straight lines in the reporting of obesity to the game theory of missing flights, from the relevance to digestion of regression to the mean to the counter-intuitive [[Berkson's paradox]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/airport-utility-how-not-to-be-wrong-2014-6|title=Mathematician Explains How To Figure Out What Time To Get To The Airport Before Your Flight|last=|first=|date=|website=Business Insider|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chapter Summaries ==

=== PART 1: Linearity ===
CHAPTER 1, LESS LIKE SWEDEN: Ellenberg encourages his readers to think nonlinearly, and know that “where you should go depends on where you are”. To develop his thought, he relates this to [[Reaganomics|Voodoo economics]] and the [[Laffer curve]] of taxation. Although there are little to no numbers in this chapter, the point is that the overall concept still ties back to mathematical thinking.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Not To Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking|last=Ellenberg|first=Jordan|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=978-0-14-312753-6|location=|pages=21–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CHAPTER 2, STRAIGHT LOCALLY, CURVED GLOBALLY: This chapter puts an emphasis on recognizing that “not every curve is a straight line”, and makes reference to multiple mathematical concepts including the Pythagorean theorem, the derivation of Pi, [[Zeno's paradoxes|Zeno’s paradox]], and [[non-standard analysis]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

CHAPTER 3, EVERYONE IS OBESE: Here, Ellenberg dissects some common statistics about Obesity trends in the United States. He ties it into [[linear regression]], and points out basic contradictions made by the original arguments presented. He uses many examples to make his point, including the correlation between SAT scores and tuition rates, as well as the trajectory of missiles.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

CHAPTER 4, HOW MANY IS THAT IN DEAD AMERICANS: Ellenberg analyzes statistics about the number of casualties around the world in different countries resulting from war. He notes that although proportion in these cases matters, it doesn’t always necessarily make sense when relating them to American deaths. He uses examples of deaths due to brain cancer, the [[Binomial theorem|Binomial Theorem]], and voting polls to reinforce his point.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

CHAPTER 5, MORE PIE THAN PLATE: This chapter goes in depth with number percentages relating to employment rates, and references political allegations. He emphasizes that “actual numbers in these cases aren’t important, but knowing what to divide by what is mathematics in its truest form”, noting that mathematics in itself is in everything.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== PART 2: Inference ===
CHAPTER 6, THE BALTIMORE STOCKBROKER AND THE BIBLE CODE: Ellenberg tries to get across that mathematics is in every single thing that we do. To support this, he uses examples about hidden codes in the Torah determined by ELS, [[Bible code|Equidistant Letter Sequence]], a Stockbroker parable, noting that “Improbable things happen”, and wiggle room attributes to that.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Not To Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking|last=Ellenberg|first=Jordan|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=89–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CHAPTER 7, DEAD FISH DON’T READ MINDS: This chapter touches on a lot of things. The basis for this chapter are stories about a dead salmons MRI, trial and error in algebra, and birth control statistics as well as basketball statistics. He also notes that poetry can be compared to mathematics in that it’s “trained by exposure to stimuli, and manipulable in the lab”. Additionally, he writes of a few other mathematical concepts, including [[Null hypothesis]] and the [[Quartic function|Quantic Formula]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

CHAPTER 8, REDUCTIO AD UNLIKELY: This chapter focuses on the works and theorems/concepts of many famous mathematicians and philosophers. These include but aren’t limited to the [[Reductio ad absurdum|Reductio Ad Absurdum]] by [[Aristotle]], a look into the [[Taurus (constellation)|constellation Taurus]] by John Mitchell, and Yitang “Tom” Zhangs “bounded gaps” conjecture. He also delves into explaining rational numbers, the [[prime number theorem]], and makes up his own word, “flogarithms”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

CHAPTER 9, THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HARUSPICY: Ellenberg relates the practice of [[Haruspex|Haruspicy]], genes that affect Schizophrenia, and the accuracy of published papers as well as other things to the [[P-value|“P value”]] or Statistical Significance. He also notes at the end that [[Jerzy Neyman]] and [[Egon Pearson]] claimed that Statistics is about doing, not interpreting, and then relates this to other real-world examples.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

CHAPTER 10, ARE YOU THERE GOD? IT’S ME, BAYESIAN INFERENCE: This chapter relates Algorithms to things ranging from God, to [[Netflix]] movie recommendations, and to terrorism on [[Facebook]]. Ellenberg goes through quite a few mathematical concepts in this chapter, which include Conditional probabilities relating back to “P value”, Posterior Possibilities, [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian Inference]], and [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes Theorem]] as they correlate to Radio Psychics and Probability. Additionally, he uses [[Punnett square|Punnett Squares]] and other methods to explore the probability of Gods existence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== PART 3: Expectation ===
CHAPTER 11, WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU’RE EXPECTING TO WIN THE LOTTERY: This chapter discusses the different probabilities of winning the lottery and expected value as it relates to lottery tickets, including the story of how [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] students managed to “win” the lottery every time in their town. Ellenberg also talks about the Law of Large numbers again, as well as introducing the Additivity of expected value and the games of Franc-Carreau or the “noodle/needle problem”. Many mathematicians and other famous people are mentioned in this chapter, including [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Georges-Louis LeClerc]], [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]], and James Harvey.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Not To Be Wrong:The Power of Mathematical Thinking|last=Ellenberg|first=Jordan|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=196–291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CHAPTER 12, MISS MORE PLANES: The mathematical concepts in this chapter include Utility and [[Utility|Utils]], and the Laffer curve again. This chapter discusses the amount of time spent in the airport as it relates to flights being missed, [[Daniel Ellsberg]], Blaise Pascal’s Pense’s, the probability of God once more, and the [[St. Petersburg paradox|St. Petersburg Paradox]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

CHAPTER 13, WHERE THE TRAIN TRACKS MEET: This chapter includes discussions about the Lottery again, and Geometry in Renaissance paintings. It introduces some things about coding, including Error Correcting Code, [[Hamming code|Hamming Code]], and code words. It also mentions Hamming distance at it relates to language. The mathematical concepts included in this chapter are [[Variance]], the [[Projective plane|Projective Plane]], the [[Fano plane]], and the Face centered cubic lattice.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== PART 4: Regression ===
CHAPTER 14, THE TRIUMPH OF MEDIOCRITY: This chapter discusses Mediocrity in everyday business according to [[Horace Secrist]]. It also includes discussions about [[Francis Galton]]’s “Hereditary Genius”, and baseball statistics about home runs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Not To Be Wrong:The Power of Mathematical Thinking|last=Ellenberg|first=Jordan|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=295–362}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Mpl_example_scatter_plot.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mpl_example_scatter_plot.svg|thumb|Scatter plot example]]CHAPTER 15, GALTONS ELLIPSE: This chapter focuses on [[Francis Galton|Sir Francis Galton]], and his work on [[scatter plot]]s, as well as the ellipses formed by them, correlation and causation, and the development from linear systems to quadratics. This chapter also addressed conditional and unconditional expectation, [[Regression toward the mean|regression to the mean]], [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]], [[Bivariate normal distribution]], and dimensions in geometry.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

CHAPTER 16, DOES LUNG CANCER MAKE YOU SMOKE CIGARETTES: This chapter explores the correlation between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer, using work from R.A Fisher. It also goes into [[Berkson's paradox|Berkson’s Fallacy]], and uses the attractiveness of men to develop the thought, and talks about common effect at the end.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== PART 5: Existence ===
CHAPTER 17, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS PUBLIC OPINION: This chapter delves into the workings of a majority rules system, and points out the contradictions and confusion of it all, ultimately stating that public opinion doesn’t exist. It uses many examples to make its point, including different election statistics, the death sentence of a mentally retarded person, and a case with [[Antonin Scalia|Justice Antonin Scalia]]. It also includes mathematical terms/concepts such as [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]], Asymmetric Domination effect, and Condorcet paradoxes.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Not To Be Wrong:The Power of Mathematical Thinking|last=Ellenberg|first=Jordan|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=365–420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CHAPTER 18, “OUT OF NOTHING, I HAVE CREATED A STRANGE NEW UNIVERSE”: This chapter talks about [[János Bolyai|János Bolyais,]] and his work on the parallel postulate. Others mentioned in this chapter include [[David Hilbert]], and [[Gottlob Frege]]. It also explored points and lines, Formalism, and what the author calls a “Genius” mentality.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== HOW TO BE RIGHT ===
This last chapter introduces one last concept, ''[[Principle of explosion|ex falso quodlibet]],'' and mentions [[Theodore Roosevelt]], as well as the election between [[Barack Obama|Obama]] and [[Mitt Romney|Romney]]. The author ends the novel with encouraging statements, noting that it’s okay to not know everything, and that we all learn from failure. He ends saying that to love math is to be “touched by fire and bound by reason”, and that we should all use it well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Not To Be Wrong:The Power of Mathematical Thinking|last=Ellenberg|first=Jordan|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=421–437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2294">'''Igor Alexeyevich Shelushkov''' ({{circa|1946}} – ?) was a [[Soviet]] [[mental calculator]]. He mentally extracted [[nth root|roots]] of large numbers and calculated the number of syllables and characters in a given verse by listening. Shelushkov was featured in the 1968 Soviet [[popular science]] film ''Seven Steps Beyond the Horizon'', where he mentally extracted the sixth root of a 12-digit number and the 77th root of another multi-digit number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6vARc4HB4&amp;list=LLIhIx553p2difqPN9m9VgfA| script-title=ru:Эпизод из фильма "Семь шагов за горизонт" (1968)|trans-title=An episode from the film ''Seven Steps Beyond the Horizon'' (1968)|language=Russian|publisher =[[YouTube]]| accessdate = 23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelushkov also competed with the Soviet [[third generation computer]] Mir. He extracted the 77th root of a 148-digit number in 18 seconds, while it took about 10 minutes to program the related operation for computer.&lt;ref name="lib"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://lib.ru/NTL/KIBERNETIKA/ZAHARCHENKO/elektricheskij_mozg.txt| script-title=ru:Разговор с электрическим мозгом|language=Russian|author=Захарченко В.

Shelushkov was a postgraduate at Gorki Polytechnic Institute (now [[Nizhny Novgorod State Technical University]]). According to Shelushkov, he used the memorized [[logarithm]]ic table for calculations.&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt; His abilities were mentioned by Russian mathematician Vladimir Tvorogov, who attended one of his performances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.aif.ru/health/article/50932| script-title=ru:Стать гением может каждый, или Кто такие люди-счётчики?|language=Russian|author=Дмитрий Писаренко|publisher =''[[Argumenty i Fakty]]''| accessdate = 23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by psychologist Artur Petrovsky. Shelushkov's subsequent fate is unclear.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Jacquet module''' ''J''(''V'') of a [[linear representation]] ''V'' of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''N'' is the space of co-invariants of ''N''; or in other words the largest quotient of ''V'' on which ''N'' acts trivially, or the zeroth [[homology group]] H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''N'',''V''). 

The '''Jacquet functor''' ''J'' is the [[functor]] taking ''V'' to its Jacquet module ''J''(''V''). Use of the phrase "Jacquet module" often implies that ''V'' is an [[admissible representation]] of a [[reductive algebraic group]] ''G'' over a [[local field]], and ''N'' is the [[unipotent radical]] of a [[parabolic subgroup]] of ''G''. In the case of ''p''-adic groups they were studied by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Hervé Jacquet| last=Jacquet|first=Hervé|year=1971}}.

In mathematics, a '''locally finite poset''' is a [[partially ordered set]] ''P'' such that for all ''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''P'', the [[poset#Interval|interval]] [''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''] consists of [[finite set|finitely]] many elements.

Given a locally finite poset ''P'' we can define its ''[[incidence algebra]]''. Elements of the incidence algebra are functions ''ƒ'' that assign to each interval [''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''] of ''P'' a real number ''ƒ''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''). These functions form an [[associative algebra]] with a product defined by

: &lt;math&gt;(f * g)(x,y):=\sum_{x \leq z \leq y} f(x,z) g(z,y).&lt;/math&gt;

There is also a definition of ''[[incidence coalgebra]]''.

In [[theoretical physics]] a locally finite poset is also called a [[causal set]] and has been used as a model for [[spacetime]].

'''Mark Steiner''' (born  May 6, 1942) is a professor of [[philosophy]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], where he specializes in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] and [[philosophy of physics|physics]]. He is best known for his book ''The Applicability of Mathematics as a Philosophical Problem'', in which he attempted to explain the historical utility of [[mathematics]] in [[physics]]. The book may be considered an extended meditation on the issues raised by [[Eugene Wigner]]'s article ''[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]'' [http://www.designinference.com/documents/1999.07.steiner_review.htm]. The publisher writes, "Steiner argues that, on the contrary, these laws were discovered, using manmade mathematical analogies, resulting in an anthropocentric picture of the universe as "user friendly" to human cognition—a challenge to the entrenched dogma of naturalism." Steiner is also the author of the book ''Mathematical Knowledge''.

He earned his Ph.D. at [[Princeton University]] in 1972.

His brother is [[Richard C Steiner|Richard C. Steiner]], Professor of Semitics at [[Yeshiva University]].

[[File:RecipeBook XML Example.png|thumb|Example of RecipeBook, a simple language based on XML for creating recipes. The markup can be converted to [[HTML]], [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] and [[Rich Text Format]] using a [[programming language|programming langage]] or [[Extensible Stylesheet Language|XSL]].]]

In computer text processing, a '''markup language''' is a system for [[annotation|annotating]] a [[document]] in a way that is [[Syntax (logic)|syntactically distinguishable]] from the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|markup language}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea and terminology evolved from the "marking up" of paper manuscripts, i.e., the revision instructions by editors, traditionally written with a [[blue pencil (editing)|blue pencil]] on authors' [[manuscript]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} In [[digital media]],  this "blue pencil instruction text" was replaced by [[HTML element|tags]], that is, instructions are expressed directly by tags or "instruction text encapsulated by tags." However the whole idea of a mark up language is to avoid the formatting work for the text, as the tags in the mark up language serve the purpose to format the appropriate text (like a header or the beginning of a paragraph etc.). Every tag used in a Markup language has a property to format the text we write.

Examples include typesetting instructions such as those found in [[troff]], [[TeX]] and [[LaTeX]], or structural markers such as [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] tags. Markup instructs the software that displays the text to carry out appropriate actions, but is omitted from the version of the text that users see.

Some markup languages, such as the widely used [[HTML]], have pre-defined [[presentation semantics]]—meaning that their specification prescribes how to present the [[structured data]]. Others, such as XML, do not have them and are general purpose.

[[Hypertext|HyperText]] Markup Language (HTML), one of the document formats of the [[World Wide Web]], is an instance of &lt;span lang="zh-hk" dir="ltr"&gt;Standard Generalized Markup Language&lt;/span&gt; or SGML, and follows many of the markup conventions used in the publishing industry in the communication of printed work between authors, editors, and printers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
&lt;!-- omitted example here as it is well covered below and is too specific --&gt;

==Etymology==

The term ''markup'' is derived from the traditional publishing practice of ''"marking up"'' a [[manuscript|man]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CHEN|first=XinYing|date=2011|title=Central nodes of the Chinese syntactic networks|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/972010-2369|journal=Chinese Science Bulletin (Chinese Version)|volume=56|issue=10|pages=735|doi=10.1360/972010-2369|issn=0023-074X}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[manuscript|uscript]], which involves adding handwritten annotations in the form of conventional symbolic [[Printing|printer]]'s instructions in the margins and text of a paper manuscript or printed. It is computer jargon used in coding [[Proofreading|proof]]. For centuries, this task was done primarily by skilled typographers known as "markup men"&lt;ref&gt;Allan Woods, ''Modern Newspaper Production'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1963), 85; Stewart Harral, ''Profitable Public Relations for Newspapers'' (Ann Arbor: J.W. Edwards, 1957), 76; and ''Chiarella v. United States'', {{ussc|445|222|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or "d markers"&lt;ref&gt;''From the Notebooks of H.J.H &amp; D.H.A on Composition'', Kingsport Press Inc., undated (1960s).&lt;/ref&gt; who marked up text to indicate what [[typeface]], style, and size should be applied to each part, and then passed the manuscript to others for [[typesetting]] by hand. Markup was also commonly applied by editors, proofreaders, publishers, and graphic designers, and indeed by document authors.

==Types of markup language==
There are three main general categories of electronic markup:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 1987|title=Markup systems and the future of scholarly text processing|journal=[[Communications of the ACM]]|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]|volume=30|issue=11|pages=933–947|doi=10.1145/32206.32209|url=http://xml.coverpages.org/coombs.html|first1=James H.|last1=Coombs|first2=Allen H. |last2=Renear|first3=Steven J. |last3=DeRose}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bray|first=Tim|authorlink=Tim Bray|url=http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/09/SemanticMarkup#p-1|title=On Semantics and Markup, Taxonomy of Markup|website=www.tbray.org/ongoing|date=9 April 2003|access-date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Presentational markup
:The kind of markup used by traditional word-processing systems: binary codes embedded within document text that produce the [[WYSIWYG]] ("'''what you see is what you get'''") effect. Such markup is usually hidden from human users, even authors or editors.

;Procedural markup 
:Markup is embedded in text and provides instructions for programs that are to process the text. Well-known examples include [[troff]], [[TeX]], and [[PostScript]]. It is expected that the processor will run through the text from beginning to end, following the instructions as encountered. Text with such markup is often edited with the markup visible and directly manipulated by the author. Popular procedural-markup systems usually include programming constructs, so macros or subroutines can be defined and invoked by name.

;Descriptive markup
:Markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to provide specific instructions as to how they should be processed. Well-known examples include [[LaTeX]], [[HTML]], and [[XML]]. The objective is to decouple the inherent structure of the document from any particular treatment or rendition of it. Such markup is often described as "semantic". An example of descriptive markup would be HTML's &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;cite&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, which is used to label a citation. Descriptive markup—sometimes called ''logical markup'' or ''conceptual markup''—encourages authors to write in a way that describes the material conceptually, rather than visually.&lt;ref&gt;
Michael Downes.
[http://www.ams.org/notices/200211/comm-downes.pdf "TEX and LATEX 2e"]
&lt;/ref&gt;

There is considerable blurring of the lines between the types of markup. In modern word-processing systems, presentational markup is often saved in descriptive-markup-oriented systems such as [[XML]], and then processed procedurally by implementations. The programming  in &lt;span lang="zh" dir="ltr"&gt;procedural&lt;/span&gt;-markup systems such as [[TeX]] may be used to create higher-level markup systems that are more descriptive, such as [[LaTeX]].

In recent years, a number of small and largely unstandardized markup languages have been developed to allow authors to create formatted text via web browsers, for use in [[wiki]]s and web forums. These are sometimes called [[lightweight markup language]]s. [[Markdown]] or the markup language used by [[Wikipedia]] are examples of such [[wiki markup]].

==History of markup languages==
===GenCode===
The first well-known public presentation of markup languages in computer text processing was made by [[William W. Tunnicliffe]] at a conference in 1967, although he preferred to call it ''generic coding.'' It can be seen as a response to the emergence of programs such as [[RUNOFF]] that each used their own control notations, often specific to the target typesetting device. In the 1970s, Tunnicliffe led the development of a standard called GenCode for the publishing industry and later was the first chair of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] committee that created [[SGML]], the first standard descriptive markup language. Book designer Stanley Rice published speculation along similar lines in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Stanley. “Editorial Text Structures (with some relations to information structures and format controls in computerized composition).” American National Standards Institute, March 17, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Reid (computer scientist)|Brian Reid]], in his 1980 dissertation at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], developed the theory and a working implementation of descriptive markup in actual use.

However, [[IBM]] researcher [[Charles Goldfarb]] is more commonly seen today as the "father" of markup languages. Goldfarb hit upon the basic idea while working on a primitive document management system intended for law firms in 1969, and helped invent [[IBM Generalized Markup Language|IBM GML]] later that same year. GML was first publicly disclosed in 1973.

In 1975, Goldfarb moved from [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] to [[Silicon Valley]] and became a product planner at the [[IBM Almaden Research Center]]. There, he convinced IBM's executives to deploy GML commercially in 1978 as part of IBM's Document Composition Facility product, and it was widely used in business within a few years.

SGML, which was based on both GML and GenCode, was developed by Goldfarb in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/blog/archives/2009/08/beyond_html_an.html|title=2009 interview with SGML creator Charles F. Goldfarb|publisher=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]|accessdate=2010-07-18}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldfarb eventually became chair of the SGML committee. SGML was first released by ISO as the ISO 8879 standard in October 1986.

===troff and nroff===
Some early examples of computer markup languages available outside the publishing industry can be found in typesetting tools on [[Unix]] systems such as [[troff]] and [[nroff]]. In these systems, formatting commands were inserted into the document text so that typesetting software could format the text according to the editor's specifications. It was a [[trial and error]] iterative process to get a document printed correctly.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Gilly. [http://web.deu.edu.tr/doc/oreily/unix/unixnut/ch12_01.htm ''Unix in a nutshell: Chapter 12. Nroff and Troff'']. O'Reilly Books, 1992. {{ISBN|1-56592-001-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Availability of [[WYSIWYG]] ("what you see is what you get") publishing software supplanted much use of these languages among casual users, though serious publishing work still uses markup to specify the non-visual structure of texts, and WYSIWYG editors now usually save documents in a markup-language-based format.

===TeX===
Another major publishing standard is [[TeX]], created and refined by [[Donald Knuth]] in the 1970s and '80s. [[TeX]] concentrated on detailed layout of text and font descriptions to typeset mathematical books. This required Knuth to spend considerable time investigating the art of [[typesetting]]. TeX is mainly used in [[academia]], where it is a [[De facto standard|''de facto'' standard]] in many scientific disciplines. A TeX macro package known as [[LaTeX]] provides a descriptive markup system on top of TeX, and is widely used.

===Scribe, GML and SGML===
{{main article|Scribe (markup language)|IBM Generalized Markup Language|Standard Generalized Markup Language}}
The first language to make a clean distinction between structure and presentation was [[Scribe (markup language)|Scribe]], developed by [[Brian Reid (computer scientist)|Brian Reid]] and described in his doctoral thesis in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Brian. "Scribe: A Document Specification Language and its Compiler." Ph.D. thesis, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh PA. Also available as Technical Report CMU-CS-81-100.&lt;/ref&gt; Scribe was revolutionary in a number of ways, not least that it introduced the idea of styles separated from the marked up document, and of a [[grammar]] controlling the usage of descriptive elements. Scribe influenced the development of [[IBM Generalized Markup Language|Generalized Markup Language]] (later SGML) and is a direct ancestor to HTML and [[LaTeX]] {{Citation needed|reason=How can Scribe influence GML when GML was made public in 1973|date=December 2017}}.

In the early 1980s, the idea that markup should be focused on the structural aspects of a document and leave the visual presentation of that structure to the interpreter led to the creation of SGML. The language was developed by a committee chaired by Goldfarb. It incorporated ideas from many different sources, including Tunnicliffe's project, GenCode. [[Sharon Adler]], [[Anders Berglund]], and [[James A. Marke]] were also key members of the SGML committee.

SGML specified a syntax for including the markup in documents, as well as one for separately describing ''what'' tags were allowed, and ''where'' (the Document Type Definition ([[Document Type Definition|DTD]]) or [[XML schema|schema]]). This allowed authors to create and use any markup they wished, selecting tags that made the most sense to them and were named in their own natural languages. Thus, SGML is properly a [[meta-language]], and many particular markup languages are derived from it. From the late '80s on, most substantial new markup languages have been based on SGML system, including for example [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] and [[DocBook]]. SGML was promulgated as an International Standard by [[International Organization for Standardization]], ISO 8879, in 1986.

SGML found wide acceptance and use in fields with very large-scale documentation requirements. However, many found it cumbersome and difficult to learn—a side effect of its design attempting to do too much and be too flexible. For example, SGML made end tags (or start-tags, or even both) optional in certain contexts, because its developers thought markup would be done manually by overworked support staff who would appreciate saving keystrokes{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.

====HTML====
{{main article|HTML}}
In 1989, computer scientist [[Tim Berners-Lee|Sir Tim Berners-Lee]] wrote a memo proposing an [[Internet]]-based [[hypertext]] system,&lt;ref&gt;Tim Berners-Lee, "Information Management: A Proposal." CERN (March 1989, May 1990). [http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html W3.org]&lt;/ref&gt; then specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in the last part of 1990. The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Berners-Lee in late 1991.&lt;ref name="tagshtml"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html |title=Tags used in HTML |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium |date=November 3, 1992 |accessdate=November 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1991SepOct/0003.html|title=First mention of HTML Tags on the www-talk mailing list|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=October 29, 1991|accessdate=April 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by [[SGMLguid]], an in-house [[SGML]]-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/index/elements|title=Index of elements in HTML 4|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=December 24, 1999|accessdate=April 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berners-Lee considered HTML an SGML application. The [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) formally defined it as such with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification: [http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/draft-ietf-iiir-html-01.txt "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet-Draft] by Berners-Lee and [[Dan Connolly (computer scientist)|Dan Connolly]], which included an SGML [[Document Type Definition]] to define the grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1991NovDec/0020.html|title=Re: SGML/HTML docs, X Browser (archived www-talk mailing list post)|author=Tim Berners-Lee|date=December 9, 1991|accessdate=June 16, 2007|quote=SGML is very general. HTML is a specific application of the SGML basic syntax applied to hypertext documents with simple structure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the HTML text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 ''Techniques for using SGML'', which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the [[TYPSET and RUNOFF|RUNOFF command]] developed in the early 1960s for the [[Compatible Time-Sharing System|CTSS]] (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from those used by typesetters to manually format documents. [[Steven DeRose]]&lt;ref&gt;DeRose, Steven J. "The SGML FAQ Book." Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1997. {{ISBN|0-7923-9943-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that HTML's use of descriptive markup (and influence of SGML in particular) was a major factor in the success of the Web, because of the flexibility and extensibility that it enabled. HTML became the main markup language for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser, and is quite likely the most used markup language in the world today.

===XML===
{{main article|XML}}

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a meta markup language that is now widely used. XML was developed by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]], in a committee created and chaired by [[Jon Bosak]]. The main purpose of XML was to simplify SGML by focusing on a particular problem—documents on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/ |title=Extensible Markup Language (XML) |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; XML remains a meta-language like SGML, allowing users to create any tags needed (hence "extensible") and then describing those tags and their permitted uses.

XML adoption was helped because every XML document can be written in such a way that it is also an SGML document, and existing SGML users and software could switch to XML fairly easily. However, XML eliminated many of the more complex and human-oriented features of SGML to simplify implementation environments such as documents and publications. However, it appeared to strike a happy medium between simplicity and flexibility, and was rapidly adopted for many other uses. XML is now widely used for communicating [[database transaction|data]] between applications.

====XHTML====
{{main article|XHTML}}
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=February 2017}}
Since January 2000, all [[W3C Recommendation]]s for HTML have been based on XML rather than SGML, using the abbreviation [[XHTML]] (E'''x'''tensible '''H'''yper'''T'''ext '''M'''arkup '''L'''anguage). The language specification requires that XHTML Web documents must be ''well-formed'' XML documents. This allows for more rigorous and robust documents while using tags familiar from HTML.

One of the most noticeable differences between HTML and XHTML is the rule that ''all tags must be closed'': empty HTML tags such as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; must either be ''closed'' with a regular end-tag, or replaced by a special form: {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;}} (the space before the '&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;' on the end tag is optional, but frequently used because it enables some pre-XML Web browsers, and SGML parsers, to accept the tag). Another is that all [[HTML#Attributes|attribute]] values in tags must be quoted. Finally, all tag and attribute names within the XHTML namespace must be lowercase to be valid. HTML, on the other hand, was case-insensitive.

====Other XML-based applications====
Many XML-based applications now exist, including the [[Resource Description Framework]] as [[RDF/XML]], [[XForms]], [[DocBook]], [[Simple Object Access Protocol|SOAP]], and the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL). For a partial list of these, see [[List of XML markup languages]].

==Features of markup languages==
A common feature of many markup languages is that they intermix the text of a document with markup instructions in the same data stream or file. This is not necessary; it is possible to isolate markup from text content, using pointers, offsets, IDs, or other methods to co-ordinate the two. Such "standoff markup" is typical for the internal representations that programs use to work with marked-up documents. However, embedded or "inline" markup is much more common elsewhere. Here, for example, is a small section of text marked up in HTML:

&lt;source lang="html4strict"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Anatidae&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The family &lt;i&gt;Anatidae&lt;/i&gt; includes ducks, geese, and swans,
but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the closely related screamers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The codes enclosed in angle-brackets &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;like this&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; are markup instructions (known as tags), while the text between these instructions is the actual text of the document. The codes &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt; are examples of ''semantic'' markup, in that they describe the intended purpose or meaning of the text they include. Specifically, &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; means "this is a first-level heading", &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; means "this is a paragraph", and &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt; means "this is an emphasized word or phrase". A program interpreting such structural markup may apply its own rules or styles for presenting the various pieces of text, using different typefaces, boldness, font size, indentation, colour, or other styles, as desired.
A tag such as "h1" (header level 1) might be presented in a large bold sans-serif typeface, for example, or in a monospaced (typewriter-style) document it might be underscored &amp;ndash; or it might not change the presentation at all.

In contrast, the &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; tag in HTML is an example of ''presentational'' markup; it is generally used to specify a particular characteristic of the text (in this case, the use of an italic typeface) without specifying the reason for that appearance.

The [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) has published extensive guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/ |title=TEI Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange |publisher=Tei-c.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; for how to encode texts of interest in the humanities and social sciences, developed through years of international cooperative work. These guidelines are used by projects encoding historical documents, the works of particular scholars, periods, or genres, and so on.

==Alternative usages==
While the idea of markup language originated with text documents, there is increasing use of markup languages in the presentation of other types of information, including [[playlist]]s, [[vector graphics]], [[web service]]s, [[web syndication|content syndication]], and [[user interface]]s. Most of these are XML applications, because XML is a well-defined and extensible language.

The use of XML has also led to the possibility of combining multiple markup languages into a single profile, like [[XHTMLplusSMIL|XHTML+SMIL]] and [[XHTMLplusMathMLplusSVG|XHTML+MathML+SVG]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-XHTMLplusMathMLplusSVG-20020809/ An XHTML + MathML + SVG Profile]". W3C, August 9, 2002. Retrieved on 17 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because markup languages, and more generally data description languages (not necessarily textual markup), are not programming languages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/prog.html|title=Programs vs. markup|last=Korpela|first=Jukka|date=2005-11-16|work=IT and communication|publisher=[[Tampere University of Technology]]|accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (they are data without instructions), they are more easily manipulated than programming languages—for example, web pages are presented as HTML documents, not C code, and thus can be embedded within other web pages, displayed when only partially received, and so forth. This leads to the web design principle of the [[rule of least power]], which advocates using the ''least'' (computationally) powerful language that satisfies a task to facilitate such manipulation and reuse.

'''Dame Mary Lucy Cartwright''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|DBE|FRS|FRSE}} (17 December 1900 – 3 April 1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Obituary: Mary Cartwright|journal=[[The Times]]|year=1998|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Obits/Cartwright.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British mathematician.

With [[J. E. Littlewood]] she was one of the first [[mathematicians]] to study what would later become known as [[chaos theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Freeman Dyson|Freeman J. Dyson]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=CQeKFG01s-oC&amp;pg=PA169 ''Mary Lucy Cartwright (1900–1998): Chaos theory''], pp. 169–177, in ''Out of the Shadows: Contributions of Twentieth-Century Women to Physics'', edited by [[Nina Byers]] and Gary Williams, 498 p. (Cambridge University Press, 2006); {{isbn|0-521-82197-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Cartwright was born in [[Aynho]], Northamptonshire, where her father, William Digby Cartwright, was [[vicar]]. Through her grandmother Jane Holbech she was descended from the poet [[John Donne]] and [[William Mompesson]], the Vicar of Eyam.&lt;ref name="mathgene"&gt;{{MathGenealogy |id=18533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mactutor"&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Cartwright}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She had four siblings, two older and two younger: John (born 1896), Nigel (born 1898), Jane (born 1905), and William (born 1907).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cartwright biography|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Cartwright.html|website=www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk|publisher=University of St. Andrews School of Mathematics and Statistics|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early education was at Leamington High School (1912–1915) then Gravely Manor School in [[Boscombe]] (1915–1916) before completion in [[Godolphin School]] in Salisbury (1916–1919).&lt;ref name="royalsoced1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|publisher=Royalsoced.org.uk|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She studied mathematics at [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]], graduating in 1923 with a first class degree. She was the first woman to attain the final degree lectures and to obtain a first. She then taught at [[Alice Ottley School]] in [[Worcester]] and [[Wycombe Abbey School]] in Buckinghamshire before returning to Oxford in 1928 to read for her [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil]].&lt;ref name="mactutor" /&gt;

She was supervised by [[G. H. Hardy]] in her doctoral studies. During the academic year 1928–9 Hardy was at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], so it was [[E. C. Titchmarsh]] who took over the duties as a supervisor. Her thesis "The Zeros of Integral Functions of Special Types" was examined by [[J. E. Littlewood]] whom she met for the first time as an external examiner in her oral examination for this 1930 D.Phil. She would later establish an enduring collaboration with Littlewood.&lt;ref name="mactutor" /&gt;

In 1930, Cartwright was awarded a Yarrow Research Fellowship and she went to [[Girton College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], to continue working on the topic of her doctoral thesis. Attending Littlewood's lectures, she solved one of the open problems which he posed. Her mathematical theorem, now known as Cartwright's theorem, gives an estimate for the maximum modulus of an [[analytic function]] that takes the same value no more than ''p'' times in the [[unit disc]]. To prove the theorem she used a new approach, applying a technique introduced by [[Lars Ahlfors]] for [[conformal geometry|conformal mappings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prezi.com/2pdjgbqmvfu-/mary-lucy-carwright/|title=Mary Lucy Cartwright|first=Jack|last=DeFuria|publisher=Prezi|date=22 October 2014|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1936, Cartwright became director of studies in mathematics at Girton College, and in 1938 she began work on a new project which had a major impact on the direction of her research. The Radio Research Board of the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] produced a memorandum regarding [[Van der Pol oscillator|certain differential equations]] which came out of modelling radio and radar work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=A Point of View: Mary, queen of maths|date=8 March 2013|journal=BBC News Magazine|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21713163}}&lt;/ref&gt; They asked the [[London Mathematical Society]] if they could help find a mathematician who could work on these problems and Cartwright became interested in this memorandum. The dynamics lying behind the problems were unfamiliar to Cartwright so she approached Littlewood for help with this aspect. They began to collaborate studying the equations. Littlewood wrote:{{quote|For something to do we went on and on at the thing with no earthly prospect of "results"; suddenly the whole vista of the dramatic fine structure of solutions stared us in the face.}}

The fine structure which Littlewood describes here is today seen to be a typical instance of the [[butterfly effect]]. The collaboration led to important results, and these have greatly influenced the direction that the modern theory of dynamical systems has taken.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cwp.library.ucla.edu/articles/ebcart11.html|title=Mistress of Girton whose mathematical work formed the basis of chaos theory|work=Obituaries Electronic Telegraph|date=11 April 1998|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hayman"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/46/19|author=[[Walter Hayman]]|title=Dame Mary (Lucy) Cartwright, D.B.E. 17 December 1900 – 3 April 1998|journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society|volume=46|date=1 November 2000|accessdate=8 March 2017|doi=10.1098/rsbm.1999.0070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, she simplified [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]]'s [[Proof that π is irrational#Cartwright.27s proof|elementary proof of the irrationality of {{pi}}]]. Her version of the proof was published in an appendix to Sir [[Harold Jeffreys]]' book ''Scientific Inference''. In 1947, she was elected to be a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and,&lt;ref name="frs"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hayman|first1=Walter K.|doi=10.1098/rsbm.1999.0070|title=Dame Mary (Lucy) Cartwright, D.B.E. 17 December 1900 – 3 April 1998: Elected F.R.S. 1947|journal=[[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]]|volume=46|page=19|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; although she was not the first woman to be elected to that Society, she was the first female mathematician.&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hayman" /&gt;

Cartwright was appointed Mistress of Girton in 1948 then, in addition, a Reader in the Theory of Functions in Cambridge in 1959, holding this appointment until 1968.&lt;ref name="mactutor" /&gt;  From 1957 to 1960 she was president of the Cambridge Association of University Women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/69671|title=Cartwright, Dame Mary Lucy (1900–1998), mathematician {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/69671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring from Girton, she was a visiting professor at [[Brown University]]  from 1968-1969 and at [[Claremont Graduate University|Claremont Graduate School]] from 1969-1970.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1195">The '''Mathematische Arbeitstagung''' taking place annually in [[Bonn]] since 1957, and founded by [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]], was an international meeting of mathematicians intended to act in clearing-house fashion, by disseminating current research ideas; and, at the same time, to bring mathematics in [[West Germany]] back into its place in European trends. It proved highly successful in attracting the cream of younger mathematicians, partly because its structure was not that of the conventional international conference. The programme of talks was decided 'in real time' only, rather than in advance.

For example, in 1962 the meeting was dominated by talks on [[K-theory]], at that time the breaking news. The early participants included [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], [[Michael Atiyah]] and [[Frank Adams]].

The institutional structure was reinforced from 1969 by the ''Sonderforschungsbereich Theoretische Mathematik'' programme, and from 1980 by the founding of the [[Max Planck Institute for Mathematics]] in Bonn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1284">In [[statistics]], the '''midhinge''' is the average of the first and third [[quartile]]s and is thus a measure of [[location parameter|location]].
Equivalently, it is the 25% [[trimmed estimator|trimmed]] [[mid-range]] or 25% [[midsummary]]; it is an [[L-estimator]].

The midhinge is complemented by the '''H-spread''', or '''[[interquartile range]]''', which is the difference of the third and first [[quartile]]s and which is a measure of [[statistical dispersion]], in sense that if one knows the midhinge and the interquartile range, one can find the first and third quartiles.

The use of the term "hinge" for the lower or upper quartiles derives from [[John Tukey]]'s work on [[exploratory data analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;Tukey, J. W. (1977) ''Exploratory Data Analysis'', Addison-Wesley. {{ISBN|0-201-07616-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "midhinge" is a fairly modern term dating from around that time. The midhinge is slightly simpler to calculate than the [[trimean]], which originated in the same context and equals the average of the [[median]] and the midhinge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31645">{{About|the mathematical concept|the computer science data structure|Multiset (abstract data type)}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''multiset''' (aka '''bag''' or '''mset''') is a modification of the concept of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that, unlike a set, allows for multiple instances for each of its [[Element (mathematics)|element]]s. The positive integer number of instances, given for each element is called the '''multiplicity''' of this element in the multiset. As a consequence, an infinite number of multisets exist, which contain only elements {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, but vary by the multiplicity of their elements:
* The set {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''b''}}}} contains only elements {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, each having multiplicity 1, when {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''b''}}}} is seen as a multiset.
* In multiset {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''a'', ''b''}}}}, the element {{math|''a''}} has multiplicity 2, and {{math|''b''}} has multiplicity 1.
* In multiset {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''a'', ''a'', ''b'', ''b'', ''b''}}}}, {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} both have multiplicity 3.

These objects are all different, when viewed as  multisets, although they are the same [[set theory|set]], since they all consist of the same elements. As with sets, and in contrast to [[tuple]]s, order does not matter in discriminating multisets,  so {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''a'', ''b''}}}} and {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''b'', ''a''}}}} denote the same multiset.  To distinguish between sets and multisets, a notation that incorporates square brackets is sometimes used: the multiset {{math|{{mset|a, a, b}}}} can be denoted as {{math|[a, a, b]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Discrete mathematics|first=James L.|last=Hein|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|year=2003|isbn=0-7637-2210-3|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cardinality]] of a multiset is constructed by summing up the multiplicities of all its elements. For example, in the multiset {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''a'', ''b'', ''b'', ''b'', ''c''}}}} the multiplicities of the members {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}} are respectively 2, 3, and 1, and therefore the cardinality of this multiset is 6.

[[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn]] coined the word ''multiset'' in the 1970s, according to [[Donald Knuth]].&lt;ref name="Knuth1998"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Knuth

  | date=1998 | edition = 3rd
  | isbn =0-201-89684-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|694}}
However, the use of the concept for multisets predates the coinage of word ''multiset'' by many centuries. Knuth himself attributes the first study of multisets to the Indian mathematician [[Bhāskara II|Bhāskarāchārya]], who described permutations of multisets around 1150. Knuth also lists other names that were proposed or used for this concept, including ''list'', ''bunch'', ''bag'', ''heap'', ''sample'', ''weighted set'', ''collection'', and ''suite''.&lt;ref name="Knuth1998"/&gt;{{rp|694}}

==History==
Wayne Blizard traced multisets back to the very origin of numbers, arguing that “in ancient times, the number ''n'' was often represented by a collection of ''n'' strokes, tally marks, or units.”&lt;ref name="Blizard1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blizard|first=Wayne D|year=1989|title=Multiset theory|journal=Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic|volume=30|issue=1|pages=36–66|url=http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ndjfl/1093634995|doi=10.1305/ndjfl/1093634995}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and similar collections of objects are multisets, because strokes, tally marks, or units are considered indistinguishable. This shows that people implicitly used multisets even before mathematics emerged.

Practical needs for this structure have caused multisets to be rediscovered several times, appearing in literature under different names.&lt;ref name="Blizard1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blizard|first=Wayne D.|year=1991|title=The Development of Multiset Theory|journal=Modern Logic|volume=1|issue=4|pages=319–352|url=http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.rml/1204834739}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|323}} For instance, they were important in early AI languages, such as QA4, where they were referred to as ''bags,'' a term attributed to Peter Deutsch.&lt;ref name="Rulifson1972"&gt;{{cite techreport|last1=Rulifson|first1=J. F.|last2=Derkson|first2=J. A.|last3=Waldinger|first3=R. J.|year=|date=November 1972|institution=SRI International|title=QA4: A Procedural Calculus for Intuitive Reasoning|number=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; A multiset has been also called an aggregate, heap, bunch, sample, weighted set, occurrence set, and fireset (finitely repeated element set).&lt;ref name="Blizard1991" /&gt;{{rp|320}}&lt;ref name="Singh2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=D.|last2=Ibrahim|first2=A. M.|last3=Yohanna|first3=T.|last4=Singh|first4=J. N.|year=2007|title=An overview of the applications of multisets|journal=Novi Sad Journal of Mathematics|volume=37|issue=2|pages=73–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although multisets were used implicitly from ancient times, their explicit exploration happened much later. The first known study of multisets is attributed to the Indian mathematician [[Bhāskara II|Bhāskarāchārya]] circa 1150, who described permutations of multisets.&lt;ref name="Knuth1998"/&gt;{{rp|694}} The work of [[Marius Nizolius]] (1498–1576) contains another early reference to the concept of multisets.&lt;ref name="Angelelli1965"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Angelelli|first=I.|year=1965|title=Leibniz's misunderstanding of Nizolius' notion of 'multitudo'|journal=Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic|issue=6|pages=319–322}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athanasius Kircher]] found the number of multiset permutations when one element can be repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kircher|first=Athanasius|authorlink=Athanasius Kircher|year=1650|title=Musurgia Universalis|publisher=Corbelletti|location=Rome}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Prestet]] published a general rule for multiset permutations in 1675.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prestet|first=Jean|year=1675|title=Elemens des Mathematiques|publisher=André Pralard|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wallis]] explained this rule in more detail in 1685.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallis|first=John|authorlink=John Wallis|year=1685|title=A treatise of algebra|publisher=John Playford|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multisets appeared explicitly in the work of [[Richard Dedekind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dedekind|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Dedekind|year=1888|title=Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?|publisher=Vieweg|location=Braunschweig}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|114}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Syropoulos|first=Apostolos|year=2001|chapter=Mathematics of Multisets|editor-first=C. S.|editor-last=Calude|title=Multiset processing: Mathematical, computer science, and molecular computing points of view|publisher=Springer-Verlag|pages=347&amp;ndash;358|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other mathematicians formalized multisets and began to study them as precise mathematical structures in the 20th century.  For example, Whitney (1933) described ''generalized sets'' ("sets" whose [[characteristic function]]s may take any integer  value -  positive, negative or zero).&lt;ref name="Blizard1991" /&gt;{{rp|326}}&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whitney |first1=H. |title=Characteristic  Functions  and  the  Algebra  of  Logic |journal=Annals of Mathematics |date=1933 |volume=34 |pages=405-414}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|405}}  Monro (1987) investigated the [[category theory|category]] '''Mul''' of multisets and their morphisms, defining a ''multiset'' as a set with an equivalence relation between elements "of the same ''sort''", and a ''morphism'' between multisets as a function which respects ''sorts''.  He also introduced a ''multinumber'': a function ''f(x)'' from a multiset to the natural numbers, giving the ''multiplicity'' of element ''x'' in the multiset.  Monro argued that the concepts of multiset and multinumber are often mixed indiscriminately, though both are useful.&lt;ref name="Blizard1991" /&gt;{{rp|327-328}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monro |first1=G. P. |title=The Concept of Multiset |journal=Zeitschrift für Mathematische Logik und Grundlagen der Mathematik |date=1987 |volume=33 |pages=171-178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One of the simplest and most natural examples is the multiset of [[prime number|prime]] factors of a number {{math|''n''}}. Here the underlying set of elements is the set of prime [[divisor]]s of {{math|''n''}}. For example, the number [[120 (number)|120]] has the [[prime factorization]]
:&lt;math&gt;120 = 2^3 3^1 5^1&lt;/math&gt;
which gives the multiset {{math|{{mset|2, 2, 2, 3, 5}}}}.

A related example is the multiset of solutions of an algebraic equation. A [[quadratic equation]], for example, has two solutions. However, in some cases they are both the same number.  Thus the multiset of solutions of the equation could be {{math|{{mset|3, 5}}}}, or it could be {{math|{{mset|4, 4}}}}.  In the latter case it has a solution of multiplicity 2. More generally, the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] asserts that the [[complex number|complex]] solutions of a [[polynomial equation]] of degree {{mvar|d}} always form a multiset of cardinality {{mvar|d}}.

A special case of the above are the [[eigenvalue]]s of a matrix, if these are defined as the multiset of roots of its [[characteristic polynomial]]. However a choice is made here: the (usual) definition of eigenvalues does not refer to the characteristic polynomial, and this give rise to another notion of multiplicity, and therefore to another multiset. The [[geometric multiplicity]] of an eigenvalue {{math|''λ''}} of a matrix {{math|''A''}} is the [[dimension (mathematics)|dimension]] of the kernel of {{math|''A'' – ''λI''}}; the geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue is not larger and often smaller than its ''algebraic multiplicity'', which is the multiplicity as a root of the characteristic polynomial. The geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue is its multiplicity as a root of the [[minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]] of {{math|''A''}}. Therefore, the multiset of eigenvalues with geometric multiplicities is the multiset of roots of the minimal polynomial.

==Definition==
A '''multiset''' may be formally defined as a 2-[[tuple]] {{math|(''A'', ''m'')}} where {{math|''A''}} is the ''underlying set'' of the multiset, formed from its distinct elements, and &lt;math&gt;m\colon A \to \mathbb{N}_{\geq 1}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from {{math|''A''}} to the set of the [[positive number|positive]] [[integer]]s, giving the ''multiplicity'', that is, the number of occurrences, of the element {{math|''a''}} in the multiset as the number {{math|''m''(''a'')}}.

Representing the function {{math|''m''}} by its [[graph (function)|graph]], that is the set of [[ordered pair]]s &lt;math&gt;\left\{\left(a, m\left(a\right)\right) : a \in A\right\},&lt;/math&gt; allows for writing the multiset {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''a'', ''b''}}}} as {{math|({''a'', ''b''}, {(''a'', 2), (''b'', 1)})}}, and the multiset {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''b''}}}} as {{math|({''a'', ''b''}, {(''a'', 1), (''b'', 1)})}}. This notation is however not commonly used and more compact notations are employed.

If &lt;math&gt;A=\{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[finite set]], the multiset {{math|(''A'', ''m'')}} is often represented as 
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{a_1^{m(a_1)}, \ldots,a_n^{m(a_n)}  \right\},\quad&lt;/math&gt; sometimes simplified to &lt;math&gt;\quad a_1^{m(a_1)} \cdots a_n^{m(a_n)},&lt;/math&gt;

where upper indices equal to 1 are omitted. For example, the multiset {{mset|''a'', ''a'', ''b''}} may be written &lt;math&gt;\{a^2,b\}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;a^2b.&lt;/math&gt; If the elements of the multiset are numbers, a confusion is possible with ordinary [[arithmetic operations]], those  normally can be excluded from the context. On the other hand, the latter notation is coherent with the fact that the [[prime factorization]] of a positive integer is a uniquely defined multiset, as asserted by the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]. Also, a [[monomial]] is a multiset of [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]]s.{{explain|date=March 2018}}

A multiset corresponds to an ordinary set if the multiplicity of every element is one (as opposed to some larger natural number). An [[indexed family]], {{math|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;i∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;}},  where {{math|''i''}} varies over some index-set ''I'', may define a multiset, sometimes written {{math|{{mset|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}. In this view the underlying set of the multiset is given by the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of the family, and the multiplicity of any element {{math|''x''}} is the number of index values {{math|''i''}} such that &lt;math&gt;a_i = x&lt;/math&gt;. In this article the multiplicities are considered to be finite, i.e. no element occurs infinitely many times in the family: even in an infinite multiset, the multiplicities are finite numbers.

It is possible to extend the definition of a multiset by allowing multiplicities of individual elements to be infinite cardinals instead of natural numbers, but not all properties carry over to this generalization.

==Basic properties and operations==
Elements of a multiset are generally taken in a fixed set {{mvar|U}}, sometimes called a ''universe'', which is typically the set of [[natural number]]s. An element of {{mvar|U}} that does not belong to a given multiset is said to have a multiplicity 0 in this multiset. This extends the multiplicity function of the multiset to a function from {{mvar|U}} to the set &lt;math&gt;\N&lt;/math&gt; of [[nonnegative integer]]s. This defines a one to one correspondence between these functions and the multisets that have their elements in {{mvar|U}}.

This extended multiplicity function is commonly called simply the '''multiplicity function''', and suffices for defining multisets, when the universe containing the elements has been fixed. This multiplicity function is a generalization of the [[indicator function]] of a subset, and shares some properties with it.

The '''support''' of a multiset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in a universe {{mvar|U}} is the underlying set of the multiset. Using the multiplicity function &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, it is characterized as 
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Supp}(A) := \left\{x \in U \mid m_{A}(x) &gt; 0 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

A multiset is ''finite'' if its support is finite, or, equivalently, if its cardinality
:&lt;math&gt;|A| = \sum_{x\in \operatorname{Supp}(A)}m_A(x)= \sum_{x\in U}m_A(x)&lt;/math&gt;
is finite. The ''empty multiset'' is the unique multiset with an empty support (underlying set), and thus a cardinality 0.

The usual operations of sets may be extended to multisets by using the multiplicity function, in a similar way as using the indicator function for subsets. In the following, {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are multisets in a given universe {{mvar|U}}, with multiplicity functions &lt;math&gt;m_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_B.&lt;/math&gt;

*'''Inclusion:''' {{mvar|A}} is included in {{mvar|B}}, denoted {{math|''A'' ⊆ ''B''}}, if
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in U, m_A(x) \le  m_B(x).&lt;/math&gt;
*'''Intersection:''' the ''intersection'' (called, in some contexts, the ''infimum'' or ''greatest common divisor'') of {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} is the multiset {{mvar|C}} with multiplicity function
::&lt;math&gt;m_C(x) = \min(m_A(x),m_B(x))\quad\forall x\in U.&lt;/math&gt;
*'''Union:''' the ''union'' (called, in some contexts, the ''maximum'' or ''lowest common multiple'') of {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} is the multiset {{mvar|C}} with multiplicity function
::&lt;math&gt;m_C(x) = \max(m_A(x),m_B(x))\quad\forall x\in U.&lt;/math&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
*'''Sum:''' the sum of multisets may be viewed as a generalization of the [[disjoint union]] of sets, and is defined by 
::&lt;math&gt;m_C(x) = m_A(x) + m_B(x)\quad\forall x\in U.&lt;/math&gt;
:The sum defines a [[commutative monoid]] structure on the finite multisets in a given universe. This monoid is a [[free commutative monoid]], with the universe as a basis.

Two multisets are ''disjoint'' if their supports are [[disjoint sets]]. This is equivalent to saying that their intersection is the empty multiset or that their sum equals their union.

[[File:Combinations with repetition; 5 multichoose 3.svg|thumb|370px|[[Bijection]] between 3-subsets of a 7-set (left)&lt;br&gt;and 3-multisets with elements from a 5-set (right)&lt;br&gt;So this illustrates that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {7 \choose 3} = \left(\!\!{5 \choose 3}\!\!\right)&lt;/math&gt;.]]
{{See also|Stars and bars (combinatorics)}}
The number of multisets of cardinality {{math|''k''}}, with elements taken from a finite set of cardinality {{math|''n''}}, is called the '''multiset coefficient''' or '''multiset number'''. This number is written by some authors as &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\left(\!\!{n\choose k}\!\!\right)&lt;/math&gt;, a notation that is meant to resemble that of [[binomial coefficient]]s; it is used for instance in (Stanley, 1997), and could be pronounced "{{math|''n''}} multichoose {{math|''k''}}" to resemble "{{math|''n''}} choose {{math|''k''}}" for &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt;. Unlike for binomial coefficients, there is no "multiset theorem" in which multiset coefficients would occur, and they should not be confused with the unrelated [[multinomial coefficient]]s that occur in the [[multinomial theorem]].

The value of multiset coefficients can be given explicitly as
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n\choose k}\!\!\right) = {n+k-1 \choose k} = \frac{(n+k-1)!}{k!\,(n-1)!} = {n(n+1)(n+2)\cdots(n+k-1)\over k!},&lt;/math&gt;
where the second expression is as a binomial coefficient; many authors in fact avoid separate notation and just write binomial coefficients. So, the number of such multisets is the same as the number of subsets of cardinality {{math|''k''}} in a set of cardinality {{math|''n'' + ''k'' &amp;minus; 1}}. The analogy with binomial coefficients can be stressed by writing the numerator in the above expression as a [[rising factorial power]]
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n\choose k}\!\!\right) = {n^{\overline{k}}\over k!},&lt;/math&gt;
to match the expression of binomial coefficients using a falling factorial power:
:&lt;math&gt;{n\choose k} = {n^{\underline{k}}\over k!}.&lt;/math&gt;

There are for example 4 '''multisets''' of cardinality 3 with elements taken from the set {{math|{{mset|1, 2}}}} of cardinality 2 ({{math|''n''}} = 2, {{math|''k''}} = 3), namely {{math|{{mset|1, 1, 1}}}}, {{math|{{mset|1, 1, 2}}}}, {{math|{{mset|1, 2, 2}}}}, {{math|{{mset|2, 2, 2}}}}. There are also 4 '''subsets''' of cardinality 3 in the set {{math|{{mset|1, 2, 3, 4}}}} of cardinality 4 ({{math|''n'' + ''k'' &amp;minus; 1}}), namely {{math|{{mset|1, 2, 3}}}}, {{math|{{mset|1, 2, 4}}}}, {{math|{{mset|1, 3, 4}}}}, {{math|{{mset|2, 3, 4}}}}.

One simple way to prove the equality of multiset coefficients and binomial coefficients given above, involves representing multisets in the following way.  First, consider the notation for multisets that would represent {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''a'', ''a'', ''a'', ''a'', ''a'', ''b'', ''b'', ''c'', ''c'', ''c'', ''d'', ''d'', ''d'', ''d'', ''d'', ''d'', ''d''}}}} (6 {{math|''a''}}s, 2 {{math|''b''}}s, 3 {{math|''c''}}s, 7 {{math|''d''}}s) in this form:

:&lt;math&gt;{\bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet} \mid {\bullet \bullet} \mid {\bullet \bullet \bullet} \mid {\bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet} &lt;/math&gt;

This is a multiset of cardinality {{math|''k''}} = 18 made of elements of a set of cardinality {{math|''n''}} = 4.  The number of characters including both dots and vertical lines used in this notation is 18&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.  The number of vertical lines is 4 &amp;minus; 1.  The number of multisets of cardinality 18 is then the number of ways to arrange the 4&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 vertical lines among the 18 + 4 &amp;minus; 1 characters, and is thus the number of subsets of cardinality 4 &amp;minus; 1 in a set of cardinality 18&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.  Equivalently, it is the number of ways to arrange the 18 dots among the 18&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 characters, which is the number of subsets of cardinality 18 of a set of cardinality 18&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1. This is
:&lt;math&gt;{4+18-1 \choose 4-1}={4+18-1 \choose 18} = 1330,&lt;/math&gt;
thus is the value of the multiset coefficient and its equivalencies:
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{4\choose18}\!\!\right)={21\choose18}=\frac{21!}{18!\,3!}={21\choose3}=\left(\!\!{19\choose3}\!\!\right),&lt;/math&gt;
:
::&lt;math&gt;=\frac{{\color{red}{\mathfrak{
4\cdot5\cdot6\cdot7\cdot8\cdot9\cdot10\cdot11\cdot12\cdot13\cdot14\cdot15\cdot16\cdot17\cdot18}}}
\cdot
\mathbf{19\cdot20\cdot21}}{\mathbf{1\cdot2\cdot3}
\cdot
{\color{red}{\mathfrak{
4\cdot5\cdot6\cdot7\cdot8\cdot9\cdot10\cdot11\cdot12\cdot13\cdot14\cdot15\cdot16\cdot17\cdot18}}}},&lt;/math&gt;
:
::&lt;math&gt;=\frac{
1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5\cdots16\cdot17\cdot18\;\mathbf{\cdot\;19\cdot20\cdot21}}
{\,1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5\cdots
16\cdot17\cdot18\,\times\,\mathbf{1\cdot2\cdot3\quad}},&lt;/math&gt;
:
::&lt;math&gt;=\frac{19\cdot20\cdot21}{1\cdot2\cdot3}.&lt;/math&gt;

One may define a generalized binomial coefficient
:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose k}={n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-k+1) \over k!}&lt;/math&gt;
in which {{math|''n''}} is not required to be a nonnegative integer, but may be negative or a non-integer, or a non-real [[complex number]].  (If {{math|''k''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, then the value of this coefficient is 1 because it is the [[empty product]].)  Then the number of multisets of cardinality {{math|''k''}} in a set of cardinality {{math|''n''}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n\choose k}\!\!\right)=(-1)^k{-n \choose k}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Recurrence relation ===
A [[recurrence relation]] for multiset coefficients may be given as
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n\choose k}\!\!\right) = \left(\!\!{n\choose k - 1}\!\!\right) + \left(\!\!{n-1\choose k}\!\!\right) \quad \mbox{for } n,k&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n \choose 0}\!\!\right) = 1,\quad n\in\N, \quad\mbox{and}\quad \left(\!\!{0 \choose k}\!\!\right) = 0,\quad k&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

The above recurrence may be interpreted as follows.
Let {{math|[''n'']}}&amp;nbsp;:=&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\{1,\cdots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; be the source set. There is always exactly one (empty) multiset of size 0, and if {{math|''n''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 there are no larger multisets, which gives the initial conditions.

Now, consider the case in which {{math|''n'',''k''}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0. A multiset of cardinality {{math|''k''}} with elements from {{math|[''n'']}} might or might not contain any instance of the final element {{math|''n''}}. If it does appear, then by removing {{math|''n''}} once, one is left with a multiset of cardinality {{math|''k''}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 of elements from {{math|[''n'']}}, and every such multiset can arise, which gives a total of
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n\choose k - 1}\!\!\right)&lt;/math&gt; possibilities.

If {{math|''n''}} does not appear, then our original multiset is equal to a multiset of cardinality {{math|''k''}} with elements from {{math|[''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1]}}, of which there are
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n-1\choose k}\!\!\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n\choose k}\!\!\right) = \left(\!\!{n\choose k - 1}\!\!\right) + \left(\!\!{n-1\choose k}\!\!\right).&lt;/math&gt;

===Generating series===
The [[generating function]] of the multiset coefficients is very simple, being
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d=0}^\infty \left(\!\!{n\choose d}\!\!\right)t^d=\frac{1}{(1-t)^n}.&lt;/math&gt;
As multisets are in one to one correspondence with monomials, &lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n\choose d}\!\!\right)&lt;/math&gt; is also the number of [[monomial]]s of degree {{mvar|d}} in {{mvar|n}} indeterminates. Thus, above series is also the [[Hilbert series]] of the [[polynomial ring]] &lt;math&gt;k[x_1, \ldots, x_n].&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n\choose d}\!\!\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial in {{mvar|n}}, it is defined for any [[complex number|complex]] value of {{mvar|n}}.

=== Generalization and connection to the negative binomial series ===
The multiplicative formula allows the definition of multiset coefficients to be extended by replacing ''n'' by an arbitrary number ''α'' (negative, real, complex):
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{\alpha\choose k}\!\!\right) = \frac{\alpha^{\overline k}}{k!} = \frac{\alpha(\alpha+1)(\alpha+2)\cdots(\alpha+k-1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots 1}
  \quad\text{for } k\in\N \text{ and arbitrary } \alpha.
&lt;/math&gt;

With this definition one has a generalization of the negative binomial formula (with one of the variables set to 1), which justifies calling the &lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{\alpha\choose k}\!\!\right)&lt;/math&gt; negative binomial coefficients:

:&lt;math&gt; (1-X)^{-\alpha} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \left(\!\!{\alpha\choose k}\!\!\right) X^k.&lt;/math&gt;

This [[Taylor series]] formula is valid for all complex numbers ''α'' and ''X'' with {{abs|''X''}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;1. It can also be interpreted as an identity of [[formal power series]] in ''X'', where it actually can serve as definition of arbitrary powers of series with constant coefficient equal to&amp;nbsp;1; the point is that with this definition all identities hold that one expects for [[exponentiation]], notably

:&lt;math&gt;(1-X)^{-\alpha}(1-X)^{-\beta}=(1-X)^{-(\alpha+\beta)} \quad\text{and}\quad ((1-X)^{-\alpha})^{-\beta}=(1-X)^{-(-\alpha\beta)}&lt;/math&gt;,
and formulas such as these can be used to prove identities for the multiset coefficients.

If ''α'' is a nonpositive integer ''n'', then all terms with ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;−''n'' are zero, and the infinite series becomes a finite sum. However, for other values of ''α'', including positive integers and rational numbers, the series is infinite.

==Applications==
Multisets have various applications.&lt;ref name="Singh2007" /&gt; They are becoming fundamental in [[combinatorics]].&lt;ref name="Aigner1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aigner|first=M.|year=1979|title=Combinatorial Theory|publisher=Springer Verlag|location=New York/Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=I.|year=1987|title=Combinatorics of Finite Sets|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanley1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=Richard P.|authorlink=Richard P.

Multisets also play an important role in computer science.&lt;ref name="Knuth1998" /&gt;

There are also other applications. For instance, [[Richard Rado]] used multisets as a device to investigate the properties of families of sets. He wrote, "The notion of a set takes no account of multiple occurrence of any one of its members, and yet it is just this kind of information which is frequently of importance. We need only think of the set of roots of a polynomial f(x) or the spectrum of a linear operator."&lt;ref name="Blizard1991" /&gt;{{rp|328-329}}

==Generalizations==

Different generalizations of multisets have been introduced, studied and applied to solving problems.
* Real-valued multisets (in which multiplicity of an element can be any real number)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blizard|first=Wayne D.|year=1989|title=Real-valued Multisets and Fuzzy Sets|journal=Fuzzy Sets and Systems|volume=33|pages=77–97|doi=10.1016/0165-0114(89)90218-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blizard1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blizard|first=Wayne D.|year=1990|title=Negative Membership|journal=Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic|volume=31|issue=1|pages=346–368}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:This seems straightforward, as many definitions for fuzzy sets and multisets are very similar and can be taken over for real-valued multisets by just replacing the value range of the characteristic function ([0, 1] or ℕ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} respectively) by ℝ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = [0, ∞[. However, this approach cannot be easily extended for generalized fuzzy sets which use a [[poset]] or [[lattice (order)|lattice]] instead of a simple degree of membership. Several other approaches for fuzzy multisets have been developed that don't have this restriction.

'''''On Numbers and Games''''' is a [[mathematics]] book by [[John Horton Conway]] first published in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fraenkel, Aviezri S.|authorlink=Aviezri Fraenkel|title=Review: ''On numbers and games'', by J. H. Conway; and ''Surreal numbers'', by D. E. Knuth|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1978|volume=84|issue=6|pages=1328–1336|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1978-84-06/S0002-9904-1978-14564-9/S0002-9904-1978-14564-9.pdf|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1978-14564-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is  written by a pre-eminent mathematician, and is directed at other mathematicians. The material is, however, developed in a playful and unpretentious manner and many chapters are accessible to non-mathematicians.  [[Martin Gardner]] discussed the book at length, particularly Conway's construction of [[Surreal number]]s, in his [[List of Martin Gardner Mathematical Games columns|Mathematical Games column]] in ''Scientific American'' in September 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mathematical-games-1976-09/ Mathematical Games, September 1976] ''[[Scientific American]]'' Volume 235, Issue 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is roughly divided into two sections: the first half (or ''Zeroth Part''), on [[number]]s, the second half (or ''First Part''), on [[combinatorial game theory|games]]. In the first section, Conway provides an [[axiomatic]] construction of numbers and [[ordinal arithmetic]], namely, the [[integer]]s, [[Real number|real]]s, the [[countable infinity]], and entire towers of infinite [[ordinal number|ordinals]], using a notation that is essentially an almost trite (but critically important) variation of the [[Dedekind cut]]. As such, the construction is rooted in [[axiomatic set theory]], and is closely related to the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]]. The section also covers what Conway (adopting Knuth's nomenclature) termed the "[[surreal number]]s".

Conway then notes that, in this notation, the numbers in fact belong to a larger [[class (set theory)|class]], the class of all two-player games. The axioms for [[greater than]] and [[less than]] are seen to be a natural ordering on games, corresponding to which of the two players may win. The remainder of the book is devoted to exploring a number of different (non-traditional, mathematically inspired) two-player games, such as [[nim]], [[hackenbush]], and the [[map-coloring games]] [[col (game)|col]] and [[Snort (game)|snort]]. The development includes their scoring, a review of [[Sprague–Grundy theorem]], and the inter-relationships to numbers, including their relationship to [[infinitesimal]]s.

The book was first published by Academic Press Inc in 1976, {{isbn|0-12-186350-6}}, and re-released by AK Peters in 2000 ({{isbn|1-56881-127-6}}).

==Synopsis==
A game in the sense of Conway is a position in a contest between two players, '''Left''' and '''Right'''.  Each player has a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of games called ''options'' to choose from in turn.  Games are written {L|R} where L is the set of '''Left's''' options and R is the set of '''Right's''' options.&lt;ref&gt;Alternatively, we often list the elements of the sets of options to save on braces.  This causes no confusion as long as we can tell whether a singleton option is a game or a set of games.&lt;/ref&gt; At the start there are no games at all, so the [[empty set]] (i.e., the set with no members) is the only set of options we can provide to the players.  This defines the game {|}, which is called [[zero game|0]].  We consider a player who must play a turn but has no options to have lost the game.  Given this game 0 there are now two possible sets of options, the empty set and the set whose only element is zero.  The game {0|} is called 1, and the game {|0} is called -1.  The game {0|0} is called [[star (game theory)|* (star)]], and is the first game we find that is not a number.

All numbers are [[sign (mathematics)|positive, negative, or zero]], and we say that a game is positive if '''Left''' will win, negative if '''Right''' will win, or zero if the second player will win.  Games that are not numbers have a fourth possibility: they may be [[fuzzy game|fuzzy]], meaning that the first player will win.  * is a fuzzy game.&lt;ref&gt;Dierk Schleicher and Michael Stoll, [https://arxiv.org/abs/math.CO/0410026 ''An Introduction to Conway's Games and Numbers''], Moscow Math Journal 6 2 (2006), 359-388&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''parity bit''', or '''check bit''', is a [[bit]] added to a string of [[binary code]] to ensure that the total number of 1-bits in the string is [[even number|even]] or [[odd number|odd]]. Parity bits are used as the simplest form of [[Error detection and correction|error detecting code]].

There are two variants of parity bits: '''even parity bit''' and '''odd parity bit'''. 

In the case of even parity, for a given set of bits, the occurrences of bits whose value is 1 is counted. If that count is odd, the parity bit value is set to 1, making the total count of occurrences of 1s in the whole set (including the parity bit) an even number. If the count of 1s in a given set of bits is already even, the parity bit's value is 0. 

In the case of odd parity, the coding is reversed. For a given set of bits, if the count of bits with a value of 1 is even, the parity bit value is set to 1 making the total count of 1s in the whole set (including the parity bit) an odd number.  If the count of bits with a value of 1 is odd, the count is already odd so the parity bit's value is 0.

Even parity is a special case of a [[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC), where the 1-bit CRC is generated by the [[polynomial]] ''x''+1.

If a bit is present at a point otherwise dedicated to a parity bit, but is not used for parity, it may be referred to as a '''mark parity bit''' if the parity bit is always 1, or a '''space parity bit''' if the bit is always 0. In such cases where the value of the bit is constant, it may be called a '''stick parity bit''' even though its function has nothing to do with parity.&lt;ref&gt;What is the difference between using mark or space parity and parity-none [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13953095/what-is-the-difference-between-using-mark-space-parity-and-parity-none/44612613#44612613]&lt;/ref&gt; The function of such bits varies with the system design, but examples of functions for such bits include timing management, or identification of a packet as being of data or address significance.&lt;ref&gt;What is the purpose of the Stick Parity? [http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.faqs/ka13893.html]&lt;/ref&gt; If its actual bit value is irrelevant to its function, the bit amounts to a [[don't-care term]].&lt;ref&gt;Serial Communications - Sat-Digest[http://www.sat-digest.com/SatXpress/SmartCard/SerialPort.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parity bits are generally applied to the smallest units of a communication protocol, typically 8-bit [[octet (computing)|octets]] (bytes), although they can also be applied separately to an entire message string of bits.

==Parity==
In mathematics, [[parity (mathematics)|parity]] refers to the evenness or oddness of an integer, which for a [[binary numeral system|binary number]] is determined only by the [[least significant bit]]. In telecommunications and computing, parity refers to the evenness or oddness of the number of bits with value one within a given set of bits, and is thus determined by the value of all the bits. It can be calculated via a [[XOR]] sum of the bits, yielding 0 for even parity and 1 for odd parity. This property of being dependent upon all the bits and changing value if any one bit changes allows for its use in [[Error detection and correction#Parity bits|error detection]] schemes.

==Error detection==
If an odd number of bits (including the parity bit) are [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmitted]] incorrectly, the parity bit will be incorrect, thus indicating that a '''parity error''' occurred in the transmission. The parity bit is only suitable for detecting errors; it cannot [[error detection and correction|correct]] any errors, as there is no way to determine which particular bit is corrupted. The data must be discarded entirely, and [[automatic repeat-request|re-transmitted from scratch]]. On a noisy transmission medium, successful transmission can therefore take a long time, or even never occur. However, parity has the advantage that it uses only a single bit and requires only a number of [[XOR gate]]s to generate. See [[Hamming code]] for an example of an error-correcting code.

Parity bit checking is used occasionally for transmitting [[ASCII]] characters, which have 7 bits, leaving the 8th bit as a parity bit.

For example, the parity bit can be computed as follows. Assume [[Alice and Bob]] are communicating and Alice wants to send Bob the simple 4-bit message 1001.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Type of bit parity !! Successful transmission scenario
|-
| Even parity || 
Alice wants to transmit:          1001

Alice computes parity bit value:  1+0+0+1 (mod 2) = 0 

Alice adds parity bit and sends:  10010

Bob receives:                   10010

Bob computes parity:            1+0+0+1+0 (mod 2) = 0

Bob reports correct transmission after observing expected even result.
|-
| Odd parity ||
Alice wants to transmit:          1001

Alice computes parity bit value:  1+0+0+1 (mod 2) = 0

Alice adds parity bit and sends:  1001'''1'''

Bob receives:                   10011

Bob computes overall parity:    1+0+0+1+1 (mod 2) = 1

Bob reports correct transmission after observing expected odd result.
|}

This mechanism enables the detection of single bit errors, because if one bit gets flipped due to line noise, there will be an incorrect number of ones in the received data. In the two examples above, Bob's calculated parity value matches the parity bit in its received value, indicating there are no single bit errors. Consider the following example with a transmission error in the second bit using XOR:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Type of bit parity error !! Failed transmission scenario
|-
| Even parity
Error in the second bit 
|| Alice wants to transmit:          1001

Alice computes parity bit value:  1^0^0^1 = 0

Alice adds parity bit and sends:  10010

'''...TRANSMISSION ERROR...'''

Bob receives:                   1'''1'''010

Bob computes overall parity:    1^1^0^1^0 = 1

Bob reports incorrect transmission after observing unexpected odd result.
|-
| Even parity
Error in the parity bit 
||Alice wants to transmit:          1001

Alice computes even parity value: 1^0^0^1 = 0

Alice sends:                      10010

'''...TRANSMISSION ERROR...'''

Bob receives:                   1001'''1'''

Bob computes overall parity:    1^0^0^1^1 = 1

Bob reports incorrect transmission after observing unexpected odd result.
|}

There is a limitation to parity schemes. A parity bit is only guaranteed to detect an odd number of bit errors. If an even number of bits have errors, the parity bit records the correct number of ones, even though the data is corrupt. (See also [[error detection and correction]].) Consider the same example as before with an even number of corrupted bits:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Type of bit parity error !! Failed transmission scenario
|-
| Even parity
Two corrupted bits 
|| Alice wants to transmit:          1001

Alice computes even parity value: 1^0^0^1 = 0

Alice sends:                      10010

'''...TRANSMISSION ERROR...'''

Bob receives:                   1'''1'''01'''1'''

Bob computes overall parity:    1^1^0^1^1 = 0

Bob reports correct transmission though actually incorrect.
|}
Bob observes even parity, as expected, thereby failing to catch the two bit errors.

==Usage==
Because of its simplicity, parity is used in many [[computer hardware|hardware]] applications where an operation can be repeated in case of difficulty, or where simply detecting the error is helpful. For example, the [[SCSI]]  and [[PCI bus]]es use parity to detect transmission errors, and many [[microprocessor]] instruction [[CPU cache|caches]] include parity protection. Because the [[Instruction cache|I-cache]] data is just a copy of [[main memory]], it can be disregarded and re-fetched if it is found to be corrupted.

In [[serial communications|serial]] [[data transmission]], a common format is 7 data bits, an even parity bit, and one or two [[stop bit]]s. This format neatly accommodates all the 7-bit [[ASCII]] characters in a convenient 8-bit byte. Other formats are possible; 8 bits of data plus a parity bit can convey all 8-bit byte values. 

In serial communication contexts, parity is usually generated and checked by interface hardware (e.g., a [[Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter|UART]]) and, on reception, the result made available to a [[Processor (computing)|processor]] such as the CPU (and so too, for instance, the [[operating system]]) via a status bit in a [[hardware register]] in the [[Interface (computing)|interface]] hardware. Recovery from the error is usually done by retransmitting the data, the details of which are usually handled by software (e.g., the operating system I/O routines).

When the total number of transmitted bits, including the parity bit, is even, odd parity has the advantage that the all-zeros and all-ones patterns are both detected as errors.  If the total number of bits is odd, only one of the patterns is detected as an error, and the choice can be made based on which is expected to be the more common error.

===Redundant array of independent disks===
Parity data is used by some [[RAID|redundant array of independent disks]] (RAID) levels to achieve [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]]. If a drive in the array fails, remaining data on the other drives can be combined with the parity data (using the Boolean [[XOR]] function) to reconstruct the missing data.

For example, suppose two drives in a three-drive [[RAID 5]] array contained the following data:

Drive 1: '''01101101'''&lt;br /&gt;Drive 2: '''11010100'''

To calculate parity data for the two drives, an XOR is performed on their data:

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;'''01101101'''&lt;br /&gt;XOR '''11010100'''&lt;br /&gt;   _____________&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; '''10111001'''

The resulting parity data, '''10111001''', is then stored on Drive 3.

Should any of the three drives fail, the contents of the failed drive can be reconstructed on a replacement drive by subjecting the data from the remaining drives to the same XOR operation. If Drive 2 were to fail, its data could be rebuilt using the XOR results of the contents of the two remaining drives, Drive 1 and Drive 3:

Drive 1: '''01101101'''&lt;br /&gt;Drive 3: '''10111001'''

as follows:

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;'''10111001'''&lt;br /&gt;XOR '''01101101'''&lt;br /&gt;  _____________&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; '''11010100'''

The result of that XOR calculation yields Drive 2's contents. '''11010100''' is then stored on Drive 2, fully repairing the array. This same XOR concept applies similarly to larger arrays, using any number of disks. In the case of a RAID 3 array of 12 drives, 11 drives participate in the XOR calculation shown above and yield a value that is then stored on the dedicated parity drive.

== History ==
A "parity track" was present on the first [[magnetic tape data storage]] in 1951. Parity in this form, applied across multiple parallel signals, is known as a [[transverse redundancy check]]. This can be combined with parity computed over multiple bits sent on a single signal, a [[longitudinal redundancy check]]. In a parallel bus, there is one longitudinal redundancy check bit per parallel signal.

Parity was also used on at least some paper-tape ([[punched tape]]) data entry systems (which preceded magnetic tape systems). On the systems sold by British company ICL (formerly ICT) the {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} paper tape had 8 hole positions running across it, with the 8th being for parity. 7 positions were used for the data, e.g., 7-bit ASCII. The 8th position had a hole punched in it depending on the number of data holes punched.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4909">In [[topological graph theory]], the '''Petrie dual''' of a [[graph embedding|embedded graph]] (on a 2-[[manifold]] with all faces disks) is another embedded graph that has the [[Petrie polygon]]s of the first embedding as its faces.{{r|gorini}}

The Petrie dual is also called the '''Petrial''', and the Petrie dual of an embedded graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; may be denoted &lt;math&gt;G^\pi&lt;/math&gt;.{{r|arp}}
It can be obtained from a signed [[rotation system]] or [[ribbon graph]] representation of the embedding by twisting every edge of the embedding.

==Properties==
Like the usual [[dual graph]], repeating the Petrie dual operation twice returns to the original surface embedding.
Unlike the usual dual graph (which is an embedding of a generally different graph in the same surface) the Petrie dual is an embedding of the same graph in a generally different surface.{{r|gorini}}

Surface duality and Petrie duality are two of the six [[Wilson operation]]s, and together generate the group of these operations.{{r|jt}}

==Regular polyhedra==
Appying the Petrie dual to a [[regular polyhedron]] produces a [[regular map (graph theory)|regular map]].{{r|arp}}

For example, the Petrie dual of a cube (a [[bipartite graph]] with eight vertices and twelve edges, embedded onto a sphere with six square faces)
has four hexagonal faces, the equators of the cube. Topologically, it forms an embedding of the same graph onto a torus.{{r|gorini}}

The regular maps obtained in this way are as follows.
* The ''petrial tetrahedron'', {3,3}&lt;sup&gt;{{pi}}&lt;/sup&gt;, has 4 vertices, 6 edges, and 3 skew square faces. With an [[Euler characteristic]], ''χ'', of 1, it is topologically identical to the [[hemi-cube (geometry)|hemi-cube]], {4,3}/2.
* The ''petrial cube'', {4,3}&lt;sup&gt;{{pi}}&lt;/sup&gt;, has 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 4 skew hexagons, colored red, green, blue and orange here.

In [[theoretical physics]], '''quantum field theory''' ('''QFT''') is a theoretical framework that combines [[classical field theory]], [[special relativity]], and [[quantum mechanics]]&lt;ref name="peskin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Peskin |first=M. |authorlink=Michael Peskin |last2=Schroeder |first2=D.

QFT treats particles as [[excited state]]s (also called [[Quantum|quanta]]) of their underlying [[field (physics)|field]]s, which are—in a sense—more fundamental than the basic particles. Interactions between particles are described by interaction terms in the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] involving their corresponding fields. Each interaction can be visually represented by [[Feynman diagram]]s, which are formal computational tools, in the process of relativistic [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]].

== History ==
As a successful theoretical framework today, quantum field theory emerged from the work of generations of theoretical physicists spanning much of the 20th century. Its development began in the 1920s with the description of interactions between [[light]] and [[electrons]], culminating in the first quantum field theory — [[quantum electrodynamics]]. A major theoretical obstacle soon followed with the appearance and persistence of various infinities in perturbative calculations, a problem only resolved in the 1950s with the invention of the [[renormalization]] procedure. A second major barrier came with QFT's apparent inability to describe the [[weak interaction|weak]] and [[strong interaction]]s, to the point where some theorists called for the abandonment of the field theoretic approach. The development of [[gauge theory]] and the completion of the [[Standard Model]] in the 1970s led to a renaissance of quantum field theory.

=== Theoretical background ===

Quantum field theory is the result of the combination of [[classical field theory]], [[quantum mechanics]], and [[special relativity]].&lt;ref name="peskin"/&gt;{{rp|xi}} A brief overview of these theoretical precursors is in order.

The earliest successful classical field theory is one that emerged from [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], despite the complete absence of the concept of fields from his 1687 treatise ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. The force of gravity as described by Newton is an "[[action at a distance]]" — its effects on faraway objects are instantaneous, no matter the distance. In an exchange of letters with [[Richard Bentley]], however, Newton stated that "it is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without the mediation of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter without mutual contact."&lt;ref name=Hobson/&gt;{{rp|4}} It was not until the 18th century that mathematical physicists discovered a convenient description of gravity based on fields — a numerical quantity (a [[vector (mathematics and physics)]]) assigned to every point in space indicating the action of gravity on any particle at that point. However, this was considered merely a mathematical trick.&lt;ref name="weinberg"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weinberg |first=Steven |author-link=Steven Weinberg |date=1977 |title=The Search for Unity: Notes for a History of Quantum Field Theory |journal=Daedalus |volume=106 |issue=4 |pages=17–35 |jstor=20024506 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}

Fields began to take on an existence of their own with the development of [[electromagnetism]] in the 19th century. [[Michael Faraday]] coined the English term "field" in 1845. He introduced fields as properties of space (even when it is devoid of matter) having physical effects. He argued against "action at a distance", and proposed that interactions between objects occur via space-filling "lines of force". This description of fields remains to this day.&lt;ref name=Hobson&gt;{{cite journal

Heilbron|title=The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science|date=14 February 2003|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-974376-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|301}}&lt;ref name="Thomson1893"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph John Thomson|authorlink=Joseph John Thomson|title=Notes on Recent Researches in Electricity and Magnetism: Intended as a Sequel to Professor Clerk-Maxwell's 'Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism'.|year=1893|publisher=Dawsons}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

The theory of [[classical electromagnetism]] was completed in 1862 with [[Maxwell's equation]]s, which described the relationship between the [[electric field]], the [[magnetic field]], [[electric current]], and [[electric charge]]. Maxwell's equations implied the existence of [[electromagnetic waves]], a phenomenon whereby electric and magnetic fields propagate from one spatial point to another at a finite speed, which turns out to be the [[speed of light]]. Action-at-a-distance was thus conclusively refuted.&lt;ref name=Hobson/&gt;{{rp|19}} 

Despite the enormous success of classical electromagnetism, it was unable to account for the discrete lines in [[emission spectrum|atomic spectra]], nor for the distribution of [[blackbody radiation]] in different wavelengths.&lt;ref name="weisskopf"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weisskopf |first=Victor |author-link=Victor Weisskopf |date=November 1981 |title=The development of field theory in the last 50 years |journal=[[Physics Today]] |volume=34 |issue=11 |pages=69–85 |doi=10.1063/1.2914365 |bibcode=1981PhT....34k..69W }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Planck]]'s study of blackbody radiation marked the beginning of quantum mechanics. He treated atoms, which absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation, as tiny [[oscillator]]s with the crucial property that their energies can only take on a series of discrete, rather than continuous, values. These are known as [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]s. This process of restricting energies to discrete values is called quantization.&lt;ref name="Heisenberg1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Werner Heisenberg|authorlink=Werner Heisenberg|title=Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science| url=https://archive.org/details/PhysicsPhilosophy|year=1999|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-57392-694-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Ch.2}} Building on this idea, [[Albert Einstein]] proposed in 1905 an explanation for the [[photoelectric effect]], that light is composed of individual packets of energy called [[photon]]s (the quanta of light). This implied that the electromagnetic radiation, while being waves in the classical electromagnetic field, also exists in the form of particles.&lt;ref name="weisskopf" /&gt;

In 1913, [[Niels Bohr]] introduced the [[Bohr model]] of atomic structure, wherein [[electrons]] within atoms can only take on a series of discrete, rather than continuous, energies. This is another example of quantization. The Bohr model successfully explained the discrete nature of atomic spectral lines. In 1924, [[Louis de Broglie]] proposed the hypothesis of [[wave-particle duality]], that microscopic particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties under different circumstances.&lt;ref name="weisskopf" /&gt; Uniting these scattered ideas, a coherent discipline, [[quantum mechanics]], was formulated between 1925 and 1926, with important contributions from de Broglie, [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Max Born]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]], [[Paul Dirac]], and [[Wolfgang Pauli]].{{r|weinberg|page1=22-23}}

In the same year as his paper on the photoelectric effect, Einstein published his theory of [[special relativity]], built on Maxwell's electromagnetism. New rules, called [[Lorentz transformation]], were given for the way time and space coordinates of an event change under changes in the observer's velocity, and the distinction between time and space was blurred.{{r|weinberg|page1=19}} It was proposed that all physical laws must be the same for observers at different velocities, ''i.e.'' that physical laws be invariant under Lorentz transformations.

Two difficulties remained. Observationally, the [[Schrödinger equation]] underlying quantum mechanics could explain the [[stimulated emission]] of radiation from atoms, where an electron emits a new photon under the action of an external electromagnetic field, but it was unable to explain [[spontaneous emission]], where an electron spontaneously decreases in energy and emits a photon even without the action of an external electromagnetic field. Theoretically, the Schrödinger equation could not describe photons and was inconsistent with the principles of special relativity — it treats time as an ordinary number while promoting spatial coordinates to [[linear operator]]s.&lt;ref name="weisskopf" /&gt;

=== Quantum electrodynamics ===
Quantum field theory naturally began with the study of electromagnetic interactions, as the electromagnetic field was the only known classical field as of the 1920s.{{r|shifman|page1=1}}

Through the works of Born, Heisenberg, and [[Pascual Jordan]] in 1925-1926, a quantum theory of the free electromagnetic field (one with no interactions with matter) was developed via [[canonical quantization]] by treating the electromagnetic field as a set of [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]s.{{r|shifman|page1=1}} With the exclusion of interactions, however, such a theory was yet incapable of making quantitative predictions about the real world.{{r|weinberg|page1=22}}

In his seminal 1927 paper ''The quantum theory of the emission and absorption of radiation'', Dirac coined the term [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED), a theory that adds upon the terms describing the free electromagnetic field an additional interaction term between electric [[current density]] and the [[electromagnetic four-potential|electromagnetic vector potential]]. Using first-order [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]], he successfully explained the phenomenon of spontaneous emission. According to the [[uncertainty principle]] in quantum mechanics, quantum harmonic oscillators cannot remain stationary, but they have a non-zero minimum energy and must always be oscillating, even in the lowest energy state (the [[ground state]]). Therefore, even in a perfect [[vacuum]], there remains an oscillating electromagnetic field having [[zero-point energy]]. It is this [[quantum fluctuation]] of electromagnetic fields in the vacuum that "stimulates" the spontaneous emission of radiation by electrons in atoms. Dirac's theory was hugely successful in explaining both the emission and absorption of radiation by atoms; by applying second-order perturbation theory, it was able to account for the [[scattering]] of photons, [[resonance fluorescence]], as well as non-relativistic [[Compton scattering]]. Nonetheless, the application of higher-order perturbation theory was plagued with problematic infinities in calculations.&lt;ref name="weisskopf" /&gt;{{rp|71}}

In 1928, Dirac wrote down a [[wave equation]] that described relativistic electrons — the [[Dirac equation]]. It had the following important consequences: the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of an electron is 1/2; the electron [[g-factor (physics)|''g''-factor]] is 2; it led to the correct Sommerfeld formula for the [[fine structure]] of the [[hydrogen atom]]; and it could be used to derive the [[Klein-Nishina formula]] for relativistic Compton scattering. Although the results were fruitful, the theory also apparently implied the existence of negative energy states, which would cause atoms to be unstable, since they could always decay to lower energy states by the emission of radiation.&lt;ref name="weisskopf" /&gt;{{rp|71–72}}

The prevailing view at the time was that the world was composed of two very different ingredients: material particles (such as electrons) and quantum fields (such as photons). Material particles were considered to be eternal, with their physical state described by the probabilities of finding each particle in any given region of space or range of velocities. On the other hand photons were considered merely the [[excited state]]s of the underlying quantized electromagnetic field, and could be freely created or destroyed. It was between 1928 and 1930 that Jordan, [[Eugene Wigner]], Heisenberg, Pauli, and [[Enrico Fermi]] discovered that material particles could also be seen as excited states of quantum fields. Just as photons are excited states of the quantized electromagnetic field, so each type of particle had its corresponding quantum field: an electron field, a proton field, etc. Given enough energy, it would now be possible to create material particles. Building on this idea, Fermi proposed in 1932 an explanation for [[β decay|''β'' decay]] known as [[Fermi's interaction]]. [[Atomic nuclei]] do not contain electrons ''per se'', but in the process of decay, an electron is created out of the surrounding electron field, analogous to the photon created from the surrounding electromagnetic field in the radiative decay of an excited atom.{{r|weinberg|page1=22-23}}

It was realized in 1929 by Dirac and others that negative energy states implied by the Dirac equation could be removed by assuming the existence of particles with the same mass as electrons but opposite electric charge. This not only ensured the stability of atoms, but it was also the first proposal of the existence of [[antimatter]]. Indeed, the evidence for [[positron]]s was discovered in 1932 by [[Carl David Anderson]] in [[cosmic ray]]s. With enough energy, such as by absorbing a photon, an electron-positron pair could be created, a process called [[pair production]]; the reverse process, annihilation, could also occur with the emission of a photon. This showed that particle numbers need not be fixed during an interaction. Historically, however, positrons were at first thought of as "holes" in an infinite electron sea, rather than a new kind of particle, and this theory was referred to as the [[Dirac hole theory]].&lt;ref name="weisskopf" /&gt;{{rp|72}}{{r|weinberg|page1=23}} QFT naturally incorporated antiparticles in its formalism.{{r|weinberg|page1=24}}

=== Infinities and renormalization ===
[[Robert Oppenheimer]] showed in 1930 that higher-order perturbative calculations in QED always resulted in infinite quantities, such as the electron [[self-energy]] and the vacuum zero-point energy of the electron and photon fields,&lt;ref name="weisskopf" /&gt; suggesting that the computational methods at the time could not properly deal with interactions involving photons with extremely high momenta.{{r|weinberg|page1=25}} It was not until 20 years later that a systematic approach to remove such infinities was developed.

A series of papers were published between 1934 and 1938 by [[Ernst Stueckelberg]] that established a relativistically invariant formulation of QFT. In 1947, Stueckelberg also independently developed a complete renormalization procedure. Unfortunately, such achievements were not understood and recognized by the theoretical community.&lt;ref name="weisskopf" /&gt;

Faced with these infinities, [[John Archibald Wheeler]] and Heisenberg proposed, in 1937 and 1943 respectively, to supplant the problematic QFT with the so-called [[S-matrix theory]]. Since the specific details of microscopic interactions are inaccessible to observations, the theory should only attempt to describe the relationships between a small number of [[observable]]s (''e.g.'' the energy of an atom) in an interaction, rather than be concerned with the microscopic minutiae of the interaction. In 1945, [[Richard Feynman]] and Wheeler daringly suggested abandoning QFT altogether and proposed [[action-at-a-distance]] as the mechanism of particle interactions.{{r|weinberg|page1=26}}

In 1947, [[Willis Lamb]] and [[Robert Retherford]] measured the minute difference in the &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''S''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; energy levels of the hydrogen atom, also called the [[Lamb shift]]. By ignoring the contribution of photons whose energy exceeds the electron mass, [[Hans Bethe]] successfully estimated the numerical value of the Lamb shift.&lt;ref name="weisskopf" /&gt;{{r|weinberg|page1=28}} Subsequently, [[Norman Myles Kroll]], Lamb, [[James Bruce French]], and [[Victor Weisskopf]] again confirmed this value using an approach in which infinities cancelled other infinities to result in finite quantities. However, this method was clumsy and unreliable and could not be generalized to other calculations.&lt;ref name="weisskopf" /&gt;

The breakthrough eventually came around 1950 when a more robust method for eliminating infinities was developed [[Julian Schwinger]], Feynman, [[Freeman Dyson]], and [[Shinichiro Tomonaga]]. The main idea is to replace the initial, so-called "bare", parameters (mass, electric charge, etc.), which have no physical meaning, by their finite measured values. To cancel the apparently infinite parameters, one has to introduce additional, infinite, "counterterms" into the Lagrangian. This systematic computational procedure is known as [[renormalization]] and can be applied to arbitrary order in perturbation theory.&lt;ref name="weisskopf" /&gt;

By applying the renormalization procedure, calculations were finally made to explain the electron's [[anomalous magnetic moment]] (the deviation of the electron [[g-factor (physics)|''g''-factor]] from 2) and [[vacuum polarisation]]. These results agreed with experimental measurements to a remarkable degree, thus marking the end of a "war against infinities".&lt;ref name="weisskopf" /&gt;

At the same time, Feynman introduced the [[path integral formulation]] of quantum mechanics and [[Feynman diagrams]].{{r|shifman|page1=2}} The latter can be used to visually and intuitively organise and to help compute terms in the perturbative expansion. Each diagram can be interpreted as paths of particles in an interaction, with each vertex and line having a corresponding mathematical expression, and the product of these expressions gives the [[scattering amplitude]] of the interaction represented by the diagram.{{r|peskin|page1=5}}

It was with the invention of the renormalization procedure and Feynman diagrams that QFT finally arose as a complete theoretical framework.{{r|shifman|page1=2}}

=== Non-renormalizability ===
Given the tremendous success of QED, many theorists believed, in the few years after 1949, that QFT could soon provide an understanding of all microscopic phenomena, not only the interactions between photons, electrons, and positrons. Contrary to this optimism, QFT entered yet another period of depression that lasted for almost two decades.{{r|weinberg|page1=30}}

The first obstacle was the limited applicability of the renormalization procedure. In perturbative calculations in QED, all infinite quantities could be eliminated by redefining a small (finite) number of physical quantities (namely the mass and charge of the electron). Dyson proved in 1949 that this is only possible for a small class of theories called "renormalizable theories", of which QED is an example. However, most theories, including the [[Fermi's interaction|Fermi theory]] of the [[weak interaction]], are "non-renormalizable". Any perturbative calculation in these theories beyond the first order would result in infinities that could not be removed by redefining a finite number of physical quantities.{{r|weinberg|page1=30}}

The second major problem stemmed from the limited validity of the Feynman diagram method, which are based on a series expansion in perturbation theory. In order for the series to converge and low-order calculations to be a good approximation, the [[coupling constant]], in which the series is expanded, must be a sufficiently small number. The coupling constant in QED is the [[fine-structure constant]] {{math|''α'' ≈ 1/137}}, which is small enough that only the simplest, lowest order, Feynman diagrams need to be considered in realistic calculations. In contrast, the coupling constant in the [[strong interaction]] is roughly of the order of one, making complicated, higher order, Feynman diagrams just as important as simple ones. There was thus no way of deriving reliable quantitative predictions for the strong interaction using perturbative QFT methods.{{r|weinberg|page1=31}}

With these difficulties looming, many theorists began to turn away from QFT. Some focused on [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] principles and [[conservation law]]s, while others picked up the old S-matrix theory of Wheeler and Heisenberg. QFT was used heuristically as guiding principles, but not as a basis for quantitative calculations.{{r|weinberg|page1=31}}

=== Standard Model ===
[[File:Standard Model of Elementary Particles.svg|thumb|300px|[[Elementary particles]] of the [[Standard Model]]: six types of matter [[quark]]s, four types of [[gauge boson]]s that carry [[fundamental interaction]]s, as well as the [[Higgs boson]], which endow elementary particles with mass.]]
In 1954, [[Yang Chen-Ning]] and [[Robert Mills (physicist)|Robert Mills]] generalised the [[gauge theory|local symmetry]] of QED, leading to [[Yang-Mills theory|non-Abelian gauge theories]] (also known as Yang-Mills theories), which are based on more complicated local [[symmetry group]]s.&lt;ref name="thooft"&gt;{{Cite book |last='t Hooft |first=Gerard |author-link=Gerard 't Hooft |arxiv=1503.05007 |chapter=The Evolution of Quantum Field Theory |title=The Standard Theory of Particle Physics |journal=&lt;!-- --&gt; |volume=26 |pages=1–27 |date=2015-03-17 |bibcode=2016stpp.conf....1T |doi=10.1142/9789814733519_0001 |series=Advanced Series on Directions in High Energy Physics |isbn=978-981-4733-50-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} In QED, (electrically) charged particles interact via the exchange of photons, while in non-Abelian gauge theory, particles carrying a new type of "[[charge (physics)|charge]]" interact via the exchange of massless [[gauge boson]]s. Unlike photons, these gauge bosons themselves carry charge.{{r|weinberg|page1=32}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yang |first1=C. N. |last2=Mills |first2=R.

[[Sheldon Glashow]] developed a non-Abelian gauge theory that unified the electromagnetic and weak interactions in 1960. In 1964, [[Abdul Salam]] and [[John Clive Ward]] arrived at the same theory through a different path. This theory, nevertheless, was non-renormalizable.&lt;ref name="coleman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coleman |first=Sidney |author-link=Sidney Coleman |date=1979-12-14 |title=The 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=206 |issue=4424 |pages=1290–1292 |jstor=1749117 |bibcode=1979Sci...206.1290C |doi=10.1126/science.206.4424.1290 |pmid=17799637 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Higgs]], [[Robert Brout]], and [[François Englert]] proposed in 1964 that the gauge symmetry in Yang-Mills theories could be broken by a mechanism called [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], through which originally massless gauge bosons could acquire mass.{{r|thooft|page1=5-6}}

By combining the earlier theory of Glashow, Salam, and Ward with the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking, [[Steven Weinberg]] wrote down in 1967 a theory describing [[electroweak interaction]]s between all [[lepton]]s and the effects of the [[Higgs boson]]. His theory was at first mostly ignored,&lt;ref name="coleman" /&gt;{{r|thooft|page1=6}} until it was brought back to light in 1971 by [[Gerard 't Hooft]]'s proof that non-Abelian gauge theories are renormalizable. The electroweak theory of Weinberg and Salam was extended from leptons to [[quark]]s in 1970 by Glashow, [[John Iliopoulos]], and [[Luciano Maiani]], marking its completion.&lt;ref name="coleman" /&gt;

[[Harald Fritzsch]], [[Murray Gell-Mann]], and [[Heinrich Leutwyler]] discovered in 1971 that certain phenomena involving the [[strong interaction]] could also be explained by non-Abelian gauge theory. [[Quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) was born. In 1973, [[David Gross]], [[Frank Wilczek]], and [[Hugh David Politzer]] showed that non-Abelian gauge theories are "[[asymptotic freedom|asymptotically free]]", meaning that under renormalization, the coupling constant of the strong interaction decreases as the interaction energy increases. (Similar discoveries had been made numerous times prior, but they had been largely ignored.) {{r|thooft|page1=11}} Therefore, at least in high-energy interactions, the coupling constant in QCD becomes sufficiently small to warrant a perturbative series expansion, making quantitative predictions for the strong interaction possible.{{r|weinberg|page1=32}}

These theoretical breakthroughs brought about a renaissance in QFT. The full theory, which includes the electroweak theory and chromodynamics, is referred to today as the [[Standard Model]] of elementary particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Standard-Model |title=Standard model |last=Sutton |first=Christine |authorlink=Christine Sutton |website=britannica.com |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Standard Model successfully describes all [[fundamental interaction]]s except [[gravity]], and its many predictions have been met with remarkable experimental confirmation in subsequent decades.{{r|shifman|page1=3}} The [[Higgs boson]], central to the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking, was finally detected in 2012 at [[CERN]], marking the complete verification of the existence of all constituents of the Standard Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Kibble |first=Tom W. B. |author-link=Tom Kibble |eprint=1412.4094 |title=The Standard Model of Particle Physics |class=physics.hist-ph |date=2014-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other developments ===
The 1970s saw the development of non-perturbative methods in non-Abelian gauge theories. The [['t Hooft-Polyakov monopole]] was discovered by 't Hooft and [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov|Alexander Polyakov]], [[flux tube]]s by [[Holger Bech Nielsen]] and [[Poul Olesen]], and [[instanton]]s by Polyakov ''et al.''. These objects are inaccessible through perturbation theory.{{r|shifman|page1=4}}

[[Supersymmetry]] also appeared in the same period. The first supersymmetric QFT in four dimensions was built by [[Yuri Golfand]] and [[Evgeny Likhtman]] in 1970, but their result failed to garner widespread interest due to the [[Iron Curtain]]. Supersymmetry only took off in the theoretical community after the work of [[Julius Wess]] and [[Bruno Zumino]] in 1973.{{r|shifman|page1=7}}

Among the four fundamental interactions, gravity remains the only one that lacks a consistent QFT description. Various attempts at a theory of [[quantum gravity]] led to the development of [[string theory]],{{r|shifman|page1=6}} itself a type of two-dimensional QFT with [[conformal symmetry]].&lt;ref name="polchinski1" /&gt; [[Joël Scherk]] and [[John Henry Schwarz|John Schwarz]] first proposed in 1974 that string theory could be ''the'' quantum theory of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Schwarz |first=John H. |author-link=John Henry Schwarz |eprint=1201.0981 |title=The Early History of String Theory and Supersymmetry |class=physics.hist-ph |date=2012-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Condensed matter physics ===

Although quantum field theory arose from the study of interactions between elementary particles, it has been successfully applied to other physical systems, particularly to [[many-body system]]s in [[condensed matter physics]].

Historically, the Higgs mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking was a result of [[Yoichiro Nambu]]'s application of [[superconductor]] theory to elementary particles, while the concept of renormalization came out of the study of second-order [[phase transition]]s in matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.energy.gov/~/media/hep/pdf/Reports/HEP-BES_Roundtable_Report.pdf |title=Common Problems in Condensed Matter and High Energy Physics |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2015-02-02 |website=science.energy.gov |publisher=Office of Science, [[U.S. Department of Energy]] |access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the introduction of photons, Einstein performed the quantization procedure on vibrations in a crystal, leading to the first [[quasiparticle]] — [[phonon]]s. Lev Landau claimed that low-energy excitations in many condensed matter systems could be described in terms of interactions between a set of quasiparticles. The Feynman diagram method of QFT was naturally well suited to the analysis of various phenomena in condensed matter systems.&lt;ref name="wilczek"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wilczek |first=Frank |author-link=Frank Wilczek |arxiv=1604.05669 |title=Particle Physics and Condensed Matter: The Saga Continues |journal=Physica Scripta |volume=2016 |issue=T168 |pages=014003 |date=2016-04-19 |bibcode=2016PhST..168a4003W |doi=10.1088/0031-8949/T168/1/014003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauge theory is used to describe the quantization of [[magnetic flux]] in superconductors, the [[resistivity]] in the [[quantum Hall effect]], as well as the relation between frequency and voltage in the AC [[Josephson effect]].&lt;ref name="wilczek" /&gt;

== Principles ==
For simplicity, [[natural units]] are used in the following sections, in which the [[reduced Planck constant]] {{math|''ħ''}} and the [[speed of light]] {{math|''c''}} are both set to one.

=== Classical fields ===
{{See also|Classical field theory}}

A classical [[field (physics)|field]] is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of spatial and time coordinates.&lt;ref name="tong1"&gt;{{harvnb|Tong|2015|loc=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[gravitational field]] in [[Newtonian gravity]] {{math|'''g'''('''x''', ''t'')}} and the [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''('''x''', ''t'')}} and [[magnetic field]] {{math|'''B'''('''x''', ''t'')}} in [[classical electromagnetism]]. A classical field can be thought of as a numerical quantity assigned to every point in space that changes in time. Hence, it has infinite [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]].&lt;ref name="tong1" /&gt;

Many phenomena exhibiting quantum mechanical properties cannot be explained by classical fields alone. Phenomena such as the [[photoelectric effect]] are best explained by discrete particles ([[photon]]s), rather than a spatially continuous field. The goal of quantum field theory is to describe various quantum mechanical phenomena using a modified concept of fields.

[[Canonical quantisation]] and [[path integral formulation|path integral]]s are two common formulations of QFT.&lt;ref name="zee"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zee |first=A. |date=2010 |title=Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-01019-9 |author-link=Anthony Zee }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}} To motivate the fundamentals of QFT, an overview of classical field theory is in order.

The simplest classical field is a real [[scalar field]] — a [[real number]] at every point in space that changes in time. It is denoted as {{math|''ϕ''('''x''', ''t'')}}, where {{math|'''x'''}} is the position vector, and {{math|''t''}} is the time. Suppose the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] of the field is
:&lt;math&gt;L = \int d^3x\,\mathcal{L} = \int d^3x\,\left[\frac 12 \dot\phi^2 - \frac 12 (\nabla\phi)^2 - \frac 12 m^2\phi^2\right],&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\dot\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the time-derivative of the field, {{math|∇}} is the [[divergence operator]], and {{math|''m''}} is a real parameter (the "mass" of the field). Applying the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] on the Lagrangian:{{r|peskin|page1=16}}
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left[\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial\phi/\partial t)}\right] + \sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \left[\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial\phi/\partial x^i)}\right] - \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\phi} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
we obtain the [[equations of motion]] for the field, which describe the way it varies in time and space:
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 + m^2\right)\phi = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
This is known as the [[Klein–Gordon equation]].{{r|peskin|page1=17}}

The Klein–Gordon equation is a [[wave equation]], so its solutions can be expressed as a sum of [[normal mode]]s (obtained via [[Fourier transform]]) as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(\mathbf{x}, t) = \int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega_{\mathbf{p}}}}\left(a_{\mathbf{p}} e^{-i\omega_{\mathbf{p}}t + i\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{x}} + a_{\mathbf{p}}^* e^{i\omega_{\mathbf{p}}t - i\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{x}}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''a''}} is a [[complex number]] (normalised by convention), {{math|*}} denotes [[complex conjugation]], and {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;'''p'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the frequency of the normal mode:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{\mathbf{p}} = \sqrt{|\mathbf{p}|^2 + m^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus each normal mode corresponding to a single {{math|'''p'''}} can be seen as a classical [[harmonic oscillator]] with frequency {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;'''p'''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.{{r|peskin|page1=21,26}}

=== Canonical quantisation ===
{{Main|Canonical quantisation}}

The quantisation procedure for the above classical field is analogous to the promotion of a classical harmonic oscillator to a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]].

The displacement of a classical harmonic oscillator is described by
:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega}} a e^{-i\omega t} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega}} a^* e^{i\omega t},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''a''}} is a complex number (normalised by convention), and {{math|''ω''}} is the oscillator's frequency. Note that {{math|''x''}} is the displacement of a particle in simple harmonic motion from the equilibrium position, which should not be confused with the spatial label {{math|'''x'''}} of a field.

For a quantum harmonic oscillator, {{math|''x''(''t'')}} is promoted to a [[linear operator]] &lt;math&gt;\hat x(t)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat x(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega}} \hat a e^{-i\omega t} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega}} \hat a^\dagger e^{i\omega t}.&lt;/math&gt;
Complex numbers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}} are replaced by the [[annihilation operator]] &lt;math&gt;\hat a&lt;/math&gt; and the [[creation operator]] &lt;math&gt;\hat a^\dagger&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, where {{math|†}} denotes [[Hermitian conjugation]]. The [[commutation relation]] between the two is
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat a,\hat a^\dagger] = 1.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[vacuum state]] &lt;math&gt;|0\rang&lt;/math&gt;, which is the lowest energy state, is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\hat a|0\rang = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Any quantum state of a single harmonic oscillator can be obtained from &lt;math&gt;|0\rang&lt;/math&gt; by successively applying the creation operator &lt;math&gt;\hat a^\dagger&lt;/math&gt;:{{r|peskin|page1=20}}
:&lt;math&gt;|n\rang = (\hat a^\dagger)^n|0\rang.&lt;/math&gt;

By the same token, the aforementioned real scalar field {{math|''ϕ''}}, which corresponds to {{math|''x''}} in the single harmonic oscillator, is also promoted to an operator &lt;math&gt;\hat\phi&lt;/math&gt;, while {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;'''p'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;'''p'''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}} are replaced by the annihilation operator &lt;math&gt;\hat a_{\mathbf{p}}&lt;/math&gt; and the creation operator &lt;math&gt;\hat a_{\mathbf{p}}^\dagger&lt;/math&gt; for a particular {{math|'''p'''}}, respectively:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat \phi(\mathbf{x}, t) = \int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega_{\mathbf{p}}}}\left(\hat a_{\mathbf{p}} e^{-i\omega_{\mathbf{p}}t + i\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{x}} + \hat a_{\mathbf{p}}^\dagger e^{i\omega_{\mathbf{p}}t - i\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{x}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
Their commutation relations are:{{r|peskin|page1=21}}
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat a_{\mathbf p},\hat a_{\mathbf q}^\dagger] = (2\pi)^3\delta(\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}),\quad [\hat a_{\mathbf p},\hat a_{\mathbf q}] = [\hat a_{\mathbf p}^\dagger,\hat a_{\mathbf q}^\dagger] = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''δ''}} is the [[Dirac delta function]]. The vacuum state &lt;math&gt;|0\rang&lt;/math&gt; is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\hat a_{\mathbf p}|0\rang = 0,\quad \text{for all }\mathbf p.&lt;/math&gt;
Any quantum state of the field can be obtained from &lt;math&gt;|0\rang&lt;/math&gt; by successively applying creation operators &lt;math&gt;\hat a_{\mathbf{p}}^\dagger&lt;/math&gt;, ''e.g.''{{r|peskin|page1=22}}
:&lt;math&gt;(\hat a_{\mathbf{p}_3}^\dagger)^3 \hat a_{\mathbf{p}_2}^\dagger (\hat a_{\mathbf{p}_1}^\dagger)^2 |0\rang.&lt;/math&gt;

Although the field appearing in the Lagrangian is spatially continuous, the quantum states of the field are discrete. While the state space of a single quantum harmonic oscillator contains all the discrete energy states of one oscillating particle, the state space of a quantum field contains the discrete energy levels of an arbitrary number of particles. The latter space is known as a [[Fock space]], which can account for the fact that particle numbers are not fixed in relativistic quantum systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fock |first1=V. |authorlink=Vladimir Fock |date=1932-03-10 |title=Konfigurationsraum und zweite Quantelung |journal=Zeitschrift für Physik |volume=75 |issue=9–10 |pages=622–647 |doi=10.1007/BF01344458 |language=de |bibcode=1932ZPhy...75..622F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of quantising an arbitrary number of particles instead of a single particle is often also called second quantisation.{{r|peskin|page1=19}}

The preceding procedure is a direct application of non-relativistic quantum mechanics and can be used to quantise (complex) scalar fields, [[Dirac field]]s,{{r|peskin|page1=52}} [[vector field]]s (''e.g.'' the electromagnetic field), and even [[string theory|strings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Becker |first1=Katrin |last2=Becker |first2=Melanie |last3=Schwarz |first3=John H. |date=2007 |title=String Theory and M-Theory |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=36 |isbn=978-0-521-86069-7 |author-link3=John Henry Schwarz }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, creation and annihilation operators are only well defined in the simplest theories that contain no interactions (so-called free theory). In the case of the real scalar field, the existence of these operators was a consequence of the decomposition of solutions of the classical equations of motion into a sum of normal modes. To perform calculations on any realistic interacting theory, [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] would be necessary.

The Lagrangian of any quantum field in nature would contain interaction terms in addition to the free theory terms. For example, a [[quartic interaction]] term could be introduced to the Lagrangian of the real scalar field:{{r|peskin|page1=77}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \frac 12 (\partial_\mu\phi)(\partial^\mu\phi) - \frac 12 m^2\phi^2 - \frac{\lambda}{4!}\phi^4,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''μ''}} is a spacetime index, &lt;math&gt;\partial_0 = \partial/\partial t,\ \partial_1 = \partial/\partial x^1&lt;/math&gt;, etc. The summation over the index {{math|''μ''}} has been omitted following the [[Einstein notation]]. If the parameter {{math|''λ''}} is sufficiently small, then the interacting theory described by the above Lagrangian can be considered as a small perturbation from the free theory.

=== Path integrals ===
{{Main|Path integral formulation}}

The [[path integral formulation]] of QFT is concerned with the direct computation of the [[scattering amplitude]] of a certain interaction process, rather than the establishment of operators and state spaces. To calculate the [[probability amplitude]] for a system to evolve from some initial state &lt;math&gt;|\phi_I\rang&lt;/math&gt; at time {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}} to some final state &lt;math&gt;|\phi_F\rang&lt;/math&gt; at {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''T''}}, the total time {{math|''T''}} is divided into {{math|''N''}} small intervals. The overall amplitude is the product of the amplitude of evolution within each interval, integrated over all intermediate states. Let {{math|''H''}} be the [[Hamiltonian (quantum field theory)|Hamiltonian]] (''i.e.'' [[time evolution operator|generator of time evolution]]), then{{r|zee|page1=10}}
:&lt;math&gt;\lang \phi_F|e^{-iHT}|\phi_I\rang = \int d\phi_1\int d\phi_2\cdots\int d\phi_{N-1}\,\lang \phi_F|e^{-iHT/N}|\phi_{N-1}\rang\cdots\lang \phi_2|e^{-iHT/N}|\phi_1\rang\lang \phi_1|e^{-iHT/N}|\phi_I\rang.&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the limit {{math|''N'' → ∞}}, the above product of integrals becomes the Feynman path integral:{{r|peskin|zee|page1=282|page2=12}}
:&lt;math&gt;\lang \phi_F|e^{-iHT}|\phi_I\rang = \int \mathcal{D}\phi(t)\,\exp\left\{i\int_0^T dt\,L\right\},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''L''}} is the Lagrangian involving {{math|''ϕ''}} and its derivatives with respect to spatial and time coordinates, obtained from the Hamiltonian {{math|''H''}} via [[Legendre transform]]. The initial and final conditions of the path integral are respectively
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(0) = \phi_I,\quad \phi(T) = \phi_F.&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, the overall amplitude is the sum over the amplitude of every possible path between the initial and final states, where the amplitude of a path is given by the exponential in the integrand.

=== Two-point correlation function ===
{{Main|Correlation function}}

Now we assume that the theory contains interactions whose Lagrangian terms are a small perturbation from the free theory.

In calculations, one often encounters such expressions:
:&lt;math&gt;\lang\Omega|T\{\phi(x)\phi(y)\}|\Omega\rang,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are position [[four-vector]]s, {{math|''T''}} is the [[time ordering]] operator (namely, it orders {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} according to their time-component, later time on the left and earlier time on the right), and &lt;math&gt;|\Omega\rang&lt;/math&gt; is the ground state (vacuum state) of the interacting theory. This expression, known as the two-point [[correlation function (quantum field theory)|correlation function]] or the two-point [[Green's function]], represents the probability amplitude for the field to propagate from {{math|''y''}} to {{math|''x''}}.{{r|peskin|page1=82}}

In canonical quantisation, the two-point correlation function can be written as:{{r|peskin|page1=87}}
:&lt;math&gt;\lang\Omega|T\{\phi(x)\phi(y)\}|\Omega\rang = \lim_{T\to\infty(1-i\epsilon)} \frac{\lang 0|T\left\{\phi_I(x)\phi_I(y)\exp\left[-i\int_{-T}^T dt\, H_I(t)\right]\right\}|0\rang}{\lang 0|T\left\{\exp\left[-i\int_{-T}^T dt\, H_I(t)\right]\right\}|0\rang},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ε''}} is an [[infinitesimal]] number, {{math|''ϕ&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the field operator under the free theory, and {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the interaction Hamiltonian term. For the {{math|''ϕ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} theory, it is{{r|peskin|page1=84}}
:&lt;math&gt;H_i(t) = \int dx^3\,\frac{\lambda}{4!}\phi_I(x)^4.&lt;/math&gt;
Since {{math|''λ''}} is a small parameter, the [[exponential function]] {{math|exp}} can be expanded into a [[Taylor series]] in {{math|''λ''}} and computed term by term. This equation is useful in that it expresses the field operator and ground state in the interacting theory, which are difficult to define, in terms of their counterparts in the free theory, which are well defined.

In the path integral formulation, the two-point correlation function can be written as:{{r|peskin|page1=284}}
:&lt;math&gt;\lang\Omega|T\{\phi(x)\phi(y)\}|\Omega\rang = \lim_{T\to\infty(1-i\epsilon)} \frac{\int\mathcal{D}\phi\,\phi(x)\phi(y)\exp\left[i\int_{-T}^T d^4z\,\mathcal{L}\right]}{\int\mathcal{D}\phi\,\exp\left[i\int_{-T}^T d^4z\,\mathcal{L}\right]},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the Lagrangian density. As in the previous paragraph, the exponential factor involving the interaction term can also be expanded as a series in {{math|''λ''}}.

According to [[Wick's theorem]], any {{math|''n''}}-point correlation function in the free theory can be written as a sum of products of two-point correlation functions. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\lang 0|T\{\phi(x_1)\phi(x_2)\phi(x_3)\phi(x_4)\}|0\rang =&amp; \lang 0|T\{\phi(x_1)\phi(x_2)\}|0\rang \lang 0|T\{\phi(x_3)\phi(x_4)\}|0\rang\\
&amp;+ \lang 0|T\{\phi(x_1)\phi(x_3)\}|0\rang \lang 0|T\{\phi(x_2)\phi(x_4)\}|0\rang\\
&amp;+ \lang 0|T\{\phi(x_1)\phi(x_4)\}|0\rang \lang 0|T\{\phi(x_2)\phi(x_3)\}|0\rang.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Since correlation functions in the interacting theory can be expressed in terms of those in the free theory, only the latter need to be evaluated in order to calculate all physical quantities in the (perturbative) interacting theory.{{r|peskin|page1=90}}

Either through canonical quantisation or path integrals, one can obtain:
:&lt;math&gt;D_F(x-y) \equiv \lang 0|T\{\phi(x)\phi(y)\}|0\rang = \int\frac{d^4p}{(2\pi)^4} \frac{i}{p_\mu p^\mu - m^2 + i\epsilon} e^{-ip_\mu (x^\mu - y^\mu)}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is known as the [[Feynman propagator]] for the real scalar field.{{r|peskin|zee|page1=31,288|page2=23}}

=== Feynman diagram ===
{{Main|Feynman diagram}}

Correlation functions in the interacting theory can be written as a perturbation series. Each term in the series is a product of Feynman propagators in the free theory and can be represented visually by a [[Feynman diagram]]. For example, the {{math|''λ''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} term in the two-point correlation function in the {{math|''ϕ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} theory is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{-i\lambda}{4!}\lang 0|T\{\phi(x)\phi(y)\int d^4z\,\phi(z)\phi(z)\phi(z)\phi(z)\}|0\rang.&lt;/math&gt;
After applying Wick's theorem, one of the terms is
:&lt;math&gt;12\cdot \frac{-i\lambda}{4!}\int d^4z\, D_F(x-z)D_F(y-z)D_F(z-z),&lt;/math&gt;
whose corresponding Feynman diagram is

[[File:Phi-4 one-loop.svg|200px]]

Every point corresponds to a single {{math|''ϕ''}} field factor. Points labelled with {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are called external points, while those in the interior are called internal points or vertices (there is one in this diagram). The value of the corresponding term can be obtained from the diagram by following "Feynman rules": assign &lt;math&gt;-i\lambda\int d^4z&lt;/math&gt; to every vertex and the Feynman propagator&lt;math&gt;D_F(x_1-x_2)&lt;/math&gt; to every line with end points {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The product of factors corresponding to every element in the diagram, divided by the "symmetry factor" (2 for this diagram), gives the expression for the term in the perturbation series.{{r|peskin|page1=91-94}}

In order to compute the {{math|''n''}}-point correlation function to the {{math|''k''}}-th order, list all valid Feynman diagrams with {{math|''n''}} external points and {{math|''k''}} or fewer vertices, and then use Feynman rules to obtain the expression for each term. To be precise,
:&lt;math&gt;\lang\Omega|T\{\phi(x_1)\cdots\phi(x_n)\}|\Omega\rang&lt;/math&gt;
is equal to the sum of (expressions corresponding to) all connected diagrams with {{math|''n''}} external points. (Connected diagrams are those in which every vertex is connected to an external point through lines. Components that are totally disconnected from external lines are sometimes called "vacuum bubbles".) In the {{math|''ϕ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} interaction theory discussed above, every vertex must have four legs.{{r|peskin|page1=98}}

In realistic applications, the scattering amplitude of a certain interaction or the [[decay rate]] of a particle can be computed from the [[S-matrix]], which itself can be found using the Feynman diagram method.{{r|peskin|page1=102-115}}

Feynman diagrams devoid of "loops" are called tree-level diagrams, which describe the lowest-order interaction processes; those containing {{math|''n''}} loops are referred to as {{math|''n''}}-loop diagrams, which describe higher-order contributions, or radiative corrections, to the interaction.{{r|zee|page1=44}} Lines whose end points are vertices can be thought of as the propagation of [[virtual particle]]s.{{r|peskin|page1=31}}

=== Renormalisation ===
{{Main|Renormalisation}}

Feynman rules can be used to directly evaluate tree-level diagrams. However, naïve computation of loop diagrams such as the one shown above will result in divergent momentum integrals, which seems to imply that almost all terms in the perturbative expansion are infinite. The [[renormalisation]] procedure is a systematic process for removing such infinities.

Parameters appearing in the Lagrangian, such as the mass {{math|''m''}} and the coupling constant {{math|''λ''}}, have no physical meaning — {{math|''m''}}, {{math|''λ''}}, and the field strength {{math|''ϕ''}} are not experimentally measurable quantities and are referred to here as the bare mass, bare coupling constant, and bare field, respectively. The physical mass and coupling constant are measured in some interaction process and are generally different from the bare quantities. While computing physical quantities from this interaction process, one may limit the domain of divergent momentum integrals to be below some momentum cut-off {{math|Λ}}, obtain expressions for the physical quantities, and then take the limit {{math|Λ → ∞}}. This is an example of [[regularization (physics)|regularisation]], a class of methods to treat divergences in QFT, with {{math|Λ}} being the regulator.

The approach illustrated above is called bare perturbation theory, as calculations involve only the bare quantities such as mass and coupling constant. A different approach, called renormalised perturbation theory, is to use physically meaningful quantities from the very beginning. In the case of {{math|''ϕ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} theory, the field strength is first redefined:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi = Z^{1/2}\phi_r,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ϕ''}} is the bare field, {{math|''ϕ&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the renormalised field, and {{math|''Z''}} is a constant to be determined. The Lagrangian density becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \frac 12 (\partial_\mu\phi_r)(\partial^\mu\phi_r) - \frac 12 m_r^2\phi_r^2 - \frac{\lambda}{4!}\phi_r^4 + \frac 12 \delta_Z (\partial_\mu\phi_r)(\partial^\mu\phi_r) - \frac 12 \delta_m\phi_r^2 - \frac{\delta_\lambda}{4!}\phi_r^4,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''m&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''λ&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the experimentally measurable, renormalised, mass and coupling constant, respectively, and
:&lt;math&gt;\delta_Z = Z-1,\quad \delta_m = m^2Z - m_r^2,\quad \delta_\lambda = \lambda Z^2 - \lambda_r&lt;/math&gt;
are constants to be determined. The first three terms are the {{math|''ϕ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} Lagrangian density written in terms of the renormalised quantities, while the latter three terms are referred to as "counterterms". As the Lagrangian now contains more terms, so the Feynman diagrams should include additional elements, each with their own Feynman rules. The procedure is outlined as follows. First select a regularisation scheme (such as the cut-off regularisation introduced above or [[dimensional regularization]]); call the regulator {{math|Λ}}. Compute Feynman diagrams, in which divergent terms will depend on {{math|Λ}}. Then, define {{math|''δ&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''δ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and {{math|''δ&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} such that Feynman diagrams for the counterterms will exactly cancel the divergent terms in the normal Feynman diagrams when the limit {{math|Λ → ∞}} is taken. In this way, meaningful finite quantities are obtained.{{r|peskin|page1=323-326}}

&lt;!--"Is it true?" The renormalisation procedure will lead to the same quantitative result and physical prediction irrespective of the regularisation scheme chosen. --&gt;It is only possible to eliminate all infinities to obtain a finite result in renormalisable theories, whereas in non-renormalisable theories infinities cannot be removed by the redefinition of a small number of parameters. The [[Standard Model]] of elementary particles is a renormalisable QFT,{{r|peskin|page1=719–727}} while [[quantum gravity]] is non-renormalisable.{{r|peskin|zee|page1=798|page2=421}}

==== Renormalisation group ====
{{Main|Renormalization group}}

The [[renormalisation group]], developed by [[Kenneth G. Wilson|Kenneth Wilson]], is a mathematical apparatus used to study the changes in physical parameters (coefficients in the Lagrangian) as the system is viewed at different scales.{{r|peskin|page1=393}} The way in which each parameter changes with scale is described by its [[beta function (physics)|''β'' function]].{{r|peskin|page1=417}} Correlation functions, which underlie quantitative physical predictions, change with scale according to the [[Callan–Symanzik equation]].{{r|peskin|page1=410-411}}

As an example, the coupling constant in QED, namely the [[elementary charge]] {{math|''e''}}, has the following ''β'' function:
:&lt;math&gt;\beta(e) \equiv \frac{1}{\Lambda}\frac{de}{d\Lambda} = \frac{e^3}{12\pi^2} + O(e^5),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|Λ}} is the energy scale under which the measurement of {{math|''e''}} is performed. This [[differential equation]] implies that the observed elementary charge increases as the scale increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Fujita |first=Takehisa |eprint=hep-th/0606101 |title=Physics of Renormalization Group Equation in QED |date=2008-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The renormalized coupling constant, which changes with the energy scale, is also called the running coupling constant.{{r|peskin|page1=420}}

The coupling constant {{math|''g''}} in [[quantum chromodynamics]], a non-Abelian gauge theory based on the symmetry group [[special unitary group|{{math|SU(3)}}]], has the following ''β'' function:
:&lt;math&gt;\beta(g) \equiv \frac{1}{\Lambda}\frac{dg}{d\Lambda} = \frac{g^3}{16\pi^2}\left(-11 + \frac 23 N_f\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the number of [[quark]] [[flavour (particle physics)|flavours]]. In the case where {{math|''N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ 16}} (the Standard Model has {{math|''N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 6}}), the coupling constant {{math|''g''}} decreases as the energy scale increases. Hence, while the strong interaction is strong at low energies, it becomes very weak in high-energy interactions, a phenomenon known as [[asymptotic freedom]].{{r|peskin|page1=531}}

[[Conformal field theories]] (CFTs) are special QFTs that admit [[conformal symmetry]]. They are insensitive to changes in the scale, as all their coupling constants have vanishing ''β'' function. (The converse is not true, however — the vanishing of all ''β'' functions does not imply conformal symmetry of the theory.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Aharony |first1=Ofer |last2=Gur-Ari |first2=Guy |last3=Klinghoffer |first3=Nizan |arxiv=1501.06664v3 |title=The Holographic Dictionary for Beta Functions of Multi-trace Coupling Constants |journal=Journal of High Energy Physics |volume=2015 |issue=5 |pages=31 |date=2015-05-19 |bibcode=2015JHEP...05..031A |doi=10.1007/JHEP05(2015)031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[string theory]]&lt;ref name="polchinski1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Polchinski |first=Joseph |date=2005 |title=String Theory |volume=1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-67227-6 |author-link=Joseph Polchinski }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[N = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory|{{math|''N'' {{=}} 4}} supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Kovacs |first=Stefano |eprint=hep-th/9908171 |title={{math|''N'' {{=}} 4}} supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory and the AdS/SCFT correspondence |date=1999-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wilson's picture, every QFT is fundamentally accompanied by its energy cut-off {{math|Λ}}, ''i.e.'' that the theory is no longer valid at energies higher than {{math|Λ}}, and all degrees of freedom above the scale {{math|Λ}} are to be omitted. For example, the cut-off could be the inverse of the atomic spacing in a condensed matter system, and in elementary particle physics it could be associated with the fundamental "graininess" of spacetime caused by quantum fluctuations in gravity. The cut-off scale of theories of particle interactions lies far beyond current experiments. Even if the theory were very complicated at that scale, as long as its couplings are sufficiently weak, it must be described at low energies by a renormalisable [[effective field theory]].{{r|peskin|page1=402-403}} The difference between renormalisable and non-renormalisable theories is that the former are insensitive to details at high energies, whereas the latter do depend of them.{{r|shifman|page1=2}} According to this view, non-renormalisable theories are to be seen as low-energy effective theories of a more fundamental theory. The failure to remove the cut-off {{math|Λ}} from calculations in such a theory merely indicates that new physical phenomena appear at scales above {{math|Λ}}, where a new theory is necessary.{{r|zee|page1=156}}

=== Other theories ===

The quantisation and renormalisation procedures outlined in the preceding sections are performed for the free theory and [[quartic interaction|{{math|''ϕ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} theory]] of the real scalar field. A similar process can be done for other types of fields, including the [[complex numbers|complex]] scalar field, the [[vector field]], and the [[Dirac field]], as well as other types of interaction terms, including the electromagnetic interaction and the [[Yukawa interaction]].

As an example, [[quantum electrodynamics]] contains a Dirac field {{math|''ψ''}} representing the [[electron]] field and a vector field {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} representing the electromagnetic field ([[photon]] field). (Despite its name, the quantum electromagnetic "field" actually corresponds to the classical [[electromagnetic four-potential]], rather than the classical electric and magnetic fields.) The full QED Lagrangian density is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \bar\psi(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu - m)\psi - \frac 14 F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} - e\bar\psi\gamma^\mu\psi A_\mu,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''γ&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} are [[Dirac matrices]], &lt;math&gt;\bar\psi = \psi^\dagger\gamma^0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electromagnetic field strength]]. The parameters in this theory are the (bare) electron mass {{math|''m''}} and the (bare) [[elementary charge]] {{math|''e''}}. The first and second terms in the Lagrangian density correspond to the free Dirac field and free vector fields, respectively. The last term describes the interaction between the electron and photon fields, which is treated as a perturbation from the free theories.{{r|peskin|page1=78}}

[[File:ElectronPositronAnnihilation.svg|250px]]

Shown above is an example of a tree-level Feynman diagram in QED. It describes an electron and a positron annihilating, creating an [[off-shell]] photon, and then decaying into a new pair of electron and positron. Time runs from left to right. Arrows pointing forward in time represent the propagation of positrons, while those pointing backward in time represent the propagation of electrons. A wavy line represents the propagation of a photon. Each vertex in QED Feynman diagrams must have an incoming and an outgoing fermion (positron/electron) leg as well as a photon leg.

==== Gauge symmetry ====
{{Main|Gauge theory}}

If the following transformation to the fields is performed at every spacetime point {{math|''x''}} (a local transformation), then the QED Lagrangian remains unchanged, or invariant:
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) \to e^{i\alpha(x)}\psi(x),\quad A_\mu(x) \to A_\mu(x) + ie^{-1} e^{-i\alpha(x)}\partial_\mu e^{i\alpha(x)},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''α''(''x'')}} is any function of spacetime coordinates. If a theory's Lagrangian (or more precisely the [[action (physics)|action]]) is invariant under a certain local transformation, then the transformation is referred to as a [[gauge symmetry]] of the theory.{{r|peskin|page1=482–483}} Gauge symmetries form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] at every spacetime point. In the case of QED, the successive application of two different local symmetry transformations &lt;math&gt;e^{i\alpha(x)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^{i\alpha'(x)}&lt;/math&gt; is yet another symmetry transformation &lt;math&gt;e^{i[\alpha(x)+\alpha'(x)]}&lt;/math&gt;. For any {{math|''α''(''x'')}}, &lt;math&gt;e^{i\alpha(x)}&lt;/math&gt; is an element of the [[U(1)|{{math|U(1)}}]] group, thus QED is said to have {{math|U(1)}} gauge symmetry.{{r|peskin|page1=496}} The photon field {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} may be referred to as the {{math|U(1)}} [[gauge boson]].

{{math|U(1)}} is an [[Abelian group]], meaning that the result is the same regardless of the order in which its elements are applied. QFTs can also be built on [[non-Abelian group]]s, giving rise to [[Yang–Mills theory|non-Abelian gauge theories]] (also known as Yang–Mills theories).{{r|peskin|page1=489}} [[Quantum chromodynamics]], which describes the strong interaction, is a non-Abelian gauge theory with an [[special unitary group|{{math|SU(3)}}]] gauge symmetry. It contains three Dirac fields {{math|''ψ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''i'' {{=}} 1,2,3}} representing [[quark]] fields as well as eight vector fields {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;a,μ&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''a'' {{=}} 1,...,8}} representing [[gluon]] fields, which are the {{math|SU(3)}} gauge bosons.{{r|peskin|page1=547}} The QCD Lagrangian density is:{{r|peskin|page1=490-491}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = i\bar\psi^i \gamma^\mu (D_\mu)^{ij} \psi^j - \frac 14 F_{\mu\nu}^aF^{a,\mu\nu} - m\bar\psi^i \psi^i,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the gauge [[covariant derivative]]:
:&lt;math&gt;D_\mu = \partial_\mu - igA_\mu^a t^a,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''g''}} is the coupling constant, {{math|''t&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;''}} are the eight [[Lie algebra|generators]] of {{math|SU(3)}} in the [[fundamental representation]] ({{math|3×3}} matrices),
:&lt;math&gt;F_{\mu\nu}^a = \partial_\mu A_\nu^a - \partial_\nu A_\mu^a + gf^{abc}A_\mu^b A_\nu^c,&lt;/math&gt;
and {{math|''f&lt;sup&gt;abc&lt;/sup&gt;''}} are the [[structure constants]] of {{math|SU(3)}}. Repeated indices {{math|''i'',''j'',''a''}} are implicitly summed over following Einstein notation. This Lagrangian is invariant under the transformation:
:&lt;math&gt;\psi^i(x) \to U^{ij}(x)\psi^j(x),\quad A_\mu^a(x) t^a \to U(x)\left[A_\mu^a(x) t^a + ig^{-1} \partial_\mu\right]U^\dagger(x),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''U''(''x'')}} is an element of {{math|SU(3)}} at every spacetime point {{math|''x''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;U(x) = e^{i\alpha(x)^a t^a}.&lt;/math&gt;

The preceding discussion of symmetries is on the level of the Lagrangian. In other words, these are "classical" symmetries. After quantisation, some theories will no longer exhibit their classical symmetries, a phenomenon called [[anomaly (physics)|anomaly]]. For instance, in the path integral formulation, despite the invariance of the Lagrangian density &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}[\phi,\partial_\mu\phi]&lt;/math&gt; under a certain local transformation of the fields, the [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] &lt;math&gt;\int\mathcal D\phi&lt;/math&gt; of the path integral may change.{{r|zee|page1=243}} For a theory describing nature to be consistent, it must not contain any anomaly in its gauge symmetry. The Standard Model of elementary particles is a gauge theory based on the group {{math|SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)}}, in which all anomalies exactly cancel.{{r|peskin|page1=705-707}}

The theoretical foundation of [[general relativity]], the [[equivalence principle]], can also be understood as a form of gauge symmetry, making general relativity a gauge theory based on the [[Lorentz group]].&lt;ref&gt;Veltman, M. J. G. (1976). ''Methods in Field Theory, Proceedings of the Les Houches Summer School, Les Houches, France, 1975''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noether's theorem]] states that every continuous symmetry, ''i.e.'' the parameter in the symmetry transformation being continuous rather than discrete, leads to a corresponding [[conservation law]].{{r|peskin|zee|page1=17-18|page2=73}} For example, the {{math|U(1)}} symmetry of QED implies [[charge conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brading |first1=Katherine A. |date=March 2002 |title=Which symmetry? Noether, Weyl, and conservation of electric charge |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219801000338 |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=3–22 |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(01)00033-8 |bibcode=2002SHPMP..33....3B |citeseerx=10.1.1.569.106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauge transformations do not relate distinct quantum states. Rather, it relates two equivalent mathematical descriptions of the same quantum state. As an example, the photon field {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, being a [[four-vector]], has four apparent degrees of freedom, but the actual state of a photon is described by its two degrees of freedom corresponding to the [[photon polarization|polarisation]]. The remaining two degrees of freedom are said to be "redundant" — apparently different ways of writing {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} can be related to each other by a gauge transformation and in fact describe the same state of the photon field. In this sense, gauge invariance is not a "real" symmetry, but are a reflection of the "redundancy" of the chosen mathematical description.{{r|zee|page1=168}}

To account for the gauge redundancy in the path integral formulation, one must perform the so-called [[Faddeev–Popov ghost|Faddeev–Popov]] [[gauge fixing]] procedure. In non-Abelian gauge theories, such a procedure introduces new fields called "ghosts". Particles corresponding to the ghost fields are called ghost particles, which cannot be detected externally.{{r|peskin|page1=512-515}} A more rigorous generalisation of the Faddeev–Popov procedure is given by [[BRST quantization]].{{r|peskin|page1=517}}

==== Spontaneous symmetry breaking ====
{{Main|Spontaneous symmetry breaking}}

[[Spontaneous symmetry breaking]] is a mechanism whereby the symmetry of the Lagrangian is violated by the system described by it.{{r|peskin|page1=347}}

To illustrate the mechanism, consider a linear [[sigma model]] containing {{math|''N''}} real scalar fields, described by the Lagrangian density:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \frac 12 (\partial_\mu\phi^i)(\partial^\mu\phi^i) + \frac 12 \mu^2 \phi^i\phi^i - \frac{\lambda}{4} (\phi^i\phi^i)^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''μ''}} and {{math|''λ''}} are real parameters. The theory admits an [[orthogonal group|{{math|O(''N'')}}]] gauge symmetry:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi^i \to R^{ij}\phi^j,\quad R\in\mathrm{O}(N).&lt;/math&gt;
The lowest energy state (ground state or vacuum state) of the classical theory is any uniform field {{math|''ϕ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} satisfying
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_0^i \phi_0^i = \frac{\mu^2}{\lambda}.&lt;/math&gt;
Without loss of generality, let the ground state be in the {{math|''N''}}-th direction:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_0^i = \left(0,\cdots,0,\frac{\mu}{\sqrt{\lambda}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The original {{math|''N''}} fields can be rewritten as:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi^i(x) = \left(\pi^1(x),\cdots,\pi^{N-1}(x),\frac{\mu}{\sqrt{\lambda}} + \sigma(x)\right),&lt;/math&gt;
and the original Lagrangian density as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \frac 12 (\partial_\mu\pi^k)(\partial^\mu\pi^k) + \frac 12 (\partial_\mu\sigma)(\partial^\mu\sigma) - \frac 12 (2\mu^2)\sigma^2 - \sqrt{\lambda}\mu\sigma^3 - \sqrt{\lambda}\mu\pi^k\pi^k\sigma - \frac{\lambda}{2} \pi^k\pi^k\sigma^2 - \frac{\lambda}{4}(\pi^k\pi^k)^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''k'' {{=}} 1,...,''N''-1}}. The original {{math|O(''N'')}} gauge symmetry is no longer manifest, leaving only the [[subgroup]] {{math|O(''N''-1)}}. The larger symmetry before spontaneous symmetry breaking is said to be "hidden" or spontaneously broken.{{r|peskin|page1=349-350}}

In the QFT of [[ferromagnetism]], spontaneous symmetry breaking can explain the alignment of [[magnetic dipole]]s at low temperatures.{{r|zee|page1=199}} In the Standard Model of elementary particles, the [[W and Z bosons]], which would otherwise be massless as a result of gauge symmetry, acquire mass through spontaneous symmetry breaking of the [[Higgs boson]], a process called the [[Higgs mechanism]].{{r|peskin|page1=690}}

[[Goldstone's theorem]] states that under spontaneous symmetry breaking, every broken continuous symmetry corresponds to a massless field called the Goldstone boson. In the above example, {{math|O(''N'')}} has {{math|''N''(''N''-1)/2}} continuous symmetries (the dimension of its [[Lie algebra]]), while {{math|O(''N''-1)}} has {{math|(''N''-1)(''N''-2)/2}}. The number of broken symmetries is their difference, {{math|''N''-1}}, which corresponds to the {{math|''N''-1}} massless fields {{math|''π&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''}}.{{r|peskin|page1=351}}

==== Supersymmetry ====
{{Main|Supersymmetry}}

All experimentally known symmetries in nature relate [[boson]]s to bosons and [[fermion]]s to fermions. Theorists have hypothesised the existence of a type of symmetry, called [[supersymmetry]], that relates bosons and fermions.{{r|peskin|zee|page1=795|page2=443}}

The Standard Model obeys [[Poincaré group|Poincaré symmetry]], whose generators are spacetime [[translation (geometry)|translation]] {{math|''P&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} and [[Lorentz transformation]] {{math|''J&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.&lt;ref name="WeinbergQFT"&gt;{{cite book |last=Weinberg |first=Steven |date=1995 |title=The Quantum Theory of Fields |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-55001-7 |author-link=Steven Weinberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|58–60}} In addition to these generators, supersymmetry in (3+1)-dimensions includes additional generators {{math|''Q&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, called [[supercharge]]s, which themselves transform as [[Weyl fermion]]s.{{r|peskin|zee|page1=795|page2=444}} The symmetry group generated by all these generators is known as the [[super-Poincaré group]]. In general there can be more than one set of supersymmetry generators, {{math|''Q&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''I'' {{=}} 1, ..., ''N''}}, which generate the corresponding {{math|''N'' {{=}} 1}} supersymmetry, {{math|''N'' {{=}} 2}} supersymmetry, and so on.{{r|peskin|zee|page1=795|page2=450}} Supersymmetry can also be constructed in other dimensions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=de Wit |first1=Bernard |last2=Louis |first2=Jan |eprint=hep-th/9801132 |title=Supersymmetry and Dualities in various dimensions |date=1998-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably in (1+1) dimensions for its application in [[superstring theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Polchinski |first=Joseph |date=2005 |title=String Theory |volume=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-67228-3 |author-link=Joseph Polchinski }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lagrangian of a supersymmetric theory must be invariant under the action of the super-Poincaré group.{{r|zee|page1=448}} Examples of such theories include: [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]] (MSSM), [[N {{=}} 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory|{{math|''N'' {{=}} 4}} supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory]],{{r|zee|page1=450}} and superstring theory. In a supersymmetric theory, every fermion has a bosonic [[superpartner]] and vice versa.{{r|zee|page1=444}}

If supersymmetry is promoted to a local symmetry, then the resultant gauge theory is an extension of general relativity called [[supergravity]].&lt;ref name="NathArnowitt"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nath | first1 = P. | last2 = Arnowitt | first2 = R. | year = 1975 | title = Generalized Super-Gauge Symmetry as a New Framework for Unified Gauge Theories | url = | journal = Physics Letters B | volume = 56 | issue = 2| page = 177 | doi=10.1016/0370-2693(75)90297-x| bibcode = 1975PhLB...56..177N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supersymmetry is a potential solution to many current problems in physics. For example, the [[hierarchy problem]] of the Standard Model — why the mass of the Higgs boson is not radiatively corrected (under renormalisation) to a very high scale such as the [[Grand Unified Theory|grand unified scale]] or the [[Planck mass|Planck scale]] — can be resolved by relating the [[Higgs field]] and its superpartner, the [[Higgsino]]. Radiative corrections due to Higgs boson loops in Feynman diagrams are cancelled by corresponding Higgsino loops. Supersymmetry also offers answers to the grand unification of all gauge coupling constants in the Standard Model as well as the nature of [[dark matter]].{{r|peskin|page1=796-797}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Munoz |first=Carlos |arxiv=1701.05259 |title=Models of Supersymmetry for Dark Matter |journal=European Physical Journal Web of Conferences |volume=136 |pages=01002 |date=2017-01-18 |bibcode=2017EPJWC.13601002M |doi=10.1051/epjconf/201713601002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, {{as of|2018|lc=y}}, experiments have yet to provide evidence for the existence of supersymmetric particles. If supersymmetry were a true symmetry of nature, then it must be a broken symmetry, and the energy of symmetry breaking must be higher than those achievable by present-day experiments.{{r|peskin|zee|page1=797|page2=443}}

==== Other spacetimes ====

The {{math|''ϕ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} theory, QED, QCD, as well as the whole Standard Model all assume a (3+1)-dimensional [[Minkowski space]] (3 spatial and 1 time dimensions) as the background on which the quantum fields are defined. However, QFT ''a priori'' imposes no restriction on the number of dimensions nor the geometry of spacetime.

In [[condensed matter physics]], QFT is used to describe [[two-dimensional electron gas|(2+1)-dimensional electron gases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morandi |first1=G. |last2=Sodano |first2=P. |last3=Tagliacozzo |first3=A. |last4=Tognetti |first4=V. |date=2000 |title=Field Theories for Low-Dimensional Condensed Matter Systems |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540671770 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-662-04273-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[high-energy physics]], [[string theory]] is a type of (1+1)-dimensional QFT,{{r|zee|page1=452}}&lt;ref name="polchinski1" /&gt; while [[Kaluza–Klein theory]] uses gravity in [[extra dimensions]] to produce gauge theories in lower dimensions.{{r|zee|page1=428-429}}

In Minkowski space, the flat [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] {{math|''η&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is used to [[raising and lowering indices|raise and lower]] spacetime indices in the Lagrangian, ''e.g.''
:&lt;math&gt;A_\mu A^\mu = \eta_{\mu\nu} A^\mu A^\nu,\quad \partial_\mu\phi \partial^\mu\phi = \eta^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi \partial_\nu\phi,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''η&lt;sup&gt;μν&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is the inverse of {{math|''η&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;''}} satisfying {{math|''η&lt;sup&gt;μρ&lt;/sup&gt;η&lt;sup&gt;ρν&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} ''δ&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. For [[quantum field theory in curved spacetime|QFTs in curved spacetime]] on the other hand, a general metric (such as the [[Schwarzschild metric]] describing a [[black hole]]) is used:
:&lt;math&gt;A_\mu A^\mu = g_{\mu\nu} A^\mu A^\nu,\quad \partial_\mu\phi \partial^\mu\phi = g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi \partial_\nu\phi,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''g&lt;sup&gt;μν&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is the inverse of {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. For a real scalar field, the Lagrangian density in a general spacetime background is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \sqrt{|g|}\left(\frac 12 g^{\mu\nu} \nabla_\mu\phi \nabla_\nu\phi - \frac 12 m^2\phi^2\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''g'' {{=}} det(''g&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, and {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} denotes the [[covariant derivative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parker |first1=Leonard E. |last2=Toms |first2=David J. |date=2009 |title=Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=43 |isbn=978-0-521-87787-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lagrangian of a QFT, hence its calculational results and physical predictions, depends on the geometry of the spacetime background.

==== Topological quantum field theory ====
{{Main|Topological quantum field theory}}

The correlation functions and physical predictions of a QFT depend on the spacetime metric {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. For a special class of QFTs called [[topological quantum field theories]] (TQFTs), all correlation functions are independent of continuous changes in the spacetime metric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Ivancevic |first1=Vladimir G. |last2=Ivancevic |first2=Tijana T. |eprint=0810.0344v5 |title=Undergraduate Lecture Notes in Topological Quantum Field Theory |class=math-th |date=2008-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36}} QFTs in curved spacetime generally change according to the ''geometry'' (local structure) of the spacetime background, while TQFTs are invariant under spacetime [[diffeomorphism]]s but are sensitive to the ''[[topology]]'' (global structure) of spacetime. This means that all calculational results of TQFTs are [[topological invariant]]s of the underlying spacetime. [[Chern–Simons theory]] is an example of TQFT. Applications of TQFT include the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] and [[topological quantum computer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Carqueville |first1=Nils |last2=Runkel |first2=Ingo |eprint=1705.05734 |title=Physics of Renormalization Group Equation in QED |class=math.QA |date=2017-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–5}}

=== Perturbative and non-perturbative methods ===

Using [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]], the total effect of a small interaction term can be approximated order by order by a series expansion in the number of [[virtual particle]]s participating in the interaction. Every term in the expansion may be understood as one possible way for (physical) particles to interact with each other via virtual particles, expressed visually using a [[Feynman diagram]]. The [[electromagnetic force]] between two electrons in QED is represented (to first order in perturbation theory) by the propagation of a virtual photon. In a similar manner, the [[W and Z bosons]] carry the weak interaction, while [[gluon]]s carry the strong interaction. The interpretation of an interaction as a sum of intermediate states involving the exchange of various virtual particles only makes sense in the framework of perturbation theory. In contrast, non-perturbative methods in QFT treat the interacting Lagrangian as a whole without any series expansion. Instead of particles that carry interactions, these methods have spawned such concepts as [['t Hooft–Polyakov monopole]], [[domain wall]], [[flux tube]], and [[instanton]].&lt;ref name="shifman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shifman |first=M. |authorlink=Mikhail Shifman |date=2012 |title=Advanced Topics in Quantum Field Theory |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-19084-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical rigour ==

In spite of its overwhelming success in particle physics and condensed matter physics, QFT itself lacks a formal mathematical foundation. For example, according to [[Haag's theorem]], there does not exist a well-defined [[interaction picture]] for QFT, which implies that [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] of QFT, which underlies the entire [[Feynman diagram]] method, is fundamentally not rigorous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haag |first=Rudolf |authorlink=Rudolf Haag |date=1955 |title=On Quantum Field Theories |url=http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/212242/files/p1.pdf |journal=Dan Mat Fys Medd |volume=29 |issue=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1950s,&lt;ref name="buchholz"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Buchholz |first=Detlev |authorlink=Detlev Buchholz |arxiv=hep-th/9811233v2 |title=Current Trends in Axiomatic Quantum Field Theory |journal=Quantum Field Theory |volume=558 |pages=43–64 |year=2000 |bibcode=2000LNP...558...43B }}&lt;/ref&gt; theoretical physicists and mathematicians have attempted to organise all QFTs into a set of [[axiom]]s, in order to establish the existence of concrete models of relativistic QFT in a mathematically rigorous way and to study their properties. This line of study is called [[constructive quantum field theory]], a subfield of [[mathematical physics]],&lt;ref name="summers"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Summers |first=Stephen J. |eprint=1203.3991v2 |title=A Perspective on Constructive Quantum Field Theory |class=math-ph |date=2016-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} which has led to such results as [[CPT theorem]], [[spin-statistics theorem]], and [[Goldstone's theorem]].&lt;ref name="buchholz" /&gt;

Compared to ordinary QFT, [[topological quantum field theory]] and [[conformal field theory]] are better supported mathematically — both can be classified in the framework of [[representation (mathematics)|representation]]s of [[cobordism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Sati |first1=Hisham |last2=Schreiber |first2=Urs |author-link2=Urs Schreiber |eprint=1109.0955v2 |title=Survey of mathematical foundations of QFT and perturbative string theory |class=math-ph |date=2012-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Algebraic quantum field theory]] is another approach to the axiomatisation of QFT, in which the fundamental objects are local operators and the algebraic relations between them. Axiomatic systems following this approach include [[Wightman axioms]] and [[Haag-Kastler axioms]].{{r|summers|page1=2-3}} One way to construct theories satisfying Wightman axioms is to use [[Osterwalder-Schrader axioms]], which give the necessary and sufficient conditions for a real time theory to be obtained from an [[imaginary time]] theory by [[analytic continuation]] ([[Wick rotation]]).{{r|summers|page1=10}}

[[Yang-Mills existence and mass gap]], one of the [[Millenium Prize Problems]], concerns the well-defined existence of [[Yang-Mills theory|Yang-Mills theories]] as set out by the above axioms. The full problem statement is as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/yangmills.pdf |title=Quantum Yang-Mills Theory |last1=Jaffe |first1=Arthur |last2=Witten |first2=Edward |author-link1=Arthur Jaffe |author-link2=Edward Witten |publisher=[[Clay Mathematics Institute]] |access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Cquote|
Prove that for any [[compact space|compact]] [[simple group|simple]] [[gauge group]] {{math|''G''}}, a non-trivial quantum Yang–Mills theory exists on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^4&lt;/math&gt; and has a [[mass gap]] {{math|Δ &gt; 0}}. Existence includes establishing axiomatic properties at least as strong as those cited in {{Harvtxt|Streater|Wightman|1964}}, {{Harvtxt|Osterwalder|Schrader|1973}} and {{Harvtxt|Osterwalder|Schrader|1975}}.

Such graphs are excellent [[expander graph|spectral expanders]].

Examples of Ramanujan graphs include the [[clique (graph theory)|clique]], the [[biclique]] &lt;math&gt;K_{n,n}&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[Petersen graph]].  As [http://www.mast.queensu.ca/~murty/ramanujan.pdf Murty's survey paper] notes, Ramanujan graphs "fuse diverse branches of pure mathematics, namely, [[number theory]], [[representation theory]], and [[algebraic geometry]]". As observed by [[Toshikazu Sunada]], a regular graph is Ramanujan if and only if its [[Ihara zeta function]] satisfies an analog of the [[Riemann hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Definition==

Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a connected &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-regular graph with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices, and let &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0 \geq \lambda_1 \geq \cdots \geq \lambda_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[eigenvalues]] of the [[adjacency matrix]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.  Because &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is connected and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-regular, its eigenvalues satisfy &lt;math&gt;d = \lambda_0 &gt; \lambda_1 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \geq \cdots \geq \lambda_{n-1} \geq -d &lt;/math&gt;.  Whenever there exists &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|\lambda_i| &lt; d&lt;/math&gt;, define

: &lt;math&gt;\lambda(G) = \max_{|\lambda_i| &lt; d} |\lambda_i|.\,&lt;/math&gt;

A &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-regular graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a Ramanujan graph if &lt;math&gt;\lambda(G) \leq 2\sqrt{d-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

A Ramanujan graph is characterized as a regular graph whose [[Ihara zeta function]] satisfies an analogue of the [[Riemann Hypothesis]].

==Extremality of Ramanujan graphs==
For a fixed &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-regular, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-vertex Ramanujan graphs nearly minimize &lt;math&gt;\lambda(G)&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-regular graph with [[Diameter (graph theory)|diameter]] &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, a theorem due to [[Noga Alon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

: &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 \geq 2\sqrt{d-1} - \frac{2\sqrt{d-1} - 1}{\lfloor m/2\rfloor}.&lt;/math&gt;

Whenever &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-regular and connected on at least three vertices, &lt;math&gt;|\lambda_1| &lt; d&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore &lt;math&gt;\lambda(G) \geq \lambda_1&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_n^d&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all connected &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-regular graphs &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with at least &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices.  Because the minimum diameter of graphs in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_n^d&lt;/math&gt; approaches infinity for fixed &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and increasing &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, this theorem implies an earlier theorem of Alon and Boppana which states

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} \inf_{G \in \mathcal{G}_n^d} \lambda(G) \geq 2\sqrt{d-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

A slightly stronger bound is

: &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 \geq 2\sqrt{d-1} \cdot \left(1-\frac{c}{m^2}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c\approx 2\pi^2&lt;/math&gt;. The outline of Friedman's proof is the following. Take &lt;math&gt;k=\left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor-1&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;T_{d,k}&lt;/math&gt; be the &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-regular tree of height &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;A_{T_k}&lt;/math&gt; be its adjacency matrix. We want to prove that &lt;math&gt;\lambda(G)\geq \lambda(T_{d,k})=2\sqrt{d-1}\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;, for some &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; depending only on &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. Define a function &lt;math&gt;g:V(T_{d,k})\rightarrow \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;g(x)=(d-1)^{-\delta/2}\cdot \sin((k+1-\delta)\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to the root of &lt;math&gt;T_{d,k}&lt;/math&gt;. Choosing a &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; close to &lt;math&gt;2\pi/m&lt;/math&gt; it can be proved that &lt;math&gt;A_{t,k}g=\lambda(T_{d,k})g&lt;/math&gt;. Now let &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; be a pair of vertices at distance &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and define

: &lt;math&gt;f(v)=\begin{cases} c_1 g(v_s) &amp; \text{for } v \text{ at distance } \leq k \text{ from } s, \\
-c_2 g(v_t) &amp; \text{for } v \text{ at distance } \leq k\text{ from } t, \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise,}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v_s&lt;/math&gt; is a vertex in &lt;math&gt;T_{d,k}&lt;/math&gt; which distance to the root is equal to the distance from &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and the symmetric for &lt;math&gt;v_t&lt;/math&gt;. By choosing properly &lt;math&gt;c_1,c_2&lt;/math&gt; we get &lt;math&gt;f\perp 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(Af)_v\geq \lambda(T_{d,k})f_v&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; close to &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(Af)_v\leq \lambda(T_{d,k})f_v&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; close to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Then by the [[min-max theorem]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda(G)\geq fAf^T/\|f\|^2\geq \lambda(T_{d,k})&lt;/math&gt;.

==Constructions==
Constructions of Ramanujan graphs are often algebraic.

* [[Alexander Lubotzky|Lubotzky]], [[Ralph S. Phillips|Phillips]] and [[Peter Sarnak|Sarnak]]&lt;ref name=lps88&gt;{{cite journal | author=Alexander Lubotzky |author2=Ralph Phillips |author3=Peter Sarnak  | title=Ramanujan graphs | journal=Combinatorica | volume=8 | year=1988 | pages=261–277 | doi=10.1007/BF02126799 | issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; show how to construct an infinite family of &lt;math&gt;(p+1)&lt;/math&gt;-regular Ramanujan graphs, whenever &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a [[prime number]] and &lt;math&gt;p\equiv 1 \pmod 4&lt;/math&gt;. Their proof uses the [[Ramanujan conjecture]], which led to the name of Ramanujan graphs. Besides being Ramanujan graphs, their construction satisfies some other properties, for example, their [[girth (graph theory)|girth]] is &lt;math&gt;\Omega(\log_{p}(n))&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of nodes.

His extended construction holds whenever &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a [[prime power]].

The [[numeric system]] represented by '''Roman numerals''' originated in [[ancient Rome]] and remained the usual way of writing numbers throughout Europe well into the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Numbers in this system are represented by combinations of letters from the [[Latin alphabet]]. Roman numerals, as used today, employ seven symbols, each with a fixed integer value, as follows:&lt;ref name="gordon"&gt;{{cite book

The use of Roman numerals continued long after the decline of the [[Roman Empire]]. From the 14th century on, Roman numerals began to be replaced in most contexts by the more convenient [[Arabic numerals]]; however, this process was gradual, and the use of Roman numerals persists in some minor applications to this day.

== Roman numeric system ==
=== Basic decimal pattern ===
The original pattern for Roman numerals used the symbols I, V, and X (1, 5, and 10) as simple tally marks. Each marker for 1 ({{rn|I}}) added a unit value up to 5 ({{rn|V}}), and was then added to ({{rn|V}}) to make the numbers from 6 to 9:

:::'''{{rn|I, II, III, IIII, V, VI, VII, VIII, VIIII, X}}'''.
The numerals for 4 ({{rn|IIII}}) and 9 ({{rn|VIIII}}) proved problematic (among other things, they are easily confused with {{rn|III}} and {{rn|VIII}}), and are generally replaced with {{rn|IV}} (one less than 5) and {{rn|IX}} (one less than 10). This feature of Roman numerals is called [[subtractive notation]].

The numbers from 1 to 10 (including subtractive notation for 4 and 9) are expressed in Roman numerals as follows:

:::'''{{rn|I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X}}'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| isbn      = 978-0-203-49534-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The system being basically decimal, ''tens and hundreds follow the same pattern'':

Thus 10 to 100 (counting in tens, with {{rn|X}} taking the place of {{rn|I}}, {{rn|L}} taking the place of {{rn|V}} and  {{rn|C}} taking the place of {{rn|X}}):

:::'''{{rn|X, XX, XXX, XL, L, LX, LXX, LXXX, XC, C}}'''.
Note that 40 ({{rn|XL}}) and 90 ({{rn|XC}}) follow the same subtractive pattern as 4 and 9.

Similarly, 100 to 1000 (counting in hundreds):

:::'''{{rn|C, CC, CCC, CD, D, DC, DCC, DCCC, CM, M}}'''.
Again - 400 ({{rn|CD}}) and 900 ({{rn|CM}}) follow the standard subtractive pattern.

In the absence of a standard symbols for 5,000 and 10,000 the pattern breaks down at this point - in modern usage {{rn|M}} is repeated up to three times. The Romans had several different methods for indicating larger numbers, but for practical purposes Roman Numerals for numbers larger than 3,000 are seldom if ever used nowadays, and this suffices.

:::'''{{rn|M, MM, MMM}}'''.

Many numbers include hundreds, units and tens. The Roman numeral system being basically decimal, each power of ten is added in descending sequence from left to right, as with Arabic numerals. For example:

*39 = "Thirty nine" (XXX+IX) = '''{{rn|XXXIX}}'''.
*246 = "Two hundred and forty six" (CC+XL+VI) = '''{{rn|CCXLVI}}'''.
*421 = "Four hundred and twenty one" (CD+XX+I) = '''{{rn|CDXXI}}'''.

As each power of ten (or "place") has its own notation there is no need for place keeping zeros, so "missing places" are ignored, as in Latin (and English) speech, thus:

*160 = "One hundred and sixty" (C+LX) = '''{{rn|CLX}}''' 
*207 = "Two hundred and seven" (CC+VII) =  '''{{rn|CCVII}}''' 
*1066 = "A thousand and sixty six" (M+LX+VI) = '''{{rn|MLXVI}}'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Roman numerals for large numbers are nowadays seen mainly in the form of year numbers (other uses are detailed later in this article), as in these examples:

* 2014 (MM+X+IV) = '''{{rn|MMXIV}}''' (the year of the games of the {{rn|XXII}} (22nd) [[Winter Olympic Games|Olympic Winter Games]] (in [[2014 Winter Olympics|Sochi]])
* The current year ({{CURRENTYEAR}}) is '''{{rn|{{#time:xrY}}}}'''.

=== Alternative forms ===
The "standard" forms described above reflect typical modern usage rather than an unchanging and universally accepted convention. Usage in ancient Rome varied greatly and remained inconsistent in medieval times. There is still no official "binding" standard, which makes the elaborate "rules" used in some sources to distinguish between "correct" and "incorrect" forms highly problematic&lt;ref name = adams&gt;{{cite web

* "Classical" inscriptions (those dating dating from the Roman period) not infrequently use {{rn|IIII}} for "4" instead of {{rn|IV}}. Other "additive" forms, such as {{rn|VIIII}} for {{rn|IX}}, are also sometimes seen, although they are rarer. On the numbered gates to the [[colosseum]], for instance, {{rn|IV}} is systematically avoided in favour of {{rn|IIII}}, but other "subtractives" apply, so that gate 44 is labelled {{rn|XLIIII}} and gate 49 has {{rn|XLIX}}.

* [[Clock face]]s that use Roman numerals normally show {{rn|IIII}} for four o'clock but {{rn|IX}} for nine o'clock, a practice that goes back to very early clocks such as the [[Wells Cathedral clock]] of the late 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

* Most non-standard numerals other than those described above - such as {{rn|VXL}} for 45, instead of the standard {{rn|XLV}} are modern and may be due to error rather than being genuine variant usage. In the early years of the 20th century, different representations of 900 (conventionally {{rn|CM}}) appeared in several inscribed dates. For instance, 1910 is shown on [[Admiralty Arch]], London, as {{rn|MDCCCCX}} rather than {{rn|MCMX}}, while on the north entrance to the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]], 1903 is inscribed as {{rn|MDCDIII}} rather than {{rn|MCMIII}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== History ==

=== Pre-Roman times and ancient Rome ===
Although Roman numerals came to be written with letters of the Roman alphabet, they were originally independent symbols. The [[Etruscans]], for example, used {{rn|𐌠}}, {{rn|𐌡}}, {{rn|𐌢}}, {{rn|𐌣}}, {{rn|𐌚}}, and {{rn|⊕}} for {{rn|I}}, {{rn|V}}, {{rn|X}}, {{rn|L}}, {{rn|C}}, and {{rn|M}}, of which only {{rn|I}} and {{rn|X}} happened to be letters in their alphabet.

==== Hypotheses about the origin of Roman numerals ====

===== Tally marks =====
One hypothesis is that the Etrusco-Roman numerals actually derive from notches on [[tally stick]]s, which continued to be used by Italian and [[Dalmatia]]n shepherds into the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Ifrah2000"&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, {{angbr|{{rn|I}}}} descends not from the letter {{angbr|I}} but from a notch scored across the stick. Every fifth notch was double cut i.e. {{rn|⋀}}, {{rn|⋁}}, {{rn|⋋}}, {{rn|⋌}}, ''etc.''), and every tenth was cross cut ({{rn|X}}), {{rn|IIIIΛIIIIXIIIIΛIIIIXII...}}, much like European [[tally marks]] today. This produced a positional system: ''Eight'' on a counting stick was eight tallies, {{rn|IIIIΛIII}}, or the eighth of a longer series of tallies; either way, it could be abbreviated {{rn|ΛIII}} (or {{rn|VIII}}), as the existence of a {{rn|Λ}} implies four prior notches. By extension, ''eighteen'' was the eighth tally after the first ten, which could be abbreviated {{rn|X}}, and so was {{rn|XΛIII}}. Likewise, number ''four'' on the stick was the I-notch that could be felt just before the cut of the {{rn|Λ}} ({{rn|V}}), so it could be written as either {{rn|IIII}} or {{rn|IΛ}} ({{rn|IV}}). Thus the system was neither additive nor subtractive in its conception, but ''[[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal]]''. When the tallies were transferred to writing, the marks were easily identified with the existing Roman letters {{rn|I}}, {{rn|V}} and {{rn|X}}.
The tenth {{rn|V}} or {{rn|X}} along the stick received an extra stroke. Thus 50 was written variously as {{rn|N}}, {{rn|И}}, {{rn|K}}, {{rn|Ψ}}, {{rn|⋔}}, ''etc.'', but perhaps most often as a chicken-track shape like a superimposed {{rn|V}} and {{rn|I}}: {{rn|ᗐ}}. This had flattened to {{rn|⊥}} (an inverted T) by the time of [[Augustus]], and soon thereafter became identified with the graphically similar letter {{rn|L}}. Likewise, 100 was variously {{rn|Ж}}, {{rn|⋉}}, {{rn|⋈}}, {{rn|H}}, or as any of the symbols for 50 above plus an extra stroke. The form {{rn|Ж}} (that is, a superimposed {{rn|X}} and {{rn|I}}) came to predominate. It was written variously as {{rn|&gt;I&lt;}} or {{rn|ƆIC}}, was then abbreviated to {{rn|Ɔ}} or {{rn|C}}, with {{rn|C}} variant finally winning out because, as a letter, it stood for ''centum'', Latin for "hundred".

The hundredth {{rn|V}} or {{rn|X}} was marked with a box or circle. Thus 500 was like a {{rn|Ɔ}} superimposed on a {{rn|⋌}} or {{rn|⊢}} — that is, like a {{angbr|Þ}} with a cross bar,— becoming {{rn|&lt;s&gt;D&lt;/s&gt;}} or {{rn|Ð}} by the time of Augustus, under the graphic influence of the letter {{angbr|D}}. It was later identified ''as'' the letter D; an alternative symbol for "thousand" was a bracketed {{rn|(I)}} (or {{rn|CIƆ}}), and half of a thousand or "five hundred" is the right half of the symbol, {{rn|I)}} (or {{rn|IƆ}}), and this may have been converted into {{angbr|D}}.&lt;ref name="asimov on numbers"&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This at least was the etymology given to it later on.

Meanwhile, 1000 was a circled or boxed {{rn|X}}: {{rn|Ⓧ}}, {{rn|⊗}}, {{rn|⊕}}, and by Augustinian times was partially identified with the Greek letter {{rn|Φ}} ''[[phi]]''.  Over time, the symbol changed to {{rn|Ψ}} and {{rn|ↀ}}.  The latter symbol further evolved into {{rn|∞}}, then {{rn|⋈}}, and eventually changed to {{rn|M}} under the influence of the Latin word ''mille'' "thousand".

===== Hand signals =====
Alfred Hooper has an alternative hypothesis for the origin of the Roman numeral system, for small numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Hooper. ''The River Mathematics'' (New York, H. Holt, 1945).&lt;/ref&gt; Hooper contends that the digits are related to hand [[gestures for counting]]. For example, the numbers {{rn|I}}, {{rn|II}}, {{rn|III}}, {{rn|IIII}} correspond to the number of fingers held up for another to see. {{rn|V}}, then represents that hand upright with fingers together and thumb apart. Numbers 6–10, are represented with two hands as follows (left hand, right hand) 6=({{rn|V}},{{rn|I}}), 7=({{rn|V}},{{rn|II}}), 8=({{rn|V}},{{rn|III}}), 9=({{rn|V}},{{rn|IIII}}), 10=({{rn|V}},{{rn|V}}) and {{rn|X}} results from either crossing of the thumbs, or holding both hands up in a cross.

Another possibility is that each {{rn|I}} represents a finger and {{rn|V}} represents the thumb of one hand. This way the numbers between 1–10 can be counted on one hand using the order: {{rn|I}}=P, {{rn|II}}=PR, {{rn|III}}=PRM, {{rn|IV}}=IT, {{rn|V}}=T, {{rn|VI}}=TP, {{rn|VII}}=TPR, {{rn|VIII}}=TPRM, {{rn|IX}}=IN, {{rn|X}}=N (P=pinky, R=ring, M=middle, I=index, T=thumb N=no fingers/other hand). This pattern can also be continued using the other hand with the fingers representing {{rn|X}} and the thumb {{rn|L}}.

===== Intermediate symbols deriving from few original symbols =====
A third hypothesis about the origins states that the basic ciphers were {{rn|I}}, {{rn|X}}, {{rn|C}} and {{rn|Φ}} (or {{rn|⊕}}) and that the intermediary ones were derived from taking half of those (half an {{rn|X}} is {{rn|V}}, half a {{rn|C}} is {{rn|L}} and half a {{rn|Φ/⊕}} is {{rn|D}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===
[[Lower case]], minuscule, letters were developed in the Middle Ages, well after the demise of the [[Western Roman Empire]], and since that time lower-case versions of Roman numbers have also been commonly used: {{rn|i}}, {{rn|ii}}, {{rn|iii}}, {{rn|iv}}, and so on.

Since the Middle Ages, a "{{rn|j}}" has sometimes been substituted for the final "{{rn|i}}" of a "lower-case" Roman numeral, such as "{{rn|iij}}" for 3 or "{{rn|vij}}" for 7. This "{{rn|j}}" can be considered a [[Swash (typography)|swash]] variant of "{{rn|i}}". The use of a final "{{rn|j}}" is still used in [[medical prescription]]s to prevent tampering with or misinterpretation of a number after it is written.&lt;ref&gt;Sturmer, Julius W. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-uHqQSWSPdwC&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Course in Pharmaceutical and Chemical Arithmetic, 3rd ed. (LaFayette, IN: Burt-Terry-Wilson, 1906). p25].

(Philadelphia, PA: W.B. Saunders, 1919) p582]. Retrieved 15 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerals in documents and inscriptions from the Middle Ages sometimes include additional symbols, which today are called "medieval Roman numerals". Some simply substitute another letter for the standard one (such as "{{rn|A}}" for "{{rn|V}}", or "{{rn|Q}}" for "{{rn|D}}"), while others serve as abbreviations for compound numerals ("{{rn|O}}" for "{{rn|XI}}", or "{{rn|F}}" for "{{rn|XL}}"). Although they are still listed today in some dictionaries, they are long out of use.&lt;ref&gt;Capelli, A. ''Dictionary of Latin Abbreviations''. 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chronogram]]s, messages with dates encoded into them, were popular during the [[Renaissance]] era.  The chronogram would be a phrase containing the letters {{rn|I}}, {{rn|V}}, {{rn|X}}, {{rn|L}}, {{rn|C}}, {{rn|D}}, and {{rn|M}}.  By putting these letters together, the reader would obtain a number, usually indicating a particular year.

=== Modern use ===
By the 11th century, Arabic numerals had been introduced into Europe from [[al-Andalus]], by way of [[Arab]] traders and arithmetic treatises. Roman numerals, however, proved very persistent, remaining in common use in the West well into the 14th and 15th centuries, even in accounting and other business records (where the actual calculations would have been made using an [[abacus]]). Replacement by their more convenient "Arabic" equivalents was quite gradual, and Roman numerals are still used today in certain contexts. A few examples of their current use are:

[[File:Carlos IV Coin.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.65|Spanish Real using "IIII" instead of "IV" as regnal number of Charles IV of Spain]]
* Names of monarchs and popes, e.g. [[Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom, [[Pope Benedict XVI]]. These are referred to as [[regnal number]]s and are usually read as [[Ordinal numbers (linguistics)|ordinals]]; e.g. {{rn|II}} is pronounced "the second". This tradition began in Europe sporadically in the [[Middle Ages]], gaining widespread use in England during the reign of [[Henry VIII]]. Previously, the monarch was not known by numeral but by an [[epithet]] such as [[Edward the Confessor]]. Some monarchs (e.g. [[Charles IV of Spain]] and [[Louis XIV of France]]) seem to have preferred the use of {{rn|IIII}} instead of {{rn|IV}} on their coinage (see illustration).
* [[Suffix (name)#Generational titles|Generational suffixes]], particularly in the US, for people sharing the same name across generations, for example [[William Howard Taft IV]].
* In the [[French Republican Calendar#Converting from the Gregorian Calendar|French Republican Calendar]], initiated during the [[French Revolution]], years were numbered by Roman numerals – from the year I (1792) when this calendar was introduced to the year XIV (1805) when it was abandoned.
* The year of production of films, television shows and other works of art within the work itself. It has been suggested – by [[BBC News]], perhaps facetiously – that this was originally done "in an attempt to disguise the age of films or television programmes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* Hour marks on [[timepiece]]s. In this context, 4 is often written {{rn|IIII}}.
* The year of construction on [[building face]]s and [[cornerstone]]s.
* Page numbering of prefaces and introductions of books, and sometimes of appendices and annexes, too.
* Book volume and chapter numbers, as well as the several acts within a play (e.g. Act iii, Scene 2).
* [[Sequel]]s to some films, video games, and other works (as in ''[[Rocky II]]'').
* [[Outline (summary)|Outlines]] that use numbers to show hierarchical relationships.
* Occurrences of a recurring grand event, for instance:

[[File:Colosseum-Entrance LII.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Entrance to section {{rn|LII}} (52) of the [[Colosseum]], with numerals still visible]]

In [[astronomy]], the [[natural satellite]]s or "moons" of the [[planet]]s are traditionally [[Naming of moons#Roman numeral designations|designated]] by capital Roman numerals appended to the planet's name. For example, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]'s designation is [[Saturn]]&amp;nbsp;{{rn|VI}}.

In [[chemistry]], Roman numerals are often used to denote the [[group (periodic table)|groups]] of the [[periodic table]].
They are also used in the [[IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry]], for the [[oxidation number]] of [[cation]]s which can take on several different positive charges. They are also used for naming [[Phase (matter)|phases]] of [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphic]] [[crystal]]s, such as [[ice]].

In [[education]], school grades (in the sense of year-groups rather than test scores) are sometimes referred to by a Roman numeral; for example, "grade IX" is sometimes seen for "grade 9".

In [[entomology]], the broods of the thirteen and seventeen year [[periodical cicadas]] are identified by Roman numerals.

In advanced [[mathematics]] (including [[trigonometry]], [[statistics]], and [[calculus]]), when a graph includes negative numbers, its quadrants are named using {{rn|I}}, {{rn|II}}, {{rn|III}}, and {{rn|IV}}. These quadrant names signify positive numbers on both axes, negative numbers on the X axis, negative numbers on both axes, and negative numbers on the Y axis, respectively. The use of Roman numerals to designate quadrants avoids confusion, since Arabic numerals are used for the actual data represented in the graph.

In [[military]] unit designation, Roman numerals are often used to distinguish between units at different levels. This reduces possible confusion, especially when viewing operational or strategic level maps. In particular, army corps are often numbered using Roman numerals (for example the American XVIII Airborne Corps or the WW2-era German III Panzerkorps) with Arabic numerals being used for divisions and armies.

In [[music]], Roman numerals are used in several contexts:
* [[movement (music)|Movements]] are often numbered using Roman numerals.
* In [[music theory]], the [[diatonic function]]s are identified using Roman numerals. (See: [[Roman numeral analysis]])
* Individual strings of [[stringed instruments]], such as the [[violin]], are often denoted by Roman numerals, with higher numbers denoting lower strings.

In [[pharmacy]], Roman numerals are used in some contexts, including {{rn|S}} to denote "one half" and {{rn|N}} to mean "nothing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In [[photography]], Roman numerals (with zero) are used to denote varying levels of brightness when using the [[Zone System]].

In [[seismology]], Roman numerals are used to designate degrees of the [[Mercalli intensity scale]] of earthquakes.

In [[team sport|sport]] the team containing the "top" players and representing a [[Nation or province, a sports club|club]] or a school at the highest level in (say) [[rugby union]] is often called the "1st XV", while a [[cricket]] or [[American football]] team for younger or less experienced players might be the "3rd XI".

In [[tarot]], Roman numerals (with zero) are used to denote the cards of the [[Major Arcana]].

In [[theology]] and [[biblical scholarship]], the [[Septuagint]] is often referred to as ''{{rn|LXX}}'', as this translation of the [[Old Testament]] into Greek is named for the legendary number of its translators (''septuaginta'' being Latin for "seventy").

==== Modern use in continental Europe ====
Some uses that are rare or never seen in English speaking countries may be relatively common in parts of [[continental Europe]]. For instance:

Capital or small capital Roman numerals are widely used in [[Romance languages]] to denote {{strong|centuries}}, e.g. the French ''{{lang|fr|{{Smallcaps|xviii}}&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}} ''On composera en chiffres romains petites capitales les nombres concernant : ↲ 1. Les siècles.''&lt;/ref&gt; and the Spanish ''{{lang|es|siglo XVIII}}'' mean "18th century". Slavic languages in and adjacent to Russia similarly favour Roman numerals ({{lang|ru|XVIII век}}). On the other hand, in Slavic languages in [[Central Europe]], like most [[Germanic languages]], one writes "18." (with a period) before the local word for "century".

Mixed Roman and Arabic numerals are sometimes used in numeric representations of dates (especially in formal letters and official documents, but also on tombstones). The {{strong|month}} is written in Roman numerals, while the day is in Arabic numerals: "14.{{rn|VI}}.1789" and "{{rn|VI}}.14.1789" both refer unambiguously to 14 June 1789.

[[File:DarboLaikas.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Business hours table on a shop window in [[Vilnius]]]]

Retrieved 1 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and also sometimes in railway and bus timetables. Monday, taken as the first day of the week, is represented by {{rn|I}}. Sunday is represented by {{rn|VII}}. The hours of operation signs are tables composed of two columns where the left column is the day of the week in Roman numerals and the right column is a range of hours of operation from starting time to closing time. In the example case (left), the business opens from 10&amp;nbsp;am to 7&amp;nbsp;pm on weekdays, 10&amp;nbsp;AM to 5&amp;nbsp;pm on Saturdays and is [[Sunday shopping|closed on Sundays]].

In Italy, where roads outside built-up areas have [[Milestone|kilometre signs]], major roads and motorways also mark 100-metre subdivisionals, using Roman numerals from {{rn|I}} to {{rn|IX}} for the smaller intervals. The sign "{{rn|IX}} | 17" thus marks kilometre 17.9.

A notable exception to the use of Roman numerals in Europe is in Greece, where [[Greek numerals]] (based on the Greek alphabet) are generally used in contexts where Roman numerals would be used elsewhere.

== Special values ==

=== Zero ===
The number [[0 (number)|zero]] does not have its own Roman numeral, but the word ''nulla'' (the [[Latin]] word meaning "none") was used by medieval scholars in lieu of 0. [[Dionysius Exiguus]] was known to use ''nulla'' alongside Roman numerals in 525.&lt;ref&gt;Faith Wallis, trans. ''Bede: The Reckoning of Time'' (725), Liverpool, Liverpool Univ. Pr., 2004. {{isbn|0-85323-693-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Byrhtferth's Enchiridion'' (1016). Edited by Peter S. Baker and Michael Lapidge. Early English Text Society 1995. {{isbn|978-0-19-722416-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; About 725, [[Bede]] or one of his colleagues used the letter N, the initial of ''nulla'' or of ''nihil'' (the Latin word for "nothing"), in a table of [[epacts]], all written in Roman numerals.&lt;ref name=zero&gt;C. W. Jones, ed., ''Opera Didascalica'', vol. 123C in ''Corpus Christianorum, Series Latina''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fractions ===
[[File:Vecchi 003.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|A {{lang|la|[[triens]]}} coin (1/3 or 4/12 of an {{lang|la|as}}). Note the four dots •••• indicating its value.]]
[[File:Semisse.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A {{lang|la|[[semis]]}} coin (1/2 or 6/12 of an {{lang|la|as}}). Note the S indicating its value.]]

Though the Romans used a [[decimal]] system for whole numbers, reflecting how they counted in Latin, they used a [[duodecimal]] system for [[rational number|fractions]], because the [[divisibility]] of twelve {{nowrap|1= (12 = 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 3)}} makes it easier to handle the common [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] of 1/3 and 1/4 than does a system based on ten {{nowrap|1= (10 = 2 × 5).}} On [[coin]]s, many of which had values that were [[duodecimal]] fractions of the unit {{lang|la|[[As (coin)|as]]}}, they used a tally-like notational system based on twelfths and halves. A dot (•) indicated an {{lang|la|uncia}} "twelfth", the source of the English words ''inch'' and ''ounce''; dots were repeated for fractions up to five twelfths. Six twelfths (one half) was abbreviated as the letter ''S'' for {{lang|la|semis}} "half". ''Uncia'' dots were added to ''S'' for fractions from seven to eleven twelfths, just as tallies were added to {{rn|V}} for whole numbers from six to nine.&lt;ref&gt;Maher, David W.; Makowski, John F., "[http://dmaher.org/Publications/romanarithmetic.pdf Literary Evidence for Roman Arithmetic with Fractions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827220707/http://dmaher.org/Publications/romanarithmetic.pdf |date=August 27, 2013 }}", ''Classical Philology'' '''96''' (2011): 376–399.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each fraction from 1/12 to 12/12 had a name in Roman times; these corresponded to the names of the related coins:

The arrangement of the dots was variable and not necessarily [[Linearity|linear]]. Five dots arranged like (⁙) (as on the face of a [[dice|die]]) are known as a [[quincunx]], from the name of the Roman fraction/coin. The Latin words ''{{lang|la|sextans}}'' and ''{{lang|la|quadrans}}'' are the source of the English words ''[[sextant]]'' and ''[[Quadrant (plane geometry)|quadrant]]''.

Other Roman fractional notations included the following:
* 1/8 {{lang|la|sescuncia, sescunciae}} (from ''[[Numeral prefix|sesqui]]-'' + ''uncia'', i.e. 1½ uncias), represented by a sequence of the symbols for the semuncia and the uncia.
* 1/24 {{lang|la|semuncia, semunciae}} (from ''semi-'' + ''uncia'', i.e. ½ uncia), represented by several variant glyphs deriving from the shape of the Greek letter [[sigma]] (Σ), one variant resembling the [[pound sign]] without the horizontal line (𐆒) and another resembling the [[Ukrainian Ye|Cyrillic letter Є]].
* 1/36 {{lang|la|binae sextulae, binarum sextularum}} ("two sextulas") or {{lang|la|[[duella]], duellae}}, represented by a sequence of two reversed Ss (𐆓𐆓).
* 1/48 {{lang|la|sicilicus, sicilici}}, represented by a reversed C ({{rn|Ɔ}}).

=== Large numbers ===
A number of systems were developed for the expression of larger numbers that cannot be conveniently expressed using the normal seven letter symbols of conventional Roman numerals.

[[File:Westerkerk MDCXXX.jpg|thumb|right| "1630" on the [[Westerkerk]] in Amsterdam, with the date expressed in "apostrophus" notation.]]

==== Apostrophus ====
One of these was the ''apostrophus'',&lt;ref name = merriam-webster&gt;{{cite web
| title = Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary
| url   = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apostrophus
}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which 500 (usually written as "{{rn|D}}") was written as |{{rn|Ɔ}}, while 1,000, was written as {{rn|C}}|{{rn|Ɔ}} instead of "{{rn|M}}".&lt;ref name="asimov on numbers"/&gt; This is a system of encasing numbers to denote thousands (imagine the {{rn|C}}s and {{rn|Ɔ}}s as parentheses), which has its origins in Etruscan numeral usage. The {{rn|D}} and {{rn|M}} used to represent 500 and 1,000 were most likely derived from |{{rn|Ɔ}} and {{rn|C}}|{{rn|Ɔ}}, respectively, and subsequently influenced the adoptions of "{{rn|D}}" and "{{rn|M}}" in conventional Roman numerals.

In this system, an extra {{rn|Ɔ}} denoted 500, and multiple extra {{rn|Ɔ}}s are used to denote 5,000, 50,000, etc. For example:

{| class="wikitable Unicode"
|-
!Base number
|align=right|&amp;nbsp;
|align=right|{{rn|C}}|{{rn|Ɔ}} = 1,000
|align=right|{{rn|CC}}|{{rn|ƆƆ}} = 10,000
|align=right|{{rn|CCC}}|{{rn|ƆƆƆ}} = 100,000
|-
!1 extra Ɔ
|align=right|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{rn|Ɔ}} = 500
|align=right|{{rn|C}}|{{rn|ƆƆ}} = 1,500
|align=right|{{rn|CC}}|{{rn|ƆƆƆ}} = 10,500
|align=right|{{rn|CCC}}|{{rn|ƆƆƆƆ}} = 100,500
|-
!2 extra Ɔs
|align=right|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{rn|ƆƆ}} = 5,000
|align=right|&amp;nbsp;
|align=right|{{rn|CC}}|{{rn|ƆƆƆƆ}} = 15,000
|align=right|{{rn|CCC}}|{{rn|ƆƆƆƆƆ}} = 105,000
|-
!3 extra Ɔs
|align=right|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{rn|ƆƆƆ}} = 50,000
|align=right|&amp;nbsp;
|align=right|&amp;nbsp;
|align=right|{{rn|CCC}}|{{rn|ƆƆƆƆƆƆ}} = 150,000
|}

Sometimes {{rn|C}}|{{rn|Ɔ}} was reduced to ↀ for 1,000. [[John Wallis]] is often credited for introducing the symbol for [[infinity]] (modern ∞), and one conjecture is that he based it on this usage, since 1,000 was [[hyperbole|hyperbolically]] used to represent very large numbers. Similarly, |{{rn|ƆƆ}} for 5,000 was reduced to ↁ; {{rn|CC}}|{{rn|ƆƆ}} for 10,000 to ↂ; |{{rn|ƆƆƆ}} for 50,000 to ↇ; and {{rn|CCC}}|{{rn|ƆƆƆ}} for 100,000 to ↈ.&lt;ref name="Ifrah2000" /&gt;

[[File:Roman numerals Bungus 1584-1585.png|thumb|Page from a 16th-century manual, showing a mixture of apostrophus and vinculum numbers (see in particular the ways of writing 10,000).]]

==== Vinculum ====
Another system is the  ''[[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]]'', where a conventional Roman numeral is multiplied by 1,000 by adding an overline.&lt;ref name="Ifrah2000" /&gt; Although mathematical historian [[David Eugene Smith]] disputes that this was part of ancient Roman usage,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
| first    = David Eugene
| last     = Smith

| year     = 1958
| origyear = 1925
| isbn     = 0-486-20430-8
| page     = 60
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the notation was certainly in use in the Middle Ages, and is at least a convenient and "conventional" way to express numbers greater than 3,999 in Roman numerals.

For instance:
* {{rn|IV|border=t}} for 4,000
* {{rn|XXV|border=t}} for 25,000

Adding ''vertical'' lines (or brackets) before and after the numeral seems to have been used (at least by late medieval times) to multiply a Roman numeral by 10: thus {{rn|M|border=v}} for 10,000 rather than {{rn|X|border=t}}. In combination with the overline the bracketed forms might be used to raise the multiplier to (say) ten (or one hundred) thousand, thus:
* {{rn|VIII|border=vt}} for 80,000 (or 800,000)
* {{rn|XX|border=vt}} for 200,000 (or 2,000,000)

[[File:SectionI.JPG|right|thumb|Use of Roman numeral "{{rn|I}}" (with exaggerated serifs) contrasting with the upper case letter "I".]]
This needs to be distinguished from the custom of adding both underline and overline to a Roman numeral, simply to make it clear that it ''is'' a number, e.g. {{rn|MCMLXVII|border=h}}.

In [[convex geometry]], a '''spectrahedron''' is a shape that can be represented as a [[linear matrix inequality]]. Alternatively, the set of {{math|''n'' &amp;times; ''n''}} [[positive semidefinite matrix|positive semidefinite matrices]] forms a [[convex cone]] in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' &amp;times; ''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and a spectrahedron is a shape that can be formed by intersecting this cone with a [[linear affine subspace]].

Spectrahedra are the solution spaces of [[semidefinite programming|semidefinite programs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Motakuri|last1=Ramana|first2=A. J.|last2=Goldman|author2-link= Alan J. Goldman |title=Some geometric results in semidefinite programming|journal=Journal of Global Optimization|volume=7|issue=1|pages=33–50|year=1995|doi=10.1007/BF01100204}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Every spectrahedron is a [[convex set]] and also [[Semialgebraic set|semialgebraic]], but the reverse (conjectured to be true until 2017) is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheiderer|first=C.|date=2018-01-01|title=Spectrahedral Shadows|url=http://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/17M1118981|journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Algebra and Geometry|pages=26–44|doi=10.1137/17m1118981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a spectrahedron is the '''spectraplex''', defined as

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Spect}_n = \{ X \in \mathbf{S}^n_+ \mid \mathrm{Tr}(X) = 1\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}^n_+&lt;/math&gt;is the set of {{math|''n'' &amp;times; ''n''}} positive semidefinite matrices and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tr}(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the matrix &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Approximation Algorithms and Semidefinite Programming|last=Gärtner|first=Bernd|last2=Matousek|first2=Jiri|publisher=Springer Science and Business Media|year=2012|isbn=3642220150|location=|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spectraplex is a compact set, and can be thought of as the "semidefinite" analog of the [[simplex]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1994">In mathematical set theory, the global '''square principle''' is a combinatorial principle introduced by [[Ronald Jensen]] in his analysis of  the fine structure of the [[constructible universe]] '''L'''.

==Definition==
Define '''Sing''' to be the [[class (set theory)|class]] of all [[limit ordinal]]s which are not [[regular ordinal|regular]].  ''Global square'' states that there is a system &lt;math&gt;(C_\beta)_{\beta \in \mathrm{Sing}}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying:

# &lt;math&gt;C_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a [[club set]] of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.
# [[order type|ot]]&lt;math&gt;(C_\beta) &lt; \beta &lt;/math&gt;
# If &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a limit point of &lt;math&gt;C_\beta&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\gamma \in \mathrm{Sing}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_\gamma = C_\beta \cap \gamma&lt;/math&gt;

==Variant relative to a cardinal==
Jensen introduced also a local version of the principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Jech | first1=Thomas | author1-link=Thomas Jech | title=Set Theory: Third Millennium Edition | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Springer Monographs in Mathematics | isbn=978-3-540-44085-7 | year=2003}}, p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; If 
&lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is an uncountable cardinal, 
then &lt;math&gt;\Box_\kappa&lt;/math&gt; asserts that there is a sequence &lt;math&gt;(C_\beta\mid\beta \text{ a limit point of }\kappa^+)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying:

# &lt;math&gt;C_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a [[club set]] of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt; cf \beta &lt; \kappa &lt;/math&gt;, then  &lt;math&gt;|C_\beta| &lt; \kappa &lt;/math&gt;
# If &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a limit point of &lt;math&gt;C_\beta&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;C_\gamma = C_\beta \cap \gamma&lt;/math&gt;

Jensen proved that this principle holds in the constructible universe for any uncountable cardinal κ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33582">'''Stochastic gradient descent''' (often shortened to '''SGD'''), also known as '''incremental''' gradient descent, is an [[iterative method]] for [[Mathematical optimization|optimizing]] a [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] [[objective function]], a [[stochastic approximation]] of [[gradient descent]] optimization. A recent article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mei | first = Song | title = A mean field view of the landscape of two-layer neural networks | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume =  | issue =  | year = 2018 | pages =  | jstor =  | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1806579115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; implicitly credits [[Herbert Robbins]] and Sutton Monro for developing SGD in their 1951 article titled "A Stochastic Approximation Method"; see [[Stochastic approximation]] for more information. It is called '''stochastic''' because samples are selected randomly (or shuffled) instead of as a single group (as in standard [[gradient descent]]) or in the order they appear in the training set.

== Background ==
{{Main|M-estimation}}
{{See also|Estimating equation}}
Both [[statistics|statistical]] [[M-estimation|estimation]] and [[machine learning]] consider the problem of [[Mathematical optimization|minimizing]] an [[objective function]] that has the form of a sum:
: &lt;math&gt;Q(w) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Q_i(w),&lt;/math&gt;
where the [[parametric statistics|parameter]] &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; which minimizes &lt;math&gt;Q(w)&lt;/math&gt; is to be [[estimator|estimated]]. Each summand function &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; is typically associated with the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th [[Observation (statistics)|observation]] in the [[data set]] (used for training).

In classical statistics, sum-minimization problems arise in [[least squares]] and in [[maximum-likelihood estimation]] (for independent observations).  The general class of estimators that arise as minimizers of sums are called [[M-estimator]]s. However, in statistics, it has been long recognized that requiring even local minimization is too restrictive for some problems of maximum-likelihood estimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ferguson | first = Thomas S. | title = An inconsistent maximum likelihood estimate | journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association | volume = 77 | issue = 380 | year = 1982 | pages = 831–834 | jstor = 2287314 | doi = 10.1080/01621459.1982.10477894 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, contemporary statistical theorists often consider [[stationary point]]s of the [[likelihood function]] (or zeros of its derivative, the [[Score (statistics)|score function]], and other [[estimating equations]]).

The sum-minimization problem also arises for [[empirical risk minimization]]. In this case, &lt;math&gt;Q_i(w)&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the [[loss function]] at &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th example, and &lt;math&gt;Q(w)&lt;/math&gt; is the empirical risk.

When used to minimize the above function, a standard (or "batch") [[gradient descent]] method would perform the following iterations :
: &lt;math&gt;w := w - \eta \nabla Q(w) = w - \eta \sum_{i=1}^n \nabla Q_i(w)/n,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is a step size (sometimes called the ''[[learning rate]]'' in machine learning).

In many cases, the summand functions have a simple form that enables inexpensive evaluations of the sum-function and the sum gradient. For example, in statistics, [[exponential families|one-parameter exponential families]] allow economical function-evaluations and gradient-evaluations.

However, in other cases, evaluating the sum-gradient may require expensive evaluations of the gradients from all summand functions. When the training set is enormous and no simple formulas exist, evaluating the sums of gradients becomes very expensive, because evaluating the gradient requires evaluating all the summand functions' gradients. To economize on the computational cost at every iteration, stochastic gradient descent [[sampling (statistics)|samples]] a subset of summand functions at every step. This is very
effective in the case of large-scale machine learning problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |first1=Léon |last1=Bottou |author1-link=Léon Bottou |last2=Bousquet |first2=Olivier |title=The Tradeoffs of Large Scale Learning |url=http://leon.bottou.org/papers/bottou-bousquet-2008 |conference=[[Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems]] |volume=20 |pages=161–168 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iterative method ==
[[Image:stogra.png|thumb|right|Fluctuations in the total objective function as gradient steps with respect to mini-batches are taken.]]

In stochastic (or "on-line") gradient descent, the true gradient of &lt;math&gt;Q(w)&lt;/math&gt; is approximated by a gradient at a single example:
: &lt;math&gt;w := w - \eta \nabla Q_i(w).&lt;/math&gt;
As the algorithm sweeps through the training set, it performs the above update for each training example. Several passes can be made over the training set until the algorithm converges. If this is done, the data can be shuffled for each pass to prevent cycles. Typical implementations may use an [[adaptive learning rate]] so that the algorithm converges.

In pseudocode, stochastic gradient descent can be presented as follows:
&lt;div style="margin-left: 35px; width: 600px"&gt;
{{framebox|blue}}
* Choose an initial vector of parameters &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and learning rate &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;.
* Repeat until an approximate minimum is obtained:
** Randomly shuffle examples in the training set.
** For &lt;math&gt; i=1, 2, ..., n&lt;/math&gt;, do:
*** &lt;math&gt;\! w := w - \eta \nabla Q_i(w).&lt;/math&gt;
{{frame-footer}}
&lt;/div&gt;

A compromise between computing the true gradient and the gradient at a single example is to compute the gradient against more than one training example (called a "mini-batch") at each step.  This can perform significantly better than "true" stochastic gradient descent described, because the code can make use of [[Vectorization (mathematics)|vectorization]] libraries rather than computing each step separately.  It may also result in smoother convergence, as the gradient computed at each step is averaged over more training examples.

The convergence of stochastic gradient descent has been analyzed using the theories of [[convex optimization|convex minimization]] and of [[stochastic approximation]]. Briefly, when the learning rates &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; decrease with an appropriate rate,
and subject to relatively mild assumptions, stochastic gradient descent converges almost surely to a global minimum 
when the objective function is [[convex function|convex]] or [[pseudoconvex function|pseudoconvex]], 
and otherwise converges almost surely to a local minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Example ==
Let's suppose we want to fit a straight line &lt;math&gt;y = \! w_1 + w_2 x&lt;/math&gt; to a training set with observations&lt;math&gt; (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; and corresponding estimated responses &lt;math&gt; (\hat{y_1}, \hat{y_2}, \ldots, \hat{y_n})&lt;/math&gt; using [[least squares]]. The objective function to be minimized is:
: &lt;math&gt;Q(w) = \sum_{i=1}^n Q_i(w) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\hat{y_i}-y_i\right)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(w_1 + w_2 x_i - y_i\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The last line in the above pseudocode for this specific problem will become:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \end{bmatrix} :=
    \begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \end{bmatrix}
    - \eta \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial}{\partial w_1} (w_1 + w_2 x_i - y_i)^2 \\
            \frac{\partial}{\partial w_2} (w_1 + w_2 x_i - y_i)^2 \end{bmatrix} =
    \begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \end{bmatrix}
    -  \eta  \begin{bmatrix} 2 (w_1 + w_2 x_i - y_i) \\ 2 x_i(w_1 + w_2 x_i - y_i) \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The key difference compared to standard (Batch) Gradient Descent is that only one piece of data from the dataset is used to calculate the step, and the piece of data is picked randomly at each step.

== Applications ==
Stochastic gradient descent is a popular algorithm for training a wide range of models in [[machine learning]], including (linear) [[support vector machine]]s, [[logistic regression]] (see, e.g., [[Vowpal Wabbit]]) and [[graphical model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Rose Finkel, Alex Kleeman, Christopher D. Manning (2008). [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P08-1109 Efficient, Feature-based, Conditional Random Field Parsing]. Proc. Annual Meeting of the ACL.&lt;/ref&gt; When combined with the [[backpropagation]] algorithm, it is the ''de facto'' standard algorithm for training [[artificial neural network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98b.pdf LeCun, Yann A., et al.

Stochastic gradient descent competes with the [[limited-memory BFGS|L-BFGS]] algorithm,{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} which is also widely used. Stochastic gradient descent has been used since at least 1960 for training [[linear regression]] models, originally under the name [[ADALINE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Avi Pfeffer |title=CS181 Lecture 5 — Perceptrons |url=http://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs181/files/lecture05-notes.pdf |publisher=Harvard University }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular stochastic gradient descent algorithm is the [[Least mean squares filter|least mean squares (LMS)]] adaptive filter.

==Extensions and variants==
Many improvements on the basic stochastic gradient descent algorithm have been proposed and used. In particular, in machine learning, the need to set a learning rate (step size) has been recognized as problematic. Setting this parameter too high can cause the algorithm to diverge{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}; setting it too low makes it slow to converge{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}. A conceptually simple extension of stochastic gradient descent makes the learning rate a decreasing function {{mvar|η&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the iteration number {{mvar|t}}, giving a ''learning rate schedule'', so that the first iterations cause large changes in the parameters, while the later ones do only fine-tuning. Such schedules have been known since the work of MacQueen on [[K-means clustering|{{mvar|k}}-means clustering]].&lt;ref&gt;Cited by {{cite conference |last1=Darken |first1=Christian |first2=John |last2=Moody |title=Fast adaptive k-means clustering: some empirical results |year=1990 |conference=Int'l Joint Conf. on Neural Networks (IJCNN) |publisher=IEEE|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5726679/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicit updates (ISGD)===
As mentioned earlier, classical stochastic gradient descent is generally sensitive to learning rate {{mvar|η}}. Fast convergence requires large learning rates but this may induce numerical instability. The problem can be largely solved by considering ''implicit updates'' whereby the stochastic gradient is evaluated at the next iterate rather than the current one:
:&lt;math&gt;w^{new} := w^{old} - \eta \nabla Q_i(w^{new}).&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is implicit since &lt;math&gt;w^{new}&lt;/math&gt; appears on both sides of the equation. It is a stochastic form of the [[proximal gradient method]] since the update
can also be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;w^{new} := \arg\min_w \{ Q_i(w) + \frac{1}{2\eta} ||w - w^{old}||^2 \}.&lt;/math&gt;

As an example, 
consider least squares with features &lt;math&gt;x_1, \ldots, x_n \in\mathbb{R}^p&lt;/math&gt; and observations
&lt;math&gt;y_1, \ldots, y_n\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. We wish to solve:
:&lt;math&gt;\min_w \sum_{j=1}^n (y_j - x_j'w)^2.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; could have "1" as the first element to include an intercept. Classical stochastic gradient descent proceeds as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;w^{new} = w^{old} + \eta (y_i - x_i'w^{old}) x_i&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly sampled between 1 and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Although theoretical convergence of this procedure happens under relatively mild assumptions, in practice the procedure can be quite unstable. In particular, when &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is misspecified so that &lt;math&gt;I - \eta x_i x_i'&lt;/math&gt; has large absolute eigenvalues with high probability, the procedure may diverge numerically within a few iterations. In contrast, ''implicit stochastic gradient descent'' (shortened as ISGD) can be solved in closed-form as:
:&lt;math&gt;w^{new} = w^{old} + \frac{\eta}{1 + \eta ||x_i||^2} (y_i - x_i'w^{old}) x_i.&lt;/math&gt;

This procedure will remain numerically stable virtually for all &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; as the learning rate is now normalized. Such comparison between classical and implicit stochastic gradient descent in the least squares problem is very similar to the comparison between [[Least mean squares filter|least mean squares (LMS)]] and 
[[Least mean squares filter#Normalized_least_mean_squares_filter_(NLMS)| normalized least mean squares filter (NLMS)]].

Even though a closed-form solution for ISGD is only possible in least squares, the procedure can be efficiently implemented in a wide range of models. Specifically, suppose that &lt;math&gt;Q_i(w)&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; only through a linear combination with features &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, so that we can write &lt;math&gt;\nabla_w Q_i(w) = -q(x_i'w) x_i&lt;/math&gt;, where 
&lt;math&gt;q() \in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; may depend on &lt;math&gt;x_i, y_i&lt;/math&gt; as well but not on &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; except through &lt;math&gt;x_i'w&lt;/math&gt;. Least squares obeys this rule, and so does [[Logistic regression | logistic regression]], and most [[Generalized linear model| generalized linear models]]. For instance, in least squares, &lt;math&gt;q(x_i'w) = y_i - x_i'w&lt;/math&gt;, and in logistic regression &lt;math&gt;q(x_i'w) = y_i - S(x_i'w)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S(u) = e^u/(1+e^u)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[logistic function]]. In [[Poisson regression]], &lt;math&gt;q(x_i'w) = y_i - e^{x_i'w}&lt;/math&gt;, and so on.

In such settings, ISGD is simply implemented as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;w^{new} = w^{old} + \xi x_i,\quad\xi = \eta q(x_i'w^{old} + \xi ||x_i||^2).&lt;/math&gt;

The scaling factor &lt;math&gt;\xi\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; can be found through [[Bisection method| bisection method]] since 
in most regular models, such as the aforementioned generalized linear models, function &lt;math&gt;q()&lt;/math&gt; is decreasing, 
and thus the search bounds for &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; are 
&lt;math&gt;[\min(0, b_i), \max(0, b_i)]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;b_i = \eta q(x_i'w^{old})&lt;/math&gt;.

===Momentum===
Further proposals include the ''momentum method'', which appeared in [[David Rumelhart|Rumelhart]], [[Geoffrey Hinton|Hinton]] and [[Ronald J. Williams|Williams]]' seminal paper on backpropagation learning.&lt;ref name="Rumelhart1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rumelhart|first=David E.|author2=Hinton, Geoffrey E.|author3=Williams, Ronald J.|title=Learning representations by back-propagating errors|journal=Nature|date=8 October 1986|volume=323|issue=6088|pages=533–536|doi=10.1038/323533a0|bibcode=1986Natur.323..533R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stochastic gradient descent with momentum remembers the update {{math|Δ ''w''}} at each iteration, and determines the next update as a [[linear combination]] of the gradient and the previous update:&lt;ref name="Sutskever2013"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Sutskever|first=Ilya|author2=Martens, James|author3=Dahl, George|author4=Hinton, Geoffrey E.|editor=Sanjoy Dasgupta and David Mcallester|title=On the importance of initialization and momentum in deep learning|conference=In Proceedings of the 30th international conference on machine learning (ICML-13)|date=June 2013|volume=28|location=Atlanta, GA|pages=1139–1147|url=http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~ilya/pubs/2013/1051_2.pdf|access-date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SutskeverPhD"&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Sutskever|first=Ilya|title=Training recurrent neural networks|date=2013|publisher=University of Toronto|url=http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~ilya/pubs/ilya_sutskever_phd_thesis.pdf|type=Ph.D.|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta w := \alpha \Delta w - \eta \nabla Q_i(w)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;w := w + \Delta w &lt;/math&gt;
that leads to:
:&lt;math&gt;w := w - \eta \nabla Q_i(w) + \alpha \Delta w &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[parametric statistics|parameter]] &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; which minimizes &lt;math&gt;Q(w)&lt;/math&gt; is to be [[estimator|estimated]], and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is a step size (sometimes called the ''learning rate'' in machine learning){{clarify|reason=What is alpha in this case??|date=October 2017}}.

The name momentum stems from an analogy to [[momentum]] in physics: the weight vector &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, thought of as a particle traveling through parameter space{{r|Rumelhart1986}}, incurs acceleration from the gradient of the loss ("[[force]]"). Unlike in classical stochastic gradient descent, it tends to keep traveling in the same direction, preventing oscillations. Momentum has been used successfully by computer scientists in the training of [[artificial neural networks]] for several decades.&lt;ref name="Zeiler 2012"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Zeiler |first=Matthew D. |eprint=1212.5701 |title=ADADELTA: An adaptive learning rate method |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Averaging===
''Averaged stochastic gradient descent'', invented independently by Ruppert and Polyak in the late 1980s, is ordinary stochastic gradient descent that records an average of its parameter vector over time. That is, the update is the same as for ordinary stochastic gradient descent, but the algorithm also keeps track of&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Polyak |first1=Boris T. |first2=Anatoli B. |last2=Juditsky |title=Acceleration of stochastic approximation by averaging |journal=SIAM J. Control and Optimization |volume=30 |issue=4 |year=1992 |pages=838–855|url=http://www.meyn.ece.ufl.edu/archive/spm_files/Courses/ECE555-2011/555media/poljud92.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{w} = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} w_i&lt;/math&gt;.

When optimization is done, this averaged parameter vector takes the place of {{mvar|w}}.

===AdaGrad===
''AdaGrad'' (for adaptive [[Gradient descent|gradient]] algorithm) is a modified stochastic gradient descent with per-parameter learning rate, first published in 2011.&lt;ref name="duchi"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duchi |first1=John |first2=Elad |last2=Hazan |first3=Yoram |last3=Singer |title=Adaptive subgradient methods for online learning and stochastic optimization |journal=[[Journal of Machine Learning Research|JMLR]] |volume=12 |year=2011 |pages=2121–2159 |url=http://jmlr.org/papers/volume12/duchi11a/duchi11a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joseph |last=Perla |year=2014 |title=Notes on AdaGrad |url=http://seed.ucsd.edu/mediawiki/images/6/6a/Adagrad.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330033637/http://seed.ucsd.edu/mediawiki/images/6/6a/Adagrad.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Informally, this increases the learning rate for more sparse parameters and decreases the learning rate for less sparse ones. This strategy often improves convergence performance over standard stochastic gradient descent in settings where data is sparse and sparse parameters are more informative. Examples of such applications include natural language processing and image recognition.&lt;ref name="duchi"/&gt;  It still has a base learning rate {{mvar|η}}, but this is multiplied with the elements of a vector {{math|{''G''&lt;sub&gt;''j'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt;} }} which is the diagonal of the [[outer product]] matrix

:&lt;math&gt;G = \sum_{\tau=1}^t g_\tau g_\tau^\mathsf{T}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g_\tau = \nabla Q_i(w)&lt;/math&gt;, the gradient, at iteration {{mvar|τ}}. The diagonal is given by

:&lt;math&gt;G_{j,j} = \sum_{\tau=1}^t g_{\tau,j}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

This vector is updated after every iteration. The formula for an update is now

:&lt;math&gt;w := w - \eta\, \mathrm{diag}(G)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \circ g&lt;/math&gt;{{efn|&lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hadamard product (matrices)|element-wise product]].}}

or, written as per-parameter updates,

:&lt;math&gt;w_j := w_j - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{G_{j,j}}} g_j.&lt;/math&gt;

Each {{math|{''G''&lt;sub&gt;(''i'',''i'')&lt;/sub&gt;} }} gives rise to a scaling factor for the learning rate that applies to a single parameter {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Since the denominator in this factor, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{G_i} = \sqrt{\sum_{\tau=1}^t g_\tau^2}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Norm (mathematics)#Euclidean norm|''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; norm]] of previous derivatives, extreme parameter updates get dampened, while parameters that get few or small updates receive higher learning rates.&lt;ref name="Zeiler 2012"/&gt;

While designed for [[convex optimization|convex problems]], AdaGrad has been successfully applied to non-convex optimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gupta |first1=Maya R. |first2=Samy |last2=Bengio |first3=Jason |last3=Weston |title=Training highly multiclass classifiers |journal=JMLR |volume=15 |issue=1 |year=2014 |pages=1461–1492 |url=http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/gupta14a/gupta14a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RMSProp===
''RMSProp'' (for Root Mean Square Propagation) is also a method in which the learning rate is adapted for each of the parameters. The idea is to divide the learning rate for a weight by a running average of the magnitudes of recent gradients for that weight.&lt;ref&gt;Tieleman, Tijmen and Hinton, Geoffrey (2012). Lecture 6.5-rmsprop: Divide the gradient by a running average of its recent magnitude. COURSERA: Neural Networks for Machine Learning&lt;/ref&gt; So, first the running average is calculated in terms of means square,

:&lt;math&gt;v(w,t):=\gamma v(w,t-1)+(1-\gamma)(\nabla Q_i(w))^2&lt;/math&gt;

where, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the forgetting factor.

And the parameters are updated as,

:&lt;math&gt;w:=w-\frac{\eta}{\sqrt{v(w,t)}}\nabla Q_i(w)&lt;/math&gt;

RMSProp has shown excellent adaptation of learning rate in different applications. RMSProp can be seen as a generalization of [[Rprop]] and is capable to work with mini-batches as well opposed to only full-batches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf|title=Overview of mini-batch gradient descent|last=Hinton|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Hinton|date=|website=|publisher=|pages=27–29|access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adam===
''Adam''&lt;ref name="Adam2014"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Diederik |first1=Kingma |first2=Jimmy |last2=Ba |eprint=1412.6980 |title=Adam: A method for stochastic optimization |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (short for Adaptive Moment Estimation) is an update to the ''RMSProp'' optimizer. In this optimization algorithm, running averages of both the gradients and the second moments of the gradients are used. Given parameters &lt;math&gt; w^ {(t)} &lt;/math&gt; and a loss function &lt;math&gt; L ^ {(t)} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt; indexes the current training iteration (indexed at &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;), Adam's parameter update is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;m_w ^ {(t+1)} \leftarrow \beta_1 m_w ^ {(t)} + (1 - \beta_1) \nabla _w L ^ {(t)} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_w ^ {(t+1)} \leftarrow \beta_2 v_w ^ {(t)} + (1 - \beta_2) (\nabla _w L ^ {(t)} )^2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{m}_w = \frac{m_w ^ {(t+1)}}{1 - (\beta_1) ^{t+1}} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{v}_w = \frac{ v_w ^ {(t+1)}}{1 - (\beta_2) ^{t+1}} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;w ^ {(t+1)} \leftarrow w ^ {(t)} - \eta \frac{\hat{m}_w}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_w} + \epsilon} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a small scalar used to prevent division by 0, and &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_2&lt;/math&gt; are the forgetting factors for gradients and second moments of gradients, respectively. Squaring and square-rooting is done elementwise.

===Natural Gradient Descent and kSGD===
Kalman-based Stochastic Gradient Descent (kSGD)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=V.|date=2016-01-01|title=Kalman-Based Stochastic Gradient Method with Stop Condition and Insensitivity to Conditioning|url=http://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/15M1048239|journal=SIAM Journal on Optimization|volume=26|issue=4|pages=2620–2648|doi=10.1137/15M1048239|issn=1052-6234|arxiv=1512.01139}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an online and offline algorithm for learning parameters from statistical problems from [[quasi-likelihood]] models, which include [[Linear regression|linear models]], [[Nonlinear regression|non-linear models]], [[generalized linear model]]s, and [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] with [[Mean squared error|squared error loss]] as special cases. For online learning problems, kSGD is a special case of the [[Kalman filter|Kalman Filter]] for linear regression problems, a special case of the [[Extended Kalman filter|Extended Kalman Filter]] for non-linear regression problems, and can be viewed as an incremental [[Gauss–Newton algorithm|Gauss-Newton]] method. Moreover, because of kSGD's relationship to the Kalman Filter and natural gradient descent's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cichocki|first1=A|last2=Chen|first2=T|last3=Amari|first3=S|title=Stability Analysis of Learning Algorithms for Blind Source Separation.|journal=Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society|date=November 1997|volume=10|issue=8|pages=1345–1351|pmid=12662478}}&lt;/ref&gt; relationship to the Kalman Filter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Yann|first1=Ollivier|title=Online Natural Gradient as a Kalman Filter|arxiv=1703.00209|language=en|date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; kSGD is a rigorous improvement over the popular natural gradient descent method.

The benefits of kSGD, in comparison to other methods, are (1) it is not sensitive to the condition number of the problem ,{{efn|For the linear regression problem, kSGD's objective function discrepancy (i.e. the total of bias and variance) at iteration &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;  is &lt;math&gt;{\frac {1+\epsilon }{k}}p\sigma ^{2}&lt;/math&gt;  with probability converging to 1 at a rate depending on &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\sigma ^{2}&lt;/math&gt;  is the variance of the residuals. Moreover, for specific choices of &lt;math&gt;\gamma _{1},\gamma _{2}&lt;/math&gt;, kSGD's objective function bias at iteration &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;  can be shown to be &lt;math&gt;\frac {(1+\epsilon )^{2}}{2k^{2}}\Vert w(0)-w_{*}\Vert _{2}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;  with probability converging to 1 at a rate depending on &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;w_{*}&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal parameter.
}} (2) it has a robust choice of hyperparameters, and (3) it has a stopping condition. The drawbacks of kSGD is that the algorithm requires storing a dense covariance matrix between iterations, and requires a matrix-vector product at each iteration.

To describe the algorithm, suppose &lt;math&gt;Q_i(w)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;w \in \mathbb{R}^p&lt;/math&gt; is defined by an example &lt;math&gt;(Y_i,X_i)\in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_w Q_i(w) = \frac{Y_i - \mu(X_i,w)}{V(\mu(X_i,w))} \nabla_w \mu(X_i,w)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu(X_i,w)&lt;/math&gt; is mean function (i.e. the expected value of &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;V(\mu(X_i,w))&lt;/math&gt; is the variance function (i.e. the variance of &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;). Then, the parameter update, &lt;math&gt; w(t+1) &lt;/math&gt;, and covariance matrix update, &lt;math&gt; M(t+1) &lt;/math&gt; are given by the following

:&lt;math&gt; p = \nabla_w \mu(X_{t+1},w(t)) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; m = \mu(X_{t+1},w(t)) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; v = M(t) p &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; s = \min\lbrace \gamma_1, \max\lbrace \gamma_2, V(m)\rbrace \rbrace + v^\mathsf{T} p &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; w(t+1) = w(t) + \frac{Y_{t+1} - m}{s}v &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; M(t+1) = M(t) - \frac{1}{s} v v^\mathsf{T} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1,\gamma_2&lt;/math&gt; are hyperparameters. The &lt;math&gt;M(t)&lt;/math&gt; update can result in the covariance matrix becoming indefinite, which can be avoided at the cost of a matrix-matrix multiplication. &lt;math&gt;M(0)&lt;/math&gt; can be any positive definite symmetric matrix, but is typically taken to be the identity. As noted by Patel,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; for all problems besides linear regression, restarts are required to ensure convergence of the algorithm, but no theoretical or implementation details were given. In a closely related, off-line, mini-batch method for non-linear regression analyzed by Bertsekas,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bertsekas|first=D.|date=1996-08-01|title=Incremental Least Squares Methods and the Extended Kalman Filter|url=http://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S1052623494268522|journal=SIAM Journal on Optimization|volume=6|issue=3|pages=807–822|doi=10.1137/S1052623494268522|issn=1052-6234}}&lt;/ref&gt; a forgetting factor was used in the covariance matrix update to prove convergence.

In statistics, '''stochastic volatility''' models are those in which the [[variance]] of a [[stochastic process]] is itself randomly distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jim Gatheral|title=The Volatility Surface: A Practitioner's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKiKpjM9bf8C|date=18 September 2006|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-06825-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used in the field of [[mathematical finance]] to evaluate [[derivative (finance)|derivative]] [[securities]], such as [[option (finance)|options]]. The name derives from the models' treatment of the underlying security's [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] as a [[random process]], governed by [[state variable]]s such as the price level of the underlying security, the tendency of volatility to revert to some long-run mean value, and the [[variance]] of the volatility process itself, among others.

Stochastic volatility models are one approach to resolve a shortcoming of the [[Black–Scholes]] model. In particular, models based on Black-Scholes assume that the underlying volatility is constant over the life of the derivative, and unaffected by the changes in the price level of the underlying security. However, these models cannot explain long-observed features of the implied volatility surface such as [[volatility smile]] and skew, which indicate that implied volatility does tend to vary with respect to [[strike price]] and expiry. By assuming that the volatility of the underlying price is a stochastic process rather than a constant, it becomes possible to model derivatives more accurately.

==Basic model==
Starting from a constant volatility approach, assume that the derivative's underlying asset price follows a standard model for [[geometric Brownian motion]]:

:&lt;math&gt; dS_t = \mu S_t\,dt + \sigma S_t\,dW_t \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu \,&lt;/math&gt; is the constant drift (i.e. expected return) of the security price &lt;math&gt;S_t \,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma \,&lt;/math&gt; is the constant volatility, and &lt;math&gt;dW_t \,&lt;/math&gt; is a standard [[Wiener process]] with zero [[mean]] and unit rate of [[variance]]. The explicit solution of this [[stochastic differential equation]] is

:&lt;math&gt;S_t= S_0 e^{(\mu- \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2) t+ \sigma W_t}. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[maximum likelihood|maximum likelihood estimator]] to estimate the constant volatility &lt;math&gt;\sigma \,&lt;/math&gt; for given stock prices &lt;math&gt;S_t \,&lt;/math&gt; at different times &lt;math&gt;t_i \,&lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\widehat{\sigma}^2 &amp;= \left(\frac 1 n \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(\ln S_{t_i}- \ln S_{t_{i-1}})^2}{t_i-t_{i-1}} \right) - \frac 1 n \frac{(\ln S_{t_n}- \ln S_{t_0})^2}{t_n-t_0}\\
&amp; = \frac 1 n \sum_{i=1}^n (t_i-t_{i-1})\left(\frac{\ln \frac{S_{t_i}}{S_{t_{i-1}}}}{t_i-t_{i-1}} - \frac{\ln \frac{S_{t_n}}{S_{t_0}}}{t_n-t_0}\right)^2;
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

its [[expected value]] is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname E \left[ \widehat{\sigma}^2\right]= \frac{n}{n-1} \sigma^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This basic model with constant volatility &lt;math&gt;\sigma \,&lt;/math&gt; is the starting point for non-stochastic volatility models such as [[Black–Scholes model]] and [[Cox–Ross–Rubinstein model]].

For a stochastic volatility model, replace the constant volatility &lt;math&gt;\sigma \,&lt;/math&gt; with a function &lt;math&gt;\nu_t \,&lt;/math&gt;, that models the variance of &lt;math&gt;S_t \,&lt;/math&gt;. This variance function is also modeled as Brownian motion, and the form of &lt;math&gt;\nu_t \,&lt;/math&gt; depends on the particular SV model under study. 
:&lt;math&gt; dS_t = \mu S_t\,dt + \sqrt{\nu_t} S_t\,dW_t \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; d\nu_t = \alpha_{\nu,t}\,dt + \beta_{\nu,t}\,dB_t \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\nu,t} \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_{\nu,t} \,&lt;/math&gt; are some functions of &lt;math&gt;\nu \,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;dB_t \,&lt;/math&gt; is another standard gaussian that is correlated with &lt;math&gt;dW_t \,&lt;/math&gt; with constant correlation factor &lt;math&gt;\rho \,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Heston model===
{{Main|Heston model}}

The popular Heston model is a commonly used SV model, in which the randomness of the variance process varies as the square root of variance. In this case, the differential equation for variance takes the form:

:&lt;math&gt; d\nu_t = \theta(\omega - \nu_t)\,dt + \xi \sqrt{\nu_t}\,dB_t \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the mean long-term volatility, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the rate at which the volatility reverts toward its long-term mean, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is the volatility of the volatility process, and &lt;math&gt;dB_t&lt;/math&gt; is, like &lt;math&gt;dW_t&lt;/math&gt;, a gaussian with zero mean and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{dt}&lt;/math&gt; standard deviation. However, &lt;math&gt;dW_t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dB_t&lt;/math&gt; are correlated with the constant [[correlation]] value &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.

In other words, the Heston SV model assumes that the variance is a random process that
#exhibits a tendency to revert towards a long-term mean &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; at a rate &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;,
#exhibits a volatility proportional to the square root of its level
#and whose source of randomness is correlated (with correlation &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;) with the randomness of the underlying's price processes.

Some parametrisation of the volatility surface, such as 'SVI',&lt;ref name=SVI&gt;{{cite journal | author=J Gatheral, A Jacquier | title=Arbitrage-free SVI volatility surfaces |  journal=Quantitative Finance | year = 2014|doi = 10.1080/14697688.2013.819986 | volume=14|arxiv=1204.0646}}&lt;/ref&gt; are based on the Heston model.

===CEV model ===
{{Main|Constant elasticity of variance model}}

The '''CEV''' model describes the relationship between volatility and price, introducing stochastic volatility:

:&lt;math&gt;dS_t=\mu S_t \, dt + \sigma S_t^{\, \gamma} \, dW_t&lt;/math&gt;

Conceptually, in some markets volatility rises when prices rise (e.g. commodities), so &lt;math&gt;\gamma &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.  In other markets, volatility tends to rise as prices fall, modelled with &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Some argue that because the CEV model does not incorporate its own stochastic process for volatility, it is not truly a stochastic volatility model.  Instead, they call it a [[local volatility]] model.

===SABR volatility model===
{{Main|SABR volatility model}}

The '''SABR''' model (Stochastic Alpha, Beta, Rho), introduced by Hagan et al.&lt;ref&gt;PS Hagan, D Kumar, A Lesniewski, DE Woodward (2002) [http://lesniewski.us/papers/published/ManagingSmileRisk.pdf Managing smile risk], Wilmott, 84-108.&lt;/ref&gt; describes a single forward &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; (related to any asset e.g. an index, interest rate, bond, currency or equity) under stochastic volatility &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;dF_t=\sigma_t F^\beta_t\, dW_t,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;d\sigma_t=\alpha\sigma_t\, dZ_t,&lt;/math&gt;

The initial values &lt;math&gt;F_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; are the current forward price and volatility, whereas &lt;math&gt;W_t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z_t&lt;/math&gt; are two correlated Wiener processes (i.e. Brownian motions) with correlation coefficient &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;\rho&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. The constant parameters &lt;math&gt;\beta,\;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are such that &lt;math&gt;0\leq\beta\leq 1,\;\alpha\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The main feature of the SABR model is to be able to reproduce the smile effect of the [[volatility smile]].

===GARCH model===
The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity ([[GARCH]]) model is another popular model for estimating stochastic volatility. It assumes that the randomness of the variance process varies with the variance, as opposed to the square root of the variance as in the Heston model. The standard GARCH(1,1) model has the following form for the variance differential:

:&lt;math&gt; d\nu_t = \theta(\omega - \nu_t)\,dt + \xi \nu_t\,dB_t \,&lt;/math&gt;

The GARCH model has been extended via numerous variants, including the NGARCH, TGARCH, IGARCH, LGARCH, EGARCH, GJR-GARCH, etc. Strictly, however, the conditional volatilities from GARCH models are not stochastic since at time ''t'' the volatility is completely pre-determined (deterministic) given previous values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brooks |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Brooks (academic) |date=2014 |title=Introductory Econometrics for Finance |edition=3rd |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=461 |ISBN=9781107661455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===3/2 model===
The 3/2 model is similar to the Heston model, but assumes that the randomness of the variance process varies with &lt;math&gt;\nu_t^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;. The form of the variance differential is:

:&lt;math&gt; d\nu_t = \nu_t(\omega - \theta\nu_t)\,dt + \xi \nu_t^{3/2} \,dB_t. \,&lt;/math&gt;

However the meaning of the parameters is different from Heston model. In this model both, mean reverting and volatility of variance parameters, are stochastic quantities given by &lt;math&gt; \theta\nu_t&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt; \xi\nu_t&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

==Calibration and estimation==
Once a particular SV model is chosen, it must be calibrated against existing market data. Calibration is the process of identifying the set of model parameters that are most likely given the observed data. One popular technique is to use [[Maximum likelihood|maximum likelihood estimation]] (MLE). For instance, in the Heston model, the set of model parameters &lt;math&gt;\Psi_0 = \{\omega, \theta, \xi, \rho\} \,&lt;/math&gt; can be estimated applying an MLE algorithm such as the Powell [[Directed set|Directed Set]] method [http://www.library.cornell.edu/nr/bookcpdf.html] to observations of historic underlying security prices.

In this case, you start with an estimate for &lt;math&gt;\Psi_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;, compute the residual errors when applying the historic price data to the resulting model, and then adjust &lt;math&gt;\Psi \,&lt;/math&gt; to try to minimize these errors. Once the calibration has been performed, it is standard practice to re-calibrate the model periodically.

An alternative to calibration is statistical estimation, thereby accounting for parameter uncertainty. Many frequentist and Bayesian methods have been proposed and implemented, typically for a subset of the abovementioned models. The following list contains extension packages for the open source statistical software [[R (programming language)|R]] that have been specifically designed for heteroskedasticity estimation. The first three cater for GARCH-type models with deterministic volatilities; the fourth deals with stochastic volatility estimation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] fields of [[category theory]] and [[abstract algebra]], a '''subquotient''' is a [[quotient object]] of a [[subobject]]. Subquotients are particularly important in [[abelian categories]], and in [[group theory]], where they are also known as '''sections''', though this conflicts with a different meaning in [[section (category theory)|category theory]].

For example, of the 26 [[sporadic group]]s, 20 are subquotients of the [[monster group]], and are referred to as the "Happy Family", while the other 6 are [[pariah group]]s.

A quotient of a subrepresentation of a representation (of, say, a group) might be called a subquotient representation; e.g., [[Harish-Chandra]]'s subquotient theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Dixmier | first1=Jacques | title=Enveloping algebras | origyear=1974 | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0821805606 | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | series=[[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]] | isbn=978-0-8218-0560-2 | mr=0498740 | year=1996 | volume=11}} p. 310&lt;/ref&gt;

In constructive [[set theory]], where the [[law of excluded middle]] does not necessarily hold, one can consider the relation 'subquotient of' as replacing the usual [[order relation]](s) on [[cardinal number|cardinals]]. When one has the law of the excluded middle, then a subquotient &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is either the [[empty set]] or there is an onto function &lt;math&gt;Y\to X&lt;/math&gt;. This order relation is traditionally denoted &lt;math&gt;\leq^\ast&lt;/math&gt;. If additionally the [[axiom of choice]] holds, then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has a one-to-one function to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and this order relation is the usual &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; on corresponding cardinals.

==Transitive relation==
The relation »is subquotient of« is transitive.
;Proof
Let &lt;math&gt;G,H,J&lt;/math&gt; groups and &lt;math&gt;\phi\colon G\to H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\colon H\to J&lt;/math&gt; be [[group homomorphism]]s, then also the composition
:&lt;math&gt;\psi\circ\phi\colon G\to J, g \mapsto (\psi\circ\phi)(g):=\psi(\phi(g))&lt;/math&gt;
is a homomorphism.

If &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\phi(U)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;U':=\phi^{-1}(V)&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;U\leq G&lt;/math&gt;. We have &lt;math&gt;\phi(U')\subseteq V&lt;/math&gt;, indeed &lt;math&gt;\phi(U')=V&lt;/math&gt;, because every &lt;math&gt;v \in V\subseteq \phi(U)&lt;/math&gt; has a [[preimage]] in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;(\psi\circ\phi)(U')=\psi(V)&lt;/math&gt;. This means that the image, say &lt;math&gt;\psi(V)&lt;/math&gt;, of a subgroup, say &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is also the image of a subgroup, namely &lt;math&gt;U'&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;\psi\circ\phi&lt;/math&gt;, of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

In other words: If &lt;math&gt;\psi(V)&lt;/math&gt; is a subquotient of &lt;math&gt;\phi(U)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi(U)&lt;/math&gt; is subquotient of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\psi(V)&lt;/math&gt; is subquotient of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;■

In [[mathematics]], '''Tonelli's theorem in functional analysis''' is a fundamental result on the [[weak topology|weak]] [[lower semicontinuous|lower semicontinuity]] of [[nonlinear]] [[functional (mathematics)|functionals]] on [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces]]. As such, it has major implications for [[functional analysis]] and the [[calculus of variations]]. Roughly, it shows that weak lower semicontinuity for integral functionals is equivalent to [[convex function|convexity]] of the integral kernel. The result is attributed to the [[Italy|Italian]] [[mathematician]] [[Leonida Tonelli]].

==Statement of the theorem==
Let &amp;Omega; be a bounded [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]] in ''n''-[[dimension]]al [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and let ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;cup;&amp;nbsp;{&amp;plusmn;&amp;infin;} be a [[continuous function|continuous]] [[extended real number line|extended real-valued]] function. Define a nonlinear functional ''F'' on functions ''u''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;&amp;Omega;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;F[u] = \int_{\Omega} f(u(x)) \, \mathrm{d} x.&lt;/math&gt;

Then ''F'' is sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous on the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; space ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;Omega;;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;) for 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;infin; and weakly-&amp;lowast; lower semicontinuous on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;infin;&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;Omega;;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;) [[if and only if]] the function ''f''

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{m} \ni u \mapsto f(u) \in \mathbb{R} \cup \{ \pm \infty \}\ &lt;/math&gt;

is convex.

In [[geometry]], the '''trilinear coordinates''' ''x:y:z'' of a point relative to a given [[triangle]] describe the relative [[directed distance]]s from the three [[extended side|sidelines]] of the triangle.  Trilinear coordinates are an example of [[homogeneous coordinates]].  The ratio ''x:y'' is the ratio of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides ([[extended side|extended]] if necessary) opposite [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] ''A'' and ''B'' respectively; the ratio ''y:z'' is the ratio of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sidelines opposite vertices ''B'' and ''C'' respectively; and likewise for ''z:x'' and vertices ''C'' and ''A''.

In the diagram at right, the trilinear coordinates of the indicated interior point are the actual distances (''a' '', ''b' '', ''c' ''), or equivalently in ratio form, ''ka' '':''kb' '':''kc' '' for any positive constant ''k''. If a point is on a sideline of the reference triangle, its corresponding trilinear coordinate is 0. If an exterior point is on the opposite side of a sideline from the interior of the triangle, its trilinear coordinate associated with that sideline is negative. It is impossible for all three trilinear coordinates to be non-positive.

The name "trilinear coordinates" is sometimes abbreviated to "trilinears". 

==Notation==

The ratio notation ''x'':''y'':''z'' for trilinear coordinates is different from the ordered triple notation (''a' '', ''b' '', ''c' '') for actual directed distances. Here each of ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' has no meaning by itself; its ratio to one of the others ''does'' have meaning. Thus "comma notation" for trilinear coordinates should be avoided, because the notation (''x'', ''y'', ''z''), which means an ordered triple, does not allow, for example, (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = (2''x'', 2''y'', 2''z''), whereas the "colon notation" does allow ''x'' : ''y'' : ''z'' = 2''x'' : 2''y'' : 2''z''.

==Examples==

The trilinear coordinates of the [[incenter]] of a triangle ''ABC'' are 1 : 1 : 1; that is, the (directed) distances from the incenter to the sidelines ''BC'', ''CA'', ''AB'' are proportional to the actual distances denoted by (''r'', ''r'', ''r''), where ''r'' is the inradius of triangle ''ABC''. Given side lengths ''a, b, c'' we have:

:* ''A'' = 1 : 0 : 0
:* ''B'' = 0 : 1 : 0
:* ''C'' = 0 : 0 : 1
:* [[incenter]] = 1 : 1 : 1
:* [[centroid]] = ''bc'' : ''ca'' : ''ab'' = 1/''a'' : 1/''b'' : 1/''c'' = csc ''A'' : csc ''B'' : csc ''C''.
:* [[circumcenter]] = cos ''A'' : cos ''B'' : cos ''C''.
:* [[orthocenter]] = sec ''A'' : sec ''B'' : sec ''C''.
:* [[nine-point center]] = cos(''B'' &amp;minus; ''C'') : cos(''C'' &amp;minus; ''A'') : cos(''A'' &amp;minus; ''B'').
:* [[symmedian point]] = ''a'' : ''b'' : ''c'' = sin ''A'' : sin ''B'' : sin ''C''.
:* ''A''-excenter = &amp;minus;1 : 1 : 1
:* ''B''-excenter = 1 : &amp;minus;1 : 1
:* ''C''-excenter = 1 : 1 : &amp;minus;1.

Note that, in general, the incenter is not the same as the [[centroid]]; the centroid has [[Barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]] 1 : 1 : 1 (these being proportional to actual signed areas of the triangles ''BGC'', ''CGA'', ''AGB'', where ''G'' = centroid.)

The midpoint of, for example, side ''BC'' has trilinear coordinates in actual sideline distances  &lt;math&gt;(0 , \frac{\Delta}{b} , \frac{\Delta}{c}) &lt;/math&gt; for triangle area &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;, which in arbitrarily specified relative distances simplifies to &lt;math&gt;0:ca:ab.&lt;/math&gt; The coordinates in actual sideline distances of the foot of the altitude from ''A'' to ''BC'' are &lt;math&gt;(0, \frac{2\Delta}{a}\cos C, \frac{2\Delta}{a}\cos B),&lt;/math&gt; which in purely relative distances simplifies to &lt;math&gt;0:\cos C:\cos B.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 96}}

==Formulas==

===Collinearities and concurrencies===

Trilinear coordinates enable many algebraic methods in triangle geometry.  For example, three points

:''P = p'' : ''q'' : ''r''
:''U = u'' : ''v'' : ''w''
:''X = x'' : ''y'' : ''z''

are [[collinearity|collinear]] if and only if the [[determinant]]

:&lt;math&gt; D = \begin{vmatrix}p&amp;q&amp;r\\
u&amp;v&amp;w\\x&amp;y&amp;z\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

equals zero.  Thus if ''x:y:z'' is a variable point, the equation of a line through the points ''P'' and ''U'' is ''D'' = 0.&lt;ref name=WW&gt;William Allen Whitworth (1866) [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;idno=01190002 Trilinear Coordinates and Other Methods of Analytical Geometry of Two Dimensions: an elementary treatise], link from [[Cornell University]] Historical Math Monographs.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 23}} From this, every straight line has a linear equation homogeneous in ''x, y, z''.  Every equation of the form ''lx+my+nz'' = 0 in real coefficients is a real straight line of finite points unless ''l : m: n'' is proportional to ''a : b : c'', the side lengths, in which case we have the locus of points at infinity.&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 40}}

The dual of this proposition is that the lines

:''pα + qβ + rγ = 0''
:''uα + vβ + wγ = 0'',
:''xα + yβ + zγ = 0''

[[concurrent lines|concur]] in a point (α, β, γ) if and only if ''D'' = 0.&lt;ref name="WW"/&gt;{{rp|p. 28}}

Also, if the actual directed distances are used when evaluating the determinant of ''D'', then the area of triangle ''PUX'' is ''KD'', where ''K'' = ''abc/8∆''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt; (and where ''∆'' is the area of triangle ''ABC'', as above) if triangle ''PUX'' has the same orientation (clockwise or counterclockwise) as triangle ''ABC'', and ''K'' = ''–abc/8∆''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt; otherwise.

===Parallel lines===

Two lines with trilinear equations &lt;math&gt;lx+my+nz=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l'x+m'y+n'z=0&lt;/math&gt; are parallel if and only if&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 98,#xi}}

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{vmatrix}l&amp;m&amp;n\\
l'&amp;m'&amp;n'\\a&amp;b&amp;c\end{vmatrix}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a, b, c'' are the side lengths.

===Angle between two lines===

The [[tangent (trigonometry)|tangents]] of the angles between two lines with trilinear equations &lt;math&gt;lx+my+nz=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l'x+m'y+n'z=0&lt;/math&gt; are given by&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p.50}}

:&lt;math&gt;\pm \frac{(mn'-m'n)\sin A + (nl'-n'l)\sin B + (lm'-l'm)\sin C}{ll' + mm' + nn' - (mn'+m'n)\cos A -(nl'+n'l)\cos B - (lm'+l'm)\cos C}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Perpendicular lines====

Thus two lines with trilinear equations &lt;math&gt;lx+my+nz=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l'x+m'y+n'z=0&lt;/math&gt; are perpendicular if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;ll'+mm'+nn'-(mn'+m'n)\cos A-(nl'+n'l)\cos B-(lm'+l'm)\cos C=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Altitude===

The equation of the [[altitude (geometry)|altitude]] from vertex ''A'' to side ''BC'' is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p.98,#x}}

:&lt;math&gt;y\cos B-z\cos C=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Line in terms of distances from vertices===

The equation of a line with variable distances ''p, q, r'' from the vertices ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' whose opposite sides are ''a, b, c'' is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 97,#viii}}

:&lt;math&gt;apx+bqy+crz=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Actual-distance trilinear coordinates===

The trilinears with the coordinate values ''a', b', c' ''  being the actual perpendicular distances to the sides satisfy&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 11}}

:&lt;math&gt;aa' +bb' + cc' =2\Delta&lt;/math&gt;

for triangle sides ''a, b, c'' and area &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;. This can be seen in the figure at the top of this article, with interior point ''P'' partitioning triangle ''ABC'' into three triangles ''PBC'', ''PCA'', and ''PAB'' with respective areas (1/2)''aa' '', (1/2)''bb' '', and (1/2)''cc' ''.

===Distance between two points===

The distance ''d'' between two points with actual-distance trilinears ''a' ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''b' ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''c' ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is given by&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 46}}

:&lt;math&gt;d^2\sin ^2 C=(a'_1-a'_2)^2+(b'_1-b'_2)^2+2(a'_1-a'_2)(b'_1-b'_2)\cos C.&lt;/math&gt;

===Distance from a point to a line===

The distance ''d'' from a point ''a' ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : ''b' ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : ''c' ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, in trilinear coordinates of actual distances, to a straight line ''lx + my + nz'' = 0 is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 48}}

:&lt;math&gt;d=\frac{la'_0+mb'_0+nc'_0}{\sqrt{l^2+m^2+n^2-2mn\cos A -2nl\cos B -2lm\cos C}}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Quadratic curves===

The equation of a [[conic section]] in the variable trilinear point ''x'' : ''y'' : ''z'' is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p.118}}

:&lt;math&gt;rx^2+sy^2+tz^2+2uyz+2vzx+2wxy=0.&lt;/math&gt;

It has no linear terms and no constant term.

The equation of a circle of radius ''r'' having center at actual-distance coordinates (''a', b', c' '') is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p.287}}

:&lt;math&gt;(x-a')^2\sin 2A+(y-b')^2\sin 2B+(z-c')^2\sin 2C=2r^2\sin A\sin B\sin C.&lt;/math&gt;

====Circumconics====

The equation in trilinear coordinates ''x, y, z'' of any [[circumconic]] of a triangle is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 192}}

:&lt;math&gt;lyz+mzx+nxy=0.&lt;/math&gt;

If the parameters ''l, m, n'' respectively equal the side lengths ''a, b, c'' (or the sines of the angles opposite them) then the equation gives the [[circumcircle]].&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 199}}

Each distinct circumconic has a center unique to itself. The equation in trilinear coordinates of the circumconic with center ''x' :  y' : z' '' is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 203}}

:&lt;math&gt;yz(x'-y'-z')+zx(y'-z'-x')+xy(z'-x'-y')=0.&lt;/math&gt;

====Inconics====

Every conic section [[inscribed figure|inscribed]] in a triangle has an equation in trilinear coordinates&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 208}}

:&lt;math&gt;l^2x^2+m^2y^2+n^2z^2 \pm 2mnyz \pm 2nlzx\pm 2lmxy =0,&lt;/math&gt;

with exactly one or three of the unspecified signs being negative.

The equation of the [[incircle]] can be simplified to&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 210, p.214}}

:&lt;math&gt;\pm \sqrt{x}\cos \frac{A}{2}\pm \sqrt{y}\cos \frac{B}{2}\pm\sqrt{z}\cos \frac{C}{2}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

while the equation for, for example, the [[excircle]] adjacent to the side segment opposite vertex ''A'' can be written as&lt;ref name= WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 215}}

:&lt;math&gt;\pm \sqrt{-x}\cos \frac{A}{2}\pm \sqrt{y}\cos \frac{B}{2}\pm\sqrt{z}\cos \frac{C}{2}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Cubic curves===
Many cubic curves are easily represented using trilinear coordinates.  For example, the pivotal self-isoconjugate cubic ''Z(U,P)'', as the locus of a point ''X'' such that the ''P''-isoconjugate of ''X'' is on the line ''UX'' is given by the determinant equation

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{vmatrix}x&amp;y&amp;z\\
qryz&amp;rpzx&amp;pqxy\\u&amp;v&amp;w\end{vmatrix} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Among named cubics ''Z(U,P)'' are the following:

: Thomson cubic: ''Z(X(2),X(1))'', where ''X(2) = ''[[centroid]], ''X(1) = ''[[incenter]]
: Feuerbach cubic: ''Z(X(5),X(1))'', where ''X(5) = ''[[Feuerbach point]]
: Darboux cubic: ''Z(X(20),X(1))'', where ''X(20) = ''[[De Longchamps point]]
: Neuberg cubic: ''Z(X(30),X(1))'', where ''X(30) = ''[[Euler infinity point]].

==Conversions==

===Between trilinear coordinates and distances from sidelines===

For any choice of trilinear coordinates ''x:y:z'' to locate a point, the actual distances of the point from the sidelines are given by ''a' = kx'', ''b' = ky'', ''c' = kz'' where ''k'' can be determined by the formula &lt;math&gt;k = \frac{2\Delta}{ax + by + cz}&lt;/math&gt; in which ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are the respective sidelengths ''BC'', ''CA'', ''AB'', and ∆ is the area of ''ABC''.

===Between barycentric and trilinear coordinates===
A point with trilinear coordinates ''x'' : ''y'' : ''z'' has [[barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]] ''ax'' : ''by'' : ''cz'' where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are the sidelengths of the triangle.  Conversely, a point with barycentrics ''α'' : ''β'' : ''γ'' has trilinear coordinates ''α/a'' : ''β/b'' : ''γ/c''.

===Between Cartesian and trilinear coordinates===
Given a reference triangle ''ABC'', express the position of the vertex ''B'' in terms of an ordered pair of [[Cartesian coordinates]] and represent this algebraically as a [[vector (geometric)|vector]] &lt;u&gt;''B''&lt;/u&gt;, using vertex ''C'' as the origin. Similarly define the position vector of vertex ''A'' as &lt;u&gt;''A''&lt;/u&gt;. Then any point ''P'' associated with the reference triangle ''ABC'' can be defined in a Cartesian system as a vector &lt;u&gt;''P''&lt;/u&gt; = ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;u&gt;''A''&lt;/u&gt; + ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;u&gt;''B''&lt;/u&gt;. If this point ''P'' has trilinear coordinates ''x : y : z'' then the conversion formula from the coefficients ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the Cartesian representation to the trilinear coordinates is, for side lengths ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' opposite vertices ''A'', ''B'', ''C'',

: &lt;math&gt;x:y:z = \frac{k_1}{a} : \frac{k_2}{b} : \frac{1 - k_1 - k_2}{c}, &lt;/math&gt;

and the conversion formula from the trilinear coordinates to the coefficients in the Cartesian representation is

: &lt;math&gt;k_1 = \frac{ax}{ax + by + cz}, \quad k_2 = \frac{by}{ax + by + cz}.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if an arbitrary origin is chosen where the Cartesian coordinates of the vertices are known and represented by the vectors &lt;u&gt;''A''&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;''B''&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;''C''&lt;/u&gt; and if the point ''P'' has trilinear coordinates ''x'' : ''y'' : ''z'', then the Cartesian coordinates of &lt;u&gt;''P''&lt;/u&gt; are the weighted average of the Cartesian coordinates of these vertices using the barycentric coordinates ''ax'', ''by'' and ''cz'' as the weights. Hence the conversion formula from the trilinear coordinates ''x, y, z''  to the vector of Cartesian coordinates &lt;u&gt;''P''&lt;/u&gt; of the point is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\underline{P}=\frac{ax}{ax+by+cz}\underline{A}+\frac{by}{ax+by+cz}\underline{B}+\frac{cz}{ax+by+cz}\underline{C},&lt;/math&gt;
where the side lengths are |&lt;u&gt;''C''&lt;/u&gt; − &lt;u&gt;''B''&lt;/u&gt;| = ''a'', |&lt;u&gt;''A''&lt;/u&gt; − &lt;u&gt;''C''&lt;/u&gt;| = ''b'' and |&lt;u&gt;''B''&lt;/u&gt; − &lt;u&gt;''A''&lt;/u&gt;| = ''c''.

In [[mathematics]], a '''weak derivative''' is a generalization of the concept of the [[derivative]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] (''strong derivative'') for functions not assumed [[Differentiable function|differentiable]], but only [[Integrable function|integrable]], i.e., to lie in the [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{L}^1([a,b])&lt;/math&gt;.  See [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]s for a more general definition.

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; be a function in the [[Lp space|Lebesgue space]] &lt;math&gt;L^1([a,b])&lt;/math&gt;. We say that &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;   in &lt;math&gt;L^1([a,b])&lt;/math&gt; is a ''weak derivative'' of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; if,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b u(t)\varphi'(t)dt=-\int_a^b v(t)\varphi(t)dt&lt;/math&gt;

for '''all''' infinitely [[differentiable function]]s &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\varphi(a)=\varphi(b)=0&lt;/math&gt;. This definition is motivated by the integration technique of [[Integration by parts]].

Generalizing to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; dimensions, if &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are in the space &lt;math&gt;L_{loc}^1(U)&lt;/math&gt; of [[locally integrable function]]s for some [[open set]] &lt;math&gt;U \subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a [[multi-index]], we say that &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;\alpha^{th}&lt;/math&gt;-weak derivative of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; if

:&lt;math&gt;\int_U u D^{\alpha} \varphi=(-1)^{|\alpha|} \int_U v\varphi,&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;\varphi \in C^{\infty}_c (U)&lt;/math&gt;, that is, for all infinitely differentiable functions &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; with [[compact support]] in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt; D^{\alpha}\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; \qquad D^{\alpha}\varphi = \frac{\partial^{| \alpha |} \varphi }{\partial x_{1}^{\alpha_{1}} \dots \partial x_{n}^{\alpha_{n}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; has a weak derivative, it is often written &lt;math&gt;D^{\alpha}u&lt;/math&gt; since weak derivatives are unique (at least, up to a set of [[measure zero]], see below).

== Examples ==
*The [[absolute value]] function ''u''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;1]&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1], ''u''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|''t''|, which is not differentiable at ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, has a weak derivative ''v'' known as the [[sign function]] given by

:&lt;math&gt;v \colon [-1,1]\to [-1,1] ; \quad t \mapsto v(t) = \begin{cases} 1, &amp; \mbox{if } t &gt; 0; \\ 0, &amp; \mbox{if } t = 0; \\ -1, &amp; \mbox{if } t &lt; 0. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

:This is not the only weak derivative for ''u'': any ''w'' that is equal to ''v'' [[almost everywhere]] is also a weak derivative for ''u''.  Usually, this is not a problem, since in the theory of [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces]] and [[Sobolev space]]s, functions that are equal almost everywhere are identified.

*The [[indicator function|characteristic function]] of the rational numbers &lt;math&gt; 1_{\mathbb{Q}} &lt;/math&gt; is nowhere differentiable yet has a weak derivative.  Since the [[Lebesgue measure]] of the rational numbers is zero,

::&lt;math&gt; \int 1_{\mathbb{Q}}(t) \varphi(t) dt = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

:Thus &lt;math&gt; v(t)=0 &lt;/math&gt; is the weak derivative of &lt;math&gt; 1_{\mathbb{Q}} &lt;/math&gt;.  Note that this does agree with our intuition since when considered as a member of an Lp space, &lt;math&gt; 1_{\mathbb{Q}} &lt;/math&gt; is identified with the zero function.

*The [[Cantor function]] ''c'' does not have a weak derivative, despite being differentiable almost everywhere. This is because any weak derivative of ''c'' would have to be equal almost everywhere to the classical derivative of ''c'', which is zero almost everywhere. But the zero function is not a weak derivative of ''c'', as can be seen by comparing against an appropriate test function &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. More theoretically, ''c'' does not have a weak derivative because its [[distributional derivative]], namely the [[Cantor distribution]], is a [[singular measure]] and therefore cannot be represented by a function.

== Properties ==

If two functions are weak derivatives of the same function, they are equal except on a set with [[Lebesgue measure]] zero, i.e., they are equal [[almost everywhere]].  If we consider [[equivalence classes]] of functions such that two functions are equivalent if they are equal almost everywhere, then the weak derivative is unique.

Also, if ''u'' is differentiable in the conventional sense then its weak derivative is identical (in the sense given above) to its conventional (strong) derivative.  Thus the weak derivative is a generalization of the strong one.  Furthermore, the classical rules for derivatives of sums and products of functions also hold for the weak derivative.

== Extensions ==

This concept gives rise to the definition of [[weak solution]]s in [[Sobolev space]]s, which are useful for problems of [[differential equations]] and in [[functional analysis]].

[[File:LabeledTriangle.svg|thumb|right|220px|According to Weitzenböck's inequality, the [[area]] of this [[triangle]] is at most {{math|(''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) ⁄ 4√{{overline|3}}.}}]]

In [[mathematics]], '''Weitzenböck's inequality''', named after [[Roland Weitzenböck]], states that for a triangle of side lengths &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, and area &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;, the following inequality holds:

: &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq 4\sqrt{3}\, \Delta &lt;/math&gt;.

Equality occurs if and only if the triangle is equilateral. [[Pedoe's inequality]]  is a generalization of Weitzenböck's inequality. The [[Hadwiger-Finsler inequality]] is a strengthened version of Weitzenböck's inequality.

==Geometric interpretation and proof==
Rewriting the inequality above allows for a more concrete geometric interpretation, which in turn provides an immediate proof.

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}b^2 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}c^2 \geq 3\, \Delta &lt;/math&gt;.

Now the summands on the left side are the areas of equilateral triangles erected over the sides of the original triangle and hence the equations states that the sum of areas of the equilateral triangles is always greater or equal than the threefold area of the original triangle.

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta_a + \Delta_b + \Delta_c \geq 3\, \Delta &lt;/math&gt;.

This can now can be shown by replicating area of the triangle three times within the equilateral triangles. To achieve that the [[Fermat point]] is used to partition the triangle into three obtuse subtriangles with a &lt;math&gt;120^\circ&lt;/math&gt; angle and each of those subtriangles is replicated three times within the equilateral triangle next to it. This only works if every angle of the triangle is smaller than &lt;math&gt;120^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, since otherwise the Fermat point is not located in the interior of the triangle and becomes a vertex instead. However if one angle is greater or equal to &lt;math&gt;120^\circ&lt;/math&gt; it is possible to replicate the whole triangle three times within the largest equilateral triangle, so the sum of areas of all equilateral triangles stays greater than the threefold area of the triangle anyhow.

== Further proofs ==
The proof of this inequality was set as a question in the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] of 1961. Even so, the result is not too difficult to derive using [[Heron's formula]] for the area of a triangle:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Delta &amp; {} =\frac{1}{4}\sqrt{(a+b+c)(a+b-c)(b+c-a)(c+a-b)} \\
&amp; {} =\frac{1}{4}\sqrt{2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)-(a^4+b^4+c^4)}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== First method ===

It can be shown that the area of the inner [[Napoleon's triangle]], which must be nonnegative, is&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, H.S.M., and  Greitzer, Samuel L. ''Geometry Revisited'', page 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{3}}{24}(a^2+b^2+c^2-4\sqrt{3}\Delta),&lt;/math&gt;

so the expression in parentheses must be greater than or equal to 0.

=== Second method ===

This method assumes no knowledge of inequalities except that all squares are nonnegative.

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
{} &amp; (a^2 - b^2)^2 + (b^2 - c^2)^2 + (c^2 - a^2)^2 \geq 0 \\
{} \iff &amp; 2(a^4+b^4+c^4) - 2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2) \geq 0 \\
{} \iff &amp; \frac{4(a^4+b^4+c^4)}{3} \geq \frac{4(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)}{3} \\
{} \iff &amp; \frac{(a^4+b^4+c^4) + 2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)}{3} \geq 2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)-(a^4+b^4+c^4) \\
{} \iff &amp; \frac{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2}{3} \geq (4\Delta)^2,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the result follows immediately by taking the positive square root of both sides. From the first inequality we can also see that equality occurs only when &lt;math&gt;a = b = c&lt;/math&gt; and the triangle is equilateral.

===Third method===

This proof assumes knowledge of the [[AM–GM inequality]].

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; &amp; (a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2 &amp; \geq &amp; &amp; 0 \\
\Rightarrow &amp; &amp; 2a^2+2b^2+2c^2 &amp; \geq &amp; &amp; 2ab+2bc+2ac \\
\iff &amp; &amp; 3(a^2+b^2+c^2) &amp; \geq &amp; &amp; (a + b + c)^2 \\
\iff &amp; &amp; a^2+b^2+c^2 &amp; \geq &amp; &amp; \sqrt{3(a+b+c)\left(\frac{a+b+c}{3}\right)^3} \\
\Rightarrow &amp; &amp; a^2+b^2+c^2 &amp; \geq &amp; &amp; \sqrt{3 (a+b+c)(-a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c)} \\
\iff &amp; &amp; a^2+b^2+c^2 &amp; \geq &amp; &amp; 4 \sqrt3 \Delta.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

As we have used the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality, equality only occurs when &lt;math&gt;a = b = c&lt;/math&gt; and the triangle is equilateral.

[[File:2 Helium.png|thumb|[[Liquid helium]] retains [[kinetic energy]] and does not freeze regardless of temperature due to zero-point energy. When cooled below its [[Lambda point]], it exhibits properties of [[superfluidity]]]]
{{Quantum mechanics}}
'''Zero-point energy''' ('''ZPE''') is the difference between the lowest possible [[energy]] that a [[quantum mechanical]] system may have, and the classical minimum energy of the system. Unlike in [[classical mechanics]], quantum systems constantly fluctuate in their lowest energy state due to the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref name="Sciama 1991 137"&gt;{{harvp|Sciama|1991|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as atoms and molecules, the empty space of [[Vacuum state|the vacuum]] has these properties. According to [[quantum field theory]], the universe can be thought of not as isolated particles but continuous fluctuating fields: matter fields, whose [[Quantum|quanta]] are [[fermions]] (i.e. [[lepton]]s and [[quark]]s), and force fields, whose quanta are [[boson]]s (e.g. [[photon]]s and [[gluon]]s). All these fields have zero-point energy.&lt;ref name="Milonni 1994 35"&gt;{{harvp|Milonni|1994|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fluctuating zero-point fields lead to a kind of reintroduction of an [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] in physics,&lt;ref name="Sciama 1991 137"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davies|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; since some systems can detect the existence of this energy. However this aether cannot be thought of as a physical medium if it is to be [[Lorentz invariant]] such that there is no contradiction with [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[special relativity]].&lt;ref name="Sciama 1991 137"/&gt;

Physics currently lacks a full theoretical model for understanding zero-point energy; in particular the discrepancy between theorized and observed vacuum energy is a source of major contention.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Weinberg|1989}} and {{harvp|Peebles|Ratra|2003}} for review articles and  {{harvp|Shiga|2005}}, {{harvp|Siegel|2016}} for press comment&lt;/ref&gt; Physicists [[Richard Feynman]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] calculated the zero-point radiation of the vacuum to be an order of magnitude greater than [[Atomic energy|nuclear energy]], with a single light bulb containing enough energy to boil all the world's oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pilkington|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet according to Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]] any such energy would gravitate {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} and the experimental evidence from both the [[expansion of the universe]], [[dark energy]] and the [[Casimir effect]] show any such energy to be exceptionally weak. A popular proposal that attempts to address this issue is to say that the [[fermion field]] has a negative zero-point energy while the [[boson field]] has positive zero-point energy and thus these energies somehow cancel each other out.&lt;ref name="harvp|Weinberg|2015|p=376"&gt;{{harvp|Weinberg|2015|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sciama 1991 138"&gt;{{harvp|Sciama|1991|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea would be true if [[supersymmetry]] were an exact [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry of nature]]. However, the [[LHC]] at [[CERN]] has so far found no evidence to support [[supersymmetry]]. Moreover, it is known that if supersymmetry is valid at all, it is at most a broken symmetry, only true at very high energies, and no one has been able to show a theory where zero-point cancellations occur in the low energy universe we observe today.&lt;ref name="Sciama 1991 138"/&gt; This discrepancy is known as the [[cosmological constant problem]] and it is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in physics. Many physicists believe that "the vacuum holds the key to a full understanding of nature".&lt;ref name="harvp|Davies|1985|p=104"&gt;{{harvp|Davies|1985|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and terminology==
The term '''zero-point energy (ZPE)''' [[Calque|is a translation]] from the German '''Nullpunktsenergie.'''&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Einstein|1995|pp=270-285}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The terms '''zero-point radiation''' or '''ground state energy''' are also sometimes used interchangeably. The term '''zero-point field''' ('''ZPF''') can be used when referring to a specific vacuum field, for instance the [[QED vacuum]] which specifically deals with [[quantum electrodynamics]] (e.g. electromagnetic interactions between photons, electrons and the vacuum) or the [[QCD vacuum]] which deals with [[quantum chromodynamics]] (e.g. [[color charge]] interactions between quarks, gluons and the vacuum). A vacuum can be viewed not as empty space but as the combination of all zero-point fields. In [[quantum field theory]] this combination of fields is called the [[vacuum state]], its associated zero-point energy is called the [[vacuum energy]] and the average energy value  is called the [[vacuum expectation value]] (VEV) also called its '''condensate'''.

==Overview==
[[File:Zero-point energy v.s. motion.jpg|thumb|right|Kinetic energy vs temperature.]]
In [[classical mechanics]] all [[particle]]s can be thought of as having some [[energy]] made up of their [[potential energy]] and [[kinetic energy]]. [[Temperature]], for example, arises from the intensity of random particle motion caused by kinetic energy (known as [[brownian motion]]). As temperature is reduced to [[absolute zero]], it might be thought that all motion ceases and particles come completely to rest. In fact, however, kinetic energy is retained by particles even at the lowest possible temperature. The random motion corresponding to this zero-point energy never vanishes as a consequence of the [[uncertainty principle]] of [[quantum mechanics]].

[[File:Zero-point energy of harmonic oscillator.svg|thumb|left|Zero-point radiation continually imparts random impulses on an [[electron]], so that it never comes to a complete stop. Zero-point radiation gives the [[Harmonic oscillator|oscillator]] an average energy equal to the frequency of oscillation multiplied by one-half of [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]]]]
The uncertainty principle states that no object can ever have precise values of position and velocity simultaneously. The total energy of a quantum mechanical object (potential and kinetic) is described by its [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] which also describes the system as a harmonic oscillator, or [[wave function]], that fluctuates between various energy states (see [[wave-particle duality]]). All quantum mechanical systems undergo fluctuations even in their ground state, a consequence of their [[wave]]-like nature. The uncertainty principle requires every quantum mechanical system to have a fluctuating zero-point energy greater than the minimum of its classical [[potential well]]. This results in motion even at [[absolute zero]]. For example, [[liquid helium]] does not freeze under atmospheric pressure regardless of temperature due to its zero-point energy.

Given the equivalence of mass and energy expressed by [[Einstein]]'s [[E = mc2|{{math|''E'' {{=}} ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}]], any point in [[Spacetime|space]] that contains energy can be thought of as having mass to create particles. [[Virtual particles]] spontaneously flash into existence at every point in space due to the energy of [[quantum fluctuations]] caused by the uncertainty principle. Modern physics has developed [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) to understand the fundamental interactions between matter and forces, it treats every single point of space as a [[Harmonic oscillator (quantum)|quantum harmonic oscillator]]. According to QFT the universe is made up of matter fields, whose [[Quantum|quanta]] are [[fermions]] (i.e. [[lepton]]s and [[quark]]s), and force fields, whose quanta are [[boson]]s (e.g. [[photon]]s and [[gluon]]s). All these fields have zero-point energy.&lt;ref name="Milonni 1994 35"/&gt; Recent experiments advocate the idea that particles themselves can be thought of as excited states of the underlying [[quantum vacuum]], and that all properties of matter are merely vacuum fluctuations arising from interactions of the zero-point field.&lt;ref name="harvp|Battersby|2008"&gt;{{harvp|Battersby|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that "empty" space can have an intrinsic energy associated to it, and that there is no such thing as a "true vacuum" is seemingly unintuitive. It is often argued that the entire universe is completely bathed in the zero-point radiation, and as such it can add only some constant amount to calculations. Physical measurements will therefore reveal only deviations from this value.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvp|Itzykson|Zuber|1980|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many practical calculations zero-point energy is dismissed by fiat in the mathematical model as a term that has no physical effect. Such treatment causes problems however, as in Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]] the absolute energy value of space is not an arbitrary constant and gives rise to the [[cosmological constant]]. For decades most physicists assumed that there was some undiscovered fundamental principle that will remove the infinite zero-point energy and make it completely vanish. If the vacuum has no intrinsic, absolute value of energy it will not gravitate. It was believed that as the universe expands from the aftermath of the [[big bang]], the energy contained in any unit of empty space will decrease as the total energy spreads out to fill the volume of the universe; [[galaxies]] and all matter in the universe should begin to decelerate. This possibility was ruled out in 1998 by the discovery that the expansion of the universe is not slowing down but is in fact accelerating, meaning empty space does indeed have some intrinsic energy. The discovery of [[dark energy]] is best explained by zero-point energy, though it still remains a mystery as to why the value appears to be so small compared to huge value obtained through theory - the [[cosmological constant problem]].&lt;ref name="harvp|Weinberg|2015|p=376"/&gt;

Many physical effects attributed to zero-point energy have been experimentally verified, such as [[spontaneous emission]], [[Casimir force]], [[Lamb shift]], [[Electron magnetic moment|magnetic moment of the electron]] and [[Delbrück scattering]],&lt;ref name="harvp|Milonni|1994|p=111"&gt;{{harvp|Milonni|1994|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Greiner|Müller|Rafelski|2012|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; these effects are usually called "radiative corrections".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bordag et al.|2009|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In more complex nonlinear theories (e.g. QCD) zero-point energy can give rise to a variety of complex phenomena such as [[Bistability|multiple stable states]], [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry breaking]], [[chaos theory|chaos]] and [[emergence]]. Many physicists believe that "the vacuum holds the key to a full understanding of nature"&lt;ref name="harvp|Davies|1985|p=104"/&gt; and that studying it is critical in the search for the [[theory of everything]]. Active areas of research include the effects of virtual particles,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cho|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[quantum entanglement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Choi|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the difference (if any) between [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial and gravitational mass]],&lt;ref name="Haisch et al. 1994"&gt;See {{harvp|Haisch|Rueda|Puthoff|1994}} for proposal and {{harvs|txt|last1=Matthews|year1=1994|year2=1995}}, {{harvp|Powell|1994}} and {{harvp|Davies|1994}} for comment&lt;/ref&gt; variation in the [[speed of light]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Urban et al.|2013}}, {{harvp|Leuchs|Sánchez-Soto|2013}} and {{harvp|O'Carroll|2013}} for comment&lt;/ref&gt; a reason for the observed value of the [[cosmological constant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rugh|Zinkernagel|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the nature of [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name="Dark Energy May Be Vacuum"&gt;{{harvp|Niels Bohr Institute|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="space.com"&gt;{{harvp|Wall|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early aether theories===
[[File:James Clerk Maxwell.png|thumb|upright|James Clerk Maxwell]]
Zero-point energy evolved from historical ideas about the [[vacuum]]. To [[Aristotle]] the vacuum was {{lang|grc|τὸ κενόν}}, "the empty"; space independent of body. He believed this concept violated basic physical principles and asserted that [[Classical element#Greece|the elements]] of fire, air, earth, and water were not made of atoms, but were continuous. To the [[atomists]] the concept of emptiness had absolute character: it was the distinction between existence and nonexistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Saunders| Brown|1991|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debate about the characteristics of the vacuum were largely confined to the realm of [[philosophy]], it was not until much later on with the beginning of [[Renaissance|the renaissance]], that [[Otto von Guericke]] invented the first vacuum pump and the first testable scientific ideas began to emerge. It was thought that a totally empty volume of space could be created by simply removing all gases. This was the first generally accepted concept of the vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Conlon|2011|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the 19th century, however, it became apparent that the evacuated region still contained [[thermal radiation]]. The existence of the [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] as a substitute for a true void was the most prevalent theory of the time. According to the successful [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] aether theory based upon [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell's]] [[electrodynamics]], this all-encompassing aether was endowed with energy and hence very different from nothingness. The fact that electromagnetic and gravitational phenomena were easily transmitted in empty space indicated that their associated aethers were part of the fabric of space itself. Maxwell himself noted that:

{{bquote|To those who maintained the existence of a plenum as a philosophical principle, nature's abhorrence of a vacuum was a sufficient reason for imagining an all-surrounding aether... Aethers were invented for the planets to swim in, to constitute electric atmospheres and magnetic effluvia, to convey sensations from one part of our bodies to another, and so on, till a space had been filled three or four times with aethers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kragh|Overduin|2014|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the results of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] in 1887 were the first strong evidence that the then-prevalent aether theories were seriously flawed, and initiated a line of research that eventually led to [[special relativity]], which ruled out the idea of a stationary aether altogether. To scientists of the period, it seemed that a true vacuum in space might be completely eliminated by cooling thus eliminating all radiation or energy. From this idea evolved the second concept of achieving a real vacuum: cool it down to [[absolute zero]] temperature after evacuation. Absolute zero was technically impossible to achieve in the 19th century, so the debate remained unsolved.

===Second quantum theory===
[[File:Max Planck (Nobel 1918).jpg|thumb|upright|Planck in 1918, the year he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his work on [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]]]
In 1900, [[Max Planck]] derived the average energy {{mvar|ε}} of a single ''energy radiator'', e.g., a vibrating atomic unit, as a function of absolute temperature:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Planck|1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon = \frac{h\nu}{ e^{h\nu/(kT)}-1} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|h}} is [[Planck's constant]], {{mvar|ν}} is the [[frequency]], {{mvar|k}} is [[Boltzmann's constant]], and {{mvar|T}} is the absolute [[temperature]]. The zero-point energy makes no contribution to Planck's original law, as its existence was unknown to Planck in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Loudon|2000|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of zero-point energy was developed by [[Max Planck]] in Germany in 1911 as a corrective term added to a zero-grounded formula developed in his original quantum theory in 1900.&lt;ref name="Kragh"/&gt;

In 1912, Max Planck published the first journal article&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Planck|1912a}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the discontinuous emission of radiation, based on the discrete quanta of energy. In Planck's "second quantum theory" resonators absorbed energy continuously, but emitted energy in discrete energy quanta only when they reached the boundaries of finite cells in phase space, where their energies became integer multiples of {{math|''hν''}}. This theory led Planck to his new radiation law, but in this version energy resonators possessed a zero-point energy, the smallest average energy a resonator could take on. Planck's radiation equation contained a residual energy factor, one {{math|{{sfrac|''hν''|2}}}}, as an additional term dependent on the frequency {{mvar|ν}}, which was greater than zero (where {{mvar|h}} is Planck's constant). It is therefore widely agreed that "Planck's equation marked the birth of the concept of zero-point energy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Milonni|1994|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of papers from 1911 to 1913,&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvs|last1=Planck|year1=1911|year2=1912a|year3=1912b|year4=1913}} and {{harvp|Planck|1958}} for reprints&lt;/ref&gt; Planck found that the average energy of an oscillator to be:&lt;ref name="Kragh"&gt;{{harvp|Kragh|2012|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhn1987"&gt;{{harvp|Kuhn|1978|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, the idea of zero-point energy attracted the attention of [[Albert Einstein]] and his assistant [[Otto Stern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|last2=Stern|first2=Otto|title=Einige Argumente für die Annahme einer molekularen Agitation beim absoluten Nullpunkt|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=1913|volume=345|issue=3|pages=551–560|doi=10.1002/andp.19133450309|bibcode=1913AnP...345..551E}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 they published a paper that attempted to prove the existence of zero-point energy by calculating the specific heat of hydrogen gas and compared it with the experimental data. However, after assuming they had succeeded, they retracted support for the idea shortly after publication because they found Planck's second theory may not apply to their example. In a letter to [[Paul Ehrenfest]] of the same year Einstein declared zero-point energy “dead as a doornail”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert.|editor1-last=Klein|editor1-first=Martin J.|editor2-last=Kox|editor2-first=A.

In 1916 [[Walther Nernst]] proposed that empty space was filled with zero-point [[electromagnetic radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nernst|first1=Walther|title=Über einen Versuch, von quantentheoretischen Betrachtungen zur Annahme stetiger Energieänderungen zurückzukehren|journal=Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen|date=1916|volume=18|pages=83–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of [[general relativity]] Einstein found the energy density of the vacuum to contribute towards a [[cosmological constant]] in order to obtain static solutions to his field equations; the idea that empty space, or the vacuum, could have some intrinsic energy associated to it had returned, with Einstein stating in 1920:

{{bquote|There is a weighty argument to be adduced in favour of the aether hypothesis. To deny the aether is ultimately to assume that empty space has no physical qualities whatever. The fundamental facts of mechanics do not harmonize with this view... according to the general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical qualities; in this sense, therefore, there exists an aether. According to the general theory of relativity space without aether is unthinkable; for in such space there not only would be no propagation of light, but also no possibility of existence for standards of space and time (measuring-rods and clocks), nor therefore any space-time intervals in the physical sense. But this aether may not be thought of as endowed with the quality characteristic of ponderable media, as consisting of parts which may be tracked through time.

According to classical ideas, the fact that an accelerating charge loses energy by radiating implied that an electron should spiral into the nucleus and that atoms should not be stable. This problem of classical mechanics was nicely summarized by [[James Hopwood Jeans]] in 1915: "There would be a very real difficulty in supposing that the (force) law {{math|{{sfrac|1|''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} held down to the zero values of {{mvar|r}}.

In a joint paper with [[Max Born]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] he considered the field inside a cavity as a superposition of quantum harmonic oscillators.

He was able to obtain the same fluctuation formula that Einstein had obtained in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|title=Zum gegenwärtigen Stand des Strahlungsproblems|journal=Phys.

[[File:Dirac 4.jpg|thumb|upright|Paul Dirac 1933]]
Building on the work of Heisenberg and others [[Paul Dirac]]'s theory of emission and absorption (1927)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dirac|first1=Paul Adrien Maurice|title=The Quantum Theory of the Emission and Absorption of Radiation|journal=Proc.

Dirac's work was seen as crucially important to the emerging field of quantum mechanics; it dealt directly with the process in which "particles" are actually created: [[spontaneous emission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinberg|first1=Steven|title=The Search for Unity: Notes for a History of Quantum Field Theory|journal=Daedalus|date=1977|volume=106|issue=4|page=17|jstor=20024506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dirac described the quantization of the [[electromagnetic field]] as an ensemble of [[harmonic oscillator]]s with the introduction of the concept of [[creation and annihilation operators]] of particles. The theory showed that spontaneous emission depends upon the zero-point energy fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in order to get started.&lt;ref name=Yokoyama,&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In a process in which a photon is annihilated (absorbed), the photon can be thought of as making a transition into the vacuum state. Similarly, when a photon is created (emitted), it is occasionally useful to imagine that the photon has made a transition out of the vacuum state. In the words of Dirac:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dirac|first1=Paul A. M.|title=The Quantum Theory of the Emission and Absorption of Radiation|journal=Proc. Roy. Soc.|date=1927|volume=A114|issue=767|pages=243–265|doi=10.1098/rspa.1927.0039|url=http://www.imotiro.org/repositorio/howto/artigoshistoricosordemcronologica/1927%20-%20DIRAC%201927%20First%20steps%20in%20quantum%20field%20theory%20Invention%20of%20the%20second%20quantization%20method.pdf|accessdate=17 October 2016|bibcode=1927RSPSA.114..243D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote|The light-quantum has the peculiarity that it apparently ceases to exist when it is in one of its stationary states, namely, the zero state, in which its momentum and therefore also its energy, are zero. When a light-quantum is absorbed it can be considered to jump into this zero state, and when one is emitted it can be considered to jump from the zero state to one in which it is physically in evidence, so that it appears to have been created. Since there is no limit to the number of light-quanta that may be created in this way, we must suppose that there are an infinite number of light quanta in the zero state...}}

Contemporary physicists, when asked to give a physical explanation for spontaneous emission, generally invoke the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic field. This view was popularized by [[Victor Weisskopf]] who in 1935 wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weisskopf|first1=Viktor|title=Probleme der neueren Quantentheorie des Elektrons|journal=Naturwissenschaften|date=1935|volume=23|issue=37|pages=631–637|doi=10.1007/BF01492012|bibcode=1935NW.....23..631W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote|From quantum theory there follows the existence of so called zero-point oscillations; for example each oscillator in its lowest is not completely at rest but always is moving about its equilibrium position. Therefore electromagnetic oscillations also can never cease completely. Thus the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field has as its consequence zero point oscillations of the field strength in the lowest energy state, in which there are no light quanta in space... The zero point oscillations act on an electron in the same way as ordinary electrical oscillations do. They can change the eigenstate of the electron, but only in a transition to a state with the lowest energy, since empty space can only take away energy, and not give it up. In this way spontaneous radiation arises as a consequence of the existence of these unique field strengths corresponding to zero point oscillations. Thus spontaneous radiation is induced radiation of light quanta produced by zero point oscillations of empty space}}

This view was also later supported by [[:de:Theodore Welton|Theodore Welton]] (1948),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Welton|first1=Theodore Allen|title=Some observable effects of the quantum-mechanical fluctuations of the electromagnetic field|journal=Physical Review|date=1948|volume=74|issue=9|page=1157|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.74.1157|bibcode=1948PhRv...74.1157W}}&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that spontaneous emission "can be thought of as forced emission taking place under the action of the fluctuating field." This new theory, which Dirac coined [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) predicted a fluctuating zero-point or "vacuum" field existing even in the absence of sources.

Throughout the 1940s improvements in [[microwave]] technology made it possible to take more precise measurements of the shift of the levels of a [[hydrogen atom]], now known as the [[Lamb shift]],&lt;ref name=lamb&gt;

In [[Wolfgang Pauli]]'s 1945 [[Nobel lecture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pauli|first1=Wolfgang|title=Exclusion principle and quantum mechanics|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1945/pauli-lecture.pdf|website=nobelprize.org|publisher=Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences|accessdate=20 October 2016|date=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; he made clear his opposition to the idea of zero-point energy stating "It is clear that this zero-point energy has no physical reality".

At the time, Casimir was studying the properties of "colloidal solutions". These are viscous materials, such as paint and mayonnaise, that contain micron-sized particles in a liquid matrix. The properties of such solutions are determined by [[van der Waals forces]] – long-range, attractive forces that exist between neutral atoms and molecules. One of Casimir's colleagues, Theo Overbeek, realized that the theory that was used at the time to explain van der Waals forces, which had been developed by [[Fritz London]] in 1930,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=R.

Overbeek therefore asked Casimir to investigate the problem. Working with [[Dirk Polder]], Casimir discovered that the interaction between two neutral molecules could be correctly described only if the fact that light travels at a finite speed was taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lambrecht|first1=Astrid|title=The Casimir effect: a force from nothing|date=2002|volume=September|pages=29–32|url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/247728/contributions/1569920/attachments/426300/591724/Casimir_Force_PhysWorld_2002.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2016|publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing|issn=0953-8585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards after a conversation with [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] about zero-point energy, Casimir noticed that this result could be interpreted in terms of vacuum fluctuations. He then asked himself what would happen if there were two mirrors – rather than two molecules – facing each other in a vacuum. It was this work that led to his famous prediction of an attractive force between reflecting plates. The work by Casimir and Polder opened up the way to a unified theory of van der Waals and Casimir forces and a smooth continuum between the two phenomena.

==The uncertainty principle==

{{main|Uncertainty principle}}

Zero-point energy is fundamentally related to the Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=W. Heisenberg|title=Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik|journal =Zeitschrift für Physik|volume=43|issue=3|year=1927|pages=172–198|doi=10.1007/BF01397280|url=http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/bond/papers/corr155.1.html |bibcode = 1927ZPhy...43..172H |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly speaking, the uncertainty principle states that complementary variables (such as a particle's position and momentum, or a field's value and derivative at a point in space) cannot simultaneously be specified precisely by any given quantum state. In particular, there cannot exist a state in which the system simply sits motionless at the bottom of its potential well: for, then, its position and momentum would both be completely determined to arbitrarily great precision. Therefore, instead, the lowest-energy state (the ground state) of the system must have a distribution in position and momentum that satisfies the uncertainty principle−−which implies its energy must be greater than the minimum of the potential well.

Near the bottom of a [[potential well]], the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of a general system (the quantum-mechanical [[operator (physics)|operator]] giving its energy) can be approximated as a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]],
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{H} = V_0 + \tfrac{1}{2} k \left(\hat{x} - x_0\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2m} \hat{p}^2 \,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the minimum of the classical potential well.

The uncertainty principle tells us that
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\left\langle \left(\hat{x} - x_0\right)^2 \right\rangle} \sqrt{\left\langle \hat{p}^2 \right\rangle} \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \,,&lt;/math&gt;
making the [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]]s of the [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy|potential]] terms above satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \tfrac{1}{2} k \left(\hat{x} - x_0\right)^2 \right\rangle \left\langle \frac{1}{2m} \hat{p}^2 \right\rangle \geq \left(\frac{\hbar}{4}\right)^2 \frac{k}{m} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The expectation value of the energy must therefore be at least
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \hat{H} \right\rangle \geq V_0 + \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = V_0 + \frac{\hbar \omega}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ω'' {{=}} {{sqrt|''k''/''m''}}}} is the [[angular frequency]] at which the system oscillates.

A more thorough treatment, showing that the energy of the ground state actually saturates this bound and is exactly {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|''ħω''|2}}}}, requires solving for the ground state of the system.

==Atomic physics==

{{main|ground state}}
[[File:QHO-groundstate-animation-color.gif|thumb|The zero-point energy {{math|''E'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''ħω''|2}}}} causes the ground-state of a harmonic oscillator to advance its phase (color). This has measurable effects when several eigenstates are superimposed.]]

The idea of a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] and its associated energy can apply to either an atom or subatomic particle. In ordinary atomic physics, the zero-point energy is the energy associated with the [[ground state]] of the system. The professional physics literature tends to measure frequency, as denoted by {{mvar|ν}} above, using [[angular frequency]], denoted with {{mvar|ω}} and defined by {{math|''ω'' {{=}} 2''πν''}}. This leads to a convention of writing Planck's constant {{mvar|h}} with a bar through its top ({{mvar|ħ}}) to denote the quantity {{math|{{sfrac|''h''|2π}}}}. In these terms, the most famous such example of zero-point energy is the above {{math|''E'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''ħω''|2}}}} associated with the ground state of the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]. In quantum mechanical terms, the zero-point energy is the [[expectation value]] of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of the system in the ground state.

If more than one ground state exists, they are said to be [[degenerate energy level|degenerate]]. Many systems have degenerate ground states. Degeneracy occurs whenever there exists a [[unitary operator]] which acts non-trivially on a ground state and [[commutator|commutes]] with the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of the system.

According to the [[third law of thermodynamics]], a system at [[absolute zero]] [[temperature]] exists in its ground state; thus, its [[entropy]] is determined by the degeneracy of the ground state. Many systems, such as a perfect [[crystal lattice]], have a unique ground state and therefore have zero entropy at absolute zero. It is also possible for the highest excited state to have [[absolute zero]] [[temperature]] for systems that exhibit [[negative temperature]].

The [[wave function]] of the ground state of a [[particle in a box|particle in a one-dimensional well]] is a half-period [[sine wave]] which goes to zero at the two edges of the well. The energy of the particle is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{h^2 n^2}{8 m L^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|h}} is the [[Planck constant]], {{mvar|m}} is the mass of the particle, {{mvar|n}} is the energy state ({{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}} corresponds to the ground-state energy), and {{mvar|L}} is the width of the well.

==Quantum field theory==
{{Quantum field theory}}
{{main|Vacuum expectation value|Vacuum energy|Vacuum state}}

In [[quantum field theory]] (QFT), the fabric of "empty" space is visualized as consisting of [[field (physics)|fields]], with the field at every point in space and time being a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]], with neighboring oscillators interacting with each other. According to QFT the universe is made up of matter fields whose [[Quantum|quanta]] are [[fermions]] (e.g. [[electron]]s and [[quark]]s) and force fields, whose quanta are [[boson]]s (i.e. [[photon]]s and [[gluon]]s). All these fields have zero-point energy.&lt;ref name="Milonni 1994 35"/&gt; A related term is ''zero-point field'' (ZPF), which is the lowest energy state of a particular field.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vacuum can be viewed, not as empty space, but the combination of all zero-point fields.

In QFT this combination of fields is called the [[vacuum state]], its associated zero-point energy is called the [[vacuum energy]] and the average expectation value of the Hamiltonian is called the [[vacuum expectation value]] (also called condensate or simply VEV). The [[QED vacuum]] is a part of the vacuum state which specifically deals with [[quantum electrodynamics]] (e.g. electromagnetic interactions between photons, electrons and the vacuum) and the [[QCD vacuum]] deals with [[quantum chromodynamics]] (e.g. [[color charge]] interactions between quarks, gluons and the vacuum). Recent experiments advocate the idea that particles themselves can be thought of as excited states of the underlying [[quantum vacuum]], and that all properties of matter are merely vacuum fluctuations arising from interactions with the zero-point field.&lt;ref name="harvp|Battersby|2008"/&gt;

Each point in space makes a contribution of {{math|''E'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''ħω''|2}}}}, resulting in a calculation of infinite zero-point energy in any finite volume; this is one reason [[renormalization]] is needed to make sense of quantum field theories. In [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], the vacuum energy is one possible explanation for the [[cosmological constant]]&lt;ref&gt;

Scientists are not in agreement about how much energy is contained in the vacuum. [[Quantum mechanics]] requires the energy to be large as [[Paul Dirac]] claimed it is, like a [[Dirac sea|sea of energy]]. Other scientists specializing in [[General Relativity]] require the energy to be small enough for [[curvature of space]] to agree with observed [[astronomy]]. The [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] [[uncertainty principle]] allows the energy to be as large as needed to promote quantum actions for a brief moment of time, even if the average energy is small enough to satisfy relativity and flat space. To cope with disagreements, the vacuum energy is described as a [[virtual energy]] [[potential]] of positive and negative energy.&lt;ref&gt;

In quantum [[perturbation theory]], it is sometimes said that the contribution of [[one-loop]] and multi-loop [[Feynman diagram]]s to [[elementary particle]] [[propagator]]s are the contribution of [[quantum fluctuation|vacuum fluctuation]]s, or the zero-point energy to the particle [[mass]]es.

===The quantum electrodynamic vacuum===

{{main|QED vacuum}}

The oldest and best known quantized force field is the [[electromagnetic field]]. [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell's]] [[Maxwell's equations|equations]] have been superseded by [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED). By considering the zero-point energy that arises from QED it is possible to gain a characteristic understanding of zero-point energy that arises not just through electromagnetic interactions but in all [[quantum field theories]].

====Redefining the zero of energy====
In the quantum theory of the electromagnetic field, classical wave amplitudes {{mvar|α}} and {{math|''α''*}} are replaced by operators {{mvar|a}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}} that satisfy:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[a,a^\dagger\right] = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The classical quantity {{math|{{abs|''α''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} appearing in the classical expression for the energy of a field mode is replaced in quantum theory by the photon number operator {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;''a''}}. The fact that:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[a,a^\dagger a\right] \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;

implies that quantum theory does not allow states of the radiation field for which the photon number and a field amplitude can be precisely defined, i.e., we cannot have simultaneous eigenstates for {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;''a''}} and {{mvar|a}}. The reconciliation of wave and particle attributes of the field is accomplished via the association of a probability amplitude with a classical mode pattern. The calculation of field modes is entirely classical problem, while the quantum properties of the field are carried by the mode "amplitudes" {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{mvar|a}} associated with these classical modes.

The zero-point energy of the field arises formally from the non-commutativity of {{mvar|a}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This is true for any harmonic oscillator: the zero-point energy {{math|{{sfrac|''ħω''|2}}}} appears when we write the Hamiltonian:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H_{cl} &amp;= \frac{p^2}{2m} + \tfrac{1}{2} m \omega^2 {p}^2 \\
&amp;= \tfrac{1}{2} \hbar \omega \left(a a^\dagger + a^\dagger a\right) \\
&amp;=\hbar \omega \left(a^\dagger a +\tfrac{1}{2}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

It is often argued that the entire universe is completed bathed in the zero-point electromagnetic field, and as such it can add only some constant amount to expectation values. Physical measurements will therefore reveal only deviations from the vacuum state. Thus the zero-point energy can be dropped from the Hamiltonian by redefining the zero of energy, or by arguing that it is a constant and therefore has no effect on Heisenberg equations of motion. Thus we can choose to declare by fiat that the ground state has zero energy and a field Hamiltonian, for example, can be replaced by:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H_F - \left\langle 0|H_F|0\right\rangle &amp;=\tfrac{1}{2} \hbar \omega \left(a a^\dagger + a^\dagger a\right)-\tfrac{1}{2}\hbar \omega \\
&amp;= \hbar \omega \left(a^\dagger a + \tfrac{1}{2} \right)-\tfrac{1}{2}\hbar \omega \\
&amp;= \hbar \omega a^\dagger a
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

without affecting any physical predictions of the theory. The new Hamiltonian is said to be [[Normal order|normally ordered]] (or Wick ordered) and is denoted by a double-dot symbol. The normally ordered Hamiltonian is denoted {{math|:''H&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, i.e.:

:&lt;math&gt;:H_F : \equiv \hbar \omega \left(a a^\dagger + a^\dagger a\right) : \equiv \hbar \omega a^\dagger a&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, within the normal ordering symbol we can commute {{mvar|a}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Since zero-point energy is intimately connected to the non-commutativity of {{mvar|a}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the normal ordering procedure eliminates any contribution from the zero-point field. This is especially reasonable in the case of the field Hamiltonian, since the zero-point term merely adds a constant energy which can be eliminated by a simple redefinition for the zero of energy. Moreover, this constant energy in the Hamiltonian obviously commutes with {{mvar|a}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}} and so cannot have any effect on the quantum dynamics described by the Heisenberg equations of motion.

However, things are not quite that simple. The zero-point energy cannot be eliminated by dropping its energy from the Hamiltonian: When we do this and solve the Heisenberg equation for a field operator, we must include the vacuum field, which is the homogeneous part of the solution for the field operator. In fact we can show that the vacuum field is essential for the preservation of the commutators and the formal consistent of [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]]. When we calculate the field energy we obtain not only a contribution from particles and forces that may be present but also a contribution from the vacuum field itself i.e. the zero-point field energy. In other words, the zero-point energy reappears even though we may have deleted it from the Hamiltonian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Milonni|1994|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The electromagnetic field in free space====
From Maxwell's equations, the electromagnetic energy of a "free" field i.e. one with no sources, is described by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H_F &amp;= \frac{1}{8\pi}\int d^3r \left(\mathbf{E}^2 +\mathbf{B}^2\right) \\
&amp;=\frac{k^2}{2\pi}|\alpha (t)|^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We introduce the "mode function" {{math|'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''r''')}} that satisfies the Helmholtz equation:

:&lt;math&gt; \left( \nabla^2 + k^2 \right) \mathbf{A}_0(\mathbf{r}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''k'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''ω''|''c''}}}} and assume it is normalized such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\int d^3r \left|\mathbf{A}_0(\mathbf{r})\right|^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

We wish to "quantize" the electromagnetic energy of free space for a multimode field. The field intensity of free space should be independent of position such that {{math|{{abs|'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''r''')}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} should be independent of {{math|'''r'''}} for each mode of the field. The mode function satisfying these conditions is:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}_0(\mathbf{r}) = e_{\mathbf{k}}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''k''' · '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} in order to have the transversality condition {{math|'''∇''' · '''A'''('''r''',''t'')}} satisfied for the Coulomb gauge{{dubious|date=May 2018}} in which we are working.

To achieve the desired normalization we pretend space is divided into cubes of volume {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''L''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and impose on the field the periodic boundary condition:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}(x+L,y+L,z+L,t)=\mathbf{A}(x,y,z,t)&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently

:&lt;math&gt; \left(k_x,k_y,k_z\right)=\frac{2\pi}{L}\left(n_x,n_y,n_z\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|n}} can assume any integer value. This allows us to consider the field in any one of the imaginary cubes and to define the mode function:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}_\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r})= \frac{1}\sqrt{V} e_{\mathbf{k}}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

which satisfies the Helmholtz equation, transversality, and the "box normalization":

:&lt;math&gt;\int_V d^3r \left|\mathbf{A}_\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r})\right|^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is chosen to be a unit vector which specifies the polarization of the field mode. The condition {{math|'''k''' · ''e''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} means that there are two independent choices of {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which we call {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''2&lt;/sub&gt;}} where {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''1&lt;/sub&gt; · ''e''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''e''{{su|b='''k'''1|p=2}} {{=}} ''e''{{su|b='''k'''2|p=2}} {{=}} 1}}. Thus we define the mode functions:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}\sqrt{V}e_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} \, , \quad \lambda = \begin{cases} 1\\2 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

in terms of which the vector potential becomes{{clarify|date=May 2018}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(\mathbf{r},t)=\sqrt{\frac{2\pi\hbar c^2}{\omega_k V}}\left[a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(0)e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}+a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}^\dagger(0)e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\right]e_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

or:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(\mathbf{r},t)=\sqrt{\frac{2\pi\hbar c^2}{\omega_k V}}\left[a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(0)e^{-i(\omega_k t-\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r})}+a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}^\dagger(0)e^{i(\omega_k t-\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r})}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ω&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''kc''}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''a''{{su|b='''k'''''λ''|p=†}}}} are photon annihilation and creation operators for the mode with wave vector {{mvar|k}} and polarization {{mvar|λ}}. This gives the vector potential for a plane wave mode of the field. The condition for {{math|(''k&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''k&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''k&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} shows that there are infinitely many such modes. The linearity of Maxwell's equations allows us to write:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r}t)=\sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi\hbar c^2}{\omega_k V}}\left[a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(0)e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}+a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}^\dagger(0)e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\right]e_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

for the total vector potential in free space. Using the fact that:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_V d^3r \mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(\mathbf{r})\cdot \mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{k}'\lambda'}^\ast(\mathbf{r})=\delta_{\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k}'}^3\delta_{\lambda,\lambda'}&lt;/math&gt;

we find the field Hamiltonian is:

:&lt;math&gt;H_F=\sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\left(\hbar\omega_k\left(a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}^\dagger a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\right) + \tfrac{1}{2}\right )&lt;/math&gt;

This is the Hamiltonian for an infinite number of uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Thus different modes of the field are independent and satisfy the commutation relations:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left[a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(t),a_{\mathbf{k}'\lambda'}^\dagger(t)\right]&amp;=\delta_{\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k}'}^3\delta_{\lambda,\lambda'} \\[10px]
\left[a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(t),a_{\mathbf{k}'\lambda'}(t)\right]&amp;=\left[a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}^\dagger(t),a_{\mathbf{k}'\lambda'}^\dagger(t)\right]=0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly the least eigenvalue for {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\tfrac{1}{2}\hbar\omega_k&lt;/math&gt;

This state describes the zero-point energy of the vacuum. It appears that this sum is divergent – in fact highly divergent, as putting in the density factor

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{8\pi v^2 dv}{c^3}V&lt;/math&gt;

shows. The summation becomes approximately the integral:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{4\pi h V}{c^3}\int v^3 \, dv&lt;/math&gt;

for high values of {{mvar|v}}. It diverges proportional to {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} for large {{mvar|v}}.

There are two separate questions to consider. First, is the divergence a real one such that the zero-point energy really is infinite? If we consider the volume {{mvar|V}} is contained by perfectly conducting walls, very high frequencies can only be contained by taking more and more perfect conduction. No actual method of containing the high frequencies is possible. Such modes will not be stationary in our box and thus not countable in the stationary energy content. So from this physical point of view the above sum should only extend to those frequencies which are countable; a cut-off energy is thus eminently reasonable. However, on the scale of a "universe" questions of general relativity must be included. Suppose even the boxes could be reproduced, fit together and closed nicely by curving spacetime. Then exact conditions for running waves may be possible. However the very high frequency quanta will still not be contained. As per John Wheeler's "geons"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John Archibald|title=Geons|journal=Physical Review|date=1955|volume=97|issue=2|page=511|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.97.511|bibcode=1955PhRv...97..511W}}&lt;/ref&gt; these will leak out of the system. So again a cut-off is permissible, almost necessary. The question here becomes one of consistency since the very high energy quanta will act as a mass source and start curving the geometry.

This leads to the second question. Divergent or not, finite or infinite, is the zero-point energy of any physical significance? The ignoring of the whole zero-point energy is often encouraged for all practical calculations. The reason for this is that energies are not typically defined by an arbitrary data point, but rather changes in data points, so adding or subtracting a constant (even if infinite) should to be allowed. However this is not the whole story, in reality energy is not so arbitrarily defined: in general relativity the seat of the curvature of spacetime is the energy content and there the absolute amount of energy has real physical meaning. There is no such thing as an arbitrary additive constant with density of field energy. Energy density curves space, and an increase in energy density produces an increase of curvature. Furthermore, the zero-point energy density has other physical consequences e.g. the Casimir effect, contribution to the Lamb shift, or anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, it is clear it is not just a mathematical constant or artifact that can be cancelled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Power|1964|pp=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Necessity of the vacuum field in QED====
The vacuum state of the "free" electromagnetic field (that with no sources) is defined as the ground state in which {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} for all modes {{math|('''k''', ''λ'')}}. The vacuum state, like all stationary states of the field, is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian but not the electric and magnetic field operators. In the vacuum state, therefore, the electric and magnetic fields do not have definite values. We can imagine them to be fluctuating about their mean value of zero.

In a process in which a photon is annihilated (absorbed), we can think of the photon as making a transition into the vacuum state. Similarly, when a photon is created (emitted), it is occasionally useful to imagine that the photon has made a transition out of the vacuum state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dirac|first1=Paul A. M.|title=The Quantum Theory of the Emission and Absorption of Radiation|journal=Proc. Roy. Soc.|date=1927|volume=A114|issue=767|pages=243–265|doi=10.1098/rspa.1927.0039|url=http://www.imotiro.org/repositorio/howto/artigoshistoricosordemcronologica/1927%20-%20DIRAC%201927%20First%20steps%20in%20quantum%20field%20theory%20Invention%20of%20the%20second%20quantization%20method.pdf|accessdate=17 October 2016|bibcode=1927RSPSA.114..243D}}&lt;/ref&gt; An atom, for instance, can be considered to be "dressed" by emission and reabsorption of "virtual photons" from the vacuum. The vacuum state energy described by {{math|∑&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; {{sfrac|''ħω&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''|2}}}} is infinite. We can make the replacement:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\longrightarrow\sum_{\lambda}\left (\frac{1}{2\pi} \right )^3 \int d^3 k = \frac{V}{8\pi^3} \sum_\lambda \int d^3 k&lt;/math&gt;

the zero-point energy density is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{1}{V}\sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\tfrac{1}{2}\hbar\omega_k &amp;=\frac{2}{8\pi^3}\int d^3 k \tfrac{1}{2}\hbar\omega_k \\
&amp;= \frac{4\pi}{4\pi^3} \int dk\,k^2 \left(\tfrac{1}{2}\hbar\omega_k\right) \\
&amp;=\frac{\hbar}{2\pi^2 c^3} \int d\omega\,\omega^3
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

or in other words the spectral energy density of the vacuum field:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_0(\omega)=\frac{\hbar\omega^3}{8\pi^2c^3}&lt;/math&gt;

The zero-point energy density in the frequency range from {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\omega_1}^{\omega_2} d\omega\rho_0(\omega) = \frac{\hbar}{8\pi^2c^3}\left(\omega_2^4-\omega_1^4\right)&lt;/math&gt;

This can be large even in relatively narrow "low frequency" regions of the spectrum. In the optical region from 400 to 700&amp;nbsp;nm, for instance, the above equation yields around 220&amp;nbsp;erg/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

We showed in the above section that the zero-point energy can be eliminated from the Hamiltonian by the normal ordering prescription. However, this elimination does not mean that the vacuum field has been rendered unimportant or without physical consequences. To illustrate this point we consider a linear dipole oscillator in the vacuum. The Hamiltonian for the oscillator plus the field with which it interacts is:

:&lt;math&gt;H=\frac{1}{2m}\left(\mathbf{p}-\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A}\right)^2 + \tfrac{1}{2}m\omega_0^2\mathbf{x}^2 + H_F&lt;/math&gt;

This has the same form as the corresponding classical Hamiltonian and the Heisenberg equations of motion for the oscillator and the field are formally the same as their classical counterparts. For instance the Heisenberg equations for the coordinate {{math|'''x'''}} and the canonical momentum {{math|'''p''' {{=}} ''m'''''ẋ''' +{{sfrac|''e'''''A'''|''c''}}}} of the oscillator are:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{\dot{x}}&amp;=(i\hbar)^{-1}[\mathbf{x}.H] = \frac{1}{m}\left(\mathbf{p}-\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A}\right) \\
\mathbf{\dot{p}}&amp;=(i\hbar)^{-1}[\mathbf{p}.H] 
\begin{align}&amp;=\tfrac{1}{2}\nabla\left(\mathbf{p}-\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A}\right)^2-m\omega_0^2\mathbf{\dot{x}} \\
&amp;=-\frac{1}{m} \left[\left(\mathbf{p}-\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A}\right) \cdot \nabla\right] \left[-\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A}\right] - \frac{1}{m} \left(\mathbf{p}-\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A}\right) \times \nabla \times \left[-\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A}\right] -m\omega_0^2 \mathbf{\dot{x}} \\
&amp;= \frac{e}{c}(\mathbf{\dot{x}}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{A} + \frac{e}{c}\mathbf{\dot{x}} \times \mathbf{B} -m\omega_0^2 \mathbf{\dot{x}} 
\end{align}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

or:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
m \mathbf{\ddot{x}} &amp;= \mathbf{\dot{p}} - \frac{e}{c} \mathbf{\dot{A}} \\
&amp;= -\frac{e}{c} \left[\mathbf{\dot{A}} - \left(\mathbf{\dot{x}} \cdot \nabla\right) \mathbf{A}\right] + \frac{e}{c} \mathbf{\dot{x}} \times \mathbf{B} - m\omega_0^2\mathbf{x} \\
&amp;= e\mathbf{E} + \frac{e}{c} \mathbf{\dot{x}} \times \mathbf{B} - m\omega_0^2\mathbf{x}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

since the rate of change of the vector potential in the frame of the moving charge is given by the convective derivative

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\dot{A}}=\frac{\partial\mathbf{A}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{\dot{x}} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{A}^3 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For nonrelativistic motion we may neglect the magnetic force and replace the expression for {{math|''m'''''ẍ'''}} by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{\ddot{x}}+\omega_0^2\mathbf{x} 
&amp;\approx \frac{e}{m}\mathbf{E} \\
&amp;\approx \sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda} 
\sqrt{\frac{2\pi\hbar\omega_k}{V}} \left[a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(t) + a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}^\dagger(t)\right] e_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
 
Above we have made the electric dipole approximation in which the spatial dependence of the field is neglected. The Heisenberg equation for {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is found similarly from the Hamiltonian to be:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{a}_{\mathbf{k}\lambda} = i \omega_k a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda} + ie \sqrt\frac{2\pi}{\hbar \omega_k V} \mathbf{\dot{x}} \cdot e_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

In the electric dipole approximation.

In deriving these equations for {{math|'''x'''}}, {{math|'''p'''}}, and {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} we have used the fact that equal-time particle and field operators commute. This follows from the assumption that particle and field operators commute at some time (say, {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}) when the matter-field interpretation is presumed to begin, together with the fact that a Heisenberg-picture operator {{math|''A''(''t'')}} evolves in time as {{math|''A''(''t'') {{=}} ''U''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;(''t'')''A''(0)''U''(''t'')}}, where {{math|''U''(''t'')}} is the time evolution operator satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\dot{U} = HU \,,\quad U^\dagger(t) = U^{-1}(t) \,,\quad U(0) = 1 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, we can argue that these operators must commute if we are to obtain the correct equations of motion from the Hamiltonian, just as the corresponding Poisson brackets in classical theory must vanish in order to generate the correct Hamilton equations. The formal solution of the field equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(t)=a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(0)e^{-i\omega_{k}t}+ie \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\hbar \omega_k V}} \int^t_0dt'\,e_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\cdot\mathbf{\dot{x}}(t')e^{i\omega_k\left(t'-t\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore the equation for {{math|''ȧ''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\ddot{x}}+\omega^2_0\mathbf{x}=\frac{e}{m}\mathbf{E}_0(t)+\frac{e}{m}\mathbf{E}_{RR}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_0(t)=i\sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi\hbar \omega_k}{V}}\left[a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(0)e^{-i\omega_kt}-a^\dagger_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(0)e^{i\omega_kt}\right]e_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

and:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_{RR}(t)=-\frac{4\pi e}{V} \sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda} \int^t_0dt'\left[e_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\cdot\mathbf{\dot{x}}\left(t'\right)\right]\cos\omega_k\left(t'-t\right)&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that in the [[Abraham–Lorentz force|radiation reaction]] field, if the mass {{mvar|m}} is regarded as the "observed" mass then we can take:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_{RR}(t)=\frac{2e}{3c^3}\mathbf{\ddot{x}}&lt;/math&gt;

The total field acting on the dipole has two parts, {{math|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} and {{math|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;''RR''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}}. {{math|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} is the free or zero-point field acting on the dipole. It is the homogeneous solution of the Maxwell equation for the field acting on the dipole, i.e., the solution, at the position of the dipole, of the wave equation

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\nabla^2-\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}\right]\mathbf{E}=0&lt;/math&gt;

satisfied by the field in the (source free) vacuum. For this reason {{math|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} is often referred to as the "vacuum field", although it is of course a Heisenberg-picture operator acting on whatever state of the field happens to be appropriate at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}. {{math|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;''RR''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} is the source field, the field generated by the dipole and acting on the dipole.

Using the above equation for {{math|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;''RR''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} we obtain an equation for the Heisenberg-picture operator &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt; that is formally the same as the classical equation for a linear dipole oscillator:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{\ddot{x}} + \omega^2_0\mathbf{x}-\tau \mathbf{\overset{...}{x}}=\frac{e}{m}\mathbf{E}_0(t)
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''τ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|2''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|3''mc''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}. in this instance we have considered a dipole in the vacuum, without any "external" field acting on it. the role of the external field in the above equation is played by the vacuum electric field acting on the dipole.

Classically, a dipole in the vacuum is not acted upon by any "external" field: if there are no sources other than the dipole itself, then the only field acting on the dipole is its own radiation reaction field. In quantum theory however there is always an "external" field, namely the source-free or vacuum field {{math|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}}.

According to our earlier equation for {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} the free field is the only field in existence at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}} as the time at which the interaction between the dipole and the field is "switched on". The state vector of the dipole-field system at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}} is therefore of the form

:&lt;math&gt;|\Psi\rangle=|\text{vac}\rangle|\psi_D\rangle \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|{{!}}vac⟩}} is the vacuum state of the field and {{math|{{!}}''ψ&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''⟩}} is the initial state of the dipole oscillator. The expectation value of the free field is therefore at all times equal to zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{E}_0(t)\rangle=\langle\Psi|\mathbf{E}_0(t)|\Psi\rangle=0&lt;/math&gt;

since {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;(0){{!}}vac⟩ {{=}} 0}}. however, the energy density associated with the free field is infinite:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{1}{4\pi} \left\langle \mathbf{E}^2_0(t) \right\rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{4\pi} \sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda} \sum_{\mathbf{k'}\lambda'} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi\hbar \omega_k}{V}} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi\hbar \omega_{k'}}{V}} \times \left\langle a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(0)a^\dagger_{\mathbf{k'}\lambda'}(0)\right\rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\left (\frac{2\pi\hbar \omega_k}{V} \right )\\
&amp;= \int^\infin_0dw\,\rho_0(\omega)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The important point of this is that the zero-point field energy {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''}} does not affect the Heisenberg equation for {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} since it is a c-number or constant (i.e. an ordinary number rather than an operator) and commutes with {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. We can therefore drop the zero-point field energy from the Hamiltonian, as is usually done. But the zero-point field re-emerges as the homogeneous solution for the field equation. A charged particle in the vacuum will therefore always see a zero-point field of infinite density. This is the origin of one of the infinities of quantum electrodynamics, and it cannot be eliminated by the trivial expedient dropping of the term {{math|∑&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; {{sfrac|''ħω&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''|2}}}} in the field Hamiltonian.

The free field is in fact necessary for the formal consistency of the theory. In particular, it is necessary for the preservation of the commutation relations, which is required by the unitary of time evolution in quantum theory:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left[z(t),p_z(t)\right]&amp;=\left[U^\dagger(t)z(0)U(t),U^\dagger(t)p_z(0)U(t)\right]\\
&amp;=U^\dagger(t)\left[z(0),p_z(0)\right]U(t)\\
&amp;=i\hbar U^\dagger(t)U(t)\\
&amp;=i\hbar
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We can calculate {{math|[''z''(''t''),''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')]}} from the formal solution of the operator equation of motion

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\ddot{x}} + \omega^2_0\mathbf{x}-\tau \mathbf{\overset{...}{x}}=\frac{e}{m}\mathbf{E}_0(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Using the fact that

:&lt;math&gt;\left[a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(0),a^\dagger_{\mathbf{k'}\lambda'}(0)\right]=\delta^3_\mathbf{kk'},\delta_{\lambda\lambda'}&lt;/math&gt;

and that equal-time particle and field operators commute, we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
[z(t),p_z(t)]&amp;=\left[z(t),m\dot{z}(t)\right]+\left[z(t),\frac{e}{c}A_z(t)\right] \\
&amp;=\left[z(t),m\dot{z}(t)\right] \\
&amp;= \left (\frac{i\hbar e^2}{2\pi^2mc^3} \right ) \left (\frac{8\pi}{3} \right ) \int^\infin_0\frac{d\omega\,\omega^4}{\left(\omega^2-\omega^2_0\right)^2+\tau^2\omega^6} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For the dipole oscillator under consideration it can be assumed that the radiative damping rate is small compared with the natural oscillation frequency, i.e., {{math|''τω''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≪ 1}}. Then the integrand above is sharply peaked at {{math|''ω'' {{=}} ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left[z(t),p_z(t)\right]&amp;\approx \frac{2i\hbar e^2}{3\pi mc^3}\omega^3_0 \int^\infin_{-\infin} \frac{dx}{x^2 + \tau^2\omega^6_0} \\
&amp;= \left (\frac{2i\hbar e^2 \omega^3_0}{3\pi mc^3} \right )\left (\frac{\pi}{\tau\omega^3_0} \right ) \\
&amp;=i\hbar
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

the necessity of the vacuum field can also be appreciated by making the small damping approximation in

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;\mathbf{\ddot{x}} + \omega^2_0\mathbf{x}-\tau \mathbf{\overset{...}{x}}=\frac{e}{m}\mathbf{E}_0(t) \\
&amp;\mathbf{\ddot{x}}\approx-\omega^2_0\mathbf{x}(t) &amp;&amp; \mathbf{\overset{...}{x}}\approx-\omega^2_0\mathbf{\dot{x}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\ddot{x}}+\tau\omega^2_0\mathbf{\dot{x}}+\omega^2_0\mathbf{x}\approx\frac{e}{m}\mathbf{E}_0(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Without the free field {{math|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} in this equation the operator {{math|'''x'''(''t'')}} would be exponentially dampened, and commutators like {{math|[''z''(''t''),''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')]}} would approach zero for {{math|''t'' ≫ {{sfrac|1|''τω''{{su|p=2|b=0}}}}}}. With the vacuum field included, however, the commutator is {{math|''iħ''}} at all times, as required by unitarity, and as we have just shown. A similar result is easily worked out for the case of a free particle instead of a dipole oscillator.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milonni|first1=P.W.|authorlink1=Peter W. Milonni|title=Radiation reaction and the nonrelativistic theory of the electron|journal=Physics Letters A|date=1981|volume=82|issue=5|pages=225–226|doi=10.1016/0375-9601(81)90191-2|bibcode=1981PhLA...82..225M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What we have here is an example of a "fluctuation-dissipation elation". Generally speaking if a system is coupled to a bath that can take energy from the system in an effectively irreversible way, then the bath must also cause fluctuations. The fluctuations and the dissipation go hand in hand we cannot have one without the other. In the current example the coupling of a dipole oscillator to the electromagnetic field has a dissipative component, in the form of the zero-point (vacuum) field; given the existence of radiation reaction, the vacuum field must also exist in order to preserve the canonical commutation rule and all it entails.

The spectral density of the vacuum field is fixed by the form of the radiation reaction field, or vice versa: because the radiation reaction field varies with the third derivative of {{math|'''x'''}}, the spectral energy density of the vacuum field must be proportional to the third power of {{mvar|ω}} in order for {{math|[''z''(''t''),''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')]}} to hold. In the case of a dissipative force proportional to {{math|'''ẋ'''}}, by contrast, the fluctuation force must be proportional to &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; in order to maintain the canonical commutation relation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt; This relation between the form of the dissipation and the spectral density of the fluctuation is the essence of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The fact that the canonical commutation relation for a harmonic oscillator coupled to the vacuum field is preserved implies that the zero-point energy of the oscillator is preserved. it is easy to show that after a few damping times the zero-point motion of the oscillator is in fact sustained by the driving zero-point field.&lt;ref name="ReferenceG"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senitzky|first1=I.

===The quantum chromodynamic vacuum===

{{main|QCD vacuum}}

The QCD vacuum is the [[vacuum state]] of [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD). It is an example of a ''[[non-perturbative]]'' vacuum state, characterized by a non-vanishing [[condensate (quantum field theory)|condensate]]s such as the [[gluon condensate]] and the [[quark condensate]] in the complete theory which includes quarks. The presence of these condensates characterizes the confined phase of [[quark matter]]. In technical terms, gluons are [[Vector boson|vector]] [[gauge boson]]s that mediate [[strong interaction]]s of [[quark]]s in [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD). Gluons themselves carry the [[color charge]] of the strong interaction. This is unlike the [[photon]], which mediates the [[Electromagnetic force|electromagnetic interaction]] but lacks an electric charge. Gluons therefore participate in the strong interaction in addition to mediating it, making QCD significantly harder to analyze than QED ([[quantum electrodynamics]]) as it deals with [[nonlinear equation]]s to characterize such interactions.

===The Higgs field===

{{main|Higgs mechanism}}

[[File:Mecanismo de Higgs PH.png|thumb|The potential for the Higgs field, plotted as function of {{math|''ϕ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''ϕ''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. It has a ''Mexican-hat'' or ''champagne-bottle profile'' at the ground.]]
The Standard Model hypothesises a field called the Higgs field (symbol: {{mvar|ϕ}}), which has the unusual property of a non-zero amplitude in its ground state (zero-point) energy after renormalization; i.e., a non-zero vacuum expectation value. It can have this effect because of its unusual "Mexican hat" shaped potential whose lowest "point" is not at its "centre". Below a certain extremely high energy level the existence of this non-zero vacuum expectation [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously breaks]] [[electroweak]] [[gauge symmetry]] which in turn gives rise to the Higgs mechanism and triggers the acquisition of mass by those particles interacting with the field. The Higgs mechanism occurs whenever a charged field has a vacuum expectation value. This effect occurs because scalar field components of the Higgs field are "absorbed" by the massive bosons as degrees of freedom, and couple to the fermions via Yukawa coupling, thereby producing the expected mass terms. The expectation value of {{math|''ϕ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} in the ground state (the [[vacuum expectation value]] or VEV) is then {{math|⟨''ϕ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;⟩ {{=}} {{sfrac|''v''|{{sqrt|2}}}}}}, where {{math|''v'' {{=}} {{sfrac|{{abs|''μ''}}|{{sqrt|''λ''}}}}}}. The measured value of this parameter is approximately {{val|246|u=GeV/c2}}.&lt;ref name="PDGreview2012"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has units of mass, and is the only free parameter of the Standard Model that is not a dimensionless number.

The Higgs mechanism is a type of [[superconductivity]] which occurs in the vacuum. It occurs when all of space is filled with a sea of particles which are charged and thus the field has a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Interaction with the vacuum energy filling the space prevents certain forces from propagating over long distances (as it does in a superconducting medium; e.g., in the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]]).

==Experimental observations==
Zero-point energy has many observed physical consequences.&lt;ref name="harvp|Milonni|1994|p=111"/&gt; It is important to note that zero-point energy is not merely an artefact of mathematical formalism that can, for instance, be dropped from a Hamiltonian by redefining the zero of energy, or by arguing that it is a constant and therefore has no effect on Heisenberg equations of motion without latter consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Milonni|1994|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, such treatment could create a problem at a deeper, as of yet undiscovered, theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peskin|first1=Michael E.|last2=Schroeder|first2=Daniel V.|title=An Introduction To Quantum Field Theory|date=1995|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=9780201503975|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in general relativity the zero of energy (i.e. the energy density of the vacuum) contributes to a cosmological constant of the type introduced by Einstein in order to obtain static solutions to his field equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Milonni|2009|p=865}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zero-point energy density of the vacuum, due to all quantum fields, is extremely large, even when we cut off the largest allowable frequencies based on plausible physical arguments. It implies a cosmological constant larger than the limits imposed by observation by about 120 orders of magnitude. This "cosmological constant problem" remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbott|first1=Larry|title=The Mystery of the Cosmological Constant|journal=Scientific American|date=1988|volume=258|issue=5|page=82|url=http://pages.erau.edu/~reynodb2/blog/Abbott_CosmologicalConstant_SciAm.pdf|bibcode=1988SciAm.258e..82A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casimir effect===
[[File:Casimir plates.svg|thumb|Casimir forces on parallel plates]]
{{main|Casimir effect}}

A phenomenon that is commonly presented as evidence for the existence of zero-point energy in vacuum is the [[Casimir effect]], proposed in 1948 by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[physicist]] [[Hendrik Casimir]], who considered the quantized [[electromagnetic field]] between a pair of grounded, neutral metal plates. The vacuum energy contains contributions from all wavelengths, except those excluded by the spacing between plates. As the plates draw together, more wavelengths are excluded and the vacuum energy decreases. The decrease in energy means there must be a force doing work on the plates as they move.

Early experimental tests from the 1950s onwards gave positive results showing the force was real, but other external factors could not be ruled out as the primary cause, with the range of experimental error sometimes being nearly 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Derjaguin|first1=B.

===Lamb shift===
[[Image:Hydrogen fine structure.svg|thumb|[[Fine structure]] of energy levels in hydrogen – relativistic corrections to the [[Bohr model]]]]
{{main|Lamb shift}}

The quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field have important physical consequences. In addition to the Casimir effect, they also lead to a splitting between the two [[energy level]]s {{math|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''S''&lt;sub&gt;{{sfrac|1|2}}&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;{{sfrac|1|2}}&lt;/sub&gt;}} (in [[term symbol]] notation) of the [[hydrogen atom]] which was not predicted by the [[Dirac equation]], according to which these states should have the same energy. Charged particles can interact with the fluctuations of the quantized vacuum field, leading to slight shifts in energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Itzykson|Zuber|1980|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; this effect is called the Lamb shift.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift of about {{val|4.38|e=-6|u=eV}} is roughly {{val|e=-7}} of the difference between the energies of the 1s and 2s levels, and amounts to 1,058&amp;nbsp;MHz in frequency units. A small part of this shift (27&amp;nbsp;MHz ≈ 3%) arises not from fluctuations of the electromagnetic field, but from fluctuations of the electron–positron field. The creation of (virtual) electron–positron pairs has the effect of screening the Coulomb field and acts as a vacuum dielectric constant. This effect is much more important in muonic atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Le Bellac|first1=Michael|title=Quantum Physics|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107602762|page=381|edition=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fine structure constant===

{{main|fine structure constant}}

Taking {{mvar|ħ}} ([[Planck's constant]] divided by {{math|2π}}), {{mvar|c}} (the [[speed of light]]), and {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''q''{{su|b=''e''|p=2}}|4π''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} (the electromagnetic [[coupling constant]] i.e. a measure of the strength of the [[electromagnetic force]] (where {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the absolute value of the [[Electron charge|electronic charge]] and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]])) we can form a dimensionless quantity called the [[fine-structure constant]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{e^2}{\hbar c} = \frac{q_e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0\hbar c} \approx \frac{1}{137}&lt;/math&gt;

The fine-structure constant is the coupling constant of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) determining the strength of the interaction between electrons and photons. It turns out that the fine structure constant is not really a constant at all owing to the zero-point energy fluctuations of the electron-positron field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Le Bellac|first1=Michael|title=Quantum Physics|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781107602762|page=33|edition=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quantum fluctuations caused by zero-point energy have the effect of screening electric charges: owing to (virtual) electron-positron pair production, the charge of the particle measured far from the particle is far smaller than the charge measured when close to it.

The Heisenberg inequality where {{math|''ħ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''h''|2π}}}}, and {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the standard deviations of position and momentum states that:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_x\Delta_p\ge\frac{1}{2}\hbar&lt;/math&gt;

It means that a short distance implies large momentum and therefore high energy i.e. particles of high energy must be used to explore short distances. QED concludes that the fine structure constant is an increasing function of energy. It has been shown that at energies of the order of the [[Z boson|Z&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; boson]] rest energy, {{math|''m&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈}} 90&amp;nbsp;GeV, that:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\approx\frac{1}{129}&lt;/math&gt;

rather than the low-energy {{math|''α'' ≈ {{sfrac|1|137}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aitchison|first1=Ian|last2=Hey|first2=Anthony|title=Gauge Theories in Particle Physics: A Practical Introduction: Volume 1: From Relativistic Quantum Mechanics to QED|date=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781466512993|page=343|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quigg|first1=C|editor1-last=Espriu|editor1-first=D|editor2-last=Pich|editor2-first=A|title=Advanced School on Electroweak Theory: Hardon Colliders, the Top Quark, and the Higgs Sector|date=1998|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789814545143|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renormalization procedure of eliminating zero-point energy infinities allows the choice of an arbitrary energy (or distance) scale for defining {{mvar|α}}. All in all, {{mvar|α}} depends on the energy scale characteristic of the process under study, and also on details of the renormalization procedure. The energy dependence of {{mvar|α}} has been observed for several years now in precision experiment in high-energy physics.

===Vacuum birefringence===
{{main|Lorentz-violating electrodynamics|Euler–Heisenberg Lagrangian}}
[[File:Eso1641a.ogg|thumb|Light coming from the surface of a strongly magnetic [[neutron star]] (left) becomes linearly polarised as it travels through the vacuum.]]
In the presence of strong electrostatic fields it is predicted that virtual particles become separated from the vacuum state and form real matter. The fact that electromagnetic radiation can be transformed into matter and vice versa leads to fundamentally new features in [[quantum electrodynamics]]. One of the most important consequences is that, even in the vacuum, the Maxwell equations have to be exchanged by more complicated formulas. In general, it will be not possible to separate processes in the vacuum from the processes involving matter since electromagnetic fields can create matter if the field fluctuations are strong enough. This leads to highly complex nonlinear interaction -  gravity will have an effect on the light at the same time the light has an effect on gravity. These effects were first predicted by [[Werner Heisenberg]] and [[Hans Heinrich Euler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Heisenberg|Euler|1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1936 and independently the same year by [[Victor Weisskopf]] who stated: "The physical properties of the vacuum originate in the “zero-point energy” of matter, which also depends on absent particles through the external field strengths and therefore contributes an additional term to the purely Maxwellian field energy".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Weisskopf|1936|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Greiner|Müller|Rafelski|2012|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus strong magnetic fields vary the energy contained in the vacuum. The scale above which the electromagnetic field is expected to become nonlinear is known as the [[Schwinger limit]]. At this point the vacuum has all the properties of a [[Birefringence|birefringent medium]], thus in principle a rotation of the polarization frame (the [[Faraday effect]]) can be observed in empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Greiner|Müller|Rafelski|2012|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Dunne|2012}} for a historical review of the subject.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wide field view of the sky around the very faint neutron star RX J1856.5-3754.jpg|thumb|left|Wide field view of the neutron star [[RX J1856.5-3754]]]]
Both Einstein's theory of special and general relativity state that light should pass freely through a vacuum without being altered, a principle known as [[Lorentz invariance]]. Yet, in theory, large nonlinear self-interaction of light due to quantum fluctuations should lead to this principle being measurably violated if the interactions are strong enough. Nearly all theories of [[quantum gravity]] predict that that Lorentz invariance is not an exact symmetry of nature.  It is predicted the speed at which light travels through the vacuum depends on its direction, polarization and the local strength of the magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Heyl|Shaviv|2000|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a number of inconclusive results which claim to show evidence of a [[Modern searches for Lorentz violation|Lorentz violation]] by finding a rotation of the polarization plane of light coming from distant galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Carroll|Field|1997}} and {{harvs|txt|last1=Kostelecký|last2=Mewes|year1=2009|year2=2013}} for an overview of this area.&lt;/ref&gt; The first concrete evidence for vacuum birefringence was published in 2017 when a team of [[astronomers]] looked at the light coming from the star [[RX J1856.5-3754]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Mignani et al.|2017}} for experiment and {{harvp|Cho|2016}}, {{harvp|Crane|2016}} and {{harvp|Bennett|2016}} for comment.&lt;/ref&gt; the closest discovered [[neutron star]] to [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rees|2012|p=528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberto Mignani at the [[National Institute for Astrophysics]] in [[Milan]] who led the team of [[astronomers]] has commented that "“When Einstein came up with the theory of general relativity 100 years ago, he had no idea that it would be used for navigational systems. The consequences of this discovery probably will also have to be realised on a longer timescale.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Crane|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team found that visible light from the star had undergone linear polarisation{{clarify|date=May 2018}} of around 16%. If the birefringence had been caused by light passing through [[interstellar gas]] or plasma, the effect should have been no more than 1%. Definitive proof would require repeating the observation at other wavelengths and on other neutron stars. At [[X-ray]] wavelengths the polarization from the quantum fluctuations should be near 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cho|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no [[telescope]] currently exists that can make such measurements, there are several proposed X-ray telescopes that may soon be able to verify the result conclusively such as China's [[Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope]] (HXMT) and NASA's Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE).

This would indicate empty space exerted some form of [[Negative energy|negative pressure or energy]].

There is no natural candidate for what might cause what has been called [[dark energy]] but the current best guess is that it is the zero-point energy of the vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amit|first1=Gilead|title=Our Implausible Unvierse|journal=New Scientist|date=2016|volume=232|issue=3097|page=35|url=https://www.newscientist.com/issue/3097/}}&lt;/ref&gt; One difficulty with this assumption is that the zero-point energy of the vacuum is absurdly large compared to the observed cosmological constant. In [[general relativity]], [[mass]] and energy are equivalent; both produce a gravitational field and therefore the theorized vacuum energy of quantum field theory should have led the universe ripping itself to pieces. This obviously has not happened and this issue, called the [[cosmological constant problem]], is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in physics.

The [[European Space Agency]] is building the [[Euclid (spacecraft)|Euclid telescope]]. Due to launch in 2020 it will map galaxies up to 10 billion light years away. By seeing how dark energy influences their arrangement and shape, the mission will allow scientists to see if the strength of dark energy has changed. If dark energy is found to vary throughout time it would indicate it is due to [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], where observed acceleration is due to the energy of a [[scalar field]], rather than the cosmological constant. No evidence of quintessence is yet available, but it has not been ruled out either. It generally predicts a slightly slower acceleration of the expansion of the universe than the cosmological constant. Some scientists think that the best evidence for quintessence would come from violations of Einstein's [[equivalence principle]] and [[equivalence principle#Tests of the Einstein equivalence principle|variation of the fundamental constants]] in space or time.&lt;ref name="Carroll1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean M.|title=Quintessence and the Rest of the World: Suppressing Long-Range Interactions|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=81|issue=15|year=1998|pages=3067–3070|issn=0031-9007|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.3067|arxiv = astro-ph/9806099 |bibcode = 1998PhRvL..81.3067C |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/356711/files/9806099.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scalar field]]s are predicted by the ''[[Standard Model]] of particle physics'' and [[string theory]], but an analogous problem to the cosmological constant problem (or the problem of constructing models of [[cosmological inflation]]) occurs: [[renormalization]] theory predicts that scalar fields should acquire large masses again due to zero-point energy.

===Cosmic inflation===
{{unsolved|physics|Why does the observable universe have more matter than antimatter?}}
{{main|Inflation (cosmology)}}

[[Cosmic inflation]] is a faster-than-light expansion of space just after the [[Big Bang]]. It explains the origin of the [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large-scale structure of the cosmos]]. It is believed [[quantum vacuum fluctuations]] caused by zero-point energy arising in the microscopic inflationary period, later became magnified to a cosmic size, becoming the gravitational seeds for galaxies and structure in the Universe (see [[galaxy formation and evolution]] and [[structure formation]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, Neil deGrasse and Donald Goldsmith (2004), ''Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution'', W. W. Norton &amp; Co., pp. 84–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Many physicists also believe that inflation explains why the Universe appears to be the same in all directions ([[isotropic]]), why the [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation is distributed evenly, why the Universe is flat, and why no [[magnetic monopole]]s have been observed.

The mechanism for inflation is unclear, it is similar in effect to dark energy but is a far more energetic and short lived process. As with dark energy the best explanation is some form of vacuum energy arising from quantum fluctuations. It may be that inflation caused [[baryogenesis]], the hypothetical physical processes that produced an [[symmetry|asymmetry]] (imbalance) between [[baryon]]s and antibaryons produced in the [[Big Bang|very early universe]], but this is far from certain.

==Alternative theories==
There has been a long debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Enz|first1=Charles P.|editor1-last=Enz|editor1-first=C. P.|editor2-last=Mehra|editor2-first=J.|title=Physical Reality and Mathematical Description Is the Zero-Point Energy Real?|date=1974|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-94-010-2274-3|pages=124–132|doi=10.1007/978-94-010-2274-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; over the question of whether zero-point fluctuations of quantized vacuum fields are “real” i.e. do they have physical effects that cannot be interpreted by an equally valid alternative theory? [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]], in particular, attempted to formulate QED without reference to zero-point fluctuations via his "source theory".&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvs|txt|last1=Schwinger|year1=1998a|year2=1998b|year3=1998c}}&lt;/ref&gt; From such an approach it is possible to derive the Casimir Effect without reference to a fluctuating field. Such a derivation was first given by Schwinger (1975)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwinger|first1=Julian|title=Casimir effect in source theory|journal=Letters in Mathematical Physics|date=1975|volume=1|issue=1|pages=43–47|doi=10.1007/BF00405585|bibcode=1975LMaPh...1...43S}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a scalar field, and then generalized to the electromagnetic case by Schwinger, DeRaad, and Milton (1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwinger|first1=Julian|last2=DeRaad|first2=Lester L.|last3=Milton|first3=Kimball A.|title=Casimir effect in dielectrics|journal=Annals of Physics|date=1978|volume=115|issue=1|pages=1–23|doi=10.1016/0003-4916(78)90172-0|bibcode=1978AnPhy.115....1S}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they state "the vacuum is regarded as truly a state with all physical properties equal to zero". More recently [[Robert Jaffe|Jaffe]] (2005)&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Jaffe |first=R. L.|year=2005|title=Casimir effect and the quantum vacuum|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|volume=72 |issue=2 |page=021301|arxiv= hep-th/0503158|bibcode= 2005PhRvD..72b1301J|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.72.021301}}&lt;/ref&gt; has highlighted a similar approach in deriving the Casimir effect stating "the concept of zero-point fluctuations is a heuristic and calculational aid in the description of the Casimir effect, but not a necessity in QED."

Nevertheless, as Jaffe himself notes in his paper, "no one has shown that source theory or another S-matrix based approach can provide a complete description of QED to all orders." Furthermore, [[Peter W. Milonni|Milonni]] has shown the necessity of the vacuum field for the formal consistency of QED.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Milonni|1994|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[QCD]], [[color confinement]] has led physicists to abandon the source theory or [[S-matrix]] based approach for the [[strong interactions]]. The [[Higgs mechanism]], [[Hawking Radiation]] and the [[Unruh effect]] are also theorized to be dependent on zero-point vacuum fluctuations, the field contribution being an inseparable parts of these theories. Jaffe continues "Even if one could argue away zero-point contributions to the quantum vacuum energy, the problem of spontaneous symmetry breaking remains: condensates [ground state vacua] that carry energy appear at many energy scales in the Standard Model. So there is good reason to be skeptical of attempts to avoid the standard formulation of quantum field theory and the zero-point energies it brings with it." It is difficult to judge the physical reality of infinite zero-point energies that are inherent in field theories, but modern physics does not know any better way to construct gauge-invariant, renormalizable theories than with zero-point energy and they would seem to be a necessity for any attempt at a [[Grand Unified Theory|unified theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Greiner|Müller|Rafelski|2012|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chaotic and emergent phenomena==
{{Beyond the Standard Model}}
{{see also|Chaos theory|Emergence|Self-organization}}
The mathematical models used in [[classical electromagnetism]], [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) and the [[standard model]] all view the [[QED vacuum|electromagnetic vacuum]] as a linear system with no overall observable consequence (e.g. in the case of the Casimir effect, Lamb shift, and so on) these phenomena can be explained by alternative mechanisms other than action of the vacuum by arbitrary changes to the normal ordering of field operators. See [[#Alternative Theories|alternative theories]] section). This is a consequence of viewing electromagnetism as a U(1) gauge theory, which topologically does not allow the complex interaction of a field with and on itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=Terence W.|title=Topological Foundations of Electromagnetism|date=2008|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|isbn=9789812779977|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=e0-QdLqT-pIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Terence+W.+Barrett%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In higher symmetry groups and in reality, the vacuum is not a calm, randomly fluctuating, largely immaterial and passive substance, but at times can be viewed as a turbulent virtual [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] that can have complex vortices (i.e. [[soliton]]s vis-à-vis particles), [[entangled state]]s and a rich nonlinear structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Greiner|Müller|Rafelski|2012|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many observed nonlinear physical electromagnetic phenomena such as [[Aharonov–Bohm effect|Aharonov–Bohm]] (AB)&lt;ref&gt;

One may query what this has to do with zero-point energy. Given the complex and adaptive behaviour that arises from nonlinear systems considerable attention in recent years has gone into studying a new class of [[phase transition]]s which occur at absolute zero temperature. These are quantum phase transitions which are driven by EM field fluctuations as a consequence of zero-point energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kais|first1=Sabre|editor1-last=Popelier|editor1-first=Paul|title=Finite Size Scaling for Criticality of the Schrodinger Equation: Solving the Schrodinger Equation: Has Everything Been Tried?|date=2011|publisher=Imperial College Press|location=Singapore|isbn=978-1-84816-724-7|pages=91–92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFK7CgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of a spontaneous phase transition that are attributed to zero-point fluctuations can be found in [[superconductor]]s. Superconductivity is one of the best known empirically quantified macroscopic electromagnetic phenomena whose basis is recognised to be quantum mechanical in origin. The behaviour of the electric and magnetic fields under superconductivity is governed by the [[London equations]]. However, it has been questioned in a series of journal articles whether the quantum mechanically canonised London equations can be given a purely classical derivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Classical Physics Makes a Comeback|publisher=The Times|date=Jan 14, 1982|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bostick,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bostick|first1=W.|title=Controversy over whether classical systems like plasmas can behave like superconductors (which have heretofore been supposed to be strictly quantum-mechanically dominated)|journal=International Journal of Fusion Energy|date=1985|volume=3|issue=2|pages=47–51|url=https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:17042212|issn=0146-4981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bostick|first1=W.|title=The morphology of the electron|journal=International Journal of Fusion Energy|date=1985|volume=3|issue=1|pages=9–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, has claimed to show that the London equations do indeed have a classical origin that applies to superconductors and to some collisionless plasmas as well.

The idea that the vacuum energy can have multiple stable energy states is a leading hypothesis for the cause of [[cosmic inflation]]. In fact, it has been argued that these early vacuum fluctuations led to the expansion of the universe and in turn have guaranteed the non-equilibrium conditions necessary to drive order from chaos, as without such expansion the universe would have reached thermal equilibrium and no complexity could have existed. With the continued accelerated expansion of the universe, the cosmos generates an energy gradient that increases the "free energy" (i.e. the available, usable or potential energy for useful work) which the universe is able to utilize to create ever more complex forms of order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Chaisson|first1=Eric J.|title=Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics in an Energy-Rich Universe|pages=21–31|doi=10.1007/11672906_2|isbn=978-3-540-22495-2|series=Understanding Complex Systems|year=2005|chapter=2 Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics in an Energy-Rich Universe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaisson|first1=Eric J.|title=Cosmic Evolution: The Rise of Complexity in Nature|date=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674009875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KG2SZouhFuIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only reason Earth's environment does not decay into an equilibrium state is that it receives a daily dose of sunshine and that, in turn, is due to the sun "polluting" interstellar space with decreasing entropy. The sun's fusion power is only possible due to the gravitational disequilibrium of matter that arose from cosmic expansion. In this essence, the vacuum energy can be viewed as the key cause of the negative entropy (i.e. structure) throughout the universe. That humanity might alter the morphology of the vacuum energy to create an energy gradient for useful work is the subject of much controversy.

==Purported applications==

Physicists overwhelmingly reject any possibility that the zero-point energy field can be exploited to obtain useful energy ([[work (physics)|work]]) or uncompensated momentum; such efforts are seen as tantamount to [[perpetual motion machine]]s.

Nevertheless, the allure of free energy has motivated such research, usually falling in the category of [[fringe science]]. As long ago as 1889 (before quantum theory or discovery of the zero point energy) [[Nikola Tesla]] proposed that useful energy could be obtained from free space, or what was assumed at that time to be an all-pervasive [[Aether (classical element)|aether]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=I|title=Peeking inside an electron's screen|journal=Science News|date=1997|volume=151|page=89|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/physics-5|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have since claimed to exploit zero-point or vacuum energy with a large amount of [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] literature causing ridicule around the subject.&lt;ref name=army&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[U.S. Army]] [[National Ground Intelligence Center]]|url=http://info.publicintelligence.net/USArmy-ZeroPointEnergy.pdf|title=Zero-Point Energy: Can We Get Something From Nothing?|author=Amber M.

===Casimir batteries and engines===
A common assumption is that the Casimir force is of little practical use; the argument is made that the only way to actually gain energy from the two plates is to allow them to come together (getting them apart again would then require more energy), and therefore it is a one-use-only tiny force in nature.&lt;ref name=army/&gt; In 1984 [[Robert L.

The battery can be recharged by making the electrical forces slightly stronger than the Casimir force to reexpand the plates.

In particular, Casimir effect might be the critical factor in the stiction failure of MEMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bordag|first1=Michael|last2=Klimchitskaya|first2=Galina Leonidovna|last3=Mohideen|first3=Umar|last4=Mostepanenko|first4=Vladimir Mikhaylovich|title=Advances in the Casimir Effect|date=2009|publisher=`Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-923874-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqE1f_s5PgYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When they brought a metallized sphere close up to the plate, the attractive Casimir force between the two objects made the plate rotate. They also studied the dynamical behaviour of the MEMS device by making the plate oscillate. The Casimir force reduced the rate of oscillation and led to nonlinear phenomena, such as [[hysteresis]] and [[bistability]] in the frequency response of the oscillator. According to the team, the system’s behaviour agreed well with theoretical calculations.

Despite this and several similar peer reviewed papers, there is not a consensus as to whether such devices can produce a continuous output of work. Garret Moddel at [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado]] has highlighted that he believes such devices hinge on the assumption that the Casimir force is a [[Conservative force|nonconservative force]], he argues that there is sufficient evidence (e.g. analysis by Scandurra (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Scandurra|first1=M.|title=Thermodynamic properties of the quantum vacuum|eprint=hep-th/0104127|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to say that the Casimir effect is a conservative force and therefore even though such an engine can exploit the Casimir force for useful work it cannot produce more output energy than has been input into the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Moddel|first1=Garret|title=Assessment of proposed electromagnetic quantum vacuum energy extraction methods|eprint=0910.5893|class=cond-mat.stat-mech|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 patent by Haisch and Moddel&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|7379286}}&lt;/ref&gt; details a device that is able to extract power from zero-point fluctuations using a gas that circulates through a Casimir cavity. As gas atoms circulate around the system they enter the cavity. Upon entering the electrons spin down to release energy via electromagnetic radiation. This radiation is then extracted by an absorber. On exiting the cavity the ambient vacuum fluctuations (i.e. the zero-point field) impart energy on the electrons to return the orbitals to previous energy levels, as predicted by Senitzky (1960).&lt;ref name="ReferenceG"/&gt; The gas then goes through a pump and flows through the system again.

===Single heat baths===
In 1951 [[Herbert Callen|Callen]] and Welton&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; proved the quantum [[fluctuation-dissipation theorem]] (FDT) which was originally formulated in classical form by [[Harry Nyquist|Nyquist]] (1928)&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; as an explanation for observed [[Johnson noise]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt; in electric circuits. Fluctuation-dissipation theorem showed that when something dissipates energy, in an effectively irreversible way, a connected heat bath must also fluctuate. The fluctuations and the dissipation go hand in hand; it is impossible to have one without the other. The implication of FDT being that the vacuum could be treated as a heat bath coupled to a dissipative force and as such energy could, in part, be extracted from the vacuum for potentially useful work.&lt;ref name="harvp|Milonni|1994|p=54"/&gt; Such a theory has met with resistance: Macdonald (1962)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacDonald|first1=D.K.C.|title=On Brownian Movement and irreversibility|journal=Physica|date=1962|volume=28|issue=4|pages=409–416|doi=10.1016/0031-8914(62)90019-8|bibcode=1962Phy....28..409M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Harris (1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=I.

Despite such criticism, FDT has been shown to be true experimentally under certain quantum, non-classical conditions.

===Space travel and gravitational shielding===
The use of zero-point energy for space travel is highly speculative. A complete [[Theory of everything|quantum theory of gravitation]] (that would deal with the role of quantum phenomena like zero-point energy) does not yet exist. Speculative papers explaining a relationship between zero-point energy and gravitational shielding effects have been proposed,&lt;ref name="Haisch et al. 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noever|first1=David|last2=Bremner|first2=Christopher|title=Large-scale Sakharov condition|journal=AIAA 35th Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit|date=1999|doi=10.2514/6.1999-2146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Most serious scientific research in this area depends on the theorized anti-gravitational properties of [[antimatter]] (currently being tested at the [[Antiproton Decelerator|alpha experiment]] at [[CERN]]) and/or the effects of non-Newtonian forces such as the [[gravitomagnetic field]] under specific quantum conditions.

Since all atoms have [[Spin (physics)|spin]], gravitational permeability may be able to differ from material to material. A strong [[toroid]]al gravitational field that acts against the force of gravity could be generated by materials that have [[Chaos theory|nonlinear properties]] that enhance time-varying gravitational fields. Such an effect would be analogous to the nonlinear electromagnetic permeability of iron making it an effective core (i.e. the doughnut of iron) in a transformer, whose properties are dependent on magnetic permeability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forward|first1=R.

From 1971 to 1974 Henry William Wallace, a scientist at [[GE Aerospace]] was issued with three patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3626606}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3626605}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3823570}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace used [[Bryce DeWitt|Dewitt's]] theory to develop an experimental apparatus for generating and detecting a secondary gravitational field, which he named the kinemassic field (now better known as the [[gravitomagnetic field]]). In his three patents, Wallace describes three different methods used for detection of the gravitomagnetic field – change in the motion of a body on a pivot, detection of a transverse voltage in a semiconductor crystal, and a change in the specific heat of a crystal material having spin-aligned nuclei. There are no publicly available independent tests verifying Wallace's devices. Such an effect if any would be small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barker|first1=B. M.|last2=O'Connell|first2=R.

At this time Lieutenant General George Muellner, the outgoing head of the Boeing Phantom Works, confirmed that attempts by Boeing to work with Podkletnov had been blocked by Moscow, also commenting that "The physical principles – and Podkletnov's device is not the only one – appear to be valid... There is basic science there. They're not breaking the laws of physics. The issue is whether the science can be engineered into something workable"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cook|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EmDrive built by Eagleworks inside the test chamber.jpg|thumb|[[EmDrive]] built at NASA Eagleworks laboratory]]Froning and Roach (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Froning|first1=H.|last2=Roach|first2=R.|title=Preliminary Simulations of Vehicle Interactions with the Quantum Vacuum by Fluid Dynamic Approximations|journal=AIAA 38th Joint Propulsion Conference &amp; Exhibit|date=2002|volume=AIAA-2002-3925|pages=52236|doi=10.2514/6.2002-3925|isbn=978-1-62410-115-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; put forward a paper that builds on the work of Puthoff, Haisch and Alcubierre. They used fluid dynamic simulations to model the interaction of a vehicle (like that proposed by Alcubierre) with the zero-point field. Vacuum field perturbations are simulated by fluid field perturbations and the aerodynamic resistance of viscous drag exerted on the interior of the vehicle is compared to the Lorentz force exerted by the zero-point field (a Casimir-like force is exerted on the exterior by unbalanced zero-point radiation pressures). They find that the optimized negative energy required for an Alcubierre drive is where it is a saucer-shaped vehicle with [[toroid]]al electromagnetic fields. The EM fields distort the vacuum field perturbations surrounding the craft sufficiently to affect the permeability and permittivity of space.

In 2014 [[Lyndon B.

While peer review doesn’t guarantee that a finding or observation is valid, it does indicate that independent scientists looked over the experimental setup, results, and interpretation and that they could not find any obvious errors in the methodology and that they found the results reasonable. In the paper, the authors identify and discuss nine potential sources of experimental errors, including rogue air currents, leaky electromagnetic radiation, and magnetic interactions. Not all of them could be completely ruled out, and further peer reviewed experimentation is needed in order to rule these potential errors out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drake|first1=Nadia|last2=Greshko|first2=Michael|title=NASA Team Claims ‘Impossible’ Space Engine Works—Get the Facts|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/11/nasa-impossible-emdrive-physics-peer-review-space-science/|accessdate=22 November 2016|publisher=National Geographic|date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
